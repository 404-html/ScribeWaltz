1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,490
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,450
What I'm hoping the book will do in the
long run is that it will lead to more

3
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:11,220
attention being focused on the Americas.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,210
This is a very neglected
area of the world. Uh,

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,540
as far as deep and ancient
archeology goes, I'm, it's,

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,110
the recent history of the Americas
has been relatively well studied,

7
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:25,500
but the deep and ancient history has
not been, has not been well studied,

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,890
and I think America is going to contain
revelations for us about our story and

9
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:34,830
about our past.
And I'm serious when I,

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,070
when I suggest that America is the most
plausible and the most likely homebase

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,550
for a lost civilization. If you're going
to propose a lost civilization, you need,

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,540
there are certain preconditions, you need
a, you can't have it on a small island.

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,960
There's got to be a large landmass mass
with enormous resources and the ability

14
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:58,800
for population to grow and for those
resources to be, to be mobilized.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,320
And what I suddenly realized,
you asked earlier why I,

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,310
why I started to write this book at all
is what the new evidence is pointing to

17
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:07,740
is that the Americans have
been wrongly neglected.

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,980
That here we have a giant continental
land mass with extraordinary resources

19
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:16,530
that has just been ruled out of
the story of human civilization.

20
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:21,531
But once we take account of the fact that
there was a giant cataclysm over North

21
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:24,300
America 12,000,
800 years ago,

22
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:29,301
and once we start looking as I do in
America before at the incredible deep

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,400
indepth similarities between,
for example,

24
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:36,180
the religious system of ancient
Egypt and the religious system of the

25
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:39,330
Mississippi Valley, then you
realize that you're into, uh,

26
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,740
into a global mystery here and that the
answer to that mystery may not at all be

27
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:48,330
in the old world and may very much
be, uh, in the, in the Americas. See,

28
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:50,340
it's odd.
I mentioned Mountville earlier on.

29
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,360
It's kind of odd that we should find a,

30
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:57,690
what is essentially the
ancient Egyptian religion, uh,

31
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,540
manifesting in the
symbolism of Mountville,

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,720
the ascent to Orion that
transit to the Milky Way,

33
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,220
the journey along the Milky Way.
Very,

34
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:09,210
these are very specific
and idiosyncratic ideas.

35
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:12,510
And what makes it doubly ARD
is Mountville isn't that old.

36
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,720
Mountville as a site is
about a thousand years old.

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,860
Ancient Egypt had already been
gone completely from the world, uh,

38
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,960
for at least 600 years
before Manville was created.

39
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:28,170
The end of ancient Egypt. There's,
there's Mountville and uh,

40
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,400
w w what we're looking at in the
foreground is mount B and we're looking at

41
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:35,290
mount day and the in the,
in the distance, um, and,

42
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,230
and the complete circle of mounds.

43
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,810
What w what is odd about it is we find
the system of ancient Egyptian ideas in

44
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:47,160
Manville 500 years after ancient Egypt
has gone from the world. The Romans,

45
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,170
the Romans were the end of ancient
Egypt by 400 ancient Egypt has gone.

46
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,180
Marrickville doesn't even exist then,

47
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,390
but 600 years later it is created and
it manifests the set of ancient Egyptian

48
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,181
ideas.

49
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,600
Clearly it did not get that as a result
of direct transmission from ancient

50
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,160
Egypt unless they were time travelers.

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,720
The only way I think it could have got
it is as a result of a legacy passed down

52
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:15,400
from a much earlier civilization that has
influenced and affected many different

53
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:18,790
parts of the world and the
characteristics of that civilization,

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,050
the shamanistic heart of it, the use
of altered states of consciousness.

55
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:27,340
The focus on those are amongst the reasons
that I would suggest that America is

56
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:31,930
the place that we should be looking and
the big mysteries are in the areas that

57
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,500
were so devastated at the end of the
last ice age up in the north of North

58
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:40,360
America, the channeled scab
lands in particular and
then the Mississippi Valley.

59
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:42,370
The whole story of the Mississippi Valley.
Yes,

60
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:43,900
Mountville as a thousand years old,

61
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,100
but then you can go back to
poverty point in Louisiana,

62
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,710
which is 2,700 years old.

63
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,450
You can go to Watson break in Louisiana,
which is 5,000, 500 years old.

64
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:58,810
You can go to sites like Conley,
which are 8,000 years old.

65
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,280
The system keeps on going back
and disappearing back into time.

66
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:08,200
And I think the most fruitful new work
on exploring the origins of civilization

67
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:12,040
is going to occur counterintuitively,
uh, in the Americas,

68
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,010
the very last place on earth that
archeologists have ever thought

69
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,350
thought to look when it's a
funny thing because you know,

70
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,490
in can 1987,

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,180
you know,
I was 17 and I was gang banging,

72
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,940
I got shot and you know,

73
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,120
that I got hit by a 22 and
it as hollow points do it.

74
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,140
Um, it, it broke into three,
three pieces, the hollow point.

75
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,360
And one of them pro punctured
my lung on my left side. And,

76
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:46,900
uh, you know, they were telling
me, well, you know, do you smoke?

77
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,700
No, I don't really smoke because I
didn't smoke cigarettes. I smoked weed,

78
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:56,530
but I wasn't going to divulge that
at the time. I was 17 and you know,

79
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,710
and uh, they said, well, you know,

80
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:03,010
well that's good because you'll never
smoke again. It was like you'd do,

81
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,050
they punctured your lung
and blah, blah, blah.

82
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,910
They thought I was going to have to
work off one lung but in the three days,

83
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,210
you know,

84
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,200
they were able to get the blood out of
the lung and I was able to get it back,

85
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,350
you know, through the exercises
they told me, you know,

86
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:22,030
to get it back to its regular size and
I've never had a problem since then.

87
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,540
Knock on wood, the piece of metal
out. No, I still got the three pieces.

88
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,730
That's like when I go do my physicals
and they do the, you know, the Mri,

89
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,110
the Mris and the x rays and all
that. The doctors, you know,

90
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:36,450
sometimes they forget because they
see so many patients. Mr Freeze, um,

91
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,560
these appeared to be
bullet fragments with,

92
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,250
what is that? Well, you just
said it, doctor bullet, frank.

93
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,310
You've seen him a dozen times,
you know, and uh, yeah, I,

94
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,070
I was very lucky. I was very lucky
because, you know, punctured my lung.

95
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:57,530
And then two of the pieces, one was
by the heart and when was by my spine,

96
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,450
but I was at a Martin Luther
King Hospital in Linwood.

97
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,830
And we call that place killer king because
you go in there for something small

98
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:11,210
and ended up dying or come out, you
know, gift out or something. So you know,

99
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:16,211
I wasn't going to allow them to try and
get to those bullets or those fragments

100
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,370
to open you up. Yeah. Not
An ah, cause you know,

101
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,950
they didn't have a great success rate.
What kind of lung exercises they give.

102
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,060
You try to pump your lungs,

103
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:29,660
but they give you this breathing apparatus
that has like a ball in it, right.

104
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,010
And it has two lines and you know,
it's the first line you're trying to,

105
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,750
they're telling you every day for
five minutes, 10 minutes to blow that,

106
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,910
you know,
not all in one shot,

107
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:45,440
but like to keep practicing getting the
ball up there and that will then help

108
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,180
inflate the lung and get it back.

109
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:51,320
So I had to do that for probably
like three weeks. And, uh,

110
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,750
you know, the puncture wound, it
healed itself pretty much. And uh,

111
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,430
and the pieces are still in your
lungs? Not In the law. No, it's, it,

112
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,580
it went passed along. It did shot
passed along. So you know, it's uh,

113
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,660
I got a piece up here and one
off to the side in the back.

114
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,770
Well when it's really cold
due to the nerve damage,

115
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,770
I'll get like stinging like you know,
like when your,

116
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:18,860
when your hand falls asleep,
the little needles that,

117
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,840
I'll get that here and then, and then
back here where it entered, they had to,

118
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,870
they had to cut right in between a rib
here to stick the tube in to put the hose

119
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:34,460
into the lung to get the blood out
of the lung. Yeah. As you know,

120
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,840
I was living crazy before I got into
the music. The music saved my life

121
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,850
pretty much. So after high
school I started touring and uh,

122
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,030
that's when like I started
getting my heaviest.

123
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:50,920
We were eating fast food every single
day, three times a day, never drink water,

124
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,030
soda, only smoking like a pack
and a half of cigarettes a day.

125
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:58,290
And just on the road
traveling. And then, uh, by 19,

126
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,080
I got up to 305 pounds,
19 years old.

127
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,070
And I remember one night laying down
to go to bed and I just felt my heart

128
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:10,210
pumping ridiculous Lee. And I was
just like, no way. This is like,

129
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,930
I think I'm going to die.
And like I've woke up in a panic and

130
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,730
weird thing is I got up and I went
outside for maybe like 10 minutes and I

131
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:22,930
smoked another cigarette and I was
just like, this is the problem.

132
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:28,290
Like I'm coughing up stuff my hardest
going to give out and I'm only 19 years

133
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:29,530
old,
you know.

134
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:34,360
So around that same week is when
I discovered MMA with my brother,

135
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:37,510
just like watching ultimate
fighter on TV. And so, uh,

136
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,080
I went on my last tour and,
uh, I told the guys like, Hey,

137
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,660
I'm going to go train him and made it
look, oh, you're going to be a fighter,

138
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:46,900
like you think, you know? And I was just
like, I don't know what I'm going to be,

139
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,510
but I'm going to go train and get
healthy. And they were like, okay, cool.

140
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,430
We'll see you in a couple of
months. You know what I mean? Like,

141
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,580
no one really believed that I was going
to go and actually train and fight.

142
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:59,190
I told you I, well, he's been like this
big quiet nonconfrontational guys. So, um,

143
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,800
yeah, I went and took my first
class Moyie Thai and March 1st,

144
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,800
2010 took my first Muay Thai class and
then after like a month of doing Muay

145
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,420
Thai,
I started to see progression.

146
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,790
I started to see like my face
was slimming down all this stuff.

147
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,240
So it gave me motivation to
keep going. And then, um,

148
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,110
I remember going to a MMA event,
amateur,

149
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:25,520
and I saw really big heavyweight
guys going at it. So I was like, oh,

150
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:29,700
I think I want to do it. I want to give
it a shot. And, uh, so my coach was like,

151
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:32,910
okay, if you lose a hundred pounds,
I'll like, I'll find you a fight.

152
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,380
And I was like, a hundred
pounds. He's like, yeah,

153
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:37,540
I'll find you a fight if you
lose a hundred pounds. So, um,

154
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,590
I just kept training within 11 months,
lost a hundred pounds,

155
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,450
and then took my first fight.

156
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,570
And then she felt like every fight has
been until now because it's like now I

157
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:52,410
have like more of a drive and a passion
for it, but all the way up until then,

158
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:56,190
everything kind of happened by
coincidence or just like, I just,

159
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,480
I didn't really want to fight, but I had
a lot of people like, oh, you're so good.

160
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,141
Like keep doing it.

161
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:04,980
And I was the first time in my life I've
ever had people supporting me to like

162
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:09,981
really do something that was big and I
was a new guy and I was in shape and I

163
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:13,760
can, you know, girls are noticing
me now. I'm like all either,

164
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,060
my whole life changed within a
year of training MMA. Like wow,

165
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,350
from going to this guy that nobody even
paid attention to, to just like, oh, hey,

166
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:25,950
how's it going? Are you know,
like, oh, you're so in shape.
And I was just like, oh,

167
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:29,550
this is weird. It's still weird. It's
only been nine years, eight years,

168
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,420
you know? So everything is
still very new to me. I've only,

169
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,040
my first day stepping on the mat was
like, you know, nine years, years ago,

170
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,890
I got to beat him to be the best, right.
So I need to work hard. What's your,

171
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,540
what's your take on him? You can't
take away what he does in the sport.

172
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,800
What does his outside his personal
life, that's all he say. She say,

173
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:52,320
I have my words after
to the California stuff.

174
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:55,980
We went to two 26 or whatever it
was in Vegas and got moved here.

175
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,190
Cause his lifestyle and drug
tests and all the extra stuff,

176
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,900
however you want to code it up, his
past, you know, I'm done. What about,

177
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,720
I had my words there, the fact that
you kept using God and Jesus and this,

178
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:08,200
this and this and I'm a god fearing God.

179
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,030
Read my Bible every morning and I
don't like the fact that you can,

180
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,620
that he would do that.
I'm like I said I want it now,

181
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:16,500
but at the time my words was
the fact that he did that.

182
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,060
And then at the same time I
want to interview in this.

183
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:20,520
I want to thank God and it's,
that kind of rubbed me wrong.

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,890
And then we flew on a plane
together and like I said,

185
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,380
I saw the way he was acting
when he came on a plane.

186
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:28,410
Like we not doing this because of him,
like all that at a time bothering me.

187
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,110
And I was a pent up any and now
something else going into that fight.

188
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,010
That was something on my shoulders because
I had posted something because when a

189
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:37,170
UFC called me right before I got
on the flight, I was like, oh,

190
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:41,220
don't come a the way to Vegas now I got
my wife, she's eight months pregnant,

191
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,700
she's 30 weeks, whatever. She can't
travel after this. She's struggling.

192
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:47,940
We hauled them bags and Y'all call me
and I'll say, don't come this and this.

193
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,370
Go back home. We're gonna fly you out
again. Like I'm not doing this again.

194
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,350
And then when they get to the, well we
can get you here, but we get you Cali,

195
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:55,930
but we can't take your wife
like what? Like, well you,

196
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,880
we pay your ticket and
coach ticket like no,

197
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,570
fuck that all because Jon Jones is that,
that's what got me mad.

198
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,250
That's what they're trying to save money.

199
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:08,050
Pretty much flying people because we was
literally walking down the wrong way to

200
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:10,360
the plane. When they call him
the cheese can I turn around?

201
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,520
But then when we got it like okay you
come here but we can get you to Cali but

202
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:17,170
we can get to your wife to Cali.
Like my wife is 30 weeks pregnant.

203
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:18,660
She's here when she's coming like,

204
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,490
well we don't know what to do because
you bought her ticket isn't it?

205
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,770
Like what do you mean you don't know
what to do? Get her nose ticket.

206
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,470
Like I paved my family. What about the
people that's on the way right now?

207
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,970
Like all they got to find their own way
and that made me weak week fight week of

208
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:33,660
the fight. The thing of the things
that you have to think about, you know,

209
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,390
talking with that,

210
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,230
that's the last thing I was worried about
God and then I get there and they said,

211
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,820
when you get, make sure you got your
workout. If you don't have your workout,

212
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:44,320
schedule the Pie set already. As
soon as you get there, go do it.

213
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,140
I did mine like a month and a half ahead
of time. I'm like I said, I'm puncturing.

214
00:12:49,141 --> 00:12:52,210
Like I like having stuff done.
Yeah, come get ready to go into Pr.

215
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,380
I'm packing my bags and I get a call.
Oh, you can't come to the API. Why?

216
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,310
John just came in and said he went to
work out so we closed the gym down.

217
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,140
You're not allowed. Oh, y'all
called me two months ago.

218
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:04,510
Told me to set my schedule
to come ahead of time.

219
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,960
I'm really getting ready to walk to
my Uber that's outside and you say,

220
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:10,480
I can't come now. Like I sorry.
And then we can do is John,

221
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,470
why can't you work out at the same place
with John's work and not fighting for

222
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:17,320
the same thing with kindness? It on. I'm
there in the summer and kind of show up.

223
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:20,680
They're coming into there, but you gotta
leave. Wow. Just rode it. Yeah. Really?

224
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,920
You all gotten kindness? I was car
parked up on the sidewalk. Come on. Yeah.

225
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:26,290
They have security guards to block
the stairs off and everything.

226
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,190
I don't want no special treatment from
her or from anybody. If I was a champ,

227
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,420
treat me the same. You know what I mean?
Is some people are different, I guess.

228
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:41,320
I don't know if it's John or his camp
that was doing that or UFC is doing or

229
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,413
security or what,

230
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,230
but it rubbed me wrong that
we aren't equal anymore.

231
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:50,960
Okay.
