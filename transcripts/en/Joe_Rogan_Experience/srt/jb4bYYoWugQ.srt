1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,021
So I'm,

3
00:00:02,021 --> 00:00:06,750
I'm playing with the idea
of dark spiritual forces at
work behind human history,

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,880
manipulating Moctezuma,

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,030
manipulating Cortez and plunging
mankind into the sea of,

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,220
of cruelty and misery.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,280
Um,

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,031
and you know,

9
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:20,910
what redeems the story for
me and does it at all times,

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,520
is that the human spirit's
still shines through.

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,990
Even in the darkest times.

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,130
There is courage,

13
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:27,000
there is decency,

14
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,140
there is love people.

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,170
People struggle to show
the best in themselves and,

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,620
and,

17
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,190
and,

18
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,630
and to deliver the best in themselves.

19
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,490
So I've tried to show both sides of this.

20
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,590
This book is about the
battle of good against evil.

21
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,410
And it's not that the Spanish are good
and the Aztecs are evil because the

22
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:41,400
Spanish were wicked,

23
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:41,731
wicked,

24
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:42,630
wicked as well.

25
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:43,530
Um,

26
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,610
and they did terrible things.

27
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,020
They fed people to dogs.

28
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:46,770
Um,

29
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,041
they,

30
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:47,411
they,

31
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:48,570
they burned people at the state.

32
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,460
What is actually burning
somebody at the stake,

33
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:52,080
if not a form of human sacrifice.

34
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,550
That's what the Spanish were due to.

35
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:54,384
Their God.

36
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,770
They were sacrificing people to,

37
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:57,940
their gods are no
different from the Aztec.

38
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,770
So in that respect,

39
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,580
the level of sacrifice
was so insane that I,

40
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,280
I tried to explain it to a friend of
mine and he literally told me I was

41
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:09,200
bullshitting when I told them that
80,000 people were sacrificed.

42
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,650
Thousand were sacrificed period of like,

43
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,571
like four days,

44
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:13,320
four days,

45
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,590
uh,

46
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,730
with teams of killers,

47
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:18,570
50 teams of killers working at the top
of the great pyramid to process people

48
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:19,620
within a minute or two.

49
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,903
Um,

50
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:21,921
processed them.

51
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:22,561
The think of it,

52
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:23,251
that's how it's done.

53
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,050
It was done on an industrial scale.

54
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,620
Cues of victims stretching
a mile in every direction,

55
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,340
uh,

56
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,460
marching up the pyramid and having
there and having their hearts cut out.

57
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,560
And all of this in honor of a,

58
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,940
of a demonic,

59
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,421
uh,

60
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:37,470
demonic entity,

61
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,870
which the Aztecs passionately believed in.

62
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,200
They believed that he needed to
be fed human hearts and blood.

63
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,043
And when they call,

64
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,720
they called him Witsell a poshly,

65
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:48,120
which means hummingbird at
the left hand of the son.

66
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,560
He's the war God after whom,

67
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:51,770
this after whom this novel is a,

68
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:52,041
is,

69
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:52,320
is,

70
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,153
is named.

71
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:53,680
Uh,

72
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,451
and he,

73
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:54,691
I,

74
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:55,171
the way,

75
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:56,100
the way I look at it,

76
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,320
the same demonic entities manipulating
both Moctezuma and Cortez,

77
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,800
he appears to Cortez in dreams and
takes on the disguise of Saint Peter.

78
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,960
He appears to Moctezuma as the,

79
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:07,680
as the war God,

80
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,990
but it's the same demon
that's playing with men.

81
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:12,450
And that's one reason why I wrote this
is a novel because you can't get into

82
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:13,920
this stuff in a nonfiction book,

83
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,911
but it's very real.

84
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:18,780
It's a very real part of human history
and the whole shape of the world we live

85
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:19,614
in today.

86
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,210
The,

87
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,830
the terrible genocide that
happened in North America,

88
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:24,720
the destruction of the
North American Indians,

89
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,160
the,

90
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,700
the conquest of Peru,

91
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,450
the whole relationship of
the European powers to,

92
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,360
to Africa,

93
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:30,901
for example.

94
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:35,220
All of this was based on what
happened in those years between 15,

95
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,150
19 and 15,

96
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:39,480
21 when the Spanish conquest
of Mexico and folded.

97
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,260
Um,

98
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:40,561
and,

99
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:41,011
and,

100
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:41,310
uh,

101
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,530
I think we would lead on to a dark track.

102
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,230
Imagine how it could have
been if those two cultures,

103
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:50,040
if the Spanish and the Aztecs had
met one another in a spirit of mutual

104
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:50,760
learning,

105
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,350
how much there was to exchange,

106
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:55,380
how much each side of the Atlantic
could have learned from the other.

107
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:56,100
Instead of three,

108
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,380
it becomes this kind of conflagration of,

109
00:02:59,410 --> 00:02:59,720
uh,

110
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,080
of,

111
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,913
of blood.

112
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,120
But it's difficult to place ourselves in
the mindset of the people of that time.

113
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,350
It is difficult for us to do that today.

114
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,110
Um,

115
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,000
and I have to say,

116
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,500
when you look at the Spaniards,

117
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,390
I mean 490 men turn up on the coast of
Mexico in 11 ships and they are going to

118
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:21,040
take on this empire that can put
200,000 men into the field that will,

119
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,180
if they catch you,

120
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,820
will match you up the pyramid
and cut your heart out.

121
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,770
And many Spaniards were sacrificed,

122
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,110
uh,

123
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,180
in sight of their,

124
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:29,080
of their colleagues.

125
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,820
Um,

126
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,690
it was an extraordinary time.

127
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:34,710
It was an extraordinary event and men
of those times were different from,

128
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,633
from men of today,

129
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,483
I believe.

130
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,520
What is the main stream
explanation for human sacrifice?

131
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:42,190
Like what?

132
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,230
What do they believe started off?

133
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:44,440
Well,

134
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,440
that it's that it's a feeding of
psychic energy to supernatural beings.

135
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,840
That's what human sacrifices about that,

136
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:52,080
that,

137
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,930
that you take the psychic
energy of the individual,

138
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:56,950
you're going to kill you,

139
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,843
kill them,

140
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,260
take their psychic energy and feed it
to these vampire like creatures that are

141
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:03,810
lying in the beyond that,

142
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,820
that thrive on human misery and pain.

143
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,991
And you know,

144
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:10,390
who are we to say that
such things do not exist?

145
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:12,460
We don't understand the nature of reality.

146
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,200
And if you look at human culture day,

147
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,580
I mean look at wars.

148
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:17,470
Look at wars that are
happening in the world today.

149
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:20,470
Look at the tens of thousands of people
that are being slaughtered in a warfare

150
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:21,010
today.

151
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,990
That's also a kind of human sacrifice.

152
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,310
I think we have to consider
the possibility that some
kind of demonic forces

153
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,830
thriving on this and,

154
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:29,470
and,

155
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,240
and being nourished by it.

156
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,570
And that's one of the things that we
need to do as human beings is to separate

157
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:35,620
ourselves from that and say,

158
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:36,400
no,

159
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,390
we will not do that.

160
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,220
We will not feed that energy.

161
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,720
We will not offer lives
each of the beyond.

162
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,100
I don't go with you on that,

163
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,510
but I do in a way.

164
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,910
I don't believe in demons,

165
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,750
but I do.

166
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,750
I think it's undeniable that there have
been massive groups of people that have

167
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,550
participated in horrific things.

168
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,580
So what is that if not demonic?

169
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,360
I believe it's,

170
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,230
I believe it's demonic.

171
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,430
I can't prove it.

172
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,350
I can't prove that that's the case.

173
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:09,340
I just think we should stay open to that
possibility that the nature of reality

174
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:13,900
is so complex and so multilayered that
there may be much more going on than we

175
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:15,160
think and that if we just,

176
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,570
if we just confine our explanations of
things to purely economic and material

177
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:19,991
terms,

178
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:24,991
we may be missing part of the picture and
that when the ancients spoke of angels

179
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:26,140
and demons to use words,

180
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:28,840
I'm not saying that I believe
in angels or demons as such,

181
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:31,570
but when they spoke of Lot
and light and dark forces,

182
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,660
negative and positive
forces playing on the,

183
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:35,411
on the human race,

184
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:36,760
maybe they had something going.

185
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,020
Maybe there was something to that.

186
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,890
I always consider the fact that human
beings have this incredibly broad spectrum

187
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,940
of possibility,

188
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,080
incredibly bar,

189
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,580
broad spectrum of behavior,

190
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,110
personality of circumstance,

191
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:47,944
of genetics,

192
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,500
and that there's this
Yin and Yang of life.

193
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:55,501
There's this pull and push of life and
that the extreme ends of it are good and

194
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:55,960
evil.

195
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,441
Good and evil.

196
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:57,040
Yeah.

197
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,680
And it may,

198
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,060
it may not be a demon,

199
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:02,450
but it might as well be a demon if you're
marching 80,000 people off the side of

200
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:05,030
a pyramid and cutting their heart
out with a fucking stone tool.

201
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,810
Yeah.

202
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,530
That's demonic.

203
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,363
It might as well be,

204
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,420
might as well be a demon.

205
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:08,910
Yeah.

206
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,161
And,

207
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:09,421
and,

208
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:10,370
and that is a,

209
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,390
that is worth considering.

210
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:11,690
And the,

211
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,590
and the question is what is,

212
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,190
you know,

213
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,120
what is going on here?

214
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:19,121
I have a very dear friend called James
Tiburon who refers to this world that we

215
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:24,080
live in as a university of
[inaudible] that we have,

216
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,310
that we have lessons to learn from oddity,

217
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,210
maybe dualities,

218
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,000
not the whole thing.

219
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,760
Maybe there is an overarching
unity and oneness in,

220
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:32,511
in all things.

221
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,240
But right now here in this
incarnation on planet earth,

222
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,190
we have to learn from duality.

223
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:40,340
And the thing about duality
is human beings can choose.

224
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:41,420
We can always choose,

225
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:44,300
even in the most straightened
and difficult circumstances,

226
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:47,210
we can always choose for the
light rather than the darkness.

227
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:48,890
We can always choose for
good rather than evil.

228
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:52,820
We don't have to take that act that
causes pain and suffering to another human

229
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:53,180
being.

230
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,440
We never have to do that.

231
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,210
We can always choose not to.

232
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:01,130
The alarming thing is that people often
will choose the act that causes pain and

233
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:02,060
suffering to others,

234
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,310
and we are defined by our choices.

235
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:07,340
And this is where we need to grow
up as a species and start to choose,

236
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,690
start to choose the light.

237
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:18,690
Okay.
