1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,300
Three two one

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,540
Bam would live.

3
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,010
We got up early as a motherfucker,

4
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:08,844
ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,803
Not really.

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,470
It's 10:00 AM it.

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,110
Didn't we do one at like 4:00 AM before?

8
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,210
We didn't want that 5:00 AM for it.

9
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:16,760
Was it for,

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,840
it was a a is a England card,

11
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:19,410
right?

12
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,090
Was it something [inaudible] or something?

13
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,840
Congo and might've been,

14
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:25,990
it might've been China,

15
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:26,491
but China.

16
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:28,590
Like what time is in Africa right now?

17
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,783
Is it yesterday?

18
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,040
I think it's there.

19
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,170
Is it Wednesday now?

20
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,680
It's definitely 1960

21
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,730
I forgot he knocked out Whitaker.

22
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:43,980
We're looking at Wonderboy
stop and Whitaker.

23
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,460
That's,

24
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:44,751
yeah,

25
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:45,210
that's,

26
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,260
that's 70 yeah,

27
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:46,920
but that was,

28
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,810
Whitaker was diminished man.

29
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,920
Getting down to one 70 it
was a fucking battle for him.

30
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,180
Do you look at Wonderboy
w what he's accomplished?

31
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:55,280
It's so impressive.

32
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,650
All the indicators would point that
Wonderboy should win this fight,

33
00:00:58,651 --> 00:00:58,990
but I don't,

34
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,250
I'm,

35
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,310
I'm on the fence man.

36
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,051
Well,

37
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:03,240
I think till really is a bad,

38
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,230
bad man.

39
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,460
There's no question about it.

40
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:09,150
But he did come up real
short on the way in,

41
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:10,680
which really bums me out.

42
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,490
Now I had heard that his
pregnant girlfriend is in,

43
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:18,540
this is what everyone's saying is in
the hospital and that she's had some

44
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:23,130
serious issues and he's been going back
and forth to the hospital and he hasn't,

45
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,620
we just didn't have a
chance to cut the weight.

46
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:26,290
Right.

47
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,770
A lot of people claim you know that.

48
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,690
That's exactly what the,

49
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:31,411
what the issue was.

50
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't know that drama is never good.

51
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,190
Especially your first main card,

52
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,490
main event in your
hometown against Wonderboy.

53
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,020
There's enough pressure as it is.

54
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,291
Well,

55
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,210
the cowboy five was big pressure fight,

56
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:44,170
but he rose to the occasion was it,

57
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,731
was it,

58
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:46,450
cause we didn't know who he was really.

59
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:46,680
You haven't,

60
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,360
this is opportunity for sure,

61
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:49,630
but you're fighting a smaller guy.

62
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,550
It's cowboy,

63
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:50,881
you know,

64
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:52,620
so he goes forward and does work.

65
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,640
Now it's like,

66
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,780
man,

67
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,820
I mean there's been guys
who have blown up before,

68
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,210
but the hype on a till and
I'm all up on his dick,

69
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,051
but you know,

70
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:02,250
there's a ton of hype on it.

71
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:03,210
If you went into this one,

72
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,500
it's off to the races.

73
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:04,981
It is,

74
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:08,000
but he's fucking four and a half
pounds over championship weight.

75
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,970
That is a lot.

76
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,811
That's not a little,

77
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,740
that's a lot.

78
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,660
It's such an advantage to,

79
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,210
you know,

80
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,690
fighters that have missed
weight are undefeated this year.

81
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,530
When they feel fight,

82
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,363
they're undefeated.

83
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:17,551
Yeah,

84
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:18,570
it's a big advantage.

85
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,960
I think that was one cheating.

86
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,170
It is a fun if you do
it on purpose for sure.

87
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,210
I think what's interesting
with Wonderboy did,

88
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,000
he said you've got to weigh
one 88 the next day type move.

89
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,010
Just kills them are big boy.

90
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,391
Yeah.

91
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:30,540
It kills a really big boy.

92
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,080
Very,

93
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,801
very smart.

94
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:35,550
Like whatever advantage that he got from
not cutting that extra three pounds,

95
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,190
you know?

96
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,620
And now he's a three and a half pounds.

97
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,080
Now he's lost a little bit of it.

98
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:40,914
I guess it's,

99
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,270
if you're Wonderboy though,

100
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,040
you want to drag this into later rounds,

101
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,251
you know,

102
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,360
he's gonna come out aggressive.

103
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:45,571
You know,

104
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:47,070
he said some drama,

105
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:50,280
cutting weight and he had this cut
more weight to maintain it the day,

106
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,271
the day of.

107
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,030
So yeah,

108
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,210
it's all fascinating,

109
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:54,510
man.

110
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,290
So fascinating.

111
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,280
We're going to find out a lot.

112
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,241
The other thing is too,

113
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,200
the styles,

114
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,400
like what Wonderboy does

115
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,320
is a kicking distance.

116
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,050
Like if you watch like the
exchanges that he's at,

117
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,570
he moves real good at the waist,

118
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,291
like a snake,

119
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,220
like back and forth,

120
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,150
but he wants to keep you not
even at Moitai taking distance.

121
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,100
He keeps you at karate kick in distance,

122
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:17,230
far sideways at very far,

123
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,700
far stuff to reach.

124
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,410
Dan's got to close that gap and closing
that gap is when wonder boys the most

125
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,570
dangerous and if you see
some of his training footage,

126
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,640
he seems to be concentrating on
blitzing in and lent and countering and

127
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:33,300
sidestepping and countering door.

128
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,530
If you look at Wonderboy as history,

129
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,270
whenever we fight the aggressive dudes,

130
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,040
they get fucked up.

131
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,401
Yeah,

132
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:40,610
that's like that Scott,

133
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,970
who wants to start?

134
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,900
I mean you're on and that's
what till wants to do.

135
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,480
Yeah,

136
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,060
that's very interesting.

137
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,160
I'm telling him that if nothing in the
slight would surprise me and list down

138
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,030
until just goes out there and
just just no respect merchant.

139
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,220
That's the only thing
that would surprise me.

140
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,630
But if till does win strap a fucking
rocket ship that boys back cause in other

141
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:00,880
Bisping's retired UK need to face,

142
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:03,070
that's him that he's the fucking guy man.

143
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,971
Even if he loses,

144
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:06,160
he could still be that he's 25 years old.

145
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:06,461
Yeah,

146
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,600
but not to that extent.

147
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,980
You know like you beat Wonderboy
and knock out Wonderboy.

148
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,823
It's fucking,

149
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,660
I mean you tell him,

150
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,500
man,

151
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,510
he's a super talented striker though.

152
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:17,950
What he did to cowboy.

153
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,600
It wasn't just impressive.

154
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,030
It was like complete domination.

155
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,993
Demoralized,

156
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,940
just controlled the range.

157
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,890
He controlled every single aspect of
the exchange is cowboy got like one good

158
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:31,570
knee off at one point in time,

159
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,610
but that was in one good
right hand to the body.

160
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,130
I rewatched the fight the other
day just to kind of get amped up.

161
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,110
Impressive.

162
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:38,471
Oh my.

163
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:39,670
He obliterated them.

164
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,700
That's the thing too about till I think
get so much hype is a lot of guys talk

165
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,040
like Colby come tins,

166
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,450
amazing talented fighter.

167
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,950
There's a lot of guys talk a lot of stuff.

168
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:48,191
I'm like,

169
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:48,401
all right,

170
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:49,240
it's more of an act.

171
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,313
They're super talented.

172
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,640
When Darren till talks,

173
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:52,330
my God,

174
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,800
it's almost that Conor McGregor effect.

175
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:54,040
I'm like,

176
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,731
I booked this full,

177
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:55,960
actually believes it.

178
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,500
She believes it and his was ridiculous
skills and it's going to go a long ways.

179
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,960
Hmm.

180
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,580
What's your tank down?

181
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,090
There's be no Jujitsu in this,

182
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:04,750
Eddie.

183
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,920
No digits all,

184
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:07,060
I'll ain't go to the ground.

185
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,340
We're all I know about Darren till his,

186
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,900
his fight with Serone.

187
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:11,734
That's it.

188
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,083
This card.

189
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:13,960
Uh,

190
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,500
you know,

191
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:14,741
it's,

192
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:15,490
um,

193
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,330
it's going to be interesting.

194
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,751
You were in,

195
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:19,120
I don't really know who we're going to
have Gunnar Nelson on the card though.

196
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,380
He's going to announce it on the car.

197
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:20,681
No,

198
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:21,251
he got hurt.

199
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:22,120
But you don't have Gunnar Nelson.

200
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:22,631
Neil Magna,

201
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:23,141
which was a fun,

202
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:23,401
fun.

203
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:24,310
It's so great fight.

204
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,230
They were going to do Gunnar Nelson until,

205
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:28,230
but for whatever reason they
decided to go with Wonderboy.

206
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,291
Jason Knight.

207
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:29,621
I know,

208
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,454
I know about him.

209
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,323
Did he already fight?

210
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,230
[inaudible] the main card
and he's on the main card.

211
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,821
Beautiful.

212
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:34,000
Who is,

213
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,833
he is a tough fight.

214
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,733
Um,

215
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,581
um,

216
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:36,821
like,

217
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:37,300
uh,

218
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:37,700
uh,

219
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,533
here's a tough fight.

220
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,543
Very tough fight.

221
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:40,811
Oh,

222
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:41,200
Connie.

223
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,381
Yeah,

224
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:42,040
he's a monster.

225
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,371
Connie.

226
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:42,850
Yeah.

227
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,750
The Japanese guy.

228
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,020
No,

229
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,421
no,

230
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:44,640
no.

231
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,250
He's,

232
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,431
well,

233
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:46,510
he lives in Finland,

234
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,381
but uh,

235
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,820
what is his background?

236
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,833
He's a,

237
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,430
he's a really good wrestler who
also has wild ass strikes mouth.

238
00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:56,960
Fine.

239
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
Super five for your boy.

240
00:05:58,161 --> 00:05:58,640
Yeah.

241
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,473
Yeah.

242
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,660
Lila magnae who's Neil and magnified
now for Wonderboy though there's not,

243
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,420
there's not a ton of upside.

244
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,940
I don't know why he took it to be honest.

245
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:11,960
Why?

246
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,070
It's a good matchup for him.

247
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:13,820
But yeah,

248
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,601
it's you're,

249
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,460
you're in dangerous territory,

250
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:16,701
right?

251
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,750
You're fighting the number nine guy.

252
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:18,740
You ranked number one,

253
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,210
he missed his weight.

254
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,380
He's huge.

255
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,393
Like there's just,

256
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,680
I feel like all the pressure's
off Wonderboy right now,

257
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:25,850
especially after he missed the weight.

258
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,803
But I just,

259
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,440
if you're Wonderboy and
even if you starch till,

260
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:33,500
they're not giving you a title shot
until Woodley loses that strap.

261
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,080
Wonderboy is not fighting for a
title 14 two and one for wonder.

262
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:38,181
Boy.

263
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:42,050
You got to remember the only loss
was to Tyron Woodley and then two,

264
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:43,340
I'm Matt Brown.

265
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,520
Those two fights and
one draw with Woodley.

266
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,493
Crazy.

267
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,260
That's why couldn't you
fight with the again,

268
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,213
they fought.

269
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,300
Well that's the,

270
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:54,380
that's what he's asking.

271
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:54,861
First of all,

272
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:55,281
he's saying,

273
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,470
why don't I get a shot
at the interim title?

274
00:06:57,471 --> 00:07:01,130
How are you giving the interim title
to Colby Covington who only beat Damien

275
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:01,131
Maia,

276
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:03,770
who's 40 years old who's
clearly past his prime.

277
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,101
How was,

278
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:08,070
how was that good enough to get
him a shot at the interim title?

279
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,200
And I talked a lot of shit.

280
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,160
That's it.

281
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,401
Yeah,

282
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:11,390
there you go basically yet.

283
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,490
But it goes along with the same time.

284
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:13,731
Yeah.

285
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:14,840
It goes a long way this day and age,

286
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:16,310
but at the same time with Rda,

287
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:16,851
you know,

288
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:18,920
they're not doing Colby and
he favors send them down to,

289
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:19,400
oh no,

290
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,731
I'm sorry.

291
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,600
It's in Chicago.

292
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,490
Chicago to fight RDA,

293
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:23,240
which is,

294
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,470
if you look at Colby style,

295
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,300
it's probably the worst matchup for him.

296
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,830
He's a heavy underdog,

297
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,671
so I'm,

298
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:28,891
I'm,

299
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:29,724
I'm hoping,

300
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,441
not hoping,

301
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,760
I think what their plan would be,

302
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:33,770
Rda wins that fights Woodley,

303
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:37,970
which is tough matchup for Woodley
and the Rda were able to beat Woodley.

304
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:43,030
Then you have Wonderboy slipping or Colby
wins and then you got mad shit talking

305
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:46,220
with him and Woodley and
it gets very interesting.

306
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,480
Get super intellect that fight.

307
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,010
It's going to fire me and Tyron Colby
has done or dog in every one of those

308
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:52,844
fights.

309
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
But Rda Woodley,

310
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:54,861
you got a barn,

311
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:55,460
burn your hands.

312
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,510
That's a great matchup.

313
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,373
Yeah,

314
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,771
Rda.

315
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:59,450
Woodley's very interesting because,

316
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,860
because as much as as they,

317
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,340
you know,

318
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,300
I love woodland.

319
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:03,450
I think his style is ridiculous.

320
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:04,400
He's gonna be tough to beat.

321
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,241
You know,

322
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,830
I think they want some bit
of turnover in their ugly.

323
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,870
That's what they want.

324
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:09,704
Some turnover.

325
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,760
What is RDA going to do with
two Woodley and mean he can't,

326
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,940
he's not going to ever take him down.

327
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:14,510
No.

328
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,210
He's the only thing he's got striking,

329
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,930
striking and his movements good.

330
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,270
And if it does go to the
ground and his kicks,

331
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,080
that's a tough one to beat for anybody.

332
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,370
Even as striking,

333
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,380
even RDA striking Woodley has,

334
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,030
I'll put you to sleep instantly.

335
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:30,620
Striking what Lee has more power.

336
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:32,810
Rda has better fundamentals,

337
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:34,910
I would say as far as
putting it more type.

338
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,601
Run it together.

339
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:36,860
Kids with the high speed,

340
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:38,260
the power and the explosives.

341
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,520
Goddamn nightmare.

342
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,960
It's still the favorite in the fight.

343
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:42,920
It's not going to the ground.

344
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,330
He wants it to.

345
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,100
Woodley just got through shoulder surgery.

346
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,200
He just got his Labor repaired,

347
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,520
which is not the worst shoulder
surgery and he does that mean exactly.

348
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:56,040
Stapled the Labor on
labor from now the labor.

349
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,310
Um,

350
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,730
uh,

351
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,290
he had some sort of a tear in it that it,

352
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,230
that fucked up in the Damien
Maia fight like insulin.

353
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,670
They stitch it back together again,

354
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:05,970
but he's gone through crazy PRP
and all kinds of other shit now.

355
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:10,971
He put up a video of him hitting mitts
and it's only been about three months

356
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:13,240
since the surgery and he's hitting me.

357
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:13,950
It's hard.

358
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,750
I don't know if that's
an old video though.

359
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:16,584
He's sneaky.

360
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,740
You know,

361
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,840
he put up this video,

362
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,940
he's a free him doe.

363
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,401
He might,

364
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:23,940
he might be doing and we
definitely got some injections.

365
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:26,820
He was talking about all the different
things that he's going to do as far as

366
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:26,950
their,

367
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,900
he came on the podcast just a few weeks
after shoulder surgery and he was moving

368
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:33,120
around normal and moving
his hands around normal.

369
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,110
But it really depends entirely
on how bad the s the big one is.

370
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,130
The bicep tendon,

371
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,730
when the bicep tendon gets torn
off the muscle off the bone,

372
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,350
and then they have to put it back in,

373
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,790
stapled down everywhere.

374
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,481
And then they have to,

375
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:46,800
it does work right now.

376
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,030
Now does not for pitchers if you're
a pitcher and that shit goes south.

377
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,260
Not yet your dignity done,

378
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,370
but for a fighter.

379
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,150
No problem.

380
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,650
It doesn't seem to be
a problem for fighters,

381
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,551
but I bet Woodley.

382
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:57,660
So you got RDA,

383
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,500
Colby.

384
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,920
So the obviously the winner that
will fight Woodley end of the year.

385
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,030
Will it be back into the year?

386
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:03,720
No doubt.

387
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,051
Yeah.

388
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,990
It could very well be on
the December 31st card.

389
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:07,290
You know,

390
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,070
that's a big one.

391
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,700
Huge Guide.

392
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,180
Uh,

393
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,571
you know,

394
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:13,290
I mean I think they were trying to talk
about him being on the August card in

395
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:13,801
la,

396
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:15,150
but that's not going to happen soon.

397
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,600
Yeah.

398
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,520
That's a damn good card right now.

399
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,000
Right.

400
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,290
La is who do they,

401
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:19,740
isn't it?

402
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,620
Who's they were willing for GSP nae
and I'll say that's not happening.

403
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:23,940
So what do you,

404
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:25,050
who do you have now in la?

405
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,830
Let's see,

406
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,790
let's pull that up.

407
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:27,600
Did they put,

408
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,410
do they find a opponent for a,

409
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,250
this is going to be at staples.

410
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,030
Yeah.

411
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:38,030
Well they want to do cyborg versus Nunez
not happening in a suspended is she?

412
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:39,810
Yeah.

413
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,643
What's your hurt?

414
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,670
Uh,

415
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,280
her hands from whooping
that ass whooping that ass.

416
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,503
Damn.

417
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,501
Oh yeah.

418
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:47,550
Tj and Cody.

419
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,440
Woo.

420
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,373
Okay.

421
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,530
Yeah.

422
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:51,711
Oh,

423
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:52,411
a very cards.

424
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:52,940
Not,

425
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,400
no.

426
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,900
A little bit of Struggle Street right now.

427
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,460
Not nearly as good.

428
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,790
August 4th car car's not nearly
as good as it was going to be.

429
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,240
No,

430
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,410
it was going to be a barn burner.

431
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,720
But in Congress,

432
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,970
Santa,

433
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,371
yeah.

434
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:08,680
So far this cards is a not well,

435
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,570
that's a lot of time.

436
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,240
Not because they have some time though.

437
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,841
It does.

438
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:15,720
We're only in May and then there's
some great fights coming up.

439
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,090
Yeah.

440
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,870
Robert Whitaker,

441
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,290
UL Romero son.

442
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,710
Ooh,

443
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,480
Chicago is one of the best cards ever.

444
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,460
Joe's Colby Covington.

445
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:28,061
Holly Holm.

446
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:29,020
Megan Anderson.

447
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:29,201
Hey,

448
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:30,040
let this sink in.

449
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,720
You got cm punk verse that Jack,

450
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,531
I forget his name.

451
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:34,630
Jackson over Overeem.

452
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,620
Curtis blaze.

453
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,720
Claudia [inaudible] Esparza.

454
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,560
That's so disgusting.

455
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,560
And then on the card you got Rashad Evans
and my boy Joey Benevidez was pedis.

456
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,810
Cm punk said take a seat y'all.

457
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,310
That is so crazy.

458
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,730
Mike Jackson.

459
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,291
That is,

460
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,030
that is so crazy to me.

461
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,160
Oh,

462
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,650
and one verse one.

463
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,980
Does that piss you off a no.

464
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:58,150
Cause I get it cause I'm,

465
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:58,781
I'm not a fight.

466
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:00,520
If I was a fighter I'd be furious.

467
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,880
But now out of the game in,

468
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,780
in entertainment,

469
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,730
I get what you're doing.

470
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,380
Sounds a wolf tickets there.

471
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:06,701
I see.

472
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:07,534
I get what you're doing.

473
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,390
It's just the worst fight
of all time in UFC history,

474
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,260
skill wise,

475
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,341
spice.

476
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:13,300
These goodies about to fight.

477
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:14,134
Now,

478
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,723
Eric Spicy.

479
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,750
When do you guys know about him?

480
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,710
I don't know anything about them.

481
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,430
No.

482
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,263
I mean I've probably seen him.

483
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,070
He's a black belt in Jujitsu
is really the favorite.

484
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,070
He's really good.

485
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:24,904
He's a weird body.

486
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,803
Um,

487
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,581
where's he from?

488
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,590
Gym Somewhere on the east coast.

489
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:30,010
Big Key.

490
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:30,671
When he's in La.

491
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:32,640
He comes through my school really good.

492
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,150
Merck's everybody.

493
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,690
Really?

494
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,523
Yeah.

495
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:35,861
Does that,

496
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:38,230
does that cm punk Jackson
stuff bother you Joe?

497
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:39,700
Are you used to it now bothers me.

498
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,103
I don't like it.

499
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,250
I don't mind him fighting.

500
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:44,560
I think it's great that he's fighting
it and then you'll see that he's testing

501
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:45,490
himself in the UFC.

502
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,290
Even if they wanted to do in the UFC,

503
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,430
have him on the F,

504
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,750
you know the prelims.

505
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,460
Put them on fs one,

506
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,090
you know,

507
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,923
make it,

508
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,381
you know,

509
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,310
making it a um,

510
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,900
a fight pass thing.

511
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,790
I think his contract one allowed that.

512
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,860
I think if it's guns or pay per view,

513
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,210
I would assume if you're seeing Punky,

514
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:02,260
have that big of a draw.

515
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,640
Maybe he was,

516
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,503
is he still,

517
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,780
do you think how many people are going
to buy that paper view to watch him

518
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:08,320
fight?

519
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,831
I don't know.

520
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:09,664
That first one,

521
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:10,831
that first one.

522
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,310
You got his ass whipped so bad.

523
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,690
How is the WWE like raging or is it?

524
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,030
That's why people are actually going,

525
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,730
so just that raw and the raw sewage,

526
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,770
which Fox has now,

527
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,140
which in a lot of people I
don't think they realize.

528
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,320
Fox decided to go with the
WWE instead of the UFC.

529
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:30,131
They turned down the,

530
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:33,700
you'll see and went with Doug Dob
and now they have the raw sewage,

531
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:36,730
which gets like three something
million viewers every time they it.

532
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,590
It's a built in audience.

533
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,653
It's crazy.

534
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,310
I always bet on dudes were Harry backs.

535
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,541
Yeah,

536
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:47,350
their testosterone's usually way higher
than everyone else's and he's going

537
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:47,711
bald,

538
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:48,550
so we're two for two.

539
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,470
He's got some fucking gorilla back.

540
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:51,970
Look at that shit.

541
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,410
Some Werewolf type shit,

542
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,760
but not hairy legs,

543
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:55,540
which is weird.

544
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:55,960
Yeah,

545
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,830
very strange.

546
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,551
There's not weird,

547
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:58,900
that's some weird hair placement.

548
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,660
Unless you say as a Bush trying
to slip out of Lego blocks.

549
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,360
Let's get his legs.

550
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:05,260
I'll shave down.

551
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,970
He's got a weird body though,

552
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,181
right?

553
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:07,331
Yeah,

554
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:07,491
right.

555
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:07,730
It's a,

556
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,590
it's interesting.

557
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,041
He's a kid.

558
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:09,874
He's a character.

559
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,691
If it goes to the ground,

560
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:11,530
homeboys in trouble,

561
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,173
good jab.

562
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,170
He's got a good jab.

563
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,870
We'll get that pop pop,

564
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:18,470
you know,

565
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,250
good range.

566
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,083
Oh,

567
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,413
[inaudible]

568
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:23,761
damps too.

569
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:24,430
Or just popped him.

570
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,520
Where's Stuart from yet?

571
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,630
A white flag.

572
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,560
It looked like a red cross
flag as country Dune.

573
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,750
Fulcan England.

574
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:33,800
Yeah.

575
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,161
The what?

576
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:35,600
Come on Scau slide.

577
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,463
I'm sorry,

578
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,850
I forgot that it was a Braveheart.

579
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,863
I forgot.

580
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,070
Braveheart.

581
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,710
Haven't seen Braveheart and 10 years.

582
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,663
That was Scotland,

583
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,880
Scotland for guys.

584
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,000
It's totally different country.

585
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,853
God Damn it.

586
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,721
Shit.

587
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,200
Okay.

588
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,430
It's still United Kingdom that it's true.

589
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,293
Good point.

590
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,130
Good point.

591
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:52,281
Yeah.

592
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:54,860
We were talking before the
podcast about how good high,

593
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,390
not too low.

594
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,870
Raj has a scouse

595
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,470
Liverpool accent.

596
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,170
It's fucking amazing.

597
00:15:01,171 --> 00:15:01,760
So good.

598
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,850
He's so talented.

599
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,770
Yours was good too.

600
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:05,000
The other night becomes so,

601
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,381
yeah,

602
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:07,200
you didn't till it's fucking good to him.

603
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,091
It was good.

604
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:08,750
That was high.

605
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:08,990
Yeah.

606
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,150
That's channeling super legit though.

607
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,180
I've done everything I can to prepare

608
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,660
a lot of pressure on the kid.

609
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:18,771
Yeah.

610
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:19,550
Well it's crazy.

611
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,960
If this is all going on,

612
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,460
as we heard that,

613
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,140
while his girlfriend is pregnant and
in the hospital and she's having issues

614
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,163
with the baby,

615
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,660
I can't imagine three down.

616
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,260
We've been through pregnancies
but was tearing to take them down.

617
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:33,650
Oh,

618
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,700
you just want a healthy baby.

619
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:35,810
That's the last thing I deal with.

620
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:36,350
Fight Week.

621
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:36,830
Exactly.

622
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,350
Goes.

623
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,840
Yeah.

624
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,600
Ooh,

625
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,111
maybe not.

626
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:41,840
Maybe not the same baby
mom or a different one.

627
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,381
We probably don't.

628
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:43,460
I have zero idea.

629
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,323
Did you sync up?

630
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,051
Did you,

631
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:47,330
do people know where we're at now?

632
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,640
Do we still have that?

633
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,430
Do we have a,

634
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,263
a uh,

635
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:51,670
uh,

636
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,280
a lot number on the screen and Jamie,

637
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,670
Jamie to hooks it up on the screen
now people are watching no type move.

638
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:01,990
Jamie fucking Jamie.

639
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,180
It's vibrant today cause it's
game seven of the calves.

640
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:05,850
He's all nervous.

641
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,321
I look at him,

642
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:08,430
he's got double C's on double C's,

643
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,683
whatever it takes.

644
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,360
He's got to catch up
and pray this morning.

645
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:15,890
Tammy for Lebron James Help,

646
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,790
he burnt some incense and shit.

647
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,230
I saw that three pointer that he did.

648
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:21,861
He hit like,

649
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:22,161
I dunno,

650
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:23,300
game six or something.

651
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,170
The game later,

652
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,420
they actually have something
interesting going on.

653
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:28,480
Never concussion protocol that's getting
one of their players out so I could,

654
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,180
a guy got hit in the head during the
game and he can't play until it goes

655
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:32,110
through like five to 10.

656
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:32,630
Yes.

657
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,630
He's missing the game because he's the
fucking basket for game seven k because

658
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,711
Ucla Guy.

659
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:39,670
But God man,

660
00:16:39,671 --> 00:16:41,470
the fuck up this coming from a fire him.

661
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,041
It's the league.

662
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:42,161
It's,

663
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:44,640
there's rules and it's not him.

664
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,041
It's not him.

665
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:45,874
It's the rules.

666
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,470
They do that for basketball.

667
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,260
Like some CTE and basketball

668
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,840
players that have had some problems
really ramp it like the NFL obviously,

669
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:58,510
but they get in trouble and they don't
want to be liable just like the NFL.

670
00:16:58,511 --> 00:16:59,344
They get.

671
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,270
Makes Sense.

672
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,103
Makes Sense.

673
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,021
Crazy though.

674
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:03,840
Huh?

675
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,310
The,

676
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,580
they're the last people you'd think that
would be putting people on the bench.

677
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:07,770
Oh,

678
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,121
I know.

679
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:09,080
So she came seven.

680
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:12,080
So what's going on with shit ESPN
deal like when does that start?

681
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,100
I don't know.

682
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,130
So you have C's gonna be on ESPN?

683
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:15,590
Yeah.

684
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,401
No more fox.

685
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:17,440
No more fast done.

686
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:18,501
No,

687
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:20,170
it finishes the end of this year.

688
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,700
The Fox and ESPN,

689
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:23,630
we're going to split it,

690
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,110
right?

691
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,441
Yeah.

692
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:27,080
And then fuck didn't want
to pay like the premium by,

693
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:27,861
I think it's better,

694
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:28,280
I think.

695
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,550
I think it was a home run for
the UFC man to land at ESPN.

696
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,020
It's,

697
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,371
you know,

698
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:34,700
it's as serious as it gets
as far as major sports.

699
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,500
It's on one network when it,

700
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,820
and also with ESPN,

701
00:17:37,821 --> 00:17:38,960
two of ESPN plus,

702
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:41,030
which we'll get some fight
nights and you have regular ESPN,

703
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:42,680
ESPN two with Fox.

704
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,270
Not that they didn't do a great job,

705
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,670
but it was off FXX fs to it.

706
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,421
Like fuck,

707
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:47,981
where is it,

708
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:48,450
where is it?

709
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,520
And announce on UFC fight
pass and out to here.

710
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,363
And it was just,

711
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,380
I think ESPN can learn from the mistakes
from Fox and just make it that much

712
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:55,890
better.

713
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,860
I think you're right about that because
there's been some times that I thought I

714
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,150
had my DVR set,

715
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,360
but then I get home and it was on fs one
I'm like mother fucker or sometimes be

716
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:05,300
like my bed or it's,

717
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,140
it's like my bat NASCAR's playing,

718
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:08,920
so go to FX x times.

719
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,590
Well fuck man.

720
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:14,530
Wears that hat or a baseball game goes
long and you've got to go to fs two.

721
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,230
Yes,

722
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,500
I to find it.

723
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,270
672 my,

724
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,810
my only concern on ESPN is because ESPN,

725
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:23,340
Aussie has the NFL has MBA.

726
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,863
How much,

727
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,880
how much focus do you even put on the UFC?

728
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,910
You know like we don't want to be the
side chick because they're made to the

729
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:30,271
NBA.

730
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,690
Nfl.

731
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,110
That's that.

732
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,771
That's their baby.

733
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:33,840
Are we the is the UFC
can be the side chick,

734
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,830
you know,

735
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,431
good point.

736
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't want,

737
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,430
but they've been putting on
some good boxing matches.

738
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,240
They had the law Marchenko Django
contracted Luma Chanko they had,

739
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,480
they had another really good fight
on recently check on my podcast.

740
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,620
It's coming up.

741
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,130
Ooh.

742
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:47,963
Yeah.

743
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:48,661
Aside for that,

744
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,560
I don't know how to English is,

745
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,394
but we'll figure it out.

746
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,091
Yeah,

747
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:51,790
I'm a,

748
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,280
they contacted me too.

749
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,060
Yeah.

750
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,380
I think I'm going to have mine as well.

751
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,220
Might as well.

752
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,053
Might as well.

753
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,110
I've got questions.

754
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,260
I got a lot of questions.

755
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,143
Yours first

756
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,320
make up my mind that like,

757
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,253
Ooh,

758
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,243
I'm flock.

759
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,310
SPN learn from my mistakes.

760
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,223
Get a translator.

761
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,470
It's sometimes it's like you think it'd
be a good idea to have somebody out,

762
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:17,490
but if you had them on like,

763
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,383
Ooh,

764
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,190
how long could you talk to them?

765
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,530
I know what it'd be for the
showtime below the TV show.

766
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:25,620
So it's only six minutes segment.

767
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,551
Yeah.

768
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:27,700
When you've had a,

769
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,920
you've had cyborg gone but you've had
around with her boyfriend or boyfriend

770
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,510
translates so well no,

771
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:34,440
her English is pretty good.

772
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:37,090
But if there's ever
issues so like take over,

773
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,680
you know,

774
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,450
like she'll explain it
and then it's a little,

775
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:39,961
I'm going to like,

776
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,070
I don't know what you're talking about.

777
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:41,310
Right.

778
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,420
And then told her to take over,

779
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,560
but it works great.

780
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,443
Yeah,

781
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:45,511
it's hard.

782
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:46,021
You know when,

783
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:46,771
when I had a year,

784
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:47,430
well we're on,

785
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,430
it was the best because Joey
was translating for Yo el
and so Joe it was dre was

786
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:54,600
great.

787
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,160
So fucking hard gig though.

788
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,920
Translate and translate nightmare.

789
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,650
I can't shut up.

790
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,960
Joined do it for all the fun.

791
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,451
I mean Eddie,

792
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:01,290
you speak Spanish.

793
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,490
You know how hard it is.

794
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,590
I barely speak Spanish.

795
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,790
You speak enough to talk to people.

796
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,833
We keep it light.

797
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:08,650
Yeah.

798
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,780
Soon as we get deep,

799
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,490
I'm lost Iranian,

800
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,650
they start real flowing fast.

801
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,121
My grandma,

802
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:15,954
when she started,

803
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,730
I was the first of the grandkids
to lose Spanish and uh,

804
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,950
felt really shameful because of that.

805
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:23,581
But man,

806
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:23,940
it was,

807
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,570
it was rare.

808
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,570
It was really embarrassing hanging out
with my grandmother and she's going off

809
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:28,110
and I'm like,

810
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,070
I don't know what she's saying.

811
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:30,490
I gotta look it over to my aunts.

812
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,191
I'm like,

813
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,030
what did she just say?

814
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,680
Very,

815
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,461
very embarrassed.

816
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:38,580
It's tough when you have a translator
because you don't get in that flow.

817
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,001
You know,

818
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:39,640
when you're a pot,

819
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:39,910
there's,

820
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,670
there's a flow and you're
like kind of connecting,

821
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,570
going back and forth.

822
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:42,910
We're,

823
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,010
if there's a translator,

824
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:46,080
just the chemistry is not there.

825
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,440
Right.

826
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,250
You don't have that fun kind of flow.

827
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,671
No,

828
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:50,230
but the one thing that is good though,

829
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:50,860
I,

830
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,640
what I find is that it allows you more
time to think about what you're going to

831
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:55,020
say.

832
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,940
Oh,

833
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,900
you heard them damn stewards.

834
00:20:58,901 --> 00:20:59,734
10 off.

835
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,281
Ooh,

836
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:01,480
spicy coming back.

837
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,280
But,

838
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,500
but sometimes when I have too much
time to think about the question,

839
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:05,890
I'm not,

840
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,191
you know,

841
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:06,830
I don't,

842
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,780
it's not as fun.

843
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,270
It's not as good sometimes organic.

844
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,270
Then I feel like,

845
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:10,720
uh,

846
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,100
like I worked for ESPN or something.

847
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:14,280
Like I know exactly what you talking
about and I don't want to be that.

848
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,163
Yeah,

849
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,731
yeah,

850
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:16,031
yeah,

851
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:16,301
yeah.

852
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:16,601
Right.

853
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:19,450
That's the hard part of like having
these conversations with people,

854
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:23,440
is it keeping them conversations and
not turning them into some corny ass

855
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:24,280
fucking interview.

856
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,740
The worst.

857
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,703
There's nothing worse,

858
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,910
but sometimes you have to do that if you,

859
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:28,470
if you can't,

860
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,220
like sometimes I feel myself was still,

861
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:31,790
she was so shit.

862
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,410
You got hurt.

863
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,020
Oh Damn.

864
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,383
That's it.

865
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,980
That Stuart was an underdog to in
this damn hit him with some bombs.

866
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,550
England coming and strung.

867
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:45,790
Yeah,

868
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,001
man.

869
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:46,781
I've watched those,

870
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:47,050
uh,

871
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:47,621
interviews.

872
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:47,721
Oh,

873
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:49,810
standard interviews now where,

874
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:50,170
you know,

875
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,950
there's no connection between the person
talking and the other person answering

876
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:55,720
the questions and there's so gross.

877
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:58,840
You know what I've done in this
conversation with a Ken Jong.

878
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,073
Yeah.

879
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,630
Yeah.

880
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,091
Doctor Ken,

881
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:01,781
who's amazing,

882
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:02,960
might be the guy in the world.

883
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,741
He's a sweetheart,

884
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:04,750
but he doesn't do a lot of it.

885
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,351
He's like,

886
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:05,951
podcasts,

887
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:06,191
really?

888
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:06,431
I'm like,

889
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:06,680
dude,

890
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,500
go and have your public set up Joe,

891
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:09,730
or something like the pockets is,

892
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,960
it's as big as it gets,

893
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:11,141
man.

894
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:11,650
He's like,

895
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,251
yeah,

896
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:13,090
Mike and I,

897
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:13,781
the example,

898
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:14,201
I gave him money.

899
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:14,501
He will say,

900
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:17,350
you went on tonight show and
you do a four minute segment.

901
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,363
You're going to have to,

902
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,420
you literally promoting whatever movie
or the standup your special coming out,

903
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,540
but that's all you're doing is promoting
and trying to get people to buy that.

904
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,080
That's not,

905
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,861
that's not real,

906
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:27,131
man.

907
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:27,791
That's not the real,

908
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:28,621
you know.

909
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:28,931
I mean,

910
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:29,764
we're talking like this.

911
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,551
If we film this,

912
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:33,230
people can be a fan of you
then buy whatever you can
be into or whenever you're

913
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:33,810
pitching.

914
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,170
It's a much better way to go.

915
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,370
There's no time limit.

916
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,540
There's no restrictions.

917
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,140
It's crazy that you never get,

918
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,750
there's no other place for that.

919
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,720
Like even Howard stern would
do interviews with people.

920
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:45,310
He would get people to say a lot of shit.

921
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:46,480
He had a agenda.

922
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,290
Yeah,

923
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:47,861
he had an agenda.

924
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:49,210
Howard stern had an agenda.

925
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:49,901
Typically.

926
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:50,734
Yeah.

927
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,180
Dirt out of your fucking yeah,

928
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,041
that was an agenda.

929
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:55,874
It's the agenda though.

930
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,351
He wouldn't,

931
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:58,120
he wasn't just having a
conversation with you.

932
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,040
He calls himself the dentist.

933
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,690
Okay,

934
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,523
good.

935
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,100
Did he fuck people's teeth?

936
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,140
Does he have nice to see a dentist?

937
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,130
We'll hope he has bad teeth.

938
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:06,850
He knocks.

939
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,110
He pulls people's teeth out.

940
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,330
It's hard for sure.

941
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,720
Um,

942
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,553
a terrible name.

943
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:13,631
Yeah.

944
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:15,670
Well it's already been taken to Josh neer.

945
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:15,961
Yeah,

946
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:16,750
I'm her mom bro.

947
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,410
Old School.

948
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,370
That's a great name.

949
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:23,280
Do the nox teeth out like
Josh near in my opinion.

950
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,830
He's a guy that hardcore fan.

951
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,420
You know who Josh neer is and Josh
neer has been around a long time.

952
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,360
Fans don't know him though,

953
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:32,260
so that goes dead.

954
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:33,580
Does so cool.

955
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,510
Still.

956
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,070
That's like calling
yourself hands of stolen.

957
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:36,850
If you're a boxer,

958
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,960
lay the fuck off.

959
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,550
That's Roberto Duran.

960
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,540
Fuck up.

961
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,630
I'm not saying that Josh neer is in
the same breath is Roberto Duran,

962
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,650
but still as a fan,

963
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:46,100
a fan

964
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,240
for a long time.

965
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:47,810
Yeah.

966
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,621
That's his nickname.

967
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:50,090
Someone had the hands of stone though.

968
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:52,630
Like sounds Lineker John Lineker.

969
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:53,901
What about,

970
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:56,960
what about a harmonic or or Sam Stout?

971
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,300
One of them steps stouts.

972
00:23:58,301 --> 00:23:58,580
Right.

973
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,413
He could call,

974
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,510
but so did so did a homeboy in strike
was the Kim over the UFC when he had the,

975
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,200
they almost had like the double knockout.

976
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,860
He hit a homeboy with a body
shot and they got knocked out.

977
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,581
Oh,

978
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:11,414
what's his name?

979
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,190
Scott Smith.

980
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,120
Scott Smith.

981
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,781
Hands the stones.

982
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:15,130
Right.

983
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:15,740
Had to steal,

984
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,573
steal,

985
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,473
steal.

986
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,523
There's a lot of that.

987
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,190
Yeah,

988
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,050
there's a lot of that going around you.

989
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,120
Some people just go hard,

990
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:25,880
but those fucking made up nicknames
and make them up for themselves and you

991
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,541
can't do that,

992
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:27,140
man.

993
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,940
You can't give yourself a nickname.

994
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,100
You just can't do that.

995
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,120
Like imagine if you're a kid,

996
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:36,700
you went to neighborhood and
just give yourself a nickname.

997
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:37,730
He kicked the fuck out of here.

998
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:38,564
We're calling you,

999
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:40,490
man.

1000
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:40,671
I'm,

1001
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:41,540
I'm the dark night.

1002
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:41,751
No,

1003
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:42,440
you're not.

1004
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:42,621
Well,

1005
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:44,480
that's what I like about Brazilians.

1006
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,550
Like they all have like silly nicknames,

1007
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:47,570
like shoe face,

1008
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,950
either our tree stump.

1009
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,490
Yeah.

1010
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:51,680
It's great fun nickname.

1011
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,523
Hell yeah.

1012
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,080
Calling you if you're,

1013
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:00,380
if it's 2018 and you just starting
out and you call yourself to pit bull,

1014
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,273
fuck off.

1015
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,830
Get the fuck out here.

1016
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,360
Some that are off limits.

1017
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,550
Is that the most common one
that might be on people's super.

1018
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,860
There's about seven pit
bulls and Bella tour.

1019
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,690
There's three in UFC at least.

1020
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,940
What is girls too?

1021
00:25:15,941 --> 00:25:16,220
Because look,

1022
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,450
there are other cool dogs.

1023
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,220
Isn't Jack Russell?

1024
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,940
That's the coolest one.

1025
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,810
Those who signed

1026
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,243
hunters.

1027
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,860
Have you ever seen that Netflix
documentary where they use Jack Russell

1028
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:32,000
terrorist to get rats?

1029
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:32,870
There you go.

1030
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,081
Yo.

1031
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:34,800
It's crazy to watch

1032
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,180
hour.

1033
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,371
No,

1034
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:37,461
no,

1035
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:37,730
no,

1036
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,001
no.

1037
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:38,811
The the doc.

1038
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:42,160
The all on how fucked up rats
are and how many have got you.

1039
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,730
You ever see that dude?

1040
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,760
It will free Jack
Russells to go after raps.

1041
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,623
Yeah.

1042
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,400
Jack Russells are so aggressive.

1043
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,590
Little terriers.

1044
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,080
It's one of the reasons why they're
so aggressive is because they're,

1045
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,110
they're constantly chasing
after these fucking rats.

1046
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,921
When they get them,

1047
00:25:57,921 --> 00:25:59,210
they tear these rats apart,

1048
00:25:59,211 --> 00:25:59,341
man.

1049
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:00,650
I look at that damn dude.

1050
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:02,150
Those are some Bushley dogs.

1051
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,710
That's a mix.

1052
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,050
The Jamie that this is
from the movies are,

1053
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,070
but these are some of them.

1054
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:10,250
These are all part Jack
Russell terriers in particular.

1055
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:12,500
One of the reasons why they're
so small and so aggressive,

1056
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,170
they would go into
holes and go after rats.

1057
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:15,911
Dude,

1058
00:26:15,911 --> 00:26:17,030
look at the blood on the back.

1059
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:19,760
Where the fuck are they of Michael Vick?

1060
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:20,091
Video,

1061
00:26:20,091 --> 00:26:20,924
dark place.

1062
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,160
But this documentary will
freak you the fuck out.

1063
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,830
There's more rats than there
are people in New York City.

1064
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,720
It's 30 million or 60
million rats or some shit.

1065
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,120
[inaudible] saying they have like all
sorts of diseases that everything that can

1066
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:35,954
kill you,

1067
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,910
they have all kinds of deadly shit.

1068
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,760
You just don't get it because most
people don't get bit by rats and they're

1069
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:41,480
smart.

1070
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,710
But we need rats though,

1071
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:42,921
right.

1072
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:43,080
Dot.

1073
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,920
They eat the trash.

1074
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,903
That's a good question.

1075
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,191
Do not,

1076
00:26:45,191 --> 00:26:45,751
can't we just,

1077
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:47,210
do they eat the trash can?

1078
00:26:47,211 --> 00:26:47,320
What?

1079
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,700
We just can't just breathe rats and you
throw them in the dump and just have

1080
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:51,061
them eat.

1081
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:51,894
I don't think they look like,

1082
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,760
I don't think they like fucking milk.

1083
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,591
Could this have,

1084
00:26:54,591 --> 00:26:55,424
okay,

1085
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,620
that's pretty heady.

1086
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,380
Bravos get a rat reading service releases.

1087
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:06,170
When the cans did you see drastic rat?

1088
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:06,691
Yeah,

1089
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,340
but now we've got to
get rid of the rat shit.

1090
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,840
Oh fuck dude.

1091
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,743
Pick it up.

1092
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,700
Use it as fertilizer.

1093
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:12,960
That can't be good for the dogs.

1094
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,720
Mami Minoa boom,

1095
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:16,320
boom,

1096
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,711
boom.

1097
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:17,880
Here's a fun hot minute.

1098
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,890
When did he fight last?

1099
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,760
He'd lost star.

1100
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,291
Did he?

1101
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,770
I thought he starched homeboy though.

1102
00:27:23,771 --> 00:27:24,604
The wrestler

1103
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,490
who?

1104
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:26,791
Oh,

1105
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:27,840
nor dean to lab.

1106
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,160
He's very good.

1107
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,030
That guy's good.

1108
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,360
He's a nasty he his knee Tristar.

1109
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:33,901
Yeah,

1110
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:34,231
he is.

1111
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:34,980
He looks at the,

1112
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,650
he looks at the guy with the roses
of mouth from Mike Tyson's punch out.

1113
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,200
Does he?

1114
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:44,210
Does he does Darren tills got
some prominent cheekbones,

1115
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:44,790
Huh?

1116
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,623
Yeah,

1117
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,670
but that's why he got that nickname.

1118
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:48,420
The gorilla.

1119
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,330
He looks like he's got at
least 5% in the end are tall.

1120
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,810
Do you think someone
gave him that nickname?

1121
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,530
The gorilla?

1122
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,363
Yeah,

1123
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,560
I hope so too.

1124
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,890
That bums me out when people give
themselves around and nothing worked.

1125
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,620
I call myself the gorilla.

1126
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,760
I hated,

1127
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,750
I hated my nickname,

1128
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,070
the twister so much.

1129
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,970
I hated that shit cause I
just sounds pretty homosexual.

1130
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:17,060
The twister because Higgin and John Jack
would always call me that because of

1131
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:18,500
the guilty.

1132
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,370
They called the rustlers
guilty and the twister,

1133
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,340
and I asked her,

1134
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,253
John and like,

1135
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,400
how do you say the twister
and Portuguese and goes total.

1136
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:26,911
Now they're like,

1137
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:26,971
oh,

1138
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:27,751
can you call me that?

1139
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:28,584
That sounds way better.

1140
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,893
Yeah,

1141
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,650
call me that sexy.

1142
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,880
They would never call me that.

1143
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:35,110
I kept calling and twister and it started,

1144
00:28:35,111 --> 00:28:35,770
it started,

1145
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,420
it started sounding good when I'd
compete and people would start yelling at

1146
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,110
Twitter.

1147
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,411
I thought,

1148
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:40,981
okay,

1149
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:41,341
okay.

1150
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:42,570
I think I like it now.

1151
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,710
I did get man taught her Nada torn.

1152
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,290
I just kept thinking of the game,

1153
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,060
the twister and the yellow
dots and the ground.

1154
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,910
Dot.

1155
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,190
Yeah.

1156
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,420
You should get a tattoo
that says El Toronado.

1157
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,340
Yes.

1158
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,750
Fucking never stop sticking right now.

1159
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,790
Now I'm going to call it that.

1160
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,280
That's way better than the twister.

1161
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,620
That's a great word.

1162
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,703
Sounds,

1163
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,990
sounds dangerous

1164
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,871
this summer.

1165
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,670
Toronado there you go.

1166
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,830
That would be a great license plate if
you could fit all those words torn on.

1167
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:13,664
Tornado,

1168
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:15,720
Tornado.

1169
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,780
It doesn't have no exact same.

1170
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,380
There's an a different tornado.

1171
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:22,591
No,

1172
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:24,520
there's Torah Nado Tornado.

1173
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,410
There's a,

1174
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,880
there's an a in there and English
is torn aid in Spanish is tornado.

1175
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:30,660
Is it?

1176
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,051
No,

1177
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:34,450
I'm just told that the aid.

1178
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,300
What I know I though
that's what makes it dope.

1179
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:36,841
But you can't,

1180
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:37,950
you can't pick your nickname.

1181
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,090
Like county called me big
brown for the longest.

1182
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:40,621
I'm like,

1183
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:42,190
why is it because you're
being fucking brown.

1184
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,053
That's just what,

1185
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,320
and then I would walk place.

1186
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:45,520
People would yell up big browns.

1187
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:45,890
Okay,

1188
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,490
well fuck that stock Greg Brown.

1189
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,630
That's a good nickname.

1190
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,920
Kind of fun.

1191
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:51,760
That's fine.

1192
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,240
Yeah.

1193
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:52,990
Yeah.

1194
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:53,500
That's good.

1195
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,880
The other one's name dope.

1196
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,260
Yeah.

1197
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,690
That's just from you.

1198
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:58,961
Yeah,

1199
00:29:58,961 --> 00:29:59,570
that's it.

1200
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,630
But even when you were doing taekwondo,

1201
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,590
no one gave you a nickname.

1202
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:02,920
No,

1203
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,580
Joe.

1204
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,120
No.

1205
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,680
When I was a playing pool a lot,

1206
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:10,090
I was Joe the comedian to GSP
with on you on the podcast.

1207
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:12,070
He just did on your turning sidekick.

1208
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,031
Holy Shit.

1209
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:14,090
Talk about endorses.

1210
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,820
Critiquing it as good for a half an
hour has gone on about his power is

1211
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:19,420
incredible.

1212
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,021
No Shit,

1213
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:20,530
George.

1214
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,311
Holy Shit.

1215
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:25,540
As GSP going off on Joe Rogan because
we trained a little afterwards.

1216
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,070
I switched my mats out.

1217
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,100
I had those a zebra mats that are super
smooth and no Bueno to slip at all.

1218
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,110
Dee Dee Dee on,

1219
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,180
on throwing kit DVD.

1220
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:39,590
Was it 1997 some sort of a video.

1221
00:30:39,591 --> 00:30:39,941
He was still,

1222
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:43,300
you know people still a na John
Danaher just put out a DVD.

1223
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,060
Well he put out a video series
that's Betty tied demand.

1224
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
I bet he paid

1225
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,560
wranglers in fucking under
Armour tops of course.

1226
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:54,460
But a DVD

1227
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,080
fanny pack game draw.

1228
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,700
Fanny pack.

1229
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,533
Yeah.

1230
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,650
Great points.

1231
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,250
Yeah I would uh,

1232
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,080
I would do that.

1233
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,830
George and I,

1234
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,663
we,

1235
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,220
we went over the front
leg side kick first,

1236
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:13,620
which is like the most important part.

1237
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,650
That attorney sidekick.

1238
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,630
Once you get the front leg side kick down,

1239
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:17,680
you understand how that works.

1240
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,820
Then you turn and then it's basically
you're turning and then throwing the front

1241
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:22,391
leg side kick.

1242
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:24,250
It's just got like an extra push to it.

1243
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,360
But most people do the front,

1244
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:27,250
like psychic rom there needs to low,

1245
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,211
it needs to low.

1246
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:29,110
You lose all the power.

1247
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,100
Crazy shit.

1248
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,110
You think you fight if he's
going to fight at 55 yeah,

1249
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:35,230
the ones that he's 100%
and he's only 185 pounds.

1250
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:39,760
She has paid 55 upset and he's only
doing it once and it's going to be the

1251
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:40,330
winner of Conor.

1252
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:40,960
Khabib,

1253
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,880
he started doing this.

1254
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,130
See,

1255
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:42,640
look at this.

1256
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,900
This is what Wonderboy does.

1257
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,230
It's,

1258
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,040
that's weird.

1259
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,890
That sideways stance is
hard to fuck with man.

1260
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,710
I used to spar with this
guy named Larry Jones.

1261
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,660
Larry Johns was this dude who was like,

1262
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:57,520
he was like six foot two but his
fucking legs went all the way up to his

1263
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,250
armpits,

1264
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,083
man.

1265
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,460
Cause that the guys who was standing in
front of the bag when you first walked,

1266
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:04,040
by that time,

1267
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,050
this John Lee,

1268
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,640
John's another tall dude,

1269
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,003
black dude,

1270
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,340
John [inaudible] was a beast that
could easily be a Chinese dude.

1271
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:12,581
Yeah,

1272
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:13,240
it could be.

1273
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,421
Yeah,

1274
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:13,961
if you heard it,

1275
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:18,930
but he was like six foot two
black as coal dad of a movie.

1276
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,360
Did you walking by that Taiwan?

1277
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,570
He just all bullshit,

1278
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:21,751
dude.

1279
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:23,560
That guy hit me so hard.

1280
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,200
I saw him flat and a lot
of people with that too.

1281
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,330
Um,

1282
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,800
but anyway,

1283
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:30,850
my friend Larry Jones,

1284
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,650
I was too short,

1285
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:32,891
you know,

1286
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:33,401
I'm five,

1287
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:34,810
eight when I would spar with him,

1288
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:36,440
my legs were normal leg,

1289
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,620
he was six,

1290
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,010
two and I just could
not get past that front

1291
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,290
leg side kick night man.

1292
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,200
That frontline psychic is so hard and
they can just move around with you.

1293
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:48,440
It's basically like a jab and
they can move around with you.

1294
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:48,891
You know,

1295
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:49,250
it's like,

1296
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,083
and they're safe.

1297
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,540
Yeah.

1298
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,880
You try and get an angle
trying to get an angle on them.

1299
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:58,150
There's actually a thing on hinge Zos
Instagram the other day we had a photo of

1300
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,590
him throwing a sidekick and he was
talking about Hixon like the sidekick best

1301
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:04,700
for Valley Tuto.

1302
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,450
Um,

1303
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,860
because you know,

1304
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,150
you never lost your base.

1305
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,740
Like if you throw a roundhouse kick,

1306
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,580
you throw the kid,

1307
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,600
you're standing around,

1308
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:12,230
you reset it.

1309
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,810
He was kind of throwing like
a front push kick sidekick.

1310
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,290
Yup.

1311
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:15,770
And he would,

1312
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,820
out of all the Gracies,

1313
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:20,930
it looked like Hixon through it with
the most power because the hoist would

1314
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:21,090
throw.

1315
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,190
But it didn't look powerful.

1316
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:23,024
But,

1317
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,160
but when you watch soccer,

1318
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,030
Robert too,

1319
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,390
when it was at the coliseum,

1320
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,880
but that's a forgotten fight.

1321
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,820
People Watch how hoist
would be on his back.

1322
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,520
And uh,

1323
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,180
in sac,

1324
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,400
rob was standing over him and he was like,

1325
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:35,000
purgatory.

1326
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,620
Sakharova standing hoists,

1327
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:39,200
throw side kicks off his back.

1328
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:40,910
Dude Harney Dude,

1329
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,530
better than anybody I've ever seen.

1330
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,740
He's on his side and he was throwing some
serious side kicks off his back little

1331
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:48,980
soccer and fucking up soc Robbins needs.

1332
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:54,190
I've never seen anybody remember Hixon
did that to finicky when Funai got Hixon

1333
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:58,040
down for knocky broke Hickson's orbital
people forget like that w that was

1334
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,370
Hickson's greatest victory because for
Nakia was the guy that when people were

1335
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:01,611
saying,

1336
00:34:01,611 --> 00:34:02,444
well,

1337
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,560
he's such a good grappler,

1338
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:04,700
if he went to the ground with Hixon,

1339
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,211
he could,

1340
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:06,560
he could actually hang with Hixon.

1341
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,900
But he cracked,

1342
00:34:07,901 --> 00:34:09,170
hits him with a big right hand,

1343
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:09,740
hurt him,

1344
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,490
fucked up as I broke his orbital
and they went to the ground.

1345
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,810
And as we knock you standing over
Hixson Hixson fucked his knees up.

1346
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,330
He fucked his Nisa with
side kicks off of his back.

1347
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,680
That's huge.

1348
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,281
Huge.

1349
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:23,990
And no one practices that shit.

1350
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:24,630
No,

1351
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,960
no practice.

1352
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:27,890
Hanzo,

1353
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,203
uh,

1354
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:33,530
would practice up kicks specifically just
just in case he was in that purgatory

1355
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,610
position where he got boom,

1356
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,010
it worked against old leg talk.

1357
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,311
Tara,

1358
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:38,144
remember that?

1359
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,300
That was the first upkick
versus Appkit Kale.

1360
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,490
And I think it was either,

1361
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:48,170
I think Merola Bustamonte did it to
Jerry Bolander or it was either Fabio's

1362
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:48,680
years yelled at,

1363
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,490
but Bolando or Bustamante
to Belinda up kick boom.

1364
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,150
Took 'em out.

1365
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,780
Bam.

1366
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,050
You know,

1367
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:54,591
love Kickstarter.

1368
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:56,480
Now legal and combat Jujitsu.

1369
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,800
Their legal,

1370
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,610
yes,

1371
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,980
called little shit.

1372
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,000
How hard was that to get?

1373
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,140
Um,

1374
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,440
you know what an amateur MMA
upp kicks or illegal gay guard.

1375
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:06,631
You know what?

1376
00:35:06,631 --> 00:35:07,400
I'm Sassy.

1377
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,740
Amateur MMA UPP kicks your legal,

1378
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,710
we added them to combat you just because
guys are getting too comfortable in

1379
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:13,544
purgatory,

1380
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,930
just standing over guys.

1381
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:17,450
They didn't want to go into anybody's
guard that could kill the show.

1382
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,890
So now with the threat,

1383
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,720
it's really easy to deal with uptake.

1384
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:22,940
So all they gotta do is just get
to their knees and start passing.

1385
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:23,710
You gotta engage.

1386
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:23,870
Yeah.

1387
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,980
Just engage if all you get,

1388
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,100
because you rarely see up kicks in Nma
rarely because they're so easy to deal

1389
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:30,920
with.

1390
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,410
But the threat of them will keep you,

1391
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,680
I'll either away from purgatory
or get on your knees and,

1392
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:38,040
and

1393
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,120
commenced to passing.

1394
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,380
That's what it's all about.

1395
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,150
You about to say Musashi Gray.

1396
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,541
Yeah.

1397
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,460
He knocked out jocker right.

1398
00:35:43,461 --> 00:35:44,530
Where that triangle choke though.

1399
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,690
You fell into a triangle.

1400
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,980
There's been probably,

1401
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:51,450
I would say see Roy McDonald door
like seven total up kicks it history,

1402
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:52,380
something like that.

1403
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,083
Adding,

1404
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,810
we're not adding up kicks to
combat Jujitsu to increase chaos.

1405
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,970
We're adding it to increase the ground.

1406
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:00,270
Fine.

1407
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:00,580
Yeah.

1408
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,200
Just says,

1409
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,260
don't stand over the guidance.

1410
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:03,483
Let's go.

1411
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,021
Yeah,

1412
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:04,651
let's get to that.

1413
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:05,240
Smart.

1414
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:05,960
Super Smart.

1415
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,410
Yeah.

1416
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:06,710
Yeah.

1417
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,190
I Love Combat Jujitsu.

1418
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:09,210
I love the rule set.

1419
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,500
I love what it does.

1420
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,700
It opens up,

1421
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:11,890
uh,

1422
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,120
the,

1423
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,470
the reality aspect.

1424
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,900
Do you understand that you
can't just do certain things.

1425
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:17,580
You're going to get
smacked in the face hard.

1426
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,110
It keeps your Jujitsu honest.

1427
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:19,650
That's it.

1428
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,910
Don't get too crazy,

1429
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,391
dude.

1430
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:23,490
I forgot the Holly Holm
versus Megan Anderson.

1431
00:36:23,491 --> 00:36:24,324
Yeah,

1432
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,490
that's a barn burner.

1433
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,540
Oh yeah.

1434
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:28,890
It's a big fight for Anderson.

1435
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:32,190
Is her her first shot at
the UFC and his right away.

1436
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,043
Holly Holm.

1437
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,870
Is there a need because they
could give Cyborg a match.

1438
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,620
A good,

1439
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,453
good competition.

1440
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,373
Ryerson.

1441
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,453
Uriah favor.

1442
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,120
Favor.

1443
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,170
If there's not a woman who's
going to give her any challenge?

1444
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,460
Uriah family,

1445
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:44,730
right?

1446
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,040
Would it be illegal for
Cyborg to find a man?

1447
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,520
No.

1448
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:47,701
No.

1449
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:49,140
It's [inaudible] movement.

1450
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,230
What are you talking about?

1451
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,093
You know what I'm saying?

1452
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,240
It has nothing to do with that.

1453
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:57,590
No.

1454
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,440
May choose about sexual assault credit.

1455
00:36:59,480 --> 00:36:59,940
No.

1456
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,840
I know brother,

1457
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,290
and I'm not saying you're a fever,

1458
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:02,880
did that,

1459
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,610
but you paint this story market.

1460
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,550
She comes out with me too.

1461
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,070
It just beats the shit out of the
dualism of gallons in her corner

1462
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,900
in the secondary [inaudible] comes out
of the floor right behind the smoke.

1463
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,580
Cm pumps five.

1464
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:18,414
My main event.

1465
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,520
Cm punk against Cyborg.

1466
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:21,430
That would be great.

1467
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:22,264
That's what I said.

1468
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,070
No,

1469
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,390
I said that before.

1470
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,190
Shake or not,

1471
00:37:26,191 --> 00:37:26,760
bro.

1472
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,630
What would she do to him?

1473
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,550
She would knock his head off fucking,

1474
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,570
I mean it was like a cartoon.

1475
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,900
Just weren't you guys saying
that guys could never,

1476
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:40,803
uh,

1477
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,510
at an MMA fighter could,

1478
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,230
uh,

1479
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,490
would always beat a girl.

1480
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:44,790
Right.

1481
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,940
One just sent out when we're talking
about Ronda Rousey back in the day that

1482
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:48,091
can,

1483
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:51,060
Ronda Rousey said that he said
Ronnie can beat Mike Tyson,

1484
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,613
Mike Tyson.

1485
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,780
He got shit for them.

1486
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:01,800
But you know,

1487
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,840
when the flying arm bar maybe no,

1488
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,060
you'd still a slammer the gun today.

1489
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:06,930
He was like 50.

1490
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:07,591
Yeah,

1491
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:09,000
I did a podcast and was rough.

1492
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,380
She would be his ass right now.

1493
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:10,680
But,

1494
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,490
um,

1495
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,860
I think the rough as he is he doing bad,

1496
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,470
uh,

1497
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,211
not doing bad.

1498
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:15,511
It's just,

1499
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:15,791
you know,

1500
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:16,230
when you,

1501
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,830
especially as me growing up with,

1502
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:18,661
with Mike Tyson,

1503
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:20,100
you think they say never meet your heroes.

1504
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:20,251
You know,

1505
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:21,060
so it's like,

1506
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,810
I think of him as that Mike
Tyson and my head went on.

1507
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,660
Then when I saw him,

1508
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,100
you know,

1509
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,870
he had sweats on and some white
new balances and you know,

1510
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,630
he's out of shape or fashion.

1511
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,430
What's running new balance right away?

1512
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:32,730
You're like,

1513
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,020
is fashions off?

1514
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,140
We'll do this on Sunday
afternoon leisure time,

1515
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:39,910
like it's the middle of
the was on your podcast.

1516
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,200
He's on his,

1517
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,940
Larry is with your fashion.

1518
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,230
You really give a fuck.

1519
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:45,770
They sweat sweatpants,

1520
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,810
show respect.

1521
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,640
What is it with you in fashion
that makes no sense to them.

1522
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,350
I would have never brought it up.

1523
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,420
Him wearing sweatpants and
new balance and be like,

1524
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:55,571
yeah,

1525
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:56,410
he wants to be comfortable.

1526
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,131
Really?

1527
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:57,740
Yeah.

1528
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,460
It's no,

1529
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,470
I don't show your pride.

1530
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,860
It's like I saw a,

1531
00:39:01,861 --> 00:39:02,550
I don't get it.

1532
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,410
It's like I saw Bret Hart in Calgary
and I go out and they're like,

1533
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:08,290
he's in the front row and I go out
there and he's in matching sweatsuit.

1534
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:09,130
Tuck the bottom of thought.

1535
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,231
Fuck Bro.

1536
00:39:10,231 --> 00:39:11,410
It's Saturday night,

1537
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:11,990
man.

1538
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,880
You have my show.

1539
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:13,121
Wait,

1540
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:13,301
wait,

1541
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:13,690
wait.

1542
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,480
He's in Canada and he's
a former pro wrestler,

1543
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:16,870
right?

1544
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,090
Yeah.

1545
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:17,850
He talking about,

1546
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,370
yeah.

1547
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,203
Okay.

1548
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,290
He's in Canada.

1549
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,630
That's like a three piece suit up there.

1550
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,223
What are you doing?

1551
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,770
What are you doing Saturday night?

1552
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,480
Said you're out on the town.

1553
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:29,370
Can we sweat?

1554
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,850
So they,

1555
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,900
that's how they roll up there.

1556
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,691
They just happy.

1557
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:33,160
It's not 150 below zero.

1558
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,901
They're very happy.

1559
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:37,350
They weren't something nice
and light judge people though,

1560
00:39:37,351 --> 00:39:37,570
man.

1561
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,740
Probably a nice sweat suit.

1562
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,603
Right?

1563
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,100
Like the McGregor matching grace,

1564
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:42,431
you know,

1565
00:39:42,431 --> 00:39:45,580
and then the white ten one with
that fuck is wrong with that.

1566
00:39:45,581 --> 00:39:46,810
Looks still looks fresh.

1567
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,103
Your fucking

1568
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,453
dude.

1569
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,680
I have terrible fashion.

1570
00:39:53,681 --> 00:39:54,161
You can't listen.

1571
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:54,821
You don't though.

1572
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:55,750
You Have Gi Joes,

1573
00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:57,340
a nice shirt yet your fanny pack,

1574
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:58,720
fanny packs are back in the game.

1575
00:39:58,721 --> 00:39:59,550
That brought that shit.

1576
00:39:59,550 --> 00:39:59,891
Come on.

1577
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:01,780
I want her back.

1578
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,260
I want 10% of the credit from,

1579
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,390
should I just post this thing on high?

1580
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,930
Might have more than 10%
of the credit I'm being,

1581
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,860
I'm being humble.

1582
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,790
You're,

1583
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,570
you're the guy who I know who's right or
die about fanny packs and then cro cop

1584
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:14,404
still fucks with it,

1585
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:18,010
but he's on of where and how big of
an impact he and I had to Croatia.

1586
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,240
They don't know what time it is.

1587
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,710
They all wear fanny packs,

1588
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,460
you know.

1589
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:21,851
Yo Dude,

1590
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:25,590
I wore fanny packs back in the
90s now you're ever stopped?

1591
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:25,710
Yeah.

1592
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,980
Your first team all fanny pack.

1593
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:31,270
Damn nor deep to labs going off
up and slap the shit out of him.

1594
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:31,970
Yeah.

1595
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:32,081
No,

1596
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:33,010
he's good man.

1597
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,390
Nor Dean's very good.

1598
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,460
I never stopped with a fanny pack.

1599
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:36,611
No,

1600
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:37,750
you just ride through it even.

1601
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,110
Yeah.

1602
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,730
People were like to chose
fanny pack and like,

1603
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:40,564
I know man,

1604
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,060
this shit on saw the shit out of him.

1605
00:40:46,061 --> 00:40:47,080
I'm always out of stock.

1606
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,620
My boy wants one bad hire.

1607
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,350
I made.com we were at Disneyland.

1608
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,660
Are we close to MMA and the Olympics?

1609
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,190
Yeah.

1610
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,023
Yeah we are.

1611
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,130
Holy Shit.

1612
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:55,960
They're working on it.

1613
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,081
Yeah,

1614
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:57,760
they're trying to imagine that.

1615
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,640
Well it would be,

1616
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,480
I can't imagine.

1617
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,270
It would be amazing now with Russia,

1618
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:04,020
just when all the belts are they,

1619
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,571
what about,

1620
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:06,010
we had some seconds man.

1621
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,570
Fucking situation.

1622
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,820
I mean Russia would be tough man.

1623
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,970
Woe and it really depends
entirely drug testing.

1624
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,290
But they'll figure it out.

1625
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,650
I mean Russians when it comes,

1626
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:16,871
you know,

1627
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:18,130
box and combat sports.

1628
00:41:18,131 --> 00:41:22,450
Russia is really pretty fucking good
with Dagestan be considered Russia.

1629
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,940
But the thing is though is what I
was putting it under the same banner.

1630
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,540
Yeah.

1631
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,261
But the thing is,

1632
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:30,070
what would happen is if it did
become huge in the Olympics,

1633
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,420
then people would realize like,

1634
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:36,410
you know how guys like Floyd Mayweather
and also many different professional

1635
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:40,760
boxers got their start as a Olympic
gold medalist and then went on to become

1636
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,680
these huge superstars in boxing.

1637
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,300
Loma Chanko is another good example.

1638
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,630
When you have like a real
great amateur background,

1639
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:50,900
people get super amped
up for go pro Andre Ward.

1640
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,590
Yeah.

1641
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:51,921
Anthony.

1642
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:52,420
Joshua.

1643
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,253
Yup.

1644
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,720
You get super amped up about seeing
those guys go pro in America.

1645
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,620
It's a little different though,

1646
00:41:57,621 --> 00:41:59,390
for the reason when it comes to boxing.

1647
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah.

1648
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,130
Because we talked the other can.

1649
00:42:01,131 --> 00:42:05,390
We used to with Mark Breland member
of those days with a Tyrrell pigs.

1650
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,410
We used to love it.

1651
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,020
We used to love it when a
guy was a Olympic gold metal.

1652
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:09,854
Pernell Whitaker,

1653
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,990
you know Ray Mercer?

1654
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,640
Yeah.

1655
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,610
Let Andre Ward though.

1656
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:14,031
It's still,

1657
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:14,241
you know,

1658
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:15,820
and he looked in this leg lock

1659
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,100
Giante Walter has a bronze medal.

1660
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:22,600
This was Shane and he started
sad moods or boxing like toilet.

1661
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:23,840
Oh Shit.

1662
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,870
Anytime he hit them double
outside [inaudible] and MMA,

1663
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,340
they're risky.

1664
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,260
What such a weird position
to find yourself in.

1665
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:33,410
If a guy can punch in the face and again
it goes back to your combat Jujitsu,

1666
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:34,400
all Monta.

1667
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,500
Yep.

1668
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,790
It goes back to your combat Jujitsu.

1669
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,860
You understand what positions are like
super dangerous cause there's positions

1670
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:44,861
that guys regularly practice in Jujitsu
that will get you fucked up if a guy can

1671
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:45,794
punch you in the face.

1672
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,580
Exactly.

1673
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,480
That's what it's all about.

1674
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,400
Combat Jujitsu is such a good idea.

1675
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:50,250
Thank you man.

1676
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,950
And so and is going well,

1677
00:42:51,951 --> 00:42:52,784
right Eddie,

1678
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:54,700
before he accepted,

1679
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:55,370
does it,

1680
00:42:55,370 --> 00:43:00,370
does the UFC being acquired by ESPN
affect the fight pass in smash cars?

1681
00:43:01,701 --> 00:43:03,740
Are they going to continue
with the fight pass?

1682
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:04,310
Oh hell yeah.

1683
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:05,143
Hell are you sure?

1684
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,410
As a matter of fact,

1685
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,860
the president of fight pass
when that deal went through,

1686
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:10,990
emailed me personally,

1687
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:11,903
let me know.

1688
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:12,261
He goes,

1689
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:12,920
listen,

1690
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,340
this is,

1691
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,990
this deal has nothing to
look at this game over.

1692
00:43:16,991 --> 00:43:18,650
So body triangle,

1693
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,751
each deep,

1694
00:43:19,751 --> 00:43:20,180
deep,

1695
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:20,601
deep,

1696
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:21,170
deep hat.

1697
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,700
Can you hang in there for 40 seconds?

1698
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:23,421
I don't think so.

1699
00:43:23,421 --> 00:43:23,901
Sign though.

1700
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:24,734
He's in trouble.

1701
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:25,790
He's got a,

1702
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:28,190
he's got and he's tapping
into about the tap?

1703
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:28,491
No,

1704
00:43:28,491 --> 00:43:29,324
it's on the chin.

1705
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,280
Oh he's out.

1706
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:31,881
What's broke?

1707
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:32,330
His jaw.

1708
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,121
Damn.

1709
00:43:33,121 --> 00:43:33,954
Yeah.

1710
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,030
That's what they said.

1711
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:39,500
Your boy problem you'd have to worry
about is now that people don't have to

1712
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:40,460
subscribe to ESPN.

1713
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:43,160
Plus you get the full ESPN experience.

1714
00:43:43,161 --> 00:43:43,551
Now they're,

1715
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:46,310
you have to pay for that and fight paths.

1716
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,203
Is that real?

1717
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,383
That's real.

1718
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:52,320
So fipass doesn't really change it or
they're not getting rid of bypass at all?

1719
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,740
I don't like getting rid of as far
as it grows and could be an issue.

1720
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,120
I think the fan base stays.

1721
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:57,080
How does that work though?

1722
00:43:57,081 --> 00:43:59,180
They're gonna stream some
fights still on fight pass.

1723
00:43:59,240 --> 00:43:59,850
No.

1724
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:00,320
Well that's,

1725
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,153
I don't think so.

1726
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,860
What do you mean ESPN is going
to take all that content?

1727
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:06,320
Cause cause you have,

1728
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:11,300
right cause now ESPN plus and ESPN
platforms can have 30 fights than ESPN is

1729
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:12,800
going to have 12 paper use at least.

1730
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:14,150
So we have 42 fights a year now.

1731
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,680
So there's no,

1732
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:16,401
I couldn't be wrong.

1733
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:17,001
Jamie car,

1734
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:17,834
if I'm wrong,

1735
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,430
there's no fight pass card.

1736
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:20,264
I don't think so.

1737
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,140
I think he's just gonna be a database
for stuff like Eddie's old school fight

1738
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:25,820
libraries and then you know,

1739
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:26,950
that's what took her show.

1740
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:27,850
So.

1741
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,540
So I don't think it's going to grow.

1742
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,460
I think it's going to continue.

1743
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,090
It's doing and stuff like Eddie's

1744
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:32,701
might grow,

1745
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:37,500
but people are mean honestly
more ESPN plus packaging.

1746
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,610
Tough sell because I love it.

1747
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,780
I think five passes.

1748
00:44:40,781 --> 00:44:41,141
Awesome.

1749
00:44:41,141 --> 00:44:44,170
And if you want to just go old school
and watch a bunch of great old fights is

1750
00:44:44,171 --> 00:44:46,360
the best format on the planet earth.

1751
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,280
If you're a hardcore fan,

1752
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:48,190
if you're a hardcore fan.

1753
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,830
But I liked the fact that
we would have the prelims,

1754
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,660
some fights that you
couldn't see anywhere else,

1755
00:44:52,661 --> 00:44:55,810
but fight pass and then they would
have certain fight pass cards.

1756
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,560
Well you wouldn't,

1757
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,670
how many times did we watch?

1758
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:58,870
Do fight companions?

1759
00:44:58,871 --> 00:44:59,070
Yeah,

1760
00:44:59,070 --> 00:44:59,940
with the entire car.

1761
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,190
But now you can do it on these two up.

1762
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,063
Look at that shit.

1763
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:02,690
That is nothing.

1764
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:04,350
I can do it on ESPN plus Joe.

1765
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:04,830
Yeah,

1766
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:05,330
could be.

1767
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,163
Could be.

1768
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,930
Plus is that okay?

1769
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,833
Fine.

1770
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,650
For another thing online,

1771
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,000
it's digital.

1772
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:12,834
Espn pluses,

1773
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,883
digital APP.

1774
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:14,730
Eddie,

1775
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:14,930
what?

1776
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:16,560
What could he same is get out of this.

1777
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,090
What can you do to get out of this?

1778
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:18,924
Eddie?

1779
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,940
He's got appeal that arm off his neck

1780
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,690
too late at this point,

1781
00:45:24,691 --> 00:45:25,010
right?

1782
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:25,310
I mean,

1783
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:26,580
get an answer to that spot.

1784
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:28,783
A couple of things.

1785
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,990
You got to protect your neck obviously,

1786
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,350
and then he's got to get up to the leg
press position where he could get up on

1787
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:34,591
like,

1788
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,730
it's just doing a leg press,

1789
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:39,930
pushing back that it relieves some of
the pressure and then eventually get over

1790
00:45:39,931 --> 00:45:44,190
to the side of the [inaudible] triangle
and try to break that shit apart.

1791
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:44,780
Yeah.

1792
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,600
You gotta break those body is a part to
move fast to prevent them from happening

1793
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:49,231
in the first place.

1794
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:50,940
You've got to be soon as
someone takes your back.

1795
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:54,510
First thing is don't let it
get too deep and by two deep,

1796
00:45:54,511 --> 00:45:55,530
that means body trying,

1797
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,131
you know,

1798
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:57,180
don't let that shit happen.

1799
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:57,961
What were you gonna say,

1800
00:45:57,961 --> 00:45:58,794
Jamie?

1801
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,593
Uh,

1802
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,280
the ESPN deals us only,

1803
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:02,880
it says,

1804
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,970
so that'd be for us broadcast only at
five past is still for the rest of the

1805
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:06,500
world.

1806
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,333
Hmm.

1807
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,340
That'd be the big difference.

1808
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,081
Globally.

1809
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:10,890
They assured me,

1810
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:11,671
I didn't even ask.

1811
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:12,001
They just said,

1812
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:12,300
dude,

1813
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,133
don't even trip.

1814
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:13,830
I don't,

1815
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:13,951
here.

1816
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:14,784
They sent me,

1817
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,200
they sent me an email saying,

1818
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,220
don't worry about it.

1819
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:17,880
Uh,

1820
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,380
we,

1821
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:18,581
we're,

1822
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:20,300
we're not getting rid of Ebi.

1823
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:20,700
We,

1824
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,600
we'd love you.

1825
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:21,930
It's,

1826
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:22,280
it's,

1827
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:22,950
you know,

1828
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:23,970
don't even trip.

1829
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:24,301
Sure.

1830
00:46:24,301 --> 00:46:24,590
That's right.

1831
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:25,030
Raise,

1832
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:25,680
um,

1833
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,630
did and so that means,

1834
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:30,870
and so in America it's just going
to affect fight pass in the UFC.

1835
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,640
Everyone else,

1836
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,473
they're good to go.

1837
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,220
But also they,

1838
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,310
there's no really paper views outside.

1839
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,090
Internationally.

1840
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:36,960
They get it for free.

1841
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:40,291
Like in Brazil,

1842
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:40,511
all the,

1843
00:46:40,511 --> 00:46:41,490
all the stuff's free.

1844
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:42,840
There's no paper use in Brazil,

1845
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:44,131
right?

1846
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:45,180
They're watching on global.

1847
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:45,331
Yeah.

1848
00:46:45,331 --> 00:46:46,021
They get it all free.

1849
00:46:46,021 --> 00:46:46,854
It's right there.

1850
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,840
ESPN broadcast deal that includes 10
full UFC cards or primary ESPN channels,

1851
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:54,591
uh,

1852
00:46:54,591 --> 00:46:56,690
on primary USP ESPN channels.

1853
00:46:56,691 --> 00:46:57,231
ESPN,

1854
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:02,231
ESPN two along with the premium prelims
for a dozen UFC paper view events,

1855
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,860
another 25 cards.

1856
00:47:03,861 --> 00:47:08,720
We'll stream on ESPN plus totaling
30 full events annually between ESPN

1857
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,370
broadcasted streaming outlets.

1858
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:14,480
All full fight cards are expected
to have 12 bouts addition,

1859
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:18,980
additional and shoulder UFC programs
such as Dana White's contender series,

1860
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:24,470
a new all access series and pre and post
fight shows and more are also included

1861
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:25,340
in the deal.

1862
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:25,521
Oh,

1863
00:47:25,521 --> 00:47:26,354
that's interesting.

1864
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:29,100
10 tough has done so cap has done tough.

1865
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:29,771
Tough has done.

1866
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:30,010
From my

1867
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,401
understanding.

1868
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:34,240
So did the Dana White's contender shoes
was going to kind of be the focus now?

1869
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,550
What's the,

1870
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:35,011
why would you,

1871
00:47:35,011 --> 00:47:35,770
I think that's good.

1872
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,300
It's tough is a dying person,

1873
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:37,720
man.

1874
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,690
Those dudes stay in that house for
six weeks and all that crazy shit.

1875
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,201
I don't like it.

1876
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:41,860
Who you tone.

1877
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,580
So they have,

1878
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,520
so even with DC and steep bay who are,

1879
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:44,890
you know,

1880
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,090
light heavyweight champion of the world,

1881
00:47:46,091 --> 00:47:46,924
heavyweight champ of the world,

1882
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,940
those then you get the
insight on those guys.

1883
00:47:48,941 --> 00:47:50,320
Even those ratings suck Dick.

1884
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,430
It's just not going well.

1885
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:53,180
It's 27 seasons deed.

1886
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:54,610
It's a tired format.

1887
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:54,821
Yeah.

1888
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:56,020
Everyone's just over and no more,

1889
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,310
no stars come from anymore.

1890
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:57,491
No.

1891
00:47:57,491 --> 00:47:58,120
What's it called out?

1892
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,110
Your series is great.

1893
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:00,070
Contender series is good.

1894
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:03,210
Sean O'malley came from Greg
Hardy fighting on there.

1895
00:48:03,211 --> 00:48:03,690
You got some.

1896
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:04,720
Who is that guy that knocked out?

1897
00:48:04,721 --> 00:48:06,490
Thiago Alves didn't he
come from there as well?

1898
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:09,030
I'm I wrong about that.

1899
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,240
I'm not sure.

1900
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,010
The biggest one is Sean O'malley,

1901
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:15,460
but then you're going to have a homeboy.

1902
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:16,450
Why am I forgetting his name?

1903
00:48:16,451 --> 00:48:16,991
Sorry Dude.

1904
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:17,670
The guy with the,

1905
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,760
the with the arm.

1906
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:19,690
Come on,

1907
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:19,901
Nick.

1908
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:20,111
No,

1909
00:48:20,111 --> 00:48:22,390
Nick Newell is finally Fight Win Streak.

1910
00:48:22,391 --> 00:48:23,224
Holy Shit.

1911
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,060
Nick knew it was going to beat the shit.

1912
00:48:26,061 --> 00:48:26,851
These people on the contender,

1913
00:48:26,851 --> 00:48:28,120
so he should not be on there.

1914
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,140
You don't think so?

1915
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:29,501
God,

1916
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:29,770
no.

1917
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:31,180
What'd you take you for a world title?

1918
00:48:31,181 --> 00:48:31,460
Again?

1919
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,200
Just engaging,

1920
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,210
but it's good to get him exposure.

1921
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,410
Let people know how good it is.

1922
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:37,960
I guess it depends how
many people are watching.

1923
00:48:37,961 --> 00:48:38,794
Contender shoes.

1924
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,010
You got some real
potential talent out there.

1925
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,010
I think the real thing about what's
interesting about the contender series is

1926
00:48:45,011 --> 00:48:47,860
now people you'd never
heard of are very good.

1927
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:48,611
I mean,

1928
00:48:48,611 --> 00:48:51,130
how many people do we know
that are just guys in the gym?

1929
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:51,731
They're like,

1930
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:52,001
dude,

1931
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:54,850
that guy's fucking good and
they've never bought a break.

1932
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,000
They never fought or they've had one
amateur fight or something like that.

1933
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:01,420
But you realize like when you see
them roll with like really good guys,

1934
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:02,254
like Holy Shit,

1935
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,580
this guy's like just a hair
below a worldclass level.

1936
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:10,090
There's so many guys like that
because it's one of those doors.

1937
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:10,781
No,

1938
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:10,841
no,

1939
00:49:10,841 --> 00:49:10,971
no.

1940
00:49:10,971 --> 00:49:11,804
And that's not what I'm saying.

1941
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:16,000
He has the potential to face one of
those guys in the contender series.

1942
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:16,840
Let's see.

1943
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,680
I almost think it,

1944
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,000
it's it.

1945
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:20,440
That's the opposite of
what they should be doing.

1946
00:49:20,441 --> 00:49:21,760
Because I found my young dude,

1947
00:49:21,761 --> 00:49:24,880
I'm trying to get my break in and I'm
on the contender seas and he'd give me

1948
00:49:24,881 --> 00:49:27,640
nick news 17 five to 17 in one,

1949
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:27,970
right.

1950
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:28,810
Fuck man.

1951
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:32,200
Why can't I find a young guy in this
coming from guy who had three fights?

1952
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,101
Roy Nelson,

1953
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:33,820
the finale.

1954
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,300
That's true.

1955
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:34,541
I was like,

1956
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:35,470
what do you want to blow up?

1957
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:36,520
You gotta you gotta fight.

1958
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:37,541
That's true.

1959
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:41,290
It's not like they're fighting
the UFC world champion.

1960
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:41,670
You know,

1961
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:42,503
you gotta,

1962
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,290
you gotta go in there and are
finding that concentration saying,

1963
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:47,921
I see what you're saying.

1964
00:49:47,921 --> 00:49:49,300
It should be a lower crossover.

1965
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:49,511
Yeah.

1966
00:49:49,511 --> 00:49:50,380
For someone there can be like,

1967
00:49:50,381 --> 00:49:50,591
dude,

1968
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,251
I get fucking,

1969
00:49:51,251 --> 00:49:52,420
I draw Nick Newell.

1970
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,890
Sean O'malley was fighting,

1971
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:54,641
guys have his same,

1972
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:56,890
similar blew it up just
knocking dudes out.

1973
00:49:56,891 --> 00:49:57,760
Now he's a stop out.

1974
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,980
Maybe it'll be like one or two fights
and then they'll get nick in the UFC.

1975
00:50:00,981 --> 00:50:01,601
It should be one.

1976
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:02,450
So they're familiar with and then,

1977
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,793
yeah,

1978
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:05,140
but he,

1979
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:05,451
he's,

1980
00:50:05,451 --> 00:50:06,520
he's gonna be tough man.

1981
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:06,990
If he,

1982
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:07,201
if he,

1983
00:50:07,201 --> 00:50:09,880
if he gets into that division
can be tough to beat a lot of,

1984
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,110
it's an inspiring story too.

1985
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:11,590
I don't,

1986
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:11,950
I would,

1987
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:13,530
I would market the shit out with that man.

1988
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:13,870
Yeah.

1989
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,520
I think they're worried
that if he gets head kick,

1990
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:17,560
which he's never been knocked
out from the head kick,

1991
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,120
they're worried with his arm.

1992
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,170
If you can't defend it,

1993
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:21,610
he gets brutally knocked out.

1994
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:22,120
Right.

1995
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:22,690
How would you,

1996
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,180
how can you put that guy on TV
where you got to realize too,

1997
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,830
think about how much your arm weighs.

1998
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:27,943
Like,

1999
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:28,010
I

2000
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,410
mean it's not an advantage by
any stretch of the imagination,

2001
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,050
but the rest of him is bigger and heavier.

2002
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:33,650
Yeah.

2003
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:34,280
Like if,

2004
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:34,700
if,

2005
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,533
what is,

2006
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,170
I mean,

2007
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,610
how much do you think he's missing?

2008
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:38,503
10 pounds.

2009
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:38,910
You see?

2010
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:39,800
Know how much,

2011
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:40,830
how much does an average farm way,

2012
00:50:40,831 --> 00:50:41,240
Jamie,

2013
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,470
that's gotta be 10 pounds?

2014
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:42,980
No,

2015
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:43,551
eight pounds.

2016
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:44,384
Six pounds,

2017
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:45,200
dude,

2018
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,760
I think mine is about a hundred.

2019
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:48,890
How might,

2020
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:49,640
how seriously,

2021
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,900
like from his guys,

2022
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:51,531
the grapple,

2023
00:50:51,531 --> 00:50:55,400
there's a guy that grapples without a
leg and his upper body is that of like a

2024
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:58,280
dude that's two AP classes
above the guys he's fighting,

2025
00:50:59,210 --> 00:50:59,691
what does it say,

2026
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:00,500
Jamie?

2027
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:00,951
Eight pounds.

2028
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:01,760
What?

2029
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,593
The whole arm.

2030
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,900
But that's the whole arm
and I were driving weighs
about 5% of your body weight.

2031
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:06,381
Okay.

2032
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:07,220
But that's the whole arm.

2033
00:51:07,221 --> 00:51:07,371
See,

2034
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:08,480
nick has the upper arm.

2035
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,190
He had cast down to the elbow
down past the elbows is here.

2036
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,970
So let's say his,

2037
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:14,390
yeah,

2038
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:15,620
it's not that big of an event.

2039
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:16,550
There was a rep,

2040
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:17,241
there's a wrestler,

2041
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,074
world champion.

2042
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:19,993
Connie's next.

2043
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:20,870
Oh Shit.

2044
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:21,890
But Jason,

2045
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:23,090
I fell on some tough times.

2046
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:25,370
He started off super hot
and then lost his last two.

2047
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:26,210
Who did he fight?

2048
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:26,381
He,

2049
00:51:26,381 --> 00:51:27,500
he stepped way.

2050
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:28,650
Laura's law.

2051
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,790
That's realized.

2052
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:32,210
Crazy idea.

2053
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,860
That was crazy llamas.

2054
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:36,500
His world title contender.

2055
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:37,723
No one wants

2056
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:43,010
going to fucking monster
all across the board.

2057
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:43,923
Yeah.

2058
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,230
Did I go?

2059
00:51:45,231 --> 00:51:45,680
Okay.

2060
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,020
Yeah.

2061
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,540
Llamas you beat Shazam.

2062
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:48,403
Skelly.

2063
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,230
Pardot Lama is too.

2064
00:51:50,231 --> 00:51:51,530
He lost a Mowgli.

2065
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,161
Yeah,

2066
00:51:52,161 --> 00:51:52,401
man,

2067
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:53,300
it's tough.

2068
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,680
He got knocked out by Lama,

2069
00:51:55,681 --> 00:52:00,681
so then he comes back and he lost a
Mowgli this all the time of the night.

2070
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,731
This is a tough fight,

2071
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:02,030
man.

2072
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:05,720
Army mach one or my Connie might be the
toughest fight out of all three of those

2073
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:06,620
more than,

2074
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:06,771
Oh,

2075
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:07,604
Ricardo Lamas.

2076
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:08,430
He's dangerous.

2077
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:09,420
Ricardo Lamas.

2078
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:10,580
Yeah,

2079
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,181
you're right.

2080
00:52:11,181 --> 00:52:11,810
You're right.

2081
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:12,770
But this mock one,

2082
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,110
armored.

2083
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,520
Connie's a wild motherfucker.

2084
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,950
He does a lot of crazy shit.

2085
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,311
Llamas.

2086
00:52:16,311 --> 00:52:18,050
Just chills in the top six.

2087
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:18,920
I mean,

2088
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,610
he's just there.

2089
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:19,761
Well,

2090
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:20,181
class,

2091
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:21,014
get some.

2092
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:24,040
I'm going to have him on
with his dad car llamas.

2093
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:26,180
I've been like leaving him
alone if he thinks I forgot.

2094
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:27,014
I haven't forgot.

2095
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,050
His Dad is like a Cuban exile.

2096
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,480
His Dad left Cuba and his dad.

2097
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:33,560
You know if Joey and here too.

2098
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:33,891
No,

2099
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:34,041
no,

2100
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:34,191
no.

2101
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:35,270
His Dad speaks perfect.

2102
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:37,550
He speaks perfect English and Spanish too.

2103
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:37,760
Yeah,

2104
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,690
I know Ricardo does.

2105
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,970
I get to talk to him.

2106
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,710
I just didn't want to fuck
with him before his fight.

2107
00:52:42,711 --> 00:52:43,521
He's got a big fight.

2108
00:52:43,521 --> 00:52:45,170
Make Sense in Chicago?

2109
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,143
Yeah,

2110
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,860
that is very interesting.

2111
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:50,660
We were looking at the
commercial from UIC chick,

2112
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,610
Steve Bay versus Daniel Cormier.

2113
00:52:52,611 --> 00:52:53,444
Yay.

2114
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:54,290
Great fight.

2115
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,123
Ooh,

2116
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:55,871
interesting.

2117
00:52:55,871 --> 00:52:56,451
Like tough.

2118
00:52:56,451 --> 00:52:57,830
What's the latest with Jon Jones?

2119
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,693
What's going on?

2120
00:52:58,790 --> 00:52:59,271
Dude?

2121
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:00,260
I wish I knew.

2122
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,190
He's still,

2123
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:03,320
he's still waiting to see
what exactly suspension is,

2124
00:53:03,321 --> 00:53:06,230
but where does he's gonna fight,

2125
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:07,340
you know,

2126
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,090
fairly soon.

2127
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:08,810
I really,

2128
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,130
I route so hard for that dude.

2129
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,060
Me Too man.

2130
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,103
But why?

2131
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,890
Cause he's a beast to Badmouth.

2132
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,960
He scan I think in,

2133
00:53:14,961 --> 00:53:17,300
I think in his heart he's a very good guy.

2134
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,110
I was getting to,

2135
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:18,650
yes,

2136
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:19,890
I really do mean he's,

2137
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,120
he does fucked up things
and he makes mistakes.

2138
00:53:23,121 --> 00:53:25,680
But I think John in his
heart is a very good guy.

2139
00:53:25,681 --> 00:53:26,040
I really

2140
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:26,251
do.

2141
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:29,640
I just think he just makes poor
choices and he's wild and you know,

2142
00:53:29,641 --> 00:53:29,891
and,

2143
00:53:29,891 --> 00:53:32,640
and one of the reasons why
we love him is that wildness.

2144
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:33,151
I liked that.

2145
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:33,571
He's wild.

2146
00:53:33,571 --> 00:53:33,721
Yeah.

2147
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:35,010
I don't like that he hurts people,

2148
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:36,000
but he is,

2149
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:37,810
it's typically when guys act like that,

2150
00:53:37,811 --> 00:53:39,360
I usually ride them off
like fuck that dude.

2151
00:53:39,361 --> 00:53:40,194
But with him,

2152
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:41,640
he's so talented.

2153
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,580
I literally think he's the best
of all time to raise the octagon.

2154
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,580
I want to see him back and I
think comes back at heavyweight.

2155
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,200
I think he beats the brakes off.

2156
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:49,561
Brock.

2157
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:51,300
I think he's come back fight is Brock.

2158
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:54,940
And then he fights for the heavyweight
title against the winter of steepy DC.

2159
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:55,973
DC doesn't,

2160
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:56,430
Ooh,

2161
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:57,330
that would be amazing.

2162
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,420
That's what I would do that with ESPN.

2163
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,131
You liked this deal.

2164
00:54:02,131 --> 00:54:03,060
Here's two at 19

2165
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:12,000
did I had the weirdest dream that um,

2166
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:13,260
I was,

2167
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,670
that I had shorts on with no underwear
and are jerked off in my car.

2168
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:18,690
Oh No.

2169
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:21,570
I came all over myself and I
couldn't figure out what to do.

2170
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:25,350
And then I had to go and meet some
friends and I was outside the door.

2171
00:54:25,351 --> 00:54:27,600
And so for some reason Kyle
Kingsbury was in there,

2172
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,600
can get good.

2173
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,513
I liked it.

2174
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:30,301
I'm like,

2175
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:32,760
I'm covered with my own TJ's
and I don't have any underwear,

2176
00:54:32,761 --> 00:54:33,950
and I just had my shorts on like,

2177
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,040
and then I woke up going,

2178
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:37,440
what the fuck is wrong
with a wet dream though?

2179
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,040
No,

2180
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:38,731
really not.

2181
00:54:38,731 --> 00:54:38,871
No.

2182
00:54:38,871 --> 00:54:41,110
You busted in new drill
is the weirdest dream.

2183
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,370
Never had a dream job to my car.

2184
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:46,500
Which car was it though?

2185
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:47,334
This is a big

2186
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:49,000
car.

2187
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,833
Was it Joe?

2188
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:50,843
I don't know.

2189
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:54,510
I don't know if he had a
dream or you draw a jack?

2190
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,010
I've met June when I'm having sex.

2191
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:59,700
I of course it's my bed before it's like,

2192
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:00,690
wait a minute.

2193
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:01,141
You had a dream?

2194
00:55:01,141 --> 00:55:04,050
He had sex and you actually
busted up my wet dream.

2195
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:04,510
Eddie.

2196
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,320
I had those where a myth real.

2197
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:10,350
I had to figure out I was going to meet
some people and apparently didn't have

2198
00:55:10,351 --> 00:55:10,891
any underwear on.

2199
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:12,430
I didn't have a shirt on and I had,

2200
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:13,290
I was like,

2201
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:14,730
I had to crack the door up and I'm like,

2202
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:14,911
dude,

2203
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:15,744
I got a problem.

2204
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:16,621
You've got to help me up.

2205
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:17,580
And then I woke up going,

2206
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:19,380
what the fuck kind of thought is that.

2207
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,420
It's coming from.

2208
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:22,051
It's rare.

2209
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:23,130
I remember my dreams.

2210
00:55:23,131 --> 00:55:23,501
It's weird.

2211
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:24,181
Do you remember yours?

2212
00:55:24,181 --> 00:55:24,790
Just writ.

2213
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:26,430
I remember my last mine last night,

2214
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:27,120
I was walking around,

2215
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,710
I was backstage at Bella [inaudible].

2216
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:31,140
I was going to fight someone I
can't remember and I was like,

2217
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:32,310
I'm not doing this.

2218
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:33,360
I mean it was like pleading to,

2219
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:34,200
I'm not going to do it.

2220
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:36,510
I'm not fucking ready man.

2221
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:37,200
I'm going to do that.

2222
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,130
I don't need this.

2223
00:55:38,131 --> 00:55:38,401
I'm like,

2224
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,590
are you going to go out there?

2225
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:40,980
I'm like,

2226
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:41,880
no.

2227
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:44,100
That's a weird thing.

2228
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,060
That's like one of them.

2229
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,310
I got to go back to high
school and graduate thing.

2230
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,050
Now we have those dreams,

2231
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,253
tires,

2232
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:50,700
all that.

2233
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,450
You can never remember your your
locker combination for your locker.

2234
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:54,630
I'm like,

2235
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,070
how do I open this motherfucker?

2236
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:56,671
My dream,

2237
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,110
my nightmares were credits.

2238
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:58,973
I was too,

2239
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,520
too many credits shy of graduating high
school and they were making me go back

2240
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:03,354
another year.

2241
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:04,283
You're not.

2242
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,373
No,

2243
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:06,151
I did.

2244
00:56:06,151 --> 00:56:08,040
But you remember like when you,

2245
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:11,120
when you were in high school there was
always that one dude that somehow or

2246
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:14,060
another fucked up and had
to repeat senior year too.

2247
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,960
So he's 18 everybody else has 17
is fucking dude is in high schools.

2248
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:20,220
The jeep wrangler sad,

2249
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,510
he's sad,

2250
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,910
he's got losing a year of his workout for

2251
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,700
I have this recurring nightmare that I
don't think it's a post to be a nightmare

2252
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:29,380
I think is supposed to be a great dream.

2253
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:32,830
But it always turns into a nightmare
because like when I used to Dj at Strip

2254
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:33,280
clubs,

2255
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,420
I had a good time.

2256
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:35,590
It was always fun.

2257
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:37,390
And then I dream about it.

2258
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,380
I dream about it.

2259
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:38,970
And the,

2260
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:42,790
the problem is to be a strip club Dj,

2261
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,750
you got to,

2262
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,290
you got to know your cds and the girls
that are going up and you're matching up

2263
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:48,160
the songs with the girls,

2264
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:48,990
you gotta be sharp.

2265
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,250
They all want those different songs.

2266
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:50,801
Exactly.

2267
00:56:50,801 --> 00:56:51,700
So in my dream,

2268
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:53,470
I think it's supposed to be a great train,

2269
00:56:53,471 --> 00:56:56,980
but I can never read the cds
and the managers get mad at me.

2270
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:57,631
I'm like,

2271
00:56:57,631 --> 00:56:57,880
I'm like,

2272
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,960
what girls on stage?

2273
00:56:58,961 --> 00:56:59,520
And I'm like,

2274
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,353
I'm going.

2275
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,290
And the only CD that I remember,

2276
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:06,370
the only one is the crystal method
because that was my go to CD.

2277
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:07,540
No other cds.

2278
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:07,840
I'm like,

2279
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,051
oh,

2280
00:57:08,051 --> 00:57:10,270
I could always pull that
one out as your default.

2281
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:10,721
Yeah.

2282
00:57:10,721 --> 00:57:15,010
Cause you know you got to change the
song every two minutes and 45 seconds

2283
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:17,590
because every song means
money for the club.

2284
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,730
They're all getting lap dances.

2285
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,600
So if you let a song go three and a
half before the manager get on your ass,

2286
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,291
what the fuck?

2287
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:24,680
It's three and a half minutes full.

2288
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,750
It's very stressful.

2289
00:57:25,751 --> 00:57:26,584
So if there's a girl,

2290
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:31,000
a gross bust about to go on stage and
15 seconds before she goes on stage,

2291
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:31,540
she goes,

2292
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,111
skip me.

2293
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:33,850
I got a lap dance and we're fucked up.

2294
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:34,121
I'm like,

2295
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:34,780
Oh shit.

2296
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,520
I got 15 seconds to find
a replacement and to,

2297
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:38,750
to change the mood of this.

2298
00:57:38,751 --> 00:57:39,550
I got a plan.

2299
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,860
So in my dream I'm having
a fucking nightmare.

2300
00:57:41,861 --> 00:57:42,131
I'm like,

2301
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:45,370
I can't see the girl on stage
and I can't see my sister.

2302
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:46,840
Yeah,

2303
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,671
it's a total nine.

2304
00:57:47,671 --> 00:57:47,861
I'm like,

2305
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:48,251
Oh my God,

2306
00:57:48,251 --> 00:57:49,090
I'm gonna get fired.

2307
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,230
What am I going to do now?

2308
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,470
I never figured in my dream ever do.

2309
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:56,260
I realize that I make
money teaching Jujitsu.

2310
00:57:56,261 --> 00:57:56,950
Never.

2311
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,590
It's always I lose my job by
what am I going to do now?

2312
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,371
And then I wake up,

2313
00:58:00,371 --> 00:58:00,580
I'm like,

2314
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,000
ah,

2315
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,990
I teach Jujitsu.

2316
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:02,883
I'm fine.

2317
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:09,580
You're the one in between the tracks
by guidelines and Joan and bring you up

2318
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:11,680
Dandy on stage seven.

2319
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:12,850
But he never did it that way.

2320
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,250
He didn't have the fake strip club.

2321
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:14,771
Oh No,

2322
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:14,890
no,

2323
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:14,981
no,

2324
00:58:14,981 --> 00:58:15,814
I did.

2325
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:16,930
You have to have the faith.

2326
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:17,350
No,

2327
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:18,260
you have to have it.

2328
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:21,110
You have to because if you talk regularly,

2329
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,301
no,

2330
00:58:22,301 --> 00:58:23,020
it was always,

2331
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,270
it was always my Simpsons.

2332
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:26,920
Dj Strip cleaving ones.

2333
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:28,211
Alright guys,

2334
00:58:28,211 --> 00:58:30,340
put those hands together for London.

2335
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,020
Oh,

2336
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,070
see that's kind of cool.

2337
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,040
But you have to say,

2338
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,920
you have to do that goofy
voice to cut through.

2339
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:37,180
Otherwise people can't hear you.

2340
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,540
If you just get on a mic and a strip
club and you just talk like Kelly's on

2341
00:58:40,541 --> 00:58:41,440
table seven over,

2342
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:42,510
it won't cut through.

2343
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,780
They won't cut through.

2344
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:43,871
Well,

2345
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:44,471
not only that,

2346
00:58:44,471 --> 00:58:45,970
like it has to have some drama to it.

2347
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:46,570
Right.

2348
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:47,291
You can't just go,

2349
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:47,470
oh,

2350
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:48,400
here's Monica.

2351
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:49,870
She doesn't like doing this job,

2352
00:58:49,871 --> 00:58:50,704
but here show you guys.

2353
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,770
You got to have that
check or that disease.

2354
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,510
She's got some unfortunate
goofy's chasing off.

2355
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,530
Hopefully should find a good guy.

2356
00:58:57,531 --> 00:58:58,450
I leave this job tells,

2357
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,650
made some terrible decisions.

2358
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:00,603
Checkout Table

2359
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:03,460
Two is unfortunate,

2360
00:59:03,461 --> 00:59:05,020
but now you gotta go all out.

2361
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:12,460
She's been invented 25 foster homes.

2362
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:13,450
Just hook her up.

2363
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,210
Just come on.

2364
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,313
Jason Knight.

2365
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:18,970
Tough motherfucker.

2366
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:22,070
That's really the country Diaz

2367
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,690
look at that fucking knows man.

2368
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:25,190
That knows his to take it.

2369
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:26,150
Some punches son.

2370
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,170
He ran his name,

2371
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:28,420
his nickname the country Diaz.

2372
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,990
Cause he's very similarly
the Diaz brothers.

2373
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:30,530
Hmm.

2374
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:32,150
Minus the domestic abuse charges.

2375
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:32,421
Well,

2376
00:59:32,421 --> 00:59:33,530
very fucking debt.

2377
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:35,020
Domestic abuse thing is bomber.

2378
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,070
Matt W we don't know the facts though.

2379
00:59:37,071 --> 00:59:40,250
Dewey Knicks guys sent me something.

2380
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,290
Those friend data.

2381
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:41,601
Yeah,

2382
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:43,340
dating some crazy girl doesn't care.

2383
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,880
She's actually a stalker and really good,

2384
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:47,870
but he's a really good person.

2385
00:59:47,871 --> 00:59:48,120
I'm like,

2386
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:48,590
well,

2387
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:49,201
Oh fuck you.

2388
00:59:49,201 --> 00:59:50,060
Thanks Bro.

2389
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:51,020
Yeah.

2390
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,810
Did Jason Knight Nasty off his back?

2391
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,290
Great glass quick.

2392
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,010
He's an Alan Belcher student.

2393
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:02,160
Alan Belcher's Jiu Jitsu
is pretty awesome for MMA.

2394
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:04,120
This kid's been talking so much shit.

2395
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,140
Americani Mr Finland,

2396
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:11,410
he's about talking so much
Belcher versus freestyle Russo.

2397
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:13,320
Kamar porous when he beat the shower,

2398
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:17,010
one of the greatest fights
of all fucking thigh.

2399
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:18,080
But everybody was scared of that.

2400
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,610
I saw him a week later.

2401
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:21,600
He had it.

2402
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,570
Who some are in a twist into it.

2403
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:25,790
I saw him a week later and
I was so impressed by it.

2404
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:26,624
I scared him.

2405
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:28,360
You thought he was Mike Tyson?

2406
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:28,941
I was like,

2407
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:29,571
Bro,

2408
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:30,890
it's like Jesus Christ.

2409
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:34,880
What you did was insane small at the time.

2410
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:37,120
He had real smart in a twister.

2411
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:38,090
He had them in the truck,

2412
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,850
almost finished him route Somar gets out,

2413
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:41,570
gets out,

2414
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,010
has Alan Belcher,

2415
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:48,220
all sorts of leg lock trouble and Al
Belter just dismantled all that shit and

2416
01:00:49,211 --> 01:00:50,120
beat the fuck out.

2417
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:53,180
Dean lister and who else
was it Tom to blast?

2418
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:53,570
No,

2419
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:54,300
he brought in,

2420
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,620
uh,

2421
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,670
for that fight for a month.

2422
01:00:55,671 --> 01:00:58,250
He brought in Dean this during
Dobby Ramos who's in the UFC.

2423
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:00,860
Be Ramos is really good at like locks too.

2424
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:02,760
So he had,

2425
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,870
he had dean lister,

2426
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,151
Dobby.

2427
01:01:04,151 --> 01:01:05,750
Ron was on his legs for a month.

2428
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:08,360
He said the first two weeks he
tapped out probably 500 times,

2429
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,840
but then he started learning how to
stop the leg locks to the a month.

2430
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,740
Then he went into it,

2431
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:14,550
beat the shit and then he made,

2432
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:16,820
he made a DVD called immunity.

2433
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,190
How to stop black glass.

2434
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,770
Remember that immunity Alan Belcher.

2435
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:22,970
Like he's over there talking,

2436
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:24,130
dude,

2437
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:24,791
I'm telling you homeboy.

2438
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:26,090
He's talking so much shit.

2439
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,260
Then when they did the posts,

2440
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:28,131
you know Wayne's,

2441
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:28,964
when they always interview,

2442
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:29,571
he was like,

2443
01:01:29,571 --> 01:01:30,910
I'm going to beat the shit out of him.

2444
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,150
He was going hard in the pace.

2445
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:33,560
Well,

2446
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,890
Jason Knight is one of the few fighters
in the UFC where they can't show his

2447
01:01:36,891 --> 01:01:40,170
flag because this flags get
the fucking very flag on it.

2448
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,500
Mississippi still has the
confederate flag and their state.

2449
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:42,651
Yeah,

2450
01:01:42,651 --> 01:01:43,550
they're proud of that shit.

2451
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:43,911
Jamie,

2452
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:45,830
can you get the fight
on that screen as well?

2453
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:47,840
That is it.

2454
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,430
That is fucking crazy.

2455
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:52,770
Which is five the night written all
over his big ass screen right here.

2456
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:53,200
Sharp.

2457
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,160
Why y'all turned my next all stiff.

2458
01:01:55,161 --> 01:01:55,850
What we do,

2459
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:57,140
look at that right there.

2460
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:57,801
Oh fuck.

2461
01:01:57,801 --> 01:01:58,970
Three screens in here.

2462
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:00,470
This is like a God damn sports bar.

2463
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:02,480
It's like we're at buffalo
wild wings minus the wings.

2464
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,990
This is a very,

2465
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:09,830
very interesting fight and 80
[inaudible] has been talking crazy shit,

2466
01:02:09,831 --> 01:02:10,100
huh?

2467
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,110
Oh dude was going so hard in the paint.

2468
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:12,651
He goes,

2469
01:02:12,651 --> 01:02:15,590
this is a long trip for you to come
just for one round to get knocked out.

2470
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:16,970
She's going super hard.

2471
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:20,220
Then you just trying to get them
emotional because he from England?

2472
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:22,200
Yeah.

2473
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:22,711
Does he live in?

2474
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:23,010
No,

2475
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:23,880
he lives in Finland.

2476
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:24,420
We did.

2477
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,100
At least he did for a while.

2478
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:27,323
I don't know he,

2479
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:29,910
they used to call him
Mister Finland I think.

2480
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:30,450
I think,

2481
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:30,691
yeah.

2482
01:02:30,691 --> 01:02:30,961
Nights.

2483
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:31,830
The underdog here.

2484
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:34,420
Yeah.

2485
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:37,570
Well I mean he kind of has to be
after those two losses in a row,

2486
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:43,470
but our mayor Connie was a guy who burst
on the scene a few years back and you

2487
01:02:43,841 --> 01:02:44,030
know,

2488
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:46,750
was really promising but we haven't yet.

2489
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,400
People don't talk about it much.

2490
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:49,543
Oh No.

2491
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:50,493
They will feel,

2492
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,390
oh shit.

2493
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:52,961
Oh,

2494
01:02:52,961 --> 01:02:53,440
jump on him.

2495
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,060
Oh,

2496
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,170
that Pete Guard America.

2497
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,190
This isn't what he wants.

2498
01:02:57,191 --> 01:03:00,240
You don't want to get in these scrambles
in the straight up cock fight with your

2499
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,740
with nightmare pulled guard quit.

2500
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,400
Tommy walked to them and
stash it to look at that.

2501
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:06,520
Please don't do that.

2502
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:09,220
He's controlling his biceps
and talking shit to him.

2503
01:03:09,221 --> 01:03:09,420
Hit.

2504
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,360
Don't do that though.

2505
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:10,961
Oh,

2506
01:03:10,961 --> 01:03:15,961
good posture and he did a good job at
avoiding any kind of guard attacks.

2507
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:16,421
Yeah.

2508
01:03:16,421 --> 01:03:19,030
The way he did that by
planting down those biceps,

2509
01:03:19,031 --> 01:03:22,480
a very small slice of control and then
he postured up at the Mirman time broke

2510
01:03:22,481 --> 01:03:23,314
through those legs.

2511
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,200
He's been doing his homework
and he's telling him that too.

2512
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,640
Like you ain't getting shit off on me.

2513
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,440
Let's snake tattoo hanging
over his shoulders.

2514
01:03:29,441 --> 01:03:30,274
Interesting.

2515
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,590
It's like a Mandy to the main stage.

2516
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,431
Yes.

2517
01:03:33,431 --> 01:03:34,264
It's very similar.

2518
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:41,323
Just talking.

2519
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:42,650
He got hurt.

2520
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:44,110
He got hurt and get a motion.

2521
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:45,450
Heard jabs or,

2522
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:45,790
yeah,

2523
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:46,520
touching him.

2524
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,480
He was having a problem with that.

2525
01:03:47,481 --> 01:03:48,111
I did.

2526
01:03:48,111 --> 01:03:50,030
He has a lot of scar tissue on his face.

2527
01:03:50,031 --> 01:03:53,270
If you look at his face like she looks
like a great whites knows it's fucking,

2528
01:03:53,271 --> 01:03:55,180
it's just all sorts of
shit all over as well.

2529
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:56,060
That style,

2530
01:03:56,061 --> 01:03:59,300
I mean that crazy bulldog style
doesn't really work these days,

2531
01:03:59,301 --> 01:03:59,541
man.

2532
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:01,640
Once you get to upper echelon level,

2533
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,650
it works until you,

2534
01:04:02,651 --> 01:04:07,010
you can't take a shot anymore because
your face just gets smashed in too much.

2535
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,001
Then when you get,

2536
01:04:08,001 --> 01:04:09,050
the technicians are like,

2537
01:04:09,051 --> 01:04:09,470
all right,

2538
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,160
cool man.

2539
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:10,850
That's what you like.

2540
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:11,600
Just engaging.

2541
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,180
Exactly.

2542
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:12,861
That's what you want to do.

2543
01:04:12,861 --> 01:04:13,694
Cool.

2544
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:14,810
Yeah.

2545
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,010
Guys just are smart.

2546
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,210
He's mock.

2547
01:04:17,211 --> 01:04:21,530
Juan just keeps looking for that right
hook counter and he's doing it real nice.

2548
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:22,430
I like what he's doing.

2549
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,390
I like his jab to Oh,

2550
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:24,320
there you go.

2551
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:26,720
Yeah.

2552
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,830
Oh,

2553
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:28,631
I'm here.

2554
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:29,930
Connie is a good wrestler too.

2555
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:30,861
Is a very good,

2556
01:04:30,861 --> 01:04:31,230
yes.

2557
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:32,063
That's his background.

2558
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:32,901
Oh Shit.

2559
01:04:32,901 --> 01:04:33,734
Okay.

2560
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:39,480
He just keeps more of that damn look.

2561
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,350
Get them yet.

2562
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:43,320
It's comfortable in there.

2563
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:44,460
Did it.

2564
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,600
That leg kick hurt him.

2565
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,630
You think that inside one,

2566
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:47,520
and it always hurts.

2567
01:04:47,521 --> 01:04:48,450
I think sucks.

2568
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:50,820
Especially when you get
kicked right above the knee.

2569
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:51,360
Oh,

2570
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,770
it's a fucking terrible for feeling.

2571
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,700
It just feels like you're hoping
your your ligament stay together.

2572
01:04:56,701 --> 01:04:57,510
And they do,

2573
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:57,721
Dude.

2574
01:04:57,721 --> 01:04:59,850
How much always do every time you get hit,

2575
01:04:59,851 --> 01:05:00,150
they were like,

2576
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:03,390
oh damn wheel kicks dude.

2577
01:05:03,391 --> 01:05:05,970
How about Amanda Nunez Kicks
Against Raquel Pennington.

2578
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:07,260
Pentance of that first cake.

2579
01:05:07,261 --> 01:05:08,250
She had surgery on that.

2580
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,361
Oh Shit.

2581
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:12,150
Doodie stomped right on that knee
and folded them a little bit.

2582
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,300
You see that he's throwing
a nice variety of kicks.

2583
01:05:15,301 --> 01:05:16,020
I liked that.

2584
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,010
Well he's got to do that.

2585
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:17,890
Get guys,

2586
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:18,220
guys

2587
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,001
that are fighting the day,

2588
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:22,840
there's a whole bunch of them that
they don't throw really any kick still.

2589
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:25,050
They're still out there and they
don't throw anything at the,

2590
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:25,760
at the lions.

2591
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,001
Loud,

2592
01:05:26,001 --> 01:05:27,370
crazy at the latter levels.

2593
01:05:27,371 --> 01:05:28,860
They kind of mix it all up cause you have,

2594
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:32,580
you shouldn't make sense heavyweights
headway cause you know what you know,

2595
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,770
you know I love Damien Maia fucking
more than any other fighter out there,

2596
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:36,040
right.

2597
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,660
I think bye bye now.

2598
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:41,780
Oh Shit.

2599
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:44,380
Oh Damn.

2600
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,570
Damn God,

2601
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:46,540
we should have stayed on top.

2602
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,310
You should have stayed on top.

2603
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:50,013
Still hurt.

2604
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:50,853
I'm still hurt.

2605
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:51,340
I'm here.

2606
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,180
Connie is still hurt.

2607
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:53,470
He got fucked up.

2608
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,551
Oh,

2609
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:56,110
shit cracked him.

2610
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,273
Oh

2611
01:05:58,370 --> 01:05:59,203
no shit.

2612
01:05:59,240 --> 01:05:59,690
That was,

2613
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:00,310
he didn't go.

2614
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:01,143
He was here.

2615
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:02,390
Oh Shit,

2616
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:02,661
dude.

2617
01:06:02,661 --> 01:06:04,040
What the fuck is he doing?

2618
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:05,720
But he likes fighting off his back.

2619
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:07,670
He likes his recovering.

2620
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:07,851
Yeah,

2621
01:06:07,851 --> 01:06:08,211
but look,

2622
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:09,380
he's in mission control here.

2623
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:10,480
This ain't bad.

2624
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,313
I say bad at all.

2625
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:13,910
It's small right there.

2626
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:16,820
Just triangle his legs.

2627
01:06:16,821 --> 01:06:17,750
It's all he's got to do.

2628
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:18,780
Oh,

2629
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:19,613
Shahada.

2630
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,391
It'd be triangle.

2631
01:06:20,391 --> 01:06:20,781
Those legs.

2632
01:06:20,781 --> 01:06:21,830
You get them in a dead orchard.

2633
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:25,320
Does he know singling out that?

2634
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:26,180
Yeah,

2635
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:26,930
he knows it,

2636
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:28,520
but what he's trying to
do is clear the neck.

2637
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:29,720
That's the main thing he's trying to do.

2638
01:06:29,721 --> 01:06:30,200
He's going to try,

2639
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:34,490
he's trying to get invisible collar at
this point or some kind of meat hook or

2640
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:36,330
something with a stupid,

2641
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,050
oh shit.

2642
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:42,623
He's got them.

2643
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,430
He's got them 10 10 seconds.

2644
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:46,310
He's got 'em in Vertiv.

2645
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:47,291
Oh,

2646
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:48,011
he got out.

2647
01:06:48,011 --> 01:06:48,660
Shit.

2648
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:49,630
Look at that Dark Hilton.

2649
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:50,483
Go for it.

2650
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:51,983
10 seconds.

2651
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:52,953
You're couple shots.

2652
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:54,770
Oh Shit.

2653
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:55,381
Look at him.

2654
01:06:55,381 --> 01:06:56,214
Look at him.

2655
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,553
Awesome.

2656
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:58,850
You ain't talking shit anymore.

2657
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,720
How about he started talking shit.

2658
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:01,711
How about he stood up,

2659
01:07:01,711 --> 01:07:01,950
starts,

2660
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:02,783
I can shoot

2661
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:04,793
this kid.

2662
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:05,751
Oh,

2663
01:07:05,751 --> 01:07:07,950
you went to the wrong corner down.

2664
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:08,813
They bet they're

2665
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,270
all fucked up.

2666
01:07:12,271 --> 01:07:13,020
That was awesome.

2667
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:13,400
But again,

2668
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,320
British based on the night
caught them with some good shots.

2669
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:16,903
Hurt him badly.

2670
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:18,783
Hurt him bad.

2671
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,630
40 seconds left to
fucking go down to guard.

2672
01:07:21,631 --> 01:07:21,781
Like,

2673
01:07:21,781 --> 01:07:22,570
I don't care if you liked it.

2674
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:23,580
Not a bad idea.

2675
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:24,773
I'm going to triangle.

2676
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:26,310
Ah Man.

2677
01:07:26,311 --> 01:07:27,690
If that fight was two minutes longer,

2678
01:07:27,691 --> 01:07:28,740
he could have caught him in something.

2679
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:30,060
He was scrambling.

2680
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,890
You got 30 seconds on top of them.

2681
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,520
30 you know how hard it is
to get a finished 30 seconds.

2682
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:35,371
It all depends on,

2683
01:07:35,371 --> 01:07:37,190
is it the way I like it?

2684
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:37,500
Yeah.

2685
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,380
And I get off

2686
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,020
only a of pulling guard.

2687
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,580
It's so suicidal.

2688
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:45,443
Like people say,

2689
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:50,070
why is it so hard for
Damien Maia to pull guard?

2690
01:07:50,071 --> 01:07:50,880
He'll sit on his butt.

2691
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,140
People don't want to get on top of them.

2692
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:52,570
Yeah,

2693
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:53,281
they make a sand.

2694
01:07:53,281 --> 01:07:53,840
Does that,

2695
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,270
look at that.

2696
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:54,840
Look at that.

2697
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,673
Cause that's literally

2698
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:58,470
let's but a bit,

2699
01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:00,310
so that's probably my,

2700
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:01,480
I can't win any other way.

2701
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,493
Here we go.

2702
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,620
Round to Emmett.

2703
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,220
Connie got fucked up in
that first weekend night.

2704
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,080
Did he still confident but
he's a little bit like that.

2705
01:08:11,081 --> 01:08:11,900
Fuck and Hammer.

2706
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,860
Connie still make taking big deep breaths.

2707
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:14,131
Dude.

2708
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:14,964
He got hurt.

2709
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:16,100
That

2710
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,110
one uppercut really fucked him up.

2711
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,470
Anyone else just ripped
my hardest fuck for night.

2712
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:23,731
Yeah,

2713
01:08:23,731 --> 01:08:24,511
I'm at right now.

2714
01:08:24,511 --> 01:08:25,344
Right.

2715
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,030
Well smirked on him.

2716
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:29,520
[inaudible] he's a tough guy.

2717
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:30,540
I like watching them fight,

2718
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:34,590
but I also like a guy coming
back from two two fights down.

2719
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,030
Did you lose three in a row?

2720
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:36,301
It'd be,

2721
01:08:36,301 --> 01:08:36,901
it'd be tough.

2722
01:08:36,901 --> 01:08:38,370
Is Kirby in trouble man?

2723
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:39,830
Okay,

2724
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:40,491
well these findings,

2725
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:41,720
not the one I've seen him.

2726
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,550
How dare you dude.

2727
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:45,460
One FC is putting on
some good fucking trolls.

2728
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:51,840
Boys I get to but compared to the
UFC and there's Bella towards him,

2729
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:52,480
he's like dot.

2730
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,580
The problem with one fc
is just about exposure.

2731
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,130
They've got some great Thai
fighters over there in Asia.

2732
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:00,380
One FC is huge,

2733
01:09:00,381 --> 01:09:00,861
huge,

2734
01:09:00,861 --> 01:09:04,640
huge to this giant reaches
like a billion households.

2735
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:05,040
Yeah.

2736
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,500
Baskins huge star.

2737
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:07,620
No,

2738
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:08,630
in Asia he is.

2739
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:13,940
Oh look at this talking to a
seasoned agents to now son.

2740
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:15,290
Yeah,

2741
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:15,651
it is.

2742
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:16,850
But one fc,

2743
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:17,601
I'm telling you,

2744
01:09:17,601 --> 01:09:18,050
Brendan,

2745
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,490
it is very big overseas.

2746
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:20,383
I know it's big.

2747
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,351
I know it's big.

2748
01:09:21,351 --> 01:09:22,080
If you're not in the UFC,

2749
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:22,220
it,

2750
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:22,790
it's,

2751
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:23,990
if you're not in the UFC,

2752
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:25,130
it's a tough goal,

2753
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:25,640
man.

2754
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,473
It is.

2755
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,411
It's a tough go.

2756
01:09:27,411 --> 01:09:27,600
But,

2757
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,311
but it's not over.

2758
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:29,660
One FC is catching up.

2759
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,110
Yeah.

2760
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:30,943
In Asia.

2761
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,280
I mean they're bigger than
Bellah tours over there.

2762
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,400
They're Belko doesn't
really do age exactly,

2763
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:38,210
but that's our number two right.

2764
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:40,160
Are number two in America's Bella tour.

2765
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:40,840
Well,

2766
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,560
no,

2767
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:41,880
no.

2768
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,621
Towards getting bigger.

2769
01:09:42,621 --> 01:09:43,040
Right.

2770
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:43,550
It's bigger.

2771
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:44,420
I mean they're in Europe.

2772
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:45,900
They're obviously just
had that card and one,

2773
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,013
they're heavyweights,

2774
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:48,230
uh,

2775
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:48,621
tournament.

2776
01:09:48,621 --> 01:09:49,041
They're doing it,

2777
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:50,000
they're killing it right now.

2778
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,760
And then really ratings really
got jail fade or coming up.

2779
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:53,713
You got Ryan Bader,

2780
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,351
mitre owned.

2781
01:09:54,351 --> 01:09:55,590
Well they need a heavyweight champion.

2782
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:55,740
Yeah.

2783
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:56,001
Michael.

2784
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:58,260
Then in page you see that they
don't have a heavyweight champion.

2785
01:09:58,261 --> 01:09:58,971
Can I have one now?

2786
01:09:58,971 --> 01:09:59,610
Under the year?

2787
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:00,230
Yeah.

2788
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,340
There aren't that many big guys.

2789
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,230
It's Ryan Bader.

2790
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:03,110
It could be issues,

2791
01:10:03,111 --> 01:10:03,351
right?

2792
01:10:03,351 --> 01:10:05,540
Cause he's a light heavyweight and
he's the light heavyweight champ.

2793
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:08,820
But maybe fights better at at heavyweight
than he does it line everywhere.

2794
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:09,713
It's true.

2795
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,630
She felt Davis' head kicked Kale.

2796
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:12,970
That was crazy.

2797
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:13,761
Davis looks good.

2798
01:10:13,761 --> 01:10:14,594
That was nasty.

2799
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:19,920
Amir Khan inside night talking shit.

2800
01:10:19,921 --> 01:10:21,120
Now I have some comments.

2801
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,060
Americani got that Nice Jab,

2802
01:10:25,061 --> 01:10:26,340
right Hook Combo.

2803
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:26,710
Yeah,

2804
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:27,570
that right hand.

2805
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,321
He throws us.

2806
01:10:28,321 --> 01:10:29,320
Look for that show.

2807
01:10:29,321 --> 01:10:29,941
We clipped him.

2808
01:10:29,941 --> 01:10:30,571
Damn.

2809
01:10:30,571 --> 01:10:31,440
He's got a good ride,

2810
01:10:31,441 --> 01:10:31,680
Huh?

2811
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,161
Oh,

2812
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:33,110
nice uppercut to it.

2813
01:10:33,111 --> 01:10:33,944
Mixed it up.

2814
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,600
We're missing Colorado going,

2815
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:38,841
God,

2816
01:10:38,841 --> 01:10:39,680
these guys are sweat.

2817
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:42,620
Why doesn't he just hit
him with a right hand cal?

2818
01:10:42,621 --> 01:10:43,101
You'll be like,

2819
01:10:43,101 --> 01:10:43,241
why?

2820
01:10:43,241 --> 01:10:43,551
What is it?

2821
01:10:43,551 --> 01:10:44,610
You just know calen got,

2822
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:45,493
keep your hands up.

2823
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,700
Why does he throw the front kick?

2824
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:47,211
Oh,

2825
01:10:47,211 --> 01:10:48,200
shoot him again.

2826
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:49,330
Oop.

2827
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:53,750
He guilt guilting coming
in hot note pads again.

2828
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:55,563
Yeah.

2829
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,331
You can't get it as well.

2830
01:11:00,331 --> 01:11:03,710
I grew up trying on the body and
doing a good job at defending.

2831
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:06,050
You wouldn't give that first
round ten eight what'd you

2832
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:08,770
Nah,

2833
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:09,230
no,

2834
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:09,950
no.

2835
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:11,180
Maybe he ain't been down.

2836
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:12,440
The rules with the number plate.

2837
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:13,413
What's the new rule?

2838
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,190
The new

2839
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:15,270
a scoring system.

2840
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:15,980
What is it?

2841
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:16,131
It,

2842
01:11:16,131 --> 01:11:20,070
the new scoring system is when
you show like a clear advantage,

2843
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,660
you'd have to have someone look at it.

2844
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:26,960
But a clear advantage is the difference
between like winning and winning.

2845
01:11:27,331 --> 01:11:29,670
Like clearly he clearly
won that first round.

2846
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:31,560
I would have to look at it like how they,

2847
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:32,700
how they uh,

2848
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:33,271
frame it.

2849
01:11:33,271 --> 01:11:37,350
Now I think we have a real problem being
imprisoned by that 10 point system.

2850
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:39,360
I think the 10 point system is stupid.

2851
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,810
Pretty much happened there.

2852
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:46,130
What do you think about
the recently there's been a
bunch of early standups from

2853
01:11:46,441 --> 01:11:51,441
the ground while the Leon Roberts
one with a Damien Maia and uh,

2854
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:52,530
uh,

2855
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:57,530
[inaudible] was ridiculous with the wizard
Riddick that was super is ridiculous

2856
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,480
that someone not knowing what's going on.

2857
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:01,231
Not only that,

2858
01:12:01,231 --> 01:12:04,590
I mean you're dealing with a fighter
that is taking a fight on last minute

2859
01:12:04,591 --> 01:12:07,950
notice against a super dominant wrestler
and he essentially is in a great

2860
01:12:07,951 --> 01:12:12,180
position and could maybe get his
back and that just biggest advantage.

2861
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,193
You fuck them.

2862
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,910
I'm our county takes him down now here.

2863
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:15,900
Yeah.

2864
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,210
He felt was another fire recently
when they were on the ground.

2865
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,590
The guy was like side controller,

2866
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,453
the mount,

2867
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,300
and then the ref stood them up like that.

2868
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,750
Upon that same chili card,

2869
01:12:24,751 --> 01:12:28,470
there's also in the girls fight where
the female referee let them just stay on

2870
01:12:28,471 --> 01:12:28,591
there,

2871
01:12:28,591 --> 01:12:29,940
but with no engagement.

2872
01:12:29,941 --> 01:12:30,181
I'm like,

2873
01:12:30,181 --> 01:12:32,040
stand them up Nazi.

2874
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,120
She doesn't want to be down there.

2875
01:12:33,121 --> 01:12:33,954
She does.

2876
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,160
No one's interacting.

2877
01:12:35,161 --> 01:12:37,620
Let's go taste it nights.

2878
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:40,410
He's got a fucking wicked mission control.

2879
01:12:40,411 --> 01:12:41,940
He pulls to that Michigan lateral.

2880
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,480
Very nice.

2881
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:45,420
Got immediately right now he
could hit a triangle right here.

2882
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:46,530
Made huck look at that.

2883
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,393
Oh

2884
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:51,090
yeah.

2885
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:51,610
Has he been made?

2886
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:53,530
Connie ain't doing shit
on the ground either.

2887
01:12:53,531 --> 01:12:56,800
He's not getting it mean he
might be doing okay defensively,

2888
01:12:56,801 --> 01:12:58,460
but he's not getting shit off often.

2889
01:12:58,490 --> 01:12:58,600
No,

2890
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,310
he's threatened nonstop down there,

2891
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:03,210
which to me should be
a win for Jason Knight.

2892
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:04,230
Jason,

2893
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:05,530
I'd gone for a leg lock here.

2894
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,210
I thought about it.

2895
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:09,250
Amir,

2896
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:10,083
Connie Austan.

2897
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,920
He's losing and so he goes to the ground,

2898
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:13,480
but over that leg lock right here.

2899
01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:15,250
Oh Shit.

2900
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,880
It's like a around a piece.

2901
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:20,900
Maybe he'd be

2902
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:23,283
judges.

2903
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:25,000
The judges for sure.

2904
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:25,870
Given that the Americana,

2905
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,113
that's it's one,

2906
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:27,590
one,

2907
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:29,530
one with him on the ground.

2908
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:30,513
Zero.

2909
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:32,393
He still,

2910
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,740
he still took them down sucks though.

2911
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:36,400
Cause Jason Knight was doing work
and threatened him the entire time.

2912
01:13:36,401 --> 01:13:37,930
When the gun get the gift to be a Connie,

2913
01:13:37,931 --> 01:13:38,950
he's on the defensive.

2914
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:41,420
That's the flaws in our judging isn't,

2915
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:42,670
it's a giant.

2916
01:13:42,671 --> 01:13:43,660
It's fucking insane.

2917
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:46,360
I feel like it should be
like a hundred points system.

2918
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:49,810
I feel like there should never be
any standing up five minute rounds.

2919
01:13:49,811 --> 01:13:51,190
There should never be any standup.

2920
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:51,521
Yeah,

2921
01:13:51,521 --> 01:13:52,354
I'm with you.

2922
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:57,100
Why you standing in lockdown and have
forever five minutes by the time they get

2923
01:13:57,101 --> 01:13:57,671
to the ground,

2924
01:13:57,671 --> 01:13:59,500
like there's not any get downs.

2925
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:01,630
Like if there's boring on the feet,

2926
01:14:01,631 --> 01:14:02,020
they're not,

2927
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,570
they're not that doing what you
doing guys just hold position,

2928
01:14:04,571 --> 01:14:05,370
you know shit.

2929
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:06,101
It's just the fight.

2930
01:14:06,101 --> 01:14:07,470
That's just how I got the fuck out of

2931
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,560
four minutes to get back up
to the feet when the over,

2932
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:12,450
because without

2933
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:14,300
this Brendan,

2934
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:17,230
this is what happens if you could,

2935
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:21,430
if they stand them up because they're
holding than guys w why would they learn

2936
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,930
Jujitsu if they get taken down?

2937
01:14:22,931 --> 01:14:23,281
If a strike,

2938
01:14:23,281 --> 01:14:24,070
it gets taken out.

2939
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:26,680
All you gotta do is get good at holding
and the Rep's going to stand them up.

2940
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:29,740
That's what it leads to and it fucks a
sport up round three you can't have that.

2941
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:30,161
That gives,

2942
01:14:30,161 --> 01:14:35,161
that gives a strike or a reason to not
learn Jujitsu and just hold and look to

2943
01:14:35,261 --> 01:14:35,770
the referee,

2944
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:37,340
stand them up or fucks up the teachers.

2945
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:38,440
Learn wrestling.

2946
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,940
Keep winning by just holding him down.

2947
01:14:39,941 --> 01:14:40,774
One take done.

2948
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,730
Then you got to learn how
to fight off your back.

2949
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:43,420
God,

2950
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,253
you got to learn how to fight.

2951
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:46,180
You got to push the sport.

2952
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:47,560
You can't go backwards.

2953
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:50,440
I'm Eric standard looking for a take
down again and standing up the fight.

2954
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,370
That takes everything backwards and it
makes it so you don't have to learn into

2955
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:54,820
and trying to win the fight though.

2956
01:14:54,821 --> 01:14:57,730
It's an issue that you could say
the same thing about them standing.

2957
01:14:57,731 --> 01:14:58,990
That happens all the time standing.

2958
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:00,130
No one says shit about that.

2959
01:15:00,131 --> 01:15:01,180
We can't put them to the ground.

2960
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:01,601
Why not?

2961
01:15:01,601 --> 01:15:02,910
We do an in combat Jiu Jitsu.

2962
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:05,910
We have get down's baby kid kid down

2963
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:08,981
to minutes.

2964
01:15:08,981 --> 01:15:09,431
If you guys,

2965
01:15:09,431 --> 01:15:10,780
there's no take down in two minutes,

2966
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,650
we get them down.

2967
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:12,910
Remember when this was illegal,

2968
01:15:12,911 --> 01:15:14,380
these kidneys tracks were illegal.

2969
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:15,520
They're not illegal anymore.

2970
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:16,720
They should do more of those.

2971
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:18,430
When a guy has a someone's back,

2972
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:19,211
remember how hits him.

2973
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:20,230
He used to do that to the stomach.

2974
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:21,940
Why don't they do that?

2975
01:15:21,941 --> 01:15:23,140
That opens up the neck.

2976
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,020
People forget about it and you
don't need to think about too.

2977
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:26,291
Yeah,

2978
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:26,680
it's true.

2979
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:30,250
Totally because those are
some serious kicks in.

2980
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:31,780
You're breathing,

2981
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:32,613
but he does it.

2982
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:35,440
They never did create some
space in America is so strong.

2983
01:15:35,441 --> 01:15:37,420
Wrestling mats had a flying Kung Fu here.

2984
01:15:37,421 --> 01:15:40,550
This guy's too greasy and he's got us.

2985
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:41,620
Oh triangle.

2986
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,790
Oh,

2987
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:44,710
you had it for a second.

2988
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:45,544
He's trying.

2989
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,710
He's trying to throw some shit up there.

2990
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:48,340
It is.

2991
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,790
So receives throwing some shit up.

2992
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,000
Kevin has in his corner.

2993
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:52,810
Very.

2994
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:54,010
Connie's must be,

2995
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:54,853
Huh?

2996
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:56,260
Yeah,

2997
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,030
100% but of course.

2998
01:15:58,031 --> 01:15:59,150
But how's your boy Dan harder.

2999
01:15:59,151 --> 01:15:59,940
You still talk to him?

3000
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:00,330
Eddie,

3001
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:01,230
you in touch with him at all?

3002
01:16:01,231 --> 01:16:02,290
I haven't talked to him in a while,

3003
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,810
but he seems to be doing
great as a commentator.

3004
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,051
Yeah,

3005
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:05,571
he's doing great.

3006
01:16:05,571 --> 01:16:06,291
He's really good at it.

3007
01:16:06,291 --> 01:16:06,880
He's a,

3008
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,260
but he's got a book out too.

3009
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:08,771
What does it say?

3010
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:10,660
Like half reptile or something like that.

3011
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:12,130
50% reptile.

3012
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:14,850
I forget what it's mixed martial
arts on conspiracy theory.

3013
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:15,793
That life.

3014
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:21,360
It's got to go for a triangle right here
and he's got a fucking madame theories.

3015
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:24,280
Part reptile part reptiles.

3016
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:25,210
It's about his life story.

3017
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:26,650
So UFC,

3018
01:16:26,651 --> 01:16:27,484
MMA in me,

3019
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:28,610
part rep talk.

3020
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:29,890
I feel like it's a bad name for a book.

3021
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:30,731
I don't know.

3022
01:16:30,731 --> 01:16:33,070
Maybe he's got a personalization for it.

3023
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:34,763
Lizard man.

3024
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:35,320
Damn,

3025
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,130
this is a,

3026
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:38,080
this is a terrible
position for Jason Knight.

3027
01:16:38,081 --> 01:16:38,710
Just,

3028
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:39,543
it's losing.

3029
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,650
Honey is not doing Jack Shit.

3030
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:42,543
It doesn't matter.

3031
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,280
But Jason Wright is
threatening off of his back.

3032
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,143
Oh,

3033
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:47,403
there we go.

3034
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:49,140
Jamie gets caught with the crack head.

3035
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,360
That's actually quite New York crackhead,

3036
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:51,671
right?

3037
01:16:51,671 --> 01:16:52,504
They're

3038
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:55,270
like,

3039
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:56,740
what is our mayor county going to do here?

3040
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:58,030
He's trying to stack them and,

3041
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,100
and just pressure through
and just survive here.

3042
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,850
Look at him and shit like that.

3043
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:02,980
He's not doing anything.

3044
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:04,210
This is what you guys want it though.

3045
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:04,770
Yeah.

3046
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:07,000
I want to stand it up.

3047
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:07,980
Oh.

3048
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:09,883
Oh

3049
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:11,031
right.

3050
01:17:11,031 --> 01:17:12,820
When we were talking about Mark Goddard,

3051
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:17,740
how Jesus was complaining White Dude,

3052
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:18,680
he's not doing shit.

3053
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:19,770
He wasn't doing shit.

3054
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,633
That is true.

3055
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,570
Jesus Christ.

3056
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:26,000
How dare you stand them up for action.

3057
01:17:26,001 --> 01:17:27,350
How dare you.

3058
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:28,880
There's action on the ground.

3059
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:29,231
Well,

3060
01:17:29,231 --> 01:17:30,200
I like this action.

3061
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:30,470
Oh,

3062
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:31,160
he's stunned him.

3063
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:31,993
He's done them.

3064
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:35,900
Connie,

3065
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:39,830
please could take him down and while
he wants some points while he's getting

3066
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:40,664
them,

3067
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:41,601
I mean that's a,

3068
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:43,460
that's literally always been
able to do in this fight.

3069
01:17:43,461 --> 01:17:44,150
Other than that,

3070
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:44,901
a couple of jabs,

3071
01:17:44,901 --> 01:17:45,920
he landed in the first round.

3072
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:46,783
True.

3073
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:48,183
Beaten them.

3074
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:49,123
Stand up.

3075
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:49,631
Oh,

3076
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:50,650
it's gone for a leg lock.

3077
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:52,820
That's a tough sell.

3078
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:55,670
He's got to do something.

3079
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:56,883
Yeah,

3080
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:57,710
a this now.

3081
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:58,191
Oh Dude,

3082
01:17:58,191 --> 01:17:59,024
for sure.

3083
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,253
But it's weird.

3084
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:01,071
He's losing the fight.

3085
01:18:01,071 --> 01:18:02,090
But what the fuck is con,

3086
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:02,520
uh,

3087
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:02,841
I'm here.

3088
01:18:02,841 --> 01:18:04,040
Connie done taking them down.

3089
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:04,874
But that's it.

3090
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:05,803
Is that enough?

3091
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:11,930
It's just being on top of it
enough when the guy on top,

3092
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:14,720
but he did get the tape
that you got to take down.

3093
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,160
But it's not good enough.

3094
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:16,670
It's not.

3095
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:18,170
It is in our common sport.

3096
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:22,730
But how much of this should be scored
with Jason Knight controlling off of his

3097
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:24,950
back and going for
submissions versus I'm here.

3098
01:18:24,951 --> 01:18:26,870
Connie literally here doing nothing.

3099
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:27,530
Zero.

3100
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:29,180
But he has can control top control.

3101
01:18:29,181 --> 01:18:29,660
Right.

3102
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:29,990
But,

3103
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:31,370
but also anybody's control though.

3104
01:18:31,371 --> 01:18:32,181
He's just on top.

3105
01:18:32,181 --> 01:18:36,020
He doesn't have any control but just doing
anything but holding him in the spot.

3106
01:18:36,021 --> 01:18:36,441
But Jason,

3107
01:18:36,441 --> 01:18:37,160
nice thought landing.

3108
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:37,401
He's not,

3109
01:18:37,401 --> 01:18:38,470
when he's trying,

3110
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:43,460
he's at least trying to be offensive
off of his back and Connie's literally

3111
01:18:43,461 --> 01:18:44,294
doing nothing.

3112
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,100
Like all he's doing is holding on here.

3113
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:46,371
Look,

3114
01:18:46,371 --> 01:18:47,380
that's what you guys wanted.

3115
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:48,140
But Hey,

3116
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,990
that's part of this
port lands a shot there.

3117
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:52,520
He lands a shot that's good for him.

3118
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,593
That's good for him.

3119
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:55,670
But Jason Knight is being way more active.

3120
01:18:55,671 --> 01:18:55,910
Amir.

3121
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:57,230
Connie thrown a few shots there.

3122
01:18:57,231 --> 01:18:58,064
Asked.

3123
01:18:58,250 --> 01:18:58,431
Yeah.

3124
01:18:58,431 --> 01:18:59,190
Now he passed.

3125
01:18:59,190 --> 01:18:59,870
Yeah,

3126
01:18:59,870 --> 01:19:00,130
I'm,

3127
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:00,951
I'm with you man.

3128
01:19:00,951 --> 01:19:02,320
But there was a boy,

3129
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:02,931
they score it.

3130
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:03,321
Look out.

3131
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,101
Look out for Jason Nights.

3132
01:19:04,101 --> 01:19:04,934
Neck.

3133
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:05,691
I mean,

3134
01:19:05,691 --> 01:19:06,830
it kind of has this fight easily.

3135
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:07,041
Ooh.

3136
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:08,110
He could have a 10 figure choke.

3137
01:19:08,111 --> 01:19:08,660
You,

3138
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,081
you remember that?

3139
01:19:09,081 --> 01:19:11,270
What does that fucking that step over?

3140
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:11,901
Oh Shit.

3141
01:19:11,901 --> 01:19:12,021
Oh,

3142
01:19:12,021 --> 01:19:12,440
he heard him.

3143
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,240
He hurt him.

3144
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,930
I'm your conduct or legal needle?

3145
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:15,620
Uh,

3146
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,130
I think it was a punch to the suspect.

3147
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:18,830
I think the was to the body,

3148
01:19:18,831 --> 01:19:19,101
wasn't it?

3149
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:19,600
Was it?

3150
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,150
There it is.

3151
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:21,660
Oh No,

3152
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,060
mere county definitely win this fight.

3153
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:24,700
I don't think he's the one he finished.

3154
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,460
What's that?

3155
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,540
What's that technique?

3156
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:26,950
Goddamn,

3157
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:27,470
I can't,

3158
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:27,741
you're,

3159
01:19:27,741 --> 01:19:29,900
you got one arm under the,

3160
01:19:29,901 --> 01:19:30,734
uh,

3161
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:31,341
the,

3162
01:19:31,341 --> 01:19:32,174
the arm,

3163
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,300
one arm over the top and
you step over with the legs.

3164
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:36,230
You know that move.

3165
01:19:36,231 --> 01:19:37,480
Fuck for a proven record.

3166
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,380
That entire time I call
it a 10 figure Cho.

3167
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:41,720
I forgot the proven well
isn't a 10 finger choke?

3168
01:19:41,721 --> 01:19:43,220
The one when it's uh,

3169
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,270
in the chest,

3170
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:48,020
you got him in the chest and you have the
head planted and we should call it the

3171
01:19:48,021 --> 01:19:48,801
10 finger chokes.

3172
01:19:48,801 --> 01:19:52,520
It proved a necktie would for whatever
reason we call it the 10 figures.

3173
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:56,630
Well Tony De Sousa is the reason why
everybody calls it the Peruvian necktie

3174
01:19:56,631 --> 01:20:00,870
because he's got a pet who and there's
a Peruvian darts as well too when if you

3175
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:01,491
oh,

3176
01:20:01,491 --> 01:20:02,150
there it is.

3177
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:02,871
He was out out.

3178
01:20:02,871 --> 01:20:03,704
Huh?

3179
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:04,663
I get pissed off.

3180
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:05,480
Ooh,

3181
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,740
he knocked him down twice.

3182
01:20:06,741 --> 01:20:07,060
Yeah,

3183
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:07,550
twice.

3184
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:08,000
But so is

3185
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:08,311
it a 10,

3186
01:20:08,311 --> 01:20:13,311
eight round that first Peter to draw it
could be a draw to draw this guy from

3187
01:20:13,711 --> 01:20:14,544
the UK.

3188
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:14,930
No,

3189
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:15,640
fill out.

3190
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:15,751
Oh,

3191
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:17,240
he's not from the UK so hey,

3192
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:17,970
maybe David.

3193
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:18,340
Kevin.

3194
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:19,380
Ah Nah.

3195
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:21,960
I bet Jason that it
loses the fight decision.

3196
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:23,580
Could be,

3197
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:24,413
could be

3198
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:28,903
interesting.

3199
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:36,183
Dom Tom,

3200
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:37,483
what do you think?

3201
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,200
They're probably going to
give it to mirror Kami.

3202
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:41,363
This his name.

3203
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:42,331
I'm here.

3204
01:20:42,331 --> 01:20:43,164
Connie.

3205
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,340
My probably give it down.

3206
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:45,543
Yeah,

3207
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:46,980
he got the take downs.

3208
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:47,311
You know,

3209
01:20:47,311 --> 01:20:48,600
he didn't do anything on top,

3210
01:20:48,601 --> 01:20:50,880
but those take downs count.

3211
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:51,963
Yeah.

3212
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:55,863
Yeah.

3213
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,113
Interesting.

3214
01:20:58,450 --> 01:20:59,800
Now is that the coal Maine,

3215
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:01,481
do you remember?

3216
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:02,170
That's fine.

3217
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:03,070
Do you remember that guy?

3218
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:03,904
That was more,

3219
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:04,540
I think the,

3220
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:09,540
the first gear teen master in Nma
was that little pecan Kenya Guy.

3221
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:11,201
Do you remember him?

3222
01:21:11,201 --> 01:21:13,150
He used to fight and shoot
a little Brazilian guy.

3223
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,130
His name was Antonio Nogueira.

3224
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,630
Oh yeah.

3225
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:17,430
I can,

3226
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:19,190
I forget guillotine.

3227
01:21:19,191 --> 01:21:20,920
So many motherfuckers.

3228
01:21:20,921 --> 01:21:21,790
I think he was uh,

3229
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:22,751
an Andrea Penna,

3230
01:21:22,751 --> 01:21:24,520
Doris Guy from Nova.

3231
01:21:24,521 --> 01:21:25,840
You young remember him?

3232
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:29,410
He was a guy that if you shot in on him,

3233
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:33,310
he was going to guillotine you and he
had his own special 10 finger guillotine.

3234
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,030
He called.

3235
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:35,300
I don't know exactly how he did.

3236
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:35,831
You know,

3237
01:21:35,831 --> 01:21:39,160
everyone's got like their own little
modifications for guillotines cause you

3238
01:21:39,161 --> 01:21:41,290
really can't see the grip
when you got a guillotine.

3239
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,730
The grip is actually hidden.

3240
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:43,570
You really don't,

3241
01:21:43,571 --> 01:21:43,681
you,

3242
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:45,940
it's a hard to tell what kind
of guilting you putting in.

3243
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,940
Even with the high elbow
guillotines and Marcella,

3244
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,103
Marcella teen,

3245
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:50,560
it's,

3246
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,850
it's hard to tell if you're holding it
like this or like this because the grip

3247
01:21:54,851 --> 01:21:55,684
is hidden.

3248
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,190
Secret guillotines and the way
that pit Kango Nogueira did it,

3249
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:01,850
man.

3250
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:02,830
I still don't,

3251
01:22:02,831 --> 01:22:03,880
I still a,

3252
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:05,011
I don't remember.

3253
01:22:05,011 --> 01:22:07,120
It's like weird little secret grip.

3254
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,740
Did you ever get into the Pretzel Grip?

3255
01:22:08,741 --> 01:22:09,220
Did you,

3256
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:10,570
will you a big on that,

3257
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,030
that weird grip where the,

3258
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:12,580
the,

3259
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:17,580
the palm of the bottom hand is facing
outward and the palm of the topics that

3260
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:19,060
towards you.

3261
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:19,900
That's a great,

3262
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,280
that's a great grip.

3263
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:23,510
If you get your hands together,

3264
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:24,461
that's a great grip.

3265
01:22:24,461 --> 01:22:25,810
But the reason why Marcello,

3266
01:22:25,811 --> 01:22:27,640
instead of going here,

3267
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,170
he goes here.

3268
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,510
That's the difference is,

3269
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:32,110
is when you go here,

3270
01:22:32,111 --> 01:22:34,660
you need your palms to meet.

3271
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:35,950
So if,

3272
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:37,480
if there's a guy here,

3273
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:38,070
uh,

3274
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:40,900
and I'm trying to guillotine and the
first thing he's going to do is bring up

3275
01:22:40,901 --> 01:22:42,100
his hands like this,

3276
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:42,401
right?

3277
01:22:42,401 --> 01:22:44,620
And he's going to defend
a guillotine like this.

3278
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,370
So his first move is going
to be to come between your,

3279
01:22:48,371 --> 01:22:49,204
your hands,

3280
01:22:49,210 --> 01:22:49,481
right?

3281
01:22:49,481 --> 01:22:51,310
So if you could beat his hand,

3282
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:53,470
then you're good and this is amazing.

3283
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:55,690
But if you don't beat his hand,

3284
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,650
beat his hand,

3285
01:22:56,650 --> 01:22:58,060
then the guillotine is lost.

3286
01:22:58,061 --> 01:22:59,630
But if he comes up and,

3287
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,160
and,

3288
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:03,430
and blocks it like this and I
come around the back of my hand,

3289
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,420
he still fucked.

3290
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:06,130
So it's a sense of security

3291
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,180
split decision.

3292
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:07,540
I'm here,

3293
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:08,373
Connie.

3294
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:09,783
Interesting.

3295
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:13,163
Interesting.

3296
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,333
Yeah.

3297
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,450
Does that make sense on the grip?

3298
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:16,350
Yes it does.

3299
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:16,710
Um,

3300
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:19,470
the also to like the same
as like with a rear naked,

3301
01:23:19,471 --> 01:23:21,450
it's like if you could
keep that hand flat,

3302
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,190
it's easy to slide it up in there.

3303
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:26,250
Then if you got it like this where
it's hard to get underneath the chin.

3304
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:30,000
I'm not too sure about
that with the guillotine.

3305
01:23:30,001 --> 01:23:32,300
It's just a lot of people do
it with the Pretzel Grip here.

3306
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:33,090
Yeah.

3307
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:35,520
But you got to get your hands together.

3308
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,300
Marcello Garcia variation.

3309
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,340
It doesn't matter that your
hands are going to come up.

3310
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,330
They think they're safe,

3311
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,640
but we're going behind our own hand.

3312
01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:46,163
So that's what,

3313
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:50,880
that's when Marcello was fucking
people up with that on the daily,

3314
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,650
no one can black belts.

3315
01:23:52,651 --> 01:23:52,801
Well,

3316
01:23:52,801 --> 01:23:53,880
what the fuck is going on?

3317
01:23:53,881 --> 01:23:55,830
I'm defending the Guillotine
and I'm still tapping,

3318
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:56,370
right.

3319
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:59,450
It was the grip they
given to went decision.

3320
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,333
I'm or Connie?

3321
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:01,823
Yeah.

3322
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,330
That's tough for a,

3323
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:07,903
yeah.

3324
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:09,533
What are you going to do?

3325
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:11,610
Okay.

3326
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:12,530
The Cub Swanson.

3327
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:15,360
Zoe said yes.

3328
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:17,340
Okay.

3329
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:18,810
That's not a good move for him.

3330
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,510
No Cub Swanson Zone.

3331
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,690
Another was he calling out?

3332
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:25,320
I Dunno know Jimmy Marijuana.

3333
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,870
I'll say it's up to the Jimmy Manoa.

3334
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:37,770
I know.

3335
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:39,070
See crazy guys like this.

3336
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:40,720
Uh,

3337
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:41,470
what's the next fight?

3338
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:42,550
He's talking about an old story.

3339
01:24:42,551 --> 01:24:42,950
What Jimmy mean?

3340
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:43,520
Man.

3341
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,620
What did the rest of the ground

3342
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:50,560
amazing Arnold Alan verse.

3343
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:53,030
Mads Brunel and show up the card.

3344
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:53,873
Pull up the card.

3345
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:56,680
Yeah,

3346
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,440
he's probably delirious
from that upper cut.

3347
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,650
Aljamain

3348
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:02,600
he's trying to get a
fight with Dominick Cruz.

3349
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,560
He's a bad motherfucker.

3350
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,230
Aljamain I liked how he bounced back
from that model and Mariah's fight too.

3351
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:08,720
He bounced back.

3352
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:09,720
Marlin memorize.

3353
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,590
Where's Jimmy Rivera coming up?

3354
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:14,260
I think that's next week at
the mother fucking fight.

3355
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:14,891
Yeah,

3356
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:15,641
it is next week,

3357
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:16,474
right?

3358
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:18,370
Is that next week?

3359
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:19,550
Thanks.

3360
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:22,880
So do we need to fight night fight
companion for that mother fucker?

3361
01:25:22,881 --> 01:25:26,040
Or what day is that Jimmy
Rivera as a mother fucker.

3362
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:26,860
He's a beast.

3363
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:27,670
What Day is that?

3364
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:28,470
Is that Saturday?

3365
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:29,830
June 1st Friday night.

3366
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,960
June 1st I'm in town.

3367
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:32,883
You in town?

3368
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:33,760
I'm in town.

3369
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:37,370
That's to try and get weird son zeroes.

3370
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:38,430
I mean sit and talk about it.

3371
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:40,260
Oh yeah.

3372
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:41,981
Fuck yeah man.

3373
01:25:41,981 --> 01:25:43,390
Let's do that as calen in town.

3374
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:45,460
Callan's hustling right now.

3375
01:25:45,461 --> 01:25:47,530
Getting ready to do a special
writing or special in July.

3376
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:48,473
Woo.

3377
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,560
Woo.

3378
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:51,700
He's ready.

3379
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:52,210
He's ready.

3380
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:53,980
He said he's amped up best he's ever been.

3381
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,083
That's awesome.

3382
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:55,590
Your boy.

3383
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:56,530
Uh Yeah.

3384
01:25:56,531 --> 01:25:58,690
Hopefully you get picked
up by Netflix or showtime.

3385
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,030
Your boy Joey Diaz last night on fire.

3386
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:06,140
Just plain thrower.

3387
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:07,413
I was like,

3388
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:09,000
he's on fire right now.

3389
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:14,900
I just put Jesus Christ Joseph still
fucking around to like still like trying

3390
01:26:14,901 --> 01:26:15,950
new shit on stage.

3391
01:26:15,951 --> 01:26:18,440
He was telling me that cause Netflix,

3392
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:19,670
some of the references he has,

3393
01:26:19,671 --> 01:26:19,941
they're like,

3394
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:20,774
you can't say this,

3395
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:21,680
you need to change this.

3396
01:26:21,681 --> 01:26:22,940
So he's messing with that.

3397
01:26:22,941 --> 01:26:24,540
Like how to hit the joke.

3398
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:26,210
Still using that context.

3399
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:27,440
What references are they?

3400
01:26:27,441 --> 01:26:28,274
Uh,

3401
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:29,413
I don't want to give away.

3402
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,553
Yeah.

3403
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:30,921
Eddie,

3404
01:26:30,921 --> 01:26:32,030
you round next Friday.

3405
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:33,380
The first June 1st,

3406
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:34,430
which doing next Friday night,

3407
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:35,181
next Friday.

3408
01:26:35,181 --> 01:26:36,110
I'm in San Francisco.

3409
01:26:36,111 --> 01:26:36,944
It sounds Tripoli.

3410
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:37,840
You should cancel it.

3411
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:43,540
What's happening is you're looking at
Jimmy Rivera versus Marlin Mariah's son.

3412
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:46,383
That's going to be good.

3413
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:47,953
That is a good fight.

3414
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:49,490
Jake Ellenberger.

3415
01:26:49,491 --> 01:26:54,491
Ben Saunders doubled the old to Solon
added fighting to have that spot in San

3416
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:56,660
Francisco.

3417
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:57,620
I'd be cornering.

3418
01:26:57,621 --> 01:26:58,110
Ben,

3419
01:26:58,110 --> 01:26:59,620
you're losing a lot of standup,

3420
01:26:59,630 --> 01:26:59,871
man.

3421
01:26:59,871 --> 01:27:02,240
This is not a lot enough.

3422
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:02,571
Like,

3423
01:27:02,571 --> 01:27:02,910
I see.

3424
01:27:02,910 --> 01:27:04,780
You're not like a real comedian.

3425
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:06,330
Real comedians go out all the time.

3426
01:27:06,331 --> 01:27:06,920
Right?

3427
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:07,461
I'm like,

3428
01:27:07,461 --> 01:27:07,730
uh,

3429
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:09,870
I'm like below an open miker.

3430
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:10,670
You know what I mean?

3431
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:11,600
Are you enjoying it?

3432
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:12,260
I love it.

3433
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:13,040
I love it.

3434
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,350
The show we did a Friday
night in the belly room.

3435
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:17,120
That was the most fun I've ever had.

3436
01:27:17,121 --> 01:27:17,421
Man.

3437
01:27:17,421 --> 01:27:19,080
That was so much fun.

3438
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:24,230
Is it all just conspiracy theory stand up,

3439
01:27:24,231 --> 01:27:26,960
because I know you guys are calling
it tinfoil hat conspiracy night.

3440
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:28,760
Is that just because of the podcast name?

3441
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:29,720
It's,

3442
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:30,290
it's um,

3443
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:32,420
it's more designed to,

3444
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:33,650
it's not,

3445
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:34,340
you know,

3446
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:37,130
there's a lot of a conspiracy
theory comedy in there,

3447
01:27:37,131 --> 01:27:38,050
but you know,

3448
01:27:38,410 --> 01:27:39,140
you know,

3449
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:41,120
it's not like 100%,

3450
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:41,930
you know,

3451
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:42,920
but you guys do fit,

3452
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:44,060
you take fan questions too,

3453
01:27:44,061 --> 01:27:44,361
right.

3454
01:27:44,361 --> 01:27:45,500
So you can go hard in the paint.

3455
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:46,190
Yeah.

3456
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:50,120
At the end we do a question and answer
type of like a mini podcast thing.

3457
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,260
Yeah.

3458
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:51,831
It's fun.

3459
01:27:51,831 --> 01:27:53,810
Friday night at the belly
room was so much fun,

3460
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:54,051
man.

3461
01:27:54,051 --> 01:27:55,330
It was awesome.

3462
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:56,630
It's such an amazing room.

3463
01:27:56,631 --> 01:27:57,980
That's the truth serum room.

3464
01:27:58,360 --> 01:27:58,670
It,

3465
01:27:58,670 --> 01:28:00,470
if your jokes are like fat,

3466
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,390
if they have too much extra words in them,

3467
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:03,790
if they're too fake,

3468
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:05,060
if they come off Corny,

3469
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:05,901
that bedroom,

3470
01:28:05,901 --> 01:28:06,591
just highlight,

3471
01:28:06,591 --> 01:28:07,424
can feel it.

3472
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:09,200
I've always liked to run my,

3473
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:11,630
my material in that room
before I do anything.

3474
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:12,860
Joey did his short,

3475
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:13,310
uh,

3476
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:14,550
I've never been in that room in the,

3477
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:15,381
in the ice house.

3478
01:28:15,381 --> 01:28:15,711
The one,

3479
01:28:15,711 --> 01:28:16,250
not the Ma,

3480
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:17,630
the big room they did in the small,

3481
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:18,401
it's almost like the bell.

3482
01:28:18,401 --> 01:28:18,810
The room.

3483
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:19,200
Yes.

3484
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,880
House.

3485
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:20,713
That's where he did it.

3486
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,010
That room's amazing.

3487
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:23,840
That's what we just done
that a couple of times.

3488
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:24,500
A Joey too.

3489
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,230
That's a great one.

3490
01:28:25,230 --> 01:28:26,063
It's a great room.

3491
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:28,760
When I opened for Joey,

3492
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:33,630
I love it because it's
probably 90% Latin and I love,

3493
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:34,970
I love telling Mexican jokes.

3494
01:28:34,971 --> 01:28:36,320
I got so many Mexican stories.

3495
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:37,550
It's just all fun.

3496
01:28:37,551 --> 01:28:39,200
There's no conspiracy theories going on.

3497
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:42,410
And with those crowds
crowds to like 90% Latin.

3498
01:28:42,411 --> 01:28:43,090
Really?

3499
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:44,120
No last night was it?

3500
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:44,600
No,

3501
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,710
it seemed like it was when it's
interesting like in Ontario,

3502
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:49,880
Ontario's 9% Latin,

3503
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:51,441
two hours,

3504
01:28:51,441 --> 01:28:52,280
a lot of fun.

3505
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:55,430
It's a great room until levity in Oxnard,

3506
01:28:55,500 --> 01:29:00,500
a lot of Lake Ontario podcast last week.

3507
01:29:00,651 --> 01:29:01,484
And he said that

3508
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:04,110
that because of you,

3509
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:04,321
you,

3510
01:29:04,321 --> 01:29:04,610
you,

3511
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:08,280
he said that he was telling you that
Russian mafia story and then you said you

3512
01:29:08,281 --> 01:29:09,061
should do it on stage.

3513
01:29:09,061 --> 01:29:09,894
And then he did it and it,

3514
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:12,090
and it blew up at Russian mob story.

3515
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,500
And then I remembered I go,

3516
01:29:13,501 --> 01:29:16,480
you know what Joe told me to
do that bleeding asshole story

3517
01:29:18,510 --> 01:29:20,280
problem with blood coming out of my ass.

3518
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:22,200
So I told them what,

3519
01:29:22,201 --> 01:29:23,790
how I fixed it and he goes,

3520
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:24,001
dude,

3521
01:29:24,001 --> 01:29:25,200
you got to do that onstage.

3522
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:25,621
And I'm like,

3523
01:29:25,621 --> 01:29:26,410
no.

3524
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:28,620
At the first my first
reaction was like fuck no,

3525
01:29:28,621 --> 01:29:30,150
I'm not going to talk about that on stage,

3526
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:34,040
but I did it Friday and
it went over well to it.

3527
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:35,040
It's a funny story man.

3528
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:36,600
When you told her I was howling laughing.

3529
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:37,201
That's funny.

3530
01:29:37,201 --> 01:29:38,640
I like you say that like,

3531
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:40,850
oh you should do that bleeding asshole
story and people who are listening,

3532
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:41,940
what the fuck is wrong with these?

3533
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:42,773
Come on.

3534
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:47,550
It's not just a matter of like how you
were telling me the story and when you

3535
01:29:47,551 --> 01:29:48,450
were telling me a story,

3536
01:29:48,451 --> 01:29:49,500
I was cracking up.

3537
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:53,070
I mean I am not a comedy Snob by
any stretch of the imagination.

3538
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,060
I like comedy.

3539
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:57,510
I like things that are funny and
if it happens to be funny for x,

3540
01:29:57,511 --> 01:29:58,680
Y or z reason,

3541
01:29:58,681 --> 01:29:59,580
I don't care.

3542
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:00,653
I just want,

3543
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:01,920
I like to laugh.

3544
01:30:01,950 --> 01:30:03,060
I like funny shit.

3545
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:03,811
I just,

3546
01:30:03,811 --> 01:30:05,400
I don't believe that like,

3547
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:06,270
like there's,

3548
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:08,760
there's certain subjects
that should be off limits.

3549
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:10,980
It's just a matter of how
you approach the subject.

3550
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:12,660
If it's a part of life,

3551
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:17,880
the problem is a lot of subjects are
tainted because a lot of people do bad

3552
01:30:17,881 --> 01:30:20,990
comedy that's like
cheap and easy and they,

3553
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:21,391
they,

3554
01:30:21,391 --> 01:30:21,960
they like,

3555
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,720
they use those subjects instead of,

3556
01:30:24,721 --> 01:30:26,830
because the subjects are
interesting and they,

3557
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:28,470
they have like a real valid point.

3558
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:31,170
They use those subjects because they
know it's going to get a cheap laugh.

3559
01:30:31,171 --> 01:30:34,290
Like a no original thought
was the Fart joke or a cheap,

3560
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:34,621
you know,

3561
01:30:34,621 --> 01:30:35,610
whatever kind of joke.

3562
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:35,911
There's,

3563
01:30:35,911 --> 01:30:37,260
there's a bunch of cheap jokes,

3564
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:41,880
but then there's like a
real live situation when
you have to shit your pants,

3565
01:30:41,881 --> 01:30:42,830
like told her you should.

3566
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:46,410
Fear had a fucking hilarious joke about,

3567
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,600
there was a bridge across,

3568
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:49,380
uh,

3569
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:50,670
in Sydney.

3570
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:51,770
This is crazy bridge.

3571
01:30:51,771 --> 01:30:53,250
It's like two miles long or something.

3572
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:57,060
You walk across it and he was halfway
across the bridge and you had a shit his

3573
01:30:57,061 --> 01:30:59,220
pants and he tell,

3574
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:02,610
told the story and he had an
agent at the time and told them,

3575
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:03,991
that's a shit joke.

3576
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:05,760
You gotta stop doing that joke
and already looked at him.

3577
01:31:05,761 --> 01:31:06,510
He goes,

3578
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:06,781
yeah,

3579
01:31:06,781 --> 01:31:07,890
we're not going to work together anymore.

3580
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:08,790
It just got rid of him.

3581
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:12,510
Just got rid of his agents like get the
fuck Outta here cause I that he told me

3582
01:31:12,511 --> 01:31:12,811
about it.

3583
01:31:12,811 --> 01:31:13,170
I go,

3584
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:13,800
what?

3585
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:17,610
I go that guy I told you to stop doing
that bit cause it was a real story.

3586
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:18,683
I was with him,

3587
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:19,980
we worked together in Sydney.

3588
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:20,880
That's what makes it funny.

3589
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:23,130
I mean but it was a real
story where he had a shit,

3590
01:31:23,131 --> 01:31:26,680
his pants and he was a mile
into itself and it was killing,

3591
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,640
killing and his stupid ass agent was like,

3592
01:31:29,641 --> 01:31:30,361
you know that is a,

3593
01:31:30,361 --> 01:31:31,141
that's a shit joke.

3594
01:31:31,141 --> 01:31:34,750
Should into a shit show because he
doesn't get it because he hears when,

3595
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:39,720
when people are talking about like why
would she send an Asian on sage and

3596
01:31:39,721 --> 01:31:40,554
maternity Asian,

3597
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:43,960
no agent in did it's early.

3598
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:45,943
Why would he,

3599
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:46,793
why would he leave?

3600
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:48,301
He didn't.

3601
01:31:48,301 --> 01:31:49,290
But when look,

3602
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:49,701
here's the,

3603
01:31:49,701 --> 01:31:51,390
there's two stages of your career,

3604
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:51,930
right?

3605
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:54,480
There's a stage where other people
trying to tell you what to do.

3606
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:55,051
They're like,

3607
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:56,370
what do you need to do is wear a tie?

3608
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:57,750
Well you need to do is change your ride.

3609
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,040
What you need to do is go clean.

3610
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:00,910
I went through all that shit too.

3611
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:03,700
And then there's a stage where
they just leave you the fuck alone.

3612
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:06,800
Ari is now in that leave you the fuck.

3613
01:32:06,801 --> 01:32:08,620
Cause he's successful
because he's successful.

3614
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:09,431
When you're successful,

3615
01:32:09,431 --> 01:32:10,370
you can say what you want to do it.

3616
01:32:10,371 --> 01:32:13,420
A few years back he was
in that you might make it,

3617
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:18,100
you might fall apart stage in in an
agent's eyes like agents look at you and

3618
01:32:18,101 --> 01:32:18,311
they go,

3619
01:32:18,311 --> 01:32:18,671
man,

3620
01:32:18,671 --> 01:32:18,971
I don't know.

3621
01:32:18,971 --> 01:32:20,440
Eddie might be able to make it,

3622
01:32:20,441 --> 01:32:21,790
but you're going to have
to change some things.

3623
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:22,870
It would change the way you're dressed.

3624
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:24,030
Change your hair drop.

3625
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:25,990
You were eating as all star bleeding.

3626
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:28,090
Asshole thing is alienating fans,

3627
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:29,020
you know,

3628
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:32,770
and they get it in their head that
they know how to fix your act.

3629
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,210
They're almost always wrong.

3630
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,870
They're almost always
wrong or he's hilarious.

3631
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:37,210
Yeah,

3632
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:38,043
we have the same major.

3633
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:39,820
He didn't tell him either one of us.

3634
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:41,530
Shit already doesn't give a fuck.

3635
01:32:41,531 --> 01:32:42,180
Now,

3636
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:42,851
Ari is like,

3637
01:32:42,851 --> 01:32:44,440
does my favorite example,

3638
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:45,753
he's got a flip phone,

3639
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:48,910
but he's my favorite example
of a dude who got money,

3640
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:52,810
got some fame and some wealth and
got some success and just said,

3641
01:32:52,811 --> 01:32:54,040
fuck you.

3642
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:55,360
I'm doing whatever I want.

3643
01:32:55,361 --> 01:32:55,451
Yeah.

3644
01:32:55,451 --> 01:32:58,030
Bird was saying like a torn was,

3645
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,073
uh,

3646
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:00,400
he was taking some time off.

3647
01:33:00,401 --> 01:33:00,671
He's just,

3648
01:33:00,671 --> 01:33:01,660
he's going somewhere now.

3649
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:02,650
Does he want a toy?

3650
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:03,100
He's like,

3651
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,420
he just needs a certain minimum
and that's all he cares about.

3652
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:06,370
He hits that things out.

3653
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,360
He made his monthly nut or his yearly nut.

3654
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:10,030
He said in the first couple
of weeks of the year,

3655
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,310
they just did a bunch
of theaters and some,

3656
01:33:12,311 --> 01:33:13,250
some good breaks.

3657
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:14,370
No.

3658
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:15,010
Alright.

3659
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:15,521
Shit.

3660
01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:16,354
And he just,

3661
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:19,240
he's got a fucking low overhead man.

3662
01:33:19,241 --> 01:33:20,290
He doesn't have a car.

3663
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:21,490
He lives cheap.

3664
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:22,061
I mean,

3665
01:33:22,061 --> 01:33:22,630
he's just,

3666
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:23,331
he keeps that way.

3667
01:33:23,331 --> 01:33:24,210
It's still in New York.

3668
01:33:24,270 --> 01:33:24,590
Yup.

3669
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:24,940
Yeah,

3670
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:25,570
yeah.

3671
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:26,403
He's hilarious.

3672
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:28,000
He doesn't give a fuck man.

3673
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:29,980
And He loves traveling.

3674
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,150
He loves traveling.

3675
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,140
He's material from it.

3676
01:33:32,141 --> 01:33:32,460
Right?

3677
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:32,550
Well,

3678
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:33,820
it's not just that man.

3679
01:33:33,850 --> 01:33:37,140
He just really enjoys going
to different cultures and be,

3680
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:37,361
I mean,

3681
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:39,940
he went to fucking Asia dude like Asia,

3682
01:33:39,941 --> 01:33:44,941
Asia standing pistils and shit staying
in places where like 18 year old

3683
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:48,760
backpackers go doves like your
feeling that you're in danger.

3684
01:33:48,761 --> 01:33:49,250
He was not.

3685
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:49,811
Not Ever,

3686
01:33:49,811 --> 01:33:50,060
I'm like,

3687
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:50,860
what?

3688
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:51,940
I'm too scared to do that.

3689
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:53,500
I wouldn't want to do that.

3690
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:53,861
Well,

3691
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:55,240
I don't think it's dangerous.

3692
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:57,310
I mean it think it's rarely dangerous,

3693
01:33:57,311 --> 01:33:59,110
but I think any kind of travel,

3694
01:33:59,440 --> 01:33:59,920
I mean,

3695
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,410
I mean I'm talking about
traveling to a bar in,

3696
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:02,920
you know,

3697
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:05,290
Canoga Park could be dangerous.

3698
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:05,741
You know,

3699
01:34:05,741 --> 01:34:06,910
you hear about it in a story.

3700
01:34:06,911 --> 01:34:10,900
Brendan Schaub Joe Rug and go to a bar
and Canoga Joe gets stabbed by some crazy

3701
01:34:10,901 --> 01:34:11,530
person.

3702
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:11,711
Oh,

3703
01:34:11,711 --> 01:34:12,820
don't go to Canoga Park.

3704
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,990
That's not what it is.

3705
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:17,020
It's just like life is
occasionally dangerous.

3706
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:18,040
You know?

3707
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:22,810
I don't think those hostels are most of
those hostels or just college kids that

3708
01:34:22,811 --> 01:34:25,660
are just traveling abroad
and looking to see the world.

3709
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:26,800
I've always been scared of hostels.

3710
01:34:26,801 --> 01:34:28,660
My brother stayed when
you're up until he woke up.

3711
01:34:28,661 --> 01:34:30,370
So in sucking on his toes.

3712
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:34,443
That's scary.

3713
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,060
Well what?

3714
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:39,280
I was scared of it because
of those horror movies,

3715
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,360
the hostel,

3716
01:34:40,361 --> 01:34:40,980
the hostel,

3717
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:42,810
are we fucking terrifying.

3718
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:45,500
Part two's even more sta.

3719
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:46,660
Dude.

3720
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:50,410
How's still is so hostile is brutal man.

3721
01:34:51,130 --> 01:34:52,610
How easy is it to,

3722
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:53,930
to Lord,

3723
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,800
you know those 18 year old
backpackers that are across Europe?

3724
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:01,340
So I'll leave you dude.

3725
01:35:01,341 --> 01:35:04,910
All you gotta do is get hot chicks point
out the dude's a hot chicks would drag

3726
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:05,744
him into some shit.

3727
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:06,620
Put some,

3728
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:10,700
put some drugs in that drinks and book
and two 50 year old and a 35 year old.

3729
01:35:10,701 --> 01:35:11,534
A hot chick.

3730
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:12,500
But Ya,

3731
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:12,681
yeah,

3732
01:35:12,681 --> 01:35:13,514
where are we going

3733
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:15,411
to get it?

3734
01:35:15,411 --> 01:35:18,290
But when you're 20 when you're
21 warm hole in the wall,

3735
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,390
I'm saying easy.

3736
01:35:20,391 --> 01:35:21,260
That's how they got them.

3737
01:35:21,261 --> 01:35:21,920
And hostile.

3738
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:23,180
They just said they just sent chicks.

3739
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:27,830
That's the easy chicks
work every due to fall,

3740
01:35:27,831 --> 01:35:28,300
right?

3741
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:29,540
They'll fall right into it.

3742
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:29,841
Man.

3743
01:35:29,841 --> 01:35:30,950
Chicks with drugs,

3744
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:31,251
you know,

3745
01:35:31,251 --> 01:35:32,420
drink and it's over.

3746
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,930
But I think for a lot of those people
that travel like that and live like that,

3747
01:35:35,931 --> 01:35:40,220
it's gotta be very hard to settle down
once you get used to just traveling.

3748
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:44,900
And doing drugs and partying places and
I feel like that movie doesn't end well

3749
01:35:44,901 --> 01:35:45,500
for those people.

3750
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,240
There's no like real stability.

3751
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:47,751
Oh,

3752
01:35:47,751 --> 01:35:48,960
the meaning of life.

3753
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:49,370
Everyone.

3754
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:50,960
Everyone has their own
movie playing right now.

3755
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:51,171
No,

3756
01:35:51,171 --> 01:35:52,250
it definitely doesn't end well.

3757
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,260
I mean maybe start a pottery
business or some shit

3758
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:57,620
like and pottery.

3759
01:35:58,610 --> 01:35:59,360
What does this one,

3760
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,340
this is another movie that Eli Roth made.

3761
01:36:01,341 --> 01:36:02,151
He also made hostile.

3762
01:36:02,151 --> 01:36:03,090
It's called green inferno.

3763
01:36:03,170 --> 01:36:04,100
I did see this.

3764
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:06,230
Where did they get eaten by?

3765
01:36:06,231 --> 01:36:06,940
Cannibals.

3766
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:08,290
I like to Brazil or somewhere.

3767
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:09,203
Some

3768
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:11,160
don't.

3769
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:11,901
This was breezy.

3770
01:36:11,901 --> 01:36:14,060
It was like some remote location,

3771
01:36:14,061 --> 01:36:15,110
like in the jungle.

3772
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:16,970
I was actually a little
disappointed in this.

3773
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:17,481
The trailer.

3774
01:36:17,481 --> 01:36:17,780
I was like,

3775
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:18,613
Oh shit.

3776
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:21,170
Picture of the head and
the upper left hand corner.

3777
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:24,380
There's some crazy shit that happens
in the movie to send me that.

3778
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:26,240
Send me that a text message,

3779
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:27,230
man to watch.

3780
01:36:27,231 --> 01:36:28,490
Don't you think like Brazil,

3781
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:33,520
like tourism is down 8000%
because of these fucking movies.

3782
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:34,051
You know what I mean?

3783
01:36:34,051 --> 01:36:34,880
It happens though.

3784
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:36,010
Shit does happen,

3785
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:36,651
but you know what?

3786
01:36:36,651 --> 01:36:40,070
Still maybe Brazil was like slow the
fuck down with these goddamn movies,

3787
01:36:40,071 --> 01:36:45,071
but they do have the biggest rain
forest in the world and they do shit.

3788
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:46,650
Fucking Amazon forest.

3789
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:48,913
I couldn't be,

3790
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:51,290
I was a text Tim Kenny and I say,

3791
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:53,600
I can't believe when he's
talking about all of those Nazis.

3792
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:55,910
What the fuck is is that

3793
01:36:57,620 --> 01:36:59,960
they flew from Germany
to fucking Argentina.

3794
01:36:59,961 --> 01:37:01,610
That's a true story until I text them too.

3795
01:37:01,611 --> 01:37:01,851
I went,

3796
01:37:01,851 --> 01:37:02,684
Dude,

3797
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:07,160
you did the greatest promo ever for
your discovery and history channel show.

3798
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:08,000
Cause I really,

3799
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:08,691
I love Tim,

3800
01:37:08,691 --> 01:37:10,310
but I don't watch that much TV with that,

3801
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:14,780
with that stuff he was talking about
those Germans that live in Argentina.

3802
01:37:14,781 --> 01:37:15,590
How many cities,

3803
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:16,340
how many villages?

3804
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:16,971
Don't know what?

3805
01:37:16,971 --> 01:37:17,900
Hundreds of thousands.

3806
01:37:17,901 --> 01:37:19,400
100,000 and you go to the village.

3807
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:21,500
This is an archery term
and it's all German.

3808
01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:22,820
The the architecture.

3809
01:37:22,821 --> 01:37:23,720
We go into the house,

3810
01:37:23,721 --> 01:37:25,490
it's all fucking term images of a chain.

3811
01:37:25,491 --> 01:37:27,560
They don't speak out the
fucking lick of Spanish.

3812
01:37:27,850 --> 01:37:30,540
They were leader hose in that
drink and giant Stein's sure.

3813
01:37:30,690 --> 01:37:32,360
Proud of their history.

3814
01:37:32,361 --> 01:37:32,631
Yeah.

3815
01:37:32,631 --> 01:37:33,464
That's what's creepy.

3816
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:33,750
You know what?

3817
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:34,640
How about he goes,

3818
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:36,080
do you know what built that land?

3819
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:36,620
Juice.

3820
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:37,453
Fucking the,

3821
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:37,780
their,

3822
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:39,110
their cavity to fillings.

3823
01:37:39,111 --> 01:37:40,190
Third Wedding rings.

3824
01:37:40,191 --> 01:37:40,900
That's what built that in.

3825
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:43,130
So what I got so upset man.

3826
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:44,890
And then he's talking about how uh,

3827
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:46,790
the have they would torture kids.

3828
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:47,270
I just to,

3829
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:48,260
I stopped listening at that.

3830
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:49,730
I'm out.

3831
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:49,881
Well,

3832
01:37:49,881 --> 01:37:54,881
he was talking about how Mengele and a
lot of the SS soldiers went to Argentina

3833
01:37:56,460 --> 01:38:00,540
and continued a lot of their torture
experiments and that they had met some of

3834
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:03,150
the people that had been
tortured by these ss guys.

3835
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:03,991
Horrific,

3836
01:38:03,991 --> 01:38:04,830
horrific boy.

3837
01:38:04,831 --> 01:38:05,670
They break their bones,

3838
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:07,140
bring her son back to health,

3839
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:08,430
set them on fire.

3840
01:38:08,431 --> 01:38:11,460
Just the worst shit you can imagine
just to see like what they could do.

3841
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:12,630
I went to Argentina like,

3842
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:12,910
oh,

3843
01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:14,010
like 10 years ago.

3844
01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:15,240
And I swear,

3845
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:16,260
I swear to God,

3846
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:21,320
I've never been to a country with so many
beautiful women on believe will say no

3847
01:38:22,541 --> 01:38:22,950
more there.

3848
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:23,790
And it's like there's,

3849
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:25,650
you see like 10 at a time,

3850
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:26,250
13,

3851
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:27,210
they're like everywhere.

3852
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:31,440
And you would think you would think
it would be easy to pick them up.

3853
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:36,030
But it's super hard because they
have no faith in men because the men,

3854
01:38:36,031 --> 01:38:36,631
they're like,

3855
01:38:36,631 --> 01:38:37,980
prostitution is legal.

3856
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:38,770
Yeah.

3857
01:38:38,770 --> 01:38:42,600
They know that there's no reason for a
guy to to get committed so they don't

3858
01:38:42,601 --> 01:38:43,230
trust guys.

3859
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:43,741
So they're like,

3860
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:44,574
just,

3861
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,650
that was my experience that
they just like hang out.

3862
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:49,740
They hang out with each other and
they just cock block each wild wiener.

3863
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:51,090
They travel,

3864
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:52,170
cock blocked each other,

3865
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:55,110
they travel in packs everywhere.

3866
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:57,080
It's incredible blessing.

3867
01:38:57,110 --> 01:38:58,010
They're only touching gone.

3868
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:00,900
I'd love to go to Argentina.

3869
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:01,741
You,

3870
01:39:01,741 --> 01:39:02,341
you watch this.

3871
01:39:02,341 --> 01:39:02,591
It's,

3872
01:39:02,591 --> 01:39:03,600
it's crazy man.

3873
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:05,930
And [inaudible] and Tim said
you'd go there and you know,

3874
01:39:05,931 --> 01:39:06,110
they're,

3875
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:07,140
they're like so,

3876
01:39:07,410 --> 01:39:10,740
so proud of their Nazi
grandfather and stuff like that.

3877
01:39:10,741 --> 01:39:11,341
And Tim's like,

3878
01:39:11,341 --> 01:39:12,480
what the fuck man,

3879
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:13,500
that's crazy.

3880
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:14,370
Crazy.

3881
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:15,661
No,

3882
01:39:15,661 --> 01:39:15,960
no,

3883
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:16,171
no,

3884
01:39:16,171 --> 01:39:17,730
not a lick of Spanish anywhere.

3885
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:18,870
And Hitler may be,

3886
01:39:18,871 --> 01:39:19,290
uh,

3887
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:19,650
you know,

3888
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:19,841
yeah,

3889
01:39:19,841 --> 01:39:20,410
that's,

3890
01:39:20,410 --> 01:39:21,091
Joe asked him,

3891
01:39:21,091 --> 01:39:21,480
he goes,

3892
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:22,770
if you have to decide right now,

3893
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:23,850
did Hitler die in that Bin on?

3894
01:39:23,851 --> 01:39:24,770
Like history tells you,

3895
01:39:24,771 --> 01:39:26,520
and this is Tim Kennedy.

3896
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:27,690
He's never told a lie in his life.

3897
01:39:27,691 --> 01:39:28,230
He goes,

3898
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:28,501
nope,

3899
01:39:28,501 --> 01:39:30,780
history's wrong on this one day.

3900
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,130
And he'd be so happy about
what that history is wrong.

3901
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:37,470
History is often wrong.

3902
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:40,710
That's what I'm saying is
during Kennedy approves it,

3903
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:41,730
it's fucking,

3904
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:42,563
we going sizzler.

3905
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,640
[inaudible] he's never
told a lie on the sizzler.

3906
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:46,770
Tim Kelley's never told a line is live.

3907
01:39:47,310 --> 01:39:48,143
Are you sure?

3908
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:48,721
Oh Dude.

3909
01:39:48,721 --> 01:39:49,554
Tim Kenny says,

3910
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:52,770
I mean he's as American pies it gets,

3911
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:53,723
yeah,

3912
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:54,631
I love that guy,

3913
01:39:54,631 --> 01:39:55,350
man.

3914
01:39:55,350 --> 01:39:57,180
I cried because I thought
he's going to die one time.

3915
01:39:58,230 --> 01:39:58,850
I love him.

3916
01:39:58,850 --> 01:39:59,050
Yeah.

3917
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:03,420
He doesn't have a crazy show that
where he tries to kill himself.

3918
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:04,470
They tried to kill him.

3919
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:05,640
Like what's the name of that show?

3920
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:07,203
Uh,

3921
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:10,231
what's it called?

3922
01:40:10,231 --> 01:40:14,130
It's like some show where someone almost
died and then jumps out of planes.

3923
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:14,820
Yes,

3924
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:15,300
yes.

3925
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:15,441
Oh,

3926
01:40:15,441 --> 01:40:18,510
you a bull fighting hard
to hard to kill Tim Canada.

3927
01:40:18,511 --> 01:40:20,010
And that's what Steven Seagal movie,

3928
01:40:20,011 --> 01:40:20,550
isn't it?

3929
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:20,791
Yeah,

3930
01:40:20,791 --> 01:40:21,750
it is terrible movie.

3931
01:40:22,590 --> 01:40:22,980
All those,

3932
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:23,813
a fan as a kid,

3933
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:24,151
but yet,

3934
01:40:24,151 --> 01:40:27,840
and then he also has hunting
Hitler on the history channel down.

3935
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:30,670
He's a beast man.

3936
01:40:30,910 --> 01:40:31,950
And then he's still serving,

3937
01:40:31,970 --> 01:40:34,330
doing like secret missions and
killing people on the side.

3938
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:35,471
His side,

3939
01:40:35,471 --> 01:40:36,610
chicks killing isis.

3940
01:40:36,850 --> 01:40:37,420
That's what he does.

3941
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:38,253
What he,

3942
01:40:38,510 --> 01:40:43,270
he's still active special forces
going on projects and shit.

3943
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:45,460
Killing people corralled.

3944
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:45,910
Yeah.

3945
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:46,743
Hell yeah.

3946
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:47,613
Damn

3947
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:50,020
Dude's another level.

3948
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:52,841
Yeah.

3949
01:40:52,841 --> 01:40:53,110
Wait,

3950
01:40:53,110 --> 01:40:54,190
this main event man,

3951
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:56,280
is it hard kind of bullshit,

3952
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:56,860
man.

3953
01:40:56,860 --> 01:40:59,280
God Dog and magnifies an accident.

3954
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:00,490
Well thanks for that.

3955
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:05,590
So how standup gun,

3956
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:06,500
it's good man.

3957

Grinding every week.

3958
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:09,883
Yeah.

3959
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:13,930
Last week for this week folks
approach you for a special?

3960
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:15,513
Nope.

3961
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:16,300
Not yet.

3962
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:16,691
Not yet,

3963
01:41:16,691 --> 01:41:16,891
man.

3964
01:41:16,891 --> 01:41:17,740
He a little ways to go.

3965
01:41:17,741 --> 01:41:19,510
And you've been doing
comedy now for a year?

3966
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:20,320
Two years.

3967
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:20,890
Two years.

3968
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:21,723
Two years.

3969
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:22,690
It's been two years.

3970
01:41:22,691 --> 01:41:23,310
Shit,

3971
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:26,860
two years I've been doing live
fire the kids for over three years.

3972
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,150
That's where it started.

3973
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:29,020
Yeah.

3974
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:29,411
Yeah.

3975
01:41:29,411 --> 01:41:29,861
Damn.

3976
01:41:29,861 --> 01:41:30,011
I,

3977
01:41:30,011 --> 01:41:32,230
for some reason I thought you
were doing standup for a year.

3978
01:41:32,350 --> 01:41:33,090
I've been doing it.

3979
01:41:33,090 --> 01:41:35,290
My first spot was at the comedy store.

3980
01:41:35,291 --> 01:41:36,280
I have it written my phone.

3981
01:41:36,281 --> 01:41:38,110
I'd have to look comedy chaos night.

3982
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:38,910
Uh,

3983
01:41:38,910 --> 01:41:39,211
no,

3984
01:41:39,211 --> 01:41:39,521
it was a,

3985
01:41:39,521 --> 01:41:39,950
it was a,

3986
01:41:39,950 --> 01:41:41,260
they gave me a spot in the belly room,

3987
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:45,190
fastest rising comedian of all time,

3988
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:46,510
right.

3989
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:50,530
With zero standup experience and then
all of a sudden you do standup and now

3990
01:41:50,531 --> 01:41:53,380
you're fucking playing all
over the world making loot.

3991
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:54,273
Right.

3992
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:54,910
It's good.

3993
01:41:54,910 --> 01:41:55,691
You're getting paid,

3994
01:41:55,691 --> 01:41:56,320
right?

3995
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:57,030
Yeah.

3996
01:41:57,030 --> 01:41:57,851
That's almost as good.

3997
01:41:57,851 --> 01:41:58,481
That's incredible.

3998
01:41:58,481 --> 01:42:00,130
I'll never fast fall time.

3999
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:01,333
You could be,

4000
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:07,560
generally you grind for about 10
years until you pop if you do it all,

4001
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:08,981
you know.

4002
01:42:08,981 --> 01:42:09,360
So,

4003
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:12,370
but I think you can do like the Charlie
Sheen route where if you have some sort

4004
01:42:12,371 --> 01:42:12,821
of falling,

4005
01:42:12,821 --> 01:42:13,990
you do shows and then people are like,

4006
01:42:13,991 --> 01:42:14,681
this sucks.

4007
01:42:14,681 --> 01:42:15,514
I don't come back.

4008
01:42:15,850 --> 01:42:19,990
I think the sign of it is that you can
come back to if you sell tickets of

4009
01:42:19,991 --> 01:42:21,250
places you've been before.

4010
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:22,220
You know what I'm saying?

4011
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:22,570
Yeah.

4012
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:23,080
So it's not,

4013
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:24,340
so they know it's not a gimmick.

4014
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:25,353
That's the big thing.

4015
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:25,721
Yeah.

4016
01:42:25,721 --> 01:42:25,901
That's,

4017
01:42:25,901 --> 01:42:27,220
I'm doing it and which I can learn.

4018
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:28,210
It's either way.

4019
01:42:28,210 --> 01:42:28,871
It's incredible.

4020
01:42:28,871 --> 01:42:29,780
Congratulations.

4021
01:42:29,781 --> 01:42:30,770
Thanks for the fucked.

4022
01:42:30,771 --> 01:42:31,610
And I didn't,

4023
01:42:31,910 --> 01:42:32,380
you know,

4024
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:36,760
I was hanging out with Joe
in the comedy scene for many,

4025
01:42:36,761 --> 01:42:37,571
many years.

4026
01:42:37,571 --> 01:42:40,540
I seen comedians just eat shit,

4027
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,410
you know?

4028
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:42,141
Can we crash?

4029
01:42:42,141 --> 01:42:42,350
Yeah,

4030
01:42:42,350 --> 01:42:43,183
come and go.

4031
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,233
Never make it.

4032
01:42:44,930 --> 01:42:48,090
Same guys from 15 years ago still
trying to make it same material.

4033
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,360
What you're doing is incredible,

4034
01:42:49,361 --> 01:42:49,920
man.

4035
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,010
It's unheard of.

4036
01:42:51,011 --> 01:42:51,844
Thanks man.

4037
01:42:51,910 --> 01:42:53,380
Sam was telling me you are killing it.

4038
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,660
The other night I had a
good set Friday night.

4039
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,340
It came together.

4040
01:42:57,610 --> 01:42:58,120
It was a,

4041
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:00,780
it was the first set I did not stoned.

4042
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:02,320
That's good.

4043
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:03,370
So I decided,

4044
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:04,353
you know what,

4045
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:06,910
unless you're really good at something,

4046
01:43:06,911 --> 01:43:08,440
you shouldn't be smoking
weed and doing it.

4047
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:09,251
You know what I mean?

4048
01:43:09,251 --> 01:43:13,360
And until you are super confident
and you got your shit down,

4049
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:14,540
don't smoke week.

4050
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:15,251
You know what I mean?

4051
01:43:15,251 --> 01:43:17,320
So I decided to try it out,

4052
01:43:17,321 --> 01:43:21,210
like not smoke weed and go on stage
and see what happens and earn.

4053
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:21,700
It went good.

4054
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:22,060
It went,

4055
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:25,050
it went better than that
was probably my best set.

4056
01:43:25,051 --> 01:43:25,210
So,

4057
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:27,640
and then you guys are at cobb's on Friday,

4058
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:29,800
Friday at cobb's has never,

4059
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:31,150
never been there a bunch with Joe.

4060
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:32,740
Love Cockins day the best.

4061
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:34,480
You've been there a couple of times.

4062
01:43:34,670 --> 01:43:34,990
Uh,

4063
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:35,590
twice now.

4064
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:36,250
Headline.

4065
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:36,640
Yeah.

4066
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:37,330
Fuck.

4067
01:43:37,330 --> 01:43:37,960
Twice down.

4068
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:38,710
Then I'll be back.

4069
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:39,490
He sell it out.

4070
01:43:39,490 --> 01:43:39,910
Yeah.

4071
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:41,140
Holy Shit.

4072
01:43:41,141 --> 01:43:41,910
That's a 300.

4073
01:43:41,910 --> 01:43:43,000
That's 400 seats.

4074
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:43,630
Yeah.

4075
01:43:43,630 --> 01:43:44,980
God Damn Dude.

4076
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:45,641
Holy Shit.

4077
01:43:45,641 --> 01:43:47,320
Then we do a Saturday,

4078
01:43:47,321 --> 01:43:48,160
we do Sacramento,

4079
01:43:48,161 --> 01:43:48,994
the punchline.

4080
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:50,133
So that's a smaller,

4081
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:53,150
that's like I think 150 to
hundred or something like that.

4082
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:54,050
Uh,

4083
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:54,530
but uh,

4084
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:55,363
yeah.

4085
01:43:55,630 --> 01:43:56,630
Can San Fran to,

4086
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:58,040
until I get my shit together,

4087
01:43:58,041 --> 01:43:58,400
you know,

4088
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:59,480
I'm going to go on stage,

4089
01:43:59,530 --> 01:44:00,363
uh,

4090
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:02,990
clear-eyed or this the smartest route man.

4091
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:03,981
And then later,

4092
01:44:03,981 --> 01:44:04,700
once I,

4093
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:07,580
once I feel super
confident in my material,

4094
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:08,190
um,

4095
01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:09,023
and

4096
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:15,340
my problem is I have way too much material
and it's just scattered everywhere.

4097
01:44:15,650 --> 01:44:16,670
All these ideas,

4098
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:19,130
every day I have new ideas,

4099
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:22,070
but they need to be organized
more and fleshed out.

4100
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,840
And that's what I did for this show too.

4101
01:44:23,841 --> 01:44:24,261
I decided,

4102
01:44:24,261 --> 01:44:24,920
you know what,

4103
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,930
there's just so much
and it's overwhelming.

4104
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:29,180
I just took three pieces,

4105
01:44:29,181 --> 01:44:29,661
pull my goal.

4106
01:44:29,661 --> 01:44:30,930
I'm just going to stick to these three.

4107
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:32,513
Yeah,

4108
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:33,470
exactly,

4109
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:34,130
exactly.

4110
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:34,880
And,

4111
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:35,713
um,

4112
01:44:36,150 --> 01:44:38,000
I've served as great at
helping with that too.

4113
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:41,120
At first I was writing
everything out and then I,

4114
01:44:41,121 --> 01:44:41,741
then Joe,

4115
01:44:41,741 --> 01:44:42,470
he told me,

4116
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:43,100
he goes,

4117
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:43,431
dude,

4118
01:44:43,431 --> 01:44:43,820
you're,

4119
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:48,260
you're at your best when you don't write
it out and you just go off the cuff.

4120
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:48,851
So Joe,

4121
01:44:48,851 --> 01:44:49,684
he told me,

4122
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:53,600
just have ideas but don't write anything
out and just go out there and try it.

4123
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:53,801
And I,

4124
01:44:53,801 --> 01:44:57,480
and I did that and I
think that's for me that,

4125
01:44:57,550 --> 01:44:57,770
you know,

4126
01:44:57,770 --> 01:45:01,460
Friday I just had powerpoints
and a couple of lines like okay,

4127
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:03,890
this line is kind of funny in
that line is kind of funny.

4128
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:07,970
And then I just went off and
just kind of just went for it.

4129
01:45:08,570 --> 01:45:09,260
It worked out great.

4130
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:09,741
It worked out.

4131
01:45:09,741 --> 01:45:10,160
Samsung,

4132
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:12,620
I just doing the ice
house last night was him.

4133
01:45:12,621 --> 01:45:13,250
He said it good.

4134
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:13,740
Oh cool.

4135
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:14,000
Cool.

4136
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,220
You guys write your material out,

4137
01:45:16,670 --> 01:45:17,260
material out.

4138
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:17,541
Well,

4139
01:45:17,541 --> 01:45:17,961
you know what,

4140
01:45:17,961 --> 01:45:21,860
because hanging out with you for
fucking 20 years in the comedy clubs,

4141
01:45:21,861 --> 01:45:22,170
you,

4142
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:22,851
we stress,

4143
01:45:22,851 --> 01:45:23,870
you got to write shit out,

4144
01:45:23,871 --> 01:45:24,720
you got to write shit.

4145
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:25,740
You tell every company,

4146
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:25,941
right?

4147
01:45:25,941 --> 01:45:26,330
Yah.

4148
01:45:26,330 --> 01:45:27,200
So that's what I was doing.

4149
01:45:27,201 --> 01:45:29,640
I was writing everything out and a Joe,

4150
01:45:29,641 --> 01:45:30,121
he told me,

4151
01:45:30,121 --> 01:45:31,040
he goes right now,

4152
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:32,780
maybe you shouldn't write shit out.

4153
01:45:32,781 --> 01:45:34,550
Just go out there and just free ball,

4154
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:35,540
just have some ideas.

4155
01:45:35,541 --> 01:45:35,900
And I said,

4156
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:36,860
are you sure?

4157
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:37,941
And he said yeah.

4158
01:45:37,941 --> 01:45:40,040
So I did a couple of
spots with them at that,

4159
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,083
uh,

4160
01:45:41,330 --> 01:45:42,470
Ontario Improv.

4161
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:44,270
And those are,

4162
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:46,850
those are two of the best
shows I've done with Joey.

4163
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:48,140
So I decided to do that.

4164
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:49,580
Just have instead of write everything out,

4165
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:51,230
maybe write out the funny,

4166
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:52,011
you know what I mean,

4167
01:45:52,011 --> 01:45:57,011
but just kind of go out there and then
repeating the same set over doing new

4168
01:45:57,051 --> 01:45:58,820
sets of written every sets mixed up.

4169
01:45:58,821 --> 01:45:59,654
Different

4170
01:46:00,890 --> 01:46:05,000
bullet points or like what's like say
if you had a bid on building a table,

4171
01:46:05,001 --> 01:46:05,770
whatever.

4172
01:46:05,770 --> 01:46:07,070
Like it's the bullet points,

4173
01:46:07,071 --> 01:46:07,881
the funny parts.

4174
01:46:07,881 --> 01:46:09,770
You have memorized the line,

4175
01:46:09,771 --> 01:46:13,160
like memorize the fund and
then the way you set it up,

4176
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:14,090
you're going to have to Kinda,

4177
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,250
I kinda just go for it
cause it's more natural.

4178
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:16,791
Exactly.

4179
01:46:16,791 --> 01:46:18,590
Cause if you start memorizing shit,

4180
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:19,843
um,

4181
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:22,670
it takes away from the spontaneity.

4182
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:23,350
Yeah.

4183
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:24,183
It just doesn't,

4184
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:24,920
it's not funny.

4185
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,150
You can find it in there though.

4186
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:26,960
The spontaneity.

4187
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,760
Even though you have a
structure you get to play with.

4188
01:46:28,761 --> 01:46:29,270
The one thing,

4189
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:31,370
the one thing that I've
learned for me anyways,

4190
01:46:31,371 --> 01:46:32,330
like I watch,

4191
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:37,040
I still watch Chapelle over and over
and just like you know it for me,

4192
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:41,840
like the latest Chappelle when he tells
a story and he's telling you like a 10

4193
01:46:41,841 --> 01:46:43,460
minute story of how shit went down.

4194
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:44,840
To me that's the funniest.

4195
01:46:44,841 --> 01:46:48,020
She had an actual real
event like the mafia story,

4196
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:49,780
the Russian mafia story
with Bert Kreischer,

4197
01:46:49,790 --> 01:46:50,040
right.

4198
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,720
It's an actual story,

4199
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:51,990
right.

4200
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:54,570
Then you see how real it
is when he's describing it.

4201
01:46:54,571 --> 01:46:57,390
Instead of trying to make up a
joke and trying to find funny,

4202
01:46:57,690 --> 01:47:00,780
stick to funny stories and then that'll,

4203
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:02,520
and then from there you could kind of,

4204
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:03,060
you don't know,

4205
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:06,690
you know Joe shooting mine on Monday
night in Vegas and the shooting six of

4206
01:47:06,691 --> 01:47:07,160
them,

4207
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:07,950
not just six.

4208
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:09,300
So there's six comics,

4209
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:10,290
30 minute specials,

4210
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:12,180
but big j auctions in that.

4211
01:47:12,181 --> 01:47:13,014
Who's hilarious?

4212
01:47:13,230 --> 01:47:14,490
Christina P.

4213
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:15,990
Thompson Barrows wives is in that.

4214
01:47:16,770 --> 01:47:19,190
She's doing that because she
just didn't know Sherry has this.

4215
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:22,050
I wonder why just below
one they'll fuck up.

4216
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:22,411
I know,

4217
01:47:22,411 --> 01:47:25,620
but why not just shave and do an
hour trying to extra bloat that bank,

4218
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:27,420
I love her at that extra blow up.

4219
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:28,831
But with Joe.

4220
01:47:28,831 --> 01:47:29,370
Yeah,

4221
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:29,670
Joey's,

4222
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:30,210
yeah.

4223
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:32,190
And then they shoot to 30 minutes for him.

4224
01:47:32,191 --> 01:47:34,170
He shoots on Monday night in Vegas,

4225
01:47:34,171 --> 01:47:35,040
Sun Room in Vegas.

4226
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:36,540
But when you do those 30 minutes,

4227
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:37,021
cause I,

4228
01:47:37,021 --> 01:47:37,321
you know,

4229
01:47:37,321 --> 01:47:38,790
I'm used to dealing with you and I'm like,

4230
01:47:38,791 --> 01:47:38,911
oh.

4231
01:47:38,911 --> 01:47:39,271
And you're like,

4232
01:47:39,271 --> 01:47:39,961
I'm gonna shoot it here.

4233
01:47:39,961 --> 01:47:40,860
This is what's happening.

4234
01:47:41,070 --> 01:47:41,520
And there's,

4235
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:41,731
you know,

4236
01:47:41,731 --> 01:47:43,110
you have say in marketing with that,

4237
01:47:43,111 --> 01:47:45,360
it's different that can
shoot in here selling.

4238
01:47:45,410 --> 01:47:46,021
He's going to be,

4239
01:47:46,021 --> 01:47:48,900
this is where the time different animal,

4240
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:51,150
it's a different animal for sure.

4241
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:54,540
Brendan selling out COBB's
in San Francisco by himself.

4242
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:55,620
Holy Shit.

4243
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:57,590
That's fucking huge man.

4244
01:47:57,591 --> 01:47:59,280
So that consumer in Boston,

4245
01:47:59,340 --> 01:47:59,760
the what?

4246
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:02,150
The Wilbur Theater and house
and it's 1100 somethings.

4247
01:48:02,690 --> 01:48:03,480
Shit.

4248
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:04,231
God Damn.

4249
01:48:04,231 --> 01:48:04,950
I told him that he's,

4250
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:09,420
he's probably one of the fastest rising
comics coming from never doing standup.

4251
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:12,630
I mean who else is there really ever,

4252
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:13,320
ever.

4253
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:14,520
Right low ever.

4254
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:15,090
For sure.

4255
01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:17,580
That's what I'm telling stand up to
selling out theaters in two years.

4256
01:48:17,581 --> 01:48:18,440
Did you know this crazy?

4257
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:19,111
I mean,

4258
01:48:19,111 --> 01:48:19,800
it's incredible.

4259
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:20,490
It's incredible.

4260
01:48:20,490 --> 01:48:24,630
Doing like fucking an
hour and killing like you,

4261
01:48:24,631 --> 01:48:25,530
you put in the work,

4262
01:48:25,531 --> 01:48:25,741
dude.

4263
01:48:25,741 --> 01:48:27,930
That's what I tell other young comics.

4264
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:32,880
I say pay attention to him because this
is what happens when a person takes pro

4265
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:36,810
athlete type of discipline
and applies it to stand.

4266
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:40,320
That discipline is everything
that work ethic and discipline,

4267
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:41,580
that's everything mad.

4268
01:48:41,581 --> 01:48:43,950
It changes the whole game because
a lot of comics are funny,

4269
01:48:44,130 --> 01:48:45,360
but they're fucking lazy.

4270
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:47,620
They're fucking lazy and they don't they,

4271
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:49,920
that's why I like you.

4272
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:52,950
You're dealing with guys who do the same
material year after year after year and

4273
01:48:52,951 --> 01:48:53,880
they never do specials.

4274
01:48:53,881 --> 01:48:57,510
There's a bunch of those guys that are
really talented guys and they just never,

4275
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:00,300
they never bothered to record anything
cause they don't want to have to,

4276
01:49:00,301 --> 01:49:00,720
right.

4277
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:01,680
They don't have to rewrite.

4278
01:49:01,710 --> 01:49:03,040
It doesn't make sense to me like it.

4279
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:04,710
We talk about work ethic
and stuff like that.

4280
01:49:04,711 --> 01:49:06,810
I see these other comedians
who maybe aren't doing it,

4281
01:49:06,811 --> 01:49:07,644
but like,

4282
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:12,640
don't you see the guys like Rogan and
burn deleah like you want to be on there?

4283
01:49:12,730 --> 01:49:14,100
You want to do what they do,

4284
01:49:14,101 --> 01:49:14,934
right?

4285
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:16,291
Oh,

4286
01:49:16,291 --> 01:49:17,220
he's got a guillotine.

4287
01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:20,100
Fuck Nasty.

4288
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:22,170
It's the same with fighting.

4289
01:49:22,171 --> 01:49:23,310
Just like you look at GSP,

4290
01:49:23,311 --> 01:49:24,570
it's like he's doing this and this.

4291
01:49:24,571 --> 01:49:25,890
Don't you want to be like that?

4292
01:49:26,010 --> 01:49:27,720
She'll probably follow that plant.

4293
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:28,810
But people got scared.

4294
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:30,001
But here's the thing,

4295
01:49:30,001 --> 01:49:32,400
you get scared and then
he finally get some tools,

4296
01:49:32,401 --> 01:49:32,700
right?

4297
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:35,400
Like say if you have an act like
you put together an act and you're,

4298
01:49:35,401 --> 01:49:36,091
you're like,

4299
01:49:36,091 --> 01:49:38,070
before we ready to film a special,

4300
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:40,080
the idea is that your act is killing,

4301
01:49:40,081 --> 01:49:40,351
right?

4302
01:49:40,351 --> 01:49:41,310
So if your act as killing,

4303
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:42,960
you've got molden at home.

4304
01:49:43,110 --> 01:49:44,370
He didn't want to let that go.

4305
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,330
Like I got to let it go.

4306
01:49:45,390 --> 01:49:45,590
Oh,

4307
01:49:45,590 --> 01:49:46,320
let's look at this.

4308
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:47,090
I can't wait.

4309
01:49:47,090 --> 01:49:47,530
Decide,

4310
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:47,830
go.

4311
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:48,070
I gotta

4312
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,903
take it aside.

4313
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:50,170
But if you don't do that,

4314
01:49:50,171 --> 01:49:51,310
you don't keep getting better.

4315
01:49:51,311 --> 01:49:52,144
But here's the thing.

4316
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:53,590
One thing that I've learned,

4317
01:49:53,591 --> 01:49:56,470
even though there was a lot of fear
and letting go of that old material,

4318
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:57,970
you always write new,

4319
01:49:58,030 --> 01:50:00,640
better material because
you're a better comedian now.

4320
01:50:00,641 --> 01:50:02,050
You understand comedy better.

4321
01:50:02,650 --> 01:50:02,950
Yes.

4322
01:50:02,950 --> 01:50:03,761
You just going to do better.

4323
01:50:03,761 --> 01:50:04,541
Like for me,

4324
01:50:04,541 --> 01:50:06,880
like letting go that like
Bruce Jenner bit God,

4325
01:50:06,881 --> 01:50:08,050
it was so hard to let go.

4326
01:50:08,051 --> 01:50:10,540
I didn't want to let that one
go because of the special.

4327
01:50:10,590 --> 01:50:11,423
Yeah,

4328
01:50:11,890 --> 01:50:12,200
no,

4329
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:12,910
but I couldn't,

4330
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:14,890
I couldn't do that if my life
depended on it right now.

4331
01:50:14,891 --> 01:50:15,641
I don't know how it works.

4332
01:50:15,641 --> 01:50:18,250
I don't know the beats and
I wouldn't do it right.

4333
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:23,880
But when you get to a point when you
get a bit so tight and so finally tuned,

4334
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:27,940
that's when you got to let it go
and then you move onto the next one.

4335
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:31,480
And I've got some shit now that that's
killing harder than that bit did.

4336
01:50:31,690 --> 01:50:33,640
But when I first started doing,

4337
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:34,091
you know,

4338
01:50:34,091 --> 01:50:34,960
a year ago,

4339
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:39,961
year plus ago when I first released that
Netflix special and then I went right

4340
01:50:40,001 --> 01:50:43,600
into write new material and doing
new material is on shaky legs mat.

4341
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:46,150
And a lot of people don't
like that shaky legs feeling.

4342
01:50:46,151 --> 01:50:47,050
You get real scared,

4343
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:49,030
but you got to go through that.

4344
01:50:49,031 --> 01:50:49,751
You've got to go through that.

4345
01:50:49,751 --> 01:50:52,450
And that's what makes you grow
and continue to get better.

4346
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:52,961
But you know,

4347
01:50:52,961 --> 01:50:57,910
one of the things that helps me a lot
that a Jeremiah Watkins show that stand up

4348
01:50:57,911 --> 01:50:58,744
on the spot,

4349
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:02,560
dude that is a fucking farm for material.

4350
01:51:02,561 --> 01:51:05,580
So much fun because people yell
like someone look at you and go

4351
01:51:05,730 --> 01:51:07,930
of of hurricanes and you're like,

4352
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:09,130
man,

4353
01:51:09,130 --> 01:51:09,880
hurricanes.

4354
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,030
And then you start talking chin.

4355
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:12,640
Every now and then they'll say something.

4356
01:51:12,641 --> 01:51:13,474
It is,

4357
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:14,560
and the crowd,

4358
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,700
the crowd knows like,

4359
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:16,121
you know,

4360
01:51:16,121 --> 01:51:17,280
you just riff and they're not looking,

4361
01:51:17,281 --> 01:51:17,501
you know,

4362
01:51:17,501 --> 01:51:18,650
they know you're not shooting special.

4363
01:51:18,651 --> 01:51:22,110
So everyone's pretty loosey Goosey
and they'll yell like strippers.

4364
01:51:22,111 --> 01:51:24,110
I'm like that about them
and have fun with it.

4365
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:24,760
Yeah,

4366
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:25,810
it's amazing dude.

4367
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:29,680
It's an amazing resource to have
those shows where someone just yelled,

4368
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:31,240
he used to call it Thunderpussy.

4369
01:51:31,241 --> 01:51:32,230
They used to do it in the,

4370
01:51:32,231 --> 01:51:32,610
uh,

4371
01:51:32,610 --> 01:51:34,330
the ice house to the sun.

4372
01:51:34,331 --> 01:51:34,581
It was,

4373
01:51:34,581 --> 01:51:35,680
he's a great name for it.

4374
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:36,730
So intense.

4375
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,290
Just so stand up on the spot.

4376
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:42,010
But uh,

4377
01:51:42,010 --> 01:51:42,221
yeah,

4378
01:51:42,221 --> 01:51:43,420
I've been doing that show for years.

4379
01:51:43,421 --> 01:51:44,410
That's helping me a lot.

4380
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:46,600
It's a lot of bands and I told Jeremiah,

4381
01:51:46,601 --> 01:51:51,310
you were telling me how you get bits
from it and it's the same thing with

4382
01:51:51,311 --> 01:51:51,611
fighting.

4383
01:51:51,611 --> 01:51:51,941
Like if,

4384
01:51:51,941 --> 01:51:52,661
if we had train him,

4385
01:51:52,661 --> 01:51:53,291
you know how this is,

4386
01:51:53,291 --> 01:51:54,124
well if you guys know this,

4387
01:51:54,270 --> 01:51:57,610
there's one guy who's fucking these
really good and you know maybe tapped out

4388
01:51:57,611 --> 01:51:58,001
last time.

4389
01:51:58,001 --> 01:51:58,570
You Kinda,

4390
01:51:58,570 --> 01:52:01,230
you don't mean to avoid him because he
was going to be the top of this round.

4391
01:52:01,310 --> 01:52:02,140
I'll just go over here.

4392
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:04,420
That's how I was with
Jeremiah on stamp on the spot.

4393
01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:04,980
I was like,

4394
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:05,490
man,

4395
01:52:05,490 --> 01:52:06,430
I know my stuff.

4396
01:52:06,431 --> 01:52:07,241
I write all my stuff,

4397
01:52:07,241 --> 01:52:09,280
I know what I want to do here
and I can have fun with that.

4398
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:10,660
But on the spot,

4399
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:11,110
I dunno,

4400
01:52:11,110 --> 01:52:13,090
man kept canceling on him.

4401
01:52:13,330 --> 01:52:15,040
He texted me like this week I'm like,

4402
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:15,491
yeah,

4403
01:52:15,491 --> 01:52:15,970
for sure.

4404
01:52:15,970 --> 01:52:17,170
Then the next day like dude,

4405
01:52:17,171 --> 01:52:17,990
I'm swamped,

4406
01:52:17,990 --> 01:52:19,410
them swap

4407
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:21,933
and then I told him,

4408
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:22,570
hey,

4409
01:52:22,570 --> 01:52:23,560
next time you asked me to do it,

4410
01:52:23,590 --> 01:52:24,071
no,

4411
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:24,940
I'm lying to you.

4412
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,920
I need to do this cause I'm scared of it.

4413
01:52:26,950 --> 01:52:27,850
What's the show called?

4414
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:28,990
Stand up on the spot.

4415
01:52:28,991 --> 01:52:30,380
Jeremiah Watkins belly around.

4416
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:32,050
I think there's a show that night.

4417
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:32,973
Every Tuesday night.

4418
01:52:33,430 --> 01:52:33,941
Tuesday night.

4419
01:52:33,941 --> 01:52:34,900
Stand up on the spot.

4420
01:52:34,930 --> 01:52:35,763
Yeah.

4421
01:52:35,950 --> 01:52:37,150
Not every Tuesday night.

4422
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:37,331
No,

4423
01:52:37,331 --> 01:52:38,220
not went to Sunday.

4424
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:38,860
Yeah,

4425
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:40,500
that's why I'm saying I
think it's this Tuesday.

4426
01:52:41,550 --> 01:52:42,640
How try that am I?

4427
01:52:42,641 --> 01:52:43,480
Am I going crazy?

4428
01:52:43,540 --> 01:52:44,250
I thought he said,

4429
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:44,561
cause I,

4430
01:52:44,561 --> 01:52:46,160
I was trying to do three spots

4431
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:46,851
in the night and I go,

4432
01:52:46,851 --> 01:52:47,001
hey,

4433
01:52:47,001 --> 01:52:48,440
you have to send him a spontaneous no,

4434
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:51,140
cause I went laugh factory comedy
stores trying to get another spot.

4435
01:52:51,170 --> 01:52:52,460
I don't think it's until June.

4436
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:53,001
Honestly.

4437
01:52:53,001 --> 01:52:56,330
I think he just did it and I was out
of town and I was on his last one.

4438
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,050
When was that?

4439
01:52:57,050 --> 01:52:57,860
How long ago?

4440
01:52:57,860 --> 01:52:58,693
Two weeks ago.

4441
01:52:59,000 --> 01:52:59,241
Yeah.

4442
01:52:59,241 --> 01:53:00,590
So the next one would be like two weeks.

4443
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:01,513
All right,

4444
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:03,950
that sounds like fun.

4445
01:53:04,010 --> 01:53:04,731
Oh it's the best.

4446
01:53:04,731 --> 01:53:06,740
June 12th June 12th there you go.

4447
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:07,161
Tuesday,

4448
01:53:07,161 --> 01:53:07,994
June 12th

4449
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:10,700
I fucking love it man.

4450
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:11,050
It's,

4451
01:53:11,050 --> 01:53:11,841
it's really fun.

4452
01:53:11,841 --> 01:53:13,040
And it's always packed too.

4453
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:13,611
Yeah,

4454
01:53:13,611 --> 01:53:14,121
it's packed.

4455
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:14,540
And again,

4456
01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:17,990
the crowd knows what's going on
for a while after your shows,

4457
01:53:17,991 --> 01:53:20,090
he would do like question and
answer and there was nothing,

4458
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:20,931
there was nothing.

4459
01:53:20,931 --> 01:53:24,650
Anybody could have yelled out that
you couldn't tie into some pass bit.

4460
01:53:24,710 --> 01:53:25,370
You know what I mean?

4461
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:26,060
You had,

4462
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:26,960
there wasn't anything.

4463
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:28,130
Yeah,

4464
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:28,911
it's better though.

4465
01:53:28,911 --> 01:53:33,370
The stand up on the spot thing is better
because it's not that it's not past

4466
01:53:33,371 --> 01:53:34,130
bits,

4467
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:36,290
it's all just can't do material.

4468
01:53:36,830 --> 01:53:37,450
No.

4469
01:53:37,450 --> 01:53:38,300
They tell you no,

4470
01:53:38,330 --> 01:53:39,011
no material.

4471
01:53:39,011 --> 01:53:43,220
It's gotta be why people have done
it and done their act two and Pete,

4472
01:53:43,221 --> 01:53:44,300
the crowd gets mad.

4473
01:53:44,330 --> 01:53:45,163
They know,

4474
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:46,680
they know what's up cause you,

4475
01:53:46,681 --> 01:53:46,911
you know,

4476
01:53:46,911 --> 01:53:47,270
it's not,

4477
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:49,510
you can't tell what's off
the top and once that,

4478
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:50,520
yeah.

4479
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:50,930
Yeah.

4480
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:54,050
Do you remember we did fan Qa at
Wilbert so I did my show and then we'll,

4481
01:53:54,051 --> 01:53:54,231
you know,

4482
01:53:54,231 --> 01:53:54,681
Boston,

4483
01:53:54,681 --> 01:53:56,030
it was late and you know,

4484
01:53:56,031 --> 01:53:57,260
the dudes were drunk.

4485
01:53:59,390 --> 01:54:00,223
Heckler

4486
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:03,430
fucking went nuclear on the guy.

4487
01:54:03,431 --> 01:54:04,210
I was like,

4488
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:09,000
it's typically isn't how my favorite
questions go and fucking get a scarf on.

4489
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:13,920
All right,

4490
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:15,980
well that's it for big questions.

4491
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:16,751
Where'd it go?

4492
01:54:16,751 --> 01:54:17,584
Fuck face.

4493
01:54:17,980 --> 01:54:18,170
Well,

4494
01:54:18,170 --> 01:54:18,830
he was just,

4495
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:20,870
just trying so hard to get attention.

4496
01:54:22,130 --> 01:54:24,110
I've witnessed many,

4497
01:54:24,111 --> 01:54:27,110
many people getting torched by Joe once.

4498
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:27,610
It's,

4499
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:28,190
it's,

4500
01:54:28,190 --> 01:54:29,023
it's awesome.

4501
01:54:29,690 --> 01:54:31,340
It's awesome watching Joe because Joe,

4502
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:34,700
he doesn't want to
release until the guide.

4503
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:37,370
It's clear 100% and he deserves it.

4504
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:38,780
So a guy will yell and he's like,

4505
01:54:38,781 --> 01:54:40,010
calm down everything and he's like,

4506
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:41,830
and like inside like keep going.

4507
01:54:41,860 --> 01:54:42,693
So I could just,

4508
01:54:42,910 --> 01:54:43,390
I don't know.

4509
01:54:43,390 --> 01:54:44,720
I just want to feel guilty.

4510
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:46,430
So when Joe Decides to go off,

4511
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:47,660
it's over son.

4512
01:54:47,661 --> 01:54:49,720
There's no way I don't with the mic.

4513
01:54:49,730 --> 01:54:50,361
Forget it Joe.

4514
01:54:50,361 --> 01:54:50,961
Without a Mike,

4515
01:54:50,961 --> 01:54:51,840
you're still fucked dude.

4516
01:54:53,210 --> 01:54:57,530
I saw dank to go hard on these
two girls in the front row when,

4517
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:58,640
uh,

4518
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:01,010
when I was at the comm
store last Tuesday night.

4519
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:02,301
Oh my God,

4520
01:55:02,301 --> 01:55:03,290
they wouldn't quit talking.

4521
01:55:03,291 --> 01:55:03,621
And he's like,

4522
01:55:03,621 --> 01:55:04,160
honey,

4523
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:05,240
you're trying to get through a story.

4524
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:06,650
And he was a longer story.

4525
01:55:06,651 --> 01:55:07,760
You could tell he's doing new material.

4526
01:55:07,761 --> 01:55:08,594
He's trying to get through it.

4527
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:09,680
They kept interrupting.

4528
01:55:09,681 --> 01:55:10,514
He's like,

4529
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,160
I can go in on you if you want.

4530
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:12,950
Say another thing.

4531
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:13,783
And she's goes,

4532
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:15,051
another thing goes,

4533
01:55:15,051 --> 01:55:15,771
do you want to do this?

4534
01:55:15,771 --> 01:55:17,650
And then just fucking cuckoo.

4535
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:18,040
Cuckoo,

4536
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:18,410
cuckoo.

4537
01:55:18,410 --> 01:55:19,990
I mean it was just brutal,

4538
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:20,510
man.

4539
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:21,560
It makes a show though,

4540
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:23,060
cause he did about 20 minutes of it.

4541
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:26,470
There's a lot of fucking heckling
in at the comedy store lately.

4542
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,490
What do people want to
become a part of the show?

4543
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:29,480
That's a terrible idea.

4544
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:32,990
There should be a warning warning.

4545
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:37,670
Oh there's two girls in the front row
the other night just drunk and sloppy and

4546
01:55:37,671 --> 01:55:39,700
talking really loud.

4547
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:42,380
You know like you're
onstage and you hear them.

4548
01:55:42,381 --> 01:55:43,260
He tried to ignore them,

4549
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:44,010
but then you see the

4550
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,600
rest of the crowd going like this.

4551
01:55:45,601 --> 01:55:46,860
That's when you have to acknowledge it.

4552
01:55:46,861 --> 01:55:49,020
You have to see people
turning towards him.

4553
01:55:49,021 --> 01:55:49,261
You're like,

4554
01:55:49,261 --> 01:55:49,800
all right,

4555
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:51,450
I got to play cop here most of the time.

4556
01:55:51,451 --> 01:55:53,220
The stores on top of that big time,

4557
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:55,770
which is a new thing in the old days.

4558
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:56,221
Yeah.

4559
01:55:56,221 --> 01:55:59,480
The way I got good at
heckling at hecklers,

4560
01:55:59,490 --> 01:56:02,310
one of the big ways is that there
was no crowd control at the store.

4561
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:06,570
I mean Zero Mad Max because in the
old days when I used to go there,

4562
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:10,760
the fucking comedians
were all doormen and,

4563
01:56:10,761 --> 01:56:11,311
and uh,

4564
01:56:11,311 --> 01:56:12,150
security,

4565
01:56:12,151 --> 01:56:13,680
everything that was all comedians.

4566
01:56:13,710 --> 01:56:14,850
It's not that anymore.

4567
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:16,740
Now they have like legit security,

4568
01:56:16,741 --> 01:56:17,700
like big guys.

4569
01:56:17,850 --> 01:56:20,670
They take care of everything
people have earpieces on.

4570
01:56:20,671 --> 01:56:21,690
They're in control of everything.

4571
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:26,900
When the store picked up the
business like about three years ago,

4572
01:56:27,331 --> 01:56:28,980
when it really took off three,

4573
01:56:28,981 --> 01:56:29,814
four years ago,

4574
01:56:29,970 --> 01:56:31,050
that's when they'd go,

4575
01:56:31,051 --> 01:56:31,621
okay look,

4576
01:56:31,621 --> 01:56:33,510
this place is sold out
every fucking night.

4577
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:34,950
And then a guy got murdered there.

4578
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:36,840
There was a murder on the front porch.

4579
01:56:37,050 --> 01:56:37,381
Yeah.

4580
01:56:37,381 --> 01:56:39,450
Guy got shot to death on the front porch.

4581
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:40,411
Yeah.

4582
01:56:40,411 --> 01:56:42,120
It was some gang related type thing.

4583
01:56:42,650 --> 01:56:46,860
Some guy did something to somebody and
apparently that dude who got killed,

4584
01:56:46,861 --> 01:56:51,240
he had some really dark
shit on his Facebook to like
pictures of people tied up

4585
01:56:51,241 --> 01:56:52,074
and shit.

4586
01:56:52,110 --> 01:56:52,620
And uh,

4587
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:53,341
they murdered him.

4588
01:56:53,341 --> 01:56:54,810
He shot him right in the front porch.

4589
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:58,920
And from then on they put like a super
intense security system there and cameras

4590
01:56:58,921 --> 01:56:59,670
everywhere.

4591
01:56:59,670 --> 01:57:03,120
Hired real security everywhere
and ramped up the place.

4592
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:06,390
Stop letting people walk
into the parking lot.

4593
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:09,750
That was a big one too because people
would just stroll into the parking lot and

4594
01:57:09,751 --> 01:57:12,780
these drunk people would be backing up
their cars and people would be getting

4595
01:57:12,781 --> 01:57:14,070
hit by people's cars.

4596
01:57:14,071 --> 01:57:14,760
A shit show.

4597
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:15,100
What is it?

4598
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:15,341
Shit.

4599
01:57:15,341 --> 01:57:15,531
Shit.

4600
01:57:15,531 --> 01:57:18,780
Do you think's going to happen to the
comedy store now that Mitsis passed away?

4601
01:57:18,781 --> 01:57:22,320
Do you think that DePaul is that
the business is better than ever?

4602
01:57:22,350 --> 01:57:26,190
The thing about it is it's sold out every
night and it's making a lot of money.

4603
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:28,800
Like if you go to the comedy
store on a Tuesday night,

4604
01:57:28,801 --> 01:57:30,450
you're going to have a sold out main room.

4605
01:57:30,451 --> 01:57:31,860
400 people sold out.

4606
01:57:31,861 --> 01:57:36,280
Oh our hundred and 70 people
sold out belly room 80 people.

4607
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:38,340
I mean that is big money,

4608
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:41,130
but every night to two shows a night off,

4609
01:57:41,131 --> 01:57:42,090
it doesn't say two,

4610
01:57:42,091 --> 01:57:46,590
two main room shows every night are both
sold out now thousands and thousands of

4611
01:57:46,591 --> 01:57:48,270
people funneling into that place.

4612
01:57:48,271 --> 01:57:51,900
As far as like from the beginning of
the shows that started at eight o'clock

4613
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:53,100
till two o'clock in the morning.

4614
01:57:53,101 --> 01:57:57,030
People are buying drinks is it's make
money is enough money to keep it running.

4615
01:57:57,700 --> 01:57:58,050
Yes.

4616
01:57:58,050 --> 01:57:59,070
It's very profitable.

4617
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:02,100
It making more money now than
in the history of the club.

4618
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:03,810
Never made more money ever.

4619
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:05,730
So it's a viable,

4620
01:58:05,810 --> 01:58:06,631
I mean it's crazy.

4621
01:58:06,631 --> 01:58:08,310
It's all within the last
three and a half years.

4622
01:58:08,311 --> 01:58:09,750
Three and a half since you've been back.

4623
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:10,051
Yeah.

4624
01:58:10,051 --> 01:58:11,160
It all just went boom.

4625
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:12,090
It took off.

4626
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:13,380
This podcast blew it up.

4627
01:58:13,410 --> 01:58:13,690
Yup.

4628
01:58:13,690 --> 01:58:16,350
Single handed the you come and
part of it and they don't deny it.

4629
01:58:16,351 --> 01:58:17,580
I talked to management there.

4630
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:18,540
They don't deny it.

4631
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:19,051
I asked him like,

4632
01:58:19,051 --> 01:58:19,210
what?

4633
01:58:19,210 --> 01:58:19,530
What?

4634
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:19,880
You know,

4635
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:20,520
what do you,

4636
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:21,810
what do you think's the cause of this?

4637
01:58:21,870 --> 01:58:22,590
Boom?

4638
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:24,270
He said Joe Rogan.

4639
01:58:24,271 --> 01:58:25,710
They'll say Joe rogue.

4640
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:26,580
Huge part of it.

4641
01:58:26,610 --> 01:58:28,170
And then you have all the
comics coming through.

4642
01:58:28,171 --> 01:58:29,280
It's the golden age of comedy,

4643
01:58:29,281 --> 01:58:29,431
right?

4644
01:58:29,431 --> 01:58:29,730
Yeah.

4645
01:58:29,730 --> 01:58:31,080
It's also the talent there.

4646
01:58:31,081 --> 01:58:32,400
There's so much talent there.

4647
01:58:32,430 --> 01:58:34,590
It's crazy how good those shows are.

4648
01:58:34,591 --> 01:58:36,000
I mean you look at the lineup sometime,

4649
01:58:36,001 --> 01:58:36,241

4650
01:58:36,241 --> 01:58:38,320

4651
01:58:38,430 --> 01:58:41,710
I ran over cause Patanol
Oswald's doing again.

4652
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:42,340
I've ran

4653
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:43,230
over to see him cause he was the,

4654
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:46,030

usually he's a New York comic.

4655
01:58:46,290 --> 01:58:48,850

4658
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:51,123

while when he was doing stuff,

4662
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:54,813
starting to stand up.

4663
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:57,550
I only saw him post them
out in New York as it got.

4664
01:58:57,551 --> 01:59:00,010
I can't wait for him to come back
and started doing it again and again.

4665
01:59:00,011 --> 01:59:00,161
Yeah,

4666
01:59:00,161 --> 01:59:01,870
I saw them doing spots in New York a lot.

4667
01:59:01,871 --> 01:59:02,350
Interesting.

4668

Um,

4702
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:44,380
Neil Brennan,

4703
01:59:44,590 --> 01:59:44,981
they're there.

4704
01:59:44,981 --> 01:59:45,814
It's a fucking,

4705
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,560
it's a crazy place right now.

4706
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:48,430
It's crazy.

4707
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:49,240
Insane.

4708
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:50,073
Bobby Lee.

4709
01:59:50,540 --> 01:59:50,831
I mean,

4710
01:59:50,831 --> 01:59:52,300
it's just killer after killer.

4711
01:59:52,450 --> 01:59:52,691
I mean,

4712
01:59:52,691 --> 01:59:54,880
I was walking by the Eliza Slessinger,

4713
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:56,500
Whitney Cummings walking by the,

4714
01:59:56,501 --> 01:59:56,741
or the,

4715
01:59:56,741 --> 01:59:59,110
or the other night and it was
just roars coming out of there.

4716
01:59:59,111 --> 01:59:59,531
And I was like,

4717
01:59:59,531 --> 02:00:00,760
this place is nuts.

4718
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:03,670
And then you go down the hallway and
this rowers coming out of the main room.

4719
02:00:03,671 --> 02:00:04,360
You grew up stairs.

4720
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:04,750
Right?

4721
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:05,583
That's crazy.

4722
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:07,260
The greatest time ever for stand up.

4723
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:08,290
Greatest time ever.

4724
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:10,870
You go in there and you just
feel it man in the walls.

4725
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:11,621
I don't know what it is.

4726
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:14,350
And then you go over to the laugh
factory and it's like an antique shop.

4727
02:00:14,351 --> 02:00:15,450
That's what Theo von says.

4728
02:00:16,980 --> 02:00:20,410
When you feel like in an antique shop,

4729
02:00:20,660 --> 02:00:22,090
Oh my God.

4730
02:00:22,380 --> 02:00:23,213
You can't say.

4731
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:23,710
Yeah,

4732
02:00:23,710 --> 02:00:24,960
you can do that.

4733
02:00:24,980 --> 02:00:26,290
When they started filming people,

4734
02:00:26,291 --> 02:00:26,920
everybody was like,

4735
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:27,753
what?

4736
02:00:27,850 --> 02:00:28,511
They started filming.

4737
02:00:28,511 --> 02:00:29,830
People just put it up on Youtube.

4738
02:00:29,831 --> 02:00:31,090
They say they're not doing it anymore,

4739
02:00:31,091 --> 02:00:33,340
but everybody just lost
all faith in that place.

4740
02:00:33,341 --> 02:00:33,790
They're like,

4741
02:00:33,790 --> 02:00:34,220
yeah,

4742
02:00:34,220 --> 02:00:35,110
I still do spots.

4743
02:00:35,111 --> 02:00:36,250
Got Do spots where I can,

4744
02:00:36,251 --> 02:00:38,800
but they're not releasing my shit.

4745
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:40,510
The fact that they would do that,

4746
02:00:40,511 --> 02:00:43,350
it's like you guys are fucking mind man.

4747
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:46,390
And then offering people half
of the revenue for you to,

4748
02:00:46,510 --> 02:00:47,343
yeah,

4749
02:00:47,350 --> 02:00:48,400
just put it up myself.

4750
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:48,851
It just,

4751
02:00:48,851 --> 02:00:51,190
it's what age are you living in?

4752
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:52,510
And then when confronted,

4753
02:00:52,511 --> 02:00:52,751
they're like,

4754
02:00:52,751 --> 02:00:52,931
well,

4755
02:00:52,931 --> 02:00:55,780
Tiffany hydros was making so much
money now and it's all because of this.

4756
02:00:55,810 --> 02:00:56,643
Oh yeah,

4757
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:57,940
that's delusional.

4758
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:00,280
I don't know what he did.

4759
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:01,330
The guy who owns it,

4760
02:01:01,331 --> 02:01:05,530
I don't know why he did like letting those
kids do that and put those things up.

4761
02:01:05,531 --> 02:01:08,260
But people that had no idea about
the standup comedy business,

4762
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:12,790
I didn't basically interns just filming
people's sets and putting all their

4763
02:01:12,791 --> 02:01:13,720
material online.

4764
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:14,950
But the way it works is,

4765
02:01:14,951 --> 02:01:15,161
you know,

4766
02:01:15,161 --> 02:01:16,150
it's a close community.

4767
02:01:16,151 --> 02:01:19,150
So if Joe or whoever San te Santana goes,

4768
02:01:19,300 --> 02:01:20,160
hey they're filming,

4769
02:01:20,170 --> 02:01:21,310
don't do it there anymore.

4770
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:22,260
And it,

4771
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:23,093
I mean it just don't,

4772
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:24,870
everyone has those towns,

4773
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:25,400
they go there.

4774
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:26,340
They mean you'll,

4775
02:01:26,341 --> 02:01:28,150
you'll have three sold out shows,

4776
02:01:28,450 --> 02:01:31,330
not even a half a mile
away at the comedy store.

4777
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:34,390
And then these they're canceling
show cause there was no one there,

4778
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:35,651
but that's a lot.

4779
02:01:35,651 --> 02:01:36,360
But then the Improv,

4780
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:38,590
the improv still doing the
Improv is doing better.

4781
02:01:38,591 --> 02:01:39,000
Yeah.

4782
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:39,350
Yeah.

4783
02:01:39,350 --> 02:01:40,183
And you know,

4784
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:43,340
the Improv moved that stupid
fucking piano off the stage.

4785
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:48,650
They put a platform on the side and push
the pan over to the piano would fuck up

4786
02:01:48,651 --> 02:01:51,620
the whole show for anybody that
was on the right side of the stage.

4787
02:01:51,650 --> 02:01:54,590
They can't see the in the
ice house still bumping.

4788
02:01:54,591 --> 02:01:55,390
Right.

4789
02:01:55,390 --> 02:01:55,910
Pumping.

4790
02:01:55,910 --> 02:01:56,240
Yeah.

4791
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:58,280
Especially when good comics are there.

4792
02:01:58,300 --> 02:01:58,790
You know,

4793
02:01:58,790 --> 02:01:59,541
with the ice house,

4794
02:01:59,541 --> 02:02:03,410
it's all about the have to have good
people to get out to Pasadena because the

4795
02:02:03,411 --> 02:02:04,244
ice house,

4796
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:06,950
they've had sketchy lineups in the past.

4797
02:02:06,951 --> 02:02:07,461
Like you know,

4798
02:02:07,461 --> 02:02:09,020
they'll have Joey and Brenda,

4799
02:02:09,050 --> 02:02:11,030
they'll have like real
shows that are really funny.

4800
02:02:11,031 --> 02:02:14,250
But to also have like some
old shit and they had a,

4801
02:02:14,270 --> 02:02:17,870
for years they had some bullshit
which kills you because you get,

4802
02:02:18,110 --> 02:02:19,490
if you get known as that,

4803
02:02:19,491 --> 02:02:21,620
where it's like the
gimmicky bullshit guys,

4804
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:23,180
people are gonna be go on a Friday night,

4805
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:25,080
let's just go see who's
playing at the ice house.

4806
02:02:25,110 --> 02:02:25,400
Yeah.

4807
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:26,450
Like fuck that man.

4808
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:26,931
Yeah.

4809
02:02:26,931 --> 02:02:28,400
People will go down there and they'll,

4810
02:02:28,490 --> 02:02:33,490
they'll expect to see like a Joey Diaz
show and then some whack ass fucking road

4811
02:02:34,071 --> 02:02:38,600
guy who does and cruise ships more
for the people that live in that area.

4812
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:38,930
Like,

4813
02:02:38,930 --> 02:02:41,000
I mean isn't it like
a local kind of thing?

4814
02:02:41,630 --> 02:02:41,781
Yeah,

4815
02:02:41,781 --> 02:02:42,231
but it's still,

4816
02:02:42,231 --> 02:02:43,070
if it's a bad show,

4817
02:02:43,071 --> 02:02:43,970
it's a bad show.

4818
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,110
They don't want to come back.

4819
02:02:45,390 --> 02:02:46,610
See if it's a good show.

4820
02:02:46,970 --> 02:02:48,590
Like they know when I do,

4821
02:02:48,620 --> 02:02:49,820
I do those Wednesday nights,

4822
02:02:49,821 --> 02:02:52,190
once a month there and they
know if you go down there,

4823
02:02:52,370 --> 02:02:53,900
I'm going to have killers on that show.

4824
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:55,970
You decide who goes on?

4825
02:02:55,971 --> 02:02:56,181
Yeah,

4826
02:02:56,181 --> 02:02:56,840
it's on my show.

4827
02:02:56,840 --> 02:02:57,320
It's your show.

4828
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:57,920
Yeah,

4829
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,700
Wednesday nights.

4830
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:02,300
I do one Thursday night at the comedy
store every month and I do one Wednesday

4831
02:03:02,301 --> 02:03:03,290
night at the,

4832
02:03:03,291 --> 02:03:03,680
uh,

4833
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:04,513
at the ice house.

4834
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:06,020
Is it called Joe and friends?

4835
02:03:06,021 --> 02:03:06,231
Yeah,

4836
02:03:06,231 --> 02:03:07,070
Joe Rogan and friends.

4837
02:03:07,071 --> 02:03:12,071
And the next one at the comedy
store is June 21st June 21st yeah.

4838
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:19,310
And just in the green room where
like last time it was Tony Feo,

4839
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:22,130
you meet just hanging out back
and of like the best time.

4840
02:03:22,131 --> 02:03:24,360
It's fucking been out to two in
the morning and we just laugh.

4841
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:25,640
It's the best man.

4842
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:27,230
Those guys made me laugh so hard.

4843
02:03:27,231 --> 02:03:27,980
All you guys,

4844
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:28,800
well it's just,

4845
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:29,570
it's,

4846
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:33,950
it's hard to find groups of
people that are just savages,

4847
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:36,080
just loose and fun and ridiculous.

4848
02:03:36,230 --> 02:03:37,070
And then there,

4849
02:03:37,430 --> 02:03:38,600
this is the world they live in.

4850
02:03:38,601 --> 02:03:41,870
They live in this comedy worlds that
traveling around a lot fucking around,

4851
02:03:41,930 --> 02:03:42,720
having a good time,

4852
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:45,210
talk that shit and one person to
say something that it's just like,

4853
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:46,350
it was like,

4854
02:03:46,350 --> 02:03:47,183
yeah,

4855
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:48,380
it's fucking on.

4856
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:49,610
So that's fun,

4857
02:03:49,650 --> 02:03:49,920
man.

4858
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:50,753
Fun Times.

4859
02:03:51,830 --> 02:03:52,670
Everyone's baked.

4860
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:53,890
It's just fun.

4861
02:03:53,890 --> 02:03:55,730
It's just like high school
with your good friends.

4862
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:58,880
Like when you walk into like
first period and all your boys,

4863
02:03:58,881 --> 02:03:59,900
like we hit the front.

4864
02:03:59,901 --> 02:04:01,100
That's what it feels like.

4865
02:04:01,130 --> 02:04:01,851
What a lot of ways,

4866
02:04:01,851 --> 02:04:02,031
right?

4867
02:04:02,031 --> 02:04:04,190
Because one of the things
that happens as you get older,

4868
02:04:04,191 --> 02:04:06,170
as you lose all the fun cause you have,

4869
02:04:06,530 --> 02:04:07,580
you have responsibilities,

4870
02:04:07,590 --> 02:04:10,250
you have a job you hate and you gotta
get up in the morning and you're always

4871
02:04:10,251 --> 02:04:11,060
tired.

4872
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:11,790
And this is the,

4873
02:04:11,790 --> 02:04:13,610
the world that most people live in.

4874
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,740
When you could find a place where it's
all basically people that avoided that

4875
02:04:18,741 --> 02:04:21,980
rat race and figured out some
sneaky way through the system.

4876
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:24,560
And that sneaky way is talking shit

4877
02:04:26,380 --> 02:04:27,100
to no,

4878
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:28,490
no sound check needed.

4879
02:04:28,780 --> 02:04:28,961
You know,

4880
02:04:28,961 --> 02:04:31,520
you just get on stage and it's uh,

4881
02:04:32,050 --> 02:04:32,600
you know,

4882
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:34,580
especially when high
level comedians go up,

4883
02:04:34,581 --> 02:04:35,151
like yourself,

4884
02:04:35,151 --> 02:04:38,070
like you're going to get an hour of just

4885
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:40,740
laughs just over and over again.

4886
02:04:40,741 --> 02:04:42,180
It's way better than a funny movie.

4887
02:04:42,210 --> 02:04:42,391
Yeah.

4888
02:04:42,391 --> 02:04:42,740
But if,

4889
02:04:42,740 --> 02:04:43,920
if you're a new comic,

4890
02:04:43,921 --> 02:04:44,490
you can,

4891
02:04:44,490 --> 02:04:48,750
I'm getting education to go in and get
something around with those people.

4892
02:04:49,590 --> 02:04:53,050
I ain't go listen to a
deal vanti about something.

4893
02:04:53,051 --> 02:04:55,350
And me and Joe Talk Business
and I'll go watch Patton Oswald,

4894
02:04:55,351 --> 02:04:56,041
do his set,

4895
02:04:56,041 --> 02:04:58,860
and then I'll watch Joey Diaz
and then bill burrs coming in.

4896
02:04:58,920 --> 02:04:59,311
And for me,

4897
02:04:59,311 --> 02:05:00,660
as long as I've been doing comedy,

4898
02:05:00,661 --> 02:05:01,560
I still love it.

4899
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:02,610
I still love watching it.

4900
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:03,780
I still love watching it.

4901
02:05:03,781 --> 02:05:04,530
If someone's Kellen,

4902
02:05:04,530 --> 02:05:05,330
I still love it,

4903
02:05:05,330 --> 02:05:06,060
you know?

4904
02:05:06,060 --> 02:05:06,893
I love it.

4905
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:07,471
It's the,

4906
02:05:07,471 --> 02:05:08,304
it's just,

4907
02:05:08,630 --> 02:05:12,210
it's a great form of entertainment
and I think it's necessary to,

4908
02:05:12,450 --> 02:05:14,820
because people get so serious
about certain subjects.

4909
02:05:14,821 --> 02:05:18,300
If someone could just come along
and mock it and laugh at it so hard,

4910
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:19,650
and then you realize like,

4911
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:19,891
oh,

4912
02:05:19,891 --> 02:05:21,270
this is fucking ridiculous.

4913
02:05:21,450 --> 02:05:22,440
This is ridiculous.

4914
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:23,353
Yeah.

4915
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:24,570
Alleviates pressure.

4916
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:29,600
What was fascinating to me the other
night with Tom Papa a Oswald and Tony

4917
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:30,181
Hinchcliffe,

4918
02:05:30,181 --> 02:05:33,480
they all had the same
premises on their joke,

4919
02:05:33,481 --> 02:05:34,740
but everything was,

4920
02:05:35,310 --> 02:05:37,470
each opinion was so different.

4921
02:05:37,471 --> 02:05:38,670
I was laughing so hard,

4922
02:05:38,671 --> 02:05:39,180
man.

4923
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:40,440
But you just see how
everyone is different,

4924
02:05:40,441 --> 02:05:42,430
but it's the popular subject.

4925
02:05:42,431 --> 02:05:43,410
So like Trump,

4926
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:45,660
no sexual assault.

4927
02:05:46,330 --> 02:05:47,220
It was so funny,

4928
02:05:47,221 --> 02:05:47,700
man.

4929
02:05:47,700 --> 02:05:48,511
I like Joey's.

4930
02:05:48,511 --> 02:05:48,900
Ah,

4931
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:49,733
I don't want to give away.

4932
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:53,160
He's got a great back bid on that,

4933
02:05:54,170 --> 02:05:54,861
Neil Magni.

4934
02:05:54,861 --> 02:05:56,040
It's tough to take down,

4935
02:05:56,041 --> 02:05:56,520
Huh?

4936
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:57,111
Very death,

4937
02:05:57,111 --> 02:05:57,390
right?

4938
02:05:57,390 --> 02:05:59,700
Very wirey long.

4939
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:00,750
And who's this gentleman?

4940
02:06:00,751 --> 02:06:03,450
And he's fighting James James White.

4941
02:06:03,451 --> 02:06:05,670
Do you know anything
about Craig Craig White?

4942
02:06:06,290 --> 02:06:07,800
It was supposed to be a,

4943
02:06:12,850 --> 02:06:13,061
Oh,

4944
02:06:13,061 --> 02:06:13,990
why am I drawing a blank?

4945
02:06:13,991 --> 02:06:16,570
What's homeboys Gunnar
Nelson and Jesus Christ.

4946
02:06:17,110 --> 02:06:17,943
What happened at gunner?

4947
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:18,730
He got injured.

4948
02:06:18,730 --> 02:06:19,490
I'm not sure,

4949
02:06:19,490 --> 02:06:20,830
but I was going to be a hell of a fight.

4950
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:23,170
Yo Man.

4951
02:06:23,170 --> 02:06:27,580
Neil Neil's beat some tough
guys speak Delvin Kelvin Gaslin.

4952
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:28,140
Yeah.

4953
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:28,681
Beat Kelvin.

4954
02:06:28,681 --> 02:06:30,370
And he's almost taking Johnny Hendricks.

4955
02:06:31,170 --> 02:06:33,940
He beat Hector Lombard
injury that required surgery.

4956
02:06:34,330 --> 02:06:35,350
Hector Lombard,

4957
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:36,470
Kelvin Gasland,

4958
02:06:36,471 --> 02:06:38,080
Johny Hendricks and Johnny Hendricks.

4959
02:06:38,081 --> 02:06:38,590
Correct.

4960
02:06:38,590 --> 02:06:39,423
It's pretty tough.

4961
02:06:40,150 --> 02:06:41,150
But then whenever he finds,

4962
02:06:41,890 --> 02:06:42,723
when,

4963
02:06:42,820 --> 02:06:43,380
whenever we fight,

4964
02:06:43,380 --> 02:06:44,680
the Jitsu guys screwed.

4965
02:06:44,740 --> 02:06:46,390
It's his Achilles heel
because they take him down.

4966
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:48,730
Merch umum his Jujitsu is not that good.

4967
02:06:48,970 --> 02:06:50,050
His defense has just,

4968
02:06:50,051 --> 02:06:50,350
you know,

4969
02:06:50,350 --> 02:06:52,260
but when I say it's as a kid and seal,

4970
02:06:52,330 --> 02:06:52,770
the only,

4971
02:06:52,770 --> 02:06:52,960
the,

4972
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:54,940
the very tip of the spear of black belts,

4973
02:06:54,941 --> 02:06:55,750
fuck them up.

4974
02:06:55,750 --> 02:07:00,430
That's why I was so impressed with
a Dosantos dos Anjos smashed Neal.

4975
02:07:00,670 --> 02:07:01,810
He leg kicked him,

4976
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:05,140
dragged him to the ground and
choke the fuck out of Damien.

4977
02:07:05,141 --> 02:07:06,010
Maia did that.

4978
02:07:06,130 --> 02:07:08,650
That other homeboy got
a inverted triangle.

4979
02:07:08,651 --> 02:07:09,311
The Bald Guy,

4980
02:07:09,311 --> 02:07:10,110
I forget his name.

4981
02:07:10,110 --> 02:07:13,120
Who is ridiculous at Jiu
Jitsu Brazilian bald guy.

4982
02:07:13,330 --> 02:07:13,840
Bald guys.

4983
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:16,320
All Brazilian and vertical.

4984
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:17,920
All Brazilian.

4985
02:07:17,921 --> 02:07:18,850
Tiago Alvarez.

4986
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:19,331
No,

4987
02:07:19,331 --> 02:07:19,541
no,

4988
02:07:19,541 --> 02:07:20,374
no.

4989
02:07:21,460 --> 02:07:22,293
Yeah,

4990
02:07:22,310 --> 02:07:23,520
that guy is really good.

4991
02:07:23,530 --> 02:07:24,440
You put that gas

4992
02:07:25,990 --> 02:07:27,040
and then Damien Maia was like,

4993
02:07:27,050 --> 02:07:27,791
you do what?

4994
02:07:27,791 --> 02:07:28,630
And he's got he,

4995
02:07:28,820 --> 02:07:33,820
he triangled someone from the mount
years ago and I'll never forget he forgot

4996
02:07:34,271 --> 02:07:35,410
his name because that,

4997
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:36,100
yeah,

4998
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:36,970
he's a beast man.

4999
02:07:37,150 --> 02:07:38,230
He set it up beautifully.

5000
02:07:38,231 --> 02:07:40,240
He's got a crazy tricep too.

5001
02:07:40,241 --> 02:07:41,530
He's like missing a tricep.

5002
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:44,620
Like you look at one of his arms
like is tricep was nonexistent.

5003
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:47,240
It must've broke off and slid over.

5004
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:47,701
Yeah,

5005
02:07:47,701 --> 02:07:48,534
it must've tour.

5006
02:07:49,550 --> 02:07:50,090
Yeah,

5007
02:07:50,090 --> 02:07:50,923
a fruit roll up.

5008
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:51,281
Yeah.

5009
02:07:51,281 --> 02:07:52,580
He never got it fixed cause he's got a,

5010
02:07:52,581 --> 02:07:53,411
a Bicep,

5011
02:07:53,411 --> 02:07:54,820
but then there's nothing behind it.

5012
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,920
It's very weird looking
at one of his arms he do,

5013
02:07:56,921 --> 02:07:58,000
if he's still fighting,

5014
02:07:58,001 --> 02:08:00,370
just got killed by somebody.

5015
02:08:00,550 --> 02:08:01,383
Somebody good.

5016
02:08:02,290 --> 02:08:03,670
Pull up a surger Mariah.

5017
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:07,233
Hmm.

5018
02:08:08,430 --> 02:08:08,671
Yeah.

5019
02:08:08,671 --> 02:08:11,460
He was the first guy to
tap crone as a black belt.

5020
02:08:11,490 --> 02:08:15,430
It was like a wonder that Magni
and amount magni in the mouth.

5021
02:08:15,690 --> 02:08:15,991
Yes,

5022
02:08:15,991 --> 02:08:16,561
he has left.

5023
02:08:16,561 --> 02:08:16,830
Bought.

5024
02:08:16,830 --> 02:08:18,360
TRICEP is missing.

5025
02:08:18,930 --> 02:08:20,640
It's even weirder when you see it.

5026
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:21,060
Uh,

5027
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:21,960
like hanging low.

5028
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:22,813
Pretty weird there.

5029
02:08:22,950 --> 02:08:23,611
Pull up his,

5030
02:08:23,611 --> 02:08:23,790
uh,

5031
02:08:23,790 --> 02:08:24,623
his record.

5032
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:25,490
This shit does.

5033
02:08:25,490 --> 02:08:27,730
Mangling the Mac is going
for an arm triangle here.

5034
02:08:30,490 --> 02:08:30,610
Well,

5035
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:31,443
immediately.

5036
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:33,210
Oh Shit.

5037
02:08:33,330 --> 02:08:34,200
He's going to stand up.

5038
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:34,591
Let me see.

5039
02:08:34,591 --> 02:08:35,800
Is there we go.

5040
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:36,041
No,

5041
02:08:36,041 --> 02:08:36,121
no,

5042
02:08:36,121 --> 02:08:36,760
no.

5043
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:37,540
It's just go,

5044
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:38,460
go to his record though.

5045
02:08:39,160 --> 02:08:39,330
Yeah,

5046
02:08:39,330 --> 02:08:40,163
that's right here.

5047
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:40,920
Where's it?

5048
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:41,753
Scroll down.

5049
02:08:42,660 --> 02:08:42,841
No,

5050
02:08:42,841 --> 02:08:43,080
no.

5051
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:46,530
His accident here fights
10 means [inaudible].

5052
02:08:46,700 --> 02:08:47,730
Kiyota Oh yeah.

5053
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:49,121
It's only k.

5054
02:08:49,121 --> 02:08:50,490
Oh really?

5055
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:51,540
Yeah.

5056
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:51,910
Yeah.

5057
02:08:51,910 --> 02:08:53,220
This one has a lot of decisions,

5058
02:08:53,221 --> 02:08:53,740
man.

5059
02:08:53,740 --> 02:08:54,573
MMM.

5060
02:08:56,290 --> 02:08:58,180
Super disappointed in that standup.

5061
02:08:58,450 --> 02:09:01,570
Matt Serra was going
off about his laundry,

5062
02:09:01,660 --> 02:09:02,350
about us,

5063
02:09:02,350 --> 02:09:03,700
the referee standing them,

5064
02:09:03,770 --> 02:09:04,660
separating them.

5065
02:09:04,661 --> 02:09:07,180
When a Damien Maia had
his bag was ridiculous.

5066
02:09:07,181 --> 02:09:09,820
It was really God who is the rough,

5067
02:09:10,330 --> 02:09:11,650
I want to say it was Leon Roberts,

5068
02:09:11,710 --> 02:09:12,340
wasn't it?

5069
02:09:12,340 --> 02:09:12,461
Yeah,

5070
02:09:12,461 --> 02:09:13,294
I think so.

5071
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:15,430
It was a terrible decision.

5072
02:09:15,470 --> 02:09:15,710
Yeah.

5073
02:09:15,710 --> 02:09:17,800
They're getting too
crazy with the standups.

5074
02:09:18,510 --> 02:09:19,331
Too crazy with it.

5075
02:09:19,331 --> 02:09:19,630
They,

5076
02:09:19,630 --> 02:09:19,890
they,

5077
02:09:19,890 --> 02:09:20,620
they need a,

5078
02:09:20,620 --> 02:09:21,730
they need to relax.

5079
02:09:21,970 --> 02:09:22,181
Well,

5080
02:09:22,181 --> 02:09:24,310
especially in that situation,

5081
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:27,880
you've got a guy who's a strangulation
expert that finally gets to clench on a

5082
02:09:27,881 --> 02:09:28,900
world class wrestler,

5083
02:09:28,901 --> 02:09:29,681
especially in those early,

5084
02:09:29,681 --> 02:09:30,431
in the first round,

5085
02:09:30,431 --> 02:09:31,211
early in the first round.

5086
02:09:31,211 --> 02:09:32,220
Got a real good position and I'm,

5087
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:34,990
and you also have to think,

5088
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:37,900
Maya took this fight was zero great camp.

5089
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:38,891
Oh Shit.

5090
02:09:38,891 --> 02:09:39,160
And He,

5091
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:39,400
Neil,

5092
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:40,070
Neil,

5093
02:09:40,070 --> 02:09:40,330
Neil,

5094
02:09:40,330 --> 02:09:41,163
Neil,

5095
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:42,213
Neil,

5096
02:09:43,570 --> 02:09:44,650
Neil's whooping and death.

5097
02:09:45,010 --> 02:09:45,670
He's hurt.

5098
02:09:45,670 --> 02:09:46,031
Come on.

5099
02:09:46,031 --> 02:09:47,290
You know we need him right in the face.

5100
02:09:47,310 --> 02:09:47,430
Yeah.

5101
02:09:47,430 --> 02:09:49,420
Did because it was legal for sure.

5102
02:09:49,421 --> 02:09:50,254
Illegal.

5103
02:09:51,140 --> 02:09:51,341
Oh,

5104
02:09:51,341 --> 02:09:51,650
he's,

5105
02:09:51,650 --> 02:09:51,801
oh,

5106
02:09:51,801 --> 02:09:52,634
he's out.

5107
02:09:53,130 --> 02:09:53,380
Neil.

5108
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:54,280
Neil Magnus round.

5109
02:09:54,281 --> 02:09:55,880
Baby big.

5110
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:56,833
He'll magni.

5111
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:57,671
No.

5112
02:09:57,671 --> 02:10:01,330
Magni stopping motherfuckers
powerful back on Neil.

5113
02:10:01,990 --> 02:10:02,201
Yeah,

5114
02:10:02,201 --> 02:10:03,370
he's a long dude.

5115
02:10:03,371 --> 02:10:03,610
Huh?

5116
02:10:03,610 --> 02:10:05,680
That's about as long as it
gets from one seventh grade.

5117
02:10:05,681 --> 02:10:06,580
Cardio Long.

5118
02:10:07,630 --> 02:10:07,931
Yeah.

5119
02:10:07,931 --> 02:10:09,490
And good fight Iq.

5120
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:10,353
You know,

5121
02:10:10,430 --> 02:10:10,950
whatever.

5122
02:10:10,950 --> 02:10:12,610
I'll never blows his wad.

5123
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:14,620
He's always in there like,

5124
02:10:14,621 --> 02:10:15,310
look at that.

5125
02:10:15,310 --> 02:10:17,710
Just finished the guys
barely breathing heavy.

5126
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:19,300
Be seriously man.

5127
02:10:19,301 --> 02:10:21,060
That dude is in fucking shake.

5128
02:10:21,190 --> 02:10:22,110
He's always been that way,

5129
02:10:22,111 --> 02:10:22,720
man.

5130
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:24,460
Is that just a discipline thing?

5131
02:10:24,670 --> 02:10:26,320
Just always trained military guy.

5132
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:27,173
Yeah.

5133
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:28,840
Also a Denver thing,

5134
02:10:28,841 --> 02:10:29,350
right?

5135
02:10:29,350 --> 02:10:29,471
Oh,

5136
02:10:29,471 --> 02:10:30,101
isn't that high?

5137
02:10:30,101 --> 02:10:32,920
I was in Chicago at the same
fucking cardio because I was,

5138
02:10:33,530 --> 02:10:36,830
I was one of the coaches on the ultimate
fighter 14 he came off that season.

5139
02:10:36,831 --> 02:10:37,401
Even then they're like,

5140
02:10:37,401 --> 02:10:37,581
dude,

5141
02:10:37,581 --> 02:10:39,020
look at the cardio on Neal.

5142
02:10:39,250 --> 02:10:40,370
What does he do for Cardio?

5143
02:10:40,371 --> 02:10:41,240
You know him well,

5144
02:10:41,550 --> 02:10:43,130
but he just training nonstop.

5145
02:10:43,930 --> 02:10:46,670
Nate mark heart when he first
came in Denver and he just kept,

5146
02:10:46,850 --> 02:10:47,061
you know,

5147
02:10:47,061 --> 02:10:48,170
Nate train nonstop,

5148
02:10:48,171 --> 02:10:49,790
so he just kind of took on that role.

5149
02:10:50,180 --> 02:10:51,013
He just trades now.

5150
02:10:51,350 --> 02:10:51,950
Retired.

5151
02:10:51,950 --> 02:10:52,550
Yes,

5152
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:52,980
it's done.

5153
02:10:52,980 --> 02:10:53,813
That's good.

5154
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:55,190
Just doing the Lord's work now.

5155
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:56,113
Oh,

5156
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:57,410
what kind of work is that?

5157
02:10:58,060 --> 02:10:59,720
I had whatever the Lord wants him to do.

5158
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:01,040
Wasn't worth saying.

5159
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:03,440
I think a sell bibles.

5160
02:11:03,441 --> 02:11:04,400
I don't know what they do.

5161
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:05,473
I don't know man.

5162
02:11:05,490 --> 02:11:06,830
So he's working for a church or something?

5163
02:11:06,831 --> 02:11:07,440
I think so.

5164
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:09,300
We just kept trying to become a
priest or something like that.

5165
02:11:11,270 --> 02:11:13,160
He was always super religious.

5166
02:11:13,670 --> 02:11:14,330
Always.

5167
02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:14,960
Yeah.

5168
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:15,771
I'm glad he's retired,

5169
02:11:15,771 --> 02:11:16,460
right guy.

5170
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:17,510
He had a lot of great fights,

5171
02:11:17,511 --> 02:11:17,840
man.

5172
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:18,860
A lot of great fights.

5173
02:11:18,861 --> 02:11:19,790
One of the great snake,

5174
02:11:19,791 --> 02:11:20,270

5175
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:24,680

the Strikeforce welterweight

Yeah.

5178
02:11:27,471 --> 02:11:30,470
Literally Combo elbows the best.

5179
02:11:30,970 --> 02:11:32,580
I love the elbows and opera cuts,

5180
02:11:32,581 --> 02:11:32,990
son.

5181
02:11:32,990 --> 02:11:33,621
He's so good.

5182
02:11:33,621 --> 02:11:34,280
In tough.

5183
02:11:34,280 --> 02:11:34,521
Yeah,

5184
02:11:34,521 --> 02:11:35,180
man.

5185
02:11:35,180 --> 02:11:36,013
For sure.

5186
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:37,610
He uh,

5187
02:11:37,610 --> 02:11:42,610
he's a guy that kind of like was real
active and like real proficient before

5188
02:11:44,451 --> 02:11:46,130
anybody knew anything about MMA.

5189
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:47,630
He started when he 17.

5190
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:49,630
Joey Joey's,

5191
02:11:49,900 --> 02:11:51,510
he called me a couple of times.

5192
02:11:51,511 --> 02:11:54,330
Should I answer the
phone and call him back?

5193
02:11:55,510 --> 02:11:55,920
Listen,

5194
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:56,753
sucker

5195
02:11:58,350 --> 02:11:59,620
made a watch that Derek till

5196
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:04,230
Darrin tells over there
eating pop tarts away.

5197
02:12:04,310 --> 02:12:05,330
500 pounds.

5198
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:07,460
He's talking about Mckinsey
turns ass last night again.

5199
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:10,220
He's terrible about that job.

5200
02:12:10,230 --> 02:12:11,990
Would he take Atkins weight?

5201
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:12,611
Think that's smells.

5202
02:12:12,611 --> 02:12:13,550
What do you think happened?

5203
02:12:14,150 --> 02:12:15,060
You think she's just eating

5204
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:16,113
fuck time.

5205
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:17,941
I don't know Joey.

5206
02:12:17,941 --> 02:12:20,730
I don't know what Percy
Miss Weight by seven pounds.

5207
02:12:20,731 --> 02:12:22,050
She's fucking smoking though,

5208
02:12:22,051 --> 02:12:22,830
right?

5209
02:12:22,830 --> 02:12:24,000
She's very attractive girl.

5210
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,280
Joey's right now in the middle of bonding.

5211
02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:28,550
It's a can't answer that phone.

5212
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:30,353
He'll answer.

5213
02:12:30,570 --> 02:12:31,140
Hmm.

5214
02:12:31,140 --> 02:12:31,780
Really?

5215
02:12:31,780 --> 02:12:31,960
Yeah.

5216
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:32,470
I'm surprised.

5217
02:12:32,470 --> 02:12:33,303
Go to

5218
02:12:34,970 --> 02:12:35,950
that's not there.

5219
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:36,873
He's calling me.

5220
02:12:38,130 --> 02:12:38,251
Oh,

5221
02:12:38,251 --> 02:12:39,084
there it is.

5222
02:12:39,150 --> 02:12:42,000
I call you back where you been dog.

5223
02:12:45,130 --> 02:12:45,963

5224
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:50,590

5225
02:12:50,590 --> 02:12:51,610
We're on Jre la.

5226
02:12:51,650 --> 02:12:52,900
A fight companion live.

5227
02:12:53,140 --> 02:12:53,973
What's up

5228
02:12:59,410 --> 02:13:03,250
time to watch people kick each
other in the fucking head.

5229
02:13:04,630 --> 02:13:05,231
You're on the air.

5230
02:13:05,231 --> 02:13:06,260
You on speakerphone.

5231
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:11,440
You're what?

5232
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:15,370
Oh,

5233
02:13:15,370 --> 02:13:16,080

5234
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:16,840
Ah.

5235
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:18,910
This Friday in San Francisco.

5236
02:13:20,710 --> 02:13:22,540
One day this week on the show to discuss.

5237
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:24,073
You'll call me.

5238
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:27,290
What do you call that?

5239
02:13:27,580 --> 02:13:28,301
Fucking extra,

5240
02:13:28,301 --> 02:13:30,180
extra terrestrial fucking comic.

5241
02:13:30,190 --> 02:13:31,023
Whatever the fuck

5242
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:39,560
Martian comedy.

5243
02:13:40,620 --> 02:13:41,453
What?

5244
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:45,593
Right.

5245
02:13:50,840 --> 02:13:51,700
Smoking the weed.

5246
02:13:51,820 --> 02:13:52,461
Daddy smoked.

5247
02:13:52,461 --> 02:13:53,294
You know what I'm saying?

5248
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:59,800
Next week I'm going to tell a new asshole
that came out last night to see uncle

5249
02:14:00,211 --> 02:14:01,044
Joey.

5250
02:14:01,130 --> 02:14:03,380
I was dropping fucking no jokes on him.

5251
02:14:03,381 --> 02:14:03,741
His Shit.

5252
02:14:03,741 --> 02:14:07,730
I'm ready to go dog cryotherapy right now.

5253
02:14:08,590 --> 02:14:10,880
Just listen to the dogs by pink Floyd

5254
02:14:12,380 --> 02:14:12,940
therapy.

5255
02:14:12,940 --> 02:14:17,390
Then I'm going to pop up fucking podcast
and I'm doing a few spots that I had to

5256
02:14:17,391 --> 02:14:21,370
let these motherfuckers know
who's running things and I said

5257
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:27,860
Phil against Wonderboy and
my man against the other guy.

5258
02:14:28,250 --> 02:14:29,600
I'll watch it tonight on tape.

5259
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:30,761
Joey,

5260
02:14:30,761 --> 02:14:31,421
what time?

5261
02:14:31,421 --> 02:14:33,790
What time are you tapings on June 4th,

5262
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:37,800
seven and 9:00 PM in Las Vegas.

5263
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:38,581
We're at,

5264
02:14:38,581 --> 02:14:38,881
where are the,

5265
02:14:38,881 --> 02:14:41,820
where are they filming at downtown,

5266
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:43,260
I think someplace they got.

5267
02:14:43,261 --> 02:14:44,280
It's a small place.

5268
02:14:44,281 --> 02:14:45,480
Joe was made for us.

5269
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:48,720
It's like a hundred seats
less than the original room.

5270
02:14:48,721 --> 02:14:49,554
Nice and tight.

5271
02:14:49,790 --> 02:14:50,460
Really?

5272
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:51,120
It's like,

5273
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:52,050
it's like Providence,

5274
02:14:52,051 --> 02:14:52,561
Rhode Island.

5275
02:14:52,561 --> 02:14:54,150
When was the last time
you went to province?

5276
02:14:54,210 --> 02:14:55,220
A couple years ago.

5277
02:14:56,070 --> 02:14:57,180
That comedy connection.

5278
02:14:57,510 --> 02:14:58,530
Fucking deadly.

5279
02:14:58,890 --> 02:15:00,140
It's deadly in that.

5280
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:04,560
So is this is the same
type of layout to 50 to 40?

5281
02:15:04,670 --> 02:15:05,880
Are there tickets available?

5282
02:15:07,250 --> 02:15:07,590
Uh,

5283
02:15:07,590 --> 02:15:08,820
there's no tickets available.

5284
02:15:08,821 --> 02:15:09,031
I mean,

5285
02:15:09,031 --> 02:15:09,841
there's something for you.

5286
02:15:09,841 --> 02:15:10,530
You know what I'm saying?

5287
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:11,363
Right.

5288
02:15:11,540 --> 02:15:11,821
If you,

5289
02:15:11,821 --> 02:15:13,170
if you show up in the helicopter,

5290
02:15:13,171 --> 02:15:14,004
I can't deny it.

5291
02:15:16,810 --> 02:15:17,541
Batmobile.

5292
02:15:17,541 --> 02:15:18,374
I'll go down

5293
02:15:19,470 --> 02:15:20,970
than what you'll know days.

5294
02:15:21,010 --> 02:15:21,843
You know what I'm saying?

5295
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:25,520
You just walk in and take the fucking
mic and tell people what's time.

5296
02:15:25,521 --> 02:15:26,680
But it's beautiful,

5297
02:15:26,950 --> 02:15:27,610
but that's it.

5298
02:15:27,610 --> 02:15:28,443
There's nothing available.

5299
02:15:28,490 --> 02:15:30,260
I can't wait for people
to see that special.

5300
02:15:30,261 --> 02:15:32,030
Joey's going to be fucking nuts.

5301
02:15:32,740 --> 02:15:33,491
I'm working hard.

5302
02:15:33,491 --> 02:15:35,050
I've never worked this hard in my life.

5303
02:15:35,051 --> 02:15:39,540
I didn't know the meaning of this and so
I listen to you or the tapings and try

5304
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:42,710
and shit and now I'm
just doing 28 minutes.

5305
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:45,770
That's all week 28 28 28 Oo,

5306
02:15:45,910 --> 02:15:46,743
I got to get the big,

5307
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:51,160
I got to get the beginning more jazzed
up because I got to make them watch so I

5308
02:15:51,161 --> 02:15:53,140
got to go out there like a fucking medial,

5309
02:15:53,141 --> 02:15:53,831
you understand me?

5310
02:15:53,831 --> 02:15:57,550
I gotta go out there and hold them
until like 14 minutes and let him,

5311
02:15:57,580 --> 02:15:58,600
I got the strategy.

5312
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:04,080
I'm going to go out there and fucking
just go off for about 14 and then we go to

5313
02:16:04,121 --> 02:16:06,840
us different corners
and then they come on.

5314
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:07,810
I pick my shots.

5315
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:13,120
I just picked my fucking shots
like when fucking Eddie's guys,

5316
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:17,010
what that dude and he fucking
the really good striker.

5317
02:16:17,020 --> 02:16:21,370
I got to pick my shots in the second round
and then the third round go out there

5318
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:26,260
and just fucking flip point combinations
ending with leg kicks the tent down

5319
02:16:26,261 --> 02:16:28,030
than the until you can't take it no more.

5320
02:16:28,031 --> 02:16:28,864
You know what I'm saying?

5321
02:16:29,010 --> 02:16:30,370
That's the strategy

5322
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:31,190
right there.

5323
02:16:31,190 --> 02:16:33,010
I'm breaking it down to three rounds.

5324
02:16:33,011 --> 02:16:33,844
Joe Rogan,

5325
02:16:34,030 --> 02:16:35,040
you did it last night.

5326
02:16:35,041 --> 02:16:36,310
Joey you did last night.

5327
02:16:36,311 --> 02:16:37,031
The Ice House.

5328
02:16:37,031 --> 02:16:37,301
He said,

5329
02:16:37,301 --> 02:16:37,870
I told Jay,

5330
02:16:37,870 --> 02:16:39,760
I told Rodney set him on fire man.

5331
02:16:40,610 --> 02:16:40,941
Yeah,

5332
02:16:40,941 --> 02:16:41,211
no,

5333
02:16:41,211 --> 02:16:41,361
no,

5334
02:16:41,361 --> 02:16:41,541
no.

5335
02:16:41,541 --> 02:16:45,070
I broke it down to three rounds
and I'm cutting back and adding,

5336
02:16:45,140 --> 02:16:45,801
you know what I'm saying?

5337
02:16:45,801 --> 02:16:46,281
I'm cutting.

5338
02:16:46,281 --> 02:16:48,080
I'm looking at it like an MMA fighter.

5339
02:16:48,710 --> 02:16:50,110
So I'm training for a fight.

5340
02:16:50,111 --> 02:16:55,040
So the first 11 minutes you guys fucked
and I got to jump on your criminal shit.

5341
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:56,260
Like old school retool it.

5342
02:16:56,261 --> 02:16:56,420
Yeah,

5343
02:16:56,420 --> 02:16:58,010
the whole fucking old school.

5344
02:16:58,011 --> 02:17:00,890
Old School veto the second round.

5345
02:17:00,891 --> 02:17:02,260
I'm just picking my shots like,

5346
02:17:02,261 --> 02:17:03,094
like uh,

5347
02:17:03,130 --> 02:17:03,631
you've guy,

5348
02:17:03,631 --> 02:17:06,440
I guess Edson Barboza you picked his shot.

5349
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:07,760
He picked them apart.

5350
02:17:08,060 --> 02:17:09,070
He kicked him in the side.

5351
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:10,690
You fucked up the of road.

5352
02:17:11,050 --> 02:17:16,050
He kicks up her body and then the third
round I come out like fucking that black

5353
02:17:17,601 --> 02:17:21,470
dude in the 70s that sport when they
gave him the bottle filled with cocaine,

5354
02:17:21,471 --> 02:17:22,304
milk,

5355
02:17:22,670 --> 02:17:23,503
go roping,

5356
02:17:25,050 --> 02:17:27,800
drop some knowledge on the fuckers.

5357
02:17:27,830 --> 02:17:28,510
Don't know.

5358
02:17:28,510 --> 02:17:30,200
Thick bottle.

5359
02:17:30,260 --> 02:17:30,891
That's right.

5360
02:17:30,891 --> 02:17:31,221
Same.

5361
02:17:31,221 --> 02:17:33,540
One thing that brought up for
the fight against out though.

5362
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:37,440
Okay.

5363
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:40,260
That's the same one that gave
fucking toddler gets out though.

5364
02:17:41,550 --> 02:17:44,790
Don't tell me I know the
characteristics of that fucking know.

5365
02:17:48,450 --> 02:17:49,283
Ah,

5366
02:17:49,670 --> 02:17:54,510
you pick your dealing with in the third
round we come out like fucking all my

5367
02:17:54,570 --> 02:17:56,270
Brian was that trainer's name.

5368
02:17:58,580 --> 02:17:59,413
Is that a manual?

5369
02:17:59,950 --> 02:18:00,783
Joe Rogan.

5370
02:18:01,940 --> 02:18:03,080
We're watching it right now.

5371
02:18:03,081 --> 02:18:03,471
Jamie.

5372
02:18:03,471 --> 02:18:06,870
Just put it on the legs
is Arguayo Alexis Aguayo,

5373
02:18:06,890 --> 02:18:07,770
Aaron Pryor,

5374
02:18:10,250 --> 02:18:11,150
Panama Lewis.

5375
02:18:11,260 --> 02:18:14,160
I had my one was getting the
bottle would be original shit.

5376
02:18:14,630 --> 02:18:18,440
It shouldn't over Django
was sending up talking shit.

5377
02:18:18,590 --> 02:18:18,930
Yeah,

5378
02:18:18,930 --> 02:18:22,080
he gave me tell him some coconut
water rainbow looking back

5379
02:18:22,340 --> 02:18:26,660
and then Aaron Pryor came out just
throwing bombs and fuck the Aguayo up.

5380
02:18:26,690 --> 02:18:28,160
That was a great fight,

5381
02:18:28,161 --> 02:18:28,994
man.

5382
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:31,490
This is the way you gotta do it,

5383
02:18:32,540 --> 02:18:32,960
man.

5384
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:34,100
Old School boxing.

5385
02:18:34,430 --> 02:18:35,263
Aaron Pryor,

5386
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:36,373
the bottle.

5387
02:18:36,590 --> 02:18:37,423
It's fights.

5388
02:18:37,660 --> 02:18:38,240
He's like,

5389
02:18:38,240 --> 02:18:41,440
they get called the bottle that I
said get on the bottle that I did.

5390
02:18:41,450 --> 02:18:42,710
They capture that on video.

5391
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:43,700
It has a bottle

5392
02:18:45,250 --> 02:18:49,670
like give him the bottle that I
met up with smoke coming out of it.

5393
02:18:50,810 --> 02:18:52,550
I wonder what the fuck was in that thing.

5394
02:18:52,640 --> 02:18:54,510
Cocaine did.

5395
02:18:54,550 --> 02:18:54,801
Damn,

5396
02:18:54,801 --> 02:18:56,510
he's doing work.

5397
02:18:56,570 --> 02:18:57,403
Look at him,

5398
02:18:57,430 --> 02:18:57,860
you know,

5399
02:18:57,860 --> 02:18:58,490
get the other one.

5400
02:18:58,490 --> 02:18:59,330
The one that I'm mixed.

5401
02:18:59,860 --> 02:19:00,231
I look at it.

5402
02:19:00,231 --> 02:19:00,411
Okay.

5403
02:19:00,411 --> 02:19:01,380
There's no,

5404
02:19:01,580 --> 02:19:01,681
no,

5405
02:19:01,681 --> 02:19:01,851
no,

5406
02:19:01,851 --> 02:19:02,630
not that one.

5407
02:19:02,630 --> 02:19:03,463
Give me the other one.

5408
02:19:04,290 --> 02:19:04,930
Yeah.

5409
02:19:04,930 --> 02:19:06,830
How fucking beautiful is that?

5410
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:07,673
That's one bottle.

5411
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:09,040
He's going to sniff and shit.

5412
02:19:09,630 --> 02:19:09,920
No,

5413
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:10,753
that dragon was,

5414
02:19:10,810 --> 02:19:11,710
and that was the one he goes,

5415
02:19:11,711 --> 02:19:13,810
give me that one thing.

5416
02:19:13,870 --> 02:19:15,540
He got hurt before he fucked up.

5417
02:19:16,050 --> 02:19:18,010
Guayle had a nasty right hand man.

5418
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:19,880
Okay.

5419
02:19:19,880 --> 02:19:20,850
And he was watery.

5420
02:19:20,851 --> 02:19:21,830
His shit wrong.

5421
02:19:22,050 --> 02:19:23,610
So this is not the main event,

5422
02:19:23,611 --> 02:19:23,941
is it?

5423
02:19:23,941 --> 02:19:24,301
Yeah.

5424
02:19:24,301 --> 02:19:25,290
This is the main event.

5425
02:19:25,350 --> 02:19:26,190
Can we are all right,

5426
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:27,510
let's go right to,

5427
02:19:27,570 --> 02:19:28,403
to the fight,

5428
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:28,830
Joe.

5429
02:19:28,830 --> 02:19:28,970
We,

5430
02:19:28,970 --> 02:19:30,340
we're about to watch wanting to boyfriend.

5431
02:19:30,341 --> 02:19:30,831
He's still,

5432
02:19:30,831 --> 02:19:31,664
we love you man.

5433
02:19:32,810 --> 02:19:33,920
I will see you this week,

5434
02:19:33,921 --> 02:19:34,261
brothers.

5435
02:19:34,261 --> 02:19:35,170
Thank you man.

5436
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:35,740
See it.

5437
02:19:35,740 --> 02:19:37,940
But here's Darren till,

5438
02:19:38,750 --> 02:19:39,620
who's better than him?

5439
02:19:39,770 --> 02:19:40,603
He's the best.

5440
02:19:40,630 --> 02:19:41,510
His love that guy.

5441
02:19:42,160 --> 02:19:42,360
Oh,

5442
02:19:42,360 --> 02:19:44,080
then Joey saying till,

5443
02:19:44,090 --> 02:19:44,301
I'm like,

5444
02:19:44,301 --> 02:19:46,350
well right now.

5445
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:48,081
Well,

5446
02:19:48,081 --> 02:19:50,840
it's kind of amazing that he's
even top 10 with one win over.

5447
02:19:50,841 --> 02:19:53,780
A big guy in Donald Cerrone
is really 155 pounder.

5448
02:19:53,810 --> 02:19:53,961
Yeah,

5449
02:19:53,961 --> 02:19:54,350
it's very,

5450
02:19:54,350 --> 02:19:54,521
it's,

5451
02:19:54,521 --> 02:19:56,840
it's insane that I'm picking
them to win the fight,

5452
02:19:57,410 --> 02:19:59,930
but I am not a fan of
how they do the ratings,

5453
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:00,530
I think.

5454
02:20:00,530 --> 02:20:02,960
Do you think that's a Fox thing?

5455
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:04,520
So is he as being in a stick with it?

5456
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:05,241
I don't know.

5457
02:20:05,241 --> 02:20:07,610
Is it foxes decide decision that was,

5458
02:20:07,611 --> 02:20:09,050
that was one of Fox deals.

5459
02:20:09,051 --> 02:20:11,720
They want rankings because they didn't
think the public could understand.

5460
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:12,201
You know,

5461
02:20:12,201 --> 02:20:17,201
who was who without the rankings to
arbitrary in to the two disagreed upon by

5462
02:20:18,030 --> 02:20:18,920
high level people,

5463
02:20:19,010 --> 02:20:19,760
it will not,

5464
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:20,571
no matter how you do it,

5465
02:20:20,571 --> 02:20:21,530
you can never get it right.

5466
02:20:21,530 --> 02:20:23,240
So you might as well just
try it and just let it,

5467
02:20:23,241 --> 02:20:23,990
you know,

5468
02:20:23,990 --> 02:20:24,620
let it fly.

5469
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:25,520
You've got to have rank.

5470
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:26,301
This is the problem.

5471
02:20:26,301 --> 02:20:26,961
You just let it fly.

5472
02:20:26,961 --> 02:20:27,681
Is fighters going,

5473
02:20:27,681 --> 02:20:27,951
wait,

5474
02:20:27,951 --> 02:20:28,430
he's,

5475
02:20:28,430 --> 02:20:29,300
he's six,

5476
02:20:29,301 --> 02:20:29,911
but I'm five.

5477
02:20:29,911 --> 02:20:30,980
I'm not fighting six men.

5478
02:20:31,070 --> 02:20:33,240
I want to fight for it.

5479
02:20:33,410 --> 02:20:34,720
We didn't know what was right.

5480
02:20:34,770 --> 02:20:35,511
We didn't know what I want to do.

5481
02:20:35,511 --> 02:20:35,830
What is right,

5482
02:20:35,830 --> 02:20:36,680
what pride did.

5483
02:20:36,681 --> 02:20:37,550
Just make them fight.

5484
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:38,240
If you,

5485
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:39,073
if you,

5486
02:20:39,110 --> 02:20:40,130
they trying to fight.

5487
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:41,630
I'll never ask you again.

5488
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:42,493
They try.

5489
02:20:42,980 --> 02:20:44,030
This is exciting man.

5490
02:20:44,031 --> 02:20:45,500
I'm fucking pumped for this fight.

5491
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:45,651
It,

5492
02:20:45,651 --> 02:20:46,610
they took long enough.

5493
02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:50,240
I feel like we've been around until we
got those old school tie tattoos on his

5494
02:20:50,241 --> 02:20:50,810
back.

5495
02:20:50,810 --> 02:20:51,920
The kind of tap in.

5496
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:54,860
They do that with the fucking the tapper.

5497
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:55,850
You ever seen house?

5498
02:20:55,850 --> 02:20:58,790
That's old school tappers temple tattoos.

5499
02:21:00,170 --> 02:21:01,670
Is that his girlfriend on his arm?

5500
02:21:02,510 --> 02:21:03,680
I think it's his older girlfriend.

5501
02:21:03,700 --> 02:21:04,580
Or is it is not at,

5502
02:21:04,581 --> 02:21:05,414
oh

5503
02:21:06,680 --> 02:21:07,910
now he probably got them in Brazil.

5504
02:21:07,911 --> 02:21:08,280
They prayer pregnant,

5505
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:09,320
have the best tattoo artists.

5506
02:21:09,321 --> 02:21:10,910
But remember he was
young when he got that.

5507
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:12,113
Did the tattoo.

5508
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:13,033
Yeah.

5509
02:21:13,070 --> 02:21:14,000
It looks like Charlene,

5510
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:17,840
you think there's a guy out there with a
tattoo of a chicken is like a one night

5511
02:21:17,841 --> 02:21:19,950
stand like one crazy horse.

5512
02:21:20,590 --> 02:21:22,060
That was the hottest chick ever.

5513
02:21:22,061 --> 02:21:23,270
It was probably a million guys.

5514
02:21:23,271 --> 02:21:23,960
Yeah,

5515
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:24,950
with the one nights then.

5516
02:21:25,530 --> 02:21:26,000
Yeah.

5517
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:26,470
She sucked.

5518
02:21:26,470 --> 02:21:27,390
Amena stick everything.

5519
02:21:27,391 --> 02:21:28,224
I mean

5520
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:31,490
I'm putting her on my back.

5521
02:21:31,640 --> 02:21:33,560
Respect reach back girl.

5522
02:21:34,060 --> 02:21:35,600
His girlfriend is his girlfriend.

5523
02:21:35,690 --> 02:21:36,110
Here we go.

5524
02:21:36,110 --> 02:21:36,830
Okay.

5525
02:21:36,830 --> 02:21:37,663
So um,

5526
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:39,380
that's a commitment right there,

5527
02:21:39,381 --> 02:21:39,740
right?

5528
02:21:39,740 --> 02:21:41,150
Mary heard you're into that one.

5529
02:21:41,990 --> 02:21:43,610
That's how scared dudes our marriage.

5530
02:21:43,611 --> 02:21:43,880
Look,

5531
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:47,350
I'll tattoo on my arm for my kid.

5532
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:48,193
Married

5533
02:21:50,210 --> 02:21:51,590
marriage is too prominent.

5534
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:53,030
It's too dangerous.

5535
02:21:56,120 --> 02:21:57,710
So many people scared of that marriage,

5536
02:21:57,711 --> 02:21:58,490
buddy.

5537
02:21:58,490 --> 02:21:58,881
Here we go.

5538
02:21:58,881 --> 02:22:01,890
Goes Darren till the sun.

5539
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:02,571
I crowd,

5540
02:22:02,571 --> 02:22:02,751
man.

5541
02:22:02,751 --> 02:22:03,201
It's too bad.

5542
02:22:03,201 --> 02:22:04,550
Liverpool last yesterday.

5543
02:22:04,640 --> 02:22:06,160
Otherwise this place be fucking even.

5544
02:22:06,161 --> 02:22:06,994
I'm more fire

5545
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:10,610
this big moment for this kid.

5546
02:22:10,670 --> 02:22:11,503
Big Moment.

5547
02:22:12,230 --> 02:22:13,840
We're going to find out a lot of on hands,

5548
02:22:13,870 --> 02:22:14,270
man.

5549
02:22:14,270 --> 02:22:14,781
He's big,

5550
02:22:14,781 --> 02:22:16,040
but so it's one deployment.

5551
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:17,510
Wonderboy is a tall fella.

5552
02:22:17,511 --> 02:22:18,520
He's an inch tall.

5553
02:22:18,530 --> 02:22:19,580
Wonder was not as media,

5554
02:22:19,581 --> 02:22:19,970
is he?

5555
02:22:19,970 --> 02:22:20,211
No,

5556
02:22:20,211 --> 02:22:21,044
he's not.

5557
02:22:21,290 --> 02:22:21,531
Wonder.

5558
02:22:21,531 --> 02:22:22,610
Boy's name is Wonderboy.

5559
02:22:22,630 --> 02:22:23,930
His is the gorilla.

5560
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:24,853
Yeah,

5561
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:26,070
but who named Wonderboy?

5562
02:22:26,071 --> 02:22:26,820
Wonderboy.

5563
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:27,730
And who named the grill?

5564
02:22:27,731 --> 02:22:28,290
The gorilla.

5565
02:22:28,290 --> 02:22:28,591
See,

5566
02:22:28,591 --> 02:22:29,270
that's it.

5567
02:22:29,270 --> 02:22:30,360
That's what's important.

5568
02:22:30,361 --> 02:22:30,930
That's what's up.

5569
02:22:30,930 --> 02:22:31,170
Yeah.

5570
02:22:31,170 --> 02:22:32,160
I don't want to find that out.

5571
02:22:32,220 --> 02:22:34,830
What if you called yourself
a big people would be like,

5572
02:22:34,831 --> 02:22:37,560
get off to a terrible guy yourself.

5573
02:22:37,561 --> 02:22:38,221
Big Brown.

5574
02:22:38,221 --> 02:22:39,054
It's weird.

5575
02:22:39,530 --> 02:22:39,810
Well,

5576
02:22:39,810 --> 02:22:40,381
what's your name,

5577
02:22:40,381 --> 02:22:40,830
man?

5578
02:22:40,830 --> 02:22:41,090
Hell.

5579
02:22:41,090 --> 02:22:41,331
Toda.

5580
02:22:41,331 --> 02:22:42,164
Nado.

5581
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:43,473
Where'd that come out with?

5582
02:22:43,530 --> 02:22:43,800
Well,

5583
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:45,240
sitting around thinking about nicknames.

5584
02:22:46,410 --> 02:22:47,243
Fuck Outta here.

5585
02:22:49,170 --> 02:22:50,940
Dan Hardee gave him the
nickname of the gorilla.

5586
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:51,331
Oh,

5587
02:22:51,331 --> 02:22:51,960
there you go.

5588
02:22:51,960 --> 02:22:52,770
That makes sense.

5589
02:22:52,770 --> 02:22:53,980
How long ago did you get to them?

5590
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:54,631
Well,

5591
02:22:54,631 --> 02:22:59,631
this says he officially accepted it
as of January 20th so cheers man.

5592
02:23:00,390 --> 02:23:01,223
Real recent.

5593
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:01,580
Both.

5594
02:23:01,580 --> 02:23:02,190
Fuck,

5595
02:23:02,190 --> 02:23:03,550
what was his name then?

5596
02:23:03,810 --> 02:23:03,991
Well,

5597
02:23:03,991 --> 02:23:04,824
I didn't know.

5598
02:23:04,980 --> 02:23:05,820
I didn't know Dan hard.

5599
02:23:05,821 --> 02:23:06,341
Is it gone?

5600
02:23:06,341 --> 02:23:10,320
I just refer to him as the gorilla and
then three days ago he wrote with it.

5601
02:23:10,321 --> 02:23:12,030
I thought this was his
name for a while now.

5602
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:12,991
Well,

5603
02:23:12,991 --> 02:23:13,830
it's January.

5604
02:23:13,831 --> 02:23:14,850
We're into may,

5605
02:23:15,270 --> 02:23:17,230
so it's technically ma.

5606
02:23:17,310 --> 02:23:18,930
I mean after he beat what?

5607
02:23:18,931 --> 02:23:19,111
What?

5608
02:23:19,111 --> 02:23:22,520
How long does a man have to keep a
nickname before it's a legit name.

5609
02:23:22,550 --> 02:23:24,170
Fuck Bro.

5610
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:25,950
It's on spoken rule.

5611
02:23:26,090 --> 02:23:27,120
Could decide kick.

5612
02:23:27,150 --> 02:23:28,040
I don't have a nickname.

5613
02:23:29,780 --> 02:23:30,500
You want me to notice?

5614
02:23:30,500 --> 02:23:31,333
I get it.

5615
02:23:32,780 --> 02:23:33,690
I'm a wing man.

5616
02:23:33,770 --> 02:23:33,991
No,

5617
02:23:33,991 --> 02:23:34,824
but

5618
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:37,210
we,

5619
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:37,510
we,

5620
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:39,430
we know as a martial arts to ruin us.

5621
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:40,560
Like the sidekick.

5622
02:23:40,650 --> 02:23:41,870
No girl wants to fuck the side.

5623
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:43,860
That's like Robbins.

5624
02:23:45,290 --> 02:23:47,660
If you know the real meaning
to the dentist at sound.

5625
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:48,673
Right.

5626
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:51,480
The dentist also zinc in
his dick sucked in the bar.

5627
02:23:51,560 --> 02:23:53,550
She's a dentist is such
an obscure a nickname.

5628
02:23:53,551 --> 02:23:55,910
I think he got to leave Josh neer alone.

5629
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:57,000
That's his nickname.

5630
02:23:57,090 --> 02:23:58,770
That's so obscure one,

5631
02:23:59,040 --> 02:23:59,873
you know,

5632
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:04,200
but then they call Eve Edwards a
dentist at one point in time because eve

5633
02:24:04,201 --> 02:24:05,750
Edwards because of Erin's iron,

5634
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:06,060
right?

5635
02:24:06,060 --> 02:24:06,691
Yes,

5636
02:24:06,691 --> 02:24:07,524
yes.

5637
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:08,730
He destroyed it.

5638
02:24:09,990 --> 02:24:11,000
Broke his whole best.

5639
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:11,480
Right.

5640
02:24:11,480 --> 02:24:12,090
Like I'm sure,

5641
02:24:12,090 --> 02:24:13,740
and Riley was one of those tough,

5642
02:24:13,741 --> 02:24:15,010
tough journeyman.

5643
02:24:15,070 --> 02:24:15,800
Yeah,

5644
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:16,170
right.

5645
02:24:16,170 --> 02:24:16,530
Tom,

5646
02:24:16,530 --> 02:24:16,941
he wouldn't,

5647
02:24:16,941 --> 02:24:20,640
Robby Lauer made his UFC debut against
Aaron Riley and just beat the brakes off

5648
02:24:20,641 --> 02:24:21,474
of them.

5649
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:25,440
That's another super impressive
performance by half old dos Anjos right to

5650
02:24:25,441 --> 02:24:28,450
Robbie Lawler fight like holy shit.

5651
02:24:28,490 --> 02:24:29,323
It

5652
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:31,830
was an amazing fighter.

5653
02:24:31,890 --> 02:24:32,700
Amazing.

5654
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:36,150
He's like one of the best examples of
a guy was holding themselves back by

5655
02:24:36,151 --> 02:24:37,650
staying in a lower weight class.

5656
02:24:38,820 --> 02:24:40,020
He did get the belt though.

5657
02:24:40,230 --> 02:24:40,801
Yes he did,

5658
02:24:40,801 --> 02:24:41,970
but he couldn't take it anymore.

5659
02:24:41,971 --> 02:24:43,200
His body couldn't take it anymore.

5660
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:44,400
He was so big.

5661
02:24:44,670 --> 02:24:48,990
I ran into him in between fights when he
was fighting 55 and he was 200 pounds.

5662
02:24:49,350 --> 02:24:50,220
It's just too much.

5663
02:24:50,221 --> 02:24:51,840
When they start to decline a little bit.

5664
02:24:51,850 --> 02:24:53,100
Cause the weight cut was fucking with him.

5665
02:24:53,101 --> 02:24:54,590
Then he went to 70 now he's at night,

5666
02:24:54,591 --> 02:24:55,424
man.

5667
02:24:55,710 --> 02:24:56,340
Here we go.

5668
02:24:56,340 --> 02:24:57,120
Wonderboy.

5669
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:58,530
How tall is Dosantos?

5670
02:24:59,160 --> 02:25:00,180
He's short for us.

5671
02:25:00,210 --> 02:25:00,990
One 70 year,

5672
02:25:00,990 --> 02:25:01,290
right?

5673
02:25:01,290 --> 02:25:02,830
I think he's five nine shorter.

5674
02:25:03,050 --> 02:25:04,110
See if you can find that Jamie.

5675
02:25:04,710 --> 02:25:06,090
I think he might even be five eight.

5676
02:25:06,510 --> 02:25:06,751
Yeah,

5677
02:25:06,751 --> 02:25:07,110
that's,

5678
02:25:07,110 --> 02:25:09,020
that's kind of short fat

5679
02:25:12,530 --> 02:25:15,280
Kelvin's probably like five ten five nine

5680
02:25:17,530 --> 02:25:21,090
but Tyrons five nine
to write five nine no,

5681
02:25:21,091 --> 02:25:23,590
he's got five ten five 11 a way.

5682
02:25:23,591 --> 02:25:24,160
Woodley,

5683
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:24,993
Woodley.

5684
02:25:25,780 --> 02:25:26,360
I think he's five.

5685
02:25:26,360 --> 02:25:26,990
Nine.

5686
02:25:26,990 --> 02:25:27,440
He's,

5687
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:28,590
that's what's so impressive.

5688
02:25:28,690 --> 02:25:33,490
I think Woodley's five 1105 nine it
says no one's got a bigger butt donk,

5689
02:25:33,491 --> 02:25:34,324
donk than Woodley.

5690
02:25:34,570 --> 02:25:35,780
When he walks into LPS,

5691
02:25:35,980 --> 02:25:36,641
fuck it.

5692
02:25:36,641 --> 02:25:37,361
Thighs on.

5693
02:25:37,361 --> 02:25:38,800
That guy is an ass.

5694
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:40,720
He generates so much force.

5695
02:25:41,890 --> 02:25:43,600
You know I'm five nine now.

5696
02:25:43,630 --> 02:25:44,463
I'm like

5697
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:46,480
fuck yeah,

5698
02:25:46,540 --> 02:25:47,373
leg.

5699
02:25:47,790 --> 02:25:48,950
That's a medical shit.

5700
02:25:48,970 --> 02:25:51,430
They say fucking high to
say five nine motherfucker.

5701
02:25:52,210 --> 02:25:53,043
You know what I mean?

5702
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:54,520
How was the back feeling?

5703
02:25:56,060 --> 02:25:56,580
It,

5704
02:25:56,580 --> 02:25:59,290
it's hard to tell because I haven't been
able to train because of my knee and my

5705
02:25:59,291 --> 02:25:59,771
shoulder.

5706
02:25:59,771 --> 02:26:02,230
So when I get back into
my knee's feeling better,

5707
02:26:02,231 --> 02:26:04,540
I'm on the bike 30 minutes a day.

5708
02:26:04,541 --> 02:26:05,320
So,

5709
02:26:05,320 --> 02:26:05,970
um,

5710
02:26:05,970 --> 02:26:06,910
so I decided,

5711
02:26:06,940 --> 02:26:07,773
I decided,

5712
02:26:07,900 --> 02:26:10,740
I decided to hold off on the
shoulder surgery and decided,

5713
02:26:10,790 --> 02:26:11,070
yeah,

5714
02:26:11,070 --> 02:26:12,040
I didn't want to do to you.

5715
02:26:13,150 --> 02:26:13,630
What can I do?

5716
02:26:13,630 --> 02:26:14,920
I've got to shit you got wrong in there.

5717
02:26:16,060 --> 02:26:16,620
The Labor,

5718
02:26:16,620 --> 02:26:17,453
um,

5719
02:26:18,070 --> 02:26:19,920
rotator cuff and,

5720
02:26:20,140 --> 02:26:20,651
but they're saying,

5721
02:26:20,651 --> 02:26:21,010
you know,

5722
02:26:21,010 --> 02:26:21,581
I finally,

5723
02:26:21,581 --> 02:26:24,320
I got a second opinion yesterday and um,

5724
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:25,390
they told me,

5725
02:26:25,390 --> 02:26:25,750
man,

5726
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:28,180
unless it's hurting really bad,

5727
02:26:28,810 --> 02:26:31,810
just hold off on it and it hold off on it.

5728
02:26:31,811 --> 02:26:32,644
Why?

5729
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:35,381
It's just,

5730
02:26:35,381 --> 02:26:36,214
um,

5731
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:38,980
I don't want to go into surgery again,

5732
02:26:38,981 --> 02:26:39,131
man.

5733
02:26:39,131 --> 02:26:40,210
Just again,

5734
02:26:40,270 --> 02:26:43,260
I just had knee surgery and
then shoulder surgery surgery.

5735
02:26:43,270 --> 02:26:44,380
I'm just trying to rehab it with,

5736
02:26:44,820 --> 02:26:46,030
I'm going to try to rehab it with,

5737
02:26:46,080 --> 02:26:46,300
uh,

5738
02:26:46,300 --> 02:26:46,960
you know,

5739
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:48,670
like shoulder rehab exercises.

5740
02:26:48,671 --> 02:26:50,020
I'm going to go that route first.

5741
02:26:50,440 --> 02:26:52,720
And if that doesn't work
then I'll have surgery.

5742
02:26:52,721 --> 02:26:55,990
But I decided I'm not going to
have surgery on my shoulder.

5743
02:26:56,020 --> 02:26:58,180
They're doing some crazy
shit down in Panama.

5744
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:01,010
Panama is $25,000 expensive.

5745
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:03,940
And you know when Mel
Gibson was on your podcast,

5746
02:27:06,010 --> 02:27:06,843
it,

5747
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:07,833
I don't know man,

5748
02:27:08,410 --> 02:27:10,060
I'd have to it.

5749
02:27:10,300 --> 02:27:12,250
Is there a possibility that he was like,

5750
02:27:12,550 --> 02:27:12,941
you know,

5751
02:27:12,941 --> 02:27:16,330
he has some financial interest
in the company or something?

5752
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:16,781
I don't know.

5753
02:27:16,781 --> 02:27:17,441
It was hard to tell.

5754
02:27:17,441 --> 02:27:19,780
He really wanted to do it for doctor
reared and he's good friends with that.

5755
02:27:19,781 --> 02:27:20,100
Kyle,

5756
02:27:20,100 --> 02:27:20,650
did he help it?

5757
02:27:20,650 --> 02:27:23,800
So I want to believe all that Shit's real.

5758
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:24,670
I want to.

5759
02:27:24,670 --> 02:27:25,720
But every time there's,

5760
02:27:25,740 --> 02:27:26,290
there's,

5761
02:27:26,290 --> 02:27:27,280
you hear about stem cells,

5762
02:27:27,281 --> 02:27:30,790
there's a new way and they do it different
and now they're taking stem cells

5763
02:27:30,791 --> 02:27:32,050
from here instead of there.

5764
02:27:32,750 --> 02:27:34,060
Figured that shit out further.

5765
02:27:34,180 --> 02:27:34,600
Let us know.

5766
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:35,433
They're all good.

5767
02:27:36,910 --> 02:27:37,631
They're all good.

5768
02:27:37,631 --> 02:27:38,680
But they keep getting better at it.

5769
02:27:38,681 --> 02:27:42,120
But talk to Tj because Tj had
some raving things to say it,

5770
02:27:42,150 --> 02:27:47,150
but he's an actor after
the Mel Gibson podcast.

5771
02:27:48,070 --> 02:27:48,870
Oh really?

5772
02:27:48,870 --> 02:27:51,970
And after he was there before
and then he went again,

5773
02:27:52,270 --> 02:27:53,081
he went again recently.

5774
02:27:53,081 --> 02:27:53,361
He said,

5775
02:27:53,361 --> 02:27:54,610
it's why do we have to go again?

5776
02:27:54,630 --> 02:27:55,261
Go to the fights,

5777
02:27:55,261 --> 02:27:56,094
start we go,

5778
02:27:56,530 --> 02:27:56,861
Ooh,

5779
02:27:56,861 --> 02:27:58,170
I'm scared someone's gonna be some.

5780
02:27:58,570 --> 02:27:58,721
Yeah,

5781
02:27:58,721 --> 02:27:59,560
I hope that's real.

5782
02:27:59,561 --> 02:27:59,721
Man.

5783
02:27:59,721 --> 02:28:01,180
They just tap gloves
and hugged each other.

5784
02:28:01,210 --> 02:28:01,850
Holy Shit.

5785
02:28:01,850 --> 02:28:03,190
There's a lot of respect.

5786
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:04,353
This is the shirts.

5787
02:28:05,110 --> 02:28:05,591
I know.

5788
02:28:05,591 --> 02:28:07,030
I've no idea what's going to happen.

5789
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:09,720
Isn't really have no idea what's
going to have no one died.

5790
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:10,593
No idea.

5791
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:11,980
Literally no idea.

5792
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:14,110
I'm kind of nervous.

5793
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:15,460
Here we go.

5794
02:28:15,460 --> 02:28:16,293
Here we go.

5795
02:28:16,750 --> 02:28:17,583
Bam.

5796
02:28:18,140 --> 02:28:19,630
What a boy's gonna have to be smart.

5797
02:28:19,631 --> 02:28:22,010
A lot of footwear to south
paws and other big point.

5798
02:28:23,210 --> 02:28:23,900
Here we go.

5799
02:28:23,900 --> 02:28:24,890
Get the size of tils.

5800
02:28:24,891 --> 02:28:25,910
Fucking thighs.

5801
02:28:28,430 --> 02:28:28,671
Boy.

5802
02:28:28,671 --> 02:28:30,580
Their styles look at their styles.

5803
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:32,720
Both real loose,

5804
02:28:32,721 --> 02:28:36,590
but more and more based with till he's
gonna Throw Frog Lake round kicks.

5805
02:28:36,830 --> 02:28:38,230
The thing about wonder boys,

5806
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:39,650
he's all light on the toes.

5807
02:28:39,651 --> 02:28:41,390
His trigger is insane

5808
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:44,900
leg kick right away by till.

5809
02:28:46,340 --> 02:28:47,270
Very interesting.

5810
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:50,060
I'm so curious about this fight.

5811
02:28:50,061 --> 02:28:51,620
She that video to pull it out of him.

5812
02:28:51,621 --> 02:28:52,011
Sparring.

5813
02:28:52,011 --> 02:28:53,330
Just beating the shit out some day.

5814
02:28:54,050 --> 02:28:54,621
Yeah,

5815
02:28:54,621 --> 02:28:55,221
it was weird,

5816
02:28:55,221 --> 02:28:55,510
right?

5817
02:28:55,510 --> 02:28:55,700
Yeah.

5818
02:28:55,700 --> 02:28:56,533
Very strange.

5819
02:28:57,050 --> 02:28:58,430
I had heard that good,

5820
02:28:58,431 --> 02:28:59,420
but he knocked him out.

5821
02:28:59,450 --> 02:28:59,900
Yeah.

5822
02:28:59,900 --> 02:29:00,740
Hurting him too.

5823
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:02,480
I wouldn't post that if I was him.

5824
02:29:02,690 --> 02:29:03,111
Yeah.

5825
02:29:03,111 --> 02:29:03,830
And then,

5826
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:04,161
you know,

5827
02:29:04,161 --> 02:29:07,100
he posted some of him getting hit too
after that because he said people are

5828
02:29:07,101 --> 02:29:10,490
calling him a bully that I don't like
because that means he's reading the

5829
02:29:10,491 --> 02:29:11,600
comments and the,

5830
02:29:11,601 --> 02:29:13,280
he's reacting to those comments,

5831
02:29:13,430 --> 02:29:15,080
which means people can fuck with this guy.

5832
02:29:15,080 --> 02:29:16,160
If you're a young fighter,

5833
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:16,490
to me,

5834
02:29:16,490 --> 02:29:17,900
tough men to navigate through.

5835
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:19,070
Well those comments,

5836
02:29:19,071 --> 02:29:22,520
you got to leave them alone because
there's so many you're dealing with,

5837
02:29:22,521 --> 02:29:22,880
uh,

5838
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:23,810
you know,

5839
02:29:23,900 --> 02:29:28,900
a pool of thousands and thousands of
people and who knows who they are or what

5840
02:29:29,170 --> 02:29:29,910
their,

5841
02:29:29,910 --> 02:29:30,741
those Pete yet.

5842
02:29:30,741 --> 02:29:33,800
But also a lot of those people
aren't happy for your success.

5843
02:29:33,810 --> 02:29:34,660
Like Ms. Brown,

5844
02:29:34,670 --> 02:29:35,091
their life.

5845
02:29:35,091 --> 02:29:36,560
So they come of course,

5846
02:29:36,561 --> 02:29:38,180
especially a guy like Tim is on the rise,

5847
02:29:38,181 --> 02:29:38,720
you know,

5848
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:42,470
or anyone in the spotlight tries
that switch kick off the front leg.

5849
02:29:43,020 --> 02:29:45,620
UFC might want to hire someone to
help these younger guys with that.

5850
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:49,850
Well just give him a little psychological
counseling on how to handle it and get

5851
02:29:49,851 --> 02:29:52,820
a social media expert in their tils are
going to close the distance and land

5852
02:29:52,821 --> 02:29:54,050
that left hand over the top.

5853
02:29:54,051 --> 02:29:55,160
Wonderboy is not there though.

5854
02:29:55,340 --> 02:29:55,940
Yeah.

5855
02:29:55,940 --> 02:29:56,750
One voice footwork.

5856
02:29:56,750 --> 02:29:58,490
It's fricking ridiculous.

5857
02:29:58,730 --> 02:30:02,300
Well this is the perfect kind of style
ram to an aggressive guy coming forward.

5858
02:30:02,510 --> 02:30:03,670
This is what he's used to.

5859
02:30:04,040 --> 02:30:05,540
I have to imagine.

5860
02:30:05,541 --> 02:30:07,490
That's why I took the
fight to stylistically.

5861
02:30:07,610 --> 02:30:07,911
It was like,

5862
02:30:07,911 --> 02:30:08,091
yeah,

5863
02:30:08,091 --> 02:30:08,900
big guy.

5864
02:30:08,900 --> 02:30:09,471
Aggressive.

5865
02:30:09,471 --> 02:30:11,310
Let's do it right after the fight.

5866
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:12,633
Yeah.

5867
02:30:12,770 --> 02:30:13,491
Even though remarried,

5868
02:30:13,491 --> 02:30:16,760
just be Mazda doll who he's see
wondered why he shouldn't be there.

5869
02:30:16,940 --> 02:30:17,300
Right.

5870
02:30:17,300 --> 02:30:18,260
He better get the fuck out of there.

5871
02:30:18,261 --> 02:30:19,130
Don't stay there.

5872
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:19,971
Yeah,

5873
02:30:19,971 --> 02:30:23,270
he loves it but he was a little off
balance and he didn't recuperate.

5874
02:30:23,420 --> 02:30:27,830
Well Darren made a shift as he was going
to launch that leg kick and he put them

5875
02:30:27,831 --> 02:30:31,340
in a weird position
where he was off balance.

5876
02:30:32,330 --> 02:30:35,150
I mean there's some good adjustments
going on here at both guys trying to find

5877
02:30:35,151 --> 02:30:35,870
the right day.

5878
02:30:35,870 --> 02:30:36,770
Oh Shit.

5879
02:30:36,860 --> 02:30:38,280
God till likes the fire one.

5880
02:30:38,290 --> 02:30:42,560
Aleks that slide with the right hand
forward and then look off to the left.

5881
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:43,490
Are you good?

5882
02:30:43,700 --> 02:30:45,080
Oh Shit.

5883
02:30:45,110 --> 02:30:45,351
One,

5884
02:30:45,351 --> 02:30:48,920
two damn quick one to Wonderboy
letting them know it's still there.

5885
02:30:48,921 --> 02:30:49,880
Boy hasn't had a finished.

5886
02:30:49,881 --> 02:30:50,421
It's still there.

5887
02:30:50,421 --> 02:30:54,860
It looks till it tells a little hesitant
now wait a little bit now be careful

5888
02:30:54,861 --> 02:30:55,940
like a cobra man.

5889
02:30:56,450 --> 02:30:57,283
Be careful.

5890
02:30:57,290 --> 02:30:57,800
Oh,

5891
02:30:57,800 --> 02:31:01,980
you're talking about dude who was
like 57 and o was a kickboxer.

5892
02:31:02,570 --> 02:31:02,781
Good.

5893
02:31:02,781 --> 02:31:03,130
Wonderful.

5894
02:31:03,130 --> 02:31:03,950
I agree.

5895
02:31:03,950 --> 02:31:05,540
As far as high level striking,

5896
02:31:05,541 --> 02:31:09,020
I can't remember the last time two
strikers are matched up this well no.

5897
02:31:09,021 --> 02:31:11,130
And this is five round son who I'll take.

5898
02:31:11,560 --> 02:31:12,450
Ooh.

5899
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:13,341
Yeah.

5900
02:31:13,341 --> 02:31:14,870
Who knows what's going to
happen and that's fine.

5901
02:31:15,890 --> 02:31:16,760
This is interesting.

5902
02:31:17,630 --> 02:31:18,230
So,

5903
02:31:18,230 --> 02:31:19,630
so there's high level.

5904
02:31:19,631 --> 02:31:21,540
I was just trying to figure
it out with the left hand.

5905
02:31:21,570 --> 02:31:23,520
Popped him with the left hand
is caught him at the end of it.

5906
02:31:23,670 --> 02:31:25,140
Not a lot of power but reached him.

5907
02:31:26,900 --> 02:31:29,010
He's letting until know
that he's down there.

5908
02:31:29,300 --> 02:31:29,840
Yup.

5909
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:30,673
Snap.

5910
02:31:30,860 --> 02:31:32,450
He's also switching legs.

5911
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:32,941
Switches,

5912
02:31:32,941 --> 02:31:33,470
dances.

5913
02:31:33,470 --> 02:31:34,520
Now he's all sideways.

5914
02:31:34,710 --> 02:31:37,730
It's hard to find a trading
partner who's to emulate Wonderboy.

5915
02:31:37,731 --> 02:31:38,420
Man.

5916
02:31:38,420 --> 02:31:41,530
You don't really get a
real look at to buy it.

5917
02:31:43,700 --> 02:31:44,780
He's picking his shots,

5918
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:47,450
but I think he's trying to
frustrate till so till jumps.

5919
02:31:47,451 --> 02:31:47,990
It makes a mistake.

5920
02:31:47,990 --> 02:31:48,823
Oh,

5921
02:31:50,270 --> 02:31:51,103
looked for it.

5922
02:31:51,970 --> 02:31:52,930
I don't think that landed though.

5923
02:31:52,931 --> 02:31:53,180
Huh?

5924
02:31:53,180 --> 02:31:54,530
No look cool though.

5925
02:31:54,890 --> 02:31:55,723
And I was onboard.

5926
02:31:57,050 --> 02:31:57,883
I yelled out.

5927
02:31:58,790 --> 02:32:00,050
You gotta get off the cage here.

5928
02:32:00,230 --> 02:32:01,100
You've got to get out.

5929
02:32:03,790 --> 02:32:04,151
Yeah.

5930
02:32:04,151 --> 02:32:05,650
I think for one of where
these first two rounds,

5931
02:32:05,651 --> 02:32:07,030
just try to frustrate till

5932
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:13,430
what time is it in England right now
there's seven hours ahead or they eight

5933
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:18,240
eight so it's fucking eight o'clock it's
really late Thursday at eight o'clock

5934
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:19,500
eight 30 at night.

5935
02:32:20,400 --> 02:32:20,860
I see,

5936
02:32:20,860 --> 02:32:21,330
I see,

5937
02:32:21,330 --> 02:32:21,571
I see.

5938
02:32:21,571 --> 02:32:22,590
I think it's seven 30

5939
02:32:24,150 --> 02:32:24,990
it's eight hours.

5940
02:32:25,590 --> 02:32:26,010
That's it.

5941
02:32:26,010 --> 02:32:26,640
Trust me.

5942
02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:26,821
Yeah.

5943
02:32:26,821 --> 02:32:27,654
You probably know.

5944
02:32:28,590 --> 02:32:30,270
So it's 9:30 PM right now.

5945
02:32:30,990 --> 02:32:31,850
Eight 30 bro.

5946
02:32:32,250 --> 02:32:33,083
What time is it now?

5947
02:32:33,390 --> 02:32:34,700
1230 I looked at my watch can,

5948
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:38,910
unless there's a couple of
different times zones in the UK.

5949
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:41,620
I thought it was just one and I
have daylight savings time or so.

5950
02:32:43,420 --> 02:32:46,290
Nobody should have that shit dead.

5951
02:32:46,390 --> 02:32:47,560
Arizona does it right?

5952
02:32:47,590 --> 02:32:48,160
They do.

5953
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:49,030
They like fine.

5954
02:32:49,110 --> 02:32:49,781
Fuck with it.

5955
02:32:49,781 --> 02:32:51,040
And that our sleep we lose.

5956
02:32:51,041 --> 02:32:52,270
Got Fuck Yourself.

5957
02:32:52,530 --> 02:32:53,500
We got a two year old.

5958
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:54,340
Yeah,

5959
02:32:54,340 --> 02:32:56,170
but how about when you gain that hour all,

5960
02:32:56,220 --> 02:32:57,970
it's nice when you gain
it for like two days.

5961
02:32:58,010 --> 02:32:58,571
Not worth it,

5962
02:32:58,571 --> 02:32:58,930
bro.

5963
02:32:58,930 --> 02:32:59,763
It's not worth it.

5964
02:33:00,060 --> 02:33:01,450
Fuck my test in the morning.

5965
02:33:01,451 --> 02:33:03,460
It's dark in the afternoon.

5966
02:33:03,461 --> 02:33:05,890
It's not your boys too.

5967
02:33:06,880 --> 02:33:07,100
Yeah,

5968
02:33:07,100 --> 02:33:07,933
he's two now.

5969
02:33:08,260 --> 02:33:10,220
Mike six got a man.

5970
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:13,180
He's all into Harry Potter and Shit now.

5971
02:33:13,510 --> 02:33:13,811
That's cool.

5972
02:33:13,811 --> 02:33:14,291
Damn,

5973
02:33:14,291 --> 02:33:14,800
we got it.

5974
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:16,420
We go to universal studios.

5975
02:33:16,421 --> 02:33:17,400
How awkward if you haven't been,

5976
02:33:17,630 --> 02:33:19,270
you haven't been a universal studios.

5977
02:33:20,080 --> 02:33:21,850
You need to go universal studios.

5978
02:33:21,851 --> 02:33:25,230
Fucking brules now the
three d simulations.

5979
02:33:25,231 --> 02:33:25,750
Hell yeah.

5980
02:33:25,750 --> 02:33:28,420
High level that that Harry Potter ride.

5981
02:33:28,780 --> 02:33:30,260
Holy Father,

5982
02:33:30,580 --> 02:33:31,221
the new guards.

5983
02:33:31,221 --> 02:33:31,841
A galaxy.

5984
02:33:31,841 --> 02:33:32,980
It Disney's pretty sick.

5985
02:33:32,981 --> 02:33:33,371
Yeah,

5986
02:33:33,371 --> 02:33:34,570
I was straight up scared.

5987
02:33:35,390 --> 02:33:36,223
I was scared.

5988
02:33:36,460 --> 02:33:38,660
That transformer ride is amazing.

5989
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:39,480
Also,

5990
02:33:39,480 --> 02:33:44,480
the Simpsons rides amazing
land is sick or rides ever.

5991
02:33:45,760 --> 02:33:47,410
You know what's the best ride ever?

5992
02:33:47,530 --> 02:33:48,220
All time.

5993
02:33:48,220 --> 02:33:49,053
Hands down.

5994
02:33:49,540 --> 02:33:50,680
Flights of passage.

5995
02:33:50,740 --> 02:33:53,590
Avatar ride in Disney world in Orlando.

5996
02:33:53,940 --> 02:33:55,490
I went to a simulation.

5997
02:33:55,570 --> 02:33:57,100
It's incredible,

5998
02:33:57,101 --> 02:33:57,490
dude.

5999
02:33:57,490 --> 02:33:58,323
It's incredible.

6000
02:33:58,540 --> 02:33:59,710
It's like virtual reality.

6001
02:33:59,711 --> 02:34:00,201
You go in,

6002
02:34:00,201 --> 02:34:01,120
you sit on this bike,

6003
02:34:01,121 --> 02:34:02,290
you're riding a dragon,

6004
02:34:02,470 --> 02:34:03,191
you saw Avatar,

6005
02:34:03,191 --> 02:34:03,780
right?

6006
02:34:03,780 --> 02:34:05,830
You're riding one of those
things through the fucking junk.

6007
02:34:07,690 --> 02:34:09,400
It is every is think of like,

6008
02:34:09,610 --> 02:34:10,443
have you ever done that?

6009
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:14,470
That there's the thing at Disney
land called soaring over the world.

6010
02:34:14,710 --> 02:34:15,041
Will you,

6011
02:34:15,041 --> 02:34:16,000
it's amazing.

6012
02:34:16,001 --> 02:34:20,410
Giant screen and flying like
over India and over the Everest.

6013
02:34:20,411 --> 02:34:22,010
It's a made sure that's not Disney world.

6014
02:34:22,060 --> 02:34:22,701
They don't know it.

6015
02:34:22,701 --> 02:34:23,260
Just did it.

6016
02:34:23,260 --> 02:34:24,940
Just did it sister.

6017
02:34:25,060 --> 02:34:25,420
Yeah.

6018
02:34:25,420 --> 02:34:26,253
Disney world.

6019
02:34:26,350 --> 02:34:28,570
Disney land has soaring over the world.

6020
02:34:28,870 --> 02:34:29,260
Oh,

6021
02:34:29,260 --> 02:34:29,951
but oh,

6022
02:34:29,951 --> 02:34:30,311
here we go.

6023
02:34:30,311 --> 02:34:31,144
Round to fuck

6024
02:34:33,430 --> 02:34:33,761
around.

6025
02:34:33,761 --> 02:34:34,594
I remember,

6026
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:37,390
Oh till get a little more aggressive.

6027
02:34:37,810 --> 02:34:39,040
Tagged him with that left hand.

6028
02:34:39,880 --> 02:34:41,020
And that castle that,

6029
02:34:41,021 --> 02:34:42,820
that Harry Potter Castle that they build.

6030
02:34:42,821 --> 02:34:43,930
Like what the fuck?

6031
02:34:43,931 --> 02:34:44,764
That's amazing.

6032
02:34:44,840 --> 02:34:45,640
It's incredible.

6033
02:34:45,640 --> 02:34:46,960
Tills getting way more amped up.

6034
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:48,100
Oh Shit.

6035
02:34:48,180 --> 02:34:48,820
Ooh.

6036
02:34:48,820 --> 02:34:50,080
One mistake man.

6037
02:34:50,081 --> 02:34:50,291
I know.

6038
02:34:50,291 --> 02:34:50,641
I wonder,

6039
02:34:50,641 --> 02:34:50,831
boy.

6040
02:34:50,831 --> 02:34:52,720
Such a good counter fighter and all that.

6041
02:34:52,721 --> 02:34:54,050
So he lifts where I'd done the,

6042
02:34:55,330 --> 02:34:57,160
Ooh gotta get off the fucking fence.

6043
02:34:58,300 --> 02:34:59,320
That's all till once.

6044
02:35:02,450 --> 02:35:05,170
So that first round you got
to give it to one or right?

6045
02:35:05,640 --> 02:35:06,560
I mean it's super close,

6046
02:35:06,561 --> 02:35:07,394
but yeah.

6047
02:35:07,550 --> 02:35:07,731
Yeah.

6048
02:35:07,731 --> 02:35:08,564
Give it to Wonderboy.

6049
02:35:08,870 --> 02:35:09,703
Wonderboy,

6050
02:35:09,860 --> 02:35:11,130
not a whole lot going on most.

6051
02:35:11,140 --> 02:35:11,330
I mean,

6052
02:35:11,330 --> 02:35:12,830
he landed like maybe two shots,

6053
02:35:12,831 --> 02:35:14,450
one of the body than that one.

6054
02:35:14,451 --> 02:35:14,921
Two of,

6055
02:35:14,921 --> 02:35:15,741
remember this though.

6056
02:35:15,741 --> 02:35:16,790
They're in Liverpool,

6057
02:35:17,060 --> 02:35:17,630
the home kit.

6058
02:35:17,630 --> 02:35:22,630
He's the hometown kid and the judges look
at a octagon control so that it's not

6059
02:35:22,791 --> 02:35:26,600
necessarily could give to wonder Boone
that that frontline Darren until I don't

6060
02:35:26,601 --> 02:35:27,590
think landed anything,

6061
02:35:27,620 --> 02:35:30,470
but he's going forward
and the judges are morons,

6062
02:35:30,490 --> 02:35:30,891
so like,

6063
02:35:30,891 --> 02:35:31,131
oh,

6064
02:35:31,131 --> 02:35:31,851
going forward.

6065
02:35:31,851 --> 02:35:32,910
That works well.

6066
02:35:32,940 --> 02:35:34,910
Give it to till he did a good job.

6067
02:35:34,911 --> 02:35:38,360
Didn't t they always ask a
question after they say something.

6068
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:40,401
He's amazing.

6069
02:35:40,401 --> 02:35:41,234
Isn't he

6070
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:43,431
fantastic?

6071
02:35:43,431 --> 02:35:44,360
Righthand wasn't it

6072
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:50,020
the slides about to get
loose in the third round.

6073
02:35:50,021 --> 02:35:51,390
I feel like what's getting loose?

6074
02:35:51,400 --> 02:35:53,230
Heredi a little bit.

6075
02:35:53,260 --> 02:35:55,180
It's just such a dangerous chess game.

6076
02:35:55,270 --> 02:35:55,930
I know.

6077
02:35:55,930 --> 02:35:57,160
And Wonderboy hands,

6078
02:35:57,161 --> 02:35:58,900
motherfucking down side.

6079
02:35:58,930 --> 02:35:59,820
He's always like that.

6080
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:00,581
It's like that.

6081
02:36:00,581 --> 02:36:02,080
That's that karate style sign.

6082
02:36:03,710 --> 02:36:04,170
Ooh,

6083
02:36:04,170 --> 02:36:05,800
look for it till slid,

6084
02:36:05,860 --> 02:36:06,760
slid to the right.

6085
02:36:06,910 --> 02:36:07,250
Tilt.

6086
02:36:07,250 --> 02:36:08,560
Elbows are no joke either.

6087
02:36:08,561 --> 02:36:09,730
Now if he gets in close,

6088
02:36:09,731 --> 02:36:11,230
they're the one that he landed on.

6089
02:36:11,231 --> 02:36:12,780
Cowboy was God.

6090
02:36:13,270 --> 02:36:14,290
Who else has he beaten?

6091
02:36:14,830 --> 02:36:15,401
It's about it,

6092
02:36:15,401 --> 02:36:15,850
sir.

6093
02:36:15,850 --> 02:36:16,091
Yeah.

6094
02:36:16,091 --> 02:36:18,430
I'm really in to anybody else.

6095
02:36:18,490 --> 02:36:19,323
He hasn't really,

6096
02:36:19,960 --> 02:36:22,600
he hasn't really knocked you off
your socks before that cowboy fight.

6097
02:36:22,660 --> 02:36:24,100
He's at some decisions.

6098
02:36:25,170 --> 02:36:26,003
The knockout.

6099
02:36:26,020 --> 02:36:28,270
You stop somebody too early on.

6100
02:36:28,271 --> 02:36:28,991
He had one stop.

6101
02:36:28,991 --> 02:36:29,140
It's,

6102
02:36:29,140 --> 02:36:29,740
Oh shit.

6103
02:36:29,740 --> 02:36:30,573
Ooh.

6104
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:31,420
Damn.

6105
02:36:31,420 --> 02:36:31,861
One of the board.

6106
02:36:31,861 --> 02:36:33,850
We left Wonderboy top a very smart man.

6107
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:34,833
Yeah.

6108
02:36:36,010 --> 02:36:36,701
Well this is like,

6109
02:36:36,701 --> 02:36:37,390
again,

6110
02:36:37,390 --> 02:36:42,390
stylistically such a great fight because
this is the style that Wonderboy really

6111
02:36:42,551 --> 02:36:42,881
does.

6112
02:36:42,881 --> 02:36:47,740
Like he likes a guy that's Uber aggressive
and when it turned in terms of like

6113
02:36:47,770 --> 02:36:49,480
high level technique bolt,

6114
02:36:49,481 --> 02:36:50,710
these guys are really good.

6115
02:36:50,860 --> 02:36:51,161
Really,

6116
02:36:51,161 --> 02:36:51,994
really good.

6117
02:36:52,630 --> 02:36:54,130
Don't till till keeps her on that front.

6118
02:36:54,131 --> 02:36:55,160
Like so I kicked the front line.

6119
02:36:55,180 --> 02:36:56,470
Oh No,

6120
02:36:56,490 --> 02:36:57,880
we wanted the little short.

6121
02:36:57,950 --> 02:36:58,450
Yep.

6122
02:36:58,450 --> 02:36:59,283
Ooh.

6123
02:36:59,380 --> 02:37:00,040
Hixon.

6124
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:00,490
Yeah.

6125
02:37:00,490 --> 02:37:02,130
He doesn't like no wonder boy.

6126
02:37:02,131 --> 02:37:03,250
He's going to have to adapt to that.

6127
02:37:03,790 --> 02:37:04,623
Yeah,

6128
02:37:04,750 --> 02:37:05,950
they both switch it up,

6129
02:37:05,951 --> 02:37:06,670
don't they?

6130
02:37:06,670 --> 02:37:07,330
Yup.

6131
02:37:07,330 --> 02:37:07,870
Oh,

6132
02:37:07,870 --> 02:37:08,830
Ooh.

6133
02:37:08,831 --> 02:37:10,750
Just missed that head kick son.

6134
02:37:11,470 --> 02:37:13,810
But miss financial is as good as a mile.

6135
02:37:16,150 --> 02:37:17,740
Tills got great distance control.

6136
02:37:17,770 --> 02:37:18,590
They both do.

6137
02:37:18,590 --> 02:37:19,423
They both do.

6138
02:37:20,140 --> 02:37:20,760
They both do.

6139
02:37:20,760 --> 02:37:21,593
Dante,

6140
02:37:21,660 --> 02:37:22,260
don't they?

6141
02:37:22,260 --> 02:37:22,810
Don't they?

6142
02:37:22,810 --> 02:37:23,441
That's Irish,

6143
02:37:23,441 --> 02:37:23,980
isn't it?

6144
02:37:23,980 --> 02:37:24,611
I don't know.

6145
02:37:24,611 --> 02:37:25,960
My accent suck.

6146
02:37:27,010 --> 02:37:28,540
We need a high natto in here.

6147
02:37:29,060 --> 02:37:30,490
I have some scouts for us.

6148
02:37:31,540 --> 02:37:32,390
Amazing Kid.

6149
02:37:32,391 --> 02:37:35,650
Definitely a different
accent to at the thick man.

6150
02:37:35,980 --> 02:37:36,520
Yeah.

6151
02:37:36,520 --> 02:37:37,210
Sunderland,

6152
02:37:37,210 --> 02:37:40,600
Liverpool thick as Liverpool
I think is Ozzy Osborne.

6153
02:37:42,500 --> 02:37:43,040
Oh,

6154
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:43,910
Russian in man.

6155
02:37:43,930 --> 02:37:45,320
Why did boy loves to do that?

6156
02:37:45,321 --> 02:37:47,060
Like Swish slit splits.

6157
02:37:47,090 --> 02:37:47,923
Yeah,

6158
02:37:48,830 --> 02:37:49,131
but it's,

6159
02:37:49,131 --> 02:37:49,964
it's so,

6160
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:53,970
so hard to figure out what the fuck he's
going to do because he switches stance

6161
02:37:53,971 --> 02:37:54,321
as well.

6162
02:37:54,321 --> 02:37:56,390
He does it sometimes and
then we'll throw a kick.

6163
02:37:56,510 --> 02:37:57,130
Yeah,

6164
02:37:57,130 --> 02:37:57,280
he's,

6165
02:37:57,280 --> 02:37:58,550
he's about to rush in again.

6166
02:37:59,150 --> 02:38:01,070
Tills just trying to figure
out and pin him down.

6167
02:38:01,071 --> 02:38:01,401
But man,

6168
02:38:01,401 --> 02:38:02,234
it's not there.

6169
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:05,860
I wonder how this is this
one of boy's game plan.

6170
02:38:05,861 --> 02:38:06,694
Man Kimmy,

6171
02:38:06,740 --> 02:38:07,910
commit and make a mistake.

6172
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:08,051
They,

6173
02:38:08,051 --> 02:38:11,480
she capitalized but tills doing a good
job of not giving them much space where

6174
02:38:11,481 --> 02:38:12,230
the cages,

6175
02:38:12,230 --> 02:38:14,990
this is not happening in the center
of the cage as much as it's Ha.

6176
02:38:15,020 --> 02:38:16,430
Ooh,

6177
02:38:16,970 --> 02:38:19,240
Wonderboy try that sweat and
chills going to feel any pressure.

6178
02:38:19,260 --> 02:38:23,450
Get a finish cause till is absolutely
controlling the center of the cage.

6179
02:38:23,510 --> 02:38:24,890
They under boy did not have a lot.

6180
02:38:24,891 --> 02:38:26,330
Well now they're in the center and you,

6181
02:38:26,331 --> 02:38:28,550
you know that wins
rounds for these judges.

6182
02:38:28,700 --> 02:38:29,533
Yeah.

6183
02:38:31,650 --> 02:38:33,000
Cause they don't understand fighting.

6184
02:38:35,720 --> 02:38:36,553
Okay.

6185
02:38:36,970 --> 02:38:38,380
That place is packed too,

6186
02:38:38,381 --> 02:38:38,770
man.

6187
02:38:38,770 --> 02:38:38,951
Oh,

6188
02:38:38,951 --> 02:38:40,060
I'm sure they say,

6189
02:38:40,210 --> 02:38:40,451
you know,

6190
02:38:40,451 --> 02:38:42,280
he's a superstar superstar.

6191
02:38:44,150 --> 02:38:46,960
It'd be the face of the of uh,

6192
02:38:47,020 --> 02:38:47,853
England man.

6193
02:38:49,390 --> 02:38:50,320
Big knockout here.

6194
02:38:50,321 --> 02:38:52,210
It'd be the fee cause Bisbing he is,

6195
02:38:52,270 --> 02:38:53,470
but he's retired.

6196
02:38:54,280 --> 02:38:54,431
Yeah.

6197
02:38:54,431 --> 02:38:55,630
Who else is coming up in England?

6198
02:38:56,770 --> 02:38:57,431

6199
02:38:57,431 --> 02:38:57,990

6200
02:38:57,990 --> 02:38:58,390

6203
02:39:00,160 --> 02:39:00,971
Sure.

6204
02:39:00,971 --> 02:39:01,361
Yeah,

6205
02:39:01,361 --> 02:39:02,140
but he's not,

6206
02:39:02,140 --> 02:39:03,190
he's not in this level.

6207
02:39:03,340 --> 02:39:04,060
Um,

6208
02:39:04,060 --> 02:39:06,300
well why don't they give
him high level fights?

6209
02:39:06,310 --> 02:39:07,720
He just had fought a Rickles.

6210
02:39:07,730 --> 02:39:08,110
Yeah.

6211
02:39:08,110 --> 02:39:09,250
Do you see what he did to him?

6212
02:39:09,310 --> 02:39:09,670
No.

6213
02:39:09,670 --> 02:39:10,390
Fucked him up.

6214
02:39:10,390 --> 02:39:13,000
I heard he exploded his
face and choked them out.

6215
02:39:13,170 --> 02:39:13,360
Yeah.

6216
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:14,200
And that was like his first,

6217
02:39:14,201 --> 02:39:15,910

6218
02:39:15,911 --> 02:39:16,151

I really like page daily cause
they don't like each other.

6230
02:39:29,620 --> 02:39:30,850
They fucking hate each other.

6231
02:39:30,851 --> 02:39:31,631
I liked that fight.

6232
02:39:31,631 --> 02:39:34,990
I'll watt shout out to all the

02:39:45,341 --> 02:39:46,180
Am I missing one?

6241
02:39:46,270 --> 02:39:46,451
Oh,

6242
02:39:46,451 --> 02:39:47,190
glass gal.

02:39:47,190 --> 02:39:48,400
That's Scotland.

6244
02:39:48,550 --> 02:39:49,383
Scotland.

That's amazing.

6248
02:39:53,590 --> 02:39:54,041
That's crazy.

6249
02:39:54,041 --> 02:39:54,970
Amazing Ooze.

6250
02:39:56,500 --> 02:39:57,370

6251
02:39:57,371 --> 02:39:57,870

6252
02:39:57,870 --> 02:39:58,703
It keeps growing.

6253
02:39:59,470 --> 02:40:00,890
He hit him with that

6254
02:40:00,891 --> 02:40:01,900

Bucko see that in the replay?

6256
02:40:03,940 --> 02:40:04,810
He didn't like that.

6257
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:05,920
He hit him with three straight.

6258
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:08,420
One of them really made his knee buckle.

6259
02:40:08,421 --> 02:40:08,770
Ma'Am.

6264
02:40:17,830 --> 02:40:18,663
Oh Shit.

6265
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:20,673
Damn.

6266
02:40:21,320 --> 02:40:21,710
Oh,

6267
02:40:21,710 --> 02:40:22,790
he's so fast.

6268
02:40:23,070 --> 02:40:24,440
That's again karate.

6269
02:40:24,441 --> 02:40:26,180
He comes from that point
fighting background.

6270
02:40:26,360 --> 02:40:26,541
You know,

6271
02:40:26,541 --> 02:40:28,430
there's a great karate
match that I watched.

6272
02:40:28,431 --> 02:40:29,030
I mean,

6273
02:40:29,030 --> 02:40:30,230
I don't know how many times they fought,

6274
02:40:30,231 --> 02:40:31,280
but on,

6275
02:40:31,281 --> 02:40:32,114
um,

6276
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:32,540
uh,

6277
02:40:32,540 --> 02:40:34,970
they fought point fighting
way back in the day.

6278
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:35,833
Um,

6279
02:40:35,990 --> 02:40:39,680
Raymond Daniels and Michael Denham page
fought each other and point fighting.

6280
02:40:40,100 --> 02:40:44,000
Now Raymond Daniels is the glory champion
and Michael Van and page is coming up

6281
02:40:44,001 --> 02:40:44,834
in Beltour.

6282
02:40:45,380 --> 02:40:46,213
Very interesting.

6283
02:40:46,820 --> 02:40:46,891
Oh,

6284
02:40:46,891 --> 02:40:48,170
he's a belt or champion now.

6285
02:40:48,350 --> 02:40:48,981
Raymond Daniels,

6286
02:40:48,981 --> 02:40:49,460
right?

6287
02:40:49,460 --> 02:40:50,293
He left glory.

6288
02:40:51,270 --> 02:40:53,870
[inaudible] here we go.

6289
02:40:56,380 --> 02:40:57,213
Here we go.

6290
02:41:03,490 --> 02:41:04,323
Here we go.

6291
02:41:08,480 --> 02:41:10,100
Darren till super aggressive here.

6292
02:41:10,101 --> 02:41:10,934
Now,

6293
02:41:11,150 --> 02:41:12,610
I wonder if a Wonderboy,

6294
02:41:12,620 --> 02:41:13,610
his knee is okay

6295
02:41:16,540 --> 02:41:17,101
because those,

6296
02:41:17,101 --> 02:41:17,934
uh,

6297
02:41:18,060 --> 02:41:21,270
he still hasn't landed anything now
except for those sidekicks to the knee.

6298
02:41:21,800 --> 02:41:22,320
Here's the land.

6299
02:41:22,320 --> 02:41:23,100
Anything to the head.

6300
02:41:23,100 --> 02:41:23,610
Nothing.

6301
02:41:23,610 --> 02:41:24,960
Wonder boys knee seems fine.

6302
02:41:24,961 --> 02:41:27,740
He's moving fine tooth around so far.

6303
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:29,370
No shot to the head.

6304
02:41:29,460 --> 02:41:30,293
Yeah.

6305
02:41:30,360 --> 02:41:30,870
Ooh,

6306
02:41:30,870 --> 02:41:31,703
kick to the body.

6307
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:38,670
Well,

6308
02:41:38,670 --> 02:41:40,950
the whole thing with Wonderboy is just,

6309
02:41:41,550 --> 02:41:46,350
you make a mistake and he counters you
and so far till hasn't really made any

6310
02:41:46,351 --> 02:41:48,510
mistakes but wonder boys
found a few openings,

6311
02:41:48,660 --> 02:41:53,030
but there's never been like one big bum
rush where he'd left a gap and Wonderboy

6312
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:54,150
could drop a ball on him.

6313
02:41:56,550 --> 02:41:57,600
Did I miss anything?

6314
02:41:57,660 --> 02:41:57,961
Nope.

6315
02:41:57,961 --> 02:41:58,650
Nothing.

6316
02:41:58,650 --> 02:42:00,000
But they did show the replay.

6317
02:42:00,160 --> 02:42:01,880
The knee buckling a Wonderboy.

6318
02:42:01,900 --> 02:42:02,621
It look pretty now.

6319
02:42:02,621 --> 02:42:02,911
Yeah.

6320
02:42:02,911 --> 02:42:03,744
From what?

6321
02:42:03,750 --> 02:42:04,740
From that sidekick.

6322
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:05,753
Oh Wow.

6323
02:42:05,850 --> 02:42:06,760
From a side kick front.

6324
02:42:06,761 --> 02:42:07,594
Like psyche through me.

6325
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:08,790
But he's moving fine.

6326
02:42:08,820 --> 02:42:11,220
It doesn't seem like
he's a limping at all.

6327
02:42:11,700 --> 02:42:13,620
And he threw some kicks
with that left leg.

6328
02:42:13,910 --> 02:42:15,510
So you would be nice at one one.

6329
02:42:16,830 --> 02:42:17,461
It's hard to tell.

6330
02:42:17,461 --> 02:42:18,294
It's hard.

6331
02:42:18,470 --> 02:42:20,520
Wonderboy was a little
more aggressive though.

6332
02:42:20,580 --> 02:42:20,941
Yeah.

6333
02:42:20,941 --> 02:42:23,700
I wouldn't be getting
knocked out cataract out.

6334
02:42:24,360 --> 02:42:27,240
Same thing with the Woodley five who
was like go be more graph like and get

6335
02:42:27,241 --> 02:42:29,010
fucking starched by Woodley

6336
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:33,140
still.

6337
02:42:33,140 --> 02:42:33,973
You got to,

6338
02:42:34,230 --> 02:42:35,610
well this is his style man.

6339
02:42:35,611 --> 02:42:36,660
This is his style.

6340
02:42:36,990 --> 02:42:38,250
His style is move around.

6341
02:42:38,251 --> 02:42:43,251
But the thing is until is so high level
as well that it's hard for this style to

6342
02:42:43,351 --> 02:42:45,060
even find its home.

6343
02:42:45,090 --> 02:42:46,260
You know you have an aggressive,

6344
02:42:46,261 --> 02:42:47,550
which counter striker this is,

6345
02:42:47,551 --> 02:42:48,600
I don't know what people expect.

6346
02:42:48,610 --> 02:42:48,900
Really.

6347
02:42:48,900 --> 02:42:49,733
Machida.

6348
02:42:49,830 --> 02:42:50,663
Yeah.

6349
02:42:51,780 --> 02:42:52,261
How about that?

6350
02:42:52,261 --> 02:42:55,230
My cheat at front kick
to vittores fell Cheetah.

6351
02:42:55,231 --> 02:42:56,730
How fucking dare you know.

6352
02:42:56,760 --> 02:42:57,150
Ooh.

6353
02:42:57,150 --> 02:42:58,460
The man's sign up fighting went,

6354
02:42:58,470 --> 02:42:59,303
you know what?

6355
02:42:59,580 --> 02:43:00,630
Enjoy the retirement.

6356
02:43:00,920 --> 02:43:02,700
He goes crazy.

6357
02:43:02,701 --> 02:43:03,150
Right?

6358
02:43:03,150 --> 02:43:03,510
That was the one,

6359
02:43:03,510 --> 02:43:05,940
the worst knockouts effort
and it just walks off.

6360
02:43:05,980 --> 02:43:06,840
Fucking nasty.

6361
02:43:06,860 --> 02:43:10,830
Starts praying and you see the
photo of the foot on the face?

6362
02:43:10,990 --> 02:43:11,620
Yes.

6363
02:43:11,620 --> 02:43:13,750
Text book front kick balls.

6364
02:43:13,800 --> 02:43:15,160
The balls of the feet.

6365
02:43:15,280 --> 02:43:16,510
You think feature goes to ride.

6366
02:43:16,660 --> 02:43:18,940
Just juices with every
Brazilian drug ever.

6367
02:43:19,150 --> 02:43:19,241
Uh,

6368
02:43:19,241 --> 02:43:19,570
my,

6369
02:43:19,570 --> 02:43:21,070
my heart hope so too.

6370
02:43:21,070 --> 02:43:22,120
I pray for that at night.

6371
02:43:22,210 --> 02:43:23,380
I pray for Golden,

6372
02:43:23,440 --> 02:43:25,210
like Masters Division.

6373
02:43:25,230 --> 02:43:25,511
Yeah.

6374
02:43:25,511 --> 02:43:28,150
Just go off and want to see
veins in his teeth against,

6375
02:43:28,330 --> 02:43:31,660
it's crazy that he's still
fighting Jesus Christ.

6376
02:43:32,900 --> 02:43:33,250
Dude.

6377
02:43:33,250 --> 02:43:34,900
He was around in the early days.

6378
02:43:35,250 --> 02:43:37,530
Is the only guy from the
early days still fine.

6379
02:43:37,540 --> 02:43:38,620
Oh yeah.

6380
02:43:38,860 --> 02:43:40,300
Wonderboy caught them
with that right hand,

6381
02:43:40,301 --> 02:43:40,401
man.

6382
02:43:40,401 --> 02:43:42,040
You could say the same
thing for Dan Henderson,

6383
02:43:42,041 --> 02:43:43,930
but he's officially
retired and he's retired.

6384
02:43:44,110 --> 02:43:44,980
But Wonderboy,

6385
02:43:45,010 --> 02:43:48,520
I mean [inaudible] was around a UFC 12.

6386
02:43:48,970 --> 02:43:49,721
That's crazy.

6387
02:43:49,721 --> 02:43:54,370
Henderson was around 98 so it
wasn't much longer afterwards.

6388
02:43:55,030 --> 02:43:55,863
You know.

6389
02:43:56,680 --> 02:43:57,161
Crazy.

6390
02:43:57,161 --> 02:43:57,994
Really.

6391
02:43:58,240 --> 02:43:58,781
They fought,

6392
02:43:58,781 --> 02:43:58,991
right?

6393
02:43:58,991 --> 02:43:59,824
Dan Anderson.

6394
02:43:59,850 --> 02:44:02,530
[inaudible] K Odum both times.

6395
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:03,393
Yup.

6396
02:44:04,570 --> 02:44:05,280
Oh,

6397
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:05,441
oh,

6398
02:44:05,441 --> 02:44:08,520
we caught all right and see till
starting to get anxious here.

6399
02:44:08,550 --> 02:44:09,630
This one's gonna get in trouble,

6400
02:44:09,631 --> 02:44:10,464
man.

6401
02:44:13,190 --> 02:44:14,340
Ooh,

6402
02:44:14,590 --> 02:44:15,423
well he's looking for wonder.

6403
02:44:15,430 --> 02:44:16,263
Boy gets big.

6404
02:44:16,530 --> 02:44:17,480
Juicy his legs,

6405
02:44:17,481 --> 02:44:17,661
man.

6406
02:44:17,661 --> 02:44:19,230
I mean his hands are dangerous,

6407
02:44:19,231 --> 02:44:20,870
but his powers in those fucking legs.

6408
02:44:20,900 --> 02:44:21,950
Oh Shit.

6409
02:44:21,980 --> 02:44:23,370
He's found that head kick a few times.

6410
02:44:23,371 --> 02:44:26,390
It was a sick slip by till who?

6411
02:44:26,391 --> 02:44:27,620
Just till train with,

6412
02:44:28,310 --> 02:44:31,880
I don't know much about his
to come bone and Liverpool.

6413
02:44:33,770 --> 02:44:34,280
Uh,

6414
02:44:34,280 --> 02:44:35,570
his coaches calling,

6415
02:44:35,580 --> 02:44:36,530
I forget his last name.

6416
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:39,061
It's crazy.

6417
02:44:39,061 --> 02:44:40,830
One or boy's dad cranes him,

6418
02:44:40,831 --> 02:44:41,160
right?

6419
02:44:41,160 --> 02:44:41,640
Yeah.

6420
02:44:41,640 --> 02:44:42,720
It'd be tough dynamic.

6421
02:44:42,800 --> 02:44:43,080
Ooh.

6422
02:44:43,080 --> 02:44:43,480
Damn.

6423
02:44:43,480 --> 02:44:45,090
Number one now.

6424
02:44:45,360 --> 02:44:46,193
Just touched them,

6425
02:44:46,410 --> 02:44:47,730
but he didn't touch him at the very end.

6426
02:44:47,731 --> 02:44:49,400
With that a round kick to the face,

6427
02:44:49,401 --> 02:44:50,051
you might be fine.

6428
02:44:50,051 --> 02:44:54,030
And an opening for that one to blitz
out till just tagged them with that job.

6429
02:44:56,940 --> 02:44:58,400
Have a hard time
believing in these judges.

6430
02:44:58,450 --> 02:44:58,971
I don't have it.

6431
02:44:58,971 --> 02:44:59,810
Three nothing.

6432
02:45:00,170 --> 02:45:01,003
Right,

6433
02:45:01,010 --> 02:45:01,400
right.

6434
02:45:01,400 --> 02:45:03,770
In Liverpool dock to gun control.

6435
02:45:03,870 --> 02:45:04,703
Well,

6436
02:45:04,940 --> 02:45:05,840
judges are two,

6437
02:45:05,841 --> 02:45:06,051
right?

6438
02:45:06,051 --> 02:45:08,960
Or the American judges and the
English judges are all morons though,

6439
02:45:08,970 --> 02:45:11,120
aren't they all around the world?

6440
02:45:11,390 --> 02:45:12,290
Unfortunately.

6441
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:16,130
I love the fact that you could say
that you don't work for anybody.

6442
02:45:16,190 --> 02:45:16,521
I know.

6443
02:45:16,521 --> 02:45:17,121
Isn't it cool?

6444
02:45:17,121 --> 02:45:18,020
And you can,

6445
02:45:21,510 --> 02:45:23,470
oh no till got poked in the eye.

6446
02:45:23,490 --> 02:45:24,530
Get the fuck Outta here.

6447
02:45:30,260 --> 02:45:34,430
Mark gutters more worried about
an eye poked anybody that boy,

6448
02:45:34,431 --> 02:45:35,810
that doctor got in that room quick.

6449
02:45:36,320 --> 02:45:37,490
The doctor just jumped in.

6450
02:45:37,820 --> 02:45:38,241
God,

6451
02:45:38,241 --> 02:45:39,200
where did he come from?

6452
02:45:39,470 --> 02:45:40,303
And now he's out.

6453
02:45:40,820 --> 02:45:42,560
He's trying to get a
little too much TV time.

6454
02:45:44,760 --> 02:45:45,180
Oh yeah.

6455
02:45:45,180 --> 02:45:45,911
Oh definitely.

6456
02:45:45,911 --> 02:45:47,840
And Marina mean to poker.

6457
02:45:47,850 --> 02:45:48,840
Reno.

6458
02:45:51,660 --> 02:45:51,841
Oh,

6459
02:45:51,841 --> 02:45:52,561
they were booing him.

6460
02:45:52,561 --> 02:45:52,711
Yeah.

6461
02:45:52,711 --> 02:45:53,161
He's saying no,

6462
02:45:53,161 --> 02:45:53,311
no.

6463
02:45:53,311 --> 02:45:54,144
Boom.

6464
02:45:56,380 --> 02:45:56,831
Oh Shit.

6465
02:45:56,831 --> 02:45:58,060
Sometimes I poked really Rev.

6466
02:45:58,061 --> 02:45:59,680
A dude up or a Dick kick.

6467
02:46:01,450 --> 02:46:01,661
Oh,

6468
02:46:01,661 --> 02:46:03,910
my dad tells get wild here.

6469
02:46:04,310 --> 02:46:04,661
You know.

6470
02:46:04,661 --> 02:46:05,800
Don't get too comfortable.

6471
02:46:05,830 --> 02:46:06,221
Okay.

6472
02:46:06,221 --> 02:46:06,621
There you go.

6473
02:46:06,621 --> 02:46:07,810
On over the top.

6474
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:09,113
Oh Shit.

6475
02:46:09,190 --> 02:46:10,023
Oh.

6476
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:11,151
Oh.

6477
02:46:11,151 --> 02:46:12,170
He's getting crazy here

6478
02:46:14,460 --> 02:46:15,293
dude.

6479
02:46:15,580 --> 02:46:16,241
That I poke.

6480
02:46:16,241 --> 02:46:17,074
Really poke.

6481
02:46:17,080 --> 02:46:19,300
I wish you would have poked nine in
the first round or the round here.

6482
02:46:20,470 --> 02:46:20,730
Now.

6483
02:46:20,730 --> 02:46:21,640
I was trying to get loose.

6484
02:46:21,660 --> 02:46:22,500
Now it's about to get fun.

6485
02:46:22,630 --> 02:46:23,463
That was three,

6486
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:24,790
so we've got two more to go.

6487
02:46:25,570 --> 02:46:26,980
Thank God this is a five rounder,

6488
02:46:26,990 --> 02:46:27,823
right?

6489
02:46:28,650 --> 02:46:29,340
Pissed.

6490
02:46:29,340 --> 02:46:29,530
Yeah,

6491
02:46:29,530 --> 02:46:30,363
it feels so.

6492
02:46:31,090 --> 02:46:33,100
I talk so much shit on
that fight is three rounds.

6493
02:46:33,101 --> 02:46:33,934
It ended there.

6494
02:46:34,030 --> 02:46:34,863
Yeah,

6495
02:46:36,720 --> 02:46:37,553
man.

6496
02:46:37,580 --> 02:46:38,150
Yes.

6497
02:46:38,150 --> 02:46:43,150
That dude has a prominent forehead
cheek bone situation going on.

6498
02:46:43,990 --> 02:46:44,910
I think gang is kind.

6499
02:46:44,920 --> 02:46:45,830
Got a little bit of that.

6500
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:47,520
A little bit of,

6501
02:46:47,690 --> 02:46:50,160
it's definitely got some
fucking ancient man and I'm a,

6502
02:46:50,170 --> 02:46:51,003
he does.

6503
02:46:51,050 --> 02:46:52,010
I don't look like him.

6504
02:46:52,070 --> 02:46:53,180
He definitely boom.

6505
02:46:53,181 --> 02:46:54,014
That right hand.

6506
02:46:54,260 --> 02:46:55,340
That was the nice the counter.

6507
02:46:55,341 --> 02:46:56,174
I'm here.

6508
02:46:56,830 --> 02:46:57,663
Yeah.

6509
02:46:58,500 --> 02:46:59,210
Boom,

6510
02:46:59,210 --> 02:46:59,760
boom.

6511
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:00,620
Oh that got him.

6512
02:47:00,810 --> 02:47:01,340
It did.

6513
02:47:01,340 --> 02:47:01,661
Definitely.

6514
02:47:01,661 --> 02:47:02,540
He slipped with it.

6515
02:47:02,690 --> 02:47:02,841
Yeah.

6516
02:47:02,841 --> 02:47:03,421
He went with it.

6517
02:47:03,421 --> 02:47:05,120
But it caught him at
the end of it for sure.

6518
02:47:05,180 --> 02:47:05,751
Look what I done.

6519
02:47:05,751 --> 02:47:06,584
I'm like tired.

6520
02:47:08,970 --> 02:47:09,990
This is his style.

6521
02:47:09,991 --> 02:47:10,160
You know,

6522
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:11,580
he's so efficient at doing that.

6523
02:47:11,640 --> 02:47:11,791
Oh,

6524
02:47:11,791 --> 02:47:13,890
both these guys can do this for 10 rounds.

6525
02:47:14,430 --> 02:47:15,030
Yeah.

6526
02:47:15,030 --> 02:47:15,670
Round Four.

6527
02:47:15,670 --> 02:47:16,503
Here we go.

6528
02:47:17,480 --> 02:47:17,780
God,

6529
02:47:17,780 --> 02:47:18,090
it's,

6530
02:47:18,090 --> 02:47:19,080
this is a fight.

6531
02:47:19,081 --> 02:47:23,560
That is a great argument for the five
round fight for high level folks.

6532
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:30,630
Maybe we would feel so bad if we were
leaving here and then like who won?

6533
02:47:30,631 --> 02:47:32,490
Who cares what even happened?

6534
02:47:33,090 --> 02:47:33,461
Like what,

6535
02:47:33,461 --> 02:47:34,680
what are the stats on?

6536
02:47:35,090 --> 02:47:35,641
Oh Dude.

6537
02:47:35,641 --> 02:47:37,200
Unless trenches and kicks landed.

6538
02:47:37,230 --> 02:47:37,471
Yeah.

6539
02:47:37,471 --> 02:47:40,750
Unless you're super and
you'd be so wonderful.

6540
02:47:40,751 --> 02:47:41,640
It was a hard jab.

6541
02:47:41,641 --> 02:47:41,821
Right.

6542
02:47:41,821 --> 02:47:42,654
Their kid,

6543
02:47:43,670 --> 02:47:44,311
they tilt better.

6544
02:47:44,311 --> 02:47:45,660
Watch his p's and q's though.

6545
02:47:45,661 --> 02:47:46,710
You are too hard man.

6546
02:47:46,770 --> 02:47:47,603
Yup.

6547
02:47:49,410 --> 02:47:50,243
But

6548
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:52,920
juice is worth the squeeze
if can get it knocked down.

6549
02:47:56,270 --> 02:47:57,103
Okay.

6550
02:47:57,720 --> 02:47:58,553
Oh Shit.

6551
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:00,593
Damn.

6552
02:48:01,830 --> 02:48:02,760
This is getting hot.

6553
02:48:10,350 --> 02:48:10,531
Yeah.

6554
02:48:10,531 --> 02:48:10,921
Cause Yeah.

6555
02:48:10,921 --> 02:48:12,820
Daren tills never been five rounds as he,

6556
02:48:13,310 --> 02:48:13,950
no,

6557
02:48:13,950 --> 02:48:14,850
I don't think so.

6558
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:16,020
He hasn't switched in the EOC.

6559
02:48:16,021 --> 02:48:20,570
This first made it well first times
because his main event against cowboy Jase

6560
02:48:20,580 --> 02:48:21,530
starts cowboy [inaudible].

6561
02:48:24,830 --> 02:48:24,980
Yeah,

6562
02:48:24,980 --> 02:48:26,210
that's his first main event.

6563
02:48:26,211 --> 02:48:27,044
Right.

6564
02:48:27,140 --> 02:48:28,760
And what about outside of the UFC?

6565
02:48:30,500 --> 02:48:32,070
How many fights he had?

6566
02:48:32,280 --> 02:48:37,280
What 17 or a 14 on crazy
speaks perfect Portuguese.

6567
02:48:37,340 --> 02:48:37,461
Oh,

6568
02:48:37,461 --> 02:48:37,791
does he?

6569
02:48:37,791 --> 02:48:38,480
I didn't know that.

6570
02:48:38,480 --> 02:48:39,313
Oh yeah man,

6571
02:48:39,380 --> 02:48:40,780
when he fucked Darren till a damn,

6572
02:48:40,790 --> 02:48:41,630
this kid's marketable.

6573
02:48:41,750 --> 02:48:42,860
When he fought in Brazil,

6574
02:48:42,890 --> 02:48:43,121
uh,

6575
02:48:43,121 --> 02:48:44,960
he spoke Portuguese to the crowd.

6576
02:48:44,990 --> 02:48:46,100
He lived there for like 10 years.

6577
02:48:46,101 --> 02:48:46,281
Right?

6578
02:48:46,281 --> 02:48:46,641
Yeah.

6579
02:48:46,641 --> 02:48:47,480
I watched one of his,

6580
02:48:47,481 --> 02:48:47,630
uh,

6581
02:48:47,630 --> 02:48:51,020
older fights when we stop this guy and he,

6582
02:48:51,021 --> 02:48:51,590
uh,

6583
02:48:51,590 --> 02:48:53,480
spoke Portuguese to the
crowd after the fire,

6584
02:48:53,650 --> 02:48:56,510
the guy up 10 fights were there.

6585
02:48:56,870 --> 02:48:57,703
Wow.

6586
02:48:57,820 --> 02:48:57,950
Yeah,

6587
02:48:57,950 --> 02:48:58,491
he went down there.

6588
02:48:58,491 --> 02:48:59,660
It just went to live down there.

6589
02:48:59,661 --> 02:49:02,240
They had to get out of Liverpool cause
I guess there's little talks it for him.

6590
02:49:03,210 --> 02:49:03,350
Well,

6591
02:49:03,350 --> 02:49:04,183
he got stabbed.

6592
02:49:04,520 --> 02:49:04,681
Yeah,

6593
02:49:04,681 --> 02:49:05,120
I guess that,

6594
02:49:05,120 --> 02:49:05,231
yeah,

6595
02:49:05,231 --> 02:49:06,260
you can see the stem mark.

6596
02:49:06,680 --> 02:49:09,530
Where is it a lower like on his,

6597
02:49:09,531 --> 02:49:09,691
uh,

6598
02:49:09,691 --> 02:49:10,524
it'd be on his rights.

6599
02:49:10,530 --> 02:49:11,580
He got to Dab in Brazil,

6600
02:49:11,610 --> 02:49:13,350
but right above his hip in England,

6601
02:49:14,070 --> 02:49:14,641
in Liverpool,

6602
02:49:14,641 --> 02:49:15,474
in his hometown.

6603
02:49:15,690 --> 02:49:16,231
And his coach,

6604
02:49:16,231 --> 02:49:16,951
his coach told him,

6605
02:49:16,951 --> 02:49:17,071
Hey,

6606
02:49:17,071 --> 02:49:18,000
you gotta get Outta here man.

6607
02:49:18,001 --> 02:49:21,660
If you want to continue to have their
knives and the UK and often off,

6608
02:49:23,010 --> 02:49:26,100
how many more people
got to get stuff that's,

6609
02:49:26,101 --> 02:49:26,311
you know,

6610
02:49:26,311 --> 02:49:30,060
the London mayor actually said that
if you get caught with a knife,

6611
02:49:30,360 --> 02:49:32,910
it'd be prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law.

6612
02:49:33,450 --> 02:49:34,950
What about if I got to open boxes?

6613
02:49:36,680 --> 02:49:37,513
Princesses,

6614
02:49:37,740 --> 02:49:40,740
brother in law or brother got caught
with one when he went over there for the

6615
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:41,730
royal wedding last week.

6616
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:42,151
Oh,

6617
02:49:42,151 --> 02:49:45,330
that would be nice that he took one
because Trump's said that you should take

6618
02:49:45,331 --> 02:49:46,710
one with him and he was in a bar.

6619
02:49:47,170 --> 02:49:47,390
Oh,

6620
02:49:47,390 --> 02:49:48,223
he's crazy.

6621
02:49:48,450 --> 02:49:50,070
Is he crazy or brother's crazy?

6622
02:49:50,190 --> 02:49:51,080
She's a dime piece,

6623
02:49:51,090 --> 02:49:51,740
man.

6624
02:49:51,740 --> 02:49:52,573
Okay.

6625
02:49:54,990 --> 02:49:55,950
I'm assuming you to Deb.

6626
02:49:55,951 --> 02:49:56,281
Nothing.

6627
02:49:56,281 --> 02:49:56,461
No,

6628
02:49:56,461 --> 02:49:57,790
I didn't get the fuck down.

6629
02:49:57,840 --> 02:49:58,311
I'm watching it.

6630
02:49:58,311 --> 02:49:58,711
It's fine.

6631
02:49:58,711 --> 02:49:59,544
Your son,

6632
02:50:00,060 --> 02:50:02,280
one boy with a step in Jab.

6633
02:50:05,560 --> 02:50:07,110
Not a lot of action that's fighting.

6634
02:50:07,180 --> 02:50:08,410
Oh,

6635
02:50:08,510 --> 02:50:11,530
Wonderboy looking for that left
hand over the top because it land.

6636
02:50:11,620 --> 02:50:12,160
Nope.

6637
02:50:12,160 --> 02:50:13,210
Just kind of grazed him.

6638
02:50:13,960 --> 02:50:15,790
It's kind of hard to
tell his back was to us.

6639
02:50:16,020 --> 02:50:17,980
It's going to be a tough
fucking fight to judge,

6640
02:50:17,981 --> 02:50:18,814
man.

6641
02:50:21,660 --> 02:50:22,870
Tell us having a hard time hitting him,

6642
02:50:22,871 --> 02:50:23,950
that's for damn sure.

6643
02:50:24,220 --> 02:50:24,911
Beautiful Dark.

6644
02:50:24,911 --> 02:50:25,211
Under that,

6645
02:50:25,211 --> 02:50:26,800
we get this tail with a clinch.

6646
02:50:27,240 --> 02:50:29,790
What if he takes him down to,

6647
02:50:29,860 --> 02:50:30,940
we just stop the fight.

6648
02:50:31,030 --> 02:50:31,530
Interestingly,

6649
02:50:31,530 --> 02:50:31,931
the tills,

6650
02:50:31,931 --> 02:50:33,070
the one holding onto him here.

6651
02:50:33,130 --> 02:50:33,963
Oh elbow.

6652
02:50:34,220 --> 02:50:35,590
That clenches more ties.

6653
02:50:35,591 --> 02:50:36,424
Nasty.

6654
02:50:39,230 --> 02:50:40,520
Good elbow on the break there.

6655
02:50:42,230 --> 02:50:44,180
If you're one of my say
exactly what he wanted.

6656
02:50:44,660 --> 02:50:46,540
That lace kind of fucked up that lead leg.

6657
02:50:46,580 --> 02:50:47,413
Right leg.

6658
02:50:47,420 --> 02:50:47,780
Yup.

6659
02:50:47,780 --> 02:50:49,010
It does look a little bruised.

6660
02:50:49,190 --> 02:50:49,820
Oh Oo.

6661
02:50:49,820 --> 02:50:50,690
Good kick to the body.

6662
02:50:50,700 --> 02:50:51,440
Oh yeah.

6663
02:50:51,440 --> 02:50:53,480
You guys watched that show Cobra Kai?

6664
02:50:53,960 --> 02:50:54,171
No,

6665
02:50:54,171 --> 02:50:55,004
I haven't seen.

6666
02:50:55,150 --> 02:50:56,390
I've heard of course to be good.

6667
02:50:56,480 --> 02:50:56,691
Yeah.

6668
02:50:56,691 --> 02:50:56,851
No,

6669
02:50:56,851 --> 02:50:57,261
it's great.

6670
02:50:57,261 --> 02:50:59,570
That's a crazy well on Wonderboy.

6671
02:50:59,580 --> 02:51:00,170
His leg.

6672
02:51:00,170 --> 02:51:03,080
I really haven't noticed him
getting hit that much either.

6673
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:04,550
It's on both legs to the,

6674
02:51:04,551 --> 02:51:05,450
obviously the right legs.

6675
02:51:05,451 --> 02:51:07,070
Worse with that left leg is pretty tender.

6676
02:51:07,071 --> 02:51:07,904
Roni too.

6677
02:51:08,340 --> 02:51:09,141
They'll ride lego.

6678
02:51:09,141 --> 02:51:10,310
It's really fucked us.

6679
02:51:10,311 --> 02:51:11,960
I don't really remember
him kicking him that heart.

6680
02:51:12,050 --> 02:51:14,990
It must have been when he was
standing in south park sideways,

6681
02:51:15,020 --> 02:51:15,853
you know,

6682
02:51:17,470 --> 02:51:18,810
and now he hasn't gone back then.

6683
02:51:18,820 --> 02:51:20,590
Athey really not mine.

6684
02:51:20,610 --> 02:51:21,371
Let's just round it.

6685
02:51:21,371 --> 02:51:22,204
Doesn't like it.

6686
02:51:22,450 --> 02:51:23,410
Oh my God.

6687
02:51:23,590 --> 02:51:23,750
He,

6688
02:51:23,750 --> 02:51:25,000
his footwork just stupid.

6689
02:51:25,001 --> 02:51:26,740
So Darren till can't
really get a read on them.

6690
02:51:27,970 --> 02:51:28,421
But again,

6691
02:51:28,421 --> 02:51:29,860
the judges are given that the till.

6692
02:51:31,680 --> 02:51:31,861
Yeah,

6693
02:51:31,861 --> 02:51:35,100
that nothing big has happened
where you go all that guide.

6694
02:51:35,250 --> 02:51:36,180
Definitely.

6695
02:51:36,620 --> 02:51:38,730
If someone likes someone
just knock someone down.

6696
02:51:38,760 --> 02:51:39,690
You've got the fight,

6697
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:42,390
it shows Mike LP got the
good right hand to the body.

6698
02:51:49,750 --> 02:51:52,120
So such a high level chess game here,

6699
02:51:52,330 --> 02:51:53,141
which I did get.

6700
02:51:53,141 --> 02:51:54,070
I'm on the edge of my seat.

6701
02:51:54,071 --> 02:51:56,530
But if you're just a regular
fan like come on man.

6702
02:52:00,230 --> 02:52:03,240
I tell you what he's going to
get more shit is Wonderboy.

6703
02:52:03,390 --> 02:52:04,800
Cause there's one Woodley fights,

6704
02:52:04,830 --> 02:52:06,110
which 39 that's fault.

6705
02:52:06,730 --> 02:52:07,391
It's not his fault.

6706
02:52:07,391 --> 02:52:08,480
I'm just saying the public thing.

6707
02:52:08,590 --> 02:52:09,250
Shit,

6708
02:52:09,250 --> 02:52:09,881
I guess.

6709
02:52:09,881 --> 02:52:10,331
I don't know.

6710
02:52:10,331 --> 02:52:11,200
It's what it is.

6711
02:52:11,660 --> 02:52:12,493
It's this is the,

6712
02:52:12,500 --> 02:52:13,990
you mean you want to beat him?

6713
02:52:13,991 --> 02:52:15,870
You got to come after him
and he'd come after him.

6714
02:52:15,871 --> 02:52:16,990
You run into the woodchipper.

6715
02:52:17,110 --> 02:52:19,180
But the thing is he's not
winning when he does this,

6716
02:52:20,530 --> 02:52:23,350
but we didn't win against Woodley
when he did this for sure.

6717
02:52:23,410 --> 02:52:24,560
But he's lacking previously.

6718
02:52:24,800 --> 02:52:26,650
He's obviously got
number one for a reason.

6719
02:52:26,680 --> 02:52:27,461
He's number one in the world.

6720
02:52:27,461 --> 02:52:28,420
I'm happening there.

6721
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:30,130
Cut that back.

6722
02:52:30,131 --> 02:52:31,450
Leg is fucked up man.

6723
02:52:32,200 --> 02:52:32,830
Yeah,

6724
02:52:32,830 --> 02:52:35,180
I'll do friendly voice
will [inaudible] yeah,

6725
02:52:35,200 --> 02:52:37,180
he's wobbling a little
on back to his corner.

6726
02:52:37,181 --> 02:52:38,530
That leg is fucked up man.

6727
02:52:40,750 --> 02:52:43,450
Maybe they just didn't loosen this fifth
round and just save it for the fifth

6728
02:52:43,451 --> 02:52:43,751
round.

6729
02:52:43,751 --> 02:52:44,584
Eddie.

6730
02:52:44,890 --> 02:52:45,700
I hope so.

6731
02:52:45,700 --> 02:52:46,240
Me Too.

6732
02:52:46,240 --> 02:52:46,691
Because again,

6733
02:52:46,691 --> 02:52:47,560
if it stopped right here,

6734
02:52:47,561 --> 02:52:48,400
I'd be bummed out.

6735
02:52:48,940 --> 02:52:51,480
I'm pretty lack luster.

6736
02:52:52,210 --> 02:52:57,210
I was really crushed to give it to till
I'm 100% know that every round of that

6737
02:52:57,720 --> 02:52:58,553
gift.

6738
02:52:59,060 --> 02:53:01,030
And then one like we don't
want to me too obviously.

6739
02:53:01,031 --> 02:53:02,290
And he gives one to one a boy.

6740
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:03,570
I don't know.

6741
02:53:03,570 --> 02:53:06,430
This is up three to one till.

6742
02:53:06,470 --> 02:53:06,860
Yeah.

6743
02:53:06,860 --> 02:53:08,740
Real because of the judges.

6744
02:53:08,770 --> 02:53:09,280
Yes.

6745
02:53:09,280 --> 02:53:10,660
But knowledge is of what you think.

6746
02:53:10,661 --> 02:53:11,110
Right?

6747
02:53:11,110 --> 02:53:12,370
Uh,

6748
02:53:12,460 --> 02:53:13,750
even then it'd be tough.

6749
02:53:14,020 --> 02:53:15,310
You can maybe go to two,

6750
02:53:15,311 --> 02:53:15,971
but I,

6751
02:53:15,971 --> 02:53:17,200
I'd say tills winning this fight.

6752
02:53:18,640 --> 02:53:19,780
I don't know about that.

6753
02:53:19,781 --> 02:53:21,070
I think Wonderboy is winning.

6754
02:53:21,490 --> 02:53:22,930
Can I get some Goddamn copy?

6755
02:53:22,931 --> 02:53:23,591
Strike numbers.

6756
02:53:23,591 --> 02:53:24,131
Fox.

6757
02:53:24,131 --> 02:53:24,640
I know.

6758
02:53:24,640 --> 02:53:25,900
No wonder they left her ass.

6759
02:53:25,930 --> 02:53:26,763
Just kidding.

6760
02:53:27,370 --> 02:53:28,480
Can I get something?

6761
02:53:30,550 --> 02:53:31,930
How's your show going on showtime?

6762
02:53:31,960 --> 02:53:32,793
Enjoying it.

6763
02:53:32,950 --> 02:53:33,401
It's been good,

6764
02:53:33,401 --> 02:53:34,030
man.

6765
02:53:34,030 --> 02:53:34,750
It's been fun.

6766
02:53:34,750 --> 02:53:36,250
Nice to a lot of fun.

6767
02:53:36,280 --> 02:53:40,000
Did you know that guy that just died
without from the comedy division?

6768
02:53:40,001 --> 02:53:40,140
Yeah,

6769
02:53:40,140 --> 02:53:40,973
I did not.

6770
02:53:41,620 --> 02:53:42,550
Did you know,

6771
02:53:42,551 --> 02:53:43,510
everybody seems to think he's,

6772
02:53:43,630 --> 02:53:44,261
I might've met him,

6773
02:53:44,261 --> 02:53:46,120
but everybody seems to think
he's a really good guy.

6774
02:53:46,140 --> 02:53:46,841
Well that sucks,

6775
02:53:46,841 --> 02:53:47,031
man.

6776
02:53:47,031 --> 02:53:47,380
Yeah.

6777
02:53:47,380 --> 02:53:48,400
55 man.

6778
02:53:48,550 --> 02:53:49,270
I know.

6779
02:53:49,270 --> 02:53:49,931
Such a shame.

6780
02:53:49,931 --> 02:53:50,764
Crazy.

6781
02:53:51,450 --> 02:53:52,710
Burt love the Gar tea.

6782
02:53:52,810 --> 02:53:53,320
Oh yeah.

6783
02:53:53,320 --> 02:53:53,621
Yeah.

6784
02:53:53,621 --> 02:53:56,260
I burned up some real nice
to say about also the dice.

6785
02:53:56,410 --> 02:53:57,280
That's a bummer man.

6786
02:53:57,370 --> 02:53:58,203
Yeah.

6787
02:53:59,820 --> 02:54:01,370
Tills super aggressive here.

6788
02:54:01,371 --> 02:54:01,971
Coming off from me.

6789
02:54:01,971 --> 02:54:03,230
I'm sure he wants to get the finish.

6790
02:54:03,440 --> 02:54:04,880
Probably feels a little bit of pressure

6791
02:54:06,650 --> 02:54:07,483
and you should.

6792
02:54:11,060 --> 02:54:11,451
Okay.

6793
02:54:11,451 --> 02:54:12,284
They're same Darren.

6794
02:54:12,590 --> 02:54:13,221
Tills Corns,

6795
02:54:13,221 --> 02:54:14,054
very urgent.

6796
02:54:14,990 --> 02:54:16,100
Like he's losing the fight.

6797
02:54:16,130 --> 02:54:16,963
No.

6798
02:54:17,680 --> 02:54:18,513
Yeah.

6799
02:54:19,530 --> 02:54:20,550
I think he's losing.

6800
02:54:21,060 --> 02:54:21,630
You do.

6801
02:54:21,630 --> 02:54:22,463
Yeah.

6802
02:54:23,490 --> 02:54:23,671
Yeah.

6803
02:54:23,671 --> 02:54:28,290
I think if I would count up all the
different strikes strikes that landed.

6804
02:54:28,350 --> 02:54:28,800
Yeah.

6805
02:54:28,800 --> 02:54:29,320
I think a lot of us,

6806
02:54:29,320 --> 02:54:31,350
according to the UFC thing,

6807
02:54:31,500 --> 02:54:33,960
I don't know in terms
of strikes landed yet,

6808
02:54:33,961 --> 02:54:36,150
says 48 to 42 Goddamn,

6809
02:54:36,151 --> 02:54:37,140
that's tough to judge.

6810
02:54:37,170 --> 02:54:37,320
Yeah.

6811
02:54:37,320 --> 02:54:38,153
That's impossible.

6812
02:54:38,460 --> 02:54:39,360
One aggressor,

6813
02:54:39,420 --> 02:54:41,100
right in Liverpool.

6814
02:54:41,910 --> 02:54:42,960
I got to crazy.

6815
02:54:43,290 --> 02:54:44,700
Five rounds.

6816
02:54:44,760 --> 02:54:46,230
48 strikes landed.

6817
02:54:46,260 --> 02:54:47,930
That is just but not bananas.

6818
02:54:47,990 --> 02:54:49,100
Let a defense going on.

6819
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:49,560
Yeah,

6820
02:54:49,560 --> 02:54:50,520
a lot of missing as well.

6821
02:54:50,560 --> 02:54:51,393
Movement.

6822
02:54:52,620 --> 02:54:53,260
Which tiles?

6823
02:54:53,260 --> 02:54:54,840
Right hand you think
would make for a great,

6824
02:54:54,870 --> 02:54:55,141
oh,

6825
02:54:55,141 --> 02:54:56,420
this a good right hand by Intel.

6826
02:54:56,830 --> 02:54:58,650
A Little Jab to the grill face.

6827
02:54:58,820 --> 02:54:59,653
Yeah.

6828
02:55:02,490 --> 02:55:03,323
Sidekick.

6829
02:55:07,800 --> 02:55:09,960
No one's really going balls
to the wall or they know

6830
02:55:14,260 --> 02:55:15,880
Darren to would go balls to the walls,

6831
02:55:15,881 --> 02:55:16,970
but wonderful.

6832
02:55:16,980 --> 02:55:17,813
It keeps moving.

6833
02:55:18,310 --> 02:55:19,060
It's hard.

6834
02:55:19,060 --> 02:55:20,650
Fucking writing keeps moving.

6835
02:55:20,950 --> 02:55:21,160
You don't,

6836
02:55:21,160 --> 02:55:22,570
you're blasting the face.

6837
02:55:22,630 --> 02:55:22,950
Yeah.

6838
02:55:22,950 --> 02:55:23,783
It's hard.

6839
02:55:24,050 --> 02:55:24,821
What did we come on,

6840
02:55:24,821 --> 02:55:25,031
man.

6841
02:55:25,031 --> 02:55:25,864
Just sit there.

6842
02:55:26,230 --> 02:55:26,891
What was that about?

6843
02:55:26,891 --> 02:55:27,551
He threw a Shitty,

6844
02:55:27,551 --> 02:55:30,220
we'll kick and then shook his
head and then they touch gloves.

6845
02:55:30,250 --> 02:55:30,740
It's fun.

6846
02:55:30,740 --> 02:55:31,510
Fucking weird.

6847
02:55:31,510 --> 02:55:31,980
Oh,

6848
02:55:31,980 --> 02:55:32,550
Ooh.

6849
02:55:32,550 --> 02:55:33,490
Switched up on them.

6850
02:55:34,120 --> 02:55:35,950
It's too are a little too
friendly for my liking.

6851
02:55:35,980 --> 02:55:38,080
He's looking to set up his
wheel kick with his left leg.

6852
02:55:39,680 --> 02:55:40,940
Someone throws something.

6853
02:55:41,710 --> 02:55:42,543
Anything.

6854
02:55:42,610 --> 02:55:43,241
The crowds like,

6855
02:55:43,241 --> 02:55:43,541
yeah,

6856
02:55:43,541 --> 02:55:45,460
that you have on their w w till,

6857
02:55:46,330 --> 02:55:47,163
but he doesn't.

6858
02:55:49,550 --> 02:55:49,760
Oh,

6859
02:55:49,760 --> 02:55:49,950
there.

6860
02:55:49,950 --> 02:55:51,020
Dairy landed a lefthand.

6861
02:55:52,910 --> 02:55:53,743
Why are they touching?

6862
02:55:53,960 --> 02:55:56,740
What do I wouldn't touch dab
cause got all the goddamn corner.

6863
02:55:56,780 --> 02:55:58,670
Oh is that about gorillas?

6864
02:55:58,671 --> 02:55:59,504
Don't act like that.

6865
02:55:59,540 --> 02:56:00,710
I don't understand this.

6866
02:56:00,711 --> 02:56:01,550
That does touch gloves.

6867
02:56:01,551 --> 02:56:01,850
Again,

6868
02:56:01,850 --> 02:56:02,840
too much respect.

6869
02:56:02,841 --> 02:56:05,600
I know there's not enough
killer instinct in this.

6870
02:56:06,260 --> 02:56:10,190
He's looking for that low fake and then
go with the high round kick off the

6871
02:56:10,191 --> 02:56:10,671
front leg.

6872
02:56:10,671 --> 02:56:11,660
He does that sometimes,

6873
02:56:12,290 --> 02:56:13,130
but he didn't do it.

6874
02:56:13,131 --> 02:56:15,800
And you just like to know how many
miles they've ran this goddamn fight.

6875
02:56:17,360 --> 02:56:19,130
You kind of give it to them
for sticking to their phone.

6876
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:21,720
No one's getting out of
composure here to pros.

6877
02:56:21,721 --> 02:56:22,130
Pros.

6878
02:56:22,130 --> 02:56:22,310
No,

6879
02:56:22,310 --> 02:56:23,270
I get the style.

6880
02:56:23,271 --> 02:56:23,511
You don't,

6881
02:56:23,511 --> 02:56:24,560
you don't want to risk it.

6882
02:56:26,240 --> 02:56:26,840
But if you,

6883
02:56:26,840 --> 02:56:28,370
if you're not balls deep in a fighting,

6884
02:56:28,371 --> 02:56:29,540
you're not happy with this fight.

6885
02:56:29,570 --> 02:56:29,711
No,

6886
02:56:29,711 --> 02:56:30,890
I'm not thrilled with it.

6887
02:56:30,920 --> 02:56:35,060
This is one of the most
uneventful big events.

6888
02:56:35,900 --> 02:56:37,490
Who good jabs by till.

6889
02:56:39,080 --> 02:56:43,390
Oh Damn Guillotine.

6890
02:56:44,850 --> 02:56:45,181
Oh He,

6891
02:56:45,181 --> 02:56:45,610
I thought he,

6892
02:56:45,610 --> 02:56:47,010
Oh shit.

6893
02:56:47,220 --> 02:56:48,270
That's enough to win the fight.

6894
02:56:48,390 --> 02:56:49,950
100% that's why you need it.

6895
02:56:50,490 --> 02:56:52,560
Don't get drop time to go
a little bit of time to go,

6896
02:56:52,590 --> 02:56:52,770
damn.

6897
02:56:52,770 --> 02:56:54,390
How hard does that motherfucker hit?

6898
02:56:54,391 --> 02:56:55,091
And it didn't look like it.

6899
02:56:55,091 --> 02:56:55,381
Atlanta,

6900
02:56:55,381 --> 02:56:56,400
like behind the air.

6901
02:56:57,060 --> 02:56:58,200
We'd have to look at it in the replay,

6902
02:56:58,201 --> 02:56:59,130
but it look or you heard him?

6903
02:57:00,490 --> 02:57:00,900
I wonder.

6904
02:57:00,900 --> 02:57:02,400
Boy has got to move his ass now.

6905
02:57:02,401 --> 02:57:03,270
He lost the fight.

6906
02:57:03,480 --> 02:57:03,871
Well wonder boy,

6907
02:57:03,871 --> 02:57:04,704
he's in trouble now.

6908
02:57:04,900 --> 02:57:05,260
He might.

6909
02:57:05,260 --> 02:57:06,031
He's flat footed.

6910
02:57:06,031 --> 02:57:06,840
Yeah.

6911
02:57:06,840 --> 02:57:09,060
What are ways to be a little bit
trouble is what till lives where?

6912
02:57:10,730 --> 02:57:11,563
Okay.

6913
02:57:17,250 --> 02:57:17,731
Damn.

6914
02:57:17,731 --> 02:57:18,870
Wonderboy would have won to

6915
02:57:20,400 --> 02:57:22,230
till just out arrange for it to hurt.

6916
02:57:25,810 --> 02:57:26,621
This got interesting.

6917
02:57:26,621 --> 02:57:27,280
That's for sure.

6918
02:57:27,280 --> 02:57:27,970
Proud man.

6919
02:57:27,970 --> 02:57:29,020
Everyone's on their feet now,

6920
02:57:29,680 --> 02:57:32,500
but this is like wonder boy when
he fought Tyron Woodley to right.

6921
02:57:32,501 --> 02:57:33,191
Got Tagged,

6922
02:57:33,191 --> 02:57:35,380
got hurt and then people
rushing it dealt with,

6923
02:57:36,460 --> 02:57:37,293
look at this.

6924
02:57:37,790 --> 02:57:38,221
Wonderful.

6925
02:57:38,221 --> 02:57:39,520
I wouldn't fucking take down.

6926
02:57:40,400 --> 02:57:41,233
Awesome.

6927
02:57:41,640 --> 02:57:42,473
No Shit.

6928
02:57:42,600 --> 02:57:43,050
No Shit.

6929
02:57:43,050 --> 02:57:45,160
Ain't signed with Sony shoe in
for a take down or these stills?

6930
02:57:45,170 --> 02:57:46,003
Yeah.

6931
02:57:46,550 --> 02:57:47,300
Oh,

6932
02:57:47,300 --> 02:57:48,170
straight left

6933
02:57:51,800 --> 02:57:53,300
Wonderboy still dangerous.

6934
02:57:53,301 --> 02:57:53,960
Crazy.

6935
02:57:53,960 --> 02:57:54,793
Huh?

6936
02:57:59,840 --> 02:58:00,950
40 seconds.

6937
02:58:01,170 --> 02:58:02,130
Boys who tell just thinks

6938
02:58:02,130 --> 02:58:02,970
he has in the bag?

6939
02:58:03,240 --> 02:58:03,841
I don't think so.

6940
02:58:03,841 --> 02:58:05,850
I just think he doesn't want
to get tagged coming in.

6941
02:58:07,110 --> 02:58:08,010
He's a little tired too.

6942
02:58:08,011 --> 02:58:08,844
Mouth's open.

6943
02:58:13,870 --> 02:58:15,140
Hasn't been a high pace.

6944
02:58:15,141 --> 02:58:16,360
There's been a lot of foot work though,

6945
02:58:16,361 --> 02:58:17,194
so you might be a little,

6946
02:58:17,620 --> 02:58:20,440
well you got to rent and remember till
did have a real hard time cutting that

6947
02:58:20,441 --> 02:58:20,980
weight.

6948
02:58:20,980 --> 02:58:22,210
Oh and he's been going through a lot.

6949
02:58:22,211 --> 02:58:23,044
You're right.

6950
02:58:24,850 --> 02:58:26,300
They need some get downs in this.

6951
02:58:26,580 --> 02:58:26,910
You Ain't,

6952
02:58:26,910 --> 02:58:27,743
you ain't,

6953
02:58:29,260 --> 02:58:30,093
you ain't lying.

6954
02:58:30,130 --> 02:58:30,911
No standups.

6955
02:58:30,911 --> 02:58:31,744
Just get down.

6956
02:58:32,530 --> 02:58:33,363
Get down.

6957
02:58:37,940 --> 02:58:38,061
Yeah.

6958
02:58:38,061 --> 02:58:39,230
There's no way you have one a boy.

6959
02:58:39,231 --> 02:58:40,190
The flat after that.

6960
02:58:41,180 --> 02:58:42,350
It'd be hard pressed.

6961
02:58:42,680 --> 02:58:44,780
Especially in Liverpool man.

6962
02:58:44,781 --> 02:58:46,800
Until I want to boys
in a tough spot though.

6963
02:58:48,680 --> 02:58:50,390
I don't know why he's
that happy about that.

6964
02:58:50,391 --> 02:58:51,224
That was um,

6965
02:58:51,410 --> 02:58:53,030
I mean he landed a good shot.

6966
02:58:53,060 --> 02:58:54,050
I guess he was trying,

6967
02:58:54,080 --> 02:58:55,370
it wasn't like he wasn't trying.

6968
02:58:55,400 --> 02:58:56,090
Yeah,

6969
02:58:56,090 --> 02:59:00,740
he was [inaudible] drank till after
that lackluster performance cause he,

6970
02:59:00,741 --> 02:59:01,730
cause Wonderboy is number one.

6971
02:59:01,731 --> 02:59:02,151
You'll like him,

6972
02:59:02,151 --> 02:59:04,220
number one obviously I think
you put them in the top.

6973
02:59:04,700 --> 02:59:06,920
Waterboy is just a
nightmare for everybody.

6974
02:59:07,340 --> 02:59:08,900
He's a nightmare for everybody.

6975
02:59:10,010 --> 02:59:10,580
Yeah.

6976
02:59:10,580 --> 02:59:10,881
Just,

6977
02:59:10,881 --> 02:59:12,160
it's tough to look good against him.

6978
02:59:12,240 --> 02:59:12,371
Oh,

6979
02:59:12,371 --> 02:59:14,420
win over him is as a win.

6980
02:59:14,500 --> 02:59:14,780
You know,

6981
02:59:14,780 --> 02:59:17,030
he beat you back at number one.

6982
02:59:17,300 --> 02:59:17,511
Well,

6983
02:59:17,511 --> 02:59:18,680
he didn't even make the weight.

6984
02:59:18,830 --> 02:59:19,551
So that's,

6985
02:59:19,551 --> 02:59:22,370
that's where it gets tricky because
no one gives a fuck about that.

6986
02:59:22,400 --> 02:59:22,641
Right,

6987
02:59:22,641 --> 02:59:24,500
but you're saying that they fought here.

6988
02:59:24,560 --> 02:59:25,610
Here's that front leg side.

6989
02:59:25,611 --> 02:59:26,750
Kick that wobble his knee.

6990
02:59:27,170 --> 02:59:27,651
Good job.

6991
02:59:27,651 --> 02:59:28,371
Metro pcs.

6992
02:59:28,371 --> 02:59:29,300
A block in the vision.

6993
02:59:29,330 --> 02:59:30,440
God Damn it.

6994
02:59:30,441 --> 02:59:31,101
Metro pcs.

6995
02:59:31,101 --> 02:59:31,934
Why would they do that?

6996
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:33,800
Why would they have that
right where you need to see?

6997
02:59:34,010 --> 02:59:34,730
I'll tell you right now,

6998
02:59:34,730 --> 02:59:35,331
if you're my friend,

6999
02:59:35,331 --> 02:59:36,290
you have metro pcs.

7000
02:59:36,291 --> 02:59:37,400
We are not friends anymore.

7001
02:59:37,640 --> 02:59:38,270
Knocked down,

7002
02:59:38,270 --> 02:59:38,970
knocked down.

7003
02:59:38,970 --> 02:59:40,430
Do you get angry with
just because of that?

7004
02:59:40,670 --> 02:59:41,061
Well,

7005
02:59:41,061 --> 02:59:41,301
no,

7006
02:59:41,301 --> 02:59:45,440
I get angry because the cricket
wireless cell phones now cricket.

7007
02:59:45,890 --> 02:59:47,410
Oh Shit.

7008
02:59:47,420 --> 02:59:49,160
Hard fucking left hand.

7009
02:59:50,120 --> 02:59:50,953
Boom.

7010
02:59:50,960 --> 02:59:51,680
Right bye.

7011
02:59:51,680 --> 02:59:52,520
That was legit.

7012
02:59:52,780 --> 02:59:53,270
The fight.

7013
02:59:53,270 --> 02:59:55,460
He clobbered them right
there behind the air.

7014
02:59:55,461 --> 02:59:55,940
Huh?

7015
02:59:55,940 --> 02:59:57,350
That was as legitimate gets.

7016
02:59:58,120 --> 02:59:58,650
Doesn't make sense.

7017
02:59:58,650 --> 03:00:00,710
That was the legit shot of the fire.

7018
03:00:00,760 --> 03:00:02,030
Like one legit shot.

7019
03:00:02,720 --> 03:00:05,660
That's why like if you have
49 other strikes at land,

7020
03:00:05,690 --> 03:00:06,620
do they even count?

7021
03:00:07,160 --> 03:00:07,820
I mean that,

7022
03:00:07,820 --> 03:00:08,511
that's a real,

7023
03:00:08,511 --> 03:00:09,344
strike that.

7024
03:00:09,590 --> 03:00:11,780
Do you ever use the word clobber when,

7025
03:00:12,050 --> 03:00:13,190
when you're calling fights,

7026
03:00:13,630 --> 03:00:14,463
I don't call fights.

7027
03:00:14,600 --> 03:00:15,260
Cooperate.

7028
03:00:15,260 --> 03:00:15,980
Claude was nine.

7029
03:00:15,980 --> 03:00:19,340
My addiction know bomber to
old school collaborating,

7030
03:00:19,341 --> 03:00:20,090
clobbered them.

7031
03:00:20,090 --> 03:00:21,980
Clobbering collapses.

7032
03:00:23,660 --> 03:00:24,590
The thing says that,

7033
03:00:24,591 --> 03:00:24,920
right?

7034
03:00:24,920 --> 03:00:25,281
Yeah.

7035
03:00:25,281 --> 03:00:29,360
If the thank you tastic
for clobbering time

7036
03:00:31,070 --> 03:00:31,600
guy.

7037
03:00:31,600 --> 03:00:32,240
I need to bring that up.

7038
03:00:32,240 --> 03:00:33,380
So what do we think here?

7039
03:00:33,620 --> 03:00:34,100
What do you think?

7040
03:00:34,100 --> 03:00:37,960
You think chill until all hundred
percent for one till around stone.

7041
03:00:38,060 --> 03:00:38,920
Close to switching.

7042
03:00:39,020 --> 03:00:40,760
I think til split.

7043
03:00:40,761 --> 03:00:43,730
Someone's going to give it
to Wonderboy to some rebel.

7044
03:00:43,970 --> 03:00:45,860
Some revenue wants to die in Liverpool.

7045
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:47,950
I want to get going on Michelle.

7046
03:00:48,020 --> 03:00:48,800
They place up.

7047
03:00:48,800 --> 03:00:50,150
Will they set that place on fire?

7048
03:00:50,151 --> 03:00:51,250
If they do give to Wonderboy,

7049
03:00:53,090 --> 03:00:55,130
the report card and the paint,

7050
03:00:55,300 --> 03:00:58,460
you know there's some hooligans
then it's going to be a tough,

7051
03:00:59,020 --> 03:01:00,320
it's going to be a tough exit

7052
03:01:00,330 --> 03:01:01,163
strategy.

7053
03:01:02,100 --> 03:01:02,933
Is that a Dell,

7054
03:01:03,520 --> 03:01:04,061
Dell Bird?

7055
03:01:04,061 --> 03:01:05,020
Where the fuck her name is?

7056
03:01:05,021 --> 03:01:06,370
She the in Adelaide.

7057
03:01:06,380 --> 03:01:08,470
Birds fly her out there.

7058
03:01:08,500 --> 03:01:09,210
You never know.

7059
03:01:09,210 --> 03:01:10,420
She seen everywhere fucker.

7060
03:01:10,450 --> 03:01:11,650
Does she go everywhere?

7061
03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:11,920
Yeah,

7062
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:13,870
she like gives lessons
on judging and stuff.

7063
03:01:14,950 --> 03:01:17,680
You don't think they put
her in there for a reason?

7064
03:01:17,830 --> 03:01:18,101
You know,

7065
03:01:18,101 --> 03:01:19,120
cause she don't give a fuck.

7066
03:01:19,121 --> 03:01:20,290
So you want to do it on purpose?

7067
03:01:20,530 --> 03:01:23,140
I think they w they want,

7068
03:01:23,170 --> 03:01:23,660
um,

7069
03:01:23,660 --> 03:01:24,191
controversy.

7070
03:01:24,191 --> 03:01:26,590
Do you want people to get
used to fucked up decisions?

7071
03:01:26,680 --> 03:01:28,090
What we're used to it that's,

7072
03:01:28,240 --> 03:01:29,073
yeah,

7073
03:01:29,670 --> 03:01:30,060
yeah,

7074
03:01:30,060 --> 03:01:30,460
yeah.

7075
03:01:30,460 --> 03:01:31,011
I think they,

7076
03:01:31,011 --> 03:01:34,210
they want that because if they
ever needed to pull something out,

7077
03:01:34,211 --> 03:01:35,050
like something was like,

7078
03:01:35,051 --> 03:01:35,260
dude,

7079
03:01:35,260 --> 03:01:36,360
this motherfucker has to win.

7080
03:01:37,110 --> 03:01:37,390
You know?

7081
03:01:37,390 --> 03:01:37,870
People are like,

7082
03:01:37,870 --> 03:01:38,021
Oh,

7083
03:01:38,021 --> 03:01:38,950
it is Vegas.

7084
03:01:39,540 --> 03:01:42,110
Seattle boxing's crept his ship.

7085
03:01:42,111 --> 03:01:42,701
But with MMA,

7086
03:01:42,701 --> 03:01:44,470
I just think they don't know
what they're looking at.

7087
03:01:44,500 --> 03:01:45,400
They don't understand.

7088
03:01:45,920 --> 03:01:46,490
Correct.

7089
03:01:46,490 --> 03:01:47,730
They just don't know either way.

7090
03:01:47,740 --> 03:01:48,573
It's,

7091
03:01:48,820 --> 03:01:48,941
Oh,

7092
03:01:48,941 --> 03:01:49,660
here we go.

7093
03:01:49,660 --> 03:01:50,410
Here we go.

7094
03:01:50,410 --> 03:01:50,711
Jamie,

7095
03:01:50,711 --> 03:01:51,580
can you give us some volume

7096
03:01:53,580 --> 03:01:53,811
here?

7097
03:01:53,811 --> 03:01:57,200
We just split up or be
a killer strip club.

7098
03:01:57,280 --> 03:02:00,670
Dj 46 and 49

7099
03:02:01,470 --> 03:02:02,303
unanimous.

7100
03:02:02,650 --> 03:02:03,483
Oh,

7101
03:02:06,480 --> 03:02:07,410
Holy Shit.

7102
03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:08,753
Wow.

7103
03:02:11,200 --> 03:02:11,360
Well,

7104
03:02:11,360 --> 03:02:12,730
he didn't even need that knocked down.

7105
03:02:13,030 --> 03:02:14,050
That's a big fight for him.

7106
03:02:14,680 --> 03:02:15,670
What were some of those scores?

7107
03:02:15,671 --> 03:02:16,300
I can hear it.

7108
03:02:16,300 --> 03:02:21,300
(494) 074-0840 seven or
take 494649464847 well,

7109
03:02:23,890 --> 03:02:24,723
that's,

7110
03:02:25,090 --> 03:02:26,260
that's a big victory for him,

7111
03:02:26,261 --> 03:02:27,130
that's for sure.

7112
03:02:30,370 --> 03:02:31,760
You pointed Wonderboy,

7113
03:02:32,150 --> 03:02:33,420
these people they can get for you.

7114
03:02:34,110 --> 03:02:35,280
What does it feel like you're not fix?

7115
03:02:35,281 --> 03:02:36,114
You're on your way.

7116
03:02:37,550 --> 03:02:38,383
Hmm.

7117
03:02:39,670 --> 03:02:40,990
I think you said something bad.

7118
03:02:41,330 --> 03:02:43,000
I think you some potty language there.

7119
03:02:43,210 --> 03:02:44,043
What do you think?

7120
03:02:44,320 --> 03:02:45,080
I mean,

7121
03:02:45,080 --> 03:02:46,330
very strategic point.

7122
03:02:46,331 --> 03:02:47,770
Did you expect it to go the distance?

7123
03:02:47,771 --> 03:02:49,390
Did you think he was going to
be like the whole way through?

7124
03:02:50,270 --> 03:02:52,300
I played games and I don't speak.

7125
03:02:52,301 --> 03:02:52,640
It kicks.

7126
03:02:52,640 --> 03:02:53,473
I'm gonna get some flights up.

7127
03:02:53,500 --> 03:02:54,280
I on

7128
03:02:54,280 --> 03:02:55,240
the classified to

7129
03:02:57,070 --> 03:02:58,690
have such a specific way of talking.

7130
03:02:59,830 --> 03:03:02,740
I feel it's so much cooler when
they talk like this is a fighter.

7131
03:03:02,830 --> 03:03:03,663
Yeah.

7132
03:03:03,810 --> 03:03:04,643
It's pretty cool.

7133
03:03:04,820 --> 03:03:05,653
I thought

7134
03:03:07,780 --> 03:03:08,613
I'm going to show

7135
03:03:10,590 --> 03:03:11,423
up

7136
03:03:13,060 --> 03:03:18,060
in 14 so I was 13 I'm going to
hold this bike to figure out.

7137
03:03:26,430 --> 03:03:27,270
Not really.

7138
03:03:27,330 --> 03:03:27,691
Really.

7139
03:03:27,691 --> 03:03:28,524
I'd have to him.

7140
03:03:28,740 --> 03:03:29,573
Yeah.

7141
03:03:29,620 --> 03:03:30,453
Yes.

7142
03:03:33,140 --> 03:03:33,973
What does he saying?

7143
03:03:34,510 --> 03:03:35,343
What it,

7144
03:03:35,490 --> 03:03:36,650
but what are they saying?

7145
03:03:38,230 --> 03:03:39,063
Boy?

7146
03:03:39,070 --> 03:03:40,210
Fucking censorship.

7147
03:03:41,530 --> 03:03:41,741
Yeah.

7148
03:03:41,741 --> 03:03:42,400
Well let me,

7149
03:03:42,400 --> 03:03:43,690
let me hear the Bjorks neck.

7150
03:03:44,430 --> 03:03:44,820
Yeah.

7151
03:03:44,820 --> 03:03:45,631
Said everyone.

7152
03:03:45,631 --> 03:03:46,021
Anyone?

7153
03:03:46,021 --> 03:03:46,854
I don't care.

7154
03:03:52,030 --> 03:03:52,280
Yep.

7155
03:03:52,280 --> 03:03:53,001
People ask him.

7156
03:03:53,001 --> 03:03:54,700
Maybe you might visit the time.

7157
03:03:54,710 --> 03:03:55,543
She'll talk to me.

7158
03:03:57,350 --> 03:03:58,130
God Damn

7159
03:03:58,130 --> 03:03:59,480
with the censorship.

7160
03:04:00,250 --> 03:04:01,083
Yeah.

7161
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:02,433
ESPN.

7162
03:04:02,530 --> 03:04:04,630
Please let these guys swear.

7163
03:04:04,690 --> 03:04:06,280
Please come on.

7164
03:04:06,640 --> 03:04:07,241
They're not going to let it.

7165
03:04:07,241 --> 03:04:07,650
No Way.

7166
03:04:07,650 --> 03:04:09,580
He's going to be worse and he owns ESPN.

7167
03:04:10,020 --> 03:04:10,710
That's true.

7168
03:04:10,710 --> 03:04:11,450
Good call.

7169
03:04:11,450 --> 03:04:12,283
Which is worse.

7170
03:04:12,550 --> 03:04:14,530
They might not even let me
do commentary over there.

7171
03:04:14,550 --> 03:04:16,660
You have you guys seen
solo hockey about that?

7172
03:04:16,690 --> 03:04:17,450
You out.

7173
03:04:17,450 --> 03:04:18,730
Disney took over star wars,

7174
03:04:18,731 --> 03:04:19,480
right?

7175
03:04:19,480 --> 03:04:20,090
Yeah.

7176
03:04:20,090 --> 03:04:20,923
Be Solo.

7177
03:04:21,070 --> 03:04:21,610
No,

7178
03:04:21,610 --> 03:04:21,821
dude,

7179
03:04:21,821 --> 03:04:24,850
I lasted literally six
minutes and I walked out.

7180
03:04:25,960 --> 03:04:26,410
Yes.

7181
03:04:26,410 --> 03:04:26,651
No,

7182
03:04:26,651 --> 03:04:27,090
six,

7183
03:04:27,090 --> 03:04:27,371
nine.

7184
03:04:27,371 --> 03:04:28,380
It's give it a shot.

7185
03:04:28,450 --> 03:04:28,571
No.

7186
03:04:28,571 --> 03:04:29,020
The reason,

7187
03:04:29,020 --> 03:04:29,950
the reason why I walked down,

7188
03:04:29,951 --> 03:04:34,180
I realize what it is about star
wars lovers in the chase scenes.

7189
03:04:34,360 --> 03:04:34,620
They,

7190
03:04:34,620 --> 03:04:36,290
they use the classic Star Wars.

7191
03:04:36,310 --> 03:04:37,210
Star wars movies.

7192
03:04:37,660 --> 03:04:38,350
Music.

7193
03:04:38,350 --> 03:04:38,760
Yeah.

7194
03:04:38,760 --> 03:04:40,710
Like that music is just so [inaudible].

7195
03:04:40,990 --> 03:04:43,690
Hannah Jones can't be corny.

7196
03:04:44,170 --> 03:04:45,070
I couldn't stand it,

7197
03:04:45,071 --> 03:04:45,904
man.

7198
03:04:46,090 --> 03:04:47,830
The fuck out and I was ready,

7199
03:04:47,831 --> 03:04:48,011
Dude.

7200
03:04:48,011 --> 03:04:48,970
I had fucking candy.

7201
03:04:49,350 --> 03:04:50,183
I was ready.

7202
03:04:51,040 --> 03:04:51,950
I was ready.

7203
03:04:52,900 --> 03:04:56,110
I had one of those of those
chicken baguettes with a barbecue.

7204
03:04:56,110 --> 03:04:57,610
Watermelon sauce.

7205
03:04:57,880 --> 03:04:58,661
Barbecue.

7206
03:04:58,661 --> 03:05:01,590
Watermelon sauce on you still walked.

7207
03:05:01,930 --> 03:05:02,890
As soon as I was done,

7208
03:05:02,950 --> 03:05:03,800
I killed it before then.

7209
03:05:03,940 --> 03:05:07,900
I was done with that before the movie
even started that the chicken watermelon

7210
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,060
Barnsco by myself.

7211
03:05:10,450 --> 03:05:12,000
You went to see if it's
actually interesting move.

7212
03:05:12,430 --> 03:05:13,263
Wow.

7213
03:05:13,690 --> 03:05:15,190
At The arc light in Sherman oaks.

7214
03:05:15,370 --> 03:05:15,970
Really?

7215
03:05:15,970 --> 03:05:16,180
Yeah.

7216
03:05:16,180 --> 03:05:18,010
You showed up for yourself.

7217
03:05:18,430 --> 03:05:19,263
My uh,

7218
03:05:19,270 --> 03:05:21,700
my wife took my son to some,

7219
03:05:21,790 --> 03:05:21,941
uh,

7220
03:05:21,941 --> 03:05:25,850
birthday party thing and they were going
to be gone for a couple of hours and I

7221
03:05:25,890 --> 03:05:26,201
just said,

7222
03:05:26,201 --> 03:05:27,190
you know what I'm going to go to.

7223
03:05:27,191 --> 03:05:27,520
I like,

7224
03:05:27,520 --> 03:05:29,800
I like that the idea of going to movies,

7225
03:05:29,830 --> 03:05:31,210
it's just that they all suck.

7226
03:05:31,600 --> 03:05:32,560
But I like going,

7227
03:05:32,561 --> 03:05:33,160
I like,

7228
03:05:33,160 --> 03:05:35,350
I like buying some candy or solo though.

7229
03:05:35,590 --> 03:05:36,423
It doesn't matter.

7230
03:05:36,660 --> 03:05:38,980
I go by myself all the time.

7231
03:05:39,490 --> 03:05:40,061
I did,

7232
03:05:40,061 --> 03:05:40,894
I did not,

7233
03:05:40,960 --> 03:05:42,460
not so much since I had a kid,

7234
03:05:42,790 --> 03:05:44,830
but back in the day I would
go all the time by myself.

7235
03:05:44,860 --> 03:05:47,140
I think I've only been maybe three times,

7236
03:05:48,040 --> 03:05:50,200
not even in my life by myself.

7237
03:05:50,230 --> 03:05:53,860
I saw a student turbine only because I
want to be able to leave if I go with

7238
03:05:53,861 --> 03:05:57,280
someone else and I got a fucking state
cause nobody likes to talk to them.

7239
03:05:57,281 --> 03:05:58,360
And I like no,

7240
03:05:58,361 --> 03:05:59,530
most people don't like leaving.

7241
03:05:59,830 --> 03:06:00,663
Most people they get,

7242
03:06:00,670 --> 03:06:03,250
so I got to fucking sit there
for the whole stupid movie.

7243
03:06:03,640 --> 03:06:04,630
So have I like minutes.

7244
03:06:05,150 --> 03:06:07,360
I like the freedom to leave cause I won't,

7245
03:06:07,630 --> 03:06:09,610
I want as soon as I don't
give a shit about the movie,

7246
03:06:09,611 --> 03:06:11,710
I'm out or Deadpool two is amazing.

7247
03:06:11,740 --> 03:06:12,311
That was good.

7248
03:06:12,311 --> 03:06:12,911
I stayed for that.

7249
03:06:12,911 --> 03:06:14,020
I saw that by myself too.

7250
03:06:14,410 --> 03:06:15,130
That was good.

7251
03:06:15,130 --> 03:06:15,580
Yeah.

7252
03:06:15,580 --> 03:06:17,440
Deadpool tunes because
she moved by herself.

7253
03:06:17,550 --> 03:06:18,900
Know I really need that.

7254
03:06:18,970 --> 03:06:19,241
Yeah.

7255
03:06:19,241 --> 03:06:20,050
I've never,

7256
03:06:20,050 --> 03:06:20,890
I I just need to,

7257
03:06:20,891 --> 03:06:22,300
I just need the freedom to leave.

7258
03:06:22,301 --> 03:06:22,521
That's,

7259
03:06:22,521 --> 03:06:23,860
that's really what that's about.

7260
03:06:24,210 --> 03:06:25,043
Hmm.

7261
03:06:26,350 --> 03:06:26,521
Dude.

7262
03:06:26,521 --> 03:06:29,050
That welterweight division
is pure fire right now.

7263
03:06:29,890 --> 03:06:30,161
Yeah,

7264
03:06:30,161 --> 03:06:30,701
no kidding.

7265
03:06:30,701 --> 03:06:31,030
Right.

7266
03:06:31,030 --> 03:06:32,320
Pure fucking fire.

7267
03:06:33,340 --> 03:06:35,770
I think at all the young
guys out of Colby Covington,

7268
03:06:36,470 --> 03:06:37,600
Uzman and then,

7269
03:06:37,601 --> 03:06:37,780
uh,

7270
03:06:37,780 --> 03:06:38,381
Darren till,

7271
03:06:38,381 --> 03:06:40,600
till if I had to bet on
one of them being like the,

7272
03:06:40,660 --> 03:06:41,980
the world champion be till,

7273
03:06:42,100 --> 03:06:42,580
I think so,

7274
03:06:42,580 --> 03:06:43,060
yeah.

7275
03:06:43,060 --> 03:06:43,690
Out of all those,

7276
03:06:43,690 --> 03:06:43,851
the,

7277
03:06:43,851 --> 03:06:44,680
those three guys,

7278
03:06:44,680 --> 03:06:45,670
dangerous motherfucker,

7279
03:06:45,671 --> 03:06:46,420
that's for sure.

7280
03:06:46,420 --> 03:06:47,710
If you trade them with that guy.

7281
03:06:47,740 --> 03:06:50,980
I mean the thing that wonder boy did that
was so interesting is he's just never

7282
03:06:50,981 --> 03:06:51,640
there.

7283
03:06:51,640 --> 03:06:52,540
He's just never there.

7284
03:06:52,541 --> 03:06:52,870
And it,

7285
03:06:52,870 --> 03:06:56,130
it made it a hard fight
for to keep his composure

7286
03:06:56,130 --> 03:07:00,330
and fight five hard rounds and constantly
be chasing them and wonder boys never

7287
03:07:00,331 --> 03:07:03,330
there and wonder what tagged him a
couple times but til I was the one that

7288
03:07:03,331 --> 03:07:07,830
landed the big haymaker but you also
see till under control experience still

7289
03:07:07,831 --> 03:07:08,161
stuck.

7290
03:07:08,161 --> 03:07:10,080
This technique is me tough to beat man.

7291
03:07:10,560 --> 03:07:13,320
Now I'd like to see him against a
guy who has high level wrestling,

7292
03:07:13,321 --> 03:07:16,670
like a Colby come dinner Woodlea or uh,

7293
03:07:16,690 --> 03:07:17,440
even who you know,

7294
03:07:17,440 --> 03:07:18,730
been super high level wrestler.

7295
03:07:18,750 --> 03:07:20,970
I see that where it's not
ideal matchup for him,

7296
03:07:20,971 --> 03:07:24,070
see how he performs cause
cowboy and Wonderboy are there.

7297
03:07:24,090 --> 03:07:24,481
Striker.

7298
03:07:24,481 --> 03:07:24,830
So it's,

7299
03:07:24,830 --> 03:07:25,940
it's it's wheelhouse.

7300
03:07:25,980 --> 03:07:26,280
Yup.

7301
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:27,260
Let me see your Rda.

7302
03:07:27,270 --> 03:07:28,260
Huseman or Colby?

7303
03:07:28,261 --> 03:07:28,740
Killington.

7304
03:07:28,740 --> 03:07:28,981
Yeah.

7305
03:07:28,981 --> 03:07:30,540
I would like to see him versus cope.

7306
03:07:30,650 --> 03:07:32,360
I think [inaudible] fine.

7307
03:07:33,030 --> 03:07:33,601
That's a good question.

7308
03:07:33,601 --> 03:07:35,030
Purple because the purple thing,

7309
03:07:35,070 --> 03:07:35,831
I'm pretty sure he's a purple.

7310
03:07:35,831 --> 03:07:36,720
He's been doing it for awhile.

7311
03:07:37,290 --> 03:07:38,123
Um,

7312
03:07:38,310 --> 03:07:39,210
but uh,

7313
03:07:39,240 --> 03:07:39,511
see,

7314
03:07:39,511 --> 03:07:40,760
I don't think you do Colby Rich Dad.

7315
03:07:40,810 --> 03:07:42,600
I don't think you could kill
off the young lions yet.

7316
03:07:42,750 --> 03:07:45,150
I think you let the young lions
go after the Robbie Lawler's,

7317
03:07:45,360 --> 03:07:46,260
the cowboys,

7318
03:07:46,290 --> 03:07:48,380
the RDAs do it that way.

7319
03:07:48,410 --> 03:07:50,910
They think that way or do they just try
and make the best fights that can do

7320
03:07:50,920 --> 03:07:51,753
UFC?

7321
03:07:52,110 --> 03:07:52,943
There's nobody saying,

7322
03:07:52,980 --> 03:07:54,230
oh just what do you like?

7323
03:07:54,250 --> 03:07:54,730
You know,

7324
03:07:54,730 --> 03:07:56,550
I think it's just whatever the fuck works.

7325
03:07:56,720 --> 03:07:58,560
Cause this fight doesn't make
too much sense for wonder boy.

7326
03:07:59,100 --> 03:07:59,790
Right.

7327
03:07:59,790 --> 03:08:01,440
But it's a fun fight for us to watch.

7328
03:08:01,470 --> 03:08:02,010
Yeah,

7329
03:08:02,010 --> 03:08:02,491
very fun.

7330
03:08:02,491 --> 03:08:03,324
Fight to watch,

7331
03:08:03,660 --> 03:08:03,970
man.

7332
03:08:03,970 --> 03:08:05,880
There's a clubbing punch or boom.

7333
03:08:05,910 --> 03:08:06,470
Yeah,

7334
03:08:06,470 --> 03:08:07,303
a lot of power.

7335
03:08:07,500 --> 03:08:07,681
Yeah,

7336
03:08:07,681 --> 03:08:09,480
he's got power and he's a big fella.

7337
03:08:09,960 --> 03:08:10,681
I mean if he,

7338
03:08:10,681 --> 03:08:15,681
if they wanted him to have to weigh
188 they know that he's probably well,

7339
03:08:16,500 --> 03:08:21,500
well north of that I'd probably come in
and well north of 200 c but missing the

7340
03:08:21,511 --> 03:08:22,130
weight,

7341
03:08:22,130 --> 03:08:23,790
we don't make a big enough deal of it.

7342
03:08:23,790 --> 03:08:25,680
I don't give a f I don't
really kill either.

7343
03:08:25,681 --> 03:08:28,260
But it is a problem and
it's a huge problem.

7344
03:08:28,261 --> 03:08:29,490
It's such an advantage.

7345
03:08:29,491 --> 03:08:31,190
But like with Mackenzie dern,

7346
03:08:31,210 --> 03:08:31,860
after she missed it,

7347
03:08:31,860 --> 03:08:32,401
I didn't care.

7348
03:08:32,401 --> 03:08:32,611
I'm like,

7349
03:08:32,611 --> 03:08:32,821
all right,

7350
03:08:32,821 --> 03:08:33,441
do your thing girl.

7351
03:08:33,441 --> 03:08:36,540
And she missed it by seven fucking pounds.

7352
03:08:36,541 --> 03:08:36,751
Man.

7353
03:08:36,751 --> 03:08:37,800
That's so big.

7354
03:08:37,830 --> 03:08:39,120
That means it doesn't drain her.

7355
03:08:39,380 --> 03:08:40,320
So when she goes to anybody,

7356
03:08:40,330 --> 03:08:41,460
that's a huge advantage.

7357
03:08:41,480 --> 03:08:41,670
Yeah.

7358
03:08:41,670 --> 03:08:42,451
She goes to fight.

7359
03:08:42,451 --> 03:08:43,850
She's not drained out huge.

7360
03:08:44,120 --> 03:08:45,840
That Mackenzie dern fight.

7361
03:08:45,870 --> 03:08:46,591
Holy Shit.

7362
03:08:46,591 --> 03:08:48,810
That was like some UFC two type shit.

7363
03:08:49,050 --> 03:08:51,150
She took that check down mountain her,

7364
03:08:51,490 --> 03:08:52,400
she soccer.

7365
03:08:53,730 --> 03:08:54,361
It was like that.

7366
03:08:54,361 --> 03:08:56,190
It was like a hoist versus uh,

7367
03:08:56,580 --> 03:08:57,300
that uh,

7368
03:08:57,300 --> 03:09:00,210
that Dutch kickboxer with the g pants,

7369
03:09:00,300 --> 03:09:01,380
which she got a crap.

7370
03:09:01,520 --> 03:09:05,060
But her striking was the impressive
thing cause she landed a bunch overhand

7371
03:09:05,400 --> 03:09:06,030
black.

7372
03:09:06,030 --> 03:09:06,863
She does.

7373
03:09:07,260 --> 03:09:08,130
She has big,

7374
03:09:08,160 --> 03:09:10,800
she's not afraid to throw
down Mackenzie fan man.

7375
03:09:10,970 --> 03:09:12,300
She's got giant balls.

7376
03:09:12,301 --> 03:09:13,820
Her ground game is so high.

7377
03:09:14,340 --> 03:09:15,630
She went scrape through that.

7378
03:09:15,720 --> 03:09:17,160
It looked like that chick never trained.

7379
03:09:17,250 --> 03:09:17,670
She looked,

7380
03:09:17,670 --> 03:09:19,410
she looked too thick though that fight.

7381
03:09:19,440 --> 03:09:20,280
She didn't like it.

7382
03:09:21,270 --> 03:09:21,990
I like sick.

7383
03:09:21,990 --> 03:09:22,711
But then there's like,

7384
03:09:22,711 --> 03:09:23,191
damn girl,

7385
03:09:23,191 --> 03:09:23,640
you need to,

7386
03:09:23,640 --> 03:09:24,870
we need a little pride here.

7387
03:09:24,960 --> 03:09:26,940
She said to the way she's dressed,

7388
03:09:27,070 --> 03:09:29,360
if she was in a miniskirt
with a halter top,

7389
03:09:29,370 --> 03:09:30,870
don't get a twist and I'm on board,

7390
03:09:30,871 --> 03:09:31,201
whatever.

7391
03:09:31,201 --> 03:09:31,650
She went,

7392
03:09:31,650 --> 03:09:34,410
I'm just saying that like the love
handles are spilling over the top and like

7393
03:09:34,411 --> 03:09:34,711
all right,

7394
03:09:34,711 --> 03:09:37,140
now it gets a little thick sometimes.

7395
03:09:37,141 --> 03:09:37,974
I like that.

7396
03:09:38,250 --> 03:09:39,150
I'm not mad at it,

7397
03:09:39,151 --> 03:09:40,610
but it just looks better.

7398
03:09:41,220 --> 03:09:43,350
It's all depends on how much
ask goes with the package.

7399
03:09:43,860 --> 03:09:44,693
You're right.

7400
03:09:44,720 --> 03:09:45,150
The front,

7401
03:09:45,150 --> 03:09:46,350
the front to back ratio.

7402
03:09:46,710 --> 03:09:47,543
It depends.

7403
03:09:47,970 --> 03:09:48,151
See,

7404
03:09:48,151 --> 03:09:48,984
this is why,

7405
03:09:49,170 --> 03:09:53,070
this is why we can't be
on ESPN or Fox fire me.

7406
03:09:53,200 --> 03:09:54,033
Good

7407
03:09:54,290 --> 03:09:54,841
fire me.

7408
03:09:54,841 --> 03:09:56,860
I dare you not even saying that.

7409
03:09:56,861 --> 03:09:58,840
Just make me just do the paper views.

7410
03:09:58,841 --> 03:09:59,674
I'm fine with that.

7411
03:09:59,860 --> 03:10:00,440
That's all you doing,

7412
03:10:00,440 --> 03:10:00,700
you know?

7413
03:10:00,700 --> 03:10:01,170
Oh well you,

7414
03:10:01,170 --> 03:10:01,840
no,

7415
03:10:01,840 --> 03:10:04,150
I do the previews to the prelims.

7416
03:10:05,320 --> 03:10:06,550
Ah,

7417
03:10:06,560 --> 03:10:09,670
well I want to have Latino cause well I
guess it would just the contract comes

7418
03:10:09,671 --> 03:10:11,770
over like does everyone
like the UFC tonight,

7419
03:10:11,771 --> 03:10:11,951
crew,

7420
03:10:11,951 --> 03:10:14,220
everyone's I've seen.

7421
03:10:14,230 --> 03:10:15,490
I was never working for Fox.

7422
03:10:15,520 --> 03:10:16,510
I didn't do the fire.

7423
03:10:16,540 --> 03:10:17,350
It was one of my,

7424
03:10:17,350 --> 03:10:18,190
one of these days,

7425
03:10:19,210 --> 03:10:21,240
but one of the stipulations
of my newer contract,

7426
03:10:21,241 --> 03:10:21,380
I said,

7427
03:10:21,380 --> 03:10:22,870
I don't want to do the Fox events anymore.

7428
03:10:22,900 --> 03:10:25,540
And that deals through when
you don't have to be done.

7429
03:10:25,810 --> 03:10:26,351
It's already done.

7430
03:10:26,351 --> 03:10:27,910
I mean it was a bit like this year.

7431
03:10:27,911 --> 03:10:29,380
I don't do any of the Fox events.

7432
03:10:29,381 --> 03:10:31,640
If you notice like when there
are big fights on [inaudible].

7433
03:10:31,670 --> 03:10:33,010
I know you don't do any of them.

7434
03:10:33,010 --> 03:10:33,531
I'm not even done.

7435
03:10:33,531 --> 03:10:34,150
The big ones.

7436
03:10:34,150 --> 03:10:34,540
Nope.

7437
03:10:34,540 --> 03:10:37,450
None of them zero paper if
he's still doing it right.

7438
03:10:37,460 --> 03:10:38,340
Do you want to do anymore?

7439
03:10:38,410 --> 03:10:39,100
Too much work?

7440
03:10:39,100 --> 03:10:41,390
Too much work did,

7441
03:10:41,480 --> 03:10:43,960
this seems is not a big deal because
they have the suit there for me,

7442
03:10:43,990 --> 03:10:44,690
but the,

7443
03:10:44,690 --> 03:10:48,190
my issue was a fox actually
paid me less money,

7444
03:10:48,520 --> 03:10:50,180
less money to do the fence on Fox,

7445
03:10:50,181 --> 03:10:50,651
but I was like,

7446
03:10:50,651 --> 03:10:51,880
you guys are never paying you.

7447
03:10:52,180 --> 03:10:52,421
Yeah,

7448
03:10:52,421 --> 03:10:53,620
I thought the UFC pagan.

7449
03:10:53,770 --> 03:10:53,951
No,

7450
03:10:53,951 --> 03:10:54,910
I get to Fox event.

7451
03:10:54,911 --> 03:10:55,744
It's a Fox event.

7452
03:10:56,200 --> 03:10:56,741
So,

7453
03:10:56,741 --> 03:10:57,460
um,

7454
03:10:57,460 --> 03:10:58,120
that,

7455
03:10:58,120 --> 03:10:59,500
but it was also,

7456
03:10:59,860 --> 03:11:02,500
I didn't like when I first
started doing it for them,

7457
03:11:03,160 --> 03:11:06,040
they got in my ear like the
very first events for Fox.

7458
03:11:06,370 --> 03:11:07,780
They were like telling me what to do.

7459
03:11:07,960 --> 03:11:10,600
They were like telling me
to take it down a notch,

7460
03:11:10,601 --> 03:11:12,280
don't be so amped up about that.

7461
03:11:12,281 --> 03:11:13,180
Yay.

7462
03:11:13,240 --> 03:11:13,871
And I was like,

7463
03:11:13,871 --> 03:11:14,260
what?

7464
03:11:14,260 --> 03:11:15,093
What are we doing here?

7465
03:11:15,100 --> 03:11:15,371
I go,

7466
03:11:15,371 --> 03:11:16,060
listen,

7467
03:11:16,060 --> 03:11:17,200
I do commentary.

7468
03:11:17,230 --> 03:11:17,801
This is what I do.

7469
03:11:17,801 --> 03:11:18,760
I've been doing it forever.

7470
03:11:19,030 --> 03:11:19,870
This is how I do it.

7471
03:11:19,900 --> 03:11:21,850
If you think you can change me,

7472
03:11:22,090 --> 03:11:23,350
then we're not going to work together.

7473
03:11:23,410 --> 03:11:23,731
I'm like,

7474
03:11:23,731 --> 03:11:25,150
we had what a real problem.

7475
03:11:25,180 --> 03:11:25,930
And that was a flop.

7476
03:11:25,930 --> 03:11:26,500
Seduction,

7477
03:11:26,500 --> 03:11:27,160
right Joe?

7478
03:11:27,160 --> 03:11:27,451
Yes.

7479
03:11:27,451 --> 03:11:28,360
It was a fox productions.

7480
03:11:28,370 --> 03:11:32,770
That's the junior dos
Santos Cain Velasquez upon.

7481
03:11:32,800 --> 03:11:33,011
Yeah.

7482
03:11:33,011 --> 03:11:34,110
I believe that was the first one.

7483
03:11:34,220 --> 03:11:34,480
Yeah.

7484
03:11:34,480 --> 03:11:35,313
But it's just,

7485
03:11:36,280 --> 03:11:36,910
I just didn't,

7486
03:11:36,910 --> 03:11:37,720
I didn't like it.

7487
03:11:37,720 --> 03:11:39,280
They want a sports guy.

7488
03:11:39,310 --> 03:11:39,730
Like,

7489
03:11:39,730 --> 03:11:40,120
look,

7490
03:11:40,120 --> 03:11:41,890
MMA is what it is.

7491
03:11:41,950 --> 03:11:42,221
It's,

7492
03:11:42,221 --> 03:11:43,054
it's fighting.

7493
03:11:43,120 --> 03:11:47,680
It is a very specific kind of sport
and I've been doing it the way I do it

7494
03:11:47,681 --> 03:11:47,921
forever.

7495
03:11:47,921 --> 03:11:49,120
If you don't like the way I do it,

7496
03:11:49,121 --> 03:11:49,661
that's fine.

7497
03:11:49,661 --> 03:11:50,494
Don't hire me,

7498
03:11:50,560 --> 03:11:53,680
but don't try to get me
to become some sports guy.

7499
03:11:53,681 --> 03:11:55,120
I'm not interested in that at all.

7500
03:11:55,150 --> 03:11:56,380
When I commentated for pride,

7501
03:11:56,381 --> 03:11:56,801
they told me,

7502
03:11:56,801 --> 03:11:57,101
I said,

7503
03:11:57,101 --> 03:11:57,551
Nice.

7504
03:11:57,551 --> 03:11:58,384
Too much.

7505
03:11:59,450 --> 03:12:00,640
No say Nice.

7506
03:12:00,710 --> 03:12:01,090
He was like,

7507
03:12:01,090 --> 03:12:01,923
no,

7508
03:12:01,970 --> 03:12:03,130
you couldn't even speak English.

7509
03:12:05,590 --> 03:12:05,891
I think.

7510
03:12:05,891 --> 03:12:06,724
Nice Shot,

7511
03:12:06,940 --> 03:12:07,840
Nice Jab.

7512
03:12:07,870 --> 03:12:08,531
To their credit,

7513
03:12:08,531 --> 03:12:09,011
they stopped.

7514
03:12:09,011 --> 03:12:11,200
They stopped doing it
after the first event.

7515
03:12:11,201 --> 03:12:13,120
When I voiced my displeasure,

7516
03:12:13,180 --> 03:12:15,650
I just let them know like
really clearly this isn't,

7517
03:12:15,700 --> 03:12:16,750
we're not going to doing this.

7518
03:12:16,930 --> 03:12:20,850
I'm not going to change how I do it to
make you do this if I'm helping you.

7519
03:12:20,990 --> 03:12:22,120
It's not even that.

7520
03:12:22,121 --> 03:12:24,460
It's just like if you
don't like the way I do it,

7521
03:12:24,490 --> 03:12:29,440
this is not an option for you to direct
me and tell me to do it the way you like

7522
03:12:29,441 --> 03:12:31,450
it because you think that that's better.

7523
03:12:31,540 --> 03:12:34,150
This is a personal choice by one or two.

7524
03:12:34,151 --> 03:12:36,970
Whoever the fuck the people were
that were producers or executives,

7525
03:12:37,210 --> 03:12:40,330
I don't agree with them and
I'm not doing it that way.

7526
03:12:40,390 --> 03:12:41,350
Like this is just how it,

7527
03:12:42,030 --> 03:12:43,120
it's like real simple.

7528
03:12:43,121 --> 03:12:46,510
Like if you bought a Ferrari and
it had a certain sound to it,

7529
03:12:46,511 --> 03:12:46,751
you're like,

7530
03:12:46,751 --> 03:12:46,991
man,

7531
03:12:46,991 --> 03:12:48,100
I don't like this sound.

7532
03:12:48,101 --> 03:12:51,260
Can you guys go back to the
factory and fix these mufflers?

7533
03:12:51,261 --> 03:12:51,860
They'd be like,

7534
03:12:51,860 --> 03:12:52,040
what

7535
03:12:52,040 --> 03:12:52,200
do you,

7536
03:12:52,200 --> 03:12:53,033
hi,

7537
03:12:53,180 --> 03:12:54,750
this is what a Ferrari is like.

7538
03:12:54,770 --> 03:12:56,870
This is you don't like it
then you like Ferrari's.

7539
03:12:56,900 --> 03:12:57,050
No,

7540
03:12:57,050 --> 03:12:57,111
no,

7541
03:12:57,111 --> 03:12:57,410
no.

7542
03:12:57,410 --> 03:12:58,250
I like it for a ride,

7543
03:12:58,251 --> 03:13:00,740
but I want it to sound like
a Corolla doesn't work.

7544
03:13:00,800 --> 03:13:01,131
They'd be like,

7545
03:13:01,131 --> 03:13:01,780
no,

7546
03:13:01,780 --> 03:13:02,010
no,

7547
03:13:02,010 --> 03:13:04,010
you'd probably a bad analogy.

7548
03:13:04,011 --> 03:13:06,230
But the idea behind it you get,

7549
03:13:06,260 --> 03:13:07,010
I'm not,

7550
03:13:07,010 --> 03:13:07,830
this is what I do.

7551
03:13:07,830 --> 03:13:10,960
Like I get amped up if
some shit is going down,

7552
03:13:10,970 --> 03:13:13,370
these guys were throwing
blows and I'm screaming.

7553
03:13:13,460 --> 03:13:16,340
It's because I feel that with
some would call it passion.

7554
03:13:16,370 --> 03:13:16,590
Yeah,

7555
03:13:16,590 --> 03:13:17,121
it's bullets.

7556
03:13:17,121 --> 03:13:18,100
Legitimate Passion.

7557
03:13:18,101 --> 03:13:18,650
I'm not,

7558
03:13:18,650 --> 03:13:19,580
I'm not faking it,

7559
03:13:19,610 --> 03:13:21,050
but they didn't want that.

7560
03:13:22,310 --> 03:13:23,540
But they let it go after awhile,

7561
03:13:23,570 --> 03:13:26,060
but it's not like they fought
for me when I quit either.

7562
03:13:26,300 --> 03:13:27,980
How long has the Reebok deal for?

7563
03:13:28,520 --> 03:13:29,400
Uh,

7564
03:13:29,870 --> 03:13:30,441
three years.

7565
03:13:30,441 --> 03:13:31,640
I think three years.

7566
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:32,660
Two to three years.

7567
03:13:32,660 --> 03:13:35,180
I wonder if it worked out for Reebok,

7568
03:13:35,181 --> 03:13:36,014
like his Reebok.

7569
03:13:36,110 --> 03:13:38,000
Reebok exploding now because of this.

7570
03:13:38,780 --> 03:13:39,141
Well,

7571
03:13:39,141 --> 03:13:39,851
Adidas zones,

7572
03:13:39,851 --> 03:13:41,510
Reebok to Adidas is killing it,

7573
03:13:41,511 --> 03:13:41,900
but I dunno,

7574
03:13:41,900 --> 03:13:43,100
free box exploding.

7575
03:13:43,101 --> 03:13:43,280
They,

7576
03:13:43,280 --> 03:13:44,091
they're the niche,

7577
03:13:44,091 --> 03:13:44,361
right?

7578
03:13:44,361 --> 03:13:45,081
The MMA,

7579
03:13:45,081 --> 03:13:46,640
the in with crossfit.

7580
03:13:46,820 --> 03:13:50,030
So they're in that world
until Reebok's defense.

7581
03:13:50,320 --> 03:13:50,760
You know,

7582
03:13:50,760 --> 03:13:50,960
they,

7583
03:13:50,960 --> 03:13:51,860
they made the offer,

7584
03:13:51,890 --> 03:13:52,730
they don't know.

7585
03:13:52,760 --> 03:13:54,380
They didn't know what the deal was.

7586
03:13:54,381 --> 03:13:55,940
They know they are screwing over fighters.

7587
03:13:55,941 --> 03:13:57,380
It's more of a UFC thing.

7588
03:13:57,750 --> 03:13:59,320
It was not Reebok Reebok,

7589
03:13:59,321 --> 03:14:00,080
it's like Whoa,

7590
03:14:00,080 --> 03:14:00,890
what the fuck.

7591
03:14:00,890 --> 03:14:04,610
It seemed like even the UFC wasn't
aware of how much fight is for actually

7592
03:14:04,611 --> 03:14:06,560
making off of sponsorships.

7593
03:14:06,980 --> 03:14:10,530
I mean you and I know that there was
some debate as to whether or not,

7594
03:14:10,930 --> 03:14:11,720
I mean they just,

7595
03:14:11,720 --> 03:14:16,280
they had a distorted perception of how
much some fighters were making and they

7596
03:14:16,281 --> 03:14:17,081
just think they killed,

7597
03:14:17,081 --> 03:14:20,180
I think they talked to maybe
the top 10 guys and we're like,

7598
03:14:20,181 --> 03:14:20,780
hey,

7599
03:14:20,780 --> 03:14:21,710
we're going pay you this.

7600
03:14:21,710 --> 03:14:23,030
We will take care of you in this way.

7601
03:14:23,031 --> 03:14:25,420
And then the rest of the
guys get on board and they,

7602
03:14:25,430 --> 03:14:26,263
you know,

7603
03:14:26,480 --> 03:14:26,751
but,

7604
03:14:26,751 --> 03:14:27,440
but again,

7605
03:14:27,440 --> 03:14:28,340
I get it man,

7606
03:14:28,341 --> 03:14:28,910
if I'm Dana,

7607
03:14:28,910 --> 03:14:33,080
I'm not making decisions based
off those 10 to 15 top guys.

7608
03:14:33,100 --> 03:14:33,700
I'll make my,

7609
03:14:33,700 --> 03:14:33,850
my,

7610
03:14:33,850 --> 03:14:36,560
my decisions that's going
to affect my bottom line.

7611
03:14:36,770 --> 03:14:38,030
And one was just what they did.

7612
03:14:38,031 --> 03:14:43,031
One judge and the pain fight gave every
round and Jason Knight One judge did

7613
03:14:43,761 --> 03:14:44,541
look at it like you,

7614
03:14:44,541 --> 03:14:46,820
like he was on his back and
he didn't get taken down,

7615
03:14:47,120 --> 03:14:48,890
but he was the one that was
aggressive on the ground.

7616
03:14:48,950 --> 03:14:49,731
I agree with that.

7617
03:14:49,731 --> 03:14:53,800
I don't think you just take it twice down
and have one thing you do and then be

7618
03:14:53,801 --> 03:14:54,634
in control.

7619
03:14:54,890 --> 03:14:56,150
It's just been educated.

7620
03:14:56,660 --> 03:14:57,200
Yeah,

7621
03:14:57,200 --> 03:14:58,190
I could get out of here soon.

7622
03:14:58,200 --> 03:15:00,260
Boy Sets wrap her up.

7623
03:15:00,290 --> 03:15:00,710
Uh,

7624
03:15:00,710 --> 03:15:01,580
Eddie Bravo.

7625
03:15:01,581 --> 03:15:06,581
Tell everybody you're a tinfoil hat
comedy at Cobb's Friday this Friday at

7626
03:15:06,951 --> 03:15:08,020
cobb's in San Francisco,

7627
03:15:08,040 --> 03:15:10,100
Saturday in Sacramento.

7628
03:15:10,690 --> 03:15:11,523
What are you doing on slot?

7629
03:15:11,630 --> 03:15:13,150
The punchline sacrament of that play.

7630
03:15:13,290 --> 03:15:14,350
And then I'm at the ice.

7631
03:15:14,420 --> 03:15:19,070
I'm at the Ice House on the
15th June 15th of the Ice House.

7632
03:15:19,071 --> 03:15:19,701
One show only.

7633
03:15:19,701 --> 03:15:20,930
And then I'm in Houston,

7634
03:15:20,931 --> 03:15:21,764
Houston Improv,

Bye.

Awesome.
