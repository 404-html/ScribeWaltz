1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Three,

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,300
two one.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:05,941
Bam.

4
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:06,541
We live,

5
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,010
we got up early as a motherfucker,

6
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:08,844
ladies and gentlemen.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,833
Not really.

8
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,160
It's 10:00 AM.

9
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,210
What did we do one at like 4:00 AM
before we did want at 5:00 AM for it.

10
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,760
Was it for,

11
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,840
it was a a is a England card,

12
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:19,380
right?

13
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,100
Was it something [inaudible] or something?

14
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,840
Congo and might've been,

15
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,590
it might've been trying to get China
like what time is in Africa right now?

16
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,783
Is it yesterday?

17
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,180
I think it's ahead.

18
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,200
Stay man.

19
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,863
Just,

20
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,730
I forgot he knocked out Whitaker.

21
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:43,950
We're looking at Wonderboy
stop and Whitaker.

22
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:44,450
That's,

23
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:44,771
yeah,

24
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:45,230
that's,

25
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,260
that's 70 yeah,

26
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:46,920
but that was,

27
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,810
Whitaker was diminished man.

28
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,930
Getting down to one 70 was
a fucking battle for him.

29
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:54,180
Do you look at Wonderboy
w what he's accomplished?

30
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:55,300
It's so impressive.

31
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,650
All the indicators would point that
Wonderboy should win this fight,

32
00:00:58,651 --> 00:00:59,110
but I don't,

33
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,030
I'm on the fence,

34
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:00,660
man.

35
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,051
Well,

36
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:03,240
I think till really is a bad,

37
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,230
bad man.

38
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,460
There's no question about it.

39
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:09,150
But he did come up real
short on the way in,

40
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:10,680
which really bums me out.

41
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,490
Now I had heard that his
pregnant girlfriend is in.

42
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:18,540
This is what everyone's saying is in
the hospital and that she's had some

43
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:23,130
serious issues and he's been going back
and forth to the hospital and he hasn't

44
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,620
just didn't have a
chance to cut the weight.

45
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:26,300
Right.

46
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,760
A lot of people claim you know that.

47
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,690
That's exactly what the,

48
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:31,411
what the issue was.

49
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't know that drama is never good.

50
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,190
Especially your first main card,

51
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,490
main event in your
hometown against Wonderboy.

52
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,020
There's enough pressure as it is.

53
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,210
Well the cowboy five was
a big pressure fight,

54
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:43,290
but he rose to the occasion.

55
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,731
Was it?

56
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:48,360
Cause we didn't know who he was really
haven't is this opportunity for sure,

57
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:49,630
but you're fighting a smaller guy.

58
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,550
Skins cowboy,

59
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:50,881
you know,

60
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:52,620
so he goes forward and does work.

61
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,690
Now it's like man,

62
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,270
I mean there's been guys who
have blown up before but the,

63
00:01:57,271 --> 00:02:00,180
the hype on till and
I'm all up on his dick.

64
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,051
But you know,

65
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:02,250
there's a ton of hype on it.

66
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:03,210
If you went into this one,

67
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,500
it's off to the races.

68
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:04,951
It is,

69
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:07,650
but he's fucking four and a
half pounds over championship.

70
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:08,041
Wait,

71
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,000
that is a lot.

72
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,841
That's not a little,

73
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:10,740
that's a lot.

74
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,690
It's such an advantage to fighters to
have missed weight are undefeated this

75
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:15,780
year.

76
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,521
When they feel fight,

77
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:17,354
they're undefeated.

78
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:17,551
Yeah,

79
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:18,570
it's a big advantage.

80
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:22,170
I think that was one cheating if
you do it on purpose for sure.

81
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,210
I think what's interesting
with Wonderboy dead,

82
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,000
he said you've got to weigh
one 88 the next day type move.

83
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,950
Big Boy.

84
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,250
Yeah.

85
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,540
It kills a really big boy.

86
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,050
Very,

87
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,800
very smart.

88
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,550
Like whatever advantage that he got from
not cutting that extra three pounds,

89
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,190
you know,

90
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,620
and now he's a three and a half pounds.

91
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,730
Now he's um,

92
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,130
you know,

93
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,080
lost a little bit of it.

94
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:42,270
I guess if you're Wonderboy though,

95
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,040
you want to drag this into later rounds,

96
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,251
you know,

97
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,360
he's gonna come out aggressive,

98
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:45,571
you know,

99
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:47,070
he said some drama,

100
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:50,280
cutting weight and he had this cut
more weight to maintain it the day,

101
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,271
the day of.

102
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,060
So yeah,

103
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,210
it's all fascinating,

104
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:54,510
man.

105
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,290
So fascinating.

106
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,280
We're going to find out a lot.

107
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,241
The other thing is too,

108
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,200
the styles,

109
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,400
like what Wonderboy does

110
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,320
is a kicking distance.

111
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,050
Like if you watch like the
exchanges that he's at,

112
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,570
he moves real good at the waist,

113
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,291
like a snake,

114
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,220
like back and forth.

115
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,150
But he wants to keep you not
even at Moitai taking distance.

116
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,100
He keeps you at karate kick distance,

117
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:18,730
far sideways at very
far more self to reach.

118
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,410
Dan's got to close that gap and closing
that gap is when Wonderboy is the most

119
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:23,891
dangerous.

120
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:25,570
And if you see some of
his training footage,

121
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,640
he seems to be concentrating on
blitzing in and lent and countering and

122
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:32,260
sidestepping and countering.

123
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:32,541
Yeah,

124
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,374
we can hear the door.

125
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:33,850
Yeah.

126
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,530
If you look at Wonderboy is history.

127
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,270
Whenever he fights aggressive dudes,

128
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,040
they get fucked up.

129
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,401
Yeah.

130
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:43,900
That's like he's still that Scott
wants and that's what till wants to do.

131
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,471
Yeah.

132
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,060
That's very interesting.

133
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,360
I'm telling him that if nothing in the
slight would surprise me unless Dan until

134
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:51,430
just goes out there and
just murdered sexism.

135
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,790
Just no respect merge.

136
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,220
And that's the only thing
that would surprise me.

137
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,630
But if till does win strap a fucking
rocket ship that boys back cause in other

138
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,150
Bisping's retired UK,

139
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:00,410
neat.

140
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:00,881
The face.

141
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:02,740
That's him that he's the fucking guy,

142
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:03,130
man.

143
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:03,970
Even if he loses,

144
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:06,160
he could still be that he's 25 years old.

145
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:06,461
Yeah,

146
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,600
but not to that extent.

147
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,980
You know like you beat Wonderboy
and you knock out Wonderboy.

148
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,960
It's fucking [inaudible] man.

149
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,510
He's a super talented striker though.

150
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:17,920
What he did to cowboy,

151
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,600
it wasn't just impressive.

152
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,780
It was like complete domination to
moralize just controlled the range.

153
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,360
He controlled every single
aspect of the exchange is cowboy.

154
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:31,560
Got like one good knee
off at one point in time,

155
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:33,610
but that was in one good
right hand to the body.

156
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,280
I rewatched the fight the other day
just to kind of get amped up about

157
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,110
oppressive.

158
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:38,471
Oh my.

159
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:39,670
He obliterated them.

160
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,960
That's the thing too about till I think
it's so much hype is a lot of guys like

161
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,730
Colby Covington is amazing,

162
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,480
talented fighter.

163
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,950
There's a lot of guys talk a lot of stuff.

164
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:48,191
I'm like,

165
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:48,401
all right,

166
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:49,240
it's more of an act.

167
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,313
They're super talented.

168
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,640
When Darren till talks,

169
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:52,300
my God,

170
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,800
it's almost that Conor McGregor effect.

171
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:54,040
I'm like,

172
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,731
I bought this full,

173
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:55,960
actually believes it.

174
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,490
He believes it and he was ridiculous
skills and it's going to go a long ways.

175
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,670
It chipra your tank there.

176
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,090
There's me know Jujitsu in this.

177
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:04,720
Eddie,

178
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,620
no digits.

179
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:05,930
All,

180
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,060
I'll ain't goes to the ground.

181
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,340
We're all I know about Darren till his,

182
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,900
his fight with Serone.

183
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:11,734
That's it.

184
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,083
This card.

185
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:13,960
Uh,

186
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,500
you know,

187
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:14,741
it's,

188
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:15,490
um,

189
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,330
it's going to be interesting.

190
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,130
I don't really know who we're going to
have Gunnar Nelson on the card though.

191
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,380
He's going to announce it on the car.

192
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:20,681
No,

193
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:21,251
he got hurt.

194
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:22,120
But you don't have Gunnar Nelson.

195
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:22,631
Neil Magna,

196
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:23,171
which was a fun,

197
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:23,431
fun.

198
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:24,310
It's a great fight.

199
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,230
They were going to do Gunnar Nelson until,

200
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:28,190
but for whatever reason they
decided to go with Wonderboy.

201
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,291
Jason Knight,

202
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:29,621
I know,

203
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,454
I know about him.

204
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,070
Did he already fight on the daughters
on the main card and he's on the main

205
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:33,420
card.

206
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:33,821
Beautiful.

207
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:34,030
Who is,

208
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,863
he's a tough fight.

209
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,723
Um,

210
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,610
um,

211
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:36,821
like,

212
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:37,330
uh,

213
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:37,690
uh,

214
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,523
here's a tough fight.

215
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,543
Very tough fight.

216
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:40,810
Oh,

217
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,171
Connie?

218
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:41,361
Yeah,

219
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:42,040
he's a monster.

220
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,380
Connie.

221
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:42,850
Yeah.

222
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,750
The Japanese guy.

223
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,100
No,

224
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,570
no.

225
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,260
And he's,

226
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:45,430
well,

227
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,510
he lives in Finland,

228
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,381
but uh,

229
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,820
what is his background?

230
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,863
He's a

231
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:51,963
Dan.

232
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,170
He's a really good wrestler
who also has wild ass strikes.

233
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:58,160
Mouth find super tough fight for your boy.

234
00:05:58,161 --> 00:05:58,640
Yeah.

235
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,473
Yeah.

236
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,580
Lila Magni who's Neil and magnified
now for wonder boy though there's not,

237
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,420
there's not a ton of upside.

238
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,940
I don't know why he took it to be honest.

239
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:11,960
Why?

240
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,070
It's a good matchup for him,

241
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:13,820
but yeah,

242
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,601
it's you're,

243
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,460
you're in dangerous territory,

244
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:16,701
right?

245
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,750
You're fighting the number nine guy.

246
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:18,740
You ranked number one,

247
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,210
he missed his weight.

248
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,380
He's huge.

249
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,393
Like there's just,

250
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,680
I feel like all the pressure's
off Wonderboy right now,

251
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:25,850
especially after he missed and weight.

252
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,803
But I just,

253
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,220
if you're Wonderboy and even if you
starch till they're not giving you a title

254
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:33,500
shot until Woodley loses that strap.

255
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,980
Wonderboy is not fighting for a
title 14 two and one for wonder.

256
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:38,181
Boy.

257
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:41,980
You got to remember the only loss
those to Tyron Woodley and then two,

258
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:43,340
I'm Matt Brown.

259
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,520
Those two fights and
one draw with Woodley.

260
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,493
Crazy.

261
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,260
That's why couldn't if I would be again,

262
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,213
they fought.

263
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,300
Well that's the,

264
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:54,410
that's what he's asking.

265
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:54,861
First of all,

266
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:55,281
he's saying,

267
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,470
why don't I get a shot
at the interim title?

268
00:06:57,471 --> 00:07:01,130
How are you giving the interim title
to Colby Covington who only beat Damien

269
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:01,131
Maia,

270
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:02,270
who's 40 years old,

271
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,770
who's was clearly past his prime.

272
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,101
How is,

273
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:08,040
how is that good enough to get
him a shot at the interim title?

274
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,200
And I talked a lot of shit.

275
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,160
That's it.

276
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,401
Yeah,

277
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:11,390
there you go basically yet.

278
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,490
But it goes along way the same time.

279
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:13,731
Yeah.

280
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:14,840
It goes a long way this day and age,

281
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:16,340
but at the same time with Rda,

282
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,920
you know they're not doing Colby
and he favors send them down to,

283
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:19,420
oh no,

284
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:19,731
I'm sorry.

285
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,600
It's in Chicago.

286
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,490
Chicago to fight RDA,

287
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:23,240
which is,

288
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,470
if you look at Colby style,

289
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,300
it's probably the worst matchup for him.

290
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,830
He's a heavy underdog,

291
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,661
so I'm,

292
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:28,881
I'm,

293
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:29,714
I'm hoping,

294
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,441
not hoping.

295
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,760
I think what their plan would be,

296
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:33,770
Rda wins that fights Woodley,

297
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:37,970
which is tough matchup for Woodley
and the Rda were able to beat Woodley.

298
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:43,030
Then you have Wonderboy slip in there
or Colby wins and then you got mad shit

299
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:46,220
talking with him and Woodley
and it gets very interesting.

300
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,100
Get super intellect that fight going to
fire me and Tyron a Colby has done or

301
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:52,520
dog in every one of those fights.

302
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,210
Yes.

303
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,200
But Rda Woodley,

304
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:54,861
you got a barn,

305
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:55,440
burn your hands.

306
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,510
That's a great matchup.

307
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,373
Yeah.

308
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,771
Rda.

309
00:07:57,771 --> 00:08:00,860
Woodley's very interesting
cause cause as much as as they,

310
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,350
you know,

311
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,310
I love woodland.

312
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:03,440
I think his style is ridiculous.

313
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,400
He's gonna be tough to beat.

314
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,241
You know,

315
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,840
I think they want some bit
of turnover in their ugly.

316
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,870
That's what they want.

317
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:09,704
Some turnover.

318
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,730
What does RDA going to do with
two Woodley and then he can't,

319
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,940
he's not going to ever take him down.

320
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:14,490
No.

321
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,660
He's the only thing he's got striking
his striking and his movements.

322
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:18,000
Good.

323
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,230
And then if it does go to the,

324
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,260
to the ground and his kicks,

325
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,080
that's a tough one to beat for anybody.

326
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:24,330
Yeah.

327
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,370
Even as striking,

328
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,380
even RDA striking Woodley has,

329
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll put you to sleep instantly.

330
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:29,541
Striking.

331
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,620
What has more power?

332
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:32,810
Rda has better fundamentals,

333
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:34,900
I would say as far as
putting it more type,

334
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:35,610
run it together.

335
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,370
Kids feed the power and the explosives,

336
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,490
Goddamn nightmare.

337
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,960
It's still the favorite in the fight.

338
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:44,300
It's not going to the ground
and what he wants it to.

339
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,100
Woodley just got through shoulder surgery.

340
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,200
He just got his Labor and repaired,

341
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,520
which is not the worst shoulder
surgery and he does that mean exactly.

342
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:54,890
Stapled the Labor on labor.

343
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,040
Now the Labor,

344
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,310
um,

345
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,730
uh,

346
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,290
he had some sort of a tear in it that it,

347
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,230
that fucked up in the Damien
Maia fight like insulin.

348
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,670
They stitch it back together again,

349
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:05,970
but he's gone through crazy PRP
and all kinds of other shit now.

350
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:10,971
He put up a video of him hitting mitts
and it's only been about three months

351
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:13,230
since the surgery and he's hitting me.

352
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:13,950
It's hard.

353
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,720
I don't know if that's
an old video though.

354
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,554
He's sneaky.

355
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:17,740
You know,

356
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,840
he put up this video.

357
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,950
He's a free ham doe.

358
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:20,401
He might,

359
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:21,080
he might be doing,

360
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,913
you know,

361
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,940
who definitely got some injections.

362
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,730
He was talking about all the different
things that he's going to do for as far

363
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:26,960
as their,

364
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,900
he came on the podcast just a few weeks
after shoulder surgery and he was moving

365
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:33,120
around normal and moving
his hands around normal.

366
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,400
But it really depends
entirely on how bad this is.

367
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,130
The big one is the bicep tendon.

368
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,730
When the bicep tendon gets torn
off the muscle off the bone,

369
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,380
and then they have to put it back in,

370
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,840
stapled down everywhere.

371
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,481
And then they have to,

372
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:46,800
it does work right now.

373
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,690
Now does not for pitchers.

374
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,030
If you're a pitcher
and that shit go south,

375
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:51,841
you're digging,

376
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,470
he done.

377
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,400
But for a fighter,

378
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,150
no problem.

379
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,620
It doesn't seem to be
a problem for fighters.

380
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,551
But I bet Woodley.

381
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:57,660
So you got RDA,

382
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,500
Colby.

383
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,920
So the obviously the winter that
will fight Woodley end of the year.

384
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,030
Will it be back in the year?

385
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:03,720
No doubt.

386
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,051
Yeah.

387
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,990
It could very well be on
the December 31st card.

388
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:07,290
You know,

389
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,070
that's a big one.

390
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,680
Huge Guide.

391
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,180
Uh,

392
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,571
you know,

393
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:13,290
I mean I think they were trying to talk
about him being on the August card in

394
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:13,801
la,

395
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:15,150
but that's not going to happen soon.

396
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:15,600
Yeah,

397
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,520
that's a damn good card right now.

398
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:18,000
Right?

399
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,290
La is who do they,

400
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:19,680
isn't it?

401
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:19,980
Whose are,

402
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,750
they were willing for
GSP nae and I'll say,

403
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:22,620
that's not happening.

404
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:23,940
So what do you,

405
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:25,050
who do you have now in la?

406
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,800
Let's see.

407
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,790
Let's pull that up.

408
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:27,600
Did they put,

409
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,820
do they find a opponent for Xy beat?

410
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,220
This is going to be at staples.

411
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,030
Yeah.

412
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:38,030
Well they want to do cyborg versus
Nunez not happening in a suspended,

413
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,390
is she?

414
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:39,810
Yeah.

415
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,643
What's your hurt?

416
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,640
Uh,

417
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,280
her hands from whooping
that ass whooping that ass.

418
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,503
Damn.

419
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,501
Oh yeah.

420
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:47,550
Tj and Cody.

421
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,450
Ooh,

422
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,363
okay.

423
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,540
Yeah.

424
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:51,721
Oh,

425
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:52,411
a very cards.

426
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:52,900
Not,

427
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,280
no.

428
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,910
It's a little bit of
Struggle Street right now.

429
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,460
Not nearly as good.

430
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,760
August 4th car car's not nearly
as good as it was going to be.

431
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,240
No,

432
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,410
it was going to be a barn burner,

433
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,750
but in Congress.

434
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,070
Santa.

435
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,371
Yeah.

436
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:08,700
So far this card is a not well,

437
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,610
that's a lot of time.

438
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,240
They have some time though.

439
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,841
It does.

440
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:15,720
We're only in May and then there's
some great fights coming up.

441
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,090
Okay.

442
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,820
Robert Whitaker.

443
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,310
You well Romero son.

444
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,740
Ooh.

445
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,480
Chicago is one of the best cards ever.

446
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,460
Joe's Colby Covington.

447
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:28,031
Holly Holm.

448
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:29,020
Megan Anderson.

449
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:29,201
Hey,

450
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:30,040
let this sink in.

451
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,220
You've got cm punk first.

452
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:31,750
That Jack,

453
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,531
I forget his name.

454
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:34,630
Jackson over Overeem.

455
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,620
Curtis blaze.

456
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,710
Clearly Kadesia Esparza.

457
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,571
That's so disgusting.

458
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:43,571
And then on the undercard you got Rashad
Evans and my boy Joey Benevidez Pedis.

459
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,810
Cm punk said take a seat y'all.

460
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,690
That is so crazy Mike Jackson.

461
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,291
That is,

462
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,030
that is so crazy to me.

463
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,181
Oh,

464
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:52,810
in one verse.

465
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,650
Owen one.

466
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,980
Does that piss you off a no,

467
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:58,150
cause I get it cause I'm,

468
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:58,811
I'm not a fight.

469
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:00,490
If I was a fighter I'd be furious.

470
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,740
But now out of the game
and in the entertainment,

471
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,730
I get what you're doing.

472
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,380
Sounds a wolf tickets there.

473
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:06,701
I see.

474
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:07,534
I get what you're doing.

475
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,390
It's just the worst fight
of all time in UFC history.

476
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:11,260
Skill wise,

477
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,341
spice.

478
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:12,741
These good.

479
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:13,630
He's about to fight now.

480
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,693
Eric Spicy.

481
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,750
When do you guys know about him?

482
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,740
I don't know anything about them.

483
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:18,430
No.

484
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,720
I mean I've probably seen him fight
his black belt in Jujitsu is really the

485
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,110
favorite.

486
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,060
He's really good.

487
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:24,894
He's a weird body.

488
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,863
Um,

489
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,581
where's he from?

490
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,590
Jane somewhere on the east coast,

491
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,810
but when he's in La he
comes through my school.

492
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,150
Merck's everybody.

493
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,680
Really?

494
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,513
Yeah.

495
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:35,860
Does that,

496
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,990
does that cm punk
Jackson stuff bother you?

497
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:38,231
Joe?

498
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:38,800
Are you used to?

499
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,700
It now bothers me.

500
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,133
I don't like it.

501
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,250
I don't mind him fighting.

502
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:44,560
I think it's great that he's fighting
it and then you'll see that he's testing

503
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:45,460
himself in the UFC.

504
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,290
Even if they wanted to do in the UFC,

505
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:51,460
having him on the f you know
the prelims put him on fs one,

506
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,090
you know,

507
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,923
make it,

508
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,381
you know,

509
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,310
make it a um,

510
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,900
a fight pass thing.

511
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,790
I think his contract won't allow that.

512
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,890
I think if has guns or pay per view,

513
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,170
I would assume if you're seeing
punky have that big of a draw.

514
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,640
Maybe he was,

515
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,840
is he still be?

516
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,140
Think how many people are going to buy
that paper view to watch him fight?

517
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,831
I don't know.

518
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:09,664
That first one,

519
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:10,841
that first one,

520
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:12,310
he got his ass whipped so bad.

521
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,353
How um,

522
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,770
is the WWE like raging or is it,

523
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,650
that's why it's huge.

524
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,480
People are actually
going so just like that,

525
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,730
that raw and the raw sewage,

526
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,770
which Fox has now,

527
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,500
which in a lot of people I don't think
they realize Fox side to go with the WWE

528
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:29,334
instead of the UFC.

529
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,840
They turned down the EOC
and went with Doug Dob,

530
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:33,700
and now they have the raw sewage,

531
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:36,720
which gets like three something
million viewers every time they era.

532
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,590
It's a built in audience.

533
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,633
That's crazy.

534
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,310
I always bet on dudes were Harry backs.

535
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,541
Yeah,

536
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:47,350
their testosterone's usually way higher
than everyone else's and he's going

537
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:47,711
bald.

538
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:48,580
So we're two for two.

539
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,520
He's got some fucking gorilla back.

540
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:51,881
Look at that shit.

541
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:53,410
That's some werewolf type shit,

542
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,760
but not hairy legs,

543
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:55,530
which is weird.

544
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:55,960
Yeah,

545
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,830
very strange.

546
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,551
There's not weird,

547
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:58,900
that's some weird hair placement.

548
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,650
Unless you say as a Bush trying
to slip out of Lego blocks.

549
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,360
Let's get his legs.

550
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:05,260
I'll shave down.

551
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,970
He's got a weird body though,

552
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,181
right?

553
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:07,331
Yeah,

554
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:07,511
right.

555
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:07,781
It's a,

556
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:08,614
it's interesting.

557
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,041
He's a kid.

558
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:09,874
He's a character.

559
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,721
If it goes to the ground,

560
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:11,554
homeboys in trouble,

561
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,173
good jab.

562
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,190
He's got a good jab.

563
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,641
We'll get that pop,

564
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:18,050
pop,

565
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:18,470
you know,

566
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,250
good range.

567
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,083
Oh,

568
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,433
[inaudible]

569
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:23,751
damps too.

570
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:24,430
Or just popped it.

571
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,530
Where's Stuart from yet?

572
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,630
A white flag.

573
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,540
It looked like a red cross
flag as country Dune.

574
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,050
Fulcan England though.

575
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:33,801
Yeah.

576
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:34,161
The what?

577
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:35,620
Come on Scau slide.

578
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,463
I'm sorry,

579
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:37,881
I forgot.

580
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:38,211
That's right.

581
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,020
It was a Braveheart.

582
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,853
I forgot.

583
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,010
Fucking brave heart.

584
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,650
Haven't seen Braveheart and 10 years guys.

585
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,970
Totally different country.

586
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,823
God Damn it.

587
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,720
Shit.

588
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,200
Okay.

589
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,450
It's still United Kingdom that it's true.

590
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:51,284
Good point.

591
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,130
Good point.

592
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:52,281
Yeah.

593
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:56,870
We were talking before the podcast
about how good [inaudible] a scouse

594
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,480
Liverpool access,

595
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,160
so it's fucking amazing.

596
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:01,730
So good.

597
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,850
He's so talented.

598
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,770
Yours was good too.

599
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:05,000
The other night become so,

600
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,360
yeah,

601
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,930
you didn't till it's fucking good.

602
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,091
It was good.

603
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:08,750
That was high.

604
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah.

605
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,150
That's channeling super legit though.

606
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,180
I've done everything I can to prepare,

607
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:15,991
dump,

608
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:16,201
dump,

609
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:16,550
dump.

610
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,660
A lot of pressure on the kid.

611
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:18,771
Yeah.

612
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:19,551
Well it's crazy.

613
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,960
If this is all going on,

614
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,410
as we heard that while his girlfriend is
pregnant and in the hospital and she's

615
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:27,950
having issues with the baby,

616
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,640
I can't imagine three down.

617
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,260
We've been through pregnancies
but was tearing to take them down.

618
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:33,651
Oh,

619
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:34,700
he just wanting a healthy baby.

620
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:35,810
That's the last thing I deal with.

621
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:36,350
Fight Week.

622
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,250
Exactly goes,

623
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,600
Ooh,

624
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,111
maybe not.

625
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:41,840
Maybe not do it the same
baby mama or a different one.

626
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,371
We probably don't.

627
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:43,420
I have zero idea.

628
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,323
Did you sync up?

629
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,080
Did you,

630
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,330
do people know where we're at now?

631
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,650
Do we still have that?

632
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,693
Not necessarily.

633
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,810
Do we have a uh,

634
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,480
uh,

635
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,350
a lot number on the screen and Jamie,

636
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,670
Jamie do hooks it up on the screen
now people are watching no type move.

637
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,440
Jamie fucking balls.

638
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,300
Jamie's,

639
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,180
it's vibrant today cause it's
game seven of the calves.

640
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:05,850
He's all nervous.

641
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,321
I look at him,

642
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:08,380
he's got double C's on double C's,

643
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,683
whatever it takes.

644
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,360
He's got to catch pray this morning,

645
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:15,890
Jamie for Lebron James help.

646
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,020
He burnt some incense and shit.

647
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,230
I saw that three pointer that he did.

648
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:21,861
He hit like,

649
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:22,160
I dunno,

650
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,310
game six or something.

651
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,170
The game later,

652
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,420
they actually have something
interesting going on.

653
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:28,540
Never concussion protocol that's getting
one of their players out so I could,

654
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,180
a guy got hit in the head during the
game and he can't play until it goes

655
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:32,020
through like five to 10.

656
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:32,420
Love.

657
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:32,631
Yes.

658
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:37,631
He's missing the game because he's the
fucking basket for game seven t o cause

659
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,711
Ucla Guy.

660
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:39,670
But God man,

661
00:16:39,671 --> 00:16:40,504
the fuck up.

662
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,500
This is from a fight him.

663
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,041
It's the league.

664
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:42,161
It's,

665
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:43,740
there's rules in shooting seven.

666
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,680
It's not him.

667
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,041
It's not him.

668
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:45,874
It's the rules.

669
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,490
They do that for basketball.

670
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,260
Like some CTE in basketball.

671
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:50,970
Sure.

672
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,070
Who it was called.

673
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,840
Players that have had some problems
really ramp it like the NFL obviously,

674
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:58,510
but they get in trouble and they don't
want to be liable just like the NFL.

675
00:16:58,511 --> 00:16:59,344
They get.

676
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,260
Makes Sense.

677
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,093
Makes Sense.

678
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,021
Crazy though.

679
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:03,854
Huh?

680
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,580
They're the last people you'd think that
would be putting people on the bench.

681
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:07,821
No,

682
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:08,121
I know.

683
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:10,910
So she came seven ESPN deal.

684
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,080
Like when does that start?

685
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,100
I don't know.

686
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,540
So you have C's gonna be on ESPN and yeah,

687
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,401
no more fox.

688
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:17,234
No more done.

689
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:18,501
No,

690
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:22,670
it finishes the end of this year and
it was on the coast to be Fox and ESPN.

691
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:23,630
We're going to split it,

692
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,110
right?

693
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,441
Yeah.

694
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:27,080
And then Fox didn't want
to pay like the premium by,

695
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:27,861
I think it's better,

696
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:28,280
I think.

697
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,170
I think it was a home run for the UFC man.

698
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,550
Delanda ESPN.

699
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,030
It's,

700
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,331
you know,

701
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:34,700
it's as serious as it gets
as far as major sports.

702
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,510
It's on one network when it,

703
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,820
and also with ESPN,

704
00:17:37,821 --> 00:17:38,960
two of ESPN plus,

705
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:41,030
which we'll get some fight
nights and have regular ESPN,

706
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:42,680
ESPN two with Fox.

707
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,270
Not that they didn't do a great job,

708
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:47,390
but it was on Fxx fs to like fuck,

709
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:47,961
where is it,

710
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:48,440
where is it?

711
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,120
And announce UFC fight pass and out to go.

712
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,380
I think ESPN can learn from the mistakes
from Fox and just make it that much

713
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:55,890
better.

714
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,860
I think you're right about that because
there's been some times that I thought I

715
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:03,690
had my DVR set but then I get home and
it was on fs one I'm like mother fucker

716
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,270
or sometimes be like my bed or it's,

717
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,320
it's like my bat NASCAR's playing so go
to FX x times six well fuck man wears

718
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:14,560
that hat or a baseball game goes
long and you've got to go to fs two.

719
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,330
Yes,

720
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,500
I've got to find it.

721
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:22,010
That's 672 my my only concern on ESPN
because ESPN fc has the NFL has MBA.

722
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,863
How much,

723
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,910
how much focus do you even put on the UFC?

724
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,220
You know,

725
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,680
like we don't want to be the side chick.

726
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,190
Right,

727
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,270
because they're made to the NBA.

728
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:30,691
Nfl.

729
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:31,110
That's that.

730
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,771
That's their baby.

731
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:33,840
Are we the is the UFC
can be the side chick.

732
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,830
You know.

733
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,431
Good point.

734
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't want,

735
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,630
but they'd been putting on
some good boxing matches there.

736
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,120
The llama Chenko Genco
contracted Luma Chanko.

737
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:41,530
Yeah,

738
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,270
they had,

739
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,860
they had another really
good fight on recently.

740
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,530
Check on my podcast coming up.

741
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,080
Ooh.

742
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,430
Yeah,

743
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,050
yeah.

744
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:48,660
Side for that.

745
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,560
I don't know how to say English is,

746
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,394
but we'll figure it out.

747
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,091
Yeah,

748
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:51,900
I'm a,

749
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,280
they contacted me too.

750
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,060
Yeah.

751
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,380
I think I'm going to have mine as well.

752
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,210
Might as well.

753
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,043
Might as well.

754
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,110
I've got questions.

755
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,090
I got a Lotta [inaudible] first

756
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,590
pull the trigger from

757
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:08,963
SPN

758
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,310
learned from my mistakes.

759
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,223
Get a translator.

760
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,490
It's sometimes it's like you think it'd
be a good idea to have somebody out,

761
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:17,490
but if you had them on like,

762
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,363
Ooh,

763
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,190
how long could you talk to them?

764
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,530
I know it'd be for the
showtime below the TV show,

765
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:25,620
so it's only six minutes segment.

766
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,581
Yeah.

767
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:27,720
When you've had a,

768
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,920
you've had cyborg gone but you've had
around with her boyfriend or boyfriend

769
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:32,754
translates.

770
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,361
Well,

771
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:33,511
no,

772
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:34,440
her English is pretty good,

773
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:35,910
but if there's ever issues,

774
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,080
so like takeover,

775
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,720
you know,

776
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,450
like she'll explain it
and then it's a little,

777
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:39,961
I'm a little like,

778
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,070
I don't know what you're talking about.

779
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:41,310
Right.

780
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,420
And then told her to take over,

781
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,560
but it works great.

782
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,453
Yeah,

783
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:45,511
it's hard.

784
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:46,021
You know when,

785
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:46,771
when I had a year,

786
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:47,430
well Ron,

787
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,540
it was the best because Joey was
translating for [inaudible] and so,

788
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,770
you know better than Joe.

789
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,200
It was,

790
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,450
dre was great.

791
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,160
So fucking hard gig though.

792
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,930
Translate and translate nightmare.

793
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,680
I can't shut up.

794
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,960
Joined do it for all the fun.

795
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,211
I mean,

796
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:00,421
Eddie,

797
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:01,290
you speak Spanish,

798
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,490
you know how hard it is.

799
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,600
I barely speak Spanish.

800
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,790
You speak enough like to talk to people.

801
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,833
We keep it light.

802
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,670
Yeah.

803
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,780
Soon as we get deep,

804
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,990
I'm lost Iranian start there.

805
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,650
They start real flowing fast.

806
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:15,120
And my grandma,

807
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:15,954
when she started,

808
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,620
you know,

809
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,730
I was the first of the grandkids
to lose Spanish and uh,

810
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,950
felt really shameful because of that.

811
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:23,581
But man,

812
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:23,940
it was,

813
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,570
it was rare.

814
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,570
It was really embarrassing hanging out
with my grandmother and she's going off

815
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:28,080
and I'm like,

816
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,070
I don't know what she's saying.

817
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:30,500
I got look it over to my aunts.

818
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,221
I'm like,

819
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:33,054
what did she just say?

820
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,450
Very embarrassed.

821
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,580
It's tough when you have a translator
because you don't get in that flow.

822
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:38,830
Like,

823
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,830
you know when a pot there's,

824
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:41,670
there's a flow and you're
like kind of connecting,

825
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,010
going back and forth where
if there's a translator,

826
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:46,080
just the chemistry's not there.

827
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:46,450
Right.

828
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,270
You don't have that fun kind of flow.

829
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,671
No,

830
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:50,230
but the one thing that is good though,

831
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:50,391
I,

832
00:20:50,391 --> 00:20:50,860
I,

833
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,640
what I find is that it allows you more
time to think about what you're going to

834
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:55,000
say,

835
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,960
oh,

836
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,833
we heard them.

837
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,560
Damn Stewart's 10 off.

838
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,281
Ooh,

839
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:01,480
spicy coming back.

840
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,280
But,

841
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,500
but sometimes when I have too much
time to think about the question,

842
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:05,890
I'm not,

843
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,191
you know,

844
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:06,820
I don't,

845
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,780
it's not as fun.

846
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,280
It's not as good sometimes organic.

847
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,331
Then I feel like,

848
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:10,720
uh,

849
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,100
like I worked for ESPN or something,

850
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:14,290
like I know exactly what you're talking
about and I don't want to be that.

851
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,163
Yeah,

852
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,731
yeah,

853
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:16,031
yeah,

854
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:16,301
yeah.

855
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:16,601
Right.

856
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:19,820
That's the hard part of like having these
conversations with people is to keep

857
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:19,960
it,

858
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,051
um,

859
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:24,280
conversations and not turning them
into some corny ass fucking interview.

860
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,833
The worst,

861
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,703
there's nothing worse,

862
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,910
but sometimes you have to do that if you,

863
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:28,480
if you can't,

864
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,190
like sometimes I feel myself was still,

865
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:31,860
she was so shit.

866
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,410
I got hurt.

867
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:32,651
Oh,

868
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:33,484
that hurt.

869
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,353
Oh,

870
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,003
that's it.

871
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:44,380
Stuart was an underdog to in this
damn hit him with some bombs.

872
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,101
England coming in.

873
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:45,610
Strung.

874
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:45,791
Yeah,

875
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:46,001
man.

876
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:50,130
I've watched those interviews are
standard interviews now where you know,

877
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,950
there's no connection between the person
talking and the other person answering

878
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:55,720
the questions and there so gross.

879
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:56,020
You know what?

880
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,830
I've done this conversation
with a Ken Jong.

881
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,113
Yeah.

882
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,640
Yeah.

883
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,121
Doctor Ken,

884
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:01,781
who's amazing,

885
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:02,980
might be the nicest guy in the world.

886
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,731
He's a sweetheart,

887
00:22:03,731 --> 00:22:04,750
but he doesn't do a lot of it.

888
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,351
He's like,

889
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:05,951
podcasts,

890
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:06,191
really?

891
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:06,431
I'm like,

892
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:07,100
dude,

893
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,730
I'm having a public set up Joe
or something like the pockets is,

894
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,930
it's as big as it gets,

895
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:11,141
man.

896
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:11,650
He's like,

897
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,260
yeah,

898
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,093
Mike and I,

899
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:13,781
the example,

900
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:14,201
I gave him money.

901
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:14,511
He will say,

902
00:22:14,511 --> 00:22:17,350
you went on tonight show and
you do a four minute segment.

903
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,363
You're going to have to,

904
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:22,420
you literally promoting whatever movie
or the stand up your special coming out,

905
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,540
but that's all you're doing is promoting
and trying to get people to buy that.

906
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,080
That's not,

907
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,861
that's not real,

908
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:27,131
man.

909
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:27,791
That's not the real,

910
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,680
you are like me and
we're talking like this.

911
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,551
If we filmed this,

912
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:33,220
people can be a fan of you
then buy whatever you can
be into or whenever you're

913
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,830
pitching.

914
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,170
It's a much better way to go.

915
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,370
There's no time limit,

916
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,540
no restrictions.

917
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,190
It's crazy that you never get it.

918
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,750
There's no other place for that.

919
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,720
Like even Howard stern would
do interviews with people.

920
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:45,340
He would get people to say a lot of shit.

921
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:46,480
He had a agenda.

922
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,320
Yeah,

923
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,861
he had an agenda.

924
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:49,860
Howard stern had an agenda typically.

925
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,743
Yeah.

926
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,873
Dirt out.

927
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,410
None of your fucking,

928
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,220
yeah.

929
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,060
That was an agenda.

930
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,960
The agenda.

931
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,351
He wouldn't,

932
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:58,120
he wasn't just having a
conversation with you.

933
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,040
He calls himself the dentist.

934
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,700
Okay,

935
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,533
got it.

936
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,100
Did he fuck people's teeth?

937
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,140
Does he have nice to see a dentist.

938
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,130
We'll hope he has bad teeth.

939
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:06,851
He knocks,

940
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:08,110
he pulls people's teeth out.

941
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,330
It's hard with his fist for sure.

942
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,650
Um,

943
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,483
it's a terrible name.

944
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:13,631
Yeah.

945
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:16,140
Well it's already been
taken to Josh neer Yammer,

946
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,740
mom Bro.

947
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,400
Old School.

948
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,340
That's a great name.

949
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:18,701
Do the,

950
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:19,630
knocked his teeth out.

951
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,170
What's a guy like Josh neer in my opinion.

952
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,830
He's a guy that is hardcore fan.

953
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,400
You know who Josh neer is and Josh
neer has been around a long time.

954
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,360
Fans don't know him though,

955
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:32,270
so that goes dead.

956
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,580
So cool.

957
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,510
Still.

958
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,070
That's like calling
yourself hands of stone.

959
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:36,850
If you're a boxer,

960
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,930
lay the fuck off.

961
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,550
That's Roberto Duran.

962
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:39,830
Yeah,

963
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,540
the fuck up.

964
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,630
I'm not saying that Josh is in
the same breath is Roberto Duran,

965
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,650
but still as a fan.

966
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:46,100
A fan

967
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,240
for a long time.

968
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:47,840
Yeah.

969
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,640
That's his nickname.

970
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,100
Someone had the hands of stone though.

971
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,890
Sounds Lineker John Lineker what about,

972
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,960
what about a harmonic or or Sam Stout?

973
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,020
One of them he could call.

974
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,520
So did a homeboy in strike was the
Kim over the UFC when he had that.

975
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,200
They almost had like the double knockout.

976
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,860
He hit a homeboy with a body
shot and they got knocked out.

977
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,581
Oh,

978
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:11,414
what's his name?

979
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,190
Scott Smith.

980
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,120
Scott Smith.

981
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,781
Hands the stones.

982
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:15,130
Right.

983
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:15,721
Had to steal,

984
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:16,554
steal,

985
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,453
steal.

986
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,503
There's a lot of that.

987
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,190
Yeah,

988
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,300
there's a lot of that going around.

989
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,163
You know,

990
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,120
some people just go hard,

991
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:25,880
but those fucking made up nicknames
and make them up for themselves and you

992
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,900
can't do that man.

993
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,940
You can't give yourself a nickname.

994
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,320
You just can't do that.

995
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,870
That's doesn't work that like you imagine
if a kid you went to neighborhood and

996
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:36,680
just give yourself a nickname.

997
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,730
He kicked the fuck out of here.

998
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:38,564
We're calling you.

999
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,521
Nah Man,

1000
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:40,691
I'm,

1001
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:41,540
I'm the dark night.

1002
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,410
No you're not.

1003
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,480
Well that's what I like about Brazilians.

1004
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,570
Like they all have like silly
nicknames like shoe face.

1005
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,950
Either our tree stump.

1006
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,500
Yeah.

1007
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,680
Fun Nickname.

1008
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,513
Hell yeah.

1009
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,890
It's calling you.

1010
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,580
Like,

1011
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,120
if you're,

1012
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,380
if it's 2018 and you just starting
out and you call yourself to pit bull,

1013
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,273
fuck off,

1014
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:06,310
get the fuck out of here are
some that are off limits.

1015
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,730
Is that the most common one?

1016
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,633
It might be.

1017
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,830
That might be on people.

1018
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:10,664
Super.

1019
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,860
There's about seven pit
bulls and Bella tour.

1020
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,970
There's three in the UFC at
least when his girls too,

1021
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:16,221
because look,

1022
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:17,450
there are other cool dogs.

1023
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,220
Isn't Jack Russell?

1024
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:22,940
That's the coolest one.

1025
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,350
Those are these

1026
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,213
hunters.

1027
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,860
Have you ever seen that Netflix
documentary where they use Jack Russell

1028
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:32,000
terrorist to get rats?

1029
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:32,870
There you go.

1030
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,081
Yo.

1031
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:33,914
It's crazy.

1032
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,070
I feel like you want to
watch them a an hour.

1033
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,371
No,

1034
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:37,461
no,

1035
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:37,730
no,

1036
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,001
no.

1037
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:38,081
The,

1038
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:38,231
the,

1039
00:25:38,231 --> 00:25:38,811
the doc.

1040
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:42,190
The all on how fucked up rats
are and how many have got you.

1041
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,730
You ever see that dude?

1042
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,593
It will free.

1043
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,760
You Use Jack Russells to go after raps.

1044
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,623
Yeah.

1045
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,430
Jack Russells are so aggressive.

1046
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,620
Little terriers.

1047
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,010
Um,

1048
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,100
it's one of the reasons why they're
so aggressive is because they're,

1049
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,110
they're constantly chasing
after these fucking rats.

1050
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,921
When they get them,

1051
00:25:57,921 --> 00:25:59,210
they tear these rats apart.

1052
00:25:59,211 --> 00:25:59,331
Man.

1053
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:00,650
I look at that damn dude.

1054
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:02,120
Those are some Bush league dogs.

1055
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:02,950
That's a,

1056
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,783
that's a mix.

1057
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,050
The Jamie that this is
from the movies are,

1058
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,050
but these are some of them.

1059
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,250
These are all part Jack Russell
terriers in in particular.

1060
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,500
One of the reasons why they're
so small and so aggressive,

1061
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,170
they would go into
holes and go after rats.

1062
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:15,921
Dude,

1063
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:17,030
look at the blood on the back.

1064
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:18,110
Where the fuck are they?

1065
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,830
So Michael Vick video dark place.

1066
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,903
Oh,

1067
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,160
but this documentary will
freak you the fuck out.

1068
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,830
There's more rats than there
are people in New York City.

1069
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,720
30 it's 30 million or 60
million rats or some shit.

1070
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:35,330
[inaudible] they have like all sorts of
diseases that everything that can kill

1071
00:26:35,331 --> 00:26:36,020
you,

1072
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,910
they have all kinds of deadly shit.

1073
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,760
You just don't get it because most
people don't get bit by rats and they're

1074
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:41,480
smart.

1075
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,710
But we need rats though.

1076
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:42,921
Right?

1077
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:43,890
Don't eat the trash.

1078
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,880
That's a good question.

1079
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,750
Can't we just,

1080
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,120
do they eat the trash?

1081
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,700
We can just can't just breathe rats and
you throw them in the dump and just have

1082
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:51,850
him eat like,

1083
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,760
I don't think they like fucking milk.

1084
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,160
Could just have

1085
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:01,370
pretty heady bravos get a
rat reading service releases.

1086
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,510
When the dog got cancer,

1087
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,160
did you see drastic rat?

1088
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:06,691
Yeah,

1089
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,340
but now we've got to
get rid of the rat shit.

1090
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,840
Oh fuck dude.

1091
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,800
Hey,

1092
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,700
use it as fertilizer.

1093
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,960
That can't be good for the dogs.

1094
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,240
Mami Manoa,

1095
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:15,721
boom,

1096
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:16,320
boom,

1097
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,711
boom.

1098
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:17,880
Here's a fun hot minute.

1099
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,890
When did he fight last?

1100
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,423
He'd lost.

1101
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,750
I thought he starched homeboy though.

1102
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:24,584
The wrestler

1103
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,490
who?

1104
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:26,791
Oh,

1105
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:27,840
nor dean to lab.

1106
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,160
He's very good.

1107
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,030
That guy's good.

1108
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,360
He's a nasty he his knee Tristar.

1109
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:33,901
Yeah,

1110
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:34,231
he is.

1111
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:34,980
He looks at the,

1112
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,620
he looks at the guy with the roses
and mouth from Mike Tyson's punch out.

1113
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,211
Does he?

1114
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:44,211
Does he does Darren tills got
some prominent cheekbones,

1115
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:44,820
Huh?

1116
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,653
Yeah,

1117
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,670
but that's why he got that nickname.

1118
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:48,450
The gorilla.

1119
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,200
He looks like he's got at
least 5% in the end are tall.

1120
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,810
Do you think someone
gave him that nickname?

1121
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,530
The gorilla?

1122
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,363
Yeah,

1123
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,560
I hope so too.

1124
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,920
That bums me out when
people give themselves,

1125
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,620
I call myself to gorilla.

1126
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,760
I hated,

1127
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,750
I hated my nickname,

1128
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,070
the twisters so much.

1129
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,970
I hated that shit cause I
just sounds pretty homosexual.

1130
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,450
The twister because Hagan and John,

1131
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:16,261
Jack would always call me.

1132
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,210
That was shit because of the guillotine.

1133
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,370
They called the rustlers
guilty and the twister,

1134
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,750
and I asked her [inaudible].

1135
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,610
I'm like,

1136
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,800
how do you say the twister and Portuguese?

1137
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,151
And he goes,

1138
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:26,420
total.

1139
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:26,911
Now they're like,

1140
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:26,971
oh,

1141
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:27,751
can you call me that?

1142
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:28,584
That sounds way better.

1143
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,060
Yeah,

1144
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,893
call me that.

1145
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,880
They would never call me that.

1146
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,120
I kept calling me twister and it stopped.

1147
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:35,790
It started.

1148
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:39,420
It started sounding good when I compete
and people would start yelling at

1149
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:39,930
Twitter.

1150
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,411
Then I thought,

1151
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:40,981
okay,

1152
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:41,341
okay.

1153
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:42,570
I think I like it now.

1154
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,710
I did get man taught her Nado torn.

1155
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,290
I just kept thinking of the game,

1156
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,570
the twister and the
yellow dots and the dots.

1157
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,190
Yeah.

1158
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,450
You should get a tattoo
that says El Toronado.

1159
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,363
Yes.

1160
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,910
Fucking never stuck.

1161
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,800
Aren't you get sticking right now.

1162
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,653
Now I'm going to call it.

1163
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,793
Yeah,

1164
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,620
that's way better than the twist
or that's a great word though.

1165
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,870
It sounds dangerous to
go to notch this summer.

1166
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,670
Toronado there you go.

1167
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,300
That would be a great license,

1168
00:29:10,301 --> 00:29:13,290
but if you could fit all
those words torn on Tornado,

1169
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,740
Tornado,

1170
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,573
it doesn't have no,

1171
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:22,370
it's there's an a different tornado.

1172
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:22,591
No,

1173
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:23,550
there's tour Rod.

1174
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,560
Nado Tornado.

1175
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,410
There's a,

1176
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,880
there's an a in their
English is Tornado Tornado,

1177
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:30,660
is it?

1178
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,051
No,

1179
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:34,450
I'm just told that the aids.

1180
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:34,941
What I know,

1181
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,300
I though that's what makes it dope.

1182
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:36,841
You can't,

1183
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:40,100
you can't pick your nickname like county
called me big brown for the longest.

1184
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,621
Like I'm like,

1185
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:42,190
why is it because you're
being fucking brown.

1186
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,053
That's just what,

1187
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,320
and then I would walk place.

1188
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:45,520
People would yell up big browns.

1189
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:45,890
Okay,

1190
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,760
well fuck that stock.

1191
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:47,140
Right.

1192
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,973
Brown.

1193
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,630
That's a good nickname.

1194
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,920
Kind of fun.

1195
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,710
It's fine.

1196
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,240
Yeah.

1197
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:52,960
Yeah.

1198
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,500
That's good.

1199
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,770
The other one's name dope.

1200
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,850
Oh yeah.

1201
00:29:56,851 --> 00:29:57,850
That's a whole,

1202
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,713
that's just from you.

1203
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:58,961
Yeah,

1204
00:29:58,961 --> 00:29:59,540
that's it.

1205
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,630
But even when you were doing taekwondo,

1206
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,590
no one gave me a nickname.

1207
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:02,920
No,

1208
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,580
Joe.

1209
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,120
No.

1210
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,601
When I was,

1211
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:04,890
uh,

1212
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:05,711
playing pool a lot,

1213
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:06,760
I was Joe the comedian,

1214
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,090
GSP with us on the podcast.

1215
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:12,040
He just did on your turning sidekick.

1216
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,031
Holy Shit.

1217
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:14,090
Talk about endorsers.

1218
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,900
Critiquing it as good for a half an hour.

1219
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:19,390
Has Gone on about his power is incredible.

1220
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,021
No Shit.

1221
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:20,530
George.

1222
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,311
Holy Shit.

1223
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:24,040
As GSP going off on Joe Rogan.

1224
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:24,221
Yeah,

1225
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:25,540
we trained a little afterwards.

1226
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,070
I switched my mats out.

1227
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,100
I had those a zebra mats that are
super smooth and no Bueno to at all.

1228
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,190
Dee Dee Dee on,

1229
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,180
on throwing kit DVD.

1230
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:39,940
Was it 1997 some sort
of a video will still,

1231
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:40,774
you know people,

1232
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,300
John Danaher just put out a DVD.

1233
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,020
Well he put out a video on demand.

1234
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,640
I bet he paid

1235
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,750
wranglers in fucking under Armour.

1236
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:53,561
Todd's of course,

1237
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:54,490
but a DVD,

1238
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,360
fanny pack game,

1239
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,973
fanny pack.

1240
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,520
Uh Yeah,

1241
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,360
I would uh,

1242
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,070
I would do that.

1243
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,850
George and I,

1244
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,683
we,

1245
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,220
we went over the front
leg side kick first,

1246
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:13,620
which is like the most important part.

1247
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,650
The attorney sidekick.

1248
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,630
Once you get the front leg side kick down,

1249
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:17,680
you understand how that works,

1250
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,820
then you turn and then it's basically
you're turning and then throwing the front

1251
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:22,391
leg side kick.

1252
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:24,250
It's just going to get
an extra push to it.

1253
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,360
But most people do the front,

1254
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:27,250
like psychic rom there needs to low,

1255
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,211
it needs too low.

1256
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:29,110
You lose all power.

1257
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,100
Crazy shit.

1258
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,761
You think you fight.

1259
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:35,230
If he's going to fight at 55 [inaudible]
five 100% and he's only 185 pounds,

1260
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:40,000
she has paid 55 and he's only doing it
once and it's going to be the winner of

1261
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,311
Conor.

1262
00:31:40,311 --> 00:31:40,960
Khabib,

1263
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,610
he started doing this is you look at this.

1264
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,900
This is what Wonderboy does.

1265
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:44,260
It's CR.

1266
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,010
That's weird.

1267
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,890
That sideways stance is
hard to fuck with man.

1268
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,710
I used to spar with this
guy named Larry Jones.

1269
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,660
Larry Johns was this dude who was like,

1270
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:57,520
he was like six foot two but his
fucking legs when all the way up to his

1271
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,240
armpits,

1272
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,660
man had along that.

1273
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,460
The guys who was standing in front
of the bag when you first walked,

1274
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:04,294
by that time,

1275
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,133
John Lee,

1276
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,640
John's another tall dude,

1277
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,200
Chinese dude,

1278
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,033
black dude.

1279
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:12,340
John [inaudible] was a beast that
could easily be a Chinese dude.

1280
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:12,581
Yeah,

1281
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:13,211
it could be.

1282
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:13,421
Yeah,

1283
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:13,961
if you heard it,

1284
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:18,961
but he was like six foot two black
as coal dad walking by that Taiwan.

1285
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,590
He just all bullshit.

1286
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:21,751
Dude.

1287
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:23,530
That guy hit so hard.

1288
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,200
I saw him flat and a lot
of people with that too.

1289
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,360
Um,

1290
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,800
but anyway,

1291
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:30,850
my friend Larry Jones,

1292
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,650
I was too short,

1293
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:32,921
you know,

1294
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:33,401
I'm five,

1295
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:34,810
eight when I would spar with him,

1296
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:36,420
my legs were normal leg,

1297
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,611
he was six,

1298
00:32:37,611 --> 00:32:40,010
two and I just could
not get past that front

1299
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,300
leg side kick night man.

1300
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:41,781
That front,

1301
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:45,200
like psychic is so hard and they
can just move around with you.

1302
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:48,440
It's basically like a jab and
they can move around with you.

1303
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:48,891
You know,

1304
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:49,251
it's like,

1305
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:50,084
and they're safe.

1306
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:50,510
Yeah.

1307
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,880
You try and get an angle
trying to get an angle on them.

1308
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:58,150
There's actually a thing on a hen Zos
Instagram the other day we had a photo of

1309
00:32:58,461 --> 00:33:03,110
Hixon throwing a sidekick and he was
talking about how Hixon like the sidekick

1310
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,700
best for Valley Tudo.

1311
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:05,450
Um,

1312
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,860
because you know,

1313
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,150
you never lost your base.

1314
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,740
Like if you throw a roundhouse kick,

1315
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,600
you throw the kid running around,

1316
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:12,230
you reset it.

1317
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,820
He was kind of throwing like
a front push kick side kick.

1318
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,290
Yup.

1319
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:15,770
And he would,

1320
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,820
out of all the Gracies,

1321
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:20,910
it looked like Hixon through it with
the most power because the hoist would

1322
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:21,090
throw,

1323
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,190
but it didn't look powerful.

1324
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,023
But,

1325
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:26,030
but when you watch hoists Sakuraba too,

1326
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,410
when it was at the coliseum,

1327
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,880
but that's a forgotten fight.

1328
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,930
People Watch how hoist
would be on his back and,

1329
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,570
and uh,

1330
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,970
in sac was standing over him
and he was like purgatory.

1331
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,620
Sakharova standing hoists,

1332
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:39,200
throw side kicks off his back.

1333
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:40,910
Dude Harney Dude,

1334
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,530
better than anybody I've ever seen.

1335
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,550
He's on his side and he was throwing
some serious side kicks off his back,

1336
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:48,950
little soccer and fucking
up soc Robin's needs.

1337
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,800
I've never seen anybody
remember Hixon did that too.

1338
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:56,510
Finicky when Funai got Hixon down for
knocky broke Hickson's orbital people

1339
00:33:56,511 --> 00:33:57,530
forget like that.

1340
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:57,800
What?

1341
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,070
That was Hickson's greatest victory
because for Nakia was the guy that when

1342
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:01,611
people were saying,

1343
00:34:01,611 --> 00:34:02,444
well,

1344
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,560
he's such a good grappler,

1345
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:04,700
if he went to the ground with Hixon,

1346
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,211
he could,

1347
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:06,560
he could actually hang with Hixon.

1348
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,060
But he cracked Hicks.

1349
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:12,800
Him with a big right hand hurt him
fucked up as I broke his orbital and they

1350
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:13,634
went to the ground.

1351
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,810
And as we knock you standing over
Hixson Hixson fucked his knees up,

1352
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,360
fucked his knees up with
side kicks off of his back.

1353
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,670
That's huge.

1354
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,281
Huge.

1355
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:23,990
And no one practices that shit.

1356
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,620
No.

1357
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,150
No.

1358
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:25,983
And a practice.

1359
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:27,890
Hanzo,

1360
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,283
uh,

1361
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:33,530
would practice up kicks specifically just
just in case he was in that purgatory

1362
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,640
position where he got boom,

1363
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,010
it worked against old leg talk.

1364
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:37,311
Tara.

1365
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:38,144
Remember that?

1366
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,550
That was the first upkick for us.

1367
00:34:40,551 --> 00:34:41,384
Appkit Kale.

1368
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,490
And I think it was either,

1369
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,170
I think Marillo Bustamonte did it to
Jerry Bolander or it was either Fabio's

1370
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:51,710
years yelled at book Bolando or
Bustamante to Belinda upkick.

1371
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:52,491
Boom.

1372
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:53,150
Took 'em out.

1373
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,780
Bam.

1374
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,800
You know the Kickstarter now,

1375
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,480
legal and combat Jujitsu.

1376
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,800
They're illegal.

1377
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,371
Yes.

1378
00:34:58,371 --> 00:34:58,611
Kicks.

1379
00:34:58,611 --> 00:34:59,444
He go,

1380
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,011
Shit.

1381
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:01,980
How hard was that to get?

1382
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,140
Um,

1383
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,460
you know what an amateur MMA
UPP kicks her legal gate guard.

1384
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,681
You know what?

1385
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:07,400
I'm Sassy.

1386
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,740
Amateur MMA UPP kicks your legal,

1387
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,690
we added them to combat you just because
guys are getting too comfortable in

1388
00:35:12,691 --> 00:35:13,524
purgatory,

1389
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,930
just standing over guys.

1390
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:17,450
They didn't want to go into anybody's
guard that could kill the show.

1391
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,890
So now with the threat,

1392
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,720
it's really easy to deal with upkick.

1393
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:22,940
So all they gotta do just get to
their needs and start passing.

1394
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:23,720
You gotta engage.

1395
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:23,871
Yeah.

1396
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,980
Just engage if all you get,

1397
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,100
because you rarely see up kicks in Nma
rarely because they're so easy to deal

1398
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:30,920
with.

1399
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,350
But the threat of them will keep you,

1400
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:33,970
you know,

1401
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:37,680
I'll either away from purgatory
or get on your knees and,

1402
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:38,040
and

1403
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,120
commenced to passing.

1404
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,380
That's what it's all about.

1405
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,670
You about to say Musashi.

1406
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,541
Dockery yeah,

1407
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,460
he knocked out jocker right.

1408
00:35:43,461 --> 00:35:44,550
Where that triangle choke though.

1409
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,690
He fell into a triangle.

1410
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:45,941
Yeah,

1411
00:35:45,941 --> 00:35:46,980
there's been probably,

1412
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:51,450
I would say I see Roy McDonald door
like seven total up kicks it history,

1413
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:52,680
something like that there.

1414
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,720
So we're not adding up kicks to
combat Jujitsu to increase Kaos.

1415
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,570
We're adding it to increase the ground
says don't stand over the guy with pass.

1416
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,503
Let's go.

1417
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,021
Yeah,

1418
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:04,651
let's get to that.

1419
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:05,230
Smart.

1420
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:05,950
Super Smart.

1421
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:06,420
Yeah.

1422
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:06,720
Yeah.

1423
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,180
I Love Combat Jujitsu.

1424
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,210
I love the rule set.

1425
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,500
I love what it does.

1426
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,700
It opens up,

1427
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:11,900
uh,

1428
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,150
the,

1429
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,470
the reality aspect.

1430
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,900
Do you understand that you
can't just do certain things.

1431
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:17,580
You're going to get
smacked in the face hard.

1432
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,080
It keeps your Jujitsu honest.

1433
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:19,650
That's it.

1434
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,910
Don't get too crazy,

1435
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,390
dude.

1436
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,500
I forgot to Holly Holm
versus Megan Anderson.

1437
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,450
That's a barn burner.

1438
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,540
Oh yeah.

1439
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:28,890
It's a big fight for Anderson.

1440
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:32,190
Is her her first shot at
the UFC and his right away.

1441
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,063
Holly Holm.

1442
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:33,740
Is there any,

1443
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,870
because they could give Cyborg a match.

1444
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,620
A good,

1445
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,453
good competition.

1446
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,423
Ryerson.

1447
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,463
Uriah favor.

1448
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:40,910
Favor.

1449
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,170
If there's not a woman who's
going to give her any challenge?

1450
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:44,610
Uriah February.

1451
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,010
Would it be illegal Cyborg to find a man?

1452
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,520
No.

1453
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:47,701
No.

1454
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:49,140
It's me movement.

1455
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,230
What are you talking about?

1456
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,093
You know what I'm saying?

1457
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,240
It has nothing to do with that.

1458
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,560
No.

1459
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,450
May choose about sexual assault credit.

1460
00:36:59,480 --> 00:36:59,910
No.

1461
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,280
I know brother and I'm
not saying you're a fever,

1462
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:02,880
did that,

1463
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,620
but you paint the story market.

1464
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:05,580
She comes out with me too.

1465
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:08,070
It just beats the shit out of a
dualism of gallons in her corner

1466
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,140
and then in the secondary blinds,

1467
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,980
dean comes out of the floor
right behind the smoke.

1468
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,430
Cm pumps,

1469
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,263
five main event.

1470
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,520
Cm punk against Cyborg.

1471
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:21,410
That would be great.

1472
00:37:21,411 --> 00:37:22,270
That's what I said

1473
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,653
before,

1474
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,190
or not,

1475
00:37:26,191 --> 00:37:26,760
bro.

1476
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,630
What would she do to him?

1477
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,800
She would knock his
head off in the fucking,

1478
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,570
it was like a cartoon.

1479
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,573
Ooh.

1480
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,960
Where'd you guys saying that?

1481
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,150
Why don't you guys saying that?

1482
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:39,930
A guys could never,

1483
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,813
uh,

1484
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:44,490
at an MMA fighter kid
would always be a girl.

1485
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:44,790
Right?

1486
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:48,090
Why you sent out when we're talking about
Ronda Rousey back in the day that can,

1487
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:51,060
Ronda Rousey said that he said
Ron could beat Mike Tyson,

1488
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,733
Tyson.

1489
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,780
He got shit for them.

1490
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:01,830
But you know,

1491
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,300
the flying arm bar maybe?

1492
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,070
No,

1493
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,060
you'd still a slamming again today.

1494
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,930
He's like 50.

1495
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:07,621
Yeah,

1496
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:08,060
I did.

1497
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,000
Probably has some of his rough.

1498
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:09,191
She,

1499
00:38:09,191 --> 00:38:10,380
she would be a disaster right now.

1500
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:10,710
But,

1501
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,460
um,

1502
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,860
I think the rough as he is he doing bad,

1503
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:14,480
uh,

1504
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,211
not doing bad.

1505
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:15,541
It's just,

1506
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:15,781
you know,

1507
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:16,260
when you,

1508
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,830
especially as me growing up with,

1509
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:18,661
with Mike Tyson,

1510
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:20,100
you think they say never meet your heroes.

1511
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:20,281
You know,

1512
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:21,060
so it's like,

1513
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,780
I think of him as that Mike
Tyson and my head went on.

1514
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,660
Then when I saw him,

1515
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,810
you know he had sweats on and
some white new balances and you,

1516
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,670
he's out of shape.

1517
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,340
Parents went to this
fashion balance right away.

1518
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:32,611
You're like,

1519
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:34,020
is fashions off?

1520
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,153
Well Dude,

1521
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,140
this on Sunday afternoon leisure time,

1522
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:39,910
like it's the middle of
the was on your podcast.

1523
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,940
Larry is with your fashion.

1524
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,230
You really give a fuck.

1525
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:45,820
They didn't wear sweatpants.

1526
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:46,810
Show respect.

1527
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,620
What is it with you in fashion
that makes no sense to them?

1528
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,350
I would have never brought it up.

1529
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,420
Him wearing sweatpants and
new balance and be like,

1530
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:55,571
yeah,

1531
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:56,410
he wants to be comfortable.

1532
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,131
Really?

1533
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:57,964
Yeah.

1534
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,170
Pride.

1535
00:38:59,170 --> 00:38:59,350
No,

1536
00:38:59,350 --> 00:38:59,831
I don't want to fight.

1537
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:00,630
It's like,

1538
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,870
it's like I saw a,

1539
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,540
I don't get it.

1540
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,410
It's like I saw Bret Hart in Calgary
and I go out and they're like,

1541
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:08,290
he's in the front row and I go out
there and he's in matching sweatsuit,

1542
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:09,130
tuck the bottom of thought.

1543
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,410
Fuck Brownouts Saturday night,

1544
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:12,030
man,

1545
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,910
you have my show.

1546
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:13,121
Wait,

1547
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:13,301
wait,

1548
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:13,720
wait.

1549
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,480
He's in Canada and he's
a former pro wrestler,

1550
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:16,870
right?

1551
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,100
Yeah.

1552
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,933
He talking about,

1553
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,203
okay,

1554
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,290
he's in Canada.

1555
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,630
That's like a three piece suit up there.

1556
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,113
What are you doing?

1557
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,770
What are you doing Saturday night,

1558
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,390
Saturday,

1559
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,480
you're out on the town.

1560
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,360
Can we sweat?

1561
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:29,870
So they,

1562
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,790
that's how they roll up.

1563
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,691
They just happy.

1564
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:33,160
It's not 150 below zero.

1565
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,901
They're very happy.

1566
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:37,360
They weren't something nice
and light judge people though,

1567
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:37,571
man.

1568
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:38,740
Probably a nice sweat suit,

1569
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,603
right?

1570
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,100
It's kind of like the
McGregor matching grace,

1571
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:42,431
you know?

1572
00:39:42,431 --> 00:39:44,110
And then the white one with that.

1573
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,580
The fuck is wrong with that.

1574
00:39:45,581 --> 00:39:46,810
Looks still looks fresh.

1575
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,040
Your fucking

1576
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,453
dude.

1577
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,680
I have terrible fashion.

1578
00:39:53,681 --> 00:39:54,161
You can't listen.

1579
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:54,821
You don't though.

1580
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:57,340
You have GI was a nice
shirt yet your fanny pack,

1581
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:59,440
fanny packs are back in the
game that brought that shit.

1582
00:39:59,550 --> 00:39:59,891
Come on.

1583
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:01,780
I want her back.

1584
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,240
I want 10% of the credit for,

1585
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,390
should I just post this thing on high?

1586
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,930
Might have more than 10%
of the credit I'm being,

1587
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,860
I'm being humble.

1588
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,790
You're,

1589
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,570
you're the guy who I know who's right or
die about fanny packs and then cro cop

1590
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:14,404
still fucks with it,

1591
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:18,010
but he's on of where and how big
of an impact and I had to Croatia,

1592
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,240
they don't know what time it is.

1593
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,710
They all wear fanny packs,

1594
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,490
you know?

1595
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:21,851
Yo Dude,

1596
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:25,600
I wore fanny packs back in the
90s now you're ever stopped.

1597
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,980
Know your first team all fanny pack.

1598
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:27,281
Damn.

1599
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:28,870
Nor deep to labs going off.

1600
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,270
I just standing up and
slap the shit out of him.

1601
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:31,970
Yeah.

1602
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:32,081
No,

1603
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:33,010
he's good man.

1604
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:33,640
Nor Dean's.

1605
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,473
Very good.

1606
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,460
I never stopped with a fanny pack.

1607
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:36,611
No,

1608
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:37,750
you just ride through it even.

1609
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,110
Yeah.

1610
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,730
People like to chose fanny pack and like,

1611
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:40,564
I know man.

1612
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,760
This shit on.

1613
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:45,090
Yes.

1614
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,060
I the shit out of him.

1615
00:40:46,061 --> 00:40:47,050
I'm always out of stock.

1616
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,630
My boy wants when bad hire.

1617
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,350
I made.com we were at Disneyland.

1618
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,660
Are we close to MMA and the Olympics?

1619
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,200
Yeah.

1620
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,351
Yeah,

1621
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,184
we are.

1622
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,140
Holy Shit.

1623
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,931
They're working on it.

1624
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:56,081
Yeah.

1625
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:57,760
They're trying to imagine that.

1626
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,091
Well,

1627
00:40:58,091 --> 00:40:59,410
it would be a candidate.

1628
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,580
It would be amazing.

1629
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,940
I would rush or just when
all the belts are they,

1630
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,571
what about,

1631
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:05,590
we had some seconds,

1632
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:06,130
man.

1633
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,570
Fucking situation.

1634
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,801
I mean Russia,

1635
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:09,401
it'd be tough,

1636
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:10,150
man.

1637
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,520
Whoa.

1638
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,380
It really depends.

1639
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:12,970
Entirely drug testing,

1640
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,290
but they'll figure it out.

1641
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,660
I mean Russians when it comes,

1642
00:41:16,661 --> 00:41:16,871
you know,

1643
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:18,130
boxed and combat sports.

1644
00:41:18,131 --> 00:41:22,450
Russia is really pretty fucking good
with Dagestan be considered Russia.

1645
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,970
But the thing is though is what I
was putting it under the same banner.

1646
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:25,540
Yeah.

1647
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,261
But the thing is,

1648
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:30,070
what would happen is if it did
become huge in the Olympics,

1649
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,420
then people would realize like,

1650
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:34,470
you know how guys like
Floyd Mayweather and uh,

1651
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:39,080
so many different professional boxers got
their start as a Olympic gold medalist

1652
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,720
and then went on to become
these huge superstars in boxing.

1653
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,300
Loma Chanko is another good example.

1654
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,630
When you have like a real
great amateur background,

1655
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:50,900
people get super amped
up for go pro Andre Ward.

1656
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,620
Yeah.

1657
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,440
Anthony Joshua.

1658
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,273
Yup.

1659
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:56,720
You get super amped up about seeing
those guys go pro in America.

1660
00:41:56,721 --> 00:41:57,620
It's a little different though,

1661
00:41:57,621 --> 00:41:59,390
for the reason when it comes to boxing.

1662
00:41:59,690 --> 00:41:59,991
Yeah.

1663
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:04,070
Because we liked the other can we use to
with Mark Breland member of those days

1664
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:05,390
with a Tyrrell pigs,

1665
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,410
we used to love it.

1666
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,020
We used to love it when a
guy was a Olympic gold metal.

1667
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:09,854
Pernell Whitaker,

1668
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,960
you know ray Mercer.

1669
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:12,370
Yeah.

1670
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:12,710
I said,

1671
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,610
let Andre Ward though.

1672
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:14,031
It's still,

1673
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:14,241
you know,

1674
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:15,800
and he looked at this leg lock

1675
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,130
Deontay wilder has a bronze medal.

1676
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:19,964
This was Shane bags.

1677
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,840
He started boxing like 21 oh shit.

1678
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,870
Anytime he hit them double
outside Ashley's and MMA,

1679
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,340
they're risky.

1680
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,260
What such a weird position
to find yourself in.

1681
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:33,410
If a guy can punch in the face and again
it goes back to your combat Jujitsu,

1682
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:34,400
all Monta.

1683
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,490
Yep.

1684
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,860
It goes back to your combat Jujitsu.

1685
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:39,860
You understand what positions are like
super dangerous cause there's positions

1686
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:44,861
at guys regularly practice in Jujitsu
that will get you fucked up if a guy can

1687
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:45,794
punch you in the face.

1688
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,580
Exactly.

1689
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,480
That's what it's all about.

1690
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,370
Combat Jujitsu is such a good idea.

1691
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:52,220
Thank you man and so happy
and is going well right

1692
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,280
before he does it.

1693
00:42:55,370 --> 00:43:00,010
Does the UFC being acquired by
ESPN affect the fight pass and not

1694
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,700
cause?

1695
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,740
Are they going to continue
with the fight pass?

1696
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,393
Are you sure?

1697
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,410
As a matter of fact,

1698
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,860
the president of fight pass
when that deal went through,

1699
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,990
emailed me personally,

1700
00:43:10,991 --> 00:43:11,840
the let me know.

1701
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:12,261
He goes,

1702
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:12,920
listen,

1703
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,340
this is,

1704
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,410
this deal has nothing.

1705
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,583
This.

1706
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,650
Look at this game oversight body triangle.

1707
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:19,340
It's deep,

1708
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:19,761
deep,

1709
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:20,181
deep,

1710
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:20,601
deep,

1711
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:20,911
deep.

1712
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:21,171
Pat,

1713
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:22,700
can you hang in there for 40 seconds?

1714
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:23,420
I don't think so.

1715
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,590
Sino he's in trouble.

1716
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:25,790
He's got a,

1717
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:28,190
he's got a and he's
tapping into about the tap?

1718
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:28,491
No,

1719
00:43:28,491 --> 00:43:29,324
it's on the chin.

1720
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,280
Oh he's out.

1721
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:31,881
What's broke?

1722
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:32,330
His jaw.

1723
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,051
Damn.

1724
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:33,880
Yeah.

1725
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,030
That's what they said.

1726
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:39,500
Your boy problem you'd have to worry
about is now that people would have to

1727
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:40,460
subscribe to ESPN.

1728
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:43,160
Plus you get the full ESPN experience.

1729
00:43:43,161 --> 00:43:46,310
Now they're gonna have to
pay for that and fight paths.

1730
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,203
Is that real?

1731
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,373
That's real.

1732
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:52,340
So fipass doesn't really change it or
they're not getting rid of bypass it all.

1733
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:54,740
I don't like getting rid of it as far
as it grows and could be an issue.

1734
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,070
I think the fan base stays.

1735
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,080
How does that work though?

1736
00:43:57,081 --> 00:43:59,180
They're going to stream some
fights still on fight pass.

1737
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,073
No,

1738
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,183
I don't think so.

1739
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:06,190
What do you mean ESPN is going to take
all that content cause he cause you have

1740
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:10,680
right cause now ESPN plus and
ESPN platforms can have 30 fights.

1741
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,800
Then ESPN is going to have
12 paper use at least.

1742
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:14,150
So we have 42 fights a year now.

1743
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,680
So there's no,

1744
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:16,401
I could be wrong,

1745
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:17,540
Jamie car if I'm wrong,

1746
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:19,420
there's no fight pass card.

1747
00:44:19,421 --> 00:44:20,254
I don't think so.

1748
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,140
I think he's just give me a database
for stuff like Eddie's old school fight

1749
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:29,141
libraries and then you know that's I
so I don't think it's going to grow.

1750
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,460
I think it's going to continue.

1751
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,100
It's doing and stuff like Eddie's

1752
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,701
my grow.

1753
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:34,720
But people are mean.

1754
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,500
I'll see more ESPN plus packaging.

1755
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,630
That's a tough sell because I love it.

1756
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,800
I think five passes.

1757
00:44:40,801 --> 00:44:41,131
Awesome.

1758
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:44,190
And if you want to just go old school
and watch a bunch of great old fights is

1759
00:44:44,191 --> 00:44:46,380
the best format on the planet earth.

1760
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:47,470
If you're a hardcore figure,

1761
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,333
hardcore fan.

1762
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,820
But I liked the fact that
we'd have the prelims,

1763
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,090
some fights that you couldn't see
anywhere else but fight pass and then they

1764
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,800
would have certain fight pass cards.

1765
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,550
Well you win.

1766
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,940
How many times did we watch you
fight companions with the entire car?

1767
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,180
But now you can do it on these two up.

1768
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,063
Look at that shit.

1769
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:02,730
That is nothing.

1770
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,350
I can do it on ESPN plus jail.

1771
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:04,830
Yeah.

1772
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:05,310
Could be.

1773
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:05,630
Could be.

1774
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,260
You know you got to pay us Pam plus.

1775
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:08,123
Is that fine?

1776
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:08,620
Is that,

1777
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:08,850
yeah,

1778
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,650
but for another thing online,

1779
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:11,970
it's digital.

1780
00:45:11,971 --> 00:45:12,804
Espn pluses,

1781
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,883
digital APP.

1782
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:14,830
Eddie,

1783
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:16,560
what could he have same
as get out of this.

1784
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,090
What could he do to get out of this?

1785
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:18,924
Eddie,

1786
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,940
he's got a peel that arm off his neck.

1787
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,690
That's what I do late at this point,

1788
00:45:24,691 --> 00:45:25,100
right?

1789
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,510
I mean get an answer to that spot.

1790
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:28,783
A couple of things.

1791
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,460
You've got to protect your neck obviously
and then he's got to get up to the leg

1792
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:35,730
press position where he could get up
on like it's just doing a leg press,

1793
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:39,930
pushing back that it relieves some of
the pressure and then eventually get over

1794
00:45:39,931 --> 00:45:44,190
to the side of the cinched bottom
triangle and try to break that shit apart.

1795
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:44,810
Yeah,

1796
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:47,220
you gotta break those body
triangle is a partner to move fast.

1797
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:49,230
You got to prevent them from
happening in the first place.

1798
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:50,940
You've got to be soon as
someone takes your back.

1799
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,280
First thing is don't let it get too deep.

1800
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,510
And by two deep,

1801
00:45:54,511 --> 00:45:55,530
that means body trying,

1802
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,131
you know,

1803
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:57,180
don't let that shit happen.

1804
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:57,961
What were you to say,

1805
00:45:57,961 --> 00:45:58,500
Jamie?

1806
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:58,960
That uh,

1807
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,540
the fight pass thing and it's so,

1808
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:00,691
uh,

1809
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,790
the ESPN deal is us only it says,

1810
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,970
so that'd be for us broadcast only at
five past is still for the rest of the

1811
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:06,804
world.

1812
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:07,490
Does,

1813
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:08,323
that'd be the big difference.

1814
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:08,730
Yeah.

1815
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:09,563
Yeah.

1816
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:11,661
I didn't even ask.

1817
00:46:11,661 --> 00:46:11,990
They just said,

1818
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:12,320
dude,

1819
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,153
don't even trip.

1820
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:14,720
I don't know who they sent me.

1821
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,220
They sent me an email saying,

1822
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,210
don't worry about it.

1823
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:17,880
Uh,

1824
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,370
we,

1825
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:18,580
we're,

1826
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,330
we're not getting rid of a Ebi.

1827
00:46:20,331 --> 00:46:20,690
We,

1828
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:21,590
we'd love you.

1829
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:21,920
It's,

1830
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,310
it's,

1831
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:22,940
you know,

1832
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,990
don't even trip.

1833
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:24,291
Sure.

1834
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:25,124
That's for a raise.

1835
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,000
Did.

1836
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,890
And so that means in,

1837
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:30,860
so in America it's just going
to affect fight pass in the UFC.

1838
00:46:30,861 --> 00:46:31,630
Everyone else,

1839
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:32,463
they're good to go.

1840
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,200
But also they,

1841
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,280
there's no really paper views outside.

1842
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,080
Internationally,

1843
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,950
they get it for free.

1844
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:40,311
Like in Brazil,

1845
00:46:40,311 --> 00:46:40,521
all the,

1846
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:41,480
all the stuff's free.

1847
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,860
There's no paper used in Brazil.

1848
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,121
Right.

1849
00:46:44,121 --> 00:46:45,170
They're watching on global.

1850
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:45,321
Yeah.

1851
00:46:45,321 --> 00:46:46,000
They get it all free.

1852
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,833
It's right there.

1853
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,840
ESPN broadcast deal that includes 10
full UFC cards or primary ESPN channels,

1854
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:54,591
uh,

1855
00:46:54,591 --> 00:46:56,690
on primary USP ESPN channels.

1856
00:46:56,691 --> 00:46:57,231
ESPN,

1857
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:02,231
ESPN two along with the pre prelims
for a dozen UFC paper view events,

1858
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,860
another 25 cards.

1859
00:47:03,861 --> 00:47:08,720
We'll stream on ESPN plus totaling
30 full events annually between ESPN

1860
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,370
broadcasted streaming outlets.

1861
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:13,310
All full fight cards are
expected to have 12 bouts.

1862
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,713
Addition,

1863
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:18,990
additional and shoulder UFC programs
such as Dana White's contender series,

1864
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:24,650
a new all access series and pre and post
fight shows and more are also included

1865
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:25,310
in the deal.

1866
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:25,521
Oh,

1867
00:47:25,521 --> 00:47:26,354
that's interesting.

1868
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:27,830
10 tough is done.

1869
00:47:27,831 --> 00:47:29,090
So cap has done tough.

1870
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:30,010
Tough has done from my

1871
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,401
understanding.

1872
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:34,240
So did the Dana White's contenders shoes
was going to kind of be the focus now

1873
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,550
what do you know?

1874
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:35,021
Why would you,

1875
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:35,770
I think that's good.

1876
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,620
It's tough is a dying plus in mandate.

1877
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,690
Those dudes stay in that house for
six weeks and all that crazy shit.

1878
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,201
I don't like it.

1879
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:41,860
Who you tone.

1880
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,560
So they have,

1881
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,530
so even with DC and steep bay who are,

1882
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:44,890
you know,

1883
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,090
light heavyweight champion of the world,

1884
00:47:46,091 --> 00:47:46,924
heavy weight champ of the world.

1885
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,940
Those then you get the
insight on those guys.

1886
00:47:48,941 --> 00:47:50,350
Even those ratings suck Dick.

1887
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:51,430
It's just not going well.

1888
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:53,190
It's 27 seasons deed.

1889
00:47:53,191 --> 00:47:54,610
It's a tired format.

1890
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:54,821
Yeah,

1891
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:56,020
everyone's just over it and no more,

1892
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:57,310
no stars come from anymore.

1893
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:57,510
No.

1894
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,140
What's it called out?

1895
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,110
Your series is great.

1896
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:00,070
Contender series is good.

1897
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:01,340
Sean O'malley came from there.

1898
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,210
Greg Hardy fighting on that.

1899
00:48:03,211 --> 00:48:03,690
You got some,

1900
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:04,720
who is that guy that knocked out?

1901
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,490
Thiago Alves didn't he
come from there as well?

1902
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,460
A wrong about that.

1903
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,240
I'm not sure.

1904
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,010
The biggest one is Sean O'malley,

1905
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:15,450
but then you're also
going to have a homeboy.

1906
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,450
Why am I forgetting his name?

1907
00:48:16,451 --> 00:48:16,991
Sorry Dude.

1908
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:17,690
The guy with the,

1909
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:18,760
the with the arm.

1910
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:19,901
Come on nick.

1911
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:20,120
No,

1912
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,400
Nick Newell is finally win streak.

1913
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,253
Holy Shit.

1914
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,080
Nick knew it was going to beat the shit.

1915
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,000
Keep on the contenders.

1916
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,120
He should not be on there.

1917
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,140
You don't think so?

1918
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:29,760
God know.

1919
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,170
What do you think you for a world
title against just engaging,

1920
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,210
but it's good to get him exposure.

1921
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:35,410
Let people know how good he is.

1922
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:38,560
I guess it depends how many people
are watching contenders trees.

1923
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:42,010
You got some real
potential talent out there.

1924
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,010
I think the real thing about what's
interesting about the contender series is

1925
00:48:45,011 --> 00:48:47,860
now people you'd never
heard of are very good.

1926
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:48,611
I mean,

1927
00:48:48,611 --> 00:48:51,130
how many people do we know
that are just guys in the gym?

1928
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:51,731
They're like,

1929
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:52,001
dude,

1930
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:53,500
that guy's fucking good.

1931
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:53,680
Yeah,

1932
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,850
and they've never bought a break.

1933
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,000
They never fought or they've had one
amateur fight or something like that.

1934
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:01,420
But you realize like when you see
them roll with like really good guys,

1935
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:02,254
like Holy Shit,

1936
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,580
this guy's like just a hair
below a worldclass level.

1937
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,850
There's so many guys like that now
because it's one of those guys.

1938
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:10,781
No,

1939
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:10,841
no,

1940
00:49:10,841 --> 00:49:10,961
no.

1941
00:49:10,961 --> 00:49:11,651
And that's not what I'm saying.

1942
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:15,550
I'm saying he has the potential to
face one of those guys in the contender

1943
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:16,360
series.

1944
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,670
I almost think it,

1945
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,000
it's it.

1946
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:20,440
That's the opposite of
what they should be doing.

1947
00:49:20,441 --> 00:49:21,760
Because I found my young dude,

1948
00:49:21,761 --> 00:49:24,670
I'm trying to get my break in and I'm
on the contender contingencies and he'd

1949
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:28,810
give me nick news 17 five
to 17 and one fuck man,

1950
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:32,200
why can't I find a young guy and this
coming from a guy who had three fights,

1951
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,760
[inaudible] Roy Nelson the finale.

1952
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,300
That's true.

1953
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:34,541
I was like,

1954
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:35,470
what do you want to blow up?

1955
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:36,520
You gotta you gotta fight.

1956
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:37,571
That's true.

1957
00:49:37,571 --> 00:49:41,290
It's not like they're fighting
the UFC world champion.

1958
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:41,660
You know,

1959
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:42,493
you gotta

1960
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,770
you gotta go in there,

1961
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,290
but other kids are fighting
that constantly saying,

1962
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:47,951
I see what you're saying.

1963
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:49,250
It should be a lower Christian.

1964
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:49,511
Yeah.

1965
00:49:49,511 --> 00:49:50,380
For someone there going like,

1966
00:49:50,381 --> 00:49:50,591
dude,

1967
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,251
I get fucking,

1968
00:49:51,251 --> 00:49:52,420
I draw Nick Newell.

1969
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,890
Sean O'malley was fighting,

1970
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:54,671
guys have his same,

1971
00:49:54,671 --> 00:49:55,300
similar,

1972
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:55,931
blew it up,

1973
00:49:55,931 --> 00:49:56,890
just knocking dudes out.

1974
00:49:56,891 --> 00:49:57,740
Now he's a stock out.

1975
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,980
Maybe it'll be like one or two fights
and then they'll get nick in the UFC.

1976
00:50:00,981 --> 00:50:01,601
It should be one.

1977
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:03,110
So they're familiar with them,

1978
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,130
but he,

1979
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,520
he's going gonna be tough man.

1980
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,061
If he,

1981
00:50:07,061 --> 00:50:09,430
if he gets into that division
can be tough to beat.

1982
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,110
A lot of it's inspiring story too.

1983
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:11,590
I don't,

1984
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:11,920
I would,

1985
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,580
I would market the shit out with that man.

1986
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:13,870
Yeah.

1987
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,520
I think they're worried
that if he gets head kick,

1988
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:17,560
which he's never been knocked
out from the head kick,

1989
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,120
they're worried with his arm.

1990
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:19,341
Right.

1991
00:50:19,341 --> 00:50:20,174
If you can't defend it,

1992
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,610
he gets brutally knocked out.

1993
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,120
I'm like,

1994
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:22,690
how would you,

1995
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:24,100
how can you put that guy on TV?

1996
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,180
But you've got to realize too,

1997
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,830
think about how much your arm weighs.

1998
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:27,943
Like,

1999
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:28,010
I

2000
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:28,221
mean,

2001
00:50:28,221 --> 00:50:30,410
it's not an advantage by any
stretch of the imagination,

2002
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,050
but the rest of him is bigger and heavier.

2003
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,310
Like if,

2004
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:35,180
if what is,

2005
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,170
I mean,

2006
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:38,450
how much do you think
he's missing 10 pounds?

2007
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:38,910
You see?

2008
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:39,830
Know how much,

2009
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:40,830
how much does an average farm way,

2010
00:50:40,831 --> 00:50:41,240
Jamie,

2011
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,470
that's gotta be 10 pounds?

2012
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:42,981
No,

2013
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:43,551
eight pounds.

2014
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:44,384
Six pounds,

2015
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:45,200
dude,

2016
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,760
I think mine is about a hundred.

2017
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:48,890
How might,

2018
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:49,641
how seriously,

2019
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:50,900
like from his guys,

2020
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:51,531
the grapple,

2021
00:50:51,531 --> 00:50:55,430
there's a guy that grapples with that
leg and his upper body is that of like a

2022
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:57,740
dude that's two AP classes above the guys.

2023
00:50:57,741 --> 00:50:58,574
He's fighting,

2024
00:50:59,210 --> 00:50:59,691
what does it say,

2025
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:00,500
Jamie?

2026
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:00,951
Eight pounds.

2027
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:01,760
What?

2028
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,593
The whole arm.

2029
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,900
But that's the whole arm weighs
about 5% of your body weight.

2030
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:06,381
Okay.

2031
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:07,220
But that's the whole arm.

2032
00:51:07,221 --> 00:51:07,371
See,

2033
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:08,480
nick has the upper arm.

2034
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,160
He had cast down to the elbow
down past the elbows right here.

2035
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:13,940
So let's say his,

2036
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:14,390
yeah,

2037
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:15,620
it's not that big of an event.

2038
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,520
There was a rep,

2039
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,241
there's a wrestler,

2040
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,074
world champion.

2041
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:19,993
Connie's next.

2042
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:20,870
Oh Shit.

2043
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:21,880
But Jason,

2044
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,090
I fell on some tough times.

2045
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:25,340
He started off super hot
and then lost his last two.

2046
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:26,210
Who did he fight?

2047
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:27,500
He stepped way.

2048
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,600
Laura's law.

2049
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,610
That's realized.

2050
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:32,210
Crazy idea.

2051
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,850
That was crazy llamas.

2052
00:51:33,851 --> 00:51:36,500
His world title contender.

2053
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:39,570
No one wants to fucking names.

2054
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:43,010
You're going to fucking
monster all across the board.

2055
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:43,933
Yeah.

2056
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,231
Did I go?

2057
00:51:45,231 --> 00:51:45,670
Okay,

2058
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:46,520
you got llamas.

2059
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:47,563
You beat Shazam.

2060
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:48,403
Skelly.

2061
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:50,250
Pardot llamas too.

2062
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:51,530
He lost a Mowgli.

2063
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,401
Damn man.

2064
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:53,270
It's tough.

2065
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:58,330
He got knocked out and then he comes
back and he lost a Mowgli this of the

2066
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:00,920
night.

2067
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,731
This is a tough fight,

2068
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:02,030
man.

2069
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:05,720
Army mach one or my Connie might be the
toughest fight out of all three of those

2070
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:06,620
war than,

2071
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,580
Oh Ricardo Lamas.

2072
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:08,290
He's dangerous.

2073
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:09,610
This Ricardo Lamas.

2074
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:10,610
Yeah,

2075
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:11,181
you're right.

2076
00:52:11,181 --> 00:52:11,810
You're right.

2077
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,020
But this mock one armor.

2078
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,510
Connie's a wild motherfucker.

2079
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,950
He does a lot of crazy shit.

2080
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:19,580
Llamas just chills in the top
six but I mean he's just there.

2081
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:20,810
Well class get some.

2082
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,360
I'm going to have him on with his dad.

2083
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:26,180
A car alarm has been like leaving
him alone if he thinks I forgot.

2084
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:28,970
I haven't forgot his dad is a look.

2085
00:52:28,971 --> 00:52:30,050
A Cuban exile.

2086
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:33,560
His Dad left Cuba and
his dad Joe in here too.

2087
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:33,891
No,

2088
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:34,041
no,

2089
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:34,191
no.

2090
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:35,270
His Dad speaks perfect.

2091
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,550
He speaks perfect English and Spanish too.

2092
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:37,791
Yeah,

2093
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:38,690
I know Ricardo does.

2094
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:40,970
I get to talk to him.

2095
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:42,710
I just didn't want to fuck
with him before his fight.

2096
00:52:42,711 --> 00:52:43,521
He's got a big fight.

2097
00:52:43,521 --> 00:52:45,170
Makes Sense in Chicago.

2098
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,173
Yeah,

2099
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,860
that is very interesting.

2100
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:50,650
We were looking at the
commercial from UIC chick,

2101
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,640
Steve Bay versus Daniel Cormier.

2102
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:53,474
Yay.

2103
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:54,290
Great fight.

2104
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,123
Ooh,

2105
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:55,993
interesting.

2106
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:56,451
Tough.

2107
00:52:56,451 --> 00:52:57,830
What's the latest with Jon Jones?

2108
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,270
What's going on dude?

2109
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:00,720
I wish I knew still.

2110
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:05,310
He's still waiting to see what exactly
is spent in his but where does he's going

2111
00:53:05,311 --> 00:53:06,230
to fight,

2112
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:07,340
you know,

2113
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,090
fairly soon.

2114
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:08,810
Oh really?

2115
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,130
I route so hard for that dude.

2116
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,060
Me Too man.

2117
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,103
But why?

2118
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,940
Cause he's a beast to bad
mothers and I think in,

2119
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,300
I think in his heart he's a very good guy.

2120
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,150
I was getting to,

2121
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:18,650
yes,

2122
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:23,120
I really do mean that he does fucked
up things and he makes mistakes.

2123
00:53:23,121 --> 00:53:25,680
But I think John in his
heart is a very good guy.

2124
00:53:25,681 --> 00:53:26,040
I really

2125
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:26,251
do.

2126
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:29,640
I just think he just makes poor
choices and he's wild and you know,

2127
00:53:29,641 --> 00:53:29,781
and,

2128
00:53:29,781 --> 00:53:32,640
and one of the reasons why we
love them is that wildness.

2129
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:33,151
I liked that.

2130
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:33,571
He's wild.

2131
00:53:33,571 --> 00:53:33,721
Yeah,

2132
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:35,010
I don't like that he hurts people,

2133
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:36,010
but he is,

2134
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:37,810
it's typically when guys act like that,

2135
00:53:37,811 --> 00:53:39,360
I usually ride them off
like fuck that dude.

2136
00:53:39,361 --> 00:53:40,194
But with him,

2137
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:41,640
he's so talented.

2138
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,580
I literally think he's the best
of all time to raise the octagon.

2139
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,580
I want to see him back and I
think comes back at heavyweight.

2140
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,200
I think he beats the brakes off.

2141
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:49,561
Brock,

2142
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:50,311
I think he's come back.

2143
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:53,930
Fight is Brock and then he fights for
the heavyweight title against the winter.

2144
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,260
Steepy DC.

2145
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,330
That would be amazing.

2146
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,180
That's what I would do.

2147
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:01,440
This pen.

2148
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,131
You liked this deal.

2149
00:54:02,131 --> 00:54:03,060
Here's 2019

2150
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,880
did I have the apples?

2151
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:13,260
I had the weirdest dream that I was,

2152
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,670
that I had shorts on with no underwear
and are jerked off in my car.

2153
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,690
Oh No.

2154
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:22,620
I came all over myself and I couldn't
figure out what to do and then I had to go

2155
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:27,120
and meet some friends and I was outside
the door and for some reason Kyle

2156
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:27,953
Kingsbury was in there.

2157
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,513
I liked this problem.

2158
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:30,301
I'm like,

2159
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:32,760
I'm covered with my own TJ's
and I don't have any underwear.

2160
00:54:32,761 --> 00:54:33,940
And I just had my shorts on like,

2161
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,040
and then I woke up going,

2162
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:37,440
what the fuck is wrong
with a wet dream though?

2163
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,070
No.

2164
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:38,650
Really?

2165
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,100
You busted in your drill
is the weirdest dream.

2166
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:42,990
I've never had a dream.

2167
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,370
It's your job to my car.

2168
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:45,600
I've never had.

2169
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,500
Which car was it though?

2170
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:47,350
This is a big camper.

2171
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,111
The car,

2172
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:49,944
was it Joe?

2173
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:50,843
I don't know.

2174
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,630
I don't know.

2175
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:54,510
We had a dream where you
dropped off spark a jack.

2176
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:56,010
I've met Jim when I'm having sex.

2177
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:56,330
Yeah,

2178
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:56,731
of course.

2179
00:54:56,731 --> 00:54:57,690
It's my bed.

2180
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,263
It's like,

2181
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:00,691
wait a minute.

2182
00:55:00,691 --> 00:55:01,141
You had a dream,

2183
00:55:01,141 --> 00:55:04,050
you had sex and you're actually
busted up my wet dream.

2184
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:04,560
Eddie.

2185
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,440
I had those where a myth real.

2186
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:10,350
I had to figure out I was going to meet
some people and apparently didn't have

2187
00:55:10,351 --> 00:55:10,891
any underwear on.

2188
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:12,570
I didn't have a shirt on and I had know.

2189
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:13,290
I was like,

2190
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:14,730
I had to crack the door up and I'm like,

2191
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:14,911
dude,

2192
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:15,744
I've got a problem.

2193
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:16,040
Look,

2194
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,621
you got to help me up,

2195
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:17,580
and then I woke up going,

2196
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:18,331
what the fuck?

2197
00:55:18,331 --> 00:55:21,420
Kind of thought is that it's coming from.

2198
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,051
It's rare.

2199
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:23,130
I remember my dreams.

2200
00:55:23,131 --> 00:55:23,501
It's weird.

2201
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:24,181
Do you remember yours?

2202
00:55:24,181 --> 00:55:24,780
It's writ.

2203
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,400
I remember my last mine last night,

2204
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:27,120
I was walking around,

2205
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,740
I was backstage at Bella tour.

2206
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:31,140
I was going to fight someone I
can't remember and I was like,

2207
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:32,310
I'm not doing this.

2208
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:33,360
I mean it was like pleading to,

2209
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:34,213
I'm not going to do it.

2210
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,510
I'm not fucking ready man.

2211
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:37,200
I'm going to do that.

2212
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,130
I don't need this.

2213
00:55:38,131 --> 00:55:38,401
I'm like,

2214
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,590
are you going to go out there?

2215
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:40,980
I'm like,

2216
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:41,880
no.

2217
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:44,100
That's a weird thing.

2218
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,060
That's like one of them.

2219
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,310
I got to go back to high
school and graduate thing,

2220
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,050
have those dreams,

2221
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:54,550
all that you can never remember your your
locker combination for your locker and

2222
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,070
like how do I open this motherfucker?

2223
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:56,681
My dream,

2224
00:55:56,681 --> 00:55:58,110
my nightmares were credits.

2225
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:58,973
I was too,

2226
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,520
too many credits shy of graduating high
school and they were making me go back

2227
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:03,354
another year.

2228
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:03,820
You're not?

2229
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:04,650
No.

2230
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:05,550
You graduate high school.

2231
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:06,151
I did.

2232
00:56:06,151 --> 00:56:08,040
But you remember like when you,

2233
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:11,100
when you were in high school there was
always that one dude that somehow or

2234
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:13,590
another fucked up and had
to repeat the senior year.

2235
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:17,950
So he's 18 everybody else's 17 is
fucking dude is in high schools.

2236
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:20,220
The jeep wrangler just sad.

2237
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,430
He's sad.

2238
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:23,700
He's losing a year of his light workout.

2239
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,700
I have this recurring nightmare that I
don't think it's a post to be a nightmare

2240
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:29,380
I think is supposed to be a great dream.

2241
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:32,830
But it always turns into a nightmare
because like when I used to Dj at Strip

2242
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:33,280
clubs,

2243
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,420
I had a good time.

2244
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:37,390
It was always fun and
then I dream about it.

2245
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,380
I dream about it.

2246
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,010
And the,

2247
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:42,790
the problem is to be a strip club Dj,

2248
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,750
you got to,

2249
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,290
you got to know your cds and the girls
that are going up and you're matching up

2250
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:48,160
the songs with the girls,

2251
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:50,250
you gotta be sharp because they
all want those different songs.

2252
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:50,801
Exactly.

2253
00:56:50,801 --> 00:56:51,700
So in my dream,

2254
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,470
I think it's supposed to be a great train,

2255
00:56:53,471 --> 00:56:56,980
but I can never read the cds
and the managers get mad at me.

2256
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:57,631
I'm like,

2257
00:56:57,631 --> 00:56:58,960
I'm like what girls on stage?

2258
00:56:58,961 --> 00:56:59,500
And I'm like,

2259
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,333
I'm going.

2260
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,290
And the only CB that I remember,

2261
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:06,370
the only one is the crystal method
because that was my goto CD.

2262
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:07,540
No other cds.

2263
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:07,840
I'm like,

2264
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,270
oh I could always pull that
one out as your default.

2265
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:10,721
Yeah.

2266
00:57:10,721 --> 00:57:15,010
Cause you know you got to change the
song every two minutes and 45 seconds

2267
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:16,970
because every song means money for,

2268
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:17,630
for the club.

2269
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:18,730
They're all getting lap dances.

2270
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,590
So if you let a song go three and a half,

2271
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,220
four minutes,

2272
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,630
the manager get on your ass,

2273
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,291
what the fuck?

2274
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:24,330
It's three and a half minutes.

2275
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:25,750
It's very stressful.

2276
00:57:25,751 --> 00:57:26,560
So if there's a girl,

2277
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,970
a girl bust about to go on stage and
15 seconds before she goes on stage,

2278
00:57:30,971 --> 00:57:31,530
she goes,

2279
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:32,111
skip me.

2280
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:33,780
I got a lap dance and we're fucked up.

2281
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:34,150
I'm like,

2282
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:34,780
Oh shit.

2283
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,460
I got 15 seconds to find
a replacement and to,

2284
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:38,720
to change the this.

2285
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:39,280
I got a plan.

2286
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:39,520
Yeah.

2287
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,860
So in my dream I'm having
a fucking nightmare.

2288
00:57:41,861 --> 00:57:42,131
I'm like,

2289
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:45,360
I can't see the girl on stage
and I can't see my sister.

2290
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:46,800
Yeah,

2291
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,670
it's a total nine.

2292
00:57:47,671 --> 00:57:47,861
I'm like,

2293
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:48,251
Oh my God,

2294
00:57:48,251 --> 00:57:49,090
I'm gonna get fired.

2295
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,230
What am I going to do now?

2296
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:55,810
I never figured in my dream ever do
I realize that I make money teaching

2297
00:57:55,811 --> 00:57:56,261
Jujitsu.

2298
00:57:56,261 --> 00:57:56,950
Never.

2299
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:58,300
It's always I lose my job,

2300
00:57:58,301 --> 00:57:58,420
my,

2301
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,590
what am I going to do now?

2302
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,350
And then I wake up,

2303
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:00,580
I'm like,

2304
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:00,970
ah,

2305
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:02,050
I teach Jiu Jitsu.

2306
00:58:02,051 --> 00:58:02,884
I'm fine.

2307
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:10,600
You're the one in between the tracks by
guidelines and Joe and bring up Dandy on

2308
00:58:10,601 --> 00:58:11,680
stage seven.

2309
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:12,850
But he never did it that way.

2310
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,260
He didn't have the fig strip club.

2311
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:14,771
Oh No,

2312
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:14,861
no,

2313
00:58:14,861 --> 00:58:14,981
no.

2314
00:58:14,981 --> 00:58:15,814
I did.

2315
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:16,890
You have to have the faith.

2316
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:17,350
No,

2317
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:18,220
you have to have it,

2318
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:21,070
but you have to because
if you talk regularly,

2319
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:22,301
no,

2320
00:58:22,301 --> 00:58:23,020
it was always,

2321
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,270
it was always my Simpsons.

2322
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,650
Dj Strip clubbing.

2323
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:28,210
All right guys.

2324
00:58:28,211 --> 00:58:30,340
Put those hands together for London.

2325
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,980
Oh No.

2326
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,920
But you have to say you have to do
that goofy voice to cut through.

2327
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:37,180
Otherwise people can't hear you.

2328
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,540
If you just get on a mic and a strip
club and you just talk like Kelly's on

2329
00:58:40,541 --> 00:58:41,430
table seven over,

2330
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:42,650
they won't cut through.

2331
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,750
They won't cut through.

2332
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:43,871
Well,

2333
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:44,471
not only that,

2334
00:58:44,471 --> 00:58:45,970
like it has to have some drama to it.

2335
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:46,570
Right.

2336
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:47,291
You can't just go,

2337
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:47,471
oh,

2338
00:58:47,471 --> 00:58:48,400
here's Monica.

2339
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:49,870
She doesn't like doing this job,

2340
00:58:49,871 --> 00:58:50,780
but here show you guys.

2341
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,790
You got to have that check
or that there's disease.

2342
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,400
She's got some unfortunate
to goofy's Jason.

2343
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,500
Hopefully she'll find a good guy.

2344
00:58:57,501 --> 00:58:58,130
I leave this job.

2345
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,650
Chels made some terrible decisions.

2346
00:58:59,651 --> 00:59:03,460
Checked her out table
that that is unfortunate.

2347
00:59:03,461 --> 00:59:05,020
But now you gotta go all out

2348
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:09,083
childhood.

2349
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:12,460
She's been in bed 25 foster homes.

2350
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:13,450
Just hook her up.

2351
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:14,863
Just come on.

2352
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,313
Jason Knight.

2353
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:18,970
Tough motherfucker.

2354
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:20,403
That's fairly common.

2355
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,070
The Country Diaz

2356
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,300
look at that fucking knows.

2357
00:59:23,301 --> 00:59:25,190
Man That knows his to take it.

2358
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:25,791
Some punches,

2359
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:26,624
son,

2360
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:27,200
he ran his name,

2361
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,440
his nickname the country does,

2362
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:32,150
cause he's very similarly the Diaz
brothers minus the domestic abuse charges.

2363
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:32,421
Well,

2364
00:59:32,421 --> 00:59:33,530
very fucking debt.

2365
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:35,270
Domestic abuse thing is bomber man.

2366
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,070
W do we don't know the facts though.

2367
00:59:37,071 --> 00:59:40,250
Dewey Jail Knicks guys sent me something.

2368
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,290
Those friend data.

2369
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:41,600
Yeah.

2370
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,710
Dating some girl.

2371
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:43,580
It doesn't cast now

2372
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,860
she's actually a stalker and really good.

2373
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:47,840
He's a really good person.

2374
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:48,540
I'm like,

2375
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,211
Oh fuck you're.

2376
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,060
Thanks Bro.

2377
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:51,010
Yeah.

2378
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:52,240
Did Jason Knight um,

2379
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,810
nasty off his back?

2380
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:54,150
Yeah.

2381
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:56,280
Great glass quick.

2382
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,010
He's an Alan Belcher student.

2383
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:02,160
Alan Belcher's Jujitsu is
pretty awesome for MMA.

2384
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:04,100
This kid's been talking so much shit.

2385
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,140
Americani Mr Finland,

2386
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:09,550
he's talking so much Belcher versus uh,

2387
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,410
Theresa Rusa Mar porous.

2388
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:13,340
We beat the shower.

2389
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:16,990
One of the greatest fights
of all fucking thigh.

2390
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,090
But everybody was scared of that.

2391
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,450
I saw him a week later.

2392
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:20,510
Right in there.

2393
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:21,080
We put them in.

2394
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:21,800
He had it rude.

2395
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,570
Some are in a twist into it.

2396
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:25,790
I saw him a week later and
I was so impressed by it.

2397
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:26,624
I scared him.

2398
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:28,360
Or You thought he was Mike Tyson?

2399
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:28,941
I was like,

2400
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:29,571
Bro,

2401
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:30,890
it's like Jesus Christ.

2402
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:36,190
What you did was insane and
small at the time in a twister.

2403
01:00:37,131 --> 01:00:38,090
He had them in the truck,

2404
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,230
almost finished him.

2405
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:40,850
Rusa Mar gets out,

2406
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:41,570
gets out,

2407
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,040
has Alan Belcher,

2408
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:48,220
all sorts of leg lock trouble and Al
Belter just dismantled all that shit and

2409
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:50,090
beat the fuck out.

2410
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:53,210
Dean lister and who else
was it Tom to blast?

2411
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:53,570
No,

2412
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:54,290
he brought in,

2413
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:54,620
uh,

2414
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,670
for that fight for a month.

2415
01:00:55,671 --> 01:00:58,250
He brought in deanlets during
Dobby Ramos who's in the UFC.

2416
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,860
That'd be Ramos is really
good at like locks too.

2417
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,250
So he had,

2418
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,020
he had,

2419
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,130
he had dean Lester Dobby.

2420
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:05,750
Ron was on his legs for a month.

2421
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:08,360
He said the first two weeks he
tapped out probably 500 times,

2422
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,840
but then he started learning how to
stop the leg locks to the a month.

2423
01:01:11,841 --> 01:01:12,740
Then he went into it,

2424
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:14,510
beat the shit out and then he made,

2425
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,820
he made a DVD called immunity.

2426
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,130
How to stop lag la.

2427
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:20,660
Remember that immunity?

2428
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:21,800
Alan Belcher.

2429
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,970
Like he's over there talking,

2430
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,120
dude,

2431
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:24,761
I'm telling you homeboy,

2432
01:01:24,761 --> 01:01:26,090
he's talking so much shit.

2433
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,260
Then when they did the posts,

2434
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:28,131
you know Wayne's,

2435
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:28,964
when they always interview,

2436
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:29,571
he was like,

2437
01:01:29,571 --> 01:01:30,920
I'm going to beat the shit out of him.

2438
01:01:30,921 --> 01:01:32,150
He was going hard in the pace.

2439
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:36,680
Well Jason Knight is one of the few
fighters in the UFC where they can't show

2440
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:37,514
his flag.

2441
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:42,020
Was this flags get the fucking Mississippi
still has the confederate flag and

2442
01:01:42,021 --> 01:01:42,530
their state.

2443
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:42,651
Yeah,

2444
01:01:42,651 --> 01:01:43,550
they're proud of that shit.

2445
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:43,911
Jamie,

2446
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:46,510
can you get the fight on
that screen as well please?

2447
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:47,840
That is it.

2448
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,430
That is fucking crazy.

2449
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,770
Which satisfy the night written all
over his big ass screen right here.

2450
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:55,160
Sharp while Y'all turned
my my next all stiff.

2451
01:01:55,161 --> 01:01:56,920
What are we doing it right?

2452
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:57,320
They're like,

2453
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,970
oh fuck three screens in here.

2454
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:00,470
This is like a God damn sports bar.

2455
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:02,480
It's like we're at buffalo
wild wings minus the wings.

2456
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,960
This is a very,

2457
01:02:05,961 --> 01:02:07,010
very interesting fight.

2458
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:08,720
Amir Khan.

2459
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,830
He's been talking crazy shit,

2460
01:02:09,831 --> 01:02:10,070
huh?

2461
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:12,110
Oh dude was going so hard in the paint.

2462
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,651
He goes,

2463
01:02:12,651 --> 01:02:15,590
this is a long trip for you to come
just for one round to get knocked out.

2464
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:16,970
She's going super hard.

2465
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:20,220
Then you just trying to get them
emotional cause he from England?

2466
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:22,201
Yeah.

2467
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:22,711
Does he live in?

2468
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:23,010
No,

2469
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:23,880
he lives in Finland.

2470
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:24,451
We did it.

2471
01:02:24,451 --> 01:02:26,100
At least he did for a while.

2472
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:27,340
I don't know he,

2473
01:02:27,341 --> 01:02:29,910
they used to call him
Mister Finland I think.

2474
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:30,450
I think,

2475
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:30,691
yeah.

2476
01:02:30,691 --> 01:02:30,961
Nights.

2477
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:31,830
The underdog here.

2478
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:34,420
Okay.

2479
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:37,570
Well I mean he kind of has to be
after those two losses in a row,

2480
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:43,470
but our mayor Connie was a guy who burst
on the scene a few years back and you

2481
01:02:43,841 --> 01:02:44,021
know,

2482
01:02:44,021 --> 01:02:45,340
was really promising.

2483
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:46,690
But we haven't yet.

2484
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,400
People don't talk about it much.

2485
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:49,573
Oh No.

2486
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:50,493
They will feel,

2487
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:52,390
oh shit.

2488
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:52,961
Oh,

2489
01:02:52,961 --> 01:02:53,440
jump on him.

2490
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,210
Oh good.

2491
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:56,170
Happy Guard America.

2492
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,190
This isn't what he wants.

2493
01:02:57,191 --> 01:03:00,100
You don't want to get in these scrambles
and this straight up cockfight with

2494
01:03:00,101 --> 01:03:02,070
your with nightmares pulled.

2495
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:02,770
Guard quit.

2496
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:02,940
Yeah.

2497
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:05,430
Tony want to them to look at that.

2498
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:06,520
Please don't do that.

2499
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:09,220
He's controlling his biceps
and talking shit to him.

2500
01:03:09,221 --> 01:03:09,430
Hit.

2501
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:10,360
Don't do that though.

2502
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:10,961
Oh,

2503
01:03:10,961 --> 01:03:11,800
good posture.

2504
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:16,090
And he did a good job at avoiding
any kind of guard attacks.

2505
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:16,421
Yeah.

2506
01:03:16,421 --> 01:03:19,030
The way he did that by
planting down those biceps,

2507
01:03:19,031 --> 01:03:20,530
a very small slice of control,

2508
01:03:20,531 --> 01:03:23,260
and then he postured up at the
permit time broke through those legs.

2509
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,200
He's been doing his homework
and he's telling him that too,

2510
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:26,351
like,

2511
01:03:26,351 --> 01:03:27,640
you ain't getting shit off on me.

2512
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,440
Let's snake tattoo hanging
over his shoulders.

2513
01:03:29,441 --> 01:03:30,274
Interesting.

2514
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,590
It's like a Mandy to the main stage.

2515
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,431
Yes.

2516
01:03:33,431 --> 01:03:34,550
It's very similar.

2517
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:41,323
Just talking.

2518
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,620
We got hurt.

2519
01:03:42,621 --> 01:03:43,220
He got hurt.

2520
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:43,420
He's,

2521
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:46,280
you get a motion jabs or touching him.

2522
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,480
He was having a problem with that.

2523
01:03:47,481 --> 01:03:48,111
I did.

2524
01:03:48,111 --> 01:03:50,030
He has a lot of scar tissue on his face.

2525
01:03:50,031 --> 01:03:53,250
If you look at his face like she looks
like a great whites knows it's fucking,

2526
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,190
it's just all sorts of
shit all over as well.

2527
01:03:55,191 --> 01:03:56,060
That style,

2528
01:03:56,061 --> 01:03:59,300
I mean that crazy bulldog style
doesn't really work these days,

2529
01:03:59,301 --> 01:03:59,541
man.

2530
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:01,640
Once you get to upper echelon level,

2531
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,730
it works until you,

2532
01:04:02,731 --> 01:04:06,710
you can't take a shot anymore because
your workspace just gets smashed in too

2533
01:04:06,711 --> 01:04:07,544
much.

2534
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:08,001
Then when you get,

2535
01:04:08,001 --> 01:04:09,050
the technicians are like,

2536
01:04:09,051 --> 01:04:09,470
all right,

2537
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,190
cool man.

2538
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:11,510
That's just engage you.

2539
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:12,170
Exactly.

2540
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:12,861
That's what you want to do.

2541
01:04:12,861 --> 01:04:13,694
Cool.

2542
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:14,810
Yeah.

2543
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,010
Guys just are smart.

2544
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,180
He's mock.

2545
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:21,530
Juan just keeps looking for that right
hook counter and he's doing it real nice.

2546
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:22,430
I like what he's doing.

2547
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,390
I like his jab to Oh,

2548
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:24,310
there you go.

2549
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:27,790
Oh,

2550
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:28,620
I'm here.

2551
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:29,930
Connie is a good wrestler too,

2552
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:30,861
is very good.

2553
01:04:30,861 --> 01:04:31,240
Yeah,

2554
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,073
that's his background.

2555
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:32,901
Oh Shit.

2556
01:04:32,901 --> 01:04:33,734
Okay.

2557
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,340
He just keeps more of that damn.

2558
01:04:39,341 --> 01:04:40,174
Look at them.

2559
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:43,320
It's comfortable in there.

2560
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:44,461
Did it.

2561
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:45,600
That leg kick hurt him.

2562
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,650
You think that inside one,

2563
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:47,521
it always hurts.

2564
01:04:47,521 --> 01:04:48,450
I think sucks.

2565
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:50,820
Especially when you get
kicked right above the knee.

2566
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:51,340
Oh,

2567
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,750
that's a fucking terrible feeling.

2568
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:57,390
It just feels like you're hoping your
your ligament stay together and they do.

2569
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:57,721
Dude.

2570
01:04:57,721 --> 01:04:58,500
How much always do,

2571
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,850
but every time you get hit,

2572
01:04:59,851 --> 01:05:00,150
they're like,

2573
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:02,550
oh damn.

2574
01:05:02,551 --> 01:05:03,210
Wheel kicks.

2575
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:03,391
Dude.

2576
01:05:03,391 --> 01:05:05,970
How about Amanda Nunez Kicks
Against Raquel Pennington.

2577
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:07,260
Pentance at that first cake.

2578
01:05:07,261 --> 01:05:08,250
She had surgery on that.

2579
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:09,360
Oh Shit.

2580
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:12,150
Doodie stomped right on that knee
and folded them a little bit.

2581
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:15,300
You see that he's throwing
a nice variety of kicks.

2582
01:05:15,301 --> 01:05:16,020
I liked that.

2583
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:16,201
Well,

2584
01:05:16,201 --> 01:05:17,034
he's got to do that.

2585
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:17,890
Get guys,

2586
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:18,220
guys

2587
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,001
that are fighting the day,

2588
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:22,840
there's a whole bunch of them that
they don't really any kicks still.

2589
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:25,060
They're still out there and they
don't throw anything at the,

2590
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:25,894
at the light,

2591
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:27,370
at the latter levels.

2592
01:05:27,371 --> 01:05:28,860
They kind of mix it all up cause you have,

2593
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:32,600
you shouldn't mix heavyweight
tegular cause you know what you know,

2594
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:35,770
you know I love Damien Maia fucking
more than any other fighter out there,

2595
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:36,080
right.

2596
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,660
I think bye bye now.

2597
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:41,790
Oh Shit.

2598
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:44,380
Oh Damn.

2599
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:45,580
Damn God,

2600
01:05:45,581 --> 01:05:46,570
we should have stayed on top.

2601
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,310
You should have stayed on top.

2602
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:49,680
I'm still her.

2603
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:49,870
No,

2604
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:50,703
he's still hurt.

2605
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:51,581
Amir Khan.

2606
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:52,414
He's still hurt.

2607
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:53,800
He got fucked up coach.

2608
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:54,930
Oh Shit.

2609
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:56,110
He cracked him.

2610
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:57,263
Oh

2611
01:05:58,370 --> 01:05:59,203
no shit.

2612
01:05:59,240 --> 01:05:59,690
That was,

2613
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:00,523
he didn't go.

2614
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:02,660
Oh Shit Dude.

2615
01:06:02,661 --> 01:06:04,040
What the fuck is he doing?

2616
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:05,720
He likes fighting off his back.

2617
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,670
He likes his recovering.

2618
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:07,881
Yeah,

2619
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:08,211
but look,

2620
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:09,380
he's in mission control here.

2621
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,480
This ain't bad.

2622
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,313
I say bad at all

2623
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,113
right there.

2624
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:16,820
Just triangle his legs.

2625
01:06:16,821 --> 01:06:17,750
It's all he's got to do.

2626
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:19,103
Oh,

2627
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,780
it'd be triangle this legs.

2628
01:06:20,781 --> 01:06:21,830
You'd get them in a dead orchard.

2629
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:25,320
Does he know singling out that?

2630
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:26,180
Yeah,

2631
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:26,930
he knows it.

2632
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:28,550
But what he's trying to
do is clear the neck.

2633
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:29,720
That's the main thing is trying to do.

2634
01:06:29,721 --> 01:06:30,201
He's going to try,

2635
01:06:30,201 --> 01:06:34,490
he's trying to get invisible collar at
this point or some kind of meat hook or

2636
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:36,320
something with a stupid,

2637
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:37,183
he's got,

2638
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:39,060
oh shit.

2639
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,633
He's got them.

2640
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,470
He's got a 10 seconds.

2641
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:46,310
He's got them in Vertiv.

2642
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:47,291
Oh,

2643
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:48,011
he got out.

2644
01:06:48,011 --> 01:06:48,660
Shit.

2645
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:49,600
Look at that Dark Hilton.

2646
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:50,483
Go for it.

2647
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:51,983
10 seconds.

2648
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:52,953
You're couple of shots.

2649
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:55,381
Look at him.

2650
01:06:55,381 --> 01:06:56,214
Look at him.

2651
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,553
Awesome.

2652
01:06:57,740 --> 01:06:58,860
You ain't talking shit anymore.

2653
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,720
How about he started talking shit.

2654
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:01,720
How about he stood up?

2655
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,553
Starts I can shoot

2656
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:04,763
this kid.

2657
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:05,751
Oh,

2658
01:07:05,751 --> 01:07:07,950
you went to the wrong corner down.

2659
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,823
They

2660
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,271
fucked up.

2661
01:07:12,271 --> 01:07:13,030
That was awesome.

2662
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:15,320
But getting British based on the
night caught him with some good shots.

2663
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:16,913
Hurt him badly.

2664
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,833
Hurt them bad.

2665
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,780
40 seconds left to fucking
go down to guard like,

2666
01:07:21,781 --> 01:07:23,580
I don't care if you liked
it or not a bad idea.

2667
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:24,803
I'm going to triangle.

2668
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:25,710
Ah,

2669
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:26,311
is that a man?

2670
01:07:26,311 --> 01:07:27,690
If that fight was two minutes longer,

2671
01:07:27,691 --> 01:07:28,740
he could have caught him in something.

2672
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:30,060
He was scrambling.

2673
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,890
You've got 30 seconds on top of him.

2674
01:07:31,891 --> 01:07:34,490
30 you know how hard it is
to get a finished 30 seconds.

2675
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,040
It all depends on is it the way

2676
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:43,020
only a of pulling guard.

2677
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,580
It's so suicidal.

2678
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:45,443
Like people say.

2679
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:47,023
Why?

2680
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:50,070
Why is it so hard for
Damien Maia to pull guard?

2681
01:07:50,071 --> 01:07:50,880
He'll sit on his button.

2682
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,140
People don't want to get on top of them.

2683
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:52,560
Yeah,

2684
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,840
they make us stand at that.

2685
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:54,840
Look at that.

2686
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,673
Cause that's literally

2687
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,200
my kids can't win any other way here we go

2688
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,620
round to Emmett.

2689
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,220
Connie got fucked up in
that first weekend night.

2690
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,140
Did he still confident?

2691
01:08:10,141 --> 01:08:13,440
But he's a little bit like off fuck and
Emmer Connie still make taking big deep

2692
01:08:13,441 --> 01:08:13,890
breaths.

2693
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:14,131
Dude.

2694
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:14,964
He got hurt.

2695
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:16,100
That

2696
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,110
one uppercut really fucked him up.

2697
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,470
Anyone else just ripped
my hardest fuck for night.

2698
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:23,761
Yeah,

2699
01:08:23,761 --> 01:08:24,511
I'm at right now.

2700
01:08:24,511 --> 01:08:25,344
Right.

2701
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,520
Well marked on a at Connie's.

2702
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:29,520
He's a tough guy.

2703
01:08:29,521 --> 01:08:30,510
I like watching him fight,

2704
01:08:30,511 --> 01:08:34,590
but I also like a guy coming
back from two two fights down.

2705
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,030
Did you lose three in a row?

2706
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:36,301
It'd be,

2707
01:08:36,301 --> 01:08:36,901
it'd be tough.

2708
01:08:36,901 --> 01:08:38,070
His career be in trouble,

2709
01:08:38,071 --> 01:08:38,904
man.

2710
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:40,570
Well these findings,

2711
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:41,680
the one I've seen him,

2712
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,550
how dare you dude.

2713
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:46,870
One FC is putting on some
good fucking shows God boys

2714
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:49,661
get to,

2715
01:08:49,661 --> 01:08:51,690
but can be into the UFC
and there's Bella Tor.

2716
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,530
He's like,

2717
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:55,580
the problem with one fc
is just about exposure.

2718
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,110
They've got some great Thai
fighters over there in Asia.

2719
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:00,410
One FC is huge,

2720
01:09:00,411 --> 01:09:00,861
huge,

2721
01:09:00,861 --> 01:09:04,640
huge to this giant reaches
like a billion households.

2722
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:04,941
Yeah.

2723
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:05,661
Beth Gaskins.

2724
01:09:05,661 --> 01:09:06,500
Huge Star.

2725
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:07,430
No,

2726
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:08,121
that in Asia.

2727
01:09:08,121 --> 01:09:08,954
He is,

2728
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:10,010
oh,

2729
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:12,510
look at this talking to you,

2730
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,950
a seasoned agents to now son.

2731
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:15,290
Yeah,

2732
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:15,651
it is.

2733
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:16,770
But one FC.

2734
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:17,601
I'm telling you,

2735
01:09:17,601 --> 01:09:18,050
Brendan,

2736
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,490
it is very big overseas.

2737
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:19,761
I know.

2738
01:09:19,761 --> 01:09:20,570
It's big.

2739
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,351
I know it's big.

2740
01:09:21,351 --> 01:09:22,184
If you're not in the UFC,

2741
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:23,990
if you're not in the UFC,

2742
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:25,130
it's a tough goal,

2743
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:25,610
man.

2744
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:26,443
It is.

2745
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,411
It's a tough go.

2746
01:09:27,411 --> 01:09:28,280
But it's not over.

2747
01:09:28,281 --> 01:09:30,800
One FC is catching up in Asia.

2748
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:32,361
I mean,

2749
01:09:32,361 --> 01:09:34,280
they're bigger than
Bellah tours over there.

2750
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:34,680
They're building.

2751
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,690
It doesn't really do age.

2752
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,533
Exactly,

2753
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:37,940
but that's our number two.

2754
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:38,270
Right.

2755
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:40,140
Or number two in America's Beltour.

2756
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:40,750
Well,

2757
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:41,470
no,

2758
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:41,840
no,

2759
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,621
towards getting bigger.

2760
01:09:42,621 --> 01:09:43,040
Right.

2761
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:43,550
It's bigger.

2762
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:43,761
I mean,

2763
01:09:43,761 --> 01:09:44,450
they're in Europe.

2764
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:46,930
They're obviously just had that card
and one what they're heavyweights,

2765
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:47,450
uh,

2766
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:48,230
uh,

2767
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:48,621
tournament.

2768
01:09:48,621 --> 01:09:49,041
They're doing it.

2769
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:50,000
They're killing it right now.

2770
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:51,210
Yeah.

2771
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:52,760
You got jail fade or coming up.

2772
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,590
You got Ryan Bader Mitrione but
they need a heavyweight champion.

2773
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:55,740
Yeah,

2774
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:56,001
Michael.

2775
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:56,751
Then in page,

2776
01:09:56,751 --> 01:09:58,260
you see that they don't
have a heavyweight champion.

2777
01:09:58,270 --> 01:09:58,971
Can I have one now?

2778
01:09:58,971 --> 01:09:59,580
Under the year?

2779
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:00,240
Yeah.

2780
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:00,490
Great.

2781
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:01,340
That many big guys.

2782
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,211
It's Ryan Bader.

2783
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:03,110
It could be issues,

2784
01:10:03,111 --> 01:10:03,351
right?

2785
01:10:03,351 --> 01:10:05,540
Because he's a light heavyweight and
he's the light heavyweight champ,

2786
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:08,850
but maybe fights better at at heavyweight
than he does it line everywhere.

2787
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:09,713
It's true.

2788
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,480
She felt Davis' head kick Kale.

2789
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:12,970
That was crazy.

2790
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:13,761
Davis looks good.

2791
01:10:13,761 --> 01:10:14,594
That was nasty.

2792
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:17,990
Amir Khan.

2793
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:18,630
Ooh.

2794
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:19,920
Inside night talking shit.

2795
01:10:19,921 --> 01:10:21,100
Now I have some comments.

2796
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,020
Americani got that Nice Jab,

2797
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,340
right Hook Combo.

2798
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:26,690
Yeah.

2799
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:29,310
That right hand he throws
this looks for that show.

2800
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:29,970
We clipped him.

2801
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:30,570
Damn.

2802
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:31,440
He's got a good ride,

2803
01:10:31,441 --> 01:10:31,680
Huh?

2804
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,161
Oh,

2805
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:33,630
nice uppercut to we mixed it up.

2806
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,570
We're missing Colorado going,

2807
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:38,841
God,

2808
01:10:38,841 --> 01:10:39,680
these guys are sweat.

2809
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,180
Why doesn't he just hit
him with a right hand?

2810
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:42,380
Yeah.

2811
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:42,621
Cal.

2812
01:10:42,621 --> 01:10:43,101
You'd be like,

2813
01:10:43,101 --> 01:10:43,241
why?

2814
01:10:43,241 --> 01:10:43,551
What is it?

2815
01:10:43,551 --> 01:10:44,590
You just know Calico cat.

2816
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:45,493
Keep your hands up.

2817
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,700
Why does he throw the front kick?

2818
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:47,220
Oh,

2819
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:48,200
shoot him again.

2820
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:49,720
He's hurt,

2821
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:50,290
guilt,

2822
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:53,750
guilty and coming in hot note pads again.

2823
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:55,533
Yeah.

2824
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,710
You can't get it as a triangle on the
body and doing a good job at defending

2825
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:04,491
you.

2826
01:11:04,491 --> 01:11:05,540
Want to give that first round 10,

2827
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:05,691
eight.

2828
01:11:05,691 --> 01:11:06,524
What'd you

2829
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:08,780
Nah,

2830
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:09,230
no,

2831
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:09,950
no.

2832
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:12,280
Maybe he might been down
the rules with the number.

2833
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:13,403
What's the new rule?

2834
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,190
The new

2835
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:15,270
a scoring system.

2836
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:15,950
What is it?

2837
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:16,120
It,

2838
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,070
the new scoring system is when
you show like a clear advantage,

2839
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,660
you'd have to have someone look at it.

2840
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:26,930
But a clear advantage is the difference
between like winning and winning.

2841
01:11:27,331 --> 01:11:29,670
Like clearly he clearly
won that first round.

2842
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:31,560
I would have to look at it like how they,

2843
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:32,341
how they,

2844
01:11:32,341 --> 01:11:32,790
uh,

2845
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:33,271
frame it.

2846
01:11:33,271 --> 01:11:37,350
Now I think we have a real problem being
imprisoned by that 10 point system.

2847
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:39,360
I think the 10 point system is stupid.

2848
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,860
Pretty much happened there.

2849
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:46,130
What do you think about
the recently there's been a
bunch of early standups from

2850
01:11:46,441 --> 01:11:51,441
the ground while the Leon Roberts
one with Damien Maia and uh,

2851
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:52,500
uh,

2852
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,030
Huseman was ridiculous.

2853
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,540
What the wizard Riddick

2854
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,480
that was super is ridiculous that
someone not knowing what's going on.

2855
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:01,231
Not only that,

2856
01:12:01,231 --> 01:12:04,590
I mean you're dealing with a fighter
that is taking a fight on last minute

2857
01:12:04,591 --> 01:12:07,950
notice against a super dominant wrestler
and he essentially is in a great

2858
01:12:07,951 --> 01:12:12,180
position and could maybe get his back
and that's just biggest advantage.

2859
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,193
You fuck them.

2860
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:13,820
I'm Arconic.

2861
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:14,611
Takes him down now.

2862
01:12:14,611 --> 01:12:15,444
Here.

2863
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:15,901
Yeah.

2864
01:12:15,901 --> 01:12:18,240
He felt was another fire recently
when they were on the ground,

2865
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:19,590
the guy was like side controller,

2866
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,453
the mount,

2867
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:23,270
and then the ref stood them up like that.

2868
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,750
That same a chili card.

2869
01:12:24,751 --> 01:12:28,470
There's also in the girls fight where
the female referee let them just stay on

2870
01:12:28,471 --> 01:12:28,591
there,

2871
01:12:28,591 --> 01:12:29,940
but with no engagement.

2872
01:12:29,941 --> 01:12:30,181
I'm like,

2873
01:12:30,181 --> 01:12:31,860
stand them up right now,

2874
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:32,190
officer.

2875
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:33,120
She doesn't want to be down there.

2876
01:12:33,121 --> 01:12:33,954
She does.

2877
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,160
No one's interacting.

2878
01:12:35,161 --> 01:12:37,650
Let's go chase it nights.

2879
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:40,410
He's got a fucking wicked mission control.

2880
01:12:40,411 --> 01:12:41,940
He pulls to that Michigan lateral.

2881
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:42,490
Very nice.

2882
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:45,420
Got immediately right now he
could hit a triangle right here.

2883
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:46,500
Made huck look at that.

2884
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,393
Oh

2885
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:51,100
yeah.

2886
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:51,611
Has he been made?

2887
01:12:51,611 --> 01:12:53,530
Connie ain't doing shit
on the ground either.

2888
01:12:53,531 --> 01:12:54,181
He's not getting,

2889
01:12:54,181 --> 01:12:56,800
I mean he might be doing okay defensively,

2890
01:12:56,801 --> 01:12:58,430
but he's not getting shit off often.

2891
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:58,600
No,

2892
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,310
he's threatened nonstop down there,

2893
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:03,210
which to me should be
a win for Jason Knight.

2894
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:04,320
Jason,

2895
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,500
I'd gone for a leg lock here.

2896
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,210
I thought about it.

2897
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:09,230
Amir,

2898
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:13,470
Connie Austan he's losing and so he goes
to the ground but leg lock right here.

2899
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,270
Oh Shit.

2900
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:20,240
It's like a around a piece maybe.

2901
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:22,950
Maybe the judges.

2902
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:24,990
The judges for sure.

2903
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,020
Given that the American
honey that's it's one,

2904
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:27,290
one,

2905
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:27,431
one,

2906
01:13:27,431 --> 01:13:27,990
one.

2907
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:30,180
Unless anything with
him on the ground zero.

2908
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:32,460
He still can.

2909
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:33,750
You still took them down sucks though.

2910
01:13:33,751 --> 01:13:36,760
Cause Jason Knight was doing work and
threatened him the entire time in the gun.

2911
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:37,920
Get the gift of a Connie.

2912
01:13:37,921 --> 01:13:38,940
He's one of the defensive.

2913
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:41,250
That's the flaws in our judging is,

2914
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:42,690
is it's a giant.

2915
01:13:42,691 --> 01:13:43,650
It's fucking insane.

2916
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:46,350
I feel like it should be
like a hundred points system.

2917
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:49,800
I feel like there should never
be any up five minute rounds.

2918
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:51,180
There should never be any standup.

2919
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:51,540
Yeah,

2920
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:52,373
I'm with you.

2921
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:57,180
Why you standing in lockdown have forever
five minutes by the time they get to

2922
01:13:57,181 --> 01:13:57,691
the ground,

2923
01:13:57,691 --> 01:13:59,520
like there's not any get downs.

2924
01:13:59,521 --> 01:14:01,580
Like if there's so boring on the feet,

2925
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:02,010
they're not.

2926
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:03,540
They're not doing what you do guys,

2927
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:05,310
just holding position Shit.

2928
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:06,111
Just the fight.

2929
01:14:06,111 --> 01:14:06,600
That's just the way.

2930
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,860
Got The fuck out of chance in in four
minutes to get back up to the feet when

2931
01:14:10,861 --> 01:14:11,620
the over,

2932
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:12,310
because without

2933
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:14,130
this Brendan,

2934
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:17,260
this is what happens if you could,

2935
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:19,240
if they stand them up
because they're holding,

2936
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:20,223
then guys,

2937
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,930
why would they learn Jujitsu
if they get taken down?

2938
01:14:22,931 --> 01:14:23,950
If a strike gets taken out,

2939
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:26,680
all you gotta do is get good at holding
and the Rep's going to stand them up.

2940
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:29,740
That's what it leads to and it fucks a
sport up round three you can't have that.

2941
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,160
That gives,

2942
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:34,790
that gives a strike or a reason to not
learn Jujitsu and just hold and look,

2943
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:38,430
look to the referee standing
up or learn wrestling.

2944
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,940
Keep winning by just holding him down.

2945
01:14:39,941 --> 01:14:40,774
One take done.

2946
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,730
Then you got to learn how
to fight off your back.

2947
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:43,420
God,

2948
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,253
you got to learn how to fight.

2949
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:46,180
You got to push the sport.

2950
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:47,560
You can't go backwards.

2951
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:48,370
I'm Eric standing,

2952
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:50,440
looking for a take down again
and standing up the fight.

2953
01:14:50,441 --> 01:14:53,350
That takes everything backwards and it
makes it so you don't have to look into

2954
01:14:53,351 --> 01:14:54,820
it and trying to win the fight though.

2955
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:57,730
It's an issue that you could say
the same thing about them standing.

2956
01:14:57,731 --> 01:14:58,990
That happens all the time standing.

2957
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:00,130
No one says shit about that.

2958
01:15:00,131 --> 01:15:01,180
We can't put them to the ground.

2959
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:01,601
Why not?

2960
01:15:01,601 --> 01:15:02,870
We do an in combat Jiu Jitsu.

2961
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:04,700
We have get down's baby kit.

2962
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,960
We have kit down

2963
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:08,980
in two minutes.

2964
01:15:08,981 --> 01:15:09,431
If you guys,

2965
01:15:09,431 --> 01:15:10,780
there's no take down in two minutes,

2966
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,910
we get them down then see illegal.

2967
01:15:12,911 --> 01:15:14,380
These kidneys tracks were illegal.

2968
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:15,520
They're not illegal anymore.

2969
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:16,720
They should do more of those.

2970
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:18,430
When a guy has someone's back,

2971
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:19,211
remember how hits him.

2972
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:20,230
He used to do that to the stomach.

2973
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:21,970
Why don't they do that?

2974
01:15:21,971 --> 01:15:23,140
That opens up the neck.

2975
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,510
People forget about it.

2976
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:26,020
You don't need to think about too.

2977
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:26,670
It's true.

2978
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:30,340
Totally because those are some
serious kicks to the stomach.

2979
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:31,780
You're breathing,

2980
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:32,613
but he does it.

2981
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:34,900
They never did create some
space in Merrick county,

2982
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:36,150
so strong wrestling mascot.

2983
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:37,420
He had a flying Kung Fu here.

2984
01:15:37,421 --> 01:15:40,480
This guy's too greasy and his guy.

2985
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:41,590
Oh triangle.

2986
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:42,563
Oh,

2987
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:44,710
you had it for a second.

2988
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:45,544
He's trying.

2989
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,010
He's trying to throw
some shit up there it is.

2990
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,790
So receives throwing some shit up.

2991
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:51,980
Kevin has who's corner?

2992
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:52,811
I'm going to.

2993
01:15:52,811 --> 01:15:54,010
Connie's must be,

2994
01:15:54,011 --> 01:15:54,844
Huh?

2995
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:56,260
Yeah.

2996
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,030
100% but of course.

2997
01:15:58,031 --> 01:15:59,160
But how's your boy Dan harder.

2998
01:15:59,161 --> 01:15:59,940
You still talk to him?

2999
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:00,340
Eddie,

3000
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:01,240
you in touch with him at all?

3001
01:16:01,241 --> 01:16:02,290
I haven't talked to him in a while,

3002
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,810
but he seems to be doing
great as a commentator.

3003
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,051
Yeah,

3004
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:05,561
he's doing great.

3005
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:06,280
He's really good at it.

3006
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,040
He's a,

3007
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,260
he's got a book out too.

3008
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:08,771
What does it say?

3009
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:10,660
Like half reptile or something like that.

3010
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,160
50% reptile.

3011
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:14,170
I forget what it's mixed martial arts on.

3012
01:16:14,171 --> 01:16:15,760
Conspiracy theories is life.

3013
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:21,340
It's got to go for a triangle right here
and he's got a fucking madame theories.

3014
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:24,280
Part reptile part reptiles.

3015
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:25,240
It's about his life story.

3016
01:16:25,241 --> 01:16:26,650
So UFC,

3017
01:16:26,651 --> 01:16:27,484
MMA in me,

3018
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,890
part rep talk and I feel like
it's a bad name for a book.

3019
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:30,701
I don't know.

3020
01:16:30,701 --> 01:16:32,910
Maybe he's got personalization for it.

3021
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:34,773
Lizard man.

3022
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,130
This is a,

3023
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:38,080
this is a terrible
position for Jason Knight.

3024
01:16:38,081 --> 01:16:39,370
Just starts losing.

3025
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:41,650
Honey is not doing Jack Shit.

3026
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:42,543
It doesn't matter,

3027
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,280
but Jason Wright is
threatening off of his back.

3028
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,143
Oh,

3029
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,393
there we go.

3030
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:48,300
Jamie gets,

3031
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:49,133
call it the crack head.

3032
01:16:49,290 --> 01:16:51,910
That's actually quite New
York crack head right there.

3033
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,740
Like what is our mayor
county going to do here?

3034
01:16:56,830 --> 01:17:00,100
He's trying to stack them and just
pressure through and just survive here.

3035
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:01,850
Look at him talking shit like that.

3036
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:03,340
He's not doing anything this way.

3037
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,233
You guys want it though?

3038
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:04,751
Yeah,

3039
01:17:04,751 --> 01:17:05,560
I want to last.

3040
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,000
I want to say one thing to stand it up.

3041
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:07,893
Oh.

3042
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:09,453
Oh

3043
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:11,031
right.

3044
01:17:11,031 --> 01:17:12,830
When we were talking about Mark Goddard,

3045
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:17,340
how Jesus was complaining was going,

3046
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:17,751
dude,

3047
01:17:17,751 --> 01:17:18,680
he's not doing shit.

3048
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:19,800
He wasn't doing shit.

3049
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:20,653
That is true.

3050
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,570
Jesus Christ.

3051
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:26,000
How dare you stand them up for action.

3052
01:17:26,001 --> 01:17:27,350
How dare you.

3053
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:28,880
There's action on the ground.

3054
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:29,211
Well,

3055
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:30,200
I like this action.

3056
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:30,460
Oh,

3057
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:31,160
he's stunned him.

3058
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:31,993
He's done them.

3059
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:35,603
Oh Man.

3060
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:35,930
Connie,

3061
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:39,830
please could take him down and while
he wants some points while he's getting

3062
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:40,664
them,

3063
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:41,601
I mean that's a,

3064
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:43,460
that's literally always been
able to do in this fight.

3065
01:17:43,461 --> 01:17:44,170
Other than that,

3066
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:44,901
a couple of jabs,

3067
01:17:44,901 --> 01:17:45,920
he landed in the first round.

3068
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:46,783
True.

3069
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:47,900
And I've beaten him.

3070
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:49,123
Stand up.

3071
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:49,551
Oh,

3072
01:17:49,551 --> 01:17:50,660
I was calling for a leg lock.

3073
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:52,820
That's a tough sell.

3074
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,670
He's got to do something.

3075
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:56,683
Yeah,

3076
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:57,663
losing this now.

3077
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:58,191
Oh Dude,

3078
01:17:58,191 --> 01:17:58,840
for sure.

3079
01:17:58,840 --> 01:17:59,420
In this fight.

3080
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,253
But it's weird.

3081
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:01,071
He's losing a fight.

3082
01:18:01,071 --> 01:18:02,340
But what the fuck is con uh,

3083
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:02,841
I'm here.

3084
01:18:02,841 --> 01:18:04,040
Connie done taking them down.

3085
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:04,874
But that's it.

3086
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:05,803
Is that enough?

3087
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,960
Is just being on top of it
enough when the guy on top,

3088
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,720
but he did get the tape
you got to take down.

3089
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,160
But it's not good enough.

3090
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:16,670
It's not.

3091
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:18,160
It is in our common sport.

3092
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:22,730
But how much of this should be scored
with Jason Knight controlling off of his

3093
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:24,950
back and going for
submissions versus I'm here.

3094
01:18:24,951 --> 01:18:26,870
Connie literally here doing nothing.

3095
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:27,530
Zero.

3096
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:28,430
But he has control.

3097
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:29,181
Top control.

3098
01:18:29,181 --> 01:18:29,660
Right.

3099
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:29,990
But,

3100
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:31,370
but also anybody's control though.

3101
01:18:31,371 --> 01:18:32,181
He's just on top.

3102
01:18:32,181 --> 01:18:33,200
He doesn't have any control,

3103
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:35,990
but he's not doing anything
but holding him in the spot.

3104
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:36,441
But Jason,

3105
01:18:36,441 --> 01:18:38,480
nice thought landing and he's not trying.

3106
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:42,900
He's at least trying to be offensive
off of his back and Mayor Connie's

3107
01:18:42,901 --> 01:18:44,120
literally doing nothing.

3108
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,070
Like all he's doing is holding on here.

3109
01:18:46,071 --> 01:18:46,371
Look,

3110
01:18:46,371 --> 01:18:47,330
that's what you guys wanted.

3111
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:48,140
But Hey,

3112
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,100
that's part of the sport.

3113
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:50,980
There's plans a shot there.

3114
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:52,520
He lands a shot that's good for him.

3115
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:53,570
That's good for him.

3116
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:55,670
But Jason Knight is being way more active.

3117
01:18:55,671 --> 01:18:55,950
Amir.

3118
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:57,230
Connie throwing a few shots there.

3119
01:18:57,231 --> 01:18:58,064
Asked.

3120
01:18:58,250 --> 01:18:58,431
Yeah.

3121
01:18:58,431 --> 01:18:59,180
Now he passed.

3122
01:18:59,180 --> 01:18:59,760
Yeah,

3123
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,060
I'm,

3124
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:00,920
I'm with you man.

3125
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:02,330
But there was a boy,

3126
01:19:02,331 --> 01:19:02,931
they score it.

3127
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:03,321
Look out.

3128
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,101
Look out for Jason Nights.

3129
01:19:04,101 --> 01:19:04,934
Neck.

3130
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:05,661
I mean,

3131
01:19:05,661 --> 01:19:06,830
it kind of has this fight easily.

3132
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:07,041
Ooh.

3133
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:08,280
He could have a 10 for to choke you.

3134
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,081
You remember that?

3135
01:19:09,081 --> 01:19:11,270
What does that fucking that step over?

3136
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:11,901
Oh Shit.

3137
01:19:11,901 --> 01:19:12,021
Oh,

3138
01:19:12,021 --> 01:19:12,440
he heard them.

3139
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,273
He heard him.

3140
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:13,720
Ahmir Khan.

3141
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,930
Never illegal needle.

3142
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:15,620
Uh,

3143
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,340
I think it was a punch.

3144
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,173
The suspect.

3145
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:19,100
I think the need was
to the body wasn't it?

3146
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:19,610
Was it?

3147
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:20,150
There it is.

3148
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:21,670
Oh No,

3149
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,060
mere county definitely win this fight.

3150
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:24,680
I don't think he's winning 50.

3151
01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:25,460
What's that?

3152
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,540
What's that technique?

3153
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:26,980
God Damn,

3154
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:27,440
I can't,

3155
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:27,741
you're,

3156
01:19:27,741 --> 01:19:29,900
you've got one arm under the,

3157
01:19:29,901 --> 01:19:30,734
uh,

3158
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:31,341
the,

3159
01:19:31,341 --> 01:19:32,174
the arm,

3160
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,300
one arm over the top and
you step over with the legs.

3161
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:36,230
You know that move.

3162
01:19:36,231 --> 01:19:37,310
Fuck her approval.

3163
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:39,370
I call it 10 figure show.

3164
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:41,720
I forgot the proven well
isn't a 10 finger choke?

3165
01:19:41,721 --> 01:19:44,270
The one when it's in the chest,

3166
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,960
you got him in the chest and you have the
the head planted and we should call it

3167
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:48,800
the 10 finger chokes.

3168
01:19:48,801 --> 01:19:50,130
It proved a necktie would we,

3169
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:52,520
for whatever reason we
call it the 10 figures.

3170
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:56,630
Well Tony De Sousa is the reason why
everybody calls it the Peruvian necktie

3171
01:19:56,631 --> 01:20:00,880
because he's got a pad who and there's
a Peruvian darts as well too when it,

3172
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:01,880
oh there it is.

3173
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:02,880
He was out out.

3174
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:03,713
Huh?

3175
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:04,820
I get pissed off you guys.

3176
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:05,480
Ooh,

3177
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,810
he knocked him down twice.

3178
01:20:06,811 --> 01:20:07,490
Yeah,

3179
01:20:07,490 --> 01:20:08,060
but so is it

3180
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:08,731
a ten eight round?

3181
01:20:08,731 --> 01:20:09,740
That first draw?

3182
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:10,760
It could be a draw

3183
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:12,790
draw,

3184
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:14,280
but he's this guy from the UK,

3185
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,560
they'll fill out.

3186
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:17,230
Oh he's not from the UK so hey,

3187
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,310
maybe Kevin.

3188
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:18,990
Nah,

3189
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:19,590
Nah,

3190
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:21,420
I bet Jason loses the fight.

3191
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:23,280
Decision could be,

3192
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:24,413
could be

3193
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:28,893
interesting.

3194
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:36,203
Don't tell him.

3195
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:37,463
What do you think?

3196
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,160
They're probably gonna give it to me.

3197
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:41,303
This is name.

3198
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:42,340
I'm here.

3199
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:44,350
Connie my probably give it down.

3200
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:45,623
Yeah,

3201
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:46,960
you got to take downs.

3202
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:47,291
You know,

3203
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:48,610
he didn't do anything on top,

3204
01:20:48,611 --> 01:20:50,890
but those take downs count.

3205
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:52,423
Yeah.

3206
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:56,093
Yeah.

3207
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,113
Interesting.

3208
01:20:58,450 --> 01:20:59,800
Now is that the coal Maine,

3209
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:01,481
do you remember?

3210
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:02,170
That's fine.

3211
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:03,070
Do you remember that guy?

3212
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:03,904
That was,

3213
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:09,030
I think the first gear teen master in
Nma was that little pick Kenya guy.

3214
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:11,201
Do you remember him?

3215
01:21:11,201 --> 01:21:13,150
He used to fight and shoot
a little Brazilian guy.

3216
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,130
His name was Antonio Nogueira.

3217
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:16,730
Oh yeah.

3218
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:19,140
I forget guillotine.

3219
01:21:19,190 --> 01:21:20,920
So many motherfuckers.

3220
01:21:20,921 --> 01:21:21,790
I think he was uh,

3221
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:22,751
an Andrea Penna,

3222
01:21:22,751 --> 01:21:24,520
Doris Guy from Nova.

3223
01:21:24,521 --> 01:21:25,840
You young remember him?

3224
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:29,410
He was a guy that if you shot in on him,

3225
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:33,310
he was going to guillotine you and he
had his own special 10 finger guillotine.

3226
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,030
He called.

3227
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:35,360
I don't know exactly how he did.

3228
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:35,831
You know,

3229
01:21:35,831 --> 01:21:39,160
everyone's got like their own little
modifications for guillotines cause you

3230
01:21:39,161 --> 01:21:41,290
really can't see the grip
when you get a guillotine.

3231
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,730
The grip is actually hidden.

3232
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:43,570
You really don't,

3233
01:21:43,571 --> 01:21:43,720
you,

3234
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,940
it's a hard to tell what kind
of guilting you putting in.

3235
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:46,793
Right.

3236
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,940
Even with the high elbow
guillotines and Marcella,

3237
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,103
Marcella teen,

3238
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:50,561
it's,

3239
01:21:50,561 --> 01:21:54,850
it's hard to tell if you're holding it
like this or like this because the grip

3240
01:21:54,851 --> 01:21:55,684
is hidden.

3241
01:21:56,590 --> 01:22:00,190
Secret guillotines and the way
that pick Kango Nogueira did it,

3242
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:01,830
man.

3243
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:02,800
I still don't.

3244
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:03,880
I still a,

3245
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,021
I don't remember.

3246
01:22:05,021 --> 01:22:07,120
It was like weird little secret grip.

3247
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,740
Did you ever get into the Pretzel Grip?

3248
01:22:08,741 --> 01:22:09,220
Did you,

3249
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:10,570
will you a big on that,

3250
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,040
that weird grip where the,

3251
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:12,570
the,

3252
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:17,090
the palm of the bottom hand is
facing outward and the palm of the,

3253
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:19,030
the topics towards you.

3254
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:19,900
That's a great,

3255
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,280
that's a great grip.

3256
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:23,500
If you get your hands together,

3257
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:24,461
that's a great grip.

3258
01:22:24,461 --> 01:22:25,810
But the reason why Marcello,

3259
01:22:25,811 --> 01:22:27,640
instead of going here,

3260
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,200
he goes here.

3261
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,530
That's the difference is,

3262
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:32,110
is when you go here,

3263
01:22:32,111 --> 01:22:34,660
you need your palms to meet.

3264
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:35,950
So if,

3265
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:39,820
if there's a guy here and I'm trying
to guillotine and the first thing he's

3266
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:42,100
going to do is bring
up his hands like this,

3267
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:42,401
right?

3268
01:22:42,401 --> 01:22:44,620
And he's going to defend
a guillotine like this.

3269
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,300
So his first move is going
to be to come between your,

3270
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:49,134
your hands,

3271
01:22:49,210 --> 01:22:49,481
right?

3272
01:22:49,481 --> 01:22:51,310
So if you could beat his hand,

3273
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,591
then you're good.

3274
01:22:52,591 --> 01:22:53,470
And this is amazing.

3275
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:55,690
But if you don't beat his hand,

3276
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,650
beat his hand,

3277
01:22:56,650 --> 01:22:58,060
then the guillotine has lost.

3278
01:22:58,061 --> 01:22:59,630
But if he comes up and,

3279
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:03,430
and blocks it like this and I
come around the back of my hand,

3280
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,420
he still fucked.

3281
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:06,130
So it's a sense of security

3282
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,180
split decision.

3283
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:07,541
I'm here,

3284
01:23:07,541 --> 01:23:08,374
Connie.

3285
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:09,783
Interesting.

3286
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,153
Interesting.

3287
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:14,330
Yeah.

3288
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:15,440
Does that make sense on the grip?

3289
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:16,370
Yes it does.

3290
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:16,730
Um,

3291
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:19,460
the also to like the same
as like with a rear naked,

3292
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:21,470
it's like if you could
keep that hand flat,

3293
01:23:21,471 --> 01:23:23,210
it's easy to slide it up in there.

3294
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:26,240
Then if you got it like this where it's
harder to get in underneath the chin.

3295
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,020
I'm not too sure about
that with the guillotine.

3296
01:23:30,021 --> 01:23:32,180
It's just a lot of people
do it with the Pretzel Grip.

3297
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:33,110
Yeah.

3298
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:34,080
But you gotta get your head,

3299
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:34,770
your hands,

3300
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:35,511
your hands together.

3301
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:39,290
It's Huna with Marcello Garcia variation.

3302
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:41,330
It doesn't matter that your
hands are going to come up.

3303
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:42,320
They think they're safe,

3304
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,630
but we're going behind our own hand.

3305
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,110
So that's,

3306
01:23:46,110 --> 01:23:46,720
that's,

3307
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,420
um,

3308
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:50,870
when Marcello was fucking people
up with that on the daily,

3309
01:23:51,230 --> 01:23:52,640
no one can black belts.

3310
01:23:52,641 --> 01:23:52,820
Well,

3311
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:53,900
what the fuck is going on?

3312
01:23:53,901 --> 01:23:55,820
I'm defending the Guillotine
and I'm still tapping.

3313
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:56,360
Right.

3314
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:57,860
It was the grip they given.

3315
01:23:58,660 --> 01:23:59,493
Who went decision?

3316
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:00,363
I'm a Connie.

3317
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:01,903
Yeah.

3318
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:06,430
That's tough for a,

3319
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:08,013
yeah.

3320
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:09,523
What are you gonna do?

3321
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:12,530
The Cub Swanson.

3322
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:14,753
Zoe said,

3323
01:24:15,390 --> 01:24:16,223
okay.

3324
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:18,810
That's not a good move for him.

3325
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:22,510
No Cub Swanson Zone.

3326
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,660
Another words calling out.

3327
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:24,620
I don't know.

3328
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:25,390
Jimmy Marijuana.

3329
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:26,870
I'll say it's up to the Jimmy Manoa.

3330
01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:34,843
Okay.

3331
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,070
I know we see crazy guys like this.

3332
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:40,720
Uh,

3333
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:41,470
what's the next fight?

3334
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:43,160
Just talking about an
old story with Jimmy Man.

3335
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,620
What did the rest of the ground

3336
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:53,040
amazing Arnold Alan Verse Mads
Burno and show up the card.

3337
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:53,883
Pull up the card.

3338
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:56,681
Yeah,

3339
01:24:56,681 --> 01:24:58,390
he's probably delirious
from that uppercut.

3340
01:24:58,630 --> 01:24:59,650
Aljamain

3341
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:03,560
he's trying to get a fight with Dominick
Cruz and he's a bad motherfucker.

3342
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:07,240
Aljamain I liked how he bounced back
from that and Mariah's fight too.

3343
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:09,710
He bounced back and Marla memorize.

3344
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:11,590
Where's Jimmy Rivera coming up?

3345
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:14,230
I think that's next week at
the mother fucking fight.

3346
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:14,891
Yeah,

3347
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:15,641
it is next week.

3348
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:16,474
Right.

3349
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:18,370
Is that next week?

3350
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:20,220
Thanks all dude.

3351
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:22,870
We need to fight night fight
companion for that motherfucker.

3352
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:25,720
What day is that Jimmy Rivera as a mother.

3353
01:25:25,721 --> 01:25:26,031
Fuck,

3354
01:25:26,031 --> 01:25:26,860
he's a beast.

3355
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:27,670
What Day is that?

3356
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:28,470
Is that Saturday?

3357
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:29,830
June 1st Friday night.

3358
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:31,950
June 1st I'm in town.

3359
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:32,883
You in town?

3360
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:33,760
I'm in town.

3361
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:37,480
That's to try and get weird son zeroes.

3362
01:25:37,481 --> 01:25:38,450
I mean sit and talk about it.

3363
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,340
Oh yeah.

3364
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:41,741
Fuck yeah,

3365
01:25:41,741 --> 01:25:41,981
man.

3366
01:25:41,981 --> 01:25:43,390
Let's do that as calen in town.

3367
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,460
Callan's hustling right now.

3368
01:25:45,461 --> 01:25:46,630
Getting ready to do his special right.

3369
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:47,530
Especially in July.

3370
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:49,450
I'm opening in Chicago.

3371
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:50,560
Ooh,

3372
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:51,700
he's ready.

3373
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:52,210
He's ready.

3374
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:53,980
He said he's amped up best he's ever been.

3375
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,083
That's awesome.

3376
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:55,590
Your boy.

3377
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:56,350
Uh,

3378
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:56,531
yeah.

3379
01:25:56,531 --> 01:25:58,690
Hopefully you get picked
up by Netflix or showtime.

3380
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,030
Your boy Joey Diaz last night on fire.

3381
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:08,910
She's on fire right now.

3382
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,960
I just put Jesus Christ.

3383
01:26:11,961 --> 01:26:13,880
Joseph still fucking around to like,

3384
01:26:13,881 --> 01:26:15,940
it's still like trying new shit on stage.

3385
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:18,440
He was telling me that because Netflix,

3386
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:19,670
some of the references he has,

3387
01:26:19,671 --> 01:26:19,941
they're like,

3388
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:20,774
you can't say this.

3389
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:21,680
You need to change this.

3390
01:26:21,681 --> 01:26:22,940
So he's messing with that.

3391
01:26:22,941 --> 01:26:24,540
Like how to hit the joke.

3392
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:26,210
Still using that context.

3393
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:27,440
What references are they?

3394
01:26:27,441 --> 01:26:28,274
Uh,

3395
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:29,413
I don't want to give away.

3396
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,553
Yeah.

3397
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:30,921
Eddie,

3398
01:26:30,921 --> 01:26:32,030
you round next Friday.

3399
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:33,410
The first June 1st,

3400
01:26:33,411 --> 01:26:34,440
which doing next Friday night.

3401
01:26:34,441 --> 01:26:36,110
So next Friday I'm in San Francisco.

3402
01:26:36,111 --> 01:26:36,944
It sounds Tripoli.

3403
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:37,810
You should cancel it.

3404
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,970
What's happening is
you're looking at Friday,

3405
01:26:40,971 --> 01:26:44,500
Jimmy Rivera versus Marlin Mariah's son.

3406
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:46,363
That's going to be,

3407
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:47,953
that is a good fight.

3408
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:49,490
Jake Ellenberger.

3409
01:26:49,491 --> 01:26:53,200
Ben Saunders of the old to Solon at it.

3410
01:26:53,970 --> 01:26:56,600
If I didn't have that
spot in San Francisco,

3411
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:57,620
I'd be cornering.

3412
01:26:57,621 --> 01:26:58,070
Ben,

3413
01:26:58,070 --> 01:26:59,620
you're doing a lot of standup,

3414
01:26:59,630 --> 01:26:59,890
man.

3415
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:02,240
That's not a lot enough.

3416
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:02,571
Like,

3417
01:27:02,571 --> 01:27:04,780
I see you're not like a real comedian.

3418
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:06,340
Real comedians go out all the time.

3419
01:27:06,341 --> 01:27:06,920
I'd,

3420
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:07,461
I'm like,

3421
01:27:07,461 --> 01:27:07,730
uh,

3422
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:09,840
I'm like below an open miker.

3423
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:10,670
You know what I mean?

3424
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:11,600
Are you enjoying it?

3425
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:12,260
I love it.

3426
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:15,350
I love it that the show we did
a Friday night in the bedroom.

3427
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:17,120
That was the most fun I've ever had.

3428
01:27:17,121 --> 01:27:17,421
Man,

3429
01:27:17,421 --> 01:27:19,150
that was so much fun.

3430
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:24,230
Is it all just conspiracies
theories stand up?

3431
01:27:24,231 --> 01:27:26,950
Because I know you guys are calling
it tinfoil hat conspiracy night.

3432
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:28,760
Is that just because of the podcast name?

3433
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:29,720
It's,

3434
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:30,290
it's um,

3435
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:32,420
it's more designed to,

3436
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:33,620
it's not,

3437
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:34,340
you know,

3438
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:37,130
there's a lot of conspiracy
theory comedy in there,

3439
01:27:37,131 --> 01:27:38,030
but you know,

3440
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:39,140
you know,

3441
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:41,120
it's not like 100%,

3442
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:41,900
you know,

3443
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:42,920
but you guys do fit,

3444
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:44,060
you take fan questions too,

3445
01:27:44,061 --> 01:27:44,361
right.

3446
01:27:44,361 --> 01:27:45,500
So you can go hard in the paint.

3447
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:46,220
Yeah.

3448
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:50,120
At the end we do a question and answer
type of like a mini podcasts thing.

3449
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:51,260
Yeah.

3450
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:51,831
It's fun.

3451
01:27:51,831 --> 01:27:53,810
Friday night at the belly
room was so much fun,

3452
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:54,051
man.

3453
01:27:54,051 --> 01:27:56,630
It was such an amazing room.

3454
01:27:56,631 --> 01:27:57,261
That's the truth.

3455
01:27:57,261 --> 01:27:58,094
Serum Room.

3456
01:27:58,550 --> 01:28:00,470
If your jokes are like fat,

3457
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,390
if they have too much extra words in them,

3458
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:03,800
if they're too fake,

3459
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,060
they come off Corny,

3460
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:05,901
that bedroom,

3461
01:28:05,901 --> 01:28:06,591
just highlight,

3462
01:28:06,591 --> 01:28:07,424
can feel it.

3463
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:09,200
I've always liked to run my,

3464
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:11,630
my material in that room
before I do anything.

3465
01:28:11,850 --> 01:28:12,860
Joey did his short,

3466
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:13,310
uh,

3467
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:14,560
I've never been in that room in the,

3468
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:15,381
in the ice house.

3469
01:28:15,381 --> 01:28:15,711
The one,

3470
01:28:15,711 --> 01:28:16,250
not the Ma,

3471
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:17,630
the big room they did in the small,

3472
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:18,290
it's almost like the,

3473
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:19,123
the room.

3474
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:20,713
That's where he did it.

3475
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,010
That room's amazing.

3476
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:23,840
That's what we just done
that a couple of times.

3477
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:24,500
A Joey too.

3478
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,251
That's a great one.

3479
01:28:25,251 --> 01:28:26,084
It's a great room.

3480
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:28,760
When I opened for Joey,

3481
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:33,590
I love it because it's
probably 90% Latin and I love,

3482
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:34,960
I love telling Mexican jokes.

3483
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:36,320
I got so many Mexican stories.

3484
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:37,550
It's just all fun.

3485
01:28:37,551 --> 01:28:39,200
There's no conspiracy theories going on.

3486
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:42,410
And with those crowds
crowds to like 90% Latin.

3487
01:28:42,411 --> 01:28:43,110
Really?

3488
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:43,341
No.

3489
01:28:43,341 --> 01:28:44,174
Last night was it?

3490
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:44,600
No,

3491
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,830
it seemed like it was one.

3492
01:28:45,831 --> 01:28:48,200
It's interesting like in Ontario,

3493
01:28:48,201 --> 01:28:49,880
Ontario's 9% Latin,

3494
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:52,280
that's two hours a lot of fun.

3495
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:54,420
It's a great room till levity,

3496
01:28:55,020 --> 01:29:00,020
a lot of leg work crushers
podcast last week.

3497
01:29:00,651 --> 01:29:01,484
And he said that

3498
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:04,110
that because of you,

3499
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:04,321
you,

3500
01:29:04,321 --> 01:29:04,980
you,

3501
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:08,280
he said that he was telling you that
Russian mafia story and then you said you

3502
01:29:08,281 --> 01:29:09,061
should do it on onstage.

3503
01:29:09,061 --> 01:29:09,894
And then he did it and it,

3504
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:12,090
and it blew up at Russian mob story.

3505
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,500
And then I remembered I go,

3506
01:29:13,501 --> 01:29:16,470
you know what Joe told me to
do that bleeding asshole story

3507
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,310
problem with blood coming out of my ass.

3508
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:22,200
So I told them what,

3509
01:29:22,201 --> 01:29:23,790
how I fixed it and he goes,

3510
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:24,001
dude,

3511
01:29:24,001 --> 01:29:25,230
you got to do that on stage.

3512
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:25,621
And I'm like,

3513
01:29:25,621 --> 01:29:26,420
no way.

3514
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:27,001
At the first,

3515
01:29:27,001 --> 01:29:27,990
my first reaction was like,

3516
01:29:27,991 --> 01:29:28,621
fuck no,

3517
01:29:28,621 --> 01:29:30,150
I'm not going to talk about that on stage,

3518
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:34,000
but I did it Friday and
it went over well too.

3519
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:34,831
It's a funny story,

3520
01:29:34,831 --> 01:29:35,041
man.

3521
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:36,600
When you told that I was howling laughing.

3522
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:37,171
That's funny.

3523
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:38,640
I like you say that like,

3524
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:38,791
Oh,

3525
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:40,860
you should do that bleeding asshole
story and people who are listening,

3526
01:29:40,861 --> 01:29:42,240
what the fuck is wrong with these on?

3527
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:47,640
It's not just a matter of like how you
telling me the story and when you were

3528
01:29:47,641 --> 01:29:48,474
telling me a story,

3529
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,500
I was cracking up.

3530
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:53,070
I mean I am not a comedy Snob by
any stretch of the imagination.

3531
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,060
I like comedy.

3532
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:57,510
I like things that are funny and
if it happens to be funny for x,

3533
01:29:57,511 --> 01:29:58,680
Y or z reason,

3534
01:29:58,681 --> 01:29:59,580
I don't care.

3535
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:00,653
I just want,

3536
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:01,920
I like to laugh.

3537
01:30:01,950 --> 01:30:03,060
I like funny shit.

3538
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:03,811
I just,

3539
01:30:03,811 --> 01:30:05,330
I don't believe that like,

3540
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:06,270
like there's,

3541
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:08,760
there's certain subjects
that should be off limits.

3542
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:10,980
It's just a matter of how
you approach the subject.

3543
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:12,660
If it's a part of life.

3544
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:17,880
The problem is a lot of subjects are
tainted because a lot of people do bad

3545
01:30:17,881 --> 01:30:20,970
comedy that's like
cheap and easy and they,

3546
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:21,340
they,

3547
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:21,960
they like,

3548
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,720
they use those subjects instead of,

3549
01:30:24,721 --> 01:30:28,470
because the subjects are interesting
and they have like a real valid point.

3550
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:31,170
They use those subjects because they
know it's going to get a cheap laugh.

3551
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:34,290
No original thought was
the Fart joke or a cheap,

3552
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:34,620
you know,

3553
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:35,640
whatever kind of joke.

3554
01:30:35,641 --> 01:30:35,911
There's,

3555
01:30:35,911 --> 01:30:37,260
there's a bunch of cheap jokes,

3556
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:41,880
but then there's like real live situation
when you have to shit your pants,

3557
01:30:41,881 --> 01:30:42,840
like told her you should.

3558
01:30:42,841 --> 01:30:46,410
Fear had a fucking hilarious joke about,

3559
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,600
there was a bridge across,

3560
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:49,410
uh,

3561
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:50,670
in Sydney.

3562
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:51,770
This is crazy bridge.

3563
01:30:51,771 --> 01:30:53,250
It's like two miles long or something.

3564
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:57,060
You walk across it and he was halfway
across the bridge and you had a shit his

3565
01:30:57,061 --> 01:31:02,061
pants and he told the story and he had
an agent at the time and told them,

3566
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:03,991
that's a shit joke.

3567
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:05,760
You gotta stop doing that joke
and already looked at him.

3568
01:31:05,761 --> 01:31:06,510
He goes,

3569
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:06,781
yeah,

3570
01:31:06,781 --> 01:31:07,890
we're not going to work together anymore.

3571
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:08,753
He just got rid of them.

3572
01:31:08,770 --> 01:31:12,720
Just get rid of his agents like get the
fuck Outta here cause he told me about

3573
01:31:12,721 --> 01:31:12,810
it.

3574
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:13,170
I go,

3575
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:13,800
what?

3576
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:17,610
I go that guy I told you to stop doing
that bit cause it was a real story.

3577
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:18,683
I was with him,

3578
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:19,980
we worked together and Sydney,

3579
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:20,850
that's what makes it fun.

3580
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:23,130
I mean but it was a real
story where he had a shit,

3581
01:31:23,131 --> 01:31:26,670
his pants and he was a mile
into it and it was killing,

3582
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,640
killing and his stupid ass agent was like,

3583
01:31:29,641 --> 01:31:30,391
you know that is a,

3584
01:31:30,391 --> 01:31:31,111
that's a shit joke.

3585
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:34,770
Show into a shit show because he
doesn't get it because he hears when,

3586
01:31:34,771 --> 01:31:39,640
when people are talking about just like
why would she of the Asian on Asian

3587
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:40,130
maternity,

3588
01:31:40,130 --> 01:31:40,690
Asian,

3589
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:42,680
no agent in Asia did I?

3590
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,193
It's early.

3591
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:45,923
Why would he,

3592
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:46,773
why would he

3593
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:48,301
he didn't.

3594
01:31:48,301 --> 01:31:49,290
But when look,

3595
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:49,701
here's the,

3596
01:31:49,701 --> 01:31:51,390
there's two stages of your career,

3597
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:51,930
right?

3598
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:54,450
There's a stage where other people
trying to tell you what to do.

3599
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:55,051
They're like,

3600
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:56,370
what do you need to do is wear a tie.

3601
01:31:56,490 --> 01:31:57,730
Well you need to do is change your ride.

3602
01:31:57,740 --> 01:31:59,040
What you need to do is go clean.

3603
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:00,910
I went through all that shit too.

3604
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:03,700
And then there's a stage where
they just leave you the fuck alone.

3605
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:06,790
Ari is now in that leave you the fuck.

3606
01:32:06,791 --> 01:32:08,620
Cause he's successful
because he's successful.

3607
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:10,350
When you're successful you can
say what you want to do it.

3608
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:13,420
A few years back he was
in that you might make it,

3609
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:18,100
you might fall apart stage in in an
agent's eyes like agents look at you and

3610
01:32:18,101 --> 01:32:18,311
they go,

3611
01:32:18,311 --> 01:32:18,671
man,

3612
01:32:18,671 --> 01:32:18,971
I don't know,

3613
01:32:18,971 --> 01:32:20,440
Eddie might be able to make it,

3614
01:32:20,441 --> 01:32:21,790
but you're going to have
to change some things.

3615
01:32:21,930 --> 01:32:22,870
It would change the way you're dressed.

3616
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:25,990
Change your hair dry as all star bleeding.

3617
01:32:25,991 --> 01:32:28,090
Asshole thing is alienating fans,

3618
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:29,021
you know,

3619
01:32:29,021 --> 01:32:29,570
and they,

3620
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:32,770
they get it in their head that
they know how to fix your act.

3621
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,210
They're almost always wrong.

3622
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,010
They're almost always wrong or
he's hilarious at the same major.

3623
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:39,820
He didn't tell him either one of us.

3624
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:41,530
Shit already doesn't give a fuck.

3625
01:32:41,531 --> 01:32:42,850
Now Ari is like,

3626
01:32:42,851 --> 01:32:44,470
does my favorite example,

3627
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:45,753
he's got a flip phone.

3628
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:48,910
But he's my favorite example
of a dude who got money,

3629
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:51,850
got some fame and some
wealth and got some success.

3630
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:52,811
And just said,

3631
01:32:52,811 --> 01:32:54,040
fuck you,

3632
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:55,350
I'm doing whatever I want.

3633
01:32:55,351 --> 01:32:55,460
Yeah.

3634
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:58,030
Bird was saying like a torn was,

3635
01:32:58,230 --> 01:32:59,063
uh,

3636
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:00,400
he was taking some time off.

3637
01:33:00,401 --> 01:33:00,671
He's just,

3638
01:33:00,671 --> 01:33:01,660
he's going somewhere now.

3639
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:02,621
Like does he want a toy?

3640
01:33:02,621 --> 01:33:03,100
He's like,

3641
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,420
he just needs a certain minimum
and that's all he cares about.

3642
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,370
He hits that things out.

3643
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,380
He made his monthly nut or as year the
[inaudible] he said in the first couple

3644
01:33:09,381 --> 01:33:10,214
of weeks of the year,

3645
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:12,310
they just did a bunch
of theaters and some,

3646
01:33:12,311 --> 01:33:13,260
some good breaks.

3647
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:14,290
No.

3648
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:14,600
Alright.

3649
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,010
Alright.

3650
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:15,521
Shit.

3651
01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:16,354
And he just,

3652
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,240
he's got a fucking low overhead and man,

3653
01:33:19,241 --> 01:33:20,290
he doesn't have a car.

3654
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:21,490
He lives cheap.

3655
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:22,091
I mean,

3656
01:33:22,091 --> 01:33:22,630
he's just,

3657
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:23,331
he keeps that way.

3658
01:33:23,331 --> 01:33:24,220
It's still in New York.

3659
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:24,940
Yeah.

3660
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:25,570
Yeah.

3661
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:26,403
He's hilarious.

3662
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:28,000
He doesn't give a fuck man.

3663
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:28,450
I mean,

3664
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:29,980
and he loves traveling.

3665
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,150
He loves traveling.

3666
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,140
He's material from it.

3667
01:33:32,141 --> 01:33:32,460
Right?

3668
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:32,550
Well,

3669
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:33,820
it's not just that man,

3670
01:33:33,850 --> 01:33:37,040
he just really enjoys going
to different cultures and be,

3671
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:37,361
I mean,

3672
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:39,940
he went to fucking Asia Dude like Asia,

3673
01:33:39,941 --> 01:33:40,774
Asia,

3674
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:46,390
pistols and shit staying in places
where like 18 year old backpackers go.

3675
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:47,410
I mean those same steps,

3676
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:47,950
like your field,

3677
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:48,751
that you're in danger.

3678
01:33:48,751 --> 01:33:49,240
He was not,

3679
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:49,811
not ever,

3680
01:33:49,811 --> 01:33:50,051
I'm like,

3681
01:33:50,051 --> 01:33:50,860
what?

3682
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:51,940
I'm too scared to do that.

3683
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:53,500
I wouldn't want to do that.

3684
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:53,861
Well,

3685
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:55,240
I don't think it's dangerous.

3686
01:33:55,241 --> 01:33:55,481
I mean,

3687
01:33:55,481 --> 01:33:57,310
I think it's rarely dangerous,

3688
01:33:57,311 --> 01:33:59,860
but I think any kind of travel you mean?

3689
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:00,191
I mean,

3690
01:34:00,191 --> 01:34:05,191
I'm talking about traveling to a bar
in Canoga park could be dangerous.

3691
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:05,741
You know,

3692
01:34:05,741 --> 01:34:06,910
you hear about it in a story.

3693
01:34:06,911 --> 01:34:10,900
Brendan Schaub Joe Rug and go to a bar
and Canoga Joe gets stabbed by some crazy

3694
01:34:10,901 --> 01:34:11,530
person.

3695
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:11,711
Oh,

3696
01:34:11,711 --> 01:34:12,820
don't go to Canoga Park.

3697
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,990
That's not what it is.

3698
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:17,020
It's just like life is
occasionally dangerous.

3699
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:18,040
You know?

3700
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:22,810
I don't think those hostels are most of
those hostels or just college kids that

3701
01:34:22,811 --> 01:34:25,680
are just traveling abroad
and looking to see the world.

3702
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:26,790
I've always been scared of houses.

3703
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:28,010
My brother stayed when you're up,

3704
01:34:28,011 --> 01:34:28,631
until he woke up.

3705
01:34:28,631 --> 01:34:30,370
So in sucking on his toes.

3706
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:34,453
That's scary.

3707
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:36,780
Well,

3708
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:37,060
what?

3709
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:39,280
I was scared of it because
of those horror movies,

3710
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:40,360
the hostel,

3711
01:34:40,361 --> 01:34:40,961
the hostel.

3712
01:34:40,961 --> 01:34:42,820
Are We fucking terrifying?

3713
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,380
Part Two's even more Teresa.

3714
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:46,630
Dude,

3715
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:50,110
how's still is so hostile is brutal.

3716
01:34:50,111 --> 01:34:50,944
Man.

3717
01:34:51,130 --> 01:34:52,600
How easy is it to,

3718
01:34:52,890 --> 01:34:53,970
to Lord,

3719
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,800
you know those 18 year old
backpackers that are across Europe.

3720
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,050
So I'll leave,

3721
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:01,341
dude.

3722
01:35:01,341 --> 01:35:04,910
All you gotta do is get hot chicks point
out the dude's a hot chicks would drag

3723
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:05,744
him into some shit,

3724
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:06,620
put some,

3725
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:10,700
put some drugs in that drinks and book
and two 50 year old and a 35 year old.

3726
01:35:10,701 --> 01:35:11,534
A hot chick.

3727
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:12,500
But Ya,

3728
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:12,680
yeah,

3729
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:13,513
where are we going?

3730
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:15,381
You asked it,

3731
01:35:15,381 --> 01:35:18,290
but when you're 20 when you're
21 warm hole in the wall.

3732
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:19,220
No,

3733
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:19,670
what I'm saying,

3734
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:20,391
it's easy.

3735
01:35:20,391 --> 01:35:21,820
That's how they got them and hostile.

3736
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,090
They just said they just sent
chicks straight after him.

3737
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:27,830
That's the easy chicks
work every due to fall.

3738
01:35:27,831 --> 01:35:28,240
Right.

3739
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,570
They'll fall right into it.

3740
01:35:29,571 --> 01:35:29,841
Man.

3741
01:35:29,841 --> 01:35:30,950
Chicks with drugs,

3742
01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:31,260
you know,

3743
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:32,420
drink and it's over.

3744
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,930
But I think for a lot of those people
that travel like that and live like that,

3745
01:35:35,931 --> 01:35:40,570
it's gotta be very hard to settle down
once you get used to just traveling to

3746
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:43,130
and drugs and partying places.

3747
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:45,500
And I feel like that movie
doesn't end well for those people.

3748
01:35:45,501 --> 01:35:48,720
There's no real stability life.

3749
01:35:48,970 --> 01:35:49,360
Everyone.

3750
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,960
Everyone has their own
movie playing right now.

3751
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:51,171
No,

3752
01:35:51,171 --> 01:35:52,250
it definitely doesn't end well.

3753
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,230
I mean maybe start a pottery
business or some shit

3754
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,620
like and pottery.

3755
01:35:58,610 --> 01:35:59,360
What does this one,

3756
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,340
this is another movie that Eli Roth made.

3757
01:36:01,341 --> 01:36:02,174
He also made hostile.

3758
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:03,130
It's called green inferno.

3759
01:36:03,170 --> 01:36:05,420
I did see this where they eat each other.

3760
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:08,290
Did they get eaten by cannibals
or Brazil or somewhere?

3761
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:09,403
Some

3762
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:11,170
don't.

3763
01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:11,901
This was breezy.

3764
01:36:11,901 --> 01:36:15,110
It was like some remote
location like in the jungle.

3765
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:16,970
I was actually a little
disappointed in this.

3766
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:17,481
The trailer.

3767
01:36:17,481 --> 01:36:17,780
I was like,

3768
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:21,170
Oh shit is the head of the
upper left hand corner.

3769
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:24,380
That's some crazy shit that happens
in the movie to send me that.

3770
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:27,230
Send me that a text message man to watch.

3771
01:36:27,231 --> 01:36:28,470
Don't you think like Brazil,

3772
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:33,480
like tourism is down 8000%
because of these fucking movies.

3773
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:34,051
You know what I mean?

3774
01:36:34,051 --> 01:36:34,880
It happens though.

3775
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:35,970
Shit does happen,

3776
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:39,290
but you know what still maybe Brazil
is like slow the fuck down with these

3777
01:36:39,291 --> 01:36:40,071
goddamn movies,

3778
01:36:40,071 --> 01:36:44,180
but they do have the biggest rain
forest in the world and they do.

3779
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:45,310
This is scary shit.

3780
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:46,650
Fucking Amazon forest.

3781
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:48,883
I couldn't breathe.

3782
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:51,290
I was a text Tim Kenny and I say,

3783
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:53,590
I can't believe when he's
talking about all of those Nazis.

3784
01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:59,230
What the fuck in they flew from
Germany to fucking Argentina.

3785
01:36:59,961 --> 01:37:00,850
That's a true story.

3786
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:01,850
I text until I went,

3787
01:37:01,851 --> 01:37:02,684
Dude,

3788
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:07,160
you did the greatest promo ever for
your discovery and history channel show.

3789
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:08,000
Cause I really was.

3790
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:08,691
I love Tim,

3791
01:37:08,691 --> 01:37:10,300
but I don't watch that much TV with that,

3792
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:11,173
with that stuff.

3793
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,800
He was talking about those
Germans that live in Argentina.

3794
01:37:14,801 --> 01:37:15,590
How many cities?

3795
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:16,340
How many villages?

3796
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:16,971
I don't know what?

3797
01:37:16,971 --> 01:37:17,900
Hundreds of thousands.

3798
01:37:17,901 --> 01:37:18,481
100,000.

3799
01:37:18,481 --> 01:37:19,400
And you go to the village,

3800
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:21,500
this is an rd term and it's all German.

3801
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:22,820
The architecture,

3802
01:37:22,821 --> 01:37:23,720
we go into the house,

3803
01:37:23,721 --> 01:37:25,500
it's all fucking term images of a chain.

3804
01:37:25,501 --> 01:37:27,540
They don't speak out the
fucking lick of Spanish.

3805
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:31,250
They were leader hose in that drink and
giant steins and show proud of their

3806
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:32,341
history.

3807
01:37:32,341 --> 01:37:32,590
Yeah,

3808
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:34,310
that's what's creepy about.

3809
01:37:34,311 --> 01:37:34,830
He goes,

3810
01:37:34,830 --> 01:37:36,590
you know what built that land juice.

3811
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:37,453
Fucking the,

3812
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:37,770
their,

3813
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:39,090
their cavity fillings.

3814
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:40,190
Third Wedding rings.

3815
01:37:40,191 --> 01:37:40,911
That's what built that in.

3816
01:37:40,911 --> 01:37:42,830
So what do I got so upset,

3817
01:37:42,831 --> 01:37:43,290
man.

3818
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:44,420
And he's talking about how,

3819
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:45,330
uh,

3820
01:37:45,330 --> 01:37:46,790
how they would torture kids.

3821
01:37:46,850 --> 01:37:47,280
I just heard,

3822
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,270
I stopped listening at that.

3823
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:49,700
I'm out.

3824
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:49,881
Well,

3825
01:37:49,881 --> 01:37:54,881
he was talking about how Mengele and a
lot of the SS soldiers went to Argentina

3826
01:37:56,490 --> 01:38:00,540
and continued a lot of their torture
experiments and that they had met some of

3827
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:03,150
the people that had been
tortured by these ss guys.

3828
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:03,991
Horrific,

3829
01:38:03,991 --> 01:38:04,801
horrific boy.

3830
01:38:04,801 --> 01:38:05,670
They break their bones,

3831
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:07,140
bring nurse him back to health,

3832
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:08,430
set them on fire.

3833
01:38:08,431 --> 01:38:11,460
Just the worst shit you can imagine
just to see like what they could do.

3834
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:12,600
I went to Argentina like,

3835
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:14,010
like 10 years ago,

3836
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:15,240
and I swear,

3837
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:16,260
I swear to God,

3838
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:21,320
I've never been to a country with so many
beautiful women really was on believe,

3839
01:38:22,190 --> 01:38:22,990
say no one there.

3840
01:38:22,990 --> 01:38:23,823
And it's like there's,

3841
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:25,650
you see like 10 at a time,

3842
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:26,250
13,

3843
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:27,210
they're like everywhere.

3844
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:31,440
And you would think you would think
it would be easy to pick them up,

3845
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:36,030
but it's super hard because they
have no faith in men because the men,

3846
01:38:36,031 --> 01:38:37,460
they're like prostitution.

3847
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:38,630
Schlegel yeah.

3848
01:38:38,770 --> 01:38:42,600
They know that there's no reason for a
guy to to get committed so they don't

3849
01:38:42,601 --> 01:38:43,230
trust guys.

3850
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:43,741
So they're like,

3851
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:44,574
just,

3852
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,650
that was my experience that
they just like hang out.

3853
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:49,770
They hang out with each other and
they just kept blocking child wiener.

3854
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:51,090
They travel,

3855
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:52,170
cock blocked each other.

3856
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,060
They travel in packs,

3857
01:38:54,061 --> 01:38:55,110
they're everywhere.

3858
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:57,030
It's incredible blessing.

3859
01:38:57,110 --> 01:38:58,070
They're only touching on,

3860
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:00,900
I'd love to go to Argentina.

3861
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:02,341
You watch this.

3862
01:39:02,341 --> 01:39:02,501
It's,

3863
01:39:02,501 --> 01:39:03,600
it's crazy man.

3864
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:04,071
And it,

3865
01:39:04,071 --> 01:39:05,940
and Tim said you'd go there and you know,

3866
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:06,131
they're,

3867
01:39:06,131 --> 01:39:07,140
they're like so,

3868
01:39:07,410 --> 01:39:10,740
so proud of their Nazi
grandfather and stuff like that.

3869
01:39:10,741 --> 01:39:11,341
And Tim's like,

3870
01:39:11,341 --> 01:39:12,480
what the fuck man,

3871
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:13,510
that's crazy.

3872
01:39:13,510 --> 01:39:14,370
Crazy.

3873
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:15,661
No,

3874
01:39:15,661 --> 01:39:15,960
no,

3875
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:16,171
no.

3876
01:39:16,171 --> 01:39:17,730
Not a lick of Spanish anywhere.

3877
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:18,870
And Hitler may be,

3878
01:39:18,871 --> 01:39:19,290
uh,

3879
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:19,650
you know,

3880
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:19,840
yeah,

3881
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:20,400
that's,

3882
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,091
Joe asked him,

3883
01:39:21,091 --> 01:39:21,450
he goes,

3884
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:22,770
if you have to decide right now,

3885
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:24,750
did Hitler die in that bit
on like history tells you,

3886
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:26,520
and this is Tim Kennedy.

3887
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:27,690
He's never told a lie in his life.

3888
01:39:27,691 --> 01:39:28,230
He goes,

3889
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:28,501
nope,

3890
01:39:28,501 --> 01:39:30,780
history's wrong on this one day.

3891
01:39:30,990 --> 01:39:35,160
And he'd be so happy about
what that history is wrong.

3892
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:37,470
History is often wrong.

3893
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:40,710
That's what I'm saying is
during Kennedy approves it,

3894
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:41,730
it's fucking,

3895
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:44,640
we go and sizzler [inaudible] he's
never told a lie on the sizzler.

3896
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:46,770
Tim Kenny's never told her line is live.

3897
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:48,153
Are you sure?

3898
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:48,450
No,

3899
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:48,720
dude.

3900
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:49,553
Tim Kenny says,

3901
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:52,770
I mean he's as American pies it gets,

3902
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:53,723
yeah,

3903
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:54,631
I love that guy,

3904
01:39:54,631 --> 01:39:55,350
man.

3905
01:39:55,350 --> 01:39:57,180
I cried because I thought
he going to die one time.

3906
01:39:58,230 --> 01:39:59,063
I love him.

3907
01:39:59,150 --> 01:40:03,420
He doesn't have a crazy show that
he where he tries to kill himself.

3908
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:04,470
They tried to kill him.

3909
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:05,640
Like what's the name of that show?

3910
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:07,203
Uh,

3911
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:10,231
what's it called?

3912
01:40:10,231 --> 01:40:13,850
It's like some show where someone almost
dies goes in Atlanta and jumps out of

3913
01:40:13,851 --> 01:40:14,300
planes.

3914
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:14,820
Yes.

3915
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:15,300
Yes.

3916
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:15,451
Oh,

3917
01:40:15,451 --> 01:40:18,740
you a bull fighting hard to
hard to kill Tim Canada Ham.

3918
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:20,010
That's what Steven Seagal movie,

3919
01:40:20,011 --> 01:40:20,550
isn't it?

3920
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:20,791
Yeah,

3921
01:40:20,791 --> 01:40:21,750
it is terrible movie.

3922
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:22,981
All those,

3923
01:40:22,981 --> 01:40:23,814
a fan as a kid,

3924
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:24,151
but yet,

3925
01:40:24,151 --> 01:40:27,840
and then he also has hunting
Hitler on the history channel down.

3926
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:30,670
He's a beast man.

3927
01:40:30,910 --> 01:40:31,950
And then he's still serving,

3928
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:34,330
doing like secret missions and
killing people on the side.

3929
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:35,441
His side,

3930
01:40:35,441 --> 01:40:36,610
chicks killing isis.

3931
01:40:36,850 --> 01:40:37,420
That's what he does.

3932
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:38,400
What he says,

3933
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:39,850
he's still active.

3934
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,270
Special Forces going on projects and shit.

3935
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:45,460
Killing people corralled.

3936
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:45,910
Yeah.

3937
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:46,743
Hell yeah.

3938
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:47,613
Damn

3939
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:49,310
dudes.

3940
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:50,143
Another level.

3941
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:52,850
Yeah.

3942
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:53,110
Wait,

3943
01:40:53,110 --> 01:40:54,220
this main event man,

3944
01:40:54,630 --> 01:40:55,370
is it hard?

3945
01:40:55,370 --> 01:40:56,310
Kind of bullshit,

3946
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:56,860
man.

3947
01:40:56,860 --> 01:40:57,390
God,

3948
01:40:57,390 --> 01:40:59,270
dog and fights and accident.

3949
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:00,490
Well thanks for that.

3950
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:05,590
So how standup gun,

3951
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:06,500

3952

Grinding every week.

3953
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:11,800
Six spots last week it for this week.

3954
01:41:12,190 --> 01:41:15,160
And then folks approach
you for a special nope.

3955
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:16,300
Not yet.

3956
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:16,691
Not yet,

3957
01:41:16,691 --> 01:41:16,901
man.

3958
01:41:16,901 --> 01:41:17,740
He's a little ways to go.

3959
01:41:17,741 --> 01:41:19,510
And you've been doing
comedy now for a year?

3960
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:20,320
Two years.

3961
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:20,860
Two years.

3962
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:21,693
Two years.

3963
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:22,690
It's been two years.

3964
01:41:22,691 --> 01:41:23,320
Shit,

3965
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:24,153
two years.

3966
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,860
I've been doing live fire in
the kids for over three years.

3967
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,150
That's where it started.

3968
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:29,020
Yeah.

3969
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:29,411
Yeah.

3970
01:41:29,411 --> 01:41:29,861
Damn.

3971
01:41:29,861 --> 01:41:30,011
I,

3972
01:41:30,011 --> 01:41:32,230
for some reason I thought you
were doing standup for a year.

3973
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:33,213
I've been doing it.

3974
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:35,290
My first spot was at the comedy store.

3975
01:41:35,291 --> 01:41:36,310
I have it written my phone.

3976
01:41:36,311 --> 01:41:38,110
I'd have to look comedy chaos night.

3977
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:38,921
Uh,

3978
01:41:38,921 --> 01:41:39,221
no,

3979
01:41:39,221 --> 01:41:39,521
it was a,

3980
01:41:39,521 --> 01:41:39,940
it was uh,

3981
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:41,260
they gave me a spot in the belly room.

3982
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:45,190
Fastest rising comedian of all time.

3983
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:46,150
Right.

3984
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:46,341
Like,

3985
01:41:46,341 --> 01:41:50,350
cause with zero standup experience and
then all of a sudden you do standup and

3986
01:41:50,351 --> 01:41:53,380
now you're fucking playing all
over the world making loot.

3987
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:54,273
Right.

3988
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:54,940
It's good.

3989
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:55,691
You're getting paid,

3990
01:41:55,691 --> 01:41:56,310
right?

3991
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:56,860
Yeah.

3992
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:57,850
That is almost as good.

3993
01:41:57,851 --> 01:41:58,481
That's incredible.

3994
01:41:58,481 --> 01:42:02,030
I'll never fast fall time you
could be doing to us Jews.

3995
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:07,560
Generally you grind for about 10
years until you pop if you do it all,

3996
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:12,370
but I think you can do like the Charlie
Sheen route where if you have some sort

3997
01:42:12,371 --> 01:42:12,791
of fallen,

3998
01:42:12,791 --> 01:42:13,990
you do shows and then people are like,

3999
01:42:13,991 --> 01:42:14,681
this sucks.

4000
01:42:14,681 --> 01:42:15,514
I don't come back.

4001
01:42:15,850 --> 01:42:18,050
I think the sign of it is you do,

4002
01:42:18,051 --> 01:42:21,250
you can come back to if you sell
tickets of places you've been before.

4003
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:22,230
You know what I'm saying?

4004
01:42:22,230 --> 01:42:22,571
Yeah.

4005
01:42:22,571 --> 01:42:24,340
So it's not so they
know it's not a gimmick.

4006
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:25,353
That's the big thing.

4007
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:25,721
Yeah.

4008
01:42:25,721 --> 01:42:26,410
That's I'm doing,

4009
01:42:26,410 --> 01:42:28,210
which I can learn either way.

4010
01:42:28,211 --> 01:42:28,871
It's incredible.

4011
01:42:28,871 --> 01:42:29,790
Congratulations.

4012
01:42:29,791 --> 01:42:31,600
That's saw the fuck didn't I didn't,

4013
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:36,760
I was hanging out with Joe
in the comedy scene for many,

4014
01:42:36,761 --> 01:42:37,571
many years.

4015
01:42:37,571 --> 01:42:40,540
I seen comedians just eat shit,

4016
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,410
you know?

4017
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:42,131
Can we crash?

4018
01:42:42,131 --> 01:42:42,350
Yeah.

4019
01:42:42,350 --> 01:42:43,183
Come and go.

4020
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,233
Never make it.

4021
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:48,100
This same guys from 15 years ago
still trying to make it say material.

4022
01:42:48,110 --> 01:42:49,360
What you're doing is incredible,

4023
01:42:49,361 --> 01:42:49,740
man.

4024
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:50,141
It's like,

4025
01:42:50,141 --> 01:42:51,010
it's unheard of.

4026
01:42:51,011 --> 01:42:51,844
Thanks man.

4027
01:42:51,910 --> 01:42:54,010
Sam was telling me you were
killing it the other night.

4028
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:55,660
I had a good set Friday night.

4029
01:42:55,930 --> 01:42:56,370
Yeah.

4030
01:42:56,370 --> 01:42:57,340
It came together.

4031
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:58,150
It was a,

4032
01:42:58,150 --> 01:43:00,790
it was the first set I did not stoned.

4033
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:02,320
That's good.

4034
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:03,370
So I decided,

4035
01:43:03,490 --> 01:43:04,323
you know what,

4036
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:06,910
unless you're really good at something,

4037
01:43:06,911 --> 01:43:08,440
you shouldn't be smoking
weed and doing it.

4038
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:09,251
You know what I mean?

4039
01:43:09,251 --> 01:43:13,360
And until you are super confident
and you got your shit down,

4040
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:14,540
don't smoke week,

4041
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:15,250
you know what I mean?

4042
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:17,320
So I decided to try it out,

4043
01:43:17,321 --> 01:43:21,200
like not smoke weed and go on stage
and see what happens and earn.

4044
01:43:21,230 --> 01:43:21,700
It went good.

4045
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:22,030
It went,

4046
01:43:22,030 --> 01:43:22,960
it went better than,

4047
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:25,050
that was probably my best set.

4048
01:43:25,051 --> 01:43:25,210
So,

4049
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:26,830
and then you guys are at cobb's on Friday.

4050
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:29,670
Friday at cobb's has never,

4051
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:30,461
never been there.

4052
01:43:30,461 --> 01:43:31,210
A bunch with Joe.

4053
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:32,740
Love Calkins day the best.

4054
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:34,480
You've been there a couple of times.

4055
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:34,990
Uh,

4056
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:35,590
twice now.

4057
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:36,250
Headline.

4058
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:36,640
Yeah.

4059
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:37,320
Fuck.

4060
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:37,930
Twice down.

4061
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:38,720
Then I'll be back.

4062
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:39,490
He sell it out.

4063
01:43:39,490 --> 01:43:39,910
Yeah.

4064
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:41,140
Holy Shit.

4065
01:43:41,141 --> 01:43:43,000
That's a 300 400 seats.

4066
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:43,630
Yeah.

4067
01:43:43,630 --> 01:43:44,980
God Damn Dude.

4068
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:45,641
Holy Shit.

4069
01:43:45,641 --> 01:43:47,320
Then we do a Saturday,

4070
01:43:47,321 --> 01:43:48,160
we do Sacramento,

4071
01:43:48,161 --> 01:43:48,994
the punchline.

4072
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:50,133
So that's a smaller,

4073
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:53,150
that's like 150 to one
or something like that.

4074
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:54,050
Uh,

4075
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:54,530
but uh,

4076
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:56,630
yeah cause can San Fran to,

4077
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:58,040
until I get my shit together,

4078
01:43:58,041 --> 01:43:58,400
you know,

4079
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:59,490
I'm going to go on stage,

4080
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:00,343
uh,

4081
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:02,990
clear-eyed or this the smartest route man.

4082
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:03,951
And then later,

4083
01:44:03,951 --> 01:44:04,700
once I,

4084
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:07,580
once I feel super
confident in my material,

4085
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:08,280
um,

4086
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:09,300
and we have right now,

4087
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:15,340
my problem is I have way too much material
and it's just scattered everywhere.

4088
01:44:15,651 --> 01:44:16,670
All these ideas,

4089
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:19,130
every day I have new ideas,

4090
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:22,070
but they need to be organized
more and fleshed out.

4091
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,130
And that's what I did for,

4092
01:44:23,131 --> 01:44:23,841
for this show too.

4093
01:44:23,841 --> 01:44:24,261
I decided,

4094
01:44:24,261 --> 01:44:24,920
you know what,

4095
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,930
there's just so much
and it's overwhelming.

4096
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:29,180
I just took three pieces,

4097
01:44:29,181 --> 01:44:29,661
pull my goal.

4098
01:44:29,661 --> 01:44:30,910
I'm just going to stick to these three.

4099
01:44:31,690 --> 01:44:32,523
Yeah,

4100
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:33,470
exactly,

4101
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:34,130
exactly.

4102
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:35,410
And um,

4103
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:38,000
have as great at helping with that too.

4104
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:41,120
At first I was writing
everything out and then I,

4105
01:44:41,121 --> 01:44:41,751
then Joe,

4106
01:44:41,751 --> 01:44:42,470
he told me,

4107
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:43,130
he goes,

4108
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:43,461
dude,

4109
01:44:43,461 --> 01:44:43,820
you're,

4110
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:48,260
you're at your best when you don't write
it out and you just go off the cuff.

4111
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:48,921
So Joe,

4112
01:44:48,921 --> 01:44:49,754
he told me,

4113
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:53,600
just have ideas but don't write anything
out and just go out there and try it.

4114
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:53,780
And I,

4115
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:57,490
and I did that and I
think that's for me that,

4116
01:44:57,550 --> 01:44:57,770
you know,

4117
01:44:57,770 --> 01:45:01,170
Friday I just had powerpoints
and a couple of lines like,

4118
01:45:01,171 --> 01:45:01,790
okay,

4119
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:03,890
this line is kind of funny in
that line is kind of funny.

4120
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:07,970
And then I just went off and
just kind of just went for it.

4121
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:09,260
It worked out great.

4122
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:10,020
It worked out.

4123
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:12,800
I doing a ice house last
night with Sam and said,

4124
01:45:12,801 --> 01:45:13,220
I want to go.

4125
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:13,790
Oh cool,

4126
01:45:13,790 --> 01:45:13,990
cool.

4127
01:45:13,990 --> 01:45:16,220
You guys write your material out,

4128
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:17,260
write material.

4129
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:17,961
Well you know what,

4130
01:45:17,961 --> 01:45:21,860
because hanging out with you for
fucking 20 years in the comedy clubs,

4131
01:45:21,861 --> 01:45:22,170
you,

4132
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:22,851
we stress,

4133
01:45:22,851 --> 01:45:23,870
you got to write shit out.

4134
01:45:23,871 --> 01:45:24,740
You got to Russia,

4135
01:45:24,741 --> 01:45:25,750
you tell every company,

4136
01:45:25,751 --> 01:45:25,911
right?

4137
01:45:25,911 --> 01:45:26,330
Yah.

4138
01:45:26,330 --> 01:45:27,200
So that's what I was doing.

4139
01:45:27,201 --> 01:45:29,660
I was writing everything out and a Joe,

4140
01:45:29,661 --> 01:45:30,111
he told me,

4141
01:45:30,111 --> 01:45:31,040
he goes right now,

4142
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:32,780
maybe you shouldn't write shit out.

4143
01:45:32,781 --> 01:45:34,550
Just go out there and just free ball,

4144
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:35,540
just have some ideas.

4145
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:35,900
And I said,

4146
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:36,860
are you sure?

4147
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:37,731
And he said,

4148
01:45:37,731 --> 01:45:37,951
yeah.

4149
01:45:37,951 --> 01:45:40,030
So I did a couple of
spots with them at the,

4150
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,083
uh,

4151
01:45:41,330 --> 01:45:42,440
Ontario Improv.

4152
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:44,270
And those are,

4153
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:46,850
those are two of the best
shows I've done with Joey.

4154
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:48,140
So I decided to do that.

4155
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:49,580
Just have instead of write everything out,

4156
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:51,230
maybe write out the funny,

4157
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:52,011
you know what I mean,

4158
01:45:52,011 --> 01:45:56,610
but just kind of go out there
and repealing the same set over,

4159
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:58,820
doing new set to retire
every sets mixed up.

4160
01:45:58,821 --> 01:45:59,654
Different

4161
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:05,000
bullet points or like what's like say
if you had a bid on building a table,

4162
01:46:05,001 --> 01:46:05,680
whatever.

4163
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:07,070
Like it's the bullet points,

4164
01:46:07,071 --> 01:46:08,960
the funny parts you have memorized.

4165
01:46:08,961 --> 01:46:09,320
Yeah.

4166
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:13,160
The line like memorize the fund
and then the way you set it up,

4167
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:14,090
you're going to have to kind of,

4168
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,250
I kinda just go for it
cause it's more natural.

4169
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:16,791
Exactly.

4170
01:46:16,791 --> 01:46:18,590
Cause if you start memorizing shit,

4171
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:19,843
um,

4172
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:22,670
it takes away from the spontaneity.

4173
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:23,370
Yeah.

4174
01:46:23,370 --> 01:46:24,170
It just doesn't,

4175
01:46:24,170 --> 01:46:24,920
it's not funny.

4176
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,150
You can find it in there though.

4177
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:26,960
The spontaneity.

4178
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,760
Even though you have a
structure you can play with.

4179
01:46:28,761 --> 01:46:29,270
The one thing,

4180
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:31,370
the one thing that I've
learned for me anyways,

4181
01:46:31,371 --> 01:46:32,330
like I watch,

4182
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:37,040
I still watch Chapelle over and over
and just like you know it for me,

4183
01:46:37,130 --> 01:46:37,750
like the,

4184
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:42,110
the latest Chappelle when he tells a story
and he's telling you like a 10 minute

4185
01:46:42,111 --> 01:46:43,460
story of how shit went down.

4186
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:44,840
To me that's the funniest.

4187
01:46:44,841 --> 01:46:46,640
She had an actual real event,

4188
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:48,020
like the mafia story,

4189
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:49,760
the Russian mafia story
with Bert Kreischer.

4190
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:50,040
Yeah,

4191
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,720
it's an actual story,

4192
01:46:51,830 --> 01:46:51,990
right.

4193
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:55,890
Then you see how real it is when he's
describing it instead of trying to make up

4194
01:46:55,891 --> 01:46:57,390
a joke and trying to find funny,

4195
01:46:57,690 --> 01:47:00,770
stick to funny stories and then that'll,

4196
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:02,520
and then from there you could kind of,

4197
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:03,050
you don't know,

4198
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:06,690
you know Joe's shooting mine on Monday
night in Vegas and the shooting six of

4199
01:47:06,691 --> 01:47:07,100
them,

4200
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:07,933
not just six.

4201
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:09,300
So there's six comics,

4202
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:10,320
30 minute specials,

4203
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:12,180
but big j auctions in that.

4204
01:47:12,190 --> 01:47:13,023
Who's hilarious?

4205
01:47:13,230 --> 01:47:14,500
Christina P.

4206
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:15,980
Thompson Arrows wife's is in that.

4207
01:47:16,770 --> 01:47:18,390
She's doing that because
she just didn't know.

4208
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:20,340
I wonder why.

4209
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:22,050
Just blowing the fuck up.

4210
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:22,411
I know,

4211
01:47:22,411 --> 01:47:25,620
but why not just shave it and do an
hour trying to extra bloat that bank,

4212
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:27,420
I love her at that extra blow up.

4213
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:28,831
But with Joe.

4214
01:47:28,831 --> 01:47:29,420
Yeah,

4215
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:29,750
Joey's,

4216
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:30,200
yeah.

4217
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,190
And then they shoot to 30 minutes for him.

4218
01:47:32,191 --> 01:47:34,170
He shoots on Monday night in Vegas,

4219
01:47:34,171 --> 01:47:35,040
Sun Room in Vegas.

4220
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:36,540
But when you do those 30 minutes,

4221
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:36,991
cause I,

4222
01:47:36,991 --> 01:47:37,321
you know,

4223
01:47:37,321 --> 01:47:38,790
I'm used to dealing with you and I'm like,

4224
01:47:38,791 --> 01:47:38,911
oh.

4225
01:47:38,911 --> 01:47:39,271
And you're like,

4226
01:47:39,271 --> 01:47:39,961
I'm gonna shoot it here.

4227
01:47:39,961 --> 01:47:40,860
This is what's happening.

4228
01:47:41,070 --> 01:47:41,520
And there's,

4229
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:41,731
you know,

4230
01:47:41,731 --> 01:47:43,110
you have say in marketing with that,

4231
01:47:43,111 --> 01:47:45,410
it's different that can
shoot in here selling.

4232
01:47:45,411 --> 01:47:46,021
He's going to be,

4233
01:47:46,021 --> 01:47:48,900
this is where the time different animal.

4234
01:47:49,530 --> 01:47:49,830
Yeah.

4235
01:47:49,830 --> 01:47:51,150
It's a different animal for sure.

4236
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:54,540
Brendan selling out COBB's
in San Francisco by himself.

4237
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:55,590
Holy Shit.

4238
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:57,590
That's fucking huge man.

4239
01:47:57,591 --> 01:47:59,280
So that consumer in Boston,

4240
01:47:59,340 --> 01:47:59,760
the what?

4241
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:02,190
The Wilbur Theater and house
and it's 1100 somethings.

4242
01:48:02,230 --> 01:48:03,270
Oh Shit.

4243
01:48:03,450 --> 01:48:04,231
God Damn.

4244
01:48:04,231 --> 01:48:04,950
I told him he's,

4245
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:09,420
he's probably one of the fastest rising
comics coming from never doing standup.

4246
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:10,500
I mean,

4247
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,630
who else is there really ever,

4248
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:13,320
ever.

4249
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,060
Right low ever for sure.

4250
01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:17,580
That's what I'm telling stand up to
selling out theaters in two years.

4251
01:48:17,581 --> 01:48:18,414
Did you know this?

4252
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:19,111
I mean,

4253
01:48:19,111 --> 01:48:19,800
it's incredible.

4254
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:20,490
It's incredible.

4255
01:48:20,490 --> 01:48:24,630
Doing like fucking an
hour and killing like you,

4256
01:48:24,631 --> 01:48:25,530
you put in the work,

4257
01:48:25,531 --> 01:48:25,741
dude.

4258
01:48:25,741 --> 01:48:27,960
That's what I tell other young comics.

4259
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:32,880
I say pay attention to him because this
is what happens when a person takes pro

4260
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:37,020
athlete type of discipline
and applies it to stand out.

4261
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:40,320
That discipline is everything
that work ethic and discipline,

4262
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:41,560
that's everything mad.

4263
01:48:41,561 --> 01:48:43,950
It changes the whole game because
a lot of comics are funny,

4264
01:48:44,130 --> 01:48:45,360
but they're fucking lazy.

4265
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:47,660
They're fucking lazy and they don't they,

4266
01:48:47,930 --> 01:48:49,920
that's why I like you.

4267
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:52,950
You're dealing with guys who do the same
material year after year after year and

4268
01:48:52,951 --> 01:48:53,910
they never do specials.

4269
01:48:53,911 --> 01:48:57,510
There's a bunch of those guys that are
really talented guys and they just never,

4270
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:00,300
they never bothered to record anything
cause they don't want to have to,

4271
01:49:00,301 --> 01:49:00,720
right.

4272
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:01,680
They don't have to rewrite.

4273
01:49:01,710 --> 01:49:03,120
It doesn't make sense to me like it.

4274
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:04,710
We'd talk about work
ethic and stuff like that.

4275
01:49:04,711 --> 01:49:06,810
I see these other comedians
who maybe aren't doing it,

4276
01:49:06,811 --> 01:49:07,644
but like,

4277
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:11,070
don't you see the guys like
Rogan and burn deleah like,

4278
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:12,610
do you want to be on there?

4279
01:49:12,730 --> 01:49:14,100
You want to do what they do,

4280
01:49:14,101 --> 01:49:14,934
right?

4281
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:16,290
Oh,

4282
01:49:16,290 --> 01:49:17,220
he's got a guillotine.

4283
01:49:19,590 --> 01:49:20,423
Nasty.

4284
01:49:21,070 --> 01:49:22,170
It's the same with fighting.

4285
01:49:22,171 --> 01:49:23,310
Just like you look at GSP,

4286
01:49:23,311 --> 01:49:24,570
it's like he's doing this and this.

4287
01:49:24,571 --> 01:49:25,890
Don't you want to be like that?

4288
01:49:26,010 --> 01:49:27,720
She'll probably follow that plan.

4289
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:29,150
But people got scared mass.

4290
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:30,001
But here's the thing,

4291
01:49:30,001 --> 01:49:32,400
you get scared and then
you finally get some tools,

4292
01:49:32,401 --> 01:49:32,700
right?

4293
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:35,400
Like say if you have an act like
you put together an act and you're,

4294
01:49:35,401 --> 01:49:36,121
you're like,

4295
01:49:36,121 --> 01:49:38,070
before we ready to film a special,

4296
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:40,080
the idea is that your act is killing,

4297
01:49:40,081 --> 01:49:40,351
right?

4298
01:49:40,351 --> 01:49:41,310
So if your act as killing,

4299
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:42,990
you've got molden at home.

4300
01:49:43,110 --> 01:49:44,370
He didn't want to let that go.

4301
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,330
Like I got to let it go.

4302
01:49:45,410 --> 01:49:46,243
Oh,

4303
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:47,100
I can't wait.

4304
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:47,460
Decide,

4305
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:47,830
go.

4306
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:48,070
I gotta

4307
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,903
take it aside.

4308
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:50,200
But if you don't do that,

4309
01:49:50,201 --> 01:49:51,310
you don't keep getting better.

4310
01:49:51,311 --> 01:49:52,144
But here's the thing.

4311
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:53,590
One thing that I've learned,

4312
01:49:53,591 --> 01:49:56,470
even though there was a lot of fear
in letting go that old material,

4313
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:57,970
you always write new,

4314
01:49:58,030 --> 01:50:00,640
better material because
you're a better comedian now.

4315
01:50:00,641 --> 01:50:02,050
You understand comedy better.

4316
01:50:02,610 --> 01:50:02,920
Yes.

4317
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:03,760
You're just going to do better.

4318
01:50:03,761 --> 01:50:04,541
Like for me,

4319
01:50:04,541 --> 01:50:06,890
like letting go that like
Bruce Jenner bit God,

4320
01:50:06,891 --> 01:50:08,050
it was so hard to let go.

4321
01:50:08,051 --> 01:50:10,540
I didn't want to let that one
go because of the special.

4322
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:11,503
Yeah,

4323
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:12,220
no,

4324
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:12,910
but I couldn't,

4325
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:14,590
I couldn't do that if
my life depended on it.

4326
01:50:14,591 --> 01:50:15,640
Right now I don't know how it works.

4327
01:50:15,641 --> 01:50:18,250
I don't know the beats and
I wouldn't do it right.

4328
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:23,880
But when you get to a point when you
get a bit so tight and so finely tuned,

4329
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:27,940
that's when you got to let it go and
then you move on to the next one.

4330
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:31,480
And I've got some shit now that that's
killing harder than that bit did.

4331
01:50:31,690 --> 01:50:33,640
But when I first started doing,

4332
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:34,091
you know,

4333
01:50:34,091 --> 01:50:34,960
a year ago,

4334
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:39,961
year plus ago when I first released that
Netflix special and then I went right

4335
01:50:40,001 --> 01:50:43,600
into write new material and doing
new material is on shaky legs mat.

4336
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:46,150
And a lot of people don't
like that shaky legs feeling.

4337
01:50:46,151 --> 01:50:47,050
You get real scared,

4338
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:49,030
but you got to go through that.

4339
01:50:49,031 --> 01:50:49,751
You've got to go through that.

4340
01:50:49,751 --> 01:50:52,450
And that's what makes you grow
and continue to get better.

4341
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:52,961
But you know,

4342
01:50:52,961 --> 01:50:57,910
one of the things that helps me a lot
that a Jeremiah Watkins show that stand up

4343
01:50:57,911 --> 01:50:58,750
on the spot,

4344
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:02,560
dude that is a fucking farm for material.

4345
01:51:02,590 --> 01:51:05,580
So much fun because people yell
like someone look at you and go

4346
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:10,720
of of hurricanes and you
lay man hurricanes and then
you start talking chin.

4347
01:51:11,090 --> 01:51:12,650
Every now and then they'll say something.

4348
01:51:12,651 --> 01:51:14,510
It has a bar and the crowd,

4349
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:16,120
the crowd knows like you don't,

4350
01:51:16,130 --> 01:51:17,250
you just riff and they're not looking,

4351
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:17,511
you know,

4352
01:51:17,511 --> 01:51:18,830
they know you're not shooting special.

4353
01:51:19,190 --> 01:51:22,100
Everyone's pretty loosey Goosey
and they'll yell like strippers.

4354
01:51:22,101 --> 01:51:23,120
I'm like that about them.

4355
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:24,380
Yeah,

4356
01:51:24,770 --> 01:51:25,820
it's amazing dude.

4357
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,690
It's an amazing resource to have
those shows where someone just yelled,

4358
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,220
he used to call it Thunderpussy.

4359
01:51:31,221 --> 01:51:32,210
They used to do it in the,

4360
01:51:32,211 --> 01:51:32,600
uh,

4361
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:34,310
the ice house to the sun.

4362
01:51:34,311 --> 01:51:34,791
It was easy.

4363
01:51:34,791 --> 01:51:35,690
Great name for it.

4364
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:36,740
So intense.

4365
01:51:36,770 --> 01:51:38,300
Just so sales get up on the spot.

4366
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:41,631
But,

4367
01:51:41,631 --> 01:51:42,020
uh,

4368
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:42,201
yeah,

4369
01:51:42,201 --> 01:51:43,430
I've been doing that show for years.

4370
01:51:43,431 --> 01:51:44,420
That's helped me a lot.

4371
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:45,363
It's a lot of,

4372
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:46,580
and I told Jeremiah,

4373
01:51:46,581 --> 01:51:51,290
you were telling me how you got bits
from it and it's the same thing with

4374
01:51:51,291 --> 01:51:51,621
fighting.

4375
01:51:51,621 --> 01:51:52,670
Like if we had a training room,

4376
01:51:52,671 --> 01:51:53,301
you know how this is,

4377
01:51:53,301 --> 01:51:54,134
well if you guys know this,

4378
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:57,620
there's one guy who's fucking these
really good and you know maybe tapped out

4379
01:51:57,621 --> 01:51:58,011
last time.

4380
01:51:58,011 --> 01:51:58,580
He kinda,

4381
01:51:58,580 --> 01:52:01,200
you don't mean to you avoid him because
he was going to be the tub surrounding.

4382
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:02,053
Like I'll just go over here.

4383
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:04,430
That's how I was with
Jeremiah on stamp on the spot.

4384
01:52:04,670 --> 01:52:04,980
I was like,

4385
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:05,540
man,

4386
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:06,410
I know my stuff.

4387
01:52:06,411 --> 01:52:07,250
I write all my stuff,

4388
01:52:07,251 --> 01:52:09,290
I know what I want to do here
and I can have fun with that.

4389
01:52:09,470 --> 01:52:10,640
But on the spot,

4390
01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:11,120
I dunno,

4391
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:13,070
man kept canceling on him.

4392
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:15,050
He would text me like this week I'm like,

4393
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:15,501
yeah,

4394
01:52:15,501 --> 01:52:15,950
for sure.

4395
01:52:15,950 --> 01:52:17,150
Then the next day like dude,

4396
01:52:17,151 --> 01:52:18,240
I'm swamped them

4397
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:21,913
and then I told them,

4398
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:22,550
hey,

4399
01:52:22,550 --> 01:52:23,570
next time you asked me to do it,

4400
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:24,950
no I'm lying to you.

4401
01:52:24,980 --> 01:52:26,930
I need to do this cause I'm scared of it.

4402
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:27,830
What's the show called?

4403
01:52:27,890 --> 01:52:29,000
Stand up on the spot.

4404
01:52:29,001 --> 01:52:30,350
Jeremiah Watkins belly around.

4405
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:32,060
I think there's a show that night.

4406
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:32,953
Every Tuesday night.

4407
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:33,951
Tuesday night.

4408
01:52:33,951 --> 01:52:34,880
Stand up on the spot.

4409
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:35,743
Yeah.

4410
01:52:35,990 --> 01:52:36,190
No,

4411
01:52:36,190 --> 01:52:37,090
not every Tuesday night.

4412
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:38,153
Every Tuesday night.

4413
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:38,840
Yeah,

4414
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:42,410
that's why I'm saying I think it's
this Tuesday by way I would try that.

4415
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:42,681
Am I?

4416
01:52:42,681 --> 01:52:43,514
Am I going crazy?

4417
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:46,160
I thought he said cause
I was to do three spots

4418
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:46,851
in the night and I go,

4419
01:52:46,851 --> 01:52:47,010
hey,

4420
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:48,440
you have to with a spontaneous no,

4421
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:49,390
cause I went last Friday,

4422
01:52:49,390 --> 01:52:51,140
calmed me stone and stone another spot.

4423
01:52:51,170 --> 01:52:52,460
I don't think it's until June.

4424
01:52:52,610 --> 01:52:53,001
Honestly.

4425
01:52:53,001 --> 01:52:56,330
I think he just did it and I was out
of town and I was on his last one.

4426
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,050
When was that?

4427
01:52:57,050 --> 01:52:57,860
How long ago?

4428
01:52:57,860 --> 01:52:58,693
Two weeks ago.

4429
01:52:59,000 --> 01:52:59,241
Yeah.

4430
01:52:59,241 --> 01:53:00,590
So the next one would be like two weeks.

4431
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:01,513
All right,

4432
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:03,950
that sounds like fun.

4433
01:53:04,010 --> 01:53:04,731
Oh it's the best.

4434
01:53:04,731 --> 01:53:06,740
June 12th June 12th there you go.

4435
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:07,161
Tuesday,

4436
01:53:07,161 --> 01:53:07,994
June 12th

4437
01:53:09,370 --> 01:53:10,700
I fucking love it man.

4438
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:11,050
It's,

4439
01:53:11,050 --> 01:53:13,040
it's really fun and
it's always packed too.

4440
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:13,611
Yeah,

4441
01:53:13,611 --> 01:53:14,121
it's packed.

4442
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:14,540
And again,

4443
01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:15,860
the crowd knows what's going on.

4444
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:17,990
Did that for a while after your shows?

4445
01:53:17,991 --> 01:53:20,090
He would do like question and
answer and there was nothing,

4446
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:20,931
there was nothing.

4447
01:53:20,931 --> 01:53:24,650
Anybody could have yelled out that
you couldn't tie into some pass bit.

4448
01:53:24,710 --> 01:53:25,370
You know what I mean?

4449
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:26,060
You had,

4450
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:26,960
there wasn't anything.

4451
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:28,160
Yeah,

4452
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:28,911
it's better though.

4453
01:53:28,911 --> 01:53:33,370
The standup on the spot thing is better
because it's not that it's not past

4454
01:53:33,371 --> 01:53:34,130
bits,

4455
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:37,390
it's all just can't do
material if you know,

4456
01:53:37,450 --> 01:53:38,300
they tell you no,

4457
01:53:38,330 --> 01:53:39,001
no material.

4458
01:53:39,001 --> 01:53:43,220
It's gotta be why people have done
it and done their act two and Pete,

4459
01:53:43,221 --> 01:53:44,300
the crowd gets mad.

4460
01:53:44,330 --> 01:53:45,320
They know they can,

4461
01:53:45,321 --> 01:53:47,270
they know what's up
cause you know it's not,

4462
01:53:47,271 --> 01:53:48,920
you can tell what's off the top and went,

4463
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:49,340
yeah,

4464
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:50,010
yeah,

4465
01:53:50,010 --> 01:53:50,540
yeah,

4466
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:50,930
yeah.

4467
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:52,940
Do you remember when we
did fan Q and a at Wilbert?

4468
01:53:52,941 --> 01:53:54,050
So I did my show and then we'll,

4469
01:53:54,051 --> 01:53:54,231
you know,

4470
01:53:54,231 --> 01:53:54,681
Boston,

4471
01:53:54,681 --> 01:53:56,030
it was late and you know,

4472
01:53:56,031 --> 01:53:57,260
the dudes were drunk.

4473
01:53:57,830 --> 01:53:59,140
I kept flying.

4474
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:00,233
Heckler

4475
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:03,200
fucking went nuclear on.

4476
01:54:03,201 --> 01:54:04,034
The guy's like,

4477
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:08,970
it's typically isn't how my fake
questions go and fucking get a scarf on

4478
01:54:12,190 --> 01:54:13,023
fire.

4479
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:14,030
All right,

4480
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:15,980
well that's it for big questions.

4481
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:16,761
Where'd it go?

4482
01:54:16,761 --> 01:54:17,594
Fuck face.

4483
01:54:17,990 --> 01:54:18,181
Well,

4484
01:54:18,181 --> 01:54:18,830
he was just,

4485
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:20,900
just trying so hard to get attention.

4486
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:24,110
I've witnessed many,

4487
01:54:24,111 --> 01:54:27,110
many people getting torched by Joe once.

4488
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:27,611
It's,

4489
01:54:27,611 --> 01:54:27,890
it's,

4490
01:54:27,890 --> 01:54:28,580
it's awesome.

4491
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:29,413
It's awesome.

4492
01:54:29,690 --> 01:54:31,340
It's awesome watching Joe because Joe,

4493
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:34,700
he doesn't want to
release until the guide.

4494
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:37,370
It's clear 100% and he deserves it.

4495
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:38,780
So a guy will yell and he's like,

4496
01:54:38,781 --> 01:54:40,010
calm down everything and he's like,

4497
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:41,170
and like inside,

4498
01:54:41,190 --> 01:54:41,850
like keep going.

4499
01:54:41,850 --> 01:54:44,690
So I could just feel guilty.

4500
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:46,430
So when Joe Decides to go off,

4501
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:47,660
it's over son.

4502
01:54:47,661 --> 01:54:49,740
There's no way I dealt with a mic.

4503
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:50,960
Forget Joe without a Mike.

4504
01:54:50,961 --> 01:54:51,900
You're still fuck dude.

4505
01:54:53,530 --> 01:54:57,530
I saw dank to go hard on these
two girls in the front row when,

4506
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:58,640
uh,

4507
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:01,010
when I was at the comm
store last Tuesday night,

4508
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:02,301
oh my God,

4509
01:55:02,301 --> 01:55:03,290
they wouldn't quit talking.

4510
01:55:03,291 --> 01:55:03,621
And he's like,

4511
01:55:03,621 --> 01:55:04,160
honey,

4512
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:05,240
you're trying to get through a story.

4513
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:06,650
And he was a longer story.

4514
01:55:06,651 --> 01:55:07,750
You could tell he's doing new material.

4515
01:55:07,751 --> 01:55:08,584
He's trying to get through it.

4516
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:09,680
They kept interrupting.

4517
01:55:09,681 --> 01:55:10,310
He's like,

4518
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:10,850
well,

4519
01:55:10,850 --> 01:55:12,170
I can go in on you if you want.

4520
01:55:12,171 --> 01:55:12,921
Say another thing.

4521
01:55:12,921 --> 01:55:13,754
And she's goes,

4522
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:15,051
another thing goes,

4523
01:55:15,051 --> 01:55:15,801
do you want to do this?

4524
01:55:15,801 --> 01:55:17,710
And then just fucking cuckoo.

4525
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:18,081
Cuckoo,

4526
01:55:18,081 --> 01:55:18,411
cuckoo.

4527
01:55:18,411 --> 01:55:20,000
I mean it was just brutal,

4528
01:55:20,001 --> 01:55:20,510
man.

4529
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:21,560
It makes a show though,

4530
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:23,060
cause he did about 20 minutes of it.

4531
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:26,480
There's a lot of fucking heckling
in at the comedy store lately.

4532
01:55:26,810 --> 01:55:28,510
People want to become a part of the show.

4533
01:55:28,540 --> 01:55:29,500
That's a terrible idea.

4534
01:55:31,510 --> 01:55:32,990
They should be a warning warning.

4535
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:37,670
Oh there's two girls in the front row
the other night just drunk and sloppy and

4536
01:55:37,671 --> 01:55:39,700
talking really loud.

4537
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:40,700
You know,

4538
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:42,380
like you're onstage and you hear them.

4539
01:55:42,381 --> 01:55:43,260
He tried to ignore them,

4540
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:44,010
but then you see the

4541
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,590
rest of the crowd going like this.

4542
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:46,860
That's when you have to acknowledge it.

4543
01:55:46,861 --> 01:55:49,020
You have to see people
turning towards him.

4544
01:55:49,021 --> 01:55:49,251
You're like,

4545
01:55:49,251 --> 01:55:49,800
all right,

4546
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:51,480
I got to play copier most of the time.

4547
01:55:51,481 --> 01:55:52,770
The stores on top of that,

4548
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:55,770
which is a new thing in the old days.

4549
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:56,221
Yeah.

4550
01:55:56,221 --> 01:55:59,480
The way I got good at
heckling at hecklers,

4551
01:55:59,490 --> 01:56:02,230
one of the big ways is there was
no crowd control at the store.

4552
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:06,570
I mean Zero Mad Max because in the
old days when I used to go there,

4553
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:10,840
the fucking comedians
were all doorman and,

4554
01:56:10,841 --> 01:56:11,310
and uh,

4555
01:56:11,310 --> 01:56:12,150
security.

4556
01:56:12,151 --> 01:56:13,680
Everything was all comedians.

4557
01:56:13,710 --> 01:56:14,850
It's not that anymore.

4558
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:16,740
Now they have like legit security,

4559
01:56:16,741 --> 01:56:17,700
like big guys.

4560
01:56:17,850 --> 01:56:20,670
They take care of everything
people have earpieces on.

4561
01:56:20,671 --> 01:56:21,690
They're in control of everything.

4562
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:26,900
When the store picked up the business
like about three years ago when it really

4563
01:56:27,901 --> 01:56:28,980
took off three,

4564
01:56:28,981 --> 01:56:29,814
four years ago,

4565
01:56:29,970 --> 01:56:31,050
that's when they'd go,

4566
01:56:31,051 --> 01:56:31,621
okay look,

4567
01:56:31,621 --> 01:56:33,510
this place is sold out
every fucking night.

4568
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:34,950
And then a guy got murdered there.

4569
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:36,840
There was a murder on the front porch.

4570
01:56:37,050 --> 01:56:37,381
Yeah,

4571
01:56:37,381 --> 01:56:39,450
Guy got shot to death on the front porch.

4572
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:40,411
Yeah,

4573
01:56:40,411 --> 01:56:42,120
it was some gang related type thing.

4574
01:56:42,730 --> 01:56:46,860
Some guy did something to somebody and
apparently that dude who got killed,

4575
01:56:46,861 --> 01:56:51,240
he had some really dark
shit on his Facebook to like
pictures of people tied up

4576
01:56:51,241 --> 01:56:52,610
and shit and uh,

4577
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:53,341
they murdered him.

4578
01:56:53,341 --> 01:56:56,670
They shot him right in the front porch
and from then on they put like a super

4579
01:56:56,671 --> 01:56:59,550
intense security system
there and cameras everywhere.

4580
01:56:59,670 --> 01:57:03,120
Hired real security everywhere
and ramped up the place.

4581
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:06,420
Stop letting people walk
into the parking lot.

4582
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:07,620
That was a big one too,

4583
01:57:07,621 --> 01:57:10,440
because people would just stroll into
the parking lot and these drunks,

4584
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:13,170
people would be backing up their cars
and people would be getting hit by

4585
01:57:13,171 --> 01:57:14,070
people's cars.

4586
01:57:14,071 --> 01:57:14,760
A shit show.

4587
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:15,570
What is the Shit Shit.

4588
01:57:15,570 --> 01:57:18,780
Do you think's going to happen to the
comedy store now that Mitsis passed away?

4589
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,020
Do you think that DePaul is,

4590
01:57:20,850 --> 01:57:22,320
the business is better than ever?

4591
01:57:22,350 --> 01:57:26,190
The thing about it is it's sold out every
night and it's making a lot of money.

4592
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:28,800
Like if you go to the comedy
store on a Tuesday night,

4593
01:57:28,801 --> 01:57:30,450
you're going to have a sold out main room.

4594
01:57:30,451 --> 01:57:31,830
400 people sold out.

4595
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:32,071
Oh,

4596
01:57:32,071 --> 01:57:36,270
our hundred and 70 people
sold out belly room 80 people.

4597
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:38,340
I mean that is big money,

4598
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:41,130
but every night to two shows a night off,

4599
01:57:41,131 --> 01:57:42,090
that doesn't say two,

4600
01:57:42,091 --> 01:57:46,590
two main room shows every night are both
sold out now thousands and thousands of

4601
01:57:46,591 --> 01:57:48,270
people funneling into that place.

4602
01:57:48,271 --> 01:57:51,900
As far as like from the beginning of
the shows that started at eight o'clock

4603
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:53,100
till two o'clock in the morning,

4604
01:57:53,101 --> 01:57:54,240
people are buying drinks.

4605
01:57:54,330 --> 01:57:57,370
It's make money isn't enough
money to keep it running back.

4606
01:57:57,760 --> 01:57:58,051
Yes,

4607
01:57:58,051 --> 01:57:59,070
it's very profitable.

4608
01:57:59,210 --> 01:58:02,100
It making more money now than
in the history of the club.

4609
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:03,810
Never made more money ever.

4610
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:05,730
So it's a viable,

4611
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:06,631
I mean it's crazy.

4612
01:58:06,631 --> 01:58:08,310
It's all within the last
three and a half years.

4613
01:58:08,311 --> 01:58:09,750
Three and a half since you've been back.

4614
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:10,051
Yeah.

4615
01:58:10,051 --> 01:58:11,160
It all just boom.

4616
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:12,121
It took off.

4617
01:58:12,121 --> 01:58:13,380
This podcast blew it up.

4618
01:58:13,410 --> 01:58:13,760
Yup.

4619
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:16,350
Singlehandedly you come and part
of it and they don't deny it.

4620
01:58:16,351 --> 01:58:17,580
I talked to management there.

4621
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:18,540
They don't deny it.

4622
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:19,060
I asked him like,

4623
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:19,530
what?

4624
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:19,880
You know,

4625
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:20,520
what do you,

4626
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:21,810
what do you think is the cause of this?

4627
01:58:21,870 --> 01:58:22,590
Boom?

4628
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:24,270
He said Joe Rogan.

4629
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:25,710
They'll say Joe rogue.

4630
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:26,580
Huge part of it.

4631
01:58:26,610 --> 01:58:28,170
And then you have all the
comics coming through.

4632
01:58:28,171 --> 01:58:29,280
It's the golden age of comedy,

4633
01:58:29,281 --> 01:58:29,431
right?

4634
01:58:29,431 --> 01:58:29,701
Yeah.

4635
01:58:29,701 --> 01:58:31,080
It's also the talent there.

4636
01:58:31,081 --> 01:58:32,400
There's so much talent there.

4637
01:58:32,430 --> 01:58:34,590
It's crazy how good those shows are.

4638
01:58:34,591 --> 01:58:36,240
I mean you look at the
lineup sometime you're like,

4639
01:58:36,241 --> 01:58:38,390
what the fuck did I ran?

4640
01:58:38,430 --> 01:58:41,710
I ran over cause Patton
Oswalt's doing standup again.

4641
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:42,340
I've ran

4642
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:43,220
over to see him cause he's the,

4643
01:58:43,221 --> 01:58:46,900
he's there for the whole week and usually
he's a New York comic who's just up at

4644
01:58:46,901 --> 01:58:48,850

4645
01:58:48,851 --> 01:58:49,820

4646
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:50,200
what you mean?

4647
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:51,033
Yeah,

4648
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:51,520
no,

4649
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:51,761
I know,

4650
01:58:51,761 --> 01:58:53,950
but he was in New York for a
while when he was doing stuff,

4651
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:54,813
starting to stand up.

4652
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:57,550
I only saw him post them
out in New York as it got.

4653
01:58:57,551 --> 01:59:00,010
I can't wait for him to come back
and started doing it again and again.

4654
01:59:00,011 --> 01:59:00,161
Yeah,

4655
01:59:00,161 --> 01:59:01,870
I saw him doing spots in New York a lot.

4656
01:59:01,871 --> 01:59:02,350
Interesting.

4657
01:59:02,350 --> 01:59:02,481
Yeah.

4658
01:59:02,481 --> 01:59:03,490
And that's on back here.

4659
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:04,241
He's a good guy,

4660
01:59:04,241 --> 01:59:04,630
man.

4661
01:59:04,630 --> 01:59:04,820
Yeah.

4662
01:59:04,820 --> 01:59:08,950
When Tom Papa Patton Oswald
then Brogan than delete.

4663
01:59:08,951 --> 01:59:09,521
I mean nuts.

4664
01:59:09,521 --> 01:59:14,200
Top top five guys at the comedy store

4665
01:59:14,201 --> 01:59:14,920

4666
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:15,700
Um,

burrs there all the time.

4668
01:59:17,381 --> 01:59:18,790
Delay is there all the time.

4669
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,220
Theo van is a motherfucking monster.

4670
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:22,690
He's there all the time.

4671
01:59:23,410 --> 01:59:24,430
Uh,

4672
01:59:24,850 --> 01:59:25,480
who else?

4673
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:26,680
Who else would you go with?

4674
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:27,573
Uh,

4675
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,740
Hinchcliffe Spin Santina was a monster.

4676
01:59:29,741 --> 01:59:31,390
Santina was a monster.

4677
01:59:32,650 --> 01:59:33,281
Monster.

4678
01:59:33,281 --> 01:59:34,680
Christina's a monster.

4679
01:59:34,690 --> 01:59:36,730
A Bert Kreischer the time.

4680
01:59:36,731 --> 01:59:36,971
Man,

4681
01:59:36,971 --> 01:59:37,990
this is so many.

4682
01:59:37,991 --> 01:59:38,890
There's so many.

4683
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:39,580
Yeah,

4684
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:40,120
there's soap.

4685
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:40,741
Tom Pop out.

4686
01:59:40,741 --> 01:59:41,574
There's so many.

4687
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:42,933
Um,

4688
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:44,380
Neil Brennan,

4689
01:59:44,590 --> 01:59:44,981
they're there.

4690
01:59:44,981 --> 01:59:45,814
It's a fucking,

4691
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,560
it's a crazy place right now.

4692
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:48,430
It's crazy.

4693
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:49,240
Insane.

4694
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:50,073
Bobby Lee.

4695
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:52,300
I mean it's just killer after killer.

4696
01:59:52,450 --> 01:59:52,691
I mean,

4697
01:59:52,691 --> 01:59:54,880
I was walking by the Eliza Lessinger,

4698
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:56,740
Whitney Cummings walking by the or the,

4699
01:59:56,741 --> 01:59:59,110
or the other night and it was
just roars coming out of there.

4700
01:59:59,111 --> 01:59:59,531
And I was like,

4701
01:59:59,531 --> 02:00:00,760
this place is nuts.

4702
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:03,670
And then you go down the hallway and
there's roars coming out of the main room.

4703
02:00:03,671 --> 02:00:04,504
You grew up stairs.

4704
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:05,583
That's crazy.

4705
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:07,050
The greatest time ever for stand up.

4706
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:08,290
Greatest time ever.

4707
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:10,870
You go in there and you just
feel it man in the walls.

4708
02:00:10,871 --> 02:00:11,620
I don't know what it is.

4709
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:14,350
And then you go over to the laugh
factory and it's like an antique shop.

4710
02:00:14,351 --> 02:00:15,400
That's what Theo Vaughn says.

4711
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:20,410
When you feel like in an antique shop.

4712
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:20,561
Oh,

4713
02:00:20,561 --> 02:00:20,770
it,

4714
02:00:20,770 --> 02:00:22,270
oh my God.

4715
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:23,223
You can't say that.

4716
02:00:23,530 --> 02:00:23,711
Yeah,

4717
02:00:23,711 --> 02:00:24,350
you can.

4718
02:00:24,350 --> 02:00:24,650
Yo.

4719
02:00:24,650 --> 02:00:26,290
And when they started filming people,

4720
02:00:26,291 --> 02:00:26,900
everybody was like,

4721
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:27,733
what?

4722
02:00:27,850 --> 02:00:28,511
They started filming.

4723
02:00:28,511 --> 02:00:29,830
People just put it up on Youtube.

4724
02:00:29,831 --> 02:00:31,090
They say they're not doing it anymore.

4725
02:00:31,091 --> 02:00:33,340
But everybody just lost
all faith in that place.

4726
02:00:33,341 --> 02:00:33,670
They're like,

4727
02:00:33,670 --> 02:00:34,300
yeah,

4728
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:35,111
I still do spots.

4729
02:00:35,111 --> 02:00:36,250
Got Two spots where I can,

4730
02:00:36,251 --> 02:00:38,770
but they're not releasing my shit.

4731
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:40,480
The fact that they would do that,

4732
02:00:40,481 --> 02:00:45,481
it's like you guys are fucking mind and
then offering people half of the revenue

4733
02:00:45,730 --> 02:00:46,490
for Youtube.

4734
02:00:46,490 --> 02:00:47,323
Yeah,

4735
02:00:47,370 --> 02:00:48,400
just pull it up myself.

4736
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:48,861
It just,

4737
02:00:48,861 --> 02:00:49,694
it's what,

4738
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:51,190
what age are you living in?

4739
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:52,510
And then when confronted,

4740
02:00:52,511 --> 02:00:52,751
they're like,

4741
02:00:52,751 --> 02:00:52,931
well,

4742
02:00:52,931 --> 02:00:55,780
Tiffany hydros was making so much
money now and it's all because of this.

4743
02:00:55,810 --> 02:00:56,643
Oh yeah,

4744
02:00:56,710 --> 02:00:57,940
that's delusional.

4745
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:00,280
I don't know what he did.

4746
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:01,330
The guy who owns it,

4747
02:01:01,331 --> 02:01:05,530
I don't know why he did like letting those
kids do that and put those things up,

4748
02:01:05,531 --> 02:01:09,130
but people that had no idea about the
standup comedy business that I basically

4749
02:01:09,131 --> 02:01:13,720
interns just filming people sets and
putting all their material online.

4750
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:14,950
But the way it works is,

4751
02:01:14,951 --> 02:01:15,151
you know,

4752
02:01:15,151 --> 02:01:16,120
it's a close community,

4753
02:01:16,121 --> 02:01:19,150
so if Joe or whoever San te Santana goes,

4754
02:01:19,270 --> 02:01:19,511
hey,

4755
02:01:19,511 --> 02:01:21,310
they're film and don't
do it there anymore.

4756
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:23,093
I mean it just don't,

4757
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:24,830
everyone has those towns.

4758
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:25,520
They go there,

4759
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:26,341
demean you'll,

4760
02:01:26,341 --> 02:01:28,150
you'll have three sold out shows,

4761
02:01:28,450 --> 02:01:31,330
not even a half a mile
away at the comedy store.

4762
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:32,253
And then these,

4763
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:34,420
they're canceling show
cause there's no one there,

4764
02:01:34,930 --> 02:01:35,650
but that's a lot.

4765
02:01:35,650 --> 02:01:36,370
But then the Improv,

4766
02:01:36,370 --> 02:01:38,590
the improv still doing
the Improv's doing better.

4767
02:01:38,610 --> 02:01:38,990
Yeah.

4768
02:01:38,990 --> 02:01:39,350
Yeah.

4769
02:01:39,350 --> 02:01:40,183
And you know what,

4770
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:43,340
the Improv move that stupid
fucking piano off the stage.

4771
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:48,650
They put a platform on the side and push
the pan over to the piano would fuck up

4772
02:01:48,651 --> 02:01:51,620
the whole show for anybody that
was on the right side of the stage.

4773
02:01:51,650 --> 02:01:52,401
They can't see it.

4774
02:01:52,401 --> 02:01:54,590
He cannot see the ice
icehouse still bumping.

4775
02:01:54,591 --> 02:01:55,380
Right.

4776
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:55,900
Bumping.

4777
02:01:55,900 --> 02:01:56,240
Yeah.

4778
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:58,280
Especially when good comics are there.

4779
02:01:58,300 --> 02:01:58,780
You know,

4780
02:01:58,780 --> 02:01:59,541
with the ice house,

4781
02:01:59,541 --> 02:02:00,350
it's all about,

4782
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:04,010
they have to have good people to get
out to Pasadena because the ice house,

4783
02:02:04,550 --> 02:02:06,950
they've had sketchy lineups in the past.

4784
02:02:06,951 --> 02:02:07,160
Like,

4785
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:07,461
you know,

4786
02:02:07,461 --> 02:02:11,060
they'll have Joey and Brendan don't have
like real shows that are really funny

4787
02:02:11,061 --> 02:02:14,270
but to also have like some
bullshit and they had a,

4788
02:02:14,271 --> 02:02:17,870
for years they had some bullshit
which kills you because you get,

4789
02:02:18,110 --> 02:02:21,620
if you get known as that where it's
like the gimmicky bullshit guys,

4790
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:23,180
people aren't going to
go on a Friday night.

4791
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:25,090
Let's just go see who's
playing at the ice house.

4792
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:25,430
Yeah.

4793
02:02:25,430 --> 02:02:26,450
Like fuck that man.

4794
02:02:26,710 --> 02:02:26,930
Yeah.

4795
02:02:26,930 --> 02:02:28,410
People will go down there and they'll,

4796
02:02:28,490 --> 02:02:33,490
they'll expect to see like a Joey Diaz
show and then some whack ass fucking road

4797
02:02:34,071 --> 02:02:38,600
guy who does the cruise ships more
for the people that live in that area.

4798
02:02:38,601 --> 02:02:38,930
Like,

4799
02:02:38,930 --> 02:02:41,000
I mean isn't it like
a local kind of thing?

4800
02:02:41,630 --> 02:02:41,781
Yeah,

4801
02:02:41,781 --> 02:02:42,231
but it's still,

4802
02:02:42,231 --> 02:02:43,070
if it's a bad show,

4803
02:02:43,071 --> 02:02:43,970
it's a bad show.

4804
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,110
They don't want to come back.

4805
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:46,580
See if it's a good show.

4806
02:02:46,970 --> 02:02:48,590
Like they know when I do,

4807
02:02:48,620 --> 02:02:49,820
I do those Wednesday nights,

4808
02:02:49,821 --> 02:02:52,190
once a month there and they
know if you go down there,

4809
02:02:52,370 --> 02:02:53,900
I'm going to have killers on that show.

4810
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:55,970
You decide who goes on?

4811
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:56,181
Yeah,

4812
02:02:56,181 --> 02:02:56,821
it's all my show.

4813
02:02:56,821 --> 02:02:57,320
It's your show.

4814
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:57,920
Yeah.

4815
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,700
Wednesday nights.

4816
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:02,300
I do one Thursday night at the comedy
store every month and I do one Wednesday

4817
02:03:02,301 --> 02:03:03,260
night at the,

4818
02:03:03,261 --> 02:03:03,680
uh,

4819
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:04,513
at the ice house.

4820
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:06,020
Is it called Joe and friends?

4821
02:03:06,021 --> 02:03:06,231
Yeah,

4822
02:03:06,231 --> 02:03:07,070
Joe Rogan and friends.

4823
02:03:07,071 --> 02:03:12,071
And the next one at the comedy
store is June 21st June 21st yeah.

4824
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:16,670
And just in the green room,

4825
02:03:16,671 --> 02:03:19,310
we're like last time it was Tony Feo,

4826
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:20,810
you meet just hanging out back,

4827
02:03:20,811 --> 02:03:23,950
kind of like the best time I had been
out to two in the morning and we just

4828
02:03:23,951 --> 02:03:24,380
laugh.

4829
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:25,640
It's the best man.

4830
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:27,230
Those guys made me laugh so hard.

4831
02:03:27,231 --> 02:03:27,980
All you guys,

4832
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:28,813
well it's just,

4833
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:29,570
it's hard.

4834
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:33,950
It's hard to find groups of
people that are just savages,

4835
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:36,080
just loose and fun and ridiculous.

4836
02:03:36,230 --> 02:03:37,190
And then there,

4837
02:03:37,430 --> 02:03:38,600
this is the world they live in.

4838
02:03:38,601 --> 02:03:41,870
They live in this comedy worlds that
traveling around a lot fucking around

4839
02:03:41,910 --> 02:03:42,743
having a good time,

4840
02:03:43,060 --> 02:03:43,400
shit.

4841
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:45,850
And one person to say something
that it's just like cool.

4842
02:03:46,140 --> 02:03:48,410
It was fucking on.

4843
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:49,880
So that fun man,

4844
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:50,753
Fun Times.

4845
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:52,660
Everyone's baked.

4846
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:53,540
It's just,

4847
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:53,730
no,

4848
02:03:53,730 --> 02:03:55,730
it's just like high school
with your good friends.

4849
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:58,880
Like when you walk into like
first period and all your boys,

4850
02:03:58,881 --> 02:03:59,900
like we hit the front.

4851
02:03:59,901 --> 02:04:01,100
That's what it feels like.

4852
02:04:01,130 --> 02:04:01,851
What a lot of ways,

4853
02:04:01,851 --> 02:04:02,031
right?

4854
02:04:02,031 --> 02:04:04,190
Because one of the things
that happens as you get older,

4855
02:04:04,191 --> 02:04:06,170
as you lose all the fun cause you have,

4856
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:07,580
you have responsibilities,

4857
02:04:07,590 --> 02:04:10,250
you have a job you hate and you got to
get up in the morning and you're always

4858
02:04:10,251 --> 02:04:11,060
tired.

4859
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:11,680
And this is the,

4860
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:13,610
the world that most people live in.

4861
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,740
When you could find a place where it's
all basically people that avoided that

4862
02:04:18,741 --> 02:04:21,980
rat race and figured out some
sneaky way through the system.

4863
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:24,560
And that sneaky way is talking shit

4864
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:27,130
to no,

4865
02:04:27,130 --> 02:04:28,490
no sound check needed.

4866
02:04:28,770 --> 02:04:28,950
You know,

4867
02:04:28,950 --> 02:04:31,520
you just get on stage and it's uh,

4868
02:04:32,060 --> 02:04:32,630
you know,

4869
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:34,580
especially when high
level comedians go up,

4870
02:04:34,581 --> 02:04:35,160
like yourself,

4871
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:38,040
like you're going to get an hour of just

4872
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:40,740
laughs just over and over again.

4873
02:04:40,741 --> 02:04:42,180
It's way better than a funny movie.

4874
02:04:42,210 --> 02:04:42,390
Yeah.

4875
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:42,750
But if,

4876
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:43,920
if you're a new comic,

4877
02:04:43,921 --> 02:04:44,490
you can,

4878
02:04:44,490 --> 02:04:45,870
I'm getting education to,

4879
02:04:46,150 --> 02:04:46,390
yeah,

4880
02:04:46,390 --> 02:04:47,071
there's a little bit of that.

4881
02:04:47,071 --> 02:04:48,690
I can go in and get something
around with those people.

4882
02:04:49,630 --> 02:04:52,190
I can go listen to a deal.

4883
02:04:52,270 --> 02:04:54,660
Tell you about something that me and
Joe talked business and I'll go watch

4884
02:04:54,661 --> 02:04:55,351
Patton Oswald,

4885
02:04:55,351 --> 02:04:58,860
do his set and then I'll watch Joey
Diaz and then bill burrs coming in.

4886
02:04:58,890 --> 02:04:59,311
And for me,

4887
02:04:59,311 --> 02:05:00,660
as long as I've been doing comedy,

4888
02:05:00,661 --> 02:05:01,560
I still love it.

4889
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:02,610
I still love watching it.

4890
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:03,760
I still have watching it.

4891
02:05:03,761 --> 02:05:04,531
If someone's killing,

4892
02:05:04,531 --> 02:05:05,310
I still love it.

4893
02:05:05,310 --> 02:05:06,060
You know,

4894
02:05:06,060 --> 02:05:06,893
I love it.

4895
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:07,470
It's the,

4896
02:05:07,470 --> 02:05:08,303
it's just,

4897
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:12,930
it's a great form of entertainment and
I think it's necessary to cause people

4898
02:05:12,931 --> 02:05:14,820
get so serious about certain subjects.

4899
02:05:14,821 --> 02:05:18,900
If someone could just come along and
mock it and laugh at it so hard and then

4900
02:05:18,901 --> 02:05:19,680
you realize like,

4901
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:19,891
oh,

4902
02:05:19,891 --> 02:05:21,270
this is fucking ridiculous.

4903
02:05:21,450 --> 02:05:22,440
This is ridiculous.

4904
02:05:22,820 --> 02:05:24,540
And it alleviates pressure.

4905
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:29,600
What was fascinating to me the other
night with Tom Papa a Oswald and Tony

4906
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:30,181
Hinchcliffe,

4907
02:05:30,181 --> 02:05:33,480
they all had the same
premises on their joke,

4908
02:05:33,481 --> 02:05:34,740
but everything was,

4909
02:05:35,310 --> 02:05:37,470
each opinion was so different.

4910
02:05:37,471 --> 02:05:38,910
I was laughing so hard man.

4911
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:40,440
But you just see how
everyone is different.

4912
02:05:40,441 --> 02:05:42,430
But it's the popular subjects.

4913
02:05:42,431 --> 02:05:43,500
So like Trump,

4914
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:44,520
no,

4915
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:45,630
like sexual assault.

4916
02:05:46,220 --> 02:05:47,220
And it was so funny,

4917
02:05:47,221 --> 02:05:47,700
man.

4918
02:05:47,700 --> 02:05:48,291
I like Joe.

4919
02:05:48,291 --> 02:05:53,291
Is that I don't want to give away and
he's got a great back bid on that Neil

4920
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:56,040
Magni it's tough to take down,

4921
02:05:56,041 --> 02:05:56,520
Huh?

4922
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:57,121
Very death,

4923
02:05:57,121 --> 02:05:57,390
right?

4924
02:05:57,390 --> 02:05:59,700
Very wirey long.

4925
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:01,440
And who's this gentleman
that he's fighting?

4926
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:03,450
James James White.

4927
02:06:03,451 --> 02:06:05,670
Do you know anything
about Craig Craig White?

4928
02:06:06,190 --> 02:06:07,790
It was supposed to be a,

4929
02:06:12,850 --> 02:06:13,061
Oh,

4930
02:06:13,061 --> 02:06:13,990
why am I drawing a blank?

4931
02:06:13,991 --> 02:06:15,730
What's homeboys Gunnar Nelson.

4932
02:06:15,770 --> 02:06:16,603
Jesus Christ.

4933
02:06:17,110 --> 02:06:17,950
What happened at gunner?

4934
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:18,730
He got injured.

4935
02:06:18,730 --> 02:06:19,490
I'm not sure,

4936
02:06:19,490 --> 02:06:20,830
but I was going to be a hell of a fight.

4937
02:06:22,340 --> 02:06:23,130
Yo Matt.

4938
02:06:23,130 --> 02:06:23,680
Neat.

4939
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:27,520
Neil's beat some tough guys
speak Delvin Kelvin Gaslin.

4940
02:06:27,550 --> 02:06:28,140
Yeah.

4941
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:30,240
Beat Kelvin [inaudible] Hendricks.

4942
02:06:30,970 --> 02:06:33,940
He beat Hector Lombard
injury that required surgery.

4943
02:06:34,350 --> 02:06:38,080
Hector Lombard Kelvin gas lunch
on Hendrix and Johnny Hendricks.

4944
02:06:38,081 --> 02:06:38,590
Correct.

4945
02:06:38,590 --> 02:06:39,423
It's pretty tough.

4946
02:06:40,150 --> 02:06:41,690
But then whenever he finds the there,

4947
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:44,680
now whenever he fights
a Jitsu guys screwed.

4948
02:06:44,740 --> 02:06:46,390
It's his Achilles heel
because they take them down.

4949
02:06:46,410 --> 02:06:48,730
Merch umum his Jiu Jitsu is not that good.

4950
02:06:48,970 --> 02:06:50,020
His defense has just,

4951
02:06:50,021 --> 02:06:50,350
you know,

4952
02:06:50,350 --> 02:06:52,750
but when I say it's as
a kid is heal the only,

4953
02:06:52,770 --> 02:06:52,950
the,

4954
02:06:52,950 --> 02:06:54,940
the very tip of the spear of black belts,

4955
02:06:54,941 --> 02:06:55,750
fuck them up.

4956
02:06:55,750 --> 02:07:00,430
That's why I was so impressed with
a Dosantos dos Angeles smashed Neal.

4957
02:07:00,640 --> 02:07:01,810
He leg kicked him,

4958
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:05,110
dragged him to the ground and
choked the fuck out of Damien.

4959
02:07:05,111 --> 02:07:06,010
Maia did that.

4960
02:07:06,130 --> 02:07:08,620
That other homeboy got
a inverted triangle.

4961
02:07:08,621 --> 02:07:09,311
The Bald Guy,

4962
02:07:09,311 --> 02:07:10,120
I forget his name.

4963
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:13,120
Who is ridiculous at Jiu
Jitsu Brazilian bald guy.

4964
02:07:13,330 --> 02:07:17,920
Bald Brazilian advertise all Brazilian.

4965
02:07:17,921 --> 02:07:18,850
Tiago Alvarez.

4966
02:07:18,970 --> 02:07:19,330
No,

4967
02:07:19,330 --> 02:07:19,541
no,

4968
02:07:19,541 --> 02:07:20,374
no.

4969
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:22,140
Oh yeah,

4970
02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:23,510
that guy is really good.

4971
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:23,890
You put,

4972
02:07:23,890 --> 02:07:24,571
I guess I'll jump.

4973
02:07:24,571 --> 02:07:27,040
Mariah's are black and
then Damien Maia was like,

4974
02:07:27,041 --> 02:07:27,791
you do what?

4975
02:07:27,791 --> 02:07:28,624
And he's got a,

4976
02:07:28,820 --> 02:07:33,340
he a triangled someone from the mount
out years ago and I'll never fed BDO.

4977
02:07:33,940 --> 02:07:35,410
Forgot his name because that,

4978
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:36,100
yeah,

4979
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:36,970
he's a beast man.

4980
02:07:37,150 --> 02:07:38,230
He set it up beautifully.

4981
02:07:38,231 --> 02:07:40,240
He's got a crazy tricep too.

4982
02:07:40,241 --> 02:07:41,530
He's like missing a tricep.

4983
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:44,620
Like you look at one of his arms
like is tricep was nonexistent.

4984
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:47,260
It must've broke off and slid up for,

4985
02:07:47,410 --> 02:07:47,711
yeah,

4986
02:07:47,711 --> 02:07:50,890
it must a tour and they
never got a fruit roll up.

4987
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:51,281
Yeah,

4988
02:07:51,281 --> 02:07:53,410
he never got it fixed
cause he's got a a Bicep,

4989
02:07:53,411 --> 02:07:54,820
but then there's nothing behind it.

4990
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,620
It's very weird looking
at one of his arms.

4991
02:07:56,690 --> 02:07:56,930
He do.

4992
02:07:56,930 --> 02:07:58,000
If he's still fighting,

4993
02:07:58,001 --> 02:07:58,834
just got killed.

4994
02:07:59,490 --> 02:08:01,210
Somebody so many good.

4995
02:08:02,290 --> 02:08:03,280
Pull up a surgeon,

4996
02:08:03,281 --> 02:08:04,114
Mariah.

4997
02:08:06,410 --> 02:08:07,243
Hmm.

4998
02:08:08,430 --> 02:08:08,641
Yeah.

4999
02:08:08,641 --> 02:08:11,460
He was the first guy to
tap crone as a black belt.

5000
02:08:11,490 --> 02:08:15,430
It was like a wonder that Magni
and amount magni in the mouth.

5001
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:15,991
Yes,

5002
02:08:15,991 --> 02:08:18,360
he has left bought tricep
is like kind of missing.

5003
02:08:18,930 --> 02:08:20,640
It's even weirder when you see it.

5004
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:21,060
Uh,

5005
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:21,960
like hanging low.

5006
02:08:22,020 --> 02:08:22,853
You weird there.

5007
02:08:22,950 --> 02:08:23,611
Pull up his,

5008
02:08:23,611 --> 02:08:23,790
uh,

5009
02:08:23,790 --> 02:08:24,623
his record.

5010
02:08:24,710 --> 02:08:27,680
The shit he's going for
an arm triangle here.

5011
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:31,433
Immediately.

5012
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:32,100
Risk Cape.

5013
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:33,210
Oh Shit.

5014
02:08:33,310 --> 02:08:34,230
He's going to stand up.

5015
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:34,591
Let me see.

5016
02:08:34,591 --> 02:08:35,840
Is there we go.

5017
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:36,041
No,

5018
02:08:36,041 --> 02:08:36,121
no,

5019
02:08:36,121 --> 02:08:36,860
no.

5020
02:08:36,860 --> 02:08:37,540
It's just go.

5021
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:38,460
Go to his record though.

5022
02:08:39,110 --> 02:08:39,300
Yeah,

5023
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:40,133
that's right here.

5024
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:40,920
Where's it?

5025
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:41,753
Scroll down.

5026
02:08:42,660 --> 02:08:42,850
No,

5027
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:44,400
no fights.

5028
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:46,910
10 means [inaudible].

5029
02:08:47,130 --> 02:08:47,963
Oh yeah.

5030
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:49,190
It's only k.

5031
02:08:49,191 --> 02:08:50,490
Oh really?

5032
02:08:51,170 --> 02:08:51,550
Yeah.

5033
02:08:51,550 --> 02:08:51,910
Yeah.

5034
02:08:51,910 --> 02:08:53,220
This one has a lot of decisions,

5035
02:08:53,221 --> 02:08:53,750
man.

5036
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:54,583
Mm.

5037
02:08:56,290 --> 02:08:58,180
Super disappointed in that standup.

5038
02:08:58,450 --> 02:09:00,820
Matt Serra was going off about,

5039
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:02,320
angry about us,

5040
02:09:02,350 --> 02:09:03,700
the referee standing them,

5041
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:04,660
separating them.

5042
02:09:04,661 --> 02:09:07,180
When a Damien Maia had
his bag was ridiculous.

5043
02:09:07,181 --> 02:09:09,820
It was really a god who is the rough,

5044
02:09:10,330 --> 02:09:11,650
I want to say it was Leon Roberts,

5045
02:09:11,710 --> 02:09:12,340
wasn't it?

5046
02:09:12,340 --> 02:09:12,461
Yeah,

5047
02:09:12,461 --> 02:09:13,294
I think so.

5048
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:15,460
It was a terrible decisions.

5049
02:09:15,730 --> 02:09:17,830
They're getting too
crazy with the standups.

5050
02:09:18,510 --> 02:09:20,560
Too crazy with it that they need a,

5051
02:09:20,620 --> 02:09:21,730
they need to relax.

5052
02:09:21,970 --> 02:09:22,181
Well,

5053
02:09:22,181 --> 02:09:24,310
especially in that situation,

5054
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:27,880
you've got a guy who's a strangulation
expert that finally gets to clench on a

5055
02:09:27,881 --> 02:09:28,870
world class wrestler,

5056
02:09:28,871 --> 02:09:29,671
especially in those early,

5057
02:09:29,671 --> 02:09:30,430
in the first round,

5058
02:09:30,430 --> 02:09:31,211
early in the first round.

5059
02:09:31,211 --> 02:09:32,220
Got a real good position and I'm,

5060
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:34,990
and you also have to think,

5061
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:37,900
Maya took this fight with zero great camp.

5062
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:38,891
Oh Shit.

5063
02:09:38,891 --> 02:09:39,170
And He,

5064
02:09:39,170 --> 02:09:39,410
Neil,

5065
02:09:39,410 --> 02:09:40,243
Neil,

5066
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:40,810
Neil,

5067
02:09:40,810 --> 02:09:44,650
they should ask Neil
Neil's whooping his death.

5068
02:09:45,010 --> 02:09:45,670
He's hurt.

5069
02:09:45,670 --> 02:09:46,031
Come on.

5070
02:09:46,031 --> 02:09:47,290
You know we need them right in the face.

5071
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:47,441
Yeah,

5072
02:09:47,441 --> 02:09:47,680
you did.

5073
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:48,513
Because there's legal.

5074
02:09:48,620 --> 02:09:49,060
Yeah,

5075
02:09:49,060 --> 02:09:49,421
for sure.

5076
02:09:49,421 --> 02:09:50,254
Illegal.

5077
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:51,341
Oh,

5078
02:09:51,341 --> 02:09:51,640
he's,

5079
02:09:51,640 --> 02:09:51,791
oh,

5080
02:09:51,791 --> 02:09:52,350
he's out.

5081
02:09:52,350 --> 02:09:54,580
He's out types it and Neil
Neil Madras round baby.

5082
02:09:55,470 --> 02:09:56,080
Big winning.

5083
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:56,913
He'll magni.

5084
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:57,671
No.

5085
02:09:57,671 --> 02:10:01,330
Magni stopping motherfuckers
powerful back on Neil.

5086
02:10:01,990 --> 02:10:02,201
Yeah,

5087
02:10:02,201 --> 02:10:03,370
he's a long dude.

5088
02:10:03,371 --> 02:10:03,610
Huh?

5089
02:10:03,610 --> 02:10:05,680
That's about as long as it
gets for one seventh grade.

5090
02:10:05,681 --> 02:10:06,580
Cardio Long.

5091
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:07,931
Yeah.

5092
02:10:07,931 --> 02:10:09,490
And good fight Iq,

5093
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:09,940
you know,

5094
02:10:09,940 --> 02:10:12,610
like would never blows his wad.

5095
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:14,620
He's always in there like,

5096
02:10:14,621 --> 02:10:15,310
look at that.

5097
02:10:15,310 --> 02:10:17,710
Just finished the guys
barely breathing heavy.

5098
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:19,300
Be seriously man.

5099
02:10:19,301 --> 02:10:21,020
That dude is in fucking shape.

5100
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:22,100
He's always been that way,

5101
02:10:22,110 --> 02:10:22,720
man.

5102
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:24,460
Is that just a discipline thing?

5103
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:26,320
Just always trained military guy.

5104
02:10:26,350 --> 02:10:27,183
Yeah.

5105
02:10:27,730 --> 02:10:28,840
Also a Denver thing,

5106
02:10:28,841 --> 02:10:29,350
right?

5107
02:10:29,350 --> 02:10:29,471
Oh,

5108
02:10:29,471 --> 02:10:30,101
isn't that high?

5109
02:10:30,101 --> 02:10:32,900
I was in Chicago at the same
fucking cardio because I was,

5110
02:10:33,530 --> 02:10:36,820
I was one of the coaches on the ultimate
fighter 14 he came off that season.

5111
02:10:36,830 --> 02:10:37,401
Even then they're like,

5112
02:10:37,401 --> 02:10:37,581
dude,

5113
02:10:37,581 --> 02:10:39,010
look at the cardio on Neal.

5114
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:40,370
What does he do for Cardio?

5115
02:10:40,371 --> 02:10:41,240
You know him well,

5116
02:10:41,660 --> 02:10:43,120
but he just training nonstop,

5117
02:10:43,150 --> 02:10:46,750
but was like eight mark heart when he
first came in Denver and he just kept,

5118
02:10:46,850 --> 02:10:47,061
you know,

5119
02:10:47,061 --> 02:10:48,170
Nate train nonstop.

5120
02:10:48,171 --> 02:10:49,820
So he just kind of took on that role.

5121
02:10:50,210 --> 02:10:51,030
You just trained snakes?

5122
02:10:51,030 --> 02:10:51,863
Don retired.

5123
02:10:51,940 --> 02:10:52,520
Yes.

5124
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:52,980
It's done.

5125
02:10:52,980 --> 02:10:53,813
That's good.

5126
02:10:53,910 --> 02:10:55,190
Just doing the Lord's work now.

5127
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:56,113
Oh,

5128
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:57,410
what kind of work is that?

5129
02:10:58,020 --> 02:10:59,720
I do whatever the Lord wants him to do.

5130
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:01,040
It wasn't worth saying,

5131
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:03,440
I think a sell bibles.

5132
02:11:03,441 --> 02:11:04,400
I don't know what they do.

5133
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:06,800
So he's working for a church or something?

5134
02:11:06,801 --> 02:11:07,440
I think so.

5135
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:09,310
We just kept trying to become a
priest or something like that.

5136
02:11:11,270 --> 02:11:13,160
He was always super religious.

5137
02:11:13,670 --> 02:11:14,330
Always.

5138
02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:14,960
Yeah.

5139
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:15,771
I'm glad he's retired,

5140
02:11:15,771 --> 02:11:16,490
right guy.

5141

5161
02:11:48,510 --> 02:11:49,690
Joey Joey's,

5162
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:51,500
he called me a couple of times.

5163
02:11:51,501 --> 02:11:54,320
Should I answer the
phone and call him back?

5164
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:55,830
Listen.

02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:10,210
He's terrible about that job.

02:12:10,211 --> 02:12:11,110
What do you think happens?

5172
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:12,390

what do you think happened?

5174
02:12:14,140 --> 02:12:15,280
You think she's just eating all the time.

5175
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:16,133
Fuck the time.

5176
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:17,941

02:12:23,701 --> 02:12:24,534
Girl.

5183
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,260

5184
02:12:27,340 --> 02:12:28,550
It's a can't answer that phone.

5186
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:31,140
Hmm?

5187
02:12:31,140 --> 02:12:31,790

Yeah.

5189
02:12:31,950 --> 02:12:35,530
I'm surprised that's not there.

5190
02:12:36,050 --> 02:12:36,883
He's calling me.

Pill against Wonderboy and
my man against the other guy.

5226
02:14:28,250 --> 02:14:29,600

5227
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:30,761
Julie,

5228
02:14:30,761 --> 02:14:31,450

5229
02:14:31,450 --> 02:14:33,790
What time are you tapings on June 4th,

5230
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:37,920

5231
02:14:38,030 --> 02:14:38,581

5232
02:14:38,581 --> 02:14:38,881

5233

where are they filming at downtown,

5234
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:43,260
I think someplace they got.

5235
02:14:43,261 --> 02:14:44,250
It's a small place.

5236
02:14:44,251 --> 02:14:45,480
Joe was made for us.

5237
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:48,720
It's like a hundred seats
less than the original room.

5238
02:14:48,721 --> 02:14:49,554
Nice and tight.

5239
02:14:49,780 --> 02:14:50,430
Really.

5240
02:14:50,430 --> 02:14:51,120
It's like,

5241
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:52,050
it's like Providence,

5242
02:14:52,051 --> 02:14:52,561
Rhode Island.

5243
02:14:52,561 --> 02:14:54,130
When was the last time
you went to providence?

5244
02:14:54,190 --> 02:14:55,230
A couple years ago.

5245
02:14:56,070 --> 02:14:57,180
That comedy connection?

5246
02:14:57,510 --> 02:14:58,530
Fucking deadly.

5247
02:14:58,890 --> 02:15:03,890
It's deadly in that this is the
same type of layout to 50 to 40.

5248
02:15:04,670 --> 02:15:05,880
Are there tickets available?

5249
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:07,590
Uh,

5250
02:15:07,590 --> 02:15:08,820
there's no tickets available.

5251
02:15:08,821 --> 02:15:09,840
I mean there's something for you.

5252
02:15:09,841 --> 02:15:10,530
You know what I'm saying?

5253
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:11,300
Right.

5254
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:11,690
If you,

5255
02:15:11,690 --> 02:15:13,170
if you show up in the helicopter,

5256
02:15:13,171 --> 02:15:14,004
I can't deny it.

5257
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:17,400
Batmobile.

5258
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:18,040
I'll go down,

5259
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:18,873
show up.

5260
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:21,020
I would cop to than what you'll know days.

5261
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:21,873
You know what I'm saying?

5262
02:15:22,150 --> 02:15:25,690
You just walk in and take the fucking
mic and tell people what's time but

5263
02:15:26,140 --> 02:15:26,950
beautiful.

5264
02:15:26,950 --> 02:15:27,610
But that's it.

5265
02:15:27,610 --> 02:15:28,443
There's nothing available.

5266
02:15:28,490 --> 02:15:30,260
I can't wait for people
to see that special.

5267
02:15:30,261 --> 02:15:32,030
Joey's going to be fucking nuts.

5268
02:15:32,740 --> 02:15:33,491
I'm working hard.

5269
02:15:33,491 --> 02:15:35,050
I've never worked this hard in my life.

5270
02:15:35,051 --> 02:15:36,220
I didn't know the meaning of this.

5271
02:15:36,221 --> 02:15:40,240
And so I listen to you of the
tapings and the try and shit.

5272
02:15:40,630 --> 02:15:42,900
And now I'm just doing 28 minutes set.

5273
02:15:42,901 --> 02:15:44,140
So all week 28,

5274
02:15:44,141 --> 02:15:44,801
28,

5275
02:15:44,801 --> 02:15:45,550
28.

5276
02:15:45,550 --> 02:15:45,880
Oo,

5277
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:46,713
I gotta get the,

5278
02:15:46,930 --> 02:15:50,500
I got to get the beginning more jazzed
up because I got to make them watch.

5279
02:15:50,950 --> 02:15:53,110
So I got to go out there
like a fucking medial,

5280
02:15:53,140 --> 02:15:53,831
you understand me?

5281
02:15:53,831 --> 02:15:57,540
I got to go out there and hold them
until like 14 minutes and let them,

5282
02:15:57,580 --> 02:15:58,600
I got the strategy.

5283
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:03,560
I'm going to go out there and
fucking just go off for about 14.

5284
02:16:03,590 --> 02:16:06,840
Then we go to watch different
corners and then they come on.

5285
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:07,810
I pick my shots.

5286
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:11,440
I just picked my fucking
shots like when fucking,

5287
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:12,333
uh,

5288
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:13,180
Eddie's guys,

5289
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:13,391
what?

5290
02:16:13,391 --> 02:16:17,020
That dude and he fucking
the really good striker.

5291
02:16:17,021 --> 02:16:21,370
I got to pick my shots in the second round
and then the third round go out there

5292
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:26,410
and just fucking flip point combinations
ending with leg kicks the ted down than

5293
02:16:26,411 --> 02:16:28,030
the until you can't take it no more.

5294
02:16:28,031 --> 02:16:28,864
You know what I'm saying?

5295
02:16:29,190 --> 02:16:30,370
That's the strategy

5296
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:31,203
right there.

5297
02:16:31,220 --> 02:16:33,010
I'm breaking it down to three rounds.

5298
02:16:33,011 --> 02:16:33,844
Joe Rogan,

5299
02:16:34,030 --> 02:16:35,080
you did it last night.

5300
02:16:35,081 --> 02:16:36,310
Joey you did last night.

5301
02:16:36,311 --> 02:16:37,021
The Ice House.

5302
02:16:37,021 --> 02:16:37,301
He said,

5303
02:16:37,301 --> 02:16:37,900
I told Jay,

5304
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:39,730
I told rogue he set him on fire man.

5305
02:16:40,610 --> 02:16:40,941
Yeah,

5306
02:16:40,941 --> 02:16:41,211
no,

5307
02:16:41,211 --> 02:16:41,361
no,

5308
02:16:41,361 --> 02:16:41,541
no.

5309
02:16:41,541 --> 02:16:45,040
I broke it down to three rounds
and I'm cutting back adding,

5310
02:16:45,140 --> 02:16:45,801
you know what I'm saying?

5311
02:16:45,801 --> 02:16:46,281
I'm cutting.

5312
02:16:46,281 --> 02:16:48,080
I'm looking at it like an MMA fighter.

5313
02:16:48,710 --> 02:16:50,100
So I'm training for a fight.

5314
02:16:50,110 --> 02:16:55,030
So the first 11 minutes you guys fucked
and I got to jump on your criminal shit.

5315
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:56,280
Like old school retool it.

5316
02:16:56,281 --> 02:16:56,420
Yeah.

5317
02:16:56,420 --> 02:16:58,040
The whole fucking old school.

5318
02:16:58,041 --> 02:16:59,040
Old School veto.

5319
02:16:59,900 --> 02:17:02,270
The second round I'm just
picking my shots like,

5320
02:17:02,271 --> 02:17:03,610
like a guy,

5321
02:17:03,611 --> 02:17:06,440
I guess Edson Barboza he picked his shot.

5322
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:07,760
He picked him apart.

5323
02:17:08,060 --> 02:17:09,060
He kicked him in the side.

5324
02:17:09,070 --> 02:17:10,700
You fucked up the Siad to gloat.

5325
02:17:10,860 --> 02:17:12,550
She kicks off her body.

5326
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:20,190
I come out like fucking that black dude
in the 70s that's when they gave him the

5327
02:17:20,191 --> 02:17:21,480
bottle filled with cocaine.

5328
02:17:21,481 --> 02:17:22,314
Milk.

5329
02:17:25,130 --> 02:17:26,830
Drop some knowledge here.

5330
02:17:27,170 --> 02:17:27,560
Fuck.

5331
02:17:27,560 --> 02:17:30,210
Just don't know magic bottle.

5332
02:17:30,270 --> 02:17:30,900
That's right.

5333
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:33,510
Same one thing that brought up
for the fight against out though.

5334
02:17:34,780 --> 02:17:35,613
Right?

5335
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:40,230
That's the same one that gave
fucking Todd ever gets out though.

5336
02:17:41,550 --> 02:17:42,390
Don't tell me.

5337
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:44,790
I know the characteristics
of that fucking know.

5338
02:17:49,670 --> 02:17:54,540
You pick your dealing with in the third
round we come out like fucking all my

5339
02:17:54,580 --> 02:17:56,270
bride was that trainer's name.

5340
02:17:58,320 --> 02:17:59,170
Is that a manual?

5341
02:17:59,750 --> 02:18:00,650
I'm Joe Rogan.

5342
02:18:01,830 --> 02:18:03,080
We're watching it right now.

5343
02:18:03,081 --> 02:18:05,940
Jamie just put her Alexis Arguayo,

5344
02:18:05,960 --> 02:18:06,830
Alexis Aguayo,

5345
02:18:06,890 --> 02:18:07,760
Aaron Pryor,

5346
02:18:10,250 --> 02:18:11,150
Panama Lewis.

5347
02:18:11,260 --> 02:18:11,550
I don't know.

5348
02:18:11,550 --> 02:18:14,100
My one was getting the bottle
would be original shit.

5349
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:14,550
Yeah,

5350
02:18:14,550 --> 02:18:18,450
it should know reactor
was sending up and shit.

5351
02:18:18,590 --> 02:18:18,930
Yeah,

5352
02:18:18,930 --> 02:18:20,760
he gave me tell him some coconut water.

5353
02:18:20,761 --> 02:18:22,080
You rainbow looking back

5354
02:18:22,350 --> 02:18:26,640
and then Aaron Pryor came
out just throwing bombs and
fuck the Lexus Aguayo up.

5355
02:18:26,670 --> 02:18:28,500
That was a great fight man.

5356
02:18:29,310 --> 02:18:30,143
Right?

5357
02:18:30,210 --> 02:18:31,470
This is the way you gotta do it,

5358
02:18:32,550 --> 02:18:32,970
man.

5359
02:18:32,970 --> 02:18:34,110
Old School boxing.

5360
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:35,273
Aaron Pryor,

5361
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:36,360
the bottle.

5362
02:18:37,240 --> 02:18:39,380
So Bobby's like they get
called the bottle it.

5363
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:40,010
I said,

5364
02:18:40,010 --> 02:18:42,720
get on the bottle that I mixed
the capture that on video.

5365
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:43,680
It has a bottle.

5366
02:18:45,480 --> 02:18:46,140
He's like,

5367
02:18:46,140 --> 02:18:47,460
give him the bottle
that I'm most proud of.

5368
02:18:47,461 --> 02:18:49,650
It is smoke coming out of it.

5369
02:18:50,700 --> 02:18:52,560
I wonder what the fuck was in that thing.

5370
02:18:52,650 --> 02:18:53,483
Cocaine.

5371
02:18:54,420 --> 02:18:54,811
Damn.

5372
02:18:54,811 --> 02:18:56,490
He's doing work.

5373
02:18:56,550 --> 02:18:57,160
Look it up.

5374
02:18:57,160 --> 02:18:57,870
Where's know?

5375
02:18:57,870 --> 02:18:58,471
Get the other one.

5376
02:18:58,471 --> 02:18:59,340
The one that I'm mixed.

5377
02:18:59,820 --> 02:19:00,231
I look at it.

5378
02:19:00,231 --> 02:19:00,421
Okay.

5379
02:19:00,421 --> 02:19:01,254
There's a positive.

5380
02:19:01,400 --> 02:19:01,590
No,

5381
02:19:01,590 --> 02:19:01,691
no,

5382
02:19:01,691 --> 02:19:01,861
no,

5383
02:19:01,861 --> 02:19:02,640
not that one.

5384
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:03,473
Give me the other one.

5385
02:19:04,390 --> 02:19:04,940
Okay.

5386
02:19:04,940 --> 02:19:06,820
How fucking beautiful is that?

5387
02:19:06,860 --> 02:19:07,693
That's one bottle.

5388
02:19:07,790 --> 02:19:09,050
Got a sniff and shit.

5389
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:09,820
No,

5390
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:10,990
that they try to get more than,

5391
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:11,721
that was the one he goes.

5392
02:19:11,721 --> 02:19:12,430
Give me that one.

5393
02:19:12,430 --> 02:19:13,130
Yeah.

5394
02:19:13,130 --> 02:19:13,880
Bang.

5395
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:15,510
He got hurt before he got fucked up.

5396
02:19:15,520 --> 02:19:18,020
Alexis Aguayo had a nasty right hand man.

5397
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:20,860
He was watery.

5398
02:19:20,861 --> 02:19:21,840
His shit wrong.

5399
02:19:22,050 --> 02:19:23,610
So this is not the main event,

5400
02:19:23,611 --> 02:19:23,941
is it?

5401
02:19:23,941 --> 02:19:24,300
Yeah.

5402
02:19:24,300 --> 02:19:25,290
This is the main event.

5403
02:19:25,340 --> 02:19:26,190
Can we are all right,

5404
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:27,530
let's go right to,

5405
02:19:27,580 --> 02:19:28,413
to the fight

5406
02:19:28,540 --> 02:19:28,850
Joe.

5407
02:19:28,850 --> 02:19:31,580
And we're about to watch
[inaudible] we love you man.

5408
02:19:31,581 --> 02:19:31,971
Love you man.

5409
02:19:31,971 --> 02:19:32,241
Love you,

5410
02:19:32,241 --> 02:19:32,820
man.

5411
02:19:32,820 --> 02:19:33,920
I will see you this week,

5412
02:19:33,921 --> 02:19:34,301
brothers.

5413
02:19:34,301 --> 02:19:35,134
Thank you.

5414
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:37,930
Here's Dan till,

5415
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:39,620
who's better than him?

5416
02:19:39,770 --> 02:19:40,603
He's the best.

5417
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:41,510
He love that guy.

5418
02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:42,321
Oh,

5419
02:19:42,321 --> 02:19:44,040
then Joey saying till,

5420
02:19:44,090 --> 02:19:44,301
I'm like,

5421
02:19:44,301 --> 02:19:45,134
well,

5422
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:50,870
well it's kind of amazing that
he's even top 10 with one win over.

5423
02:19:50,871 --> 02:19:53,780
A big guy in Donald Cerrone
is really 155 pounder.

5424
02:19:53,810 --> 02:19:53,961
Yeah,

5425
02:19:53,961 --> 02:19:54,380
it's very,

5426
02:19:54,380 --> 02:19:54,611
it's,

5427
02:19:54,611 --> 02:19:56,840
it's insane that I'm picking
them to win the fight,

5428
02:19:57,560 --> 02:19:59,930
but I am not a fan of
how they do the ratings,

5429
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:00,530
I think.

5430
02:20:00,530 --> 02:20:02,960
Do you think it pm that's a Fox thing.

5431
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:04,520
So is he as being in a stick with it?

5432
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:05,241
I don't know.

5433
02:20:05,241 --> 02:20:07,250
Is it foxes decide decision?

5434
02:20:07,251 --> 02:20:07,611
That was,

5435
02:20:07,611 --> 02:20:09,050
that was one of Fox's deals.

5436
02:20:09,051 --> 02:20:11,720
They want rankings because they didn't
think the public could understand.

5437
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:12,201
You know,

5438
02:20:12,201 --> 02:20:17,201
who's who without the
rankings to arbitrary in the
two disagreed upon by high

5439
02:20:18,261 --> 02:20:19,000
level people,

5440
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:19,760
it will not,

5441
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:20,571
no matter how you do it,

5442
02:20:20,571 --> 02:20:21,530
you can never get it right.

5443
02:20:21,530 --> 02:20:23,240
So you might as well just
try it and just let it,

5444
02:20:23,241 --> 02:20:23,990
you know,

5445
02:20:23,990 --> 02:20:24,620
let it fly.

5446
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:25,520
You've got to have rank.

5447
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:27,660
This is the problem is fighters going,

5448
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:27,950
wait,

5449
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:28,430
he's,

5450
02:20:28,430 --> 02:20:29,300
he's six,

5451
02:20:29,301 --> 02:20:29,921
but I'm fine.

5452
02:20:29,921 --> 02:20:30,980
I'm not fighting six men.

5453
02:20:31,070 --> 02:20:33,400
I want if I were before it would,

5454
02:20:33,410 --> 02:20:34,460
we didn't know what Derek was.

5455
02:20:34,461 --> 02:20:34,790
Right.

5456
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:35,511
We didn't know what I'm going to do.

5457
02:20:35,511 --> 02:20:35,840
What is right.

5458
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:37,550
What pride did just make 'em fight.

5459
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:38,210
If you,

5460
02:20:38,210 --> 02:20:40,130
if you trying to fight,

5461
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:41,630
that will never ask you again.

5462
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:42,493
They try.

5463
02:20:42,980 --> 02:20:43,820
This is exciting,

5464
02:20:43,821 --> 02:20:44,031
man.

5465
02:20:44,031 --> 02:20:45,500
I'm fucking pumped for this fight.

5466
02:20:45,540 --> 02:20:46,610
They took long enough.

5467
02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:47,550
I feel like we've been in,

5468
02:20:47,720 --> 02:20:50,660
got those old school
tie tattoos on his back.

5469
02:20:50,810 --> 02:20:51,920
The kind of tap in.

5470
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:54,860
They do that with the fucking the tapper.

5471
02:20:55,150 --> 02:20:55,880
You ever seen house?

5472
02:20:55,880 --> 02:20:58,790
That's as old school toe
tappers temple tattoos.

5473
02:21:00,170 --> 02:21:01,670
Is that his girlfriend on his arm?

5474
02:21:02,510 --> 02:21:04,580
I think it's his older
girlfriend or his daughter at,

5475
02:21:04,581 --> 02:21:05,414
oh

5476
02:21:06,680 --> 02:21:07,900
now he probably got them Brazil.

5477
02:21:07,901 --> 02:21:09,320
They probably don't have
the best tattoo artists,

5478
02:21:09,321 --> 02:21:10,910
but remember he was
young when he got that.

5479
02:21:11,220 --> 02:21:12,053
Did the tattoo.

5480
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:13,063
Yeah.

5481
02:21:13,070 --> 02:21:16,730
It looks like Charlise there you think
there's a guy out there with a tattoo of

5482
02:21:16,731 --> 02:21:17,041
a chick?

5483
02:21:17,041 --> 02:21:18,980
There's like a one night
stand like one crazy.

5484
02:21:19,010 --> 02:21:22,070
Nicole was the hottest chick ever.

5485
02:21:22,071 --> 02:21:25,020
It's probably a million guys
with the one night stand.

5486
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,360
She sucked Dick Everything.

5487
02:21:27,370 --> 02:21:27,570
I mean,

5488
02:21:27,570 --> 02:21:28,403
instead of

5489
02:21:30,380 --> 02:21:31,490
putting her on my back,

5490
02:21:31,640 --> 02:21:32,473
respect.

5491
02:21:32,500 --> 02:21:33,560
Preach back girl,

5492
02:21:34,050 --> 02:21:35,600
his girlfriend is his girlfriend.

5493
02:21:35,650 --> 02:21:36,080
Here we go.

5494
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:36,830
Okay.

5495
02:21:36,830 --> 02:21:37,251
So,

5496
02:21:37,251 --> 02:21:38,084
um,

5497
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:39,380
that's a commitment right there,

5498
02:21:39,381 --> 02:21:39,740
right?

5499
02:21:39,740 --> 02:21:41,150
Mary heard you're into that one.

5500
02:21:41,990 --> 02:21:43,610
That's how scared dudes our marriage.

5501
02:21:43,611 --> 02:21:43,910
Look,

5502
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:45,830
I'll tattoo you on my arm.

5503
02:21:46,900 --> 02:21:47,840
Getting married.

5504
02:21:50,230 --> 02:21:51,590
Marriage is too prominent.

5505
02:21:52,030 --> 02:21:53,030
It's too dangerous.

5506
02:21:56,110 --> 02:21:57,710
So many people scared of that marriage,

5507
02:21:57,711 --> 02:21:58,420
buddy.

5508
02:21:58,420 --> 02:21:59,253
Here he goes,

5509
02:22:00,230 --> 02:22:00,591
Darren,

5510
02:22:00,591 --> 02:22:01,900
till the sun.

5511
02:22:01,901 --> 02:22:02,571
I crowd,

5512
02:22:02,571 --> 02:22:02,751
man.

5513
02:22:02,751 --> 02:22:03,201
It's too bad.

5514
02:22:03,201 --> 02:22:04,550
Liverpool last yesterday.

5515
02:22:04,610 --> 02:22:06,830
Otherwise this place be
fucking even on more fire.

5516
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:09,313
Oh goodness.

5517
02:22:09,350 --> 02:22:10,610
Big Moment for this kid.

5518
02:22:10,670 --> 02:22:11,503
Big Moment.

5519
02:22:12,230 --> 02:22:13,810
We're going to find out a lot of on hands,

5520
02:22:13,830 --> 02:22:14,270
man.

5521
02:22:14,270 --> 02:22:14,781
He's big.

5522
02:22:14,781 --> 02:22:16,040
But suppose one deployment.

5523
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:17,510
Wonderboy is a tall fella.

5524
02:22:17,511 --> 02:22:18,550
He's an inch tall.

5525
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:19,890
Wonder was not as media is he?

5526
02:22:19,970 --> 02:22:20,211
No,

5527
02:22:20,211 --> 02:22:21,044
he's not.

5528
02:22:21,290 --> 02:22:21,531
Wonder.

5529
02:22:21,531 --> 02:22:22,590
Boy's name is Wonderboy.

5530
02:22:22,620 --> 02:22:23,930
His is the gorilla.

5531
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:24,853
Yeah,

5532
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:26,070
but who named Wonderboy?

5533
02:22:26,071 --> 02:22:26,820
Wonderboy.

5534
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:27,720
And who named the grill?

5535
02:22:27,721 --> 02:22:28,260
The gorilla.

5536
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:28,591
See,

5537
02:22:28,591 --> 02:22:29,340
that's it.

5538
02:22:29,340 --> 02:22:30,360
That's what's important.

5539
02:22:30,361 --> 02:22:30,910
That's what's up.

5540
02:22:30,910 --> 02:22:31,550
Yeah.

5541
02:22:31,550 --> 02:22:32,220
To find that out.

5542
02:22:32,220 --> 02:22:34,830
What if you called
yourself people be like,

5543
02:22:34,831 --> 02:22:37,560
get off to a terrible guy yourself.

5544
02:22:37,561 --> 02:22:38,211
Big Brown.

5545
02:22:38,211 --> 02:22:39,044
It's weird.

5546
02:22:39,510 --> 02:22:39,820
Wait,

5547
02:22:39,820 --> 02:22:40,653
what's your name man?

5548
02:22:40,830 --> 02:22:41,940
Hell Toda Nado

5549
02:22:43,500 --> 02:22:43,780
well,

5550
02:22:43,780 --> 02:22:45,240
sitting around thinking about nicknames.

5551
02:22:46,440 --> 02:22:47,273
Fuck Outta here.

5552
02:22:48,350 --> 02:22:50,940
Says that our Dan Hardee gave
him the nickname of the gorilla.

5553
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:51,331
Oh,

5554
02:22:51,331 --> 02:22:51,960
there you go.

5555
02:22:51,960 --> 02:22:52,760
That makes sense.

5556
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:54,230
How long ago did he says,

5557
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:54,631
well,

5558
02:22:54,631 --> 02:22:59,390
this says he officially accepted
it as of January 20th so man,

5559
02:23:00,390 --> 02:23:01,223
real recent.

5560
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:02,181
Fuck,

5561
02:23:02,181 --> 02:23:03,540
what was his name before then?

5562
02:23:03,810 --> 02:23:03,991
Well,

5563
02:23:03,991 --> 02:23:04,824
I didn't know.

5564
02:23:05,010 --> 02:23:05,811
I didn't know Dan hard.

5565
02:23:05,811 --> 02:23:06,321
Is it gone?

5566
02:23:06,321 --> 02:23:10,200
I just like refer to him as the gorilla
and then three days ago he wrote with

5567
02:23:10,201 --> 02:23:10,321
it.

5568
02:23:10,321 --> 02:23:12,030
I thought this was his
name for a while now.

5569
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:13,021
Well,

5570
02:23:13,021 --> 02:23:13,831
it's January.

5571
02:23:13,831 --> 02:23:14,850
We're into May.

5572
02:23:15,270 --> 02:23:17,200
So it's technically ma.

5573
02:23:17,310 --> 02:23:18,690
I mean after he beat.

5574
02:23:18,750 --> 02:23:19,140
But what,

5575
02:23:19,140 --> 02:23:21,510
how long does a man have
to keep a nickname before?

5576
02:23:21,511 --> 02:23:23,790
It's a legitimate bro.

5577
02:23:24,500 --> 02:23:25,960
It's on spoken rule.

5578
02:23:25,970 --> 02:23:27,120
They could decide kick.

5579
02:23:27,150 --> 02:23:28,020
I don't have a nickname.

5580
02:23:29,790 --> 02:23:30,510
You want me to notice?

5581
02:23:30,510 --> 02:23:30,981
I get it.

5582
02:23:30,981 --> 02:23:31,170
Yeah,

5583
02:23:31,170 --> 02:23:32,003
I'm the side.

5584
02:23:32,970 --> 02:23:33,803
I'm a wing man.

5585
02:23:33,810 --> 02:23:34,021
No,

5586
02:23:34,021 --> 02:23:34,854
but

5587
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:37,350
we,

5588
02:23:37,350 --> 02:23:37,581
we,

5589
02:23:37,581 --> 02:23:39,430
we lost a martial arts to ruin us.

5590
02:23:39,430 --> 02:23:40,560
Like the sidekick.

5591
02:23:40,650 --> 02:23:43,820
No girl wants to fuck
the sidekick Robbins.

5592
02:23:45,390 --> 02:23:47,340
If you know the real
meaning to the dentist,

5593
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:51,480
the dentist also sinking
his dick sucked in the bar.

5594
02:23:51,560 --> 02:23:51,771
See,

5595
02:23:51,771 --> 02:23:53,520
the dentist is such an obscure nickname.

5596
02:23:53,521 --> 02:23:55,920
I think he got to leave Josh neer alone.

5597
02:23:55,980 --> 02:23:57,000
That's his nickname.

5598
02:23:57,090 --> 02:23:58,680
That's so obscure one,

5599
02:23:59,040 --> 02:23:59,873
you know,

5600
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:04,200
but then they call Eve Edwards a
dentist at one point in time because eve

5601
02:24:04,201 --> 02:24:05,750
Edwards cause of Erin's iron,

5602
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:06,060
right?

5603
02:24:06,060 --> 02:24:06,691
Yes,

5604
02:24:06,691 --> 02:24:07,524
yes.

5605
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:08,740
He destroyed it.

5606
02:24:09,990 --> 02:24:11,010
Broke his whole best.

5607
02:24:11,011 --> 02:24:11,550
Right.

5608
02:24:11,550 --> 02:24:13,740
Like I'm and Riley was one of those tough,

5609
02:24:13,741 --> 02:24:15,030
tough journeyman.

5610
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:15,923
Yeah.

5611
02:24:16,130 --> 02:24:16,510
Tom,

5612
02:24:16,510 --> 02:24:16,921
he went,

5613
02:24:16,921 --> 02:24:20,640
Robby Lauer made his UFC debut against
Aaron Riley and just beat the brakes off

5614
02:24:20,641 --> 02:24:21,474
of them.

5615
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:25,440
That's another super impressive
performance by half old dos Anjos right to

5616
02:24:25,441 --> 02:24:28,470
Robbie Lawler fight like holy shit.

5617
02:24:28,510 --> 02:24:29,343
It

5618
02:24:30,360 --> 02:24:31,830
was an amazing fighter.

5619
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:32,693
Amazing.

5620
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:36,570
He's like one of the best examples of a
guy was holding himself back by staying

5621
02:24:36,571 --> 02:24:37,650
in a lower weight class.

5622
02:24:38,820 --> 02:24:40,020
He did get the belt though.

5623
02:24:40,230 --> 02:24:40,801
Yes he did,

5624
02:24:40,801 --> 02:24:41,970
but he couldn't take it anymore.

5625
02:24:41,971 --> 02:24:43,200
His body couldn't take it anymore.

5626
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:44,400
He was so big.

5627
02:24:44,670 --> 02:24:48,990
I ran into him in between fights when he
was fighting 55 and he was 200 pounds.

5628
02:24:49,410 --> 02:24:50,211
It's just too much.

5629
02:24:50,211 --> 02:24:51,840
When they start declining a little bit,

5630
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:53,100
cause the weight cut was fucking with him.

5631
02:24:53,101 --> 02:24:54,930
Then he went to 70 now
he's said nightmare.

5632
02:24:55,710 --> 02:24:56,340
Here we go.

5633
02:24:56,340 --> 02:24:57,150
Wonderboy,

5634
02:24:57,150 --> 02:24:58,610
how tall is Dosantos?

5635
02:24:59,130 --> 02:25:00,180
He's short for us.

5636
02:25:00,210 --> 02:25:00,991
One 70 year,

5637
02:25:00,991 --> 02:25:01,290
right?

5638
02:25:01,290 --> 02:25:02,830
I think he's five nine shorter.

5639
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:03,100
You know?

5640
02:25:03,100 --> 02:25:04,110
See if you can find that Jamie.

5641
02:25:04,710 --> 02:25:06,090
I think he might even be five eight.

5642
02:25:06,510 --> 02:25:06,751
Yeah,

5643
02:25:06,751 --> 02:25:07,110
that's,

5644
02:25:07,110 --> 02:25:08,550
that's kind of short.

5645
02:25:12,550 --> 02:25:15,310
Kelvin's probably like
five ten five dollars

5646
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:21,090
but Tyrons five nine
to write five nine no,

5647
02:25:21,091 --> 02:25:24,520
he's got five ten five
11 way Woodley Woodley.

5648
02:25:25,780 --> 02:25:26,620
I think he's five nine.

5649
02:25:27,340 --> 02:25:28,600
That's what's so impressive.

5650
02:25:28,690 --> 02:25:33,490
I think Woodley's five 11 five nine it
says no one's got a bigger butt donk,

5651
02:25:33,491 --> 02:25:34,324
donk than Woodley.

5652
02:25:34,570 --> 02:25:35,730
When he walks into LPS,

5653
02:25:35,910 --> 02:25:36,630
fuck it.

5654
02:25:36,630 --> 02:25:37,361
Thighs on.

5655
02:25:37,361 --> 02:25:38,800
That guy is an ass.

5656
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:40,720
He generates so much for us.

5657
02:25:41,890 --> 02:25:42,191
You know,

5658
02:25:42,191 --> 02:25:42,561
I'm,

5659
02:25:42,561 --> 02:25:43,600
I'm five nine now.

5660
02:25:43,630 --> 02:25:44,463
I'm like,

5661
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:46,490
fuck yeah,

5662
02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:48,950
that's a medical student.

5663
02:25:48,970 --> 02:25:49,791
They say fucking hide.

5664
02:25:49,791 --> 02:25:51,430
It's a five nine motherfucker.

5665
02:25:52,210 --> 02:25:53,043
You know what I mean?

5666
02:25:53,410 --> 02:25:54,520
How was the back feeling?

5667
02:25:56,040 --> 02:25:56,590
It,

5668
02:25:56,590 --> 02:25:59,290
it's hard to tell because I haven't been
able to train because of my knee and my

5669
02:25:59,291 --> 02:25:59,771
shoulder.

5670
02:25:59,771 --> 02:26:01,240
So when I get back,

5671
02:26:01,241 --> 02:26:01,391
you know,

5672
02:26:01,391 --> 02:26:02,230
my knee's feeling better,

5673
02:26:02,231 --> 02:26:04,540
I'm on the bike 30 minutes a day.

5674
02:26:04,541 --> 02:26:05,320
So,

5675
02:26:05,320 --> 02:26:05,940
um,

5676
02:26:05,940 --> 02:26:06,910
so I decided,

5677
02:26:06,940 --> 02:26:07,773
I decided,

5678
02:26:07,900 --> 02:26:10,740
I decided to hold off on the
shoulder surgery and decided,

5679
02:26:10,750 --> 02:26:11,050
yeah,

5680
02:26:11,050 --> 02:26:12,070
I think they want to do to you.

5681
02:26:13,150 --> 02:26:13,630
What can I do?

5682
02:26:13,630 --> 02:26:14,920
I've got to shit you got wrong in there.

5683
02:26:16,060 --> 02:26:20,140
The labor them rotator cuff and,

5684
02:26:20,141 --> 02:26:20,681
but they're saying,

5685
02:26:20,681 --> 02:26:20,980
you know,

5686
02:26:20,980 --> 02:26:21,581
I finally,

5687
02:26:21,581 --> 02:26:24,340
I got a second opinion yesterday and um,

5688
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:25,390
they told me,

5689
02:26:25,390 --> 02:26:25,750
man,

5690
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:28,180
unless it's hurting really bad,

5691
02:26:28,810 --> 02:26:31,810
just hold off on it and hold off on it.

5692
02:26:31,811 --> 02:26:32,644
Why?

5693
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:35,381
It's just,

5694
02:26:35,381 --> 02:26:36,214
um,

5695
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:39,130
I don't want to go into surgery again man.

5696
02:26:39,131 --> 02:26:40,210
Just again,

5697
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:43,270
I just had knee surgery and
then shoulder surgery surgery.

5698
02:26:43,271 --> 02:26:44,380
I'm just trying to rehab it with,

5699
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:46,030
I'm going to try to rehab it with,

5700
02:26:46,090 --> 02:26:46,300
uh,

5701
02:26:46,300 --> 02:26:46,960
you know,

5702
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:48,670
like shoulder rehab exercises.

5703
02:26:48,671 --> 02:26:52,330
I'm going to go that route first and
if that doesn't work then I'll have

5704
02:26:52,331 --> 02:26:52,721
surgery.

5705
02:26:52,721 --> 02:26:55,990
But I decided I'm not going to
have surgery on my shoulder.

5706
02:26:56,020 --> 02:26:58,180
They're doing some crazy
shit down in Panama.

5707
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:00,770
Panama is $25,000 though.

5708
02:27:00,810 --> 02:27:01,450
It's expensive.

5709
02:27:01,450 --> 02:27:03,960
And you know when Mel
Gibson was on your podcast,

5710
02:27:06,040 --> 02:27:06,873
it,

5711
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:07,833
I don't know man,

5712
02:27:08,410 --> 02:27:10,060
I'd have it.

5713
02:27:10,300 --> 02:27:12,250
Is there a possibility that he was like,

5714
02:27:12,550 --> 02:27:12,941
you know,

5715
02:27:12,941 --> 02:27:16,330
he has some financial interest
in the company or something?

5716
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:16,781
I don't know.

5717
02:27:16,781 --> 02:27:17,441
It was hard to tell.

5718
02:27:17,441 --> 02:27:20,020
He really wanted to do it
for doctor reared and he's
good friends with that guy.

5719
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:20,690
Did he help it?

5720
02:27:20,690 --> 02:27:23,800
So I want to believe all that Shit's real.

5721
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:24,670
I want to.

5722
02:27:24,670 --> 02:27:25,780
But every time there's,

5723
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:26,260
there's,

5724
02:27:26,260 --> 02:27:27,280
you hear about stem cells,

5725
02:27:27,281 --> 02:27:30,790
there's a new way and they do it different
and now they're taking stem cells

5726
02:27:30,791 --> 02:27:32,050
from here instead of there.

5727
02:27:32,830 --> 02:27:34,020
Figured that shit out further.

5728
02:27:34,540 --> 02:27:35,373
They're all good.

5729
02:27:36,910 --> 02:27:37,631
They're all good,

5730
02:27:37,631 --> 02:27:38,680
but they keep getting better at it.

5731
02:27:38,681 --> 02:27:42,030
But talk to Tj because Tj had
some raving things to say,

5732
02:27:42,070 --> 02:27:44,500
but it'll show twice.

5733
02:27:45,050 --> 02:27:47,920
Actor after the Mel Gibson podcast.

5734
02:27:48,070 --> 02:27:48,880
Oh really?

5735
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:51,970
And after he was there before
and then he went again,

5736
02:27:52,270 --> 02:27:53,081
he went again recently.

5737
02:27:53,081 --> 02:27:53,351
He said,

5738
02:27:53,351 --> 02:27:54,670
it's why do we have to go again?

5739
02:27:54,850 --> 02:27:55,460
The five star?

5740
02:27:55,460 --> 02:27:56,293
We go,

5741
02:27:56,530 --> 02:27:56,891
Ooh,

5742
02:27:56,891 --> 02:27:57,431
I'm scared.

5743
02:27:57,431 --> 02:27:58,264
Someone's gonna be some.

5744
02:27:58,570 --> 02:27:58,721
Yeah,

5745
02:27:58,721 --> 02:27:59,531
I hope that's real,

5746
02:27:59,531 --> 02:27:59,711
man.

5747
02:27:59,711 --> 02:28:01,180
They just tap gloves
and hugged each other.

5748
02:28:01,210 --> 02:28:01,840
Holy Shit.

5749
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:03,220
There's a lot of respect.

5750
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:04,353
This is the shirts.

5751
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:05,591
I know.

5752
02:28:05,591 --> 02:28:07,030
I have no idea what's going to happen.

5753
02:28:07,110 --> 02:28:09,540
Isn't really have no idea
what's going to have no one,

5754
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:10,593
no idea.

5755
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:11,980
Literally no idea.

5756
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:14,110
I'm kind of nervous.

5757
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:15,460
Here we go.

5758
02:28:15,460 --> 02:28:16,293
Here we go.

5759
02:28:16,740 --> 02:28:17,573
Bam.

5760
02:28:18,140 --> 02:28:19,630
What a boy's gonna have to be smart.

5761
02:28:19,631 --> 02:28:22,010
A lot of footwear to south
paws and other big point.

5762
02:28:23,240 --> 02:28:23,900
Here we go.

5763
02:28:23,900 --> 02:28:24,890
Get the size of tils.

5764
02:28:24,891 --> 02:28:25,910
Fucking thighs.

5765
02:28:28,430 --> 02:28:28,671
Boy.

5766
02:28:28,671 --> 02:28:29,481
Their styles.

5767
02:28:29,481 --> 02:28:30,500
Look at their styles.

5768
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:32,720
Both real loose,

5769
02:28:32,721 --> 02:28:36,590
but more and more Thai base with till
he's going to throw front leg round kicks.

5770
02:28:36,830 --> 02:28:38,230
That thing about wonder boys,

5771
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:39,650
he's all light on the toes.

5772
02:28:39,651 --> 02:28:41,390
His trigger is insane

5773
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:44,900
leg kick right away by till.

5774
02:28:46,340 --> 02:28:47,270
Very interesting.

5775
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:50,060
I'm so curious about this fight.

5776
02:28:50,061 --> 02:28:52,010
She that video tool put
out of him sparring.

5777
02:28:52,011 --> 02:28:53,330
Just beating the shit out some day.

5778
02:28:54,050 --> 02:28:54,621
Yeah,

5779
02:28:54,621 --> 02:28:55,221
it was weird,

5780
02:28:55,221 --> 02:28:55,520
right?

5781
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:55,700
Yeah.

5782
02:28:55,700 --> 02:28:56,533
Very strange.

5783
02:28:56,910 --> 02:28:58,430
I had her heard that good,

5784
02:28:58,431 --> 02:28:59,430
but he knocked them out.

5785
02:28:59,450 --> 02:28:59,900
Yeah.

5786
02:28:59,900 --> 02:29:00,740
Hurting him too.

5787
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:02,480
I wouldn't post that if I was him.

5788
02:29:02,690 --> 02:29:03,111
Yeah.

5789
02:29:03,111 --> 02:29:03,830
And then,

5790
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:04,161
you know,

5791
02:29:04,161 --> 02:29:07,100
he posted some of him getting hit too
after that because he said people are

5792
02:29:07,101 --> 02:29:10,490
calling him a bully that I don't like
because that means he's reading the

5793
02:29:10,491 --> 02:29:13,280
comments and then he's
reacting to those comments,

5794
02:29:13,430 --> 02:29:15,080
which means people can fuck with this guy.

5795
02:29:15,080 --> 02:29:16,180
If you're a young fighter,

5796
02:29:16,190 --> 02:29:16,490
to me,

5797
02:29:16,490 --> 02:29:17,900
tough men to navigate through.

5798
02:29:18,100 --> 02:29:19,070
Well those comments,

5799
02:29:19,071 --> 02:29:22,520
you got to leave them alone because
there's so many you're dealing with,

5800
02:29:22,521 --> 02:29:22,880
uh,

5801
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:23,810
you know,

5802
02:29:23,870 --> 02:29:28,870
a pool of thousands and thousands of
people and who knows who they are or what

5803
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:29,820
their,

5804
02:29:29,820 --> 02:29:30,740
those Pete yet.

5805
02:29:30,741 --> 02:29:33,800
But also a lot of those people
aren't happy for your success.

5806
02:29:34,150 --> 02:29:34,670
Ms. Brown,

5807
02:29:34,670 --> 02:29:35,101
their life.

5808
02:29:35,101 --> 02:29:35,960
So they come at you.

5809
02:29:36,170 --> 02:29:36,531
Of course,

5810
02:29:36,531 --> 02:29:38,180
especially a guy like Tim is on the rise,

5811
02:29:38,181 --> 02:29:38,720
you know,

5812
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:42,470
or anyone in the spotlight tries
that switch kick off the front leg.

5813
02:29:42,980 --> 02:29:45,620
UFC might want to hire someone to
help these younger guys with that.

5814
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:46,101
Well.

5815
02:29:46,101 --> 02:29:49,910
Just give him a little psychological
counseling on how to handle it and get a

5816
02:29:49,911 --> 02:29:53,000
social media expert in their tils are
going to close the distance and land that

5817
02:29:53,001 --> 02:29:54,080
left hand over the top.

5818
02:29:54,081 --> 02:29:55,160
Wonderboy is not there though.

5819
02:29:55,340 --> 02:29:55,940
Yeah.

5820
02:29:55,940 --> 02:29:56,751
One voice footwork.

5821
02:29:56,751 --> 02:29:58,490
It's fricking ridiculous.

5822
02:29:58,730 --> 02:29:58,881
Well,

5823
02:29:58,881 --> 02:30:02,300
this is the perfect kind of style ram
to and aggressive guy coming forward.

5824
02:30:02,510 --> 02:30:03,660
This is what he's used to.

5825
02:30:04,050 --> 02:30:05,540
I have to imagine.

5826
02:30:05,541 --> 02:30:07,490
That's why I took the
fight to stylistically.

5827
02:30:07,590 --> 02:30:07,911
It was like,

5828
02:30:07,911 --> 02:30:08,090
yeah,

5829
02:30:08,090 --> 02:30:08,900
big guy,

5830
02:30:08,900 --> 02:30:09,471
aggressive.

5831
02:30:09,471 --> 02:30:11,410
Let's do it right after the fight.

5832
02:30:11,430 --> 02:30:11,810
Yeah.

5833
02:30:11,810 --> 02:30:12,643
Yeah.

5834
02:30:12,770 --> 02:30:13,490
Even though remarried,

5835
02:30:13,490 --> 02:30:16,760
just be Mazda doll who he's see
wonder why he shouldn't be there.

5836
02:30:16,910 --> 02:30:17,300
Right.

5837
02:30:17,300 --> 02:30:18,260
He better get the fuck out of there.

5838
02:30:18,261 --> 02:30:19,130
Don't stay there.

5839
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:19,971
Yeah.

5840
02:30:19,971 --> 02:30:20,940
He loves that leg kick,

5841
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:23,270
but he's a little off balance
and he didn't recuperate.

5842
02:30:23,420 --> 02:30:23,721
Well,

5843
02:30:23,721 --> 02:30:27,920
Darren made a shift as he was going to
launch that leg kick and you put them in

5844
02:30:27,921 --> 02:30:31,340
a weird position where he was off balance.

5845
02:30:32,330 --> 02:30:35,150
I mean there's some good adjustments
going on here at both guys trying to find

5846
02:30:35,151 --> 02:30:35,620
the right day.

5847
02:30:35,620 --> 02:30:35,850
What?

5848
02:30:35,850 --> 02:30:36,770
Oh Shit.

5849
02:30:36,860 --> 02:30:38,290
God till likes the fire one.

5850
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:38,580
Aleks.

5851
02:30:38,580 --> 02:30:42,770
That slide with the right hand forward
and then look off to the left hop.

5852
02:30:42,810 --> 02:30:43,643
You good?

5853
02:30:43,700 --> 02:30:45,080
Oh Shit.

5854
02:30:45,110 --> 02:30:45,380
One,

5855
02:30:45,380 --> 02:30:46,670
two quick.

5856
02:30:46,671 --> 02:30:46,890
One,

5857
02:30:46,890 --> 02:30:47,050
two.

5858
02:30:47,050 --> 02:30:47,481
Wonderboy.

5859
02:30:47,481 --> 02:30:48,920
Letting them know it's still there.

5860
02:30:48,921 --> 02:30:49,880
Boy has that a finished.

5861
02:30:49,881 --> 02:30:50,421
It's still there.

5862
02:30:50,421 --> 02:30:51,020
It looks tilt.

5863
02:30:51,020 --> 02:30:53,570
Tells a little hesitant
now wait a little bit.

5864
02:30:53,571 --> 02:30:55,940
Now be careful like a cobra man.

5865
02:30:56,460 --> 02:30:57,290
Be careful.

5866
02:30:57,290 --> 02:30:57,800
Oh,

5867
02:30:57,800 --> 02:31:01,970
you're talking about dude who was
like 57 and o was a kickboxer.

5868
02:31:02,540 --> 02:31:05,540
Good wonder by agreement as
far as high level striking.

5869
02:31:05,570 --> 02:31:09,020
I can't remember the last time two
strikers are matched up this well no.

5870
02:31:09,021 --> 02:31:11,280
And this is five round
son who I'll take it.

5871
02:31:11,730 --> 02:31:13,340
Oh yeah.

5872
02:31:13,341 --> 02:31:14,840
Who knows what's going to
happen and that's fine.

5873
02:31:15,870 --> 02:31:16,760
This is interesting.

5874
02:31:17,630 --> 02:31:18,230
So,

5875
02:31:18,230 --> 02:31:19,630
so there's a high level.

5876
02:31:19,631 --> 02:31:20,070
I was just trying

5877
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:21,540
to figure it out with the left hand.

5878
02:31:21,570 --> 02:31:23,520
Popped him with the left hand
is caught him at the end of it.

5879
02:31:23,670 --> 02:31:25,140
Not a lot of power but reached him.

5880
02:31:26,900 --> 02:31:29,020
He's letting until know
that he's down there.

5881
02:31:29,300 --> 02:31:29,840
Yup.

5882
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:30,673
Snap.

5883
02:31:30,860 --> 02:31:32,450
He's also switching legs,

5884
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:32,961
switches,

5885
02:31:32,961 --> 02:31:33,470
dances.

5886
02:31:33,470 --> 02:31:34,520
Now he's all sideways.

5887
02:31:34,780 --> 02:31:37,720
It's hard to find a trading partner
who's going to emulate Wonderboy.

5888
02:31:37,730 --> 02:31:38,420
Man.

5889
02:31:38,420 --> 02:31:39,710
You don't really get a real look at.

5890
02:31:40,010 --> 02:31:41,750
Ou want you to buy it.

5891
02:31:43,710 --> 02:31:44,790
He's picking his shots,

5892
02:31:44,791 --> 02:31:47,560
but I think he's trying to
frustrate till so till jumps in.

5893
02:31:47,561 --> 02:31:47,990
Makes a mistake.

5894
02:31:47,990 --> 02:31:48,823
Oh,

5895
02:31:50,250 --> 02:31:51,083
looked for it.

5896
02:31:51,970 --> 02:31:52,910
I don't think that landed though.

5897
02:31:52,911 --> 02:31:53,190
Huh?

5898
02:31:53,190 --> 02:31:53,880
No,

5899
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:54,713
look cool though.

5900
02:31:54,900 --> 02:31:55,733
And I was on board.

5901
02:31:57,060 --> 02:31:57,893
I yelled out.

5902
02:31:58,790 --> 02:32:00,060
You got to get off the cage chair.

5903
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:01,110
He got to get out.

5904
02:32:03,790 --> 02:32:04,151
Yeah.

5905
02:32:04,151 --> 02:32:05,650
I think for one of where
these first two rounds,

5906
02:32:05,651 --> 02:32:07,030
just try to frustrate till

5907
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:10,680
what time is it in England right now?

5908
02:32:10,890 --> 02:32:13,760
There's seven hours ahead or they ate,

5909
02:32:14,280 --> 02:32:17,180
so it's fucking eight
o'clock it's really late.

5910
02:32:17,310 --> 02:32:21,330
[inaudible] eight o'clock
eight 30 at night or they see,

5911
02:32:21,331 --> 02:32:21,571
I see.

5912
02:32:21,571 --> 02:32:22,590
I think it's seven 30

5913
02:32:24,150 --> 02:32:24,990
it's eight hours.

5914
02:32:25,590 --> 02:32:26,040
That's it.

5915
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:26,640
Trust me.

5916
02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:26,821
Yeah.

5917
02:32:26,821 --> 02:32:27,654
You probably know.

5918
02:32:28,590 --> 02:32:30,270
So it's 9:30 PM right now.

5919
02:32:30,990 --> 02:32:31,830
Eight 30 bro.

5920
02:32:32,250 --> 02:32:33,083
What time is it now?

5921
02:32:33,380 --> 02:32:38,380
1230 [inaudible] unless there's a couple
of different times zones and the UK.

5922
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:40,050
I thought it was just one.

5923
02:32:40,250 --> 02:32:41,630
I have daylight savings time or so.

5924
02:32:42,490 --> 02:32:43,323
Yeah.

5925
02:32:43,420 --> 02:32:46,270
Nobody should have that shit dead.

5926
02:32:46,390 --> 02:32:47,560
Arizona does it right?

5927
02:32:47,590 --> 02:32:48,160
They do.

5928
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:49,040
They like fine.

5929
02:32:49,100 --> 02:32:49,810
Fuck with it.

5930
02:32:49,810 --> 02:32:51,040
And that our sleep we lose.

5931
02:32:51,041 --> 02:32:51,620
Got Real.

5932
02:32:51,620 --> 02:32:53,500
Fuck yourself should be a two year old,

5933
02:32:54,340 --> 02:32:55,820
but how about when you gain that out?

5934
02:32:55,850 --> 02:32:56,210
Oh,

5935
02:32:56,210 --> 02:32:57,970
it's nice when you gain
it for like two days.

5936
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:58,571
Not worth it,

5937
02:32:58,571 --> 02:32:58,930
bro.

5938
02:32:58,930 --> 02:32:59,763
It's not worth it.

5939
02:33:00,090 --> 02:33:01,450
Fuck my test in the morning.

5940
02:33:01,451 --> 02:33:03,460
It's dark in the afternoon.

5941
02:33:03,461 --> 02:33:05,890
It's not your boys too.

5942
02:33:06,900 --> 02:33:07,120
Yeah,

5943
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:07,953
he's two now.

5944
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:09,190
Mike six.

5945
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:13,210
He's all into Harry Potter and Shit now.

5946
02:33:13,540 --> 02:33:13,820
That's cool.

5947
02:33:13,820 --> 02:33:14,291
Damn,

5948
02:33:14,291 --> 02:33:14,800
we got it.

5949
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:16,420
We go to universal studios.

5950
02:33:16,421 --> 02:33:17,600
How awkward if you haven't been you,

5951
02:33:17,700 --> 02:33:19,270
you haven't been a universal studios.

5952
02:33:20,110 --> 02:33:21,850
You need to go universal studios.

5953
02:33:21,851 --> 02:33:25,230
Fucking brules now the
three d simulations.

5954
02:33:25,231 --> 02:33:25,750
Hell yeah.

5955
02:33:25,750 --> 02:33:28,420
High level that that Harry Potter ride.

5956
02:33:28,780 --> 02:33:30,240
Holy Father,

5957
02:33:30,570 --> 02:33:31,840
the new guards or galaxy.

5958
02:33:31,841 --> 02:33:32,050
It.

5959
02:33:32,050 --> 02:33:32,980
Disney's pretty sick.

5960
02:33:33,370 --> 02:33:34,570
I was straight up scared.

5961
02:33:35,500 --> 02:33:36,333
I was scared.

5962
02:33:36,520 --> 02:33:38,590
That transformer ride is amazing.

5963
02:33:38,780 --> 02:33:40,190
Also in the Simpsons.

5964
02:33:40,380 --> 02:33:42,400
Amazing land is sick.

5965
02:33:42,450 --> 02:33:43,283
Yeah.

5966
02:33:43,340 --> 02:33:43,980
Springfield,

5967
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:44,813
their rides every,

5968
02:33:45,730 --> 02:33:47,410
you know what's the best ride ever?

5969
02:33:47,530 --> 02:33:48,190
All time.

5970
02:33:48,190 --> 02:33:49,023
Hands down.

5971
02:33:49,540 --> 02:33:50,680
Flights of passage.

5972
02:33:50,740 --> 02:33:53,590
Avatar ride in Disney world in Orlando.

5973
02:33:54,800 --> 02:33:55,570
Simulation.

5974
02:33:55,570 --> 02:33:57,100
It's incredible,

5975
02:33:57,101 --> 02:33:57,490
dude.

5976
02:33:57,490 --> 02:33:58,323
It's incredible.

5977
02:33:58,540 --> 02:33:59,710
It's like virtual reality.

5978
02:33:59,711 --> 02:34:00,191
You go in,

5979
02:34:00,191 --> 02:34:01,120
you sit on this bike,

5980
02:34:01,121 --> 02:34:02,290
you're riding a dragon.

5981
02:34:02,470 --> 02:34:03,200
You saw Avatar,

5982
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:03,740
right?

5983
02:34:03,740 --> 02:34:05,820
You're riding one of those
things through the fucking junk.

5984
02:34:07,810 --> 02:34:09,400
It is every is think of like,

5985
02:34:09,610 --> 02:34:10,443
have you ever done that?

5986
02:34:10,510 --> 02:34:14,470
That there's the thing at Disney
land called soaring over the world.

5987
02:34:14,700 --> 02:34:15,040
Will you?

5988
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:16,000
It's amazing.

5989
02:34:16,001 --> 02:34:16,960
Giant screen.

5990
02:34:17,050 --> 02:34:18,220
You're flying like

5991
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:20,410
over India and over the Everest.

5992
02:34:20,411 --> 02:34:22,020
It's a made sure that
it's not Disney world.

5993
02:34:22,070 --> 02:34:22,510
They don't.

5994
02:34:22,510 --> 02:34:22,700
No,

5995
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:23,300
just did it.

5996
02:34:23,300 --> 02:34:25,180
Just did it sister.

5997
02:34:25,210 --> 02:34:25,420
Yeah.

5998
02:34:25,420 --> 02:34:26,253
Disney world.

5999
02:34:26,350 --> 02:34:28,570
Disney land has soaring over the world.

6000
02:34:28,900 --> 02:34:29,260
Oh,

6001
02:34:29,260 --> 02:34:29,951
but oh,

6002
02:34:29,951 --> 02:34:30,311
here we go.

6003
02:34:30,311 --> 02:34:31,144
Round to fuck

6004
02:34:33,100 --> 02:34:33,750
around.

6005
02:34:33,750 --> 02:34:34,583
I'll remember.

6006
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:35,913
Oh,

6007
02:34:36,150 --> 02:34:37,390
he'll get a little more aggressive.

6008
02:34:37,810 --> 02:34:39,040
Tagged him with that left hand.

6009
02:34:39,880 --> 02:34:41,010
And that castle that,

6010
02:34:41,011 --> 02:34:42,820
that Harry Potter Castle that they build.

6011
02:34:42,821 --> 02:34:43,920
Like what the fuck?

6012
02:34:43,970 --> 02:34:44,711
That's amazing.

6013
02:34:44,711 --> 02:34:45,580
Now it's incredible.

6014
02:34:45,640 --> 02:34:46,960
Tills getting way more amped up.

6015
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:48,070
Oh Shit.

6016
02:34:48,410 --> 02:34:49,780
The one mistake,

6017
02:34:49,781 --> 02:34:50,081
man.

6018
02:34:50,081 --> 02:34:50,301
I know.

6019
02:34:50,301 --> 02:34:50,610
I wonder,

6020
02:34:50,610 --> 02:34:50,831
boy.

6021
02:34:50,831 --> 02:34:52,210
Such a good counter fighter.

6022
02:34:52,350 --> 02:34:52,840
Oh,

6023
02:34:52,840 --> 02:34:53,760
he lifts where I'd done.

6024
02:34:55,240 --> 02:34:55,630
Ooh.

6025
02:34:55,630 --> 02:34:57,160
Gotta get off the fucking fence.

6026
02:34:58,300 --> 02:34:59,320
That's all till once.

6027
02:35:02,450 --> 02:35:04,850
So that first round you got
to give it to one or more,

6028
02:35:04,851 --> 02:35:05,680
right?

6029
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:05,920
I mean,

6030
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:06,561
super close,

6031
02:35:06,561 --> 02:35:07,394
but yeah.

6032
02:35:07,550 --> 02:35:07,731
Yeah.

6033
02:35:07,731 --> 02:35:08,440
Give it to Wonderboy.

6034
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:08,540
Yeah.

6035
02:35:08,540 --> 02:35:09,131
You have to wonder,

6036
02:35:09,131 --> 02:35:09,860
boy,

6037
02:35:09,860 --> 02:35:11,140
not a whole lot going on most.

6038
02:35:11,141 --> 02:35:12,830
I mean he landed like maybe two shots,

6039
02:35:12,831 --> 02:35:15,740
one of the body than that
one to remember this though.

6040
02:35:15,741 --> 02:35:16,790
They're in Liverpool,

6041
02:35:17,060 --> 02:35:17,630
the home kit,

6042
02:35:17,630 --> 02:35:21,380
he's the hometown kid and the
judges look at a octagon control,

6043
02:35:21,510 --> 02:35:23,830
so it's not necessarily
could give to wonder.

6044
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:24,150
Boom,

6045
02:35:24,150 --> 02:35:27,590
that that frontline Darren until
I don't think landed anything,

6046
02:35:27,620 --> 02:35:30,470
but he's going forward
and the judges are morons,

6047
02:35:30,500 --> 02:35:30,891
so like,

6048
02:35:30,891 --> 02:35:31,131
oh,

6049
02:35:31,131 --> 02:35:31,851
going forward.

6050
02:35:31,851 --> 02:35:32,900
That works well.

6051
02:35:32,930 --> 02:35:34,910
Give it to till he did a good job.

6052
02:35:34,911 --> 02:35:38,360
Didn't t they always ask a
question after they say something.

6053
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:40,401
He's amazing.

6054
02:35:40,401 --> 02:35:41,234
Isn't he

6055
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:43,431
fantastic?

6056
02:35:43,431 --> 02:35:44,360
Righthand wasn't it

6057
02:35:48,250 --> 02:35:50,020
the sites route to get
loose in the third round?

6058
02:35:50,021 --> 02:35:51,370
I feel like what's getting loose?

6059
02:35:51,380 --> 02:35:53,230
Heredi a little bit.

6060
02:35:53,260 --> 02:35:55,180
It's just such a dangerous chess game.

6061
02:35:55,270 --> 02:35:55,930
I know.

6062
02:35:55,930 --> 02:35:57,160
And Wonderboy hands,

6063
02:35:57,161 --> 02:35:58,900
motherfucking down side.

6064
02:35:58,960 --> 02:35:59,810
He's always like that.

6065
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:00,581
It's like that.

6066
02:36:00,581 --> 02:36:02,080
That's that karate style sign.

6067
02:36:03,860 --> 02:36:04,160
Ooh,

6068
02:36:04,160 --> 02:36:05,810
look for it till slid,

6069
02:36:05,870 --> 02:36:07,240
slid to the right heel tills.

6070
02:36:07,250 --> 02:36:08,540
Elbows are no joke either.

6071
02:36:08,541 --> 02:36:09,740
Now if he gets in close,

6072
02:36:09,741 --> 02:36:11,630
they're the one that he landed on cowboy.

6073
02:36:11,631 --> 02:36:12,800
It was God.

6074
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:14,300
Who else has he beaten?

6075
02:36:14,830 --> 02:36:15,411
It's about it,

6076
02:36:15,411 --> 02:36:15,860
sir.

6077
02:36:15,860 --> 02:36:16,071
Yeah,

6078
02:36:16,071 --> 02:36:16,600
I'm really,

6079
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:16,940
uh,

6080
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:18,430
in anybody else.

6081
02:36:18,510 --> 02:36:19,343
He hasn't really,

6082
02:36:19,940 --> 02:36:22,580
he hasn't really knocked you off
your socks before that cowboy fight.

6083
02:36:22,630 --> 02:36:24,110
He's had some decisions.

6084
02:36:24,500 --> 02:36:25,280
They did.

6085
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:26,030
He knock out.

6086
02:36:26,030 --> 02:36:28,970
You stopped somebody to know
yet early on he had one stop.

6087
02:36:28,971 --> 02:36:29,140
It's,

6088
02:36:29,140 --> 02:36:29,750
Oh shit.

6089
02:36:29,750 --> 02:36:30,583
Ooh.

6090
02:36:30,950 --> 02:36:31,850
Damn one the bar.

6091
02:36:31,851 --> 02:36:32,540
We left Wonderboy.

6092
02:36:32,540 --> 02:36:32,830
Tom.

6093
02:36:32,830 --> 02:36:33,860
A very smart man.

6094
02:36:33,980 --> 02:36:34,813
Yeah.

6095
02:36:36,020 --> 02:36:36,710
Well this is like,

6096
02:36:36,710 --> 02:36:37,400
again,

6097
02:36:37,400 --> 02:36:42,400
stylistically such a great fight because
this is the style that Wonderboy really

6098
02:36:42,561 --> 02:36:42,861
does.

6099
02:36:42,861 --> 02:36:47,720
Like he likes a guy that's Uber aggressive
and when it turns in terms of like

6100
02:36:47,750 --> 02:36:49,490
high level technique bolt,

6101
02:36:49,491 --> 02:36:50,720
these guys are really good.

6102
02:36:50,870 --> 02:36:51,171
Really,

6103
02:36:51,171 --> 02:36:52,004
really good.

6104
02:36:52,610 --> 02:36:55,100
Don't till till keeps on that front
leg side kick to the frontline.

6105
02:36:55,130 --> 02:37:00,130
Oh no wonder that a
little short Hixon yeah.

6106
02:37:00,470 --> 02:37:01,070
He doesn't like,

6107
02:37:01,070 --> 02:37:03,260
no wonder he's going to
have to adapt to that.

6108
02:37:03,770 --> 02:37:04,603
Yeah,

6109
02:37:04,760 --> 02:37:05,930
they both switch it up,

6110
02:37:05,931 --> 02:37:06,680
don't they?

6111
02:37:06,680 --> 02:37:07,310
Yup.

6112
02:37:07,310 --> 02:37:08,840
Oh ooh.

6113
02:37:08,841 --> 02:37:10,760
Just missed that head kick son.

6114
02:37:11,480 --> 02:37:12,230
But uh,

6115
02:37:12,230 --> 02:37:13,760
miss financial is as good as a mile.

6116
02:37:16,150 --> 02:37:17,740
Tills got great distance control.

6117
02:37:17,770 --> 02:37:18,580
They both do.

6118
02:37:18,580 --> 02:37:19,413
They both do.

6119
02:37:20,140 --> 02:37:20,680
They both do.

6120
02:37:20,680 --> 02:37:22,000
Don't they don't.

6121
02:37:22,001 --> 02:37:22,541
They don't.

6122
02:37:22,541 --> 02:37:22,810
They?

6123
02:37:22,810 --> 02:37:23,441
That's Irish,

6124
02:37:23,441 --> 02:37:23,980
isn't it?

6125
02:37:23,980 --> 02:37:24,611
I don't know.

6126
02:37:24,611 --> 02:37:25,960
My accent suck.

6127
02:37:27,010 --> 02:37:28,540
We need a high natto in here.

6128
02:37:29,050 --> 02:37:30,520
I have some scouts for us.

6129
02:37:31,540 --> 02:37:32,390
Amazing kids.

6130
02:37:32,391 --> 02:37:34,420
Definitely a different accent to,

6131
02:37:34,421 --> 02:37:35,650
it's the thick man.

6132
02:37:35,980 --> 02:37:36,490
Yeah.

6133
02:37:36,490 --> 02:37:37,210
Sunderland,

6134
02:37:37,210 --> 02:37:40,600
Liverpool thick as Liverpool
I think is Ozzy Osborne.

6135
02:37:42,490 --> 02:37:43,000
Oh,

6136
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:43,900
Russian in man.

6137
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:45,310
Why did the boy loves to do that?

6138
02:37:45,311 --> 02:37:46,500
Like switch blitz.

6139
02:37:46,501 --> 02:37:47,080
Blitz.

6140
02:37:47,080 --> 02:37:47,913
Yeah,

6141
02:37:48,820 --> 02:37:49,151
but it's,

6142
02:37:49,151 --> 02:37:49,861
it's so,

6143
02:37:49,861 --> 02:37:53,430
it's so hard to figure out what the fuck
he's going to do because he switched

6144
02:37:53,431 --> 02:37:54,320
his stance as well.

6145
02:37:54,321 --> 02:37:56,380
He does it sometimes and
then we'll throw a kick.

6146
02:37:56,500 --> 02:37:57,220
Yeah,

6147
02:37:57,220 --> 02:37:58,570
he's about to rush in again.

6148
02:37:59,140 --> 02:38:02,140
Tills just trying to figure out and
pin him down but it's not there.

6149
02:38:02,320 --> 02:38:03,600
I wonder how this is.

6150
02:38:04,460 --> 02:38:07,930
This is one of the boys game plan
man Kimmy commit and make a mistake.

6151
02:38:07,931 --> 02:38:11,260
Then she capitalized but tills doing a
good job of not giving them much space

6152
02:38:11,290 --> 02:38:12,190
where the cages,

6153
02:38:12,220 --> 02:38:14,980
this is not happening in the center
of the cage as much as it's Ha.

6154
02:38:15,010 --> 02:38:17,180
Oh wonderful.

6155
02:38:17,250 --> 02:38:21,370
I try that sweater chills going to feel
any pressure get a finish cause till is

6156
02:38:21,371 --> 02:38:23,440
absolutely controlling
the center of the cage.

6157
02:38:23,500 --> 02:38:24,910
They under boy does not have a lot.

6158
02:38:24,911 --> 02:38:26,310
Well now they're in the center and you,

6159
02:38:26,311 --> 02:38:28,570
you know that wins
rounds for these judges.

6160
02:38:28,690 --> 02:38:29,523
Yeah.

6161
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:33,020
Cause they don't understand fighting

6162
02:38:36,970 --> 02:38:38,710
that place is packed too man.

6163
02:38:38,800 --> 02:38:38,951
Oh,

6164
02:38:38,951 --> 02:38:40,450
I'm sure they say you know,

6165
02:38:40,451 --> 02:38:42,290
he's a superstar superstar

6166
02:38:44,370 --> 02:38:46,940
and be the face of uh,

6167
02:38:47,020 --> 02:38:47,853
England man.

6168
02:38:49,320 --> 02:38:50,320
Big Knock out here.

6169
02:38:50,321 --> 02:38:52,210
It'd be the fee cause Bisbing he is,

6170
02:38:52,270 --> 02:38:53,470
but if he's retired,

6171
02:38:54,250 --> 02:38:54,401
yeah.

6172
02:38:54,401 --> 02:38:55,630
Who else is coming up in England?

6173
02:38:56,770 --> 02:38:57,431
Uh,

6174
02:38:57,431 --> 02:38:58,320
we got uh,

6175
02:38:58,370 --> 02:38:59,290
micro van and page,

6176
02:38:59,291 --> 02:39:00,124
right?

6177
02:39:00,160 --> 02:39:00,971
Sure.

6178
02:39:00,971 --> 02:39:01,390
Yeah,

6179
02:39:01,390 --> 02:39:02,110
but he's not,

6180
02:39:02,110 --> 02:39:03,190
he's not in this level.

6181
02:39:04,060 --> 02:39:06,280
Well why don't they give
him high level fights?

6182
02:39:06,310 --> 02:39:07,720
He just had fought a Rickles.

6183
02:39:08,090 --> 02:39:09,250
Do you see what he did to him?

6184
02:39:09,310 --> 02:39:09,670
No.

6185
02:39:09,670 --> 02:39:10,390
Fucked him up.

6186
02:39:10,390 --> 02:39:13,000
I heard he explode his
face and choked them out.

6187
02:39:13,150 --> 02:39:13,360
Yeah.

6188
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:14,200
And that was like his first,

6189
02:39:14,201 --> 02:39:15,910
like they weren't feeding him,

6190
02:39:15,911 --> 02:39:16,151
you know,

6191
02:39:16,151 --> 02:39:17,200
like that was a tough fight.

6192
02:39:18,670 --> 02:39:19,750
Mike van page daily.

6193
02:39:19,751 --> 02:39:21,270
Next they say and,

6194
02:39:21,780 --> 02:39:23,980
and Roy MacDonald Musashi.

6195
02:39:24,010 --> 02:39:24,550
Ooh.

6196
02:39:24,550 --> 02:39:26,050
Those are two very good fights.

6197
02:39:26,290 --> 02:39:26,841
I really,

6198
02:39:26,841 --> 02:39:27,280
me,

6199
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:29,650
I really like page daily cause
they don't like each other.

6200
02:39:29,680 --> 02:39:30,850
They fucking hate each other.

6201
02:39:30,851 --> 02:39:31,660
I liked that fight.

6202
02:39:31,660 --> 02:39:32,493
I'll watch.

6203
02:39:32,620 --> 02:39:34,990
Shout out to all the 10
plan of schools in the UK.

6204
02:39:35,140 --> 02:39:36,820
We got like a eight now.

6205
02:39:36,870 --> 02:39:38,230
Damn crazy lung.

6206

10 30 lunch.

6207
02:39:38,911 --> 02:39:39,744

02:39:40,330 --> 02:39:43,390
How many cranberry Redditch Darlington.

6209
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:44,840
Uh,

6210
02:39:44,950 --> 02:39:45,341
Shit.

6211
02:39:45,341 --> 02:39:46,180
Am I missing one?

6212
02:39:46,270 --> 02:39:46,451
Oh,

6213
02:39:46,451 --> 02:39:47,284
glass gal.

6214
02:39:47,290 --> 02:39:48,400
That's Scotland.

6215
02:39:48,550 --> 02:39:49,383
Scotland.

6216
02:39:49,540 --> 02:39:50,560
How many got worldwide?

6217
02:39:51,460 --> 02:39:52,293
About a hundred.

6218
02:39:52,390 --> 02:39:53,223
That's amazing.

6219
02:39:53,580 --> 02:39:54,071
It's crazy.

6220
02:39:54,071 --> 02:39:54,620
Amazing.

6221
02:39:54,620 --> 02:39:55,453
Ooh.

6222
02:39:56,530 --> 02:39:57,370
And it keeps growing,

6223
02:39:57,371 --> 02:39:57,870
man.

6224
02:39:57,870 --> 02:39:58,550
It keeps growing.

6225
02:39:58,550 --> 02:40:00,830
Know he hit him with
that psychic and a niece.

6226
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:01,900
See wonder boys leg.

6227
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:03,610
Bucko she's out in the replay.

6228
02:40:03,940 --> 02:40:04,810
He didn't like that.

6229
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:05,920
He hit him with three straight.

6230
02:40:06,990 --> 02:40:08,410
One of them really made his knee buckle.

6231
02:40:08,420 --> 02:40:08,770
Ma'Am.

6232
02:40:08,770 --> 02:40:10,450
Those things fucking so here it is.

6233
02:40:11,020 --> 02:40:13,650
Michael Van and Paige highlights.

6234
02:40:15,810 --> 02:40:16,643
We'll kick them.

6235
02:40:17,830 --> 02:40:18,663
Oh Shit.

6236
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:20,713
Damn.

6237
02:40:21,690 --> 02:40:22,800
He's so fast.

6238
02:40:23,090 --> 02:40:24,420
That's again karate.

6239
02:40:24,421 --> 02:40:26,160
He comes from that point
fighting background.

6240
02:40:26,330 --> 02:40:26,560
You know,

6241
02:40:26,560 --> 02:40:28,440
there's a great karate
match that I watched.

6242
02:40:28,441 --> 02:40:29,040
I mean,

6243
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:30,240
I don't know how many times they fought,

6244
02:40:30,241 --> 02:40:31,290
but on,

6245
02:40:31,291 --> 02:40:32,124
um,

6246
02:40:32,220 --> 02:40:32,550
uh,

6247
02:40:32,550 --> 02:40:34,950
they fought point fighting
way back in the day.

6248
02:40:35,010 --> 02:40:35,843
Um,

6249
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:39,660
Raymond Daniels and Michael then and page
fought each other and point fighting.

6250
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:40,261
Now,

6251
02:40:40,261 --> 02:40:44,190
Raymond Daniels is the glory champion
and Michael Van and Paige is coming up in

6252
02:40:44,200 --> 02:40:45,033
Beltour.

6253
02:40:45,390 --> 02:40:46,223
Very interesting.

6254
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:46,901
Oh,

6255
02:40:46,901 --> 02:40:48,180
he's a belt or champion now.

6256
02:40:48,360 --> 02:40:48,991
Raymond Daniels.

6257
02:40:48,991 --> 02:40:49,470
Right.

6258
02:40:49,470 --> 02:40:50,303
He left glory.

6259
02:40:51,090 --> 02:40:52,610
[inaudible].

6260
02:40:53,260 --> 02:40:54,093
Here we go.

6261
02:40:56,350 --> 02:40:57,190
Here we go.

6262
02:41:03,490 --> 02:41:04,323
Here we go.

6263
02:41:08,480 --> 02:41:10,100
Darren till super aggressive here.

6264
02:41:10,101 --> 02:41:12,580
Now I wonder if a Wonderboy,

6265
02:41:12,590 --> 02:41:13,610
his knee is okay

6266
02:41:16,530 --> 02:41:17,101
because those,

6267
02:41:17,101 --> 02:41:17,934
uh,

6268
02:41:18,060 --> 02:41:21,300
he still hasn't landed anything now
except for those sidekicks to the knee.

6269
02:41:21,780 --> 02:41:22,321
Here's the land.

6270
02:41:22,321 --> 02:41:23,100
Anything to the head.

6271
02:41:23,100 --> 02:41:23,610
Nothing.

6272
02:41:23,610 --> 02:41:23,930
Wonderboy,

6273
02:41:23,930 --> 02:41:24,960
his knee seems fine.

6274
02:41:24,961 --> 02:41:27,750
He's moving fine tooth around so far.

6275
02:41:27,751 --> 02:41:29,370
No shot to the head.

6276
02:41:29,460 --> 02:41:30,293
Yeah.

6277
02:41:30,360 --> 02:41:30,870
Ooh,

6278
02:41:30,870 --> 02:41:31,703
kick to the body.

6279
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:38,670
Well,

6280
02:41:38,670 --> 02:41:40,950
the whole thing with Wonderboy is just,

6281
02:41:41,550 --> 02:41:46,350
you make a mistake and he counters you
and so far till hasn't really made any

6282
02:41:46,351 --> 02:41:48,510
mistakes but wonder boys
found a few openings,

6283
02:41:48,660 --> 02:41:53,030
but there's never been like one big bum
rush where he'd left a gap and Wonderboy

6284
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:54,150
could drop a ball on him.

6285
02:41:56,580 --> 02:41:57,600
Did I miss anything?

6286
02:41:57,660 --> 02:41:57,961
Nope.

6287
02:41:57,961 --> 02:41:58,650
Nothing.

6288
02:41:58,650 --> 02:42:00,000
But they did show the replay.

6289
02:42:00,160 --> 02:42:01,880
The knee buckling a Wonderboy.

6290
02:42:01,900 --> 02:42:02,641
It look pretty now.

6291
02:42:02,641 --> 02:42:02,911
Yeah.

6292
02:42:02,911 --> 02:42:03,744
From what?

6293
02:42:03,750 --> 02:42:04,770
From that sidekick.

6294
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:05,753
Oh Wow.

6295
02:42:05,850 --> 02:42:06,571
From a side kick.

6296
02:42:06,571 --> 02:42:07,590
Front leg side kick to me.

6297
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:08,790
But he's moving fine.

6298
02:42:08,820 --> 02:42:12,990
It doesn't seem like he's a limping at
all and he threw some kicks with that

6299
02:42:12,991 --> 02:42:13,824
left leg.

6300
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:15,520
So you would be nice at one one.

6301
02:42:16,830 --> 02:42:17,461
It's hard to tell.

6302
02:42:17,461 --> 02:42:17,701
It's hard.

6303
02:42:17,701 --> 02:42:20,520
It would be nice if Wonderboy was
a little more aggressive though.

6304
02:42:20,580 --> 02:42:20,941
Yeah,

6305
02:42:20,941 --> 02:42:22,320
I wouldn't be getting knocked out.

6306
02:42:22,700 --> 02:42:24,350
K locked out you think so.

6307
02:42:24,360 --> 02:42:26,740
Same thing with the Woodley five
who was like go be more Christlike,

6308
02:42:26,741 --> 02:42:29,010
like and get fucking starched by Woodley.

6309
02:42:29,560 --> 02:42:31,230
That doesn't fighter.

6310
02:42:31,280 --> 02:42:32,113
He's a tower.

6311
02:42:32,140 --> 02:42:32,973
It's still,

6312
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:33,953
you've got to,

6313
02:42:34,200 --> 02:42:35,430
well this is his style,

6314
02:42:35,431 --> 02:42:35,611
man.

6315
02:42:35,611 --> 02:42:36,660
This is his style.

6316
02:42:36,990 --> 02:42:38,250
His style is move around,

6317
02:42:38,251 --> 02:42:43,251
but the thing is till is so high level
as well that it's hard for this style to

6318
02:42:43,351 --> 02:42:45,060
even find its home.

6319
02:42:45,090 --> 02:42:45,480
You know,

6320
02:42:45,480 --> 02:42:46,261
you have an aggressive,

6321
02:42:46,261 --> 02:42:47,550
which counter striker this is,

6322
02:42:47,551 --> 02:42:48,590
I don't know what people expect.

6323
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:48,901
Really.

6324
02:42:48,901 --> 02:42:49,734
Machida.

6325
02:42:49,830 --> 02:42:50,663
Yeah.

6326
02:42:51,780 --> 02:42:52,261
How about that?

6327
02:42:52,261 --> 02:42:55,230
My cheat at front kick
to vittores Cheetah.

6328
02:42:55,231 --> 02:42:56,690
How fucking dare you know.

6329
02:42:56,730 --> 02:42:57,150
Ooh,

6330
02:42:57,150 --> 02:42:58,460
the man's sign off fighting went,

6331
02:42:58,470 --> 02:42:59,303
you know what?

6332
02:42:59,580 --> 02:43:00,630
Enjoy the retirement.

6333
02:43:00,740 --> 02:43:01,690
Hey Josh.

6334
02:43:01,790 --> 02:43:02,190
Yeah,

6335
02:43:02,190 --> 02:43:02,701
crazy,

6336
02:43:02,701 --> 02:43:03,150
right?

6337
02:43:03,150 --> 02:43:06,360
That was one of the worst knockouts
effort and this just walks off fucking

6338
02:43:06,361 --> 02:43:06,860
nasty.

6339
02:43:06,860 --> 02:43:07,693
Starts praying.

6340
02:43:07,930 --> 02:43:10,900
Did you see the photo
of the foot on the face?

6341
02:43:10,970 --> 02:43:11,590
Yes.

6342
02:43:11,590 --> 02:43:15,160
Text book front kick balls
of the balls of the feet.

6343
02:43:15,280 --> 02:43:16,520
You think feature goes to ride?

6344
02:43:16,660 --> 02:43:18,940
Just juices with every
Brazilian drug ever?

6345
02:43:19,150 --> 02:43:19,241
Uh,

6346
02:43:19,241 --> 02:43:19,570
my,

6347
02:43:19,570 --> 02:43:21,070
my heart hope so too.

6348
02:43:21,071 --> 02:43:22,000
I pray for that at night.

6349
02:43:22,210 --> 02:43:23,380
I pray for Golden.

6350
02:43:23,440 --> 02:43:25,210
Like the master's division.

6351
02:43:25,270 --> 02:43:25,511
Yeah.

6352
02:43:25,511 --> 02:43:28,020
Just go off and want to see
veins in his teeth again.

6353
02:43:28,300 --> 02:43:30,040
It's crazy that he's still fighting.

6354
02:43:30,250 --> 02:43:33,230
Jesus Christ did.

6355
02:43:33,250 --> 02:43:34,930
He was around in the early days.

6356
02:43:35,370 --> 02:43:37,510
He's the only guy from
the early day still fight.

6357
02:43:37,511 --> 02:43:38,580
Oh yeah.

6358
02:43:39,340 --> 02:43:40,300
Caught them with that right hand,

6359
02:43:40,301 --> 02:43:40,391
man.

6360
02:43:40,391 --> 02:43:42,040
You could say the same
thing for Dan Henderson,

6361
02:43:42,041 --> 02:43:43,930
but he's officially
retired and he's retired.

6362
02:43:44,110 --> 02:43:44,970
But Wonderboy,

6363
02:43:45,010 --> 02:43:48,520
I mean [inaudible] was around a UFC 12.

6364
02:43:48,970 --> 02:43:49,721
That's crazy.

6365
02:43:49,721 --> 02:43:54,370
Henderson was around [inaudible] 98
so it wasn't much longer afterwards.

6366
02:43:55,030 --> 02:43:55,863
You know.

6367
02:43:56,680 --> 02:43:57,161
Crazy.

6368
02:43:57,161 --> 02:43:57,994
Really?

6369
02:43:58,240 --> 02:43:58,781
They fought,

6370
02:43:58,781 --> 02:43:58,991
right?

6371
02:43:58,991 --> 02:44:02,530
Dan Henderson Times v
Torn Kao them both times.

6372
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:03,393
Yup.

6373
02:44:04,550 --> 02:44:05,230
Oh,

6374
02:44:05,230 --> 02:44:05,431
oh,

6375
02:44:05,431 --> 02:44:06,550
we caught all right Dan.

6376
02:44:06,551 --> 02:44:08,520
See till starting to get anxious here.

6377
02:44:08,550 --> 02:44:09,630
This one's gonna get in trouble,

6378
02:44:09,631 --> 02:44:10,464
man.

6379
02:44:13,190 --> 02:44:14,380
Ooh,

6380
02:44:14,590 --> 02:44:15,400
well he's looking for wonder.

6381
02:44:15,400 --> 02:44:16,151
Boy gets big.

6382
02:44:16,151 --> 02:44:17,480
Kaylin's it's using his legs,

6383
02:44:17,481 --> 02:44:17,661
man.

6384
02:44:17,661 --> 02:44:19,220
I mean his hands are dangerous,

6385
02:44:19,221 --> 02:44:20,870
but his powers in those fucking legs.

6386
02:44:20,900 --> 02:44:21,950
Oh Shit.

6387
02:44:21,980 --> 02:44:23,370
He's found that head kick a few times.

6388
02:44:23,371 --> 02:44:24,500
It was a sick slip,

6389
02:44:24,770 --> 02:44:27,620
but till who does till train with,

6390
02:44:28,330 --> 02:44:32,010
I don't know much about his
to come bone and Liverpool.

6391
02:44:33,810 --> 02:44:34,250
Uh,

6392
02:44:34,250 --> 02:44:35,570
his coaches calling,

6393
02:44:35,571 --> 02:44:36,530
I forget his last name.

6394
02:44:38,600 --> 02:44:39,070
It's crazy.

6395
02:44:39,070 --> 02:44:39,491
One of the boys,

6396
02:44:39,491 --> 02:44:40,840
dad cranes him,

6397
02:44:40,841 --> 02:44:41,170
right?

6398
02:44:41,170 --> 02:44:41,621
Yeah.

6399
02:44:41,621 --> 02:44:42,730
It'd be tough dynamic.

6400
02:44:42,820 --> 02:44:43,510
Ooh Damn that.

6401
02:44:43,510 --> 02:44:44,900
Not everyone has to touch.

6402
02:44:45,370 --> 02:44:46,203
Just touched him,

6403
02:44:46,420 --> 02:44:47,740
but he did touch them at the very end.

6404
02:44:47,741 --> 02:44:49,390
With that a round kick to the face.

6405
02:44:49,391 --> 02:44:53,360
You might be finding an opening for
that one to blitz out till just tag them

6406
02:44:53,361 --> 02:44:54,194
with that job.

6407
02:44:56,920 --> 02:44:59,000
I have a hard time believing
these judges don't have it.

6408
02:44:59,001 --> 02:44:59,834
Three nothing.

6409
02:45:00,170 --> 02:45:01,003
Right,

6410
02:45:01,010 --> 02:45:01,400
right.

6411
02:45:01,400 --> 02:45:03,770
In Liverpool dock to gun control.

6412
02:45:03,860 --> 02:45:05,840
Well not say dry judges are two.

6413
02:45:05,841 --> 02:45:06,051
Right.

6414
02:45:06,051 --> 02:45:09,030
Or the American judges and the
English judges are all morons though,

6415
02:45:09,031 --> 02:45:11,120
aren't they all around the world?

6416
02:45:11,390 --> 02:45:12,290
Unfortunately.

6417
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:16,130
I love the fact that you could say
that you don't work for anybody.

6418
02:45:16,190 --> 02:45:16,521
I know.

6419
02:45:16,521 --> 02:45:17,121
Isn't it cool?

6420
02:45:17,121 --> 02:45:17,954
And you can't

6421
02:45:20,610 --> 02:45:21,443
have no,

6422
02:45:21,580 --> 02:45:22,580
oh no till.

6423
02:45:22,590 --> 02:45:23,470
Got poked in the eye.

6424
02:45:23,490 --> 02:45:24,530
Get the fuck outta here,

6425
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:30,920
mark gutters.

6426
02:45:30,920 --> 02:45:32,700
We're worried about an
eye poked in anybody.

6427
02:45:33,830 --> 02:45:34,441
That boy,

6428
02:45:34,441 --> 02:45:35,820
that doctor got in that room quick,

6429
02:45:36,330 --> 02:45:37,470
but doctor just jumped in.

6430
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:38,221
God,

6431
02:45:38,221 --> 02:45:39,180
what did he come from?

6432
02:45:39,450 --> 02:45:40,283
And now he's out.

6433
02:45:40,790 --> 02:45:42,570
He's trying to get a
little too much TV time.

6434
02:45:44,800 --> 02:45:45,190
Oh yeah.

6435
02:45:45,190 --> 02:45:45,911
Oh definitely.

6436
02:45:45,911 --> 02:45:48,340
And Marina don't mean to poke or Reno.

6437
02:45:51,660 --> 02:45:51,841
Oh,

6438
02:45:51,841 --> 02:45:52,561
they were booing him.

6439
02:45:52,561 --> 02:45:52,711
Yeah.

6440
02:45:52,711 --> 02:45:53,161
He's saying no,

6441
02:45:53,161 --> 02:45:53,311
no.

6442
02:45:53,311 --> 02:45:54,144
Boom.

6443
02:45:56,380 --> 02:45:56,831
Oh Shit.

6444
02:45:56,831 --> 02:45:59,680
Sometimes I poked really rev
a dude up or a Dick kick.

6445
02:46:01,450 --> 02:46:02,350
Oh my God.

6446
02:46:02,370 --> 02:46:03,910
Dan tells get wild here.

6447
02:46:04,380 --> 02:46:04,660
You know.

6448
02:46:04,660 --> 02:46:05,800
Don't get too comfortable.

6449
02:46:05,830 --> 02:46:06,221
Okay,

6450
02:46:06,221 --> 02:46:06,611
there you go.

6451
02:46:06,611 --> 02:46:07,810
Going over the top.

6452
02:46:08,300 --> 02:46:09,220
Oh shit man.

6453
02:46:09,700 --> 02:46:10,270
Talk,

6454
02:46:10,270 --> 02:46:11,000

6455
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:11,151
Oh,

6456
02:46:11,151 --> 02:46:12,170
he's getting crazy here

6457
02:46:14,460 --> 02:46:15,293
dude.

6458
02:46:15,580 --> 02:46:16,241
That I poke.

6459
02:46:16,241 --> 02:46:17,074
Really poke him.

6460
02:46:17,090 --> 02:46:19,300
I wish you would have poked nine in
the first round or the round here.

6461
02:46:20,510 --> 02:46:22,520
Now I was trying to get loose
and I was about to get fun.

6462
02:46:22,630 --> 02:46:23,463
That was three.

6463
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:24,790
So we've got two more to go.

6464
02:46:25,570 --> 02:46:26,980
Thank God this is a five rounder,

6465
02:46:26,981 --> 02:46:27,814
right?

6466
02:46:27,990 --> 02:46:29,200
Will be pissed.

6467
02:46:29,360 --> 02:46:29,540
Yeah.

6468
02:46:29,540 --> 02:46:30,373
It feel so.

6469
02:46:30,720 --> 02:46:33,100
I would not talk so much shit
on that fight is three rounds.

6470
02:46:33,101 --> 02:46:33,934
It ended there.

6471
02:46:34,030 --> 02:46:34,863
Yeah,

6472
02:46:36,750 --> 02:46:37,583
man.

6473
02:46:38,150 --> 02:46:43,150
That dude has a prominent forehead
cheekbone situation going on.

6474
02:46:43,860 --> 02:46:43,960
Yeah.

6475
02:46:43,960 --> 02:46:44,910
I think gang is kind.

6476
02:46:44,911 --> 02:46:45,830
Got a little bit of that.

6477
02:46:45,860 --> 02:46:47,480
A little bit of,

6478
02:46:47,690 --> 02:46:50,030
he's definitely got some
fucking ancient man and I'm,

6479
02:46:50,120 --> 02:46:50,953
he does.

6480
02:46:51,050 --> 02:46:52,010
I don't look like him.

6481
02:46:52,070 --> 02:46:53,180
He definitely boom.

6482
02:46:53,181 --> 02:46:54,014
That right hand.

6483
02:46:54,260 --> 02:46:55,340
That was the nice account counter.

6484
02:46:55,341 --> 02:46:56,174
I'm here.

6485
02:46:58,490 --> 02:46:59,210
Boom,

6486
02:46:59,210 --> 02:46:59,750
boom.

6487
02:46:59,750 --> 02:47:00,040
Oh,

6488
02:47:00,040 --> 02:47:00,970
that got him that night.

6489
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:01,340
It did.

6490
02:47:01,340 --> 02:47:01,641
Definitely.

6491
02:47:01,641 --> 02:47:02,540
He slip with it.

6492
02:47:02,690 --> 02:47:02,841
Yeah.

6493
02:47:02,841 --> 02:47:03,411
He went with it,

6494
02:47:03,411 --> 02:47:05,120
but it caught him at
the end of it for sure.

6495
02:47:05,180 --> 02:47:05,350
Look,

6496
02:47:05,350 --> 02:47:05,751
not quite done.

6497
02:47:05,751 --> 02:47:06,584
I'm like tired.

6498
02:47:08,970 --> 02:47:09,990
This is his style,

6499
02:47:09,991 --> 02:47:10,121
you know,

6500
02:47:10,121 --> 02:47:11,580
and he's so efficient at doing that.

6501
02:47:11,640 --> 02:47:11,791
Oh,

6502
02:47:11,791 --> 02:47:12,091
both.

6503
02:47:12,091 --> 02:47:13,890
These guys can do this for 10 rounds.

6504
02:47:14,430 --> 02:47:15,030
Yeah.

6505
02:47:15,030 --> 02:47:16,320
Round four here we go.

6506
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:17,790
God,

6507
02:47:17,790 --> 02:47:18,090
it's,

6508
02:47:18,090 --> 02:47:19,080
this is a fight.

6509
02:47:19,081 --> 02:47:23,010
That is a great argument for the
five round fight for high level.

6510
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:24,450
500%

6511
02:47:26,880 --> 02:47:30,180
maybe we would feel so bad if we
were leaving here and then like,

6512
02:47:30,181 --> 02:47:30,631
who won?

6513
02:47:30,631 --> 02:47:32,490
Who cares what even happened?

6514
02:47:33,090 --> 02:47:33,471
Like what?

6515
02:47:33,471 --> 02:47:34,680
What are the stats on?

6516
02:47:35,140 --> 02:47:35,720
Oh Dude.

6517
02:47:35,720 --> 02:47:36,720
Enlist trenches and kicks.

6518
02:47:36,721 --> 02:47:37,230
Landed.

6519
02:47:37,230 --> 02:47:37,471
Yeah.

6520
02:47:37,471 --> 02:47:40,810
Unless you're super and
you'd be so does wonderful.

6521
02:47:40,811 --> 02:47:41,641
It was a hard jab.

6522
02:47:41,641 --> 02:47:41,821
Right.

6523
02:47:41,821 --> 02:47:42,654
Their kid,

6524
02:47:43,670 --> 02:47:44,311
they tilt better.

6525
02:47:44,311 --> 02:47:45,660
Watch his p's and q's though.

6526
02:47:45,661 --> 02:47:46,710
You are too hard man.

6527
02:47:46,740 --> 02:47:47,573
Yup.

6528
02:47:49,400 --> 02:47:50,233
But

6529
02:47:51,030 --> 02:47:52,920
juice is worth the squeeze
if can get knocked down.

6530
02:47:57,750 --> 02:47:58,583
Oh

6531
02:47:59,720 --> 02:48:00,553
Damn.

6532
02:48:01,780 --> 02:48:02,760
This is getting hot.

6533
02:48:10,320 --> 02:48:10,531
Yeah.

6534
02:48:10,531 --> 02:48:10,960
Cause Yeah.

6535
02:48:10,960 --> 02:48:12,810
And tills never been five rounds as he,

6536
02:48:13,390 --> 02:48:13,950
no,

6537
02:48:13,950 --> 02:48:14,850
I don't think so.

6538
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:16,020
He hasn't switched in the EOC.

6539
02:48:16,021 --> 02:48:20,260
This first made it well first times
because his main event against cowboy,

6540
02:48:20,261 --> 02:48:21,310
I'll starch cowboys.

6541
02:48:21,320 --> 02:48:22,153
He hasn't.

6542
02:48:24,820 --> 02:48:24,941
Yeah.

6543
02:48:24,941 --> 02:48:26,200
This is the first main event.

6544
02:48:26,201 --> 02:48:27,034
Right.

6545
02:48:27,160 --> 02:48:28,780
And what about outside of the UFC?

6546
02:48:30,490 --> 02:48:31,930
How many fights he had?

6547
02:48:32,210 --> 02:48:37,210
What 17 or a 14 on crazy
speaks perfect Portuguese.

6548
02:48:37,330 --> 02:48:37,451
Oh,

6549
02:48:37,451 --> 02:48:37,781
does he?

6550
02:48:37,781 --> 02:48:38,470
I didn't know that.

6551
02:48:38,470 --> 02:48:39,303
Oh yeah man.

6552
02:48:39,310 --> 02:48:40,780
Fuck Darren till at damn,

6553
02:48:40,781 --> 02:48:41,620
this kid's marketable.

6554
02:48:41,740 --> 02:48:42,850
When he fought in Brazil,

6555
02:48:42,870 --> 02:48:43,060
uh,

6556
02:48:43,060 --> 02:48:43,240
he,

6557
02:48:43,240 --> 02:48:44,980
he spoke Portuguese to the crowd.

6558
02:48:44,981 --> 02:48:46,090
He lived there for like 10 years,

6559
02:48:46,091 --> 02:48:46,271
right?

6560
02:48:46,271 --> 02:48:46,631
Yeah.

6561
02:48:46,631 --> 02:48:47,500
I watched one of his,

6562
02:48:47,501 --> 02:48:47,611
uh,

6563
02:48:47,611 --> 02:48:51,010
older fights when we stop this guy and he,

6564
02:48:51,011 --> 02:48:51,580
uh,

6565
02:48:51,580 --> 02:48:54,160
spoke Portuguese to the crowd
after the fire looked the guy up,

6566
02:48:55,450 --> 02:48:56,500
10 fights were there.

6567
02:48:56,860 --> 02:48:57,693
Wow.

6568
02:48:57,850 --> 02:48:57,971
Yeah,

6569
02:48:57,971 --> 02:48:58,480
he went down.

6570
02:48:58,480 --> 02:48:59,650
It just went to live down there.

6571
02:48:59,700 --> 02:49:02,270
He had to get her to Liverpool because
I guess there's a little talk it for him

6572
02:49:03,100 --> 02:49:04,150
where he got stabbed.

6573
02:49:04,510 --> 02:49:04,710
Yeah.

6574
02:49:04,710 --> 02:49:04,990
Yes.

6575
02:49:04,990 --> 02:49:05,111
The,

6576
02:49:05,111 --> 02:49:05,261
yeah.

6577
02:49:05,261 --> 02:49:06,250
You can see the stem mark.

6578
02:49:06,670 --> 02:49:09,490
Where is it a lower like on his,

6579
02:49:09,500 --> 02:49:09,720
uh,

6580
02:49:09,720 --> 02:49:10,490
it'd be on his rights.

6581
02:49:10,490 --> 02:49:11,580
He got to Dab in Brazil,

6582
02:49:11,610 --> 02:49:13,350
but right above his hip in England,

6583
02:49:14,070 --> 02:49:14,641
in Liverpool,

6584
02:49:14,641 --> 02:49:15,474
in his hometown.

6585
02:49:15,690 --> 02:49:16,231
And his coach,

6586
02:49:16,231 --> 02:49:16,951
his coach told him,

6587
02:49:16,951 --> 02:49:17,071
Hey,

6588
02:49:17,071 --> 02:49:18,000
you gotta get Outta here man.

6589
02:49:18,001 --> 02:49:21,660
If you want to continue to have their
knives and the UK and often off,

6590
02:49:23,010 --> 02:49:26,100
how many more people
got to get stuff that's,

6591
02:49:26,101 --> 02:49:26,311
you know,

6592
02:49:26,311 --> 02:49:30,060
the London mayor actually said that
if you get caught with a knife,

6593
02:49:30,360 --> 02:49:32,910
it'd be prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law.

6594
02:49:33,450 --> 02:49:34,950
What about if I got to open boxes,

6595
02:49:36,750 --> 02:49:37,583
princesses,

6596
02:49:37,960 --> 02:49:38,460
brother-in-law,

6597
02:49:38,460 --> 02:49:41,310
her brother got caught with one when he
went over there for the royal wedding

6598
02:49:41,311 --> 02:49:42,030
last week.

6599
02:49:42,030 --> 02:49:42,151
Oh,

6600
02:49:42,151 --> 02:49:43,390
that you got caught with a knife?

6601
02:49:43,710 --> 02:49:45,840
He took one because Trump said
that you should take one with him.

6602
02:49:45,930 --> 02:49:46,763
And he was in a bar.

6603
02:49:46,830 --> 02:49:47,230
Got,

6604
02:49:47,230 --> 02:49:47,430
oh,

6605
02:49:47,430 --> 02:49:48,263
he's crazy.

6606
02:49:48,450 --> 02:49:50,100
Is he crazy or brother's crazy?

6607
02:49:50,220 --> 02:49:51,090
She's a dime piece,

6608
02:49:51,100 --> 02:49:51,933
man.

6609
02:49:54,990 --> 02:49:55,950
I'm assuming you to Deb.

6610
02:49:55,951 --> 02:49:56,281
Nothing.

6611
02:49:56,281 --> 02:49:56,461
No,

6612
02:49:56,461 --> 02:49:57,830
I didn't get the fuck down.

6613
02:49:57,831 --> 02:49:58,311
I'm watching it.

6614
02:49:58,311 --> 02:49:58,711
It's fine.

6615
02:49:58,711 --> 02:49:59,544
Your son,

6616
02:50:00,060 --> 02:50:02,280
one boy with the step in Jab.

6617
02:50:05,560 --> 02:50:07,120
Not a lot of action that's fighting.

6618
02:50:07,180 --> 02:50:08,410
Oh,

6619
02:50:08,411 --> 02:50:11,530
Wonderboy looking for that left
hand over the top because it land.

6620
02:50:11,620 --> 02:50:12,160
Nope.

6621
02:50:12,160 --> 02:50:13,210
Just kind of grazed him.

6622
02:50:13,960 --> 02:50:15,790
It's Kinda hard to tell us back was to us.

6623
02:50:16,030 --> 02:50:17,980
It's can be a tough
fucking fight to judge,

6624
02:50:17,981 --> 02:50:18,814
man.

6625
02:50:21,660 --> 02:50:22,870
Tell us having a hard time hitting him,

6626
02:50:22,871 --> 02:50:23,950
that's for damn sure.

6627
02:50:24,220 --> 02:50:24,911
Beautiful Duck.

6628
02:50:24,911 --> 02:50:25,211
Under that,

6629
02:50:25,211 --> 02:50:26,800
we get this tail with a clinch.

6630
02:50:27,210 --> 02:50:29,830
What if he takes him down to,

6631
02:50:29,860 --> 02:50:30,940
we just stop the fight.

6632
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:31,520
Interestingly,

6633
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:31,901
the tills,

6634
02:50:31,901 --> 02:50:33,070
the one holding onto him here.

6635
02:50:33,130 --> 02:50:33,461
Oh,

6636
02:50:33,461 --> 02:50:35,050
elbow that clinches.

6637
02:50:35,051 --> 02:50:36,190
Mortised nasty.

6638
02:50:39,230 --> 02:50:40,520
Good elbow on the break there.

6639
02:50:42,190 --> 02:50:44,180
If you're one of my say
exactly what he wanted,

6640
02:50:44,660 --> 02:50:45,830
that light's kind of fucked up.

6641
02:50:45,831 --> 02:50:46,591
That lead leg it,

6642
02:50:46,591 --> 02:50:46,771
right?

6643
02:50:46,771 --> 02:50:47,420
Yeah.

6644
02:50:47,420 --> 02:50:47,780
Yup.

6645
02:50:47,780 --> 02:50:49,010
It does look a little bruised.

6646
02:50:49,190 --> 02:50:49,820
Oh Oo.

6647
02:50:49,820 --> 02:50:50,700
Good kick to the body.

6648
02:50:50,701 --> 02:50:50,880
I,

6649
02:50:50,880 --> 02:50:51,440
yeah.

6650
02:50:51,440 --> 02:50:53,450
You guys watched that show Cobra Kai?

6651
02:50:53,960 --> 02:50:54,171
No,

6652
02:50:54,171 --> 02:50:55,004
I haven't seen her.

6653
02:50:55,160 --> 02:50:56,390
I've heard the cost to be good.

6654
02:50:56,480 --> 02:50:56,691
Yeah.

6655
02:50:56,691 --> 02:50:56,841
No,

6656
02:50:56,841 --> 02:50:57,261
it's great.

6657
02:50:57,261 --> 02:50:59,610
That's a crazy well on Wonderboy.

6658
02:50:59,611 --> 02:51:00,170
His leg.

6659
02:51:00,170 --> 02:51:03,080
I really haven't noticed him
getting hit that much either.

6660
02:51:03,230 --> 02:51:04,570
It's on both legs to the,

6661
02:51:04,571 --> 02:51:05,450
obviously the right legs.

6662
02:51:05,451 --> 02:51:07,070
Worse with that left leg is pretty tender.

6663
02:51:07,071 --> 02:51:10,310
Roni till the ride
language really fucked us.

6664
02:51:10,311 --> 02:51:11,960
I don't really remember
him kicking that heart.

6665
02:51:12,050 --> 02:51:14,990
It must've been when he was
standing in southpaw sideways,

6666
02:51:15,020 --> 02:51:15,853
you know,

6667
02:51:17,470 --> 02:51:18,810
and now he hasn't gone back then.

6668
02:51:18,830 --> 02:51:20,610
Athey really not mine.

6669
02:51:20,630 --> 02:51:22,000
Let's just round it doesn't like it.

6670
02:51:22,450 --> 02:51:23,410
Oh my God.

6671
02:51:23,460 --> 02:51:23,640
Yeah.

6672
02:51:23,640 --> 02:51:23,750
He,

6673
02:51:23,750 --> 02:51:24,340
his footwork.

6674
02:51:24,340 --> 02:51:25,001
Just stupid.

6675
02:51:25,001 --> 02:51:26,740
So Darren till can't
really get a read on them.

6676
02:51:27,970 --> 02:51:28,421
But again,

6677
02:51:28,421 --> 02:51:29,860
the judges are given that the tail.

6678
02:51:30,710 --> 02:51:31,543
Yeah.

6679
02:51:31,690 --> 02:51:31,970
Yeah.

6680
02:51:31,970 --> 02:51:35,080
Nothing big has happened
where you go all that guide.

6681
02:51:35,260 --> 02:51:36,190
Definitely.

6682
02:51:36,550 --> 02:51:37,090
If someone,

6683
02:51:37,090 --> 02:51:38,710
if someone just knocked someone down,

6684
02:51:38,740 --> 02:51:42,370
you've got the fight and it shows Mike
LP got the good right hand to the body.

6685
02:51:50,140 --> 02:51:52,110
Such a high level chess game here,

6686
02:51:52,350 --> 02:51:53,131
which I dig it.

6687
02:51:53,131 --> 02:51:54,090
I'm on the edge of my seat.

6688
02:51:54,091 --> 02:51:55,410
But if you're just a regular fan,

6689
02:51:55,411 --> 02:51:55,561
like,

6690
02:51:55,561 --> 02:51:56,520
come on man.

6691
02:52:00,250 --> 02:52:03,920
I tell you what he's going to get more
shit is Wonderboy because there's one

6692
02:52:04,030 --> 02:52:04,810
Woodley fights.

6693
02:52:04,810 --> 02:52:05,540
Which thoughts?

6694
02:52:05,540 --> 02:52:06,373
It's fault.

6695
02:52:06,760 --> 02:52:07,421
It's not his fault.

6696
02:52:07,421 --> 02:52:08,440
I'm just saying the public thing.

6697
02:52:08,441 --> 02:52:09,880
Some shit I guess.

6698
02:52:09,881 --> 02:52:10,331
I don't know.

6699
02:52:10,331 --> 02:52:11,200
It's what it is.

6700
02:52:11,630 --> 02:52:12,490
It's this is the,

6701
02:52:12,540 --> 02:52:13,990
I mean you want to beat him.

6702
02:52:13,991 --> 02:52:15,880
You got to come after him
and you come after him.

6703
02:52:15,881 --> 02:52:16,990
You run into the woodchipper.

6704
02:52:17,110 --> 02:52:19,180
But the thing is he's not
winning when he does this,

6705
02:52:20,530 --> 02:52:23,350
but we didn't win against Woodley
when he did this for sure.

6706
02:52:23,410 --> 02:52:24,560
But he's obviously,

6707
02:52:24,561 --> 02:52:24,770
yeah,

6708
02:52:24,770 --> 02:52:26,650
he's obviously got
number one for a reason.

6709
02:52:26,680 --> 02:52:28,410
He's number one in the
world happened there.

6710
02:52:29,210 --> 02:52:30,130
Cut that back.

6711
02:52:30,131 --> 02:52:31,450
Leg is fucked up man.

6712
02:52:32,200 --> 02:52:32,830
Yeah,

6713
02:52:32,830 --> 02:52:34,170
I'll do friendly voice will.

6714
02:52:34,940 --> 02:52:35,200
Yeah,

6715
02:52:35,200 --> 02:52:37,180
he's wobbling a little on
the back to his corner.

6716
02:52:37,181 --> 02:52:38,530
That leg is fucked up man.

6717
02:52:40,750 --> 02:52:43,450
Maybe they just didn't loosen this fifth
round and just save it for the fifth

6718
02:52:43,451 --> 02:52:43,751
round.

6719
02:52:43,751 --> 02:52:44,584
Eddie.

6720
02:52:44,890 --> 02:52:45,700
I hope so.

6721
02:52:45,700 --> 02:52:46,240
Me Too.

6722
02:52:46,240 --> 02:52:46,691
Cause again,

6723
02:52:46,691 --> 02:52:48,400
if it stopped right
here I'd be bummed out.

6724
02:52:48,940 --> 02:52:51,470
I'm going to Sikeston pretty lack luster.

6725
02:52:51,500 --> 02:52:52,210
Yeah.

6726
02:52:52,210 --> 02:52:56,810
I was really trust to till
I'm 100% know that every,

6727
02:52:56,950 --> 02:52:58,250
every round of that gift to went that.

6728
02:52:59,110 --> 02:52:59,831
And then once it was like,

6729
02:52:59,831 --> 02:53:01,040
we don't want to like it too obviously,

6730
02:53:01,041 --> 02:53:02,280
and he gives one to one a boy,

6731
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:03,713
I don't know.

6732
02:53:03,770 --> 02:53:04,603
I'd say he's up.

6733
02:53:05,080 --> 02:53:06,360
He's up three to one till.

6734
02:53:06,420 --> 02:53:06,820
Yeah.

6735
02:53:06,820 --> 02:53:07,653
Really?

6736
02:53:07,750 --> 02:53:08,740
Because of the judges.

6737
02:53:08,770 --> 02:53:09,280
Yes.

6738
02:53:09,280 --> 02:53:10,660
But knowledge is of what you think,

6739
02:53:10,661 --> 02:53:11,110
right?

6740
02:53:11,110 --> 02:53:12,370
Uh,

6741
02:53:12,460 --> 02:53:13,750
even then it'd be tough.

6742
02:53:14,020 --> 02:53:15,310
You can maybe go to two,

6743
02:53:15,311 --> 02:53:15,940
but I,

6744
02:53:15,940 --> 02:53:17,200
I'd say tills winning this fight.

6745
02:53:18,640 --> 02:53:19,780
I don't know about that.

6746
02:53:19,781 --> 02:53:21,070
I think Wonderboy is winning.

6747
02:53:21,490 --> 02:53:22,930
Can I get some goddamned copy?

6748
02:53:22,931 --> 02:53:23,591
Strike numbers,

6749
02:53:23,591 --> 02:53:24,131
Fox.

6750
02:53:24,131 --> 02:53:24,640
I know.

6751
02:53:24,640 --> 02:53:25,900
No wonder they left her ass.

6752
02:53:25,960 --> 02:53:26,793
Just kidding.

6753
02:53:27,370 --> 02:53:28,480
Can I get something?

6754
02:53:30,520 --> 02:53:31,930
How's your show going on showtime?

6755
02:53:31,990 --> 02:53:32,823
Enjoying it.

6756
02:53:32,950 --> 02:53:33,783
It's been good man.

6757
02:53:34,060 --> 02:53:34,720
It's been fun.

6758
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:36,220
Nice to a lot of fun.

6759
02:53:36,250 --> 02:53:40,000
Did you know that guy that just died
without from the comedy division?

6760
02:53:40,001 --> 02:53:40,151
Yeah,

6761
02:53:40,151 --> 02:53:40,984
I did not.

6762
02:53:41,620 --> 02:53:42,550
Did you know,

6763
02:53:42,551 --> 02:53:43,510
everybody seems to think he's,

6764
02:53:43,630 --> 02:53:44,261
I might've met him,

6765
02:53:44,261 --> 02:53:46,120
but everybody seems to think
he's a really good guy.

6766
02:53:46,200 --> 02:53:47,150
That sucks man.

6767
02:53:47,370 --> 02:53:48,400
55 man.

6768
02:53:48,550 --> 02:53:49,290
I know.

6769
02:53:49,290 --> 02:53:49,960
Such a shame.

6770
02:53:49,960 --> 02:53:50,793
Crazy.

6771
02:53:51,460 --> 02:53:52,300
Burt loved the Gar.

6772
02:53:52,810 --> 02:53:53,320
Oh yeah.

6773
02:53:53,320 --> 02:53:53,621
Yeah.

6774
02:53:53,621 --> 02:53:55,300
I burned up some real nice to say,

6775
02:53:55,301 --> 02:53:56,260
but also the dice.

6776
02:53:56,410 --> 02:53:57,280
That's a bummer man.

6777
02:53:57,370 --> 02:53:58,203
Yeah.

6778
02:53:59,790 --> 02:54:01,980
Tills super aggressive
here coming off from you.

6779
02:54:01,981 --> 02:54:04,850
I'm sure he wants to get the finish
probably feels a little bit of pressure

6780
02:54:06,650 --> 02:54:07,483
and you should.

6781
02:54:11,060 --> 02:54:11,451
Okay.

6782
02:54:11,451 --> 02:54:13,880
They're saying Darren
tills corns very urgent,

6783
02:54:14,990 --> 02:54:16,070
like he's losing the fight.

6784
02:54:16,120 --> 02:54:16,953
No,

6785
02:54:19,520 --> 02:54:20,570
I think he's losing.

6786
02:54:21,080 --> 02:54:21,620
You do.

6787
02:54:21,620 --> 02:54:22,453
Yeah.

6788
02:54:23,480 --> 02:54:23,661
Yeah.

6789
02:54:23,661 --> 02:54:28,280
I think if I would count up all the
different strikes strikes that landed.

6790
02:54:28,370 --> 02:54:28,790
Yeah.

6791
02:54:28,790 --> 02:54:29,331
I think a lot of this,

6792
02:54:29,331 --> 02:54:31,370
according to the UFC thing,

6793
02:54:31,540 --> 02:54:31,851
I don't know,

6794
02:54:31,851 --> 02:54:33,320
hosted in terms of strikes.

6795
02:54:33,321 --> 02:54:36,010
Landed says 48 to 42 Gundam.

6796
02:54:36,170 --> 02:54:37,130
That's tough to judge.

6797
02:54:37,160 --> 02:54:37,311
Yeah.

6798
02:54:37,311 --> 02:54:38,144
That's impossible.

6799
02:54:38,440 --> 02:54:39,380
One aggressor,

6800
02:54:39,410 --> 02:54:39,810
right.

6801
02:54:39,810 --> 02:54:41,120
In Liverpool,

6802
02:54:41,900 --> 02:54:42,980
I got to crazy.

6803
02:54:43,280 --> 02:54:44,690
Five rounds,

6804
02:54:44,780 --> 02:54:46,250
48 strikes landed.

6805
02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:47,940
That is just not bananas.

6806
02:54:47,950 --> 02:54:49,100
A lot of defense going on.

6807
02:54:49,101 --> 02:54:49,550
Yeah.

6808
02:54:49,550 --> 02:54:51,050
A lot of missing is what I'm movement.

6809
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:54,820
Which styles do you think
would make for a great,

6810
02:54:54,880 --> 02:54:55,080
oh,

6811
02:54:55,080 --> 02:54:58,640
this is a good writing sample and
tell a little jab to the grill face

6812
02:55:02,460 --> 02:55:03,293
sidekick,

6813
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:04,843
please.

6814
02:55:07,800 --> 02:55:09,960
No one's really going balls
to the wall or they know

6815
02:55:10,950 --> 02:55:11,783
good

6816
02:55:14,260 --> 02:55:15,880
Darren to would go balls to the walls,

6817
02:55:15,881 --> 02:55:16,960
but wonderful.

6818
02:55:16,961 --> 02:55:17,794
It keeps moving.

6819
02:55:18,310 --> 02:55:19,060
It's hard.

6820
02:55:19,060 --> 02:55:20,630
Fucking writing keeps moving.

6821
02:55:20,880 --> 02:55:22,570
You don't get blasted in the face.

6822
02:55:22,630 --> 02:55:22,960
Yeah.

6823
02:55:22,960 --> 02:55:23,793
It's hard.

6824
02:55:24,090 --> 02:55:25,020
What did we come on man,

6825
02:55:25,030 --> 02:55:25,863
just sit there.

6826
02:55:26,230 --> 02:55:26,891
What was that about?

6827
02:55:26,891 --> 02:55:27,551
He threw a Shitty,

6828
02:55:27,551 --> 02:55:30,220
we'll kick and then shook his
head and then they touch gloves.

6829
02:55:30,250 --> 02:55:30,730
It's fun.

6830
02:55:30,730 --> 02:55:31,510
Fucking weird.

6831
02:55:31,510 --> 02:55:32,390
Oh,

6832
02:55:32,540 --> 02:55:33,490
switched up on them.

6833
02:55:34,140 --> 02:55:35,950
It's too or a little too
friendly for my liking.

6834
02:55:35,980 --> 02:55:38,080
He's looking to set up his
wheel kick with his left leg.

6835
02:55:39,700 --> 02:55:40,940
Someone throws something.

6836
02:55:41,710 --> 02:55:42,543
Anything.

6837
02:55:42,610 --> 02:55:43,241
The crowds like,

6838
02:55:43,241 --> 02:55:43,541
yeah,

6839
02:55:43,541 --> 02:55:45,460
that you have on there till,

6840
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:47,153
but he doesn't,

6841
02:55:49,560 --> 02:55:51,010
oh there he landed a lefthand.

6842
02:55:52,910 --> 02:55:53,743
Why are they touching?

6843
02:55:53,950 --> 02:55:56,740
What do I to touch dab cause
got all the goddamn corner.

6844
02:55:56,770 --> 02:55:58,670
Oh is that about gorillas?

6845
02:55:58,671 --> 02:55:59,504
Don't act like that.

6846
02:55:59,570 --> 02:56:00,710
I don't understand this.

6847
02:56:00,711 --> 02:56:01,550
That does touch gloves.

6848
02:56:01,551 --> 02:56:01,851
Again,

6849
02:56:01,851 --> 02:56:02,840
too much respect.

6850
02:56:02,841 --> 02:56:05,600
I know there's not enough
killer instinct in this.

6851
02:56:06,260 --> 02:56:10,190
He's looking for that low fake and then
go with the high round kick off the

6852
02:56:10,191 --> 02:56:10,671
front leg.

6853
02:56:10,671 --> 02:56:11,660
He does that sometimes,

6854
02:56:12,290 --> 02:56:15,020
but he didn't do it and you just like
to know how many miles they've ran this

6855
02:56:15,050 --> 02:56:15,883
goddamn fight.

6856
02:56:17,390 --> 02:56:19,090
You kind of give it to them
for sticking to their phone.

6857
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:21,730
No one's getting out of
composure here to pros.

6858
02:56:21,731 --> 02:56:22,150
Pros.

6859
02:56:22,150 --> 02:56:22,450
No,

6860
02:56:22,450 --> 02:56:23,271
I get the style.

6861
02:56:23,271 --> 02:56:23,511
You don't,

6862
02:56:23,511 --> 02:56:24,620
you don't want to risk it,

6863
02:56:26,230 --> 02:56:26,650
but if,

6864
02:56:26,650 --> 02:56:26,860
yeah,

6865
02:56:26,860 --> 02:56:28,360
if you're not balls deep into fighting,

6866
02:56:28,361 --> 02:56:29,530
you're not happy with this fight.

6867
02:56:29,560 --> 02:56:29,701
No,

6868
02:56:29,701 --> 02:56:30,880
I'm not thrilled with it.

6869
02:56:30,910 --> 02:56:32,080
This is like what I'm looking at it.

6870
02:56:32,440 --> 02:56:35,080
One of the most uneventful big events.

6871
02:56:35,890 --> 02:56:36,340
Who?

6872
02:56:36,340 --> 02:56:37,480
Good Jabs by till.

6873
02:56:39,060 --> 02:56:41,260
Oh Damn,

6874
02:56:42,790 --> 02:56:43,623
guillotine.

6875
02:56:44,300 --> 02:56:44,850
Okay.

6876
02:56:44,850 --> 02:56:45,001
Oh,

6877
02:56:45,001 --> 02:56:45,190
he,

6878
02:56:45,190 --> 02:56:45,610
I thought he,

6879
02:56:45,610 --> 02:56:47,010
Oh shit.

6880
02:56:47,220 --> 02:56:48,270
That's enough to win the fight.

6881
02:56:48,400 --> 02:56:49,950
100% that's all he needed.

6882
02:56:50,490 --> 02:56:52,560
Don't get drop time to go
a little bit of time to go.

6883
02:56:52,590 --> 02:56:52,770
Damn.

6884
02:56:52,770 --> 02:56:55,100
How hard does that motherfucker
hit and it didn't look like it.

6885
02:56:55,101 --> 02:56:55,381
Atlanta,

6886
02:56:55,381 --> 02:56:56,400
like behind the air.

6887
02:56:57,060 --> 02:56:58,200
We'd have to look at it in the replay,

6888
02:56:58,201 --> 02:56:59,130
but it look are you heard him?

6889
02:57:00,420 --> 02:57:00,880
I wonder.

6890
02:57:00,880 --> 02:57:02,400
Boy has got to move his ass now.

6891
02:57:02,401 --> 02:57:03,270
He lost the fight.

6892
02:57:03,480 --> 02:57:03,911
Well wonder boy,

6893
02:57:03,911 --> 02:57:04,744
he's in trouble now.

6894
02:57:05,260 --> 02:57:06,031
He's flat footed.

6895
02:57:06,031 --> 02:57:06,860
Yeah.

6896
02:57:06,860 --> 02:57:07,970
What are ways to be a little bit trouble?

6897
02:57:07,971 --> 02:57:09,060
It's what till lives where?

6898
02:57:10,270 --> 02:57:11,103
Okay.

6899
02:57:17,250 --> 02:57:17,731
Damn.

6900
02:57:17,731 --> 02:57:18,840
Wonderboy would went to

6901
02:57:20,400 --> 02:57:22,200
till just out of range for it to hurt.

6902
02:57:25,810 --> 02:57:26,621
This got interesting.

6903
02:57:26,621 --> 02:57:27,260
That's for sure.

6904
02:57:27,260 --> 02:57:27,970
Proud man.

6905
02:57:27,970 --> 02:57:29,020
Everyone's on their feet now,

6906
02:57:29,680 --> 02:57:32,500
but this is like wonder boy when
he fought Tyron Woodley to right,

6907
02:57:32,501 --> 02:57:33,191
got tagged,

6908
02:57:33,191 --> 02:57:35,380
got hurt and then people
rushing get dealt with.

6909
02:57:36,460 --> 02:57:39,520
Look at this Wonderboy
with a fucking take down.

6910
02:57:40,390 --> 02:57:41,223
Awesome.

6911
02:57:41,660 --> 02:57:42,290
No Shit.

6912
02:57:42,290 --> 02:57:43,020
No Shit.

6913
02:57:43,020 --> 02:57:45,170
Anything exciting when someone shoot
for a take down or these stills?

6914
02:57:45,180 --> 02:57:46,013
Yeah.

6915
02:57:46,550 --> 02:57:47,280
Oh,

6916
02:57:47,280 --> 02:57:48,170
straight left

6917
02:57:51,800 --> 02:57:53,300
Wonderboy still dangerous.

6918
02:57:53,301 --> 02:57:54,134
Crazy.

6919
02:57:59,820 --> 02:58:00,930
40 seconds.

6920
02:58:01,170 --> 02:58:02,130
Boys who tell just thinks

6921
02:58:02,130 --> 02:58:02,970
he has in the bag.

6922
02:58:03,240 --> 02:58:03,841
I don't think so.

6923
02:58:03,841 --> 02:58:05,850
I just think he doesn't want
to get tagged coming in.

6924
02:58:07,140 --> 02:58:08,010
He's a little tired too.

6925
02:58:08,011 --> 02:58:08,844
Mouth's open.

6926
02:58:13,870 --> 02:58:15,140
Hasn't been a high pace.

6927
02:58:15,141 --> 02:58:16,360
There's been a lot of foot work though,

6928
02:58:16,361 --> 02:58:17,194
so you might be a little,

6929
02:58:17,610 --> 02:58:17,741
well,

6930
02:58:17,741 --> 02:58:18,260
you got to rent.

6931
02:58:18,260 --> 02:58:21,760
Remember till did have a real hard time
cutting that weight and he's been going

6932
02:58:21,761 --> 02:58:22,211
through a lot.

6933
02:58:22,211 --> 02:58:23,044
You're right.

6934
02:58:24,850 --> 02:58:26,450
They need some get downs in it.

6935
02:58:26,790 --> 02:58:27,623
You Ain't,

6936
02:58:29,230 --> 02:58:30,063
you ain't lying.

6937
02:58:30,130 --> 02:58:30,911
No standups.

6938
02:58:30,911 --> 02:58:31,744
Just get down.

6939
02:58:32,530 --> 02:58:33,363
Get down.

6940
02:58:37,940 --> 02:58:38,061
Yeah.

6941
02:58:38,061 --> 02:58:40,190
There's no way can give one
a boy the flat after that.

6942
02:58:41,170 --> 02:58:42,350
It'd be hard pressed,

6943
02:58:42,680 --> 02:58:43,513
especially in Liverpool,

6944
02:58:44,130 --> 02:58:46,640
man until one of boys
in a tough spot though.

6945
02:58:48,710 --> 02:58:50,390
I don't know why he's
that happy about that.

6946
02:58:50,391 --> 02:58:51,224
That was um,

6947
02:58:51,410 --> 02:58:53,030
I mean he landed a good shot.

6948
02:58:53,060 --> 02:58:54,050
I guess he was trying,

6949
02:58:54,080 --> 02:58:55,370
it wasn't like he wasn't trying.

6950
02:58:55,400 --> 02:58:56,090
Yeah,

6951
02:58:56,090 --> 02:58:57,590
he was sort of unfolded.

6952
02:58:57,591 --> 02:59:00,710
Where would you rank till after that
lackluster performance cause he,

6953
02:59:00,740 --> 02:59:01,730
cause Wonderboy is number one.

6954
02:59:01,731 --> 02:59:03,110
You'll make him number one obviously.

6955
02:59:03,290 --> 02:59:04,220
I think you put them in the top.

6956
02:59:04,710 --> 02:59:06,920
Water is just a nightmare for everybody.

6957
02:59:07,340 --> 02:59:08,900
He's a nightmare for everybody.

6958
02:59:10,010 --> 02:59:10,580
Yeah.

6959
02:59:10,580 --> 02:59:12,160
Just it's tough to look good against him.

6960
02:59:12,240 --> 02:59:14,410
A win over him as a win.

6961
02:59:14,620 --> 02:59:17,030
You know he beat that number one.

6962
02:59:17,300 --> 02:59:19,550
Well he didn't even make
the weight so that's,

6963
02:59:19,551 --> 02:59:22,370
that's where it gets tricky because
no one gives a fuck about that.

6964
02:59:22,400 --> 02:59:22,640
Right,

6965
02:59:22,640 --> 02:59:24,500
but you're saying that they fought here.

6966
02:59:24,560 --> 02:59:26,750
Here's that front leg side
kick that wobbled his knee.

6967
02:59:27,170 --> 02:59:27,651
Good job.

6968
02:59:27,651 --> 02:59:28,371
Metro pcs.

6969
02:59:28,371 --> 02:59:29,300
A blocking the vision.

6970
02:59:29,330 --> 02:59:30,440
God Damn it.

6971
02:59:30,441 --> 02:59:31,101
Metro PC.

6972
02:59:31,101 --> 02:59:31,934
Why would they do that?

6973
02:59:31,970 --> 02:59:33,800
Why would they have that
right where you need to see,

6974
02:59:34,010 --> 02:59:34,730
I'll tell you right now,

6975
02:59:34,730 --> 02:59:35,301
if you're my friend,

6976
02:59:35,301 --> 02:59:36,290
you have metro pcs.

6977
02:59:36,291 --> 02:59:37,400
We are not friends anymore.

6978
02:59:37,630 --> 02:59:38,330
Knocked down,

6979
02:59:38,330 --> 02:59:38,990
knocked down.

6980
02:59:38,990 --> 02:59:39,701
Do you get angry with?

6981
02:59:39,701 --> 02:59:40,534
Just because of that?

6982
02:59:40,700 --> 02:59:41,031
Well,

6983
02:59:41,031 --> 02:59:41,301
no,

6984
02:59:41,301 --> 02:59:45,440
I get angry because the cricket of
wireless cell phones now cricket.

6985
02:59:45,890 --> 02:59:47,420
Oh Shit.

6986
02:59:47,421 --> 02:59:48,960
Hard fucking left hand.

6987
02:59:50,120 --> 02:59:50,953
Boom.

6988
02:59:50,960 --> 02:59:51,690
Right by.

6989
02:59:51,690 --> 02:59:52,523
That was legit.

6990
02:59:53,260 --> 02:59:54,440
He clobbered him right there.

6991
02:59:54,720 --> 02:59:55,451
Right behind the air.

6992
02:59:55,451 --> 02:59:55,970
Huh?

6993
02:59:55,970 --> 02:59:58,270
That was as legit as it gets done.

6994
02:59:58,330 --> 03:00:00,630
Most of that was the
legit shot of the phone,

6995
03:00:00,730 --> 03:00:02,030
like one legit shot.

6996
03:00:02,720 --> 03:00:05,660
That's why like if you have
49 other strikes at land,

6997
03:00:05,690 --> 03:00:06,620
do they even count?

6998
03:00:07,160 --> 03:00:07,820
I mean that.

6999
03:00:07,820 --> 03:00:08,511
That's a real,

7000
03:00:08,511 --> 03:00:09,344
strike that.

7001
03:00:09,590 --> 03:00:11,770
Do you ever use the word clobber when,

7002
03:00:12,050 --> 03:00:13,190
when you're calling fights?

7003
03:00:13,640 --> 03:00:14,473
I don't call fights.

7004
03:00:14,600 --> 03:00:15,240
Cooperates.

7005
03:00:15,240 --> 03:00:16,430
Claude was nine my addiction.

7006
03:00:16,470 --> 03:00:19,340
No cow bomber to old school collaborating.

7007
03:00:19,341 --> 03:00:21,930
Clobbered him clobbering collapses.

7008
03:00:23,660 --> 03:00:24,590
The thing says that,

7009
03:00:24,591 --> 03:00:24,920
right?

7010
03:00:24,920 --> 03:00:25,281
Yeah.

7011
03:00:25,281 --> 03:00:30,281
If the thing called tastic
for clobbering time guy,

7012
03:00:31,600 --> 03:00:32,261
I need to bring that up.

7013
03:00:32,261 --> 03:00:33,380
So what do we think here?

7014
03:00:33,590 --> 03:00:37,970
What do you think you think until all
hundred percent for one till around stone

7015
03:00:38,090 --> 03:00:38,940
close decision.

7016
03:00:39,020 --> 03:00:40,760
I think til split.

7017
03:00:40,761 --> 03:00:42,820
Someone's going to give
it to Wonderboy tills.

7018
03:00:42,930 --> 03:00:43,763
Some rebel,

7019
03:00:43,970 --> 03:00:45,860
some revenue wants to die in Liverpool.

7020
03:00:45,890 --> 03:00:48,030
I want to get going on Michelle.

7021
03:00:48,050 --> 03:00:50,150
They place that will they
set that place on fire?

7022
03:00:50,151 --> 03:00:51,220
If they do give to Wonderboy,

7023
03:00:53,070 --> 03:00:55,120
the report card and the paint,

7024
03:00:55,260 --> 03:00:58,460
you know there's some hooligans
then it's going to be a tough,

7025
03:00:59,020 --> 03:01:00,320
it's going to be a tough exit

7026
03:01:00,330 --> 03:01:01,163
strategy.

7027
03:01:02,200 --> 03:01:03,033
Is that a Dell,

7028
03:01:03,520 --> 03:01:04,061
Dell Bird?

7029
03:01:04,061 --> 03:01:08,470
Where the fuck her name is she
Adelaide birds fly her out there.

7030
03:01:08,500 --> 03:01:09,300
You never know.

7031
03:01:09,300 --> 03:01:10,410
See it everywhere fucker.

7032
03:01:10,450 --> 03:01:11,650
Does she go everywhere?

7033
03:01:11,900 --> 03:01:13,870
She like gives lessons
on judging and stuff.

7034
03:01:14,920 --> 03:01:17,680
You don't think they put
her in there for a reason?

7035
03:01:17,860 --> 03:01:18,101
You know,

7036
03:01:18,101 --> 03:01:19,090
cause she don't give a fuck.

7037
03:01:19,091 --> 03:01:20,290
So you can to do it on purpose.

7038
03:01:20,530 --> 03:01:21,920
I think they,

7039
03:01:22,360 --> 03:01:24,170
they want controversy.

7040
03:01:24,171 --> 03:01:26,590
Do you want people to get
used to fucked up decisions?

7041
03:01:26,700 --> 03:01:28,080
What we're used to it that's,

7042
03:01:28,380 --> 03:01:29,213
yeah,

7043
03:01:29,590 --> 03:01:30,170
yeah,

7044
03:01:30,170 --> 03:01:30,460
yeah.

7045
03:01:30,460 --> 03:01:30,871
I think they,

7046
03:01:30,871 --> 03:01:34,210
they want that because if they
ever needed to pull something out,

7047
03:01:34,211 --> 03:01:35,050
like something was like,

7048
03:01:35,051 --> 03:01:35,260
dude,

7049
03:01:35,260 --> 03:01:36,370
this motherfucker has to win.

7050
03:01:37,130 --> 03:01:37,391
You know?

7051
03:01:37,391 --> 03:01:37,870
People are like,

7052
03:01:37,870 --> 03:01:38,950
oh it is Vegas.

7053
03:01:39,090 --> 03:01:39,591
Vegas,

7054
03:01:39,591 --> 03:01:42,110
Seattle boxing's crept as shit.

7055
03:01:42,111 --> 03:01:44,470
But with MMA I just think they
don't know what they're looking at.

7056
03:01:44,500 --> 03:01:46,150
They don't understand
they're not the west.

7057
03:01:46,180 --> 03:01:46,511
Correct.

7058
03:01:46,511 --> 03:01:47,760
They just don't know either way.

7059
03:01:48,760 --> 03:01:48,940
Oh,

7060
03:01:48,940 --> 03:01:49,630
here we go.

7061
03:01:49,630 --> 03:01:50,410
Here we go.

7062
03:01:50,410 --> 03:01:50,711
Jamie,

7063
03:01:50,711 --> 03:01:51,580
can you give us some volume

7064
03:01:53,530 --> 03:01:55,780
here we split up or be a killer

7065
03:01:56,870 --> 03:02:00,590
strip club Dj 46 and 49

7066
03:02:00,980 --> 03:02:01,450
boom.

7067
03:02:01,450 --> 03:02:02,283
Unanimous.

7068
03:02:02,400 --> 03:02:02,750
Oh,

7069
03:02:02,750 --> 03:02:03,583
you're

7070
03:02:06,480 --> 03:02:07,410
holy shit.

7071
03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:08,753
Wow.

7072
03:02:11,200 --> 03:02:12,730
Well he didn't even
need that knocked down.

7073
03:02:13,030 --> 03:02:14,050
That's a big fight for him.

7074
03:02:14,680 --> 03:02:15,670
What were some of those scores?

7075
03:02:15,671 --> 03:02:16,300
I can hear it.

7076
03:02:16,300 --> 03:02:21,300
(494) 074-0840 seven or
494649464847 well that's,

7077
03:02:25,090 --> 03:02:26,230
that's a big victory for him,

7078
03:02:26,231 --> 03:02:27,130
that's for sure.

7079
03:02:30,370 --> 03:02:31,750
He pointed Wonderboy.

7080
03:02:32,120 --> 03:02:33,420
These people they can up for you.

7081
03:02:34,110 --> 03:02:35,760
What does it feel like you're on your way?

7082
03:02:35,761 --> 03:02:36,594
Call it.

7083
03:02:37,530 --> 03:02:38,363
Hmm?

7084
03:02:39,640 --> 03:02:40,990
I think you said something bad.

7085
03:02:41,430 --> 03:02:43,000
I think you some potty language there.

7086
03:02:43,210 --> 03:02:44,043
What do you think?

7087
03:02:44,410 --> 03:02:45,150
I mean,

7088
03:02:45,150 --> 03:02:45,340
sorry,

7089
03:02:45,340 --> 03:02:46,330
strategic point.

7090
03:02:46,331 --> 03:02:47,770
Did you expect it to go the distance?

7091
03:02:47,771 --> 03:02:49,310
Did you think it was gonna
be like the whole winter?

7092
03:02:50,270 --> 03:02:51,103
I play games.

7093
03:02:51,860 --> 03:02:52,550
I don't speak it.

7094
03:02:52,550 --> 03:02:53,920
[inaudible] guys to flights up high on

7095
03:02:54,280 --> 03:02:58,690
the classified to have such
a specific way of talking.

7096
03:02:59,790 --> 03:03:02,740
I feel like it's so much cooler when
they talk like this is a fighter.

7097
03:03:02,800 --> 03:03:03,320
Yeah.

7098
03:03:03,320 --> 03:03:03,680
Well everybody,

7099
03:03:03,680 --> 03:03:04,520
that was pretty cool.

7100
03:03:04,940 --> 03:03:06,250
I bought book.

7101
03:03:07,790 --> 03:03:08,780
I'm going to show him that

7102
03:03:13,610 --> 03:03:16,890
be 40 so I was 13

7103
03:03:21,670 --> 03:03:22,270
can you hear me?

7104
03:03:22,270 --> 03:03:23,150
Shots in the morning.

7105
03:03:24,660 --> 03:03:25,680
Maybe it's the

7106
03:03:26,450 --> 03:03:27,290
not really.

7107
03:03:27,320 --> 03:03:27,740
Really?

7108
03:03:27,740 --> 03:03:28,780
I'd have to him yet.

7109
03:03:28,820 --> 03:03:29,653
Yeah.

7110
03:03:29,740 --> 03:03:30,573
Yes.

7111
03:03:33,120 --> 03:03:33,953
What is he saying?

7112
03:03:34,680 --> 03:03:35,513
What?

7113
03:03:35,520 --> 03:03:36,630
What are they saying?

7114
03:03:38,230 --> 03:03:39,063
Boy?

7115
03:03:39,070 --> 03:03:40,210
Fucking censorship.

7116
03:03:41,530 --> 03:03:41,741
Yeah.

7117
03:03:41,741 --> 03:03:41,951
Well,

7118
03:03:41,951 --> 03:03:42,400
let me,

7119
03:03:42,400 --> 03:03:43,640
let me hear the Bjorks neck.

7120
03:03:44,410 --> 03:03:44,790
Yeah.

7121
03:03:44,790 --> 03:03:45,601
Said everyone.

7122
03:03:45,601 --> 03:03:46,021
Anyone?

7123
03:03:46,021 --> 03:03:46,854
I don't care.

7124
03:03:52,030 --> 03:03:52,250
Yeah.

7125
03:03:52,250 --> 03:03:53,180
People asking me.

7126
03:03:53,800 --> 03:03:54,633
You might design the time.

7127
03:03:54,680 --> 03:03:55,513
She'll talk to me.

7128
03:03:56,650 --> 03:03:57,350
Okay.

7129
03:03:57,350 --> 03:03:58,130
God Damn

7130
03:03:58,130 --> 03:03:59,480
with the censorship.

7131
03:04:00,240 --> 03:04:01,073
Yeah.

7132
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:02,433
Espn,

7133
03:04:02,530 --> 03:04:04,630
please let these guys swear.

7134
03:04:04,690 --> 03:04:05,523
Please.

7135
03:04:05,940 --> 03:04:06,640
Come on.

7136
03:04:06,640 --> 03:04:07,241
They're not going to let it.

7137
03:04:07,241 --> 03:04:07,680
No Way.

7138
03:04:07,680 --> 03:04:09,580
He's going to be worse and he owns ESPN.

7139
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:10,720
That's true.

7140
03:04:10,720 --> 03:04:11,553
Good call.

7141
03:04:12,200 --> 03:04:14,530
They might not even let me
do commentary over there.

7142
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:16,660
Have you guys seen Solo hockey about that?

7143
03:04:16,690 --> 03:04:17,700
You out doesn't,

7144
03:04:17,701 --> 03:04:18,720
he took over Star Wars,

7145
03:04:18,721 --> 03:04:19,480
right?

7146
03:04:19,480 --> 03:04:20,100
Yeah.

7147
03:04:20,100 --> 03:04:21,030
They be solo.

7148
03:04:21,070 --> 03:04:21,610
No,

7149
03:04:21,610 --> 03:04:21,821
dude,

7150
03:04:21,821 --> 03:04:24,850
I lasted literally six
minutes and I walked out.

7151
03:04:25,940 --> 03:04:26,410
Yes.

7152
03:04:26,410 --> 03:04:26,651
No,

7153
03:04:26,651 --> 03:04:27,080
six,

7154
03:04:27,080 --> 03:04:27,361
nine.

7155
03:04:27,361 --> 03:04:28,380
It's give it a shot.

7156
03:04:28,450 --> 03:04:28,571
No.

7157
03:04:28,571 --> 03:04:29,021
The reason,

7158
03:04:29,021 --> 03:04:29,950
the reason why I walked down,

7159
03:04:29,951 --> 03:04:34,170
I realize what it is about star
wars lovers in the chase scenes.

7160
03:04:34,300 --> 03:04:34,560
They,

7161
03:04:34,560 --> 03:04:36,290
they use the classic Star Wars,

7162
03:04:36,310 --> 03:04:37,210
Star Wars movies.

7163
03:04:37,660 --> 03:04:38,310
Music.

7164
03:04:38,310 --> 03:04:38,770
Yeah.

7165
03:04:38,770 --> 03:04:40,360
Like that music is just so,

7166
03:04:40,630 --> 03:04:43,690
Indiana Jones can't be corny.

7167
03:04:43,710 --> 03:04:44,170
Right.

7168
03:04:44,170 --> 03:04:45,070
I couldn't stand it,

7169
03:04:45,071 --> 03:04:45,490
man.

7170
03:04:45,490 --> 03:04:46,040
I couldn't.

7171
03:04:46,040 --> 03:04:47,830
I was the fucker and I was ready.

7172
03:04:47,831 --> 03:04:48,011
Dude.

7173
03:04:48,011 --> 03:04:48,950
I had fucking candy.

7174
03:04:48,970 --> 03:04:49,803
You see,

7175
03:04:50,440 --> 03:04:51,970
I was ready.

7176
03:04:52,900 --> 03:04:56,100
I had one of those of those
chicken baguettes with a barbecue.

7177
03:04:56,101 --> 03:04:57,580
Watermelon sauce.

7178
03:04:57,880 --> 03:04:58,661
Barbecue.

7179
03:04:58,661 --> 03:05:01,600
Watermelon sauce on you still walked.

7180
03:05:01,940 --> 03:05:02,890
As soon as I was done,

7181
03:05:02,950 --> 03:05:03,810
I killed it before then.

7182
03:05:03,940 --> 03:05:07,840
I was done with that before the movie
even started that the chicken watermelon

7183
03:05:07,850 --> 03:05:10,060
barge to go by myself.

7184
03:05:10,450 --> 03:05:11,283
You went to see

7185
03:05:12,620 --> 03:05:13,453
wow.

7186
03:05:13,690 --> 03:05:15,220
At The arc light in Sherman oaks.

7187
03:05:15,370 --> 03:05:16,040
Really?

7188
03:05:16,040 --> 03:05:18,020
You showed up for yourself?

7189
03:05:18,470 --> 03:05:19,120
My,

7190
03:05:19,120 --> 03:05:19,290
uh,

7191
03:05:19,290 --> 03:05:21,700
my wife took my son to some,

7192
03:05:21,790 --> 03:05:21,941
uh,

7193
03:05:21,941 --> 03:05:25,560
birthday party thing and they were
going to be gone for a couple of hours.

7194
03:05:25,600 --> 03:05:26,201
You might have said,

7195
03:05:26,201 --> 03:05:27,190
you know what I'm going to go to.

7196
03:05:27,191 --> 03:05:27,491
I like,

7197
03:05:27,491 --> 03:05:29,800
I like that the idea of going to movies,

7198
03:05:29,830 --> 03:05:31,210
it's just that they all suck.

7199
03:05:31,600 --> 03:05:32,560
But I like going,

7200
03:05:32,561 --> 03:05:33,160
I like,

7201
03:05:33,160 --> 03:05:35,320
I like buying some candy or solo though.

7202
03:05:35,590 --> 03:05:36,423
It doesn't matter.

7203
03:05:36,670 --> 03:05:38,980
I go by myself all the time.

7204
03:05:39,490 --> 03:05:40,061
I did.

7205
03:05:40,061 --> 03:05:40,894
I did not,

7206
03:05:40,930 --> 03:05:42,460
not so much since I had a kid,

7207
03:05:42,790 --> 03:05:44,830
but back in the day I would
go all the time by myself.

7208
03:05:44,860 --> 03:05:47,140
I think I've only been maybe three times,

7209
03:05:48,040 --> 03:05:50,200
not even in my life by myself.

7210
03:05:50,230 --> 03:05:53,860
I saw a these on robots only because I
want to be able to leave if I go with

7211
03:05:53,861 --> 03:05:57,330
someone else and I got a fucking state
cause nobody likes to talk to him.

7212
03:05:57,340 --> 03:05:58,360
And I like no.

7213
03:05:58,361 --> 03:05:59,530
Most people don't like leaving.

7214
03:05:59,860 --> 03:06:00,670
Most people they get,

7215
03:06:00,670 --> 03:06:03,250
so I got to fucking sit there
for the whole stupid movie.

7216
03:06:03,590 --> 03:06:04,610
So how I like minutes.

7217
03:06:04,660 --> 03:06:05,210
I liked it.

7218
03:06:05,210 --> 03:06:07,360
I liked the freedom to
leave cause I won't,

7219
03:06:07,630 --> 03:06:07,931
I want,

7220
03:06:07,931 --> 03:06:09,610
as soon as I don't give
a shit about the movie,

7221
03:06:09,611 --> 03:06:10,000
I'm out.

7222
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:11,710
I or Deadpool two is amazing.

7223
03:06:11,740 --> 03:06:12,311
That was good.

7224
03:06:12,311 --> 03:06:12,911
I stayed for that.

7225
03:06:12,911 --> 03:06:14,020
I saw that by myself too.

7226
03:06:14,370 --> 03:06:15,160
That was good.

7227
03:06:15,160 --> 03:06:15,580
Yeah.

7228
03:06:15,580 --> 03:06:16,440
Deadpool to the school.

7229
03:06:16,450 --> 03:06:17,440
She moved by herself.

7230
03:06:17,480 --> 03:06:18,070
I don't know.

7231
03:06:18,070 --> 03:06:18,903
I really,

7232
03:06:18,970 --> 03:06:19,241
yeah,

7233
03:06:19,241 --> 03:06:19,860
I've never,

7234
03:06:19,860 --> 03:06:20,890
I I just need to,

7235
03:06:20,900 --> 03:06:22,300
I just need the freedom to leave.

7236
03:06:22,310 --> 03:06:23,860
That's really what that's about.

7237
03:06:24,200 --> 03:06:25,033
Hmm.

7238
03:06:26,350 --> 03:06:26,501
Dude.

7239
03:06:26,501 --> 03:06:29,050
That welterweight division
is pure fire right now.

7240
03:06:29,890 --> 03:06:30,161
Yeah,

7241
03:06:30,161 --> 03:06:30,701
no kidding.

7242
03:06:30,701 --> 03:06:31,030
Right.

7243
03:06:31,030 --> 03:06:32,320
Pure fucking fire.

7244
03:06:33,340 --> 03:06:35,770
I think at all the young
guys out of Colby Covington,

7245
03:06:36,490 --> 03:06:37,600
Uzman and then,

7246
03:06:37,601 --> 03:06:37,780
uh,

7247
03:06:37,780 --> 03:06:38,351
Darren till,

7248
03:06:38,351 --> 03:06:40,580
till if I had to bet on
one of them being like the,

7249
03:06:40,660 --> 03:06:42,520
the world champion be till you think so.

7250
03:06:42,580 --> 03:06:43,060
Yeah.

7251
03:06:43,060 --> 03:06:43,690
Out of all those,

7252
03:06:43,690 --> 03:06:43,871
the,

7253
03:06:43,871 --> 03:06:44,680
those three guys,

7254
03:06:44,680 --> 03:06:45,660
dangerous motherfucker,

7255
03:06:45,670 --> 03:06:46,420
that's for sure.

7256
03:06:46,420 --> 03:06:47,710
If you trade them with that guy,

7257
03:06:47,740 --> 03:06:48,010
I mean,

7258
03:06:48,010 --> 03:06:50,980
w the thing that wonder boy did that
was so interesting is he's just never

7259
03:06:50,981 --> 03:06:51,640
there.

7260
03:06:51,640 --> 03:06:52,540
He's just never there.

7261
03:06:52,541 --> 03:06:52,870
And it,

7262
03:06:52,870 --> 03:06:54,970
it made it a hard fight for,

7263
03:06:55,170 --> 03:06:56,130
to keep his composure

7264
03:06:56,130 --> 03:07:00,330
and fight five hard rounds and constantly
be chasing them and wonder boys never

7265
03:07:00,331 --> 03:07:02,070
there and wonder what
tagged him a couple times,

7266
03:07:02,071 --> 03:07:04,320
but til I was the one that
landed the big haymaker.

7267
03:07:04,350 --> 03:07:08,160
But you also see till under
control experience still stuck.

7268
03:07:08,161 --> 03:07:10,080
This technique is to be tough to beat man.

7269
03:07:10,570 --> 03:07:13,310
Now I'd like to see him against a
guy who has high level wrestling,

7270
03:07:13,311 --> 03:07:16,670
like a Colby come dinner Woodlea or uh,

7271
03:07:16,700 --> 03:07:17,410
even who you know,

7272
03:07:17,410 --> 03:07:20,310
who's been super high level restaurant
and you see that where it's not an ideal

7273
03:07:20,311 --> 03:07:20,971
match up for him.

7274
03:07:20,971 --> 03:07:24,480
See how he performs cause cowboy
and Wonderboy are there striker.

7275
03:07:24,481 --> 03:07:25,950
So it's [inaudible] wheelhouse.

7276
03:07:25,980 --> 03:07:26,280
Yup.

7277
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:27,240
Let me see your Rda.

7278
03:07:27,270 --> 03:07:28,700
Bluesmen or Colby counted.

7279
03:07:28,770 --> 03:07:28,981
Yeah,

7280
03:07:28,981 --> 03:07:30,540
I would like to see him versus cope.

7281
03:07:30,650 --> 03:07:32,230
I think [inaudible] fine.

7282
03:07:33,030 --> 03:07:33,631
That's a good question.

7283
03:07:33,631 --> 03:07:35,040
Purple because a purple thing.

7284
03:07:35,070 --> 03:07:35,831
I'm pretty sure he's a purple.

7285
03:07:35,831 --> 03:07:36,720
He's been doing it for awhile.

7286
03:07:37,290 --> 03:07:38,123
Um,

7287
03:07:38,310 --> 03:07:39,210
but uh,

7288
03:07:39,240 --> 03:07:40,800
see I don't think you do Coby rich day.

7289
03:07:40,810 --> 03:07:42,600
I don't think you could kill
off the young lions yet.

7290
03:07:42,750 --> 03:07:45,150
I think you could let the young
lions go after the Robbie Lawler's,

7291
03:07:45,360 --> 03:07:46,260
the cowboys,

7292
03:07:46,290 --> 03:07:47,250
the RDAs.

7293
03:07:47,640 --> 03:07:48,360
We'll do it that way.

7294
03:07:48,360 --> 03:07:50,910
Did they think that way or do they just
try and make the best fights that can do

7295
03:07:50,920 --> 03:07:51,753
UFC?

7296
03:07:52,140 --> 03:07:52,970
There's no,

7297
03:07:52,970 --> 03:07:54,230
oh just what do you like?

7298
03:07:54,250 --> 03:07:54,710
You know,

7299
03:07:54,710 --> 03:07:56,550
I think it's just whatever the fuck works.

7300
03:07:56,730 --> 03:07:58,560
Cause this fight doesn't make
too much sense for wonder boy.

7301
03:07:59,100 --> 03:07:59,790
Right.

7302
03:07:59,790 --> 03:08:01,440
But as a fun fight for us to watch.

7303
03:08:01,460 --> 03:08:02,010
Yeah,

7304
03:08:02,010 --> 03:08:02,491
very fun.

7305
03:08:02,491 --> 03:08:03,324
Fight to watch,

7306
03:08:03,660 --> 03:08:03,970
man.

7307
03:08:03,970 --> 03:08:04,930
There's a clubbing punch.

7308
03:08:05,060 --> 03:08:05,893
Boom.

7309
03:08:05,910 --> 03:08:06,510
Yeah,

7310
03:08:06,510 --> 03:08:07,343
a lot of power.

7311
03:08:07,500 --> 03:08:07,681
Yeah.

7312
03:08:07,681 --> 03:08:09,450
He's got a power and he's a big fella.

7313
03:08:09,960 --> 03:08:10,681
I mean if he,

7314
03:08:10,681 --> 03:08:15,480
if they wanted him to have to weigh
188 they know that he's probably,

7315
03:08:15,481 --> 03:08:16,314
well,

7316
03:08:16,390 --> 03:08:19,440
well north of that I'd
probably come in and,

7317
03:08:19,441 --> 03:08:19,651
well,

7318
03:08:19,651 --> 03:08:21,820
north of 200 c but missing the weight.

7319
03:08:22,060 --> 03:08:23,790
We don't make a big enough deal of it.

7320
03:08:23,791 --> 03:08:24,390
I don't give a F.

7321
03:08:24,390 --> 03:08:25,680
I don't really care either.

7322
03:08:25,681 --> 03:08:27,290
But it is a problem in,

7323
03:08:27,330 --> 03:08:28,260
it's a huge problem.

7324
03:08:28,261 --> 03:08:29,490
It's such an advantage.

7325
03:08:29,491 --> 03:08:31,190
But like with Mackenzie dern,

7326
03:08:31,200 --> 03:08:31,860
after she missed it,

7327
03:08:31,860 --> 03:08:32,401
I didn't care.

7328
03:08:32,401 --> 03:08:32,641
I'm like,

7329
03:08:32,641 --> 03:08:32,821
all right,

7330
03:08:32,821 --> 03:08:33,441
do your thing girl.

7331
03:08:33,441 --> 03:08:36,540
And she missed it by seven fucking pounds.

7332
03:08:36,541 --> 03:08:36,751
Man,

7333
03:08:36,751 --> 03:08:37,800
that's so big.

7334
03:08:37,830 --> 03:08:39,120
That means it doesn't drain her.

7335
03:08:39,400 --> 03:08:40,233
So when she goes,

7336
03:08:40,280 --> 03:08:41,460
that's a huge advantage.

7337
03:08:41,670 --> 03:08:42,451
She goes to fight.

7338
03:08:42,451 --> 03:08:43,860
She's not drained out huge.

7339
03:08:44,170 --> 03:08:45,840
That Mackenzie dern fight.

7340
03:08:45,870 --> 03:08:46,591
Holy Shit.

7341
03:08:46,591 --> 03:08:48,810
That was like some UFC two type shit.

7342
03:08:49,050 --> 03:08:50,940
She took that check down mountain.

7343
03:08:50,941 --> 03:08:52,150
Her soccer.

7344
03:08:52,610 --> 03:08:52,860
No,

7345
03:08:52,860 --> 03:08:53,693
she knows that.

7346
03:08:53,740 --> 03:08:54,361
It was like that.

7347
03:08:54,361 --> 03:08:56,190
It was like a hoist versus uh,

7348
03:08:56,580 --> 03:08:57,300
that uh,

7349
03:08:57,300 --> 03:09:01,320
that Dutch kickboxer with the
g pants when she got a crap.

7350
03:09:01,560 --> 03:09:05,400
But her striking was the impressive
thing cause she landed a bunch over hand.

7351
03:09:06,060 --> 03:09:06,893
She does that.

7352
03:09:07,260 --> 03:09:08,130
She has big,

7353
03:09:08,170 --> 03:09:10,800
she's not afraid to throw
down Mackenzie fan man.

7354
03:09:10,970 --> 03:09:12,300
She's got giant balls.

7355
03:09:12,301 --> 03:09:13,840
Her ground game is so high.

7356
03:09:14,370 --> 03:09:15,610
She will scrape through that.

7357
03:09:15,720 --> 03:09:17,160
It looked like that chick never trained.

7358
03:09:17,250 --> 03:09:17,641
She looked,

7359
03:09:17,641 --> 03:09:19,410
she looked too thick though that fight.

7360
03:09:19,440 --> 03:09:20,280
She didn't like it.

7361
03:09:21,010 --> 03:09:23,190
I like thick but then
there's like damn girl,

7362
03:09:23,191 --> 03:09:23,620
you need a,

7363
03:09:23,620 --> 03:09:24,840
we need a little pride here.

7364
03:09:24,960 --> 03:09:26,940
She said to her the way she's dressed,

7365
03:09:27,070 --> 03:09:29,370
if she was in a miniskirt
with a halter top,

7366
03:09:29,371 --> 03:09:30,870
don't get a twist and I'm on board,

7367
03:09:30,871 --> 03:09:31,650
whatever just went,

7368
03:09:31,650 --> 03:09:34,220
I'm just saying that like the love
handles are spilling over the top.

7369
03:09:34,260 --> 03:09:37,140
Like all right now it gets
a little thick sometimes.

7370
03:09:37,141 --> 03:09:37,974
I like that.

7371
03:09:38,250 --> 03:09:40,640
I'm not mad at it but
it just looks better.

7372
03:09:41,250 --> 03:09:43,350
It's all depends on how much
ask goes with the package.

7373
03:09:43,860 --> 03:09:44,660
You're right.

7374
03:09:44,660 --> 03:09:45,150
The front,

7375
03:09:45,150 --> 03:09:46,360
the front to back ratio.

7376
03:09:46,710 --> 03:09:47,543
It depends.

7377
03:09:47,970 --> 03:09:48,360
See this,

7378
03:09:48,360 --> 03:09:49,170
why,

7379
03:09:49,170 --> 03:09:53,070
this is why we can't be
on ESPN or Fox fire me.

7380
03:09:53,200 --> 03:09:53,640
Good.

7381
03:09:53,640 --> 03:09:54,473
Yeah.

7382
03:09:55,580 --> 03:09:58,840
Well it's not even saying they just
make me just do the paper views.

7383
03:09:58,841 --> 03:09:59,674
I'm fine with that.

7384
03:09:59,860 --> 03:10:00,430
That's all you do,

7385
03:10:00,430 --> 03:10:00,700
you know?

7386
03:10:00,700 --> 03:10:01,190
Oh wait,

7387
03:10:01,190 --> 03:10:01,800
no,

7388
03:10:01,800 --> 03:10:04,150
I do the previous to the prelims.

7389
03:10:05,090 --> 03:10:06,090
Uh,

7390
03:10:06,300 --> 03:10:09,670
well I want to have Latino cause well I
guess it would just the contract comes

7391
03:10:09,671 --> 03:10:11,770
over like does everyone
like the UFC tonight?

7392
03:10:11,771 --> 03:10:11,951
Crew.

7393
03:10:11,951 --> 03:10:12,870
Everyone's everyone like,

7394
03:10:12,871 --> 03:10:13,681
just check this over.

7395
03:10:13,681 --> 03:10:14,230
You have seen,

7396
03:10:14,230 --> 03:10:15,490
I was never working for Fox.

7397
03:10:15,520 --> 03:10:16,510
I didn't do the fire.

7398
03:10:16,540 --> 03:10:17,350
It was one of my,

7399
03:10:17,350 --> 03:10:18,183
one of these days.

7400
03:10:19,240 --> 03:10:21,240
But one of the stipulations
of my newer contract,

7401
03:10:21,241 --> 03:10:22,870
I said I don't want to do
the Fox events anymore.

7402
03:10:22,900 --> 03:10:25,540
And that deals through when you
don't have to say it's already done.

7403
03:10:25,810 --> 03:10:26,351
It's already done.

7404
03:10:26,351 --> 03:10:27,910
I mean it was a bit like this year.

7405
03:10:27,911 --> 03:10:29,380
I don't do any of the Fox events.

7406
03:10:29,381 --> 03:10:29,951
If you notice,

7407
03:10:29,951 --> 03:10:31,650
like when there are big
fights on [inaudible].

7408
03:10:31,670 --> 03:10:32,350
I know you don't do,

7409
03:10:32,350 --> 03:10:33,001
don't do any of them.

7410
03:10:33,001 --> 03:10:34,090
I'm not even done the big ones.

7411
03:10:34,150 --> 03:10:34,540
Nope.

7412
03:10:34,540 --> 03:10:35,140
None of them.

7413
03:10:35,140 --> 03:10:36,370
Zero paper.

7414
03:10:36,371 --> 03:10:37,450
If he's still doing it right.

7415
03:10:37,480 --> 03:10:38,350
Do you want to do anymore?

7416
03:10:38,410 --> 03:10:39,100
Too much work?

7417
03:10:39,100 --> 03:10:39,933
Too much work?

7418
03:10:40,570 --> 03:10:41,220
Um,

7419
03:10:41,220 --> 03:10:43,960
did this suit is not a big deal because
they have the suit there for me,

7420
03:10:43,990 --> 03:10:44,700
but the,

7421
03:10:44,700 --> 03:10:48,190
my issue was a fox actually
paid me less money,

7422
03:10:48,520 --> 03:10:50,200
less money to do the whole fence on Fox.

7423
03:10:50,201 --> 03:10:50,651
But I was like,

7424
03:10:50,651 --> 03:10:51,880
you guys are never paying you.

7425
03:10:52,180 --> 03:10:52,421
Yeah,

7426
03:10:52,421 --> 03:10:53,590
I thought the UFC Pagan,

7427
03:10:53,770 --> 03:10:53,951
no,

7428
03:10:53,951 --> 03:10:54,860
I get to fuck event.

7429
03:10:54,910 --> 03:10:55,743
It's a Fox event.

7430
03:10:56,200 --> 03:10:56,741
So,

7431
03:10:56,741 --> 03:10:57,460
um,

7432
03:10:57,460 --> 03:10:58,120
that,

7433
03:10:58,120 --> 03:10:59,500
but it was also,

7434
03:10:59,860 --> 03:11:02,500
I didn't like when I first
started doing it for them,

7435
03:11:03,160 --> 03:11:06,040
they got in my ear like the
very first events for Fox.

7436
03:11:06,370 --> 03:11:07,780
They were like telling me what to do.

7437
03:11:07,960 --> 03:11:10,570
They were like telling me
to take it down a notch.

7438
03:11:10,570 --> 03:11:12,280
Don't be so amped up about that.

7439
03:11:12,281 --> 03:11:13,180
Yay.

7440
03:11:13,240 --> 03:11:13,871
And I was like,

7441
03:11:13,871 --> 03:11:14,260
what?

7442
03:11:14,260 --> 03:11:15,093
What are we doing here?

7443
03:11:15,100 --> 03:11:15,371
I go,

7444
03:11:15,371 --> 03:11:16,060
listen,

7445
03:11:16,060 --> 03:11:17,200
I do commentary.

7446
03:11:17,230 --> 03:11:17,801
This is what I do.

7447
03:11:17,801 --> 03:11:18,760
I've been doing it forever.

7448
03:11:19,030 --> 03:11:19,870
This is how I do it.

7449
03:11:19,900 --> 03:11:21,850
If you think you can change me,

7450
03:11:22,090 --> 03:11:23,350
then we're not going to work together.

7451
03:11:23,410 --> 03:11:23,950
I'm like,

7452
03:11:23,950 --> 03:11:25,150
what a real problem.

7453
03:11:25,180 --> 03:11:26,500
And that was a faux deduction,

7454
03:11:26,501 --> 03:11:27,160
right Joe?

7455
03:11:27,160 --> 03:11:27,451
Yes.

7456
03:11:27,451 --> 03:11:28,980
It was a fox junior.

7457
03:11:28,981 --> 03:11:29,830
Dos Santos,

7458
03:11:30,010 --> 03:11:30,990
Cain Velasquez.

7459
03:11:31,110 --> 03:11:31,943
That was,

7460
03:11:32,770 --> 03:11:33,010
yeah,

7461
03:11:33,010 --> 03:11:34,120
I believe that was the first one.

7462
03:11:34,180 --> 03:11:34,490
Yeah,

7463
03:11:34,490 --> 03:11:35,323
but it's just,

7464
03:11:36,280 --> 03:11:36,910
I just didn't,

7465
03:11:36,910 --> 03:11:37,730
I didn't like it.

7466
03:11:37,730 --> 03:11:39,580
They want a sports guy like,

7467
03:11:39,730 --> 03:11:40,220
look,

7468
03:11:40,220 --> 03:11:41,890
MMA is what it is.

7469
03:11:41,950 --> 03:11:42,221
It's,

7470
03:11:42,221 --> 03:11:43,054
it's fighting.

7471
03:11:43,100 --> 03:11:47,680
It is a very specific kind of sport
and I've been doing it the way I do it

7472
03:11:47,681 --> 03:11:47,891
forever.

7473
03:11:47,891 --> 03:11:49,120
If you don't like the way I do it,

7474
03:11:49,121 --> 03:11:49,661
that's fine.

7475
03:11:49,661 --> 03:11:50,494
Don't hire me,

7476
03:11:50,560 --> 03:11:53,680
but don't try to get me
to become some sports guy.

7477
03:11:53,681 --> 03:11:55,120
I'm not interested in that at all.

7478
03:11:55,150 --> 03:11:56,380
When I commentated for pride,

7479
03:11:56,381 --> 03:11:56,801
they told me,

7480
03:11:56,801 --> 03:11:57,101
I said,

7481
03:11:57,101 --> 03:11:57,551
Nice.

7482
03:11:57,551 --> 03:11:58,384
Too much.

7483
03:11:58,730 --> 03:11:59,260
No.

7484
03:11:59,260 --> 03:12:01,070
Say Nice was like,

7485
03:12:01,100 --> 03:12:01,933
no.

7486
03:12:02,240 --> 03:12:03,130
Couldn't even speak English.

7487
03:12:05,540 --> 03:12:05,890
I think.

7488
03:12:05,890 --> 03:12:06,723
Nice shot.

7489
03:12:06,940 --> 03:12:07,840
Nice Jab.

7490
03:12:07,870 --> 03:12:08,531
To their credit,

7491
03:12:08,531 --> 03:12:09,011
they stopped.

7492
03:12:09,011 --> 03:12:11,200
They stopped doing it
after the first event.

7493
03:12:11,201 --> 03:12:13,120
When I voiced my displeasure,

7494
03:12:13,180 --> 03:12:15,560
I just let them know like
really clearly this isn't,

7495
03:12:15,700 --> 03:12:16,750
we're not going to do in this.

7496
03:12:16,930 --> 03:12:19,800
I'm not going to change how
I do it to make you do this.

7497
03:12:20,530 --> 03:12:22,120
It's not even that.

7498
03:12:22,121 --> 03:12:22,661
It's just like,

7499
03:12:22,661 --> 03:12:24,460
if you don't like the way I do it,

7500
03:12:24,490 --> 03:12:29,440
this is not an option for you to direct
me and tell me to do it the way you like

7501
03:12:29,441 --> 03:12:31,450
it because you think that that's better.

7502
03:12:31,540 --> 03:12:34,120
This is a personal choice by one or two,

7503
03:12:34,121 --> 03:12:36,970
whoever the fuck the people were
that were producers or executives,

7504
03:12:37,210 --> 03:12:40,330
I don't agree with them and
I'm not doing it that way.

7505
03:12:40,390 --> 03:12:41,350
Like this is just how it,

7506
03:12:41,830 --> 03:12:43,120
it's like real simple.

7507
03:12:43,121 --> 03:12:46,510
Like if you bought a Ferrari and
it had a certain sound to it,

7508
03:12:46,511 --> 03:12:46,751
you're like,

7509
03:12:46,751 --> 03:12:46,991
man,

7510
03:12:46,991 --> 03:12:48,100
I don't like this sound.

7511
03:12:48,101 --> 03:12:51,260
Can you guys go back to the
factory and fix these mufflers?

7512
03:12:51,261 --> 03:12:51,860
They'd be like,

7513
03:12:51,860 --> 03:12:52,040
what

7514
03:12:52,040 --> 03:12:54,590
do you high like this
is what a Ferrari is.

7515
03:12:55,430 --> 03:12:56,840
You don't like it then
you're like Ferrari's,

7516
03:12:56,890 --> 03:12:57,040
no,

7517
03:12:57,040 --> 03:12:57,111
no,

7518
03:12:57,111 --> 03:12:57,410
no.

7519
03:12:57,410 --> 03:12:58,230
I like it for right,

7520
03:12:58,230 --> 03:13:00,760
but I want it to sound like
a Corolla doesn't work.

7521
03:13:00,770 --> 03:13:01,131
They'd be like,

7522
03:13:01,131 --> 03:13:01,810
no,

7523
03:13:01,810 --> 03:13:01,941
no,

7524
03:13:01,941 --> 03:13:04,010
you probably a bad analogy,

7525
03:13:04,011 --> 03:13:05,750
but the idea behind it,

7526
03:13:05,780 --> 03:13:06,260
you get,

7527
03:13:06,260 --> 03:13:07,010
I'm not,

7528
03:13:07,010 --> 03:13:07,843
this is what I do.

7529
03:13:07,880 --> 03:13:10,930
Like I get amped up if
some shit is going down,

7530
03:13:10,970 --> 03:13:13,370
these guys were throwing
blows and I'm screaming.

7531
03:13:13,460 --> 03:13:15,140
It's because I feel that way.

7532
03:13:15,141 --> 03:13:16,340
Some would call it passion.

7533
03:13:16,370 --> 03:13:16,580
Yeah,

7534
03:13:16,580 --> 03:13:17,121
it's bullets.

7535
03:13:17,121 --> 03:13:18,090
Legitimate Passion.

7536
03:13:18,091 --> 03:13:18,650
I'm not,

7537
03:13:18,650 --> 03:13:19,610
I'm not faking it,

7538
03:13:19,611 --> 03:13:21,050
but they didn't want that.

7539
03:13:21,730 --> 03:13:22,330
It did.

7540
03:13:22,330 --> 03:13:23,550
But they let it go after awhile.

7541
03:13:23,570 --> 03:13:26,060
But it's not like they fought
for me when I quit either.

7542
03:13:26,300 --> 03:13:27,980
How long has the Reebok deal for?

7543
03:13:28,550 --> 03:13:29,700
Uh,

7544
03:13:29,870 --> 03:13:30,441
three years.

7545
03:13:30,441 --> 03:13:31,620
I think three years.

7546
03:13:31,990 --> 03:13:32,580
Two to three years.

7547
03:13:32,580 --> 03:13:35,180
I wonder if it worked out for Reebok,

7548
03:13:35,181 --> 03:13:36,014
like his Reebok.

7549
03:13:36,110 --> 03:13:38,000
Reebok exploding now because of this.

7550
03:13:38,780 --> 03:13:39,141
Well,

7551
03:13:39,141 --> 03:13:41,510
Adidas zones Reeboks or
Adidas is killing it,

7552
03:13:41,511 --> 03:13:41,900
but I dunno,

7553
03:13:41,900 --> 03:13:43,100
free bucks exploding.

7554
03:13:43,101 --> 03:13:43,280
They,

7555
03:13:43,280 --> 03:13:44,091
they're the niche,

7556
03:13:44,091 --> 03:13:44,361
right?

7557
03:13:44,361 --> 03:13:45,081
The MMA,

7558
03:13:45,081 --> 03:13:46,670
the with crossfit.

7559
03:13:46,820 --> 03:13:50,030
So they're in that world
and to Reebok's defense,

7560
03:13:50,330 --> 03:13:50,770
you know,

7561
03:13:50,770 --> 03:13:50,970
they,

7562
03:13:50,970 --> 03:13:51,860
they made the offer.

7563
03:13:51,890 --> 03:13:52,730
They don't know.

7564
03:13:52,760 --> 03:13:54,380
They didn't know what the deal was.

7565
03:13:54,381 --> 03:13:55,940
They know they are screwing over fighters.

7566
03:13:55,941 --> 03:13:57,380
It's more of a UFC thing.

7567
03:13:57,780 --> 03:13:59,320
It was not Reebok Reebok,

7568
03:13:59,330 --> 03:13:59,571
it's like,

7569
03:13:59,571 --> 03:14:00,110
Whoa,

7570
03:14:00,110 --> 03:14:00,890
what the fuck.

7571
03:14:00,890 --> 03:14:04,610
It seemed like even the UFC wasn't
aware of how much fight is for actually

7572
03:14:04,611 --> 03:14:06,560
making off of sponsorships.

7573
03:14:06,980 --> 03:14:10,520
I mean you and I know that there was
some debate as to whether or not,

7574
03:14:10,940 --> 03:14:11,720
I mean they just,

7575
03:14:11,720 --> 03:14:16,280
they had a distorted perception of how
much some fighters were making and they

7576
03:14:16,281 --> 03:14:17,070
just think they kid,

7577
03:14:17,070 --> 03:14:20,180
I think they talked to maybe
the top 10 guys and like,

7578
03:14:20,181 --> 03:14:20,780
Hey,

7579
03:14:20,780 --> 03:14:21,690
we're going to pay this.

7580
03:14:21,700 --> 03:14:23,030
We would take care of you in this way.

7581
03:14:23,031 --> 03:14:25,420
And then the rest of the
guys get on board and they,

7582
03:14:25,430 --> 03:14:26,263
you know,

7583
03:14:26,480 --> 03:14:26,751
but,

7584
03:14:26,751 --> 03:14:27,440
but again,

7585
03:14:27,440 --> 03:14:28,310
I get it man,

7586
03:14:28,311 --> 03:14:29,010
if I'm dating,

7587
03:14:29,010 --> 03:14:33,080
I'm not making decisions based
off those 10 to 15 top guys.

7588
03:14:33,100 --> 03:14:33,490
I'll make my,

7589
03:14:33,490 --> 03:14:33,720
my,

7590
03:14:33,720 --> 03:14:37,760
my decisions that's going to affect my
bottom line and one which is what they

7591
03:14:37,761 --> 03:14:38,031
did.

7592
03:14:38,031 --> 03:14:43,031
One judge and the pain fight gave every
round and Jason Knight One judge did

7593
03:14:43,761 --> 03:14:44,541
look at it like you,

7594
03:14:44,541 --> 03:14:48,080
like he was on his back and he didn't get
taken down but he was the one that was

7595
03:14:48,081 --> 03:14:48,914
aggressive on the ground.

7596
03:14:48,950 --> 03:14:49,731
I agree with that.

7597
03:14:49,731 --> 03:14:53,590
I don't think you just take it one step
down and have one thing you do and then

7598
03:14:53,600 --> 03:14:54,433
be in control.

7599
03:14:54,920 --> 03:14:56,150
It's just been edited.

7600
03:14:56,660 --> 03:14:57,200
Yeah.

7601
03:14:57,200 --> 03:14:58,190
I to get out of here soon.

7602
03:14:58,230 --> 03:14:58,880
Boy Sets.

7603
03:14:58,880 --> 03:15:00,260
Wrap her up.

7604
03:15:00,290 --> 03:15:00,710
Uh,

7605
03:15:00,710 --> 03:15:01,580
Eddie Bravo.

7606
03:15:01,581 --> 03:15:06,170
