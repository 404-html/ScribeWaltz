1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,440
The general good experience for sure.
He's going to win again.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,030
I'm going to be the president.
So you think for sure he wins again

3
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:13,140
because is that because whoever the
Democrats decide to put in,

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,680
is it going to be an equal turd?
Sandwich again,

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,500
you're a super smart dude,
but you're also a bruton.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,020
Your big giant savage motherfucker.
Right?

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,710
So how many people have underestimated
you because you're a big giant savage

8
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:29,760
motherfucker planning talk stupid to you
and acted like you were a moron.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,430
I'd say equal street fights.
Two fights in the UFC.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,320
Yeah,
there's a lot of people.

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,660
Right?
And just people in general,

12
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,250
like they'll get snotty and take stevie
at tree.

13
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:40,650
I'm glad I'm going like my men.

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,690
But I think there's a certain part of us
that might be doing that with him.

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,450
I don't think he is.
I think he's really good at winning.

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,490
This is this,
this is not a,

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,760
not an like an endorsement of him.
Um,

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,640
no caveats necessary.
I'm horrified by this immigration policy

19
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:07,860
of separating children from their
parents.

20
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:11,130
I think that subhuman,
his wife came out and said that was

21
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:13,130
bullshit.
His wife's an immigrant bro.

22
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:15,390
His wife barely speaks English.
It's chaos,

23
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,260
right?
It's crazy.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,170
I hate.
I hate all that stuff.

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,430
These are just families.
They're just.

26
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:22,800
People love each other.
You got to keep them together.

27
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,330
If they break the law,
you keep them together.

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,070
Get them out of here if you want.
I mean,

29
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:27,840
if you want to send them back to
wherever they came from,

30
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:30,000
if you're,
you're hell bent on that.

31
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:33,060
But taking them from their kids is
subhuman.

32
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,580
I mean it's beyond that.
It's not us.

33
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,120
It's not what we're doing in 2018.
That aside all that aside,

34
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,730
he's probably gonna fucking win again,
man.

35
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,460
I think he's probably gonna win again.
I think he.

36
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,720
He gets in these confrontations with
people and they think he's adult.

37
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,990
I don't think he's adult.
I think he's.

38
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,990
There's no way he can be as successful
as he bent.

39
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,890
I know he's had his ups and downs and
shit like that,

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,640
but like what?
He just just the way he was able to

41
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:04,200
dismantle all those guys in those
Republican debates,

42
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,010
we told them to fuck apart from apart.
They have no business.

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,660
They had no business doing that with
him.

44
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:13,710
They just were too emotionally tied up
in his responses.

45
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:16,680
There was so much negativity and energy.
Uh,

46
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,680
it was like,
it.

47
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,380
There's all this anxiety like a fight
where a guy's in a full panic,

48
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,840
you know,
you've seen it like street fights,

49
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,710
especially guys just go into full panic
or even just talking shit and the school

50
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:29,544
yard,
you know,

51
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,990
one guy's getting bullied.

52
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,630
Bullies got the crowd watching them and
the other guys will,

53
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,620
but,
but your,

54
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,750
your fuck you man.
He's like,

55
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:38,010
ah,
that ain't gonna work.

56
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,020
You know?
That's Kinda,

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,560
that's what the rest of them look like.
Ted Cruz,

58
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,140
that's what they all looked like.
He's just been doing this his whole

59
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:45,750
life.
He's been talking shit his whole life,

60
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,120
you know,
and he's got a lot of fucking

61
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:53,490
supporters.
And if the economy keeps doing good,

62
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:57,240
man,
it's gonna be a hard sell to put some

63
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,530
guy in there like Bernie Sanders,
you know,

64
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:03,010
all the right wing people think,
just wants to give away all your money,

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,110
give away all your money to welfare
brats.

66
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,940
Even the left was protecting against
that,

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,900
right?
Because there's still money left on the

68
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:10,930
left.
I should point out,

69
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,770
I know Jack Shit about politics.
It was very important to point out 100

70
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:17,080
percent.
I've read all of the works,

71
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:17,650
almost all of them.

72
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,350
And he is brilliant trainer that.
I agree with that 100 percent outside of

73
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:22,240
competition.
Let's explain it to people.

74
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,170
Yeah.
Okay.

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,193
So,
so me.

76
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,870
Okay.
So let's say for instance,

77
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,880
let's say,
you know,

78
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,620
I'm a big believer in never being sore.
You should train the next day she'd wake

79
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:32,280
up feeling good.
Okay.

80
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:32,630
No.
Why?

81
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,760
How's that possible?
Well,

82
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,240
because look,
if,

83
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:35,811
if.
Okay,

84
00:03:35,811 --> 00:03:36,920
that's great.
That's a good example.

85
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,420
Let's say,
um,

86
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,420
let's see your energy levels of second
about fit people by the way,

87
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,740
right?
If you met every human being,

88
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,460
every guy has never worked out before.
First,

89
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,450
they never called.
Is it possible to work out and not be

90
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:48,284
sore?
No problem.

91
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,160
You okay?
Here we go.

92
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,540
So let's say there's something called cr
rate of perceived exertion.

93
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,060
Okay?
So let's say I make you do pull ups and

94
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:00,890
let's say the maximum on a pull ups you
can do.

95
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,080
The maximum amount of bullet is 10.
Let's keep a nice round number at 11.

96
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,940
You couldn't do 11.
If I put a pointed a gun at you,

97
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:08,774
you couldn't do 11.

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,570
Should I make you do 10 pull ups on our
workout?

99
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:15,520
No.
I'm going to make you do five.

100
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,800
Why?
Because I'm setting you up to work the

101
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,540
next day.
The next day we're going to do five and

102
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,610
the next day we're going to do another
five and then we're gonna do six.

103
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,990
One six is really easy.
We're going to do seven y if you count

104
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,940
if the.
If you did 10 pull ups on Monday,

105
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,890
you're going to be sore throat.
Thursday.

106
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,940
Let's this really your Max.
So Thursday you've only done 10 pull ups

107
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,500
from Monday to Thursday.
You've only done 10 pull ups.

108
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,110
Me,
I've been doing five pull ups every day,

109
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,530
so I'm a 20 pull ups already.
Twenty five pull ups.

110
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,650
I have more volume than you.
Now,

111
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,980
if you add up at the end of the year,
who trained more,

112
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,250
I've trained way more than you,
so let's say I go to Jitsu practice.

113
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,620
I'm doing Jujitsu every single day,
three rounds,

114
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:53,210
five days a week.
That's 15 rounds.

115
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,180
You go in twice a week,
but you kill yourself.

116
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,100
You do five rounds each day you kill,
you push yourself.

117
00:04:58,101 --> 00:04:59,480
Those last two rounds,
you burn yourself out.

118
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,420
I still did 15 year at 10.
At the end of the year I've done

119
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,420
countless rounds and what I may have had
so much more training than you.

120
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,590
So how much training can we pack in the
week?

121
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,370
That's the real question.
How much volume can you expose your

122
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:16,440
athlete too?
So I always tell people,

123
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,640
look,
energy,

124
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,950
sorry,
exercise can produce energy.

125
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,760
So let's say I'm feeling like a seven
out of 10,

126
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,980
10 being I'm really energized.
One,

127
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:28,760
I was like really lethargic,
feeling like I need to lay down and

128
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:29,810
seven,
I'm feeling good.

129
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,890
Okay.
If I get up and I do a right amount of

130
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,300
exercise,
the right amount,

131
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,990
I can feel like an eight point five
exercise can give me a tonic effect,

132
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:41,600
like drinking this coffee.
So let's say I just do some jumping

133
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:43,040
jacks.
I hit the back for a couple rounds.

134
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,260
I'm feeling good.
Once you get that high,

135
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,370
shut it down.
Don't go into the phase where your

136
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:50,050
body's beat up tight,
broken up,

137
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,410
don't redline the body that's only for
training camps for pe for a small period

138
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:56,231
of time.
Why?

139
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,160
Because you get a little bit more from
the system,

140
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,940
but in the long run you get less in the
long run.

141
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:04,670
You've tax the system.
So if you do that regularly,

142
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,160
by the time you actually get good

143
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,290
broken up is,
you know,

144
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,920
a realm of experience,
a realm of knowing that these things

145
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:16,930
give access to that's normally close to
us.

146
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:18,970
I mean,
it's kind of a trivial statement of

147
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:20,310
course.
Um,

148
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,060
but then you get down to questions of
how verifiable is that?

149
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:26,890
How real is that?
How,

150
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,750
uh,
you know,

151
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:33,751
and people get.
I don't know if the term is hung up,

152
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:37,450
but they can get baffled when you start
talking about,

153
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,430
you know,
the reality of say the entities you

154
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,530
encounter on dmt.
I mean this is,

155
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,560
this is some people I know are obsessed
with trying to verify the reality of the

156
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:55,090
entities that you find on dmt.
And again,

157
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:57,130
it comes down to if you experienced
them,

158
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,180
they're real.
If anything you experienced is real

159
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,330
because you've experienced it,
does it have a corresponding existence

160
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:09,720
in the external world?
Well,

161
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,630
you know,
what's external?

162
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,520
Let's eating turtle.
You know,

163
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,140
we,
we,

164
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,250
we throw around these terms,
these,

165
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,280
these epistomological metaphysical terms
quite carelessly without really thinking

166
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:25,250
about it.
What does it mean when you say,

167
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,880
I'm in here and you're out there,
you know,

168
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:32,870
and then you take a psychedelic and you
realize that's an artificial boundary.

169
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,030
You know,
we're all one.

170
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:38,090
There is no separation.
It's separate in normal consciousness

171
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,250
though it's separated in normal
conscious.

172
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,820
But then what is normal conscious if not
a reflection of year,

173
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,460
neurochemical brain,
state.

174
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,790
I mean,
everything you experience is an altered

175
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,700
state because it's filtered into this
brain,

176
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,060
processed by the brain,
and the brain is a biochemical engine

177
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,290
that you know,
as I say,

178
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,000
often were made out of drug,

179
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,760
but it seems that our normal
consciousness is the best state to

180
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:10,240
propagate biological life and to keep
our Aes,

181
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,040
our whatever we've created in terms of
our community structures and

182
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,300
relationships and friendships and the
ability to build structures and houses

183
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:20,830
and things like that.
These,

184
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,950
all of these things are done best when
you're here and present.

185
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,470
Whereas when you're on a psychedelic
state,

186
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,970
I agree with you.
Well,

187
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:32,770
the way I've always described it as if
you had a meeting with God and you went

188
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,690
and God gave you all the answers to the
world and you,

189
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,740
you experienced undeniable beauty in the
most extreme form possible where you

190
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,860
couldn't have imagined it and then you
came back.

191
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,540
Whether you hallucinated it or not,
it's the exact same experience.

192
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,220
Exactly.
You can't put it on a scale right way

193
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,000
it,
like we've stretched the tape measure

194
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,430
and God is 47

195
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,340
inches across like just because,
you know what I'm saying?

196
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:03,690
Just because you can't measure it with
what we term our,

197
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,543
our,
our,

198
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,230
you know,
our metrics for reality.

199
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,890
Right.
And that is exactly the thing.

200
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,600
Don't worry about whether it's real and
the way we would define real.

201
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,020
Is it good information or is it bad or
is it not?

202
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,530
That's the thing.
It doesn't matter where it comes from,

203
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,540
it's such a good information.
Then it has its own internal validity of

204
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,300
whether it came from some part of
yourself that is normally obscurity you

205
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:36,770
or uh,
came from the teacher or the aliens

206
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:38,210
transmitting it through.

207
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,830
It doesn't really matter.
It's a little wet,

208
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,750
but I just remember being a kid and like
my uncle like wasn't married or had

209
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,670
kids.
I was always like,

210
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,680
what's up with them?
Smart.

211
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,600
That guy,
it's partying.

212
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,550
Seems a go on the bill Maher route.
Do you burp?

213
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,810
But without getting me into the alarm.
Do you have a Bill Maher character?

214
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,760
You do?
I saw you did it.

215
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,780
You went to those people who didn't have
those people.

216
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,040
You're not okay.
You don't.

217
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
There is no god.
Okay.

218
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,420
Like
I know everything.

219
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,970
I kind of do agree with a lot of what he
says.

220
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,230
Yeah.
He's a smart guy that shows a weird

221
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:26,160
show.
Everybody talking over each other.
