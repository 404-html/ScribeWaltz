1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,840
Four,
three,

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,640
two,
one.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,070
Hello Barry.
Hi.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,640
And that we're live.
Thanks for doing this.

5
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:12,080
Appreciate it.
Thanks for having me.

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:17,110
It's a very fortuitous your timing comes
right in the middle of this big hubbub

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:23,110
about this native American elder in this
young boy with one of those stupid

8
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:28,520
fucking red hats on that.
Would you have ever imagined that a

9
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:32,630
slogan make America great again?
Would be so divisive as somehow or

10
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:35,630
another like that.
That would be like make America great

11
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:37,160
again.
It sounds like they just want to make

12
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:39,200
things great.
Like all positive.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,520
No red hat with white letters.
Has there ever been a time like that

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,760
where an object like a red hat with
white letters was so repulsive to half

15
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:50,780
the country?

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,950
Yes.
Well,

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,310
I mean some people see it as the
equivalent of a white hood.

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,200
Wow.
I don't know about that.

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,780
I think,
I believe.

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,400
Do they do what they believe that
wearing it,

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,520
wearing it that a 16 year old wearing
that hat sort of carries intense moral

22
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,970
weight that surely we know that a 16
year old is not aware of all the

23
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,400
implications of wearing that hat.
Yeah,

24
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,240
but the problem with that is Kanye wears
it,

25
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,680
right?
Fair enough.

26
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,270
It doesn't really work.
I agree.

27
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:21,120
I'm just saying there are people who
really make that argument.

28
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:23,580
I get it.
I know the people who are paid for their

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,473
opinions.

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,081
Well,
yeah.

31
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:26,610
Well,
there's also people that are calling for

32
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:31,611
this child's name and address or calling
to docs him and publicly expose him.

33
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,110
This is a child.
He's 16.

34
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:34,770
Is that what he is?

35
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,770
He's 16 years old and it was one of the
things that was just so amazing about

36
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:44,310
the whole brouhaha around.
I mean it was even a way like this

37
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:47,310
perfect encapsulation of our outrage
culture.

38
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,130
Right,
because people saw a tiny clip of this

39
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:55,131
video and it was like a Rorschach test
you saw in it this morality play of what

40
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:00,870
would it look to be,
was a group of mostly white kids from

41
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:04,500
Coventry Catholic school.
I think it's in Kentucky and it looked

42
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:09,030
like at first glance that they were
smirking and smug and had these sort of

43
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:12,750
shifting and grins on their faces and
that they were surrounding this older

44
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:14,610
native American man and I have to tell
you,

45
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,670
I had a visceral reaction to it.
The second I saw it,

46
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,530
like so many other people.
I was like,

47
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,910
this is,
you know,

48
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,090
where we are in our broken culture and
they're bullying this guy and here's the

49
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:27,570
rise of the.

50
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,650
I had all of those reactions.
The challenge of what it means to be a

51
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:36,630
journalist is to not see people as
signifiers or as stand ins just based on

52
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:39,380
their identity.
And that's what like 94,

53
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,900
95 percent of the press corps did.
They sort of leapt to the leap to assume

54
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,660
that,
you know,

55
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,410
are visceral reaction was accurate when
in fact when you actually looked at like

56
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:54,510
the two hour video of the whole
interaction,

57
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:58,680
which also included this group of black
Israel lights or Hebrew Israelites,

58
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:01,210
they called.
It was not that at all.

59
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,660
The native American man had walked up to
this group,

60
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,590
the four other guys had been heckling
the group beforehand,

61
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,410
calling them crackers,
calling them Satan,

62
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,070
calling the one black kid in the group,
things that can't even be said.

63
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,160
So it was just far more complicated.
Um,

64
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,230
and what,
what was really,

65
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:25,231
really disheartening is that the initial
outrage was enough for the mainstream

66
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:30,460
press to report on it.
Like twitter has kind of become almost

67
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:35,461
an assigning editor for places like the
New York Times and the Washington Post

68
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,130
and the Wall Street Journal.
And then when the actual truth of the

69
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:41,560
thing comes out,
when we move past the outrage cycle,

70
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,830
they have to sort of write the followup
story to the fake outrage to begin with.

71
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,030
I'm defending the fake outrage instead
of backing up and saying we made a

72
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:51,864
mistake.

73
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,600
Right.
Well,

74
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,350
some people said that they made a
mistake.

75
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:56,260
That's wonderful.
That's a good sign.

76
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,490
Yes,
it really is.

77
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,610
One of the things that was so horrifying
was that people that are supposed to be

78
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,150
adults,
you know,

79
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:08,110
people with blue check marks on twitter
were saying things like,

80
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,770
this is the face of white patriarchy.
The 16 year old kid

81
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,520
raise the US on set.
Have you ever seen him more punchable

82
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,710
face?
Kathy Griffin was saying,

83
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,750
I need names.
Shame him.

84
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,050
Docs him.
How do these people not understand the

85
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:25,870
implications of that?
So what happened over the weekend was

86
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:27,070
that the,
you know,

87
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:32,071
sleuthy detectives on twitter found a
kid who they thought was the kid in the

88
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:34,300
video,
wasn't actually the kid.

89
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,950
So there's the actual kid who was docs.
The family was harassed.

90
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,710
Everything that we now know happens in
these outreach cycles.

91
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,550
But then there was another kid who looks
suspiciously like him who was not him at

92
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,080
all,
whose family.

93
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,540
There was an amazing and heartbreaking
twitter thread about it,

94
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,020
whose family was in the middle of a
family wedding and they spend their

95
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:57,850
whole weekend fighting off these mobs
who were trying to destroy them.

96
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,930
And it wasn't even the kid in the video.
I mean,

97
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:06,880
that is really horrifying to me that
that's where we are and the fact that

98
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:11,881
adults who should know better or
fomenting this and don't see how thin

99
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,270
like the v s sounds heavy,
but like the veneer of civilization is

100
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,790
like they're taking a pickax to it.
It's just.

101
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,420
I just found the whole thing to be
terrifying.

102
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:26,320
I don't know how you felt

103
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,470
exactly the same way and I think it's a
very unique moment because it's so

104
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:36,120
public and it's so.
It's so prevalent in whether it's

105
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:40,050
twitter or facebook,
it's everywhere and it sort of embodies

106
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,140
everything that's wrong with a lack of
nuance and with people taking one side

107
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:49,860
versus the other and sticking with it
with not confronting their own personal

108
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:54,861
biases with looking at these things
through the eyes of this is the enemy.

109
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,570
I'm on the good side.
They're on the bad side.

110
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,920
Let's get them.
And also this,

111
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:06,250
this distorted idea of what it takes to
what it takes to be violent.

112
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,700
Like this idea of this is a punchable
person like calling for violence.

113
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,061
You,
you're,

114
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,220
you're hearing a lot of this.
Like,

115
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,980
this is one of the things that troubles
me so much about the left.

116
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,080
My family,
my parents were hippies.

117
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,980
You know,
I grew up when I was a little kid.

118
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,690
We lived from age of seven to 11 and San
Francisco during the Vietnam War.

119
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,080
While the Vietnam War was ending,
I was living in the middle of the hippie

120
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:36,350
world.
I always felt that people on the left,

121
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,970
we're like these well read kind,
compassionate people,

122
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,210
but somewhere along the line,
within the last few years,

123
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,880
people on the left are calling for
violence.

124
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,030
This is very.
This is very confusing to me,

125
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,250
and it's.
It's this frivolous social media call

126
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:55,250
for violence.
It's not an in person,

127
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,670
be their boots on the ground call for
it.

128
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,830
It's a very strange call for Violence
Punch Nazis.

129
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,410
I'm hearing this all the time because
it's right,

130
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:04,790
because it's.
Sorry,

131
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,320
go ahead.
What I'm going to say is what does a

132
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:11,030
Nazi okay?
If you mean punch actual Nazis that are

133
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,610
putting Jews in the concentration camps.
I'm with you,

134
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,640
but when you call a guy with a Maga hat
on,

135
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,820
he wears one of those red hats and he's
just an asshole.

136
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,380
He's a Nazi.
Now,

137
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,220
some guy who maybe is not that educated
want to be a contrarian,

138
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,370
sees all these liberals that are
complaining all the time so it puts this

139
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:31,880
red hat on and now he's a white
supremacist and a Nazi and you want to

140
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:33,830
punch him like,
okay,

141
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,150
that's with a lot of people in very high
positions of power in this country,

142
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,420
at least in the culture actually believe
and they don't understand the

143
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,610
implications of hollowing out words like
that.

144
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,340
I know this personally,
right?

145
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:52,350
Because I'm called alt right.
I'm called an apologist for rape

146
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:53,680
culture.
I've been called everything.

147
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,620
I'm a centrist.
Okay.

148
00:07:56,621 --> 00:08:00,460
I'm.
I'm a Jewish center left on most things.

149
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,680
Person who lives on the upper west side
of Manhattan and you know it's super

150
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:08,260
socially liberal,
liberal on pretty much any issue you

151
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:10,450
want to choose.
If I'm alt right,

152
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,360
what?
What words do we have left for people

153
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:15,970
that actually are that?
Exactly what words do we have left for

154
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:20,971
people who actually are part of a sort
of racist blood and soil nativism that's

155
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:25,240
rising in this country and around the
world that should terrify people that

156
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:28,570
are using that language in the sloppiest
of ways.

157
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,600
I really don't think they're seeing the
implications of it.

158
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,350
I also think that when,
when you're just,

159
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,990
you know,
your keyboard warrior and you're just

160
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:41,590
tossing this stuff out,
so much of it is about signaling to your

161
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:46,591
tribe that you know,
that this thing is bad and I really

162
00:08:46,811 --> 00:08:51,670
don't think people are understanding the
implications of this and I don't think

163
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:55,440
it's a stretch to imagine something like
this happening a week,

164
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,430
two weeks,
a month,

165
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:59,100
two months from now and someone actually
getting killed.

166
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,310
Right?
Like Charlottesville mean.

167
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,040
Very,
very similar to what happened there.

168
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,491
This,
this,

169
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:06,580
this kind of.
I mean when that guy drove over those

170
00:09:06,581 --> 00:09:09,910
protesters,
the ramping up of the dialogue on both

171
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:10,691
sides,
the rhetoric,

172
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:14,710
the violent talk,
it's so disturbing and so unnecessary.

173
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,280
Especially when it's disingenuous.
Like calling someone like you alright or

174
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,060
me cry.
I get called alt right adjacent.

175
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,380
That's what I hear,
that one all the time.

176
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,070
I'd go left on everything basically
except guns.

177
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,160
There's a few things that I'm like
repeal the second amendment.

178
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,690
Yeah.
But I,

179
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,890
I do think that there should be some
restrictions for gun use.

180
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:38,770
Just like I think there should be
restrictions for car use.

181
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,390
I actually think there should be testing
for guns and you should have to go look.

182
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:46,720
You have to go through a fucking.
You have to take driver's Ed to get a

183
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:48,850
car license.
How come you don't have to do any,

184
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:50,140
you know,
you don't have to do anything to get a

185
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:52,390
gun like you once.
If you're not a criminal,

186
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,780
you just get a gun.
Like you don't have to know how to take

187
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:58,480
care of it and clean it and sit safely.
Handle it.

188
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,040
You don't have to know the ethics of
use.

189
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,090
You don't have to know anything.

190
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,200
No.
It's insane.

191
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,900
I mean,
and I just spent six weeks in Australia

192
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,200
where they had basically one major
massacre 20 years ago and then I forget

193
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,190
who it was.
We could look it up,

194
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:15,130
but you know,
prime minister conservative got rid of

195
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:15,964
guns.
Yes.

196
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,610
Everyone in the country,
they think we're insane and psychotic

197
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:20,830
the way that we live where we're
definitely weird.

198
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,080
The thing also,
one other thing that,

199
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,550
that
jumped out to me about the Catholic

200
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:31,840
school boy incident,
it kind of signifies something broader

201
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:36,010
that's happening,
which is the eraser of the individual,

202
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,310
which is just,
I think a horrifying problem in our

203
00:10:39,311 --> 00:10:44,170
culture.
Like what actually happened was one our

204
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:48,370
incident on a random afternoon in
January between a group of individuals.

205
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,110
Right.
But instead in our mind,

206
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,860
why was everyone there?
The boys were there for the march for

207
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,840
life.
Um,

208
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,420
I don't know why the Hebrew Israelites
were there,

209
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,820
but it's DC,
like they're crazy protesters all the

210
00:11:00,821 --> 00:11:01,370
time.

211
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,640
You know,
at the Lincoln memorial and outside of

212
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:05,590
the White House were there for a school
event?

213
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,590
Is that what we're there for the march
for life as part of their school and

214
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:11,260
they had like,
been had free time I think.

215
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:14,320
And then we're converging at the Lincoln
Memorial.

216
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,970
They didn't have a chaperone.
There's no,

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,900
no.
I think the teachers,

218
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,280
there was a teacher there and they had
asked the teacher at one point in order

219
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:25,000
to drown out the heckling of the Hebrew
Israelites,

220
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,740
I hope I'm getting the name of that
group right.

221
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,770
Could we do a school cheer to kind of
ignore them?

222
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,280
And they did that and I think they did
that with permission from the teachers

223
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,360
at one point early on it was rumored
that they were chanting build the wall,

224
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:40,690
but no one has surfaced any evidence of
that whatsoever.

225
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,860
Well,
that's what I heard from the native

226
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:44,530
American elder when he was talking about
innovation in the video.

227
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:46,300
He said they were chanting out build

228
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,000
and maybe they were.
I just haven't seen anything and I've

229
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:49,834
watched every video.

230
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,420
It's totally possible there also 16.
Right.

231
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,250
Make your friends

232
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,760
laugh and they're assholes and they're
just being silly and stupid.

233
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,840
Right.
And I have to say,

234
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:02,380
as someone who was a total nerd in high
school,

235
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:07,710
I saw the face of the main kid in that
still photograph and that video and like

236
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,640
the 14 and 15 year old girl in me with
like enraged,

237
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,850
really like I was like I see the face of
so many kids who said the nastiest

238
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,510
things to me and who through friends of
mine into garbage cans,

239
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:24,250
like the,
like disgusting bullying.

240
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,800
Was it because the thing is you have to
get to the next step if you're a jerk.

241
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,683
No,
we was.

242
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,590
It was.
Yeah.

243
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,590
Oh,
for sure.

244
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,640
If he's just standing there,
it's the hat face.

245
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,040
Maybe even still if it's a group,
but he put the.

246
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:43,110
My thing is like your initial reaction
to something is not the truth.

247
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,620
It's your emotional reaction.
And anyone who calls themselves a

248
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:51,880
journalist like your job is to figure
out the facts of the case.

249
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,620
Not to make this into a kind of
identitarian morality play.

250
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,680
And the fact that so many people in so
many publications did just that.

251
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:05,620
And in fact,
when the real facts surfaced,

252
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,040
just sort of dug their heels in and were
basically like,

253
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,810
well,
he's a stand in for the white

254
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:12,610
patriarchy.
What?

255
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,590
That's crazy.
That's crazy.

256
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,540
Like there was an actual buzzfeed writer
that said it.

257
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,380
It's the look of white patriarchy,
his face.

258
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,750
You're really going to put that on a 16
year old,

259
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,011
would we?
Like,

260
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,230
it's just nuts to me.
Well,

261
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:29,650
it's cruel.
It's a denial of the individual.

262
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,930
It's very cruel.
When you're 16 years old,

263
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:34,420
you're basically a baby.
You don't know what the fuck you're

264
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:36,130
doing.
You're incredibly susceptible to the

265
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:37,240
influence of your peers.

266
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,370
You're around a bunch of other boys.
You're not around girls cause you don't

267
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:43,120
go to school with girls because he goes
some wacky religious school,

268
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,283
right?
That this is,

269
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,660
you know,
you want to really be a social justice

270
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:48,550
warrior.
You really want to save the world.

271
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,740
How about you do something about the
Catholic Church?

272
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,140
Everyone wants to go after our Kelly,
which is great.

273
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,340
But how about the Catholic Church?
How about the number one kid fucking

274
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:59,860
organization of all times?
That's what it is.

275
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:01,660
And I,
I was raised Catholic,

276
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,430
I know what it is.
Did anything happen?

277
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:04,690
And nothing happened to me.
I got lucky,

278
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,000
but I know people.
I know a bunch of people.

279
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:10,840
I know a bunch of people with stories
and this is all over the world.

280
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,920
Oh yeah,
but these kids come from that Colt.

281
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,240
Imagine if that was not the Catholic
church.

282
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,950
If it was insead,
scientology,

283
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,061
we will be going,
oh,

284
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:21,550
these kids are a part of a cult.
They went there.

285
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:26,230
They were part of this weird cult that
suppresses sexuality amongst its priests

286
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:31,231
and encourages the placement of these
pedophile priests in new places in order

287
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:38,560
to get away from whatever crime they've
committed in the area where they were

288
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:41,230
initially established.
This is what the Catholic church is,

289
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,390
right?
But then they travel all over the place,

290
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,270
but it also is good people.
This is the.

291
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,780
This is where the nuance comes into
play.

292
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,060
It's good people.
There's a bunch of people that are

293
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:53,810
Catholics because they want a better
with God or the universe or love or

294
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:55,610
whatever.
They feel like it's a good moral

295
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:58,040
framework for their children.
They take them there,

296
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,360
they believe in the 10 commandments,
they believe in this moral structure for

297
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:05,030
society that's laid down by what they
believe is God.

298
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,340
There's great people that are involved
in the Catholic church,

299
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,800
but it's also the number one kid fucking
organization the world.

300
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,050
It's those two things,
right?

301
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,080
So these kids are a part of something
that's way worse than smirking at a

302
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:20,930
native American with a drum.
And in my opinion,

303
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,180
being A.
I remember when I was 16,

304
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:26,870
I was a fool.
I was a dumb person,

305
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,330
you know,
I was bullied,

306
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,720
I was little,
small and I learned martial arts when I

307
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:33,960
was 15.
I mean,

308
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,330
I'm sure it was a dick to some people
just because I can get away with it.

309
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:37,610
I don't,
I don't really remember it,

310
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:41,510
but I'm definitely girls differently.
People are dicks.

311
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:42,640
You're trying it out,
you know,

312
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,030
you don't even know how to talk yet.
You basically just learning words and

313
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,830
this kid with this guy beating the drum
inches from his face.

314
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,020
He handled it,
I believe way better than I was.

315
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,810
I don't think I would have.
I don't see.

316
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,180
I mean,
I don't think so.

317
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,220
No,
I don't think so.

318
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,200
No one knows.
16 pop punk.

319
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:06,320
When I was 16 to also I was competing.
I was doing a lot of martial arts

320
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,750
events,
so maybe I would've kept it together

321
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,550
better than I'm.
I'm thinking I would have,

322
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,230
but I definitely was a fucking idiot and
I was 16.

323
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,320
You know,
you just don't.

324
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,430
And who knows what's going on that day,
who knows?

325
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:22,310
Like if you have the anxiety about the
future of your girlfriend broke up with

326
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:27,311
you or you failed the test or what else
that is like bouncing around inside your

327
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,410
head.
Overwhelming your ability to form

328
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,500
reasonable thoughts
by the way that everyone's initial.

329
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,350
Not everyone's every liberal.
I know.

330
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,330
Okay.
Everyone on the center and center left

331
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:45,290
and even the center reits reaction to it
was accurate that he was a little

332
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,750
asshole and he's a racist,
homophobic,

333
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:51,260
transphobic hates immigrants in every
single thing.

334
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Does that deserve to be news that a 16
year old kid with those views smirked at

335
00:16:58,131 --> 00:17:00,800
a native American elder?
Especially considering what he actually

336
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:01,634
did?
No,

337
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,610
I don't think that's news.
Not only that,

338
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:08,720
I think it's strange that we're covering
it like it is and because of the

339
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:12,260
Internet,
the fact that we're my timeline on

340
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:14,390
twitter and on facebook and on
everything.

341
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,170
This was way bigger news than day,
whatever it is,

342
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,870
30,
31 of the government shutdown where

343
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:24,470
people are having to get on breadlines
to feed their families.

344
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,430
Then here's the thing,
is it like it's people what it's what

345
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:32,330
people want to talk about.
I think there's this idea that there's

346
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:35,660
things that are happening right now like
the government shutdown and then there's

347
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:40,661
things that are happening right now in
terms of our culture shifting and when

348
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,250
these things that come up in opposition
to what many people believe is a

349
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:50,970
beneficial shift to a more progressive,
more responsible culture.

350
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,600
When these little hiccups,
they get addressed and they get address

351
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:59,601
rapidly and I think it's because people
are aware that things are changing in

352
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:05,031
this almost like unprecedented way.
If you look back on pace.

353
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,530
I agree with that.
Yeah,

354
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,710
like nothing we've ever.
There's nothing that you could find in

355
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:14,940
the historical record for human beings
is ever been what we've experienced over

356
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:19,941
just the past 10 plus years of social
social networks and social media and the

357
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:25,340
ability to spread information very
quickly with a youtube video or a tweet

358
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,730
or whatever,
or I mean these,

359
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,040
these,
the way people are exchanging

360
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,470
information is,
is very different and because of that

361
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:35,190
culture is shifting at a hyperspace
speed.

362
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:40,110
It's just turbo charged for sure.
So I think when something comes up that

363
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:41,760
we think is like,
ah,

364
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,090
there's one get it.
Exactly.

365
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,730
But it's not logical.
It's like it's like road rage.

366
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,100
You know why you get road rage?
One of the reasons because you're going

367
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:50,940
fast.
Okay,

368
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:52,570
you're in a car and you're nervous.
You're,

369
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,320
you're heightened senses.
So anything that happens,

370
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,930
it gets magnified.
Like someone's,

371
00:18:56,931 --> 00:19:01,650
you look motherfucker in my lane,
Hong Kong because you already jacked up

372
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:04,620
to eight because you're in a car going
60 miles an hour on twitter.

373
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,990
Does that.
Twitter's doing that 100 percent.

374
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:09,360
Social media is doing that.
Life is doing that.

375
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,440
So when something like this comes up,
this rapid pace of change,

376
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:15,780
which is almost an impossible to keep up
with,

377
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,020
right?
With the new cycle and this constant

378
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:22,530
wave of change and information.
So when something comes up,

379
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,840
people were road raging on this kid.
Totally.

380
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,350
That's why we just have to.
I mean there's,

381
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,570
there's lots of things to say,
but one thing has just continued to

382
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:33,810
insist on truth and facts.

383
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,530
Yes.
And not allowing people to be ins for a

384
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:39,480
group.
You're not a stand in for anyone.

385
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,370
You're yourself.
You answered for yourself.

386
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,700
And I just,
I find that trend on both sides really,

387
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:47,940
really scary.
It's because people are insecure and you

388
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:50,470
know,
I think for someone like Cathy who's

389
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,290
experienced,
Kathy Griffin,

390
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,560
who's experienced that public shaming,
that amazes me,

391
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,470
right?
Like she's been publicly shamed herself

392
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,710
in the most horrific way.
Has he basically had to live underground

393
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,490
and now she's saying shame him,
name him and docs.

394
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:10,350
It reinforces,
it reinforces people's idea that they

395
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:14,190
should be more,
more committed to their side,

396
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,440
more committed to their team.
The only way you're going to get any

397
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:18,750
support if you have been attacked and
isolated,

398
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,790
not alone,
is to get back deep,

399
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,030
deep into the team again.
Like how do you get back deep into the

400
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:24,510
team again?

401
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,730
You've got to be fucking rabid,
you know,

402
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:28,010
and that's part of it.
It's a,

403
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:32,070
it's a natural reaction that people have
to sort of signal to everyone else on

404
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:33,540
the team.
They're all in,

405
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,870
they're fully committed.
They don't even care about their fucking

406
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,520
career.
I'm an activist like that kind of shit

407
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:41,190
happens and it's,
it's people that want love.

408
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,940
That's what a lot of it is.
It's they.

409
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,040
They do recognize that there's something
wrong they'd,

410
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:48,040
they are reacting to a real thing.
Not denying that,

411
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,480
but I am saying that the reason,
the overwhelming reason,

412
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:57,100
the motivation for this kind of
overzealous reaction is often a

413
00:20:57,101 --> 00:20:59,990
signaling thing.
So they want to let everybody know I'm

414
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,250
on the fucking team,
man.

415
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,180
I'm all in.
Let's go punch Nazis.

416
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,900
And the people that I've talked to,
people that have said that and in real

417
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:09,100
life,
and I'm like,

418
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:09,621
man,
you,

419
00:21:09,621 --> 00:21:11,560
you can't punch any,
but you shouldn't punch anybody.

420
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,970
They're going to punch you back.
What do you don't punch first of all?

421
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,570
Who's your savior?
Punch for a real,

422
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,240
real,
real one,

423
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,190
you know,
in Poland or in Hungary right now,

424
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,100
right?
Right.

425
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,900
Know,
not at,

426
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,310
not a 16 year old kid who maybe has no
idea what that had signifies.

427
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,380
Well,
I mean,

428
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,860
and I mean there's a broader point which
is like the very same people,

429
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,460
like one of the sort of wisdoms of,
of criminal justice reform,

430
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:43,120
right,
is which I believe in,

431
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:46,960
is that we shouldn't try kids as adults
and we should forgive.

432
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,760
We should have greater generosity and
mercy and forgiveness for the crimes of

433
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:52,750
a child.
Even if they're,

434
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,200
they've committed them.
Those same people are the ones saying

435
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,510
him and shame him generally.
Politically.

436
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,670
Well,
you're seeing that now.

437
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,000
And this is again,
there's never been a doxing before.

438
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:05,020
There was no doxing.

439
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,060
Right?
How long has [inaudible] been around?

440
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:08,090
A decade.
Well,

441
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,910
thank you.
Since Game Gamergate is when it got

442
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,600
huge,
right?

443
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,510
Yeah.
Maybe let's go crazy and say the first

444
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,850
doxing was 20 years ago.
That's a blip,

445
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,470
right?
That's so recent.

446
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,740
So you know,
this is not a thing that people have

447
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:25,741
really had to balance out in their mind
when to do it and when not to do it,

448
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,020
they just do it.
I think people have no idea of what that

449
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:29,854
looks like.
Right?

450
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,470
And unless you've experienced it or
watch someone,

451
00:22:32,471 --> 00:22:33,700
you know,
experience it,

452
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,490
it's like it's like an abstraction
because these people are abstractions.

453
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,990
They're two dimensional little puppets.
That's exactly what it is.

454
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,560
That's exactly what it is.
And this extreme lack of empathy.

455
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,310
The lack of empathy towards anyone who
doesn't share your position.

456
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,010
This is very strange.
It's um,

457
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,270
it's very,
it's piss poor thinking and it's

458
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:57,220
everywhere and in.

459
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,480
Everyone wants to feel like not being a
part of one of the tribes is that

460
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:05,710
extremely lonely position and you get
called all the bad names because people

461
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:08,970
want you to be a part of their tribe and
people don't want to be called that name

462
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,330
is.
And they want to feel like they're in an

463
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:12,340
ingroup huddle,
like emotionally.

464
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,690
I totally got that kind of sucks being
homeless.

465
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,550
Well,
it's just politically homeless.

466
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,650
It's just
when you got a president that's so

467
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:28,651
polarizing and you have an opposition to
him that's so there,

468
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,690
there,
there's so much momentum in opposing

469
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:35,590
him.
And I think this is a giant wedge in

470
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:39,450
between these two sides.
And then you have that hat and that hat.

471
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:42,610
If that kid wasn't wearing that hat a
guaranteed be like 20 percent less hate,

472
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,760
it would be.
It would be great.

473
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,910
People would still get mad at him
because he was staying like.

474
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,360
I've seen people say when a native elder
walks up to you and he's banging his

475
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,430
drums,
get the fuck out of the way.

476
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,270
I saw that.
Like,

477
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,300
come on,
you can't expect that you what?

478
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,520
You can't just beat your drum.
First of all,

479
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:01,370
he got right in the kids face like
inches from the kid's face.

480
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,340
Pretty amazing.
The restraint this kid had to just

481
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:07,520
smile.
And the idea that you're going to judge

482
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:09,950
this kid.
Millions and millions and millions of

483
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:12,620
people are going over this right now.
That kid woke up that morning,

484
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,610
he had no fucking idea.
He was a kid in a cult.

485
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,730
Okay?
He's in a Catholic school and he's going

486
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:23,540
to some weird thing,
some march for life where people trying

487
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,160
to kill babies.
We've got to stop them from killing

488
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:25,971
babies,
right?

489
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:29,720
And he goes there and there's this black
Israelites calling them the faggots and

490
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:33,440
there's all these people calling them
names and then all of a sudden this

491
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:35,750
guy's beating the drum in front of his
face and we're supposed to.

492
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,570
We're supposed to dock this kid now
because he smirked.

493
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,440
That's crazy.
An impossible lack of empathy.

494
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,550
It's impossible to defend like unless
you hate boys,

495
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,980
unless you hate all boys because boys
are dumb.

496
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,350
Like 16 year old boys are almost
universally dumb.

497
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,870
They all,
they all grow up to be men.

498
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,030
Some of those men will be your best
friend,

499
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,270
so when those men will be amazing,
some of those men would be so happy to

500
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:03,110
see.
When you see him,

501
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:04,520
you give him a big hug.
Okay,

502
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:06,440
that's me.
That's me.

503
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,270
I was a stupid fucking 16 year old and
I'm a man now and I try to be as nice as

504
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:14,780
I can to everybody.
I go way out of my way to be a kind

505
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:18,200
person that could be that kid to like
what you're doing is not good for

506
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:19,380
anybody.
It's not.

507
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,700
It's not good for society to take this
trend and run with it and this is,

508
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,580
well,
this is what people do now you know,

509
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:28,490
you dock 16 year olds turbo charges the
right,

510
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,080
like think people are not quite
understanding that dynamic.

511
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,800
If you're someone who you know is
frustrated with trump and is maybe

512
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,810
moving to the middle and you know,
imagine that person,

513
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:44,660
it's easy to imagine.
Then you see this and you're like,

514
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,760
I don't let those people being in charge
of me.

515
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,770
I don't want those people running the
government.

516
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,980
That's the visceral reaction.
I just,

517
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:56,270
I don't think they're understanding the
implications of what they're doing.

518
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,830
I don't think they understand that they
do.

519
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,290
Maybe they didn't know.
There's no mastermind behind this.

520
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:03,400
There's and there's no understanding.
I think they do understand their

521
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:06,590
implications that when you have a
spectrum right,

522
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,290
the far right and the far left,
they have a very similar reaction as

523
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:15,080
they drive a person to the other side,
the person that sees the far right and

524
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:20,081
sees repulsive racism and bigotry that,
you know,

525
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,130
build that wall.
Fuck these Mexicans,

526
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:24,110
fuck those little kids.
They should have known better.

527
00:26:24,111 --> 00:26:27,770
They're all illegals.
That kind of person that pushes people

528
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:31,520
towards progressivism,
it pushes people towards much more

529
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:33,230
liberal,
even socialist ideology.

530
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:36,470
It's like fuck that gross snus.
And the same thing can be said for

531
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,120
someone like,
I'm going to send you something,

532
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:42,470
Jamie.
This is a real poster that Antifa is

533
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:44,150
sending.
They

534
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,610
were putting on,
um,

535
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,000
on wall,
on walls and fence posts and shit in the

536
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:54,870
Pacific northwest.
And it's actually kind of hilarious

537
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,110
because it's so stupid.
I'm gonna.

538
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,560
I'm gonna.
Send it to Jamie and Jamie's going to

539
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:00,270
put it up on the screen here,
but,

540
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:01,104
uh,
it,

541
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,690
it says,
whoops,

542
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,710
wrong one.
Jamie,

543
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,850
sorry.
Jamie Kilstein.

544
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,870
Here you go buddy.
I just sent it.

545
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,270
It says,
when you date a white,

546
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,550
it's not all right.
And it's like,

547
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,330
it's telling people to not date white
people.

548
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,750
Propagation of lights is propagation of
hatred,

549
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:22,950
oppression,
homophobia,

550
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:24,240
sexism,
transphobia,

551
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,920
racism,
enablism.

552
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:29,100
Now followers.
So are we supposed to sterilize white

553
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:29,701
people?
There it is.

554
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:32,520
We can see it up on the big screen.
So it's even closer because it's large.

555
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,590
But see,
this is the thing.

556
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,620
Racism is.
Racism is terrible,

557
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:39,150
right?
So how do you stop racism?

558
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,970
Racism is,
can only be perpetrated by white people.

559
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,010
Oh,
well the problem is white people.

560
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,260
We've got to stop white people.
Well now you're racist.

561
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,110
Like you're literally being racist to
stop.

562
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,830
Is this really?
Well,

563
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:54,960
there are people are finding it and
posting it online and someone sent it to

564
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:55,640
me.
Um,

565
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,660
I don't know if it's everywhere.
It's probably just one asshole.

566
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,390
Right?
But the person exists,

567
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,610
but that person exists and they think
they're a progressive.

568
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,190
Do you see the cold civil war that we're
in in this country?

569
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,620
No,
I hope not.

570
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,690
That's why I worried about this punch
style.

571
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,280
This go.
No one knows.

572
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:13,080
If we did,
we could make a lot of money in the

573
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:15,240
stock market.
This is,

574
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:20,100
this is why I'm concerned,
especially because I understand violence

575
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:24,780
a lot better than most people do.
You can't just say go punch people when

576
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:28,350
raise the Oslo and says,
have you seen a more punchable face that

577
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:32,310
is so fucking dangerous because you're
almost saying,

578
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,510
go punch this kid.

579
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:37,080
I saw someone else.
I accidentally favored something.

580
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:39,510
I didn't mean to favorite favorite it.
I did.

581
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,990
Someone pointed to me and I'm just lucky
that I looked at it because I normally

582
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:46,320
don't even read comments,
but somebody pointed out that I favored

583
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,450
a really preposterous tweet that said,
honest.

584
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,050
It said the reply from the school is
pathetic and impotent.

585
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,070
Name these kids.
Oh,

586
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:59,340
that's Kathy Griffin a.
here's the one that said it.

587
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:03,040
This guy said,
God damn it,

588
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,460
I can't find it.
He was basically saying,

589
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:09,030
no need to hear.
It is a face like that never changes.

590
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,760
This image will define his life.
No need,

591
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,760
no one need ever forgive him,
and this is the person with the blue

592
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:18,390
check mark by their name.
No one need ever forgive him.

593
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:22,260
A face like that defines his life.
That is virtual signaling in the most

594
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,940
toxic form,
so,

595
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:29,060
so dangerous to think like that.
The idea of it just.

596
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,240
I'm sorry.
Trying to.

597
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,193
No,
it's okay.

598
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:35,990
The idea that people cannot change to
irredeemable,

599
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,760
right is crazy.
Cancel culture.

600
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:40,800
I was talking about this with,
with Kanye.

601
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,040
Honestly.

602
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,020
You're talking about cancel cultures
here on the show.

603
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,510
We're talking about a person on the
phone.

604
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,740
Okay.
Just going to be on the show.

605
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,210
Cool.
Allegedly,

606
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,590
he's a little nervous to see him with a
Samurai sword posing and he would go

607
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,230
with the Elon musk on that poster.
It's been.

608
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,500
It was first posted over two years ago
and it's supposedly as a like a troll.

609
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,930
Oh yeah,
that makes sense.

610
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,670
But this is the world where it's hard.

611
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,290
Define what's a troll was.
What I was going to say that if I was

612
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:13,580
cynical,
I would say that if I was a person who

613
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:15,730
is like far right,
I wouldn't put that up.

614
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,950
Of course,
just to fuck with these people and sweet

615
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,000
people.
I mean it's basically like some CIA

616
00:30:21,001 --> 00:30:23,100
psyops type shit.
You know what I mean?

617
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:26,490
This is this worth so through the
looking glass here.

618
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,260
They'll like that post that I just read
you.

619
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:31,500
That's a real post about this guy is
unredeemable.

620
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,150
No one knew.
Never forgive him.

621
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,240
That's just as bad in my opinion.
Is that poster saying,

622
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:38,430
don't date white people.
It's all crazy.

623
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,830
We pressing no,
no.

624
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,110
Here's the thing.
You have to like fight.

625
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,890
I have to fight this feeling of despair.
You have to like,

626
00:30:46,891 --> 00:30:51,891
I find myself fighting it because the
basic like some like basic virtues,

627
00:30:53,281 --> 00:30:54,660
right?
That used to be normal,

628
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,680
right?
Like civility,

629
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,800
civility has now become,
for some people a code word for like

630
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,450
complicity with Nazi-ism.
Like if you're,

631
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,510
if you're civil and you believe in
civility and you believe in,

632
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,830
you know,
treating people decently and with giving

633
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:15,450
them the benefit of the doubt like that,
that word itself has become a code or a

634
00:31:15,451 --> 00:31:18,180
signal in a negative way.
Empathy,

635
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,300
like human doubt.
Even saying it.

636
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:22,410
I don't know.
You know,

637
00:31:22,411 --> 00:31:23,130
I,
I just,

638
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:28,130
these basic virtues seemed to have been
swept away and I don't know when they,

639
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,960
when they got lost.

640
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,270
Well,
a key ingredient for sure.

641
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:35,160
The thing that hardened the epoxy was
trump.

642
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,550
I think these trends,
these trends are going in that direction

643
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:40,710
anyway,
but he capitalized on that.

644
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,310
You know,
he's a very smart manipulator.

645
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,900
He knew how to capitalize on that.
I mean,

646
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:48,750
this chant of build that wall,
it's not an accident.

647
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:53,620
That's something that he concentrates on
and it's not just that it's there.

648
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,730
We're in a political battle right now
because if they get him to back down off

649
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:59,820
the wall,
then he looks like a loser when 20,

650
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:02,160
20 comes around,
he looks less powerful to all those

651
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:04,620
people.
There's that for sure,

652
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:09,000
but there's also this.
He's so egregious like everything.

653
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,280
He's so he sold that guy.

654
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,760
Well,
he's gotten rid of all the guardrail,

655
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,190
like he's broken the damn.
My question,

656
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:19,870
like thinking about how we're going to
get beyond this is how do we build it

657
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:24,250
back because he's broken something or he
signifying the fact that it was broken.

658
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:26,950
One or the other.
I think that he was both a symptom of

659
00:32:26,951 --> 00:32:30,130
something that was broken that we didn't
recognize and now he's further catalyze

660
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:30,964
that,
broken it.

661
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:34,220
Well,
I think both sides have to recognize

662
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:36,860
that the other side has some points.
That's one thing,

663
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,860
and then I think we also have to treat
ourselves like all family.

664
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,380
We're all in a big team because that's
what we really are.

665
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,690
If we really are the United States of
American,

666
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,890
I mean what?
What is it?

667
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,560
What is a country?
I mean if anything,

668
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:52,100
we're supposed to be a team.
The idea that we're separated and were

669
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:56,480
two teams in this one team.
The real differences in terms of who

670
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:59,000
gets elected,
like how it's going to affect your life,

671
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,870
involve business,
involves some social policies,

672
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,600
involve some things,
but the way we interact with each other

673
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:07,370
on a day to day,
it doesn't involve that at all.

674
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,910
That has to be fixed first.
The way we think about each other on a

675
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,700
day to day basis.
They used to be a time where you could

676
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:17,240
have a conservative friend and you can
be a liberal and you could be a fucking

677
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:21,590
long haired Hippie guy and as long as
you're a good hardworking person who

678
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:25,250
didn't let their long go crazy,
your next door neighbor who was like a

679
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,980
goldwater Republican would talk to you
and you would go,

680
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:28,730
how's it going,
Mike?

681
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,570
What's going on with,
oh,

682
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,940
you know,
guys at the forest or try to put

683
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:34,070
together this case and this and that,
and you know,

684
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:38,090
a professor could live right next to a
cop and they would be friends and one

685
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:40,700
would be conservative and one would be
liberal and they would make fun of each

686
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:43,760
other a little bit and rib each other a
little bit and that would be the end of

687
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:44,540
it.
That would be it.

688
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,290
It wouldn't be this civil war that we're
experiencing right now,

689
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,450
right now,
just verbal and hopefully it stays that

690
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:51,760
way,
but it's.

691
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,510
It's,
it's confusing.

692
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,750
It's confusing because there's a lack of
a frustrating lack of empathy that when

693
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:03,500
I look at human beings and when I look
at people that aren't seeing what

694
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,930
everyone else was seeing or they're not
seeing things objective,

695
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:08,390
Lee and their rational and overly
emotional,

696
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:11,060
I always assume there's something else
to running from.

697
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:16,420
I always assume when I see someone
lashing out and insulting everyone

698
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:19,220
around them,
I always assume it's not the people

699
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:22,280
around that it's something internal.
There's some something,

700
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,490
maybe some existential angst.
They're fighting against some

701
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,520
realization of the futility of life.
Whatever the bucket is mean.

702
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:35,620
Finite organisms playing this game as if
it lasts forever and accumulating stuff

703
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:40,460
is if it's going somewhere with you like
it's going to get in that wooden canoe

704
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,520
and the God is going to take it with you
in the afterlife.

705
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:48,521
It's nonsense and somehow or another we
know this and we as especially as people

706
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:51,590
get older,
they seem to push it further and further

707
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:55,400
in the back of their mind and they get
more and more ideologically based.

708
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,910
They're less open minded.
They're less open to nuance.

709
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:04,090
It's very rare to see a 65 year old guy
switched parties that's calcified.

710
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,570
You become that guy,
you know?

711
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,370
Yeah.
That fucking asshole uncle that has a

712
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,290
couple of drinks in them and starts
talking about the gays,

713
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,500
you know,
and this and that and all the things

714
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:17,510
that are wrong with our culture,
the sodomites,

715
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,550
you know,
people start talking crazy.

716
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:21,110
Ever heard that at a Thanksgiving
dinner?

717
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,443
I haven't either.

718
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,340
But um,
I think there's a few things that can

719
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:33,341
help us.
One I think is just time realizing that

720
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:38,070
these stupid fucking blow ups over this
kid and the discussion that comes

721
00:35:38,071 --> 00:35:41,100
afterwards,
hopefully some of this will settle down.

722
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,910
We're allowed to have disagreements.
We're allowed to have opinions about how

723
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:49,911
these kids should have behaved,
were allowed to have ideas in there,

724
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,730
in our minds about how,
how you would behave if you were that

725
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:56,130
kid,
but I don't think you're allowed to dock

726
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:57,840
some.
I don't think you're allowed to even say

727
00:35:57,841 --> 00:35:59,940
that.
I don't think you're allowed to say that

728
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,720
you want to punch him.
I think that needs to become socially

729
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:05,340
unacceptable to do that.
Yeah.

730
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:07,350
You need,
you need to be checked for that because

731
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:08,890
that's,
you know when,

732
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,470
when someone says things like eyes him
who's,

733
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,320
who's punched him,
he punched you buddy.

734
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,900
Who's ever punched you?
Punched.

735
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:19,590
Feels like
he might.

736
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,160
Georgia probably punch them.
Jordan's more of a I'll punch you type

737
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:24,450
of a guy.
I don't think Sam would ever say you

738
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:26,020
would punch somebody.
I cannot.

739
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,270
I have to say I can not imagine
everything that's on that.

740
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,400
I will punch you.
Well,

741
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,620
you know the feeling of I'm going to
punch you,

742
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:34,080
but I can never imagine it's.
Yeah,

743
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:36,450
I mean,
unless you're protecting someone you

744
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:40,530
care about or your own self.
Although I did see this amazing video of

745
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,850
Buzz Aldrin to.
Do you see this?

746
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,050
Oh,
punching the guy who said that he didn't

747
00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:43,890
go to.
I know that guy.

748
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,270
That Guy Bart cerebral that he punched.
I went to the moon landing tonight.

749
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,220
Oh yeah.
Alex Jones.

750
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:52,340
I used to be a moon landing denier.
I used to believe.

751
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,750
I used to believe totally that we never
went to the moon because there was a

752
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:56,020
documentary that came on Fox.

753
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,780
Yes.
Trust me.

754
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,920
No,
I didn't,

755
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,480
I didn't go to number four in the 19
nineties in the 19 nineties,

756
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:08,160
Fox had a show called conspiracy theory.
Did we go to the moon and they aired it

757
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:09,390
on television,
prime time.

758
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,760
They got me hook,
line and sinker,

759
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,760
and for years I believe that we didn't
go to the Mon.

760
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,450
What changed you?
Mostly talking to neil degrasse tyson,

761
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:22,890
but also critical thinking.
Also realizing that I Was fully

762
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:26,850
committed to that idea without really
exploring the possibility whether that

763
00:37:26,851 --> 00:37:30,900
idea was incorrect and that I would take
in everything that I saw in that

764
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:33,510
documentary,
which is incredibly convincing and with

765
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:37,290
100 percent confirmation bias,
I only looked at that and I didn't look

766
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:40,230
at all the contrary evidence.
There's some fucked up stuff about the

767
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:43,650
moon landing unfortunately.
And the fucked up stuff is mostly people

768
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:47,430
that were involved in publicity that
we're doing stupid things with

769
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,120
photographs.

770
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:53,120
Like they had taken a picture of,
I'm going into unchartered territory or

771
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,090
just say like,
you're an expert on this.

772
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,440
I've never gotten into landing.
Denialism

773
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,860
was buzz aldrin.
Um,

774
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,280
who was the guy that was Michael
Collins?

775
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,880
Michael collins in gemini 15
photographs.

776
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,430
He seen it many times.
Pulled up that photo.

777
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,390
This is what I'm talking about.
No,

778
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:13,710
no,
no.

779
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,080
It has nothing to do with that.
This is a photo that they,

780
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:19,140
uh,
they put out as an official photograph

781
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,970
of Michael Collins doing a spacewalk,
but what it actually is,

782
00:38:22,971 --> 00:38:27,210
is a photo of them testing equipment and
they blacked out the backgrouNd.

783
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:30,300
So he's in this suit that they were
doing with testing and instead,

784
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:32,790
because they really couldn't get good
photos in space because no one's out

785
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:34,650
there with him taking his pictures.
Right.

786
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,280
So they lied.
They faked it.

787
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,410
This is it.
So the see the one on the left,

788
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:41,980
you see the real photograph and this is
him in a studio where they're working on

789
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,810
him or warehouse rather or some sort of
a testing environment working on how to

790
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:52,020
control these harnesses that you would
use when you're on a space walk because

791
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:55,630
that thing propels him forward and back
and he's learning how to use it.

792
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,950
What they did was they just blacked out
the background and reversed it and then

793
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:03,160
they sold that as him actually being in
space.

794
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,850
So this is probably an overzealous
publicists and there's a bunch of these.

795
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,880
There's a bunch of these when it comes
to different backgrounds in areas of the

796
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:13,151
moon,
there are many,

797
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:15,970
many miles apart from each other.
It shouldn't be the same background and

798
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:20,530
more likely than not what you're dealing
with is overzealous publicist because

799
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,750
photographs were incredibly difficult to
get.

800
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:23,440
I'm sure.

801
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,060
Well,
the morAl of the story to me,

802
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,390
thank god first of all that you're no
longer a moon landing denier,

803
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:33,690
but also the power of the media and the
press and like you saw one documentary,

804
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,300
right?
There's a couple after I saw that.

805
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,150
Quite a few,
but that sent you down this rabbit hole

806
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:40,984
and that,
you know,

807
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,240
I've been thinking about.
Did you see that roku is,

808
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,790
I think d platformed.
Info wars,

809
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,930
yes.
Instantly,

810
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,030
like within a day.
But I wanted to ask you a question

811
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:49,620
before we get.

812
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,540
Okay.
Because I have to say I feel.

813
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:57,020
I think I support that because
I don't want like in an age in which

814
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,270
people don't know,
okay,

815
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:06,860
like a 15 year old clicking through
their roku doesn't necessarily know the

816
00:40:06,861 --> 00:40:11,720
difference between cnn and info wars and
the New York times and msnbc and

817
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:13,820
whatever,
and of course some of those other ones

818
00:40:13,821 --> 00:40:18,200
have biases obviously,
but info wars promotes conspiracy

819
00:40:18,201 --> 00:40:23,201
theories and do I want a 15 year old kid
stumbling into that and thinking that

820
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:28,541
that information is on par on a level
with actual facts

821
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,640
fix.
The problem with conspiracy theories is

822
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,220
that some of them are real.
This is the real problem.

823
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,110
The problem is you don't know which ones
are real,

824
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:39,860
but some of them are real.
The gulf of tonkin that got us into the

825
00:40:39,861 --> 00:40:41,240
Vietnam war.
You're aware of that?

826
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,370
Okay,
but sandy hook,

827
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,820
sandy hook for sure happened.
Bunch of kids died and these are

828
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:49,130
horrible.
These are horrible evil conspiracies.

829
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:52,370
The problem is loaded by Alex Jones.
Yes.

830
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,320
It's horrible.
Without a doubt,

831
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,310
and I saw the media matters clip that
I'd never seen before.

832
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,460
I saw it recently.
When you clip the one that shows every

833
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:02,900
time he brought it up.
Oh,

834
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,210
amazing.
How just one time.

835
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,210
Oh,
I know many,

836
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:06,950
many,
many tImes and was saying it was an

837
00:41:06,951 --> 00:41:10,820
absolutely fake thing.
Has he ever apologize backed off of the

838
00:41:10,821 --> 00:41:13,250
position now?
But I think because of the lawsuit or

839
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,530
I'm sure it's a lot of things.
I'm sure it's the pressure.

840
00:41:15,531 --> 00:41:18,350
It sorts.
It has to be a realization that he knows

841
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:21,230
that it really did happen,
but there's a giant group of people out

842
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:25,520
there that still believe it didn't
happen and they still confront these

843
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:29,380
parents even in court and they call them
crisis.

844
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,500
No,
I know that the time.

845
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,110
it's done.
Amazing reporting on this.

846
00:41:32,111 --> 00:41:33,870
Elizabeth Williamson.
Mild sick.

847
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,840
It's sick.
It's twisted.

848
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,000
Um,
we probably shouldn't.

849
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,740
I mean we can go into conspiracy
theories.

850
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:42,950
I just don't know to go into.
It's not a bad thing to go into because

851
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:44,720
it's a thing.
Okay.

852
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,760
But it's,
it's,

853
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,290
you know.
I'm curious what you think drove around.

854
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,100
what do you think of roku taking info
wars up?

855
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:55,040
Oh,
I think we have to decide what,

856
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,370
what is twitter?
What is facebook?

857
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:01,190
What is youtube?
The position that most people have is

858
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,380
these are private companies.
They can make their own rules.

859
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,550
This is just like cbs deciding that if
you use a,

860
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,760
you know,
if you drunkenly yell the n word out at

861
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:15,220
a black police officer,
that they don't want you as a newscaster

862
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:15,951
anymore.
What,

863
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:18,620
you know,
that's a public account or a private

864
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:20,330
company that can make these
distinctions.

865
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,390
If you take a position,
uh,

866
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,190
an antisemitic position publicly,
they can,

867
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,180
they can decide,
look,

868
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:27,320
we don't want you on the air anymore.

869
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:32,470
And then there's other people that think
freedom of speech in this form is so

870
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:38,231
important and that the answer to bad
ideas is not stopping those ideas.

871
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,780
It's good ideas.
It's good ideas confronting those ideas

872
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:43,760
and you see it all work itself out.
That's,

873
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,940
that's the does the other side of the
coin.

874
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:50,270
That's the other side of the argument.
The argument that we should treat,

875
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:54,710
whether it's twitter or youtube or any
of these social media platforms as a

876
00:42:54,711 --> 00:42:58,040
public utility and they,
you should be able to distribute

877
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:00,470
information.
The real problem is with all of this,

878
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:02,380
is that it's very messy.
The,

879
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,283
the,
there's,

880
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,400
this is a nuanced issue.
There's a lot going on because when you

881
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:12,430
do decide to deep platform someone for
having an awful position and spreading a

882
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:17,630
false conspiracy about that,
most people are gonna agree with you,

883
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:21,230
but the question is,
does it stop there and does it move on

884
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:25,070
to you are a person who believes in
white nationalism.

885
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,481
What does that mean?
Well,

886
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:30,530
I believe that black pride is fine,
but I also believe white pride is fine.

887
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:32,870
What about those people?
Where do we go with them?

888
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:36,450
Then it gets slippery and then jason.
Yeah,

889
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:38,690
jason,
I met people that have given the

890
00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:40,190
outright of platform,
you know,

891
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:42,080
what are they,
are they a part of the problem now?

892
00:43:42,081 --> 00:43:44,000
Should we d platform them?
I mean,

893
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:46,190
this is one of the things that,
there was a,

894
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,760
uh,
a paper that someone had put together an

895
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:54,761
article that was
hilarious where it's like everyone has

896
00:43:55,221 --> 00:43:58,390
this very bizarre connection.
It's six degrees of kevin bacon.

897
00:43:58,391 --> 00:43:59,420
Yes,
exactly.

898
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,460
And but,
but they're using yet in terms of the

899
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,940
way the connections is almost,
if it's scientific data,

900
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,870
well they would basically say have you
or something like.

901
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,520
Well they did say to me,
they said,

902
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:11,880
have you,
you're a gateway to the outright.

903
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,000
Yes.
So what I said is Barbara Walters

904
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:16,130
interviewed castro.
Does that make her a communist?

905
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,890
What the fuck are you talking about?
Exactly.

906
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,120
pretty left.
Like,

907
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,620
just ask me questions.
Like if you want to know I'm not going

908
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:24,910
to hide my positions on things from you.
I,

909
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,270
I'm very open.
Obviously.

910
00:44:26,271 --> 00:44:28,610
I've told people I used to believe the
moon landing was fake.

911
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,650
I'll tell you all the stupid shit I
believed,

912
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,393
but

913
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:37,860
the question with this is it,
why do people want that?

914
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:40,110
because it's simple and easy.
Just get them,

915
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,490
get rid of them,
punch them,

916
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,650
punch the nazis.
It's lazy,

917
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:47,310
stupid people thinking and they're
thinking publicly and they,

918
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:51,060
uh,
they represent a progressive viewpoint

919
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:52,830
with their lazy,
stupid thinking.

920
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:57,300
It's not that progressivism and
progressive viewpoints or bad is that

921
00:44:57,301 --> 00:44:58,760
lazy,
stupid thinking.

922
00:44:58,761 --> 00:45:01,560
And applying a progressive viewpoint is
bad.

923
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,680
It's not even that socialism is bad.
I've been thinking a lot about socialism

924
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:09,690
lately in terms of like what is the
point if if we get to a certain point

925
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:15,140
and then our our hot,
our heart stops beating and we dye it

926
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,840
and you,
you left behind $18,

927
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:22,320
billion dollars to your kids because you
were the ultimate capitalist and you

928
00:45:22,321 --> 00:45:26,340
went hog wild.
That sets a fool's path.

929
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,160
That Is a nonsense path.
Like why did you do that?

930
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,430
like why didn't you try to use that
money,

931
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:37,340
this insane amount of wealth and have
this massive impact on,

932
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:38,380
on the populous?
Why?

933
00:45:38,381 --> 00:45:41,500
Why didn't you try to figure out some
way?

934
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,200
Right?
It wouldn't be a choice to but what if

935
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,850
bill gates right now,
but what if this bill gates is doing

936
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:55,500
that and a lot of ways with some of the
money tomorrow if he throws a million

937
00:45:55,501 --> 00:45:57,960
here or there,
it really ain't shit for him and he's

938
00:45:57,961 --> 00:45:59,910
gotten like $90,000,000,000,
whatever it is.

939
00:45:59,911 --> 00:46:04,680
But the point is that things like the
fire department,

940
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,500
we agree this is a socialist thing,
right?

941
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,980
We were all chip in.
We have public utilities,

942
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,520
we have people that parks and
recreation,

943
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:19,550
people that are department of fish and
wildlife and the sheriffs that patrol

944
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:23,760
our national forest.
We all chip in to pay for these things.

945
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:25,350
We all agree these are important thIngs.

946
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,910
Well,
one of the things that was so

947
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:30,690
interesting about Australia is that in
certain ways it's a more,

948
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,730
you know,
it's thought of as sort of a macho

949
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:35,160
culture,
maybe more masculine,

950
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:37,440
a little bit more conservative than here
generally,

951
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,240
and yet the left has one.
There are so many of the major issues

952
00:46:42,241 --> 00:46:45,030
that we're fighting.
We're killing each other over now.

953
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,800
They're very universal healthcare.
Yeah.

954
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,520
mandatory 401k
$18 minimum wage pensions,

955
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,450
four weeks of vacation a year.
Like I think they get maternity leave as

956
00:46:57,451 --> 00:47:00,630
well.
It's just like so many of the things

957
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:02,610
that are up for grabs,
they already solved.

958
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,070
I think we have to take things into
consideration.

959
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:10,071
One that they have a small population,
small in homogenous in its enormous

960
00:47:10,471 --> 00:47:12,870
place.
You're dealing with a place as large as

961
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:15,750
the contiguous United States of America,
but there's only 20 million people on

962
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,260
way because when they were like,
it's crowded in that restaurant,

963
00:47:19,261 --> 00:47:21,420
and I was like,
you mean I don't have to wait for an

964
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,130
hour to get in?
They,

965
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,290
no,
they've never seen a crowd of people.

966
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:30,010
They don't know what a real crowd is.
And also I think their culture

967
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,820
is less constrained by history because
they came,

968
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,250
they were essentially prisoners.
I mean

969
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:38,980
several generations removed.
Exactly.

970
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,520
Yeah.
But it's not,

971
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,550
not only that they're not indigenous.
No.

972
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:45,160
I mean like the non indigenous
population prisoners.

973
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,330
Yes.
Yeah,

974
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:50,330
well they came from,
they were sent there because england and

975
00:47:50,331 --> 00:47:53,810
warm and that's literally how the
country got founded for like stealing a

976
00:47:53,811 --> 00:47:55,400
watch.
Like they were low level.

977
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:58,430
Then they sent them to the much better
place.

978
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,230
Oh yeah.
Way better.

979
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,370
It's,
I'm a gold coast.

980
00:48:01,371 --> 00:48:02,480
You're like,
holy shit.

981
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,640
It just takes forever to get fewer
manchester.

982
00:48:04,641 --> 00:48:06,500
It's raining everyday,
like fuck this place

983
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,660
and you,
you know,

984
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:10,150
you stole a watch and they shipped you
off to the gold coast.

985
00:48:10,151 --> 00:48:10,984
She be like,

986
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,140
what?
What just happened?

987
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,840
This is hilarious.
Your fish out here.

988
00:48:15,841 --> 00:48:17,550
It's fucking beautiful.
They're nice

989
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,740
people and I,
I wonder if they're so nice.

990
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:25,690
I feel like they are slightly less nice
than canadians who are way more nice

991
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:26,440
than us.

992
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,680
I think that's right.
I also think that they have.

993
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,190
They have it so good that they're a
little complacent and that makes me

994
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,540
concerned because China.
Okay.

995
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,610
Right.
That's the big story there.

996
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,220
Yes.
Yes.

997
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:42,690
I see what you're saying.
Yeah.

998
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:43,681
Well,
you know,

999
00:48:43,681 --> 00:48:47,220
that is to be considered,
but I think the United States,

1000
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:52,020
first of all,
we have this momentum of innovation and

1001
00:48:52,021 --> 00:48:54,270
of ass kicking and,
and,

1002
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:58,170
and getting things done and creating
things that's so different than any

1003
00:48:58,171 --> 00:49:00,900
other part of the world.
If we took that shit down a notch,

1004
00:49:00,901 --> 00:49:02,700
I think we'd be okay.
You know,

1005
00:49:02,701 --> 00:49:07,140
I mean I think we definitely do have to
worry about China and know I've been

1006
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:12,230
really trying to closely follow all this
walway stuff where these executives keep

1007
00:49:13,111 --> 00:49:18,111
getting arrested and you know,
It's the close relationship between some

1008
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:25,191
tech companies and this communist
government is very confusing,

1009
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,010
but some people look it over.
So if you talk to people that are

1010
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,050
chinese natives or who have been to
China,

1011
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,440
they almost look at as a positive.
There's less resistance.

1012
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:36,660
It's more.
Even though the censorship is open,

1013
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,500
it's at least you know what you're
dealing with over there as opposed to,

1014
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,260
you know,
the nsa is spiraling up.

1015
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,210
Oh,
I don't buy It at all,

1016
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,310
but it's,
I've seen some people make that

1017
00:49:46,311 --> 00:49:47,510
argument.
It's horrifying.

1018
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,670
It's weird.
it's horrifying.

1019
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,860
So I agree.
I agree with you.

1020
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,930
You do have to worry about China,
but I think Australia is like,

1021
00:49:53,931 --> 00:49:55,550
ah,
it's fucking americans take care of it.

1022
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,560
So they think sorta,
except like their situation is that

1023
00:50:00,561 --> 00:50:04,310
they're enormously economic.
They're enormously dependent on China

1024
00:50:04,311 --> 00:50:07,760
economically and they love having that
money,

1025
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,480
but they seem to be a little bit like
sleep walking through history and not is

1026
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:17,480
at least some people that I spoke to it,
but that's.

1027
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:20,210
That's the real story in Australia is
China.

1028
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:21,920
Well,
I think

1029
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,190
when you're not a military might,
you know,

1030
00:50:25,191 --> 00:50:28,550
you're not like one of the big players.
you're kind of like sitting back

1031
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:29,930
watching because what are we going to
do?

1032
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:35,120
Like what if Australia decides to ramp
up its defense budget by 5,000 percent

1033
00:50:35,121 --> 00:50:40,121
over the next 10 years and develop a
crazy arsenal of weapons and super

1034
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:42,200
soldiers and shoot them all off the
steroids,

1035
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:44,900
give them exoskeletons and get ready to
go to war,

1036
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:49,330
start building bunkers and freak the
rest of the world out and take this like

1037
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:53,210
North Korea with money approach the
world in North Korea with money.

1038
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:56,030
Well,
norTh Korea is basically like this scary

1039
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,480
spot that nobody wants to invade even
though we know that there's a military

1040
00:50:59,481 --> 00:51:02,480
dictatorship there.
They have their weapons,

1041
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,600
we have nuclear weapons,
they have a madman who's in control.

1042
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,720
They have people that escaped with
horrific stories and we have a president

1043
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:11,180
who talks about them as if they're sort
of a normal country.

1044
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,340
Yeah.
Well the weird thing is like he might be

1045
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:17,750
able to sit down with them and actually
talked to them is his unconventional

1046
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:20,840
approach might actually lead to some
sort of communication at least.

1047
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,380
Which is better than nothing I guess,
but.

1048
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,580
But if.
I don't mean like in North Korea,

1049
00:51:25,581 --> 00:51:28,190
like they take over the country and in
prison it's people.

1050
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:30,770
I mean like they're,
they become kind of dangerous and

1051
00:51:30,771 --> 00:51:33,770
sketchy and small.
Like North Korea is not a military dick

1052
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,260
power.
Like in terms of like the way the soviet

1053
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:38,240
union is where they could take over the
world,

1054
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,260
but they're scared but they're
untouchable.

1055
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,570
Yeah,
exactly.

1056
00:51:41,571 --> 00:51:44,570
If Australia became that,
then I think we have a totally different

1057
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:46,390
attitude about Australia.
Australia,

1058
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,130
Australia is just laid back and they're
like,

1059
00:51:49,131 --> 00:51:51,350
hey,
americans take arabic and then we're

1060
00:51:51,351 --> 00:51:54,800
over here building fucking walls and
shooting missiles.

1061
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:58,130
Yeah.
I would imagine it would be really weird

1062
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,160
to watch us from afar if you were paying
attention to world politics

1063
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:04,850
because they know everything.
I mean,

1064
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:07,700
everyone I talked to there was like,
let's talk about gerrymandering in

1065
00:52:07,701 --> 00:52:08,860
Virginia,
and I'm like,

1066
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:15,410
what are you saying?
They have to follow what's going on here

1067
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,420
in ways that I found kind of amazing,
like genuinely actually gerrymandering

1068
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,100
in Virginia.
I was like,

1069
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,170
there,
don't you have the news going on for a

1070
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,430
year?
If the answer is sort of note.

1071
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,020
YeAh.

1072
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,810
Comedians move over there.
They move over there and become huge in

1073
00:52:30,811 --> 00:52:33,360
Australia.
Shout out to my friend,

1074
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,220
judge barker.
He's out there.

1075
00:52:35,221 --> 00:52:36,690
It's huge.
Gigantic over there.

1076
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,910
Like a lot of people don't know him here
in Australia.

1077
00:52:38,911 --> 00:52:41,340
He's like jerry seinfeld,
huge,

1078
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:44,130
enormous sells a huge auditoriums,

1079
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:47,510
but that's because when a giant american
celebrity comes over,

1080
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:49,790
they're just going to sell out
everything because that's the only game

1081
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,450
in town.
No,

1082
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:54,230
he's not a giant american celebrity.
He's an australian celebratory seinfeld.

1083
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,150
No barker.
I thought we're talking about jerry

1084
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:56,984
seinfeld.
I'm like,

1085
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,220
oh yeah,
I know you're into like alternative

1086
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:03,980
media platform that I think people know
seinfeld.

1087
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:06,590
It's no arch barker.
I'd never heard of him.

1088
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:07,460
There you go.
There you go.

1089
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:10,370
He's here to Australia.
When I talked to australians and they're

1090
00:53:10,371 --> 00:53:10,711
like,
oh,

1091
00:53:10,711 --> 00:53:12,480
you stand up comedian,
you know odg bucket.

1092
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,960
They're gonna be mad at me like Adam
Green.

1093
00:53:14,961 --> 00:53:15,681
She's gonna.
Be pissed.

1094
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:17,420
Right.
That fucking australian accents.

1095
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:18,740
Terrible brow.
It is bad.

1096
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,330
It's not good.
I don't even try.

1097
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,600
But have you been following the women's
march stuff at all or no?

1098
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,350
Yes.
Yes I have.

1099
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,070
Yeah,

1100
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,050
the uh,
antisemitic stuff.

1101
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

1102
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:32,820
Fucking groups.
You know when you have a group,

1103
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,400
you have a group of people and then you
have.

1104
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,690
That was a little bit to me as related
to the,

1105
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,640
what happened at the lincoln memorial,
right?

1106
00:53:40,641 --> 00:53:43,880
Where you had these,
you know,

1107
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,910
the leadership of the women's march,
which looked like a shepard fairey

1108
00:53:46,911 --> 00:53:49,400
poster come to life.
Like they were just perfect.

1109
00:53:49,401 --> 00:53:53,000
You had linda sarsour and her hijab
behind tamika mallory.

1110
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:58,550
what's going on is that back in August,
2017,

1111
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,610
I wrote a column called wouldn't
progressive's embrace hate,

1112
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,880
and it was saying I was super moved by
the women's march as so many other

1113
00:54:06,921 --> 00:54:07,970
women.
I know we're,

1114
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,130
but let's look at some of the very
troubling ideas and associations that

1115
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,610
the people who are in charge of the
leadership of the women's march have,

1116
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:20,660
namely the worst of the worst was tamika
mallory,

1117
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:22,730
who'd been in gun rights activists
beforehand.

1118
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:28,760
She called louis farrakhan the goat,
the greatest of all time.

1119
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:31,760
She took lots of instagram pictures.

1120
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:35,120
You should check this,
but she praised him.

1121
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:38,420
It wasn't like a casual acquaintance.
She praised him as the greatest of all

1122
00:54:38,421 --> 00:54:43,421
time and yet she was treated to glowing
profiles in every women's magazine,

1123
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,810
her and the rest of the leadership.
And I basically said like,

1124
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,790
let's look past,
you know,

1125
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:54,791
the benetton ad of these leaders and
actually look at what they believe and

1126
00:54:54,861 --> 00:54:58,250
what they believe.
Some of them is extremely disturbing,

1127
00:54:58,251 --> 00:55:01,310
especially when it comes to jews say,
write this column.

1128
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:04,340
And I'm like pilloried for it.
By the left.

1129
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:07,160
One of the leaders of the women's march,
this woman bob bland,

1130
00:55:07,161 --> 00:55:10,070
wrote this letter to the New York times
where she calls me,

1131
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,930
um,
it was amazing.

1132
00:55:11,931 --> 00:55:14,510
I want to find what it was.
Oh,

1133
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:17,120
she calls me an apologist for the status
quo,

1134
00:55:17,121 --> 00:55:20,840
racist ideology and the white
nationalist patriarchy because you

1135
00:55:20,841 --> 00:55:25,790
responded to someone because I said
greatest of all time is a man who called

1136
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:28,340
judaism termites who calls juice
termites,

1137
00:55:28,341 --> 00:55:31,970
who calls judaism a gutter religion,
who says that we should burn in ovens

1138
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:36,890
and who by the way is a massage and
homophobe also the leaders of the

1139
00:55:36,891 --> 00:55:40,790
women's march or associating with this
guy and had the nation of islam security

1140
00:55:40,791 --> 00:55:41,630
protecting them.

1141
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:46,520
I mean this is Like the most sort of
retro grade hate group and yet for

1142
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:48,660
calling them out,
I was called all of these things

1143
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,453
flies.

1144
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,870
That's a deep question.
I think that part of it is the fact that

1145
00:55:56,350 --> 00:56:01,350
in intersectional leftwing politics,
jews have been whitewashed.

1146
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:07,140
Jews are viewed as sort of the white
privileged power and part of the white

1147
00:56:07,751 --> 00:56:11,650
patriarchy and less.
They genuflect and say,

1148
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:12,940
actually,
no,

1149
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:13,870
we,
you know,

1150
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:17,200
we have poor our privilege and all of
the other things that you're supposed to

1151
00:56:17,201 --> 00:56:19,480
say,
and there's a blIndness to the fact

1152
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,910
great,
and there's a blindness to the fact that

1153
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:23,860
first of all,
not jews are white.

1154
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,130
Half of the jews in the state of Israel,
for example,

1155
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:30,550
are arab and from arab countries that
they were kicked out of a 19,

1156
00:56:30,551 --> 00:56:32,980
48.
I mean the idea that jews are white is

1157
00:56:32,981 --> 00:56:36,220
this canard.
Although I'm an ashkenazi jew,

1158
00:56:36,221 --> 00:56:40,480
I'm my family is from eastern europe.
I have white skin but I don't think of,

1159
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:43,600
and I have white privilege,
but I don't think of myself as white

1160
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:43,870
person.

1161
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:45,790
I think of myself as a jew first and
foremost,

1162
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:49,660
so it's a complicated identity,
but I think that it's sort of a.

1163
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:53,950
It's whitewashed by these people and I
think that antisemitism just isn't taken

1164
00:56:53,951 --> 00:56:58,930
seriously and doesn't rate because
people perceive jews as having privilege

1165
00:56:58,931 --> 00:57:01,480
and power in this country,
which largely they do.

1166
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,980
But the fact is is that the actual
statistics show that more hate crimes

1167
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:10,120
were committed against jews in the past
year than any other minority group.

1168
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:14,770
The fbi's like sounding the alarm every
other day in crown heights and in other

1169
00:57:14,771 --> 00:57:17,830
parts of brooklyn,
random jews who looked jewish,

1170
00:57:17,831 --> 00:57:19,060
right?
Who were hasidic.

1171
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:21,940
Jews are just beaten up for being
jewish.

1172
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:26,950
and yet everyone's ignoring that because
they're the imperfect victim will.

1173
00:57:26,951 --> 00:57:29,950
They're also very isolated.
They're very.

1174
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,370
They have their own tribe.
They stick with them,

1175
00:57:33,371 --> 00:57:35,380
they look different,
they dress different.

1176
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:37,900
Sure.
But imagine if any other minority group,

1177
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:38,340
someone.

1178
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,170
I mean,
we're outraged when we see at least i

1179
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:42,190
am.
And you are.

1180
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:46,570
When we see a police officer assaulting
someone,

1181
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,880
you know what I'm saying is the young
black person,

1182
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:52,150
they don't make a big deal to go into
the public about it.

1183
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:56,620
They keep it almost insulated inside
their environment and their community.

1184
00:57:57,070 --> 00:58:00,130
There's also,
what I was going to say is that these

1185
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,690
people that are,
that you do here saying antisemitic

1186
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:07,870
things,
they're equating american jews living in

1187
00:58:07,871 --> 00:58:12,010
America with the policies of Israel and
what Israel is doing with palestine.

1188
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,470
And that somehow if you're an american
jew,

1189
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:18,550
even if you're not even political,
you're somehow or another complicit with

1190
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:22,000
atrocities that are going on between the
jewish people and the palestinians,

1191
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:23,650
right?
Conflict,

1192
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:26,620
any kind of conflict.
And this makes it.

1193
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
It reinforces their idea about you being
a part of this group.

1194
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:34,510
Yes,
but they also straw men it and say,

1195
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,790
criticism of Israel is an antisemitic.

1196
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:39,940
No one's saying that criticism isn't of
Israel antisemitic.

1197
00:58:39,941 --> 00:58:44,050
I criticize Israel at the time,
but there's an obsession on the state of

1198
00:58:44,051 --> 00:58:46,090
Israel.
Like if you were an alien that landed

1199
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:49,000
from outer space,
you would think that the greatest

1200
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:52,480
oppressor in the world is this tiny
state that's the size of New Jersey.

1201
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:57,690
These people say nothing about the genet
generally about the genocide of weger

1202
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,910
muslims in China.
They say nothing about any number of

1203
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,280
even aware that,
oh,

1204
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:06,580
there's a genocide going on,
carried out by the government of China

1205
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:09,310
against weaker muslims.
They're literally being put into

1206
00:59:09,311 --> 00:59:12,250
concentration camps.
This is literally a first.

1207
00:59:12,251 --> 00:59:15,790
I've heard of this.
So [inaudible] is spelled you I g,

1208
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:17,010
h,
you are.

1209
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:19,990
Whereas a,
what is a good thing to read about the

1210
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:22,670
New York times that we've reported on
it,

1211
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:26,390
it's a,
it's an enormous story and it's like the

1212
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:31,391
fact that that's getting know that you
don't know about it and that people

1213
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,430
obsessive talk about the state of Israel
is if it's the and by the way the state

1214
00:59:37,431 --> 00:59:41,540
of Israel does lots of things wrong,
but the idea that it's among the worst

1215
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:43,550
human rights tragedies of our time.

1216
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:46,310
Are you kidding me?
It's insanity.

1217
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,370
I don't know the reality of what is
going on in gaza.

1218
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:54,700
I don't know what is happening with
Israel and palestine.

1219
00:59:54,701 --> 00:59:56,740
I don't know,
so I'm not going to be the person that

1220
00:59:56,741 --> 01:00:00,160
talks about this,
but what I do know some stuff to read,

1221
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:03,550
but I do know from people that have gone
there like abby martin,

1222
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,500
who,
who came back with some pretty horrific

1223
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,810
stories.
I think there's a lot of terrible shit

1224
01:00:07,811 --> 01:00:10,510
going on.
There's a lot of awful violence and

1225
01:00:10,511 --> 01:00:14,380
there's a lot of despair on the side of
the palestinians and I don't.

1226
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:19,420
I don't know who's to blame for that,
but many people blame the israelis.

1227
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:23,950
They blame the israelis for treating the
palestinians as if they're in this one

1228
01:00:23,951 --> 01:00:26,020
area of the world is essentially a large
prison.

1229
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,090
Well,
lots to say about this,

1230
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,690
but I think one of the main problems
that we have in the way that Israel is

1231
01:00:32,691 --> 01:00:37,691
covered is that if you have a camera
lens and you're only looking at a tiny

1232
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:42,050
piece of land,
right,

1233
01:00:42,051 --> 01:00:44,990
you're only looking at Israel proper.
The west bank and gaza,

1234
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:49,160
Israel to some extent is the goliath in
that situation,

1235
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,830
but if you zoom out your camera just a
little,

1236
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:57,250
you see that Israel is literally
surrounded on all sides by genocidal

1237
01:00:57,261 --> 01:00:59,630
regimes like in the form of hamas in
gaza,

1238
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:03,950
whose charter blamed the jews for
fomenting that.

1239
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,990
The french revolutions,
the russian revolutions,

1240
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:08,540
both world wars and says that it wants
to kill all the jews.

1241
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:11,810
That's what.
That's the government of gaza right now.

1242
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:15,680
I spoke to a mother who fled gaza
recently.

1243
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,780
okay.
And her family's house was just

1244
01:01:17,781 --> 01:01:19,520
destroyed.
Who was it destroyed by?

1245
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,290
Hamas,
not Israel.

1246
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:25,760
You never hear those storIes.
So I'm just saying it is a very

1247
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:29,120
complicated
politics,

1248
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:34,390
but when you see people obsessively
focusing on this one state and the

1249
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:40,031
crimes of this one state to the
exclusion of actual dictatorships in the

1250
01:01:40,401 --> 01:01:45,200
world who are killing their own people,
you have to be suspicious of that.

1251
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:49,780
You do have to be suspicious and you do
have to be aware of their position in

1252
01:01:49,781 --> 01:01:54,370
the world surrounded by arab states.
When you do have to realize that they

1253
01:01:54,371 --> 01:01:57,010
are there,
they're alone out there.

1254
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,190
You also,
I do wonder,

1255
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:05,230
what is the motivation for so many
people focusing on jews?

1256
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,870
What is it like?
What do you think it is as a jewish

1257
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,390
person?
What do you think the motivation for

1258
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:14,710
this kind of racism and discrimination
against jews and why is it tolerated?

1259
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,080
Why?
Why can someone like louis farrakhan

1260
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:20,010
tweet that jews are in

1261
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,120
his twitter account,
stays up.

1262
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:23,670
It's the olDest hatred in the world,
right?

1263
01:02:23,671 --> 01:02:25,350
a lot of exam what it is.
No,

1264
01:02:25,351 --> 01:02:25,741
no,
no.

1265
01:02:25,741 --> 01:02:27,570
You're asking me why is it still with
us?

1266
01:02:27,571 --> 01:02:30,090
It's like the mystery of history like
that is.

1267
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,470
That is deep.
I mean,

1268
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:34,320
that is something that goes back to the
new testament.

1269
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:37,650
Okay.
The jews were blamed in the book of john

1270
01:02:37,651 --> 01:02:38,221
and mark.
I mean,

1271
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:42,090
we could go to matthew for the death of
jesus.

1272
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:46,350
Their role in that story,
at least according to some of the books,

1273
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:51,140
is that they convinced the most powerful
empire at the time,

1274
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:53,970
the roman empire in the form of the
governor of judea,

1275
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:58,971
punches pilot to kill the son of god.
That becomes sort of the template for

1276
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,910
the antisemitic conspiracy theory.
There's,

1277
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,370
there's a confusion about what
antisemitism is,

1278
01:03:05,371 --> 01:03:07,080
right?
It's not just a hate.

1279
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:08,130
It's not just like this.

1280
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:11,670
Hate of a group racist perceived
themselves as punching down against a

1281
01:03:11,671 --> 01:03:16,230
group that's lesser antisemites perceive
themselves as punching up against the

1282
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:21,231
secret cabal of wildly operators who
secretly controlled the leavers of

1283
01:03:21,271 --> 01:03:24,300
power.
That is the canard of antisemitism,

1284
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:29,340
and that begins with this group that's
able somehow to get the roman empire to

1285
01:03:29,341 --> 01:03:30,390
kill jesus.
Now,

1286
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:33,150
the catholic church disavows this in
1965,

1287
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:38,600
which was an enormous historical event,
but that template is still there and you

1288
01:03:39,571 --> 01:03:43,050
see it play out right in who?
Who led us into the war in Iraq,

1289
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,600
it was the jews of the bush
administration.

1290
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:50,370
You can see it play itself out all over
the place and right now in the

1291
01:03:50,371 --> 01:03:53,250
demonology of current contemporary
antisemitism,

1292
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:56,340
Israel has sort of been made into the
jew among the nations.

1293
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:00,480
You're not allowed to say anymore.
It's like the old school antisemitism,

1294
01:04:00,481 --> 01:04:02,160
right?
Like I grew up in a place where there

1295
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:04,170
was some country clubs where jews
couldn't go into them.

1296
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:07,440
That frankly,
that's not dangerous.

1297
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,740
What's dangerous is the kind of
antisemitism that says,

1298
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:12,960
you know,
this one state in the world of all of

1299
01:04:12,961 --> 01:04:14,460
the,
almost 200 states,

1300
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:16,680
that's the one that doesn't have the
right to exist.

1301
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:18,630
That's the one that should be
dismantled.

1302
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,720
That's actually dangerous to jewish
lives right now.

1303
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:22,653
It is.
Um,

1304
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,610
it's an unusual group in that it is both
a religion and a tribe.

1305
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,550
Yes.
It makes us very hard to understand in

1306
01:04:29,551 --> 01:04:32,280
the contemporary landscape because we
are not just a religion.

1307
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:35,670
There's nothing else like it.
Because most jews that I know do not

1308
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,830
practice judaism.
Right.

1309
01:04:37,831 --> 01:04:42,510
And yet they choose us because we were a
people hood before we were a religion.

1310
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:47,700
Religion is a very contemporary,
modern thing that jews are sort of

1311
01:04:47,701 --> 01:04:50,670
slotted into and it makes us easier to
understand.

1312
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:54,240
But then our,
our sort of national identity or

1313
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:57,600
peoplehood,
our tribalism is left out and that's an

1314
01:04:57,601 --> 01:04:59,460
essential part of who the jews are.

1315
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,880
My friend ari shaffir,
who's a fantastic stand up comedian,

1316
01:05:02,881 --> 01:05:07,881
he's a rabid atheists,
but he's also very jewish and he has a

1317
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:12,050
new hour that he's working on right now
that is going to film called jew.

1318
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,660
I want to see it,
but he's,

1319
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:18,640
you know,
he's a perfect example is a tribe.

1320
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:22,780
It's not just a religion,
but it's also because the jewish

1321
01:05:22,781 --> 01:05:24,640
religion itself,
the emphasis,

1322
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,760
the emphasis is not on what you believe.
The emphasis is on deeds.

1323
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:32,410
It almost doesn't matter what you
believe.

1324
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:36,020
It matters that you follow,
hahaha.

1325
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:39,760
Which is jewish law matters your deeds.
It matters all these things.

1326
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:44,910
So it's possible to be a good jew and
not really think about god that much,

1327
01:05:45,161 --> 01:05:46,690
which is very strange.
I understand.

1328
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:51,740
To christian ears or you go full ben
shapiro where he's both a good jew and

1329
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:55,930
very much like follows the whole deal
the whole deal,

1330
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:56,853
the whole deal.

1331
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:59,040
Um.
Why do you say that?

1332
01:05:59,060 --> 01:05:59,861
I think.
Sorry,

1333
01:05:59,861 --> 01:06:03,970
can I say one more place?
I just find it like kind of astonishing

1334
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,680
the blindness to this because imagine a
leader of the women's march said

1335
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:10,870
something like,
you know,

1336
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:14,380
I think louis ck is the greatest
comedian of all time even though I

1337
01:06:14,381 --> 01:06:15,400
disavow x,
y,

1338
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:18,760
and z thing that he did.
How fast to let person was kicked out of

1339
01:06:18,761 --> 01:06:23,260
the leadership of the women's march.
It would be like minutes hours.

1340
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:26,350
Yes.
I think there are certain things that

1341
01:06:26,351 --> 01:06:31,000
get people outraged and other much worse
things that do not.

1342
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:35,410
And I'm fascinated by why that is.
Do you think that if it was a white

1343
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:38,530
person that had this opinion about the
jews,

1344
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:43,180
that it would be more scrutinized?
I think thAt it is much easier to fight

1345
01:06:43,181 --> 01:06:45,910
antisemitism when it comes in the form
of Richard Spencer.

1346
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:46,744
Yes.

1347
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:50,800
Because then there's liberal consensus,
right?

1348
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:54,700
About him.
He's have a green light to criticize.

1349
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:58,030
It is much harder when,
when an an.

1350
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:01,150
Exactly.
it's much harder when someone like ilhan

1351
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:03,130
omar,
the new freshman senator.

1352
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,031
Uh,
sorry.

1353
01:07:04,031 --> 01:07:06,050
Not senator,
the new freshman congresswoman for

1354
01:07:06,051 --> 01:07:09,430
Minnesota who's like this incredible
american dream story comes here at 12

1355
01:07:09,431 --> 01:07:11,020
years old,
refugee from Somalia,

1356
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:13,330
wears a hijab,
is a mother,

1357
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:15,850
is the first woman of color representing
Minnesota.

1358
01:07:15,851 --> 01:07:20,851
Like obviously I want to cheer her.
That's my reaction to her and yet she

1359
01:07:21,761 --> 01:07:25,930
has this tweet that she refused to
apologize is four where she says,

1360
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:29,680
Israel is hypnotize.
The world may all awake in the world to

1361
01:07:29,681 --> 01:07:32,230
the evil doings of Israel.
I'm sorry.

1362
01:07:32,231 --> 01:07:36,520
That's a classically antiseMitic trope.
Even if she said it unwittingly and by

1363
01:07:36,521 --> 01:07:39,400
this point she should have known she
should eduCate herself.

1364
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:43,240
So it's very,
it's much harder to criticize that,

1365
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:45,820
but it's,
it's an untenable position to say that

1366
01:07:45,821 --> 01:07:49,090
you can't criticize someone for their
ideas because of their identity.

1367
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:52,210
It also seems like a road to nowhere
you're going to say that.

1368
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:55,780
That is a very vague thing to say.
You should be incredibly specific.

1369
01:07:56,230 --> 01:08:00,400
Have you want to say it's evil,
you should say what's evil and then open

1370
01:08:00,401 --> 01:08:02,530
that up to some sort of a discussion or
debate,

1371
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:07,560
but as describing supernatural evil
powers to a state is very much recalling

1372
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:13,890
classic antisemetic canards.
Right.

1373
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,100
So with that I read,
I wrote a piece about this today,

1374
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:20,510
trying to like explain that to people
because she went on cnn saying,

1375
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,210
I don't know how jewish americans could
be offended by this,

1376
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:24,590
which I think is incredible.

1377
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,480
Cool.
Yeah.

1378
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:27,300
What do you think if.
I mean,

1379
01:08:27,301 --> 01:08:31,620
if you want to be objective as I mean
step outside of your jewish identity,

1380
01:08:31,621 --> 01:08:36,621
what do you think is wrong with how
Israel is dealing with the palestinian

1381
01:08:37,231 --> 01:08:41,810
situation?
Because this is the big criticisM of

1382
01:08:41,811 --> 01:08:44,300
Israel.
The only criticism really that's the big

1383
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:46,460
one.
The big one is gaza and palestine.

1384
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,020
So what do you think they're doing
wrong?

1385
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:49,770
Palestine meaning the west bank?
Yes.

1386
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:54,060
Well,
I would say what the untenable position

1387
01:08:54,061 --> 01:08:56,910
that they're in is that they are
oCcupying another people.

1388
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,930
That is what is going on in the west
bank and I've been there many times,

1389
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:04,530
met with many palestinians.
I've really educated myself on this.

1390
01:09:05,070 --> 01:09:07,620
The problem is is that,
and by the way,

1391
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:10,380
it's not all of palestine.
There's all the west bank,

1392
01:09:10,381 --> 01:09:11,750
there's areas a,
b and c.

1393
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,700
It's a really like we'd have to pull up
a map.

1394
01:09:14,701 --> 01:09:17,670
It's a pretty complicated thinG.
There are places where it's much more

1395
01:09:17,671 --> 01:09:20,680
autonomous and the pa's in charge and
it,

1396
01:09:20,681 --> 01:09:24,630
it really varies depending on the area,
so the big criticism,

1397
01:09:24,631 --> 01:09:28,080
right is that they're occupying and
other people and that is corrosive to

1398
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,720
the state of Israel,
sort of morally like to,

1399
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:34,200
to occupy and other people.
On the other hand,

1400
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:37,590
what happens if they pull out of the
west bank tomorrow?

1401
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:40,800
Right.
I'm for a two state solution ultimately

1402
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:43,200
ending the occupation,
but if I'm real,

1403
01:09:43,201 --> 01:09:45,930
I have to be honest about what that
would look like.

1404
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:49,190
WHat would it look like in gaza?
Is that now you have a terrorist state

1405
01:09:49,191 --> 01:09:52,350
lit right at the border which is ruled
by hamas.

1406
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:56,880
It is quite likely that that very same
thing could happen in the west bank.

1407
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:59,400
Now let's say actually we actually
should pull up a map.

1408
01:09:59,401 --> 01:10:04,170
Let's say Israel does that.
Then like the whole of Israel proper is

1409
01:10:04,171 --> 01:10:08,580
something like we have to look two miles
wide.

1410
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:10,051
We actually,
yeah,

1411
01:10:10,051 --> 01:10:15,051
we should look at the,
the distance between like tool car,

1412
01:10:15,221 --> 01:10:17,100
um,
or like the end of the west bank and

1413
01:10:17,101 --> 01:10:19,650
natanya or tel aviv and you see how
small that is.

1414
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:25,440
I mean it's hard to even conceive of it
if you were in charge of Protecting the

1415
01:10:25,441 --> 01:10:28,770
security of the people who live in
places,

1416
01:10:28,771 --> 01:10:31,500
which by the way,
10 years ago when in the year after high

1417
01:10:31,501 --> 01:10:34,140
school when I was living there,
there were suicide bombings blowing up

1418
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:36,840
in cafes around the corner from where I
lived.

1419
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:40,800
Or you going to subject those people to
that risk.

1420
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,640
I mean that's the,
that's the actual question facing the

1421
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:45,930
government of Israel,
which by the way,

1422
01:10:45,931 --> 01:10:48,930
I'm extremely critical of and if I lived
in Israel,

1423
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:51,720
I'd be voting center left in Israel for
sure,

1424
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:55,710
but that is what they're facing.
And then if you zoom out and you pull up

1425
01:10:55,711 --> 01:10:57,900
a map of all of the countries around it,

1426
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,410
I just want to look.

1427
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:02,980
Sorry.

1428
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:03,401
No,
iT's okay.

1429
01:11:03,401 --> 01:11:07,420
Actually the one you were on was good
because it showed if you zoomed out it

1430
01:11:07,421 --> 01:11:08,254
had everything,

1431
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,100
so you have Egypt there,
then you have Jordan,

1432
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,500
which is teetering,
then you Syria,

1433
01:11:13,501 --> 01:11:17,100
then you of Lebanon and hIs bellows on
the southern border of Lebanon,

1434
01:11:17,101 --> 01:11:19,040
which is constantly,
you know,

1435
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:24,050
so that's the real thing.
So when people talk about this fantasy

1436
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:28,650
of why can't it just look like America,
why can't there just be a democratic one

1437
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:30,150
state solution?
First of all,

1438
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:32,250
no one wants it.
They pull people constantly.

1439
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,900
But the second thing is like step really
what that's gonna look like if we

1440
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:41,370
dismantle the state of Israel or is it
going to look like enormous bloodshed?

1441
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,820
The likes of which we see in a lot of
these countries surrounding it.

1442
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:50,420
Like someone once said to me that if you
want to know the word for,

1443
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:52,470
you know,
a jew without a military,

1444
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,480
it's the [inaudible].
Okay.

1445
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:55,710
It's these eds.
It's the people.

1446
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:58,800
It's the minorities in the middle east
who had been absolutely

1447
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,310
destroyed and overrun.

1448
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:03,570
ANd this is like,
it's.

1449
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,540
I don't think when americans talk about
this part of the world,

1450
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:11,690
they fully appreciate this sort of
absolutely painful and hard decisions

1451
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:17,190
and the grappling with violence really,
you know,

1452
01:12:17,191 --> 01:12:20,370
what happened to jamal [inaudible] shogi
and that saudi embassy that's like

1453
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:25,140
normative for this part of the world.
So the fact that Israel has somehow with

1454
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:28,740
all of its flaws,
managed to eke out a western style

1455
01:12:28,741 --> 01:12:31,830
liberal democracy,
frankly the only place where you and I

1456
01:12:31,831 --> 01:12:35,010
would feel happy and comfortable living.
Like,

1457
01:12:35,011 --> 01:12:37,500
why are we never talking about that?
Well,

1458
01:12:37,501 --> 01:12:40,410
I think it's very difficult for people
to find the forum,

1459
01:12:40,411 --> 01:12:45,411
to discuss it the way you just did and
to to really lay it out in cold,

1460
01:12:46,771 --> 01:12:50,640
stark reality.
What is the solution?

1461
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,880
What is the solution?
There is no magic.

1462
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:59,190
The solution right now is to do
everything possible to build up the

1463
01:12:59,191 --> 01:13:03,480
palestinian economy to for Israel to
build relationships.

1464
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,890
Like right now,
it has a very,

1465
01:13:04,891 --> 01:13:08,250
very positive relationships with Egypt,
which gave back the sinai,

1466
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:10,350
which had had one in the six day,
six day war,

1467
01:13:10,351 --> 01:13:12,900
I believe,
gave it back to Egypt for a cold piece,

1468
01:13:12,901 --> 01:13:16,530
which it's had,
it has a good relationship of all

1469
01:13:16,531 --> 01:13:18,360
things.
Who would have thought with Saudi Arabia

1470
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:20,120
because of their common enemy?
Iran.

1471
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:22,200
I mean things shift.
They're rapidly,

1472
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:23,443
um,
but,

1473
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:28,170
but as for the palestinians,
the solution is to build up the economy,

1474
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:33,260
make life better and support people and
movements inside the west bank that are

1475
01:13:33,781 --> 01:13:37,890
genuinely nonviolent.
And those people exist.

1476
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,420
It's just frankly,
oftentimes they're murdered by groups

1477
01:13:42,421 --> 01:13:44,760
like hamas and their bodies are dragged
through the streets.

1478
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,360
If you're accused of being an israeli
collaborator in the west bank,

1479
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,520
you know what happens to you,
your lynched?

1480
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,440
No one talks about that.
No,

1481
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:54,570
no one does talk about that.

1482
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:59,630
What would you be open to discussing
this in this sort of a form with that

1483
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:04,080
woman from the women's march a.
Sure.

1484
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:05,820
Do you think she would do something like
that?

1485
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:07,110
I don't know.
I'd be open to it.

1486
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:10,890
Do you think that people like her have
ever had a conversation with someone

1487
01:14:10,891 --> 01:14:13,830
like you who could lay it out?
No,

1488
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:18,130
because I think that first of all,
many people who talk about this issue

1489
01:14:18,131 --> 01:14:23,131
have sort of exported aMerican domestic
politics to a foreign region of the

1490
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:28,530
world.
Like in a way that this is talked about

1491
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:29,850
a lot.
It's like the oppressor,

1492
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:31,270
the oppressed,
the white,

1493
01:14:31,271 --> 01:14:32,110
the blaCk.
No,

1494
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:34,960
that's not what's going on.
I don't think people understand when

1495
01:14:34,961 --> 01:14:38,500
they talk about israeli jews that half
of them are middle eastern,

1496
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:42,070
like half of israeli jews are arab,
you know,

1497
01:14:42,071 --> 01:14:44,410
there's no appreciation of that reality.

1498
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:47,690
They think that Israel was just founded,
you know,

1499
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:51,520
to save the remnant of the jews who
weren't destroyed in the holocaust and

1500
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:54,520
yeah,
it helped for those who survived,

1501
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:57,040
but then once the state of Israel was
established,

1502
01:14:57,370 --> 01:15:02,350
there was a mass exodus of the jews from
all of the arab countries where they had

1503
01:15:02,351 --> 01:15:06,160
been living as second class citizens
where they are either self deported

1504
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:08,860
because they were living at as second
class citizens or they were expelled.

1505
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:11,170
again,
that exodus,

1506
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:16,500
that deportation never talked about.
I'd be happy to talk about this with

1507
01:15:16,841 --> 01:15:18,850
someone from the women's march.
What is the,

1508
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,450
what is the response currently like
what,

1509
01:15:21,451 --> 01:15:24,280
what?
What is the current position that most

1510
01:15:24,281 --> 01:15:28,180
people were taking about that woman and
about the woman's march in general

1511
01:15:28,181 --> 01:15:30,320
because of these things because of these
analysts,

1512
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:34,540
antisemitic statements.
I think a lot of people in the past few

1513
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:36,160
weeks,
thanks in part to meghan mccain,

1514
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:39,610
had five minutes on the view with tamika
mallory and bob land and she did an

1515
01:15:39,611 --> 01:15:42,610
amazing job grilling them on the view.

1516
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,520
The view is what's changed?
It's amazing.

1517
01:15:45,521 --> 01:15:47,980
I know,
but she did an amazing job because,

1518
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:53,250
because frankly because their image was
so powerful in the same way that the

1519
01:15:53,411 --> 01:15:55,450
image of the lincoln memorial was so
powerful,

1520
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:58,870
journalists just sort of accepted it and
didn't interrogate that.

1521
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:04,680
Who doesn't want to support that?
But it's our job to be skeptical and

1522
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:05,630
criticize.
Right?

1523
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,650
So I think finally a lot of people woke
up to it.

1524
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:09,851
Um,
but again,

1525
01:16:09,851 --> 01:16:13,870
I wrote that column in August,
2017 and it took until now everything in

1526
01:16:13,871 --> 01:16:15,760
that column is the thing people are
talking about.

1527
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:19,780
There was also an amazing 10,000 word
expos and tablet magazine and jewish

1528
01:16:19,781 --> 01:16:22,000
online magazine that did a lot of that
work,

1529
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:25,630
so I think it did reach a tipping point.
The thing that is,

1530
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,530
um,
I see a lot of my friends on the left

1531
01:16:29,531 --> 01:16:33,850
who are jewish grappling with is that
they so desperately want to be a part of

1532
01:16:33,851 --> 01:16:38,851
these movements that they're willing to
sort of check their identity at the door

1533
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:41,560
in order to gain entry.

1534
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:47,140
And my thing is any progressive movement
that's asking you to check your jewish

1535
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:49,690
identity at the door,
your full jewish identity,

1536
01:16:49,691 --> 01:16:52,150
which is acknowledging that we're not
just a faith,

1537
01:16:52,151 --> 01:16:55,330
but we're at people.
We're not just people that like have

1538
01:16:55,331 --> 01:16:57,490
matzah ball soup or something bigger
than that.

1539
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,130
That's not a space I want to be a part
of.

1540
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:02,140
They would never ask that.
If any other group.

1541
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:05,200
Why us?
Why?

1542
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:06,660
Why do they ask that?
That,

1543
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,320
that,
that's what the real question.

1544
01:17:08,321 --> 01:17:09,800
I really think.
Well,

1545
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:11,450
no,
I think a lot of it goes back to what I

1546
01:17:11,451 --> 01:17:14,600
was saying before,
which is this misunderstanding if you

1547
01:17:14,601 --> 01:17:17,240
see the world in an intersectional way.
Okay,

1548
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:21,410
not is intersectionality was originally
meant to be,

1549
01:17:21,411 --> 01:17:25,160
but how it functions in the world,
it functions as a caste system and the

1550
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:29,240
higher you are on the victim scale,
at least on the left and it's reversed

1551
01:17:29,241 --> 01:17:30,470
on the right,
right on the right.

1552
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,140
It's like white,
cis gendered men are at the top on the

1553
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:36,980
left there at the bottom and the jews or
somewhere close down to there at least

1554
01:17:36,981 --> 01:17:40,510
in the way that the left the left.
I mean this part of the left,

1555
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,770
we're talking about the fringe at least
for now.

1556
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,610
Perceive the jews to be the woke left.
Yeah.

1557
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,350
The jews are not.
The jews don't rate.

1558
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:52,640
The jews don't have a place in that
victim scale because they have achieved

1559
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:57,470
so much success because they can pass as
white because of any number of things

1560
01:17:57,950 --> 01:18:00,500
and so I think that that's a huge reason
for it,

1561
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:05,510
which is a huge reason why I think
intersectionality is a dead end and why

1562
01:18:05,511 --> 01:18:09,170
we need to be talking about ideas and
not identity.

1563
01:18:09,171 --> 01:18:10,010
Right.
Like that.

1564
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:14,390
That is the thing about America that is
so amazing and like,

1565
01:18:14,391 --> 01:18:16,400
I know it sounds cheesy,
but I really feel it.

1566
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:21,790
That makes us so special.
We are not a country based on blood and

1567
01:18:22,401 --> 01:18:25,430
soil.
We are a country whose national common

1568
01:18:25,431 --> 01:18:29,390
identity is based on ascribing to a
common set of ideas.

1569
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:33,980
That is what we're about and so any
politics that's insisting from the left

1570
01:18:33,981 --> 01:18:37,850
or the right that no,
actually what we are is this warring set

1571
01:18:37,851 --> 01:18:40,340
of groups competing for scarce
resources?

1572
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,320
Absolutely not.
To me,

1573
01:18:42,321 --> 01:18:44,240
those kinds of politics are unamerican.

1574
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:47,580
I couldn't agree more in terms of
identity.

1575
01:18:47,581 --> 01:18:51,120
I think identity politics and the idea
that you belong to a group is so

1576
01:18:51,121 --> 01:18:55,410
intoxicating but so dangerous.
It'S so important to treat people as

1577
01:18:55,411 --> 01:18:57,570
individuals.
It's so important to think of yourself

1578
01:18:57,571 --> 01:19:02,571
as an individual and this,
this need to become a part of this group

1579
01:19:02,611 --> 01:19:06,240
in a signal to that group is a big part
of the problem that we're having right

1580
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:06,940
now

1581
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:08,980
and it doesn't mean that you can't have
pride.

1582
01:19:08,981 --> 01:19:13,981
Like I have tremendous pride the most in
being a jew and like jonathan heit talks

1583
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:18,730
so brilliantly about good identity
politics and bad identity politics that

1584
01:19:18,731 --> 01:19:23,620
good identity politics says,
walk with me in my shoes.

1585
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,250
It's like a big tent sort of thing.
It says,

1586
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:31,360
come along with me while I explained to
you my experience in the world that

1587
01:19:31,361 --> 01:19:35,920
identity politics says you can never
escape the gender of the racial,

1588
01:19:35,921 --> 01:19:39,790
the economic lane you were born into and
don't even try and understand me because

1589
01:19:39,791 --> 01:19:41,560
you couldn't possibly.
That's bad.

1590
01:19:41,561 --> 01:19:45,970
Identity politics and I think that
that's enforced and rising right now in

1591
01:19:45,971 --> 01:19:48,670
the country.
and I think that that's dangerous and

1592
01:19:48,671 --> 01:19:51,220
I've been thinking about it a lot
because it's martin luther king day and

1593
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:56,410
he said this unbelievable thing about.
I think it's actually in the.

1594
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:59,410
I had a dream speech,
but where he talks about the,

1595
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:04,810
the promissory note of the constitution
and the declaration of independence,

1596
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:07,260
right?
That these people who wrote it,

1597
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:11,160
who were slave owners didn't even know
that in writing it.

1598
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:14,820
That every american was going to fall
heir to this promissory note.

1599
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:19,260
And it's like he saw himself even in
documents that were written by people

1600
01:20:19,261 --> 01:20:24,261
who would not have seen them as fully
human as a way of sort of using that

1601
01:20:24,481 --> 01:20:28,680
common set of values,
those common documents to like write

1602
01:20:28,681 --> 01:20:31,590
himself into the story.
Like that is an example of,

1603
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:32,340
uh,
of,

1604
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:37,340
of inclusive identity politics and like
calling on the thing that we have in

1605
01:20:38,101 --> 01:20:42,270
common too wide in the tent.
And I just don't see a lot of that

1606
01:20:42,271 --> 01:20:44,520
happening these days.
I really butchered that.

1607
01:20:44,521 --> 01:20:45,930
But everyone should look up to,
you know,

1608
01:20:45,931 --> 01:20:47,100
I did.
If you look up,

1609
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:51,000
jonathan heit gave a speech,
I think you can find the whole text of

1610
01:20:51,001 --> 01:20:52,840
it at city journal.
Um,

1611
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:56,280
but if you just look up jonathan heit,
good identity politics,

1612
01:20:56,281 --> 01:20:58,470
martin luther king,
he does an amazing job.

1613
01:20:58,471 --> 01:21:00,270
It's,
it's really moving

1614
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:03,410
his book,
the happiness hypothesis.

1615
01:21:03,411 --> 01:21:04,740
I'm,
I'm in the middle of it right now.

1616
01:21:04,741 --> 01:21:06,540
It's so good.
It's so fantastic.

1617
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:10,190
It's so crucial for people that want to
understand their own personal biases and

1618
01:21:10,191 --> 01:21:12,520
what's coming and saying he's amazing.
He was on here last week.

1619
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,290
I thought he was incredible.
He is the,

1620
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,583
the,
the,

1621
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,680
the idea of having pride in something
is,

1622
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:20,980
is interesting,
right?

1623
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:23,430
You know,
there's a lot of people that have pride

1624
01:21:23,431 --> 01:21:26,630
for their ethnicity,
although they had nothing to do with,

1625
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:29,640
with choosing it.
It's just something that they're born

1626
01:21:29,641 --> 01:21:32,670
with.
I think people get nervous about that

1627
01:21:32,671 --> 01:21:35,520
kind of pride,
but I think there should be a settling.

1628
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:39,660
It would be wonderful if we could keep
all of these cultures and yet all

1629
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:43,740
appreciate each other as equals.
It'd be wonderful if you could go and

1630
01:21:43,741 --> 01:21:47,160
eat ethiopian food one day or cuban food
the next day and they,

1631
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:49,860
these people exist in the small.
That's the beauty of this.

1632
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:51,600
Now.
You can right now you can,

1633
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:56,480
but as we get more and more homogenized,
I wonder if you will be able to

1634
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,820
wait more homogenized or more insistent
on you have to stay in your lane.

1635
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:01,890
There's both,
both things.

1636
01:22:01,891 --> 01:22:04,980
I think we're definitely cooking off the
bacteria as well.

1637
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:10,140
Where we're wearing homogenization is
where we're making things safer and

1638
01:22:10,441 --> 01:22:15,330
easier for everybody and you know,
there's some messiness,

1639
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:19,470
messiness to cultures exchanging with
each other,

1640
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:21,700
but it is also fantastic.
Very excited

1641
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:25,300
to say I loved Australia,
but when I get off that plane and I

1642
01:22:25,301 --> 01:22:30,250
landed at like a shitty as they are at
jfk or laguardia and I see like every

1643
01:22:30,251 --> 01:22:32,410
kind of human being on the planet,
you know,

1644
01:22:32,411 --> 01:22:34,900
and like I walk everyday from I live,
um,

1645
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,610
I live in manhattan and I walked to
work.

1646
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:40,870
They are in bag everyday.
It just helps me decompress and the kind

1647
01:22:40,871 --> 01:22:45,280
of like the diversity of people on the
sidewalk of midtown manhattan.

1648
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:49,060
It's amazing.
I find it to be the most exciting thing

1649
01:22:49,061 --> 01:22:53,380
in the world and the fact that we're
able to live amongst such difference and

1650
01:22:53,381 --> 01:22:57,640
not kill each other.
Angeles is what drives,

1651
01:22:57,970 --> 01:23:00,430
you know,
you don't have that or you drive there.

1652
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:02,170
I love it heRe,
but that's why I couldn't live here.

1653
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:04,880
Well no one walks.
Everyone's locked in together in their.

1654
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:08,470
They Stay in their neighborhood and they
drive out to go somewhere else and they

1655
01:23:08,471 --> 01:23:10,360
don't even interact with each other on
the street.

1656
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:13,270
One of the things about the subway in,
one of the things about walking on the

1657
01:23:13,271 --> 01:23:16,510
street is everybody's together.
Everyone's Together.

1658
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:20,890
And there's this,
this interesting melting pot of human

1659
01:23:20,891 --> 01:23:23,920
beings that exist in New York.
It doesn't exist anywhere else in that

1660
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:26,620
form.
Like boston is so much more white.

1661
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:28,870
It's so much more.
I mean there's a lot of ethnicities and.

1662
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,370
But it's,
it's not the same.

1663
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:33,790
New york is fucking flavorful.
There's a lot of shit going on.

1664
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:38,560
It's a lot of great parts to it.
It's also what concerns me is that

1665
01:23:38,561 --> 01:23:40,900
people in New York are uniquely hostile.
And then.

1666
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:42,573
Yeah,
for sure,

1667
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:47,480
very nice.
But a lot of people that I'm even

1668
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:48,950
friends with from New York,
I'm like,

1669
01:23:48,951 --> 01:23:51,230
you mother fuckers are stacked on top of
each other too much.

1670
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:52,730
You like you,
you don'T.

1671
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:54,110
People aren't unique.

1672
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:55,960
Like would it be fair?
I'm from pittsburgh.

1673
01:23:55,961 --> 01:23:58,020
So you might be getting that like
midwestern flavor.

1674
01:23:58,021 --> 01:23:59,140
I bet that's exactly what it is,

1675
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,380
is pittsburgh's different.
Little more relaxed,

1676
01:24:01,381 --> 01:24:05,260
leSs people have to count on each other
more and fucking snow gets you.

1677
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,350
It gets rough out there.
You know,

1678
01:24:07,351 --> 01:24:09,990
it's not like you're,
you're not in a city the same way.

1679
01:24:09,991 --> 01:24:12,570
It's not.
You got to drive places so different,

1680
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:14,270
you know.
That is very midwest,

1681
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:15,570
pittsburgh,
very midwest,

1682
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:17,400
nice place.
I like pittsburgh,

1683
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,800
but New York,
I love New York,

1684
01:24:19,950 --> 01:24:24,950
but New York always makes me feel like
when you have that many people slammed

1685
01:24:25,411 --> 01:24:28,620
on top of each other,
you're in this completely unnatural

1686
01:24:28,621 --> 01:24:33,621
environment that literally has never
existed in human nature up until a few

1687
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,580
hundred years ago.
Never happened like that and now it's

1688
01:24:35,581 --> 01:24:39,720
unprecedented because there's more and
more people there that just buzzing and

1689
01:24:39,721 --> 01:24:41,050
they're putting these buildings up.
We've.

1690
01:24:41,051 --> 01:24:43,380
You've got 100 floors.
My friend jim norton talks about it all

1691
01:24:43,381 --> 01:24:46,030
the time because he lives in a building
because I don't know a fucking person in

1692
01:24:46,031 --> 01:24:46,500
my building.

1693
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,480
Thousand people in the spirit living in
a building like that.

1694
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:50,460
I could never live in a high rise
building.

1695
01:24:50,461 --> 01:24:52,380
It freaks me out too.
what do you live in?

1696
01:24:52,381 --> 01:24:54,870
Like a small walk?
Brownstone.

1697
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:59,130
that's a good move.
That's a good move up.

1698
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,113
Sucks,
but the.

1699
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:02,940
But knowing your neighbor like I.
Yeah.

1700
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:04,650
I also think as an adolescent,
freak me out

1701
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:06,870
as an intellectual,
as a person like yourself,

1702
01:25:06,871 --> 01:25:10,710
I think it's incredible important to,
to experience this.

1703
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:16,610
There's an exchange of cultures and a
thought thought in New York that you

1704
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:18,900
just don't get.
You don't get on the west coast.

1705
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:23,130
it's also not entertainment based.
There's a frivolousness to the thought

1706
01:25:23,131 --> 01:25:26,070
process out here that's flavored by the
desire for fame.

1707
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:28,870
Avoidable.
But the one thing I'll say is that,

1708
01:25:28,871 --> 01:25:30,850
yeah,
it's important for that and I find it so

1709
01:25:30,851 --> 01:25:33,040
energizing New York,
all the reasons you said,

1710
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:36,970
but I also have to force myself to get
out of the bubble.

1711
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:37,953
You know,
like

1712
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,880
I go home to pittsburgh and I hear a lot
more oftentimes political and

1713
01:25:45,341 --> 01:25:49,480
intellectual diversity than I hear
sometimes in a week in New York.

1714
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:50,950
Right?
Because everyone's left.

1715
01:25:51,370 --> 01:25:52,700
most people,
everyone in the.

1716
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,750
Most of my friends are not everyone but
everyone.

1717
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:56,650
Just conservative people in New York
obviously,

1718
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:59,890
but it's certainly norman ever left
leaning,

1719
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:01,980
leaning city,
Oregon.

1720
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:03,470
Like it's like,
oh,

1721
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:04,130
people

1722
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:05,510
believe a lot of things.
You know.

1723
01:26:05,511 --> 01:26:07,760
My mom was the one who told me that
trump was gonna win

1724
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:11,180
because she,
for her business,

1725
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:13,700
we live in squirrel hill.
My family,

1726
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:15,500
we went,
I was bar mitzvahed in the synagogue.

1727
01:26:15,501 --> 01:26:19,010
That was shot up,
so that's where we live in squirrel hill

1728
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,890
and the jewish neighborhood,
but my mom for her work has to drive

1729
01:26:21,891 --> 01:26:26,891
like two or three hours out of the city
and during the campaign she would see

1730
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:28,940
every.
Everyone I knew thought hillary was

1731
01:26:28,941 --> 01:26:29,960
gonna win,
including me,

1732
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:32,750
and she called me and said,
barry,

1733
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:34,900
you would not believe like the homemade
signs,

1734
01:26:34,901 --> 01:26:36,550
like they're giant homemade signs on
this,

1735
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,370
on the side of people's houses and barns
that are enormous.

1736
01:26:40,371 --> 01:26:44,240
That took them many hours to make.
There's a passion for him that I don't

1737
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:48,440
think people are fully appreciating.
Like I didn't see that everyone I knew

1738
01:26:48,441 --> 01:26:49,670
was voting for hillary clinton.

1739
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:50,583
Right.

1740
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:53,431
I don't know,
like,

1741
01:26:53,431 --> 01:26:54,890
I don't know what it's like for you out
here

1742
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,550
is the same.
It's.

1743
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:58,470
I mean it's incredible.
Not,

1744
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:02,430
not only is it incredibly left leaning,
but is also the entertainment aspect of

1745
01:27:02,431 --> 01:27:07,230
it where people have to signal the fact
that they're left so they'd go out of

1746
01:27:07,231 --> 01:27:12,060
their way to project this image of being
progressive on top of being progressive.

1747
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:14,220
It's,
it's almost critical to your job.

1748
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,330
You know,
you have to.

1749
01:27:15,331 --> 01:27:18,240
you have to show everybody you can out
progressive with the people

1750
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,970
in secret.
did they tell you what they really think

1751
01:27:20,971 --> 01:27:22,320
because you're like a safe person?

1752
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:24,380
No,
no,

1753
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:27,560
no.
Not those people to people that are

1754
01:27:27,561 --> 01:27:28,394
like,
man,

1755
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:31,220
I don't like her,
but he's such a piece of shit I'm going

1756
01:27:31,221 --> 01:27:32,060
to vote for.
Anyway.

1757
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:37,070
That was more common.
The thing was we like socially.

1758
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:42,190
People appreciate the democrats and the
left because they feel like socially in

1759
01:27:42,441 --> 01:27:44,030
terms of like,
here's a perfect example.

1760
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:46,520
When barack obama was the president and
you know,

1761
01:27:46,521 --> 01:27:51,521
people can criticize his policies and
the whistle blower or the fact that he

1762
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,760
cracked down on whistle blowers and the
fact that there was more innocent killed

1763
01:27:55,761 --> 01:27:57,830
by drone strikes and they have all that
stuff is.

1764
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,170
There's certainly some.
No one's pr.

1765
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,360
It's an impossible job.
No one's perfect as a president,

1766
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,810
but what he did do was he represented,
first of all,

1767
01:28:05,811 --> 01:28:10,010
he represented the fact that a minority
or an african american who was born from

1768
01:28:10,011 --> 01:28:15,011
a single mother can somehow or another
rise to be the president of the United

1769
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:20,330
States and be incredibly well spoken and
measured and calm and just seems to know

1770
01:28:20,331 --> 01:28:24,440
how to carry himself and makes us feel
like someone better than us is in a

1771
01:28:24,441 --> 01:28:28,700
position of power and it also,
I feel like there was a lot of racism

1772
01:28:28,701 --> 01:28:33,320
from what from a horrible white people
that looked at him in a terrible way and

1773
01:28:33,321 --> 01:28:35,690
saw this black person trying to destroy
America,

1774
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:38,950
but way more people that aren't racist
go,

1775
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:39,843
huh?

1776
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:42,260
Look at that.
You can't have an african american

1777
01:28:42,261 --> 01:28:44,600
president look at this like we're
getting better.

1778
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:48,110
Like that's how I felt.
I felt like we're getting better.

1779
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:50,810
Like culturally the way,
the way we communicate,

1780
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:55,220
we don't have that right now and we
didn't have that with her.

1781
01:28:55,750 --> 01:29:00,020
What she didn't,
what she represented was the same old

1782
01:29:00,021 --> 01:29:01,980
thing.
The thing that's been fucking

1783
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,940
you and the reason why your family lost
the farm and the reason why in this

1784
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:09,120
donald trump's going to come in here and
he's going to clean up the swamp,

1785
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:13,290
and when he came out with that drain the
swamp and lock her up,

1786
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:18,270
build that wall,
he boiled it down so that the people

1787
01:29:18,271 --> 01:29:22,920
that don't have the time or the
inclination to really deep dive into

1788
01:29:22,921 --> 01:29:27,060
their own personal biases to their own
objective reasoning and find out what is

1789
01:29:27,061 --> 01:29:28,200
it?
Why do I think the way?

1790
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:30,330
I think the people that don't have that
thought,

1791
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:32,940
all that build,
that wall shit was perfect.

1792
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,510
Line it up and that's most folks.
Most folks don't have the time.

1793
01:29:36,511 --> 01:29:38,310
Most folks Work all day.
They're tired.

1794
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,170
They have a family.
they probably have a hobby.

1795
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:43,650
they don't have the fucking time.
You are a person who thinks for living,

1796
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,210
you think and write for a living.

1797
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:47,610
You're constantly involved.
Well,

1798
01:29:47,611 --> 01:29:50,430
one thing I'm seeing when I asked you
about the people,

1799
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:52,650
people telling you their secret thought
crimes,

1800
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:58,000
I am noticing and in a weird way this
gives me kind of a hope.

1801
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:03,600
There is a big gap between people's
public personas of the politics that

1802
01:30:03,601 --> 01:30:08,340
they preach and then what they really
think and what they'll say around the

1803
01:30:08,341 --> 01:30:11,760
kitchen table and a lot of them are
experiencing what I call,

1804
01:30:11,761 --> 01:30:16,761
what I think about is like second woke,
like they're seeing the poverty or the

1805
01:30:17,521 --> 01:30:20,760
flaws in the wilk worldview and that
there are holes with it,

1806
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:23,970
but they're kind of too scared to say
that out loud because they know it'll be

1807
01:30:23,971 --> 01:30:27,360
a loss of friends and social capital and
everything else.

1808
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:29,580
But I,
those people talk to me a lot.

1809
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:33,570
Those people send me emails a lot and
oftentimes there are people with

1810
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:39,080
platforms who don't want to lose their
audience and I find that somewhat

1811
01:30:39,391 --> 01:30:40,224
hopeful.

1812
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:43,830
I find it somewhat hopeful too,
but I also got to nut nut up.

1813
01:30:43,890 --> 01:30:45,720
Yes,
like come out,

1814
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:50,510
come on rogan.
I figured I'd say something like that

1815
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:51,840
met up.
It's a good way,

1816
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:55,140
but you're right that the thought
process behind nutting up is exactly

1817
01:30:55,141 --> 01:30:57,330
what they need to do.
Like what's more people did it.

1818
01:30:57,331 --> 01:30:58,680
I think you'd realize like,
wow,

1819
01:30:58,681 --> 01:31:00,510
we're kind of surrounded.
It's almost like,

1820
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:03,103
well,
okay.

1821
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:06,990
What I think about like I am never the
smartest person in any room.

1822
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:08,910
I'm not brilliant.
I promise you,

1823
01:31:08,911 --> 01:31:10,230
you're probably smarter than us in this
room.

1824
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:13,050
Know.
I don't know if jamie had to top trust

1825
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:16,290
me what makes me.
The only reason I'm sitting here is that

1826
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:20,670
I have like slightly more courage than
most people and that I'm willing to say

1827
01:31:20,671 --> 01:31:25,671
what I think to hell with pissing some
people off or losing some friends that

1828
01:31:27,151 --> 01:31:28,380
weren't really my friends.

1829
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,050
Most people aren't willing to do that
actually.

1830
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:33,620
Well,
what I like about your writing in a.

1831
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:38,370
What I like about talking to you today
is that you represent reason and well

1832
01:31:38,371 --> 01:31:42,240
thought out opinions and those two
things are very rare.

1833
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:47,040
Well thought out.
Opinions are way more rare in my

1834
01:31:47,041 --> 01:31:49,680
opinion,
than what you usually get,

1835
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:53,280
which you usually get is a
conglomeration of opinions that seemed

1836
01:31:53,281 --> 01:31:57,420
to make sense per peripherally or
casually.

1837
01:31:57,421 --> 01:32:00,210
They have a veneer of logic to them and
you're like,

1838
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:03,250
I'll go with that because I don't have
the time because most people don't have

1839
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:04,120
the time.
Well,

1840
01:32:04,121 --> 01:32:06,310
going back to Israel,
I know we're probably.

1841
01:32:06,311 --> 01:32:08,860
Are we wrapping up?
Going back to Israel for one second.

1842
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:11,020
It's become like a pillar,
right?

1843
01:32:11,021 --> 01:32:12,070
It's like,
okay,

1844
01:32:12,071 --> 01:32:14,740
if you're on the left,
I believe in

1845
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:19,180
criminal justice reform,
like any number of things.

1846
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:19,901
Oh,
and by the way,

1847
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:20,590
Israel is bad.

1848
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:23,740
Like it became one of those things that
most people don't really think about.

1849
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:27,010
Right.
And like I think it's really important

1850
01:32:27,011 --> 01:32:30,490
to think about things issue by issue and
not just be like,

1851
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,800
yep,
signing up for this whole slew of

1852
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:37,060
policies and views on things when
actually some of those things don't go

1853
01:32:37,061 --> 01:32:38,000
together at all.
Well,

1854
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:41,500
one thing than the woke left,
you're not allowed to do is criticize

1855
01:32:41,501 --> 01:32:46,000
the more repressive aspects of islam.
You're not allowed to.

1856
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:49,180
You don't do it.
If you bring up anything becomes

1857
01:32:49,181 --> 01:32:52,960
islamophobic in even if it's homophobic
thought,

1858
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:58,490
if the ideas are homophobic or if women
have to wear restrictive clothing,

1859
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:03,100
all any,
any of the things that are incredibly

1860
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:07,030
commonplace,
you are not allowed to criticize those

1861
01:33:07,031 --> 01:33:09,400
because those fall into a protected
category.

1862
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:14,670
I remember when I first ran into this in
college when we were talking,

1863
01:33:15,191 --> 01:33:18,220
I was in a conversation with other
feminists and I definitely consider

1864
01:33:18,221 --> 01:33:22,330
myself a feminist about female genital
mutilation and I encountered for the

1865
01:33:22,331 --> 01:33:24,700
first time a species that I've come to
know well,

1866
01:33:24,701 --> 01:33:27,190
which is feminist,
who sorta defend female genital

1867
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:30,130
mutilation on the grounds of cultural
relativism.

1868
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:35,280
Who are we to judge?
And I remember just like I did not get

1869
01:33:35,561 --> 01:33:37,370
over the shock of that.
you shouldn't.

1870
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:41,020
That is fucking terrifying.
I mean,

1871
01:33:41,021 --> 01:33:41,741
that is.
Look,

1872
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:46,720
I'm an outspoken,
rabid critic of circumcision.

1873
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:49,120
I think it's disgusting.
I think it's ridiculous.

1874
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:51,640
It doesn't make any sense,
but at least your dick still works.

1875
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:57,820
The idea that someone tried to equate
circumcision and female genital

1876
01:33:57,821 --> 01:34:00,340
mutilation,
a person on the left did when I talked

1877
01:34:00,341 --> 01:34:03,400
about it recently,
some fucking asshole online.

1878
01:34:03,401 --> 01:34:06,250
I don't remember who it was,
but I didn't even.

1879
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,380
I didn't even exchange.
I just,

1880
01:34:08,381 --> 01:34:10,720
I just,
I read it and I went there.

1881
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:13,000
Their vagina doesn't work the same way
anymore.

1882
01:34:13,001 --> 01:34:15,460
Do you understand that you can't have an
orgasm anymore.

1883
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:17,740
You're cutting off a woman's cliteracy
too.

1884
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:22,600
Not because of cleanliness or any
fucking weird logic that they're using

1885
01:34:22,601 --> 01:34:26,590
today to try to justify circumcision.
Way worse,

1886
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,020
you're.
You're doing it to try to eliminate

1887
01:34:29,021 --> 01:34:30,490
pleasure because you don't want the
woman to leave.

1888
01:34:30,491 --> 01:34:34,270
It'S the same reason why you want to
cover up with some crazy,

1889
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:36,000
but why barb?
But

1890
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:39,790
the leaders of the women's march talk
about say,

1891
01:34:39,791 --> 01:34:41,320
I don't know,
honor killings,

1892
01:34:41,530 --> 01:34:46,390
female genital mutilation,
forced marriage for,

1893
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:48,250
for,
for girls,

1894
01:34:48,251 --> 01:34:49,360
children,
children.

1895
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:52,750
Instead they're talking about bds in
Israel.

1896
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:56,740
I don't get it.
I'd love to ask someone about that also.

1897
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,000
Have you been to Israel?
No,

1898
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,370
I have not.
I want to take you say yes.

1899
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:04,160
I would go.
I would go.

1900
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:05,570
I would go.
I would certainly go.

1901
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,090
I've got to bring already though.
He'll translate.

1902
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:11,180
Is that the guy?
He's a good friend.

1903
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:14,210
Um,
and he loves to travel too,

1904
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:16,070
so he'd be down in heartbeat.
Um,

1905
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:16,933
what was I gonna say?
Oh,

1906
01:35:17,690 --> 01:35:20,240
why?
Why is it that,

1907
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:23,990
do you think that here's,
here's a better way for them.

1908
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:27,240
Do you think there's too many things to
pay attention to?

1909
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:33,200
Not just worldwide,
but even in terms of like left versus

1910
01:35:33,201 --> 01:35:34,480
right in,
in,

1911
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:38,390
in these positions,
like I often talk to people about gun

1912
01:35:38,391 --> 01:35:43,370
control and um,
and when people find out that I own guns

1913
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:48,080
and the,
that I'm not entirely in favor of second

1914
01:35:48,081 --> 01:35:52,310
amendment being repealed.
One thing that drives me crazy is they

1915
01:35:52,311 --> 01:35:54,350
want to always bring up school
shootings,

1916
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:56,540
mass shootings,
all these different things which I agree

1917
01:35:56,541 --> 01:36:01,541
are horrific,
terrible occurrence in our culture and

1918
01:36:01,551 --> 01:36:04,160
is happening in this insanely frequent
way.

1919
01:36:04,490 --> 01:36:07,940
And it doesn't make sense,
but people don't want to talk about is

1920
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:09,920
that almost all those people are on
psych medication.

1921
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:14,360
Almost all of them right now,
correlation does not equal causation.

1922
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:18,440
Them being on the psych medicine might
be the same reason why they're shooting

1923
01:36:18,441 --> 01:36:19,850
up schools in the first place.
They're,

1924
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:23,900
they're incredibly mentally unwell and
legally buy a gun.

1925
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:25,220
It's insane.
It's insane.

1926
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:27,210
That's great.
Yeah.

1927
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,370
One hundred percent.
Not only do I think that you should then

1928
01:36:31,371 --> 01:36:32,990
here's the question,
who are,

1929
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:37,640
who is the person to decide,
and this is the what the nra would say,

1930
01:36:37,770 --> 01:36:40,040
and this is what a pro second amendment
people would say.

1931
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:44,000
Who are you to decide whether or not
someone is healthy enough or well enough

1932
01:36:44,001 --> 01:36:48,620
to own a gun and does a person who is on
antidepressants or person who has

1933
01:36:48,621 --> 01:36:51,860
psychological problems not have the
ability to defend themselves if they

1934
01:36:51,861 --> 01:36:54,470
have never exhibited violence,
so here's the problem.

1935
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:57,470
A lot of these mother fuckers,
they don't exhibit violence until they

1936
01:36:57,471 --> 01:37:00,560
break until they pop and then they'd go
shoot up a school.

1937
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:04,100
Sometimes there's threats like adam
lanza or a couple other ones were the

1938
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:07,640
fbi comes and visits them and they
talked to them or the guy in Colorado

1939
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:10,070
where they knew he was like hanging on
by a string,

1940
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:15,020
but
he was on that gap,

1941
01:37:15,021 --> 01:37:17,640
which I think is like a far writer.
It's definitely used by the fire,

1942
01:37:17,641 --> 01:37:19,240
right?
It's used by the far right.

1943
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:22,190
The problem is when you have no
restriction whatsoever and you have

1944
01:37:22,191 --> 01:37:23,840
restriction and all these other ones,
right?

1945
01:37:23,841 --> 01:37:26,990
If you say something antisemitic or
racist on twitter,

1946
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:28,970
they will ban you.
If you do it on facebook,

1947
01:37:28,971 --> 01:37:32,330
they'll ban you and gab is committed 100
percent of free speech.

1948
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:35,900
I've.
I've read things the owners of gab have

1949
01:37:35,901 --> 01:37:40,901
said about this and that they're.
They're very steadfast in their support

1950
01:37:41,031 --> 01:37:45,980
for freedom of speech because they think
what I said earlier that the best way to

1951
01:37:45,981 --> 01:37:50,690
ensure that good ideas get through is to
not suppress bad ideas,

1952
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:55,070
but to combat them with better ideas.
I was going to say is that the guy who

1953
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:56,040
shot up

1954
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:00,700
the synagogue in pittsburgh was saying
the most horrific things about the cake

1955
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,270
infestation in your country

1956
01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:05,100
on gab and that's.
That's where the question is,

1957
01:38:05,101 --> 01:38:08,550
well,
should someone like roku pull Alex

1958
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:09,930
Jones?
Should they take off?

1959
01:38:10,270 --> 01:38:15,270
I think that this is a real question
like as someone who's to myself on the

1960
01:38:15,281 --> 01:38:17,650
free making the free speech argument a
lot,

1961
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:20,680
I think it's something that we really,
really have to grapple with.

1962
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:23,620
IT really.
It's almost like we're dealing with

1963
01:38:23,621 --> 01:38:26,320
crude tools,
like we're trying to perform surgery

1964
01:38:26,321 --> 01:38:31,321
with hatchets oh fuck man,
how do you get to those people and have

1965
01:38:32,021 --> 01:38:34,330
that discussion with all those people,
but this is.

1966
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:38,140
I mean in terms of there being too much
to talk about and cover,

1967
01:38:38,470 --> 01:38:41,800
that's where I do think that things like
the New York times can make a real

1968
01:38:41,801 --> 01:38:46,801
contribution because we like there are
adults in the room deciding what the

1969
01:38:48,761 --> 01:38:52,570
important news is that you should pay
attention to in theory at least.

1970
01:38:52,630 --> 01:38:53,180
Well,
no,

1971
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:55,170
I,
I wholeheartedly agree.

1972
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:58,300
You know,
you're going to learn about the genocide

1973
01:38:58,301 --> 01:39:01,450
of the week muslims in the New York to
and like if you really read the New York

1974
01:39:01,451 --> 01:39:04,030
times every day,
you're going to know a lot about the

1975
01:39:04,031 --> 01:39:07,060
world and you're going to understand
that the government shut down is a

1976
01:39:07,061 --> 01:39:10,000
bigger deal than what happened on the
steps of the lincoln memorial.

1977
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:14,440
If you're just trolling through twitter,
which is how like every person I know,

1978
01:39:14,441 --> 01:39:17,530
or twitter or snapchat or whatever,
like my youngest sister,

1979
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:20,830
how she gets her news,
you're not going to necessarily know

1980
01:39:20,831 --> 01:39:25,110
that.
That's a real problem is I don't know

1981
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:29,350
how to solve it other than tell people
to subscribe to newspapers,

1982
01:39:29,351 --> 01:39:32,620
which still have some standards and
which still when they make a mistake,

1983
01:39:32,650 --> 01:39:33,820
correct.
The mistake.

1984
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,440
How many of those are left?
There's a few.

1985
01:39:36,690 --> 01:39:39,090
Yeah,
I work at one of them.

1986
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:40,550
One of them.
You definitely do.

1987
01:39:40,610 --> 01:39:41,610
I mean,
look,

1988
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:44,510
I.
I said something to someone from the New

1989
01:39:44,510 --> 01:39:48,680
York times online after a,
an article that they wrote about a

1990
01:39:48,681 --> 01:39:51,290
fight.
There was a boxing match economy.

1991
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:53,000
Mcgregor and floyd mayweather were
congress.

1992
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:55,050
It was a great fight.
Floyd made with school them,

1993
01:39:55,750 --> 01:40:00,750
but at the end it said that conor
mcgregor's face was swollen and bleeding

1994
01:40:01,190 --> 01:40:04,700
and he was knocked through the ropes and
I said,

1995
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:07,100
you can't say that because everybody saw
the fight.

1996
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:12,200
That didn't happen in this crazy time
where everybody is crying out for fake

1997
01:40:12,201 --> 01:40:15,650
news.
You can't say his face was covered in

1998
01:40:15,651 --> 01:40:18,740
blood when there was no blood.
You can't say that like don't do.

1999
01:40:18,741 --> 01:40:20,930
That was corrected.
It was corrected.

2000
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:23,490
Which is so rare,
but it's actually not.

2001
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:24,840
We correct things.
Yes,

2002
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:26,060
all the time.
Right,

2003
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:27,950
but how do you stop it from happening in
the first place?

2004
01:40:27,951 --> 01:40:29,680
How do you stop that one?
Well,

2005
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:31,970
no,
the first one is really high blood.

2006
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:33,410
No,
no blood when it doesn't exist.

2007
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:35,540
I'm sorry,
what I'm saying it's really hard.

2008
01:40:35,541 --> 01:40:38,990
What I mean is journalists just
shouldn't make mistakes like that,

2009
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:43,430
but we do the difference with the New
York times and any number of these other

2010
01:40:43,431 --> 01:40:46,850
places is that we say we made a mistake
and we correct.

2011
01:40:47,150 --> 01:40:49,980
Well,
it's high part matters pros.

2012
01:40:50,090 --> 01:40:52,820
It's like someone having getting ahead
of themselves having a little too much

2013
01:40:52,821 --> 01:40:54,100
fun.
Don't remember that article.

2014
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:56,410
Well,
it wasn't necessarily think it's getting

2015
01:40:56,411 --> 01:41:00,340
ahead and read some fiction.
They applied fiction to an actual sport

2016
01:41:00,341 --> 01:41:01,870
event,
which I thought was bizarre,

2017
01:41:01,871 --> 01:41:03,610
but.
But they correct.

2018
01:41:03,710 --> 01:41:04,640
They did correct it.
Well,

2019
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:08,320
here's what's important.
What's important is you can at least get

2020
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:11,560
a better version of the facts there than
you can anywhere else.

2021
01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:12,410
Yes,
and I,

2022
01:41:12,410 --> 01:41:17,410
I guess there's some people in the new
media landscape that I see and I don't

2023
01:41:17,411 --> 01:41:20,350
know if it's because they want to sort
of join up their own audiences are what

2024
01:41:21,310 --> 01:41:26,310
like nihilistic getting like using
trumpist language to describe the press.

2025
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:31,160
Would they don't see?
Would they don't know?

2026
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:36,240
I think what they don't understand is
that the loss of trust in the press is a

2027
01:41:37,391 --> 01:41:41,440
symptom of the loss of trust in lots of
public institutions.

2028
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:44,380
The who,
the world health organization just came

2029
01:41:44,381 --> 01:41:48,490
out with this terrifying report.
We're like one of the top 10 threats to

2030
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:51,180
health in.
I think the country you should,

2031
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:54,730
we should look this up,
is people who aren't getting vaccines.

2032
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:57,910
People who think vaccines cause autism
and are not getting vaccines.

2033
01:41:58,330 --> 01:42:03,330
The stakes of like loss of trust in
public institutions doesn't just mean

2034
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:06,010
like you're gonna like hurt the New York
times,

2035
01:42:06,011 --> 01:42:08,500
bottom line.
It's like a threat to all of our health.

2036
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:10,840
Like quite literally,
you know,

2037
01:42:10,841 --> 01:42:13,780
I see these things as being very,
very connected.

2038
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:18,250
So when I see people gleefully
celebrating like the fake news of the

2039
01:42:18,251 --> 01:42:21,190
New York times,
I'm like juva better alternative right

2040
01:42:21,191 --> 01:42:23,520
now,
you know?

2041
01:42:23,610 --> 01:42:24,720
Right.
That's what I'm thinking.

2042
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:25,860
Not you,
but no.

2043
01:42:25,861 --> 01:42:26,430
Yeah,
no,

2044
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:28,980
I agree.
I don't understand why anyone would

2045
01:42:28,981 --> 01:42:30,840
celebrate that.
Think it falls into what we were talking

2046
01:42:30,841 --> 01:42:34,280
about before that it's an easily
digestible ideology that you can just

2047
01:42:34,281 --> 01:42:37,010
subscribe to.
It's a conglomeration of preformed

2048
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:39,720
opinions and you lock in.
You start saying fake news,

2049
01:42:39,930 --> 01:42:41,970
and this is.
It's also,

2050
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:46,200
it's exacerbated by this situation that
we find ourselves in where people aren't

2051
01:42:46,201 --> 01:42:49,680
really buying newspapers anymore.
You have to get people to subscribe.

2052
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:55,370
I subscribe to several on my phone and
on my computer and that's how I digest

2053
01:42:55,621 --> 01:42:58,530
things now or an ipad.
When you,

2054
01:42:58,890 --> 01:43:03,890
you think about what they have to do to
get those clicks and you see these weird

2055
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:08,130
look,
it is not a knock on forbes.

2056
01:43:08,131 --> 01:43:10,440
I think forbes is an excellent
periodical.

2057
01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:11,510
They're great.
They,

2058
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:13,830
they,
they write some really important stuff,

2059
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:19,250
but almost every month they will write
this super click baity thing about cell

2060
01:43:20,691 --> 01:43:21,524
phones.

2061
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:26,890
Like it comes with a nasty surprise.
The new galaxy s 10 has a nasty surprise

2062
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:30,380
and it's so unimaginative.
Yes.

2063
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:31,450
Yes.
Look,

2064
01:43:31,450 --> 01:43:36,450
see if you can find how many nasty
surprise articles about iphones and I've

2065
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:40,830
about video games and stuff a lot too.
Did they have like a contributor network

2066
01:43:40,831 --> 01:43:42,570
that people are just allowed to write
articles on?

2067
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:46,500
Ah,
they allow post used to have that too.

2068
01:43:46,890 --> 01:43:49,350
Yeah.
That fucking stuff is so dangerous

2069
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:54,500
because as soon as people lose trust
that you are unbiased and you're giving

2070
01:43:55,401 --> 01:43:58,550
them an objective perspective on exactly
what's going on,

2071
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:01,010
as soon as that mean,
it might be nothing when it comes to

2072
01:44:01,011 --> 01:44:03,890
galaxy s tens or whatever the fuck
they're talking about.

2073
01:44:03,891 --> 01:44:06,010
This has a nasty surprise,
but.

2074
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:09,910
But it,
it flavors your perspective on news of

2075
01:44:09,911 --> 01:44:12,110
course.
And these people are fighting for their

2076
01:44:12,111 --> 01:44:14,840
life.
Journalists and people in contributors

2077
01:44:14,841 --> 01:44:17,780
to these websites and news and
newspapers are fighting for their life

2078
01:44:17,810 --> 01:44:19,700
because everything is dropping off.

2079
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:21,760
The revenues are down,
the revenues are.

2080
01:44:21,890 --> 01:44:23,900
And then like what's what takes their
place?

2081
01:44:23,930 --> 01:44:25,310
What took place?
Bloggers,

2082
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,110
who's,
who's looking at them?

2083
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:32,310
Are you sure that they have journalistic
ethics and standards that are like what

2084
01:44:32,631 --> 01:44:34,460
we would expect from?
They don't.

2085
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:35,400
They know,
right?

2086
01:44:36,230 --> 01:44:38,320
They don't have to.
And this brings you to the end from ars

2087
01:44:38,450 --> 01:44:39,620
info wars thing,
right?

2088
01:44:41,450 --> 01:44:42,740
He,
if he's a journalist,

2089
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:45,830
he's definitely not a journalist,
but this is,

2090
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:48,440
but this is what people are fighting
about.

2091
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:51,540
This is.
This is the whole shebang.

2092
01:44:51,550 --> 01:44:54,350
Like if,
if some of that news that you're getting

2093
01:44:54,351 --> 01:44:59,000
in these traditional venues is fake,
it is dangerous.

2094
01:44:59,150 --> 01:45:02,660
If any of it is click baity.
If any of it is deceptive and agree with

2095
01:45:02,661 --> 01:45:04,310
you more,
it's fucking dangerous.

2096
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:06,910
Especially because we have a president
who attacks the presses,

2097
01:45:06,930 --> 01:45:09,500
the member like clinton.
I forget the context we're operating.

2098
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:10,520
Yes.
You know,

2099
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:13,670
we have trump calling us the enemy of
the people so crazy.

2100
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:18,210
The lack of understanding of views it
insane.

2101
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:19,700
Yeah,
for sure.

2102
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,220
There were easy to drive insane though.
let's be honest.

2103
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:24,710
There's a lot of dummies out there
that's part of the problem.

2104
01:45:24,711 --> 01:45:27,950
It's just,
it's so easy to prod a certain group and

2105
01:45:27,951 --> 01:45:28,820
they're like,
I'm done.

2106
01:45:28,821 --> 01:45:30,670
I'm going to do something about this.
This is,

2107
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:33,440
this is the danger,
this is what you have to worry about.

2108
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:35,240
The people that they,
and again,

2109
01:45:35,241 --> 01:45:37,910
they're signaling to their signaling to
the far right,

2110
01:45:37,911 --> 01:45:41,090
they're signaling to those people.
I know a lot of people like that.

2111
01:45:41,091 --> 01:45:43,790
Not that would shoot people,
but I know a lot of people that are

2112
01:45:43,791 --> 01:45:47,570
signalers that like far right signaler,
so like they'll see things and I've.

2113
01:45:47,571 --> 01:45:51,010
I've talked to people that I hope trump
wins because we've got to put a stop to

2114
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:53,180
all this nonsense with the nonsense.

2115
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:56,810
It's progressive nonsense.
The idea socialist like bernie sanders

2116
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:58,550
going to come along and take all your
money.

2117
01:45:58,551 --> 01:46:01,940
We're struggling hard working americans.
We've got to put America first.

2118
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:06,860
Put America first.
It's just lack of understanding about

2119
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:11,300
the complexity of the entire landscape,
the entire landscape in terms of

2120
01:46:11,301 --> 01:46:13,490
economics,
entire landscape in terms of

2121
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,710
international politics,
all of it.

2122
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:18,290
All the above the war machine into the,
the,

2123
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:21,530
the lack of understanding about the
military industrial complex and the

2124
01:46:21,531 --> 01:46:24,140
influence that it has.
The lack of understanding about the

2125
01:46:24,141 --> 01:46:27,560
bankers,
about how few people went to jail after

2126
01:46:27,561 --> 01:46:30,830
the fucking crazy economic collapse that
we just recovered.

2127
01:46:30,831 --> 01:46:33,840
From what I mean,
if you view,

2128
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:36,320
you've seen inside job,
you seen that documentary.

2129
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:39,920
It's an amazing documentary,
but it's all about the financial

2130
01:46:39,921 --> 01:46:41,360
collapse.
Pulled that up,

2131
01:46:41,361 --> 01:46:42,650
find out,
uh,

2132
01:46:42,910 --> 01:46:45,110
I watched it.
It's from 2000,

2133
01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:49,740
I want to say 10:11.
But it's so sobering

2134
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,010
when you have this guy who's an
economics of real,

2135
01:46:53,011 --> 01:46:58,011
true economics expert questioning these
people who in many cases they're a

2136
01:46:58,530 --> 01:47:03,530
economics professors at major
universities who give advice.

2137
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:04,890
Okay.
Two thousand 10.

2138
01:47:04,891 --> 01:47:06,510
I was right.
Charles ferguson.

2139
01:47:06,570 --> 01:47:08,790
That was a gentleman.
He did a good job.

2140
01:47:08,970 --> 01:47:09,810
I know.
It's so sad.

2141
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,490
He's a good guy.
I met him,

2142
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:15,540
but he's forever.
Team America is one of the greatest

2143
01:47:15,541 --> 01:47:18,740
movies of all time.
That ideology should roll.

2144
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:19,603
Yes.
Yeah.

2145
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:21,900
And you know what I love about it more
than anything,

2146
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:24,330
the whole idea that actors have to save
the world

2147
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:30,880
because I just think is so brilliant
that I inadvertently saw that movie with

2148
01:47:32,641 --> 01:47:36,120
my dad and my grandfather and I will
never forget the puppet sex scene

2149
01:47:36,121 --> 01:47:40,270
watching that
today.

2150
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:43,530
That oh,
rIght next to your desk and you know you

2151
01:47:43,531 --> 01:47:46,650
should they ever make that movie.
Do you know what I made a mistake of

2152
01:47:46,651 --> 01:47:47,484
doing yesterday?

2153
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:51,000
I watch ace ventura pet detective with
my eight year old and my 10 year old

2154
01:47:51,580 --> 01:47:56,580
since they came out with a good still.
I didn't realize how transphobic that

2155
01:47:56,671 --> 01:47:59,790
fucking movie is
alert.

2156
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:04,940
The whole premise is that there was an
ace ventura pet detective.

2157
01:48:05,190 --> 01:48:09,640
I got a spoiler it myself because I
forgot the Whole premise was wet.

2158
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:13,500
This guy steals a dolphin and when he
steals a dolphin,

2159
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:16,500
ace ventura fines because he's a pet
detective,

2160
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:21,710
finds a tiny ruby that's at the bottom
of this dolphin tank that is missing

2161
01:48:22,861 --> 01:48:27,861
from a miami dolphins ring.
And he finds out through this exhaustive

2162
01:48:28,230 --> 01:48:33,230
search that the one guy who he couldn't
account for his ring was a kicker who

2163
01:48:34,261 --> 01:48:36,840
fucked up the world series or the
superbowl rather.

2164
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:40,920
So this suit,
this guy,

2165
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:46,190
this guy that they found out is Sean
Young in the movie who's gorgeous.

2166
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:49,650
And then in the movie can take that down
please.

2167
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:54,720
So in the movie at the end of it,
the reveal is that Sean Young is really

2168
01:48:54,721 --> 01:48:59,721
this football player who wants to get
back at dan marino because dan murray,

2169
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:03,360
he's Go psycho because the world hates
him because he blew the kick.

2170
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:08,100
So he's a guy pretending to be a woman
and ace ventura made out with them.

2171
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:11,130
And just like everyone saw the cops are
throwing up.

2172
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:14,730
Everyone's throwing up on or off.
it's off the charts.

2173
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:18,330
At the end he pulls her top off and
shows and she has breasts.

2174
01:49:18,331 --> 01:49:20,790
He was like trying to show that she
didn't really abreast and she did.

2175
01:49:20,970 --> 01:49:21,391
and he's like,
well,

2176
01:49:21,391 --> 01:49:24,300
anybody can get those and an afternoon,
but what about this?

2177
01:49:24,301 --> 01:49:29,130
And he pulls her pants down and then he
goes by and then everybody sees her and

2178
01:49:29,131 --> 01:49:31,530
she's got her legs together so you can't
see your penis.

2179
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:36,480
And then from behind you see her junk is
pressed up against her butt cheeks

2180
01:49:36,481 --> 01:49:38,310
because she's tucked her penis and her
vagina.

2181
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:42,750
So the cops all start throwing up.
And then cops started cleaning cops that

2182
01:49:42,751 --> 01:49:44,910
made out with her and start cleaning
their mouth off.

2183
01:49:44,970 --> 01:49:48,180
They start chewing giant wad there.
That's her scene.

2184
01:49:48,330 --> 01:49:52,600
So watch all the cops see that.
And he points to the fact that sean,

2185
01:49:52,601 --> 01:49:53,890
you look,
they all start throwing up.

2186
01:49:53,891 --> 01:49:55,060
Look,
everyone's throwing up.

2187
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:59,470
This is dan marino's throwing up.
See how he's cleaning his mouth because

2188
01:49:59,471 --> 01:50:01,690
he,
he made out with her tone loke the

2189
01:50:01,691 --> 01:50:04,090
dolphins freaking out.
Everyone's freaking out.

2190
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:09,080
It is so insanely transformed.
So what the left would say is the reason

2191
01:50:09,081 --> 01:50:11,980
that they're right is that a movie like
this won't get made anymore.

2192
01:50:11,981 --> 01:50:15,580
And isn't that a good thing?
Maybe should they pull it?

2193
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:18,340
Shouldn't.
Should it be illegal to have that on

2194
01:50:18,341 --> 01:50:21,100
itunes?
Of course not.

2195
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,530
Oh,
maybe someone on the left might disagree

2196
01:50:23,531 --> 01:50:24,364
with you right now.

2197
01:50:24,810 --> 01:50:29,530
You transphobic for defending this
horrible cisgendered heteronormative

2198
01:50:30,230 --> 01:50:33,760
shit movie that's horrible.
And what's crazy,

2199
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:38,500
and I guess this is a great thing.
I mean the remodelization project is

2200
01:50:38,501 --> 01:50:41,320
working because when I saw that,
I'm sure is.

2201
01:50:41,321 --> 01:50:42,640
I don't know.
What year did that come out?

2202
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:45,390
90 five for.
Okay.

2203
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:48,190
So when I saw that as a,
I don't know,

2204
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:49,570
I was born in 84.
I can't do math.

2205
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:52,690
I want to say [inaudible] 93.
I want to say it was before I came to

2206
01:50:52,691 --> 01:50:55,450
hollywood.
When I saw that movie I was 10.

2207
01:50:55,790 --> 01:50:58,080
Transphobia was not a thing.
No,

2208
01:50:58,160 --> 01:50:59,020
no,
it is the thing.

2209
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:02,950
That's good.
Well that's good about when things are

2210
01:51:02,951 --> 01:51:05,920
changing so rapidly,
but the question is where are the lines

2211
01:51:05,921 --> 01:51:09,940
being drawn and is the overton window
being shrunk too small?

2212
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:12,970
How do you feel about them pulling the
dukes of hazzard off the air for the

2213
01:51:12,971 --> 01:51:13,804
flag?

2214
01:51:14,010 --> 01:51:15,910
I don't know about that.
You didn't know about that?

2215
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:17,580
No,
they pulled the dukes of hazard.

2216
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:19,660
You understand?
Do you understand how many of these

2217
01:51:19,661 --> 01:51:20,980
there are so many.
Yeah,

2218
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:22,000
so no,
I don't know that one.

2219
01:51:22,001 --> 01:51:23,140
What's that one?
This one.

2220
01:51:23,141 --> 01:51:26,410
They yanked the dukes of hazzard off
television forever because the

2221
01:51:26,411 --> 01:51:31,390
confederate flag was on the roof of the
generally did not follow this.

2222
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,790
Didn't know that.
You cannot watch the news a hazard

2223
01:51:33,791 --> 01:51:35,200
anymore.
You cannot watch it.

2224
01:51:35,530 --> 01:51:38,680
It's not on television anymore.
It used to be on tv land all the time.

2225
01:51:39,010 --> 01:51:41,700
Can you just get it?
Fuck no,

2226
01:51:42,130 --> 01:51:44,770
no chance.
They're not going to show that god damn

2227
01:51:44,771 --> 01:51:49,060
awful flag.
We have a poster in the bathroom over

2228
01:51:49,061 --> 01:51:54,061
there of leonard skinner from like 1970
something and they have a giant janis

2229
01:51:54,221 --> 01:51:55,570
joplin.
I thought in the bathroom.

2230
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:57,510
The other bathroom.
Who?

2231
01:51:57,530 --> 01:51:58,210
Janis joplin.

2232
01:51:58,210 --> 01:51:59,170
Oh,
That's the other bathroom.

2233
01:51:59,171 --> 01:52:00,370
Yeah,
there's different like.

2234
01:52:00,910 --> 01:52:01,541
Yeah,
that's great one.

2235
01:52:01,541 --> 01:52:02,710
That's her mug shot.
I love it.

2236
01:52:02,711 --> 01:52:03,544
Yeah,
that's right.

2237
01:52:03,690 --> 01:52:05,050
Um,
but the,

2238
01:52:05,130 --> 01:52:09,550
the leonard scared one,
they have a giant confederate flag on

2239
01:52:09,551 --> 01:52:10,540
stage.
Huge.

2240
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:15,541
Enormous in the background that was
there like southern pride,

2241
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:19,390
this idea of southern pride.
It was okay to have that flag.

2242
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:25,030
I'm basically for trying to,
when it comes to the realm of art and

2243
01:52:25,031 --> 01:52:27,250
movies and books,
leave it alone.

2244
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:29,680
Try to leave It alone as much as
possible.

2245
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:32,480
It's generally a very good strategy.
I agree.

2246
01:52:32,481 --> 01:52:35,050
I don't want to be in the book banning
movie banning tv,

2247
01:52:35,051 --> 01:52:37,790
banning business or editing.
They tried to mobile.

2248
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:39,520
They,
I think they did successfully at least

2249
01:52:39,521 --> 01:52:44,500
in some venues,
edit a tom sawyer and huck finn because

2250
01:52:44,530 --> 01:52:46,220
the n word was used prolifically,

2251
01:52:46,450 --> 01:52:49,160
you know?
I mean the guy's name was nigger jim.

2252
01:52:49,490 --> 01:52:54,490
That was the name in the book because
that's how people talk back then and I

2253
01:52:56,121 --> 01:53:01,121
think we need to keep that stuff as a
time capsule to show how racism.

2254
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:05,370
Yes,
yes.

2255
01:53:05,850 --> 01:53:09,560
It's important to show the progress like
ace ventura,

2256
01:53:09,870 --> 01:53:12,050
like,
like for trans people,

2257
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:16,500
keep him for history for trans people
and it's amazing that no one's ever

2258
01:53:16,501 --> 01:53:17,610
brought this up.
I mean,

2259
01:53:17,670 --> 01:53:22,230
I feel like this is something that's
never been discussed from you.

2260
01:53:22,231 --> 01:53:25,380
Joe rogan about the implant.
I got shit to do.

2261
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:26,273
I got,
I got jokes.

2262
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,490
Right,
but this is.

2263
01:53:28,650 --> 01:53:31,380
You got an Israel trip that I'm planning
and are,

2264
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:32,770
what are you doing to me,
mary,

2265
01:53:32,810 --> 01:53:36,570
you're not dragging.
You want to take you on an amazing trip

2266
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:39,030
and then we're going to go to the west
bank and you're gonna see all this stuff

2267
01:53:39,190 --> 01:53:43,290
and you're going to come away with
loving certain parts of it and not

2268
01:53:43,291 --> 01:53:46,050
liking certain parts of it and you're
going to realize it's a country just

2269
01:53:46,051 --> 01:53:50,550
like any other country,
but it is a democracy and it's trying to

2270
01:53:50,551 --> 01:53:53,250
do what's best in a really rough
neighborhood and we'll go like,

2271
01:53:53,251 --> 01:53:55,710
I want you to see what the occupation
looks like.

2272
01:53:55,790 --> 01:53:58,500
Like I think that's something that's
really important to see to get a full

2273
01:53:58,501 --> 01:53:59,334
picture of it.

2274
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:01,620
I think you're probably right.
I think it is an important thing for

2275
01:54:01,621 --> 01:54:02,730
people to see.
Um,

2276
01:54:02,731 --> 01:54:05,040
I think there's a lot of parts of the
world that I need to see to really get a

2277
01:54:05,041 --> 01:54:06,930
grasp.
Where do you want to go?

2278
01:54:06,931 --> 01:54:09,300
Where you going next in the world?
You travel a lot.

2279
01:54:09,330 --> 01:54:12,420
Yes.
I don't know.

2280
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:14,490
I mean,
my family and I,

2281
01:54:14,491 --> 01:54:16,800
we do a european vacation trip,
but that doesn't really count.

2282
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:18,390
We just lounge.
It's just fun.

2283
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:21,510
I went to Thailand last year.
That was fascinating.

2284
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:23,850
Cool.
Thailand was fascinating because that

2285
01:54:23,851 --> 01:54:28,590
was kind of a vacation trip too,
but that's such a uniQue culture because

2286
01:54:28,591 --> 01:54:32,070
Thailand is run by the king or even
criticize the king.

2287
01:54:32,071 --> 01:54:33,150
You're,
you're fucked.

2288
01:54:33,330 --> 01:54:36,270
Like you're in real trouble.
And his is everywhere.

2289
01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:38,460
Everywhere.
There's pictures of him in the throne

2290
01:54:38,461 --> 01:54:41,310
like wearing like super nice clothes and
look good,

2291
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:44,940
but the people are so kind.

2292
01:54:45,090 --> 01:54:48,930
they're so friendly and they're always
smiling and they have,

2293
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:50,670
you know,
there's a lot of people that you'll run

2294
01:54:50,671 --> 01:54:54,480
into that have very little yet.
They don't seem to be having a problem

2295
01:54:54,481 --> 01:54:55,710
with that.
They wear flip flops.

2296
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:58,860
You're on the highway.
There's three people on a motorcycle is

2297
01:54:58,861 --> 01:55:00,780
a baby in a basket and I'm not
bullshitting.

2298
01:55:02,550 --> 01:55:04,590
No helmet.
and then friend that just went to

2299
01:55:04,591 --> 01:55:07,710
Thailand,
but the people are so nice.

2300
01:55:07,770 --> 01:55:09,300
They're so nice.
They're so kind.

2301
01:55:09,690 --> 01:55:11,360
It's so unusual.
And you know,

2302
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:12,600
me and my famIly,
we had.

2303
01:55:12,630 --> 01:55:13,770
We always,
whenever we go somewhere,

2304
01:55:13,771 --> 01:55:18,330
we always have this real long
conversations about like what was

2305
01:55:18,331 --> 01:55:20,550
interesting about it for you?
Like what,

2306
01:55:20,551 --> 01:55:22,370
what did you think,
like your kids?

2307
01:55:22,710 --> 01:55:24,420
Eight and 10,
the young ones and I have a 22 year old

2308
01:55:24,450 --> 01:55:29,450
to all girls holla and from for girls
blue jeans,

2309
01:55:30,570 --> 01:55:32,620
but the,
the,

2310
01:55:32,700 --> 01:55:35,370
the,
what's fascinating to me about it is,

2311
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:38,730
well first of all I love exposing these
little people to different parts of the

2312
01:55:38,731 --> 01:55:41,810
world so they get to see like what this
is like,

2313
01:55:41,830 --> 01:55:43,020
you know,
like here we are,

2314
01:55:43,410 --> 01:55:44,243
show them on the map.

2315
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:46,320
This is America,
we're over here.

2316
01:55:46,450 --> 01:55:50,970
but when the fucking 15 hours to get
here a plane that goes 500 plus miles an

2317
01:55:50,971 --> 01:55:51,840
hour,
it's crazy.

2318
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:57,120
And just to realize like human beings
are the same but different.

2319
01:55:57,510 --> 01:56:00,720
We're the same everywhere,
but there's a different way.

2320
01:56:00,721 --> 01:56:04,410
We choose to interact with each other
and one of the things that happens is we

2321
01:56:04,411 --> 01:56:07,080
fall into their way.
When we go there.

2322
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:09,360
Like if we go to Italy,
we say razzi,

2323
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:12,250
I try to,
you try to start learning.

2324
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:17,460
We'll just start trying to learn.
Some of the worDs that people use in

2325
01:56:17,461 --> 01:56:19,060
their culture and then,
oh,

2326
01:56:19,090 --> 01:56:20,720
I forgot how you say it,
cups,

2327
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:24,000
zoom crop.
I think that's how you said it's like

2328
01:56:24,210 --> 01:56:29,070
hello and good morning and but they all
say that and eveRyone makes a lotus

2329
01:56:29,071 --> 01:56:31,500
flower with their hands.
It's so common.

2330
01:56:31,530 --> 01:56:34,410
Everywhere you go,
people greet you and they do thIs and

2331
01:56:34,411 --> 01:56:36,690
it's such a warm,
friendly,

2332
01:56:36,930 --> 01:56:39,060
peaceful way of greeting each other.

2333
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:40,920
And so one of the things that we talked
about it,

2334
01:56:40,921 --> 01:56:41,754
I was like,
you know,

2335
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:45,810
everybody's like way more friendly and
like greeting and this thing about

2336
01:56:45,811 --> 01:56:49,050
clapping their hands together and they
all agree to do it and everyone can sort

2337
01:56:49,051 --> 01:56:53,400
of.
It's like this unique pattern that

2338
01:56:53,401 --> 01:56:56,190
people can fall into and people fall
into all sorts of patterns.

2339
01:56:56,400 --> 01:57:00,000
They fall into like really aggressive
patterns of honking at people on the

2340
01:57:00,001 --> 01:57:04,110
road and driving real fast and then they
fall into these peaceful patterns and

2341
01:57:04,111 --> 01:57:07,470
some of it's dictated by culture.
Some of It's dictated by climate.

2342
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:10,860
Some of it is dictated by the economic
situation in the world they're in,

2343
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:15,990
but it's such a weird trip to go to
different places and see like,

2344
01:57:15,991 --> 01:57:16,561
okay,
yeah,

2345
01:57:16,561 --> 01:57:18,300
if I lived over here,
this is how I'd rocket,

2346
01:57:18,330 --> 01:57:22,560
I'd be wearing flip flops and shorts and
I'd get around this way and this is the

2347
01:57:22,561 --> 01:57:23,730
kind of food that I would eat.

2348
01:57:23,730 --> 01:57:28,470
And real spicy because you know,
you kind of have to have those spices

2349
01:57:28,471 --> 01:57:31,190
actually protect against bacteria
because they're there.

2350
01:57:31,191 --> 01:57:34,530
They're actually antIbacterial.
Was the food grade fucking amazing.

2351
01:57:34,531 --> 01:57:36,540
We took some court,
we took classes,

2352
01:57:36,541 --> 01:57:38,610
we learned how to cook over there.
Yeah,

2353
01:57:38,611 --> 01:57:40,080
it was amazing.
It was amazing.

2354
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:42,930
But my kid got lit up by bugs.
Whew.

2355
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:47,670
There's a thing called tsetse flies.
I think that's what they're called.

2356
01:57:47,671 --> 01:57:51,150
I forget what they're called,
but my youngest had a horrible allergic

2357
01:57:51,151 --> 01:57:54,150
reaction to some of the bugs over there
get.

2358
01:57:54,330 --> 01:57:55,890
And you know,
you think like,

2359
01:57:55,891 --> 01:57:56,724
okay,
like,

2360
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:58,530
what about,
uh,

2361
01:57:58,530 --> 01:57:59,100
you know,
there's,

2362
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:01,650
there's fucking diseases that kill
people.

2363
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:06,750
Malaria kills.
Malaria has killed more people than

2364
01:58:06,751 --> 01:58:10,680
anything ever.
Like more people have died from malaria

2365
01:58:10,681 --> 01:58:11,331
than anything.
Oh,

2366
01:58:11,331 --> 01:58:12,240
I know.
Yeah,

2367
01:58:12,330 --> 01:58:13,620
well that's why gates made its.
Yeah,

2368
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:14,580
totally.
Yeah,

2369
01:58:14,581 --> 01:58:17,670
and so you go over there like we were
going to go to africa is one of the

2370
01:58:17,671 --> 01:58:20,660
things that we're going to go to,
But I'm not giving my fucking eight year

2371
01:58:20,661 --> 01:58:24,500
old malaria shots.
Just know just like it's health,

2372
01:58:24,550 --> 01:58:28,410
getting really bad dreams.
I've had some friends that dave foley

2373
01:58:28,411 --> 01:58:30,270
who was like the sweetest guy on the
planet earth.

2374
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:33,240
He was from kids in the hall,
was on news radio with me.

2375
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:37,800
Dave foley was on malaria medication
because he was going to visit his kids

2376
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:40,410
in Egypt so we have to take this stuff
and he was drinking,

2377
01:58:40,411 --> 01:58:42,100
you're not supposed to drink on it.
And

2378
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:44,840
he.
He was just going crazy.

2379
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:46,240
He doesn't even remember it.
He was going crazy.

2380
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:50,320
Taking reporters a microphone or as a
tape recorder away and put it in a

2381
01:58:50,321 --> 01:58:52,420
drink.
It was like losing his marbles.

2382
01:58:52,421 --> 01:58:54,750
Like I had to protect him yelling at a
guy like crowd.

2383
01:58:54,751 --> 01:58:57,430
I'm like calm down.
Meanwhile the sweetest,

2384
01:58:57,670 --> 01:58:59,920
kindest,
nicest guy you would ever meet.

2385
01:58:59,921 --> 01:59:03,490
And meanwhile he was like super aggro,
was crazy.

2386
01:59:03,491 --> 01:59:05,710
It didn't make any sense.
And it's the medication.

2387
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:09,040
He just had a horrible reaction.
I have other friends that had just like

2388
01:59:09,370 --> 01:59:12,940
horrific waking up,
soaked in sweat,

2389
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,140
evil,
nightmares,

2390
01:59:14,170 --> 01:59:16,900
demons chasing them like fuck this
medication.

2391
01:59:17,140 --> 01:59:19,600
This is too much man.
But.

2392
01:59:20,650 --> 01:59:22,420
But my point is,
yeah,

2393
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:24,480
I'd be down to go to Israel.
I'd be good.

2394
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:27,340
I think I need to go to open to that
part of the world.

2395
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:29,830
No,
I want to go to giza too.

2396
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:31,390
That's the other place I really need to
go to.

2397
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:34,210
I've been obsessed with the pyramid
since I was a little kid.

2398
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:36,330
Can be one trip.
All right,

2399
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:37,410
I'm on it.
All right,

2400
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:38,830
done.
Let's do it.

2401
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:41,380
And you can set up a debate for me and
I'm in for that to

2402
01:59:43,290 --> 01:59:43,570
go.
No,

2403
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:44,403
no.
Go pee.

2404
01:59:44,410 --> 01:59:45,250
Go pee.
Go pee.

2405
01:59:47,010 --> 01:59:49,390
I don't know if I'm setting up a few
debates.

2406
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:52,630
I don't know if I can set that one up.
That one seems problematic.

2407
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:55,930
No,
she's hilarious.

2408
01:59:56,200 --> 02:00:00,370
She's going to drag me to Israel.
She's a powerful lady though,

2409
02:00:00,371 --> 02:00:01,960
right?
Scott?

2410
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,440
She's got some,
some horsepower behind our opinions.

2411
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:07,620
Are you going to come with us?

2412
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:12,890
Got it.
You got to take pictures,

2413
02:00:12,891 --> 02:00:14,800
man.
You're a professional photographer at

2414
02:00:14,801 --> 02:00:16,040
this camera for.
Yeah.

2415
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:17,113
Yeah.
Um,

2416
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:19,840
would you feel nervous?
Where would you feel more nervous going

2417
02:00:19,850 --> 02:00:21,680
to giza are going to gaza.

2418
02:00:23,590 --> 02:00:24,300
Gaza,
right?

2419
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:25,133
Yeah.
Yeah.

2420
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:27,040
Oh,
shit could pop off at any minute.

2421
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:29,830
You just don't want to be there when it
all goes sour.

2422
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:32,450
Yeah.
A friend of my dad in the eighties,

2423
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:35,810
he was a,
he was on this weird belief to beirut

2424
02:00:36,590 --> 02:00:39,560
and he was being tracked.
He found out once he got back,

2425
02:00:39,561 --> 02:00:41,960
he met ronald reagan when he met
president reagan.

2426
02:00:41,961 --> 02:00:43,130
He said,
it's nice to meet you.

2427
02:00:43,131 --> 02:00:44,330
We've been following you.
And he's like,

2428
02:00:44,630 --> 02:00:45,980
excuse,
excuse me,

2429
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:48,470
good following me.
So yeah,

2430
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:51,390
we found out there was like a threat
like after you take,

2431
02:00:51,391 --> 02:00:53,180
but I think he fainted on the spot or
something like that.

2432
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,400
There was a threat.
Yeah.

2433
02:00:55,670 --> 02:00:57,660
You're just going to deliver a hot dog.
His name is hot dog hair.

2434
02:00:57,661 --> 02:00:59,060
He was trying to help the troops and
stuff.

2435
02:00:59,061 --> 02:01:01,460
And what was the threat?
They were trying to kill them.

2436
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:04,370
Jesus delivered hot dog at one point,
uh,

2437
02:01:04,371 --> 02:01:07,580
a car pull up next to him.
And I guy with a gun,

2438
02:01:08,030 --> 02:01:11,120
how to like rep to his head and that the
cab got the cab driver.

2439
02:01:11,121 --> 02:01:11,540
Thankfully.
No,

2440
02:01:11,540 --> 02:01:13,850
it was happening like took off and he
didn't die.

2441
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:16,220
Why would they were gonna kill him just
for delivering high.

2442
02:01:16,221 --> 02:01:19,190
Don't remember the exact situation.
Like they weren't happy.

2443
02:01:19,191 --> 02:01:23,240
He was over there trying to help someone
do shit.

2444
02:01:23,270 --> 02:01:24,740
Yeah,
I believe that's how it went down.

2445
02:01:24,790 --> 02:01:25,730
Yeah.
Fuck

2446
02:01:28,890 --> 02:01:30,330
yeah.
There's spots in the world that are just

2447
02:01:30,331 --> 02:01:34,000
so fucked up.
Like you don't want to go because you,

2448
02:01:34,010 --> 02:01:35,220
you,
you hear and you're like,

2449
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:38,400
I don't want to get caught up in that.
I don't want to get caught up in that

2450
02:01:38,401 --> 02:01:39,980
one.
I could just stay burbank.

2451
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:43,580
Why would I go and get caught up in
that?

2452
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:44,930
But then there's other parts.
He goes,

2453
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,520
man,
for your own edification,

2454
02:01:46,521 --> 02:01:48,530
you should probably go just to
understand what it's like.

2455
02:01:49,370 --> 02:01:51,920
Did you hear about those ladies that
were killed in Morocco?

2456
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:53,030
Hey,
you're back.

2457
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:53,930
Um,
you shut that door.

2458
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:59,180
That's okay.
We're just talking about going to

2459
02:01:59,181 --> 02:02:01,220
dangerous places and it's probably a
good idea.

2460
02:02:01,221 --> 02:02:06,050
But you get scared and you know for the
most part you probably shouldn't be

2461
02:02:06,051 --> 02:02:07,070
scared,
but sometimes you should.

2462
02:02:07,071 --> 02:02:09,830
And we were just talking about those
women that were killed in Morocco,

2463
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:13,700
those norwegian hikers,
they were from where they're from,

2464
02:02:13,701 --> 02:02:15,800
Norway or Denmark,
I forget.

2465
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:19,160
They were there hiking and morocco's to
women and they were killed by these.

2466
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:23,180
But one was just kidding Australia,
20 year old israeli good.

2467
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:26,870
The one that killed people that were
doing it because of the United States

2468
02:02:26,871 --> 02:02:31,871
involvement in Syria and they cut their
heads off and phone camera and they put

2469
02:02:32,121 --> 02:02:33,710
it on the internet and I watched it.

2470
02:02:34,130 --> 02:02:36,290
You watched it.
So why would you watch that?

2471
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:38,450
You don't want it.
Because I was reading the story and the

2472
02:02:38,451 --> 02:02:41,930
video was there and I just clicked it
and I shouldn't have.

2473
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:45,680
And just to see it.
It's just part of me wants to know that

2474
02:02:45,681 --> 02:02:48,100
people like that exist.
They exist.

2475
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:52,410
I know they exist,
but I don't want it to be an abstract.

2476
02:02:53,930 --> 02:02:56,240
You know what?
I watched the danny pearl video.

2477
02:02:56,950 --> 02:02:58,890
I've never watched another video like
that again.

2478
02:02:58,891 --> 02:02:59,780
Yeah,
I saw that one too.

2479
02:03:00,710 --> 02:03:03,470
I've seen quite a few of them now you
need to know,

2480
02:03:03,530 --> 02:03:05,040
I don't want to go there,
you know,

2481
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:07,520
I mean,
it's not worth it to go to a place where

2482
02:03:07,521 --> 02:03:10,550
that's happening,
but you need to know that that's

2483
02:03:10,551 --> 02:03:11,480
happening,
right?

2484
02:03:11,660 --> 02:03:14,270
In order to have a realistic perspective
on world events,

2485
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:17,810
you need to know what it is at the worst
end of the spectrum.

2486
02:03:18,410 --> 02:03:19,880
Like what is,
what is the,

2487
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:23,000
what are the consequences for rabbit
ideologies?

2488
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:25,010
well,
I've thought about that with like what

2489
02:03:25,011 --> 02:03:28,160
we decide to show and not show after
mass shootings here,

2490
02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:29,503
you know,
like

2491
02:03:30,910 --> 02:03:33,740
um,
I was in pittsburgh like right after and

2492
02:03:33,741 --> 02:03:38,741
I was because I knew the rabbi who was
doing some of the cleanup and

2493
02:03:39,030 --> 02:03:41,760
because of religious reasons and that
you were,

2494
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:43,680
you,
your bat mitzvah was there.

2495
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:44,790
That is sO crazy.

2496
02:03:45,310 --> 02:03:47,770
Yeah.
My dad knew six of the people who were

2497
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:51,400
murdered and um,
but like,

2498
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:56,460
it was really crazy to me how locked
down.

2499
02:03:56,471 --> 02:04:00,130
It wasn't like you couldn't take it.
I was there with a photographer and you

2500
02:04:00,131 --> 02:04:03,430
couldn't take any pictures at all of
anything,

2501
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:06,460
you know?
And there's a real lockdown on showing

2502
02:04:06,461 --> 02:04:08,650
people Because you don't want to terrIfy
people,

2503
02:04:08,651 --> 02:04:13,651
but I've wondered would it prick
people's consciousness about the reality

2504
02:04:13,661 --> 02:04:17,620
of what gun violence looks like?
You know,

2505
02:04:17,621 --> 02:04:20,380
like the carnage,
like the people that I know that saad

2506
02:04:20,381 --> 02:04:24,220
said it looked like a war zone and would
that change public policy and would that

2507
02:04:24,221 --> 02:04:27,460
be a posItive thing or would we just
become numb to it?

2508
02:04:27,461 --> 02:04:29,110
Like we become numb to everything else?

2509
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:30,120
No,
no,

2510
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:31,400
it's a very good question.
I,

2511
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:35,460
I'm never in favor of suppressing
inflammation.

2512
02:04:35,550 --> 02:04:37,590
even horrific information.
Um,

2513
02:04:37,591 --> 02:04:42,591
I was a big critic of that during the
bush administration when they passed

2514
02:04:44,970 --> 02:04:49,970
laws on whether or not you're allowed to
show actual coffins,

2515
02:04:50,610 --> 02:04:53,970
just coffins.
You weren't allowed to show coffIns

2516
02:04:53,971 --> 02:04:56,250
being flown back.
I felt like that was,

2517
02:04:56,300 --> 02:04:57,840
that's a disgrace.
That's,

2518
02:04:58,040 --> 02:04:58,873
I mean,
you should,

2519
02:04:58,900 --> 02:04:59,510
if you,
if,

2520
02:04:59,510 --> 02:05:04,020
if we're going to consider whether or
not we want to go to war,

2521
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:07,380
we should be able to understand the real
consequences.

2522
02:05:07,381 --> 02:05:10,860
And one of the best ways is to not just
get information in terms of text.

2523
02:05:11,070 --> 02:05:13,200
Text is very difficult for you to
conceptualize,

2524
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:18,210
but when you would,
seeing american flags covering coffins,

2525
02:05:18,250 --> 02:05:21,420
when you're seeing hundreds of them and
you realize these are your neighbors,

2526
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:23,880
these are your neighbors children's,
this is,

2527
02:05:23,881 --> 02:05:26,040
this is people that you,
you know,

2528
02:05:26,041 --> 02:05:27,840
and they're dyIng over there and you
can't really.

2529
02:05:28,290 --> 02:05:31,860
You can't wrap your head around why
they're doing it and whether or not it's

2530
02:05:31,861 --> 02:05:33,480
right,
whether or not we should have been there

2531
02:05:33,510 --> 02:05:36,750
and then whether or not they're actually
were weapons of mass destruction in

2532
02:05:36,751 --> 02:05:38,520
Iraq,
whether or not we're in the business of

2533
02:05:38,521 --> 02:05:41,160
nation building,
whether or not ron paul is right,

2534
02:05:41,190 --> 02:05:42,930
whether or not other people are right.
Well who's right,

2535
02:05:42,980 --> 02:05:47,580
like the only way we're really going to
get a clear picture is to see a picture.

2536
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:49,080
To have an actual

2537
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:49,681
picture.
Yeah.

2538
02:05:49,681 --> 02:05:54,540
Well that's why I've thought about this
a lot because rIght now I think in most

2539
02:05:54,541 --> 02:05:57,780
american's minds it's like the shooting
happens.

2540
02:05:57,781 --> 02:06:00,090
Then it becomes a hashtag,
then it becomes a tee shirt.

2541
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:03,270
Then it becomes a memorial thing,
a memorial concert.

2542
02:06:03,271 --> 02:06:08,271
I mean it's like actually sickening like
the the choreography of it and I think

2543
02:06:09,661 --> 02:06:14,280
what's lost is what it looks like and
this rabbi in pittsburgh who is really

2544
02:06:14,281 --> 02:06:18,390
amazing,
describe to me what he saw and I'll

2545
02:06:18,391 --> 02:06:21,870
never forget just the description of
what he told me and I wondered.

2546
02:06:21,871 --> 02:06:24,480
I've wondered a lot in the wake of that
and I'll think about it with the next

2547
02:06:24,481 --> 02:06:26,850
shooting happens.
Would that have made a difference at all

2548
02:06:26,910 --> 02:06:28,290
in terms of waking people up?

2549
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:31,520
What's fucked up as you said,
when the shooting happens,

2550
02:06:31,660 --> 02:06:33,180
that's what's fucked when we know it
will happen.

2551
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:35,630
We know a lot,
but yeah.

2552
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:39,600
Yeah.
Why?

2553
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,450
Why?
Because because there are a lot of guns

2554
02:06:44,451 --> 02:06:49,451
in this country and people have access
to those guns who are not only mentally

2555
02:06:49,911 --> 02:06:51,860
unwell.
Sometimes they're just evil and they

2556
02:06:51,861 --> 02:06:55,010
want to kill people and they want to be
famous.

2557
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:59,450
I mean for a million reasons,
but the fact that we're living in a

2558
02:06:59,451 --> 02:07:04,310
culture that seems to worship people's
freedom to own those weapons more than

2559
02:07:04,311 --> 02:07:07,670
human life seems crazy to me.
It really does.

2560
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:14,220
I get what you're saying.
The argument against that would be this,

2561
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:15,311
look,
look,

2562
02:07:15,311 --> 02:07:19,300
the real crazies believed that these
things are happening and that they're

2563
02:07:19,301 --> 02:07:22,780
happening because of the fact that
government wants to take away our guns.

2564
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:25,690
This is the real crazies.
Explain that.

2565
02:07:25,691 --> 02:07:28,510
I'm not sure I followed that.
They are making these people do these

2566
02:07:28,511 --> 02:07:32,080
things.
The government that the worst worst

2567
02:07:32,081 --> 02:07:34,210
aspects of our society,
whatever,

2568
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:38,840
fill the blank with whatever left wing
conspiracy that you know,

2569
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:41,020
whatever person,
whatever,

2570
02:07:41,090 --> 02:07:42,640
boogeyman,
george soros,

2571
02:07:42,641 --> 02:07:47,530
whatever the fuck the boogie man is that
the whatever boogeyman or book or cabal

2572
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:52,560
of boogie people that they are somehow
or another either using like manchurian

2573
02:07:54,671 --> 02:07:58,090
candidate type influence,
whatever the fuck they're doing,

2574
02:07:58,091 --> 02:08:02,650
they're getting people to do this and
then even creating false flags where

2575
02:08:02,651 --> 02:08:05,290
these things didn't happen so they can
take away guns.

2576
02:08:05,291 --> 02:08:06,124
This is the.

2577
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:09,790
I mean this is exactly what
it is.

2578
02:08:09,820 --> 02:08:10,653
You're right.
It is.

2579
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:11,740
It is.
It is dumb,

2580
02:08:11,950 --> 02:08:14,080
but it's real.
It's real.

2581
02:08:14,081 --> 02:08:17,860
In terms of the influence that it has,
that people actually do believe that

2582
02:08:17,861 --> 02:08:22,861
there are these false flag events that
they're designing to to get your guns,

2583
02:08:23,231 --> 02:08:27,780
that people are training people to go
out and kill a bunch of people so that

2584
02:08:27,781 --> 02:08:31,900
they can take away your guns,
so it makes them more rabid about their

2585
02:08:31,901 --> 02:08:33,760
support of the second amendment and
they,

2586
02:08:33,761 --> 02:08:35,800
they,
they feel like they're being attacked on

2587
02:08:35,801 --> 02:08:39,460
all sides.
have you looked very recently?

2588
02:08:39,700 --> 02:08:44,350
Last week?
The mindset of the conspiracy thinker is

2589
02:08:44,351 --> 02:08:46,180
totally fascinating to me.
It is.

2590
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:49,480
A midwest is actually just as good or
even better.

2591
02:08:49,481 --> 02:08:52,700
he runs medibank.
He's a fascinating guy.

2592
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:56,000
I used to do the show.
I did the show for awhile on scifi.

2593
02:08:56,050 --> 02:08:59,650
I called joe Rogan questions everything,
and one of the things that we went into

2594
02:08:59,651 --> 02:09:03,850
was a why people believe in chem trails,
why people believe that the heat of jet

2595
02:09:03,851 --> 02:09:06,130
engines,
which causes these artificial clouds

2596
02:09:06,131 --> 02:09:08,680
when it interacts with condensation,
the atmosphere and creates,

2597
02:09:08,810 --> 02:09:10,240
you know,
creates artificial clouds.

2598
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:13,570
You see called trails.
Some people believe that these are,

2599
02:09:14,150 --> 02:09:19,150
that someone's spraying something and
that this weather control from these

2600
02:09:19,151 --> 02:09:24,100
commercial jets that they're somehow
though is this gigantic conspiracy of

2601
02:09:24,101 --> 02:09:28,030
all these people involved and that this
is in some way,

2602
02:09:28,290 --> 02:09:29,730
uh,
they're,

2603
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:33,940
they're either doing weather control or
they're controlling us or mind control.

2604
02:09:33,941 --> 02:09:37,750
It depends on who you ask.
And that may kind of really interesting

2605
02:09:37,780 --> 02:09:40,090
way of discussing it.
And one of the things that he said is

2606
02:09:40,091 --> 02:09:43,480
this is like the training wheels for
conspiracy theory because you see it in

2607
02:09:43,481 --> 02:09:44,171
the sky.
Let's look.

2608
02:09:44,171 --> 02:09:45,980
There it is.
I don't remember that anymore.

2609
02:09:46,020 --> 02:09:49,630
There's photographs from world war ii
where you can see from the 19 forties,

2610
02:09:49,631 --> 02:09:51,970
you could see contrails in the sky that
looked just like the ones up here,

2611
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:54,490
but people will say,
I don't remember those when we were kids

2612
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:55,060
people.

2613
02:09:55,060 --> 02:09:55,960
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2614
02:09:55,961 --> 02:09:58,810
I don't.
And then it starts fueling this paranoid

2615
02:09:58,811 --> 02:10:03,190
idea that there's this program going on.
And then there are real programs that

2616
02:10:03,191 --> 02:10:06,700
the government is CoNsideriNg to combat
global warming.

2617
02:10:06,850 --> 02:10:09,970
Where they talked about thIs in the,
in the seventies and the eighties.

2618
02:10:10,150 --> 02:10:13,600
They talked about reflective particles
in the atmosphere.

2619
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:16,970
I think they were when they were
concerned that the ozone layer was meant

2620
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:19,270
mammals the eighties probably probably
later than that,

2621
02:10:19,420 --> 02:10:23,860
but even more recently they've talked
about suspending reflective particles in

2622
02:10:23,861 --> 02:10:26,080
the atmosphere to protect it,
but it'd be very differeNt,

2623
02:10:26,230 --> 02:10:28,810
but why do people believe conspiracy
theories?

2624
02:10:28,811 --> 02:10:33,310
what is it in the nature of certain
people that when I'm just so fascinated

2625
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:34,850
bY it.
That's a good question.

2626
02:10:34,851 --> 02:10:37,140
That's what I was going to ask you.
What do you.

2627
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:41,150
When you see it from the outside,
when you see something like a,

2628
02:10:42,290 --> 02:10:45,380
like The most horrific ones,
like sandy hook,

2629
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:50,390
sandy hook being a false flag,
what would be the motivation for someone

2630
02:10:50,391 --> 02:10:52,610
saying that?
What would be the Motivation?

2631
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:57,310
The only thing I can.
I mean the most plausible I guess would

2632
02:10:57,311 --> 02:11:02,130
be
capturing an audience,

2633
02:11:02,131 --> 02:11:06,900
like getting people to believe in you is
some sier behind the veil.

2634
02:11:07,010 --> 02:11:08,450
Yeah,
but that's only the people that are

2635
02:11:08,451 --> 02:11:12,530
projecting this in terms of the media.
Alex jones,

2636
02:11:12,531 --> 02:11:16,730
like why does he say that was my
question is why do other people think

2637
02:11:16,731 --> 02:11:18,020
it?
Why do they look for it?

2638
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:19,280
Not,
not a person?

2639
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:20,790
No,
I think that's.

2640
02:11:21,050 --> 02:11:26,030
I think the reason people look to
conspiracy theories is that the world is

2641
02:11:29,730 --> 02:11:34,730
deeply chaotic and seems to lack a logic
and people are desperate for a system of

2642
02:11:38,011 --> 02:11:43,011
understanding the world and conspiracy
theories often seem to like offer a

2643
02:11:44,971 --> 02:11:47,100
very,
very actually like an incredibly

2644
02:11:47,101 --> 02:11:50,780
simplistic explanation,
which is there's this secret fit.

2645
02:11:50,810 --> 02:11:54,420
Like if there's always a secret thing
that is a plan that the public doesn't

2646
02:11:54,421 --> 02:11:55,450
know about.
General mills.

2647
02:11:55,530 --> 02:11:57,390
The thing is that no one really is at
the wheel.

2648
02:11:57,780 --> 02:11:58,613
Yeah.
Yeah.

2649
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:00,560
The real thing is that,
I mean,

2650
02:12:00,740 --> 02:12:03,050
haven't we learned that from the trump
presidency?

2651
02:12:03,051 --> 02:12:05,630
Right.
Like institutions are just made up with

2652
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:10,660
people like they can fall apart if the
people that take them over are

2653
02:12:13,370 --> 02:12:15,110
irresponsible,
crazy,

2654
02:12:15,111 --> 02:12:16,760
venal,
narcissistic.

2655
02:12:16,790 --> 02:12:19,750
Everything that we're seeing in the
trump administration will also like

2656
02:12:20,410 --> 02:12:22,100
people.
But isn't that kind of.

2657
02:12:22,180 --> 02:12:24,410
It's weirdly.
I mean it's both terrifying,

2658
02:12:24,411 --> 02:12:28,970
but also comforting.
I think like if it's people,

2659
02:12:29,510 --> 02:12:32,420
if it's just people,
people can also change it.

2660
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:37,340
It's not like there's a secret hand that
we need to get to just,

2661
02:12:37,341 --> 02:12:38,450
okay,
what's the solution?

2662
02:12:38,690 --> 02:12:39,920
Elect better people.

2663
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:44,300
That's the hopeful part.
We think that this such as it is,

2664
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:47,630
this constant conflict,
this social conflict that we're involved

2665
02:12:47,631 --> 02:12:49,790
in right now,
the woke left and the outright and all

2666
02:12:49,791 --> 02:12:53,030
this jazz,
that there's the boiling of it right now

2667
02:12:53,031 --> 02:12:57,650
will eventually boiled down to something
more rational because if it seems like

2668
02:12:57,651 --> 02:13:00,470
if you.
If you read steven pinker's work and

2669
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:05,500
people that study violence and in danger
and society over the course of history

2670
02:13:06,501 --> 02:13:09,050
that we're.
We're certainly on an upward trend.

2671
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:13,620
Even though data shows us all the data
shows that no one's denying that there

2672
02:13:13,621 --> 02:13:18,050
are some awful aspects to our culture
today in society and crime and violence

2673
02:13:18,051 --> 02:13:21,770
and fill in the blank disparity and yes,
all those things exist,

2674
02:13:22,070 --> 02:13:26,810
but there's more understanding of that
is more awareness of that and there's

2675
02:13:26,811 --> 02:13:31,380
certainly a safer,
safer world today than was 100,

2676
02:13:31,381 --> 02:13:34,030
200 years ago.
In terms of like your own.

2677
02:13:34,350 --> 02:13:36,860
Well,
just think about my life like I am a

2678
02:13:36,861 --> 02:13:41,861
woman who can walk down the street of
almost any american city with all the

2679
02:13:42,321 --> 02:13:45,920
privileges that I have granted,
but unharmed.

2680
02:13:46,040 --> 02:13:48,770
Yes.
That's a miracle in human history.

2681
02:13:48,830 --> 02:13:50,960
It is.
Like there's one day I was at the beach

2682
02:13:50,961 --> 02:13:51,920
and I was like,
wow,

2683
02:13:51,921 --> 02:13:54,500
I'm just sitting here in a bathing suit.
No one's coming up to me.

2684
02:13:54,620 --> 02:13:57,260
No one's harassing me.
How many parts of the world could I do

2685
02:13:57,261 --> 02:13:58,670
that in?
you know,

2686
02:13:58,671 --> 02:14:01,070
like I,
I try and keep that in mind when I'm

2687
02:14:01,580 --> 02:14:04,220
falling into despair about where we are
as a country where I'm like,

2688
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:06,800
oh,
actually in a lot of ways it's still

2689
02:14:06,801 --> 02:14:11,780
like the best thing of the worst things.
It's the best thing in history so far.

2690
02:14:11,781 --> 02:14:16,310
It's certainly for women,
so I try and kind of keep that in mind

2691
02:14:16,311 --> 02:14:21,080
when I'm losing myself to feelings,
to fears that things are going to get

2692
02:14:21,081 --> 02:14:23,390
worse before they get better,
which is what I think.

2693
02:14:24,290 --> 02:14:25,660
I,
I have

2694
02:14:27,430 --> 02:14:32,430
all daughters and I have friends that
are women and I have a lot of friends

2695
02:14:32,441 --> 02:14:34,390
that are women in the world of standup
comedy and

2696
02:14:36,310 --> 02:14:41,310
I oftentimes see misogynist shit online
that shocks me and one of the things

2697
02:14:43,991 --> 02:14:48,040
that shocked me was there's a guy that I
follow and he was talking about how his

2698
02:14:48,041 --> 02:14:52,180
wife a thread on twitter,
well thought out,

2699
02:14:52,181 --> 02:14:54,760
very smart guy.
He's a lawyer and I was talking about

2700
02:14:54,761 --> 02:14:57,730
how his wife's gas tank is always empty,
so every time he gets into his wife's

2701
02:14:57,731 --> 02:14:58,900
car,
she's always out of gas.

2702
02:14:58,901 --> 02:14:59,740
I was like,
what the fuck?

2703
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:04,180
Why do I always have to get gas for you?
And then she explained she doesn't to

2704
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:09,440
park to get gas because she gets
harassed and it creeps her out and it

2705
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:11,620
was like a man will never think about
that.

2706
02:15:11,740 --> 02:15:16,740
Not only men never think about that.
The messages he was getting from men

2707
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:20,440
calling him a cock making excuse.
Oh yeah.

2708
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:21,333
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah,

2709
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:22,193
there is

2710
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:23,560
I,
I mean I,

2711
02:15:23,930 --> 02:15:27,080
I'm an idiot that I didn't think darkly
enough because of course it was going to

2712
02:15:27,081 --> 02:15:27,914
go there.
Right.

2713
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:30,170
and he told me direct messages getting
directly,

2714
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:35,200
it's just people saying all kinds of
crazy shit to him because they not only

2715
02:15:35,531 --> 02:15:40,531
are they in denial that this could be a
situation where their mother was in or

2716
02:15:41,231 --> 02:15:44,860
their wife or their daughter.
Maybe they don't have a daughter.

2717
02:15:44,861 --> 02:15:46,510
Maybe they have a bad relationship with
her mother.

2718
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:48,450
Maybe they just,
they've had so many bat,

2719
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:50,980
you know,
if a guy has had so many bad

2720
02:15:50,981 --> 02:15:54,070
interactions with women and he's not
very smart and he's just decided that

2721
02:15:54,071 --> 02:15:56,530
women are evil and you see anything
that's like saying,

2722
02:15:56,531 --> 02:15:58,840
hey guys,
maybe we should look at it in terms of

2723
02:15:58,841 --> 02:16:01,450
like how the woman looks at it.
Fuck you.

2724
02:16:01,510 --> 02:16:03,970
Like that's real.
Those guys are real and they're out

2725
02:16:03,971 --> 02:16:06,370
there.
I was at a gas station the other night

2726
02:16:06,371 --> 02:16:08,620
at 2:00 in the morning.
I was coming home from the comedy store

2727
02:16:09,340 --> 02:16:11,840
and I pulled into this gas station and
there was this guy,

2728
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:14,230
yeah,
that bulletproof thing where this thick

2729
02:16:14,231 --> 02:16:15,530
glass,
the guy's talking to.

2730
02:16:15,670 --> 02:16:20,670
I'm using my credit card and this guy's
trying to use his debit card and I pull

2731
02:16:21,461 --> 02:16:23,980
in.
I get out of my car and I hear yelling

2732
02:16:24,370 --> 02:16:26,230
and I hear him going,
hey bro,

2733
02:16:26,260 --> 02:16:28,630
relax.
You're not a fucking bank teller.

2734
02:16:28,690 --> 02:16:29,650
A right.
He goes,

2735
02:16:29,651 --> 02:16:33,550
you're taking this job so seriously.
You make $10 an hour and the guy says

2736
02:16:33,551 --> 02:16:34,600
something,
there's no money on the cars.

2737
02:16:34,630 --> 02:16:37,600
Like fuck you.
there's $800 on this card.

2738
02:16:37,720 --> 02:16:39,470
And his friend from the car saying
something,

2739
02:16:39,590 --> 02:16:42,010
he's an I am nervous.
Okay,

2740
02:16:42,011 --> 02:16:43,060
I'm there.
Yes,

2741
02:16:43,180 --> 02:16:46,720
it's 2:00 in the morning and I'm nervous
and I'm like fuck.

2742
02:16:46,990 --> 02:16:49,000
And I'm like,
what if this guy turns any of this

2743
02:16:49,001 --> 02:16:51,410
aggression on me?
What if he decides?

2744
02:16:51,430 --> 02:16:56,170
I mean he's a fucking asshole and he's
probably drunk or high or something and

2745
02:16:56,171 --> 02:17:00,250
it's 2:00 in the morning and it's him
and there's another guy in the car and

2746
02:17:00,610 --> 02:17:02,830
I'm so nervous humiliating the guy who
works.

2747
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:03,880
Yes,
yes.

2748
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:07,150
And I'm so nervous that I'm thinking of
cutting my pump short.

2749
02:17:07,151 --> 02:17:08,950
I'm thinking I just don't get a full
tank.

2750
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:10,990
Just get five bucks and get the fuck
outta here.

2751
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:12,370
You know,
don't run out of gas,

2752
02:17:12,371 --> 02:17:14,800
but let's just get the fuck out here.
We'll get the gas tomorrow during the

2753
02:17:14,801 --> 02:17:18,400
daylight and I'm a man and I'm looking
at these two guys and I'm saying,

2754
02:17:18,401 --> 02:17:20,260
okay,
if some shit goes down,

2755
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:23,620
if these guys don't have a weapon,
if some shit goes down,

2756
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:25,540
I'm gonna.
Beat the fuck out of these two guys.

2757
02:17:25,570 --> 02:17:28,090
Did they look skinny?
They look like they don't exercise,

2758
02:17:28,091 --> 02:17:29,440
but they're aggressive.
They're angry,

2759
02:17:29,441 --> 02:17:30,880
they're stupid.
I'm like,

2760
02:17:30,910 --> 02:17:33,940
god damn it.
Like all my spidey senses are going to

2761
02:17:33,970 --> 02:17:37,360
get out of here.
Go get out of here and like an asshole.

2762
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:42,340
I decided to stay and pump my gas,
but when the the these guys are yelling

2763
02:17:42,341 --> 02:17:42,700
at each other.

2764
02:17:42,700 --> 02:17:47,700
I literally went around the front of the
car instead of the back way because it

2765
02:17:49,001 --> 02:17:51,790
was a shorter path for me being exposed
to their view.

2766
02:17:52,210 --> 02:17:56,470
So I'm hiding behind my Truck while I'm
filling my tank and I'm a man who could

2767
02:17:56,471 --> 02:17:59,440
kill these two guys.
I honestly thought where this story was

2768
02:17:59,441 --> 02:18:01,870
going to go is that you were going to go
over and tell them to stop.

2769
02:18:01,900 --> 02:18:04,600
I was thinking of going over there,
but I didn't want to get shot and I'm

2770
02:18:04,601 --> 02:18:05,790
thinking,
what if this,

2771
02:18:05,820 --> 02:18:10,820
some people die now I'm saying no,
but also where you can get hit in the

2772
02:18:12,431 --> 02:18:16,300
head with a pipe thing that you have to
worry that you're going to get shot at.

2773
02:18:16,301 --> 02:18:17,560
Again,
it is.

2774
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:19,450
It is,
but it's not just shot.

2775
02:18:19,451 --> 02:18:23,500
It's just violence in general and I'm
and I'm a martial arts expert so I'm

2776
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:28,590
less worried than most men and certainly
way less worried than a woman.

2777
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:31,300
If I was a woman and I pulled up and I
heard that guy go,

2778
02:18:31,450 --> 02:18:33,460
fuck you make $10 an hour,
bro.

2779
02:18:33,520 --> 02:18:34,780
Fucking relaxed.
I'd be like,

2780
02:18:34,810 --> 02:18:36,310
oh,
get me the fuck out of here.

2781
02:18:36,311 --> 02:18:41,050
I was on fumes though.
Raising two daughters made you so much

2782
02:18:41,051 --> 02:18:42,760
more aware of this stuff?
A hundred percent.

2783
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:44,950
Yeah,
and also just raising babies.

2784
02:18:44,951 --> 02:18:47,770
Even if there were boys,
I realized that people were babies.

2785
02:18:47,771 --> 02:18:50,530
Now I used to think of people as being
in a static state.

2786
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:51,970
How old are you?
Thirty four.

2787
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:52,751
I meet you.
I go,

2788
02:18:52,751 --> 02:18:54,010
oh,
34 year old person.

2789
02:18:54,011 --> 02:18:58,450
this is a 34 year old person.
I didn't meet you in think in the past I

2790
02:18:58,451 --> 02:19:01,540
would have met you and only thought of
you as a 34 year old person.

2791
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:06,840
Now I look at everyone as a baby.
That's how I process things and it made

2792
02:19:08,831 --> 02:19:12,460
me way more compassionate,
way more understanding and way more

2793
02:19:12,461 --> 02:19:15,190
patient with people because I now I say,
okay,

2794
02:19:15,250 --> 02:19:18,580
when I meet this asshole at the gas
station to clock in the morning,

2795
02:19:18,700 --> 02:19:19,960
that's berating that guy.

2796
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:21,210
Well,
why is he will?

2797
02:19:21,220 --> 02:19:23,680
Because his dad's a fucking piece of
shiT.

2798
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:25,900
his life probably sucks.
He's probably dumb.

2799
02:19:26,110 --> 02:19:27,950
He's probably been on drugs since he was
young.

2800
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:30,900
He doesn't have any smart friends.
They don't have any money to get gas at

2801
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:32,990
2:00 in the morning.
They're making poor life choices.

2802
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:36,140
There's a lot wrong here.
He doesn't enemy discipline in his life.

2803
02:19:36,260 --> 02:19:39,830
He's never gone through any sort of
trials and tribulations that taught him

2804
02:19:39,831 --> 02:19:42,680
about things he doesn't,
doesn't or didn't receive life lessons.

2805
02:19:42,681 --> 02:19:46,010
Probably didn't get a good education.
Here we are and I might have to kick

2806
02:19:46,011 --> 02:19:48,800
this guy's ass because it's 2:00 in the
morning and he's threatening.

2807
02:19:48,801 --> 02:19:51,230
He's loud and he's probably going To be
allowed to.

2808
02:19:51,270 --> 02:19:55,040
Other people look at them the wrong way.
He's just fucking toxically stupid,

2809
02:19:56,120 --> 02:19:58,190
but it was a baby.
He was a baby at one point in time,

2810
02:19:58,250 --> 02:19:59,270
so I don't want to go over there.

2811
02:19:59,270 --> 02:19:59,860
I don't want to.
I don't.

2812
02:19:59,860 --> 02:20:02,240
I don't want to create violence.
I'm thinking he's just going to drive

2813
02:20:02,241 --> 02:20:06,850
away and eventually he did and that poor
guy who probably is probably making just

2814
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:10,790
a little bit more than $10 an hour is
stuck in this fucking cubicle.

2815
02:20:10,850 --> 02:20:15,650
This little glass box with this asshole
berating him at 2:00 in the morning,

2816
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:18,260
but that's a baby that I was a baby.
My,

2817
02:20:19,130 --> 02:20:22,790
my,
my except not acceptance,

2818
02:20:22,791 --> 02:20:27,791
but my curiosity was socialism.
My real curiosity with any socialist

2819
02:20:28,761 --> 02:20:33,761
ideas is how do we recognize the fact
that some people are dealt the shittiest

2820
02:20:34,911 --> 02:20:39,911
of shitty hand of cards and that there's
entire sections of cities where everyone

2821
02:20:41,631 --> 02:20:45,860
has a shit hand of cards and some some
make it out through basketball and

2822
02:20:45,861 --> 02:20:48,470
football and sports and rap music and
whatever,

2823
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:51,860
but that whole spot sucks.
The whole spot sucks.

2824
02:20:51,980 --> 02:20:55,160
The aberrations,
the few that make it out.

2825
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:58,700
That's not indicative of that.
This is a good place and these people

2826
02:20:58,701 --> 02:21:02,330
just need to pull themselves up by the
bootstraps is that some salmon make it

2827
02:21:02,331 --> 02:21:04,910
up.
This crazy waterfall and the grizzly

2828
02:21:04,911 --> 02:21:08,130
bears don't eat them.
It doesn't mean that the waterfall is

2829
02:21:08,131 --> 02:21:11,060
save for salmon and the salmon to get
bitter bunch of pussies.

2830
02:21:11,310 --> 02:21:12,230
It's,
it's this,

2831
02:21:12,590 --> 02:21:16,040
this is chaos.
This the fact that we don't address that

2832
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:20,540
and that our civilization just plows on
with the same stupid path that we've had

2833
02:21:20,541 --> 02:21:23,630
for decades.
Regardless of the fact that we have an

2834
02:21:23,631 --> 02:21:27,910
absolute understanding of the complete
inequality of the.

2835
02:21:27,911 --> 02:21:30,950
The real ghettos of our country.
Whether it's the south side of chicago

2836
02:21:31,160 --> 02:21:32,840
or whether it's baltimore or wherever it
is,

2837
02:21:32,841 --> 02:21:34,760
we have a real understanding of this.
This isn't,

2838
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:38,390
this isn't guesswork.
We really know and we don't do a goddamn

2839
02:21:38,391 --> 02:21:39,050
thing about it.

2840
02:21:39,050 --> 02:21:42,860
That's what makes me want to embrace
some aspects of socialism.

2841
02:21:43,190 --> 02:21:45,650
The fact that I know it's not fair,
it's not fair.

2842
02:21:45,830 --> 02:21:47,900
Look,
I didn't have a Great childhood,

2843
02:21:48,110 --> 02:21:50,010
but it wasn't bad.
I got through.

2844
02:21:50,011 --> 02:21:50,461
I'm fine.
No,

2845
02:21:50,461 --> 02:21:52,250
he shot me.
Nobody raped me.

2846
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:56,570
I got through like it could have been
way worse and it is way worse for many,

2847
02:21:56,571 --> 02:21:59,540
many people.
So all these pull yourself up by your

2848
02:21:59,541 --> 02:22:00,920
booTstraps,
assholes.

2849
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:04,010
The other thing I noticed about them is
they're rarely really successful.

2850
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:07,640
Like they are rare.
They really rarely are these pull

2851
02:22:07,641 --> 02:22:10,910
yourself up by your bootstraps people.
People who have accomplished anything

2852
02:22:10,911 --> 02:22:13,340
extraordinary.
It's just like an idea.

2853
02:22:13,690 --> 02:22:14,810
It's like it's,
it's,

2854
02:22:14,900 --> 02:22:19,410
it's a,
it's a simplistic ideology that they've

2855
02:22:19,650 --> 02:22:21,960
subscribed to.
You should have aoc on.

2856
02:22:23,030 --> 02:22:24,170
I would love to.
We.

2857
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:25,950
Her and I have gone back and on twitter.
Yeah.

2858
02:22:25,951 --> 02:22:26,130
That

2859
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:28,230
would be really interesting to listen to
us.

2860
02:22:28,231 --> 02:22:30,060
She's so young.
I'm so interested in,

2861
02:22:30,090 --> 02:22:31,440
yeah,
she's 28 years old.

2862
02:22:31,441 --> 02:22:32,490
I mean,
that's amazing.

2863
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:34,460
The whole thing is amazing.
She's just fascinating.

2864
02:22:34,550 --> 02:22:36,810
You should haVe her own.
How about when she was getting a hard

2865
02:22:36,811 --> 02:22:39,870
time because they found a video like
they thought they were going to get her

2866
02:22:41,460 --> 02:22:42,870
college dancing.
Yeah,

2867
02:22:42,871 --> 02:22:45,690
but you know what?
Everyone loved that video,

2868
02:22:45,740 --> 02:22:48,210
right?
The whole narrative that like some

2869
02:22:48,211 --> 02:22:50,640
random person on tWitter put that video
out.

2870
02:22:50,780 --> 02:22:53,250
right,
and the point is they did it because

2871
02:22:53,251 --> 02:22:54,570
they thought they were going to shame
her.

2872
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:56,880
TheY're idiots,
but how funny is that?

2873
02:22:57,780 --> 02:23:00,300
They thought it was the most charming
thing in the entire world.

2874
02:23:00,610 --> 02:23:03,340
Anyone who did not love her already fell
in love with you.

2875
02:23:03,570 --> 02:23:06,390
That's what it accomplished.
And then her response to that was her

2876
02:23:06,391 --> 02:23:08,880
doing a little dance.
She's a genius.

2877
02:23:08,881 --> 02:23:10,980
She's a social media genius.
The question is,

2878
02:23:10,981 --> 02:23:14,640
does she do her ideas?
Stand up at all will be interesting to

2879
02:23:14,641 --> 02:23:15,380
hear.

2880
02:23:15,380 --> 02:23:17,330
Ideas can evolve,
but what she has,

2881
02:23:17,331 --> 02:23:20,600
it's unique and she's real and she seems
to be a really good person.

2882
02:23:20,630 --> 02:23:24,170
She seems to be a good person.
Now whether or not I agree with her tax

2883
02:23:24,171 --> 02:23:25,760
policy,
I'm not an economist.

2884
02:23:25,761 --> 02:23:26,930
I'm a fucking moron.
Okay?

2885
02:23:26,931 --> 02:23:30,290
I don't know anything about economics.
I really don't.

2886
02:23:30,890 --> 02:23:34,390
I mean,
you should have her almost like now

2887
02:23:34,530 --> 02:23:37,160
rather have her on per just.
I just want to know about her as a

2888
02:23:37,161 --> 02:23:38,430
person.
For my.

2889
02:23:38,450 --> 02:23:41,310
My thoughts on politicians is you can
hire an economist.

2890
02:23:41,311 --> 02:23:43,280
You could listen to them.
You could talk to them.

2891
02:23:43,490 --> 02:23:47,660
What we really need is people that have
the right idea as far as we're human

2892
02:23:47,661 --> 02:23:51,110
should go the way we should behave,
the way we should treat each other.

2893
02:23:51,340 --> 02:23:54,830
This,
this overwhelming need for community

2894
02:23:54,831 --> 02:23:57,140
that we all share.
We have to.

2895
02:23:57,320 --> 02:24:00,740
We have to pull this thing together and
we have to be.

2896
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:04,850
We have to look at each other as a
community and that's lacking and the

2897
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:07,790
people that are polarizing both on the
left and the right want,

2898
02:24:08,030 --> 02:24:12,140
they don't want to look at it that way.
Don't they want to look at people and

2899
02:24:12,141 --> 02:24:12,974
say,
hey,

2900
02:24:13,010 --> 02:24:15,620
you will never get better like that 16
year old kid.

2901
02:24:15,621 --> 02:24:18,530
No need to ever forgive him.
This kind of crazy talk,

2902
02:24:18,770 --> 02:24:20,840
whether it's from the right or from the
left,

2903
02:24:21,440 --> 02:24:24,500
is what we really need to stomp out.
We need to stop,

2904
02:24:24,710 --> 02:24:27,410
we need to be nicer to each other.
We need to figure out where we don't

2905
02:24:27,411 --> 02:24:29,750
have time.
We're not going to live long.

2906
02:24:30,230 --> 02:24:33,050
If you're 50 years old and this is your
idea of the world,

2907
02:24:33,051 --> 02:24:33,621
like,
fuck man,

2908
02:24:33,621 --> 02:24:35,540
you're halfway done and you're an.
You're an idiot.

2909
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:39,110
You're looking at shit completely wrong
and you're halfway done with this trip.

2910
02:24:39,111 --> 02:24:39,944
If everything goes perfect.

2911
02:24:40,030 --> 02:24:44,740
I know we're like in an antireligious
period of the world's history,

2912
02:24:44,741 --> 02:24:47,740
but like ideas like grace and mercy.

2913
02:24:48,320 --> 02:24:48,900
Yeah.
Would,

2914
02:24:48,900 --> 02:24:51,450
would,
would go a long way in the culture right

2915
02:24:51,451 --> 02:24:52,500
now.
Yes.

2916
02:24:52,650 --> 02:24:53,401
No,
I agree.

2917
02:24:53,401 --> 02:24:57,330
And even even if it's just.
Even if it's really wacky,

2918
02:24:58,130 --> 02:25:00,870
you know,
mindfulness and yoga,

2919
02:25:00,871 --> 02:25:05,871
even if it's like comes from a sort of
fake guru we place in the beginning,

2920
02:25:06,421 --> 02:25:08,730
which a lot of times it does.
It's just people have.

2921
02:25:08,731 --> 02:25:11,810
I mean,
people have deep

2922
02:25:11,980 --> 02:25:16,030
the religious impulses and that needs to
go somewhere and so it's going to

2923
02:25:16,031 --> 02:25:20,530
politics and doctrinaire politics or
it's going to willfulness or it's going

2924
02:25:20,531 --> 02:25:22,800
to self care and wellness.
I mean,

2925
02:25:22,810 --> 02:25:23,950
all these things are

2926
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:27,260
astrology.
It's like making a comeback isn't

2927
02:25:27,270 --> 02:25:28,180
really.
Yeah.

2928
02:25:28,310 --> 02:25:29,500
Every.
Are you kidding?

2929
02:25:29,501 --> 02:25:30,160
Yes.
Right?

2930
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:31,610
Yes,
yes,

2931
02:25:31,660 --> 02:25:32,331
yes,
yes,

2932
02:25:32,331 --> 02:25:33,061
yes,
yes,

2933
02:25:33,061 --> 02:25:35,600
yes.
What's trOubling signs like?

2934
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:41,020
I mean it's like all religious expert
like that energy inside of us I think is

2935
02:25:41,021 --> 02:25:45,060
deeply human and goat needs to go
somewhere are really smart guy who told

2936
02:25:45,061 --> 02:25:48,130
me it doesn't do anything until he
contacts his astrologer.

2937
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:50,530
Everyone in la has one.
Yeah.

2938
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:52,150
No,
that's not true.

2939
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:54,070
Jamie.
Jamie does not have one.

2940
02:25:54,270 --> 02:25:56,110
No.
Jamie consults the weed leaves.

2941
02:25:58,210 --> 02:26:00,070
Yeah.
I don't know what that's about,

2942
02:26:00,071 --> 02:26:04,870
but I do think that people do have thiS
desire for a space daddy,

2943
02:26:05,150 --> 02:26:09,850
a higher power of someone that knows
something that knows more than you.

2944
02:26:09,851 --> 02:26:14,851
Some grand pattern to follow.
That leads to harmony.

2945
02:26:15,450 --> 02:26:18,190
I mean,
I tHink everybody sort of has that thing

2946
02:26:18,520 --> 02:26:20,680
because again,
what we're talking about before,

2947
02:26:20,681 --> 02:26:24,580
we do realize if we are being honeSt
that no one's at the wheel,

2948
02:26:25,090 --> 02:26:29,110
that we wake up,
we're almost like we're in a spaceship

2949
02:26:29,530 --> 02:26:33,130
and we wake up and you know,
we were in Hyper sleep and this thing

2950
02:26:33,131 --> 02:26:35,150
has been flying for millions of years
and we're like,

2951
02:26:35,380 --> 02:26:37,060
who the fuck is flying this?

2952
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:39,120
Do we know who's flying?
Are you,

2953
02:26:39,121 --> 02:26:40,390
you're not flying.
I'm not flying them.

2954
02:26:40,391 --> 02:26:40,930
Well,
I'm going to,

2955
02:26:40,930 --> 02:26:43,630
we're going to get together and with a
form of group that flies it like,

2956
02:26:43,631 --> 02:26:44,261
okay,
okay,

2957
02:26:44,261 --> 02:26:47,380
but it still moves.
It's still moving while we're trying to

2958
02:26:47,381 --> 02:26:49,540
figure out who flies it and there's no
way to slow it down.

2959
02:26:49,541 --> 02:26:51,270
There's no breaks in this thing.
We,

2960
02:26:51,271 --> 02:26:53,680
we are in an organic spaceship,
we are,

2961
02:26:53,681 --> 02:26:55,690
we are,
and we're flying through infinity.

2962
02:26:55,691 --> 02:26:59,200
We're spinning a thousand miles an hour
and we're going through space and that's

2963
02:26:59,201 --> 02:27:01,570
real and you're going to die.
That's all those things are real.

2964
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:05,560
All those things sort of make everything
else sort of pale in comparison.

2965
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:10,800
The reality of that is so Bizarre and
while while we're avoiding those

2966
02:27:11,411 --> 02:27:16,411
thoughts were concentrating on these
very minor differences that we have that

2967
02:27:16,481 --> 02:27:20,470
are really framed by our teams.
You know the team,

2968
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:22,390
this team says,
you gotta do this,

2969
02:27:22,600 --> 02:27:24,100
this team says you got to do that.

2970
02:27:24,220 --> 02:27:27,010
I can tell almost to a.
If you tell me you're pro life,

2971
02:27:27,220 --> 02:27:28,330
I go,
you vote republican.

2972
02:27:28,880 --> 02:27:30,780
Feel everything else about that person.
That's crazy.

2973
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:36,600
The idea also that you know that you're
going to die and yet there are people

2974
02:27:37,241 --> 02:27:42,241
who are spending their lives hurling
pixels at other people and pixels like

2975
02:27:42,731 --> 02:27:44,560
on twitter.
hilarious though.

2976
02:27:44,590 --> 02:27:46,150
Pixels.
I never thought about it that way.

2977
02:27:46,270 --> 02:27:50,260
That's crazy.
This is your one life.

2978
02:27:50,310 --> 02:27:51,940
Yup.
That's how you want to spend it.

2979
02:27:52,990 --> 02:27:54,670
being mean.
Go outside.

2980
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:57,070
Seriously,
like go outside,

2981
02:27:57,700 --> 02:28:00,160
but it's so intoxicating and it's so
new.

2982
02:28:00,190 --> 02:28:04,750
That's also the problem with social
media and phones in a world in which

2983
02:28:05,020 --> 02:28:09,190
people live alone and stare down at
their flashy screen and worship it like

2984
02:28:09,191 --> 02:28:10,360
a god.
This,

2985
02:28:10,420 --> 02:28:13,300
these networks gives you,
give you a sense of belonging and

2986
02:28:13,301 --> 02:28:14,340
community.
Yes,

2987
02:28:14,380 --> 02:28:17,530
and it also gives you something to think
about if you,

2988
02:28:17,531 --> 02:28:18,364
uh,
you know,

2989
02:28:18,430 --> 02:28:22,120
I was talking about jamie kilstein
earlier were accidental tweeted or

2990
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:27,130
texted,
jamie used to be but social justice and

2991
02:28:27,170 --> 02:28:32,170
he was describing how he would go after
people and then he would be locked onto

2992
02:28:32,301 --> 02:28:35,480
his phone all day long,
look at the responses and completely

2993
02:28:35,481 --> 02:28:37,640
addicted to it no matter what he did
throughout his day.

2994
02:28:37,820 --> 02:28:41,360
He was checking his phone every couple
minutes and couldn't help that

2995
02:28:41,361 --> 02:28:43,580
compulsion.
That's a lot of people out there that

2996
02:28:43,581 --> 02:28:46,940
are locked into this.
Yes,

2997
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:48,550
it is an addiction.
I've had to get.

2998
02:28:48,640 --> 02:28:51,530
I mean,
like I had a small period of a few

2999
02:28:51,530 --> 02:28:52,850
months where I had not really been on
twitter.

3000
02:28:52,851 --> 02:28:56,120
I joined the times.
That sort of thing happened to me and

3001
02:28:56,121 --> 02:28:58,100
then I was like,
this is horrible.

3002
02:28:58,160 --> 02:29:03,070
Like I hate the way this is physically
making me feel like I'm nauseous and

3003
02:29:03,080 --> 02:29:04,830
sweating like,
I,

3004
02:29:04,940 --> 02:29:07,160
I hate this,
I can't do this.

3005
02:29:07,470 --> 02:29:09,710
IT's to be a better way saying something
mean to you,

3006
02:29:09,740 --> 02:29:10,430
oh my god.

3007
02:29:10,430 --> 02:29:13,240
And then you look at it and you're like,
I should say something back like this

3008
02:29:13,430 --> 02:29:14,780
really intense.
And then people,

3009
02:29:14,781 --> 02:29:16,640
you see them like formulating and like,
hey man,

3010
02:29:16,641 --> 02:29:17,970
what are you doing?
I'm in,

3011
02:29:18,100 --> 02:29:20,030
I'm in the middle.
I'm in mortal kombat here.

3012
02:29:20,210 --> 02:29:23,240
Mortal online to know you,
you catch yourself.

3013
02:29:23,241 --> 02:29:26,900
Like I remember I was at a dinner party
once and I was like ta describing some

3014
02:29:26,901 --> 02:29:29,330
twitter fight I was at and I was like,
oh my god,

3015
02:29:29,331 --> 02:29:34,070
I've become one of those people and I'm,
I'm not going to allow myself to be thAt

3016
02:29:34,071 --> 02:29:36,050
person.
But you have to fight it.

3017
02:29:36,170 --> 02:29:39,020
You do have to fight it and you have to
be aware of what it is,

3018
02:29:39,410 --> 02:29:42,890
you know,
like it feels like something you have to

3019
02:29:42,891 --> 02:29:43,860
pay attention to.
Right.

3020
02:29:43,970 --> 02:29:47,060
But the beauty is that I get to write
for the New York times.

3021
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:48,080
Yeah.

3022
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:50,300
I'd like to put my energy into that.
Yeah.

3023
02:29:50,420 --> 02:29:54,170
And when you do get criticism from your
articles,

3024
02:29:54,260 --> 02:29:59,260
do you get it in the form of like,
what is really scary email today?

3025
02:29:59,451 --> 02:30:01,130
I get emails,
I get tweets,

3026
02:30:01,131 --> 02:30:03,620
I get everything,
everything everyone gets.

3027
02:30:03,621 --> 02:30:06,680
I get letters in the mail sometimes.
Do you want to talk about it?

3028
02:30:06,740 --> 02:30:07,750
Like what?
No,

3029
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:09,820
I mean it's.
Wait.

3030
02:30:10,160 --> 02:30:11,190
No,
I mean I can.

3031
02:30:11,220 --> 02:30:13,170
I can.
I don't think it's so unusual,

3032
02:30:13,171 --> 02:30:14,870
like that's part of,
you know,

3033
02:30:14,871 --> 02:30:17,630
I write things that people find
provocative.

3034
02:30:17,631 --> 02:30:21,110
I expect to provoke a reaction.
I'm okay with that.

3035
02:30:21,530 --> 02:30:23,360
And when there are things that are
scary,

3036
02:30:23,780 --> 02:30:25,520
you know,
the New York times is really good about

3037
02:30:25,521 --> 02:30:30,521
monitoring that
there's no way I don't like to be in a

3038
02:30:30,531 --> 02:30:34,190
field that's got getting attacked as an
enemy of the people by the president of

3039
02:30:34,191 --> 02:30:37,910
the United States.
We're super excited about that.

3040
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:39,650
It's so bizarre.
The guy,

3041
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:42,620
he's so petty that he calls it like the
failing needed,

3042
02:30:42,830 --> 02:30:47,830
but it's so irresponsible like there.
I'm shocked that there has not been more

3043
02:30:49,281 --> 02:30:51,740
violence perpetrated on members of the
press.

3044
02:30:51,830 --> 02:30:52,760
I'm really,
I really am.

3045
02:30:53,960 --> 02:30:54,980
What do you think happens with him?

3046
02:30:57,030 --> 02:30:59,030
I don't know who can feed us.
I don't know who can beat him.

3047
02:30:59,060 --> 02:31:00,770
Who do you think can beat him?
That's good question.

3048
02:31:02,180 --> 02:31:03,350
Don't know.
Hillary can't.

3049
02:31:03,800 --> 02:31:06,950
I'm so worried.
I'm so worried.

3050
02:31:06,951 --> 02:31:09,620
She's going to run again.
She's going to muscle her way to the

3051
02:31:09,621 --> 02:31:13,370
top.
I don't know who can beat him right now

3052
02:31:13,900 --> 02:31:14,660
and I'm,
I'm,

3053
02:31:14,660 --> 02:31:17,360
I don't know.
Why do you think that the question

3054
02:31:17,361 --> 02:31:19,710
right?
If things keep going further and further

3055
02:31:19,711 --> 02:31:20,070
south.
What

3056
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:22,020
about someone who is a centrist
democrat?

3057
02:31:22,021 --> 02:31:25,230
Doesn't that make more sense that
someone who's gonna who's a rational

3058
02:31:25,231 --> 02:31:29,040
person who's on the right is going to
look at this person who's maybe

3059
02:31:29,310 --> 02:31:33,510
economically conservative but socially
liberal and say this is really where I'm

3060
02:31:33,511 --> 02:31:35,790
leaning towards one on the far left and
like on,

3061
02:31:35,850 --> 02:31:39,060
on an identity politics platform scares
me.

3062
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:41,550
Yeah.
That's not going to work well,

3063
02:31:41,690 --> 02:31:44,310
could it?
Because I don't know because trump's

3064
02:31:44,311 --> 02:31:49,230
whole thing was screw the center.
I Just need to make my base go ape shit

3065
02:31:49,231 --> 02:31:51,720
crazy for me,
but they're still apeshit crazy and no

3066
02:31:51,721 --> 02:31:54,800
matter what he does and I'm worried that
the left that the democrats are going to

3067
02:31:54,810 --> 02:31:56,640
try and replicate that strategy and be
like,

3068
02:31:56,641 --> 02:32:00,450
we just need to make our base go ape
shit crazy rather than running someone

3069
02:32:00,451 --> 02:32:03,570
that can win the center.
I see where You're going,

3070
02:32:03,571 --> 02:32:07,740
but I think that this is maybe my
liberal bias,

3071
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:10,890
but I think that people on the left
wouldn't fall for that the same way

3072
02:32:10,891 --> 02:32:11,820
people in the right word.

3073
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:17,120
I don't think people on the left who saw
someone who went ape shit full woke far

3074
02:32:17,401 --> 02:32:19,260
left.
I think there's a lot of people in the

3075
02:32:19,261 --> 02:32:20,010
center and be like,
well,

3076
02:32:20,010 --> 02:32:21,820
I'm going to just get a vote.
Libertarian man.

3077
02:32:21,821 --> 02:32:23,640
I'm going to vote for Gary Johnson or
some shit.

3078
02:32:23,670 --> 02:32:24,840
but okay,
so who's in right now?

3079
02:32:24,841 --> 02:32:27,630
So we have kamala,
kirsten gillibrand,

3080
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:32,490
whole month's dress,
monster ds ideas.

3081
02:32:32,700 --> 02:32:34,950
Well,
when she was 22 she had.

3082
02:32:35,140 --> 02:32:37,740
She's in a solid toady.
What does that mean?

3083
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:40,980
She is toady.
I think that I use that word correctly.

3084
02:32:40,981 --> 02:32:42,920
Jamie,
can you check with toady means like

3085
02:32:42,930 --> 02:32:44,280
towing the line?
Is that what it means?

3086
02:32:44,370 --> 02:32:45,600
No,
I think it's like a

3087
02:32:48,490 --> 02:32:52,300
t o a d I e.
What does that mean?

3088
02:32:54,310 --> 02:32:55,750
I think it means,
and I think it means

3089
02:32:56,620 --> 02:32:57,453
there you go.

3090
02:32:59,860 --> 02:33:02,220
Toady definition of tony's,
a person,

3091
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:07,060
planners or defers to others.
Can I kind of self serving reasons a

3092
02:33:07,080 --> 02:33:09,010
sycophant.
So she's in assad,

3093
02:33:09,150 --> 02:33:11,140
sycophants that what you're saying?
Yeah,

3094
02:33:11,141 --> 02:33:12,250
that's true.
That's

3095
02:33:13,860 --> 02:33:16,720
known about her.
Like what did she say?

3096
02:33:16,721 --> 02:33:20,020
That I don't.
I don't remember the details I've read

3097
02:33:20,021 --> 02:33:23,710
it should say that before we say that
about or we should probably read it

3098
02:33:23,711 --> 02:33:25,270
rather well.
I have read it.

3099
02:33:25,360 --> 02:33:26,530
Normally we should write.
Oh,

3100
02:33:26,740 --> 02:33:28,600
okay.
Just so we know what she said.

3101
02:33:30,050 --> 02:33:31,480
Look,
I really enjoyed talking to her.

3102
02:33:31,481 --> 02:33:33,160
I like her a lot.
Are you serious?

3103
02:33:33,161 --> 02:33:34,180
Yeah.
Like talking to her.

3104
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:36,160
A lot of talking to her.
I don't know about.

3105
02:33:36,250 --> 02:33:38,650
I think she's like the mother lode of
bad ideas.

3106
02:33:39,100 --> 02:33:42,220
Whoa.
I'm pretty positive about that.

3107
02:33:42,310 --> 02:33:44,860
especially on the side,
but maybe I'm wrong.

3108
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:48,640
I don't think I'm wrong.
Well,

3109
02:33:48,700 --> 02:33:53,620
my take on her was that I think as a
person who's coming from the left who is

3110
02:33:53,621 --> 02:33:57,970
also a veteran and is very articulate
and sensible and a woman,

3111
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:01,330
and in talking to her and we didn't get
into a sod or any of those things,

3112
02:34:01,750 --> 02:34:06,740
but talking to her about what she feels
is wrong with the current administration

3113
02:34:06,741 --> 02:34:10,120
and the way things are running in a
direction she thinks things could go in,

3114
02:34:10,210 --> 02:34:11,800
sheds a very promising ideas.
I don't.

3115
02:34:11,860 --> 02:34:13,150
I didn't know about this,
doesn't she?

3116
02:34:13,151 --> 02:34:15,640
also.
Did she ever apologize for believing in

3117
02:34:15,641 --> 02:34:18,820
conversion therapy for?
I didn't even know she believed in

3118
02:34:18,821 --> 02:34:20,680
conversion therapy.
Am I crazy?

3119
02:34:21,190 --> 02:34:23,230
Is that real?
I'm almost positive.

3120
02:34:23,231 --> 02:34:27,680
This is real.
I think her father ran a center therapy.

3121
02:34:27,750 --> 02:34:28,920
You're talking about gay?
Yes.

3122
02:34:29,030 --> 02:34:29,751
No.
Oh,

3123
02:34:29,751 --> 02:34:31,220
I didn't know that.
I never heard that.

3124
02:34:31,260 --> 02:34:34,400
I did hear something about when she was
very young.

3125
02:34:34,401 --> 02:34:37,940
She was like 22.
She had said something about gay

3126
02:34:37,941 --> 02:34:41,090
marriage and civil unions.
If she apologized for it and said that

3127
02:34:41,091 --> 02:34:44,180
she evolved.
She reveals she met assad In Syria

3128
02:34:44,181 --> 02:34:46,880
without informing top democrats.
She's.

3129
02:34:47,420 --> 02:34:51,590
She said she went on a fact finding
mission in supportive piece for syrian

3130
02:34:51,591 --> 02:34:54,590
people,
but characterize us backed rebels' as

3131
02:34:54,591 --> 02:34:55,424
terrorists.

3132
02:34:57,700 --> 02:34:58,590
yeah.
She's.

3133
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:00,913
I mean,

3134
02:35:01,930 --> 02:35:03,370
I can keep looking,
but I just.

3135
02:35:03,610 --> 02:35:06,180
I'm telling me it's time to research
everything all at the same time.

3136
02:35:07,330 --> 02:35:09,210
I can come back on When I do,
but let's,

3137
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:10,780
let's.
We can do this another time,

3138
02:35:10,990 --> 02:35:14,050
but what,
who do you think stands out for you as

3139
02:35:14,051 --> 02:35:15,460
someone that would make a good
president?

3140
02:35:15,650 --> 02:35:17,650
She wants touted working for an anti gay
group that,

3141
02:35:17,651 --> 02:35:19,060
that conversion therapy.
Anyway,

3142
02:35:19,480 --> 02:35:22,620
she wants touted working for an anti.
She worked for an anti gay group.

3143
02:35:22,640 --> 02:35:24,520
She worked for them like she had a job
there,

3144
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:29,100
you know,
I'm worried as a person who's been

3145
02:35:29,101 --> 02:35:32,190
called.
All right adjacent worry about labels.

3146
02:35:32,191 --> 02:35:33,024
No,
I understand,

3147
02:35:33,450 --> 02:35:36,210
but you know what I mean?
Rep tulsi gabbard in the early two

3148
02:35:36,211 --> 02:35:39,690
thousands touted working for her
father's anti gay organization which

3149
02:35:39,691 --> 02:35:43,590
mobilized to pass a measure against same
sex marriage in Hawaii and perverted and

3150
02:35:43,591 --> 02:35:45,570
promoted controversial conversion
therapy.

3151
02:35:46,640 --> 02:35:47,473
Yeah.

3152
02:35:47,960 --> 02:35:51,090
Fyi.
Conversion therapies.

3153
02:35:51,100 --> 02:35:55,100
The weirdest shit of all time.
There was a an article that I read

3154
02:35:55,940 --> 02:35:57,320
about,
they were.

3155
02:35:57,590 --> 02:36:01,310
They were manipulating pleasure.
It turned out it's.

3156
02:36:01,311 --> 02:36:04,040
I start,
I started reading it from a study on

3157
02:36:04,041 --> 02:36:07,160
rats.
They did this thing with rats where they

3158
02:36:08,090 --> 02:36:10,460
provided.
They've figured out a way to give rats

3159
02:36:10,461 --> 02:36:11,294
orgasms.

3160
02:36:11,470 --> 02:36:15,160
I figured out a way to jazz up the
pleasure center of the brain

3161
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:18,610
and they would do anything to do it.
They would,

3162
02:36:18,640 --> 02:36:20,640
they would shock,
they would run up,

3163
02:36:20,740 --> 02:36:25,300
pass an area that shocked them,
like they do do anything to get to this

3164
02:36:25,301 --> 02:36:27,940
area where they could have these orgasms
and they would have them up to 2000

3165
02:36:27,941 --> 02:36:30,700
times a day.
They wOuld just not just all day long

3166
02:36:31,690 --> 02:36:36,690
and in reading male and female rats,
rats,

3167
02:36:37,280 --> 02:36:38,280
just just,
just,

3168
02:36:38,660 --> 02:36:43,270
just rats trying to come.
And so when I was a love that we're in

3169
02:36:43,271 --> 02:36:46,150
our three talking about rat orgasms.
Oh,

3170
02:36:46,151 --> 02:36:48,070
it's amazing studies.
Amazing.

3171
02:36:48,100 --> 02:36:50,390
Well tHis.
Sorry folks.

3172
02:36:51,440 --> 02:36:56,440
Mr. Mrs. Weiss time to turn away.
They did it with a gay man while they

3173
02:36:56,901 --> 02:36:59,360
were doing this.
This is in the 19 seventies.

3174
02:36:59,570 --> 02:37:02,360
There's a couple different studies that
they did,

3175
02:37:02,361 --> 02:37:07,040
but one of them they did with this gay
guy where they tried to stimulate

3176
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:11,750
certain parts of his brain while they
were showing him heterosexual porn and

3177
02:37:11,751 --> 02:37:15,620
they were trying to convert him into
being heterosexual and apparently they

3178
02:37:15,621 --> 02:37:20,000
had some meager amount of success with
this where he engaged in sexual

3179
02:37:20,001 --> 02:37:24,830
relationships with women and and
apparently even enjoyed it and they did

3180
02:37:24,831 --> 02:37:29,831
something to the literally stimulate a
part of his brain that would excite

3181
02:37:29,841 --> 02:37:34,841
arousal and tried to connect that with
with heterosexual porn and made him

3182
02:37:38,390 --> 02:37:43,220
orgasm,
made him masturbate to orgasm while they

3183
02:37:43,221 --> 02:37:46,550
were doing this and showing him straight
porn and the idea was they were going to

3184
02:37:46,551 --> 02:37:47,630
reprogram his mind.

3185
02:37:47,690 --> 02:37:49,460
HOw'd that work out?
It didn't,

3186
02:37:49,490 --> 02:37:51,890
but It did.
It did in terms of short term,

3187
02:37:52,010 --> 02:37:54,900
but it didn't mean it must have been
just massively confused.

3188
02:37:54,980 --> 02:37:59,030
Obviously sexuality is not just about
what makes you have an orgasm.

3189
02:37:59,090 --> 02:37:59,691
No,
it's not.

3190
02:37:59,691 --> 02:38:03,470
It's also incredibly.
It's incredibly complex and one of the

3191
02:38:03,471 --> 02:38:08,471
things that happens is you get.
You can have gay experiences when you're

3192
02:38:10,791 --> 02:38:13,250
young.
If someone does something to you in

3193
02:38:13,290 --> 02:38:17,220
imprints upon you arousal at a young age
with,

3194
02:38:17,270 --> 02:38:21,080
with gay experiences,
sometimes even heterosexual men will get

3195
02:38:21,081 --> 02:38:26,081
aroused by certain gay images and gay
things because of their past because of

3196
02:38:26,841 --> 02:38:27,670
that,
like chris,

3197
02:38:27,670 --> 02:38:32,050
but
that we're all on a spectrum of

3198
02:38:32,080 --> 02:38:33,310
sexuality and

3199
02:38:33,830 --> 02:38:35,390
yes,
I think so for sure.

3200
02:38:35,391 --> 02:38:37,490
We all certainly are,
but it's also speculative.

3201
02:38:37,491 --> 02:38:42,491
How much of that spectrum is influenced
by your environment versus your jeans

3202
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:45,980
and you know,
and this is very taboo for some people

3203
02:38:46,010 --> 02:38:47,990
discuss even though it's really
fascinating.

3204
02:38:48,350 --> 02:38:51,200
Human sexuality is incredibly
fascinating and there's,

3205
02:38:51,260 --> 02:38:56,260
there's some major taboo areas of
exploration and when you start looking

3206
02:38:58,461 --> 02:39:01,550
at like what makes a person gay or
straight,

3207
02:39:01,910 --> 02:39:04,700
whether it's nature or nurture,
whether it's a combination of those

3208
02:39:04,701 --> 02:39:08,150
things where if someone's just radically
gay from the room or whether someone's

3209
02:39:08,151 --> 02:39:10,220
radically straight from the womb,
these,

3210
02:39:10,310 --> 02:39:13,790
these studies where they were trying to,
they were trying to turn someone with

3211
02:39:13,791 --> 02:39:16,970
science and they were trying to turn
someone straight.

3212
02:39:17,050 --> 02:39:17,620
It's,
it's,

3213
02:39:17,620 --> 02:39:18,680
uh,
it's very.

3214
02:39:18,740 --> 02:39:20,960
You couldn't do it today.
You'd never be able to do it today in

3215
02:39:20,961 --> 02:39:21,770
America.
Yeah,

3216
02:39:21,770 --> 02:39:23,400
I believe it was 71.
They did it.

3217
02:39:23,420 --> 02:39:25,250
I'll look it up.
I'll send it to you.

3218
02:39:25,490 --> 02:39:27,110
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

3219
02:39:28,010 --> 02:39:30,380
Widely criticized,
but heavily studied.

3220
02:39:31,130 --> 02:39:33,320
The woman,
they did it to a woman to and they.

3221
02:39:33,350 --> 02:39:35,590
They stuck these.
This woman had a problem with pain

3222
02:39:35,620 --> 02:39:39,350
killers and so they figured out a way to
wire her brain.

3223
02:39:39,650 --> 02:39:44,150
Is this like electric shock therapy?
These fucking dental drills,

3224
02:39:44,310 --> 02:39:49,310
but only on their brains
can do whatever they wanted to get high.

3225
02:39:51,250 --> 02:39:54,600
WHen does this.
Now's the time we break out the elan

3226
02:39:54,601 --> 02:39:55,434
musk.
We'd.

3227
02:39:55,470 --> 02:39:56,820
OH my god.
That was crazy.

3228
02:39:56,821 --> 02:39:58,470
I watched every minute of it was stop
thing.

3229
02:39:58,590 --> 02:40:01,620
We drank whiskey for two hours for when
I say crazy,

3230
02:40:01,621 --> 02:40:05,100
I mean like an amazing get like
journalistically.

3231
02:40:05,101 --> 02:40:06,120
Yeah,
it was awesome.

3232
02:40:06,350 --> 02:40:07,080
No

3233
02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:11,280
is really cool and I have to thank some
of his friends that I'm friends with

3234
02:40:11,281 --> 02:40:13,560
that convinced him to do that.
Yeah,

3235
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:17,550
that was a fascinating conversation.
I thought it was nothing.

3236
02:40:17,880 --> 02:40:19,920
I thought so.
We smoked a little pot.

3237
02:40:20,040 --> 02:40:22,040
I didn't.
I literally didn't think of it.

3238
02:40:22,380 --> 02:40:24,720
Amy thing he does.
It's fascinating.

3239
02:40:25,500 --> 02:40:28,680
That's what.
Why aren't really wanted to talk to him

3240
02:40:28,681 --> 02:40:31,890
about what his thought process like,
like what's going on.

3241
02:40:31,920 --> 02:40:34,230
I know something different is going on
in his head.

3242
02:40:34,231 --> 02:40:35,040
Right?
You know,

3243
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:37,380
you ever talked to someone where you
know,

3244
02:40:37,381 --> 02:40:42,260
because I have children and I do like to
think of people's babies that become,

3245
02:40:42,760 --> 02:40:43,830
you know,
what they are,

3246
02:40:44,250 --> 02:40:47,700
see them in front of me right now and
this constant state of evolution.

3247
02:40:47,910 --> 02:40:51,480
But sometimes I'll run into someone
that's depressingly stupid where I

3248
02:40:51,481 --> 02:40:52,620
realized like,
god damn,

3249
02:40:52,621 --> 02:40:55,560
this guy's got a nine volt brain.
They just do.

3250
02:40:55,650 --> 02:40:57,750
Some people just do it.
No one wants to admit that.

3251
02:40:57,840 --> 02:41:01,140
And we're not talking about mental
retardation or any sort of a disease

3252
02:41:01,141 --> 02:41:03,780
down syndrome or something like that.
We're talking about people that are just

3253
02:41:03,781 --> 02:41:06,030
toxic,
stupid and they do exist.

3254
02:41:06,031 --> 02:41:09,030
Just like some people have big noses,
some people have little noses.

3255
02:41:09,080 --> 02:41:11,480
So when you were talking to elon musk,
did you get the sense that you were

3256
02:41:11,481 --> 02:41:14,480
talking to like a genius?
What did it feel like?

3257
02:41:14,481 --> 02:41:18,110
I'm a chimp champion here.
That firstly.

3258
02:41:18,130 --> 02:41:20,600
Yeah.
I'm not exactly what was going to say I

3259
02:41:20,601 --> 02:41:25,601
am that toxically stupid person talking
to this guy really wants to create

3260
02:41:25,820 --> 02:41:29,960
gigantic power stations in Australia to
fix their grid and wants to shoot

3261
02:41:30,020 --> 02:41:33,650
fucking rockets into space and they
literally let them drill under la.

3262
02:41:33,651 --> 02:41:34,484
They're like,
go ahead.

3263
02:41:34,550 --> 02:41:35,780
What are you going to do?
We're going to drill holes.

3264
02:41:35,850 --> 02:41:38,360
God,
people are completely fascinated by him

3265
02:41:38,361 --> 02:41:41,300
and they would have watched you.
They would have watched like a silent

3266
02:41:41,301 --> 02:41:44,210
movie with you and him for two hours and
millions of people would have watched

3267
02:41:44,211 --> 02:41:45,200
that.
I don't know about that.

3268
02:41:45,230 --> 02:41:47,270
No,
I didn't want to hear him talk for sure,

3269
02:41:48,050 --> 02:41:51,620
but I'm saying like anything he does,
it's completely fascinating to people.

3270
02:41:51,740 --> 02:41:52,370
Well,
he's

3271
02:41:52,370 --> 02:41:54,710
gitelman super genius.
Legitimate,

3272
02:41:54,790 --> 02:41:59,790
like when he's not full of shit is that.
That is his thought process is

3273
02:42:00,561 --> 02:42:03,410
extraordinary,
but one of the things that was really

3274
02:42:03,411 --> 02:42:07,640
clear from talking to him was that it's
uncomfortable that his whole life it's

3275
02:42:07,641 --> 02:42:12,641
been this tornado of ideas is going
against his head and he's like,

3276
02:42:14,571 --> 02:42:18,230
you wouldn't want to be me.
She's like,

3277
02:42:18,260 --> 02:42:20,240
what do you mean man?
You know,

3278
02:42:20,290 --> 02:42:22,190
he's like,
it never shuts off,

3279
02:42:22,540 --> 02:42:23,030
you know,
like,

3280
02:42:23,030 --> 02:42:24,980
oh,
But he wasn't,

3281
02:42:25,310 --> 02:42:26,540
he wasn't,
woe Is me.

3282
02:42:26,810 --> 02:42:28,760
He was being factual and he was
probably,

3283
02:42:29,030 --> 02:42:30,030
it's probably like,
you know,

3284
02:42:30,050 --> 02:42:31,460
some people have a ringing in their
ears.

3285
02:42:31,461 --> 02:42:33,260
They have tinnitus,
rock concerts,

3286
02:42:33,261 --> 02:42:36,170
too many.
I think he's got a ringing of ideas.

3287
02:42:36,260 --> 02:42:38,390
So while you and I are having this
conversation,

3288
02:42:38,660 --> 02:42:39,500
I don't have a fucking

3289
02:42:39,680 --> 02:42:42,730
anything else going on in my head.
There's nothing,

3290
02:42:43,660 --> 02:42:46,840
there's nothing else back there.
It's just you and I talking and there's

3291
02:42:46,841 --> 02:42:50,740
no fucking grand plans.
I think he's like remapping civilization

3292
02:42:50,741 --> 02:42:54,310
and trying to make a better yacht.
I'm thinking I want a burger.

3293
02:42:54,370 --> 02:42:55,250
That's what I'm thinking.

3294
02:42:56,870 --> 02:42:58,560
He's,
he's just,

3295
02:42:58,820 --> 02:43:02,850
you know,
just like shaquille o'neal is eight feet

3296
02:43:02,851 --> 02:43:06,000
tall and some people are four feet tall.
You know,

3297
02:43:06,060 --> 02:43:08,940
some people just have a brain.
I mean there's no,

3298
02:43:09,360 --> 02:43:12,130
there's no level playing field.
It comes to

3299
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:15,820
anything politik performance or,
or mental performance.

3300
02:43:16,290 --> 02:43:18,250
Parents are,
like you were talking about before,

3301
02:43:18,251 --> 02:43:20,740
like I won the lottery when it comes to
that.

3302
02:43:21,810 --> 02:43:26,810
I'm so aware of that and everything in
my life that made everything possible.

3303
02:43:27,630 --> 02:43:29,260
Well,
that is the real,

3304
02:43:29,350 --> 02:43:34,350
the only saving grace of the concept of
white privilege is that we do have to

3305
02:43:34,391 --> 02:43:38,320
recognize that some people got a really
good deal and some people got a really

3306
02:43:38,321 --> 02:43:41,160
terrible deal,
but the only reason why white privileges

3307
02:43:41,170 --> 02:43:43,540
even something to consider Is that
racism is real.

3308
02:43:43,810 --> 02:43:48,810
That white privilege is not if the world
was barry weiss or kinds of privilege.

3309
02:43:49,340 --> 02:43:51,370
Right?
But what I was going to say is if the

3310
02:43:51,371 --> 02:43:53,260
world was people like you or people like
jamie,

3311
02:43:53,410 --> 02:43:55,930
we would never have to worry about
racism because it wouldn't even be a

3312
02:43:55,931 --> 02:43:58,450
consideration.
Jamie's on black twitter every day.

3313
02:43:59,010 --> 02:43:59,500
Love jamie.

3314
02:43:59,500 --> 02:44:02,260
What are you doing over there?
it's just been a producer working.

3315
02:44:03,020 --> 02:44:04,090
Um,
but you know what I'm saying?

3316
02:44:04,091 --> 02:44:05,770
like if,
if it was no racism,

3317
02:44:05,980 --> 02:44:09,040
that concept would be totally
irrelevant.

3318
02:44:09,041 --> 02:44:10,690
And what we would be concentrating on
is,

3319
02:44:10,990 --> 02:44:13,450
you know,
who's making the best buildings?

3320
02:44:13,451 --> 02:44:14,980
Who's making the best music?
What,

3321
02:44:14,981 --> 02:44:17,020
what,
what were the contributions to culture

3322
02:44:17,021 --> 02:44:21,070
we wouldn't care about if they were
coming from asian people or west indian

3323
02:44:21,071 --> 02:44:22,090
people,
we wouldn't care,

3324
02:44:22,150 --> 02:44:25,840
but I think the contribution of the left
to make people recognize

3325
02:44:27,870 --> 02:44:30,790
dunno,
privilege of all kinds,

3326
02:44:31,390 --> 02:44:33,670
that's useful.
It's actually useful to think about

3327
02:44:33,671 --> 02:44:36,850
that.
What is not useful is to say because you

3328
02:44:36,851 --> 02:44:37,391
were x,
y,

3329
02:44:37,391 --> 02:44:40,450
or z thing,
therefore you're out.

3330
02:44:40,540 --> 02:44:43,000
Yes.
Therefore you have no stake and

3331
02:44:43,001 --> 02:44:46,570
therefore in fact you have sort of less
of a claim on truth and morality.

3332
02:44:46,630 --> 02:44:51,490
I'm sure you're aware of what happened
recently with the woman from cnn who was

3333
02:44:51,491 --> 02:44:52,240
on patriot

3334
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:55,830
radio.
She was amazing.

3335
02:44:55,870 --> 02:44:59,400
She accused an african american
gentleman who she didn't do her

3336
02:44:59,410 --> 02:45:03,580
research.
She instead of arguing the idea or

3337
02:45:03,610 --> 02:45:07,780
discussing these ideas and she said,
because of your white privilege,

3338
02:45:07,781 --> 02:45:10,360
it's blinding you.
And he was like,

3339
02:45:10,860 --> 02:45:11,530
he,
he,

3340
02:45:11,530 --> 02:45:13,750
he gave her rope to,
you know,

3341
02:45:13,751 --> 02:45:18,400
to me like as a person does jujitsu.
He lIke gave her a room.

3342
02:45:18,640 --> 02:45:21,310
He gave her room and she went right into
the choke.

3343
02:45:21,311 --> 02:45:24,700
she has sank the choke in herself.
She explained it even further and he

3344
02:45:24,701 --> 02:45:25,870
said,
I hate to break it to you,

3345
02:45:25,871 --> 02:45:30,100
but I'm black and she must have just
felt her whole life.

3346
02:45:30,340 --> 02:45:35,340
All of our Intellectual credibility just
go fucking blush flushed down the toilet

3347
02:45:35,681 --> 02:45:36,850
like,
oh my god,

3348
02:45:36,851 --> 02:45:41,320
you just got exposed and this is what
people love about preposterous thinking.

3349
02:45:41,560 --> 02:45:44,740
It's preposterous thinking.
If it's given enough time,

3350
02:45:45,010 --> 02:45:47,620
it's eventually gonna slam into a wall
and that's what we saw.

3351
02:45:47,621 --> 02:45:50,950
We saw a truck with a fucking brick on
the accelerator,

3352
02:45:51,130 --> 02:45:55,840
just slammed right into the wall because
she thought she had a path that you

3353
02:45:55,841 --> 02:45:59,710
couldn't stop and this is the path.
It's like if you're playing chess,

3354
02:45:59,830 --> 02:46:03,280
but you have one super powerful move
that it works.

3355
02:46:03,310 --> 02:46:05,290
It's not like a rook or a queen.
No,

3356
02:46:05,291 --> 02:46:07,210
it has no rules.
It just king.

3357
02:46:07,670 --> 02:46:08,800
I just.
That's what she did.

3358
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:10,160
Basically.
She had this super

3359
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:14,870
powerful thing and it didn't work and it
didn't work because this guy was a part

3360
02:46:15,020 --> 02:46:20,020
of the protected class that she was part
of and she tried her thinking of just

3361
02:46:20,420 --> 02:46:24,140
like shortcuts to dismissing people,
but no one else could pull that off

3362
02:46:24,141 --> 02:46:26,750
except a black man or black woman if,
if,

3363
02:46:27,080 --> 02:46:31,390
because of who he is.
He had the checkmate and he's like,

3364
02:46:31,391 --> 02:46:34,190
ha ha,
and the whole world went,

3365
02:46:34,320 --> 02:46:36,440
ha ha,
because we've all seen that,

3366
02:46:36,441 --> 02:46:38,780
but it you can't say anything.
If I.

3367
02:46:38,781 --> 02:46:41,120
If I was having this discussion with her
and she said,

3368
02:46:41,121 --> 02:46:42,740
because of your white privilege,
I'd have to say,

3369
02:46:42,741 --> 02:46:43,574
look,
okay,

3370
02:46:44,580 --> 02:46:47,450
let's go through the thing.
Let's unpack that.

3371
02:46:47,451 --> 02:46:50,750
A fucking hate that word unpack.
I hate it because it's always brought.

3372
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:54,200
It's always brought out by people who
really aren't on packing shit.

3373
02:46:54,350 --> 02:46:59,350
They're just explaining to you how their
ideology trumps your ideology and it's

3374
02:46:59,481 --> 02:47:03,260
almost always like this preposterous way
of describing things.

3375
02:47:03,440 --> 02:47:05,870
Let me unpack that for you.
Oh fuck you.

3376
02:47:06,350 --> 02:47:09,940
But
he didn't have to.

3377
02:47:10,010 --> 02:47:11,150
He didn't have to say that.
He said,

3378
02:47:11,151 --> 02:47:13,280
I'm black,
and that was the ultimate unpacking.

3379
02:47:13,310 --> 02:47:15,650
Boom,
and whether he's right or she's right.

3380
02:47:15,651 --> 02:47:18,710
It's like the those words white
privileged.

3381
02:47:18,730 --> 02:47:19,860
Oh,
that's.

3382
02:47:20,010 --> 02:47:22,820
That creates so many fucking headaches.
It does,

3383
02:47:22,821 --> 02:47:24,390
but you think it's real though?
Yes,

3384
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:25,670
for sure.
It's real.

3385
02:47:25,670 --> 02:47:29,330
It's real because it's racist.
Don't target me the way they would

3386
02:47:29,331 --> 02:47:31,430
target a black person that's 100 percent
real.

3387
02:47:31,490 --> 02:47:36,490
It gets used in this sloppy way and it
gets used to dismiss people and I don't

3388
02:47:36,980 --> 02:47:39,930
think that's useful in the real problem
is not white privilege.

3389
02:47:39,931 --> 02:47:42,410
The real problem is racist.
Actual racists.

3390
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:45,020
That's the real problem and if there was
no racist,

3391
02:47:45,050 --> 02:47:46,610
that white privilege wouldn't be a
thing.

3392
02:47:46,640 --> 02:47:51,350
It's only a thing because of racists and
it's only a thing with racists without

3393
02:47:51,351 --> 02:47:51,820
racist.

3394
02:47:51,820 --> 02:47:55,490
It doesn't exist.
The problem with african americans or

3395
02:47:55,520 --> 02:47:59,180
asians or asians as the real,
like this is a weird one,

3396
02:47:59,181 --> 02:48:02,780
right?
Like the harvard thing where asians are

3397
02:48:02,810 --> 02:48:07,810
denied entry into harvard with the same
standards that white people have,

3398
02:48:08,601 --> 02:48:13,601
like if because of racism,
because they're good because they study

3399
02:48:14,001 --> 02:48:17,030
so hard and they do too,
but if you look at that law suit in the

3400
02:48:17,031 --> 02:48:22,031
language that the school use to sort of
describe them as antisocial and robotic

3401
02:48:22,731 --> 02:48:25,050
and all of these stereotypes.
So awful.

3402
02:48:25,130 --> 02:48:26,780
It's crazy.
It's so crazy.

3403
02:48:26,781 --> 02:48:30,410
You should read wesley yang on this.
He's a really interesting writer about

3404
02:48:30,411 --> 02:48:33,170
this.
We're saying you should have in mind,

3405
02:48:33,230 --> 02:48:35,630
I would love to book a book of essays
called.

3406
02:48:35,720 --> 02:48:39,140
I think it's actually called the souls
of yellow folk this year.

3407
02:48:40,980 --> 02:48:44,630
I used to.
I used to teach taekwondo for a living

3408
02:48:44,690 --> 02:48:47,280
and it was around a lot of korean people
and uh,

3409
02:48:47,540 --> 02:48:50,510
one when I learned taekwondo from a
korean man,

3410
02:48:50,900 --> 02:48:53,570
when I learned and I was around so many
korean people,

3411
02:48:53,571 --> 02:48:58,030
I was stunned by the,
the work ethic that exists in these,

3412
02:48:58,050 --> 02:49:02,130
these families and the,
the humbleness and the,

3413
02:49:03,430 --> 02:49:08,070
the,
the way it was almost expected

3414
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:12,030
that you never brag and that you work
harder than anybody.

3415
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:14,810
And I had a friend who was,
he was on the u,

3416
02:49:14,811 --> 02:49:18,210
s taekwondo team to compete in the
olympic games.

3417
02:49:18,390 --> 02:49:23,390
He was working on his school work.
He was going through his residency,

3418
02:49:24,481 --> 02:49:29,340
so he's probably working on schoolwork
10 to 12 hours a day in between classes.

3419
02:49:29,341 --> 02:49:32,690
He would put his book bag on.
He would fill his book bag up with with

3420
02:49:32,700 --> 02:49:36,300
books and run the stairs at the
university up and down.

3421
02:49:36,420 --> 02:49:39,660
And then he would come to the gym at
night and train and then he would travel

3422
02:49:40,230 --> 02:49:42,630
to compete with the world team and all
the.

3423
02:49:42,780 --> 02:49:44,370
All the.
Meanwhile he was in his college.

3424
02:49:44,790 --> 02:49:46,740
He was,
he was going to medical school.

3425
02:49:46,920 --> 02:49:51,060
I mean he had bags under his eyes.
You could stuff christmas trees.

3426
02:49:51,061 --> 02:49:53,490
It was fucking insane.
This guy was always tired,

3427
02:49:53,790 --> 02:49:55,980
but the work ethic that he had was just.

3428
02:49:56,310 --> 02:49:59,580
I didn't have one 10th of that worth
work ethic.

3429
02:49:59,610 --> 02:50:02,790
It was.
It was impossible to ignore and he was

3430
02:50:02,791 --> 02:50:06,480
so spread then and so tired all the
time.

3431
02:50:06,510 --> 02:50:09,360
But he kept working and he would talk
about his culture and he would talk

3432
02:50:09,361 --> 02:50:11,610
about his family and what is expected of
him.

3433
02:50:12,210 --> 02:50:13,920
Like he's like,
man in my house like that.

3434
02:50:13,921 --> 02:50:15,410
You just fucking did it.
Like you don't.

3435
02:50:15,470 --> 02:50:16,920
You're just not.
There's not like,

3436
02:50:16,950 --> 02:50:17,910
oh,
I feel tired today.

3437
02:50:17,911 --> 02:50:18,810
Fuck you.
Get up,

3438
02:50:18,840 --> 02:50:22,800
go to work.
And that attitude has allowed so many

3439
02:50:22,801 --> 02:50:25,770
asian people that discipline and,
and,

3440
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:30,840
and just this culture of performance and
of achievement where it's so,

3441
02:50:31,800 --> 02:50:36,250
it's so cherished that is allowed so
many asian people to excel in,

3442
02:50:36,270 --> 02:50:40,080
in academia.
And the fact that harvard somehow or

3443
02:50:40,081 --> 02:50:41,700
another steps in and says,
warm,

3444
02:50:41,701 --> 02:50:42,301
we're gonna.
We're gonna.

3445
02:50:42,301 --> 02:50:44,250
Make it more difficult for you because
you work so hard.

3446
02:50:44,550 --> 02:50:49,550
that is so crazy and so weird.
It's so weird that they as this.

3447
02:50:51,210 --> 02:50:52,500
I mean,
if you think about,

3448
02:50:53,990 --> 02:50:56,000
if you think about institutions of
higher learning,

3449
02:50:56,090 --> 02:50:58,820
harvard is the first one you think about
this number one,

3450
02:50:59,130 --> 02:51:01,140
it's number one,
I call he graduated from harvard.

3451
02:51:01,160 --> 02:51:02,600
Oh whoa,
dun dun,

3452
02:51:02,810 --> 02:51:03,740
right?
Harvard.

3453
02:51:04,900 --> 02:51:08,060
And to,
to have them so blinded,

3454
02:51:08,680 --> 02:51:11,510
it's,
it's amazing that they will be racist

3455
02:51:11,511 --> 02:51:14,420
against the best performance because
they're performing too well and there's

3456
02:51:14,421 --> 02:51:16,850
a disproportionate number of them in the
university.

3457
02:51:16,910 --> 02:51:19,310
So we're gonna make it harder.
We're going to raise your standards.

3458
02:51:19,430 --> 02:51:21,290
Yeah.
I just think that the actual,

3459
02:51:21,500 --> 02:51:25,620
like the stereotypes and the way that
they sort of fucking crazy.

3460
02:51:25,621 --> 02:51:26,091
Yeah.
It's crazy.

3461
02:51:26,091 --> 02:51:27,320
It's crazy.
You had them on.

3462
02:51:27,470 --> 02:51:29,180
I would love to.
Where's he out of?

3463
02:51:30,050 --> 02:51:31,040
Do you know?
Montreal?

3464
02:51:31,100 --> 02:51:33,390
Montreal.
Okay.

3465
02:51:33,450 --> 02:51:36,330
I've actually never.
I'm trying to think if I've ever met

3466
02:51:36,331 --> 02:51:37,230
him.
I've never met him,

3467
02:51:37,231 --> 02:51:39,900
but he's,
he's an interesting writer and he'd be

3468
02:51:39,901 --> 02:51:40,920
really,
really good on this.

3469
02:51:40,980 --> 02:51:42,840
Better than me.
Especially because I'm fading.

3470
02:51:43,670 --> 02:51:44,491
Well,
let's wrap it up.

3471
02:51:44,491 --> 02:51:45,960
We're,
we're three hours and 20 minutes.

3472
02:51:45,961 --> 02:51:47,070
are you serious?

3473
02:51:47,270 --> 02:51:50,810
There's a time warp in this
light in here.

3474
02:51:50,840 --> 02:51:52,010
Oh,
there's 3:25.

3475
02:51:52,280 --> 02:51:52,581
Well,
there's.

3476
02:51:52,581 --> 02:51:56,840
Look,
I'm so happy we finally got together and

3477
02:51:56,841 --> 02:51:58,610
talked.
It was wonderful to have this

3478
02:51:58,611 --> 02:52:00,050
conversation with you.
I really appreciate it.

3479
02:52:00,051 --> 02:52:02,840
I was very impressed by you and thank
you very much.

3480
02:52:02,860 --> 02:52:04,550
We're going to trip.
We're going to go to on trip.

3481
02:52:04,580 --> 02:52:06,170
We're going to do it.
Jamie's coming.

3482
02:52:06,200 --> 02:52:07,033
It's gonna.
Bring this camera.

3483
02:52:07,670 --> 02:52:09,320
Thanks so much.
Thanks everybody.
