1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,820
They would never do that.

3
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:04,440
Of course you billion is a big number.

4
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:05,880
I don't know what kind
of country you live in.

5
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:06,200
Separate.

6
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,140
That's what I'm talking about.

7
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:07,861
Taxes.

8
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:10,380
My 3 billion pays for social programs.

9
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:11,220
Clean the streets.

10
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,660
Who Do you want to build these bridges?

11
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,420
That extra 3 billion is important,

12
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:15,830
right?

13
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,610
The only that they're not
going to pay it in taxes.

14
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:18,240
He this.

15
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,073
It's not like,

16
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:20,040
oh,

17
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,371
that's right.

18
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:21,330
They weasel that shit.

19
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:21,840
Yo me,

20
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,141
come on.

21
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:24,230
The NFL is like charity.

22
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,760
That's one of the funniest
things of all times.

23
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:30,390
The NFL is tax free.

24
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,740
Is it team by team though?

25
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:32,680
Do they talk to the dude?

26
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:34,470
That's the whole thing is
a charity organization.

27
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,693
Please

28
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,460
franchise in the world.

29
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,080
The UFC needs to get on that.

30
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:44,700
I don't know what the Fuck
Dana White's waiting for.

31
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,020
We need to be tax free.

32
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,420
We need to be ready.

33
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,350
The UFC shit.

34
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,250
Shit should be a charity.

35
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,360
That's what I'm saying.

36
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,233
Crazy shit.

37
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,730
You imagined the UFC
tried to become tax free.

38
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:00,510
You know who else was like,

39
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,380
oh my God,

40
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:02,214
the NHL,

41
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,080
they're tax free to,

42
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,450
yeah,

43
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,320
get the fuck out.

44
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,130
And Joe,

45
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,150
that is hilarious.

46
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,020
Mba.

47
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,530
That is that they had to
pay too many black people.

48
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,513
They got to fight.

49
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,090
We're not happy with at this
99% black people got dammit,

50
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,670
make them pay taxes and these baseball,

51
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,290
they got to pay to too many Latino,

52
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,360
too many Latinos.

53
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:23,220
These mother fuckers coming
over here throwing heat,

54
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:24,721
giving up money,

55
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:25,554
bitch,

56
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,393
give me,

57
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,710
give me that fucking money.

58
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,781
Taxes,

59
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:31,430
man.

60
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,360
The people that don't have to pay taxes,

61
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,020
it's a real God damn mind blower.

62
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:35,790
It's like,

63
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,780
well how does that get determined and
like religions that make money like

64
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:40,231
religions,

65
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:41,280
like say Scientology.

66
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:45,060
Scientology is a tax payer organization
in tax free organization that was

67
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:49,830
written by a science fiction
writer who l Ron Hubbard,

68
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,520
who publicly stated that the best way
to make a lot of money is to start your

69
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:56,370
own religion and he got tax free.

70
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,650
That guy got tax right.

71
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,111
You know what's funny?

72
00:01:58,111 --> 00:01:59,070
When I got out of prison,

73
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,720
I went to try and find a job and all these
places and everyone said no to me and

74
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,460
there was this one ad that was like,

75
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,540
come learn the secret to life
and get paid while doing it.

76
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:14,541
And it was like $12 an hour job and like
1999 when I just made parole and they

77
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:17,490
were advertising like,

78
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,660
please come to this area,

79
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:19,590
you know you can learn.

80
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,390
And I walked in and it was a
Scientology center and I walked in.

81
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,830
Lady was Super Nice.

82
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:26,830
They're all the most polite,

83
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:27,664
did you fucker?

84
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,960
They just wanted to fucking sign time.

85
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:30,720
They just,

86
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,130
they literally just brought me in.

87
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,750
They shoved me in front of a screen with
like four or five other people and they

88
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:39,750
played me like a Scientology
video and then they will,

89
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,110
they,

90
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,801
they asked us,

91
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:41,634
they were like,

92
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,670
did you all understand
the truth in this video?

93
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,720
And I was,

94
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,553
I was sitting,

95
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,281
I was just like,

96
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:47,610
Yo,

97
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,780
I really wanted to be like,

98
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:50,580
well what the fuck is wrong with you?

99
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:52,620
Like no one believes this shit.

100
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,020
But at the same time
I sat back and I said,

101
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:55,854
you know what,

102
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,200
I really don't understand this religion
enough for me to make a commitment it

103
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:00,034
right now.

104
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,240
And they were very polite to me.

105
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,541
They're like,

106
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,890
thank you very much for your time,

107
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,400
sir.

108
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,180
Take care of.

109
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,590
And it was somebody else in there really
needed that fucking job and they just

110
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:09,580
looked at me and they were,

111
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,350
they gave him this kind of look like,

112
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:11,951
cool,

113
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:12,221
cool.

114
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:13,400
You're out in the running and went there.

115
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,830
I was touched.

116
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,570
I had to swear to God,

117
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:16,690
Yo,

118
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,740
I could see the charlatan and the
snake oil coming out of the side of the

119
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:21,311
jacket.

120
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:21,670
Dude.

121
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,121
They were like,

122
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:23,680
I was touched by this video.

123
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,210
Like I really thought it was amazing.

124
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:25,841
The dude,

125
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,190
they're there to get the job,

126
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:27,560
you know?

127
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,393
That was it.

128
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,500
I looked at it.

129
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,330
You might be right about
this racist shit by the way,

130
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:33,790
because the only other ones
that don't have to pay taxes,

131
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,740
the golf league,

132
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,870
the PGA and at the NHL

133
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,730
[inaudible]

134
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,710
hello dad is fucking should be passed.

135
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:49,370
Yeah.

136
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,710
Doug Golf guys don't have to
pay tax like the most money.

137
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,130
Right.

138
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:53,941
Wow.

139
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:54,930
That's dark.

140
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,800
That's dark racism.

141
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,061
Wow.

142
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:01,020
I think it's racism.

143
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,410
I'm crying racism for the NBA and
I don't even watch basketball.

144
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,780
Yeah.

145
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,240
The idea that you could get
away with the Scientology thing,

146
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:10,020
that that could be,

147
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,450
we need to start our own fucking religion.

148
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,483
We need to do,

149
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,323
God dammit.

150
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,510
That's how you're really
good at the blockchain.

151
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,820
That's how you're really locked down.

152
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,610
That's the quote right there.

153
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,750
When you start a religion,

154
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:22,560
God dammit.

155
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:22,930
Well,

156
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,800
they have so much money that
they can get away with it.

157
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,340
Like Scientology is a number
to land owner in Los Angeles.

158
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,150
They own more buildings and
property real estate in Los Angeles.

159
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,380
Then like almost anybody
freakiest thing is,

160
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,110
you know how to rope off everything
at a time square when uh,

161
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,110
when the ball is going to drop or whatever
and there's a certain time you can't

162
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,400
go past the barricades.

163
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,610
One night I was there and the guy said,

164
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:46,881
well,

165
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:48,260
you remember the Church of Scientology?

166
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:49,010
And I said,

167
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,843
yeah.

168
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,520
And he let me in through the barricade.

169
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,451
Real story,

170
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:53,870
Dude.

171

Real Story.

00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,630
He probably just wanted to fuck you.

173
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,970
[inaudible] you're a handsome guy.

174

Amazing.

The Scientologists try and make friends.

182
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:34,821
He was so bad.

183
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:35,850
It was a police officer too.
