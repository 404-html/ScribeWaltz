1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,850
The general good experience,
it's very interesting whether this

2
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:07,190
Harvey Weinstein case is going to go.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's very interesting where it's going
to go right now he has Benjamin Braf is

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,040
a charity and if you see what happened,
Benjamin Bratt push for dismissal and he

5
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:24,771
didn't get it that the lawyer said the
judge said a trial date to get a trial

6
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:28,230
date.
Harvey Weinstein is going to go through

7
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:30,420
them,
more money to pay off,

8
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:35,421
time to go for time.
Then he's going to fire Benjamin,

9
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:40,581
Braf and show up with two women,
primarily one black and one Asian or one

10
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:47,970
white and one Asian,
and this is when this trouser,

11
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:49,290
and again,
very interesting,

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,220
our results over the higher millions of
dollars and prosecute in a private

13
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:59,340
investigators.
They'll interview boyfriends.

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,580
They're going to interview this case.
It would be very interesting,

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,790
unlike the cosby case,
weight caused me.

16
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,550
Didn't really fuck.
How do you know he's going to do all

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,110
this stuff because I know this is what I
would do.

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,370
I know you come to me and you go,
I'm getting busted for this.

19
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,790
What do I do?
Because of how I grew up around those

20
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,050
people,
this is what you do,

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,590
Benjamin.
Braf cannot ask a woman the same

22
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:30,591
question a woman could ask a woman,
so I'm going to go there with either a

23
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:32,064
black woman,

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,780
an Asian woman,

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,210
or a white woman.
My first two choices are a black woman.

26
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,990
You want to get the diversity angle to
get the diversity angle and I want to

27
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:44,830
get that.
You can't.

28
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:46,690
You're saying that because you're a
black woman.

29
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,160
Chinese woman.
What?

30
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:52,150
I'm trying to stare at me.
Did you ever really watched the people

31
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:53,740
versus Oj Simpson?
No,

32
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:56,740
I didn't.
Very interesting and it said it's time

33
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,610
that you sat.
No,

34
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,210
the holidays.
Yeah,

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,580
the fx version.
I watched one episode that seemed very

36
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,840
good.
Very interesting.

37
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,190
How he pulled a dream team together.
It's going to cost you 10 mil.

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,390
Listen to me.
Gee,

39
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,420
you got two options.
You can go into like cars being paid two

40
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:18,400
mil and make believe you're blind or
we've put together a fuck it.

41
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,190
Then you see him.
He went to live with that milky shit

42
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:23,160
over his eyes,
like the guy from Kung Fu.

43
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,260
Let me,
when we were kids foods father followed

44
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,170
was like half blind and shit.
Yeah,

45
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:31,870
I remember that.
Magnesia and shit.

46
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,990
That's how will in that plan.
Like I'm sick.

47
00:02:34,991 --> 00:02:36,640
Routine.
He's got cataracts.

48
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,390
Cool.
Cosby.

49
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,220
Yeah,
but he didn't have cataracts.

50
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,050
When was that?
When he put the pill in the water,

51
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:45,000
he didn't know.
He knows what.

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,580
He knows what the fuck.
So he's taking three steps.

53
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,980
Read your fucking,
you know.

54
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,010
Yeah,
he knows,

55
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,470
but hobby has to play this hand.
This is what America is about to watch.

56
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:57,330
They're going to watch something fucking
crazy.

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,730
He knows he go in their bedroom and
Braf.

58
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,570
Benjamin Bratt had gravano look at the
list of Benjamin.

59
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,990
Preface and Benjamin Braf can attack a
woman show.

60
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:10,930
You look at like legal cases like
supports

61
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,860
on paper is to John Jones versus
Gustafson.

62
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,030
I went to New York last week and I went
to the Metropolitan Museum of art with

63
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,780
my daughter.
She loves art and while I was sitting

64
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:28,420
there I was added saying,
go on your own.

65
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,450
Because my daughter didn't want me
taking pictures in front of the

66
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:31,960
statutes.

67
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,250
Anyway.
She was like,

68
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,810
Daddy,
get out of the pictures of the stash,

69
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,520
so I'm like,
what the fuck am I hanging out with you

70
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:38,730
for?
She was in the Chinese way.

71
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,160
I wanted to see the Armenian when,
but it was funny.

72
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:46,300
I was thinking about when I was 21 and
22 Joe Rogan,

73
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:50,970
I would get stoned to the gills and go
to the Museum of natural history.

74
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,990
The museum or my hobbies back then since
I was such a loan and then people

75
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:58,030
looking for me,
I was always a criminal.

76
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,220
I would go over the bridge to either go
to one of those museums.

77
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,390
Why would sit in the courtroom?
I would go to a place that had a fucking

78
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,630
Italian sandwich and I get a bag of wise
potato chips in a 16 ounce coke and you

79
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:17,200
go to any court room.
Court starts at seven at the

80
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:21,190
metropolitan downtown.
I take the a train and I'd walk.

81
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:24,820
I forget now what you know.
This is 1983 81.

82
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:28,510
I was a kid and I would sit.
None observed hort.

83
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,610
I learned how to.
Plus I grew up in that.

84
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,680
You were what you would sit and watch
night court,

85
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:41,681
like you'd watch a basketball game,
like a game with a sandwich and a soda

86
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,980
and potato chips.
Men,

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,190
Chicago this year I think there was a
paper view.

88
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:46,910
You were there,
right?

89
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,430
Yes.
So something happened and I was late

90
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:52,070
getting to the arena and they had cut
off kind of the loading dock.

91
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:55,640
I couldn't get to it.
So I had my oldest daughter with me and

92
00:04:55,641 --> 00:05:00,470
so we're having a walk through where all
the crowds walking in and you know,

93
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,070
dudes all the golden snitch and get a
picture golden snitch.

94
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,310
My daughter's like,
what the fuck's going on?

95
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,590
How old is your daughter?
So she's 22,

96
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,000
so two days ago,
Christmas morning I'm opening up

97
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:17,660
presence.
So I get the presence for my daughters,

98
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:21,200
the three of them and my middle daughter
is very artistic and so they create

99
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:24,320
these cool sculpted beer mugs and
there's four of them.

100
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:28,820
One of them's like Bald Guy Brewing
Novitsky something and one of them says

101
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:32,460
golden snitch brewing company.
So it's cool looking thing and she,

102
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,480
she drew me a black and white kind of
rendition of all four,

103
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:38,000
which I'm gonna hang up really cool.
So then my girlfriend's there,

104
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:40,340
so she hands me the box and she's been
telling me all along.

105
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,590
She goes,
I got you the best fucking present ever

106
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:43,860
in the history of presence.
Mike.

107
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,820
The hell is this.
So I opened up the box.

108
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,710
Oh my.
She's got this series of t shirts I

109
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:55,150
think.
What size are you?

110
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,800
Large.
Large.

111
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,341
There we go,
man.

112
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:00,320
So you,
since you created it,

113
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,930
you literally and figuratively have to
wear it.

114
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:07,220
Now
this is outrageous.

115
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,950
So that picture there,
there's some

116
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,440
go baby ladies.
Gentlemen,

117
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:25,270
circle is closed.
So I posted a boot on this or something

118
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,880
that's pretty bad.
King from the new series.

119
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,060
Moscow,
I think I can say this.

120
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:39,260
Hopefully they'll let me back in,
but it's out in front of KGB.

121
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,420
FSB,
you headquarters through that building

122
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:45,440
in the background is KGB.
F has now known as FSB.

123
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,870
Oh Wow.
So yeah.

124
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:50,660
So I posted a picture of.
She got me like 20 shirts.

125
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,970
I put them on private instagram,
facebook,

126
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,800
everybody in the world like take my
money,

127
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:57,710
man.
Where can I get one last ends tomorrow?

128
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,020
Right.
