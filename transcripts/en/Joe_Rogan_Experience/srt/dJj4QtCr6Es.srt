[inaudible]

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,210
that soundtrack.

16
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,100
It's going to be responsible for some
ringing in my ears when I'm an old man.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,920
I know that it can't be good for you.
Whoa,

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:10,050
whoa. It comes into abrupt ending
getting crappy today with all new things.

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,110
The Alpha brain, is that what it is? It's
tweaked you have you taken a Brian? Yeah.

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,900
You know what I was, I tweeted something
the other day that I, right after I did,

21
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:21,750
I'm like, you know, that actually is
not a given. Probably a good thing,

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,580
but it is a good thing. Like I sounded
good. I feel like I need Alpha brain now.

23
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,150
You feel like you're addicted to it?
Kind of, but it's like addictive.

24
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:33,990
Not for a bad reason. It's addictive for
a clearheaded reason. Like almost like,

25
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:37,590
hey, I should have been on prescription
drugs the whole time, you know,

26
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,620
but I'm not, you know what I mean?
If you've got on the real shit,

27
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:42,260
why don't you get on the real one?

28
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,920
Don't go to a doctor and see it might have
something for you that works. Awesome.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,400
Yeah.

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,390
I mean you might be like wrestling with
life and you might just go to some place

31
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,830
and they might be,
if you've seen his beard.

32
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,150
Beard is like to the homeless. Yeah,
it's, there's carrot juice in it too.

33
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:03,870
I could taste it. I think it looks like
you don't give a fuck. I like that look.

34
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:05,350
Definitely looks like it
doesn't mean what it looks like.

35
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:09,630
The guy was a relaxed job.
I was just on Rachael Ray the other day.

36
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:12,780
I trim the shit out of mind like, yeah,
like I was a black football player,

37
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,130
like downlines here a little longer here.
I don't know if I like manscaping.

38
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,740
I was thinking about manscaping
in my girl's like, no,

39
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:22,650
I like the crazy homeless look
like I like it looks like you're,

40
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,690
you're the one that's, I know you've
got a good one girl. White facial hair.

41
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:31,140
Like any girl wants you to shave
all that. Oh, shave all that.

42
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:34,050
That's a broken bitch.
I want that one in your life.

43
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,960
Have you noticed like when he shaved like
underneath your Chin and it starts to

44
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:40,200
grow back just a teeny bit like a
five o'clock shadow. It looks weird.

45
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:44,650
It looks like you're a kid. You can't
over aggressively make the jaw line right.

46
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,890
Then you look like one of the gay
guys that just trying to look skinny.

47
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,550
The steam room. You, my wife was
like, you need to grow that shit out.

48
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,190
I had great beard trimming advice guys
who tried to look skinny eligible.

49
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,810
That's at least what I thought
when they walked by me.

50
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,010
So this is like the outline

51
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,620
of the Jawbone, is that what
it is? But not even really.

52
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,460
It's like where they've wished the job
on where it's like Bob from biggest loser

53
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,470
used to rock that shit.

54
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,030
He's totally gelled on
a Christian Asheville.

55
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,680
Carolina, you were on a quick Christian
rock station in Asheville. Right.

56
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,760
And they were like keep it a Christian.
And I was like been Christian. They said

57
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,450
that's the opposite of stay black.
Cause the exact opposite of stay black,

58
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,160
Cuban Christian.
Don't get no dicks in your ass.

59
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,570
I think the ending still the same. Oh
so, so he shit. Whoa. So then I go,

60
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:35,201
don't worry about it.

61
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:37,450
I'll talk about the biggest loser because
I was obsessed about the biggest loser

62
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,020
and I was like, where can we use it? Ron?

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,890
One of the biggest loser because the
girl was due and the girl's like,

64
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,800
we've started talking about, and
I was like, I go, first of all,

65
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,620
Bob and Gillian are beasts because
I've worked out in Bob Spin,

66
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:49,630
classic crunch La and I go,

67
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:52,750
he said one of the greatest
things when in a workout,

68
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,740
I remember again I was like 220 pounds
and getting ready to go home for

69
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:58,660
Thanksgiving and I'm doing
spin class and he says,

70
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,370
I want you to stay out of the saddle,
stand on the salmon for Thanksgiving.

71
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,080
You're going to see
people you grew up with.

72
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:08,740
Do you want them to look at you and go God
I wish I fucked him. And I'm like, yes,

73
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,050
yes.
And I'm pedaling and pedaling and then,

74
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,700
but I didn't say pug during the thing.

75
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,510
And then the girl goes
and how'd you say that?

76
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,620
Wished that they had been with you.
They want them to look,

77
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,030
really think your life is better.

78
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:24,860
It was like a long rant cause
then cause then I ended up, I go,

79
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:28,570
the only thing that bummed me out was
he's gay. So then the whole time she goes,

80
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,310
hold on, Bob is not gay. And I
was like, no, Bob's really gay.

81
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,170
Like definitely you were allowed to say
no, she no, she just didn't know Bob.

82
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:41,260
The guy she's modeled her
life after is a homosexual.

83
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:44,380
She had no idea was Bob,
by the way.

84
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,980
Bob and Gillian are the host of this show.
As Bob's totally gave me.

85
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,780
I've never watched the show, so I'm
just, yeah, Bob. Bob is out. Oh yeah.

86
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,740
But she doesn't know. He's not out.
Like you didn't come onto like Andrew,

87
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,250
you know, like whatever talk show
and go. So I was, I'm really gay,

88
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,610
but like not that he would
see like Anderson Cooper out

89
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,340
as anthem, Suku Brown. I
think he's on time. He's gay.

90
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:12,370
I never thought he was gay and he was
heroic. I have no problem with gay,

91
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:14,680
but he seems gay. It seems like
a very nice game man. Yeah,

92
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,200
he's definitely pretty lips.
He's Devon Anderson.

93
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:20,730
Cooper's definitely seems
like it. No he didn't. No, he
is. But I like the guy. Yeah.

94
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,560
I have nothing wrong with him. Be for a
lot of people. That's a huge issue though.

95
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,640
Oh yeah. That's all America. That's
a bummer of an issue, man. I'm like,

96
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:31,140
what do you give a fuck? Why? Who
Do you, why do you care to farmer?

97
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,870
Some dudes fuck fat chicks that Tom
Breau Kroll is one of those people.

98
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,290
Do you ever think so? It's just cause
it's competition and he's old school.

99
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:38,501
He's like,

100
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:43,501
we are coming up behind me and
the ratings making me nervous.

101
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:47,880
He's got old school gates.
There's moe decker,

102
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,580
[inaudible] cock word of mouth her.

103
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,200
I lived around gay kids
or gay people rather.

104
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,170
I lived around a lot of gay
people when I was growing up.

105
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:58,020
I got just really to it.
Yeah.

106
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,220
I lived in San Francisco from seven to
11 so the whole time we were constantly

107
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,100
around gay people.

108
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,510
The only time was ever weird was when
some dude whistled at my stepdad was like,

109
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:11,840
Whoa, that's really, yeah,
that was fucked up. I was like,

110
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,360
that's not just not just like rude,

111
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:18,890
like guys walking with his son and
you're whistling at them and go,

112
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,650
he made like a like one
of those and I was like,

113
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,670
oh this is the creepiest fucking thing
ever being seven years old and have

114
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:27,480
somebody do that.
But that's just the Douche bag.

115
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,830
That guy could have been a guy
he could, you know. But it's true

116
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,580
guy rather. He's the same guy working
the sledgehammer that sees the growing

117
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,850
or the over the aggressive,
a lesbian trying to pick up
lemon. If you ever say no,

118
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:41,684
no, no, fuck that.

119
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,740
I'm talking about the [inaudible] woman
lesbian that walks up to me and say shit

120
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:46,880
to me at a gay bar.

121
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,400
I live with two lesbians in New
York for a long time and man you,

122
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,520
and we'd go out to their bars cause they
wanted to go there and we'd go and hang

123
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:55,970
out and have beers and then there'll be
that check to just roll up on me. Like,

124
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,300
what are you doing here? And you're
like, come on, I'm just hanging out.

125
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,430
What are you doing here? No one wants
you here and you'd be like, ugh.

126
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,710
And then my friends would be like,
he's with us. He's our roommate,

127
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,210
and always wanted to be like,
bitch,

128
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,250
I'm the guy that turned you
into the girl you are today.

129
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,340
Don't ever fucking forget that.

130
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,440
Let me get you a drink. Wow. Some pent
hostility that Bert Kreischer. Yeah.

131
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,340
Wait, wait, wait. Let's go. Can we go back
for a second about our brain? Sure. Okay.

132
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:28,220
Because,
so you give me a buck,

133
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:31,040
gave it to you and I forgot I gave it
to you and I offered to give it to you

134
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,460
again today and I took it because
this is what you're telling me,

135
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:37,370
that you had tweeted about some crazy
dreams. I didn't hear them. Okay.

136
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:39,680
Not even crazy dreams we're talking about.

137
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,430
Does anyone know what a real
fucking lucid dream is? Okay.

138
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,530
A lucid dream for anyone that's
not listening. In my opinion,

139
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,670
this is what these pills did to me. Okay?
It's a dream. When the middle you go,

140
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,680
Oh fuck, I'm dreaming. We can do anything
I fucking want. Okay. Now it is good at.

141
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,060
So I had a dream one time,

142
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,580
I was going in to do an important
TV thing and I was nervous about it.

143
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,760
And so I took, I was taking Alpha
brain and in the dream I went in,

144
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:09,290
I did it and I did it wrong and it, but
it was so fucking real. It was so real.

145
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,750
I could taste it. And I was
depressed in the middle of a dream,

146
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,730
depressed that I fucked this up.

147
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,700
And then I got in the elevator to leave
and I saw that I was wearing, um, uh,

148
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,640
highlight a neon red Casa workout pants
with a matching needs. I cousin Neon,

149
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,240
a Bandana and no shirt. And I was like,
okay, this is clearly a fucking dream.

150
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,373
But then I realized

151
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,470
yourself dressed shirtless with
a bandanna on to realize, but

152
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,200
I realize it's a dream. And then I
went, that's how you realized it.

153
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:39,670
It was so fucking real spin.
Your cradle cradle.

154
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,450
Imagine,

155
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,900
imagine just off the fucking interview
where it's like everything you never

156
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:47,440
wanted to say came out right
and you handled everything
wrong. And I went, okay.

157
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,530
So I wake up, I'm freaked out
and I'm like, and I'm like, okay,

158
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,620
that's how not to do that.
I just problem solved the day.

159
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,670
I'm not concerned because I know not
to say cause I know how that goes.

160
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,390
Now I know know what to say. So then,
so then the next night, and no bite,

161
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,051
mind you every night,

162
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:03,570
my wife's telling me you
got to stop taking these
fucking awful brains cause I'm

163
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:04,590
on fire.

164
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,170
I'm like 10 o'clock at night and I'm
still talking about these ideas like I'm

165
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:09,630
fucking,
they really woke me up.

166
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,850
They go to bed the next night
I'm in the middle of a dream,

167
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:16,140
I'm doing a photo shoot and the
dream on wheelchair. And I go, I go,

168
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:18,900
what the fuck am I doing? Almost you're
doing a photo shoot. This is a dream.

169
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,350
I can do anything I
fucking want right now.

170
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,080
And I literally say everywhere we go guys,
I'm going to wrap this a dream.

171
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,140
And they go, Huh? And I walk
out and I, well I'm will sure.

172
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,340
And I fly up La Cienega right
now, fly, fly. I just go, fuck it.

173
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:37,020
I can fly and I start flying and I go,
this is fucking awesome. Now mind you,

174
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:41,400
it's also dream. So I got lost in
the hills. So I was like, fuck,

175
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:44,790
where the fuck am I? Like no, this is
real. So I don't know where the fuck I am.

176
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,130
And I ended up my buddy Lorenzo's
house and I was like, I was like,

177
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:50,070
I want to say I wanna see my girls, let's
go to my house. And he's like, okay.

178
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,430
And then, you know, in, in dreams and
they just transformed other things.

179
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,890
But every one of my dreams
has been more insane.

180
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,960
And the fact that you can interact inside
them fucking full lips me out to the

181
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:01,890
point where I was like,

182
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,210
I gotta hop off him cause I need some
rest because I'm going into dreams.

183
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,890
Fucking problems solving shit.

184
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,620
This shit going on in your brain
that use dream about that night.

185
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,430
I'm going in with the ability
to work on in my sleep.

186
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,370
I fucking love these things.
Wow. John Moore, one of my
good friends who, uh, who's,

187
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,970
uh, was one of the writers, uh, to
the, to the Chine roast was like,

188
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,430
he had heard about some of dreams.
You said,

189
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,050
I got to get these fucking
things and then started tweeting,

190
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:30,060
like hitting you retweeted
one of his things. But man,

191
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,680
these things are fucking awesome.

192
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,790
That's the biggest effect
for me is the dreams.

193
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:37,990
The way I said it is like a normal
lucid dream to me is like a bubble,

194
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:40,900
like a children's bubble.
Like it's so fragile. Yeah.

195
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:43,060
By the time you realize you
have it in your hand, it's gone.

196
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,710
Like every time I've ever had a
lucid dream before I would have them.

197
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:50,020
And then right in the middle of that I
realized I was dreaming and then boom,

198
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:52,990
I'd wake up. Right. But in these,
instead of being made out of a bubble,

199
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:55,090
it's made out of a dodge ball that dodge,

200
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,960
you can just punch it and
fucking move it around.

201
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,960
You just wake up in a dream and
you go, oh, I'm going to dream.

202
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:06,400
And you just keep going in the dream. It's
very strange. Last night I was testing

203
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,130
a plywood wakeboards for the CIA
and Weeki Wachee and I was like,

204
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,160
I was like fucking totally right.

205
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,960
I saw this video that was the closest
of what I love to drink about,

206
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,880
which is flying.
Yeah.

207
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:22,480
I think a lot of you all have
that dream about flying around.

208
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,530
Like you were saying,

209
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,620
there's this thing called a body
with these body pair of shoots.

210
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:28,690
Have you seen this video, Joe? It's uh,

211
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:32,080
there's this thing called the need for
speed and mountain carving and it's these

212
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:36,310
guys that have these parachutes attached
to their bodies and they just fly

213
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:41,170
around these mountains like just
flying over trees and it's, it's crazy.

214
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,880
Wow.
Look at this shit

215
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,510
as soon as I can get it to is
this, is this, is this the guy?

216
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,360
But they got to jump up a mountain,
right hunt.

217
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,010
I think what it uses that uses
the air, uh, like they've done

218
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,930
it here in Calabasas also.

219
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:59,650
I've seen these people with
these parachutes is just
uses like the air or the

220
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:03,280
heat of the air or something like
that. But it's a, it's on Vimeo.

221
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:05,010
It's called the need for speed
mountain carbon checkout.

222
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,810
It will freak you the fuck out.
Like it's, it's terrifying. Uh,

223
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,060
when you see this shit, Oh yeah,
I've seen this, I saw this. Yeah.

224
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,390
This does look really scared.
But these guys also die very often.

225
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,620
Do they like a lot of,
lot,

226
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,250
like more than dude's roller blade?
It seems like it's,

227
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,760
it seems like it's so close that that
like it's just takes one little small

228
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:30,610
little mistake to fucking die.
You're talking too loud.

229
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,720
You get your mouth like right on that
thing and it gets like way elevated this,

230
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,370
they're like squirrel. Yeah. But
those things are dangerous as fuck.

231
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,253
They're really dangerous.

232
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,150
We did something with someone who was
doing shark diving thing. By the way.

233
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:45,250
I'm going to do shark dive and
Rachael Ray and a couple of weeks.

234
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,260
What are you trying to die with? Rachael
Ray show with Rachael Ray. Man, Mexico.

235
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:53,600
Two days. Let me tell you something,
and this is like, don't, nevermind.

236
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,870
Don't repeat this.
That what I was gonna say.

237
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:57,670
Just don't ever want to tweet Rachael Ray,

238
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,430
that was talking about on your podcast,
but he's very private,

239
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:02,860
but we just stayed up late,
too late, got hammered.

240
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:07,630
The trolls are in motion calls down,
set up a buffet, like just fucking,

241
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,770
I had never had more fun with someone.
Like are you in love with Rachel Ray?

242
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,670
A little. Not In love. I could if
she was a man. I have a man crush.

243
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,390
If she was a dude, she'd be your
bestie. Oh, she was my dude. Oh,

244
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:23,500
we'd be hanging out in my man cave
all the time. Wow. That's really fun.

245
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:25,390
She's a lot of fun.
She's really cool.

246
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,930
More grounded than anyone and this is the
only reason I say she's grounded is a,

247
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,890
some people ordered some wine to a
room and I've dealt with a lot of,

248
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,530
I don't know how rich he is,
but I'm assuming she's wealthy.

249
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,500
I've go around a lot of
people in sometimes when the
bill comes a and everyone

250
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,220
expects them to sign it, they just
sign it and she looked at, it was like,

251
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,880
who ordered a $350 bottle of wine?
And then they were like, she was like,

252
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:48,190
where is it? I'm going to definitely
have a glass of that. She goes,

253
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:49,780
this isn't a $350 bottle of wine.

254
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,860
There's a least at most a 70
of wine from room service.

255
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,450
Send someone up to talk to me about a 350
and I was like, whoa. I was like, man,

256
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:01,240
she's a real motherfucker.
That Shit my wife does.

257
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,450
So somebody tried to
fuck her over someone.

258
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,480
They sent extra shit up to her room and
she was like, this isn't a $350 yeah,

259
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:12,100
not at all. I never took him
off. Was this fucking Mexico?

260
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,180
Oh, in Mexico they got crafty.
San Miguel de Allende dude.

261
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,040
What is it like traveling through fucking
Mexico right now? Oh, I'll tell you,

262
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,960
cause I had a fucking security detail.

263
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,970
What's fucking Edgar meets me piece on
his back, right? Old School, Mexican.

264
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,660
Just sit to the airport at Walcott and
goes, Mr Crutcher. And I was like, yeah.

265
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:35,590
And he goes, let's go. And he,
that dude followed me everywhere.

266
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,980
I went to the bar to drink by
myself. He sat and watched. Really,

267
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,700
he slept outside of my room like let us
outside my room cause he was just like,

268
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,280
it's, it's, you know, it's also
Rachel's production in there.

269
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,660
They're not going to cut
corners on safety, you know,

270
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,790
and what the fuck kind of feeling
is that I got a picture of him.

271
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,163
I'm sure I tweeted it,

272
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,130
but fucking real dude followed me
everywhere to the point that when we went,

273
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,710
I had to go back to their board is
like an hour drive hour drives a little

274
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:04,100
sketchy in Mexico and we drove
back. He drove with me. I check in,

275
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,810
I checked my bag in and I go,
all right,

276
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:09,170
a Greg him like a hundred bucks cause
he never left my side. I go, thank you.

277
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:13,850
Grazia is, he spoke no English and he
goes, um, he goes, no, no, no. A key,

278
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,790
a key and went no, no, no. I'm
just checking in now. He goes, Aki,

279
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,690
Aki until [inaudible] or
what? Our airplane, whatever,

280
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:23,480
until you get on the airplane,
I'm not leaving. So he waited,

281
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,750
watch me go through security and then
sat there in case I had a problem.

282
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,180
I was fucking awesome.
And Rachel had one too,

283
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:30,830
but his was much earlier
and much better looking.

284
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,510
Herzer better looking guy
was a fucking stored. Yeah.

285
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:37,220
Like I'd like to get uncomfortable
around. No, she had hit,

286
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:40,340
she hit him and she had this black dude
too who is from America that she brought

287
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:43,090
just extra Eddie. Do you
think they tag team? No,

288
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,690
but I so badly wanted to
get drunk with her and go,

289
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:49,160
let's make our security details bite
like a fuel and make them fight and let's

290
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:52,490
just go to a room and then I'd make
them fight and I fight out in the out.

291
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,260
Teach them to teach us how to pistol whip
somebody want something fun in Mexico?

292
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,143
Yeah,
Dude.

293
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,010
So will you terrified we ever able
to relax? No, it was totally tear.

294
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:06,980
I was totally relaxed and I was
totally not terrified at all. Yeah.

295
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:10,790
Because although even though you
have all the security everywhere,

296
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,880
the second you have a security guy,
you get brave and you're like,

297
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,140
I can do whatever the fuck I want.

298
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,160
Really know there's like egg or where
do we get some tee shirts? He goes, AH,

299
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:23,210
north side, north side here, a key. So
we just stayed at this bar and drank.

300
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:26,660
He just watched me drank the whole
fucking night and I sent and then it kept

301
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:30,440
mixing up Kiddos and tns. So like I
would want to see, I wanted to say,

302
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,140
do you want a cigar?
But instead I just looked at him like,

303
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:37,810
do you have a fucking cigar? And
he was like, no, no, no sample.

304
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,830
But who's awesome. It was really
cool. That's a big mistake. Yeah.

305
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,790
It turns you from a nice guy
too. A douchebag. Yeah. And then,

306
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,010
but I realized at the end of the
night when I said it again and I said,

307
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:51,590
do you want to go to bed with me? And then
I said, you have to go to bed with me.

308
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,190
It's a joke. I missed that joke. I'm not

309
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,620
good on Mexican material.

310
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,380
Did you see anything fucked up
while you were there at all? Any,

311
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,200
any gun fire shit?

312
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:12,280
Any cars pulled over the side of the
road with tanks or anything crazy? No,

313
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,500
it was pretty,
it was a really fucking laid back.

314
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,900
They say if you're in parts of Mexico,
it's like really safe.

315
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,530
It's border to border town
and it's just fucking,

316
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,280
but being an ignorant American, I just
assumed that the whole country is fucked.

317
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,920
It's like meanwhile,
if you came to America and you,

318
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,550
if you were an alien and you
landed in Detroit at a nowhere,

319
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,700
this is the first place she landed
a straight shot from Alpha Centauri,

320
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,610
right to Detroit. You would be convinced
that the Holocaust has already happened.

321
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,020
There's bears roaming the streets
of Detroit. They've had bears.

322
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:48,100
They'd take photos of bears in residential
neighborhoods because no one lives

323
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,480
there anymore and it's just the
craziest fucking city of all time.

324
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,660
50% can't read be literacy or,
yeah.

325
00:17:56,661 --> 00:18:00,830
The literacy rate in Detroit
is 47% that was what it,

326
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:06,310
you can have the two top most dangerous
cities in it to both of them are the two

327
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:09,130
top ones. Flint is flow.
I can't remember this.

328
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,450
One of the arguments is it so is
Alaska and I think that's just what the

329
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:15,030
population,
you know the ratio of the population,

330
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,800
the percentage of people
that get murdered.

331
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,380
When I heard this is going to sound
racist, but I'll say it anyway.

332
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,090
I heard that the reason the Alaska so
dangerous is that why people up there?

333
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,930
No Eskimos a slur by the way up
there. Did you know that? Yeah.

334
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:32,400
Someone just told me that I'm supposed
to say it and you Eskimos like calling it

335
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:36,270
black eye on nigger. Hey,
that's what it's like.

336
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,520
That's what caught me off guard. I was
like, no, no, that's exactly what it is.

337
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,490
Or now how ridiculous is that? I didn't
know cause I'm calling everyone Eskimos.

338
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,910
Oh Shit.
Walking around like a

339
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,770
time machine and jumped ahead of time
from the 50s into the 2000. I was like,

340
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,590
one of the side effects
from Alpha brand new.

341
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:57,030
Both learn that that at the same time,

342
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:02,260
goddamn orientals coming from this guy.
He said orientals once and someone said,

343
00:19:02,261 --> 00:19:05,020
hey man, that's a slur. And I go, Whoa,

344
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:08,740
how could oriental be a slur?
It's from the Orient.

345
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,750
Yeah. You didn't know that. That's
a big, that's a huge flag. Oh,

346
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,350
orientals and object. Yeah. Yeah.

347
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,910
But the orient is a place.

348
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,360
So being oriental, oriental
person that used to be acceptable.

349
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,570
Yeah. When you could purchase people
to run that make your railroads. Oh

350
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,740
yeah. I think they were like, we
bought all these orientals. Yeah.

351
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,910
We brought them over here. I never
thought these other oriental objects,

352
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,710
like this rug and this hash pipe.

353
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,180
Wow. I never thought of it that way. Wow.

354
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,110
I always thought of it as just being
a designation or, or, or, uh, a,

355
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,510
a past where you're from. You know, what
part of the world, like being a European,

356
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:56,650
I always thought it was, you
know, or being a westerner.
Yeah, being an oriental,

357
00:19:56,651 --> 00:19:59,380
I really didn't think that
it was an offensive term.

358
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,120
In Canada. They call Indians what
we would call native Americans.

359
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:07,600
They just call them natives and I was
like, that sounds fucking aggressive.

360
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,110
That's so aggressive on
these fucking natives.

361
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,900
There's water.

362
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,600
The idea is crazy really,

363
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:19,260
that human beings have only been on
this continent for a couple of thousand

364
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,950
years now and over the last
couple hundred, I mean,

365
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:27,090
could you imagine taking a look in any
other part of the world and take a look

366
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:30,770
at it from 500 years ago,
600 years ago, and you know,

367
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,230
there'd still be people
there 600 years ago here.

368
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,360
Fucking no horses, man.
There was no witnesses. Yeah.

369
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,990
American Indians didn't have horses.

370
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,530
They didn't get the horses until the
Europeans came over here. They do.

371
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:48,310
They were so, they were complete
nomads. They were running down deer.

372
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,070
They would do what's
called persistence hunting,

373
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,600
where they would run down dear until the
deer died of exhaustion and they were

374
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:58,920
most of the time too tired to even eat.
And so the,

375
00:20:58,921 --> 00:21:02,740
the whole village would eat mean.
It'd be like close to death.

376
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,020
They would be close to death to
kill a steer. Are you shitting out?

377
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,190
Was of a common way of hunting back then
and then they found the horse when the

378
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:10,290
Europeans came here.
That was easy.

379
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,540
That was the problem with
when the Europeans came here,

380
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,920
the people who are living here at
the time because of their, their,

381
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:21,130
their folk lore and you know,
I believe it's the ancients,

382
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,720
they thought that the people on horses
were gods. They thought this is,

383
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:28,750
this is a god,
like someone riding an animal.

384
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,520
Like they had never seen that before ever.

385
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,430
It is bizarre because you and Collin,
this is a fucking,

386
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,290
now I'm doing a podcast
fan of [inaudible],

387
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,810
but you and Kat Callan had talked about
that one time and I have been obsessed

388
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:43,730
with the concepts that we can,

389
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,060
we have dominion over these fucking
animals that are so much bigger than us.

390
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,601
It would,

391
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:51,710
you would think if you're a fucking
native American Indian and you see this

392
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,910
Spaniard with the mustache
and the steel hat,

393
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:58,410
it goes up like this carrying buckets
of gold on a stallion. Just, yeah,

394
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,960
it's impressive.

395
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,211
Well,

396
00:22:00,211 --> 00:22:04,530
what's going on is that the whole rest
of the world was doing agriculture but in

397
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:09,210
hunt in, but in North America, people were
hunting and gathering. You know, it was,

398
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:12,900
it was a completely different group of
humans who was all the people that came

399
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:16,710
down from the Bering Strait from Siberia.
That's where the humans were,

400
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:18,630
that that's all the American Indians.
You know,

401
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:22,290
they figured that out because some guy
was convinced that the Mormon books were

402
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:27,180
true and that Joseph Smith had told the
truth and Joseph Smith had said that

403
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,390
the,

404
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,980
what the American Indians were with the
last lost tribe of Jesus and that they

405
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:36,570
had come to America with the last words
of Jesus and were written on these

406
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:38,730
golden scrolls and only he
can read them all the shed.

407
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,410
And so this guy in trying to prove that
it was true actually did like a DNA test

408
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,740
on native Americans and
found out that they're Asian,

409
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:51,080
that they come from Siberia,
come from the connection or

410
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,450
weight. Imagine I would love to
foster those people just walked man.

411
00:22:57,451 --> 00:23:00,900
And they say they have the same culture
for thousands of years because when they

412
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:01,734
got here,

413
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,990
there was no civilization here before
because the entire fucking continent was

414
00:23:06,991 --> 00:23:11,140
covered in ice. We don't even, we can't
even wrap our head around that. Like for,

415
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,120
for thousands and thousands of years,
there was nothing here.

416
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,250
There was just melted ice and
a few fucking weird, you know,

417
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,520
annual type people wandering around
killing things of bows and arrows,

418
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,350
putting nuts, man, I, you
said something that I,

419
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:33,520
that I'm going to, hopefully
this will make sense, but,

420
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,800
so the Indians did not know how to
bring the corn closer to their house.

421
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,690
They just were like, well,
the corner over there.

422
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,620
Well, I don't know about that. I don't
know. They probably know Agora. Well,

423
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:48,430
and you know, and when they first came
down there certainly wasn't, but I, it's,

424
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,380
I dunno whether or not Indians
established their own agriculture.

425
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,160
Nobody than they supposedly, oh, no,
no, no. It was, it was the tobacco it,

426
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,530
but it was the idea that the Americans
or the rather the original settlers

427
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,730
taught the American Indians, the native
Americans had to plant their corn.

428
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:05,564
Wasn't that,

429
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,590
I wouldn't think so. I think we
could have known and here's why.

430
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:13,260
Here's the only reason I agree or I hear
that and I go, who should fucking know?

431
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,300
That's something we should know.
Like Charlie Brown probably taught us that

432
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:25,290
politician guy when I was a
while ago and he was very racist,

433
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:27,190
older,
um,

434
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:31,910
like from the south and he
was slamming like fucking, uh,

435
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,080
the people of that,
the,

436
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,070
the native people of South America.
He was like,

437
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:43,150
these motherfuckers couldn't even
use a wheel and it cause apparently.

438
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,150
Yeah. And I was like, whoa.
And I was like, shut up.

439
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,370
And I just thought he was just being
racist. It was fun to listen to.

440
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,260
But apparently it was true when
the Spaniards came over there,

441
00:24:50,261 --> 00:24:54,520
like that toy you give your children
will use it to move fucking hall shit.

442
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,390
I was like,
fuck.

443
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,830
Well,
you know what's even more incredible,

444
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,810
what this was all post when they had
built those pyramids. So all this,

445
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,640
you know,
that's thousands of years ago.

446
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,810
So they built the pyramids and use
the fucking wheel. Well, we don't,

447
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,840
we don't have a goddamn clue as how they
built Cheech needs a or any of those

448
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:17,560
places. But they built them
essentially without any horses
that, without, you know,

449
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:20,320
and then,
but I didn't even machines and these,

450
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,580
these fucking people built these
incredible stone structures in the jungle.

451
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,010
You know,
I don't know how the fuck they did it.

452
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,780
The obviously did figure out how to do it.

453
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,240
That's a fucking reality show. It's
amazing. Can you make a pyramid

454
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,710
now using horses? No. Horses
the loud. If you wait,

455
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,440
if we catch you bringing in a horse on
the plane, you're, you're off the show.

456
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,650
Yeah. You, uh, listen

457
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,070
to the podcast that we have with Graham
Hancock. Did you listen to that one? Yeah,

458
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,390
the, he's on the money. I think he's dead
on their money. I think that there was a,

459
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,090
there was a whole other
advanced civilization a long
time ago and they got wiped

460
00:25:54,091 --> 00:25:57,130
to fuck out. Well, after you're talking
about aliens, well he didn't, he,

461
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,570
I don't think he had a really specific,
yeah,

462
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:01,590
nobody that night right after I
saw that I saw a thing on, um, on,

463
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,100
he was on history channel about 80 yards.
Yeah.

464
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,050
And they were talking about how the, how
the fucking aliens, it's all the aliens.

465
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:11,690
And I was like, and then I think I
mixed the two and then I make that up.

466
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,740
Um, and the, uh, the guy
with a British accent,

467
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,360
Giorgio sucralose. Who Guy who was a, no,

468
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:22,300
Graham Hancock has a guy with a
British accent. Giorgio sucralose is,

469
00:26:22,301 --> 00:26:26,880
the guy was from ancient aliens. We had
him on the podcast too. Gray Heron. Yeah.

470
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,540
He's an interesting cat.
He believes everything is alien.

471
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,640
It's how long until you're
tired of talking to people?

472
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,520
I don't,
I don't have a problem with it,

473
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,940
but when are you going to tap out and be
like, I think I've talked to everyone.

474
00:26:36,941 --> 00:26:40,840
I want to talk to him. Well, nothing.
Never because I'm talking to you again.

475
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,010
You know, it's like I think all
I know I get two more visits and

476
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,240
you're gonna be like, dude, Dunkin says
that every time it comes over, man.

477
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:51,720
I don't know if family thing
you talked about, man, go,
don't worry about it, dude.

478
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:54,900
Let's just fucking riff.
Come on. It's taught you,

479
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:58,140
you're always going to have a look.
You're not going to stop thinking, man.

480
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:01,110
You're not going to stop. You're
not going to stop experiencing life.

481
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,270
You're not going to
stop having revelations.

482
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:04,500
You're not going to stop having stories.

483
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,453
You know?
It's crazy.

484
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,740
You've had training in doing podcasts
before we even did started this podcast

485
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,220
because I don't know how many times,
like after a show or something,

486
00:27:13,221 --> 00:27:14,210
we would all go eat.

487
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,690
It's always going to go eat with like
everybody that were hanging around with

488
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:22,040
and we would sit there for hours
and did the same thing as a podcast.

489
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,710
But without fucking recording.
Yeah.

490
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:24,983
Oh Dude.

491
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:29,540
We had some classic conversations with
you and me and Eddie Bravo and you know

492
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,440
every comedian are Rhea,
Joey [inaudible].

493
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,580
And let me tell you the best
thing about this podcast is,

494
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,010
is what I'm waiting for a fucking
Falcon. The land on your arm, dude.

495
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,220
By the way, if you want to make your own
Falcon risk thing just used pineapple.

496
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,120
I had been making Falcon Risks
Cause we've been juicing and

497
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,120
we just got a juicer. Say,
well you were going to say,

498
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,080
we're going to say I fucking got
obsessed with Eddie Bravo one night.

499
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,810
Really just obsessed.
It's like the window.

500
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,270
You guys were talking about him making,

501
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,480
creating a move and then some guy
moot use that move for the first time.

502
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,720
That was when a guy caught the
first twister in the UFC. Right.

503
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,980
And then I'll really create the move.

504
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:07,880
He just invented a whole lot of setups
for it and became a master at it and

505
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:09,140
really good at teaching it.
Right.

506
00:28:09,141 --> 00:28:12,180
And then I started following them on
Twitter and then I was like, Eh, I do.

507
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:16,170
He just is so much more diversity
human being. Then anyway,

508
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,890
I start researching them and I'm like,
well he's got 10th planet.

509
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:21,530
He does his own Jujitsu. He teaches
Jujitsu, he's written books about it.

510
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,510
He's in a band. He's, I go out,

511
00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:26,180
he seems a lot more diverse than
the majority of people out there.

512
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:29,180
So then I just started reading all his
Wikipedia, watching all these videos,

513
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:32,930
and then I'm like, okay, this is getting
borderline gay. I go, there's no way,

514
00:28:32,931 --> 00:28:36,140
any problems watching my shit.
He's an interesting dude.

515
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,530
I never met a guy like Eddie Bravo.
Fascinating guy.

516
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,710
He's the guy who got me to smoke weed.
That's what I was like. I was like,

517
00:28:42,711 --> 00:28:46,300
how did that
Doug Benson smoked,

518
00:28:46,301 --> 00:28:50,840
didn't smoke weed until he was like 30
also, look man, if you, if you don't know,

519
00:28:50,841 --> 00:28:53,420
and one of the reasons why a
lot of people don't like pot,

520
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,770
it's cause they're not smoking pot.

521
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,570
You know one of the reasons why they're
worried about other people doing it

522
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,930
because they're scared they're going to
like it themselves and they're scared

523
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:02,570
about doing it. It's like the same thing
about doing scare them up being a loser.

524
00:29:02,571 --> 00:29:05,270
That's what you're scared about.
You not scared. I'm telling you,

525
00:29:05,271 --> 00:29:06,890
it's not going to make
you a goddamn loser.

526
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:11,540
I thought it did and a lot of you do too.
It's a trick. Had been fooled. It's a,

527
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,700
it's a very fabulous tool for the mind

528
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,980
and in 45 days we are all going to get
rid of our local pot shops because Obama

529
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:23,270
is destroying us all and we're all going
to die. Are you shitting me? Yeah, they,

530
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,470
he phrases

531
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:29,470
it so eloquently like a gay woman
because of I was destroying us.

532
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,060
A woman, a gay woman. That's a gay man.

533
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,670
Hands flap out like slipper drawing
us all and we're all gonna die.

534
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,040
Now you said that you couldn't have
said that gay anti Gracie. That was such

535
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,580
a way that, yeah. Did you hear
Nancy Grace Park it on the air

536
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,440
since she was on Tmz.

537
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:53,320
We'll look fat people for the last seen
her nipple and she farted in a month.

538
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:57,430
Whatever you're doing Nancy Grace and
now I'm on your team. I want to see more.

539
00:29:57,431 --> 00:30:01,300
I want to see your ass hole. I want to
see fucking everything. Nancy Grace Porn.

540
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,940
Who Do you want to see
your fuck? No, no, no.

541
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,650
The guy from the Michael Jackson trial,
the doctor. I want to see him back up.

542
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,510
Those two days. That'd be off.
She wants the forbidden fruit.

543
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,200
You big fucking the African American.
Definitely.

544
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,780
It's important guys. She's going
to do four guys. Well, the first,

545
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:27,030
first one, she's just got to
do one guy up. Just one. One
more group brother. What?

546
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,620
Hardcore gangster dude
with tattoos on his face.

547
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,840
And then I'd love to see Fox
morning run a train on her.

548
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,160
Just fucking with this other chick.

549
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,450
Fox morning news through
Hank Williams under the bus.

550
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,510
I went Dallas rain or rain on her back.
You know what I'm talking about?

551
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,800
It Neil, a local guy, local weatherman,

552
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,020
but his name's Dallas rain
and he's a weatherman.

553
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,160
Well that's better than Brent
coming. He's the guy who got who? Uh,

554
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,010

naked in a bathtub with no water. Okay.

555
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,320
Frame was Cummings.

556
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,260
They found a dead guy next to him and
you don't know this and it was another

557
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:00,910
fucking weather guy.
Fred Rogan did it.

558
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,380
Weather guy in Arkansas
or no. Uh, Oklahoma,

559
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,180
I think one of those either Arkansas,

560
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:11,070
Oklahoma and he was one of these guys
with the crazy fake whether voice,

561
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,820
we've got a high pressure system coming
in for the east. Those guys that,

562
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,690
you know how like some radio Djs do the
same thing that was put on this fucking

563
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:21,870
fake voice. You're like, who are
you? Because when I'm on the air,

564
00:31:21,871 --> 00:31:25,650
we're on the air and we're back
rolling.

565
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:30,651
So tell me Bert Kreischer standup comic
since 1,999 what got your started?

566
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:38,010
Wait, let's get back to you pat.
They, who's they? And was he asleep?

567
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,020
Did he not know?
There's a big guy next to him.

568
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,233
He,
they,

569
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,740
he was at a guy's house and they were
all partying and snort and drugs.

570
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,640
This is the store.

571
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,390
And the dude wakes up in the middle
of the night cause he hears snoring.

572
00:31:50,391 --> 00:31:54,260
Just ridiculous. Snoring goes
downstairs, opens up the bathroom.

573
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:59,410
There's a dead guy in the bathtub
with a dog collar on next to a snoring

574
00:32:00,021 --> 00:32:04,190
weatherman and they're both naked
and there's no water in the bathtub.

575
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,340
It's awesome.

576
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,930
You got to know that somewhere out there
there's someone that's fucking up way

577
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,200
harder than you.
It's a prospective enhancing the water.

578
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:19,650
Just all emptied into their assholes.
I don't know. No, probably not.

579
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,100
We were the first words out of your mouth.
You're woken up.

580
00:32:23,101 --> 00:32:25,470
There's a dead guy with a dog collar
on you and you're in a bathtub.

581
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,190
First words out of your mouth.
She don't wake him up.

582
00:32:28,191 --> 00:32:32,610
He sounded does face was purple. Oh,
okay. He's totally dead. He was dead.

583
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,820
He was 68

584
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,990
probably choked on his own vomit. And who
knows? Overdosed when. Oh, so what's your,

585
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,010
you don't

586
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,900
say anything? You can see I give somebody
that's not a fucking party. Get Out.

587
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:49,020
Fucking shake it off. That's
how you know. Nobody could ever

588
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,430
say shit to that dude.
I mean,

589
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:54,240
I know you're the king of partying you
so much so that they made that van wilder

590
00:32:54,241 --> 00:32:56,820
movie that movie's based on
you and this is a true story.

591
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:59,640
A lot of people don't know
this sounds like horse shit,

592
00:32:59,641 --> 00:33:03,780
but they made a fucking movie based
on you being such a party animal.

593
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,540
But you can't fuck with that guy.
If he wants to talk.

594
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,870
I saw who parties hardy bitch.
I party so hard with people.

595
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:14,010
They die sometimes naked.
They're in a bad dog or that dog collar.

596
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,010
That's how you know you're partying hard,
dude.

597
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:20,760
You're partnering with winds up
naked with a dog collar on dead.

598
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,470
You know how hard it would
be to get people out for
drinks and mean that homeboy,

599
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:30,230
I just fell asleep. It
didn't even bother him. He,

600
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:35,150
you know this is fucking dead and he's
snoring so loud.

601
00:33:35,151 --> 00:33:38,660
He wakes to flog it dude up.
They wake him up and he's like,

602
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,600
can you imagine your store? Who the fuck
is snoring? Man, it's fucking party.

603
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,480
Been over for two hours.
Who's in my house got damaged?

604
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,850
You come wandering downstairs and
that's what you find dead guy with a dog

605
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:52,684
collar on.

606
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:57,180
Fucking well let me out and wonder
what they're snorting credible.

607
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:01,510
The anticodons Oxycontin's apparently
are all the rage. That's what a,

608
00:34:01,511 --> 00:34:04,570
they're having a real real problem
with with kids. I did it recently.

609
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:05,763
Did you really

610
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,113
retard

611
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:14,480
cause you're going to pass out backwards.
Trying to go the other way.

612
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:19,130
I took two hits just to try it out
because she took two and it was very crack

613
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:19,964
addict.

614
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,190
You take aluminum foil and you put the
pill on top of it and you light it from

615
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:29,300
underneath so it kind of melts and then
you take a straw and you kind of do it

616
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:33,570
like you're inhaling the fumes that
it burns from chasing the dragon. Huh?

617
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,750
Chasing the dragon chasing the dragon.
They did it with heroin too.

618
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,960
Why don't you just swallow
the pill? Because I think
you can get more out of it.

619
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:45,290
Like I think it's a new smoking.
It hits you faster,

620
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:50,200
I think maybe should as you faster for
sure. Gross people who are addicted are,

621
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,930
can't even wait until the pill digests
and starts to work in your body.

622
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:58,510
You have to smoke it. It didn't,
it didn't. It fueled a little,

623
00:34:58,511 --> 00:35:00,400
but honestly it was like more like,

624
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,400
I think if I took Nyquil
it would have been better.

625
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,900
You know like or something like that.
It wasn't to me it felt gross.

626
00:35:06,901 --> 00:35:11,140
And like definitely I have a good
thing feeling when I do some drugs.

627
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:13,240
I'm just like, you know what,
that's just a stupid ass drunk.

628
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:16,250
And that was totally one of
those stupid ass dreads. Sued.

629
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:20,570
There was a crazy story that I ran across
yesterday and I put it on the rogue

630
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,940
board and uh, apparently it's
been going around for a while.

631
00:35:23,941 --> 00:35:28,140
There's a dude on vice TV and he,
uh,

632
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,620
he interviewed this chick
and she's on Youtube.

633
00:35:31,621 --> 00:35:34,620
She calls herself neuro soup. Have
you ever heard of this girl? Yeah.

634
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,060
She's the one who had a
video about putting upper

635
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,760
abs right there. Like how
long a trip went? Yeah.

636
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,820
What comedy troupe is she in?
She's not in a comedy troupe at all.

637
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,860
It's a neuro soup is her youtube video
that's on youtube name. So anyway,

638
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:54,220
this, this dude Hamilton Morris
is this, uh, the like the,

639
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:57,840
the head psychedelic guy over@vice.com.
You know,

640
00:35:57,841 --> 00:36:02,640
vice.tv or vbs.tv, the vice guide
to Liberia. You know, those,

641
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,280
those crazy travel guides, if
you ever watched those, no.

642
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,390
You are missing out on a chunk of crazy.

643
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:14,700
These guys are fucking bad ass man. Yeah,
they go everywhere. I mean Thailand,

644
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,320
Thailand and pickup lady boys and
shit. They go, they go to Liberia,

645
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:23,610
they go to Liberia and they
go to whorehouses in Liberia
where it's like dollar

646
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,880
where it's like sex is like a dollar
and there's no windows to the place.

647
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,870
They're like like oh like you know like
cement huts. Who are these guys do?

648
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:33,570
They're bad asses and this this guy,

649
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:38,571
Hamilton Morris is the psychedelic guy
and he writes a all these articles about

650
00:36:38,611 --> 00:36:42,450
psychedelic and he interviews people
and he interviewed this check and this

651
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:46,020
neuro soup girl and this neuro soup girl,
her name was crystal.

652
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:49,500
She was living with this guy.
She was a stripper,

653
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:53,520
a golf stripper in Kansas and she was
living with this guy who was like the

654
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:56,300
number one LSD and MDM,

655
00:36:56,330 --> 00:37:00,330
a dealer in the area and
this guy had a missile silo.

656
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,330
He bought a missile silo,

657
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,810
one of those and he bought like it got
into like some underground nuclear bunker

658
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:10,410
type situation. It's fucking place
was radical. It's incredible.

659
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:11,760
There's long as photos of it online.

660
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:16,970
If you're looking for good advice.com
it's Hamilton's pharmacopia getting high

661
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:21,900
on crystal. If you want to just look
for getting high on crystal, k, r, y, s,

662
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:26,340
t, l, e, look for that online and
following her on Twitter. Yeah, whatever.

663
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,800
So anyway, this girl, um, she,

664
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,390
she hooks up with this dude and she
stopped stripping and becomes this crazy

665
00:37:33,391 --> 00:37:34,440
psychedelic head.

666
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:38,280
Like she's doing everything under the
fucking sun every day of the week.

667
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:41,220
She's just one day she's doing acid.
The next day she's doing DMT.

668
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,030
And these guys had DMT hooked up to ivs.

669
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:49,870
They had it to up to ivs when they
were doing liquid DMT and they had,

670
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:54,430
they were regulating it on the ivy.
So they were surfing the DMT dimension of,

671
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:57,630
they were constantly getting it brought
in their body and who knows what the

672
00:37:57,631 --> 00:38:01,500
fuck they did to their heads. But one,
one of the guys started going crazy,

673
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,490
her boyfriend and when her boyfriend
decided that her, his partner was, uh,

674
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,340
was doing bad things or was
going to fuck them over,

675
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:11,220
it was going to get him arrested.
So he goes to the DEA.

676
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,960
These fucking guys have a
missile silo where they're,

677
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:17,430
they're dripping DMT into their
veins and homeboy did so much,

678
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:22,320
he brought himself to the DEA.
So he turns his buddy end to the DEA.

679
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,091
And then, you know, the,

680
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:26,910
the dude who's the chemist winds up doing
like two life terms or something like

681
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:30,750
that, you know, he's fucked and they give
him immunity. They give him immunity.

682
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,810
So this is how our DEA ruts
just fucking got, yeah,

683
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:38,170
this guy who was just his probably just
completely cooked. It's fucking brain.

684
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,450
So he winds up traveling for free.
I mean, he can, he's a free man.

685
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,670
He doesn't have to worry about,
he's not running from the cops.

686
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:50,290
He winds up traveling the whole country
while this is buddy is doing two life

687
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,630
terms with this girl
and all over the place.

688
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:57,631
They're just doing insane drugs at every
stop along the way until they get back

689
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:00,250
and she's trying to get away from him.

690
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:04,450
She hooks up with another dude and the
other dude is telling her like, hey,

691
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:07,240
you know, we've got to turn this guy in
like he's crazy, he's going to kill us.

692
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:11,740
So they go to the Dea and
the DEA tells the guy, hey,

693
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:13,060
you're fucking girlfriend.

694
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:17,020
And her new boyfriend just came and
visited us and they told us everything,

695
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:21,520
you fucking dummy, you better deal
with that. So this fucking crazy man.

696
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:24,220
It's crazy dealer guy that she,
you know, the original guy,

697
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:29,610
he takes them and locks them in a hotel
room and dopes then and ties this dude

698
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:34,900
up to a chair and it administers
drugs into his dick and his balls with

699
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:37,150
injections.
And he did it for a week.

700
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,280
It is the craziest story of just excess
and chaos and just a complete insanity.

701
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:51,370
Just chemical induced
complete and Saturday.

702
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,940
It's not like homeboy was probably crazy
to begin with back when he was selling

703
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:59,790
drugs out of a missile silo. But, but
at the end he was guns Ville again.

704
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,230
He was,

705
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:00,830
it was gone.

706
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:04,100
I'm sure there's going to make it
sound like I'm so lost in the story.

707
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,450
How did you hear about
this advice when a jerk,

708
00:40:08,451 --> 00:40:09,470
penis.com

709
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:15,560
I'll just let that set.
There was a message board all about about

710
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,180
inserting drugs into your penis. No. Uh,

711
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,060
somebody sends me on Twitter I think. I'm
pretty sure we're, we're, can I see this?

712
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:28,420
Like I said, it's on vice.com
is this spice Dotcom,

713
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:32,390
is this like 100% accurate like web,
like story and everything?

714
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:36,500
Cause this seems so ridiculous now.
It's all documented. It's all doctors.

715
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,240
I looked the whole thing up. It's a huge
article. If you read the article online,

716
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:44,420
it is, let me, let me go to
it. I think it's like 10 pages.

717
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,680
It's a really big and very deep.
Seven pages. A very detailed article,

718
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,770
but it all happened van. It's a pretty
famous story. Isn't it weird though,

719
00:40:51,771 --> 00:40:54,230
when you hear things like this and
you're like, nowadays you're like,

720
00:40:54,231 --> 00:40:55,370
this has to be fake.

721
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,460
Like even when John know what you're
talking about because this doesn't seem

722
00:40:58,461 --> 00:40:59,270
fake at all of them.

723
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:02,630
Tell him that fake actually somebody
kidnap somebody and the inserts fucking

724
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:07,160
drugs into their penis and
ask you to consider who
you're talking about. The Guy,

725
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:07,581
the guy,

726
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:12,560
the guy that did it is a guy that had
already turned on somebody and so he'd had

727
00:41:12,561 --> 00:41:15,050
those nights of him on drugs.
That's an awesome story.

728
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:16,700
I got fucking turned on
and I go fucking crazy.

729
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:19,130
And then they come to him and tell him
and that his wife's not only fucking some

730
00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:22,100
other dude, but he turned
them on also. I don't know.

731
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:23,300
That's not too far out of the spectrum.

732
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,790
It's just weird that like some
of these stories nowadays,

733
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,120
it just seems so far fetched and amazing.
But this isn't far fetched at all.

734
00:41:29,121 --> 00:41:32,680
This is this too to me. I know what you're
saying, but this to me seems pretty, uh,

735
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,760
pretty normal. Normal. Yeah.

736
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,290
When people start selling drugs,

737
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,730
this guy was a dealing
kilos of Crystalyn Mtma.

738
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,080
He was just traveling across the country
selling MDM and they were doing it

739
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:46,610
constantly.
Put that in perspective.

740
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,490
Probably could for someone
that's never done DMT, DMT,

741
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,820
the BMA kilos Mtma is
ecstasy. For. You don't know.

742
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,740
It's the pure stuff. And that's
what I heard. And what it is, is a,

743
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:02,000
you know what it is? It's incredible.
It feels awesome, but God damn,

744
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:05,660
it takes a toll on your brain. Woo.
The next day. I've never felt dumb,

745
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,780
and I've heard that if you get really
good stuff, it doesn't do that.

746
00:42:08,781 --> 00:42:12,200
But I call horse shit. It does it.
There's a guy in college who, uh,

747
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,710
who used to do a lot of ecstasy.
I wish I could remember this kid's name.

748
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:18,110
Everyone that went to college with me,
I'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

749
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,960
Little short hair with blonde hair.
It looked like a surfer.

750
00:42:19,961 --> 00:42:24,050
I look like mark Ahca Lupo the surfer,
and then towards the end of college,

751
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:26,160
like he used to have the
saying for cigarettes borrowed.

752
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:30,440
Bariums bariums he called
cigarettes. Baron. Nerium. Yeah.

753
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:33,700
But then we just realized he was so
fucked up that he was trying to say Hemi.

754
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,560
There was like a French cigarette,
but it was, that was what he smoked.

755
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:40,310
But he just came out of
his mouth. [inaudible] I
started going on him and man,

756
00:42:40,311 --> 00:42:42,020
I died to see what that
kid looks like now.

757
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:46,700
People that were really fucked up and go
on Facebook to ecstasy really has taken

758
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:47,930
a lot of people's brains.

759
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,730
I've met many people that I know do a lot
of ecstasy and they wind up completely

760
00:42:52,731 --> 00:42:55,820
fallen apart. It's so bad for you. I mean,

761
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,930
I would venture to say that
as a father of two I will,

762
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,110
I will make the cover off statement and
my children, all drugs are bad for you.

763
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:06,860
Don't do any of them because it would
be nice to get to a Dane Cook place in

764
00:43:06,861 --> 00:43:08,840
life where you've never
done fucking anything.

765
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:11,850
What are you even talking
about it like no, no,

766
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,510
but I mean just to be like to be
just sitting in bed and going on.

767
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:18,450
I don't have to worry about
fucking inhaling fucking
glade as a child and wonder

768
00:43:18,451 --> 00:43:23,100
what that did to my lungs or, or you
know, like cocaine or acid or ecstasy.

769
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,730
Like when I'm having a panic attack in
the middle of the night and I'm like,

770
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:28,010
great, I did this to myself.
Sometimes I feel that way. I go,

771
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:31,010
if I had never done anything with any
of this shit, be around, you know,

772
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,380
I would love to tell me to tell my
kids that, you know, be healthy.

773
00:43:33,381 --> 00:43:35,780
I'm sure you tell your kids the same
thing. Yeah. And most certainly,

774
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:40,781
but I just want to be real clear with
them about what is legal and or rather

775
00:43:40,881 --> 00:43:44,480
what is dangerous and what is not
and what simply illegal, right?

776
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,450
There's some reasons why things are
illegal that don't make any sense at all.

777
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:48,860
And it's a good lesson.

778
00:43:48,861 --> 00:43:52,790
It's a good lesson that the world is
not structured correctly and you have to

779
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:56,690
know that and always mind your p's and
q's and everything is not as it seems to

780
00:43:56,691 --> 00:43:58,550
be because there's a whole,

781
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,630
the system that we're operating under is
fucking crazy. It's ridiculously flawed.

782
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,210
And so I would make sure that
before I got into anything, I would,

783
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:10,100
I would let them know that.
So don't always believe what you hear.

784
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,880
And then here's what's dangerous. Here's
what's addictive. Here's what's what's,

785
00:44:13,881 --> 00:44:16,830
you know, what's going to get
you locked up in jail? You know,

786
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,820
here's what's actually legal. Here's,
you know, here's what's, you know,

787
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,440
legal and safe. Here's what's legal and
not so safe. You know? And by the way,

788
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,580
don't do anything by
yourself. Make sure, you know,

789
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:26,690
you know what the fuck you're doing.

790
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:29,900
Do it with people that you trust and
only hang around people that you trust.

791
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,070
You know, I thought, I find that people

792
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,530
that hang around with people
that they don't trust,

793
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:36,450
and it's really because they didn't have
good relationships with their parents.

794
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:37,290
You know,
I,

795
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:42,360
I'm going to try to have the best possible
relationship as a friend with my kids

796
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:45,330
as possible so that they'd
never feel like they can talk.

797
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,720
They can't talk to me about something and
I want to talk to him about every step

798
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:50,520
along the way of their life,
you know?

799
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,220
And I think that's what
you're supposed to do. Yeah.

800
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,870
The idea of drug scare the shit out of me,
man.

801
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,970
The idea of math or something like that,

802
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,430
but it was hot. I'm scared about
like Oxycontin, meth, coke, coke.

803
00:45:01,431 --> 00:45:04,280
I don't want my daughters to get around
that wall that stops the mushrooms even

804
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,310
need like I've had,
I've had friends,

805
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,400
I'm sure I've said this a million times,
but I've,

806
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:13,280
I've done mushrooms and I've always had
great experiences except at night when I

807
00:45:13,281 --> 00:45:16,880
see the shadow people. But I've
never, like I, I would probably,

808
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:20,780
we'll do them again as an adult because
I think I've done all the exploring.

809
00:45:20,781 --> 00:45:22,170
I want to do,
like I,

810
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,220
I tried to do them one one night
we were doing at Jamison tour,

811
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,500
there's a meet a bunch of comics and um,

812
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:33,140
we admonish mushrooms and I think we each
took like a couple of caps and then I

813
00:45:33,141 --> 00:45:36,740
went on stage, I think I told you this
and then I fucking lost my shit on stage.

814
00:45:36,741 --> 00:45:41,090
But then I started freaking her on
mushrooms onstage at the Dallas Improv and

815
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,950
all I could see as the candles in
the back on. And I'm like, Oh fuck.

816
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,710
And then I started thinking
I can't get off the grid.

817
00:45:48,711 --> 00:45:53,150
Like I am responsible for people
right now. Like, I am the fucking,

818
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,390
and I'm not the kind of brain that can
just dip into it and dip out of it.

819
00:45:56,391 --> 00:45:59,450
Like I'm responsible for humans.
Like what if I fucked up?

820
00:45:59,451 --> 00:46:02,660
What if I fucked up tonight?
And then I just was, I was cool.

821
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:05,480
I fucking turned it around and it
was fine and had a great night.

822
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:09,350
But that's not the horror story,
but that's a real moment.

823
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,000
You know that that thought
as a father that's,

824
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:13,740
so that's where things get really strange.
You know,

825
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,430
you think of these little helpless
children that they're looking out for you.

826
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,140
Then again,

827
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:23,140
you need the only one is not for me to
see have a fun party night at a piano bar

828
00:46:23,151 --> 00:46:27,240
or somewhere in Dallas, but to,
for me to like just read me a book.

829
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,070
That's all we want. You know,
and you just, and then that,

830
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:30,660
then that grounds you and you're like,
all right,

831
00:46:30,661 --> 00:46:33,050
that's where I'm at right now in life.
I just need to get through tonight,

832
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:38,100
drink myself out of this and fucking get
to the other side myself out of this.

833
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,230
I've done that so many times to move.

834
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,060
I'll do that and amp system and a couple
of weeks. Drink yourself in a dark,

835
00:46:43,061 --> 00:46:47,480
dense drink. Fucking yet black yourself
out. Fucking worse than it is on the stone

836
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,880
now how much do you say,
what would you,

837
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:54,780
what would you say your percentage of
alcohol intake is versus marijuana intake

838
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,100
gap way, way, way more. We'd like give
me a percentage. You drink every day? No.

839
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,490
Like we're at dinner. Do you have
like a glass of wine or anything?

840
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:07,280
I sometimes do, but not every
day. No. I find myself not, not,

841
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:10,420
I've been drinking a lot more
lately, but it's been like, no,

842
00:47:10,421 --> 00:47:13,990
I'll have wine with dinner
or I'll have like a drink,

843
00:47:13,991 --> 00:47:16,600
but not drinking all night long.
Right, right, right, right.

844
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:18,730
Well that's certainly not good for you.
But they've,

845
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,760
they've done studies that have said,
you know, whether or not this is true,

846
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,631
they've said that,
you know,

847
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,940
having a couple glasses of wine
a day is actually good for you.

848
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:28,480
Yeah. Yeah. I've heard to drink a beer
every day or drink a glass of whiskey.

849
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:29,650
Really for Ya.

850
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,930
You know what it would do for you as far
as relaxing you and I think, you know,

851
00:47:33,931 --> 00:47:35,710
it's good.
It's good to enjoy your time.

852
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:39,550
It's obviously not good to take a poison
into your body, but if that poison,

853
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:42,070
that alcohol poison, you know,
if it's easily processed,

854
00:47:42,071 --> 00:47:43,630
which alcohol basically is,
you know,

855
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:46,780
especially like one beer for the
average liver, it's no big deal.

856
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:52,480
You too. I want to look at
both. You just accidental.

857
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,200
It's not much work for it,
you know?

858
00:47:54,201 --> 00:47:56,650
And so it's a one beer can
be processed pretty easily,

859
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,390
but when you start getting into high,

860
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:01,800
high numbers and then it gets
toxic and then you're, you know,

861
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,540
and then you're dealing with, you know,
all, you're poisoning your fucking body.

862
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:08,170
When you wake up from a hangover,
it's, that's not an accident.

863
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,420
You, you're, you're, you're
hurt. Sometimes you're like,

864
00:48:12,421 --> 00:48:14,550
I didn't mean for that to happen.
You hurt yourself

865
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:17,700
for the booze, but you can have
a little, not, not do that.

866
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:18,840
That doesn't have to happen.

867
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,170
Just gotta to know what the fuck you're
limits are man. Drink a lot of water too.

868
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,790
That's the, someone told me
they were like, you should
put ice in your beer. I do.

869
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:30,610
You used to do at beer, water, beer, water
or drink, water, drink, water, drink.

870
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,400
Like that was what I had to
do when they go out. You know,

871
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:37,000
I respect the fuck out of someone who
can hold their booze. Oh, thank you.

872
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,310
I can hold my to hold your booze.
I get,

873
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,140
when we calculated the
last time you were here,

874
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,740
you drink nine beers over the course
of two hours. Those are nothing.

875
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:51,340
Here's the problem. Here's
where it gets tricky is, um,

876
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:56,500
I also, you can't ever tell if I'm drunk.
I'm like, no one can tell if I'm drunk.

877
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:00,700
Like maybe you can. That's great.
But like Mike Mow, my wife, perfect.

878
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:02,560
We'll be in the middle of a fight and
all of sudden she'd be like, hold on.

879
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,500
Are you fucking drunk? And I'd
be like, yeah. So I'd be like,

880
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:07,960
you've been fucking drunk. Does, does
it? No, you don't mean any of this.

881
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:11,850
And I'm like, well, you're still
real retribution, whatever for,

882
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,560
I think it just confuses people
when they look at you. They're just,

883
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:16,900
they just see beards and stuff,
so they don't think you're drunk,

884
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,090
but look at you with what does
that lesbian dealing with a beard.

885
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,020
That's the confusing part. That's a
little late. On the flip side though,

886
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:26,530
people also think I'm drunk when I'm
not. Oh right. Like what? Like when I'm,

887
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:28,390
when I'm on state,
whenever I'm on stage I'll,

888
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,010
if I'll bring up your on stage of me,
you know,

889
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:33,210
and I'll be like first beer of the night
and everyone's like, whatever. Right.

890
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:35,440
I was like, no, I'm okay. I guess.

891
00:49:35,441 --> 00:49:38,530
I guess maybe it's just being fat and
they're like, he's been wrong. Hold on.

892
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:42,130
Well they think you're just telling a joke
to, you know, instead of a declaration,

893
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:45,200
which isn't funny. If you had had
30 already, then it would be Kinda,

894
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:50,200
Kinda cute pair of the night.
Yeah. I never come off drunk,

895
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,850
but people always think I'm high
always and whatnot. Yeah. Yeah.

896
00:49:54,851 --> 00:49:59,670
Like UFC, he's like, dude, Rogan's blues
tonight. No, never, never do the FCI.

897
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:03,070
How was the UFC and a huge,
crazy fucking awesome.

898
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:08,080
What's serious fights man, Frankie Edgar
and gray Maynard. Did you see it now?

899
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,340
No, but I tweeted that you said it
was going to be fucking sick. Who

900
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,080
was the nuttiest rematch ever?

901
00:50:13,081 --> 00:50:16,290
The first fight that gray Maynard
won the first fight by decision,

902
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:20,310
but the second fight was a draw and it
was a crazy draw because gray Maynard had

903
00:50:20,311 --> 00:50:24,570
Frankie Edgar badly, badly hurt in the
first round and grain Mainers. A big guy.

904
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:27,980
Frankie Edgar is one of the rare
guys that fights his weight class.

905
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:30,800
So he is 155 pounds. That's
really what he weighs. Yeah,

906
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:33,350
and he's fighting gray Maynard
who's a really fit guy.

907
00:50:33,351 --> 00:50:36,530
He probably is 20 pounds heavier
than that and diets down, you know,

908
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:40,180
cuts his weight and cuts his water
weight and everybody's like, like yield.

909
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,480
He's sweet,
he's way bigger.

910
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:46,040
He looks like he's a dangerous dude and
he's a power puncher and he hurt Frankie

911
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,100
Edgar really bad in the first round of
their second fight and like really bad.

912
00:50:49,101 --> 00:50:50,600
Knocked him down like three times.
Look there.

913
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,680
The fight was over on several occasions,
but somehow the Frankie Edgar rebounded.

914
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:56,420
They came back and won the second round.

915
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:59,860
It was chaos and then they battled back
and forth to the bitter end and then you

916
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,740
want to be in a draw. Well, this is
the third fight. First round, gray.

917
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:08,630
Maynard hurts Frankie Edgar a den bad,
walks in with an upper cut.

918
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:10,550
It looks like he's on the
verge of getting stopped.

919
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:15,200
Gray Maynard's present for just blast.
And if he catches him a couple of times,

920
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:18,230
has a badly badly hurt when he gets back
to his corner the second round you're

921
00:51:18,231 --> 00:51:19,730
like, man, this kid might be fucked.

922
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:24,410
Second round he goes up and just
boxes and moves boxes and moves.

923
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,670
Third round,
same thing,

924
00:51:25,671 --> 00:51:29,840
boxes and moving boxes and then by the
third or fourth round gray Maynard starts

925
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:32,000
getting desperate. He's like, why
can't hit this fucking kid again?

926
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,880
And he's charging after him and then
they get at it in the fourth round and

927
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:38,300
Frankie Edgar catches him with a punch
and rocks them and then puts them away.

928
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:40,550
It was chaos. Really ever. Have,

929
00:51:40,551 --> 00:51:44,540
I seen a guy get hurt that bad in the
first round and then come back to knock

930
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:46,280
the guy out like that in the fourth round.

931
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:50,360
The fact that he did it in two fights
that he came back from just devastating

932
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:52,720
first rounds.
Those first rounds take a lovable,

933
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,430
you get beaten up like that
takes so much out of you,

934
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,840
and this motherfucker is so tough
that he'd just gutted it out,

935
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:03,080
got through that second round, kept
moving, got through the third round.

936
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:06,020
They had put it on him and
the fourth was fucking crazy.

937
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:09,680
Just a wild fight.
Me and the whole place erupted.

938
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:13,250
People were standing on their feet.
It was just a crazy, crazy fight.

939
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,300
I never find myself being able to
relax, watching MMA. It's hard. I mean,

940
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,580
that's part of the fun
sweating all of a sudden guys,

941
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:26,280
it's not relaxing when it's an active
viewing sport. Addictive issues.

942
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:31,160
Yeah. It's fucking when you, when
you find yourself, when you'd like,

943
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:34,850
when, okay, this is a bad analogy, but
when I was a kid, if I watch people,

944
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:39,800
kids on TV, I would start air
kissing like, wow, really?

945
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:41,240
Yeah. My Dad would be like, what the fuck

946
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,690
would you think about the one day someday
you're going to be able to kiss some

947
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:50,160
money. Yeah, but you nailed it right hand.

948
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:54,710
Everything's stupid. That could have
been done. I did, but when I watch MMA,

949
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:59,510
I find myself going like, like twisting
and turning my body, like uploading stuff.

950
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:02,630
Sometimes I do that.
Like if a guy's not tapping,

951
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:05,090
if a guy's got something and then
somebody got an arm bar or something,

952
00:53:05,091 --> 00:53:09,350
like I got like, I'll hold my arm, I'll
grab my own arm. I got that. That tap tap.

953
00:53:09,351 --> 00:53:13,520
Come on. Do tap like I've, I've said it
before when guys don't have, I'm like,

954
00:53:13,521 --> 00:53:16,370
come on man. Tap. Just
tap or of the tab. Yeah.

955
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:18,260
I don't want anybody to
break their God damn arm.

956
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,240
I don't want to see
that fucking bowl photo.

957
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:24,320
You fucking booze do without
any fucking morning, Joe. I did.

958
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,130
What I posted is,

959
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,670
it's a lesson that we all know,
but some of us need to learn first hand.

960
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:32,910
You Fuck with the bowl? You
get the horns. A guy in Spain,

961
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,710
a bullfighter got a gore.
Oh,

962
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:38,100
throughout a horn through his face where
it came out. His eyeball to new one.

963
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,830
It's a new one.
The photo is just fucking amazing.

964
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:46,160
I was laying in bed like I
can go to sleep. I could wait.

965
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,350
I'm just going to click on this
little link. Joe just posted.

966
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:51,570
Then I had to like go outside and have
a cigarette and think about eyeballs for

967
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:53,410
like 10 minutes and be back home.

968
00:53:53,411 --> 00:53:56,850
He lost his eye is the horn
went through his entire face.

969
00:53:56,851 --> 00:54:00,150
It's fucking incredible, man.
That's the problem. The animals man.

970
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,730
You can't fucking tell him to
slow down. Well, it's a bull.

971
00:54:02,731 --> 00:54:06,480
You're there fighting bulls is the
dumbest fucking thing ever telling me.

972
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:10,600
I got mauled by a bull. You
did? Of course. Yeah. Yeah.
I got mauled by a level.

973
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:16,140
Of course I did travel network,
but happen. I was just online.

974
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,440
It's online. It's online. I'm burnt.

975
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:23,220
The concrete or Herbert hurt.
Bert, what was her burn? Her burn.

976
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:28,460
Aww. I love you. The um, Herbert
was a show I had before birth.

977
00:54:28,461 --> 00:54:31,210
The conqueror is where I take
dangerous manage jobs for a day.

978
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:34,820
He's fought the MMA,
the Gracies.

979
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:39,810
Oh, that's right. I thought that was
from birth to conquer from her birth.

980
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:40,890
And one of the days they call

981
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,090
like you want to be a rodeo clown. And
I was like, I was like, not really.

982
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,640
And then I'll come on, we're going to
the Texas, he'll be a great fucking trip.

983
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:50,510
And then I go thinking I'll
learn something and they
just tell me to show me how

984
00:54:50,511 --> 00:54:52,280
to put the makeup on and that's it.

985
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,510
And then they just put me in the ring
and they pull a fucking bulldoze.

986
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:57,230
You can see it, you can see
it so quick. Um, if you go to,

987
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,380
if you type into youtube
hurt Bert Rodeo clown,

988
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:04,850
it just shows up and you just see my
ribs get broken and I break my foot and

989
00:55:04,851 --> 00:55:05,760
then they go,
what do they say?

990
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:09,320
Don't go to the wall. And
then automatically I went
right to the fucking wall.

991
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,990
I was like, oh I do. I get
out of here with broken ribs

992
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:17,350
was crazy. How crazy your life
is really like you're, you're,

993
00:55:17,351 --> 00:55:20,200
you're no joke.
Your and your documentary,

994
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:23,880
is that going to go through all this
documentary starts this weekend? Yeah.

995
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,210
Starts this weekend in Tempe or Phoenix
at stand up live. If you've been there,

996
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,900
the documentary that you funded with
kickstart funded with kickstarter.com

997
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,630
mainly through this,
through this podcast.

998
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,860
Every listener that I guarantee
every listener if you're listening,

999
00:55:38,861 --> 00:55:41,740
thank you so much for support.
They're all I eat. I texted you,

1000
00:55:41,741 --> 00:55:44,950
I think of the day everyone's
international and I know
that I had never been

1001
00:55:44,951 --> 00:55:48,340
international so it's do this
podcast. That's awesome. That's sweet.

1002
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,790
And your shirts are on
their way and I got shirts,

1003
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,530
I've been wearing them to the listeners.

1004
00:55:53,531 --> 00:55:57,520
Your shirts are on your way or wife is
sitting there at the post office with

1005
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,250
boxes and boxes of shirts and it takes,

1006
00:56:00,251 --> 00:56:04,570
she said it takes one minute per
shirt and she has 3000 shirts.

1007
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:09,010
So she's sitting at the post office and
she had just has to give up after a few

1008
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:11,350
hours because she just can't
stand any more per poor feet.

1009
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:15,400
And so then I'm thinking this is why the
post office is going out of business.

1010
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:20,230
Cause she can't even spend money fast
enough by shipping shit without it taking

1011
00:56:20,231 --> 00:56:23,380
a fucking minute. His shirt, it takes
forever. And I told her, I was like,

1012
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:25,600
I'll do it. And she's like,
no. Can it take any shorter?

1013
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:28,020
I mean it seems pretty reasonable. You
know what, you should be able to do,

1014
00:56:28,021 --> 00:56:28,691
put a name on it.

1015
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:32,100
You'd be able to drop box on it and
then send it across the country. Yeah,

1016
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:34,990
but you should be able to drop off all
her packages that are already with the

1017
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:37,210
address and stuff. Drop it
off and like, all right,

1018
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:40,870
come back in two days and then we'll
give you the bill for it and amend the

1019
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:43,570
minute is probably filling
out the addresses. That's
probably what it is. No, no,

1020
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:45,310
no.
They're already filled out and everything.

1021
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,300
It's all about putting a stamp on it.
It takes forever to like weigh.

1022
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:53,000
It takes a minute to put a stamp on
that.

1023
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:55,440
She's got a high volume
of things she's sending.

1024
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:59,050
But imagine if it wasn't for
fucking ups or stuff like that. God,

1025
00:56:59,051 --> 00:57:01,870
the world would suck. Well she's
probably going through to save money.

1026
00:57:01,871 --> 00:57:04,990
She's probably going through the US
postal system as opposed to going to FedEx

1027
00:57:04,991 --> 00:57:05,980
or ups where it would take,
oh,

1028
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,490
and I'm saying is the post office look at
your about to go out of business? Very,

1029
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:12,040
very fine. That sounds like a
threat, don't you think terrorist?

1030
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:12,970
Don't you think that is?

1031
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,370
I think because of the Patriot Act
they could probably arrest you now.

1032
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,510
They probably could. But you see
that? Do you see that happening?

1033
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,300
I mean all my bills now are through my
email. Even when I go to the fucking bank,

1034
00:57:22,301 --> 00:57:23,430
it sends my receipt to me.

1035
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,140
I heard you guys talking about that
when I was in the bathroom putting my

1036
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:28,740
Rogaine on and I thought to myself,
yeah,

1037
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:32,180
but how else are we going to get the
shirts there? We need the boat. Of course.

1038
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,070
I can't just email. It can be private
third parties that have more sense like,

1039
00:57:36,071 --> 00:57:39,910
Hey, no, you just drop off all your shit
and yeah, that's all you have to do. Yeah.

1040
00:57:39,911 --> 00:57:41,410
UPS is so much,

1041
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,590
infinitely better than the point of the
towns will never go to the post office.

1042
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:49,240
I, it's totally makes sense
stuff. It saves you money,
but yeah, it'd be like that.

1043
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,150
That's unfortunate that needless to say,

1044
00:57:52,151 --> 00:57:55,010
the shirts are being shit
that are sent being sent out.

1045
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,100
The biggest problem was
because everyone in the second,

1046
00:57:57,101 --> 00:57:59,650
you were one on the podcast,
everyone below up, they're like,

1047
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:00,850
I want to fucking dope shirt.

1048
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,970
It is a total shit that people
commented on it a bunch of times.

1049
00:58:03,971 --> 00:58:07,210
I want it to Texas. I know, I saw
that somebody tweeted like, awesome,

1050
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:11,590
how do you see you have a machine shirt?
I was like, well cause come on. Seriously.

1051
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:14,560
How the fuck you asking that question?
Monkey Todd.

1052
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,473
God bless monkeys.

1053
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:21,460
Now you hung out with monkey Todd and
there was photos posted and you are both

1054
00:58:21,461 --> 00:58:24,430
not wearing shirts.
I haven't questioned.

1055
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,720
Why don't you explain to people
who'd look, he's a fan of the show.

1056
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,050
Yeah, he, he, he actually,

1057
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:35,950
he told Bert this whole story about his
life about getting cancer and all this

1058
00:58:35,951 --> 00:58:39,730
shit like that and talking about
that. Oh, I might not want you to see

1059
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,920
your podcast kind of helped him.

1060
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:47,970
I helped him up with UFC tickets
and sat right next to Ari. Yeah,

1061
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:52,030
he's a really cool guy. Really grounded.
And I hung out with them for the night,

1062
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,540
like we not into the night we hang out.
And then he was like, I got that role.

1063
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:58,230
He has a desk squad cat tattooed
on his arm. That's crazy eyes.

1064
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,470
He's did the Nancy grace video.

1065
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:02,980
But every time you post photos
you always have your shirt off.

1066
00:59:02,981 --> 00:59:04,810
Is this something that you do,
like when you're at a party,

1067
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,790
just to explain that Nancy grace video,

1068
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:09,700
you just glossed over what we talked
about on the podcast before, but,

1069
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:13,270
but for purple people are just listening
to this one. Just what did he do?

1070
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:18,250
He pretty much, he calls in shows and one
of the shows he caught it and was TMZ.

1071
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:22,190
Nancy grace was on this show and he
did like, who would you fuck marry,

1072
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:26,920
kill? Uh, with me, Sam Tripoli
and teat Jason Tebow. And uh,

1073
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:31,160
it got on the air and it did it that
the producer director did not pull it

1074
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:32,810
either.
They'd let it run.

1075
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,680
And so monkey Todd was just like
continuing like just making it the most

1076
00:59:36,681 --> 00:59:41,320
uncomfortable video ever and
fuck you.

1077
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,260
And he confused it a lot.
Like he talked a lot,

1078
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:49,160
he taught his method is talking a lot of
jibberish so it's like what the fuck is

1079
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:53,240
he talking about? And then go on, so
would you fuck marry, kill a red band,

1080
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:56,000
same Tripoli and Jason Tebow and and a he.

1081
00:59:56,001 --> 01:00:00,050
So he did this and what's crazy is that
Nancy grace was like the first time a

1082
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:02,900
TMZ was like,
like we're going to have real guests now.

1083
01:00:02,901 --> 01:00:03,640
We're going to start having yeah,

1084
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,660
real guests now.
And that's how they screw it.

1085
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,770
But that's how you're going to go
live, man. If you're going to go live,

1086
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:12,060
that's just what you get. You're going
to have Baba buoys once in a while.

1087
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,120
I love them.
They make me laugh.

1088
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,080
It's hilarious when they get someone
who's like a witness to something and

1089
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:21,890
they'd go deep, deep, deep into it and
then they blah blah blah. Then you go,

1090
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:23,150
oh you motherfucker.

1091
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,710
The other side of that though,
and we've heard this a million times,

1092
01:00:26,711 --> 01:00:29,440
is when you're trying to get interviews
to get the fuck out of there and

1093
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:33,190
someone's like, yeah, yeah,
Sandy was football rules.
Fuck you and then runs off.

1094
01:00:33,191 --> 01:00:35,560
You're like, damn it. I was
so close to wrapping the day.

1095
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,330
Now I've got to do another human being.

1096
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:39,140
I had something bad happen.

1097
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:44,170
I was stuck on the side of a road in
Hollywood on Saturday and it had to pee

1098
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,300
really bad and,

1099
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,460
but I wasn't anywhere near a bathroom
as a check point going on and stuff like

1100
01:00:49,461 --> 01:00:51,050
that.
So I had to pee.

1101
01:00:51,051 --> 01:00:55,250
I found a mountain dew bottle that I
was peeing in and pouring it out my my

1102
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:55,701
window,

1103
01:00:55,701 --> 01:00:58,970
like I had to fill it up five times
cause you'd be amazed how much p actually

1104
01:00:58,971 --> 01:01:03,440
fits a mountain dew bottles. And this
person walked by my car just jogging,

1105
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:06,740
like being healthy and she stepped
in my pee and she just see,

1106
01:01:06,741 --> 01:01:10,780
you're like looking down at the ground
going, what did I just step off?

1107
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:15,570
It's a story is so layered.
I don't know where to start with.

1108
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:18,510
You know what it's like, it's like
a Stanley Kubrick movie. It's not,

1109
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:20,400
what you're seeing is
not what you're saying.

1110
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:25,700
It's all about symbolism
and what the key represents.

1111
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,070
Brian's common sense

1112
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:35,340
says he's this leaking it out of his body.

1113
01:01:35,341 --> 01:01:37,530
Like he can't get it out
of his body quick enough.

1114
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:39,710
There's way too much common sense.
Describe.

1115
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,990
He starts the story and I saw
your eyes go, he's mad at me.

1116
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:45,860
Can you tell just mad at me today.
I'm not mad at you at all.

1117
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:50,100
I just told you many times not to talk
on the microphone like this because it

1118
01:01:50,101 --> 01:01:52,740
changes a sa the volume of the podcast.

1119
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:56,820
And so when I, when I brought that up,
I felt you tense up. But it's just,

1120
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,020
I'm just telling Ya. All right. Flying
Dildos. Tell me about this. Okay.

1121
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:02,580
This is the,
this is,

1122
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:05,150
this is what you were talking about
right before you told years. Damn.

1123
01:02:05,151 --> 01:02:06,240
They keep her story.

1124
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:13,800
Can we smoke in here? Sure. So not
that I smoke, I don't smoke weed,

1125
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:17,360
but I was just asking for you guys. So let
me tell you, you want us to mark up. Um,

1126
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,970
so,
uh,

1127
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:23,030
so I'm going to wait to
tell the story until you're

1128
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:25,640
available. Joe. Someone has a Burt,

1129
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,130
you watched the South Park documentary
last night, which was the most,

1130
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:31,970
which was one of the most
amazing documentaries.

1131
01:02:31,971 --> 01:02:34,270
And so glad that led fucking good.

1132
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:37,650
And one of the coolest things ever
was that Trey Parker and Matt Stone,

1133
01:02:37,651 --> 01:02:42,360
we're talking about a tripping on acid
when they had to go to the Academy Awards

1134
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,480
and Matt Stone dressed up as a woman and
was Trey's a date during the thing and

1135
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:51,630
they played clips on it.
And it was so weird seeing,

1136
01:02:51,631 --> 01:02:55,710
cause I had seen that interview before,
but now seeing Trey Parker on acid,

1137
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:58,800
you could totally tell Joe is one of
the best documentaries I've ever seen.

1138
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:03,450
It's literally a here, give it
back to Joe. Oh No, I don't smoke.

1139
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:07,470
You don't smoke? No, I don't totally
defeated myself. We can get this to Joe.

1140
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,060
I gotta fix this camera roll

1141
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:13,070
real quick. Run out real quick.
Uh, oh here. Yeah. So, um,

1142
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,090
I told him if he did whatever process.

1143
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:23,670
So anyway, we have the south Pandosy
documentaries fucking out of this world.

1144
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:26,660
Yeah. That's documentaries. I
was, I, I was thinking that,

1145
01:03:26,661 --> 01:03:28,130
wouldn't it be awesome if they took,

1146
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,960
can we get to the flying, build those
first cause we might forget. Yes. Okay.

1147
01:03:32,961 --> 01:03:36,740
Flying Dildos. Here we go. So I called
Joe, this is what you said. You Go,

1148
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,560
we were just talking about
this and you're like, yeah,

1149
01:03:39,561 --> 01:03:42,260
you got so many crazy stories that have
happened to you and it, and, and, and,

1150
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,330
but I never think that,
I think there are just things in my life.

1151
01:03:44,331 --> 01:03:45,111
I think it's my ability,

1152
01:03:45,111 --> 01:03:48,320
the way I see something
happen is different than the
way everyone else sees it

1153
01:03:48,321 --> 01:03:52,430
happen. You know? I see the,
the little thing that, that
registers and me, I go all,

1154
01:03:52,431 --> 01:03:53,660
that's my thing,
you know,

1155
01:03:53,661 --> 01:03:57,650
and it lights up for me where my wife
just glazes over it and it's come to light

1156
01:03:57,651 --> 01:03:59,990
in this podcast more than
anything. The machine. I mean,

1157
01:03:59,991 --> 01:04:02,150
the way I've told the story
to fucking a million people,

1158
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:04,040
but then when I told him to do
something lit up and I went, Ooh,

1159
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:07,700
that is a good story, right? The fucking
fighting a bear, the fuck everything.

1160
01:04:07,701 --> 01:04:10,910
I'm getting mauled by a bull, Tracy
Morgan, everything's lights up.

1161
01:04:10,911 --> 01:04:14,240
So then I'm talking on the
phone today. I see you, hey,

1162
01:04:14,241 --> 01:04:18,130
can you do by do and you go.
I said,

1163
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:20,960
I'm on the phone with Delta,
American Airlines trying to get upgraded.

1164
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:24,140
You're like, where you going? I said,
Amsterdam. He said, I've never been there.

1165
01:04:24,141 --> 01:04:27,200
I said, oh, whatever you do, if you ever
go there, don't go see flying dildos.

1166
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:31,290
True story, right. So, so
I'm fucking like 22. I'm at,

1167
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:35,010
I'm an in Amsterdam where with
like five friends and there.

1168
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:39,920
And of course we do the
rounds in Amsterdam and get
fucking lit up a Heineken

1169
01:04:39,921 --> 01:04:43,370
factory, hedge jobs, I
think even maybe mushrooms.

1170
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:49,100
We walked by this live sex show and
it says on the billboard, guy on girl,

1171
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:52,370
girl on girl, oral sex,
uh, this, this, this.

1172
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:54,620
And then the last one is flying dildos.

1173
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:57,620
Come see flying dildos
since all Mike fucking,

1174
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:00,500
I tell everyone we're seeing fine dildos.
I want to see fucking flying deal does.

1175
01:05:00,501 --> 01:05:02,390
That to me is a showstopper.

1176
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,970
That is something that I will
buy tickets for everyone for us.

1177
01:05:04,971 --> 01:05:07,700
Why buy us all tickets? We go in and see
a live sex show. Have you ever seen one?

1178
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:11,120
No. It's basically like,
like half a boxing ring.

1179
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,560
So it's like you walk in and it's stadium
seating and then half a boxing ring

1180
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:18,970
where they just without the ropes they
just, everything happens right there.

1181
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:23,200
They just fuck it. Just fuck and Oh and
our dudes beating off in the audience.

1182
01:05:23,201 --> 01:05:26,050
Are you allowed to wear lipstick? No.
Dude's aren't beating off in the audience.

1183
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:27,150
No,
it's a,

1184
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:29,560
it is kind of creepy now that you say
that because I don't know what we were

1185
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:32,980
supposed to do, but there was like 20
people in there, but we sat in there yet.

1186
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:35,590
I guess maybe you should have been, but
we didn't and we ruined it for everyone.

1187
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:40,220
So we sit down and they're like, they come
out and they're like, the first is um,

1188
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:42,460
girl on girl. This is just
like ut a porn, right?

1189
01:05:42,461 --> 01:05:45,120
So two girls come out and they're like,
they get,

1190
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,300
they got to eat and I s and
just taken two girls come out.

1191
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:51,130
I start going flying dildos,
flying doers and they're like, no,

1192
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:54,880
we're not playing deldot's. I
go, ah, now do any guys are like,

1193
01:05:54,881 --> 01:05:58,420
well I want to see flying dildos too.
So they do their thing, they leave.

1194
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:02,110
A girl comes out by herself, masturbation
and I go flying dildos and she goes, no,

1195
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:06,040
I'm not flying dildos. I fucking, everyone
that came to the stage, I just yelled.

1196
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,360
How many people came to the, and like
nine acts, nine acts come to the stage.

1197
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:11,740
How about how long is each one doing?

1198
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,370
Five minutes and fucking masturbating
and meeting each other out and then

1199
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:18,670
blowing a dude and then the guy fucks a
girl that's like the headliner, right?

1200
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,740
Like, and we get to the guy
fucking the girl and I'm like,

1201
01:06:20,741 --> 01:06:24,430
you better be fucking flying dildos. And
the guys like, we're not flinging dildos.

1202
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:27,390
Okay, stop with the fucking
playing dildos. And I'm like, oh,

1203
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,600

01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,080
I think it works that way kid.

1244
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:59,170
You've had a good 2011 you got to get
2011 by by a bad 2011 I think your 2011

1245
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:06,530
still pretty fucking good dude.
Crazy craziest I've ever had ever.

1246
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:11,450
I've never had so much crazy shit this
year. It's a lot of crazy stuff I've had.

1247
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:16,430
Yeah. Yeah. You bring that on yourself,
kid. You're a lot of what Brian? Brian?

1248
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:19,820
Like the secret 20 minutes ago you were
just talking about smoking oxycontin.

1249
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:25,090
Yeah. Not going to make you look at
2011 in a positive light like yeah.

1250
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:27,800
That's how the future
roles in strong dude.

1251
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:31,520
Obviously he's smoking oxies
with Straw. Yeah. Come on.

1252
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:35,810
At what point do you put the meth and
the light bulb and go little smoke it and

1253
01:09:35,811 --> 01:09:39,100
see what happens?
I tried it twice and it's like your,

1254
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:41,360
that's like a drug that
you could actually take.

1255
01:09:41,361 --> 01:09:44,330
It's not like fucking psycho drug.
It's not like crystal meth.

1256
01:09:44,331 --> 01:09:47,910
This is actually a pill that's for
cancer patients or something like that,

1257
01:09:47,911 --> 01:09:52,220
but it's opiates. It's
heroin. It's heroin.

1258
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:56,840
You think? Well, yeah. Okay. Very good
to be jump on your side on this argument,

1259
01:09:56,841 --> 01:09:59,990
but I'm on Joe's page.
Oh, 100% it's heroin.

1260
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,680
Biddle level run a lot of pills
and I've never taken an auction,

1261
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:03,920
but I've tried it.

1262
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:09,070
Two hits of probably a hundred hits that
that pill gave off during the trial of

1263
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:13,280
the group I was with, so I took two
hits of what other people were doing.

1264
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,330
Two to 300 probably hits for the
whole night. Was that, wait, wait,

1265
01:10:17,331 --> 01:10:21,980
wait about two to 300 heads and they
were just pretty much puffing on the same

1266
01:10:21,981 --> 01:10:23,780
pill over and over again.
It was like,

1267
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:27,170
it was like smoking a whole
bowl of weed or more, you know,

1268
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:31,310
it would think anybody give up 300 hits
of Oxycontin and right now was probably

1269
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:33,440
over exaggerated.
But his math is,

1270
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:36,210
how crazy is that that you're willing
to smoke something and if you smoked it

1271
01:10:36,211 --> 01:10:38,340
300 times in the road,
fucking for sure Kelly,

1272
01:10:38,341 --> 01:10:41,310
you 100% they'll go one you'll go to.

1273
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:46,460
But if you will got in 30 31 32 and
then you got into 50 pretty good self

1274
01:10:47,731 --> 01:10:48,540
control though.
No,

1275
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:52,020
but I'm saying what I'm saying is when
you're doing is if you took two hits,

1276
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:56,730
you know and you just kept going in really
did what you said people did 300 yeah,

1277
01:10:56,731 --> 01:10:57,564
he'd be dead.

1278
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,750
That's crazy that you're willing to
take even two of those and you're like,

1279
01:11:00,751 --> 01:11:03,060
you're willing to step two
steps on the way to death.

1280
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:07,680
Two steps on the way to a 300 step way
to drink alcohol. Yeah, sure. Same thing.

1281
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:09,600
I'm not,
I'm not claiming that I'm above it.

1282
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:13,830
I'm just saying it's a fascinating thing
called cause way more people fucking

1283
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:19,183
drinking.
Yeah.

1284
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:24,970
Wait, you're saying you could drink
alcohol and be fucking alcohol? Yeah.

1285
01:11:24,971 --> 01:11:29,730
Alcohol doesn't get more
people in the, he kills it.

1286
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:31,150
Well, don't get, don't get wrong.

1287
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:34,720
It tells a lot of people 100,000
alcohol Friday morning. I'll tell you,

1288
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:36,160
there's 300 million
people in this country.

1289
01:11:36,161 --> 01:11:39,880
Roughly around 80 to a hundred thousand
people die every year from alcohol

1290
01:11:39,881 --> 01:11:44,650
poisoning, from alcohol induced
death, overdosing and alcohol.

1291
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:48,010
Um, and then there's more that
die from drunk driving. That's,

1292
01:11:48,011 --> 01:11:51,580
that's well over 100,000 that die
from drunk driving. So that's,

1293
01:11:51,581 --> 01:11:53,800
that's what you get attributed.
The alcohol desk really,

1294
01:11:53,801 --> 01:11:56,660
you can only attribute the,
the poisonings though.

1295
01:11:57,190 --> 01:12:00,340
The rest of it is just doing things that
you can't control while you're drunk,

1296
01:12:00,341 --> 01:12:03,240
which is, you know, it's still
his death, but it's not, you know,

1297
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:04,870
it's not like an LD 50 rate.

1298
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,540
So it's like how many drinks would
you have to have before you died?

1299
01:12:07,541 --> 01:12:09,880
It probably not that many man.
Probably even less than oxy.

1300
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:13,990
I mean we said 300 oxies would kill
your 300 hits of oxy would kill you.

1301
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,890
Exaggerating.
I probably said they did like whatever.

1302
01:12:16,891 --> 01:12:21,891
A bowl of really a big huge bowl of wheat
cause I mean they were there for maybe

1303
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:22,810
an hour.

1304
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:25,930
Okay. My point was how many
shots can you, can you drink?

1305
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,590
You can't even drink 20 shots.
You might be dead at 20 you might be dead.

1306
01:12:29,591 --> 01:12:33,430
If you had to 30 you might be dead
at 30 that's pretty God damn clothes.

1307
01:12:33,431 --> 01:12:37,930
That's a lot closer than 300 you
know? You know, sometimes you go five,

1308
01:12:37,931 --> 01:12:42,400
six Deepa at night, so you're a
quarter to weighted dead. Yeah. Ooh.

1309
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:47,980
Are we talking about me
right now? [inaudible] you're
talking about human beings.

1310
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,720
No. Yeah, they're definitely. Here's the
thing that's more dangerous about alcohol.

1311
01:12:52,721 --> 01:12:56,680
Did any of that is I have a buddy who goes
to Chicago, has a few bottles of wine,

1312
01:12:56,681 --> 01:12:59,110
take some allergy medicine or
whatever in the middle of the night.

1313
01:12:59,111 --> 01:13:01,630
Wakes up pass like drunk stumbling,

1314
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:05,270
smashes through a fucking plate
glass coffee table. Oh my God.

1315
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:09,820
Fucking destroys his face. Two kids.
Oh No. Just having some wine. Fucking,

1316
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:13,060
I mean he was taking an allergy
or cold flu medicine or whatever,

1317
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:15,290
but do you know,
but he's a grown up.

1318
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:17,680
A lot of people have that old school
growing up mentality with her.

1319
01:13:17,681 --> 01:13:19,210
I'm a fucking grown up.
I can take care of myself.

1320
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,540
I know I've done it a million times
and you go, ah, fuck it. I'm good.

1321
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:25,840
I'm in a hotel room. What's I'm having?
I'm downstairs. I get in the elevator,

1322
01:13:25,841 --> 01:13:26,950
go upstairs.
What's the worse that can happen?

1323
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:30,580
But body falls to a plate glass fogging
thing doesn't even know what he did.

1324
01:13:30,581 --> 01:13:34,030
Just wakes up in the middle of the night
base bloody calls his wife and she's

1325
01:13:34,031 --> 01:13:34,670
like,

1326
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:38,380
I get you a first class ticket home and
we'll have a doctor look at you tomorrow

1327
01:13:38,381 --> 01:13:43,120
morning. Like what? That's the thing that
scares me about alcohol, not the Dui,

1328
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:47,880
not the fucking liver shit. It's the
fucking immediate, you know that.

1329
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:50,410
That's what terrifies me.
Shit like that.

1330
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,390
Just a dumb accidents like you're drunk
and you're naked and you're like, oh,

1331
01:13:53,391 --> 01:13:57,850
suddenly a toenail breaking. Yeah, slip
and I fall in the showers three times.

1332
01:13:58,570 --> 01:14:03,280
Yeah. Not like you can get fucked
up in a shower. Man. Rubber.

1333
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:05,170
That was just happened
to meet the other day.

1334
01:14:05,171 --> 01:14:07,960
I fell and I grabbed my stuff
right at the last second,

1335
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,920
but I have a glass shower that door

1336
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:15,760
and like it was really like I was looking
at going like this would have ended

1337
01:14:15,761 --> 01:14:18,140
really bad.
That's why I only use curtains worse.

1338
01:14:18,141 --> 01:14:21,740
It happens when you fucking fall in the
shower with the curt and the here and

1339
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,860
then you're fucking on the ground.

1340
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:26,530
Yeah, that's a good point. That's
scary as fuck. Fucking terrifying.

1341
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,380
In the shower you can really,
people die like that every year.

1342
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:31,960
I wonder what the numbers of that
are there. Probably like pretty high.

1343
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,120
I bet it's a thousand people a year.

1344
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,790
I mean it's more than than
whatever that drug was.

1345
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,590
150 people die a year cause
coconuts falling head.

1346
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,800
You know what though?
I started looking at the,

1347
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:47,500
had we had a palm tree leaning over our
house and I started looking at palm tree

1348
01:14:47,501 --> 01:14:49,210
fatalities.
It's up there man.

1349
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:52,630
Like those or tried those limbs
fall off hitch on the head.

1350
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:57,070
The trees aren't saddled climate,
maybe two. I'll put those in there too.

1351
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:01,270
I don't care. But those things aren't
deeply rooted so they fall over sometimes.

1352
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:05,240
Really? They're very bendable cause
they're full of water but the,

1353
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:09,340
there aren't deeply rooted trees so
they can fucking fall on houses easy.

1354
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:13,410
So they just, you know you could be
walking by and they'll just land on you.

1355
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:14,890
A palm tree frog.
Yeah.

1356
01:15:14,891 --> 01:15:17,770
We have a dude coming to our house on
Wednesday to get all our palm tree frons

1357
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:21,400
out and we got clean palm trees
for like 75 bucks each tree.

1358
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,140
But you've got to give me up on that shit.

1359
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:26,350
Do you guys say cut those
things off your trees for yard?

1360
01:15:26,351 --> 01:15:29,890
They usually typically gay people.
Like is that a gay job to do?

1361
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:37,110
What? Tree cutters? None of
that. Only specialize in palm.
That alarm. What you say?

1362
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:42,040
Palm trees, right. Wait,
take. Took a break.

1363
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:47,050
The uh, I had, no, no, he's Mexican and
he's a, he just came out and he's like,

1364
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:48,360
he,

1365
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:52,170
I got an email saying he needed to do
survey the area and then he came out and

1366
01:15:52,171 --> 01:15:57,171
he's clearly didn't speak any English
and he was like 70 70 and I go,

1367
01:15:59,711 --> 01:16:00,670
he's telling you 70 bucks.

1368
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:04,480
I get this real fucking complex email
about him saying he needs to come out,

1369
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:07,220
surveyed the area, take a look
at an appraisal after I get it.

1370
01:16:07,221 --> 01:16:09,780
And he gets an appraisal to come back
to me and he just comes out and he goes,

1371
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:14,230
77, 70, 75, 75 70, right?
I go a tree and he goes,

1372
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:18,490
sure. I go, perfect. And then he left.
Didn't say any more than that, but yeah,

1373
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:19,780
that's the guy,
Mexican guy.

1374
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,860
So he climbs up, make sure those things
don't drop on your head and kill you.

1375
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:23,411
Climbs up.

1376
01:16:23,411 --> 01:16:27,280
He's cutting them all out tomorrow or
Wednesday that they're pretty fucking

1377
01:16:27,281 --> 01:16:29,500
heavy man. Dude, they're fucking monsters.

1378
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:33,480
You were just tugged of ones and
that easily could kill you. Ease it.

1379
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:36,220
You kill a child in a, in
a heartbeat. Ooh. Yeah.

1380
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:37,660
That's why you gotta get
that shit taken care of.

1381
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:41,470
We have one that hadn't been cut
and like by eight years in our,

1382
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:44,440
in our front yard, that was our
neighbors and our neighbor was like,

1383
01:16:44,441 --> 01:16:47,350
and I was like, I got kids. Oh you
playing in the front yard dogs,

1384
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,730
we can't have that.
She had fallen down.

1385
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,080
How weird is that?
You have to worry about palm fronds

1386
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:52,820
fucking yeah,
I know everyone.

1387
01:16:52,821 --> 01:16:56,700
Like of all the shit that was going to
kill me that I was going to be a plane

1388
01:16:56,701 --> 01:16:57,534
flight.

1389
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:59,920
You keep talking about plane flights.

1390
01:16:59,921 --> 01:17:02,300
Do you really freak out about
playing fides? Fucking terrified.

1391
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:03,440
Do you think in any way,

1392
01:17:03,441 --> 01:17:08,210
shape or form that all these fear and
worrying about things puts a certain

1393
01:17:08,211 --> 01:17:10,370
amount of energy out that attracts

1394
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:13,640
negative things to you?
I do, but I believe that.

1395
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:18,320
I feel like ignoring it
puts out a taunting energy.
Taunting what you're saying.

1396
01:17:18,321 --> 01:17:21,230
I'm not scared of you bitch.
You know what? Fuck it.

1397
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:25,220
I'm not scared of flying anymore. That's
when God goes, ah, fucking see my rack.

1398
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:29,710
So you have the Catholic version of God
where he has to fear you have to be or

1399
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,810
excuse me, where you have to
fear him rather. Yeah. Will
you tell him your secret?

1400
01:17:32,811 --> 01:17:35,020
And he's like, yeah. He's like, well
who the fuck you think you're talking?

1401
01:17:35,021 --> 01:17:37,100
I'm talking about God right now.
You want to talk about some gay shit.

1402
01:17:37,101 --> 01:17:38,780
You talked to St Jude,
that's who you talked to you.

1403
01:17:38,781 --> 01:17:39,950
You don't talk to me about that shit.

1404
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:44,780
So you think that by not thinking about
the plane crash by getting healthy about

1405
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:49,730
it, then it would be like you weren't
respecting it exactly. 100% wow.

1406
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:53,400
What a crazy way to look at things.
I have rituals for flying.

1407
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:54,860
I wash it every part of my body.

1408
01:17:54,910 --> 01:17:58,190
Get all my hands and knees and say
a prayer in the shower. Really?

1409
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:01,530
Fuck yeah cause I did it once and I
flew back at by me is that was going on.

1410
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:02,660
I thought we fixed this.

1411
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:11,600
Scoot out a little bit here.
We fix this so he could sneak by me.

1412
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:16,910
Thank you. Got Bigger. Oh my, uh,

1413
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:21,350
just Fyi, my web guy put up
something about the t, the shirts,

1414
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:25,670
the machine shirts on burp or burt.com
they're taking preorders now we finally

1415
01:18:25,671 --> 01:18:28,880
got the fucking licensing of the image.
It's a fucking nightmare.

1416
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:32,900
Licensing of your own image
was a nightmare. Yeah, because
I didn't create it. It,

1417
01:18:32,901 --> 01:18:33,980
same thing happened with my DVD.

1418
01:18:33,981 --> 01:18:37,310
My DVD has a shirt with a
carrot on it and it says hello.

1419
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:40,130
It's a joke I have about,
if you're gonna put a vegetable,

1420
01:18:40,131 --> 01:18:42,770
the girl's ass don't use a cucumber.
That's like a home invasion. Use a carrot.

1421
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:47,340
That's more like a, a low. So then we
couldn't get the licensing to the imaging.

1422
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,570
I wouldn't give it to us. He goes, now,
I did it for the DVD. If you want it,

1423
01:18:50,571 --> 01:18:52,910
you give me like 20 grand. And I
was like, I was like, all right,

1424
01:18:52,911 --> 01:18:54,200
now we'll just won't ever sold this DVD.

1425
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,530
And this is an artist that did this as an
artist, but in artists that worked for,

1426
01:18:57,810 --> 01:19:00,670
uh, whatever, the company
that distributed the DVD. Wow.

1427
01:19:00,671 --> 01:19:04,490
So he just needs in a box you out.
It was like, fuck it, you want it,

1428
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:07,640
give me like give me that. I think is
offered was like 10 grand. I was like,

1429
01:19:07,641 --> 01:19:09,110
I don't have 10 grand man.
He goes, well you made,

1430
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:12,020
you know that you've made that do
it. It's all in the shirts. Yeah.

1431
01:19:12,021 --> 01:19:15,260
That's ridiculous. So then, but, but,
but here's what happens is, so the guy,

1432
01:19:15,261 --> 01:19:17,630
we did the documentary and he made
the shirt, that machine shirt,

1433
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:21,320
and he did it as a favor to his friends
took, we're doing the documentary.

1434
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:24,050
So they were made specifically
for the documentary.

1435
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,170
And then this is the documentary that
you're about to shoot. Yeah. And then,

1436
01:19:27,171 --> 01:19:30,560
and then, but I was like, Hey, can
we can sell those on the road and,

1437
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,960
and the two group film guys
are like, fuck yeah. You know,

1438
01:19:32,961 --> 01:19:34,460
definitely will fulfill our documentaries.

1439
01:19:34,461 --> 01:19:36,740
Those will be special shirts
are not going to be all offered.

1440
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:40,580
That shirt isn't gonna be offered, you
know, in the other color scheme. But yeah,

1441
01:19:40,581 --> 01:19:43,900
totally sell it. And so we went,
okay. And then the guy said, yeah,

1442
01:19:43,901 --> 01:19:45,620
you make it a college can do
whatever the one you could sell them.

1443
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:48,080
And then the artists, we had to come back
to the artist and the artist was like,

1444
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:52,340
no. I was like, why not? He's like,
because they're made for this documentary.

1445
01:19:52,341 --> 01:19:52,971
I did it for friends,

1446
01:19:52,971 --> 01:19:55,730
I didn't do it for you to go out
and make a fucking fortune on it.

1447
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:59,480
And so then we had to kind of negotiate
to the guy and say, listen, you know,

1448
01:19:59,481 --> 01:20:01,610
I'm not, you know, it was,
it was a long process,

1449
01:20:01,611 --> 01:20:04,920
very long process of everyone
that seems like can hit the man,

1450
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:10,550
want you making any money, man. He's just
like, yeah, and he did this for free, man.

1451
01:20:10,551 --> 01:20:14,640
It's from my friends. You're not my
friend. So then so other people want it,

1452
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:19,140
right. And then it won't be underground
man. And then he's like, you know,

1453
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,810
so anyway,
so we got him finally to say,

1454
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,570
if you want to sell it on your
site or on on what you call it,

1455
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:27,570
you can do it and you know,
negotiation shit.

1456
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:31,410
And so we just put it on Burp or Berta
calm. But you can, you can order them,

1457
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:32,340
preorder them.
I mean,

1458
01:20:32,341 --> 01:20:34,740
I think all the fulfillments have
to go out first and they're gone.

1459
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:36,900
They're already out. But if you
wanna go to burp her birth to calm,

1460
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,250
you'll find in the store,

1461
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:42,570
you'll find the machine shirt and you
can now you can fucking stop emailing me

1462
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:45,000
about where to get them and when to
get them there on how many emails you

1463
01:20:45,001 --> 01:20:49,140
getting a month is a fucking nonstop.
The day you warriors on a,

1464
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:53,490
on the podcast fucking a million people
going like, hey man, I wanted to,

1465
01:20:53,491 --> 01:20:54,870
I want to do anything
in the documentary now.

1466
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:57,090
Like I didn't know what the
shirt looked like. I was like,

1467
01:20:57,570 --> 01:20:59,100
are you fucking serious?
So

1468
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:02,800
the documentary, the shirt is
what got them to want to do it.

1469
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:06,350
Uh, the shirt that's like, that's
brilliant marketing the shirt man.

1470
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:08,780
But we would've never gotten the short
made if we hadn't done the documentary.

1471
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,640
But isn't that funny
that that works that way?

1472
01:21:10,641 --> 01:21:13,110
That someone sees a shirt and it's a
dope shirt and like this documentary is

1473
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,550
gonna fucking rule. Yes. Cause they see
the shirt, but it's you, it's you. It's,

1474
01:21:16,551 --> 01:21:19,040
I mean like don't, don't like
undersell it. You're the first one,

1475
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:20,690
but you're being a regular human being.
When you said as you go,

1476
01:21:20,691 --> 01:21:23,420
you gotta get me one asap.
Like I want to wear it on fear factor.

1477
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:26,330
I want to wear it on the podcast.
So we rush it. We get it.

1478
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:27,620
A couple of sent to you,

1479
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:30,560
a couple sentences like other people
that we know that are important to us and

1480
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:33,830
you wear it and it fucking blows up,
like literally blows up.

1481
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,160
Well that's uh,
that's nice that I can do that.

1482
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:39,650
It's a pretty easy we'll
have to do is wear a shirt.

1483
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:43,980
Yeah. Or they feel like I did anything.
You know, you just made a bad ass shirt.

1484
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:47,520
No chance to wear it. It's negative.
Yeah. So yeah. So if you want to get,

1485
01:21:47,521 --> 01:21:50,700
I'm gonna to burp her. Berta.
Com. Bert, Bert, Bert with ease.

1486
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:56,250
Powerful. Bert. Kreischer so
what else, what else going on?

1487
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:58,590
I don't know what the fuck's Brian Doing?
It's making video.

1488
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:02,320
How, how sad are you about Steve Jobs? I,

1489
01:22:02,321 --> 01:22:06,640
it hit me pretty hard or harder than
what right. And it's harder then. No,

1490
01:22:06,641 --> 01:22:11,590
but like when anyone dies, like when like
Farley died, I was affected. I was like,

1491
01:22:11,591 --> 01:22:14,710
wow, you know, I've really
enjoyed watching Chris Farley.

1492
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:17,430
That was kind of like I was connected
to him and I didn't know him.

1493
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:19,450
Steve jobs kind of same way.

1494
01:22:19,451 --> 01:22:24,430
Like I effected me in a weird level and
I wasn't sad. I didn't cry or anything,

1495
01:22:24,431 --> 01:22:25,264
but I,

1496
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,690
it's pretty amazing looking back at like
the videos of him giving speeches and

1497
01:22:28,691 --> 01:22:29,524
stuff like that.

1498
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:34,790
Well, Steve Jobs was a bad motherfucker,
but like all bad motherfuckers,

1499
01:22:34,791 --> 01:22:37,180
he was flawed, you know? And um,

1500
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:40,820
he was a ruthless dude and
did a lot of, uh, you know,

1501
01:22:40,821 --> 01:22:45,230
with a lot of people would say is
questionable shit. First of all,

1502
01:22:45,231 --> 01:22:48,080
they had fucking slave labor that we're
making the right phones. That's a, I mean,

1503
01:22:48,081 --> 01:22:51,260
it's Chinese.
These factories is Foxconn factories.

1504
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:54,020
They have to have nets all around the
factories to keep people from jumping off

1505
01:22:54,021 --> 01:22:55,310
the roof. You know, there's,

1506
01:22:55,311 --> 01:22:58,730
there's a lot of weird Karma involved
and stuff like that. And you know,

1507
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:03,500
I'm a total hypocrite because I have
an iPhone, you know, I mean, I'm not a,

1508
01:23:03,501 --> 01:23:05,980
I'm not boycotting
these companies that use

1509
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,670
this, this kind of labor, but I
mean, it was pretty public. They had,

1510
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:12,340
they have nets around these places to
keep people from jumping off the roofs.

1511
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,550
They work 15 hours a day and they sleep
on cots and it's fucking gross, man.

1512
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:22,300
It's gross. And it's scary that people
can be forced to live like that.

1513
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:27,100
Just to survive in 2011 is open that he,
do you think he knew that?

1514
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:28,090
He fought for sure.
Knew it.

1515
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:32,950
He knew that he was aware of every single
aspect of every day to day operation

1516
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:36,070
at Apple.
He was incredible CEO.

1517
01:23:36,071 --> 01:23:39,340
He's a guy who is completely
dedicated and, and, and,

1518
01:23:39,341 --> 01:23:43,540
and love with every facet of his company.
And he was just a bad motherfucker.

1519
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:45,400
He had to have know
where they're being made.

1520
01:23:45,401 --> 01:23:47,140
If I know where the fucking
phones are being made,

1521
01:23:47,141 --> 01:23:49,300
he knows where the phones are
being met and this ridiculous,

1522
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:50,470
it's a ridiculous to think he did.

1523
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:53,270
No, no. I know Megan is also,
they fucking claim that the,

1524
01:23:53,271 --> 01:23:55,520
I didn't know there was child labor,
like I didn't know that.

1525
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:56,630
You think they knew it.

1526
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:56,871
Yeah.

1527
01:23:56,871 --> 01:24:01,871
He's also incredibly ambitious and the
reason why the company became so good is

1528
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:05,570
because he was so ruthless and
incredibly ambitious and because of that,

1529
01:24:05,571 --> 01:24:09,730
you know, he was, he was a tough guy
to work for for some people. Some,

1530
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:12,950
some people will tell stories about
him yelling and screaming at people and

1531
01:24:12,951 --> 01:24:13,491
calling a maze.

1532
01:24:13,491 --> 01:24:17,480
But that's because he wanted so much of
himself and the reason why he was such a

1533
01:24:17,481 --> 01:24:20,270
bad mother fucker,
he's had these incredibly high standards.

1534
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:24,140
So then to have all these other people
working under him and some of them who he

1535
01:24:24,141 --> 01:24:28,250
didn't feel like met his vibration,
met his frequency. He would be upset,

1536
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:30,660
at least as far as everything
I've ever read him at him,

1537
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:35,450
he just seems like another tortured,
brilliant person, you know,

1538
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:39,820
who had an incredible gift of vision
for this computer company. You know?

1539
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:43,100
I mean I, I, like I said, all
bad motherfuckers are flawed.

1540
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:46,460
You can't get to be amazing at something.
You know what?

1541
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:49,730
Remember when Clinton got busted pulling
his dick out and we were all like, ah,

1542
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:53,840
there's a part of us that, it was
like, it was a breath of fresh air.

1543
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:57,500
There was a part of Clinton getting caught
getting his dick sucked in the White

1544
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:01,010
House was like, okay, no one's
got it all together. No one does.

1545
01:25:01,011 --> 01:25:02,270
Not even the fucking president.

1546
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:04,490
No. Wait. Do you believe, how
about this? What about this theory?

1547
01:25:04,491 --> 01:25:08,540
I was just saying this to Brian today
in the car ride. What if, what if the,

1548
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:13,580
what if the flaw shows up when you get
there as opposed to it's always there.

1549
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:17,060
Do you think there's an inherent flaw
that shows up with guys like Steve Jobs

1550
01:25:17,061 --> 01:25:20,190
when you become Steve jobs and you walk
into a room and everything you say is

1551
01:25:20,630 --> 01:25:22,900
what's not really a flaw? You
know what I mean? Look, it's,

1552
01:25:22,901 --> 01:25:27,680
it's just a quality and is the quality
of Steve Jobs was that he was just,

1553
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:32,090
his vision was much clear, has
his, will was much stronger. His,

1554
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:36,680
his ideas carried more weight. He just
knew how to put it all together and do it.

1555
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:40,640
He had a, uh, a pure vision of what he
wanted the company to be like. It's not,

1556
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:44,120
there's not, that's not a bad
thing. You know, those, these,

1557
01:25:44,121 --> 01:25:47,990
this obsession is just how
he chose to live his life.

1558
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:52,400
He chose to live his life in
this obsession for excellence
and the, in the end,

1559
01:25:52,401 --> 01:25:56,090
we're all temporary man. In the
end, we just ceased to exist.

1560
01:25:56,091 --> 01:25:58,430
We're here for a short period
of time and then we're gone.

1561
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:00,500
If you want to live it like that,
man,

1562
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:04,100
you want to burn that candle a birth at
both ends and make a big when it reaches

1563
01:26:04,101 --> 01:26:07,880
the middle, why fucking not w what?
What is the difference? Is it,

1564
01:26:07,881 --> 01:26:12,420
is it better to die slowly? What
I don't understand. I don't know.

1565
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:13,191
I don't understand.

1566
01:26:13,191 --> 01:26:17,690
I think a guy like that that comes along
and just [inaudible] and makes this big,

1567
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:22,070
incredible explosion. That's a pretty
fascinating individual, but you know,

1568
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:26,780
I think it's important to look at them
as honestly as possible. You know,

1569
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:27,673
like anybody who died,

1570
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:31,580
it's funny. I'd never heard nothing but
nothing, but absolutely like he's a god.

1571
01:26:31,581 --> 01:26:34,640
He changed everything and to hear their
perspective, I never heard it that way.

1572
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:36,980
I never saw it that way. At least
this comes from a fan, you know?

1573
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:40,730
I don't take you as,
I think you're being more objective.

1574
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:43,640
It was like I talked to my dad about the
Wall Street occupation today and I was

1575
01:26:43,641 --> 01:26:46,160
wondering where his perspective
was going to come to. My Dad's.

1576
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:48,890
My Dad's like you in the
sense that he's like,

1577
01:26:49,410 --> 01:26:52,010
there are things I'll say to
you sometimes when I'll go, oh,

1578
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:54,620
I think Joe Joel believe this.
And then I say it to you and you go,

1579
01:26:54,650 --> 01:26:59,180
are you fucking retarded? And then I
go, but like, but my dad's the same way.

1580
01:26:59,181 --> 01:27:03,050
My Dad's a regular dude who by the way,
she'd be on fucking Alpha brains,

1581
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:06,200
but really? And my dad wants to
do alpha brain so bad. He's like,

1582
01:27:06,201 --> 01:27:09,380
please send me some and I will document
it. And my dad said that to me.

1583
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:13,280
Oh my dad fucking asked about Alpha brains
and was like, watch, assign it to him.

1584
01:27:13,281 --> 01:27:17,360
Brian. I don't even have alpha. Right. And
I ran out like, today's just some dude.

1585
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,290
But um, but yeah, but, but the,

1586
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:22,400
we were talking about the Wall Street
occupation and I was like, I was like,

1587
01:27:22,401 --> 01:27:24,050
I don't,
I don't know where to fucking like,

1588
01:27:24,051 --> 01:27:26,810
I like Jamie Kilstein and I know he's
like at the head of the New York one,

1589
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:29,310
but occupy Wall Street occupy,

1590
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:33,720
I think it's a great idea to scare the
fuck out of those corrupt cons. Yeah.

1591
01:27:33,730 --> 01:27:37,140
But what's going to happen? Thing 90% of
the people are just there for a party.

1592
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,520
They're just there for

1593
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:40,930
a big protest and intimidate.
And Neal Brennan,

1594
01:27:40,931 --> 01:27:45,730
I think it was just did a standup
comedy for occupy la I think.

1595
01:27:45,731 --> 01:27:48,490
And I'm like, now they're having
comedy shows. This is pretty sweet.

1596
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,890
This could be like the next,
you know, let's try it.

1597
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:54,280
Wunderman look last this cause
he, how it starts, you know,

1598
01:27:54,281 --> 01:27:57,580
we're joking around about this now.
Like it's no big deal, but look,

1599
01:27:57,581 --> 01:28:02,020
essentially what keeps a country
together a government and essentially the

1600
01:28:02,021 --> 01:28:06,280
Internet has exposed the fact that our
government is absolutely corrupt and

1601
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:09,970
absolutely incompetent and almost
every single way, and not just corrupt,

1602
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:14,020
but corrupt to the point where they're
starting wars for no fucking reason for

1603
01:28:14,021 --> 01:28:16,510
profit.
And that's pretty well been established.

1604
01:28:16,511 --> 01:28:18,610
And if that's been established
and there is no government,

1605
01:28:18,611 --> 01:28:21,790
we just don't got a bunch of corrupt cont
criminals that are running the fucking

1606
01:28:21,791 --> 01:28:25,780
people into the ground and
they have this fake system,

1607
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:30,840
this fake monetary economic system
that's just fucking built on unfixable

1608
01:28:31,061 --> 01:28:35,150
bullshit. Just a porous fibrous. This.

1609
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:39,070
There's no fixing it. It's, it's
impossible to shore it all up.

1610
01:28:39,071 --> 01:28:41,830
You would have to completely start
from scratch with a whole new thing and

1611
01:28:41,831 --> 01:28:44,920
dissolve all the money, which is
fucking never going to happen. You know,

1612
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:47,230
in a lot of people get mad when I
started talking about economic things.

1613
01:28:47,231 --> 01:28:49,960
They go Joe Rogan, you know
him, know nothing about
economics. And you know what?

1614
01:28:49,961 --> 01:28:52,240
You're absolutely right.
I don't know nothing about economics,

1615
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:57,460
but I do know bullshit. I know
bullshit and lady, it has.

1616
01:28:57,461 --> 01:29:00,820
I've been how, how I've been explaining
as it's been explained to me the,

1617
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:04,570
I know it's bullshit. You know, it's
bullshit too. It's not even based on goal.

1618
01:29:04,571 --> 01:29:09,150
It's based on fucking confidence and
it's run by [inaudible] and if that's the

1619
01:29:09,151 --> 01:29:13,140
case, what is going to happen eventually?
We'll fuck man, this shit my fall apart.

1620
01:29:13,141 --> 01:29:14,580
It really might fall apart.
Well,

1621
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:19,581
we're enjoying right now this calm and
chaos is like us being taken care of by

1622
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,060
our overlords.

1623
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:23,910
US being taken care of in our slave
quarters and we're like dealing with it.

1624
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:27,600
But when we asked to be free,
man, we may, we better be ready.

1625
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:31,050
We better be ready for whatever the fuck
that means. I'm ready. Not even close,

1626
01:29:31,051 --> 01:29:31,380
man.

1627
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:33,930
If would've ordered Wall Street just
walked out and occupy Wall Street and

1628
01:29:33,931 --> 01:29:35,820
they're like, fine, you guys take over.

1629
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:38,040
Yeah. They'd be like, hold
on. Where's the lighter?

1630
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:40,890
How does anybody ever gonna
figure out what money is again?

1631
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,320
I mean obviously they
could never walk away, but,

1632
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:48,420
but how is anybody gonna
to refill in our lifetime?

1633
01:29:48,421 --> 01:29:52,110
It would take so many lifetimes happen,
I think. I mean, I would imagine,

1634
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:55,070
and people who are rich right now are
never going to accept it and people will

1635
01:29:55,071 --> 01:29:57,840
owe people money or never going to accept
that person owes money and now they

1636
01:29:57,841 --> 01:30:01,140
don't anymore. We'll fuck you, man. I gave
you that money. He never paid me back.

1637
01:30:01,141 --> 01:30:03,990
You douchebag. Now once we figured
out a new system of government,

1638
01:30:03,991 --> 01:30:05,850
you better give me my money back.
You know,

1639
01:30:05,851 --> 01:30:08,550
there'll be like old debts that people
are gonna want to bring into play,

1640
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:09,591
but it's,
but you know,

1641
01:30:09,591 --> 01:30:13,640
I understand what they're saying in a
sense that that we tried to apply for a

1642
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:18,470
home loan this year and it was a fucking
nightmare. Like getting a home loan.

1643
01:30:18,650 --> 01:30:19,431
They have this money,

1644
01:30:19,431 --> 01:30:23,690
they can give this money and they
choose not to for ridiculous reasons.

1645
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:28,240
And so fucking like,
I understand that in a lot of it.

1646
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:31,700
I do believe that is the small
businessman that keeps America afloat.

1647
01:30:31,730 --> 01:30:32,750
It's not the corporations.

1648
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:33,601
Well,
you know,

1649
01:30:33,601 --> 01:30:36,810
corporations don't hurt as long as they
pay a good wage and they have union

1650
01:30:36,811 --> 01:30:40,680
labor and they take care of everybody.
But I don't mind the corporations.

1651
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:43,530
Obviously people start going on
about, you know, uh, you know,

1652
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:47,610
unions want too much money and that's why
corporations have to go down to Mexico

1653
01:30:47,611 --> 01:30:49,260
and they forced these jobs overseas.
Like,

1654
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:52,080
or is that really the
only fucking solution?

1655
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:55,230
Is it really the only solution to
get people to work for slave labor?

1656
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:58,560
That's the only silly to get people to
work for some ridiculous wage that you

1657
01:30:58,561 --> 01:31:02,250
would never, I, it doesn't make any sense
to me. We always manufactured things.

1658
01:31:02,251 --> 01:31:04,110
We've got to figure out a way
to manufacture things here.

1659
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:08,220
And does that mean that they cost more
money? I don't. Maybe, I don't know.

1660
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:12,000
I don't know. But figure it out. Don't
use fucking slave labor, man. You know?

1661
01:31:12,001 --> 01:31:15,240
I mean, I'm such a hypocrite because I do
have an iPhone and I do know about this

1662
01:31:15,241 --> 01:31:19,440
Chinese company that makes iPhones,
but really at the end of the day, man,

1663
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:23,060
you're attached to that in
one way and some form you're,

1664
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:25,670
you're connected all the way back,
you know,

1665
01:31:25,870 --> 01:31:28,740
to these people wanting to jump off a
roof to make your fucking cell phone.

1666
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:31,770
Is there a way to make cell phones and
America, Brian, you would know this.

1667
01:31:31,771 --> 01:31:34,260
Can they do that?
Can they just start making an iPhone

1668
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:39,700
be more expensive, more
expensive? $20,000 yeah.

1669
01:31:39,710 --> 01:31:42,930
I mean, these people are beginning
Peyton, nothing. You know what?

1670
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:45,530
Before this company was there,

1671
01:31:45,531 --> 01:31:48,710
they're probably laying on the ground
shivering with snakes coming out of their

1672
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:50,150
asshole. You know, who knows

1673
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:52,730
Casey resign as the companies,
the countries.

1674
01:31:52,731 --> 01:31:55,460
We're all fucked up before it
was before. Yeah. Well you know,

1675
01:31:55,461 --> 01:31:56,510
you've got to put good point there,

1676
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:59,980
but with these South American countries
especially, you know, yeah. These, these

1677
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:00,611
poor Fox,

1678
01:32:00,611 --> 01:32:04,210
they were tearing down their rain forest
and put an oil fields out there and

1679
01:32:04,211 --> 01:32:05,470
ruining their,
their land.

1680
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,710
We went in with our clothes
and our all our shit,

1681
01:32:07,711 --> 01:32:10,290
all that east western Shit and
dumped it on them and said,

1682
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:13,230
this is the way it's going to be like,
you know, I mean look at, look at,

1683
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:17,550
you don't expect to see a guy improve
wearing slacks and a collared shirt and a

1684
01:32:17,551 --> 01:32:21,360
fucking tie. But we said, do that shit.
We cut your re enforce down, we're ready.

1685
01:32:21,510 --> 01:32:23,100
Join the team. And then
we're like, oh by the way,

1686
01:32:23,101 --> 01:32:25,920
it's a nickel a day and
you've got to live in a cage.

1687
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Is it even possible that we could come
up with really efficient robots that do

1688
01:32:33,191 --> 01:32:34,750
most of the work and have the,

1689
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:38,860
the phones and all these fucking things
made in America and pay people an honest

1690
01:32:38,861 --> 01:32:43,861
wage and instead of a phone
raking in $800 you know,

1691
01:32:44,471 --> 01:32:48,040
making a, you know, what if they have
a phone that they sell for 800 bucks,

1692
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:51,000
like what is the profit
for them? You think, uh,

1693
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:56,030
that was a problem for apple book is 70%
70% you think along with manufacturing

1694
01:32:56,891 --> 01:32:59,470
and all that shit. Do you think it's
that high? I think it was pretty high.

1695
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:04,090
Livwell we're, we're totally speculating,
right? And I'm too lazy to Google this,

1696
01:33:04,091 --> 01:33:07,510
but, so let's just for the sake of
this argument, just pretend it's 70%.

1697
01:33:07,511 --> 01:33:10,090
Let's go with what you say.
So they make a 70% province.

1698
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:12,970
I'm inclined to think it's not that high
because I'm inclined to think that with

1699
01:33:12,971 --> 01:33:16,610
production costs and then with advertising
and apple spends a lot of money on

1700
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:19,830
yeah, but an iPhone right
now, they sell retail price,

1701
01:33:19,831 --> 01:33:24,660
like the new iPhone four s I think as
$899 for the cheapest version without a

1702
01:33:24,661 --> 01:33:25,650
contract or something.

1703
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:30,630
It was either seven or nine or nine
or eight 99 $400 for a new upgrade.

1704
01:33:30,631 --> 01:33:32,190
I know that my wife
just looked at it today,

1705
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:36,850
but if you want to buy one
f flat out, well you know,
and then you've got to well,

1706
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:37,693
either way.
Okay,

1707
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:41,090
so do the 70 you think an iPhone
really costs that fucking watch? No.

1708
01:33:41,091 --> 01:33:45,140
You know that shit screen is so cheap.
They have fucking screens. They have what?

1709
01:33:45,141 --> 01:33:46,730
A $20 Indian,

1710
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,450
a laptop right now or an
iPad that just was released.

1711
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:54,300
It's like $36 I think it was to buy.
No, I know what you're talking about.

1712
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:56,050
Those are her children to
learn the alphabet. Yeah,

1713
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:59,300
but the screen size is way
bigger than the iPhone.

1714
01:33:59,301 --> 01:34:02,720
What I'm saying is the parts
they mass manufactured there.

1715
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:05,660
They're definitely using this
cheap labor and stuff like that.

1716
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:09,860
I bet it is something like a 70%
profit, we'll say, but I'm going to,

1717
01:34:09,861 --> 01:34:12,140
I'm going to just jump in for $200 really?

1718
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:15,470
I'm not going to justify it
$100 but let's, we're not,

1719
01:34:15,471 --> 01:34:19,680
I'm not talking about the dudes who had
paid to make this. That's not what my,

1720
01:34:19,681 --> 01:34:23,360
where my money's not going to those
those 20 Asian dudes that put the phone

1721
01:34:23,361 --> 01:34:26,930
together. I'm talking, my money's
going to the guy that made it,

1722
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:29,810
the guy that fucking said,
this is how we do it.

1723
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,840
You can't pay that guy $5 an
hour because he won't do it.

1724
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:37,790
You need that 800 offset of 70% profit
where Steve jobs has got a a dialogue.

1725
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:42,430
Jobs at the end of the day has $7
billion in the bank and his body fails.

1726
01:34:42,431 --> 01:34:43,090
All right.

1727
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:43,241
Yeah,

1728
01:34:43,241 --> 01:34:48,040
but think of all the fuck [inaudible]
think of all the companies that did not

1729
01:34:48,041 --> 01:34:51,520
exist, like the Macintosh or the, the,

1730
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:55,960
the myths Chubashi Hand Gel.
You know, like the one, the,

1731
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:58,160
all the phones that you've
seen that you didn't buy right

1732
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:01,070
there. Just fucking keeping their
head above water. Steve Jobs,

1733
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:03,890
just having to come up with
the sexiest one that all of us,

1734
01:35:03,891 --> 01:35:07,820
despite sometimes our moral beliefs
when I fucking want the phone,

1735
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:09,470
like in a way,

1736
01:35:09,690 --> 01:35:13,160
never thought about anything other than
wanting the phone until I found out

1737
01:35:13,161 --> 01:35:15,500
about the factories.
But even still after the factories,

1738
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:18,320
did you switch over to whatever
the Google one? They tried it,

1739
01:35:18,321 --> 01:35:20,960
but it was 10 and so that, that's
my point. That's my point. You Go,

1740
01:35:20,961 --> 01:35:23,720
one's probably made the same way.
Make them in other countries.

1741
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:26,750
They make them in Mexico. I'm not
saying yeah, but my, my, my point is,

1742
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:29,810
it's not that he deserves his 7 billion,

1743
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:34,610
but the point is he did do a magic trick.
They got us all to fucking,

1744
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:37,250
even despite knowing what we
know about how they're made,

1745
01:35:37,251 --> 01:35:39,830
we went still fucking with the
phone. Here's the question. It,

1746
01:35:39,831 --> 01:35:44,300
would it be possible to do the exact same
thing but do it in America and instead

1747
01:35:44,301 --> 01:35:48,140
of him making $7 billion,
he makes four. How's that?

1748
01:35:48,170 --> 01:35:51,470
Is that possible that you could have done
it exactly the same way and everybody

1749
01:35:51,471 --> 01:35:56,210
makes a shitload of money but you, you
spread it around more. Is that possible?

1750
01:35:56,430 --> 01:35:59,630
But it is possible for
a Steve jobs to do it,

1751
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:03,440
but it's not possible for the guy that
did the Google phone because the guy that

1752
01:36:03,441 --> 01:36:07,220
did the Google phone would not only be
broke but everyone would be fucking broke.

1753
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,190
Like you know you got, it's like,
so you're saying once it becomes,

1754
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:14,120
he's had some things out there on
the market, he's hedging his bets.

1755
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:17,450
The guy that made the Google phone
probably just made a nice living,

1756
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:20,840
didn't make the 7 billion. Well, you
know, it's a, first of all it's Google.

1757
01:36:20,870 --> 01:36:24,620
You know, they have, they have their own
phone operating system and they, you know,

1758
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,240
I mean it's not like a guy. I know. I
know, but I know, but I'm trying to,

1759
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:32,150
I'm trying to a broad stroke it or like
a whatever the other fucking phones are

1760
01:36:32,151 --> 01:36:36,020
out there. The smartphone. So you're
saying they can't make them in America.

1761
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:41,030
They couldn't make them at
a more reasonable profit in
America. Uh, if they did,

1762
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:45,410
if they had and they said, okay,
well instead of best case scenario,

1763
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:49,250
instead of us being up mass hit like
the iPhone and we all walk away with 7

1764
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:52,820
billion, we're willing to walk away with 5
million each. Right. Well, when it isn't,

1765
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:56,150
when he's just average the way it was,
they were all lost their asses.

1766
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:58,580
They would have all look like the deficit,

1767
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:01,850
the deficit we're looking at there
is totally different. In my opinion.

1768
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,640
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about Joe. I'm pretty fucked up right now.

1769
01:37:04,641 --> 01:37:07,940
Okay. But I'm saying, I'm just
saying like you're losing me. No,

1770
01:37:07,941 --> 01:37:09,050
I'm saying I see what you're saying,

1771
01:37:09,051 --> 01:37:13,040
but I don't think that they're
losing venture making droid phones,

1772
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:15,470
especially these really bad ass
ones. They may like the, you know,

1773
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:19,520
the HTC evo is and the droid bionics,
the Motorola bionic, whatever.

1774
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:22,610
I don't want that shit. What
do you mean? I don't want that.

1775
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:26,510
I want the iPhone cause I saw a dude
have one on a plane one time and I went,

1776
01:37:26,511 --> 01:37:30,770
I went that shit.
So whatever that thing you did created is,

1777
01:37:30,771 --> 01:37:35,330
makes me want it that in a weird way,
you earn your 7 billion. Oh yeah, yeah.

1778
01:37:35,331 --> 01:37:39,130
I mean in a weird way. Yeah. You know,
look, he created a cult, you know,

1779
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:43,010
the cult of Mac and I'm a, I'm a user, you
know what I mean? So like I said, I'm a,

1780
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:46,100
I'm a huge hypocrite. I thought, I think
they have the best operating system.

1781
01:37:46,101 --> 01:37:49,490
I'd love it. It doesn't crash. I
never get viruses. I have no issues.

1782
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,140
It's a little more expensive.
Yes it is.

1783
01:37:51,141 --> 01:37:53,380
You're writing jobs didn't
die from the virus. Joe.

1784
01:37:56,830 --> 01:37:57,840
I want you to go home.

1785
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:03,070
You listen to spot weird energy. I agree
with what you're saying. I, anyway,

1786
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:05,470
side note. Uh, I just think that,

1787
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:09,550
I think that they probably weren't set
up originally to try to make 7 billion.

1788
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:12,880
They were best case and I
was like a million each and
then Josh blew the fuck up.

1789
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:15,270
And you're right when that guy,

1790
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:18,580
there's a lot of stories about him doing
business. It's totally stupid. Well,

1791
01:38:18,650 --> 01:38:21,130
but once you get to that place where
you're the dude that made the sexy thing

1792
01:38:21,131 --> 01:38:24,880
that everyone wants and you're the God
that created all this fucking microcosm

1793
01:38:24,881 --> 01:38:27,940
of belief,
of cult of personality about you,

1794
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:30,280
you start believing what the fuck
you feel and you go, fuck it.

1795
01:38:30,281 --> 01:38:31,540
I'm indestructible and you're right.

1796
01:38:31,541 --> 01:38:35,110
I do believe that it's Karmic energy
that snapped back on him from all the

1797
01:38:35,111 --> 01:38:36,490
negative shit he put out there.
But I didn't,

1798
01:38:36,530 --> 01:38:39,260
well, I'm not saying that. I don't
think that's why he got sick. You know?

1799
01:38:39,261 --> 01:38:42,500
I think if, if anything, you probably got
sick cause he works too much. You know,

1800
01:38:42,501 --> 01:38:45,620
I think when you and your that type
of person that can't turn it off, man,

1801
01:38:45,621 --> 01:38:48,020
that's an incredible amount
of strain in your system,

1802
01:38:48,021 --> 01:38:50,510
your red line in your system all day,
man.

1803
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:55,490
When you're like a super intense
success oriented, goal oriented,

1804
01:38:55,491 --> 01:38:58,250
victory oriented, sort of a
guy like Steve jobs. I mean,

1805
01:38:58,251 --> 01:39:00,560
he wasn't just a visionary man.
He was like a cult leader.

1806
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:05,420
He created a cult and didn't
even ask anybody to join
the cult. They just joined,

1807
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:06,530
but he just joined it,

1808
01:39:06,531 --> 01:39:10,190
followed it everywhere and I would have
conversations with people at work when I

1809
01:39:10,191 --> 01:39:12,380
was on news radio. This
is, I realized it would,

1810
01:39:12,381 --> 01:39:16,520
they would be like super excited about
Apple's new announcements and the attack.

1811
01:39:16,521 --> 01:39:19,520
Talk to you about the new
announcement here. Apple's
new announcement. Yeah. Yeah.

1812
01:39:19,521 --> 01:39:22,550
They're working on the Osx right now
and then they get now it's crazy.

1813
01:39:22,551 --> 01:39:25,580
It's like that now for real. It's
like Hari Krishna Shit, you know?

1814
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:28,380
I mean, think of a guy that's
basically a stand at a podium and go,

1815
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:29,910
everyone do me a favor right now.

1816
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:32,820
Throw away your fucking phones
and everyone just going,

1817
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,330
I want the next thing he's got.
That's what we all do. Right.

1818
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:37,470
He just stood up there and
like fucking take the purple

1819
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:41,440
lemonade or whatever. I think of what it
is though is a lot for me. Creativity.

1820
01:39:41,441 --> 01:39:45,040
I've never in my life ever been able to
take what I'm thinking in my head and

1821
01:39:45,041 --> 01:39:48,820
put it out exactly how I want to
put it out. He created a tool.

1822
01:39:48,821 --> 01:39:51,220
He created a hammer,
he created a brush.

1823
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:54,970
He created something completely different
and then sometimes I think people look

1824
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,930
at what he's done is create
something that never existed before,

1825
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:03,280
which was taking what I'm thinking in my
head and putting it into a format that

1826
01:40:03,281 --> 01:40:05,230
I could show you what I'm thinking.
You know,

1827
01:40:05,231 --> 01:40:09,010
like create creativity has
never been done before.

1828
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,600
Since I've got an apple,

1829
01:40:10,990 --> 01:40:15,640
you know like using like final cut pro
and all the programs that he's given me,

1830
01:40:15,730 --> 01:40:18,800
I'm now really feeling like,
like,

1831
01:40:18,830 --> 01:40:21,010
like it's a tool like a hammer.
Wait,

1832
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:25,240
are you understanding this? Because
I can sort it, I can translate.

1833
01:40:25,810 --> 01:40:29,080
I was saying that it helps them create,
well, I mean, think of Brian Brian Base.

1834
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:30,430
Think of Brian,
you know,

1835
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:34,600
10 years ago before apple was around the
jawline dude sitting on a guy sitting

1836
01:40:34,601 --> 01:40:36,490
in a room with a bunch of ideas
that he wanted to come out.

1837
01:40:36,491 --> 01:40:41,050
He wanted to do when I'm using two VCRs
to try to make a movie where now I'm

1838
01:40:41,051 --> 01:40:46,051
fucking filming on an iPhone doing HD
and Adl and arguably you are a much more

1839
01:40:47,681 --> 01:40:50,890
successful human being today than
you were when pcs were around.

1840
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:54,220
Your ideas can happen quicker, faster
and you can get them to more people.

1841
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:58,090
Think of the voice as
interesting as it had been today,

1842
01:40:58,150 --> 01:41:01,360
how many people has gotten too just
because of apples and Max. I mean that's,

1843
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:03,120
I see what you're saying.
I mean it would've,

1844
01:41:03,130 --> 01:41:05,710
we would've gotten most of it done
with windows. I mean, I don't, I don't,

1845
01:41:05,711 --> 01:41:08,910
I disagree. Yeah. I mean, I've used
pampers before and it like, really?

1846
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:13,270
I could get my, my, my emotions out
there, but it's not the same as like,

1847
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:15,880
if you look at it not be the same,
might not be as good. But Dude,

1848
01:41:15,990 --> 01:41:19,420
there's a lot of people who edited videos
and did a great job and they edited

1849
01:41:19,421 --> 01:41:24,190
them on pcs. You know,
there's a lot of Photoshop PC.

1850
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:26,600
It's what I'm saying, PC,
when you're talking to him,

1851
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:29,380
all the jobs created the first PC.
Yeah.

1852
01:41:29,381 --> 01:41:34,060
But he didn't create the Windows operating
system and Xerox have computers put

1853
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:34,973
the PC.

1854
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:40,150
Xerox already have the graphic
user interface before apple did.

1855
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:42,780
I'm pretty sure they did. I'm not
sure they got a good idea from zero.

1856
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:46,420
You ever heard of a xerox personal
computer in your life? Do I have it?

1857
01:41:46,421 --> 01:41:48,610
But they could have existed. You know
what I'm saying? I mean, it's like,

1858
01:41:48,611 --> 01:41:51,460
and we know that windows did and we know
that a bunch of different people make

1859
01:41:51,461 --> 01:41:54,640
windows computers. I think computers
would exist in some form no matter what.

1860
01:41:54,850 --> 01:41:57,190
I think once the technology
was introduced into the world,

1861
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:00,850
it's just a natural chain of progression
that people automatically start

1862
01:42:00,851 --> 01:42:03,430
incorporating into their lives and
then it becomes better and better.

1863
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:05,660
What apple was was the best one,
right,

1864
01:42:05,890 --> 01:42:08,800
but it's not like the computer
wouldn't exist if it wasn't for apple.

1865
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,870
What apple was was the best,
and by the way,

1866
01:42:10,871 --> 01:42:14,380
Wazniak was the technical genius
behind that. It wasn't even Steve Jobs.

1867
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:18,760
It would have existed, man. Computers
would have existed, but no doubt about it.

1868
01:42:18,761 --> 01:42:23,200
Apple does it the best and they do it.
The sexiest you're hitting on Steve Jobs,

1869
01:42:23,201 --> 01:42:26,710
man does is on a Mac. This is a Mac to
your left. You're going to Mac over there.

1870
01:42:26,711 --> 01:42:28,880
I bought all these bitches. I
know. That's what I'm saying.

1871
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:31,900
Why you hating on Steve
Jobs not hating on him.

1872
01:42:31,901 --> 01:42:36,040
I'm just trying to get the Steve jobs
loving and you're like, what am I talking?

1873
01:42:36,041 --> 01:42:39,550
All I said was that he's a ruthless
dude and that all bad motherfuckers have

1874
01:42:39,551 --> 01:42:43,360
their flaws and you got to look at him
for who he really is. Not very isolated.

1875
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:49,630
Did you say I sad. I'm so, did you say
I'm not very, I said, that's hilarious.

1876
01:42:49,631 --> 01:42:53,060
Give me some hilarious. I said,

1877
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:57,790
that might be, then let's the
line of the night, you know, like,

1878
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:01,360
I can't wait to see in like four or
five years when Steve Jobs plans,

1879
01:43:01,361 --> 01:43:04,870
I've run out. Like I bet there's a couple
of that they just threw in there like,

1880
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:08,860
oh, he didn't really perfect this
idea yet. Like smelly computer.

1881
01:43:08,861 --> 01:43:11,740
Now I don't want to see like just taking
all the ideas that you put down on

1882
01:43:11,741 --> 01:43:14,950
paper and they're like, guys, it's
a helicopter. I helicopter. Yeah,

1883
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:17,500
we're all going to have them
one day. So wait, can I, can I,

1884
01:43:17,501 --> 01:43:20,830
is this possible that I just, just with
the energy that we're having today,

1885
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:23,800
can I ask how you guys met?
Oh yeah. I met Brian Online.

1886
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:28,240
Brian was on my message board. Yeah.
Well, Brian was posting these videos.

1887
01:43:28,241 --> 01:43:31,180
There were super creative.
That's good. Brian's best. Dot.

1888
01:43:31,390 --> 01:43:35,320
He's a wizard video editor. I
mean, even if it wasn't a room,

1889
01:43:35,321 --> 01:43:38,660
I would say for real. He's
a weird guy. You know,

1890
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:42,290
obviously you can tell he's a
very silly, silly man. He's,

1891
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,730
but because of that,

1892
01:43:45,731 --> 01:43:50,350
he has a sensibility when it comes to
video editing that I've never seen before.

1893
01:43:50,370 --> 01:43:52,490
It's, it's so, and so,

1894
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:55,790
uh, his, his sense of humor is so his,

1895
01:43:55,791 --> 01:43:59,030
and you're fucking great at a man.
You really need to make more videos,

1896
01:43:59,031 --> 01:44:02,390
not just like little like edit videos
because they're fucking amazing man.

1897
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:07,040
And so I met him, he was doing these
videos just for a goof and I was,

1898
01:44:07,041 --> 01:44:11,180
I met him at one of my shows and he was
on my, my message board all the time.

1899
01:44:11,181 --> 01:44:12,530
And I said, what do you do
for a living man? He said,

1900
01:44:12,531 --> 01:44:16,070
he works for gateway computers and like,
you want to work for me? And he's like,

1901
01:44:16,071 --> 01:44:19,250
yeah, I'm like, come on out
to come fucking California.
Which is curious. Yeah.

1902
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:23,660
So he came out to California and that's
back in the comedy store days where, uh,

1903
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:27,050
Brian used to film crazy
people coming up to us.

1904
01:44:27,051 --> 01:44:29,750
It was always like one fucking
crazy retard after another.

1905
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:34,430
Brian would take these videos and make
these hilarious little things out of them,

1906
01:44:34,431 --> 01:44:37,550
little clips. And, um,
that's how we became friends.

1907
01:44:38,110 --> 01:44:39,670
So interesting.
I always wondered about that.

1908
01:44:39,671 --> 01:44:43,840
I thought I was having a
much more romantic story.
You never is the I love good.

1909
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:45,040
Hey,
by the way,

1910
01:44:45,041 --> 01:44:49,030
I'm still mad at people
hating on restaurants that
are like chain restaurants.

1911
01:44:49,031 --> 01:44:53,530
Like, like I went to the olive garden
last night and had the best meal ever.

1912
01:44:53,531 --> 01:44:55,830
Another fucking impromptu all garden.

1913
01:44:56,490 --> 01:45:01,330
Here's what [inaudible] going to go to.
And by the way,

1914
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:03,730
check this out.
Worst segway guy.

1915
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:07,510
There's a Sushi place in studio city
that has this famous Sushi thing called,

1916
01:45:07,511 --> 01:45:09,850
I think it's called Sardo's or
something. No, it's not sorry guys.

1917
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,780
But some other place,
Katina or something Qatar.

1918
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:16,720
And they had this like all you
can eat Sushi thing for $26 right?

1919
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:19,360
So my girlfriend's like, oh, I went
to Sushi and I'm like, all right,

1920
01:45:19,361 --> 01:45:21,940
let's get Sushi. So we sit down
and then we were like, all right,

1921
01:45:21,941 --> 01:45:24,880
we'll have the all you can eat Sushi
do. And so we ordered three, two, she's,

1922
01:45:24,881 --> 01:45:29,320
and they give you like the mungus
thing of Sushi. So it's not like,

1923
01:45:29,321 --> 01:45:34,180
like six roles. It's like 12 rolls each.
So I'm like, Oh shit, this better be good.

1924
01:45:34,181 --> 01:45:38,900
It's all rice and Raul, mushy fish. So in
Beta, same thing right now. Keep going.

1925
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:41,910
Fuck does this have to do a little,
we were talking so,

1926
01:45:41,911 --> 01:45:46,030
so we start eating it and then we're like,
this is disgusting.

1927
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:49,200
And the woman comes over and I'm like,
Hey, this is gross. And I'm like, sorry,

1928
01:45:49,201 --> 01:45:54,080
you have to eat at least a 75% and
I'm like, what? 75 Pr. Alright.

1929
01:45:54,190 --> 01:45:57,370
And my baby, I was like, I'll eat it,
I'll eat it and we'll get something else.

1930
01:45:57,371 --> 01:45:58,450
It will be better than,
than this shit.

1931
01:45:58,570 --> 01:46:01,450
So I ate all of it and then I
feel like I'm gonna Puke. Right?

1932
01:46:01,451 --> 01:46:03,370
Like it's the worst Sushi ever.

1933
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,950
This is the one that you can tell
how ridiculous Brian Stories are.

1934
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:10,720
How many likes there are in
there. Yes. And so like, and
she's like, and he's like,

1935
01:46:10,721 --> 01:46:15,370
and I'm like, oh my God.
Like, so my girlfriend's like,
I feel sick. Can we stop?

1936
01:46:15,371 --> 01:46:16,210
Can we,
can you just,

1937
01:46:16,211 --> 01:46:19,810
can we pretend we're doing the directorial
element element on this? So wait,

1938
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,970
my favorite part is when
the lady says to him,

1939
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:26,900
you have to eat 75% of it to even
have this conversation. He goes,

1940
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:29,880
don't worry. I got this. I'm going
to be 75% of the Sushi and I,

1941
01:46:29,990 --> 01:46:32,610
I ate the whole thing because I was
just trying to prove a point. Right?

1942
01:46:32,980 --> 01:46:36,040
Like this is bullshit that you're
forcing me to eat this horrible Sushi.

1943
01:46:36,330 --> 01:46:39,070
Probably have to get rid of it
for it. Right, right. I know.

1944
01:46:39,071 --> 01:46:39,940
That's what I'm thinking.

1945
01:46:39,941 --> 01:46:42,040
I'm thinking the same thing
like that and then my genius.

1946
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:44,620
I'm glad you thought of the same thing.
I told the waitress,

1947
01:46:44,621 --> 01:46:46,690
the waiter to come back and I'm
like, look, my girlfriend feels sick.

1948
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:50,070
We don't even want to try for any
more Sushi because this is awful.

1949
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:55,250
I'm sorry. You have to eat it. You know
what's the point of the story, man?

1950
01:46:55,550 --> 01:46:58,710
Was there a point? Yeah, because I went
to the olive garden and guess what?

1951
01:46:58,770 --> 01:47:01,140
None of that shit ever
happens at the off guard.

1952
01:47:01,141 --> 01:47:04,380
I'm not sitting there disappointed.
I'm like, no, this salad is awesome.

1953
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:07,530
These breadsticks are awesome.
This is awesome. This is awesome.

1954
01:47:07,531 --> 01:47:11,040
This is often the point of this whole
side track is that all of Golf Garden,

1955
01:47:11,041 --> 01:47:16,041
all you can eat pasta and everything
costs me $40 that shitty ass Sushi,

1956
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:19,110
51 bucks.
Who would want to listen to this?

1957
01:47:21,170 --> 01:47:24,840
You realize that this is a podcast who
the slug would want to listen to you talk

1958
01:47:24,841 --> 01:47:29,510
about how angry no, Brian, I'm being
honest with you. This is, this is,

1959
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:33,450
this is a product. This podcast has
a product that I take very seriously.

1960
01:47:33,451 --> 01:47:36,600
I really love doing it and
if you actually, and people
enjoyed it very much. No,

1961
01:47:36,601 --> 01:47:38,520
I did not ask you.
You went off on a wild,

1962
01:47:38,521 --> 01:47:43,521
crazy chase to tell me that there's places
that are bad restaurants in the olive

1963
01:47:43,531 --> 01:47:45,690
garden always gives a quality.
You know what I'm thinking?

1964
01:47:45,691 --> 01:47:48,900
It's like people that get that bash
on franchise record about that.

1965
01:47:48,901 --> 01:47:51,330
Forget about that. What I want
to know is, are you, you know,

1966
01:47:51,331 --> 01:47:54,420
people except perfected this shit.
People are listening to this,

1967
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:57,130
entertaining in that. No, definitely.

1968
01:47:57,131 --> 01:48:00,750
So when people say mom and pop restaurants
are the only way to go. Like I this,

1969
01:48:00,751 --> 01:48:03,330
this restaurant is good because
it's owned by small family.

1970
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:06,600
There's need to go there and you just
have worst horrible, shitty ass. Right.

1971
01:48:06,601 --> 01:48:10,850
Bryce service is a dumb conversation
because not every mom and pop restaurants

1972
01:48:10,851 --> 01:48:15,150
sucks. No, but the majority
of them are. That's not true.

1973
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:19,170
That is true restaurants Brian.
That is not true.

1974
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:22,300
That's why they have kitchen nightmares
cause all these places can't make money.

1975
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:24,690
So there's like this,

1976
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:28,320
they're more likely to go under because
the bad restaurants and occupy Wall

1977
01:48:28,321 --> 01:48:30,180
Street. Okay. I'm going to
be judge Judy right now.

1978
01:48:30,181 --> 01:48:33,360
You are right on the part of what you
said and you were writing on the part of

1979
01:48:33,361 --> 01:48:36,030
what you said your role in the last part.
What my mamma's shit.

1980
01:48:36,031 --> 01:48:40,080
Pop shops are good. I know. No, I'm
not saying they're not. No, no, no, no.

1981
01:48:40,081 --> 01:48:41,150
You're wrong.
You're wrong.

1982
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:43,500
And the fact that no one wants
to hear what you just told us,

1983
01:48:43,501 --> 01:48:47,310
however shows chose all on the fact
that what it is then turned interesting

1984
01:48:47,311 --> 01:48:51,930
cause it was so bad because it was so bad.
So bad in a genius way.

1985
01:48:51,931 --> 01:48:55,080
Cause I'm sitting here laughing,
going, I can't believe that we're,

1986
01:48:55,620 --> 01:48:59,620
I think it's important to remind everybody
that someone's listening. This is,

1987
01:48:59,630 --> 01:49:02,160
ours is a program.
This is entertainment program,

1988
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:05,700
and just get apologetic for edit stories.
It doesn't go to stores.

1989
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:09,280
I apologize for talking.
Not Describe.

1990
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:14,550
Aspire to a higher level, sir.
No, you guys are, I'm laughing.

1991
01:49:14,551 --> 01:49:18,840
I'm having a good time. This isn't
even remotely uncomfortable. Joe,

1992
01:49:18,841 --> 01:49:22,510
why are you so uncomfortable right now?
Dude, you're being weird. Despite that,

1993
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:25,200
I can feel angry right
now and I'm not you.

1994
01:49:25,201 --> 01:49:29,280
You've been awkward this entire podcast.
I'm always awkward, every podcast,

1995
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:31,980
but this is extra. No,
it's not. It's just,

1996
01:49:31,981 --> 01:49:35,550
it's on the same as drinking beers
with Bert Kreischer. It's about right.

1997
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:37,060
I'll stop drinking.
Guys.

1998
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:41,670
I may switch to energy drink because
I feel bad now because I'm making Joe

1999
01:49:41,670 --> 01:49:44,610
Awkward. Well, Brian, you mean
you, are you happy with that story?

2000
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:48,040
How that all turned out?
Well, obviously, obviously

2001
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:51,430
it was a little bit more intense
than I thought it was going to be.

2002
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:56,110
A talking about how I like going to a
franchise restaurants because they do it

2003
01:49:56,111 --> 01:49:58,780
right and they've figured it out.
They get service,

2004
01:49:58,781 --> 01:50:01,810
good food compared to go
into getting food poisoning.

2005
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:07,080
The be honest as a person who
likes listening to podcasts
as a person who enjoys

2006
01:50:08,321 --> 01:50:11,290
quality conversation, where you
happy with that? How'd that turn out?

2007
01:50:12,130 --> 01:50:13,300
Not your reaction,

2008
01:50:13,301 --> 01:50:18,250
but I was happy at how my story with the
story with the end result of the story

2009
01:50:18,530 --> 01:50:21,650
just answered.
I apologize for bringing up the guys.

2010
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:24,820
Are you happy with how the end
result of the no, definitely not.

2011
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:27,880
I'm not having outlets ending right now.

2012
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:30,400
I did not mean to to turn
into whatever happened.

2013
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:32,330
No.
And Are you happy with it as a product?

2014
01:50:32,331 --> 01:50:35,930
Like it was a piece of art as
a conversation, wouldn't you?

2015
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:39,860
Wouldn't you say that in retrospect
it wasn't that entertaining?

2016
01:50:39,861 --> 01:50:42,150
I think you're taking it
different than what I, I'm just,

2017
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:44,270
I'm just trying to find out your,
the way you approach it,

2018
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,300
the way you approach telling a
story. If I, if I'm telling a story,

2019
01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:50,030
I want to make sure that it's entertaining
and if I think it's not going to be

2020
01:50:50,031 --> 01:50:52,730
entertaining, I don't want to tell it.
I think that's what you have to do.

2021
01:50:52,731 --> 01:50:55,880
And if I tell a story in it and we all
have, and it's not that entertaining,

2022
01:50:55,970 --> 01:50:56,930
I feel uncomfortable.

2023
01:50:57,350 --> 01:51:00,380
And you don't seem to feel that when
you tell a story and it doesn't work out

2024
01:51:00,381 --> 01:51:02,090
that good,
it doesn't seem to bother you at all.

2025
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:08,890
Okay. Sorry. Does that
make sense? Yeah, but,

2026
01:51:09,130 --> 01:51:14,040
but, but I'll argue once
again to be the, okay.

2027
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:17,910
Um, I will say that I think, and
I don't mean no offense by this,

2028
01:51:17,911 --> 01:51:21,520
but I think me and you have
a higher threshold, like a,

2029
01:51:21,521 --> 01:51:24,480
a titer threshold of when our
stories aren't doing well,

2030
01:51:24,481 --> 01:51:28,890
where we get more uncomfortable
as a performer. But he's been not,

2031
01:51:28,891 --> 01:51:29,760
it hasn't been doing it.
What,

2032
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:34,590
27 years and 15 years he's
been doing it a hand like six.

2033
01:51:34,710 --> 01:51:38,910
So I think our threshold,
like when I bomb, I know what
it feels like, like that.

2034
01:51:39,150 --> 01:51:42,480
Like, I think, I think he's hoping it's,
I can't believe we're talking about this,

2035
01:51:42,481 --> 01:51:43,314
but he'll be,
I think

2036
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:44,870
I thought we were just
off. No, no, no, no.

2037
01:51:44,871 --> 01:51:47,900
I think I didn't know
different directions.

2038
01:51:49,650 --> 01:51:52,980
Change the conversation in the middle
of this conversation went to this weird

2039
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,530
olive garden thing and you
bring up the olive garden.

2040
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:58,740
Are you against the other guy? Because
I'm not getting paid by the olive garden.

2041
01:51:58,741 --> 01:51:59,990
Is that what you think I'm talking about?

2042
01:51:59,991 --> 01:52:04,440
Like I have no connection to the
gardening and this just start dating.

2043
01:52:04,610 --> 01:52:08,240
I am sorry for bringing up the olive
garden. I will change it to Applebee's.

2044
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:12,260
I'll tell you what. Or if you guys want,
I'll tell you about the time I did.

2045
01:52:12,261 --> 01:52:15,130
The girl that had cerebral palsy.
What's that like? I don't know.

2046
01:52:15,131 --> 01:52:17,020
We'll just see if that goes somewhere.
I don't know. I'm not certain,

2047
01:52:17,021 --> 01:52:21,650
but I didn't know stream. I didn't know
pretty extreme. Patrice O'Neal was, uh,

2048
01:52:22,090 --> 01:52:24,760
was like, it's fucking obvious. I
don't know how you didn't see it. Whoa.

2049
01:52:24,970 --> 01:52:28,120
But I didn't see it cause I was drinking
so much around her that were when you

2050
01:52:28,121 --> 01:52:30,670
met her? Yeah, we were on a plane. Whoa.

2051
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:35,700
Flying from La to New York and I beautiful
girl sitting next to me and I just

2052
01:52:35,951 --> 01:52:36,784
automatically,

2053
01:52:36,970 --> 01:52:39,820
whatever thoughts you're going to have
her overwhelmed by how hot she is.

2054
01:52:40,030 --> 01:52:40,863
She was like,
Angela,

2055
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:45,950
Angelina Jolie meets a Sarah Michelle
Gellar really smoking hot. And so, um,

2056
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:49,460
so I sat down next to her and she just,
we just hit it off. It was so great,

2057
01:52:49,461 --> 01:52:50,840
but we were sitting next to
each other the whole time.

2058
01:52:50,841 --> 01:52:52,760
We didn't get up and go anywhere.
So I didn't see her walk.

2059
01:52:53,420 --> 01:52:56,630
And then we went out the next night
in New York on a date with a bunch of

2060
01:52:56,631 --> 01:53:01,160
friends, had a great time, Bam, like
so awesome. And then on the third day,

2061
01:53:01,161 --> 01:53:02,690
my buddy who pulled me aside,
he was like,

2062
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:06,650
you might want to go out with her and
the sunlight and like check her out.

2063
01:53:07,310 --> 01:53:10,460
I was like, why? He was like, I think
something's wrong with the chick was like,

2064
01:53:10,461 --> 01:53:13,970
what do you mean? I didn't notice a thing.
I didn't notice a thing wrong with her.

2065
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:16,580
I thought she was perfect and then
I go out with her in the sunlight.

2066
01:53:16,581 --> 01:53:18,410
It took her onto like a brunch.
I met her at her house.

2067
01:53:18,411 --> 01:53:22,100
She was a trust fund kid too,
which made it even harder.

2068
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:24,860
But she was wearing
sneakers and I was like,

2069
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:28,940
that's an odd choice for
a brunch is track shoes,

2070
01:53:28,941 --> 01:53:33,170
like sneakers with a sun dress. And then
I saw her lip and I was like, oh fuck,

2071
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:35,150
something's going on.
And then we ate dinner.

2072
01:53:35,151 --> 01:53:37,600
She only used or like left
hand or her right hand one,

2073
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:41,090
one hand the whole time to do
everything with. And I was like, fuck,

2074
01:53:41,091 --> 01:53:42,680
she's got several Paul.
Like I didn't know.

2075
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:45,170
But then I found out and then you
become the guy that you're like,

2076
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:50,350
will I date the girl with cerebral palsy
and or will I be the guy that goes,

2077
01:53:50,511 --> 01:53:53,210
fuck you. I don't want you to die soul.
I don't want that hassle of my life.

2078
01:53:53,690 --> 01:53:56,430
And I was like, fuck it.
I'm going to date her.

2079
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:59,840
I liked her when I didn't think
she had cerebral palsy and then,

2080
01:53:59,841 --> 01:54:01,670
and now I know what, I'm not going
to fucking throw her to the wolves.

2081
01:54:01,670 --> 01:54:06,140
And so I started dating her and then
she went to Scotland with me and Patrice

2082
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:10,760
and rich Vos and fucking, she showed
how crazy she was. She was a nightmare.

2083
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:13,010
But trees was the first theater.
He's like, I don't like your bitch.

2084
01:54:13,070 --> 01:54:16,670
Crazy end cerebral palsy. Really crazy.
I think the, yeah, I think, you know,

2085
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:19,760
I'm sure it's her history that's
got to creep in on her, you know,

2086
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:22,400
having a disability.
But she was a fucking nightmare.

2087
01:54:22,401 --> 01:54:26,150
Like one night she was standing at the
foot of my bed naked and screaming at me

2088
01:54:26,151 --> 01:54:28,880
going, you won't fuck me. Fuck me.

2089
01:54:28,881 --> 01:54:31,910
You and Patrice walked like literally
walk stuck his head and he was like,

2090
01:54:32,030 --> 01:54:34,850
all right and shut the
door. It was, she was crazy.

2091
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:38,450
We were in a a house in Scotland doing a,

2092
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:43,370
the Edinburgh fringe festival and
then she was a nightmare fucking,

2093
01:54:43,371 --> 01:54:44,960
but my biggest thing was like,
man,

2094
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:48,000
how much it would drunk do you have to
be to not notice the chick you're dating

2095
01:54:48,001 --> 01:54:48,800
has cerebral palsy?

2096
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:53,120
Like I guess if you were totally trashed
and you just try and look at the bright

2097
01:54:53,121 --> 01:54:55,820
side of things. So yeah. But you know,
your first few days with a check, he,

2098
01:54:55,821 --> 01:54:58,690
it's out. How many dates did you
have before you took her away to,

2099
01:54:58,890 --> 01:55:01,100
to until I realized she had
cerebral palsy. Two or three.

2100
01:55:02,150 --> 01:55:06,410
It took you to hold dates before you
realized, oh yeah, like two whole days.

2101
01:55:06,411 --> 01:55:08,630
It's like hanging out and
walking around with her. Wow.

2102
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:11,840
You know what it is something that would
even fucking weirder about it is that

2103
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:15,110
she was a massive fan of guns and roses.
And then when,

2104
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:18,380
when I was doing the act
show with Gary Valentine, um,

2105
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:23,830
we ended up interviewing slash from guns
and roses and so slash showed up at,

2106
01:55:24,290 --> 01:55:26,900
and I was like, man, this chick, I can't
remember her name right now, but I go,

2107
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:28,570
this chick love slash my color.

2108
01:55:28,610 --> 01:55:31,430
I had a number on my cell phone and
call her and I said, just so you know,

2109
01:55:31,431 --> 01:55:34,580
she lived in La. I go slashes in my,
in my green room right now, drinking,

2110
01:55:34,910 --> 01:55:39,260
if you want to meet slash
I've got to drive on for you
over at the gate. Come on.

2111
01:55:39,290 --> 01:55:40,200
And he's going to be here for awhile.

2112
01:55:40,220 --> 01:55:43,080
We haven't even started taping and he's
not flying out until 10 and he wants to

2113
01:55:43,081 --> 01:55:47,790
stay in my room drinking. So she showed
up to the taping, she sits in the,

2114
01:55:47,791 --> 01:55:50,250
in the back and watches me do
the interview with him and,

2115
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:54,300
and it was great interview and then
we get done. And I said to her,

2116
01:55:54,301 --> 01:55:56,130
go to my green. And I told one of
the guys, figured in my green room,

2117
01:55:56,220 --> 01:55:59,080
so me and slash or one of the green
room with her, I go, I go, listen.

2118
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:02,220
And slash just so you know,
this chick I dated, um,

2119
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:04,740
is a big fans of guns [inaudible]
roses and she just wants to meet you.

2120
01:56:04,741 --> 01:56:07,140
And they talk and man,

2121
01:56:07,141 --> 01:56:10,410
and she is hottest fucking Shit and
slashing are pretty hammered it for like

2122
01:56:10,590 --> 01:56:11,423
eight in the morning.

2123
01:56:11,670 --> 01:56:15,510
And then she gets up to go to the bathroom
and I see her distinctively like limp

2124
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:19,530
to the bathroom and walk out of my room
and slash looks over at me and he goes,

2125
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:23,910
how perfect is she? And I was like,
you didn't see her limp. And he's like,

2126
01:56:23,911 --> 01:56:25,650
what are you talking about?
And I was like, great,

2127
01:56:25,651 --> 01:56:29,310
I'm just as big an alcoholic as slash
like slash didn't notice and I didn't

2128
01:56:29,311 --> 01:56:32,820
fucking notice. But yeah, so
she was fucking crazy though.

2129
01:56:32,821 --> 01:56:36,330
To how long did dinner for uh,
Scotland?

2130
01:56:36,331 --> 01:56:39,270
You got rid of her after that got rid of
her Scotland and then kinda hooked back

2131
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:40,113
up with her in La

2132
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:43,920
because you couldn't get a Dui because
no one could give her a fucking wrote

2133
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:45,510
field sobriety tests or what?

2134
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:47,310
Can they just give her brother
and I was there or they could,

2135
01:56:47,311 --> 01:56:49,290
but when she did a field service
he goes, oh, I have several palsy.

2136
01:56:49,291 --> 01:56:51,840
And they'd be like, oh, okay.
They feel uncomfortable. Oh
No, don't worry about it.

2137
01:56:52,390 --> 01:56:57,390
So she ever drunk with cerebral palsy?
Oh, all the time. Whoa. She was,

2138
01:56:57,391 --> 01:57:00,570
uh, she, she's done not listening
to that. She was a hot mess.

2139
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:05,340
Juanque with cerebral palsy and
driving. Yeah. And only can use one arm.

2140
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:08,130
Cerebral Palsy is just like,
it happens and then it's there forever.

2141
01:57:08,131 --> 01:57:10,950
It doesn't like escalate.
Really? Yeah. It's like,

2142
01:57:10,951 --> 01:57:13,890
it's like you got no brain delivered to
your don't know oxygen delivery to your

2143
01:57:13,891 --> 01:57:17,610
brain when you're a baby and then it,
you, she had like a hook, not a hook hand,

2144
01:57:17,611 --> 01:57:19,440
but not a whole can.
But like, uh, like uh,

2145
01:57:19,850 --> 01:57:23,760
this hand and then her leg was really
skinny. Wow. I remember boundaries.

2146
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:28,010
She were when we were in Scotland where
these really hot leather pants and been

2147
01:57:28,011 --> 01:57:31,140
trees just leans over and he's like,
nice pants on your girl. Too Bad.

2148
01:57:31,141 --> 01:57:36,060
There's a baby leg, Jesus of
bugging beast. But anyway,

2149
01:57:36,061 --> 01:57:40,230
yeah, we partied and then one
night she was a fucking nightmare.

2150
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:45,590
Rescued cats and then rescued cats but
only to take them on walks at Runyon.

2151
01:57:46,140 --> 01:57:51,000
Who takes a fucking cat on a
walking? She goes leash. Yeah.

2152
01:57:51,001 --> 01:57:53,580
She goes, do you like run yet? And
I was like, hey. And she's like,

2153
01:57:53,581 --> 01:57:54,121
let's go on a hike.

2154
01:57:54,121 --> 01:57:57,300
And then now I'm thinking taking a hike
with a girl with cerebral palsy with a

2155
01:57:57,301 --> 01:58:01,940
fucking cat. Like that is way
awesome. So they can't fix that.

2156
01:58:01,941 --> 01:58:03,680
We'll pause it as no,
no therapy for,

2157
01:58:03,830 --> 01:58:08,100
it's like diminished oxygen into
the parts of the body and it just,

2158
01:58:08,101 --> 01:58:11,730
it is what it is. It is what it is and
there's no way to fix it. You can't,

2159
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:16,000
what if they exercise? Is that
possible? No, they can't exercise. No.

2160
01:58:16,001 --> 01:58:18,890
And I'm number one night we were laying
in bed in Scotland and I was like

2161
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:23,100
scratching her bad arm and
I remember never bucking,
you know, there's like dude,

2162
01:58:23,101 --> 01:58:26,040
chill type moments and she
just leaned over. She goes,
you're not going to fix it.

2163
01:58:26,790 --> 01:58:29,940
Oh No. I was like, what? She goes, I can't
feel it. I can't feel it, so don't do it.

2164
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:34,980
Oh, it's just like, uh, I can't leave
this kid. Check this one at the door.

2165
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,540
Yeah.
That's brutal man.

2166
01:58:36,541 --> 01:58:41,541
It's brutal when somebody is angry
at a disability and you know,

2167
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:42,040
you

2168
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,440
don't have anything to say,
there's nothing you could say.

2169
01:58:44,710 --> 01:58:49,300
They just have to just absorb their
uncomfortable moment. She was so hot,

2170
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:54,940
so hot. I can't even tell you. Wow. I
swear to got Angelina was opposing him.

2171
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:57,310
Uh, I'd never fucked her.
I just got to or you know,

2172
01:58:57,370 --> 01:59:01,430
other stuff like what a blow job with
the good hand, with the good hand.

2173
01:59:01,431 --> 01:59:03,010
And she was a little bit of like,

2174
01:59:03,730 --> 01:59:08,710
did you have a couple of balls with a
numb hand? No, they just call up good cup.

2175
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:11,890
But her ex boyfriend who had just gotten
out of prison called right after the

2176
01:59:11,900 --> 01:59:14,740
blowjob. It is, I'm telling you
what, it's kind of a prison.

2177
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:15,790
It just got out of prison.

2178
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:20,740
Did he call it like as you were
calming the phone rings a borderline.

2179
01:59:20,741 --> 01:59:24,550
I would say I was, I would all, I
would offer, I would offer it up as in,

2180
01:59:24,551 --> 01:59:27,280
I definitely was still in
bed and she got out like,

2181
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:31,450
and it was brand new and he called and
they started fighting on the phone and I

2182
01:59:31,451 --> 01:59:35,560
went and I just was like, I'm out of
here. And she was like, what? She's like,

2183
01:59:35,561 --> 01:59:37,990
don't leave. And then he was, she's
like, nobody, go fuck yourself.

2184
01:59:37,991 --> 01:59:40,540
And then hung up on him. And I was like,
now he's definitely coming over here.

2185
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:42,850
And then I was like, I'm fucking out of
here. I don't want no part of this drama.

2186
01:59:42,851 --> 01:59:45,610
It was also when I was like a massive
batch on, I just didn't want that shit.

2187
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:48,700
I didn't want the fucking drama that came
with the girlfriend with one. I said,

2188
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:52,090
oh, I was like, I'm in and
out of here. I'm fucking, no,
thank you. And she was like,

2189
01:59:52,150 --> 01:59:53,500
and I remember her saying something like,

2190
01:59:53,530 --> 01:59:56,320
I just had your dick in my
mouth or something like that,

2191
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:59,680
like hit you in the center of the chest
and you were like, oh. And then, uh,

2192
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:02,050
and then I walked home from sunset.

2193
02:00:02,260 --> 02:00:05,750
I was living across the street from
Andy Dick at the time. Oh No, no.

2194
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:10,660
I walked down songs all the
way from sunset to fucking
meet wherever and he used

2195
02:00:10,661 --> 02:00:13,010
to live. No, there's in the
back of it like, you know, uh,

2196
02:00:13,030 --> 02:00:15,820
Beverly and Lausanne nigger like
right around there. And I've walked,

2197
02:00:15,821 --> 02:00:19,270
I walked home. I was like, I
don't want the fucking drama.

2198
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:22,000
How long did that take?
It was a long walk,

2199
02:00:22,001 --> 02:00:24,190
but I was pretty hammer and I stopped
a few bars and I think nick sports and

2200
02:00:24,191 --> 02:00:29,170
yelled, yelled something. I said,
yeah, he stopped. Oh, walked in a bar.

2201
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:31,930
Just rolling. Oh, Barb walked into
a bar before. Are you shitting me?

2202
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:35,410
Best conversations you'll ever get into.
Fuck yes.

2203
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:40,410
Especially you walking on your own.
Yes. Sit down. Yeah, all the time.

2204
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:44,050
Brian, what? Walk into a bar and
sit down. Talk to a strangely.

2205
02:00:44,230 --> 02:00:47,870
Definitely by yourself all the time.
Hotels. What are you doing? Hotels. Oh,

2206
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:51,380
I don't go to the ball. I go to the bar
and I sit down and fucking talk shit.

2207
02:00:51,490 --> 02:00:55,650
And have you ever die all the time.
You go to bars by herself at the time?

2208
02:00:56,320 --> 02:01:00,070
Definitely. I definitely do
that. Really? Yeah. If I'm bored,

2209
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:03,700
I'll go to a bar and just hang out, look
at shifts, trying to find, pick up a girl,

2210
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:06,070
you know, like just see what the
deal is. I'm going to have a beer.

2211
02:01:06,071 --> 02:01:07,630
I'm not going to sit at
home and drink a pair.

2212
02:01:07,631 --> 02:01:11,650
I'll have a couple of beers that have
never done. I'll have no Joe, Joe, Joe,

2213
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:15,220
you got to, you know, kind of pool halls
with bars. It's just, it's the same thing.

2214
02:01:15,221 --> 02:01:18,880
It's the same thing. I got to
play pool, but yeah. All right,

2215
02:01:18,881 --> 02:01:23,400
well I was playing on my iPhone
world on Warcraft. Same thing. You,

2216
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:26,710
but you, you, you would definitely
get a kick out of the way.

2217
02:01:26,711 --> 02:01:30,520
People just divulged shit
that you'd never tell people.

2218
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:32,560
I do it at a hotel bars all the time now.

2219
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:36,020
Like that's when he get drunk
woman stories. Yeah. And Yeah.

2220
02:01:36,050 --> 02:01:39,500
Oh look bad husbands like you want to
tell you about their bad husband's.

2221
02:01:39,530 --> 02:01:40,100
Half of my ex

2222
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:42,650
girlfriends I met at bars is hanging out,
you know,

2223
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:48,050
fucking hot chick dating her for a couple
of chicken, a bar to be blind. You Stud.

2224
02:01:48,710 --> 02:01:52,070
I've never been able to meet a chick at
a bar. That's how you have to do it. I I,

2225
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:55,430
how else do you meet a girl like I, when
I lived in Columbus, Ohio, I was like,

2226
02:01:55,431 --> 02:01:58,820
all right. Uh, what else do I do?
I can go to the bowling alley.

2227
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:03,880
That's my entire dating life outside
of college was doing standup.

2228
02:02:03,970 --> 02:02:06,080
I just met Greg seat standups.
Huge.

2229
02:02:06,081 --> 02:02:09,230
That's I think one of the best things of
stand out. So, so much better. So much.

2230
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:11,810
So much easier than meeting the girl.
Going to a bar,

2231
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:14,660
meet someone after a show and you have
something to talk about. Absolutely. Here,

2232
02:02:14,661 --> 02:02:19,130
the chicks I fucked while as low as the
stand up stand up one from Liverpool

2233
02:02:19,131 --> 02:02:20,720
whose tongue wouldn't go out of her mouth.

2234
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:24,920
It wouldn't cause there was a piece of
skin connected from the bottom of my

2235
02:02:24,921 --> 02:02:27,460
mouth towards the tip of her tongue.
So hard time calling. She can,

2236
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:32,030
she can do this. Is this like, oh
wow. So the whole time you kissed her,

2237
02:02:32,031 --> 02:02:36,140
you never got hurt you. You were just
looking for tongue fucking nightmare.

2238
02:02:37,150 --> 02:02:41,400
Yeah. The you ever had a nightmare can
just really in a big long tongues? No.

2239
02:02:41,450 --> 02:02:43,430
And she smoked and she drank Hennessy.
So I just,

2240
02:02:43,431 --> 02:02:44,810
the whole time I made out with her,
I was like,

2241
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:48,090
this is what kissing Tupac would be like,
Hey,

2242
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:51,230
you hear about the two pop pop porno,
the see these stills from that.

2243
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:55,310
Joey said something about
it real. Yeah, it's real.

2244
02:02:55,311 --> 02:02:59,240
But even the other guy that's in it
that was like in a whatever digital

2245
02:02:59,241 --> 02:03:03,170
underground or whatever, he's like, oh no,
I knew about this tape for a long time.

2246
02:03:03,171 --> 02:03:05,710
Is he wearing the nose and
glasses too? No, not that guy.

2247
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:10,920
Tupac.
Why don't you go from behind.

2248
02:03:11,090 --> 02:03:14,750
You're doing cause I'm about to ruin
your asshole. That guy was hilarious.

2249
02:03:14,751 --> 02:03:17,290
Whatever happened in that he was
a big producer. I heard. Really?

2250
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:19,200
I think he's still produces probably.

2251
02:03:19,201 --> 02:03:23,000
Why wouldn't he keep producing cds of
his own digital underground was awesome.

2252
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:25,730
I don't know.
I saw him once in a small bar,

2253
02:03:26,090 --> 02:03:29,600
like a really tiny bar and it was
when digital cameras first came out.

2254
02:03:29,790 --> 02:03:33,110
Now it's taking photos and all of them
are just blurry masses on one of them.

2255
02:03:33,111 --> 02:03:36,990
You can see like a blur and it knows from
him wearing that the humpty nowadays.

2256
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:42,160
Oh that's Kinda cool. Yeah.
Was this a post success,
like they weren't famous yet,

2257
02:03:42,330 --> 02:03:45,690
right? Right. Yeah. It was just a small
little bit. He's still wearing the nose.

2258
02:03:46,790 --> 02:03:49,990
Fucking weird thing for artists.
For musical artists,

2259
02:03:50,020 --> 02:03:51,760
it's a totally different world for them.

2260
02:03:51,761 --> 02:03:54,310
It's so hard for them to get
their shit out to people,

2261
02:03:54,670 --> 02:03:56,650
you know now because of the Internet,

2262
02:03:56,651 --> 02:04:00,580
but back then you know you
needed the radio, you needed
the radio to pump you up.

2263
02:04:00,581 --> 02:04:03,670
That was the only way he got successful
and they would get successful for like

2264
02:04:03,671 --> 02:04:07,450
one fucking CD and then they'd be
gone and this CD and they'd be gone.

2265
02:04:07,510 --> 02:04:10,630
Eddie Bravo explained it to
me because he's a musician,

2266
02:04:10,631 --> 02:04:15,190
he knows a lot about the business and he
says that apparently what it is is it's

2267
02:04:15,191 --> 02:04:18,490
all so that the producers
can make a shitload of money
because the way contracts

2268
02:04:18,491 --> 02:04:20,110
are set up,
the first cds,

2269
02:04:20,350 --> 02:04:24,700
the producers make the majority of the
profits and then they basically say,

2270
02:04:24,701 --> 02:04:27,340
once you become a hit, then you become
a hit and then you make money on your,

2271
02:04:27,341 --> 02:04:31,810
you know, your next contract.
Commodity can makes total sense. Yeah.

2272
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:34,600
Because the producers will make you,
they'll make you successful.

2273
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:38,160
So they would do this and uh,
just pump and dump,

2274
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:40,470
make a new one and get rid of him,
make a new one to get rid of him.

2275
02:04:40,740 --> 02:04:43,980
So they kept making all these hits.
The producers would make all this money,

2276
02:04:43,981 --> 02:04:47,280
but the artists didn't make nearly as
much money as they should have made.

2277
02:04:47,281 --> 02:04:49,110
And then their career
was over really quickly.

2278
02:04:49,290 --> 02:04:51,570
No one wanted to play their shit anymore.
Now they're not.

2279
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:55,140
If you weren't in a record deal with
one of the big record companies and they

2280
02:04:55,141 --> 02:04:57,480
wouldn't play your shit on the radio.
Makes total sense.

2281
02:04:57,481 --> 02:05:00,870
You have an ability to make a hit.
Which one are you going to do it on?

2282
02:05:00,871 --> 02:05:03,510
The one you get no money or the one you
get all the money you make the one on

2283
02:05:03,511 --> 02:05:04,860
one.
All the ones you ever read.

2284
02:05:04,861 --> 02:05:08,310
There was a thing that Courtney love
wrote where she explained where the money

2285
02:05:08,311 --> 02:05:11,370
comes from. Some say that someone
else ghost wrote it, but uh,

2286
02:05:11,371 --> 02:05:13,740
that's probably just their hate and they
probably just don't realize how smart

2287
02:05:13,741 --> 02:05:18,330
she is, but she, I don't know. Maybe they
are. You think she's crazy? For sure,

2288
02:05:18,331 --> 02:05:21,900
but she's probably smart too. It's
definitely smart enough to get to work.

2289
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:27,270
She might be, she dated
crazy guys. She's crazy.

2290
02:05:27,271 --> 02:05:31,470
But I think she's probably clever too. I
don't know. I'm just guessing. But anyway,

2291
02:05:31,471 --> 02:05:33,000
she broke down how,

2292
02:05:33,001 --> 02:05:36,390
where the money goes when someone gets
a record deal and where the, where the,

2293
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:41,280
how the money flows down through,
you know, back to the artist.

2294
02:05:41,370 --> 02:05:43,310
And it's really pretty
ridiculous. I mean it's, it's a,

2295
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:47,880
it's really incredibly stacked for
the record companies. But you know,

2296
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:51,000
I mean that's, they have to put forth
the money. I mean, it's a business.

2297
02:05:51,001 --> 02:05:53,250
They're the ones who have to invest
the money in order to make the artists

2298
02:05:53,251 --> 02:05:56,550
famous. I mean, it is sort of a parasitic
relationship, but a certain point,

2299
02:05:56,551 --> 02:06:00,430
but it doesn't even exist
anymore. So what's the point?
You know, now all you do,

2300
02:06:00,431 --> 02:06:04,110
what you mean now really the,
the Internet is your friend.

2301
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:05,060
That's what you want to do.

2302
02:06:05,070 --> 02:06:08,400
You want to get something where people
get ahold of it. It spreads virally,

2303
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:11,970
you know, have a cool video, gets out,
it spreads virally and then you tour.

2304
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:12,481
You know what I mean?

2305
02:06:12,481 --> 02:06:14,790
That's really the only way to do it now
towards where you make your money as an

2306
02:06:14,791 --> 02:06:16,050
artist. Yeah. I mean,

2307
02:06:16,051 --> 02:06:18,750
how many bands are just releasing
their shit for free online now?

2308
02:06:18,751 --> 02:06:22,110
They'll release their whole CD for free.
Right. Oh, fucking Wilco started all that.

2309
02:06:22,111 --> 02:06:24,870
Have you seen, I'm trying to break your
heart by Wilco. No, it's one of my,

2310
02:06:24,871 --> 02:06:28,290
one of my favorite documentaries ever.
The Wilco makes an album,

2311
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:31,170
I guess what I'm going to say,
any big company named bigotry here,

2312
02:06:31,171 --> 02:06:33,670
Sony or whatever pays to make it.
They submitted,

2313
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:36,420
the company says we don't
want it. Everyone gets fired
at the top of the company.

2314
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:38,640
New Group comes on and they go,
don't worry, you can have it.

2315
02:06:38,641 --> 02:06:40,890
We don't even want it.
Wilco takes it out on tour.

2316
02:06:40,891 --> 02:06:45,390
That album releases it online for free
in this documentary on this documentary,

2317
02:06:45,391 --> 02:06:48,030
this is all happening and
then all of a sudden another,

2318
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:50,460
like a subsidiary of Sony,

2319
02:06:50,461 --> 02:06:53,250
the big company buys the
album for like three times.

2320
02:06:53,251 --> 02:06:55,070
They originally paid to make it and it's,

2321
02:06:55,320 --> 02:06:58,020
it's really great documentary
and if you like Wilco,

2322
02:06:58,260 --> 02:07:01,560
it's a lot of their acoustic music,
but it's a great documentary,

2323
02:07:01,561 --> 02:07:04,830
but I don't even, you know,
Wilco is seriously never
heard of. They're great Joe.

2324
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:08,760
There are a, it's a, it's
a, I would say, yeah.

2325
02:07:08,761 --> 02:07:11,260
I'm interested to see if you like
him or night. I like welcome back.

2326
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:14,580
It's borderline that you
would like it. No, it's no,

2327
02:07:14,610 --> 02:07:17,650
they released their shit for free
online. No, not now. Not now.

2328
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:20,850
They because it blown up and so you can
get some of their shuttle and free for

2329
02:07:20,851 --> 02:07:23,280
free online.
Jeff tweedy does is the lead singer.

2330
02:07:23,281 --> 02:07:25,680
He does living room shows where
he sits in the living room.

2331
02:07:25,681 --> 02:07:28,500
People pay a ton of money,
like a Google pay a ton of money.

2332
02:07:28,501 --> 02:07:31,530
They all chip in like say 10 grand
each to have him in his living room,

2333
02:07:32,790 --> 02:07:33,451
but then his,

2334
02:07:33,451 --> 02:07:36,190
he'll donate it to charity and it was
play acoustic in their living room.

2335
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:39,820
He's an amazing guy. The
documentary is great. It is.

2336
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:42,880
They say it's country music
but it's like modern countries.

2337
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:46,230
Jason [inaudible] favorite band.
Really. It's really good. And, and,

2338
02:07:46,231 --> 02:07:48,040
and I'll turn you on the call again.

2339
02:07:48,130 --> 02:07:51,940
Wilko Wilko I'll make you a me
some mix tape of that sounds gay,

2340
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:54,010
but I'll make you a,
but I'll,

2341
02:07:54,110 --> 02:07:57,670
I'll turn you on some tracks that you'll
like and then once you like those,

2342
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:00,190
you'll start getting into, it's
definitely something you can get high too.

2343
02:08:00,190 --> 02:08:04,360
I think a lot of those specialty Yankee
Hotel Foxtrot and so these guys became,

2344
02:08:04,860 --> 02:08:09,850
what's that? Fox Foxtrot? The
first albums. Yankee Hotel
Foxtrot bloodhound gang.

2345
02:08:10,070 --> 02:08:14,410
Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. But it's a great,
I think you'll really like it. Dude.

2346
02:08:14,411 --> 02:08:17,320
Gawker apparently has a, uh, an article.

2347
02:08:17,321 --> 02:08:22,060
Exactly saying what I said, what everyone
is too polite to say about Steve Jobs.

2348
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:25,570
Oh, tweet that shit. I'll
tweet it. I'll retweet it

2349
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:30,310
as true to wow. It's
unfortunate. Whatever, man.

2350
02:08:30,311 --> 02:08:33,400
Nobody deserves to die of
pancreatic cancer. Fuck yes.

2351
02:08:33,550 --> 02:08:36,460
That's what I'm talking about as fuck.
That's amazing man.

2352
02:08:36,461 --> 02:08:40,000
When your body just fucking gives
out and fails you. But I do believe,

2353
02:08:40,001 --> 02:08:42,730
I do believe not to get on that same vibe,

2354
02:08:42,731 --> 02:08:45,370
but I do believe in negative
energy coming back to haunt you.

2355
02:08:45,371 --> 02:08:48,640
I know that I my could be, but I don't
think that's what did him, I like I said,

2356
02:08:48,641 --> 02:08:51,140
I think he worked too hard.
Really? Yeah. I think you,

2357
02:08:51,141 --> 02:08:54,190
you red line in everyday life, that guy
did and there's a lot of stress involved.

2358
02:08:54,710 --> 02:08:57,910
You know, it puts a lot of, put a lot of
pressure on himself to be the, you know,

2359
02:08:58,030 --> 02:09:01,750
how many hours do you sleep at night?
Me, I try to get eight. I really,

2360
02:09:01,751 --> 02:09:03,100
I'm a big stickler for that man.

2361
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:07,240
I don't think it's good to not get sleep
every time I have and tried to burn

2362
02:09:07,241 --> 02:09:09,070
through the day with no sleep.
I feel like shit,

2363
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:12,970
I make it a priority to try to take naps
wherever I can. You know, if I can't get,

2364
02:09:12,990 --> 02:09:15,730
you know, eight in a row, I
tried to get an aid accumulated.

2365
02:09:15,731 --> 02:09:17,410
I think it's one of the
most important things.

2366
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:21,610
It's cause I know from exercise that
you can't exercise and not recover.

2367
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:24,880
If you do, you're going to burn
yourself out. You're going to overtrain.

2368
02:09:25,150 --> 02:09:28,510
You need to recover. And that's what
sleep is, man. You have to recover.

2369
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:32,500
You can't just burn it
every day. Eventually it'll,
you're, you fucking, you know,

2370
02:09:32,860 --> 02:09:36,820
you red line your machine too much.
Shit's gonna start breaking. Uh, yeah.

2371
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:39,910
Like I feel mine breaking down. Do you
get eight hours sleep at night? No.

2372
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:43,750
How close? It's hard when you have
kids too. I have a kid and a puppy.

2373
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,520
I can't like we are,
I get,

2374
02:09:46,690 --> 02:09:50,890
I get up a couple times a night with
someone having a nightmare or the dog just

2375
02:09:50,891 --> 02:09:53,250
fucking one to eat my face.
And then, and then you,

2376
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:57,340
and then I know even on the road now
I'm in that habit of like fall asleep,

2377
02:09:57,341 --> 02:10:01,360
wake up falsely of growing up. But I
also, um, I think I get that thing,

2378
02:10:01,361 --> 02:10:04,090
that sleep apnea shit. Of
course you did. And so I,

2379
02:10:04,230 --> 02:10:07,060
and that is been a big
proponent of me working out,

2380
02:10:07,061 --> 02:10:10,690
trying to get skinnier on the road. Just
some like, I don't want to fucking like,

2381
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:13,630
I've been in bed where you're like,
and you're like, what the fuck?

2382
02:10:13,631 --> 02:10:16,930
Like my body just almost died. Right.
And I'm sleeping through it. Well,

2383
02:10:16,931 --> 02:10:20,710
you can die to some big football
player died just a couple of years ago.

2384
02:10:20,711 --> 02:10:24,790
Some big heavy dude. He's like in his
forties early forties died of sleep apnea.

2385
02:10:24,870 --> 02:10:29,140
Just stop or you used to sleep a lot and
now I will. Now I want to sleep more.

2386
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:34,010
I want to get better. A better sleep.
Well again, shape the real thing man is

2387
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:36,140
the alcohol. You know,
your, your alcohol, your,

2388
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:40,970
every time you drink a beer you're
drinking a ton of negative calories,

2389
02:10:41,450 --> 02:10:43,880
you know, and it's just
empty, empty shifts,

2390
02:10:44,340 --> 02:10:48,990
energy. But I, but, but
I burn, I think I'm,

2391
02:10:49,110 --> 02:10:51,560
I'm not in the calorie wise.
I think I go through it.

2392
02:10:52,090 --> 02:10:54,460
Wait, that's the big thing
that was an empty calories.

2393
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:58,180
I mean if you want to lose weight, it's
so simple. Eat a vegetable based diet,

2394
02:10:58,210 --> 02:10:59,960
eat a plant and vegetable,
the base diet.

2395
02:11:00,250 --> 02:11:05,140
Eat very few starches but a lot of salads,
a lot of, you know, really healthy,

2396
02:11:05,141 --> 02:11:06,460
fresh organic vegetables.

2397
02:11:06,461 --> 02:11:09,010
Drink a shitload of water and
wait to fly off your body.

2398
02:11:09,290 --> 02:11:13,810
Eat as much salad as you fucking
can get into your mouth, you know,

2399
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:16,750
eat it to the point where you, you
know, you're completely stuffed.

2400
02:11:16,751 --> 02:11:20,210
You couldn't have another
bite. I mean it's gross. Nobody
wants to do it. You know,

2401
02:11:20,260 --> 02:11:22,020
you want to have a cheeseburger
is you want to have pizza.

2402
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:23,080
That stuff's all delicious,

2403
02:11:23,290 --> 02:11:27,700
but that stuff takes a fuck of a lot to
break down and all the shit that we have

2404
02:11:27,701 --> 02:11:31,960
that has corn syrup in it and all the
shit that we have that has all sorts of

2405
02:11:31,961 --> 02:11:36,520
crazy carbohydrates and just, we're
just, it's so easy to get fat.

2406
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:40,420
The American diet is absolutely
brutal, you know, and that bear shit,

2407
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:41,313
I can help them,

2408
02:11:43,190 --> 02:11:46,310
but it's fun. We get the
problem. What am I going to do?

2409
02:11:46,311 --> 02:11:51,170
Am I going to sit and read? Yeah,
you do that too. I've been through,

2410
02:11:51,171 --> 02:11:54,320
I've been sober for big, long stretches
and I just go, so what, what do you like?

2411
02:11:54,321 --> 02:11:57,590
Go to the movies again, like
what do we do tonight? My,

2412
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:00,750
we're just not going to talk and we'll
just sit here and be treated book.

2413
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:04,160
You have a couple of glasses of wine and
you and your wife were like talking and

2414
02:12:04,161 --> 02:12:05,810
you're having a party.
It's like, it's like, hey,

2415
02:12:05,811 --> 02:12:07,070
you want to open a bottle
of wine with dinner?

2416
02:12:07,460 --> 02:12:09,560
And then you all of a sudden you
have a bottle of wine and she's like,

2417
02:12:10,040 --> 02:12:11,960
you're never gonna believe what happened.
I was at with Eila today.

2418
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:14,090
And then you start laughing and then,
and then,

2419
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:17,270
but we definitely have sober
dinners and you're like,

2420
02:12:17,271 --> 02:12:20,810
you wanna play scrabble tonight?
She's like, yeah. And he like scrap.

2421
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:24,160
Oh, so you like get drunk
Dennis better puck. Yes.

2422
02:12:24,850 --> 02:12:29,710
How many nights a week here are
you getting lit up? Me? Yeah,

2423
02:12:30,190 --> 02:12:34,600
like in real real like seven, seven
nights a week and getting lit up. Yeah.

2424
02:12:35,020 --> 02:12:36,400
Wow.

2425
02:12:36,590 --> 02:12:39,680
But not lit up, but definitely
by, I would say by your standards.

2426
02:12:39,681 --> 02:12:41,990
If you were sitting next to me
as my body guard and Mexico,

2427
02:12:41,991 --> 02:12:44,030
you'd definitely be like lit up.

2428
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:47,600
How many drinks are we talking
about every night? I don't know.

2429
02:12:47,601 --> 02:12:51,970
I can't like ballpark it that way. No, no.
I mean, I could do, hey, let's not get,

2430
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:56,060
let's, let's not lie, but it's a
light day. If I have like four beers,

2431
02:12:56,770 --> 02:12:58,940
four beers I'll do, I won't even
feel it. And I'll just go to bed.

2432
02:13:00,350 --> 02:13:04,050
How dare you sir? Four beers. Four
beers. And I'm like fucking done. Wow.

2433
02:13:04,250 --> 02:13:06,860
Every night, man. No, no,
no. Don't worry about that.

2434
02:13:07,020 --> 02:13:10,370
I was doing that every night. I would
worry if I was getting lit up every night.

2435
02:13:10,660 --> 02:13:15,610
Yeah. But yeah, but we
could fucking seriously,

2436
02:13:15,670 --> 02:13:17,540
but there,
why are we doing this?

2437
02:13:18,280 --> 02:13:22,020
Can we go back and I know we just
got on a subject. No, no, no.

2438
02:13:22,030 --> 02:13:24,180
I said you don't drink every
day is what you're saying it.

2439
02:13:24,660 --> 02:13:25,810
I mean, I, I, like I said,

2440
02:13:25,811 --> 02:13:27,580
I don't think there's anything wrong
with a couple of drinks every day.

2441
02:13:27,581 --> 02:13:28,400
If you want to do it.

2442
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:32,100
Yeah. Couple of the regular
guys put paper to me. Yeah, I

2443
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:34,380
put that aside. That's you're going
to pay that. You gotta to pay for that

2444
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:37,240
pay for what though? Health?
Like liver wise. Sure.

2445
02:13:37,330 --> 02:13:41,230
So does those taking sweaty
seven official oil pills a day?

2446
02:13:41,260 --> 02:13:44,980
It doesn't that fuck over your liver. No,
it doesn't fuck up your liver for food,

2447
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:45,491
but you're,

2448
02:13:45,491 --> 02:13:48,300
you're taking so much supplements that
could fuck up your liver room or my

2449
02:13:48,310 --> 02:13:49,930
supplements.
I get my blood checked,

2450
02:13:49,931 --> 02:13:52,120
I know what I'm doing in
my by no you deal but,

2451
02:13:52,570 --> 02:13:55,020
but I didn't fuck your liver up alcohol,

2452
02:13:57,340 --> 02:13:59,410
vitamins or just food.
It's just broken down.

2453
02:13:59,411 --> 02:14:01,660
Food is not hard for your
body to process them at all.

2454
02:14:01,990 --> 02:14:06,790
That's a complete misnomer.
It's just not true. Yeah.

2455
02:14:06,791 --> 02:14:10,960
But if you're doing like, I dunno
like levels of vitamins. Yeah you can.

2456
02:14:10,961 --> 02:14:14,200
There's certain things that like fat
soluble vitamins that you could have,

2457
02:14:14,201 --> 02:14:16,600
you know that you take too much of
them and they get into your system.

2458
02:14:16,601 --> 02:14:19,060
But if you're getting your blood check,
do you know what you're doing?

2459
02:14:19,060 --> 02:14:22,600
If you know your dosage are, I'll get
my blood checked, my liver with be,

2460
02:14:22,601 --> 02:14:26,430
should everybody, should I go to a
checkup once a year and then, and I,

2461
02:14:26,431 --> 02:14:31,270
and you know my four beers are pounded,
like back to back to back the course.

2462
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:34,270
Go do the first show,
second show, have a beer,

2463
02:14:34,271 --> 02:14:36,340
and then have a couple of
years out of the show. But,

2464
02:14:36,341 --> 02:14:38,890
and then I definitely
will say that I drink,

2465
02:14:38,891 --> 02:14:41,560
I would say more than
the average American,

2466
02:14:41,950 --> 02:14:44,440
100% but I have a different
lifestyle than the average American.

2467
02:14:44,441 --> 02:14:48,070
And I also spend my time differently
than the average American I, you know,

2468
02:14:48,140 --> 02:14:50,860
I'm not gonna I'm all for

2469
02:14:51,320 --> 02:14:53,910
thing that you do that might
not be so good for you,

2470
02:14:53,911 --> 02:14:57,420
that sort of kind of enhances your life.
And I think alcohol falls into that,

2471
02:14:58,080 --> 02:15:00,000
you know? I mean if that's
what you choose to do. Look,

2472
02:15:00,001 --> 02:15:05,001
all of my favorite people have either
had problems with drugs or you know,

2473
02:15:06,961 --> 02:15:08,970
or it could have a problem with
drugs where it wouldn't be.

2474
02:15:09,110 --> 02:15:12,710
So you had an alcoholic just anonymous.
Right now you're not telling anyone.

2475
02:15:12,810 --> 02:15:17,660
I hope. Why are you so angry
about alcohol? You know why?

2476
02:15:17,661 --> 02:15:19,350
Because Joey Diaz told
me you're an android.

2477
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:22,430
Oh, there's a point of view on something.
It doesn't mean they're angry on it.

2478
02:15:22,790 --> 02:15:23,270
I don't,

2479
02:15:23,270 --> 02:15:26,990
I just said that I think that alcohol
is probably worth it because it enhances

2480
02:15:26,991 --> 02:15:30,650
your life enough to balance out whatever
damage is doing to your body. You know,

2481
02:15:30,651 --> 02:15:33,770
I think some of the most fun times
I've ever had has been buzzed.

2482
02:15:34,100 --> 02:15:35,090
I went with Aubrey,

2483
02:15:35,120 --> 02:15:39,600
we went to a country western
bar in Houston after the
show on Thursday night or

2484
02:15:39,601 --> 02:15:41,000
a Friday night rather.
And Houston,

2485
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:44,600
we had a great fucking time
and the booze was flying.

2486
02:15:44,630 --> 02:15:48,980
We were doing shots every night, cause
I don't think it's healthy. I think

2487
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:54,350
every night. No, no, no, no, no.
Your body suffers, man. If you,

2488
02:15:54,351 --> 02:15:57,650
if you get hammered every night, I believe
that your, your performance suffers.

2489
02:15:57,651 --> 02:16:01,430
I know it's suffers because I know
my set suffer. If I have a hangover,

2490
02:16:01,431 --> 02:16:04,880
my sets on stage, they don't, they're not,
they're not as good. If I'm hung over,

2491
02:16:05,150 --> 02:16:08,840
I know that hung over. You're
funny drunk. I'm funny as shit.

2492
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:12,140
No drunk. I'm not funny. Really
drunk. I'm not funny drunk. Um,

2493
02:16:12,410 --> 02:16:14,590
I'm rambling and I'm,
and I,

2494
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:19,160
and I don't know where I'm going and I
don't mean like hammers. No, no, no, no.

2495
02:16:19,350 --> 02:16:23,570
So, but like, but if I'm, if I'm hung
over and I have a cup of coffee, man,

2496
02:16:23,660 --> 02:16:27,170
my brain fires weird and it's funny as
shit. Really? Yeah. That's interesting.

2497
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:30,400
I'm actually, I think I enjoy being
hung over than I enjoy being sober.

2498
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:35,130
See, I think right away when
I'm hung over, I was always
thinking, what did you do?

2499
02:16:35,131 --> 02:16:36,150
Stupid.
Look what you did here.

2500
02:16:37,250 --> 02:16:39,940
I got through with him, you know, and I
say, I go buddy, let's get it back up.

2501
02:16:39,970 --> 02:16:41,950
We know we did to ourselves.
We're on the same team here.

2502
02:16:42,130 --> 02:16:44,230
Let's have a cup of coffee if we need to,
we'll do it.

2503
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:45,550
Let's fucking write this boat.

2504
02:16:45,620 --> 02:16:50,080
Well, most of what I do is try to get a
light workout in and drink a shitload of

2505
02:16:50,430 --> 02:16:53,370
fucking totally work out.
And if I work out, it's gone.

2506
02:16:53,371 --> 02:16:56,200
The hangover grilling a
hundred percent never throw up.

2507
02:16:56,430 --> 02:16:58,500
Throw up if you from hangover.
Never

2508
02:16:58,570 --> 02:17:02,320
workout too hard though. You could Jack
Yourself. I've done that too. I've, uh,

2509
02:17:02,380 --> 02:17:03,550
I've had a Hong Kong,

2510
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:06,180
I've been hung over and to decided I'm
just going to get a crazy workout in.

2511
02:17:06,181 --> 02:17:06,310
Yeah,

2512
02:17:06,310 --> 02:17:10,240
yeah. Fucking blow it out and then I'm
just useless than just kills me. Yeah,

2513
02:17:10,690 --> 02:17:11,530
that's dangerous.

2514
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:12,730
No, I don't, I don't, you know,

2515
02:17:12,731 --> 02:17:15,160
obviously I'm talking about
ellipticals on a fucking hotel room.

2516
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:17,230
Either that, man, let me tell
you some elliptical machine.

2517
02:17:17,231 --> 02:17:19,810
If you do it at a high level and
you do it a lot of intensity,

2518
02:17:19,930 --> 02:17:23,380
you should see I do elliptical workout,
a 40 minute elliptical workout dude,

2519
02:17:23,381 --> 02:17:27,520
where I have it all set up where the
first three minutes it's pretty light.

2520
02:17:27,521 --> 02:17:30,130
And then the second two minutes I pick
up the pace and then I go through these

2521
02:17:30,131 --> 02:17:33,880
intimate and sprints where I get up to
whatever the level is. That's the highest.

2522
02:17:34,140 --> 02:17:38,710
I'll jack it up to the highest and do
like a one minute wrestling match of death

2523
02:17:38,711 --> 02:17:40,090
with that fucking elliptical machine.

2524
02:17:40,510 --> 02:17:45,510
And then I'll drop it down to like half
the speed and I sprint and it's a bow

2525
02:17:45,651 --> 02:17:48,760
Rudel brutal workout to the point where,
and when I'm done,

2526
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:52,960
sometimes my fucking hands are numb
from gripping the polls. I'm shaking,

2527
02:17:52,961 --> 02:17:54,520
my heart's pounding like I,

2528
02:17:54,530 --> 02:17:58,000
I've been drenched with sweat when I
was in Hawaii the last time I did it,

2529
02:17:58,270 --> 02:18:01,930
I had puddles to the left and the
right amount of elliptical machine.

2530
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:05,590
You could get a fucking for Roche,
this workout in an elliptical machine,

2531
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:08,620
you just gotta do it like a madman.
You can't do it like a pussy,

2532
02:18:08,730 --> 02:18:09,790
like Judah Friedlander.

2533
02:18:10,530 --> 02:18:14,920
Two to Freelander crazy is a
beast of a workout or elliptical.

2534
02:18:14,950 --> 02:18:15,641
Does he really like,

2535
02:18:15,641 --> 02:18:18,220
you almost think he's making fun of
people working on a little lipstick.

2536
02:18:20,010 --> 02:18:23,320
You're like, what the fuck is you
doing it for comic relief? No, no.

2537
02:18:26,010 --> 02:18:27,340
He's going to do the podcast soon.

2538
02:18:27,390 --> 02:18:32,100
So is David Tell David tells doing
their dog the fuck the last Tuesday in

2539
02:18:32,101 --> 02:18:33,420
October he's going to be doing it.

2540
02:18:33,920 --> 02:18:38,760
David [inaudible] best management
contacted me. It's so funny.

2541
02:18:38,870 --> 02:18:42,360
I don't think Dave has an email. He
doesn't have an email. I don't think so.

2542
02:18:42,420 --> 02:18:46,830
I wouldn't be shocked if he, you know,
Todd glass doesn't have an email.

2543
02:18:46,980 --> 02:18:49,350
Like I wouldn't be shocked.
No tog last send them an email.

2544
02:18:49,351 --> 02:18:52,020
I wouldn't even think talking about
she has a cell phone. You know what?

2545
02:18:52,021 --> 02:18:55,590
I think that's true because Todd glass
and I spoke on the phone once and he was

2546
02:18:55,591 --> 02:18:59,730
like excited to get me on the phone and
I think he said something crazy like I

2547
02:18:59,731 --> 02:19:01,410
don't have a cell phone
or I'd give it to you

2548
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:05,360
and he made, maybe I'm, no, no,
no, no, you're accurate. I've,

2549
02:19:05,390 --> 02:19:08,720
because I've heard that but it tells
us it run is like his Twitter is like

2550
02:19:08,721 --> 02:19:12,950
please see Dave at and and his mind space
back in the day was like that and Dave

2551
02:19:12,951 --> 02:19:15,520
just isn't that guy nor Mcdonald's there.

2552
02:19:15,810 --> 02:19:20,540
Those guys are like old school in the
sense that they didn't see the benefit to

2553
02:19:20,660 --> 02:19:23,070
wasting, they're already
valuable time. What?

2554
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:26,800
Cause they were famous before the whole
Internet ship blew up. I mean you're,

2555
02:19:26,801 --> 02:19:30,410
you're in that, you put out your brand. I
was thinking about this the other night.

2556
02:19:30,411 --> 02:19:34,640
I was like, your brand has been
your, was your brand? Well,

2557
02:19:34,670 --> 02:19:35,900
right when the Internet started,

2558
02:19:36,440 --> 02:19:41,180
like you're fucking your website with the
aliens and the fucking, and your blog.

2559
02:19:41,181 --> 02:19:43,310
I mean, how long did you keep
up with the fucking blog?

2560
02:19:43,390 --> 02:19:44,111
I've been writing a book,

2561
02:19:44,111 --> 02:19:47,230
so I haven't written a blog in
forever now for those asking,

2562
02:19:47,540 --> 02:19:50,740
I had a problem with a disagreement with
the people that wanted to publish the

2563
02:19:50,741 --> 02:19:53,870
book. They wanted to do
it different. And My,

2564
02:19:54,220 --> 02:19:59,220
my vision was to do my way of looking
at the world intertwined with how the

2565
02:20:00,731 --> 02:20:02,870
things that I've learned about how to,
to,

2566
02:20:02,950 --> 02:20:06,710
to control myself and operate
through life and, and, and the,

2567
02:20:06,711 --> 02:20:11,711
the perspective that I've gained on
how bizarre and strange just life is in

2568
02:20:11,891 --> 02:20:16,060
general. It's a very, it's
a very weird book, but it's,

2569
02:20:16,061 --> 02:20:18,760
a lot of it is really funny,
but a lot of is just really strange.

2570
02:20:19,270 --> 02:20:22,420
And when I brought it to them,
they didn't like the really strange stuff.

2571
02:20:22,470 --> 02:20:23,910
And then they don't know who you are.

2572
02:20:23,990 --> 02:20:27,710
Yeah. They wanted me to do, they actually
wanted me to do my standup. They said,

2573
02:20:27,711 --> 02:20:31,850
why don't you take your stand up and
just transcribe it? And I was like, Oh,

2574
02:20:31,851 --> 02:20:34,580
I'm going to send you some blogs like
you gotta you gotta read my shit.

2575
02:20:34,581 --> 02:20:37,670
And they're like, this is
brilliant writing. We love
it, but it's really not funny.

2576
02:20:37,671 --> 02:20:39,440
You're not trying to be
funny. And I'm like, yeah,

2577
02:20:39,441 --> 02:20:41,390
but there's some of them
that are funny like this,

2578
02:20:41,391 --> 02:20:43,280
these two of them sending you aren't here.
I'll send you a funny one.

2579
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:46,820
We like this one. Can you make them
all like this? And I'm like, no,

2580
02:20:46,821 --> 02:20:49,700
I can't make them all like this because
sometimes there's some shit that I've,

2581
02:20:49,750 --> 02:20:52,860
I'm, I'm thinking of or I want
to talk about that isn't funny.

2582
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:54,500
It just happens to be bizarre.

2583
02:20:54,930 --> 02:20:56,750
But that's the,
that is the,

2584
02:20:57,250 --> 02:21:00,150
the business of someone buying
into the brand of Joe Rogan,

2585
02:21:00,151 --> 02:21:02,510
not knowing what the brand
is like them going like

2586
02:21:02,650 --> 02:21:04,640
believe in a brand man.
You know,

2587
02:21:04,710 --> 02:21:07,200
you totally are a brand though.
I don't believe in a brand either.

2588
02:21:07,201 --> 02:21:08,670
I always believe,
but your brand,

2589
02:21:08,671 --> 02:21:11,970
I mean seriously it of all the fucking
comics I could want their brand to be.

2590
02:21:12,060 --> 02:21:14,610
Your brand is always reinventing itself.
It's always something new. It's over.

2591
02:21:14,611 --> 02:21:17,850
Whatever you find interesting.
Whether it's fucking, you know, dis,

2592
02:21:18,110 --> 02:21:22,320
you know back in someone who's a fan of,
of you on Newsradio,

2593
02:21:22,410 --> 02:21:25,920
it's MMA. Then it's the
podcast. It's marijuana is DMT.

2594
02:21:25,921 --> 02:21:28,650
It's all these interesting fear factor,
fear factor.

2595
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:31,200
If you were going to put the
brand of the new Joe Rogan out,

2596
02:21:31,350 --> 02:21:34,560
the new brand would not go back
to fear factor, but you say, hey,

2597
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:36,630
I fucking like that show.
It was a fun show to shoot.

2598
02:21:36,631 --> 02:21:40,050
I love those people and it was a
good show. That's the brand that's,

2599
02:21:40,110 --> 02:21:43,710
it's always reinventing himself, you
know, to be a brand where you go, I'm the,

2600
02:21:43,711 --> 02:21:44,544
I'm not going to say,

2601
02:21:44,670 --> 02:21:47,310
but like I'm the Mexican comic that
always has the Mexican parents.

2602
02:21:47,311 --> 02:21:51,030
I did the Mexican things.
That's what you're thinking
of brand when when you say,

2603
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:52,620
I don't want to think,
believe in brand. Yep.

2604
02:21:53,420 --> 02:21:56,420
I'm just myself.
You know exactly what a brand,

2605
02:21:56,421 --> 02:21:59,870
it seems weird to call that a brand
when you're just yourself, you know?

2606
02:21:59,930 --> 02:22:01,190
Yeah. But despite, would you believe,

2607
02:22:01,191 --> 02:22:03,620
and I only know this from going on the
road and running into people that are

2608
02:22:03,621 --> 02:22:05,750
fans of your podcast,
there are a lot of people like you.

2609
02:22:06,090 --> 02:22:07,150
Yeah, of course. That's the,

2610
02:22:07,151 --> 02:22:09,930
one of the more interesting things
about this podcast is that all of us,

2611
02:22:10,150 --> 02:22:13,620
or reaching out to a bunch of people out
there that don't know anybody like us

2612
02:22:13,750 --> 02:22:15,450
but think like us and they,

2613
02:22:15,451 --> 02:22:18,150
they're surrounded by a bunch of
fucking morons and thinking a completely

2614
02:22:18,151 --> 02:22:19,470
different way.
And it's stifling.

2615
02:22:19,720 --> 02:22:22,770
It's stifling and it's depressing and
it just doesn't give him any hope.

2616
02:22:22,980 --> 02:22:24,870
And I can't tell you how many
times you've been on the,

2617
02:22:25,230 --> 02:22:28,530
and just this weekend and Houston
I talked to, I don't know how many,

2618
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:32,280
literally hundreds of people who
told me that it changed their life.

2619
02:22:32,310 --> 02:22:33,400
They're like,
do to change my life.

2620
02:22:33,401 --> 02:22:36,060
It changed my life cause they know they
don't have it. It's not, they're not.

2621
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:40,650
No one, no one is representing that
point of view out there in the media.

2622
02:22:40,660 --> 02:22:44,430
You couldn't do it on a regular
mainstream radio show. It's impossible.

2623
02:22:44,431 --> 02:22:45,810
You couldn't do it on a television show,

2624
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:48,260
but despite that you couldn't even reach
out to the people that are listening to

2625
02:22:48,261 --> 02:22:49,610
you when they're listening to you.
Yeah,

2626
02:22:49,670 --> 02:22:54,670
like dude's got his headset and he and
his ears at target Sunday and I got

2627
02:22:55,491 --> 02:22:58,040
another car with my wife and he
goes, Holy Shit. Takes it out.

2628
02:22:58,070 --> 02:23:02,270
The fucking machine is listening
to your podcast in his ears.

2629
02:23:02,271 --> 02:23:03,590
Put fucking loading up carts.

2630
02:23:03,740 --> 02:23:05,960
You can't connect with any
of those outlets that way.

2631
02:23:06,010 --> 02:23:08,980
I had a power lunch with Alex Jones,

2632
02:23:09,850 --> 02:23:11,080
Brendan Walsh,

2633
02:23:11,620 --> 02:23:16,620
Doug Benson and Joey Diaz and Aubrey
from on labs and a four dudes from my

2634
02:23:19,511 --> 02:23:20,291
message board.

2635
02:23:20,291 --> 02:23:23,980
We had this power lunch and we're all
sitting in this Mexican place drinking

2636
02:23:23,981 --> 02:23:27,330
Margarita is before the fights and eating
burritos and it was just like I was,

2637
02:23:27,370 --> 02:23:30,460
I got some videos of it. Some of them
I can't show cause Joey Diaz once.

2638
02:23:30,461 --> 02:23:32,260
It doesn't want me to show him
some of the things that he said,

2639
02:23:32,261 --> 02:23:35,890
but they were absolutely hilarious, but
he doesn't want to get in trouble. But uh,

2640
02:23:36,220 --> 02:23:39,580
while, while we're having this lunch, Alex
Jones had the best point ever. He goes,

2641
02:23:39,700 --> 02:23:42,670
he goes,
you could take a TV camera,

2642
02:23:42,671 --> 02:23:47,230
turn it on a guy and him and his buddies
smoking a bong and it'd be the number

2643
02:23:47,231 --> 02:23:51,340
one show on CBS, put it on an 8:00 PM at
night. That's what people want to watch.

2644
02:23:51,620 --> 02:23:54,880
He was your, your broadcast
is that, that's what we want
to watch. And I was like,

2645
02:23:54,900 --> 02:23:57,160
you really could if
they had a fucking show,

2646
02:23:57,370 --> 02:24:00,610
if like some people and their buddies,
if they were funny,

2647
02:24:00,611 --> 02:24:05,050
they were really funny guys and it was
just a bong and the table and a room and

2648
02:24:05,051 --> 02:24:07,750
the living room and they're all sitting
around shooting the shit and they're all

2649
02:24:07,751 --> 02:24:10,000
intelligent and be the number one show.

2650
02:24:10,260 --> 02:24:13,170
Yeah. And it just call it
four guy spoken a ball,

2651
02:24:13,210 --> 02:24:16,630
four guys in a bong progressing a Bonk,
you fucking hit show.

2652
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:18,660
I had at least two new
wants to do with it.

2653
02:24:18,661 --> 02:24:21,250
Talked about and then I tune
it again cause I go, oh shit.

2654
02:24:21,251 --> 02:24:24,190
They just figured out that if they
tied the bond with string on the roof,

2655
02:24:24,191 --> 02:24:25,570
they could swing it back
and forth to each other.

2656
02:24:25,610 --> 02:24:28,220
Well there's more of those people out
there then you would think there's more

2657
02:24:28,221 --> 02:24:30,980
people out there like those four
guys in a bomb. Then you would think,

2658
02:24:31,190 --> 02:24:34,370
and that's something like with the
podcast reaches and that's why you know

2659
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:37,250
you've never had a venue like that before.

2660
02:24:37,450 --> 02:24:39,980
You know you've never had a connection
like that with all those people.

2661
02:24:39,981 --> 02:24:41,220
Like they'd want you,
they didn't,

2662
02:24:41,250 --> 02:24:44,330
they didn't know you were there and now
there's, they're happy. They found you,

2663
02:24:44,750 --> 02:24:45,583
you one of them.

2664
02:24:46,190 --> 02:24:47,870
It's like discovering
a good band and you go,

2665
02:24:47,871 --> 02:24:49,580
God is the first one
to find out that band.

2666
02:24:49,710 --> 02:24:50,870
Yeah,
but then we become mainstream.

2667
02:24:50,871 --> 02:24:53,640
They fucking hate you once you get
your first comedy central special.

2668
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:56,710
We started selling out arenas
that it mad at you when,

2669
02:24:56,730 --> 02:24:58,320
remember when he was the machine dude.

2670
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:00,730
Okay.

2671
02:25:00,730 --> 02:25:04,660
I was there in the early days.
Man. People love to have something.

2672
02:25:04,661 --> 02:25:06,080
That's a problem I have
on my message board.

2673
02:25:06,081 --> 02:25:09,940
Sometimes people love to be the people
that know about it first and it's like

2674
02:25:09,941 --> 02:25:14,110
new people will come on and then just
relentlessly towards the new people for

2675
02:25:14,111 --> 02:25:14,940
being new.

2676
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:17,580
I've given up on that message board,
I just can't do it anymore.

2677
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:20,340
It's kind of negative lately, right?
Yeah. It's just, it's like, you know what,

2678
02:25:20,370 --> 02:25:21,850
I could, I don't, I,

2679
02:25:21,940 --> 02:25:25,780
I'm trying not to be on the Internet as
much anymore so I'm not trying to just

2680
02:25:25,790 --> 02:25:27,790
to do, to stop dealing with
all the negative. Yeah.

2681
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:32,290
Cause it's like I need to check out
tech news, I need to do this and that,

2682
02:25:32,291 --> 02:25:37,291
but I'm kind of done with the sharing
and the any more than I do already.

2683
02:25:37,540 --> 02:25:40,520
You know the guy in sharing
information. Yeah. Like I,

2684
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:43,780
I'm tired of letting people
know who I am a little,

2685
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:48,190
but you put it all out there so
far and I know you're dating,

2686
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:52,610
I've kind of gone back a lot more than
normal. I'm not, not really doing it.

2687
02:25:52,611 --> 02:25:56,470
It's like I check Twitter maybe
once, twice a day. Now it's Facebook.

2688
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:59,860
Forget about us because he'd becoming
famous. And as you're becoming famous,

2689
02:25:59,861 --> 02:26:03,010
you're dealing with a higher and higher
volume of haters. Stay in bed longer.

2690
02:26:03,011 --> 02:26:06,220
When you're famous, I've notice you
get, you get a lot of haters, man.

2691
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:09,730
You know there's a lot of people that
get upset at you and Felix somehow or

2692
02:26:09,731 --> 02:26:12,680
another, they should be doing what
you're doing. That is a accurate, yeah,

2693
02:26:12,700 --> 02:26:15,760
there's some haters out there, man.
And you, if you're online all the time,

2694
02:26:15,761 --> 02:26:17,500
you're going to deal with those
people. You know, they're gonna,

2695
02:26:17,530 --> 02:26:20,530
they're gonna run into you when they're
going to fucking throw up shit on your

2696
02:26:20,531 --> 02:26:23,980
Twitter and you're going to look at it.
But the good news is you just,

2697
02:26:24,430 --> 02:26:28,360
it's good to know that people like that
exist and just hit that block button and

2698
02:26:28,361 --> 02:26:30,840
move along. I don't, I
don't even fuck with them.

2699
02:26:31,050 --> 02:26:34,620
Do you block people below blog young
buck anyway? No. Cause I don't have the,

2700
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:36,430
I don't know people's spam dude.
I've had,

2701
02:26:36,580 --> 02:26:40,570
I've had crazy people spam
my entire timeline with like
10 messages in a row and

2702
02:26:40,571 --> 02:26:43,450
you're like, okay. And then you block
them. They come back as a different name.

2703
02:26:43,451 --> 02:26:47,260
It's like a never ending story.
It's so dumb. Yeah, dude, there's,

2704
02:26:47,290 --> 02:26:50,490
I wonder how many people are actually
trolling out there. You know,

2705
02:26:50,580 --> 02:26:51,110
maybe it's like,

2706
02:26:51,110 --> 02:26:54,330
I always like think it's like one dude
has been trolling me forever. Right.

2707
02:26:54,840 --> 02:26:58,340
I know Tom's occurs trolling me. Tom's a
gorgeous calling me that it wasn't true.

2708
02:26:58,450 --> 02:27:00,480
He told me he was trolling.
Know who he is. I know he has

2709
02:27:01,390 --> 02:27:04,360
because this, okay, you ready?
I'm going to find this girl.

2710
02:27:04,361 --> 02:27:06,340
She's got a tweeted me
and like pass two seconds.

2711
02:27:06,790 --> 02:27:10,510
Cause I know this is not a real person.
Oh, he's tweeting you with a girl.

2712
02:27:10,870 --> 02:27:14,080
All right. Here's what I got to tell you
her name. But here's what she tweeted me.

2713
02:27:14,350 --> 02:27:18,190
Oh, here's her profile. I love Bert
Kreischer get to meet Burton February.

2714
02:27:18,191 --> 02:27:21,490
I Love Zach Baggins great to
get to meet him in November.

2715
02:27:21,730 --> 02:27:25,240
And I was the first poll reply of Bert
Kreischer. This is what she writes.

2716
02:27:25,300 --> 02:27:27,630
And then she goes, uh, or
maybe exactly. I don't know.

2717
02:27:28,060 --> 02:27:30,480
She said today I got the ones,
she got it. She goes, yeah,

2718

2719
02:27:33,490 --> 02:27:35,550
And I was like and love
you miss you switch.

2720
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:39,570
Like I know it's not a real
fucking person. Oh you know,

2721
02:27:39,610 --> 02:27:43,180
could easily be a real person she's
listing right now, but she's tweeting,

2722
02:27:43,181 --> 02:27:46,990
you know, she, if she goes, I believe
it's vice.com awesome podcast.

2723
02:27:46,991 --> 02:27:49,990
Can't wait to meet you. Sexy
machine. So she's totally listening.

2724
02:27:49,991 --> 02:27:52,180
I just thought you were sorry.
I thought you were not a real person.

2725
02:27:52,420 --> 02:27:55,200
Could easily be real. Yeah, it's actually
not. It's actually my girlfriend.

2726
02:27:55,260 --> 02:27:58,260
This is a lot of people out there that
are looking for someone to fixate on

2727
02:27:58,261 --> 02:28:00,900
buddy. They're looking for someone
to just lock their sights on.

2728
02:28:00,980 --> 02:28:02,780
Please find a pic of flying dildos.

2729
02:28:02,781 --> 02:28:06,680
And until then I'll visualize it in my
head forever as I think wants to be a

2730
02:28:06,681 --> 02:28:09,380
real person. I totally thought this
was a fucking one of my friends

2731
02:28:09,440 --> 02:28:11,900
lid. You're hilarious. Why would you think
you'd have someone obsessed with you?

2732
02:28:13,820 --> 02:28:17,910
Cause, I dunno, you didn't
fucking machine bro that,

2733
02:28:17,930 --> 02:28:21,320
but I'm just getting,
I'm getting this on the toilet saying,

2734
02:28:21,321 --> 02:28:23,150
so your birthday is November
3rd let me just say,

2735
02:28:23,151 --> 02:28:27,440
I'll give you the best virtual blow
job you've ever had. Gall love you.

2736
02:28:27,470 --> 02:28:29,910
Like I just go,
that can't be fucking with,

2737
02:28:30,280 --> 02:28:31,610
why would you think
that that was excellent?

2738
02:28:34,390 --> 02:28:37,150
It's gotta be fucking with,
why would you think that?

2739
02:28:37,151 --> 02:28:40,900
I think there's just some girl today
wants to suck your hog. No fellow bear.

2740
02:28:40,901 --> 02:28:44,350
You're so crazy a guarantee. You there's
a girl this and ladies and gentlemen,

2741
02:28:44,351 --> 02:28:47,590
this is your next task, Buck.
When you see Bert Kreischer,

2742
02:28:48,940 --> 02:28:51,760
when you see Bert Kreischer at
a comedy club, just say burnt.

2743
02:28:51,850 --> 02:28:55,000
I would love to suck your hog
and you could qualify that with,

2744
02:28:55,001 --> 02:28:57,550
if I wasn't married,
if I didn't have a boyfriend,

2745
02:28:57,551 --> 02:29:01,240
if I was in you weren't married,
Burt, I'd love to suck your hog.

2746
02:29:01,241 --> 02:29:03,850
Stop being so hard on yourself.
No, no, it's not hard on myself.

2747
02:29:03,851 --> 02:29:07,330
But if you read these tweets, I believe
the crazy person, he's fixated on you.

2748
02:29:07,331 --> 02:29:10,600
You're a hilarious guy and
she's enthralled by your talent.

2749
02:29:10,601 --> 02:29:13,600
And she wants to put your hog in her
mouth. Why is it so hard to believe?

2750
02:29:13,601 --> 02:29:16,880
What do you know in man, I was this
real fucking, come on man. I'm,

2751
02:29:16,881 --> 02:29:21,010
I'm wondering is this is, no, not that
I'm talking about your, your, you know,

2752
02:29:21,011 --> 02:29:22,840
you being 100%.

2753
02:29:23,950 --> 02:29:28,410
Someone like someone saying that to
me online. Adam, all the fucking 20,

2754
02:29:28,411 --> 02:29:31,140
30,000 people that follow me. The one
person that says that I go, all right,

2755
02:29:31,141 --> 02:29:33,720
this is Tom Segura cause no
one said that to me all day,

2756
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:37,860
but one person said it was like, I'm
going to be honest. What bullshit

2757
02:29:38,140 --> 02:29:42,310
you to know if it's not fake humility that
you're crazy because you're hilarious.

2758
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:43,470
I should expect

2759
02:29:43,580 --> 02:29:47,330
no, I get good emails. Oh, don't get me
wrong. I get good tweets of like, hey,

2760
02:29:47,331 --> 02:29:49,220
you're really funny. I'd love
you on the podcast. You're great.

2761
02:29:49,221 --> 02:29:51,290
When are you gonna go back on?
Why don't you have your own podcast?

2762
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:53,660
None of them say,
I want to give you a virtual blow.

2763
02:29:53,820 --> 02:29:58,210
If I was a girl and I was working
in a diner in Dayton, Ohio, and uh,

2764
02:29:58,350 --> 02:30:01,080
just broke up with my man. Didn't
have a whole lot going on in my life,

2765
02:30:01,081 --> 02:30:04,530
but I love that podcast. I listened to
it on the treadmill every day and went,

2766
02:30:04,550 --> 02:30:09,240
Burke crashes on my God. He is so funny.
I almost peed my pants on that treadmill.

2767
02:30:09,420 --> 02:30:11,370
You know what I did? I got on
Twitter and I sent them a message.

2768
02:30:11,530 --> 02:30:13,990
Ooh,
Ooh.

2769
02:30:15,400 --> 02:30:17,830
I've met some of those people
that will send you crazy messages.

2770
02:30:17,831 --> 02:30:21,130
And then Claudia and Paul Chou and
trouble lick your ear and shit.

2771
02:30:21,340 --> 02:30:23,410
They're out there, dude. They're
real. Don't you wonder though,

2772
02:30:23,411 --> 02:30:27,160
if so one of the comics is
Kroger's, but he's like, well,

2773
02:30:27,161 --> 02:30:29,460
that's real simple then don't respond
to any of them other than fine.

2774
02:30:29,540 --> 02:30:32,100
So that's why I get, I want her to
find where all the time and go, hey,

2775
02:30:32,101 --> 02:30:33,000
thanks for the virtual budget.

2776
02:30:33,450 --> 02:30:36,180
Do you know dudes who are
obsessive? You? We all do.

2777
02:30:36,480 --> 02:30:38,220
We know do too obsessive about pussy.

2778
02:30:38,520 --> 02:30:40,470
And I have some friends that
I've thought about trawling.

2779
02:30:40,860 --> 02:30:44,460
I have some friends that I'd love
to put the boots to the slow.

2780
02:30:44,490 --> 02:30:49,110
I would have to accumulate
a lot of photographs of the
same girl though because

2781
02:30:49,111 --> 02:30:51,660
I'm going to have to like set up
if I'm going to do a real troll.

2782
02:30:51,810 --> 02:30:54,480
You gotta like accumulate
like a bunch of photos.

2783
02:30:54,600 --> 02:30:56,070
Didn't they do that to a hockey player?

2784
02:30:56,340 --> 02:31:00,450
I think there was like a hockey player
who was like kind of a famous because he

2785
02:31:00,451 --> 02:31:02,610
got in a brawl.
I don't remember the full story,

2786
02:31:02,790 --> 02:31:07,790
but a bunch of his teammates trolled him
with a fake account on my space and and

2787
02:31:08,101 --> 02:31:11,210
saved all his messages and then posted
it online or something like that.

2788
02:31:11,211 --> 02:31:14,430
That movie catfish is all about that.
Oh, is it really? I want his cat fish.

2789
02:31:14,431 --> 02:31:18,630
I heard a girl. No, it's not funny,
but no, no, no, not, not funny.

2790
02:31:18,660 --> 02:31:20,160
Good guy meets a girl

2791
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:21,570
online.
Do you ever have that problem?

2792
02:31:21,571 --> 02:31:24,630
We can say things are funny because
it was a comic. No, it's really funny.

2793
02:31:25,270 --> 02:31:28,380
If something's good. It's funny. How
does that funeral hilarious. It's funny.

2794
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:35,030
The guy meets girl in line on my space.
It starts going back and forth with her.

2795
02:31:35,031 --> 02:31:37,400
A Facebook goes back and forth with her,
goes back and forth with her,

2796
02:31:37,740 --> 02:31:40,110
and then he goes, and then his friends
are like, she doesn't, it's not real.

2797
02:31:40,111 --> 02:31:41,730
Let's go fucking finer.
Let's go find her.

2798
02:31:41,731 --> 02:31:44,530
And they go to find her and they go to
her mom's house in her mom's like, oh,

2799
02:31:44,550 --> 02:31:48,060
she's offered some friends. And they're
like, well, when will she be back?

2800
02:31:48,061 --> 02:31:50,010
And they're like, she's like,
oh, like in the weekend,

2801
02:31:50,760 --> 02:31:53,940
they can't get in touch with her. And
then his mom's like, she's in Rehab.

2802
02:31:54,030 --> 02:31:56,210
And she's like, really? And
he's like, yeah. And he's like,

2803
02:31:56,780 --> 02:31:59,310
there's something you don't wanna tell
me. By the way, if you've seen this,

2804
02:31:59,770 --> 02:32:04,610
haven't seen the movie. Stop listening
right now. Oh, then don't tell me anymore.

2805
02:32:04,620 --> 02:32:08,430
It's good. Oh, it's good. Scary. Yeah.

2806
02:32:08,820 --> 02:32:12,000
Don't say any more romantic.
Did you see red state? No.

2807
02:32:12,210 --> 02:32:14,310
You've got to see red state.
That's, you know, there's a movie.

2808
02:32:14,311 --> 02:32:17,730
That's a very interesting case
where, uh, I went to see it.

2809
02:32:18,450 --> 02:32:21,450
I really recommended it very highly.
It's a Kevin Smith's movie.

2810
02:32:21,451 --> 02:32:24,030
They're really takes you for a loop.
Totally didn't expect it.

2811
02:32:24,031 --> 02:32:25,260
I thought it was going to be a comedy.

2812
02:32:25,570 --> 02:32:30,350
Redstate is with Bruce Willis.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2813
02:32:30,360 --> 02:32:33,710
That's the one with Tracy Morgan.
You're thinking of the cop movie. Oh No,

2814
02:32:33,711 --> 02:32:36,210
I was thinking more that Helen Mirren
and, and all of them. No, no, no.

2815
02:32:36,211 --> 02:32:40,860
Red State is a new movie that I'm Kevin
Smith made and he released it on his

2816
02:32:40,861 --> 02:32:44,820
own. He did the whole thing on
his own, shut off. He's like,

2817
02:32:44,821 --> 02:32:49,440
he's putting it in just a few theaters
so it can be considered for Oscar

2818
02:32:49,441 --> 02:32:51,630
nominations for,
especially from Michael Parks.

2819
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:55,740
He's the guy who plays this incredibly
places preacher in the movie.

2820
02:32:56,670 --> 02:33:00,030
But uh, it's an interesting,
I fucking loved it, man.

2821
02:33:00,031 --> 02:33:01,140
I thought it was a great movie,

2822
02:33:01,141 --> 02:33:05,240
but like I look at the ratings
online 6.5 out of 10 and uh,

2823
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:07,740
I talked to a lot of people and a lot
of people loved it and a lot of people

2824
02:33:07,741 --> 02:33:11,440
didn't like it at all. Really? Yeah, I was
shocked. What, what's the premise? Well,

2825
02:33:11,530 --> 02:33:13,260
it's kind of a convoluted premise,

2826
02:33:13,261 --> 02:33:15,480
but it's all about religious people
without giving away too much.

2827
02:33:15,481 --> 02:33:19,270
It's all about crazy religious people and
you know, and the fucking chaos ensues.

2828
02:33:19,350 --> 02:33:22,950
Gunfire and just, it's like, I
fucking love it. I love those.

2829
02:33:23,070 --> 02:33:26,550
It's a very terantin no asking movie,
you know, it's a very, you know,

2830
02:33:26,551 --> 02:33:28,590
you never know what the fuck
is going to happen movie.

2831
02:33:28,770 --> 02:33:31,590
And I enjoy the shit out of it.
What's your opinion, everyone?

2832
02:33:31,610 --> 02:33:34,730
I've been curious about the Hank
Williams junior with Emma, uh,

2833
02:33:34,860 --> 02:33:37,320
Monday night football debacle. Look, man,

2834
02:33:37,321 --> 02:33:39,360
people compare someone
to Hitler all the time,

2835
02:33:39,361 --> 02:33:43,350
but when you're on Monday night fucking
football and you start comparing,

2836
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:46,680
you know,
republican playing golf with Obama,

2837
02:33:46,890 --> 02:33:51,480
like Hitler playing golf with Benjamin
Netanyahu, that's, that's first of all,

2838
02:33:51,481 --> 02:33:56,190
it's a weak sentence. You
know, like that's a stupid
thing to say. It's dumb. Like,

2839
02:33:56,191 --> 02:34:00,700
why would you, you know,
really that's the best.

2840
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:03,750
Yeah, it's, it's, it's, you're trying,
he's trying to go for a bold statement,

2841
02:34:03,751 --> 02:34:07,700
but yeah, it's not saying
shit. Come on. I mean it's,

2842
02:34:07,750 --> 02:34:12,330
it's just too stupid and you're trying,
and here's the thing,

2843
02:34:12,331 --> 02:34:13,410
if he had just used a,

2844
02:34:13,411 --> 02:34:17,010
it's like Martin Luther King playing
with a negative person. I don't,

2845
02:34:17,170 --> 02:34:18,010
he should be fired.
I

2846
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:21,130
think they're ridiculous.
I think, you know, if they
should look at it and go, well,

2847
02:34:21,131 --> 02:34:23,160
you know, he could say,
he should just say,

2848
02:34:23,410 --> 02:34:25,580
sorry I said that and that
would should be the end of it.

2849
02:34:25,590 --> 02:34:28,810
Should be their mom is not a bad guy.
He just said something that was dumb,

2850
02:34:29,080 --> 02:34:31,600
you know, I mean, he's
probably a tea party dude.

2851
02:34:31,601 --> 02:34:33,340
He's probably a conservative Republican.

2852
02:34:33,341 --> 02:34:36,190
I mean he's a country boy can survive guy,
you know.

2853
02:34:36,191 --> 02:34:39,770
So he probably thinks in his had
bet if he sat down, you know,

2854
02:34:39,771 --> 02:34:42,880
if somebody like fucking Christopher
Hitchens sat down with him and had him,

2855
02:34:42,881 --> 02:34:45,610
him break down what he sees
wrong with the, you know,

2856
02:34:45,611 --> 02:34:48,670
Obama and this administration
and its involvement overseas,

2857
02:34:48,850 --> 02:34:52,510
I bet every single fucking point would
get debunked and it would fall apart

2858
02:34:52,511 --> 02:34:53,630
right in front of his face have,

2859
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:55,030
I bet he doesn't know what
the fuck he's talking about.

2860
02:34:55,030 --> 02:34:58,240
But it's fashionable right now to say
that this country is falling apart because

2861
02:34:58,241 --> 02:35:01,900
of Obama. One fucking asshole. I don't
even know the guy's name, nor do I care.

2862
02:35:01,901 --> 02:35:05,470
But he was on Fox News talking about
how Obama has done more to hurt this

2863
02:35:05,471 --> 02:35:05,831
country.

2864
02:35:05,831 --> 02:35:10,831
The nine 11 it was the dumbest
statement ever because then he goes,

2865
02:35:11,560 --> 02:35:16,210
you know, if we could have had total
victory, if we were allowed to,

2866
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:20,020
you know, you know, when, when nine
11 happened, you know, it happened.

2867
02:35:20,021 --> 02:35:23,200
But then we went after them and we
went after them. We wouldn't have to,

2868
02:35:23,201 --> 02:35:25,810
who the fucking Iraqis
had nothing to do with it.

2869
02:35:25,811 --> 02:35:29,200
The innocent Iraqis are the
innocent Afghanis who had
nothing to do with nine 11

2870
02:35:29,201 --> 02:35:33,760
like what the fuck are you talking about?
You can say shit like that on TV still.

2871
02:35:33,761 --> 02:35:36,550
You can say shit like that,
but you can't call Obama Hitler.

2872
02:35:36,910 --> 02:35:40,910
You can't knock 11th in the
next like really bad word
though. It's like shocking.

2873
02:35:41,210 --> 02:35:45,030
This yogurt is nine 11 fuck get. Yeah, he,

2874
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:47,590
I think he's totally crossed
the line but he's a moron.

2875
02:35:47,980 --> 02:35:52,180
He crossed the line on a moron. You know,
it's a, it's the, it's a more on premise,

2876
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:55,720
you know, the premise of this one guy
is the one responsible for, you know,

2877
02:35:55,750 --> 02:35:59,230
more bad things than September 11th and
then he had some fucking crazy thing he

2878
02:35:59,231 --> 02:36:03,400
was saying about self reliance and I'm
no fan of this administration or any

2879
02:36:03,401 --> 02:36:07,490
administration, but I'm also not a fan
of people saying stupid Shit, you know?

2880
02:36:07,790 --> 02:36:11,950
You know what I mean? That's stupid
shit. Is it though? You know,

2881
02:36:11,951 --> 02:36:12,900
now that I think about it,

2882
02:36:12,930 --> 02:36:16,330
if he really wants to talk about what
America has done overseas, you know,

2883
02:36:16,331 --> 02:36:20,310
maybe I guess if you want to talk about
just volume of people killed, you know,

2884
02:36:20,320 --> 02:36:23,720
but you can't attribute that
all to Obama was the, yeah.

2885
02:36:24,250 --> 02:36:26,950
Do you get to a certain point where
you, I mean, how old do you know?

2886
02:36:27,070 --> 02:36:30,850
38 38 do you get to a certain point when
you look at guys like Obama and you go,

2887
02:36:30,851 --> 02:36:34,510
well that's guys just a few fucking
years older than me. You know, this is,

2888
02:36:34,511 --> 02:36:38,770
this is like, this is like my age.
People my age are running this,

2889
02:36:38,771 --> 02:36:42,490
this whole thing and who the fuck are
they? You know, and it ha, what is this?

2890
02:36:42,550 --> 02:36:45,010
I started doing that when I, when
people would leave my shows and I say,

2891
02:36:45,011 --> 02:36:47,740
thank you sir. When they'd
say great show. And then I go,

2892
02:36:47,741 --> 02:36:50,680
I'm fucking older than them.
Assert to, yeah, I'm a fucking sir.

2893
02:36:50,740 --> 02:36:52,030
And then I started thinking,
man,

2894
02:36:52,300 --> 02:36:57,040
my friends are like my friends or have
had great jobs, lost a, lost her house,

2895
02:36:57,041 --> 02:36:59,830
and then got good jobs to get.
Like my friends are grownups,

2896
02:37:00,160 --> 02:37:03,970
but I'm fucking child still. Yeah, but
you're allowed to be, you're a comedian,

2897
02:37:03,971 --> 02:37:08,470
you're an entertainer. Yeah,
100% I'm totally like, you know,

2898
02:37:08,471 --> 02:37:10,150
I'm 100% of responses,

2899
02:37:10,151 --> 02:37:12,730
but you know how you like look at
when you look at politicians, man,

2900
02:37:12,731 --> 02:37:14,590
don't you look at him as
being something different?

2901
02:37:14,591 --> 02:37:16,730
I always look them as being older,
wiser,

2902
02:37:16,910 --> 02:37:19,250
more experienced, more
educated, more this, more that.

2903
02:37:19,490 --> 02:37:21,800
But then as you get older and you realize,

2904
02:37:21,890 --> 02:37:26,210
well now I'm the same fucking age as
them. You know, Obama was a guy, the guy,

2905
02:37:26,270 --> 02:37:28,850
the guy that pulled the nice
secretary of of the side,

2906
02:37:28,851 --> 02:37:31,700
I'm sure his first day and was like,
just tell me who to shake hands with.

2907
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:35,360
Just like everyone else. I mean, he's
a regular fucking dude. Maybe. I mean,

2908
02:37:35,380 --> 02:37:37,210
I don't believe that necessarily.
You think it's,

2909
02:37:37,340 --> 02:37:40,400
I don't think you can get to that
high level unless you're compromised.

2910
02:37:40,680 --> 02:37:45,490
I'm over exaggerating the statement, but
I'm saying he's like one of us. Like if,

2911
02:37:45,740 --> 02:37:48,290
if you get a job at a new place and
they put you in your new office and the

2912
02:37:48,291 --> 02:37:50,810
secretary comes in, she's like, would
you like coffee? He's like, look,

2913
02:37:50,811 --> 02:37:55,370
it's my first day. Like he was, he had to
be like that to whoever his advisor was,

2914
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:57,380
right. You know, when they
started unloading shit,

2915
02:37:57,570 --> 02:38:01,370
he's like a guy that you can
relate to in a sense. 100%. Well,

2916
02:38:01,371 --> 02:38:04,490
I feel like anybody 10 years younger than
me and 10 years older than me in that

2917
02:38:04,491 --> 02:38:07,280
group, I can relate to
you. I know 10 years ago,

2918
02:38:07,281 --> 02:38:09,920
I remember that very well and I
can imagine 10 years from now,

2919
02:38:09,921 --> 02:38:14,120
so I can relate to that. But I don't,
when you, as I get to, uh, an older age,

2920
02:38:14,121 --> 02:38:16,300
like where I am right now, when
I look at it, I'm going to go to,

2921
02:38:16,310 --> 02:38:19,070
I can't relate to any of these fucks.
And these aren't really neat.

2922
02:38:19,100 --> 02:38:23,390
They don't represent me. These are, these
are crazy people. You know, their, their,

2923
02:38:23,391 --> 02:38:26,150
their spokesperson for corporations.
I don't know who fucking said this,

2924
02:38:26,151 --> 02:38:30,190
but it was a brilliant line that, uh,
I, for some comics had this, that um,

2925
02:38:30,590 --> 02:38:34,190
politicians should be forced to wear
jackets like Nascar drivers so you could

2926
02:38:34,191 --> 02:38:37,550
see their sponsors. Oh, that's fucking
brilliant. It's fucking brilliant.

2927
02:38:37,580 --> 02:38:42,530
I Dunno who it was. Whoever it was,
it said that bravo sir or ma'am,

2928
02:38:42,560 --> 02:38:44,630
but you're trying to relate.
You're trying to relate to them on,

2929
02:38:44,631 --> 02:38:48,170
on age and when in fact it's not,
it's not age,

2930
02:38:48,171 --> 02:38:51,800
it's just a kid's mindset. I know.
You're totally right. I, Ronald Reagan,

2931
02:38:51,890 --> 02:38:56,220
perfect example. I was the president. He
was the president. He's like a fucking,

2932
02:38:56,320 --> 02:38:57,830
he was like 60 years old or something,

2933
02:38:57,831 --> 02:38:59,900
whatever it was when he was a
president and you saw him on TV.

2934
02:38:59,901 --> 02:39:03,710
Like that's a wise guy who's been
around and he's taken a bullet.

2935
02:39:03,740 --> 02:39:06,140
He's fucking can ride a horse,
he can make a fence.

2936
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:10,160
And then when he got in trouble with
selling arms to Iran, I remember that.

2937
02:39:10,161 --> 02:39:12,290
I remember when he was like,
I don't remember.

2938
02:39:12,291 --> 02:39:14,750
I don't recall when it was like all
that on TV. And everyone's saying, well,

2939
02:39:14,751 --> 02:39:17,990
Ronald Reagan maybe losing his mind.
He's an older guy and then he did,

2940
02:39:18,500 --> 02:39:21,260
but how bizarre was that when he
was on TV saying, I don't remember.

2941
02:39:21,650 --> 02:39:23,400
I don't recall.
Do you think he really didn't really?

2942
02:39:23,401 --> 02:39:26,660
Do you think Alzheimer's is kicking in?
Of course he had Alzheimer's.

2943
02:39:26,690 --> 02:39:29,700
Did he have it then the only
disease that doesn't make your rib,

2944
02:39:30,380 --> 02:39:32,840
I think between Nancy Reagan
and all the shit he knew,

2945
02:39:33,110 --> 02:39:35,180
it was probably just a
convenient way to check out.

2946
02:39:35,330 --> 02:39:37,220
I wonder if he just faked his Alzheimer's.

2947
02:39:40,370 --> 02:39:42,230
He said, you know what? I know too much.

2948
02:39:42,290 --> 02:39:45,590
The best way to get out of this and just
pretend like I'm fucking losing grip.

2949
02:39:46,100 --> 02:39:48,860
That's the best thing that I wrote.
We wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

2950
02:39:48,861 --> 02:39:52,730
Let's get the cheeks. Wait, let
me go back to Ronald Reagan.

2951
02:39:52,880 --> 02:39:56,870
Faking all the gym. Imagine Nancy
Reagan said, just say no. Just say no.

2952
02:39:56,871 --> 02:39:59,890
Just say no. He's like, okay, okay.
Okay. Okay. I heard you. I heard you.

2953
02:39:59,910 --> 02:40:03,440
What's your name again? I heard you. Who
are you? Who are you? Why are you here?

2954
02:40:04,190 --> 02:40:06,950
Where's my pudding? He shows up at the
front door in his pajamas. He's like,

2955
02:40:06,951 --> 02:40:09,630
Ronald, did you get it out
of the house again? And he's
like, I was banging bowser.

2956
02:40:09,650 --> 02:40:14,420
But yeah. Did you sell arms
to Iran? I don't know. Did
I don't recall. You should.

2957
02:40:14,760 --> 02:40:17,100
We should eat showrooms or go
to the Ronald Reagan Museum.

2958
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:21,020
There was a guy named Janie tingle
when I was a standup comedy,

2959
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:22,590
very famous,

2960
02:40:22,650 --> 02:40:26,670
very respected comic from Boston back
in 1988 I was just starting out doing

2961
02:40:26,671 --> 02:40:30,180
comedy and I was an open miker and this
was just when the scandal was breaking

2962
02:40:30,190 --> 02:40:34,350
and he went on stage and he
goes, Mr President, he goes,

2963
02:40:34,470 --> 02:40:39,270
Lord knows I've forgotten some things I've
done. You know, he get home, you Hamad,

2964
02:40:39,271 --> 02:40:41,040
you can't find your fucking keys.

2965
02:40:41,041 --> 02:40:44,370
You know why your windows are open
and the air conditioning's on and it's

2966
02:40:44,371 --> 02:40:48,930
January. And he goes, but here's
just, just a little thing.

2967
02:40:49,650 --> 02:40:53,130
If you ever sell arms
to people who hate us,

2968
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:56,700
jot it down and

2969
02:40:58,340 --> 02:41:00,660
make a little note.
Put it on your refrigerator.

2970
02:41:00,890 --> 02:41:04,230
When I remember at the time I was like,
like that is standup comedy.

2971
02:41:04,260 --> 02:41:08,430
Like what that guy he just nailed that
is the essence of standup comedy on there

2972
02:41:08,500 --> 02:41:11,310
isn't a sense though
cause he drew the picture

2973
02:41:11,880 --> 02:41:13,030
doing he impression of him.

2974
02:41:13,300 --> 02:41:17,640
I pictured a two story Boston flower
with the Windows Open and the keys and I

2975
02:41:17,641 --> 02:41:20,710
might have even made up although I
don't remember the bit but those,

2976
02:41:20,711 --> 02:41:24,730
that's how those guys worked back then
and then you know like cause what the

2977
02:41:24,731 --> 02:41:27,670
best part of that joke is is at the end
you're like what's the point I'm going

2978
02:41:27,671 --> 02:41:30,330
to be write it down, write
it, jot it down. The way

2979
02:41:31,050 --> 02:41:33,510
fucking brilliant.
That is that is stand up right.

2980
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:35,910
It's like having making a
point and having it be funny.

2981
02:41:36,310 --> 02:41:40,960
How did you get me from a to B
in a way? This leaky way? Yeah.

2982
02:41:41,010 --> 02:41:44,280
You sneak it in to just make it
a little raindrop and effect.

2983
02:41:44,580 --> 02:41:47,350
I centered more in deposition.
Did you make a range?

2984
02:41:47,530 --> 02:41:50,580
Cause my cameraman on these beers this
entire time and I was just on your

2985
02:41:50,590 --> 02:41:54,510
nipples. What do you worry about that
stack of fucking beers in front of you?

2986
02:41:54,540 --> 02:41:57,690
It's for telling. It's telling
her it's nothing, right? No,

2987
02:41:57,700 --> 02:42:01,470
it was for nothing wrong with it, but
nothing. It's nothing wrong with it.

2988
02:42:01,471 --> 02:42:05,610
I told you it's worth it, but booze is
good. I have a card I need to give you.

2989
02:42:05,611 --> 02:42:08,250
The doctor will help you out a card.

2990
02:42:10,310 --> 02:42:11,490
We're indoctrinating you.

2991
02:42:13,880 --> 02:42:16,200
He's pretending that
this is an intervention.

2992
02:42:16,230 --> 02:42:20,130
He's pretending you gotta pee Brian.
Okay, Brian, why don't you go pee then?

2993
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:23,300
I've already peed once. I'm tired of
being kind of a little girl. I gotta pee.

2994
02:42:23,590 --> 02:42:26,490
I gotta pee three. Should we just
end this thing or drink or pis?

2995
02:42:26,780 --> 02:42:27,613
Oh,

2996
02:42:29,850 --> 02:42:31,920
I have way too much pitch is

2997
02:42:31,940 --> 02:42:35,750
p. Wow. Brian, that's gay. It's
one thing to drink your own pee.

2998
02:42:36,050 --> 02:42:40,010
It's another thing to drink somebody
else's. That's, that's out of line.

2999
02:42:40,460 --> 02:42:44,240
Um, what's going on? Bert? Where are you
this weekend? Where can you plug 'em in?

3000
02:42:44,241 --> 02:42:48,400
Phoenix. Phoenix. Stand up
live. That's that giant place,
Huh? Yeah. I haven't been.

3001
02:42:48,420 --> 02:42:52,190
How many pieces? How many people does
that seat for me? Probably one 50 a shell.

3002
02:42:53,630 --> 02:42:57,230
That's a giant ass fucking place.
Yeah. I heard everyone loves it.

3003
02:42:57,290 --> 02:43:01,760
I think it's like gold standard.
Yeah. The Guy who owns the, uh,

3004
02:43:01,790 --> 02:43:05,570
West Palm Impromptu call Miami and Fort
Lauderdale. Yeah. He owns a lot of them.

3009
02:43:19,241 --> 02:43:22,360

New Year's eve.

3010
02:43:22,390 --> 02:43:25,750
But we're doing all the way up

3015

Saturday and Sunday with
Joey Diaz and Brendan Walsh,

3016
02:43:47,590 --> 02:43:50,950
and we're fired up bitches and
it's almost sold out every,

3017
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:55,420
and they get back from Austin, made it
back. You made it back. He fell asleep.

3018
02:43:55,421 --> 02:43:57,670
Poor Brendon cried.
I tried to wake him up.

3019
02:43:57,671 --> 02:43:59,740
We were out drinking the
night before and listen man,

3020
02:43:59,770 --> 02:44:02,650
you got to fucking keep a five
hour energy drink on standby.

3021
02:44:03,130 --> 02:44:05,950
You gotta throw cold water on your face.
You've got to pack before you go to bed.

3022
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:07,240
Don't try to lie down.

3023
02:44:07,241 --> 02:44:10,090
Don't try to lie down and then wake up
five minutes before and throw your shit

3024
02:44:10,091 --> 02:44:12,700
in it. You'll never do it. You've got
to know how to learn how to travel.

3025
02:44:12,810 --> 02:44:14,170
You've got to learn how to learn.
Anyway,

3026
02:44:14,171 --> 02:44:16,900
Brendan's here and he'll be with us

3030
02:44:25,781 --> 02:44:29,770
an author we're going to do and talk
about the power of the placebo effect.

3031
02:44:29,771 --> 02:44:34,360
That should be very interesting
to say. Posey. Um, Brian,

3032
02:44:34,361 --> 02:44:38,770
