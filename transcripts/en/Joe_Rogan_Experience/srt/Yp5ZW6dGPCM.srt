1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,680
how much of a real issue is it when
people get fat is mold or just knocks fat?

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,390
Fat itself isn't being fat itself.

4
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:11,730
How much of an effect is being overweight?

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,630
It has a big effect,

6
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:13,260
right?

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,670
That's less of a a two actually.

8
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:16,020
It can be triggered by toxins,

9
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:17,970
but it's more of a metabolic energy thing.

10
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:19,650
And that's the other side of what I do.

11
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,040
Uh,

12
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,450
with the supplements that I make,

13
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:22,950
it's,

14
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,170
it's about increasing
mitochondrial function.

15
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,820
And if you have a fueling problem in
energy management problem in your body and

16
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,320
being fat as a great sign of that,

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,020
you need to figure out why
and you need to correct it.

18
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,880
Because when your body works well,

19
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,900
you shouldn't be fat.

20
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,380
Have you noticed this trend where you're
not supposed to bring up the fact that

21
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:42,510
people are fat and it's
called fat shaming?

22
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,280
Have we seen this?

23
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,890
I've seen some things
on Facebook discussing,

24
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,170
discussing fat or even better celebrating
the fact that you're thin is fat

25
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:52,224
shaming.

26
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,130
Wow.

27
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,890
There was a woman fucking people.

28
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,010
What about thin shaming?

29
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,221
Well,

30
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:56,821
you know what it is,

31
00:00:56,821 --> 00:00:57,061
man.

32
00:00:57,061 --> 00:01:00,240
It's just people trying to find some sort
of an excuse for why they are the way

33
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:04,950
they are and then the excuse to continue
to be the way they are without feeling

34
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:07,770
any repercussions from
socially from other people.

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,700
This is a woman,

36
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,481
she had this picture,

37
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:10,440
she put it on Facebook,

38
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,191
it's her.

39
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:13,290
She's in a bikini show or like a little,

40
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,651
you know,

41
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:15,630
one of those little crossfit
outfits or something like that,

42
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,520
and she has her three kids there.

43
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:17,971
Oh,

44
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:19,950
I saw that picture and the picture says,

45
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,570
what's your excuse?

46
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,030
And people were saying,

47
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:25,050
you're fat shaming.

48
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,280
A lot of people have different lives,

49
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:29,940
like whether or not someone
has a different life and
whether or not someone has

50
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,080
a different issue with their body,

51
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,760
that's not what she's saying.

52
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,481
She's saying,

53
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:34,261
what's your excuse?

54
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,090
Because this is what
she's been able to do.

55
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,170
You're right.

56
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,040
Everybody's different.

57
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,641
You're right.

58
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,630
Some people have a bad situation
that they're in financially.

59
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,460
Some people have bad genetics,

60
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:47,130
some people they've been taught poorly.

61
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,690
Whatever diseases,

62
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,853
all the above.

63
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,450
But that's not fat shaming.

64
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,730
She's celebrating the
fact that she's thin.

65
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,500
You know,

66
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:54,980
and this,

67
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,980
this fat shaming thing that people love
to say now is it completely alleviates

68
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:03,390
any responsibility you have
for your own physical shape.

69
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,980
It's like they want it.

70
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:09,981
They want to take it out of the equation
that that social aspect of being fat,

71
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,790
like there's a reason for it.

72
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,490
The reason for it is
it's not healthy for you.

73
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:15,324
There's the girl.

74
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,620
If you look at that picture up there,

75
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:17,401
what's your excuse?

76
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:18,234
Yeah,

77
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,640
but either there's a reason why that
exists is because people see what you're

78
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:26,610
doing and they don't like the way it
looks on you because they're scared of it

79
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:27,510
being on them.

80
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,300
When someone sees a in
a morbidly obese person,

81
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,510
the reason why they're staring,

82
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:33,090
he's not going to try
to shame that person.

83
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,220
It's a natural freak out.

84
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,810
Your body recognizes,

85
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,673
oh shit,

86
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,180
that's possible too.

87
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,380
I could do that.

88
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,011
God down.

89
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:41,970
I better not do that.

90
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,960
I don't want to do that.

91
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,561
That guy looks,

92
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:44,490
it looks awful.

93
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:44,851
Oh my God,

94
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:45,720
that guy's going to die.

95
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,130
That's not fat shaming.

96
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,190
That's a natural thing that people do
with a recognize success and failure in

97
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:57,450
their environment and that success and
failure is as much social success and

98
00:02:57,451 --> 00:03:00,310
failure as it is physiological health.

99
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,860
If you see someone that's super unhealthy,

100
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,440
coughing and smoking a cigarette,

101
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,520
that feeling is not
cigarette smoking shaming,

102
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,450
okay?

103
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,770
That feeling is you're recognizing that
someone is doing something incredibly

104
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:17,830
unhealthy and that possibility
exists for you too.

105
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,730
Here's,

106
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,241
here's the thing,

107
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:19,600
Joe,

108
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,750
that feeling is not a rational response.

109
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,900
It's a self defense system in the body
that happens before you even think about

110
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:26,230
it.

111
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,710
This is the body going like,

112
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,270
like naturally animals don't want to
spend time with other sick animals either.

113
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:34,600
Like they'll move away from the
sick ones and when we see someone,

114
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,643
when our body,

115
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,000
our meat operating systems,

116
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:37,751
see someone who is sick,

117
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,190
we naturally want to create space.

118
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,780
But here's the thing,

119
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:41,980
so I weighed 300 pounds.

120
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:44,290
I was fat for like half of
my life and let me tell you,

121
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,480
every fat person on
earth knows they're fat.

122
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,870
They do not feel happy about it and
they desperately want to fix it,

123
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,310
but they don't want you
to rub it in their face.

124
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:51,941
Dave Asprey,

125
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,140
cause that's fat shaming.

126
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,630
You make me feel bad if
you show your six pack,

127
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,300
if you just pull that up
like 15 minutes a month,

128
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:01,660
pitch boom and show that
six pack on on Instagram,

129
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,930
you're fat shaming areas that could
fucking workout every morning,

130
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,500
an hour and a half a day.

131
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,550
Get yourself in shape,

132
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,240
take a picture and people will
be angry because they didn't.

133
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,800
That's amazing.

134
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,350
There will be that.

135
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,880
Sorry.

136
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,950
That's not what the scribe.

137
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,070
Well of course,

138
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:19,600
but they're saying you're fat shaming.

139
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,840
They're angry because they're trying
desperately stuff that doesn't work and

140
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:26,740
when it doesn't knock often there's
some people who just have given up.

141
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:27,760
I would say most,

142
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,210
I would say most people who are talking
about fat shaming or just stuffing

143
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:31,961
Twinkies down there,

144
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:32,770
fucking mug.

145
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,680
The people talking about fat
shaming have emotional issues,

146
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,700
I would guess,

147
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,950
but you ain't find support online.

148
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:40,390
That's what I find fascinating.

149
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,710
People agree with them.

150
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,020
The people that called
that woman a fat shamer.

151
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,960
There was a lot of them and she,

152
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,410
she had to apologize,

153
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,480
but she was disingenuous in your apology.

154
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,370
And I just,

155
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,130
I,

156
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,370
I feel a lot of compassion for she
explain why she just disingenuous.

157
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,860
She did some interview
where she was talking about,

158
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,310
you know,

159
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,450
like when she said,

160
00:04:58,451 --> 00:04:59,710
what's your excuse?

161
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,860
Like she can't came up with some sort
of a real softening down version of what

162
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:05,801
she meant by,

163
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:07,060
what's your excuse,

164
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:07,841
you know?

165
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,060
But what she meant is she's not fat.

166
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,391
Look,

167
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:11,020
I'm hot.

168
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,711
What's your excuse?

169
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,401
Here's my kids.

170
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:12,880
I'm a hot,

171
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,290
it's pretty obvious what she meant.

172
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,341
And she was like,

173
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:18,000
what's your excuse for not
meeting your goals or what?

174
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,200
I kind of get mad though,

175
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:23,260
when people say your excuses that you're
lazy and you're excuses that you didn't

176
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:26,380
work out enough and you didn't it
enough because I beat myself up.

177
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,580
I broke my metabolism,

178
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:29,740
I broke my thyroid gland
working out all the time,

179
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,461
eating a low fat,

180
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:33,670
low calorie diet and all it did
was make me fat and sick and tired.

181
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,870
Like it doesn't work.

182
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,500
So it,

183
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,220
it's,

184
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,790
it's really annoying when you get these
people who are genetically gifted have a

185
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,840
good metabolism and never got a chronic
illness or whatever the heck works.

186
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,360
So they could basically look
good without too much work.

187
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,480
And they stand up there and say,

188
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:47,860
you know,

189
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,910
you didn't do enough of this.

190
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:51,040
But when the fat people
try and go for a jog,

191
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:51,940
when you weigh 300 pounds,

192
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:52,720
he's trying to go for a jog.

193
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,620
It's destructive on your tissues so you
can all these fat people who are trying

194
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:59,840
and just failing miserably and feeling
bad about themselves cause they did it

195
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:01,190
because they got the wrong advice.

196
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,560
Like this is why I started just
putting some of this stuff up there.

197
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,030
I don't have to work,

198
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,170
I don't have food cravings,

199
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,020
all that stuff I had struggled
with like for a lot of my life.

200
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,480
It just isn't something I
have to think about anymore.

201
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,570
And it kind of upsets me when I see,

202
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:14,811
you know,

203
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:18,500
fat people who are feeling guilty and
like fighting all their willpower on

204
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:18,710
these,

205
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,000
on these cravings that cause like they're
doing it wrong but they don't know

206
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:25,010
they're doing it wrong so that then they
feel guilty and they get caught in all

207
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:26,990
this emotional stuff and
like it's unnecessary.

208
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,071
Yeah.

209
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:33,071
It seems like there's gotta be a way to
get healthy food to people and make it a

210
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:36,470
part of everyone's everyday diet.

211
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,310
But then you start considering the
numbers of people in Los Angeles and if

212
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,680
there's 20 million people,

213
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:42,981
again,

214
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:47,981
getting everybody grasp red beef and
getting everybody and see tea oil take

215
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,381
over.

216
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:50,180
Some golf courses are gonna
have to put cows on them.

217
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,290
Is that what they're going to have to do?

218
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,240
You can feed an awful lot of
cows and some of these grounds,

219
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:54,800
you're not going to stop
people from golfing.

220
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,360
It's too many rich dudes like golfing.

221
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,410
I needs to be a fast food company and
it just takes over and just starts doing

222
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:03,350
it because that's the biggest problem
is people just need fast food,

223
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,910
fast food.

224
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,743
Actually healthy.

225
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,920
There's a couple attempts.

226
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,120
There's a guy from,

227
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,510
uh,

228
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,500
one of the early wholefoods guys and some
Mcdonald's guys got together and like

229
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,150
they'll make something that's,

230
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:14,970
uh,

231
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,180
I,

232
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,700
I'm forgetting the name of
what they're trying to do,

233
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,260
but they'll make something
that's better than it was.

234
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:19,880
But is it going to be non GMO even?

235
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:21,590
Is it going to be gluten free now?

236
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:24,830
Probably not because we have to understand
the core tenants of what makes us

237
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:28,070
healthy and we have to understand those
widely before there's demand for them.

238
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:28,670
Uh,

239
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,330
so,

240
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,350
so the number one predictor for whether
you're going to be obese or not is your

241
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:34,184
income level.

242
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,180
The poorer you are,

243
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:36,020
the fatter you are.

244
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:39,410
That's especially true in America
and that's a food quality issue.

245
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,130
And it,

246
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,963
it's,

247
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,280
it's just not fair the way
things are set up that way.

248
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:44,690
But if you're poor,

249
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:47,050
you have a hard time getting food
that doesn't make you inflamed.

250
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,020
It doesn't break your insulin.

251
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:50,240
It doesn't contain things
that make you weak in it.

252
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,850
And like it's,

253
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:52,641
it's tragic.

254
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:53,331
It shouldn't be that way.

255
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:54,164
But that's how it is.

256
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,760
There's a blog I read about thin
privilege just to sit there.

257
00:07:58,761 --> 00:07:59,481
That's another thing.

258
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:01,490
That's another way of saying fat shaming.

259
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,960
The other side of saying fat shaming is
that being thin you are enjoying thin

260
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:09,770
privilege and that by
creating success and all that,

261
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,570
not just dating success but the way people
dress you and the way you move around

262
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:18,680
in society that you enjoy thin privilege
and what they're trying to do is

263
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:23,681
compare being in shape with being a
white male like white male privilege is

264
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,720
white male privilege is almost shameful.

265
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,291
You know,

266
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,590
it's almost shameful to have this white
male privilege while people are still,

267
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:30,981
it's,

268
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:32,120
it makes you feel,

269
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,900
uh,

270
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,531
like the,

271
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:33,860
the,

272
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,200
like if someone talks
about white male privilege,

273
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:40,450
what do you think of you think of
someone being aloof to the concerns of,

274
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,570
of Brown people and poor people and racism
and also allude to the fact that they

275
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:52,301
got super lucky they got this lucky roll
the dice and were born in this way that

276
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:54,980
allows them to be,

277
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,140
I mean if you think about white males
in thinking about white males and you

278
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:00,090
think about wealth,

279
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,750
majority of the like super
wealthy people are white males.

280
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,390
The majority of the people
that are in positions of power,

281
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:07,320
whether it's presidents,

282
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,100
mayor,

283
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,933
white males,

284
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,940
so that white male being a white
male and having that privilege,

285
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:13,260
it's almost like being in a pig.

286
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,350
It's like being the man so thin privilege.

287
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,540
They haven't figured out
a way to make being thin,

288
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,374
being a pig

289
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,910
that is so thin,

290
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,391
privileged,

291
00:09:23,391 --> 00:09:24,240
not I'm fat,

292
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,760
not on lazy food.

293
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,990
Like just you know,

294
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:31,350
re re I didn't re renaming words
to mean something different.

295
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:31,720
Yes,

296
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,670
it's a little bit of that,

297
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,540
but it's also,

298
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,290
it's um,

299
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,190
you pulled up the blog,

300
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:35,371
right?

301
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:36,450
Brian did you pull up one of the ones?

302
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,550
It's also alleviating themselves a
personal responsibility and finding a new

303
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:42,810
victim or a new,

304
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,910
a new culprit and the culprit is not their
own lack of self respect or their own

305
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:52,920
willpower or their own ability
to discipline themselves
or their own ability to

306
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:55,740
educate themselves on proper
nutrition that's out of the equation.

307
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,810
It's no longer their responsibility.

308
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:01,080
Now instead they'll concentrate
on thin people having,

309
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:01,740
uh,

310
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,310
an acid fits in an actual
airplane seat and you know,

311
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,880
being able to squeeze
on an actual escalator,

312
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,301
you know,

313
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:10,320
all of these things,

314
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,530
these fat fucks are complaining
about and calling thin privilege.

315
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,700
You've got knock willpower.

316
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,450
That list,

317
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:20,130
there is no lack of will power and fat
people willpower's a finite resource.

318
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:20,821
You have so much.

319
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,470
You can we prove this beyond a doubt.

320
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,880
What do you mean willpower?

321
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,440
There's a whole book about this now,

322
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:27,840
and I'm of course for getting
the name of the author,

323
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,020
but they actually show that there's
so many decisions you can make.

324
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:32,220
I wrote about this a while back,

325
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:35,370
there's decision making fatigue and
there's x amount of willpower and you can

326
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:36,870
apply that willpower to change the world.

327
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,900
Or you can apply that willpower to say
no to the bullet chips in front of you.

328
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:40,950
Right?

329
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,590
And if you're a fat person and
your energy reserves are low,

330
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:45,150
and I say this from personal experience,

331
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,590
the amount of willpower it takes to get
up off the couch and walk across the

332
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:50,940
street and do whatever you're going to do,

333
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,780
it requires a hell of a lot more power,

334
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,850
more willpower.

335
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,480
Then you would think it would as a
healthy person because your cells aren't

336
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:57,751
working,

337
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:58,650
you don't have the energy,

338
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:01,740
and yet you get up and you do it in
every step you take is sapping your

339
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:03,720
willpower in a way a
healthy person doesn't have.

340
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,621
Oh,

341
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:05,370
I see what you're saying.

342
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,370
So you're saying that even though
willpower is sort of an individual

343
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:12,430
characteristic and some people having,

344
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,290
some people don't.

345
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,970
With fat people,

346
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:17,360
it's almost like a catch 22 because the,

347
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:19,590
although they need it to drop away,

348
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,100
they're not going to have it because
they needed to just move around.

349
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:27,120
Their energy levels are lower so they
have less willpower and they're using the

350
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:29,880
willpower to do simple things
that are effortless for you.

351
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:31,620
And it's not effortless for a fat person.

352
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,740
That is such an interesting point and
one that I really didn't consider.

353
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,690
That's a very unique point because I
never really considered that fat people

354
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,390
like,

355
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,990
it's almost like they
can't help themselves.

356
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,720
It's almost like there's so we'll,

357
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:49,400
or it's so much more difficult for them
to pass on shitty food than it is a

358
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,220
regular person.

359
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,401
Well,

360
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:51,300
think of it like this.

361
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:51,841
Okay.

362
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:52,980
If you're a regular person,

363
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,270
that's thin privilege.

364
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,340
Alright,

365
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,970
so people are real people.

366
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,330
So now it's a trainee thing.

367
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,320
Let's pretend that you're a fat person,

368
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:02,640
Joe,

369
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:02,800
and,

370
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,150
and we have a Bagel sitting here.

371
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:04,540
Okay,

372
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:04,841
good luck.

373
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:05,890
Pretend to bitch.

374
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,173
Sorry.

375
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:08,890
Can't help myself.

376
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,390
So the jokes,

377
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:13,300
they're the bagels can be talking
to you over and over and say,

378
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:15,340
eat me and it healthy person says,

379
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,890
I don't actually have a
craving like fuck you Bagel.

380
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,520
Right?

381
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,480
But if you're a tech guy,

382
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:20,270
I love bagels.

383
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,190
If you're a fat person,

384
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:23,050
that Bagel is going to
constantly sit and go eat me,

385
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:23,321
eat me,

386
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:23,621
eat me.

387
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:25,330
And every time you say it consciously,

388
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:29,290
I'm not going to eat the Bagel you are
spending your willpower wantonly so every

389
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,160
time you see an ad for Mars on,

390
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:34,000
on TV now Mars bars or whatever
the heck the latest candy is,

391
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,860
and you're like,

392
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,060
God,

393
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,550
I've got to credit.

394
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,070
No.

395
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,700
So you spend your entire day saying
no to your biological systems that are

396
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:41,290
starving for energy.

397
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,350
And this is why you're not deplete it.

398
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,330
You're not lacking willpower.

399
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:49,570
You're wasting your willpower saying no
to foods that are calling out to you and

400
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:52,510
to biologically unnatural way cause
your energy systems are broken,

401
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,320
broken and you have less willpower then
you should have had because your cells

402
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:57,041
aren't functioning right.

403
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,120
Your hormones are broken.

404
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,600
So it never say that fat people are fat.

405
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:02,950
Because of a lack of willpower.

406
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,950
The fact that they're walking is
a testament to their willpower.

407
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,890
What they're lacking is knowledge
and they're lacking tools.

408
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:10,180
And when fat people have those things,

409
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,400
they immediately go and
they get thin again.

410
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,860
Okay.

411
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,960
But if that's the case,

412
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,880
then what makes someone go out of
their way and get that knowledge?

413
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,620
What makes someone changed their diet?

414
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,140
What makes someone make the difficult
steps to start going to a gym?

415
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,640
It's kind of willpower.

416
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,483
Dave Asprey.

417
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,440
There's,

418
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,390
there's definitely
willpower component to it,

419
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,200
but things like social support will
increase the amount of willpower you have.

420
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:35,710
Things like encouragement and also things
like like dying or being disabled or

421
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:38,500
finding a diabetic ulcer on your leg and
your doctor telling you you're going to

422
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:40,210
lose your leg if you
don't work your ass out.

423
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,170
That can temporarily increase willpower
enough that you get your cell cellular

424
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:45,040
energy kicked off.

425
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:45,430
Did.

426
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,330
I was reading a thing the other day,

427
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:47,691
it's just,

428
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:51,870
I've been railing on about this
lately about the idea of people are,

429
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:56,830
are going on about what they're calling
for fat shaming and fat shaming is

430
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:59,230
making people feel bad
for being overweight.

431
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,440
And I've read this one article where
this woman was talking about how she was

432
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:09,250
being fat shamed because she went to a
family function and everyone was gushing

433
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,360
about her cousin.

434
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,130
Her cousin lost 20 pounds and the that
they were making such a big deal out of

435
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:15,341
it,

436
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:19,840
that it was clear to her that they
were judging her for not losing the 20

437
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:20,141
pounds.

438
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:23,830
So it made her feel awful and she didn't
understand how they couldn't understand

439
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:25,720
that what they were doing
was fat shaming her,

440
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,890
complimenting someone on losing weight,

441
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:33,910
you're fat shaming the person who hasn't
lost the weight and that it made her

442
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:36,700
feel awful and that it was
incredibly insensitive of them.

443
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:37,180
And that,

444
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,013
you know,

445
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,140
I'm fascinated by that kind of thinking.

446
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:41,831
I really am.

447
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:43,450
I'm fascinated by that sort of like,

448
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,550
like reverse victimology sort of a thing
where instead of you being the victim

449
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:49,720
of your own handiwork,

450
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:54,721
you become like a persecuted
person because they don't
accept you for the flaws

451
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:59,450
that you have or even mentioned the
possibility of those flaws existing by

452
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:03,050
virtue of complimenting someone for
having gotten over the same flaws that you

453
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:03,884
possess.

454
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Polaris think without even knowing the
specifics on us on particular issues

455
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:09,920
anytime somebody is.

456
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:12,230
So we linked to embrace the victim role.

457
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:12,800
Uh,

458
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,150
his mouth traveled right away.

459
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,160
I'm like,

460
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,850
do you know there's a reality to losing
weight that we have this Dave Asprey guy

461
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:23,690
who's an expert in a lot
of aspects of nutrition.

462
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:26,540
He's a fascinating guy and one of the
things he was talking about where is he

463
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,870
was giving a overweight people a pass
because you're saying the level of

464
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:33,590
addiction that these people actually
have for food to say that they don't have

465
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:37,970
willpower is really unfair
because there are so overweight.

466
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:42,230
Like a lot of these folks are so far
gone that they used up all of their

467
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:46,700
willpower just to get up in the
morning just to walk to the bus stop,

468
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:47,210
just to go,

469
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:47,721
go to work,

470
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:48,620
just to get their,

471
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,370
their,

472
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,690
their chores done during the day.

473
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:55,280
Like they don't have the same level
of energy that a healthy person has.

474
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,350
So to tribute them to having like this,

475
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:02,330
there's this like backlog of energy than
not tapping into because they're weak

476
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:02,930
willed.

477
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,250
It's not that like they're,

478
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,020
they're already so far in the hole,

479
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,720
it's almost impossible for
them to get motivation.

480
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,020
They have to get something like
incredibly extreme has to happen to them.

481
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,800
And I thought that was really unique and
and looking at it that way I people to,

482
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,540
yes,

483
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,300
yes.

484
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,111
People out of shape.

485
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:18,944
People who are depressed,

486
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,460
you could see the in with people
that are ruining their life too,

487
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:23,750
whether it's through addictions,

488
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:23,931
you know,

489
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:25,040
you see that as well.

490
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,560
It's like why can't they see
it the way other people see it?

491
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,180
It's almost like they can't,

492
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,480
like they're so trapped up in
the momentum of whatever it is.

493
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,040
Whether it's gambling or food.

494
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:34,431
I mean,

495
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:37,940
I've seen people with food addictions
that you can watch the gears spinning in

496
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:39,500
their mind when food is near my,

497
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,720
like they know they're supposed to
lose weight and they know they're not

498
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:42,554
supposed to be eating it,

499
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,340
but the the gears start spinning in
their mind and that becomes the primary

500
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:47,570
focus of their existence.

501
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,910
Get that fucking doughnut.

502
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,840
I need that donut.

503
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,440
That donut is huge.

504
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:51,961
It's,

505
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:52,191
it's,

506
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:56,660
it's critical for fueling
whenever whatever it trouble
is going on in their mind

507
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:02,060
and it's a weird aspect of human beings
and you don't do that any favors by

508
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:07,061
pretending that encouraging someone
who lost weight is a bad thing.

509
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,420
The idea that socially
that's irresponsible because
you're fat and you're near

510
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:11,900
them.

511
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,141
No,

512
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:15,050
it's actually responsible because
that terrible feeling that you have,

513
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,970
it's supposed to be the bump that pushes
you towards eating a salad instead of a

514
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:23,720
cheeseburger should be the bump that
makes you write down everything you eat

515
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:25,490
that day and state some goals.

516
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,480
This is what I'm going to do.

517
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:29,990
I'm going to use my willpower to overcome
this horrible obsession that I have.

518
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:30,824
Was shitty food.

519
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,540
That's also possible.

520
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,660
It's also possible by,

521
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:38,090
by you going home and blaming everybody
in the blog that you've projected

522
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:41,510
yourself away from any potential
benefit from having these bad feelings.

523
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:41,841
Again,

524
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:42,760
he's the same as the amount.

525
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,680
The competition is somebody
who never learned how to lose,

526
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,220
and the same in a avoiding criticism
like you gotta you gotta look it.

527
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:49,410
It's a,

528
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,310
it feels like shit,

529
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,020
but that feel like shit.

530
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,970
Correct it so it doesn't
feel like shit anymore.
