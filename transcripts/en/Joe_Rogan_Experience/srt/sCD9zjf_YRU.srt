1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,900
Yes, we live Ben Shapiro. Hey,
how's it going dude? Very good.

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,800
How's it going with you man?
It's going well. I love you.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,540
I love the new day cause they haven't
been here since you finished it over and I

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,520
had walked in, I thought to myself,
I've been doing my business wrong.

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,640
I mean you got what?
Three employees? Yeah.

6
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:25,900
There's not that many folks working
on this. Yeah, I mean, yeah.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,130
So in my offices we have like 80 and
our offices are not nearly this cool.

8
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:33,790
So I'm going to go back to
my office and fire everyone.

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,510
Have your folks come in and design?

10
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:41,511
Because I mean it's either a lot of
people or I could have cars in my office.

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,130
Yeah, but you wouldn't go
down this route. You're,

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,440
you're a more of a conservative
gentleman. No, myself.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,030
[inaudible] you're wearing a suit jacket.
You're your own boss.

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,890
Nobody tells you how to dress and
get you dressed like a grownup.

15
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,530
Yeah. Well, you know, I won't pretend
that nobody tells me how to dress.

16
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,240
We have people who tell me how to dress.
We have people who do my hair.

17
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,260
Do you have all that stuff you have
like fashion folks? Because I used to,

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,200
I mean if you look at the old photos
of me, I have like the Hitler hair,

19
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:06,940
I've got like the, the hair,
that's the only thing about me,

20
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,860
the till area and was my
old hair and I've got that,

21
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,860
the hair that kind of comes down over
the forehead and I still walk into the

22
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:15,850
office wearing basically an undershirt
every day because I'm incredibly lazy

23
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:19,000
when it comes to that stuff. But we
to be able to, yeah, I mean that's,

24
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,380
that's the prerogative of being the boss.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,100
Maybe it'd be more relatable live you
showed up wearing like flip flops and tee

26
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:27,280
shirt. That kind of kills my brand
though. Now does it like it is your brand.

27
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:29,380
Exactly.
I thought it was being an asshole.

28
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,120
I think you're an asshole though. Thank
you. I appreciate it. It revert. Nice guy.

29
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,480
You're just conservative. That's the
dirty little secret though. Yeah.

30
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,140
We're not supposed to.
We're not supposed to talk about that.

31
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,590
But this is one of the things that
bothers me so much about you being so

32
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:45,290
misrepresented. When I read things
about you, there was a, the,

33
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,840
the article that we
were just talking about,

34
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:49,030
the alt right seeds without the rage,

35
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:51,640
they called you and you're not
even remotely alt right. In fact,

36
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:56,641
you were the leading target of
antisemetic abuse for all of 2016 are you?

37
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,570
Yeah, according to the Anti Defamation
League, which is no ally of mine. So yeah,

38
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,540
I mean,
I'm not only am I not outright,

39
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,540
I've spent the last four years like
legitimately battling the alt right,

40
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,580
talking about how evil,
I think their ideology is,

41
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:11,370
how evil I think white supremacy
he is. I mean, first of all,

42
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,790
like people at the Amika is typically
not the favorites of the alt right.

43
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,990
And then beyond that,
I mean,

44
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:20,991
I think their ideology is legitimately
a devastatingly awful twist on what

45
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:22,790
Western civilization is supposed to be.

46
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,190
It was amazing as a review of my new
book and my new book has several sections

47
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:28,050
and they're dedicated to how
terrible the outright is.

48
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,230
And then the interview they did with me.

49
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,280
It doesn't talk about
outright stuff at all,

50
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:34,410
but they just assume
I'm on the conservative.

51
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:37,620
Right and that must mean that I am all
outright and it's like no you stupid.

52
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,290
No problem with those labels,
disingenuous

53
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,320
people are labeling people in a very
simple manner to try to categorize them as

54
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:50,890
the enemy and instead of just addressing
these points like I love watching your

55
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,280
debates where you do Q and A's with
college students and with people in the

56
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:58,630
audience because you can see, you will
agree with you or disagree with you.

57
00:02:58,631 --> 00:03:00,340
You have well formulated ideas.

58
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:02,980
This isn't just some bullshit
that you're spouting out.

59
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:04,030
You thought these things through.

60
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,530
I've been doing this for
legitimately more than half my life.

61
00:03:06,531 --> 00:03:10,370
I'm 35 and I started when I was 17 and
I started writing a syndicated column at

62
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:13,700
that point and when you're 17 you think
a lot of dumb stuff and then sure we get

63
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:17,210
older and you educate yourself and you
spend a lot of time reading and a lot of

64
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:18,044
time studying.

65
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,800
Hopefully you have some cogent arguments
after 20 years of doing anything.

66
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,670
I mean, but it's the, the demonization
is pretty astonishing. I mean,

67
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,090
we had an on Andrew Yang,

68
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,930
he's the only Democratic candidate who
has agreed to go on the Sunday special

69
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:32,900
that I do. We did a full hour
on ubi. It was perfectly nice.

70
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:37,280
It was perfectly coherent
and, and, and conciliatory.

71
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:41,450
And yet people will suggest
that everything I do is
about destroying people on

72
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:44,250
the other side because of all the Ben
Shapiro destroys videos and all that kind

73
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:44,560
of stuff.
Yeah.

74
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,920
There's, there are certain groups of
people where that's their shtick there.

75
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:52,530
Like they're goons, right? They just go
after people online for attention. Yes.

76
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,980
This is a stick. This is not you.
And this is what bothers me so much.

77
00:03:56,981 --> 00:04:00,490
And I know that you've said some things
in the past like particularly about

78
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:03,130
Arabs and like when you were
a younger man that you said,

79
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,690
I shouldn't have said that. Yeah, that's
exactly right. That's exactly right.

80
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:08,390
Some of those things were taken out of
context. Like that one particular tweet,

81
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:09,350
which is a bad tweet,

82
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,440
was a tweet that was part of a tweet
thread in which has specifically

83
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:15,770
contracting Israel and the Hamas
leadership and saying that the Israeli

84
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:18,380
government likes to build and the
Hamas leadership lid prefer that their

85
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:23,320
citizens live in sewage and bomb things.
But that was a bad tweet obviously. Yeah.

86
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,860
My entire history on on
Muslim relations is one,

87
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,420
like I supported the ability of Ilhan
Omar to wear hijab on the, on the floor.

88
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,250
I opposed. President Trump's
originally proposed Muslim ban, uh,

89
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,490
in the last three weeks I've had on
machine Nawaz I've had on a contact med I

90
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,360
had on yesterday,
a reformed Muslim.

91
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:47,480
Like these are conversations
that have to be had, but to take,

92
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,860
this is one of the things
that bugs me so much. I've,

93
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,810
I've tweeted I think 140,000 times
I've written millions of words.

94
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,070
I'm sure you can find something. I don't
even remember having written it is bad.

95
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,320
I have a running list, by the way.
I tried to be honest about this. I,

96
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:02,750
I'm one of the only people I know who has,
I have a running list it's called.

97
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:04,920
So here's a giant list of all the
dumbest stuff I've ever done. Right?

98
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,250
And I actually go through all this,
like you can look it up.

99
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:08,570
This is not me saying this now.
I mean,

100
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:11,960
you can go and look up all the
things that I think I've done wrong.

101
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,950
And I'll apologize for some,
and I'll say somewhere dom,

102
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,850
and I'll say some I'm fine with,
and you're just taking out of context.

103
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:19,570
But I mean, I hope that's when
honest people tried to do,

104
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,690
but does, this is the problem. You're
not dealing with honest people would,

105
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,440
when people try to categorize
you as outright or they're,

106
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:30,260
they're trying to put you into this
category of Internet goon there, they,

107
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,210
and they did quote tweet.

108
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,240
There's taking some little tiny phrase
that you said seven years ago and trying

109
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:39,860
to say, this is you.
This is, you know, it's,

110
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:42,110
so that's such a disingenuous thing to do.

111
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,540
I hate it. And I hated across
the aisle, by the way, like that.

112
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,890
I was a defender of James Gunn.

113
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:48,470
I thought James Gunn shouldn't have
been fired from guardians of the galaxy.

114
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,240
Yeah. Over the old dumb jokes. Right.
And that's exactly right. Yeah.

115
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,280
And even if somebody tweeted
something bad like 10 years ago,

116
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:59,450
bringing it up now is not an to
actually make the public space better.

117
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,480
And you're not actually offended by that
thing that person tweeted 10 years ago

118
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:05,420
that you didn't notice what it is that
you want to get rid of this person or

119
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:06,254
hurt this person.

120
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,810
So you're going to bring up something
from 10 years ago and then you're going to

121
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:10,370
try and club them into submission with it.

122
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,410
Because if you actually ask
them their opinion about it,

123
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,230
they might have a more nuanced
view on what they said.

124
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:17,300
Maybe they apologize and
they maybe they think,

125
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,510
I don't even remember saying that.
I, I felt the same way by the way.

126
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,300
I try to be consistent. I really
do. About about this stuff.

127
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,880
I said the same thing about,
for example, Ralph Northam,

128
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:30,200
the governor of Virginia who was
excoriated for having this terrible racist

129
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:34,370
photo on his yearbook page back in medical
school in 1987 and people were saying,

130
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:36,320
well, this is evidence he's
racist now. It's like, well no,

131
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,960
that's evidence that he was doing it
racist thing then that's not evidence that

132
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:39,771
he's racist now.

133
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:43,730
You sort of have to look over the broad
course of his career and he ended up

134
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:45,740
doing what everyone now does,

135
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,740
which is you just don't
apologize for anything.

136
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,240
You just try to pass it off as nothing.

137
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,110
The public space is actually getting
worse because let's say that you did

138
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,930
something bad in the past.
There are a few human responses to,

139
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:59,840
I did something I don't like him
past human response number one is,

140
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,020
you know what? I apologize.
That was wrong these days.

141
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:06,410
That gets your face step done, right? You
say, I apologize, I was wrong. It means,

142
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,140
well, why did you do it in the first
place because you're a bad person.

143
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,710
Apologies are not accepted. And then
number two is you braise in it out.

144
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:15,320
You do the Trump. You know, I
never did anything wrong, ever.

145
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,060
I've never perfect right and that,

146
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,270
and then you get your defenders to come
and surround you and then nothing ever

147
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:23,840
gets cleansed or opportunity. Number
three is you do what Barack Obama did,

148
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:27,230
which is you come out preemptively and
you try to remember all the bad stuff you

149
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,560
do and then you confess it in public. So
in dreams from my father, he says, right,

150
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:34,310
well you know when I was back in high
school did a little blow. Everyone's like,

151
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:36,800
oh, okay, so he did cocaine when he was
in high school. That's, that's cool.

152
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:39,680
Whereas if it comes out during the
campaign and he's known, right,

153
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:43,160
then he's got and he's got a real problem.
The problem is that right now,

154
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,280
even if you preemptively come out
and say, I did something wrong. Like,

155
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:46,941
for example,

156
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:51,260
Liam Neeson talking about years ago when
he had a racist thought that he didn't

157
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:52,880
act on when he had a racist thought,

158
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,140
this is now we're going to try and ruin
your career for something that you admit

159
00:07:57,141 --> 00:08:00,890
was bad that you did 30 years ago.
We're going to try and run you over that.

160
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,170
If you apologize for something
that you did 30 years ago,

161
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:04,010
which you would have preferred,

162
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:05,990
just got forgotten because it
was embarrassing and stupid,

163
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,520
then we say you're bad.

164
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,230
And so all you're left with is like the
most shameless people in the world who

165
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:15,920
are in the public space,
right? The incentive structure
is to be deeply shameless,

166
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,000
to just say, yeah, man, I own that.
And it was great when I said it,

167
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,490
or I didn't say it at all. And
you're just, you're just full of it.

168
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,790
I never said that stuff. Oh, who are
you going to believe your eyes were me?

169
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,220
And it makes,
it makes for a really bad politics.

170
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,000
Well, it's just this, uh, the culture of,

171
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:37,001
of going after people for things and
finding any thing to categorize them as

172
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:42,020
someone who's a viable target. And this
is what I've seen. Thrust your way.

173
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,570
It's like there's nothing
wrong with being conservative.

174
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,020
There's something wrong with
wanting everyone to think
the way you think though.

175
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,400
This is the difference.

176
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:52,820
Like you w w what I liked that
you do is you debate your points,

177
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:55,070
you state your positions,
you have a philosophy.

178
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,670
And what I don't like is when people try
to pretend that that philosophy is some

179
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,610
somewhat somehow hateful or somehow
regressive or some like your,

180
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,060
that you condemn people for their
thoughts. You, you just, you don't,

181
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,680
this is what I,
not what I see with you.

182
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,840
I appreciate that and I appreciate the
accuracy because I think that's true.

183
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:16,810
I mean, I've come out against
virtually every Twitter band,

184
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,420
including people who have
personally targeted me.

185
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,300
I've come out against that have
come out against virtually every,

186
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,030
what would they talk about that?
Because what are you,

187
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:27,290
what are your thoughts about this
idea of d platforming and you know,

188
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,800
this is something that we were just
discussing before the podcast, um,

189
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:35,240
where the CEO of Youtube and
it's Kara Swisher's from code,

190
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,470
I think Kara Swisher.

191
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:40,100
They were talking about removing you
from Youtube and I thought it was the CEO

192
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:42,790
of Youtube. It was actually Kara
who said I would, if I could.

193
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,520
Yeah, she was pissed because
her son apparently listens
to, that's kind of funny.

194
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:46,770
Yeah.

195
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,980
If she's being funny saying, but it was,
I thought it was the CEO of [inaudible].

196
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,630
She was trying to much more disturbed.

197
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,650
She was trying to do the same thing that
they do with you or with Dave Rubin or

198
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:56,371
Jordan Peterson,

199
00:09:56,371 --> 00:10:00,780
which is that anybody who
is sort of heterodox because
in that group I think I'm

200
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:01,860
the only registered Republican.

201
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,880
Every anybody who's Heterodox
is now being mixed portrayed.

202
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:09,570
Is it docs meaning just thinks
differently from kind of the down the line

203
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,190
Democratic Party platform.

204
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,970
You're not like down the line with
Hillary like Sam Harris who's a democrat.

205
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,080
Sam Harris's Heterodox because he
disagrees that Islam is by necessity a

206
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:22,140
religion of peace, for example.
Right? Or he thinks that we have to

207
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:27,141
look@actualstatisticsinordertomakeevidentiarybasepointsaboutdiscriminationanddisparityandthismakeshimanenemyofpeoplelikeezrakleinatvox.com

208
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,240
right.
Th th this sort of stuff,

209
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,140
they then say that you are a feed or
for white supremacy, right? They, they,

210
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,650
they can't actually get you
on what you say. Yeah. So it
turns into, well, you know,

211
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:44,760
some members of your audience do things
that, that are really bad. It's like,

212
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:48,150
well dude, I have like millions of
people who are members of my audience.

213
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:49,770
I have 5 million Facebook followers.

214
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:51,900
I have 2 million on Twitter and
you're way bigger than I am.

215
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,780
I assume that some of those
people are going to be crazy.

216
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,960
I mean, yeah, I would assume.
Yeah. The idea that your respect,

217
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,320
well this is what youtube tried to do.

218
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:02,380
You know about the comment thing where
the youtube was going to try to make

219
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:05,080
people responsible for the
comments and their videos, which,

220
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,250
what does a normal Jamie,
like a normal video that we get,

221
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,360
how many comments does it get?

222
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,600
I don't know,
like 10,000.

223
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,020
It's like an average one.
How the fuck

224
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,720
am I supposed to have some dude with
his itchy trigger fingers standing by in

225
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,600
front of a keyboard just waiting
for something offensive to pop up.

226
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,900
And this was in response to something
that happened with them where there was

227
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:30,980
pedophiles who were watching videos
of children doing things and they were

228
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,610
commenting stuff in the children's
gymnastics and stuff like that.

229
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,180
They're commenting and like communicating
with each other through the comments.

230
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:41,810
And it was sort of, um,
discovered that there was this,

231
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,450
this connection that they
were doing this in many,

232
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:48,020
many videos and youtube rightly
panicked and like, Holy Shit,

233
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:48,860
we have to stop this.

234
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,060
So the response I guess was we just have
to make people responsible for their,

235
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,070
someone said,

236
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,903
oh yeah,
good idea.

237
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,450
But you didn't think through it all right
that certain people that can't do that,

238
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,690
it's totally insane and it's insane. And
in virtually every respect. And it's,

239
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,170
it's funny how it's only applied kind of
by the media on one side of the aisle.

240
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:06,390
So to take an example,

241
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,440
the congressional baseball shooting
happens a couple of years ago.

242
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:11,770
Guy Happens to be a Bernie Fan, is
that Bernie Sanders is fault. No,

243
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:14,080
that is not Bernie Sanders
as well, in a way. Right?

244
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,040
Literally people stop talking about it.
And, and that was shooting of legislators,

245
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,160
like elected people. One nearly
died and that kind of went away.

246
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,530
We didn't talk about, you
know, Bernie's responsibility,

247
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,560
but there's a shooting in Christchurch
and it's Jordan Peterson's fall and

248
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:29,800
Jordan Peterson has no relationship with
the shooter whatsoever. It's my fault.

249
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:33,190
I have no relationship with the shooter
and denounce everything that that piece

250
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:36,420
of crap stands for. And
suddenly it's, it, it's,

251
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,000
it's really ugly and it's going to,
it, it will come home to roost. I mean,

252
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,060
here's what's going to happen is Facebook
and youtube are going to fall prey to

253
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:46,750
their own standards because if their
standard is that you're responsible for

254
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:50,620
your followers or I'm responsible for
my followers or Jordan or anybody else's

255
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:53,590
responsible for all the people
who view their stuff, okay,

256
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:56,410
then why isn't Facebook responsible for
all the people posting on its platform?

257
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:57,970
If they are right,

258
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:00,640
if Facebook becomes responsible for
all the people posting on his platform,

259
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,250
they'll be bankrupt and a
week they've got a problem.

260
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,220
They really do because they have to
decide whether they are our platform or

261
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:09,690
whether they are a do gooder publication.
I run A,

262
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,340
I run a a publication daily wire.
It's openly conservative.

263
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:16,300
We make no bones about that and we are
responsible for the content that appears

264
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,350
on our platform and if we say
something defamatory, we will be sued.

265
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,140
If we say something that is false,
then we will be sued.

266
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:27,550
Presumably if you post something false
on Facebook, Facebook doesn't get sued,

267
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,280
but now Facebook has deemed
itself the morality police,

268
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:33,400
no band people they don't like and they'll
decide what editorially ought to be

269
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:34,960
elevated and what ought
not to be elevated.

270
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,960
Does that sound more like
the phone company to you or
does that sound more like

271
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:41,290
my website where I decide what gets
published and what doesn't? Right.

272
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,440
Because Facebook's case for
exemption from these laws is,

273
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,930
well we're like the phone company, right
when you're on the phone with somebody,

274
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,500
if that person says something criminal
t and t isn't responsible for the person

275
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:53,320
saying something criminal or terrible,
it's just the phone company.

276
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,940
But Facebook isn't doing that.

277
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:59,650
Facebook has is jumping into the middle
of conversations and then saying,

278
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,580
well we don't really like
this conversation so we're
just going to kind of shut

279
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:07,690
it down. Not because of legal threat,
but because we just don't like it.

280
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,830
So are they actually doing that?

281
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,850
I'll say if you put a post up on Facebook
and they don't like the way you word

282
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,410
things or describe things with,
they actually shut down your post.

283
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:19,480
Where what will they do so
they've done it in the past.

284
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:21,760
To some conservative public is pretty
controversial because they're not

285
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:22,810
transparent at all.

286
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:27,730
I can tell you that the beginning of
2018 we lost about 35% of our traffic

287
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:31,780
because Facebook started cracking
down on mostly conservative sites.

288
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,490
They said that it was kind
of new sites generally,

289
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,710
but that's not what the statistics showed.

290
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,850
They're doing it more often with things
that we all sort of agree are bad, right?

291
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:42,550
We all agree white supremacy is bad.
White nationalism is bad.

292
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:43,780
Now they say they're going
to censor that stuff,

293
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:44,770
but here's where I'm uncomfortable.

294
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,790
I think that that stuff is awful and evil
and those people are, the ones are the,

295
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,830
they're the reason I
have personal security,

296
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,310
but once you get into the business of
Facebook gets to decide which speech is

297
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,520
good and which speeches bad.
They're an editor there, an editor.

298
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:01,940
Even if I agree with their assessment
of what stuff is good and what is bad,

299
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,640
I am not comfortable with them
in the driver's seat there.

300
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,200
And if they are going to
be in the driver's seat,

301
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,540
then they should be held liable for
all the stuff that's on their platform.

302
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,970
I mean, why isn't the Twitter,
Twitter, same thing, right?

303
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:14,900
Why is it that Louis Farrakhan is still
on that platform but Alex Jones is not

304
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,860
like, I don't like Alex Jones
is material or I've been very,

305
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:20,270
very critical of Alex Jones.

306
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,780
I didn't think you should get banned
from Twitter unless he actually violated

307
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:26,060
the law in, unless he was
responsible for a violent threat,

308
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:27,560
unless he was defamatory or something.

309
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:33,170
They're definitely going down this
road of being the moral arbitrators.

310
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:33,991
They're,

311
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:38,400
they're the ones who get to decide what
the conversations are and h and that's

312
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:39,930
an insane responsibility.

313
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,560
The responsibility of getting to dictate
what should and should not be discussed

314
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,920
and to have it to be a handful of people
and have these people almost almost

315
00:15:49,471 --> 00:15:54,471
exclusively live in the Pacific and you
know in north of San Francisco that that

316
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:58,650
whole tech community,
I mean it's all tech liberals who really,

317
00:15:58,651 --> 00:16:00,180
if you're around those people,

318
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,360
they live in this really strange Uber
wealthy bubble of super genius spectrum

319
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:13,791
people who are coders and
super capitalists and people
that are raising money

320
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:19,050
all over the place and
designing technology and they
have an ideology and it's

321
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,550
not necessarily a bad one just just being
honest and upfront about what it is.

322
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,780
It's incredibly progressive, which is
very unusual for big business, right?

323
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:30,780
For big business to be just openly,

324
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:35,400
transparently progressive and pushing
social justice. It's very unusual.

325
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,170
Well I think that there is a sort of
misunderstanding of when we say what big

326
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:40,910
business is,
what big businesses.

327
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:44,000
So I think that there's a wide variety
of owners of businesses and how they

328
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:46,580
think about politics obviously. Yeah.
Bill Gates is a Progressive Guy,

329
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:47,690
Warren Buffet's progressive guy.

330
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,510
They are now
his whole life.

331
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,850
And he's ruthless with Microsoft.

332
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,990
Well, so I think that there
are a lot of people, listen,

333
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,430
I think that that the vast majority,

334
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:00,980
I think mark Zuckerberg is ruthless
with Facebook and used progressive.

335
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:04,400
I think Jack Dorsey is as ruthless as
the next guy when it comes to profit.

336
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,070
I mean, he's still got to be answerable
to the shareholders. So I think,

337
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,520
I think a lot of the
progressivism is sort of a,

338
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:14,360
a way to excuse your own in your own
involvement in the capitalist market.

339
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,420
Facebook took off. Don't be evil.
That was their thing. Don't be evil.

340
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:23,640
They decided to remove that. Let's
Google, right? I'm sorry Google. Yeah,

341
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,160
when Google did that, I met Google. But
just funny when you think something,

342
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:31,390
but you're saying, um, when they did that,
it's like, why would you ever take off?

343
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,500
Don't be evil like cheap that,
but here's the thing.

344
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,230
Here's my thing. I think that if
our tech companies were honest,

345
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,750
they should take that stuff off.
Like stop pretending you're do Gooding.

346
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,660
You're not do good and you're providing
a platform and maybe the platform is the

347
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:47,830
good, right? In a capitalist economy,
the product that you provide is the good,

348
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:50,610
I don't need additional good to
come from your product, right?

349
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,000
If you want to provide me a
solid morning drink, right?

350
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,900
I don't need your politics. Along with
that, I just need the drink. Okay,

351
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,470
well if I want a social media company,

352
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,860
I don't give two craps about what
Mark Zuckerberg thinks about politics.

353
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:05,100
Dude hasn't studied it. I don't
care at all. What Jack Dorsey,

354
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,030
who vacations in Malaysia and gets
bitten by a million mosquitoes while

355
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:11,610
meditating. [inaudible] has to say
about the nature of life. Like what?

356
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:15,030
Why do I care about Jack Dorsey's
political view? He has provided me a good,

357
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:18,660
the good is this basic chat
room where I'm consuming news.

358
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,160
How about that would just be enough,

359
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:22,890
but it's not enough for a lot
of these folks. It's, it's the,

360
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,770
the kind of Hooli from Silicon Valley.

361
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,830
We're going to pretend that we're here
to do good and it's not enough just to

362
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:31,920
acknowledge that maybe the thing
that you provided is the good,

363
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,330
like Bill Gates has done more good with
Microsoft and then he has done with any

364
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:38,430
of his charities.
He's even a lot of money to charity,

365
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,880
but Microsoft has provided legitimately
hundreds of thousands of jobs and

366
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:46,740
created enormously productive lines of
business and made enormous profit for a

367
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:50,430
lot of people. A lot of people have
stock in Microsoft as a general,

368
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,940
as a basic factual thing.
He has done more good doing that.

369
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:57,660
Then giving tens of millions of
dollars to, to various outside causes.

370
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:02,640
So it feels like a lot of
the progressivism in in
corporate halls and in Silicon

371
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,540
Valley is bifurcated mentally. It's like
people have it, they're like dolphins,

372
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,340
just one side of the brain on at a time.
Here's my,

373
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,070
here's my capitalist side where
I got and make money and profit.

374
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,940
And then here's my other side where I
show people what a great person I am by

375
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:18,540
proclaiming that I'm for Bernie Sanders
while parking my money off shore to make

376
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,820
sure that they're, it's shielded
from that, from the tax man.

377
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,730
Yeah. Well that's a good assessment. Um,

378
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,190
what I'm saying is that
the don't be evil thing.

379
00:19:28,191 --> 00:19:32,510
Like one of the things that I thought was
what if that was like a legal decision

380
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,530
was me being cynical, that
they were pulled into some
sort of an office and said,

381
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,040
um,

382
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,750
if we say don't be evil and you
take someone off the platform,

383
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:43,340
you're accusing them of evil.

384
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,960
That's it. I mean, then we
should slow that down. Maybe,
I mean, again, this, this,

385
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,600
this self assessment of you are the
moral police I find really troubling it.

386
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:54,320
It's so funny. I'm the, I'm the suppose
in more or less, right? Right. I'm,

387
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,770
I'm the religious guy. I'm
in the Orthodox Jew, right?

388
00:19:56,771 --> 00:20:00,430
I talk about social standards and how
people should behave in their personal

389
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:00,780
life.

390
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,210
But when it comes to government and when
it comes to me imposing my views on you,

391
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,600
I am way less of a top down higher rent
than any of the people in Silicon Valley.

392
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,560
I am not here to tell you that you are
not allowed to be on a platform because

393
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:13,540
we disagree. It's one thing if
you're threatening violence,

394
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,040
which is an actual violation of law,

395
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:19,870
but this crap where people like me because
I believe in a social fabric built,

396
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:22,780
uncertain, Judeo Christian values. But
I'm not forcing you to be part of that.

397
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,690
And I'm not. I don't think the government
should compel you to be a part of that,

398
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,770
or I'm the tyrant.

399
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,550
But the person who sits at the top of
Twitter or Facebook who is saying that

400
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:34,030
they get to police what you see and
they're going to nudge you in the right

401
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:37,000
direction, nudge you in the right
direction without your consent,

402
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,700
without them even telling them what
you're doing right. They, they're just,

403
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,670
they're gonna push you a little bit
because they know better than you and they

404
00:20:42,671 --> 00:20:46,000
can sort of massage you in a better
views if we control your channels of

405
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:48,970
information. This is the Obama
administration was very fond of,

406
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:52,570
there's a scholar in cass Sunstein as a
legal scholar and he wrote a book called

407
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:53,830
nudge. He was very famous. It was,

408
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,330
it was used to sort of a handbook during
the Obama administration and the idea

409
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,880
as well,

410
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,410
if we can just use a non forcible means
to sort of nudge people in a particular

411
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:04,840
direction without them even
knowing they're being nudged,

412
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,770
then shouldn't we do that? And I think,
no, you shouldn't. You shouldn't.

413
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,250
Because transparency is the only way I
can tell what kind of bullshit you're

414
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:13,084
trying to sell me.

415
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:18,260
Well, not just dot. Like you, you're,
you're closing down even conversation.

416
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,830
If soon as you trying to silence
this other voice, if you,

417
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,580
if you believe one thing
and another person belief at
different thing you should

418
00:21:25,581 --> 00:21:28,370
probably talk about and the way,

419
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,140
the way that I know for sure there's
something wrong with your argument is if

420
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,890
what you're trying to do is you're
sneakily trying to silence these voices.

421
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:37,580
And again,

422
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,550
as long as we're not talking about threats
of violence and as long as we're not

423
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:43,760
talking about harassment or doxing, right,
we're just talking about conversation.

424
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,130
You're just talking about people
with differing points of view.

425
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,290
If you want to silence
differing points of view,

426
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,000
I have to wonder about your intent.

427
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,640
I have to wonder about whether you're
going into this conversation with good

428
00:21:52,641 --> 00:21:53,180
faith.

429
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,200
I have to wonder whether you've really
objectively assessed whether or not you,

430
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,190
your argument does hold up against
scrutiny because this is also part of the

431
00:22:01,191 --> 00:22:04,550
problem and when you're in an echo
chamber you often don't formulate these

432
00:22:04,551 --> 00:22:05,540
arguments very well.

433
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:09,610
Like when you confront people
about certain bias beliefs
that they have and you,

434
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,650
you have a an opposing belief.
If they're part of a bubble,

435
00:22:12,651 --> 00:22:15,800
like sometimes they might not have even
ever considered some of the things you

436
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,720
have to say. And I've seen
that with some of your videos.

437
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,041
Yeah,

438
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:21,490
I mean it does happen all the time and
with sophisticated people where I'd spent

439
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:22,324
my entire life,

440
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,470
literally my entire life in areas
where everyone disagrees with me. Yeah.

441
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,690
I grew up in La. I went to Harvard
law school for three years.

442
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:30,970
I was in Cambridge where
everyone disagreed with me
and then I came back to la.

443
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:34,900
So I have never spent more than
a week at a time in a red state.

444
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,281
Right.

445
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:40,281
Whoever is you have your conservative
values moved in one way or another of the,

446
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,710
I mean,
I should say that at all.

447
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,690
My personal valley's probably
haven't shifted very much,

448
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,720
but my political values have
shifted. Libertarian. Mm. I mean,

449
00:22:47,721 --> 00:22:51,290
so I used to be a proponent
of criminalization of
marijuana. I'm no longer,

450
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:54,380
I've been in favorites for you.
A couple of things.

451
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,940
One was just a general sense
of the government sucks
at everything and the more

452
00:22:58,941 --> 00:23:00,620
I see the government tried
to crack down on things,

453
00:23:00,621 --> 00:23:01,820
the more prevalent it becomes.
I mean,

454
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:04,190
people were dealing pot
now on my sixth grade,

455
00:23:04,191 --> 00:23:08,960
seventh grade playground in public school.
So obviously like mellow. Yeah, exactly.

456
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,700
And then it's terrible. Just a
general, a general perception.

457
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:15,530
Not only the government
sucks at everything,

458
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,640
but that you got to own your own actions
and also examining more of the evidence

459
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:24,350
about the impact of, of pot on
people's lives. And, and you know,

460
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:24,880
again,

461
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,370
there's you ruining your own life through
use of drugs and there's drugs that

462
00:23:28,371 --> 00:23:30,130
legitimately ruined other
people's lives right there.

463
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:34,050
There are drugs that remove your
ability to even reason or thing.

464
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,620
I think there are only two reasons
to criminalize drugs in any fashion.

465
00:23:36,621 --> 00:23:38,870
One is if there are
drugs like for example,

466
00:23:38,871 --> 00:23:41,060
PCP that legitimately make you violent,
uh,

467
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:43,580
and then you are going out and committing
acts of violence against people,

468
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,470
then there's the case.
Uh,

469
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:50,360
or if you're talking about a drug
where it legitimately robs you of your

470
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,820
capacity to reason.
If it were a heroin,

471
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,940
if you were able to actually crack down
on it successfully. But even there,

472
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:59,840
I'm not sure that the proper government
solution is criminalization because

473
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:02,570
we've criminalized it and it's
still incredibly prevalent.

474
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:05,040
So it's agree with you.
I agree with her on that.

475
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,280
And I agree with you in terms of
drugs being extremely detrimental.

476
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:14,070
And the other part is that there's
comparable drugs that are illegal and

477
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,050
comparable drugs,

478
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,220
meaning not even really comparable
drugs that are far more devastating like

479
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:20,860
alcohol.
Like you,

480
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:25,861
you could just go to any grocery store
and buy a jug of whisky and kill yourself

481
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:27,620
with it.
It's not difficult.

482
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,700
And just drink the books already that
prevent externalities. If you drive high,

483
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:32,690
it's the same as driving drunk.

484
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:36,530
So I'm not sure that you need additional
laws to do that. And also, you know,

485
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:37,910
I'm not opposed to zoning laws.

486
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:40,340
Like I don't think a pot shop should open
up right next to my house right there.

487
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,120
Residential Zoning. That's fine. Sand
with liquor stores though, right?

488
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,790
I don't want to liquor store right next
to my house. This is correct. Right.

489
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,180
So the, so I become a libertarian
in some ways on that sort of stuff.

490
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:51,170
At the same thing is true by the way,

491
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:55,040
when it comes to the issue of same sex
marriage. So on a personal moral level,

492
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,360
I'm opposed to same sex marriage.

493
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,350
I'm an Orthodox Jew and I believe that
a man and a woman were made for each

494
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:02,300
other when it comes to
government involvement.

495
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,550
I don't think that's anybody's business.
I think a lot of things,

496
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:05,720
I think adults raise bad too.

497
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,960
I don't think the government ought
to be involved in adultery. I, I'm,

498
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,340
I'm so strict. I don't think premarital
sex is a good thing, right. I,

499
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,700
I've been very vocal about this.
I was a virgin until I was married.

500
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:15,860
My wife was a virgin until she was
married. I think that's a good thing.

501
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,760
So I think the government has anything
to do with any of those things. No,

502
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:21,410
I don't. I don't think it's any
of the government's business.

503
00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:23,810
It's consensual activity.
There are no externalities.

504
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,020
So what exactly is the
government getting involved in?

505
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,470
And when the government gets involved
in stuff, then there are externalities.

506
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,040
Right? Once the government starts
to cram down its vision on people,

507
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,720
then you start to get unintended
externality. So for example, with the law,

508
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,750
with the legalization,

509
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,680
my view on marriage is that the government
should get completely out of the

510
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:45,020
business. I don't think the government
should be involved in straight marriage.

511
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:46,280
I don't think it should be
involved in gay marriage.

512
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:47,390
I think the government should be out.

513
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,710
I agree 100% and the reason that I say
that is because as a religious person,

514
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,410
right? Who believes in
traditional marriage, I have two,

515
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,240
I have to marriage certificates,

516
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:58,490
I have the one from the state
that I don't give two craps about.

517
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:00,610
It's buried somewhere in my garage.
And then I have my religion,

518
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,940
my religious marriage certificate,

519
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,040
which meant among other things that
I got to shut up my wife, right?

520
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,870
I mean like this was the
one that mattered to me.

521
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,600
And I think that's true
for most religious people.

522
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:11,870
The religious ceremony matters a lot
more than the state saying a thing.

523
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,550
And the state isn't incentivizing.

524
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:15,050
There's people aren't getting
married because they're like, yeah,

525
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:17,180
I need the tax break.
So that's a bunch of nonsense.

526
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,030
And once the government decides what
version of marriage and wants to push,

527
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,240
that then comes into conflict
with other values. So for example,

528
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,110
once the state of California decides that
same sex marriage is on legal par with

529
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:27,944
heterosexual marriage,

530
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,090
now I'm worried about the externality of
I have a religious day school or I have

531
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,660
a, my, my synagogue, my synagogue
is a religious institution.

532
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:36,950
It doesn't approve of same sex marriage.

533
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,400
Now is the government going to come in
and tell my synagogue how it ought to act

534
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,010
with regard to same sex marriage?
I don't think that's the government's.

535
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,100
So how about

536
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,221
this?

537
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:46,800
How about everybody gets to do basically
what they want associate with whom they

538
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:49,170
want and it's none of the government's
business. This seems like a pretty good,

539
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:50,410
happy medium.
I,

540
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,850
I'm so glad you talked about the two
things that I want to talk to you about

541
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:55,040
that I'm sure we disagree.

542
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,100
One of them be in marijuana and the
other one being gay people marrying each

543
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:02,310
other. Um, so let's start
with the marijuana one.

544
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,000
Do you think marijuana ruins
people's lives? Is it's,

545
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,380
is that one of your contentions?
Um,

546
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,850
I think that it can and I think in the
same way I ever had any experience with

547
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:13,470
marijuana, no, I'm just talking about the,

548
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:17,490
I'm just talking about the statistical
over use of marijuana among teenagers

549
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:20,910
does have detrimental brain effects
that have some long term after effects.

550
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,010
It's pretty proven and that's
one of the things that I really,

551
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:25,350
I'm glad you said that because I wanted
to cover that when you were in the

552
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:26,041
middle of a rant,

553
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:29,550
what we were joking around about
sixth and seventh graders selling pot.

554
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,310
Don't smoke pot when you're young.
You really should,

555
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,730
it's not good for the development of
your brain. Same thing with drinking.

556
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,250
You know, I didn't smoke a
lot of pot when I was a kid.

557
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,710
I did it a handful of times
until I was 30 years old.

558
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,890
But I did drink a bunch of times when
I was young and in high school and it's

559
00:27:43,891 --> 00:27:47,820
terrible for brain development, especially
before you're 25 and your, your,

560
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:52,590
your funnel cortex hasn't even
fully formed. Your frontal
lobe is like this. It's,

561
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:54,460
it's,
it's a developing thing there.

562
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,730
There was an article recently
that I posted from BBC.

563
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:59,250
There were saying that you should
probably shouldn't be considered an adult

564
00:27:59,251 --> 00:28:00,270
until you're 30.
Right?

565
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:03,150
They're saying brain development
doesn't even stop until you're 26 or 20.

566
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,580
This is why when, when people are saying,
let's, let's lower the voting age 16.

567
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:10,560
I'm like, what the, what the fuck
are you talking about? When I was 16,

568
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:15,270
I wish I champ. You know, I mean,
it was a champion of high school.

569
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,420
Now when the problem that I have with
many people's perceptions on marijuana is

570
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:26,520
that it's based on ignorance, meaning not
no personal experience with, you know,

571
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:30,450
and listen, I'll admit I have no
personal. I know. I know. You don't.

572
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:32,530
I'm not speaking. Probably we should get
high. That's what I'm trying to tell you,

573
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,180
man. I seen the effects on stock prices.
When people get hired in the city,

574
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,270
they jump up, man. He jumped
down for a little one,

575
00:28:40,271 --> 00:28:44,910
a bunch of chickens jump off the boat,
then they come right back up. Um,

576
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,630
the marijuana thing is in my opinion,
uh,

577
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,790
it's another one of those
things where people have this,

578
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,170
this categorized box that they
like to put marijuana users in.

579
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,700
Like this is the category. Lazy
Stoner, stupid, delusional.

580
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,080
It's too widespread for that.
I mean there,

581
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:04,380
there are people I know who
are doctors who, yes, so,

582
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,710
well there's the Jiu Jitsu
community is a big one.

583
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:12,240
There's a giant percentage of the Jiu
Jitsu community that does Jujitsu high.

584
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:16,500
They have competition. It's
more a party. It's not man,

585
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:19,050
I'm telling you that because
it's not what people think it is.

586
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,820
If you've never smoked marijuana,

587
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:23,340
this is going to be a very
difficult thing to grasp.

588
00:29:23,341 --> 00:29:27,240
But marijuana enhances Jujitsu because
it eliminates the rest of the world.

589
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,190
When you're rolling, which
rolling is like, say if, uh,

590
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,110
you and Jamie were going to have a
sparring match that would be rolling.

591
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:37,440
Like you'd slap hands and then you'd go
and you try to choke him and he's trying

592
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:39,240
to get you in an arm bar
and you're going after it.

593
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,130
When you do that on marijuana,
it's like you don't

594
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,540
think of anything else other than those
movements and it becomes like this very

595
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:49,240
intense meditation and violence.

596
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:53,410
Like it's not violent in terms of most
of the time you don't really even get

597
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:55,360
hurt.
He like you get to the point,

598
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,140
one of the beautiful things about Jujitsu
is you can grab a hold of someone and

599
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:02,110
choked him to the point where they're
going to go to sleep and you would kill

600
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:05,530
them if you kept going and they tap
around your friends again and everybody's

601
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:09,160
cool and you try to do it to me and I
tried to do it to you and you really can

602
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:12,910
do it reasonably hard
without people getting hurt.

603
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,490
And it happens every day,
all throughout the world.

604
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,390
A lot of these people are high and they're
doing this Jujitsu practice in this

605
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:24,160
all almost like a trends.
It's like it's ascension state.

606
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,850
If you can function when you're using
marijuana, I don't care, but you can.

607
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:31,720
This is what I'm saying.
Perceptions are off. I mean,

608
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,380
I would assume there's a small subset of
the population for whom that's not true.

609
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:39,280
Right, who are over using marijuana. Yes,
and that's probably the majority in fact.

610
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:44,270
Okay, so, so then you know, but it's
exactly the same way with food. I agree.

611
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,050
So I don't think there's
anything we disagree about
here because I'm not talking

612
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:49,300
about criminalizing marijuana use.

613
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:53,830
I think that we should honestly discuss
the evidence that for a subset of the

614
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:57,550
population, there is some evidence that
marijuana is addicting, but it's a subset.

615
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,170
It's not everybody who's on marijuana,

616
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:02,110
the vast majority of people on
marijuana or not addicted to marijuana.

617
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,200
I think in the same way the alcoholic,
that Minster of alcohol as well it is,

618
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:07,810
there's people that are going to
be addicted to almost anything.

619
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,740
And I think there's, there's absolutely
people that are addicted to sugar.

620
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:12,820
This for sure,

621
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:15,790
people that are addicted to nicotine and
alcohol and all of these things that we

622
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,840
let people have.

623
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,950
The material addictiveness of marijuana
is not comparable to opioids though for

624
00:31:19,951 --> 00:31:22,720
it. It's not even comparable
to alcohol or nicotine.

625
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,590
It's seems to be very rare when people
become physically addicted to it.

626
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:28,330
Extremely rare.
And what's,

627
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:33,390
what's common though is abuse and it's
common in everything that human beings

628
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,570
consume. It's a fused as
common as we said with food,

629
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,420
certainly common with alcohol.
It's certainly common with pills.

630
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:44,710
And this is why I really believe that the
way to solve some of these problems is,

631
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:47,020
is a social fabric problem.
Like it's a parenting problem.

632
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:49,660
It's a social fabric problem.
It's a personal choice problem.

633
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,620
That's why virtually every solution I
suggested so funny and I'm constantly

634
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:56,590
conservatives like me who are libertarian
leaning or constantly accused of being

635
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:58,030
non-compassionate.
No,

636
00:31:58,031 --> 00:32:00,760
it's just our compassionate solutions
don't involve the use of government.

637
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,790
It's like we're going to encourage people
to make better decisions with their

638
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:07,240
lives. And if you choose not to do that,
it's a free country. Well, you know,

639
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:08,920
coming from religious background,

640
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:12,460
you have this community that reinforces
this kind of behavior in thought.

641
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,530
And I think that's one of the major,

642
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:19,090
really one of the best benefits of
religion is that moral fabric and that

643
00:32:19,091 --> 00:32:23,210
community, the sense of community. Even
silly ones like Mormons, you know they're,

644
00:32:23,211 --> 00:32:24,630
they're the nicest folks,
right?

645
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,610
They believe something that
is fucking patently insane.

646
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:32,470
If you go and read the Joseph Smith
texts from 1820 when he was 14 years old,

647
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:35,640
the shit that he wrote, let me try
not to get into doctrinal insanity.

648
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,600
I wear a funny hat all day Syria.
Just kind of get to that.

649
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,580
But you know, with that said, I mean
Alexis de Tocqueville talks about this,

650
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,290
you know,
early on in the American republic,

651
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:47,960
the idea is that what makes
America very different is the idea.

652
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:50,870
You don't need a big government when
you do have a supportive social fabric

653
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:53,780
where people feel like they're at
least oriented toward a common goal.

654
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,150
It's one of the problems that I think
we have in the country right now.

655
00:32:56,151 --> 00:33:01,100
I'm not sure people are oriented toward
even a common sense of, of conversation.

656
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,340
You don't have to agree on,

657
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:07,940
on everything in order to have a common
sense of the important values that that

658
00:33:07,941 --> 00:33:09,600
unified the country are
showing. Yes. Right.

659
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,420
And I always use Sam
Harris is sorta my bet. No,

660
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:13,580
are here because he's obviously
a militant atheist. I'm,

661
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,640
I'm in equally and equally strong believer
and yet when it comes to the things

662
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:22,670
that we would like to see happen in the
country, not on government policy level,

663
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:25,910
but on a, let's have a conversation
level and discuss on evidence level,

664
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,140
we're on the same page.

665
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:30,170
There's certain core assumptions you
have to make in order for that to happen.

666
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,910
In my argument about America and the
West is that those core assumptions are

667
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:36,530
built on Judeo Christian foundations.

668
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,010
Sam's core argument seems to be that
they're built on evolutionary biology.

669
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,330
We differ a little bit there.

670
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,960
Mm. Um, well, I don't want to
let this marijuana thing go to.

671
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:50,070
One of the things that I wanted to bring
up too was this idea that if you're

672
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,010
religious person,

673
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:56,790
don't you think that there's certain
things that maybe God put here for us to

674
00:33:57,221 --> 00:34:00,490
consume,
to change your perspective?

675
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,280
To allow you to reach new
levels of consciousness.

676
00:34:03,281 --> 00:34:06,460
Don't you think it's entirely possible
that some of these things that are here,

677
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,900
and I know you haven't experienced,

678
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:12,580
but they might literally have been put
there by God and there's some evidence to

679
00:34:12,581 --> 00:34:17,380
say that a lot of the texts from
the Bible, that in particular,

680
00:34:17,381 --> 00:34:18,400
there was a,

681
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:23,910
I think it was a university of Tel
Aviv somewhere in in Jerusalem,

682
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:25,960
or these scholars were,

683
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:31,030
they were trying to decipher what it
meant when Moses encountered the burning

684
00:34:31,031 --> 00:34:34,240
Bush. Right, and they believe that
it may have been the Acacia tree,

685
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:36,420
which is very rich and dimethyltryptamine,

686
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:39,730
which is a psychedelic substance that
actually that the brain produces.

687
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,960
It's very common in plants and they think
that this might have been when he met

688
00:34:43,961 --> 00:34:46,330
God and the God was a burning Bush,

689
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:51,570
that this might have been some crew
translation of them being involved in some

690
00:34:52,451 --> 00:34:53,920
sort of a psychedelic experience.

691
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,030
Now it sounds outlandish unless you've
had that psychedelic experience and when

692
00:34:58,031 --> 00:35:02,440
you have, you very well could think that
you were in a conversation with God.

693
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:08,070
This is on earth and this is something
that may very well have been lost

694
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:13,510
information or this may very well have
been rituals that people participated in

695
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,630
to bring them closer together and to
reinforce that sense of community that you

696
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:20,440
do get from a church and you do get
from a group of people that share more

697
00:35:20,441 --> 00:35:22,090
beliefs and values and there's,

698
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:27,070
there's real good discussion that a lot
of these experiences that became these

699
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:30,460
religious doctrines came from
psychedelic experiences. Now,

700
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,410
as someone who's never
experienced that before,

701
00:35:32,411 --> 00:35:36,070
I know this is probably a very strange
thing to try to even wrap your head

702
00:35:36,071 --> 00:35:40,500
around. It's, it is entirely
alien until you experience it,

703
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,750
but it might very well be religious.

704
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,830
I mean I've, I've heard that
from other people who've been,

705
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,230
who've used those kinds of drag me.
See,

706
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:51,770
I'm actually made this argument to me
too about the use of psychedelics and any

707
00:35:51,771 --> 00:35:55,620
maybe mean. Dot. Again, I apples.
Well. Okay, so then this argument,

708
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,030
I will say I'm not super fond of the
argument that God made something and

709
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:03,980
therefor it's ours to use or be.
I mean like I keep kosher, right?

710
00:36:03,981 --> 00:36:05,790
Like God made pigs, I
don't need him. Right?

711
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:11,140
So I am not a huge fan of the argument
that because something is here or because

712
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:12,830
in urges natural,

713
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,340
therefore we ought to imbibe or
therefore we ought to participate in a

714
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:20,280
particular activity. You know, one of the
things that I, that I'm very big on, I'm,

715
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:23,660
I'm a, I'm a rationalist
when it comes to religion,

716
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,820
as much as you can be a rationalist
with regard to religion,

717
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,080
to the extent that I think that it's up
to us to use our reasonable faculties to

718
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:34,160
determine the proper use of things. So,
which is why you shouldn't overuse drugs.

719
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:35,180
Even if you're going to use drugs,

720
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,750
this is prior to the problem making
things illegal. You make things illegal,

721
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:43,751
then you really don't know what it is
or how it affects the body or what's the

722
00:36:44,061 --> 00:36:45,770
right dose or the wrong dose.

723
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,310
And then people get involved in these
terrible situations where they're taking

724
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:50,190
things.
They're just guessing.

725
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,800
I mean there's truth to that,
but it's also true that on a social level,

726
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:55,080
I'm not talking about legal cause
we totally agree on the legal level,

727
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:59,430
on the social level, there's a couple
of things that are true of, for example,

728
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:00,570
the Orthodox Jewish community,

729
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,320
low rates of addiction because
people have that social fabric.

730
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:07,680
They don't feel the necessity.
Also, you know, as you say,

731
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:10,590
substance use in moderation can
actually be quite a good thing.

732
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:12,540
So low rates of alcoholism
in the Jewish community.

733
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:15,120
And part of that is the fact that you
are getting kiddish wine from the time

734
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:18,030
you're a kid. Right? I mean you
actually are our de-stigmatize. Yeah.

735
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:21,150
It's de stigmatized. And the idea
is that in its proper context,

736
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,960
this could be a good thing.
Right? Uh, so I'll admit,

737
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:27,720
I don't know enough about the proper
context of marijuana to know when it would

738
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:31,530
be a quote unquote good thing.
And so can and also be a good thing.

739
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:34,050
This is what I'm trying to do. So
and also I'm, you know, I don't,

740
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,140
the truth is I don't enjoy drinking.
Right. I'm not, I'm not a drinker.

741
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:38,940
I don't enjoy.
I like reality.

742
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:42,750
I like living in reality
and I like experiencing it
totally sober so I've never

743
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:46,320
really felt the urge to to do any
of that stuff. I I hear the pitch,

744
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:51,240
I hear the pitch, but I've never really
felt the interior desire or need to.

745
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,790
Did you completely understand that?

746
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,880
I think that what we're dealing
with though is perceptions
that have been molded

747
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:01,580
by laws that were shaped by tyrants.
That's what I think.

748
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,010
I mean again that's totally
possible and plausible. Yeah, and

749
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,650
historically accurate.
I mean when it comes to prohibition,

750
00:38:09,651 --> 00:38:11,060
prohibition with alcohol didn't work.

751
00:38:11,061 --> 00:38:15,670
Plug prohibition with drugs is just
making the cartels bigger and it's causing

752
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,680
no problems with organized crime.
On a practical level, I agree.

753
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,250
Whether you liked runs
or don't like drugs,

754
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:22,410
government interventionism
is generally a giant fail.

755
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,480
I think our perceptions of what is good
for you and is bad for you is also based

756
00:38:27,551 --> 00:38:30,070
on laws that the government
created ignorantly,

757
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,650
these sweeping psychedelic act of 1970,

758
00:38:32,651 --> 00:38:37,090
which made virtually everything
psychedelic. They could,
they missed a few things,

759
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,860
slipped through the cracks, but all of
the tryptamines and or most of them, um,

760
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,260
the silicide been LSD.

761
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:47,350
All that stuff was made completely
illegal by people really didn't even know

762
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:48,110
what it was.

763
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:53,110
And a lot of that is why we base our
ideas of what's good or bad for you.

764
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:56,110
It's,
it's based on what is legal and what

765
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,910
well, I'll let other people have
done with it on, on this area,

766
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,120
I'll admit not only complete experiential
ignorance but complete evidentiary

767
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:04,490
ignorant.
So I haven't examined the evidence.

768
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,780
I really don't have strong
opinions on any of this stuff.

769
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:11,940
It's one of the bridges that we all
could use between conservative thought in

770
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,550
liberal thought that particularly
for people that are dying,

771
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,850
it's one of the things that
Johns Hopkins found. And, uh,

772
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,120
so there's been other studies done and
there has been therapy done on people

773
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:25,990
that are dying of terminal diseases and
they give them silicide [inaudible] and

774
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:27,700
when they give them these mushroom trips,

775
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,960
they have these beautiful experiences
where they completely accept death and

776
00:39:31,961 --> 00:39:35,460
it's almost a universal
reaction to it that like the,

777
00:39:35,461 --> 00:39:39,580
the amount of people who still experience
a positive benefit months and months

778
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:42,200
after the experience while they're dying,
that they,

779
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:47,201
they say this was an incredibly moving
and powerful moment in my life that

780
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:51,040
allowed me to accept the fact that
my time here is done. [inaudible]

781
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,210
I mean, listen, if, if
that's something that,

782
00:39:53,211 --> 00:39:55,260
that works for people and
that's what it's designed to do,

783
00:39:55,261 --> 00:40:00,120
then I don't know if it's designed well,
he didn't do it. It was designed by God.

784
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,280
It literally mine that that's fine.
I mean,

785
00:40:02,281 --> 00:40:05,400
I think there's also the generalized
religious counter argument that there are

786
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:09,800
no shortcuts, no shortcuts
to happiness. So let's it,

787
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,500
let's pose a shortcut. I don't think,
well, that's the question, right?

788
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:16,710
I mean like let's say that
I could guarantee you that
tomorrow you're going to

789
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:19,950
be a happier person. All you have
to do is take this regimen of,

790
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:24,000
of drugs that you're going to take every
day and it's gonna make you a happier

791
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:25,920
person,
a more well rounded person,

792
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,990
but it's going to permanently
change your brain chemistry.

793
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:30,840
Is that something that you think is good
or is it something you think is bad?

794
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:32,100
Because from a religious perspective,

795
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,380
there is an argument to
be made that these are,

796
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:38,130
this is work you need to do on yourself
without outside aid if possible.

797
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:41,380
If there's cases where he cannot,
then you cannot. But yeah, you know,

798
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,570
turns an interesting thought experiment.

799
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,630
Terence Mckenna had a line about that. Uh,
he said that, uh, there was a joke about,

800
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:51,410
uh, there was a monk and he met Buddha
because Buddha came to town and he said,

801
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:52,820
Buddha, he wanted to impress him. He said,

802
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:55,900
I practiced the city of levitation and uh,

803
00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:00,440
I have done this for 10 years and now I
can walk on water. And the Buddhist says,

804
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:05,000
put the ferries, only a nickel. It's like,

805
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,360
what are you fucking waste of your time?
I'll be like,

806
00:41:08,361 --> 00:41:13,010
you can aid the progression
rapidly with psychedelic drugs.

807
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:14,660
And this is something that Ma,
you know,

808
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:19,661
do you know about maps and their work
with Mtma and soldiers that have had PTSD

809
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,220
and not too much? No, it's,

810
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:25,890
it's phenomenal by giving these
soldiers MTMA therapy, meaning they,

811
00:41:25,891 --> 00:41:30,140
they give them Mtma, which is essentially
what people think of as ecstasy.

812
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:34,400
The street name, they give them pure
Mtma and then they assist them with,

813
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,180
they actually have a psychologist
sit with them, a therapist,

814
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,470
and they go over all these details of
these traumatic events and they come to

815
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:47,471
peace with everything and they've
had profound benefits for soldiers.

816
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,920
And four, we, uh,

817
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,280
some combat journalists did different
people that have been over there.

818
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:54,590
And I've experienced
the horrors of war and,

819
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:58,670
and just general PTSD maybe for people
who have experienced violence attacks.

820
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,040
The is shown to be one of the very best
things we've ever discovered for helping

821
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:05,050
people get past.

822
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,040
Here's to me,

823
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:09,550
and I'm thinking about this on the fly
because this is stuff I don't think of

824
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:11,420
that very much. Um, but it's, it's,

825
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:15,230
there's a complex moral equation to
the extent that if you're talking about

826
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:16,730
somebody who has PTSD,

827
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:20,660
somebody has a condition and the only way
to help that condition is to use these

828
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:23,960
drugs. I've never had a problem with any
of that stuff. Right? I mean I've hit,

829
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,490
my grandfather was, was schizophrenia and
bi, maybe bipolar, maybe schizophrenia.

830
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,750
The diagnosis is not exactly clear.

831
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:31,430
They prescribed him lithium
and made him a lot better.

832
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,920
Would he have been better off struggling
with the schizophrenia? Of course.

833
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:37,400
Not much better than he should have the
lithium and then be able to live in his

834
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:38,234
rational mind.

835
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:42,980
So when there's a problem using drugs to
get past it and work with it is a good

836
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:43,640
thing.

837
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,640
You do run the risk of these sort of
brave new world situation where you have a

838
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,390
group of people who have a certain level
of Ersatz happiness that is not driven

839
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:56,450
by a point of view,

840
00:42:56,451 --> 00:43:00,050
but more by just the these
chemicals in their body.

841
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:04,040
The chemicals affect your point of view
that that is 100% true. But are you,

842
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,710
Yuval Harari talks about maybe
this is the future, right?

843
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:09,650
He talks about the idea that maybe the
future is we just drug ourselves until

844
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:12,770
we're happy. Basically a more
that happiness is the drugs.

845
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,080
Because if you're a scientific
materialist, that's what it is.

846
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:17,510
Happiness is just a bunch of
chemicals flowing through your body.

847
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,840
So if you can bring them
in without self change,

848
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,970
but I do wonder whether that robs people
of a certain level of purpose that,

849
00:43:24,971 --> 00:43:26,660
that the struggle is part of being human.

850
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,630
I think we're changing what it is to be
human just by carrying around phones.

851
00:43:30,631 --> 00:43:31,464
And it just,

852
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,010
I mean that's, that's true.
But I think that that's again,

853
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:39,440
one of the things that I think makes
being a human worthwhile is the idea that

854
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,830
you are struggling. Like I think, I think
the struggle is actually meaningful.

855
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,240
And I think that's why religions tend
to set prophylactic rules sometimes for

856
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:50,600
good and sometimes for ill. So for
example, I, I am addicted to my phone.

857
00:43:50,601 --> 00:43:54,080
I mean there's just no question right?
It's, it's in my hand all the time. And,

858
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,030
but from Friday night to Saturday night,
it's off.

859
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,400
I can't look at it and
forbidding from looking at it.

860
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:01,550
And this breaks the cycle
at least for one day a week.

861
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,790
And that's a good thing.
That makes me better as a human being.

862
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:07,760
He's a limit I set for myself
and then limit that I abide by.

863
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,210
And if you believe in in self mastery,
what,

864
00:44:11,211 --> 00:44:14,570
where's the happy medium between self
mastery and I need a little bit of aid and

865
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:18,170
I think that there, there
is a happy medium there. Um,
but I'm not sure that that,

866
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,730
you know,
drugs are the answer to,

867
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,480
I don't think you're suggesting
drugs or the county. Not

868
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,480
suggesting that there's also a
problem with the word drugs that the,

869
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:30,240
everything is under that blanket and
that blanket can be entirely negative or

870
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:34,950
extremely. But I know, but
that's a pro. I use it too.

871
00:44:34,951 --> 00:44:39,180
I mean it's not, not accusing you
but that that term it's a problem.

872
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,430
It's a problem term
because what these are,

873
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:45,870
are substances that are psychoactive
and some of them can be extremely

874
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:46,531
beneficial.

875
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:51,531
And some of them have short
term experiences that last
with longterm results and

876
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:57,350
I don't think that there's
enough knowledge that I
don't think the people that

877
00:44:57,841 --> 00:45:02,841
are negative against it have experienced
enough of it or have looked at it in an

878
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,201
objective,

879
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:09,060
rational way because I think it's
something that could be here to aid

880
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:09,894
perspective.

881
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:15,050
The give people a chance to think outside
of their normal conditioned way of

882
00:45:15,691 --> 00:45:18,900
thinking that might have been established
by their community or by their church

883
00:45:18,901 --> 00:45:23,610
or by their neighborhood of whatever it
is. Sometimes it a little bit of a break,

884
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,640
a little bit of a mental break from what
your experiencing the in the vibration

885
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:33,480
that you exist on almost every day to
separate from that and to get a look at it

886
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:34,320
from the outside.

887
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:38,790
Sometimes it allows you to have a renewed
perspective that can enhance your life

888
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:42,970
greatly as long as when people reengage
the re-engaging at a level of discipline

889
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,250
thing and this is what we share.

890
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,520
You and I have both disciplined people
and it's one of the things I really

891
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:51,240
respect about you. You're a very hard
worker. You're always on the ball,

892
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:56,270
you're very disciplined and I know that
a lot of conservative people admire that

893
00:45:57,061 --> 00:46:00,510
and they might hear that and folks and
they think that people who are liberal

894
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:03,330
are not disciplined.
They think that they're lazy.

895
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:08,540
It falls into this like week Beta male
sort of category of people that are

896
00:46:08,551 --> 00:46:12,720
progressive and liberal and I think
that's, I think that's a misunderstanding.

897
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,190
I think you guys, you and I both agreed
that the struggle is very important,

898
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,140
but I'd struggle physically so that
I don't have to struggle mentally.

899
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:27,270
I struggle physically so that I can have
a better way of looking at things with

900
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:32,100
less stress. So we have this shared
belief that things should be a struggle.

901
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:33,390
My Street,

902
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:38,010
I forced my struggle on myself so
that I can have a better perspective.

903
00:46:38,011 --> 00:46:40,980
And this is something that
you and I differ on like I
think you exercise, right?

904
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,910
Yes. How often do you do it? I tried
to. Every day. Yeah. Makes a big deal.

905
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,450
It's a huge deal. Yeah. I mean I think we,

906
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,230
we both understand that struggle is a,

907
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:55,680
it's an important part of understanding
yourself. If you do not push yourself,

908
00:46:55,681 --> 00:46:59,100
you, if you do not struggle, you're
not going to really get who you are,

909
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:01,380
what your boundaries are.
And if you're self indulgent,

910
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:04,540
if everyday you're stuffing things
in your face that you want to like,

911
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,540
it's good to have a rule like,
hey,

912
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:11,160
for this next month you can't eat this
or you can't do that or I want you to

913
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,690
start fasting 16 hours a day.

914
00:47:12,691 --> 00:47:16,500
Is it that hard just eat for eight
hours a day and fast for 16? But no,

915
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:20,700
but that just doing something like
that and setting these guidelines for

916
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:22,970
yourself and putting yourself into a,
uh,

917
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:26,950
a discipline state could be extremely
beneficial. Like Jocko Willink,

918
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,280
he says discipline equals freedom.
It is a great formula

919
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,780
and it's real. Well, it is. And again,
it is the basis of a lot of religion.

920
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:36,580
I mean a lot of religion
is very practice based.

921
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:39,100
One of the reasons I like Judaism as
opposed to other religions say very

922
00:47:39,101 --> 00:47:41,200
practice based religion.
You know,

923
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:42,970
sometimes you can take that
too far in one direction,

924
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:47,110
which is I say you need to balance reason
with with dictates, right? That are,

925
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:50,200
that are meant to make you better. But
that goes all the way back to Aristotle.

926
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:52,510
Aristotle talks about how you have
to practice to be good, right?

927
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:53,830
You have to practice to be virtuous.

928
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:58,240
What makes you a virtuous person is
acting repeatedly in accordance with with

929
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:00,520
right reason. And that is setting
rules for yourself, right?

930
00:48:00,521 --> 00:48:03,420
That is not violating every rule.
And I think when,

931
00:48:03,421 --> 00:48:05,320
when we talk about on
the conservative side,

932
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:09,010
you have folks on the left being lazy. I
don't mean that in terms of work. I mean,

933
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:12,010
Mark Zuckerberg is a hard worker,
I assume. I think Jack Dorsey,

934
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:15,070
when he's not getting bitten by by
mosquitoes seems like a hard worker.

935
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,850
But you know, most, most of the people,
most people love jobs are hard workers.

936
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:20,470
I don't think it's about
that. I think it's a, it's,

937
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,500
it's a certain perspective
on the necessity of rules
and the mindset that if I

938
00:48:26,921 --> 00:48:30,090
don't know what a rule is for, I'm going
to remove it. So GK Chesterton has this,

939
00:48:30,091 --> 00:48:31,790
this very famous,
uh,

940
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,630
kind of contrast that he draws between
people who tend to be right wing

941
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:36,850
political and people tend to be
left wing politically. He says,

942
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:40,120
people who tend to be left wing
politically, you're walking through a,

943
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:42,160
they're walking through the woods
and you come across a funds.

944
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,870
You don't know why the
fence is there and you say,

945
00:48:43,871 --> 00:48:45,550
I don't know why this fence is here.
I'm removing it.

946
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:48,970
And the person who's right wing walks
through the forest and sees the fence and

947
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:50,380
says,
I have no idea why the fence is here.

948
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,290
I'm going to go find out why the fence
is here. And then maybe I'll remove it.

949
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,240
And that's the, the kind of Burkian
conservative attitude toward rules. The,

950
00:48:58,241 --> 00:49:01,780
the attitude that this rule was put here
for a reason. Now maybe the wool socks,

951
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:02,890
maybe the rule has to go,

952
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,560
but let's try and figure out what was
at the root of the rule before we just

953
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:08,830
wipe out all the fences and then
try to rebuild from the ground up.

954
00:49:08,831 --> 00:49:09,760
All these new fences.

955
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,670
And that's especially true
in a civilization that's
the most prosperous in free

956
00:49:12,671 --> 00:49:15,120
civilization ever created. I
mean, if the system really sucked,

957
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:15,791
that would be one thing.

958
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:19,600
But I think people are kind of ungrateful
about the fact that we live in the

959
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:22,960
best possible time in the best
possible place. Yeah, that's just,

960
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,780
that's the reality. And everybody who's
so negative about living in America,

961
00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:27,430
it's like,
okay,

962
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:32,460
in 1,901 in 10 American children died
in the first year of life in 1850 the

963
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:38,080
average life expectancy in Europe was an
under 40 so what are you talking about?

964
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,040
What are you talking about?

965
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:43,750
Like our biggest problems today really
for the vast majority of people is that

966
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:47,440
we are too fat or that we are,
well we don't have a job,

967
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:50,530
but we still have somebody who is
basically making sure we have food.

968
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:53,470
Like starvation is not a serious
problem in the United States.

969
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:56,650
There's a problem of poverty, but there's
not a problem of widespread starvation.

970
00:49:56,651 --> 00:49:59,590
In fact, poverty tends to align
with obesity. You know, the,

971
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,170
the state pretty
unbelievably great society.

972
00:50:02,171 --> 00:50:04,900
So maybe you ought to look back at the
roots of that society before we start

973
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:07,390
Willy Nilly tearing up all of the,
all of the moral boundaries.

974
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,790
I think you and I agree that this is
the greatest time ever to be alive.

975
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:13,550
I think what these other folks are
saying is that we can do better.

976
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:16,400
And I think we all agree
with that, but yeah, sure.

977
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:20,360
But to classify this time
as being a terrible time is,

978
00:50:20,361 --> 00:50:23,010
I think wholly inaccurate by the
way. I hit it right and left. Right.

979
00:50:23,011 --> 00:50:24,020
And then this is one of the reasons,
yeah,

980
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,890
the reasons why. I think there's a
certain point where the Trump, Ian,

981
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:30,230
right meets the Bernie Sanders populace
left and that is them walking around

982
00:50:30,231 --> 00:50:33,920
saying how much things suck.
And it's like, no, no, that's
just, that's just wrong.

983
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,500
So it's an amazing time.
It's amazing time for communication too.

984
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,280
It's amazing time for people to kind of
understand other people's perspectives

985
00:50:41,281 --> 00:50:45,770
and points of view, which is one of
the reasons why d platforming and uh,

986
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,510
and silencing of conservatives,
even though I'm not conservative,

987
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,480
bothers the shit out of me. Yeah.
I just think it's a, it's a,

988
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:56,600
it's a non harmonious action in a time
that I think could lead to people having

989
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,820
much more open and much
more balanced committee

990
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,321
occasionally.

991
00:51:01,321 --> 00:51:04,170
I mean this should be the time when we
are having more conversations and more

992
00:51:04,171 --> 00:51:06,720
fun with each other and, and where
we are feeling more entrepreneurial,

993
00:51:06,721 --> 00:51:08,910
we have a better social
safety net than ever.

994
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,810
So what one of the statistics that
really bothers me is that the level of

995
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:16,470
American mobility has declined rapidly
in the United States and the number of

996
00:51:16,471 --> 00:51:19,410
people who are leaving their home state
to go somewhere else to work a job,

997
00:51:19,411 --> 00:51:22,860
for example, is that decades low? Why?

998
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:26,760
It's easier to get anywhere now there are
7 million unfilled jobs I keep hearing

999
00:51:26,761 --> 00:51:31,470
from, you know, folks who I
personally liked, people like
Tucker Carlson, uh, that,

1000
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:34,080
you know, we, you, you grew up in
this small town and the town is dying.

1001
00:51:34,081 --> 00:51:35,370
The industry left.
Well,

1002
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:39,120
you had the government somehow owes it
to you that you get to grow up in this

1003
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:42,000
town and stay in that town.
Even if all the industry left.

1004
00:51:42,001 --> 00:51:45,120
And I just think to
myself, by whom, who, who,

1005
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:48,720
who gave you this guarantee that you get
to stay there? And I know, listen, I'm,

1006
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,060
I'm a lucky guy.
I grew up in a two parent household.

1007
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,160
We didn't grow up wealthy but
we were middle, middle class.

1008
00:51:53,161 --> 00:51:56,610
Like I grew up in a small house in
Burbank with two bedrooms and I had three

1009
00:51:56,611 --> 00:51:57,180
sisters.
Those,

1010
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,540
me and my three sisters and in one
bedroom and one bathroom for six people,

1011
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,820
that's not poor. That's
middleclass. That's a great life.

1012
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,100
And I understand some
people don't have that life,

1013
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:08,610
but one thing that is guaranteed to you
is the opportunity for adventure in this

1014
00:52:08,611 --> 00:52:11,910
country. So go and move. Like why,

1015
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,920
why are we inculcating a feeling of
victim hood in a society where if you make

1016
00:52:16,921 --> 00:52:18,630
the right decisions,
you will do well,

1017
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:22,500
I mean not you might do well if you
make basic, basic right choices,

1018
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,530
you will finish better than you
started in American society. I mean,

1019
00:52:25,531 --> 00:52:28,920
we're talking like the most basic choices
like finish high school and don't have

1020
00:52:28,921 --> 00:52:31,780
a baby out of wedlock and get a job
like you do. Those three things,

1021
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:35,520
and the Brookings Institute says that
you will not be in permanent poverty in

1022
00:52:35,521 --> 00:52:38,520
the United States.
Like that's amazing.

1023
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,800
That was not true for the vast
majority of human history,

1024
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,410
for the vast majority of human history.
You did all of those things.

1025
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,270
There wasn't high school,
but you did all the other things,

1026
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:48,810
and then you were live like a surf
on a farm until he died at age 37 of

1027
00:52:48,811 --> 00:52:52,490
diptheria or something. So it's just the,

1028
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,870
the lack of optimism in a society
where it should be running rampant is,

1029
00:52:55,871 --> 00:52:57,090
is kind of astonishing to me.

1030
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,010
Well, it's perspective, right? I mean,

1031
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,150
rich kids grow up with this
perspective of constantly being rich.

1032
00:53:03,151 --> 00:53:08,070
And people grow up with this perspective
of how they view the United States as

1033
00:53:08,071 --> 00:53:12,330
this negative thing, or that they
don't know how to change their life.

1034
00:53:12,331 --> 00:53:15,480
They don't know how to take action because
they haven't had anyone around them

1035
00:53:15,481 --> 00:53:16,220
that it's done it.

1036
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,440
And that's part of the problem with small
town mentalities is that you kind of

1037
00:53:19,441 --> 00:53:21,870
inherit the vibe of the
people that are around you.

1038
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,640
And if they're ignorant or if they're,
they're shallow minded or if they're,

1039
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,620
they're stuck in this one town and
they're never going to leave and you get

1040
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:32,670
caught in that vibe,

1041
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:36,210
you can one day wake up and you're
32 and you've never done anything.

1042
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,980
I mean this is what events talks about
and Hillbilly Elegy, right? Yeah.

1043
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:41,850
People flourish in these small towns and
they basically been told that they have

1044
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,550
two choices. They can go on welfare or
they can leave. Yeah. And it's like, okay,

1045
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:47,330
fine. We'll go on welfare and everybody
around me is why? Why not is it,

1046
00:53:47,331 --> 00:53:50,010
there's nothing morally deficient
about going on on welfare?

1047
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,200
It is actually one of the,

1048
00:53:51,201 --> 00:53:53,950
the bigger problems I have with the
welfare state generally is that it just

1049
00:53:53,951 --> 00:53:57,440
connects the person receiving the aid
from the person giving the aid one in that

1050
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:00,320
like in our religious community,
to take an example there,

1051
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,670
there's a time a few years
back where a guy came to me,

1052
00:54:02,671 --> 00:54:07,020
I bought some art from him. He is an
artist and a really does good work.

1053
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:07,951
He came to me and he said,

1054
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:10,650
my family doesn't have enough
money to make the rent this month.

1055
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:13,650
Can you offer me in advance on art that
you'll buy somewhere down the road?

1056
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:14,431
And of course,
make sure.

1057
00:54:14,431 --> 00:54:18,960
So I sent him a check and he understood
that five years later he came back to me

1058
00:54:18,961 --> 00:54:20,490
and he said, you know, you still
haven't bought that piece of art.

1059
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:23,750
I owe you a piece of art because he knew
who gave him the money. Right, right.

1060
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,360
And so he was willing to understand
that that was an act of charity and he

1061
00:54:27,361 --> 00:54:30,870
wanted to make sure that that that was
paid back. You see this in Cinderella man,

1062
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:33,780
right? With Russell Crowe, that
moment where he makes his money,

1063
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:38,610
he walks back into the welfare office
and he rolls out a wad. Yeah, like that,

1064
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:42,360
that feeling that the government isn't
just a giant cash machine that is exists.

1065
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:44,850
You pay your money, but that money
actually comes from some worry there.

1066
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:47,340
It's coming from the future because we're
going to have to pay back the debt or

1067
00:54:47,341 --> 00:54:50,670
it's coming from somebody whose tax money
and that we all owe something to each

1068
00:54:50,671 --> 00:54:52,610
other. Right. And by the same token,

1069
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,470
the what I owe to my neighbors
is that if they're in trouble,

1070
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,770
then it is my obligation as a good
person to try and help them out.

1071
00:54:58,771 --> 00:55:00,360
On a personal level. Yes. Right.

1072
00:55:00,361 --> 00:55:02,730
And the charity and religious
communities is extremely high. That's,

1073
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,980
that's the social fabric that
I'm talking about. Yeah. Without,

1074
00:55:04,981 --> 00:55:07,170
without that sort of dutiful
sense to one another,

1075
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:11,940
you can't have rights because if you
just have rights then and and no duties,

1076
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,730
then there will be no one
to take care of each other.

1077
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:17,190
It's why while I'm libertarian,
when it comes to government,

1078
00:55:17,191 --> 00:55:20,700
I'm very conservative when it comes to
the need to build a social fabric and

1079
00:55:20,701 --> 00:55:22,130
communities and,
and,

1080
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:26,700
and have people with working families
and in communities of working families.

1081
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:27,031
Yeah.

1082
00:55:27,031 --> 00:55:30,930
I really think that that's one of the
best things that comes out of religion is

1083
00:55:30,931 --> 00:55:34,590
when you have a tight knit community
like yours and you do have that sense of

1084
00:55:34,591 --> 00:55:38,280
charity where you really are a community
of people that care for each other and

1085
00:55:38,281 --> 00:55:39,114
look out for each other.

1086
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:43,080
The problem is of course doing that large
scale and then the problem is doing it

1087
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:45,570
and some sort of a
nondenominational way where people,

1088
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:49,200
they don't have to have
the exact same beliefs,

1089
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:53,280
but they still share these core values
of community and taking care of each

1090
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:53,431
other.

1091
00:55:53,431 --> 00:55:56,850
I mean that's what people really benefit
from when they've done studies with

1092
00:55:56,851 --> 00:56:00,330
people when they show happiness and
what is happening is correlated with,

1093
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:04,080
it's almost always in correlated with
friends and loved ones and family, right?

1094
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:05,540
It's the most important
thing you can have.

1095
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:06,820
And when it comes to diversity,
you know,

1096
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,920
there's this slogan that
diversity is our strength. Well,

1097
00:56:08,921 --> 00:56:12,050
there is a Robert Putnam, a
sociologist over at harbor. Hey,

1098
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,620
he wrote an entire book about the
social fabric called bowling alone,

1099
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,290
who's kind of the, the pioneer
and the idea of social capital.

1100
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,920
And what he said is that he went in with
the two writing this book with the idea

1101
00:56:20,921 --> 00:56:22,060
that diversity is our strength.

1102
00:56:22,061 --> 00:56:24,850
And then he did some research and what
he found is that ethnic diversity only

1103
00:56:24,851 --> 00:56:26,950
correlates with two things.
And these are his words,

1104
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,730
increased TV watching and increased
protest marches. That's all it unless,

1105
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,480
unless it is within the
boundaries of a common goal.

1106
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:37,120
So if you walk into a church,
very diverse ethnically,

1107
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,100
everybody's got the same general goal,

1108
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:42,190
which is we're worshiping God and one
particular way and we believe in a certain

1109
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:44,260
core set of values.
And now diversity is great.

1110
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,780
Your experience has come to bury your,
you're all aiming in the same direction.

1111
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,070
He gives the example of the army.

1112
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,160
You see bunch of people who go in
diverse group of people, diverse races,

1113
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:51,994
different backgrounds,

1114
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,120
and when you talk to those guys while
they're serving or after they leave,

1115
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:57,760
they don't give a crap about the diverse
backgrounds of the people they were

1116
00:56:57,761 --> 00:56:59,980
serving with. They're all aiming
their guns in the same direction.

1117
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:03,430
Well in the United States, we have to be
aiming our guns in the same direction,

1118
00:57:03,431 --> 00:57:06,910
or we can't really have a
functioning social fabric at all.

1119
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:11,290
Like I'm perfectly willing to give
charity to people who I don't know,

1120
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,970
who still believe,
like I do,

1121
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:16,510
that America is a fantastic country
rooted in immutably good principles.

1122
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,890
But that starts to break down when I'm
being asked to give charity just on a

1123
00:57:20,891 --> 00:57:24,100
personal level to somebody who believes
that America is fundamentally evil.

1124
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,260
It needs to be torn out at its roots and
replaced with something better, right?

1125
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:30,490
Because now we're not aiming in the
same direction. So on a human level,

1126
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:33,520
I care about you, but on
a, but on a social level,

1127
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,950
if I have a choice between somebody
who basically agrees with me about

1128
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:38,770
fundamental values and somebody
who is diametrically opposed,

1129
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:42,070
I'm gonna get my money to the person
who basically agrees with me on those

1130
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:42,970
fundamental values.
And again,

1131
00:57:42,971 --> 00:57:44,890
I don't think those fundamental
values have to be religious.

1132
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,650
I don't think you have to be a god
believer to receive charity from me or I

1133
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:50,650
don't think I should have to be, uh,
an atheist receive charity from you.

1134
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,780
But I do think that you do have to take
into consideration a few things and now

1135
00:57:55,781 --> 00:57:57,490
we're on the same page,
personal responsibility.

1136
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:02,320
The idea that you do live in a free
country just historically and relatively

1137
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:05,170
speaking, this is a free country,
which means decision making is on you.

1138
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:09,370
So man up a little bit.
They that the decisions that you make,

1139
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,940
we should all have sympathy for people
who have had worse lives and worse

1140
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:15,610
experiences. But in the
end, if you are capable,

1141
00:58:15,611 --> 00:58:19,420
if you are not fundamentally disabled
in some way that you need to make a plan

1142
00:58:19,421 --> 00:58:21,300
for your own life and
then you need to do that.

1143
00:58:21,301 --> 00:58:24,160
Like are you more willing to give charity
to somebody who has a plan for how to

1144
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:27,430
get themselves out of the hole?
And of course, of course that,

1145
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,490
but that relies on that person
feeling an obligation to do that.

1146
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:34,760
I also think that what you're talking
about with the charity within the

1147
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,890
community is so much more,

1148
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:40,850
there's so much more connection then
charity from the government when you're

1149
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,320
talking about welfare.

1150
00:58:42,321 --> 00:58:46,040
The problem is that
there's this dissolving of
responsibility because it's just

1151
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:49,070
a check that comes in that you feel
like, wow, this is a rich country.

1152
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,970
I'm owed this anyway. The, and
you know, and when I was a kid,

1153
00:58:52,971 --> 00:58:54,120
we were on welfare and we,

1154
00:58:54,121 --> 00:58:59,121
we used food stamps and I remember being
very ashamed of it and feeling really

1155
00:58:59,601 --> 00:59:02,630
weird that we were that poor,
that we needed help from the government,

1156
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:07,310
but my parents worked their way out of it.
They were young,

1157
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:08,150
they had a kid.

1158
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,510
My guess is that I guess is that the,

1159
00:59:10,511 --> 00:59:12,580
the social stigma probably
has something to do with that.

1160
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:15,460
Meaning that I'm sure they didn't want
to be on welfare and they don't want to

1161
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:17,950
be on food stamps. Contrast your
story with Adam Carolla's, right?

1162
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:21,950
Add Adam talks all the time about how
his parents were also on food stamps and

1163
00:59:21,951 --> 00:59:24,320
welfare and they just didn't give a shit.
And then they were just,

1164
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:29,000
and he always resented that
he thought that was bad. He
said like, you could work,

1165
00:59:29,001 --> 00:59:29,834
why aren't you?

1166
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,170
And that gave him the impetus to get
up and do what what Adam has done.

1167
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,420
So you know that that kind of,

1168
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:39,140
it's not pick yourself up by the
bootstrap because helping hands are good,

1169
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:44,030
but it is. If I, if I were capable of
picking myself up by my bootstraps,

1170
00:59:44,031 --> 00:59:47,180
would I do so? Yeah. And if the answer
is yes, then we're all on the same team.

1171
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,313
Well there's,

1172
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,190
this is a real problem too.

1173
00:59:50,191 --> 00:59:54,960
And that some people just get a
horrible hand dealt to them at birth.

1174
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:58,500
There was parents that really are
doing a terrible job raising them.

1175
00:59:58,501 --> 01:00:00,300
They're fucking him up
every step of the way.

1176
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:03,280
You're around a bunch of people that
are criminals. Everybody's fucking up.

1177
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:06,780
There's no examples of anybody
that's doing well. I mean,

1178
01:00:06,781 --> 01:00:10,410
it's one of the unique things about the
internet today is that a kid that's in

1179
01:00:10,411 --> 01:00:15,060
that environment can get ahold of maybe
something that you've said or something

1180
01:00:15,061 --> 01:00:18,270
that you know, someone else has
said and start reading books.

1181
01:00:18,271 --> 01:00:21,780
And start taking in information that
gives them a different perspective and

1182
01:00:21,781 --> 01:00:25,380
fueled that perspective
with more motivational stuff
and more information and

1183
01:00:25,381 --> 01:00:28,680
education. And sometimes kids, just
like you were saying with Adam Carolla,

1184
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:32,160
the grow up with these parents
that are just not ambitious at all.

1185
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:35,730
So they become very ambitious and they
worked very hard to not be like them.

1186
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,740
I mean,
sometimes it's good to see that example,

1187
01:00:37,741 --> 01:00:41,990
but most of the time it's just fucking
hard for them to reprogram their heads.

1188
01:00:41,991 --> 01:00:42,100
Right.
Well

1189
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,950
for sure it's hard to do that and it's
also hard. I really think that there's,

1190
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:48,220
there's a lot of focus in the country
right now on raising awareness,

1191
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:49,750
which is fine, you know, raise it,

1192
01:00:49,751 --> 01:00:52,630
raising awareness of our history and all
the bad things that we've done. Yeah,

1193
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:53,741
good.
I mean people,

1194
01:00:53,741 --> 01:00:56,230
people should know about
all the good things and all
the bad things, right? It's,

1195
01:00:56,231 --> 01:00:58,210
its history is history,
but this,

1196
01:00:58,211 --> 01:01:03,010
this incessant focus on the idea that
people's lives are getting better by

1197
01:01:03,011 --> 01:01:05,710
suggesting that they're perennial victims
in the United States. I just don't,

1198
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,810
I don't understand how
that's a good thing. Yeah.

1199
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:11,470
Like as as a historically a member
of a historically persecuted group.

1200
01:01:11,471 --> 01:01:14,290
If I had grown up and my parents had
said to me, no matter what you do,

1201
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:17,020
you will be put under the
thumb of the dominant society.

1202
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,560
That's a pretty horrible message to hell
to a kid and I think that's true for

1203
01:01:20,561 --> 01:01:23,470
politicians, again, on both sides of
the aisle. I think you get it from,

1204
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,350
from president Trump when it comes to
some rural areas where it's like, well,

1205
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:29,710
it's the Mexicans and the Chinese coming
in to steal your jobs and you're under

1206
01:01:29,711 --> 01:01:32,710
the thumb of of people who are trying
to destroy you and on the other side of

1207
01:01:32,711 --> 01:01:34,110
the aisle, people who say, well, you're,

1208
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:37,390
you're in the inner city and therefore
the cops are racist against you and want

1209
01:01:37,391 --> 01:01:41,290
to destroy you and everybody's out to get
you. And it's like, well, how about this?

1210
01:01:41,291 --> 01:01:42,250
How about like again,

1211
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,390
the single best thing you can do for
yourself is make basic decisions that are

1212
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:50,920
entirely within your control. Unless you
are, unless you are raped, God forbid,

1213
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:55,180
single motherhood is a choice that
you get to make about your life.

1214
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:59,050
This is a choice you get to make about
your life finishing high school unless

1215
01:01:59,051 --> 01:02:02,860
you are legitimately disabled in some way.
I mean,

1216
01:02:02,861 --> 01:02:05,470
especially in La USD where you basically
have to be able to read at third grade

1217
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:08,500
level to finish high school. You
know, just just like these are,

1218
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:11,590
these are decisions,
personal decision making if you want.

1219
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:15,070
I've never seen somebody life get
better by complaining about reality.

1220
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:18,820
I've seen a lot of people's lives get
better by acknowledging that reality is

1221
01:02:18,821 --> 01:02:21,270
what it is and then making personal
decisions to make their lives better.

1222
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:22,610
And that's considered non-compassionate.

1223
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:26,670
But it seems to me the essence
of compassion sometimes
he's saying at least make

1224
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:29,310
the baseline decision. If you make the
baseline decisions and then you'll fail,

1225
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:30,360
we can talk about what happened.

1226
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:32,170
I don't think it's non-compassionate.

1227
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:34,460
I think it's pragmatic
and I think you're right,

1228
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:39,790
but I also think that there's some
people that are there in situations that

1229
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:45,830
require something external to,
to assist them there,

1230
01:02:45,831 --> 01:02:48,530
their the way their life has been set up.

1231
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:53,300
And this is what I think when people
think about compassion and people pulling

1232
01:02:53,301 --> 01:02:56,000
themselves up by their bootstraps.
If you have a real,

1233
01:02:56,001 --> 01:03:00,440
if you really have an honest and accurate
assessment of extreme poverty and

1234
01:03:00,441 --> 01:03:01,430
terrible neighborhoods,

1235
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:06,530
it's not as simple as do something
good to better your life.

1236
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:09,570
Part of it is you got to
fucking stay alive, right?

1237
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:15,310
You're surrounded by people who either
have committed crimes or we'll commit

1238
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:18,620
crimes.
You mean one out of every four people,

1239
01:03:18,621 --> 01:03:22,040
you run into my be a criminal in the
worst neighborhood in the country. Okay.

1240
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:24,570
This is what it does for sure,
but I think we have to,

1241
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,550
this is where we recognize
what government is good at.

1242
01:03:26,551 --> 01:03:28,650
Government is good at two things,
cutting the other people,

1243
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,790
cutting checks from other people's money.

1244
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:32,510
They're great at it and
they'll see they're,

1245
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:34,560
they're right on top of those
parking tickets by the way,

1246
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,750
to make sure that they can sign it
and they're, they're amazing at it.

1247
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:40,330
So seizing your money and paying money,
they're very good at and,

1248
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,150
and pointing a gun at people,
right?

1249
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:45,330
These are the two things that government
was built to do was collect taxes and

1250
01:03:45,331 --> 01:03:49,260
pay out money and then point
guns at people, right? This
is what government does.

1251
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:54,180
So which of those two things would you
apply in a situation where there's just a

1252
01:03:54,181 --> 01:03:57,780
complete lack of social capital because
cutting a check isn't going to do it

1253
01:03:57,781 --> 01:04:00,480
alone. Where's that check? Go to
the parents who are not doing,

1254
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:01,980
not able to protect their kids.

1255
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,380
It's one thing if you're enabling the
parents who move out of that community or

1256
01:04:04,381 --> 01:04:07,320
something. Right. Um, but that's
why I say you have to attach,

1257
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,480
if you're going to do the
government welfare thing,

1258
01:04:09,481 --> 01:04:11,700
you got to attach it to a plan.
It can't just be here's a check.

1259
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:14,670
Enjoy your life because
of what is the plan.

1260
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:18,410
No, was terrible communities.
You live in an apartment complex.

1261
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,610
I mean,
here's the reality.

1262
01:04:19,611 --> 01:04:23,570
I think that the plan very often when
it comes to a crime ridden area is the

1263
01:04:23,571 --> 01:04:26,390
other side of what the government does,
which is you need more cops in that area.

1264
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,820
I think.
I think that the great lie that though,

1265
01:04:28,821 --> 01:04:30,590
that these communities
that are crime rate,

1266
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,440
and I'm talking about White Apalasia
and I'm talking about, yes, yeah.

1267
01:04:33,441 --> 01:04:36,770
Black inner cities. These, these
communities do not need fewer cops.

1268
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:39,800
They need more cops because at the
preconditioned to investment in those

1269
01:04:39,801 --> 01:04:43,130
communities and increased tax dollars
in those communities and increase social

1270
01:04:43,131 --> 01:04:46,190
capital in those communities is people
not getting shot every five seconds. Yeah.

1271
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:50,000
I mean that's why the worst thing that
can happen to law abiding minorities is

1272
01:04:50,001 --> 01:04:52,160
for the cops to abandoned
areas where crime is high.

1273
01:04:52,161 --> 01:04:53,480
It just doesn't make any sense.

1274
01:04:53,481 --> 01:04:56,270
And that's not just me saying that
Jane Levy's reporter at the La Times,

1275
01:04:56,271 --> 01:05:00,770
very much on the left has said the same
thing while biting people want crime

1276
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:01,311
rates to go down,

1277
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:04,190
like conditions have to change in a
community for conditions to change in the

1278
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:05,024
community.

1279
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:07,340
See The wild,
uh,

1280
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:12,200
well the whites who wild and wonderful
whites of West Virginia. No, it was, uh,

1281
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:16,580
it was it Johnny Knoxville. Did he produce
that documentary? I think he did. Right,

1282
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:21,880
dude, it's about this family that lives
in West Virginia that has just a bunch of

1283
01:05:21,881 --> 01:05:24,640
psychotic criminals.
There's these crazy white people,

1284
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:28,330
the kids drinking mountain dew and doing
back flips on the bed and they're all

1285
01:05:28,331 --> 01:05:32,110
on pills. It's bananas and
it gives you this insight,

1286
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:35,650
like if you are in this community,
if you were in this family,

1287
01:05:35,651 --> 01:05:37,330
and this is obviously very extreme family,

1288
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:40,450
but there's many more of them out
there that have not been documented.

1289
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:42,580
If you are in that community,

1290
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:47,640
good fucking luck getting out.
Right. Good luck. The the,

1291
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:51,250
the money that you get other than
Welfare's from selling pills, you know,

1292
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:53,650
everybody's on these pills
so you're all whacked out.

1293
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,700
You don't know what the fuck is going on.
Half the day you're on opiates. I mean,

1294
01:05:57,701 --> 01:06:01,570
it is a bananas environment and there's
a lot of people like that in this

1295
01:06:01,571 --> 01:06:02,260
country for sure.

1296
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:06,370
And in poor Latino communities and
poor white communities in poor black

1297
01:06:06,371 --> 01:06:07,204
communities.

1298
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,850
The idea that these people are just
going to pull themselves up by their

1299
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:13,150
bootstraps, it's crazy. I just
think they don't have a plan.

1300
01:06:13,151 --> 01:06:15,310
And I think if we really
want to help them,

1301
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:20,290
there's gotta be some way where you can
give these people the opportunity to

1302
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:24,400
step out of that pattern,
whatever that community centers,

1303
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:26,470
outreach programs, whatever
it is. I don't know what it,

1304
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,300
I mean the truth is,
the truth is that historically speaking,

1305
01:06:29,301 --> 01:06:31,180
it was people actually going to church.
Yeah.

1306
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:36,480
There's a good lot of good
church going person. Right.

1307
01:06:36,481 --> 01:06:40,530
But I absolutely recognize that there's
a lot of good involved and having that

1308
01:06:40,531 --> 01:06:41,050
framework

1309
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:43,390
right. And, and that that's,
I'm not sure that that's,

1310
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:48,400
I don't think you can create sort of a
fake social fabric with just a government

1311
01:06:48,401 --> 01:06:52,000
welfare system. Like it just, it, it
hasn't worked. I mean, disability exists.

1312
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,040
I'd been increasing every
year. It's, it's not,

1313
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:56,420
this is a question I asked
Andrew getting, actually, sorry.

1314
01:06:56,421 --> 01:07:00,490
Our episode comes out on Sunday and
obviously Andrew is a big fan of ubi,

1315
01:07:00,491 --> 01:07:01,450
universal basic income.

1316
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:05,950
And I'm not averse to the idea of ubi in
a future where legitimately 50% of the

1317
01:07:05,951 --> 01:07:08,440
population can't work because they've
all been automated out of existence.

1318
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,190
And all of this,

1319
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:13,330
but there's one section in his book
where Andrew Talks about how if we cut

1320
01:07:13,331 --> 01:07:14,770
people a check for ubi,

1321
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:19,830
then they will spend their extra time
creating art and engaging in hobbies that

1322
01:07:19,841 --> 01:07:21,430
they like.
And I just thought to myself,

1323
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:23,920
I've been at said it to him
like people are on disability.

1324
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,470
I don't what they're doing right.
And if you're on disability,

1325
01:07:26,471 --> 01:07:28,120
the people you're talking
about who are suffering,

1326
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,880
they're not out there writing
poetry. Right? I mean the, the,

1327
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:35,860
the rise of the opioid epidemic and
people who are oding on drugs and all this

1328
01:07:35,861 --> 01:07:39,160
stuff that's in precisely the same
demographic you're talking about.

1329
01:07:39,161 --> 01:07:41,740
You're just talking about a check from
one place as opposed to another place.

1330
01:07:41,741 --> 01:07:43,510
I don't, I don't really see
how that solves the problem.

1331
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:47,320
I think we have a crisis
of purpose. Yes. Right now.

1332
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:50,980
And I don't think that that crisis of
purpose is solvable on the one hand by

1333
01:07:50,981 --> 01:07:52,120
changing our trade rules.

1334
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,580
And I also don't think that that
Christ is a purpose is solvable by,

1335
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:56,410
by cutting a, uh, a government check.

1336
01:07:56,411 --> 01:07:59,250
I just don't think that
that's how people are wired.

1337
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,590
I absolutely agree with you that
there is a crisis of purpose.

1338
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,470
My concern is about
automation and my concern,

1339
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,070
and obviously I haven't really studied
this other than talking to Andrew Yang

1340
01:08:09,071 --> 01:08:12,910
and talking to Elon Musk and a few other
people that are proponents of universal

1341
01:08:12,911 --> 01:08:16,130
basic income, they think that there's
going to be such a massive loss

1342
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:21,080
of jobs in such a short period of time
from people that are non skilled laborers

1343
01:08:21,081 --> 01:08:22,910
and it's going to go away.

1344
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:25,790
There's millions and millions of jobs
and these people are not going to have

1345
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:27,840
anything and that it could be chaos.
So there's,

1346
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,890
there's two problems that come up there
and this is where Andrew's book is

1347
01:08:30,891 --> 01:08:34,220
interesting because probably number
one is that the people will be poor.

1348
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:37,190
They won't have a source of income.
Yeah, UBI solve that the other quarter,

1349
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:40,400
but does it even, it gives him $1,000 a
month because he opted, right. I mean,

1350
01:08:40,401 --> 01:08:40,671
even if,

1351
01:08:40,671 --> 01:08:44,890
even if he just had a
Swedish redistribution system
and the average tax rate

1352
01:08:44,891 --> 01:08:47,630
went up to 60% or something,
it might let,

1353
01:08:47,631 --> 01:08:50,590
let's say we could solve the money
problem for a second, which, you know,

1354
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,000
without tanking the economy,
which is questionable,

1355
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:53,960
but let's say we could do that,

1356
01:08:53,961 --> 01:08:56,840
we could add trillions of dollars to
the budget every year and we could tell

1357
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,330
that I'm still not sure that
that solves the deeper problem,

1358
01:08:59,331 --> 01:09:02,060
which is that when people lose
jobs, they lose purpose, right?

1359
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:05,350
So I'm not sure that UBI solves
that problem. As I say, we have,

1360
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:08,390
we have a rich social welfare network in
the United States and we're seeing this

1361
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:11,780
stuff happen anyway. You
know, I'm, I'm a little bit,

1362
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,940
I'm a little bit less
catastrophic by a little bit,

1363
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:16,960
I mean a fair bit less catastrophic in
my thinking about automation then then

1364
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:19,910
either Andrew Yang or Elon Musk think
that people will be able to adapt quick

1365
01:09:19,911 --> 01:09:21,680
enough to avoid the problems.

1366
01:09:21,681 --> 01:09:25,040
They'll realize the jobs aren't there
anymore and they'll just naturally

1367
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:28,460
gravitate towards other
professors. Anything over
time that people will do that.

1368
01:09:28,461 --> 01:09:30,070
But they're not always the same people.
I,

1369
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:31,990
there's all these shifts
in the economy and the,

1370
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:34,730
the ideal economic model has a truck
or becoming a coder. Right. But that's,

1371
01:09:34,731 --> 01:09:39,350
that's not reading. It was the whole learn
to code fiasco kicked off of Twitter.

1372
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:42,590
Right. And it still does it. Yeah.
Apparently if you say it to journalists,

1373
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,870
then that's, that's very bad. If you
say, what's a coach with truck? Yeah,

1374
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:48,560
that's what it was. Code to a trucker.
If you say learn to code to a trucker,

1375
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:52,190
then that's just you being helpful.
If you say learn to code to a journalist,

1376
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:53,840
then that is targeted
harassment on Twitter.

1377
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:57,000
That's where that someone sends
it to me. Well, I meant work.

1378
01:09:57,010 --> 01:10:01,670
Twitter doesn't care about you. I
can say whatever I want, but it's a,

1379
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:05,510
but yeah, I mean I think that, but
if you just say it to a friend, hey,

1380
01:10:05,511 --> 01:10:07,910
fuck face learned to code that,
I don't know,

1381
01:10:07,911 --> 01:10:11,600
it's your friend could report you to the
censorship board over at 20 it's such a

1382
01:10:11,601 --> 01:10:12,920
dumb thing to take people out for.

1383
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:17,420
It's one of the best examples of like
how censorship step oversteps its

1384
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:21,770
boundaries and becomes almost like satire.
Yeah. It's, it's real. It's really,

1385
01:10:21,771 --> 01:10:26,120
really absurd. This is the
biggest aggression ever.
Learn to code. Learn to code.

1386
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,473
That's something,
look,

1387
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:31,130
this is a stupid thing that
someone said about coal miners.

1388
01:10:31,131 --> 01:10:33,920
They really said that about coal miners
that maybe they could learn to code.

1389
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,780
And so everybody,
like what the fuck?

1390
01:10:35,781 --> 01:10:38,660
And so learned to code became a joke
and became something that you would mock

1391
01:10:38,661 --> 01:10:42,470
people right there. Is there
an explanation for it was
so crazy. It was like, no.

1392
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:46,700
Then learn to code got connected with
this other stuff.

1393
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:50,690
That's the Hitler owned a dog document,
right? It's like dogs are bad.

1394
01:10:50,691 --> 01:10:52,940
Hitler owned one. Okay.
White supremacists are bad.

1395
01:10:52,941 --> 01:10:55,310
They used the phrase learned to code.
That means if you say learn to code,

1396
01:10:55,311 --> 01:10:59,840
you're a white supremacist.
We lost the frog. That fucking
frog. It feels good, man.

1397
01:10:59,841 --> 01:11:04,430
Frog. That's what happened to pepe the
frog. They turned the fricking fraud gay.

1398
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:09,140
I mean, yeah. Oh yeah. But yeah, I
mean it's not as far as automation.

1399
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:13,170
Um, you know, there's constantly
people saying this is the,

1400
01:11:13,171 --> 01:11:14,390
the Nicholas Nassim

1401
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,660
tell lead view of reality,

1402
01:11:15,661 --> 01:11:18,030
which that the Black Swan incident
can happen any any second.

1403
01:11:18,031 --> 01:11:21,570
So watch out for it versus the sort
of Steven pinker view of reality,

1404
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:24,690
which is the black swan incident is called
the Black Swan Internet because it's

1405
01:11:24,691 --> 01:11:28,190
a black swan incident, meaning
that it happens incredibly
rarely. I, you know, the,

1406
01:11:28,191 --> 01:11:32,850
the idea that we are on the verge of a
catastrophic drop in job numbers because

1407
01:11:32,851 --> 01:11:36,960
of the automation of trucking for example.
I'm not sure that I buy it.

1408
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,750
The reason I don't buy it is because
you still are gonna need someone sitting

1409
01:11:39,751 --> 01:11:42,910
behind the wheel of that truck there human
drivers on the road. Uh, it's going to,

1410
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,540
there will be a gradual transition
away from some of these jobs,

1411
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:49,590
Andrew getting talks about radiologists
and how radiologists are going to be

1412
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,410
priced out of the market by computers
that can do a better job of diagnosing

1413
01:11:52,411 --> 01:11:55,530
tumors first of all. Awesome.
Right? I mean, that's, that's good.

1414
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:59,870
First of all that brings down cost end.
You won't get cancer as advanced.

1415
01:11:59,871 --> 01:12:03,140
So that'd be, that'd be a good thing.
And then second of all, what, what, uh,

1416
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:06,780
a lot of technology studies
have had tended to show is
that technology just gets

1417
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:09,010
integrated into different
Wagan in particular career.

1418
01:12:09,011 --> 01:12:11,190
So there will be jobs that
are eliminated for sure.

1419
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,470
There'll be jobs we haven't heard
of that will be created also.

1420
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:18,660
And mostly technology will, will become
more of a productivity aid to, to people.

1421
01:12:18,661 --> 01:12:22,830
So this is true in factories.
Jobs have been lost in factories.

1422
01:12:22,831 --> 01:12:25,500
It's the best example of where jobs are
lost, but it's mostly turn offices, right?

1423
01:12:25,501 --> 01:12:28,440
How many office jobs had been
created because you have computers?

1424
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:30,780
What's more office jobs exist
because I write by hand.

1425
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,490
Do you think that this is akin
to like a government bailout?

1426
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:37,840
Like the idea of the government bailout
was like the banks are too big to fail

1427
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:39,280
and some people thought,
you know what,

1428
01:12:39,281 --> 01:12:43,330
you got to let them fail so you figure
out why they failed and we'll never have

1429
01:12:43,331 --> 01:12:47,260
it happen again. If there is this
thing and the government steps in says,

1430
01:12:47,261 --> 01:12:47,770
wait a minute,

1431
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:50,260
I know you lost all your jobs are going
to give you $1,000 you don't have to

1432
01:12:50,261 --> 01:12:53,320
figure it out $1,000 a month.
And some people go, okay,

1433
01:12:53,321 --> 01:12:54,610
I'm not going to figure it out now.

1434
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:59,730
Whereas those people might have gone on
a fear filled journey to try to figure

1435
01:13:01,901 --> 01:13:04,340
out their purpose in life
because now they're stirred,

1436
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:06,570
stuck where their job doesn't
exist anymore. So there

1437
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:09,230
what did it their owner, I mean
they have to act. There is,

1438
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,750
there is an innovation that comes from,
from a welfare check.

1439
01:13:11,751 --> 01:13:14,240
I mean there are people
who become dependent on
government then they're used to

1440
01:13:14,241 --> 01:13:16,710
being dependent on government that
that stuff is true. It does happen.

1441
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:17,840
I mean and listen,

1442
01:13:17,841 --> 01:13:21,380
Milton Friedman made an
argument for universal basic
income as a replacement for

1443
01:13:21,381 --> 01:13:22,980
the welfare system.
There.

1444
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:25,970
There is another problem with universal
basic income that I asked Andrew about

1445
01:13:25,971 --> 01:13:30,860
also. And that was, you know, one of the,
one of the big issues is that poor people,

1446
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:33,290
very often people who are
permanently impoverished,

1447
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:34,460
not people who are temporarily poor,

1448
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:37,700
but they tend not to spend money where we
think they ought to spend money, right?

1449
01:13:37,701 --> 01:13:40,730
They're not taking that money and they're
not putting it into education or into

1450
01:13:40,731 --> 01:13:44,210
the [inaudible] Ho hos and cigarettes.
The average,

1451
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:48,880
the average person who is making less
than, I think it was $16,000 a year,

1452
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,790
spending $400 here and
lottery tickets or man,

1453
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,780
it's legitimately just flushing your
money down the toilet, you know,

1454
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:57,410
so it's so how do you, aren't you just
going to end up back in the same place?

1455
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:01,220
You can go in six months where people
took that money and used it in ways that

1456
01:14:01,221 --> 01:14:04,420
actually didn't benefit them. And at a
certain point, the question is, are your,

1457
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:05,500
do you own your decisions?
Do,

1458
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:10,400
do not own your decisions and what level
of incompetence or inability do we say

1459
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:11,620
you no longer your decisions.

1460
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:13,690
And so we're just going to take care
of you on a permanent basis. That's,

1461
01:14:13,691 --> 01:14:16,330
that's really the, the,
the question here. I think,

1462
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,510
yeah, when you're talking about welfare,
we're looking at worst case scenario,

1463
01:14:20,511 --> 01:14:20,781
right?

1464
01:14:20,781 --> 01:14:25,130
Where someone does get dependent upon
the welfare state and does use that money

1465
01:14:25,131 --> 01:14:28,100
frivolously and does make poor decisions.

1466
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,910
But then there's gotta be other people
that are single moms that, you know,

1467
01:14:31,911 --> 01:14:34,630
maybe had a kid with some fucking asshole.

1468
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,000
It doesn't want to pay and it is a piece
of shit and they have to hide from him

1469
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:40,540
and they're just trying to feed
their kids. Yeah. For sure.

1470
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:44,570
Those people exist to 100%
have a community to, to,

1471
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,640
to help them out.

1472
01:14:45,641 --> 01:14:48,650
And maybe they're not a part of a church
and maybe they don't have a good group

1473
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:49,221
of neighbors.

1474
01:14:49,221 --> 01:14:52,700
Maybe they had to move somewhere for work
and they got stuck in some place where

1475
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:53,534
they don't know what study.

1476
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:57,210
But it, I think part of
this is to recognize that
incentives matter on both ends.

1477
01:14:57,211 --> 01:15:00,240
So the idea is that you give some people
more money and they'll, they'll do well.

1478
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,820
It's also true that if you create a
welfare system that benefit single

1479
01:15:02,821 --> 01:15:04,800
motherhood, you will get more
single motherhood. I mean, the,

1480
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:07,890
the single motherhood rate in the black
community before welfare was 20% now

1481
01:15:07,891 --> 01:15:11,770
it's 70% in the white community, it was
like 5% now it's 40% you've said that

1482
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:16,400
out of wedlock children and having
a kid when you're young is like,

1483
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:18,140
it's a terrible idea for your life.

1484
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:22,520
But what do you recommend
to have kids avoid that?

1485
01:15:22,521 --> 01:15:23,840
Are you one of those
people that thinks of it?

1486
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,870
Start without that thing on
it? No. Condoms. Since we were
saying like, don't, don't,

1487
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:31,700
don't, don't have unprotected sex. I
mean like this, this is not, it's not,

1488
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:36,170
pardon my, my fake cursing. It's not
effing rocket science. I mean like,

1489
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:40,670
like apologizing for not
curse them. Apologizing for
not cursing. Uh, yeah, it's,

1490
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:42,300
it's,
it's not rocket science.

1491
01:15:42,301 --> 01:15:45,450
This is one the Holy Father's kids make
mistakes in. I mean, that's what happens.

1492
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:49,350
And then if the government pays for
those mistakes, it becomes less.

1493
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:54,720
So what should, what should happen? Should
the kids suffer? So the WHO presents,

1494
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:59,190
should it be? Should it be worked out?
I mean it depends on the situation.

1495
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:02,730
You know, if their parents available
to the kid, presumably the parents,

1496
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:07,380
the grandparents would take
a pretty active role in the,
in the raising that kid.

1497
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:09,660
Awesome. They, they're
there. Well, how about this?

1498
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:12,060
How about we assume that if you
are old enough to get pregnant,

1499
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:15,930
then you're old enough to, let's, let's
talk about a 17 year old or 18 year old.

1500
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:20,790
Used to be shotgun marriages
thing. Uh, and uh, and really
like that's a good idea.

1501
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,670
I think the idea of parents staying
together for the sake of a kid that they

1502
01:16:23,671 --> 01:16:26,400
accidentally board is absolutely
a good idea. Yes. I think that,

1503
01:16:26,401 --> 01:16:28,710
I think that is a better idea than
the man walking away and the kid being

1504
01:16:28,711 --> 01:16:30,810
without a man in the house.

1505
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:33,930
So you're thinking of their childhood
and a lot of people figure a way to work

1506
01:16:33,931 --> 01:16:36,930
it out. Yes. And if they were both
reasonable, they could do that. Yeah.

1507
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,490
And I think that that by the way,

1508
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:43,110
a huge percentage of American births in
the forties and 50s were exactly this,

1509
01:16:43,111 --> 01:16:47,610
or a lot of seven month babies in the
forties and 50s something like 30 to 40%

1510
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:52,610
of all kids born in the 30s and forties
and 50s we're seven months babies or

1511
01:16:52,611 --> 01:16:57,240
would somebody got knocked up and then
the expectation was nagging like you did

1512
01:16:57,241 --> 01:16:58,630
the, you did the crime,
now you do the time. Right.

1513
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:03,360
And he did this dot puts
people and relationship prison.

1514
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:08,220
Good then don't then don't ask, don't
die. And find somebody, find them,

1515
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:09,530
find somebody to have with you.

1516
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:12,560
Find somebody to have sex with who
you actually think is worthy of a

1517
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:16,460
relationship right now.
Or I'm on pornography is available to you.

1518
01:17:16,461 --> 01:17:19,910
Like figure it out. You're okay with
that. Um, on a moral level, yeah, no,

1519
01:17:19,911 --> 01:17:20,720
but if I'm going to,

1520
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,450
if I'm going to compare that to having
a baby out of wedlock, then yeah,

1521
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:25,270
this is what I think about pornography.

1522
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:29,160
They could stop now and
we're good forever. But yeah,

1523
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:34,960
I think you guys, there's no,
there's no supply and demand problem.

1524
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:39,400
And they kill like Megan it.
You guys are a bunch of freaks.

1525
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:43,010
I mean there's no,
it's like a business.

1526
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:46,450
It's almost like you have excess
houses that stack up to the moon.

1527
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:50,260
Like there's no way everyone's
going to live in all those houses.

1528
01:17:50,261 --> 01:17:51,094
Why do you keep making house?

1529
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,570
There's no way one person has ever jerked
off to every video that ever existed.

1530
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,560
It doesn't. It's not possible. It's like,

1531
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:02,050
and it's also like other forms of
media where they just stack up.

1532
01:18:02,051 --> 01:18:05,600
I never really thought of that until we
get the backlog of Internet pornography

1533
01:18:05,601 --> 01:18:08,470
and you're like, cut, I'm, you know, I'm a
month behind now. Just think about music,

1534
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:09,010
right?

1535
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:13,810
There's all the music that existed before
in the 50s and 60s and 70s and the 80s

1536
01:18:13,811 --> 01:18:16,690
and there's new shit every goddamn day.
It never ends.

1537
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:20,650
It's this overwhelming library
of stuff that we have. Yeah,

1538
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:24,360
Dick's bucket. It would, it would be good
if that music changed from time to time.

1539
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:29,470
Yeah. At the same song recorded seven
different ways, you know? But what could,

1540
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,540
should you listen to?
What do you think I listened to you today?

1541
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:35,310
Listen to classic jazz and classical of
course. Yeah. So we just so interesting.

1542
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:39,960
I was, I was a concert level violinist
until I was until I was like 17 years old

1543
01:18:39,961 --> 01:18:41,130
practice. Yeah. I mean,

1544
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:44,250
then the only expensive object that I
own other than my house is his violin.

1545
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:48,900
Oh really? Yeah. Is it a
strata of area? It is not. It
is. It is a upbeat, it's not,

1546
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:51,000
that's all I know.
Yeah.

1547
01:18:51,001 --> 01:18:54,420
They're the two that people may know
or Stratton and like a worn area. Um,

1548
01:18:54,421 --> 01:18:56,490
but those, those ones are like
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1549
01:18:56,491 --> 01:18:57,990
This is in the tens of
thousands of dollars.

1550
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:01,890
A Stradivarius is hundreds of thousands
of, I had the guy who we knew,

1551
01:19:01,891 --> 01:19:04,350
my family knew hit $1 million
Stradivarius. Ooh. Yeah.

1552
01:19:04,351 --> 01:19:07,050
Now it was so big about it was
the big deal. Well, I mean,

1553
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,780
aside from the historic
value of the thing, they're
not making any more of them.

1554
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:13,220
Um, it does play very differently.
Very differently. Okay.

1555
01:19:13,221 --> 01:19:16,500
I had a crappy violin for most of my,
I like really until the last two years.

1556
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:19,620
I had a violin that was handed down
from my grandfather that was worth maybe

1557
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:23,580
1300 bucks. And it was a piece of
crap. I mean, it was not a good violin.

1558
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:24,683
If you're good enough,

1559
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:29,340
then you can tell the difference between
a really great violin to play and one

1560
01:19:29,341 --> 01:19:33,390
that is a piece of garbage. And I was
good enough to do that. So that's, yeah.

1561
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:38,400
I mean, I was a, I was a classical guy.
I played, I played violin for years in,

1562
01:19:38,401 --> 01:19:42,120
my dad was, uh, growing up, my dad was a
pianist. Look at what Jamie just pulled up

1563
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:44,660
the most expensive violin in the world.

1564
01:19:44,661 --> 01:19:48,950
Sold for an estimated $16 million

1565
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:53,100
alors Yup. For a Stradivarius and never
lose value. I mean, really they don't,

1566
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,770
and this is it. This is a
good investment. The person,

1567
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,070
I know this guy who has offered a,
he's offered a strategy,

1568
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:02,490
I think it was $250,000 maybe
10 years ago. And he's like, no,

1569
01:20:02,491 --> 01:20:04,530
that it's worth like $3 million.

1570
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,271
God,
no.

1571
01:20:05,271 --> 01:20:09,570
What is the deal like what if you had
to explain what's the difference between

1572
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:10,880
the sound that this makes?

1573
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,820
I mean, it has to do with the
acoustics of the instrument.

1574
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:15,190
Any of the wood quality.
There's,

1575
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:18,620
there's slight variations
in the construction of the
instrument is certain parts

1576
01:20:18,621 --> 01:20:21,830
of it are thicker or
thinner. Um, and it is also,

1577
01:20:21,831 --> 01:20:25,820
it's easier to play a better violin. So
it, it almost covers for your mistakes.

1578
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:29,120
When you play a bad violin,
it tends to scratch and screech more.

1579
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:31,880
That's why when you get in the
upper register with a violin,

1580
01:20:31,881 --> 01:20:32,720
you had very high notes.

1581
01:20:32,721 --> 01:20:35,600
It can either be very screechy or it
can be very beautiful. Some of that,

1582
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:37,250
a lot of,
most of that's the player.

1583
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:40,640
Some of that's the violin Yasha Heifetz
who is widely considered the greatest

1584
01:20:40,641 --> 01:20:43,070
violinists to, to ever
live. He had a Strad,

1585
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:49,210
a lady blunt,
Stradivarius cost 15 point $9 million,

1586
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:53,460
and then they lend them out on, on loan
to, you know, world's great violinist. So,

1587
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:57,240
but there's a button in the end. It really
is the, uh, the quality of the player.

1588
01:20:57,241 --> 01:21:01,080
There's a famous Yasha Heifetz story
where he was playing at Carnegie Hall and

1589
01:21:01,081 --> 01:21:04,500
some lady came up to him afterward and
she said, you know your violin. It's just,

1590
01:21:04,501 --> 01:21:05,520
it sounds so beautiful.

1591
01:21:05,521 --> 01:21:07,520
And he picks up the violin and puts
it to his ear and he says, Tony,

1592
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,393
I don't hear it right now.

1593
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,700
So do you listen to any other
kind of music? Yeah, I mean,

1594
01:21:15,230 --> 01:21:19,140
I like some classic rock. Yeah. I
mean, see, rocking out. Yeah. I,

1595
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:22,010
I went to a Doobie brothers concert
and my parents, no, you did. Yeah,

1596
01:21:22,011 --> 01:21:26,280
it was really, yeah. Yeah. That's, that's
a band that was main named after a joint.

1597
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:29,630
That is true. That's how ready is
accurate. I know. Did you feel like, oh,

1598
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,320
like a center.
I was a rebel that day.

1599
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:35,310
It doesn't really go into the Doobie
brothers concert with the other boomers.

1600
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:38,430
So the other thing is a same sex marriage.

1601
01:21:38,431 --> 01:21:41,140
So that's the other thing that I
think that we disagree with. Well, I,

1602
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:45,390
we agree with the marriage
thing. Governments,
government should be involved,

1603
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:50,460
I think where people should be
protected is through assets.

1604
01:21:50,461 --> 01:21:55,320
And you know, the contract. Yes. Yeah,
I think that that all makes sense to me.

1605
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:59,610
The all that stuff in terms of like a
alimony and child support and all those

1606
01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:03,870
things make sense to me and that, and the
idea that the community reinforces it,

1607
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:06,450
which would then become the government
reinforced and all that stuff.

1608
01:22:06,451 --> 01:22:09,340
That all makes sense to me.
I understand it. But um,

1609
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:12,690
why do you care if a two gay
guys want to get married?

1610
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:16,940
Um, so from a religious point of view,
sure. Let's go from religious soap.

1611
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:20,040
So you want me to do a secular
point of view first? So the,

1612
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:23,410
the idea is not that I care
deeply whether two gay guys,

1613
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,400
I want to get married to each other.

1614
01:22:24,401 --> 01:22:29,080
The idea is that it do I
prefer traditional marriage
to say to same sex marriage.

1615
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,280
Okay. Well let me, let me phrase it this
way. What do you think a gay guy is?

1616
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:36,060
Do you think someone's there making a
choice or do you think that this is how

1617
01:22:36,061 --> 01:22:36,730
they were before

1618
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:38,320
the religious point of view on this?
And,

1619
01:22:38,321 --> 01:22:40,970
and I think this is actually just the
general conservative point of view.

1620
01:22:40,971 --> 01:22:43,340
Like human action generally is,
I don't know,

1621
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,710
meaning that for the
vast majority of people,

1622
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:49,220
I would assume that they have a biological
drive to engage in that behavior.

1623
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:54,400
But the traditional sort of we'll point
of view is that biological drive does

1624
01:22:54,411 --> 01:22:58,400
not necessarily match up to the activity
you are to engage in. Right. Men,

1625
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:00,770
for example, have a biological
drive to impregnate many women.

1626
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,940
That's not something religion is
cool with either. All right, so the,

1627
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,240
the idea is that rubber

1628
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:10,630
Lou religion is cool with a man being
with one woman and impregnating her.

1629
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,300
But you're not cool with
a man being with a man.

1630
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:16,840
So I can give you the
religious explanation and I
can give you the second word

1631
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:17,690
explanation.
So they,

1632
01:23:17,691 --> 01:23:22,510
so the religious explanation is that there
is something different about a woman.

1633
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:26,530
Then there is about a man and a man is
made better through his union with a

1634
01:23:26,531 --> 01:23:31,531
woman and that if you pervert the sex
drive to pursue mere pleasure instead of a

1635
01:23:33,311 --> 01:23:36,580
lasting relationship upon which
the base of society is built,

1636
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,840
then you are foregoing the
proper use of your sex drive.

1637
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:43,420
And I just wanted to step
in and argue against that.

1638
01:23:43,421 --> 01:23:47,590
You would say that just because someone
can't get pregnant doesn't mean that

1639
01:23:47,591 --> 01:23:51,840
they don't have a loving relationship
that contributes to society. Well,

1640
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:52,421
that's true,

1641
01:23:52,421 --> 01:23:57,421
but it is also for going the
more productive relationship
of being able to bear

1642
01:23:57,461 --> 01:23:58,630
and their children and also,

1643
01:23:58,631 --> 01:24:00,760
and also recognizing that the
sections are not different. Right.

1644
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:04,410
Then recognizing also the sexes
are not the same. So it, you know,

1645
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:07,480
being with a man is in a relationship
different than being with a woman,

1646
01:24:07,481 --> 01:24:10,480
I would assume. I mean, I assume that's
why gay guys are gay. If it weren't,

1647
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:13,720
then I assume that they would be fine
with being with a woman. Right. So that's,

1648
01:24:13,721 --> 01:24:15,820
so that relationship from a,

1649
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,300
from a religious perspective is more
valuable because women have different

1650
01:24:19,301 --> 01:24:22,780
qualities than men. You round
off each other's harsh edges.
It changes you. I mean,

1651
01:24:22,781 --> 01:24:25,240
you're married being very
changes a man in a different way,

1652
01:24:25,241 --> 01:24:27,570
that being married to a member
of the same sex would write.

1653
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:31,600
But I don't want people to have to do it.
But if you're not forcing anybody,

1654
01:24:31,601 --> 01:24:32,140
right,

1655
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:37,140
but I want them to have the option
and if you're a gay person and we

1656
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,860
know, I mean of course because legally
we agree, right? Yeah. Illegal.

1657
01:24:41,861 --> 01:24:44,770
And I keep making this distinction
because whenever I talk about my moral

1658
01:24:44,771 --> 01:24:45,610
perspective on things,

1659
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:48,820
then people immediately assume that I'm
a theocratic fascist and I just want to

1660
01:24:48,821 --> 01:24:53,821
keep underscoring my personal views
on Dave Rubin's marriage are of no

1661
01:24:54,161 --> 01:24:57,370
consequence to public policy
in any way whatsoever.

1662
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:01,970
But I agree with you on that and I don't
think it should be a part of public

1663
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:05,500
public policy and I think people should
absolutely be allowed to marry and

1664
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:08,140
divorce and do whatever the fuck
they want to do no matter who it is.

1665
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:12,790
But why do you care?
Like as a person who's a rational thinker,

1666
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:17,350
it's pretty clear that people are gay
and I don't really think that this is a

1667
01:25:17,351 --> 01:25:19,600
decision they make in
term in terms of like,

1668
01:25:19,601 --> 01:25:23,200
I'm going to make a clear
choice to defy God and be gay.

1669
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:25,500
I think they're just gay. Well,
again, I think that's a confession.

1670
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:29,470
It's a conflation of identity.
And drive with activity,

1671
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,570
which is something that
religion fundamentally reject.

1672
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:35,980
Religion fundamentally rejects the idea
that you are driven to do something and

1673
01:25:35,981 --> 01:25:38,860
therefore it is your identity. Therefore,
he gets to participate in the behavior.

1674
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:41,770
That's it. That's a chain of
thinking that religion, any religion,

1675
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,350
if a man is gay in your religion,

1676
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:46,660
if a man is gay and they're
in love with another man,

1677
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:50,380
they should just squash those
thoughts and find a woman. Well,

1678
01:25:50,381 --> 01:25:53,660
ideally they would be honest with a woman
they marry and they're not like, well,

1679
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:56,890
they would want to. Ideally, ideally,

1680
01:25:56,891 --> 01:26:00,010
you would still get married and have
children in a heterosexual relationship.

1681
01:26:00,011 --> 01:26:00,791
If you're not up to that,

1682
01:26:00,791 --> 01:26:04,010
then you wouldn't get married at
all to when you describe this to a

1683
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:08,930
gay man, they will tell you, imagine
Ben Shapiro, someone said to you,

1684
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:14,200
you should stop being with your beautiful
wife and you need to now marry a man

1685
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:16,580
because this is what God wants you to do,

1686
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:21,530
so you're going to have to stop this man
and he's going to stop you because this

1687
01:26:21,531 --> 01:26:24,680
is how the rules are set
up so far. It sounds pretty
terrible shirts, right? Well,

1688
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:27,170
this is how it sounds to gay folks when
you're telling them they have to find a

1689
01:26:27,171 --> 01:26:27,840
one.

1690
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,600
Like I like, I'm not saying you
have to find a woman. I'm saying,

1691
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:34,320
I'm saying you can't do X. Right? I'm
not saying you must, but say can't.

1692
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:39,000
But by whose determination? If you decide
to participate in this religion, right?

1693
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:42,900
Then there is a buyin to
the precepts of the religion

1694
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:44,050
and the buy in is

1695
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,050
you can't be gay. Well, no,

1696
01:26:46,051 --> 01:26:48,840
the buy in is that you can have
whatever sexual orientation you pleased,

1697
01:26:48,841 --> 01:26:50,510
but there's certain activity
you can't participate in.

1698
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:53,780
So you can be gay,
but you can't have gay sex.

1699
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:56,250
Correct. That's the, and by the
way, that's what the Bible, I mean,

1700
01:26:56,251 --> 01:26:57,720
if we want to go direct
to the text of the Bible,

1701
01:26:57,721 --> 01:26:59,370
it's what the Bible actually
says, right? I mean,

1702
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:02,790
even the parts of the Bible that people
really hate those parts say that a man

1703
01:27:02,791 --> 01:27:05,430
shall not lie with a man. It doesn't say
a man can't be attracted to another man.

1704
01:27:05,431 --> 01:27:08,370
That's Old Testament, right? Yeah,
that's right. That's our stuff, right?

1705
01:27:08,371 --> 01:27:11,670
New the new testament that it gets a
little harsher and the new testament in

1706
01:27:11,671 --> 01:27:16,380
some places, Romans, correct? Yeah.
But in any case, you know, uh, again,

1707
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:17,551
when it comes to,

1708
01:27:17,551 --> 01:27:22,080
this is what I'm puzzled by is the idea
that this is a unique area of human

1709
01:27:22,081 --> 01:27:25,290
behavior that religion is
supposed to treat differently.

1710
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:29,430
Meaning religion treats virtually
every human activity like this,

1711
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:33,180
sin is a failure to abide by a
covenant, right? That's what,

1712
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:36,330
that's the definition of sin, right?
When when you commit a sin in Judaism,

1713
01:27:36,331 --> 01:27:39,450
in era in Judaism, what you are
doing is failing to do a Mitzvah,

1714
01:27:39,451 --> 01:27:41,910
which is a commandment. You're
violating a commandment. Well,

1715
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:45,420
there are lots of commandments that go
directly against what people are driven

1716
01:27:45,421 --> 01:27:47,400
to do.
Just because of the drive is stronger,

1717
01:27:47,401 --> 01:27:52,401
does not make it morally more morally
non culpable to violate that commandment.

1718
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,420
So when people pick this
one out and they say, well,

1719
01:27:57,421 --> 01:27:59,800
this one is particularly
intolerant for example, uh,

1720
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:03,360
I don't see why it's more particularly
intolerant than saying to a man that you

1721
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:08,250
have to marry one woman or saying to a
Jew that you are not allowed to eat this

1722
01:28:08,251 --> 01:28:09,760
stuff.
Or you know like it's,

1723
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,210
it may be harder that I don't
think there's any question.

1724
01:28:12,211 --> 01:28:13,860
It's harder to abide
by those commandments,

1725
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:16,320
but it is well within religious tradition,

1726
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,840
like literally every religious tradition
that there's a bunch of stuff you are

1727
01:28:18,841 --> 01:28:20,460
driven to do that you can't.
Now again,

1728
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:23,820
you don't have to agree with my program
that I'm not trying to convert you.

1729
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:25,410
It's one of the nice
things about my religion.

1730
01:28:25,411 --> 01:28:27,660
I don't give a crap whether
people are Jewish or not. Like we,

1731
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:29,220
we actively discouraged converts.

1732
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:34,550
But if you're going to proclaim that
you are abiding by traditional Judaism,

1733
01:28:35,370 --> 01:28:38,010
this is the buy in, right? There's lots
of buy and you have to wear a funny hat.

1734
01:28:38,011 --> 01:28:40,200
Sometimes you have to,
you have to go to shul on Saturdays.

1735
01:28:40,201 --> 01:28:41,460
You have to keep Shabbat.
Like there's,

1736
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,870
there's a lot of buy in and as long
as I'm not bothering anybody else, I,

1737
01:28:44,871 --> 01:28:48,510
I frankly don't see what business it
is legitimately anybody's what I think

1738
01:28:48,511 --> 01:28:51,120
about personal relationships.
I'm not imposing my view on anybody else.

1739
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:56,410
Well, um, I, I do acknowledge
that at all, all the religions,

1740
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:01,290
Judaism probably makes it the most
obvious. They don't give a fuck what do,

1741
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,120
go ahead. Do your thing. Like
they're not trying to ties,

1742
01:29:04,490 --> 01:29:07,560
you're doing your business. My uncle
converted and uh, when he get very,

1743
01:29:07,561 --> 01:29:09,720
it was a grind man.
He had to learn a lot of Shit

1744
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:14,070
my three years of a grind. A long
time. Yeah, for sure. It's a long time.

1745
01:29:14,071 --> 01:29:15,420
So that was the religious
perspective and the,

1746
01:29:15,421 --> 01:29:19,830
and the secular perspective when it comes
to valuing traditional marriage over

1747
01:29:19,831 --> 01:29:22,800
over a same sex marriage,
that's a very simple calculation,

1748
01:29:22,801 --> 01:29:26,660
which is one type of marriage produces
traditional children produce his children

1749
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:29,020
need traditional biological way and then
you have both parents in the house to

1750
01:29:29,021 --> 01:29:31,470
take care of the kid. Right?
That's the value of marriage.

1751
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:34,560
And I fully acknowledge that when
the value of marriage shifted from,

1752
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:36,300
it's about production and
rearing of children too.

1753
01:29:36,301 --> 01:29:37,500
It's two people who love each other.

1754
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:40,620
The case for same sex marriage against
same sex marriage went completely out the

1755
01:29:40,621 --> 01:29:40,980
window.

1756
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:41,730
Right,

1757
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:46,170
so you are just sticking to your rigid
ideology in terms of like what you

1758
01:29:46,171 --> 01:29:49,920
believe to be a sin and not believe
to be a sin based on your religion,

1759
01:29:49,921 --> 01:29:54,510
based on this very strict moral
fiber that this religion is

1760
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:58,400
in a religious context. It applies
to me, it applies to my family.

1761
01:29:58,401 --> 01:29:59,630
It doesn't apply to you.
Right.

1762
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:05,260
Room for growth in that when people have
a better understanding about biology

1763
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:09,050
like it, if it was proven,
if there's proven like, oh,

1764
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:13,820
this is why a person develops blue eyes.
This is why a person is gay.

1765
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:18,920
This is why there's nothing wrong with
it. It's just a very ocean. It's red hair,

1766
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:21,650
it's freckles, it's gay, it's straight.

1767
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:26,160
Tell me that that homosexual orientation
is 100% biologically driven and I will

1768
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:28,590
almost completely agree with that.

1769
01:30:28,591 --> 01:30:30,780
I think that there are some cases
where it's not, but those are rare.

1770
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:32,220
But it's particularly true by the way.

1771
01:30:32,221 --> 01:30:35,140
The research tends to show that there's
more sexual fluidity among females than

1772
01:30:35,141 --> 01:30:37,970
males. Males. It tends to be
either heterosexual or homosexual.

1773
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:42,800
Research is all done by dude's want their
wife to hook up with chip. Keep going,

1774
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:48,180
tell him to stop you, but hey, let me just
show you the paperwork. But it's wrong.

1775
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:50,190
But again,
that it's a,

1776
01:30:50,191 --> 01:30:53,790
it's a question that I've always found
actually not particularly interesting

1777
01:30:53,791 --> 01:30:58,230
simply because it doesn't take into
account the worldview generally,

1778
01:30:58,231 --> 01:31:03,030
which is that a biological drive does not
equal excuse for behaving in a certain

1779
01:31:03,031 --> 01:31:03,570
way.

1780
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:03,960
But this,

1781
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:07,920
that's where it brings me back to this
like is it possible that these laws in

1782
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:12,360
this religion were written when there,
what do, who do you think wrote the stuff?

1783
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,540
Do you think people wrote the
stuff or do you think God really,

1784
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:19,540
I think either way, even if it were it.
I mean, because I am a an orthodox Jew,

1785
01:31:19,541 --> 01:31:23,590
I believe that at the very least it's
God inspired and God written. Right?

1786
01:31:23,591 --> 01:31:26,440
But even if I believed out a second level
that human beings were at that stuff

1787
01:31:26,441 --> 01:31:30,400
too. I think that people 3000 years ago
had never seen a gay person before were

1788
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,860
saying tenanted.

1789
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:34,390
Like the very reason to have a commandment
is because certain people in your

1790
01:31:34,391 --> 01:31:36,820
community are behaving in a
particular way, presumably. Right?

1791
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,250
There's no commandment not to take your
head and shove it into meat grinder.

1792
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:39,541
Well,

1793
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:42,740
this is also the argument against pork
is because they didn't understand trick

1794
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:43,860
gnosis thinner stand.

1795
01:31:43,861 --> 01:31:47,160
You have to cook the meat to
145 degrees and pork parasites,

1796
01:31:47,161 --> 01:31:48,600
which are very dangerous for people.

1797
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:52,930
I'm not, I'm not a huge fan of
naturalistic explanations for religion.

1798
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:57,310
Do I think that's a good one though
for pork? I mean, I don't know.

1799
01:31:57,311 --> 01:31:59,910
Like I think you could
make an argument that

1800
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:03,670
died in India and there's
horrific x rays of his head.

1801
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:09,150
He had a parasites from pork that had
gotten into his body and they had a nested

1802
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:10,270
in his brain,

1803
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:13,810
started developing all these cysts
inside of his head and they couldn't do

1804
01:32:13,811 --> 01:32:18,040
anything about it because it was so deep
in his head that if they gave him the

1805
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:21,970
antivirus antiparasitic medication,

1806
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:24,880
it would cause swelling of the
brain and they will be like, it was,

1807
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:29,230
it was so far gone. Tell the
story. It's actually pig shit.

1808
01:32:29,231 --> 01:32:34,060
Apparently the people accidentally coming
in contact with pig shit produces this

1809
01:32:34,061 --> 01:32:37,940
particular type of parasite. Yeah,
it's kosher. It's more rare but,

1810
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:39,810
but trick Kenosis was pretty good

1811
01:32:40,010 --> 01:32:40,843
like a long time.

1812
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:45,880
There are attempts to sort of paint back
into the Bible certain rationalistic

1813
01:32:45,881 --> 01:32:50,200
explanations like those where
it makes sense though, I think.

1814
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:54,380
Why else would you, would it be bad?
Eat pigs, like Jesus loves pigs.

1815
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:55,150
Is that what's going on?

1816
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:59,080
Uh, well, I, I think that the reversal
of the kosher laws in the New Testament,

1817
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:00,001
you know,
from,

1818
01:33:00,001 --> 01:33:02,170
from a Jewish point of view where we
don't believe in the divinity of Christ.

1819
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,950
There you can make an argument that
the, the Gospels, which were written,

1820
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:08,380
he was just taking off it
and significant, no, no, no,

1821
01:33:08,381 --> 01:33:10,180
we don't even believe he's a prophet.
What do you think he was?

1822
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:12,940
What do you guys think? I mean, I, what I,
what do I think that he was historically,

1823
01:33:12,941 --> 01:33:15,130
I think he was a Jew who tried to lead
a revolt against the Romans and got

1824
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:15,880
killed for his trouble.

1825
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:18,280
Just like a lot of other Jews at that
time who were crucified for trying to lead

1826
01:33:18,281 --> 01:33:19,114
revolt against the Romans

1827
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,030
for their trouble.

1828
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:24,530
So he became legend and story and it
became a bigger and bigger deal as time

1829
01:33:24,531 --> 01:33:25,140
went on

1830
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:28,170
for followers.
And then that gradually grew.

1831
01:33:28,171 --> 01:33:31,770
And then do you think that says a
wreck? No, that's not, that's not a, uh,

1832
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:35,610
Jewish belief. Okay. I just want to check.
Yeah, no, or we're not into, you know,

1833
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:39,090
not the marquee stories. No, that's
not to have any miracles. No, not, not,

1834
01:33:39,091 --> 01:33:42,150
not by Jesus. And then there
was the old testament. Yeah.

1835
01:33:42,151 --> 01:33:43,620
You've gotten most of splitting
of the sea and all that.

1836
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:46,330
What do you think happened there?
What do I think happened there? Yeah.

1837
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,840
Well I'll go into my mind at ease
and explanation that there was a,

1838
01:33:48,841 --> 01:33:51,360
I mean it says in the Bible
there was a strong east wind. Ah.

1839
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:55,200
So there was a naturalistic
explanation for a physical phenomenon.

1840
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:56,890
That makes sense. I mean, that's,

1841
01:33:56,891 --> 01:33:59,910
so that's what my mind needs is constantly
trying to do is read nature back into

1842
01:33:59,911 --> 01:34:00,360
the Bible.

1843
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:04,940
Hmm. Yeah. That, that is the problem
with these texts, right? Is it,

1844
01:34:04,941 --> 01:34:08,120
you're trying to decipher
translations from original tax,

1845
01:34:08,121 --> 01:34:12,020
which are written in ancient
Hebrew thousands of years
ago and were told an oral

1846
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:13,640
tradition for longer than that.
Right,

1847
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:16,870
right. I mean this is, this is
where, you know my, my book,

1848
01:34:16,871 --> 01:34:19,550
which I always hesitate to pitch my own
stuff because it sounds Gauche pitch

1849
01:34:19,551 --> 01:34:21,130
away,
but the new book,

1850
01:34:21,131 --> 01:34:23,540
the right side of history and Number One
New York Times bestselling nonfiction

1851
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:23,780
book

1852
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:27,250
mate, you got number one and the
New York Times bestselling fee.

1853
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:27,891
Yeah,

1854
01:34:27,891 --> 01:34:30,560
we sold enough that we knocked Michelle
Obama out of the number one slot for a

1855
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,040
week. So that was nice. Is there a
protest? Uh, well, no protest yet,

1856
01:34:34,041 --> 01:34:36,740
but suffice it to say the New York
Times book review or didn't like it,

1857
01:34:36,741 --> 01:34:38,390
but I'm not super shocked by that.

1858
01:34:38,391 --> 01:34:43,391
But the basic contention that I make is
that Judeo Christian values on the one

1859
01:34:44,031 --> 01:34:48,980
hand and then human reason on the other
Greek reason really that that tradition

1860
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:52,040
is attention and that that tension
is where western civilization lives.

1861
01:34:52,041 --> 01:34:54,410
That basically civilization
is a suspension bridge.

1862
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:57,080
It takes certain fundamental
precepts of Judeo Christian values,

1863
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:00,320
the one hand and then takes Greek reason
and they're pulling against each other.

1864
01:35:00,321 --> 01:35:02,450
And sometimes reason feels like
it's going to dominate religion.

1865
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:05,420
And sometimes it feels like religion is
going to dominate reason and the best of

1866
01:35:05,421 --> 01:35:08,000
all available worlds.
You have a bridge that is,

1867
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:12,890
that is capable of building upon that
where you can actually have a functional

1868
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:17,570
civilization and if you lose
reason in the name of theocracy,

1869
01:35:17,571 --> 01:35:20,330
then you end up with tyrannical
theocracy and if you lose,

1870
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:22,400
if you lose religion
in the name of reason,

1871
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:25,340
you end up in some pretty dark places
because human beings don't have a very

1872
01:35:25,341 --> 01:35:29,180
good track record of creating their own
purpose, creating their own meaning,

1873
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:32,560
creating their own systems. We tend to
get very utopian very quickly. Right,

1874
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,240
and things get really ugly,
which is sort of the story of the,

1875
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:36,980
particularly the first
half of the 20th century.

1876
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:40,510
So this is the benefit of sticking to
the rigid ideology that's prescribed by

1877
01:35:40,511 --> 01:35:43,840
religion is that you don't allow the
human beings to keep updating it and

1878
01:35:43,841 --> 01:35:47,590
changing it. Because if you do, they
will eventually slide into chaos.

1879
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:51,380
The yes, but there's there, which is not
to say there's not playing in the joints.

1880
01:35:51,810 --> 01:35:52,570
There's certainly,

1881
01:35:52,570 --> 01:35:56,890
religion has morphed over time of
Judaism as it was practiced originally.

1882
01:35:56,891 --> 01:36:00,970
Probably in many ways, does not resemble
Judaism is practiced now. Right? In fact,

1883
01:36:00,971 --> 01:36:02,980
the Talmud even says this,
I mean there's,

1884
01:36:02,981 --> 01:36:06,110
there's this kind of fascinating and
counter intuitive section of the Talmud

1885
01:36:06,130 --> 01:36:10,170
where Moses is, it's, it's uh,
what is called the [inaudible],

1886
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:12,220
which some of these stories that
are just kind of put into the,

1887
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:16,270
into the middle of the Telmate where
Moses comes back and he's watching from on

1888
01:36:16,271 --> 01:36:21,190
high as a bunch of rabbis in, you
know, second century Palestine, uh,

1889
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:25,750
are, are talking about Judaism. And he's
like, I don't recognize any of this stuff.

1890
01:36:25,751 --> 01:36:28,540
Like I brought down these books from the
mountain and I do not recognize any of

1891
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:32,730
this stuff. And, and God
says to him, you know,

1892
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:37,030
God says to him, right? I mean, this is
how this has morphed and Moses is pleased.

1893
01:36:37,031 --> 01:36:38,170
In other words, he's, he's not,

1894
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:41,740
Judaism has always had a common law
tradition where you're using reason to try

1895
01:36:41,741 --> 01:36:46,150
and develop the ideas behind
the commandments and then
try and extend them or

1896
01:36:46,151 --> 01:36:47,980
broadened them.
And I think that's a good thing,

1897
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:53,250
but you have to be careful
not to completely undermine
fundamental routes or or

1898
01:36:53,591 --> 01:36:56,350
get rid of basic precepts.
In other words, you have to,

1899
01:36:56,351 --> 01:36:58,960
you have to acknowledge there are certain
fundamental truths that exist there

1900
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:02,290
and then there's play as far
as how those are implemented.

1901
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:04,240
Does Judaism have one of those?

1902
01:37:04,630 --> 01:37:06,250
Pray the gay away traditions?

1903
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:09,750
No, that's not it. That's not a thing. I
mean it's what do they want guys to do?

1904
01:37:09,751 --> 01:37:14,100
Like what say, what would you
do if not not to, not to sin,

1905
01:37:14,101 --> 01:37:17,280
but again soon as a soon as
a thing that everybody does.

1906
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:21,600
Meaning that masturbation is not,
is not okay. According to Judaism,

1907
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:24,510
I assume that a vast
majority of young Jewish men,

1908
01:37:24,511 --> 01:37:27,540
even the Orthodox are masturbating.
So people sit in. I mean that's,

1909
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:32,100
that's a recognition. It's, it's always,
again, I think I can speak on behalf of,

1910
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,950
I will audaciously speak on behalf
of both Jews and Christians here.

1911
01:37:35,130 --> 01:37:36,880
I think that religious people are,

1912
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:40,080
are told that when they say
that something is a sin,

1913
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:43,260
this means that they are looking askance
at the people who are committing the

1914
01:37:43,261 --> 01:37:46,050
sin. And that is not correct. I mean,

1915
01:37:46,051 --> 01:37:51,051
what Judaism and Christianity say is that
we are all committing sins on a fairly

1916
01:37:51,301 --> 01:37:54,900
regular basis. Where we get uptight
is when people start saying,

1917
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:58,770
because I have a desire for the sin,
the sin is no longer a sin. Hmm.

1918
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:05,780
Yeah. The real problem is like what?
Why is it a sin a who says it's a sin?

1919
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,310
So again,
who again,

1920
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:12,110
this these rules you were assuming
or influenced by God, right?

1921
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:13,730
But clearly written by people.

1922
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:14,661
Well,
the,

1923
01:38:14,661 --> 01:38:18,320
this one you would say if you're a
fundamentalist or at least somebody who

1924
01:38:18,321 --> 01:38:19,040
believes in the,

1925
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:23,000
the idea that the Torah was given by God
was giving literally by God. But again,

1926
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:26,140
that doesn't the, the logic
behind the rules, which you know,

1927
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:31,010
people like my monities
have tried to explicate. The
idea is, as I said a second,

1928
01:38:31,130 --> 01:38:33,290
this you can do without God, right?
This part you can without God,

1929
01:38:34,490 --> 01:38:39,490
the human sex drive was made to procreate
within a stable relationship in order

1930
01:38:40,191 --> 01:38:44,300
to pro generate and have
future generations of people
misuse of that sex drive

1931
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:44,961
in any way.

1932
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:49,460
Whether you're talking about from
masturbation to homosexual activity is

1933
01:38:49,461 --> 01:38:51,740
therefore a diminishment
of the use of that drive.

1934
01:38:51,770 --> 01:38:55,220
That's the natural law case against,
against homosexual activity. And again,

1935
01:38:55,850 --> 01:38:58,220
I will reiterate for media
matters for the 1000000th time,

1936
01:38:58,250 --> 01:39:01,220
I'm not in favor of any of this being
encoded into American law because freedom

1937
01:39:01,221 --> 01:39:01,551
is freedom.

1938
01:39:01,551 --> 01:39:03,830
People should be able to send how they
choose so long as they're not harming

1939
01:39:03,831 --> 01:39:04,530
anybody else.

1940
01:39:04,530 --> 01:39:05,041
Right?
No.

1941
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:09,630
But what about people that have had
vasectomies and what about women that also

1942
01:39:09,631 --> 01:39:12,050
Judaism is not cool with this?
Ectomies not cool with it,

1943
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:15,240
but neither is Catholicism from what I
understand. Right, right. Yeah. Well,

1944
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:16,690
I'm not a big fan of that one,
even

1945
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:22,980
though when I have more
experience with, but uh, so if,

1946
01:39:23,010 --> 01:39:27,210
what if a man is sterile and the woman's
sterile or they're allowed to have sex

1947
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:28,410
because they both know.

1948
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:32,440
So yes, because there are ancillary
benefits to married couples having sex,

1949
01:39:32,441 --> 01:39:33,890
like relationship building.
Right,

1950
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:38,350
but that's not a generalized case
against the favored view of sex. Right.

1951
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:42,100
It's sort of like arguing that intersex
people mean that there's no such thing

1952
01:39:42,101 --> 01:39:43,510
as two separate sexes.

1953
01:39:43,540 --> 01:39:46,390
There aren't two separate Texas and
also their intersex people who have a

1954
01:39:46,391 --> 01:39:48,760
condition. Right. And that
that's the same thing here.

1955
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:52,450
The case in favor of heterosexual sexual
activity does not change based on the

1956
01:39:52,451 --> 01:39:54,520
fact that some people can't
actually participate in that.

1957
01:39:55,230 --> 01:40:00,120
What would you do if a young gay guy came
to you for advice? If someone said, hey,

1958
01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:02,730
Ben, a, I'm an admirer of yours.

1959
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:07,080
I love the way you think and fall your
philosophies, but I've got a problem.

1960
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:11,490
I'm a young Jewish man and I'm
gay and I don't know what to do.

1961
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,900
What would you tell them to do?

1962
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:15,610
I mean,
I can't tell them to do anything.

1963
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:17,930
When would you advise,
would you tell?

1964
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:20,480
Would you tell him to not
act out on those feelings?

1965
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:23,040
I would say you do the best
you can as a human being.

1966
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:27,480
And from my moral perspective,
you tried to avoid sin as best you can,

1967
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,090
but everybody sins.

1968
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:34,510
The problem does that sin though it
seems to me that it was defined by people

1969
01:40:34,511 --> 01:40:37,630
that didn't understand biology because
they were dealing with humans that

1970
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:40,630
existed thousands of
years ago with no books.

1971
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:43,060
No understanding of why people were gay.

1972
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:44,070
No, I mean I again, I,

1973
01:40:44,071 --> 01:40:47,310
I really don't think that biblical
commandments are linked and religious

1974
01:40:47,311 --> 01:40:49,530
commandments generally are
linked to a view of biology.

1975
01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:52,650
Meaning that you don't think so?
No.

1976
01:40:52,651 --> 01:40:57,490
I think that sin is a recognition that
we have drives that we are supposed to

1977
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,690
forego. Okay. That's
pretty much, I mean that's,

1978
01:40:59,691 --> 01:41:03,340
that's fundamental to certainly
Judaism to Christianity as well.

1979
01:41:03,341 --> 01:41:05,730
I would say Islam even has,
has this basic preset, right?

1980
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:09,910
Right. When I think we can agree that
there's some real benefits to discipline,

1981
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:14,050
there's real benefits to having structure
and it doesn't mean that you can't be

1982
01:41:14,051 --> 01:41:14,531
creative.

1983
01:41:14,531 --> 01:41:18,490
It doesn't mean that you can't be free
and do whatever you want some of the time

1984
01:41:18,491 --> 01:41:21,490
too. But I think we can both
agree that this is one of the,

1985
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:26,310
one of the best benefits of an ideology
and what hopefully a positive ideology.

1986
01:41:26,311 --> 01:41:26,430
Yeah.

1987
01:41:26,430 --> 01:41:27,800
Right.
And one of the things that I,

1988
01:41:27,810 --> 01:41:32,460
the reason I keep coming
back to the governmental
regulation point is because my

1989
01:41:32,461 --> 01:41:36,690
view is that if your view of discipline
is not my view, discipline good on you.

1990
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:38,250
Right? Like go, go do what you want to do.

1991
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:41,040
Like I've never had a conversation
with Dave Ruben about,

1992
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:42,750
about him being a gay guy.
Right.

1993
01:41:42,751 --> 01:41:45,120
But you did say that you like wouldn't
go to his marriage. Right? Well,

1994
01:41:45,121 --> 01:41:46,740
I said right. As a, as a religious person,

1995
01:41:46,741 --> 01:41:50,370
I can't say I can't actively participate
in something that I consider to be a

1996
01:41:50,371 --> 01:41:52,730
sin, but I would go out to dinner
with Dave and his husband anytime,

1997
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:53,790
like my wife and I would do that.

1998
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:55,860
Of course we'd have him over
to our house with his husband.

1999
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:56,320
There's no,

2000
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,470
you don't find any contradiction between
your religious perspective and your

2001
01:41:59,471 --> 01:42:02,130
personal perspective in that
regard that you would do,

2002
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:05,620
you wouldn't be there
for religious reasons,

2003
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:09,910
but that you would be there for
personal reasons. Like if it wasn't,

2004
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:13,150
would you go to the after party? I'll
give, you wouldn't go to the wedding.

2005
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:13,890
Would you go to the APP?

2006
01:42:13,890 --> 01:42:17,010
Bart? Anything that was a
celebration of same sex marriage now.

2007
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:20,750
Wow. So anything but like
if we go to the party. No,

2008
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:24,950
I mean that's it and that's
it. I mean there's a barbecue
the next day, et cetera.

2009
01:42:26,150 --> 01:42:26,983
You know, it's, it's,

2010
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:32,180
and again, like I'm not sure
why I'm not a good party person,

2011
01:42:32,181 --> 01:42:33,510
so I'm not sure why anybody
would want me to write

2012
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:36,850
party. Frankly. Scary. But
haven't been to a party with you.

2013
01:42:36,851 --> 01:42:39,250
But I went to a dinner party with
you. That's true. We had a great time.

2014
01:42:39,251 --> 01:42:41,500
That was a good time. That was good
times. That's a funny picture, man.

2015
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:44,230
That is why I don't know what the
fuck to think about that picture.

2016
01:42:44,670 --> 01:42:47,970
And it's certainly true.
Eric and Jordan and

2017
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:54,240
you and I. It's like what
white supremacist in one place
right now. All the, yeah,

2018
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:59,230
that that is a disturbing one when they'll
just just lump you in with a bunch of

2019
01:42:59,231 --> 01:43:03,190
fucking psychopath just
because it's convenient for
them and it's an easy way to

2020
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:05,710
diminish you that that that is a,

2021
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:10,090
that is a thing that I see more from
the left then from the right and it's

2022
01:43:10,091 --> 01:43:14,710
really disturbing. I always thought until
this clickbait generation came along,

2023
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:17,890
I always thought that especially,
well,

2024
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:20,140
you know the New York Times is
obviously the higher standard,

2025
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:25,300
but that you would never see that
kind of shit from progressive people.

2026
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:30,450
You would never see willful distortion
of reality to define their narrative and

2027
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:37,160
it's a really disingenuous way and it
happens so often now that people get

2028
01:43:37,871 --> 01:43:42,700
called my favorite is alright adjacent.
I know what that means.

2029
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:45,610
It doesn't, they don't know what it means.
That's a new thing. It's a new thing.

2030
01:43:45,611 --> 01:43:47,680
People try it out to try to not,
it might go away.

2031
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:52,870
It's, it's again trying to lump everybody
into group for purposes of castigating.

2032
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:53,950
Their motives is really about this.

2033
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:56,300
You don't have to have an argument with
somebody if you assume they're naughty.

2034
01:43:56,390 --> 01:43:58,850
So I guess you could call everybody a
Nazi. You don't have to have an argument.

2035
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:01,840
It is goofy.
But you know,

2036
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:05,390
I think when it comes to the,
the gay marriage thing,

2037
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:10,420
what people really worry about is other
people trying to stop people from doing

2038
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:14,270
what they want to do. You don't
have that in you. That's not you.

2039
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:19,190
What you are doing is opposing it
from your, your religious beliefs.

2040
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:19,701
Right?

2041
01:44:19,701 --> 01:44:24,701
Like if you want to join into my shoal
that she'll has religious beliefs and

2042
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:28,610
that's their business by the way, there
like I can't join a church. I assume.

2043
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:30,620
I don't believe the things that
people in the church believe

2044
01:44:30,940 --> 01:44:34,480
you probably could just donate.
You got to give the right amount of money.

2045
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:36,790
Well, I don't believe in the Jesus.
So there's that. There's that,

2046
01:44:38,530 --> 01:44:39,520
that's not my thing. Right. I mean,

2047
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:43,570
so I wouldn't expect to walk into a
mosque and expect them to change their,

2048
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:44,710
their standards on religion.

2049
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:49,660
I find it really audacious when people
actually expect other people to view the

2050
01:44:49,661 --> 01:44:53,020
world the same way that they do and then
expect that they're going to be catered

2051
01:44:53,021 --> 01:44:55,870
to in that way.
Like I wouldn't walk into a,

2052
01:44:56,450 --> 01:45:01,390
I wouldn't walk into a gay owned bakery
and expect them to bake a cake that has

2053
01:45:01,391 --> 01:45:03,260
versus from Leviticus on it.
Like why would I do or

2054
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:08,470
weird story, you know, I'm the big cake
store cause it gets bandied about. They,

2055
01:45:08,590 --> 01:45:11,610
those folks went to several
Baker's until someone said

2056
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:14,890
no, this is correct. They were
looking for a court case and yeah,

2057
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:18,390
honestly like that's not you being a civil
rights here that you being a jackass,

2058
01:45:18,570 --> 01:45:20,910
seriously. Like go to the other
bakery. What do these people do to you?

2059
01:45:20,911 --> 01:45:23,310
They didn't have anything to do with you.
They don't owe you their cake.

2060
01:45:23,311 --> 01:45:24,890
And if you want to boycott,
then boycott them. Right?

2061
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:27,660
You want to get all your friends to say
we're not going to go buy a cake from

2062
01:45:27,661 --> 01:45:31,980
these discriminatory humans. Fine. It's
a free market have at it. But this,

2063
01:45:31,981 --> 01:45:34,650
this notion that somebody
owes you their services,

2064
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,290
that's that to me it's not even
a freedom of religion case.

2065
01:45:37,291 --> 01:45:39,000
To me that one's a freedom
of association case.

2066
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:39,441
Well,

2067
01:45:39,441 --> 01:45:44,441
I think what the goal is is to shame a
business into submission and also to,

2068
01:45:46,450 --> 01:45:50,660
to put it out there in the public eye so
that people understand that this is the

2069
01:45:50,661 --> 01:45:52,910
discrimination that does
happen with gay folks. Will,

2070
01:45:52,911 --> 01:45:56,300
they will go somewhere and someone
won't bake a cake for him, you know?

2071
01:45:56,301 --> 01:45:57,860
And so I think they
wanted to highlight it.

2072
01:45:57,861 --> 01:46:01,790
So if I was being very charitable and w
I didn't think there'd be an attention

2073
01:46:01,791 --> 01:46:04,130
whore us, I would say maybe
that's what they're doing.

2074
01:46:04,131 --> 01:46:06,290
Maybe they're just trying to
highlight this very real problem.

2075
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:08,540
That's fine. But they actually
like took it to the government.

2076
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:11,600
Once he starts pointing government gun
to people, I get real uptight. So again,

2077
01:46:11,601 --> 01:46:15,830
if that's a weird one, if you were, if you
were just to walk into, right, exactly.

2078
01:46:15,831 --> 01:46:19,260
Yeah. Right. Talk about how much you
don't like them. Fine. You know, like I,

2079
01:46:19,261 --> 01:46:21,860
I may disagree with you or I may agree
with you, whatever. That's, that's fine.

2080
01:46:21,861 --> 01:46:26,420
But once you start going to the government
and having the government levy like

2081
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:28,730
hundred thousand dollar fines
on family bakeries because they,

2082
01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:33,680
because you couldn't find a gay
baker in Colorado supposedly like,

2083
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:37,790
um, no, I'm sorry. That's, that's
not cool. And I feel the same way.

2084
01:46:38,630 --> 01:46:40,790
If I walked into a bakery
and they're like, you're
Jewish, we're not serving you.

2085
01:46:40,791 --> 01:46:44,840
I'd be like, okay, you're,
you're in a hole. But all right.

2086
01:46:44,841 --> 01:46:47,180
I mean it's free country and
there's a bakery across the street.

2087
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:49,560
Or maybe I'll just open a bakery next
door to you and take your business.

2088
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,540
Well,
it's

2089
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:55,230
unfortunate that anyone
would ever think like that,

2090
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:59,910
but should it be a law to force someone
to think differently? You can't,

2091
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:00,580
it doesn't work.

2092
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:02,410
Work. This isn't it. This is my point.

2093
01:47:02,411 --> 01:47:05,260
Is it just a slippery to my
religious beliefs and be like, oh,

2094
01:47:05,261 --> 01:47:08,290
you're a theocrat and I keep
coming back to I'm not though.

2095
01:47:08,291 --> 01:47:10,750
Like I don't want to force
my beliefs on anybody.

2096
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:12,940
Just have those books are my beliefs.

2097
01:47:12,941 --> 01:47:15,430
So leave me alone and those are
your beliefs, so leave you alone.

2098
01:47:15,431 --> 01:47:17,770
And if we can't have a system where
we acknowledge that those beliefs can

2099
01:47:17,771 --> 01:47:20,800
coexist and we can still
have conversations with
each other or be friends,

2100
01:47:21,070 --> 01:47:22,510
it's gonna be real hard to have a society.

2101
01:47:22,690 --> 01:47:25,030
When you told Dave Rubin that
you wouldn't go to his wedding,

2102
01:47:25,150 --> 01:47:28,960
did he get butthurt? No Pun
intended. No, he wasn't upset
about it now. No. Cause it,

2103
01:47:28,961 --> 01:47:30,610
cause Dave and I were friends.

2104
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:35,680
He knows that I have no anger or upset
about him doing. I would want every month,

2105
01:47:35,681 --> 01:47:38,160
Fuck Ben. Come on man. I Dunno.

2106
01:47:38,170 --> 01:47:41,530
I'm not a friends person so I don't
have any friends. I mean I have friends,

2107
01:47:41,531 --> 01:47:45,010
but it's like very close
friends and then acquaintances.

2108
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:48,180
I tend to keep a pretty close
social circle. That's smart.

2109
01:47:48,850 --> 01:47:52,420
They have so much time in this life
that that's pretty much how I feel.

2110
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:56,020
Like if you're the kind of person where
it feels like a true obligation for me

2111
01:47:56,021 --> 01:47:59,630
to drive you to the airport. Oh, not a
thing, man. I'm not driving. Correct.

2112
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:03,370
Correct. There are people who make
money off of you driving to the airport.

2113
01:48:03,371 --> 01:48:07,090
As it turns into that this is,
this is exactly correct that those people,

2114
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:09,490
but that does,
that kind of went away for the most part.

2115
01:48:09,491 --> 01:48:12,040
So if you find someone who still
ask him for a ride to the airport,

2116
01:48:12,041 --> 01:48:13,990
that's a greedy
motherfucker at this point.

2117
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:18,840
You know,
it wasn't your 30 bucks on the Uber,

2118
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:22,420
like your wife or your girlfriend and she
wants to talk to you when you drop her

2119
01:48:22,421 --> 01:48:25,060
off at the airport. That's totally
cool. Right? Well this is a standard,

2120
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:26,291
but that's what I mean by that.

2121
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:29,320
I circle of friendship like somebody
where I'm in the car with them for half an

2122
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:32,050
hour and it doesn't feel like an
obligation or a nice conversation,

2123
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:34,330
then that's fine.
But um,

2124
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:39,150
I value community and I,
I value our value.

2125
01:48:39,151 --> 01:48:42,490
People talking and trying to
understand each other. And I,

2126
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:47,340
I've seen so much conflict that's
unnecessary because I see so much conflict

2127
01:48:47,341 --> 01:48:52,050
that's rooted in people not communicating.
And instead of communicating,

2128
01:48:52,051 --> 01:48:55,680
and I think this is one of the things
that I'm most nervous about with all this

2129
01:48:56,250 --> 01:49:00,570
deep platforming and censoring people
and the silencing of people on the right.

2130
01:49:00,571 --> 01:49:02,520
And it's not that I
agree with these people,

2131
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:06,840
it's that I see how this is just going
to shore up these two sides and it's

2132
01:49:06,841 --> 01:49:09,120
going to make it a much more difficult,

2133
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:12,960
much more difficult
atmosphere for communication,

2134
01:49:12,961 --> 01:49:17,961
for real understanding and coming to
agreements on things and and recognizing

2135
01:49:18,001 --> 01:49:22,140
the things that we all, all good
people seem to agree. You could try,

2136
01:49:22,141 --> 01:49:24,330
you should try to help each other.
She'd be kind to each other.

2137
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:27,930
You should work hard, you should have good
morals and ethics. You shouldn't steal,

2138
01:49:28,050 --> 01:49:29,880
you shouldn't take from,
people shouldn't lie,

2139
01:49:30,030 --> 01:49:32,580
you shouldn't try to cheat the government.
You shouldn't try to cheat people.

2140
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,270
Just be a good fucking person.
And that this,

2141
01:49:35,271 --> 01:49:38,490
this transcends religious ideologies.

2142
01:49:38,491 --> 01:49:41,550
It transcends political leanings.
It really does. And it should.

2143
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,960
And we can have a truly diverse community,
truly diverse,

2144
01:49:45,961 --> 01:49:47,980
not forced diversity,
diverse

2145
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:51,040
meaning some people are progressive,
some people are conservative,

2146
01:49:51,041 --> 01:49:53,620
some people who are libertarian.
You can joke with each other.

2147
01:49:53,710 --> 01:49:56,380
We can all get along together
and disagree with things.

2148
01:49:56,500 --> 01:50:00,620
Just not be fucking hateful towards
each other. This is possible, but it,

2149
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:05,540
it becomes less possible when people feel
like they're being silenced or sensors.

2150
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:07,450
Totally right.
And it's also true that when you,

2151
01:50:07,870 --> 01:50:10,060
when you castigate somebody
is morally on equal,

2152
01:50:10,061 --> 01:50:12,490
what you're really doing is you're giving
you an excuse to get into their shit.

2153
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:15,160
I mean, it was like this is
what's really happening here.

2154
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:18,040
Like if I had a slogan beyond the facts,
don't care about your feelings stuff.

2155
01:50:18,330 --> 01:50:21,940
He'll just leave me alone. Yeah.
Right. Don't get into my shit.

2156
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,160
Like I'm not bothering you,
so why are you bothering me?

2157
01:50:24,161 --> 01:50:27,160
And if I have a belief system
that's different than yours,
then so the hell, what?

2158
01:50:27,161 --> 01:50:29,500
As long as I'm not bothering you,
what difference does it make to you?

2159
01:50:29,650 --> 01:50:31,370
How I feel about things?
The only thing about the

2160
01:50:31,430 --> 01:50:35,990
gay thing is that it's not you. You have
a belief about things that's not you.

2161
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:37,950
But I have lots of beliefs about
things that are not me, right?

2162
01:50:37,951 --> 01:50:41,730
But there are people that aren't hurting
each other. But it's so what, I mean,

2163
01:50:41,731 --> 01:50:43,350
I can believe that people who
aren't hurting each other,

2164
01:50:43,351 --> 01:50:47,340
like I'm not a fan of prostitution.
So like,

2165
01:50:47,490 --> 01:50:50,430
so I am not a fan of people.
Here's some, somebody got hurt.

2166
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:54,630
Prostitution's clearly more of a choice
than I think gay people are. Okay.

2167
01:50:54,631 --> 01:50:57,350
But I'm, I'm right. But I
know you're coming back,

2168
01:50:57,351 --> 01:51:00,660
coming back to the same moral distinction
which I've ever repeated a few times,

2169
01:51:00,661 --> 01:51:05,580
which is that I'm not a believer that a
natural desire to do something therefore

2170
01:51:05,581 --> 01:51:10,080
makes an activity. Okay. But that's, but
that's a view that has no extra Alli's,

2171
01:51:10,081 --> 01:51:12,270
my view has no externality.
So in the same way, listen,

2172
01:51:12,271 --> 01:51:15,630
I believe about people who eat too much
and get obese because they eat too much.

2173
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:17,970
I think it's a bad thing to do.
I do think it's my business.

2174
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:21,300
You want to do it your problem. Like you
want to, you want to eff up your life.

2175
01:51:21,330 --> 01:51:24,180
That's what freedom is called, right?
Isn't it one of the seven deadly sins.

2176
01:51:24,210 --> 01:51:28,250
Gluttony. Yeah. That again, a
question thing, but yeah, but,

2177
01:51:28,590 --> 01:51:30,420
but yes, I mean, and I have,

2178
01:51:30,421 --> 01:51:33,480
I've lots of beliefs about lots of
things that people do. And by the way,

2179
01:51:33,481 --> 01:51:36,210
so to you, things that don't affect
you, right? I, and this is, we all do,

2180
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:40,320
but as long as I'm not forcing that on
you because there are no externalities,

2181
01:51:40,321 --> 01:51:43,350
true behavior, I don't see why it
bothers you. Like they're legitimately,

2182
01:51:44,310 --> 01:51:46,950
I would assume tens of millions of people
in this country who believe that when

2183
01:51:46,951 --> 01:51:49,680
I die I will go to hell. Right. And I
don't know. I don't believe in Jesus.

2184
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:52,230
And so there are a lot of people
believe I don't believe in Jesus,

2185
01:51:52,231 --> 01:51:55,380
therefore I am bound for hell.
That does not bother me. One,

2186
01:51:55,381 --> 01:51:59,220
I Yoda cause no one's bothering
me. So what do I care? Right?

2187
01:51:59,221 --> 01:52:01,260
Like I don't understand why
everyone doesn't take this view.

2188
01:52:01,530 --> 01:52:04,450
If I'm not legitimately bothering you,
why should,

2189
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,000
why should you care what
I think like this is,

2190
01:52:06,180 --> 01:52:08,460
this is what would be puzzling me if
somebody came to me and they wanted my

2191
01:52:08,461 --> 01:52:12,210
opinion on something because they valued
my opinion that much. I give my opinion,

2192
01:52:12,660 --> 01:52:14,670
but it's a f you don't have
to care about my opinion

2193
01:52:14,940 --> 01:52:18,470
sync when it comes to the gay thing
where people are looking for is to people

2194
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:23,530
for other folks to be accepting of who
they are and I think for a lot of these

2195
01:52:23,961 --> 01:52:26,900
gay folks had been in the closet their
whole life. That's the big things.

2196
01:52:26,901 --> 01:52:31,580
They're always worried about someone
treating them differently or someone

2197
01:52:31,581 --> 01:52:33,110
diminishing them because they're gay.

2198
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:37,250
Then when they hear someone like you say
that you think it's a sin and that you

2199
01:52:37,251 --> 01:52:39,200
shouldn't act on your biology,

2200
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:42,770
even though you have these urges
that you should instead find a woman,

2201
01:52:43,070 --> 01:52:46,210
they feel the same pangs.
Rejection

2202
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,350
that I for sure get that,
but the,

2203
01:52:48,351 --> 01:52:52,700
the confluence between activity
and identity is actually
kind of a dangerous one

2204
01:52:52,701 --> 01:52:55,340
meeting. Then the, you know, the,

2205
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:58,940
the idea that if I disapprove of
an activity in which you engage,

2206
01:52:58,941 --> 01:53:00,560
that I disapprove of you.
Right.

2207
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:04,550
I disapprove of lots of activities
in which lots of people engage,

2208
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:06,200
including most members of my family,

2209
01:53:06,201 --> 01:53:08,810
including my children and a
lot of the time that's not me.

2210
01:53:08,811 --> 01:53:12,290
I just approve of them as a human being
or that I'm di I'm saying they are

2211
01:53:12,291 --> 01:53:16,430
lesser as a human being that like we
all interact with people this way.

2212
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:18,080
Like you disapprove of my view on this.

2213
01:53:18,410 --> 01:53:21,290
I don't get the feeling you
disapprove of me as a human being. No,

2214
01:53:21,291 --> 01:53:24,380
I don't practice a religion. You obviously
think of my religion is bullshit,

2215
01:53:24,381 --> 01:53:27,320
but that's okay. I don't care. Like
why was, I don't think it's bullshit.

2216
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:28,940
I wouldn't say,
I think it's bullshit.

2217
01:53:29,310 --> 01:53:32,120
You can still like God spoke to somebody
in the mountains. Bullshit. Right?

2218
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:34,520
Well I don't even know if that's bullshit.

2219
01:53:34,580 --> 01:53:39,580
What I do know is that it's a historical
interpretation of stories that were as

2220
01:53:40,371 --> 01:53:45,371
much as they could or as little as they
want it to be accurately defined and

2221
01:53:46,791 --> 01:53:50,810
written down and then passed on from
generation to generation. For example.

2222
01:53:50,811 --> 01:53:53,020
You think the fact that I won't eat
pork is kinda stupid bullshit. No,

2223
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:56,090
I don't think it's stupid bullshit. First
of all, I think pigs are intelligent.

2224
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:57,410
I wish they weren't wild.

2225
01:53:57,560 --> 01:54:01,840
I have a deep affinity to pigs and
really good example here. I love them.

2226
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:06,140
But I also kill them and eat
them. I mean, I kill wild pigs.

2227
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:08,000
Let me be broader about this.
You're not an orthodox Jews,

2228
01:54:08,001 --> 01:54:11,560
so I assume there are things
about the things that I do, but I,

2229
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:14,420
there are certain things of which
I believe or practice that you,

2230
01:54:14,421 --> 01:54:18,470
that you probably disapprove or you
don't think they're the smartest or you

2231
01:54:18,471 --> 01:54:20,960
think that there might
not think is the smartest.

2232
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:25,010
But as I've gotten older
and hopefully wiser,

2233
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:29,540
I give a fuck less about
why you do what you do,

2234
01:54:29,541 --> 01:54:34,541
but whether or not the benefits seem to
be worth the juice is worth the squeeze.

2235
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:37,940
Right. And in your case, I think
the juice is worth the squeeze.

2236
01:54:37,941 --> 01:54:40,940
I think you're a very successful person.
You're very reasonable.

2237
01:54:40,941 --> 01:54:43,190
You're very intelligent.
You're an outstanding debater.

2238
01:54:43,191 --> 01:54:46,880
And I enjoy talking to him,
listening to on Youtube. Um,

2239
01:54:46,881 --> 01:54:50,420
I think part of that is because of
the fact that your religion, right?

2240
01:54:50,530 --> 01:54:52,760
Of your religious,
I think it's cross training.

2241
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:56,990
I think in a lot of ways it's like
if you lift weights for Jujitsu,

2242
01:54:56,991 --> 01:54:57,791
it makes you stronger.

2243
01:54:57,791 --> 01:54:59,960
Don't make your Jujitsu better
as long as you keep training.

2244
01:55:00,170 --> 01:55:04,010
I think your discipline
from your religion has,

2245
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:08,600
there's psychological benefits to it.
Right? Or is that totally benefits to it?

2246
01:55:09,650 --> 01:55:10,910
I totally get all that.
That gets to the point.

2247
01:55:10,911 --> 01:55:12,140
The point is that we're different people.

2248
01:55:12,141 --> 01:55:14,960
So there are certain activity in which
I engage that you probably think,

2249
01:55:14,961 --> 01:55:17,710
well that's, I wouldn't do that to
kind of dumb and that's okay. I don't,

2250
01:55:17,711 --> 01:55:21,410
I wouldn't though. I would,
but I wouldn't, I wouldn't,
I don't want to do it.

2251
01:55:21,411 --> 01:55:24,230
I don't want to wear a Yamaka. Right. I
get it. I understand why you would do it.

2252
01:55:24,231 --> 01:55:25,790
Hard to keep it on your head.
Just glue it.

2253
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:29,410
What would it called zoots do they
put up double stick tape there?

2254
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:31,850
You can not allow it to now.
You can. You totally can.

2255
01:55:31,851 --> 01:55:36,140
But it seems to be painful
and uncomfortable. Yeah.
Um, definitely says that.

2256
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:39,200
And living in a society, we
all are constantly disapproving
of each other. Right?

2257
01:55:39,201 --> 01:55:41,360
Politics is just us disapproving
of each other all the time.

2258
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:44,070
And so long as we're not forcing
that on anybody else. I really

2259
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,710
don't see the problem. And I think
everybody should sort of get over it.

2260
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:50,700
Like if I don't approve of your
personal behavior, welcome to the club.

2261
01:55:50,701 --> 01:55:53,860
I disapprove of 99% of people's personal
behavior, including my own habits.

2262
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:54,690
Do you,
how,

2263
01:55:54,690 --> 01:55:58,170
how often do you debate people on the
merits of religion or the merits of your

2264
01:55:58,171 --> 01:55:58,820
beliefs?

2265
01:55:58,820 --> 01:56:03,640
Um, you know, not, not super frequently,
but not infrequently. I mean,

2266
01:56:03,650 --> 01:56:04,810
like I,
I mentioned that I've,

2267
01:56:04,811 --> 01:56:07,470
I've had this conversation with Sam a
couple of different times in public.

2268
01:56:07,730 --> 01:56:10,310
Well, he's, he's so rabid as an atheist.

2269
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:13,680
He's my religion. Sam is more
religious than I am. Sam.

2270
01:56:13,690 --> 01:56:15,280
Sam is more of a religious
atheist than I am.

2271
01:56:15,281 --> 01:56:18,310
Like I'll admit questions about
my own religion. Sam is very,

2272
01:56:18,311 --> 01:56:21,370
very convinced of his,
of his correctness and in his viewpoint,

2273
01:56:21,670 --> 01:56:25,300
Sam Sam's a religious dude.
He's a fascinating guy. I
liked him a lot. And again,

2274
01:56:25,590 --> 01:56:26,880
and Michael Shermer,
uh,

2275
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:31,240
I've had on my show to talk about
religion and skepticism and all that.

2276
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:35,230
I'm not shy about talking about it.
I just, sometimes I find that it's,

2277
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:38,770
it's kind of a dead end because sometimes
it just turns into I believe in God

2278
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:41,440
and then the person's like,
I don't believe in God. And
it's like, well, okay, fine.

2279
01:56:41,441 --> 01:56:44,050
Now. Now can we talk about
the stuff we think are the,

2280
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:48,430
what are the fundamental building blocks
upon which you can basis society or

2281
01:56:48,431 --> 01:56:51,760
basic politics? And if we agree on
those, then you know, the God stuff,

2282
01:56:51,761 --> 01:56:55,750
I think God is a better base for
those fundamental policies and, and,

2283
01:56:55,810 --> 01:56:59,800
and belief systems. I think free
speech, individualism, democracy,

2284
01:56:59,801 --> 01:57:03,640
these are based on a simple
verse in Genesis that human
beings are made in God's

2285
01:57:03,641 --> 01:57:06,560
image. I think that that's a logical
leap. This is the case I've made to it,

2286
01:57:06,570 --> 01:57:06,970
to see him.

2287
01:57:06,970 --> 01:57:10,270
I don't think that you can actually
get to human beings are of inestimable

2288
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:12,910
inestimable value from
scientific materialism.

2289
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:15,610
If you believe that human beings
are effectively just animals,

2290
01:57:15,611 --> 01:57:17,320
then I don't know why they
would be of infinite value,

2291
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:20,800
nor why I should respect somebody's
belief system simply because they're human

2292
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:25,540
and I don't respect animals. And if
we're just another animal, I, there's no,

2293
01:57:25,570 --> 01:57:27,940
there's nothing that necessitates
that logical line of the, in fact,

2294
01:57:27,941 --> 01:57:30,970
for most of human history, it was not
the logical line of thinking it was,

2295
01:57:30,971 --> 01:57:33,110
if you're a member of my tribe,
then we like you,

2296
01:57:33,111 --> 01:57:34,870
and if you're not a member of my tribe,
then we'd get to kill you.

2297
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:40,020
A logical comparison like is isn't
there a difference between single celled

2298
01:57:40,021 --> 01:57:43,380
organisms and the way a primate
interacts with its environment?

2299
01:57:43,590 --> 01:57:44,490
I mean,
yes,

2300
01:57:44,491 --> 01:57:47,820
but I'm not sure why that would indicate
any sort of greater existential value.

2301
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:50,610
It's not necessarily a
greater existential value,

2302
01:57:50,611 --> 01:57:55,470
but as we were talking about the value
of community and the value of having a

2303
01:57:55,471 --> 01:57:57,540
group of people that you
care about that this is,

2304
01:57:57,570 --> 01:58:01,080
this is a core component of being human.
This is a,

2305
01:58:01,230 --> 01:58:05,610
it's a core component of this
understanding mind, rational,

2306
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:06,720
intelligent,

2307
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:09,720
interfacing with the universe in a
way that no other animals capable.

2308
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:13,770
I'm not saying you can't get to
the point where Sam agrees with me.

2309
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:17,100
I'm saying that I think it's less
convincing than Sam thinks it is. Meaning,

2310
01:58:17,430 --> 01:58:20,460
there's an alternative line of
thought that says, okay, you're right,

2311
01:58:20,461 --> 01:58:21,480
social fabric is great,
you know,

2312
01:58:21,481 --> 01:58:23,790
or that social fabric is particularly
awesome among me and my friends.

2313
01:58:23,890 --> 01:58:25,650
I know where it ain't that great.
Those guys over there,

2314
01:58:25,651 --> 01:58:27,810
let's go kill him and take their shit.
I'm really like that.

2315
01:58:27,811 --> 01:58:31,220
That was pretty much how humanity
works for very, very long time. Uh,

2316
01:58:31,390 --> 01:58:35,760
and the simple and effective idea that
the reason that human beings are of value

2317
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:39,180
is because we are more than
just our material bodies.

2318
01:58:39,181 --> 01:58:42,220
That there's something that is
us that is of inestimable value.

2319
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:45,310
That's a religious concept and
it has a lot of weight. Now,

2320
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:48,490
if Sam wants to get to the same place
and we can build a political conversation

2321
01:58:48,491 --> 01:58:49,324
from there,
that's fine.

2322
01:58:49,510 --> 01:58:54,220
My real argument was Sam is Sam and I go
down to the bottom of the iceberg about

2323
01:58:54,221 --> 01:58:56,860
90% of the way we have the same
fundamental values about free speech,

2324
01:58:57,130 --> 01:59:02,020
diversity of opinion about I think two,
two mostly an extent free markets.

2325
01:59:02,290 --> 01:59:05,140
Uh, you know, I think that we agree on
a lot of these fundamental principles.

2326
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:08,500
He then says that he gets
those from pure reason.

2327
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:12,850
I have serious questions about
whether pure reason necessitates those

2328
01:59:12,851 --> 01:59:13,391
conclusions.

2329
01:59:13,391 --> 01:59:17,260
He tends to think that those are the only
conclusions a reasonable person could

2330
01:59:17,261 --> 01:59:19,600
come to if you properly apply a reason.
I don't think that's right.

2331
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,300
What do you think is happening there?
What's the mechanism?

2332
01:59:22,301 --> 01:59:24,880
I think that the mechanism
is that we are common.

2333
01:59:24,970 --> 01:59:29,200
What I said to Sam when we were debating
this in San Francisco is it's real

2334
01:59:29,201 --> 01:59:30,220
weird.
He's a materialist,

2335
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:34,180
scientific materialist atheist who
is sitting across the stage. For me,

2336
01:59:34,181 --> 01:59:37,270
a religious Jew, we agree on
95% of our values. So how,

2337
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:41,110
and his answer was, well, you
know, here's where I've studied.

2338
01:59:41,111 --> 01:59:42,010
I've studied Buddhism,

2339
01:59:42,011 --> 01:59:44,440
I've studied these philosophies and
I've studied science and all this.

2340
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:46,180
Is that right?
I haven't studied a lot of those things,

2341
01:59:46,181 --> 01:59:46,991
but we have the same value.

2342
01:59:46,991 --> 01:59:50,920
So why it seems to me a better historical
explanation is that we have grown,

2343
01:59:50,921 --> 01:59:55,810
we grew up 10 miles from each other in
Los Angeles after 3000 years of common

2344
01:59:55,811 --> 01:59:59,170
history of Judeo Christian development,
balanced with reason in the west.

2345
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:01,450
Like location has
something to do with this.

2346
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:06,640
And that location was rooted in
commonality of interest in philosophy.

2347
02:00:06,910 --> 02:00:11,030
So I, I'm less, it's, it's,

2348
02:00:11,230 --> 02:00:14,320
there's a weird nexus and I don't want
to get to kind of deep in the weeds here.

2349
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:17,030
There's a weird kind of
nexus on what truth is. Uh,

2350
02:00:17,070 --> 02:00:20,800
the where you've heard Sam and Jordan
Peterson debate us. It was insane. It was,

2351
02:00:20,801 --> 02:00:24,620
it's wild, right? Um, and the truth is,
I'm closer to Sam than Jordan on this,

2352
02:00:24,621 --> 02:00:27,100
so I'm closer to Jordan than Sam when
it comes to the value of religion.

2353
02:00:27,101 --> 02:00:29,920
And I'm closer to Sam than Jordan.
When it comes to objective truth,

2354
02:00:29,921 --> 02:00:31,870
Sam believes that there is such
a thing as objective truth.

2355
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:34,000
Jordan tends to be more of a pragmatist.

2356
02:00:34,001 --> 02:00:37,360
He tends to believe that truth is sort of
what is useful to a certain extent. Um,

2357
02:00:37,390 --> 02:00:39,490
and my,
I grew with Sam,

2358
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:44,170
but I'm not sure how he gets to objective
truth from a scientific materialist

2359
02:00:44,171 --> 02:00:45,004
worldview.

2360
02:00:45,310 --> 02:00:49,510
Why is their objective truth as opposed
to what you think is what you think

2361
02:00:49,511 --> 02:00:51,970
being evolutionarily beneficial.
How do you get from that too?

2362
02:00:51,971 --> 02:00:55,330
It's a universal principle that is
objective Lee. True. It's, it's,

2363
02:00:55,331 --> 02:00:57,670
it's a bit of a jump. Well it depends
on what the concept is, right?

2364
02:00:57,670 --> 02:00:59,770
Like what are you talking about
in terms of, I'm talking about,

2365
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:02,650
I'm talking about anything
that Sam says is true.

2366
02:01:03,190 --> 02:01:06,760
What makes it true as opposed to just
evolutionarily beneficial for us to think.

2367
02:01:06,761 --> 02:01:10,660
So meaning what evolution does is it
creates a series of thoughts in our mind.

2368
02:01:10,661 --> 02:01:15,661
Presumably if you're a materialist that
are beneficial to your preservation and

2369
02:01:16,121 --> 02:01:19,420
promulgation of the species, right?
They're not active actually true.

2370
02:01:19,421 --> 02:01:20,201
So if it's beneficial,

2371
02:01:20,201 --> 02:01:23,740
this is the Sam's real explanation for
the prevalence of religion. For example,

2372
02:01:23,741 --> 02:01:25,540
he'll say religion is true,

2373
02:01:25,541 --> 02:01:28,120
but evolutionary biology sort of
drives people toward religions.

2374
02:01:28,121 --> 02:01:31,030
So you can have group bonds that
are beyond 150 people or whatever.

2375
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:34,120
So why doesn't that apply to math?
Why is it the two and two?

2376
02:01:34,150 --> 02:01:35,020
How do you know that too?

2377
02:01:35,021 --> 02:01:39,160
And to actually equals four as opposed
to it is evolutionary been evolutionarily

2378
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:41,780
beneficial for you to believe
that two plus two equals four.

2379
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:44,330
So Sam believes there is an
objective truth somewhere out there.

2380
02:01:44,331 --> 02:01:47,690
The two plus two equals four I don't
know what evolution has to do with that

2381
02:01:47,691 --> 02:01:52,260
sort of stuff. So what do you think
is happening that he disagrees with?

2382
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:57,280
So I think that what is happening is that
human beings were placed in an orderly

2383
02:01:57,951 --> 02:02:02,030
universe through the processes of
biology and have a unique capacity to

2384
02:02:02,031 --> 02:02:04,310
understand that universe because
we are made in the image of God.

2385
02:02:04,610 --> 02:02:08,960
This is where I think that the religious
viewpoint diversity is pretty strongly

2386
02:02:08,961 --> 02:02:12,200
from from Sam's usually
leave in evolution. Yes.

2387
02:02:12,350 --> 02:02:17,060
Believe that evolution was a process that
was created by God to formulate human

2388
02:02:17,061 --> 02:02:17,370
beings.

2389
02:02:17,370 --> 02:02:21,390
Yes. Interesting. Yeah. I
mean that's, that's the nice
thing about being religious.

2390
02:02:21,391 --> 02:02:25,630
You can attribute most, most
everything to goddess. It's fine.

2391
02:02:26,070 --> 02:02:29,940
Here's the thing,
it's not that implausible.

2392
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:33,850
If there was some sort of a grand plan,

2393
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:37,330
there would be no regard for like all,
but got to get a rush on this.

2394
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:41,650
Making the evolutionary being,
you know, we're going to,

2395
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:43,570
you know, but it was all
salaried. The process.

2396
02:02:43,571 --> 02:02:47,510
It's a fine tuning arguments about how
implausible it would be for just Adam's

2397
02:02:47,511 --> 02:02:51,460
roaming around the universe randomly to
end with with human creation. You know,

2398
02:02:51,690 --> 02:02:55,340
the, the alternative
explanations seemed no, no more,

2399
02:02:55,730 --> 02:02:57,500
no less implausible to me,

2400
02:02:57,530 --> 02:03:00,830
like the multiple
universes theory plausible,

2401
02:03:00,831 --> 02:03:03,620
but we have no way to prove it because
we can't get to those multiple universes.

2402
02:03:03,621 --> 02:03:08,240
So how that testable or the or the now
popular theory that we're living in an AI

2403
02:03:08,241 --> 02:03:10,670
simulation, not sure how
that's more testable than God.

2404
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:13,340
Not sure how it's more testable
that aliens put us here.

2405
02:03:13,341 --> 02:03:14,360
Like how has any of this test,

2406
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:18,710
why is that more testable
or more plausible than the
idea that there is a force

2407
02:03:18,711 --> 02:03:22,820
behind that which we see that has mine.

2408
02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:27,380
Well, let's, let's just
break this down slowly.

2409
02:03:29,010 --> 02:03:31,470
There is obviously
something that's happening.

2410
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:36,740
There's obviously something that went
from the Big Bang to planet earth in 2019

2411
02:03:37,411 --> 02:03:42,090
with cellular communication and
satellite dishes and obviously something

2412
02:03:42,091 --> 02:03:46,710
happened, something pretty
radical. Why is it happening?

2413
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:52,040
Is it happening because of random events
that sort of coincide with biology and

2414
02:03:53,831 --> 02:03:57,930
the technology and all these things
come to fruition to you and I standing

2415
02:03:57,931 --> 02:04:00,960
across from each other talking on this
podcast in front of millions of people

2416
02:04:02,050 --> 02:04:03,290
w or it

2417
02:04:03,370 --> 02:04:04,203
is this,

2418
02:04:04,210 --> 02:04:09,210
is this just how things go is things
compete constantly try to get better and

2419
02:04:10,511 --> 02:04:14,050
then in this gigantic ecosystem of all
these things competing and trying to get

2420
02:04:14,051 --> 02:04:14,291
better,

2421
02:04:14,291 --> 02:04:19,291
one super successful organism us rises
above and continues and continues and by

2422
02:04:20,441 --> 02:04:24,820
far passes all these other
creatures below it and moves.

2423
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:28,440
We in our estimation,
I mean if you,

2424
02:04:28,450 --> 02:04:31,100
if you really believe in evolution
you can't think we're done right.

2425
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:34,670
It's got to be moving towards some better
product and it keeps going until it

2426
02:04:34,671 --> 02:04:38,160
creates so [inaudible] Sam
is more religious than I am.

2427
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:40,410
I think that there's a
plausible argument for atheism.

2428
02:04:40,411 --> 02:04:44,130
I just don't think that
there is a plausible argument
for Sam's moral vision of

2429
02:04:44,131 --> 02:04:48,870
atheism. Meaning that what, what,
what Sam tends to do, is it like,

2430
02:04:48,871 --> 02:04:49,530
for example,

2431
02:04:49,530 --> 02:04:53,760
you and I have talked a lot on this
particular podcast about the value of self

2432
02:04:53,761 --> 02:04:57,240
betterment and making decisions and
being responsible for those decisions.

2433
02:04:58,530 --> 02:05:00,510
How does that work in an area
where you don't have free? Well,

2434
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:04,090
so Sam actively says we do not have free,
well, yeah, that's a weird conversation.

2435
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:06,480
It is. It is a weird conversation
and sort of a self defeating one.

2436
02:05:06,660 --> 02:05:10,800
Sam suggests when it comes
to the scientific method
that we are using science to

2437
02:05:11,130 --> 02:05:14,080
find out truths about the universe
and we're using reasons him.

2438
02:05:14,090 --> 02:05:16,080
He's very big on reason.
I also am big on reason,

2439
02:05:16,081 --> 02:05:20,270
but I don't know how Sam is defining
reason as opposed to just Aiden,

2440
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:22,500
evolutionarily beneficial
firing of neurons.

2441
02:05:22,950 --> 02:05:25,410
Meaning that that's what we are at.

2442
02:05:25,411 --> 02:05:27,660
We're balls Balsamiq wandering
purposeless through the universe.

2443
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:32,040
And then he'll talk about making our
own meaning or seeking human human

2444
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:35,490
prosperity or a flourishing
is the word he likes to use.

2445
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:38,110
These are all very active
verbs, right? This is this,

2446
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:40,890
is it an active vision of
man in the universe? Right.

2447
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:42,660
And I'm not sure how that flows from,

2448
02:05:43,050 --> 02:05:45,670
we're a ball of meat that
evolve from another ball of
meat that evolve to wrench.

2449
02:05:45,690 --> 02:05:50,190
Really, if you go back far enough
from non balls of meat without any,

2450
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:54,940
without any free will, without
any capacity to choose. I don't,

2451
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:56,370
I don't know how you build
a civilization on that.

2452
02:05:56,930 --> 02:05:58,430
Well,
there's two different conversations here.

2453
02:05:58,431 --> 02:06:01,010
One is determination
or determinism rather,

2454
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:05,330
whether or not you have freewill or
whether or not your life and your actions

2455
02:06:05,331 --> 02:06:09,320
are being dictated by the past, by your
biology, by your learned experiences,

2456
02:06:09,321 --> 02:06:11,120
by external pressures.

2457
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:16,720
What is causing this very clear
decision that you make is this freewill?

2458
02:06:17,350 --> 02:06:19,190
Oh, you decided I'm going
to get my shit together,

2459
02:06:19,340 --> 02:06:24,340
or all the factors around you pushing
you and funneling you into this,

2460
02:06:24,860 --> 02:06:27,890
this direction that you, it's
unavoidable to you. Right?

2461
02:06:28,010 --> 02:06:30,260
And that you are not
a product of freewill.

2462
02:06:30,261 --> 02:06:34,340
You're just a product of a lot of
different factors, right? Or is it both?

2463
02:06:35,060 --> 02:06:39,980
Is it that you are the product of your
environment and your life experiences

2464
02:06:40,190 --> 02:06:42,020
end?
You also have free will,

2465
02:06:42,070 --> 02:06:43,810
right? And I'm, I'm in the latter. Yeah.

2466
02:06:44,150 --> 02:06:45,860
I'm in the latter group.
I think as well.

2467
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:51,020
I think we also experienced great benefit
from making positive choices and then

2468
02:06:51,050 --> 02:06:53,960
experiencing like whenever you meet
someone who's lost a lot of weight,

2469
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:57,950
one of the things they have is his fucking
tremendous feeling of accomplishment.

2470
02:06:57,980 --> 02:07:02,690
Yup. Yeah, I lost a hundred pounds. You're
like, holy shit man, a hundred pounds.

2471
02:07:02,691 --> 02:07:05,450
Right? Like they get this positive
feedback from it. There's,

2472
02:07:05,451 --> 02:07:08,690
there's real good and making good choices.

2473
02:07:09,110 --> 02:07:12,860
And when people decide to get their
shit together and make a good choice,

2474
02:07:12,861 --> 02:07:14,180
there were awarded.
The question is,

2475
02:07:14,450 --> 02:07:17,930
are you doing that because of determinism
or are you doing that because of

2476
02:07:17,990 --> 02:07:21,770
freewill? Or are you doing that because
of a combination of both of those things?

2477
02:07:21,771 --> 02:07:26,771
And can you fuel that freewill purposely
through like outwardly seeking things

2478
02:07:28,551 --> 02:07:30,860
that are motivational or
things that are educational,

2479
02:07:30,861 --> 02:07:34,400
things that allow you to kind of roadmap
the way you process reality, right?

2480
02:07:34,460 --> 02:07:39,460
Which can be beneficial and can aid in
you taking steps towards exercising your

2481
02:07:39,980 --> 02:07:40,813
freewill.
Right.

2482
02:07:40,890 --> 02:07:45,030
Well this, and this is why I
think that in the end it, right,

2483
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:47,220
but I think it's pretty
fundamental question.

2484
02:07:47,221 --> 02:07:52,221
And I think that that's why in the end
I'm religious and I'm not sure why Sam

2485
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:56,430
isn't because he agrees with the
same premises, right. He'll, he'll,

2486
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:59,460
he'll talk about self betterment and
decisions that you can make and then he'll

2487
02:07:59,461 --> 02:08:01,230
write a full book about why
free will doesn't exist.

2488
02:08:01,231 --> 02:08:03,240
And I just don't understand how
those two things can coexist.

2489
02:08:03,390 --> 02:08:08,250
Yes. It's a, well, I think it's a
thought experiment, first of all,

2490
02:08:08,251 --> 02:08:11,640
I think the whole determinism thing is
a thought experiment because there's

2491
02:08:11,641 --> 02:08:14,060
really no way to determine,
right.

2492
02:08:14,830 --> 02:08:17,640
You have the argument though,
for sure. Right. I mean,
like there's just no way to,

2493
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:18,630
to act to otherwise.
Yeah.

2494
02:08:19,140 --> 02:08:23,940
Um, but I, I guess I've absolutely
act as if I have free will.

2495
02:08:23,970 --> 02:08:26,820
Right. And we all do. And I get angry
at myself when I fucked things up.

2496
02:08:26,821 --> 02:08:30,050
I don't say, well, it's just
determined as a man. Right, right. No,

2497
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:32,310
that doesn't get you in the,
and the button may be,

2498
02:08:32,311 --> 02:08:35,340
it's determinism that has put me in this
position where I'm the kind of guy that

2499
02:08:35,341 --> 02:08:39,990
gets upset if I fuck things
up. Right. No, I don't know,

2500
02:08:39,991 --> 02:08:42,830
man. I don't know, but I don't
know if you know either. That's my,

2501
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:45,860
my take on all these things. When people
get really rigid with their ideologies.

2502
02:08:45,870 --> 02:08:49,710
Yeah. I'm like, okay, I want to hear
it out. I want to hear the whole thing.

2503
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:52,660
You know, I want to hear it all. I'm
not sure if you know, I think there's a,

2504
02:08:52,710 --> 02:08:55,170
I think there's no,
I think there's a lot that I don't know,

2505
02:08:55,230 --> 02:09:00,130
but I think that there's more plausible
and less plausible. Yeah, I agree. Um,

2506
02:09:00,210 --> 02:09:04,470
this is where I think people
misunderstand you. You have your beliefs,

2507
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:07,530
but you're not a car that
imposes them on people.

2508
02:09:07,770 --> 02:09:12,770
And I think we need to be way more
reasonable in terms of the way we address

2509
02:09:15,271 --> 02:09:19,350
people's beliefs. And, uh, I've
been guilty of this in the past.

2510
02:09:19,410 --> 02:09:21,870
I'm sure many people,
everyone else, everyone has.

2511
02:09:22,170 --> 02:09:26,520
But I think it's a core component to a
healthy community is to allow people to

2512
02:09:26,521 --> 02:09:29,160
have their own beliefs. And
you know, who knows, man,

2513
02:09:29,161 --> 02:09:33,270
maybe your beliefs on gay people will
adjust and move over time as you get older

2514
02:09:33,271 --> 02:09:37,740
and move into a gay neighborhood. And
I don't know. It looks good. It's not,

2515
02:09:37,741 --> 02:09:38,850
it's not about tolerance.
Fire.

2516
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:44,090
Yeah. I mean I don't,
yeah, yeah. It's, it, it's,

2517
02:09:44,630 --> 02:09:47,270
it's a difference between
understanding people are as,

2518
02:09:47,271 --> 02:09:50,210
as whole people and then saying that I
don't like some of the things that they

2519
02:09:50,211 --> 02:09:53,570
do and simply saying the
making the assumption that
because I don't like some of

2520
02:09:53,571 --> 02:09:54,150
the things that you do,

2521
02:09:54,150 --> 02:09:56,990
we can't be friends or I disapprove
of you as an entire human being,

2522
02:09:56,991 --> 02:09:57,860
which I think is not true.
True.

2523
02:09:58,460 --> 02:10:01,940
It's a good belief system to have.
If you're straight and then you go look,

2524
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,910
got it locked down. Don't need to
worry about that. I got a prop.

2525
02:10:04,911 --> 02:10:08,220
But if you were gay god down, there'll
be a pain. Absolutely. I mean,

2526
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:11,060
it would be annoying if you just always
wanted to bang dudes and everyone's

2527
02:10:11,061 --> 02:10:15,500
saying no and you're like, no, no, no.

2528
02:10:15,501 --> 02:10:19,300
Nobody said religions. Easy, man. What's
the value in it though? If you're a,

2529
02:10:19,580 --> 02:10:21,260
if you're a giant homo,
all right,

2530
02:10:21,261 --> 02:10:24,290
and all you want to do is go to
gay discos and party your ass off.

2531
02:10:24,291 --> 02:10:27,950
That's what you enjoy. Some people
like golf. Okay. Some people,

2532
02:10:28,340 --> 02:10:32,890
some people like parasailing, some dudes
just want to fucking get it on, man.

2533
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:34,070
Want to dress

2534
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:36,830
up like the village people
and go have a fucking party.

2535
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:40,310
That's why Santa Monica Blvd,
such a hotspot and they find each other.

2536
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:44,950
Do whatever you want to do. Honestly, do
whatever you want to do. Men Don't do it.

2537
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,100
Ask me to think that you know,

2538
02:10:46,580 --> 02:10:50,450
don't ask me to like put my stamp of
moral approval. I understand that.

2539
02:10:50,451 --> 02:10:52,160
Do what you want to do. Like
it's a free country. This,

2540
02:10:52,230 --> 02:10:54,530
this should be a free country,
not just, it is a free country.

2541
02:10:54,531 --> 02:10:55,341
It should be a free country.

2542
02:10:55,341 --> 02:10:59,770
It should not be my job to police
your personal behavior. Right? Right.

2543
02:10:59,771 --> 02:11:02,870
Like you as, I mean I have to approve
it on a personal level, right,

2544
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:06,490
but I'm a jerk if I want to
impose my belief system on,

2545
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:08,300
on your personal behavior
that affects no one else.

2546
02:11:08,301 --> 02:11:09,380
I mean that's the definition of being an,

2547
02:11:09,381 --> 02:11:13,400
and I'm a hypocrite if I continue
to berate you about your,

2548
02:11:14,050 --> 02:11:17,710
your opinion on gay folks. What do I
give a fuck what your opinion is correct.

2549
02:11:17,770 --> 02:11:21,700
Because you are a reasonable person
and you do, you're very polite and eve,

2550
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:23,530
you're in friends with Dave Ruben.
So there you go.

2551
02:11:24,130 --> 02:11:27,870
This guy has got to be
something there. It's, um,

2552
02:11:27,940 --> 02:11:30,350
it's a strange thing though, this, uh,

2553
02:11:30,370 --> 02:11:34,540
this need that people have for everyone
to think the way they think and I

2554
02:11:34,541 --> 02:11:39,541
understand the need to
reinforce your own thoughts and,

2555
02:11:40,040 --> 02:11:41,020
and,
and,

2556
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:46,160
and argue them and try to figure out a
way to debate that the other person's

2557
02:11:48,521 --> 02:11:50,620
perspective is incorrect and
your perspective is correct.

2558
02:11:50,621 --> 02:11:54,250
I understand all these inclinations
that people have, but uh, I,

2559
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:59,620
I think that they conflate that
with bigotry. Right. You know,

2560
02:11:59,650 --> 02:12:01,810
and I don't think,
I don't think you're a bigot.

2561
02:12:02,440 --> 02:12:04,560
I don't agree with you about gay folks,
but that's one of the,

2562
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:08,170
the marijuana thing is just,
I just don't think you have any experience

2563
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:10,520
center. Right. And as far as
the, as far as disagreeing,

2564
02:12:10,550 --> 02:12:13,820
I think that we probably
don't disagree on gay folks.

2565
02:12:13,821 --> 02:12:17,750
I think we disagree on identity and gay
activity and all the rest of it. I mean,

2566
02:12:17,751 --> 02:12:18,710
as human beings,

2567
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:25,010
these are human beings that I know many
gay people who I think are significantly

2568
02:12:25,011 --> 02:12:26,330
better human beings than religious people.

2569
02:12:27,090 --> 02:12:31,510
Yeah, yeah. I'm glad you
said that. Yeah, I think

2570
02:12:34,050 --> 02:12:37,780
it did it in a way.

2571
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:39,370
I don't have a defined religion,

2572
02:12:40,180 --> 02:12:45,180
but in a way I have some pretty rigid
ideas that I have in my head about

2573
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:50,050
behavior and ethics and morals and
how you treat PB care about those are,

2574
02:12:50,051 --> 02:12:51,910
those are like,
they're pretty rigid.

2575
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:57,240
And I think one of the
things that religion does is
it allows you to have this

2576
02:12:57,971 --> 02:13:00,690
sort of ethical framework sort of like,
um,

2577
02:13:01,930 --> 02:13:04,060
what is it called scaffolding?
Like when you're building it,

2578
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:09,360
like it allows you to develop
a more disciplined life
and it just shows you this

2579
02:13:11,591 --> 02:13:14,580
is good and this is bad and it's
clear and there's this most,

2580
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:17,980
for the most part it's good
for the most part. These are,

2581
02:13:18,010 --> 02:13:19,750
these are good patterns to follow.

2582
02:13:20,110 --> 02:13:25,110
And I think that I've most certainly sort
of adopted my own somewhere along the

2583
02:13:26,301 --> 02:13:26,690
way.

2584
02:13:26,690 --> 02:13:28,190
I think we all do. Yeah. I mean, honestly,

2585
02:13:28,191 --> 02:13:31,530
a value system effectively is
usually a form of religion. Right?

2586
02:13:31,531 --> 02:13:32,190
So when you're saying

2587
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:36,570
that Sam has religious, he's a religious
ACA atheists, you're not. Yeah.

2588
02:13:36,571 --> 02:13:40,080
You're not being inaccurate.
There's a lot of folks do that.

2589
02:13:40,081 --> 02:13:43,590
We do develop these sort of
principles that we follow.

2590
02:13:43,591 --> 02:13:46,710
We're not just free willy nilly just
doing whatever we want all day long.

2591
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:47,963
No one does that.

2592
02:13:48,310 --> 02:13:50,060
And the reason I say it
is sort of facetiously,

2593
02:13:50,061 --> 02:13:52,820
but I think that we all make fundamental
assumptions about the nature of human

2594
02:13:52,821 --> 02:13:55,960
life and we have to recognize that
those are assumptions. You can't, it's,

2595
02:13:55,961 --> 02:13:58,310
it's not reason all the way down.
Yeah.

2596
02:13:58,420 --> 02:14:02,240
That because that tends to actually
become even more inflexible than it's,

2597
02:14:02,241 --> 02:14:03,740
I'm the only reasonable
person in the room.

2598
02:14:03,741 --> 02:14:05,450
My reasons are the only ones that matter.

2599
02:14:05,820 --> 02:14:08,720
And so it's my reasons all the way down
the acknowledge that we're all making

2600
02:14:08,721 --> 02:14:10,880
some assumptions and then we can
discuss whether those assumptions are

2601
02:14:10,881 --> 02:14:11,714
worthwhile or not.

2602
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:16,200
Yeah. The thing that when it comes with
religion in defining whether or not other

2603
02:14:16,201 --> 02:14:19,950
people's behaviors sinful,
but where it doesn't involve you,

2604
02:14:20,190 --> 02:14:25,190
that's where a lot of folks start thinking
that maybe these ideas are bigoted.

2605
02:14:25,290 --> 02:14:26,520
Right.
But it does involve me,

2606
02:14:26,870 --> 02:14:28,280
meaning that the diamond, well, I'm,

2607
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:31,820
I'm enjoying every sin that I say
is a sin is a sin that enjoins me.

2608
02:14:31,850 --> 02:14:34,220
It's just that I may not have a
desire for that particular sin

2609
02:14:35,410 --> 02:14:36,101
in meaning I'm not,

2610
02:14:36,101 --> 02:14:38,290
I'm not holding people to a different
standard than I hold myself,

2611
02:14:38,620 --> 02:14:40,840
nor am I saying that I never sin.
Right.

2612
02:14:40,841 --> 02:14:44,140
But you know that you have different
biological desires and they do.

2613
02:14:44,141 --> 02:14:47,140
You can kind of acknowledge
that. All right. Of course,
that's true. Yeah, of course.

2614
02:14:47,141 --> 02:14:48,370
That's true.
By the same token,

2615
02:14:48,371 --> 02:14:50,710
I assume that a gay guy doesn't have
the desire to set up a thousand women,

2616
02:14:50,830 --> 02:14:55,600
which most straight guys do. Yeah. Why
do you think if, if God has a plan,

2617
02:14:55,630 --> 02:14:59,650
why do you think you would create gay
people? I mean, I think that God creates,

2618
02:14:59,860 --> 02:15:04,290
first of all, I don't think that I'm
in a position to evaluate God's plan.

2619
02:15:04,330 --> 02:15:07,070
I wish I work. But if you like
gods, if I, if I had to guess,

2620
02:15:07,110 --> 02:15:10,750
God creates people with all sorts of
different challenges and those challenges

2621
02:15:10,751 --> 02:15:13,540
span the spectrum.
I mean I,

2622
02:15:13,541 --> 02:15:17,830
I'm not so God sneaks it up on you. Hey
Man, I know this is gonna be fucked up,

2623
02:15:17,980 --> 02:15:21,910
but you're going to just like,
Dude's like forget about women.

2624
02:15:21,940 --> 02:15:26,500
You're gonna like dudes. I am not. I want
you to ignore that one of my old book.

2625
02:15:26,530 --> 02:15:29,620
I don't know why God gives people drives.
I don't know. I got gives kids cancer.

2626
02:15:29,621 --> 02:15:32,590
I don't know a lot of things about God.
Wish I did.

2627
02:15:32,620 --> 02:15:33,730
It would make my life a lot easier.

2628
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:39,000
So you think that that is a challenge
akin to any other challenge that a human

2629
02:15:39,251 --> 02:15:42,290
being might face in this life that the
challenge have been a lot harder. Yeah,

2630
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:45,160
but a lot more difficult and a lot more
straining and lot. Yeah, of course.

2631
02:15:45,290 --> 02:15:49,480
You think there's value in following that
challenge and not acting on gay urges.

2632
02:15:49,540 --> 02:15:52,330
I think the, I think there can be,
and you're having sex with a woman,

2633
02:15:52,360 --> 02:15:53,081
plug your nose,

2634
02:15:53,081 --> 02:15:56,140
go through and make a face cause
you discussed or did you create it?

2635
02:15:56,140 --> 02:15:57,530
Did you create a baby out of that?
Did that bit,

2636
02:15:57,540 --> 02:16:00,820
is that baby like a part of your life
now that does it that is deep and

2637
02:16:00,821 --> 02:16:03,730
meaningful. Mm. Maybe. What about
there are a lot of in and pass it.

2638
02:16:03,731 --> 02:16:04,840
There are a lot of gay guys having kids.

2639
02:16:05,050 --> 02:16:08,580
What about people saying
living their truth? I'm living
in my truth. Ben Shapiro.

2640
02:16:08,620 --> 02:16:12,700
Well I mean as a general rule, living my
truth as a bunch of crap. Like there's,

2641
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,170
there's living your opinion,
which is fine,

2642
02:16:14,171 --> 02:16:15,730
like live your opinion and how you want.
Again,

2643
02:16:15,731 --> 02:16:18,370
that gets back to do what you want.
As long as it's not bothering me.

2644
02:16:18,730 --> 02:16:20,680
Living my truth is a different thing.
That's one of them.

2645
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:24,220
Social media creations
like living my truth.

2646
02:16:24,990 --> 02:16:28,070
That's just bullshit. I'm sorry.
[inaudible] my truth is bullshit. It's,

2647
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:29,530
there's no such thing.
Your truth.

2648
02:16:29,560 --> 02:16:31,780
There's that truth and then there
is your opinion and we do have to,

2649
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:33,850
for purposes of conversation,
at the very least,

2650
02:16:34,270 --> 02:16:37,060
it's deeply irritating when people say
living my truth, because then it's like,

2651
02:16:37,240 --> 02:16:40,450
I disagree with you, and then
they're like, well, you're,
you're disavowing music.

2652
02:16:40,450 --> 02:16:44,440
Human being. No, I just disagree. Like
you can be you, you can do what you want.

2653
02:16:44,470 --> 02:16:49,130
Like you do whatever,
man. Calm, calm. Yeah.

2654
02:16:49,131 --> 02:16:53,500
Like I'm I, how did I become the
most loosey Goosey Libertarian,

2655
02:16:53,530 --> 02:16:57,250
lean back guy in the world, in
the society. How is this possible?

2656
02:16:57,251 --> 02:16:59,830
The most uptight person I know.
How is this a thing? Well,

2657
02:16:59,860 --> 02:17:04,720
you know as well as I do that the
further you go left you, you, you,

2658
02:17:05,730 --> 02:17:10,140
you reached the same sort of zealotry
that you do when you go all the way rice,

2659
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:10,691
correct.
You,

2660
02:17:10,691 --> 02:17:15,691
you meet these crazy people that are just
completely connected to their idea of

2661
02:17:16,061 --> 02:17:20,740
being correct and they take the most
rigid stance on all these issues on the

2662
02:17:20,741 --> 02:17:25,150
left side or on the right side and it's
so goddamn common. It's human behavior.

2663
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:28,650
It's also incredibly boring. I mean
there's just nothing to discuss with with,

2664
02:17:28,730 --> 02:17:29,190
yeah,

2665
02:17:29,190 --> 02:17:32,610
I agree and that's one of the reasons
why it's so disgusting when people miss

2666
02:17:32,611 --> 02:17:37,000
labeled people like so it was an article
that connected me with Richard Spencer.

2667
02:17:37,510 --> 02:17:39,280
Like what?
And the fuck.

2668
02:17:39,550 --> 02:17:44,110
Like that is such a disingenuous thing
to do and they know what they're doing.

2669
02:17:44,140 --> 02:17:46,760
They're the trying to get me to react to
it and talk about it and we'll get more.

2670
02:17:47,570 --> 02:17:50,950
It's put it's horse shit like anybody,

2671
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:56,040
but if you are locked into that far
left ideology as far left as you can go,

2672
02:17:57,940 --> 02:18:02,500
and it's one of the problems
with ideologies that have
these extremists is that

2673
02:18:02,710 --> 02:18:06,400
you believe in a percentage of
the things these people say,

2674
02:18:06,490 --> 02:18:09,760
but then they go way too far with it.
But you're connected with them.

2675
02:18:09,940 --> 02:18:11,770
You're connected with them
because you're a part of that.

2676
02:18:11,771 --> 02:18:14,440
Even though you don't
have a similar notion.

2677
02:18:14,450 --> 02:18:19,450
Steven pinker got brow
beaten over suggesting that
failure to ask questions and

2678
02:18:19,631 --> 02:18:21,910
give plausible answers gives,
excuse me,

2679
02:18:21,911 --> 02:18:24,760
credence to the alt right
that that if you do a essay,

2680
02:18:24,761 --> 02:18:26,470
he did a whole speech where he said,
listen,

2681
02:18:26,471 --> 02:18:30,340
there are lots of conversations about Iq
and race and they all right loves these

2682
02:18:30,341 --> 02:18:34,150
conversations because then they then
they suggest wrongly the black people are

2683
02:18:34,151 --> 02:18:39,151
inherently unfit and white people are
more fit and all of that kind of stuff and

2684
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:44,400
he says there are great ways to
explain how much of Iq is is cultural,

2685
02:18:45,071 --> 02:18:47,290
how much can be changed,
how much has genetic,

2686
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:50,110
how much that actually matters
in terms of real life outcomes.

2687
02:18:50,110 --> 02:18:52,750
We can do all those things,
but when you say don't ask the question,

2688
02:18:52,780 --> 02:18:55,690
stop asking the question,
then you make people Google.

2689
02:18:55,691 --> 02:18:58,690
And the only thing that they will Google
and find our answers that are given by

2690
02:18:58,691 --> 02:19:00,520
people who are actually outright,

2691
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:03,420
and he got ripped as
outright for this argument,

2692
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:07,720
was don't allow people to push into
outright answers by failing to give them

2693
02:19:07,721 --> 02:19:10,690
proper responses or by throwing them out
the window. And then people are like,

2694
02:19:10,691 --> 02:19:12,170
well, you're all right now
because you're saying that,

2695
02:19:12,171 --> 02:19:14,140
that people should be able to ask
questions like, it's almost like,

2696
02:19:14,141 --> 02:19:14,960
it's just like,

2697
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:18,070
it's the exact same version as people in
the religious community where it's like,

2698
02:19:18,190 --> 02:19:18,401
you know,

2699
02:19:18,401 --> 02:19:20,980
I used to go to Sunday school and then I
asked him any questions and they kicked

2700
02:19:20,981 --> 02:19:25,420
me out. Right? That's, that's
not how religion is supposed
to work. That's not how,

2701
02:19:25,421 --> 02:19:28,190
that's not how reason it's supposed to
work, not how any of this is supposed

2702
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:30,380
to work. Right. And there's also,

2703
02:19:30,381 --> 02:19:33,870
when you're investigating any thing,

2704
02:19:34,010 --> 02:19:38,960
any measurable thing, w when you
find a number, whatever it is,

2705
02:19:38,961 --> 02:19:42,620
like these people, like a Asian
folks are better at mathematics. UH,

2706
02:19:42,860 --> 02:19:46,730
European folks are better at this and
like what is, what's the reason for that?

2707
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:49,990
Like what, what's, let's find out,
is it cultural, is it biologicals?

2708
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,270
It's something can we learn about
how human beings evolved and adapted?

2709
02:19:53,390 --> 02:19:54,920
Why are Nigerian so smart?

2710
02:19:55,340 --> 02:19:58,610
Like there's so many Nigerians that
come to this country. They thrive,

2711
02:19:58,611 --> 02:20:02,090
they thrive in business.
They're extremely motivated.

2712
02:20:02,091 --> 02:20:05,720
They're extremely disciplined. It's
like, it's like almost like Korean folks.

2713
02:20:05,870 --> 02:20:10,410
Why do Koreans like, why are they so
hardworking? Why are they strived?

2714
02:20:10,420 --> 02:20:14,360
And obviously these are big
generalizations, but what
is it about Italians? What,

2715
02:20:14,361 --> 02:20:18,080
what, what makes them wear gold chains
and loved mafia movies? Like what is it?

2716
02:20:18,110 --> 02:20:20,930
Those are my people.
We go with the what the fuck?

2717
02:20:20,931 --> 02:20:23,330
Why are they all talk like that?
Like what is that?

2718
02:20:23,480 --> 02:20:28,480
What causes any sort of ethnic group
to turn out the way they turned out?

2719
02:20:28,551 --> 02:20:31,130
What and why are so many European
Jews Nobel Prize winners?

2720
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:35,150
What the fuck is going on over there
and also like what is the impact of the

2721
02:20:35,151 --> 02:20:39,530
measurable on how we live our lives? Like
Shit, how much should this stuff matter?

2722
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:39,921
Is this,

2723
02:20:39,921 --> 02:20:43,190
is this a result of discrimination or
is this a result of something else?

2724
02:20:43,460 --> 02:20:45,470
Is it true that when you group
any group of people together,

2725
02:20:45,471 --> 02:20:46,380
racially or non racially,

2726
02:20:46,381 --> 02:20:48,290
there will be disparities between
those two groups of people.

2727
02:20:48,291 --> 02:20:49,940
This is just true statistically like,

2728
02:20:50,330 --> 02:20:53,120
but not asking those questions and
then saying, shut down the questions.

2729
02:20:53,270 --> 02:20:56,750
What that actually does is it leads
people to only get the answers to the

2730
02:20:56,751 --> 02:20:59,360
questions from the people who don't
know what they're talking about in many

2731
02:20:59,361 --> 02:21:01,670
cases and who are giving convenient,
easy,

2732
02:21:01,671 --> 02:21:04,340
and self laddering answers about
the nature of, of themselves.

2733
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:08,160
The fear is it being used by racist
to reinforce their position? Right,

2734
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:11,980
but what you find out is that those agents
are a superior race, right? They'll,

2735
02:21:11,981 --> 02:21:14,480
they'll do and they'll do that anyway.
One of the,

2736
02:21:14,481 --> 02:21:17,120
one of the funniest things about white
supremacists is they're so fucking stupid.

2737
02:21:17,150 --> 02:21:18,620
I mean, pardon the language. Like the,

2738
02:21:18,621 --> 02:21:23,540
the white supremacists are invariably
not the Nobel prize winners. It's, it's,

2739
02:21:24,100 --> 02:21:25,730
hey,
go to a white supremacist compound.

2740
02:21:25,731 --> 02:21:27,620
You're not looking at a bunch of
people who are carrying cancer.

2741
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:31,160
These people piss me off and it,
and this is an now and I'll say, oh,

2742
02:21:31,161 --> 02:21:33,390
that won't matter to medial label me
outright tomorrow. Cause that's what I,

2743
02:21:33,391 --> 02:21:34,610
this goes well,

2744
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:39,490
the disingenuous media that's being less
and less taken seriously taking less

2745
02:21:39,530 --> 02:21:42,620
than less seriously.
It seems to me that that trend,

2746
02:21:42,621 --> 02:21:46,310
which is a common trend that's existed
for the last few years of these click

2747
02:21:46,311 --> 02:21:49,220
baity bullshit articles
and mislabeling people,

2748
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:51,620
it's going to go away because your,
your,

2749
02:21:51,621 --> 02:21:54,050
your perspective is not
going to be appreciated.

2750
02:21:54,050 --> 02:21:55,880
It's not going to be respected if you,

2751
02:21:55,881 --> 02:22:00,710
if you're obviously making disingenuous
statements like that. And I think, um,

2752
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:05,270
we're in this weird position where it's
very difficult to find real journalism

2753
02:22:05,271 --> 02:22:09,680
and real objective takes on things
that aren't flavored by their ideology.

2754
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:12,380
And everybody's trying to shape
everybody and they feel like it's their

2755
02:22:12,381 --> 02:22:13,071
obligation.

2756
02:22:13,071 --> 02:22:16,040
They feel there's many people that
write things that feel like it's their

2757
02:22:16,041 --> 02:22:21,041
obligation to change your perspective on
a national subjects and things that are

2758
02:22:21,651 --> 02:22:25,200
important to us that not their obligation
to just report what's going on,

2759
02:22:25,201 --> 02:22:29,430
but also their obligation to flavor things
in a way that will make one side look

2760
02:22:29,431 --> 02:22:30,470
favorable to the other.

2761
02:22:30,510 --> 02:22:33,540
Yeah. Well, I'm, I'm very much in favor
of journalists revealing their biases.

2762
02:22:33,670 --> 02:22:34,221
I think that the,

2763
02:22:34,221 --> 02:22:36,870
the greatest line media is that
objective journalism is a thing.

2764
02:22:37,050 --> 02:22:39,540
So I'm conservative.
You don't go to my site,

2765
02:22:39,541 --> 02:22:41,790
you'll get a conservative spend on the
news. That's the way it's going to work.

2766
02:22:41,850 --> 02:22:42,631
Right?
And guess what?

2767
02:22:42,631 --> 02:22:45,090
CNN is liberal and they're going to
give you the liberal spin on the news.

2768
02:22:45,210 --> 02:22:47,370
And that's just the way this is
going to work to do. See the video,

2769
02:22:47,371 --> 02:22:50,250
when the Mueller report came out and
they look, look, somebody got killed.

2770
02:22:50,370 --> 02:22:54,210
Oh my God. It was crazy. Shit.
Kennedy got shot. Yeah. Exit. Yeah.

2771
02:22:54,240 --> 02:22:57,510
Should you be happy if you guys
believed in Mueller, everybody was like,

2772
02:22:57,511 --> 02:23:02,010
Mueller is the fucking man. He's going to
go get Trump. This guy, he's methodical.

2773
02:23:02,130 --> 02:23:05,040
He's precise,
people getting booted out and everything.

2774
02:23:05,070 --> 02:23:08,400
Votive candles with his face on them that
they could like bird. They were pumped.

2775
02:23:08,430 --> 02:23:10,800
Yeah. And then he came out and it was
like, well no collusion or it was like,

2776
02:23:10,801 --> 02:23:14,700
well I guess that now it's a
cover up. It's like, wait, what?

2777
02:23:15,240 --> 02:23:17,970
Wait a minute. Yeah, maybe.
Maybe. Maybe the narrative has it,

2778
02:23:17,971 --> 02:23:19,080
maybe the narrative has,
has,

2779
02:23:19,110 --> 02:23:21,540
has trumped the actual job
you were supposed to do guys?

2780
02:23:21,770 --> 02:23:22,131
Well,

2781
02:23:22,131 --> 02:23:25,970
it's just so many people were so convinced
and there were so many people that

2782
02:23:25,971 --> 02:23:30,650
were making statements that
in retrospect are probably

2783
02:23:31,310 --> 02:23:36,280
like you could probably,
I mean,

2784
02:23:36,281 --> 02:23:38,740
I don't want to say I'm
not a litigious person,

2785
02:23:39,070 --> 02:23:43,470
but if I was a guy like Donald Trump, oh
man. Yeah. There's so many people to sue.

2786
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:45,100
It was,
it was amazing.

2787
02:23:45,101 --> 02:23:48,130
I mean I remember I was on Bill Maher's
show and we were supposed to talk about

2788
02:23:48,131 --> 02:23:50,140
free speech stuff in like five
minutes before and he's like,

2789
02:23:50,141 --> 02:23:52,690
let's talk about Russia, his producer,
Kevin, let's talk about Russia.

2790
02:23:52,691 --> 02:23:55,780
And I was like, okay, fine. So we
get on to producers so that, yeah,

2791
02:23:55,781 --> 02:23:58,540
this is like right before they switched
the topic for your TV shows where they

2792
02:23:58,541 --> 02:24:02,530
just tell you what you have to talk.
The guy comes in with a clipboard. Yeah,

2793
02:24:02,640 --> 02:24:05,140
it was, it was a little bit,
it was a little bit strange.

2794
02:24:05,170 --> 02:24:08,380
And we got on stage and we, he's
talking about Trump, Russia collusion,

2795
02:24:08,650 --> 02:24:09,940
and I said what I've always said,

2796
02:24:09,941 --> 02:24:12,580
which is I'll wait for the evidence to
come out and then I will make a decision

2797
02:24:12,581 --> 02:24:15,820
as to whether Trump, Russia collusion
was a thing and Bill Maher's Datical.

2798
02:24:15,910 --> 02:24:19,060
I know. And Bill Margot's you don't,
you don't believe it was a thing.

2799
02:24:19,270 --> 02:24:21,130
And I was like, well I don't see any
evidence yet that it was a thing.

2800
02:24:21,131 --> 02:24:24,880
Like I see some evidence of attempts to
collude like John Jr I see some attempts

2801
02:24:24,881 --> 02:24:26,380
of people trying to get information,

2802
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:28,690
but I don't see evidence of
like actual legal collusion.

2803
02:24:28,691 --> 02:24:32,680
And why don't we just wait like you guys
keep wanting Muller to gives her like

2804
02:24:32,681 --> 02:24:37,180
let's just wait on it. And Mark could
not believe that this was my perspective.

2805
02:24:37,690 --> 02:24:40,480
Right. It was like, it was like
shocking to him. Why should,

2806
02:24:40,481 --> 02:24:41,550
why should the perspective,

2807
02:24:41,560 --> 02:24:44,500
I'm waiting for more evidence be
shocking to anyone when it is obvious the

2808
02:24:44,501 --> 02:24:48,520
evidence is not out. Like why? Why is
that in any way controversial? It's,

2809
02:24:48,521 --> 02:24:49,420
it's bewildering to me

2810
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:54,960
because people have this need to let
everyone know that they're on the right

2811
02:24:54,961 --> 02:24:59,250
side and they want you to know that
they do believe in the collusion.

2812
02:24:59,251 --> 02:25:01,830
If you disagree with
that for whatever reason,

2813
02:25:02,100 --> 02:25:05,460
you must either be a right wing person,

2814
02:25:05,461 --> 02:25:07,800
a Trump supporter or
someone who's in denial,

2815
02:25:07,801 --> 02:25:10,670
someone who doesn't look at the evidence
and you're a part of the problem. Yup.

2816
02:25:10,980 --> 02:25:14,160
But the, the real problem
was jumping to conclusions.

2817
02:25:14,430 --> 02:25:17,190
There obviously seem to be some attempts.
There's,

2818
02:25:17,191 --> 02:25:20,590
there's obviously some fuckery
with that IRA company that the,

2819
02:25:20,610 --> 02:25:24,010
the Internet research agency
that is responsible for

2820
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:28,270
millions of interactions
with people online where they
pretended to be different

2821
02:25:28,271 --> 02:25:31,670
supporters. Yes. They,
they caused conflict,

2822
02:25:31,690 --> 02:25:35,350
like constant conflict in regards to
political opinion and that's all real.

2823
02:25:35,351 --> 02:25:37,990
That was coordinated effort to
try to change people's opinions,

2824
02:25:37,991 --> 02:25:41,080
but how much that had to do with Donald
Trump. How much did they ask for?

2825
02:25:41,110 --> 02:25:44,740
First of all, you've got no
evidence. Also, I was always
bewildered by this theory,

2826
02:25:45,010 --> 02:25:46,970
like did you watch that campaign?
Um,

2827
02:25:47,050 --> 02:25:50,470
that was not the most well coordinate
campaign and it was chaos. It was chaos.

2828
02:25:50,530 --> 02:25:53,110
I mean, I knew everybody who was
in the campaign, like it was a,

2829
02:25:53,140 --> 02:25:56,320
it was a shit show and the idea that
they're sitting there but there,

2830
02:25:56,350 --> 02:25:58,330
but when the mass comes off at night,

2831
02:25:58,750 --> 02:26:02,140
they call it Vladimir Putin and they put
together a point by point plan on how

2832
02:26:02,141 --> 02:26:06,070
they're going to swing this
particular precinct in rural,

2833
02:26:06,180 --> 02:26:09,690
in rural Michigan. It's like, what?
What are you, are you guys hi?

2834
02:26:09,790 --> 02:26:12,920
Like what are you talking
about? Like, like it,

2835
02:26:12,990 --> 02:26:15,100
if you could attribute
this to anything here,

2836
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:19,450
here's a good rule of thumb for politics.
Attribute everything to stupidity.

2837
02:26:19,451 --> 02:26:22,690
Unless you can prove malice.
The real problem,

2838
02:26:22,930 --> 02:26:26,530
and this is something that is very similar
in what we were talking about earlier.

2839
02:26:27,010 --> 02:26:32,010
When you say something and you say
it over and over and over again,

2840
02:26:32,231 --> 02:26:37,150
and you say it with such conviction and
it becomes a giant part of your news

2841
02:26:37,151 --> 02:26:40,480
narrative and then that's something
turns out to be horseshit. Yup.

2842
02:26:40,660 --> 02:26:44,200
You just massively empowered Trump.
That's it. That's exactly right.

2843
02:26:44,201 --> 02:26:45,920
And a massive land for a
long time that you know,

2844
02:26:45,970 --> 02:26:48,760
I'm not a big fan of Trump's fake news
shtick because I think he applies it to

2845
02:26:48,761 --> 02:26:50,800
broadly. I think that whenever
there's a bad piece of news,

2846
02:26:50,801 --> 02:26:51,970
he's like fake news and it's like,

2847
02:26:51,971 --> 02:26:55,810
well sometimes yes and sometimes no
by now that you just blew a two year

2848
02:26:55,811 --> 02:26:58,060
narrative where he was
clearly in Putin's pocket,

2849
02:26:58,450 --> 02:27:01,660
how many people were you
thinking to listen to the
nuanced view of fake news now

2850
02:27:01,930 --> 02:27:04,150
and how many people do you think are
going to actually believe Trump when he

2851
02:27:04,151 --> 02:27:07,310
says that a bad piece of news is
legitimately a fake piece of news. Yeah.

2852
02:27:07,311 --> 02:27:11,980
And empowers him in a, in
a, in a spectacular manner.
They made a giant mistake.

2853
02:27:12,130 --> 02:27:15,980
Oh yeah. And they blew, they blew
this one in spectacular fashion.

2854
02:27:16,270 --> 02:27:19,000
People are still hanging in
there with all they had to do.

2855
02:27:19,001 --> 02:27:22,450
This is true for so many people right now.
All you have to do is not be crazy.

2856
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:24,460
Just stop it.
It's all you have to do.

2857
02:27:24,461 --> 02:27:28,340
It was talking about the possibility
that Trump has been a Russian assets and

2858
02:27:28,341 --> 02:27:31,780
it's like 1987 or some shit, so
it was a, I mean Andrew Mccabe,

2859
02:27:31,781 --> 02:27:35,470
the former FBI director was asked whether
Trump was legitimately a Russian asset

2860
02:27:35,471 --> 02:27:38,620
and he's like, I don't know. It's like
you're using the power of the institution.

2861
02:27:38,621 --> 02:27:42,910
He used to run to spread this nonsense
and he got that from John Brennan.

2862
02:27:43,090 --> 02:27:45,790
He got it from James Clapper and these
are all former heads of the intelligence

2863
02:27:45,791 --> 02:27:46,220
agencies.

2864
02:27:46,220 --> 02:27:49,180
Just makes me think the intelligence
agencies need to be wildly her back.

2865
02:27:49,181 --> 02:27:50,080
If these were the heads of them.

2866
02:27:50,740 --> 02:27:54,310
I mean if like the heads of
the intelligence agencies
are using their platform

2867
02:27:54,340 --> 02:27:56,470
to proclaim that they have
inside information about Trump,

2868
02:27:56,471 --> 02:27:57,730
that turns out to be utter nonsense.

2869
02:27:58,450 --> 02:28:00,730
I'm not sure these people should
have that much power to like, Geez,

2870
02:28:00,750 --> 02:28:04,200
is that what he's saying or is he saying
he doesn't know? He didn't say, I dunno.

2871
02:28:04,210 --> 02:28:09,210
He was saying like I have basically I
expect that Mueller's going to indict as a

2872
02:28:09,431 --> 02:28:12,790
former intelligence professional. I
expect it. Yeah. There's a lot of that.

2873
02:28:12,820 --> 02:28:16,540
It was ugly. Adam Schiff on the, on the
Intel Committee doing the same thing.

2874
02:28:16,570 --> 02:28:19,150
It's crazy now because
like what do they do now?

2875
02:28:19,180 --> 02:28:22,670
Like how do they rebound from this? If
this is that you didn't let just say once.

2876
02:28:22,820 --> 02:28:26,680
This is something you said for two years
you've seen the compilation videos,

2877
02:28:28,400 --> 02:28:30,450
they've done them to rap
music and so they're like,

2878
02:28:30,620 --> 02:28:34,610
they put a beat behind it and have you
seen it? No. There's some great ones,

2879
02:28:34,670 --> 02:28:39,470
some great comp. There's compilations
of people saying possible collusion,

2880
02:28:39,620 --> 02:28:40,580
possible collusion,

2881
02:28:40,581 --> 02:28:44,420
possible in this music that goes with it
and they just cut to possible collusion

2882
02:28:44,510 --> 02:28:48,620
with the Russians. Possible
Russian collusion. Possible
Russian collusion. It's,

2883
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:51,650
yeah. They blew it in a major way. Yeah.

2884
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:54,620
I mean there's plenty of shit to complain
about. You didn't have to go with that.

2885
02:28:54,730 --> 02:28:58,130
Like the idea was that he was a train
at target rich environment when you

2886
02:28:58,131 --> 02:29:02,060
decided to go to, he's a Russian
trader. It's no way out or something.

2887
02:29:02,061 --> 02:29:03,900
And he was Kevin Costner as a last thing.
Like what?

2888
02:29:04,930 --> 02:29:06,860
He could have ever beaten Hillary.
Sorry.

2889
02:29:06,861 --> 02:29:08,330
I'm going to check my watch
to get out of here man.

2890
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:10,400
I do a little bit when you
have to leave right now.

2891
02:29:11,330 --> 02:29:13,270
I wanted to ask you one more question.
One more question.

2892
02:29:13,271 --> 02:29:16,160
What did you think about this? Um,
Chelsea manning situation? Cause I,

2893
02:29:16,161 --> 02:29:21,161
I don't know exactly what happened other
than she's in contempt of court and so

2894
02:29:22,281 --> 02:29:24,080
they've got her in solitary confinement.

2895
02:29:24,081 --> 02:29:27,470
Now w this is about testifying
against speaking. I'll be honest,

2896
02:29:27,471 --> 02:29:28,790
I haven't been following it that closely.
I mean,

2897
02:29:28,791 --> 02:29:32,550
my understanding is that Chelsea Manning,
who,

2898
02:29:33,590 --> 02:29:37,350
okay, say, here's where we get color.
Bradley. No, he changed the name.

2899
02:29:37,370 --> 02:29:42,080
He changed his name to Chelsea. He has
a biological male can leave your eyes.

2900
02:29:42,081 --> 02:29:44,770
Gendering are you dead naming
as well? Don't know. No I don't.

2901
02:29:45,650 --> 02:29:48,470
But unless we are talking about
when he committed his crime,

2902
02:29:48,471 --> 02:29:50,840
do you explain he was actually
Bradley as opposed to Chelsea. Right.

2903
02:29:50,841 --> 02:29:51,650
So if we're talking about,

2904
02:29:51,650 --> 02:29:54,110
so he presented those convicted that
was a male named Bradley Manning.

2905
02:29:54,140 --> 02:29:56,210
Did you say they, you're talking
about the formerly known as Bradley.

2906
02:29:56,320 --> 02:29:59,900
And if we're talking about the human
being who is currently in jail,

2907
02:29:59,901 --> 02:30:02,600
that is a male who is currently
known as Chelsea. So, okay.

2908
02:30:02,850 --> 02:30:07,850
So my understanding is that Bradley is
that Chelsea manning is a refused to hand

2909
02:30:08,871 --> 02:30:13,871
over information that he was legally
bound to handover about wikileaks.

2910
02:30:14,840 --> 02:30:17,390
And now there were complaints
that he's being held in solitary,

2911
02:30:17,391 --> 02:30:20,600
but that's not true apparently.
Uh, and that he's being mistreated.

2912
02:30:20,870 --> 02:30:23,540
I do find it weird that the same people
who are complaining about Donald Trump

2913
02:30:23,570 --> 02:30:27,920
coordinating with wiki leaks are very
upset about Chelsea manning going to jail

2914
02:30:27,921 --> 02:30:28,980
for coordinating with wikileaks.

2915
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:31,280
You're gonna need to pick one or the
other is wikileaks batteries. Wiki leaks.

2916
02:30:31,281 --> 02:30:33,110
Not Bad.
What is wikileaks?

2917
02:30:33,111 --> 02:30:37,250
It's only dependent upon whether or not
they're supporting the narrative that

2918
02:30:37,251 --> 02:30:41,010
you want. That's exactly right. And lackey
leaks was very good. Right, right, right.

2919
02:30:41,070 --> 02:30:42,890
Exactly.
It was right and left by the way,

2920
02:30:42,891 --> 02:30:45,340
like there are people on the right
where it's like Julian Julian Sanchez,

2921
02:30:45,350 --> 02:30:48,740
the worst and then 2016
happened like Julian Assange.

2922
02:30:48,740 --> 02:30:51,860
Now there's a person I can really
talk to. It's like, well, no,

2923
02:30:51,861 --> 02:30:55,460
I'm pretty sure Julian Assange is
a wiki leaks. Good information.

2924
02:30:55,461 --> 02:30:59,810
Suggest they are Russian front group and
take make up that what you will end of

2925
02:30:59,811 --> 02:31:00,200
story.

2926
02:31:00,200 --> 02:31:04,730
Do you think that they became a Russian
front group to try to stay operative and

2927
02:31:04,731 --> 02:31:08,510
stay safe because they were obviously
being attacked by the United States

2928
02:31:08,511 --> 02:31:11,990
government and endanger being shut
down and then they've kept, I mean,

2929
02:31:11,991 --> 02:31:12,650
he's been in the US.

2930
02:31:12,650 --> 02:31:15,650
I really don't know enough about
wikileaks to to to really get into it.

2931
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:16,850
I don't want to see the historical,

2932
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:19,710
but I know that he's been
trapped in that embassy for

2933
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:22,080
since 2012 yeah.

2934
02:31:22,081 --> 02:31:25,110
I mean I hope that he's got some video
games or something in there. Fuck man.

2935
02:31:25,111 --> 02:31:27,390
He's been in there for like
seven years now. Right.

2936
02:31:27,391 --> 02:31:30,900
That's a long time to be in an end, but
it's a long time. It can't go outside.

2937
02:31:30,901 --> 02:31:35,790
No sunlight. Pamela Anderson visits
every now and then. He's fucked, man.

2938
02:31:35,791 --> 02:31:37,530
I mean it's,
it's a terrible place to be.

2939
02:31:37,531 --> 02:31:41,370
And I don't know if it's better than
prison because it's like the stress of him

2940
02:31:41,371 --> 02:31:44,550
never knowing when they're going to come
knock down the door and pull him out of

2941
02:31:44,551 --> 02:31:47,040
there. I was like, how, how
wild is that guys sleep? Yeah.

2942
02:31:47,130 --> 02:31:50,820
Seven years in that embassy.
It can be great. It can be
great. It's gotta be awful.

2943
02:31:50,821 --> 02:31:52,020
They took his internet in a way,
right?

2944
02:31:52,130 --> 02:31:55,260
Uh, I think they did. That's
fucked. Although to be fair,

2945
02:31:55,261 --> 02:31:59,090
Wiki leaks was releasing information on
specific American soldiers in lines of,

2946
02:31:59,130 --> 02:32:03,210
of combat. So yes, they didn't redact
any of the names. That was the problem.

2947
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:05,160
That's why people were
pissed. Really? Yes.

2948
02:32:05,190 --> 02:32:08,400
Because the original dump from Chelsea
manning was that he dumped all the

2949
02:32:08,401 --> 02:32:09,300
information to wikileaks,

2950
02:32:09,330 --> 02:32:12,450
including the stuff that was unredacted
and Ricky leaks just released it.

2951
02:32:12,451 --> 02:32:14,250
They did. That was, that was the
plane. That was the claim. Anyway.

2952
02:32:14,380 --> 02:32:17,410
Um, I don't know if that's
accurate because if he,

2953
02:32:17,510 --> 02:32:19,430
if he vine differently than
let me know cause I'll,

2954
02:32:19,431 --> 02:32:21,830
I'll be happy to correct all these.
Yeah. You know, I'm sure you would.

2955
02:32:21,831 --> 02:32:24,320
I just don't know if it that is,
I don't know.

2956
02:32:24,380 --> 02:32:26,960
I don't have the information in front
of me. Do you want to check? No,

2957
02:32:27,050 --> 02:32:29,750
they'll take too much
time. That'll do. Folks,

2958
02:32:29,751 --> 02:32:31,580
you're going to have to Google this one.
Um,

2959
02:32:31,610 --> 02:32:34,880
but so when,

2960
02:32:35,300 --> 02:32:38,210
one of the things that I was thinking
when Trump got into office while this

2961
02:32:38,211 --> 02:32:39,470
drain, that swamp shit, I was like,

2962
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:42,140
well wonder if Trump would
be a wiki leaks supporter.

2963
02:32:42,530 --> 02:32:46,220
I wonder if Trump would be happy. It
depends what if it helped him. Yeah, sure.

2964
02:32:46,221 --> 02:32:50,270
Right, right. Or even and snowed in as
well. I was wondering about that. Yeah.

2965
02:32:50,550 --> 02:32:51,660
It's same sort of thing.
I mean,

2966
02:32:51,690 --> 02:32:54,870
unfortunately politics very often has
little to do with principal and everything

2967
02:32:54,871 --> 02:32:57,990
to do with convenience. Yeah.
So if it's helpful, sure. If not

2968
02:32:58,440 --> 02:33:03,300
like him who's always anti deep state and
talking about the, the, these, I mean,

2969
02:33:03,550 --> 02:33:04,870
I do have extremely critical,

2970
02:33:05,020 --> 02:33:08,340
yes. But I'll do, I have a feeling that
once you actually sit in the big seat,

2971
02:33:08,341 --> 02:33:10,640
I think that tends to change.
Remember Obama was too. Yeah.

2972
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:12,600
And then five minutes later
he was drawn in people.

2973
02:33:16,770 --> 02:33:19,860
Well listen, um, I know you've got to get
out of here, so let's just wrap this up.

2974
02:33:19,861 --> 02:33:20,850
Tell people about your book.

2975
02:33:20,930 --> 02:33:21,980
Yeah.
So you can check out my book.

2976
02:33:21,981 --> 02:33:24,200
The right side of history talks about a
lot of the sort of deeper issues we were

2977
02:33:24,201 --> 02:33:27,540
talking about Judeo Christian values
and reason and sort of the, it's,

2978
02:33:27,541 --> 02:33:32,210
it's a kind of short form philosophical
history of the West from Sinai through

2979
02:33:32,211 --> 02:33:34,970
Greece and talking about all the
major enlightenment philosophers,

2980
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:36,950
some of the things we talked
about on the show or in the book.

2981
02:33:36,951 --> 02:33:39,290
It's number one bestseller on the
New York Times nonfiction list,

2982
02:33:39,291 --> 02:33:42,560
at least at the moment. Congratulations
man. That's awesome. I appreciate it.

2983
02:33:42,561 --> 02:33:44,450
It's really pretty
spectacular. Exciting. Exactly.

2984
02:33:44,570 --> 02:33:49,460
Um, your show also Ben Shapiro show, you
can get the Ben Shapiro show on iTunes.

2985
02:33:49,461 --> 02:33:52,850
You can get it on Youtube, your
Sunday review, which I did once. Yeah.

2986
02:33:52,900 --> 02:33:55,520
Sunday special. It's special enough
to have you on again. I would love to.

2987
02:33:55,580 --> 02:33:59,420
Thank you. Thanks for being here, and your
book's available on Amazon everywhere.

2988
02:33:59,650 --> 02:34:01,190
Okay. Bench Shapiro, Ladies and gentlemen,

2989
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:05,320
that was great.
