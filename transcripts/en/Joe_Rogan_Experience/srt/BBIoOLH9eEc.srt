1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,943
I start the video.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,313
Um,

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,510
tell me what's up for folks who
would just hit me on Ustream.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,540
You can just start
talking about Sam Harris.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:09,950
A big,

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,460
big fight.

7
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,293
Islamophobia.

8
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,493
Okay,

9
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,620
well good experience.

10
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,070
Try my day.

11
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,730
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

12
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,480
What are those guys?

13
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,680
What does that neighborhood
like now discuss?

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,860
Is this you right here on the right.

15
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,510
That's me all the way over there.

16
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,910
But scan my legs disgusting.

17
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:35,950
And what were

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,980
his legs?

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,620
Which one of his legs?

20
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,463
That right there.

21
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,840
The Italians moved down to Charlotte.

22
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,693
Had money.

23
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,130
Guys are the union.

24
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:53,430
I'm Yulia Jorma teams
and make $24 an hour.

25
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:54,150
What?

26
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,290
I make up about 80 grand,

27
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,101
they go to Atlantic city.

28
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:56,920
I don't want that much.

29
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,380
I'm saying they all moved down the shore
and the rest is fucking like not even

30
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:02,550
killed but I'm Puerto Rican.

31
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:05,630
It's like El Salvadorian Hindus.

32
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,930
That's how it always goes.

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,690
It comes in waves.

34
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,370
Fucking crazy.

35
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,750
And then my grandparents,

36
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,970
it was all time and then it changed to
black and then it went from black and

37
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:19,710
Puerto Rican and they
went in from Puerto Rican,

38
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:20,600
Dominican,

39
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,380
Nicaragua and shit like that.

40
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,663
Delicious.

41
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,680
I'm on site twice the size.

42
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:29,370
It's giant.

43
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,203
Huge.

44
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,350
Almost too huge.

45
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:32,310
I thought it was almost to the month,

46
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,260
but then,

47
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,690
uh,

48
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,530
when I first got it,

49
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:37,890
I took it to England and
that was on the phone a lot,

50
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,650
like doing text messages
and emails and stuff.

51
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:41,011
And I was like,

52
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:44,160
this is a much better
experience for that much better.

53
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,050
I don't know how to shut it off.

54
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,573
So if everything,

55
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,810
so you were just a here just with
a hearing and Henner in Manchester,

56
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:54,931
right?

57
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:55,510
Yeah.

58
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,240
Yeah.

59
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,073
That was this guy's,

60
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,451
yeah.

61
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,350
Well I train with here on,

62
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,300
I know and Oh,

63
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,380
you training with him now
you would train Chris Harder,

64
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,110
is that who you're talking to?

65
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,750
And I was training with him and I'm a
black belt under here and in Henner and

66
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,170
then I kind of migrated to hearing
you the bad ass of the intellectuals.

67
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,060
Now when you go look
the skeptic conferences,

68
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:12,930
they have seminars.

69
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,530
Uh,

70
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:14,770
I,

71
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,210
I don't,

72
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,520
I don't think I've been to a
skeptic's conference since I started,

73
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:18,961
well,

74
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:20,460
I shouldn't say Steph skeptic conference,

75
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,570
I should say debate.

76
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:22,450
You know,

77
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:22,890
you've,

78
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,560
you've been in quite a few very
entertaining debates online,

79
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,340
um,

80
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,720
more atheist than skeptic,

81
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,201
right.

82
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:28,960
With the,

83
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,200
I,

84
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,440
there was one that you did
with this really smart dude.

85
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:32,460
It was really fascinating.

86
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,150
Um,

87
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,440
I believe he was a Jewish guy
and he was so passionate about,

88
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,341
about religion.

89
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:42,510
He was so passionate about
the intellectual pursuit
of religion and it was

90
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:44,640
really fascinating to
watch him like we've,

91
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:45,474
his dance,

92
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,700
like he tried to make it
seem like it made sense.

93
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:48,534
It clearly didn't,

94
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,520
but it was fascinating to watch him.

95
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:55,521
We've this dance and it was all pros
and delivery and drama and you put it

96
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,770
together in such an entertaining for,

97
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,690
you almost want to go with them.

98
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,020
Like God,

99
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,620
maybe.

100
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,453
Maybe there is a god.

101
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,660
Maybe the Bible's true.

102
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,450
I think you're talking
about a rabbi Wolpe yes,

103
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,600
that's exactly what I'm talking about.

104
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,443
Debate at twice,

105
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,211
once alone,

106
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:12,211
and once with Hitchins and it was Hitchins
and I against role hoping in another

107
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,623
rabbi.

108
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,080
You get accused of something
that I think is very fascinating.

109
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,940
You get accused of Islamophobia and
it's by liberals and progressives.

110
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,260
There's this new thing that's really
interesting to me that you can goof on

111
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:28,270
Christianity to the
fucking cows come home,

112
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,420
you can shit on Mormonism and polygamy
and any other cult Scientology.

113
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:35,770
You can goof on anything
and no one says a peep.

114
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,380
But if you say anything about Islam,

115
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,510
progressive people will
dean you Islamophobic and
they'll say there's something

116
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:43,991
wrong with you.

117
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:47,200
I think that's a really
interesting thing that we do.

118
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,330
And I show there's a lot of psychological
reasons because you know we're,

119
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,340
we're bombing them because here there's
less bendy right here and going back to

120
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:59,710
this and you've gotta I handle,

121
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,100
don't put your hand around.

122
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,083
Put It on this.

123
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,140
Okay.

124
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,973
Okay.

125
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,870
And if you're going to
put your hand around,

126
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,750
go like this and squeeze
the fingers together.

127
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,440
You like that?

128
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:09,681
Oh,

129
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:12,500
not the small finger right here.

130
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,911
Yeah,

131
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:14,744
now it's squeezed them.

132
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,310
Okay,

133
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,220
now you're cutting the blood
spy off the thumb a little bit.

134
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:19,940
A little bit.

135
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,773
Okay.

136
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,370
This is a curl.

137
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,900
This is a rip curl and rip curl and rip.

138
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,310
And you get used to that.

139
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:31,220
And when you're cranking
guy's neck or choking him,

140
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,810
it doesn't slip.

141
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,650
If you squeeze the
thumb and also you know,

142
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:36,861
you,

143
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,380
you're going like this
and it might slip off.

144
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:39,790
Right.

145
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,780
But it's my slip.

146
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,510
Yeah,

147
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,110
but no,

148
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,010
not that finger.

149
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,473
Yeah.

150
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,261
Okay.

151
00:04:45,261 --> 00:04:46,580
Now Curl and Rep.

152
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,630
So you feel like this is
more stable than I do of all.

153
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:51,560
Uh,

154
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,393
but uh,

155
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,230
I always see this this way.

156
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,270
Now you're going like this,

157
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,540
you're using your back to c and
you're pulling them in clothes.

158
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,670
It doesn't feel like
you smash your fingers.

159
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,050
Like this is the time.

160
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:06,580
But just,

161
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,550
just the thumb.

162
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,290
Squeeze the thumb.

163
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,300
Are you squeezing the thumb,

164
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,500
your theater,

165
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,333
getting red.

166
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,150
Now as you squeeze the
thumb and go like this,

167
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,230
that's a curl.

168
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,250
And this is a rep across his face.

169
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,643
I like that.

170
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,710
Huh?

171
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,000
Now do it the other side.

172
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,593
Yeah.

173
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,110
And go this way.

174
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,720
Now you're still working out
at the Machados or any of that.

175
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,390
Yeah.

176
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,140
And then he brought was to everybody.

177
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:39,501
Yeah.

178
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:43,250
I've been injured for a little bit about
how big of a neck injury and it just

179
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:48,251
got of time go car said to come by
our place of not to prove yourself,

180
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,601
you know,

181
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:54,910
just to go there and see the
place I used to have those days.

182
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,510
They are,

183
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,610
these are uh,

184
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,833
peer counseling.

185
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,073
Um,

186
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,300
I like to use these for
the hook because even for,

187
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:06,951
for kids,

188
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,110
I had also it teaches the,

189
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:09,944
um,

190
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:10,980
it just,

191
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,310
it,

192
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,530
it simulates a lot better cause I feel
the pad when you're hitting something,

193
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,430
I'm holding the myths,

194
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,890
but they can actually see
the power in this one.

195
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,061
So when I teach it,

196
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:21,920
I teach you like the karate kid hook.

197
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,420
Even all my students do this.

198
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,641
So you didn't,

199
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:27,770
you know the credit kid when
he has a on the bow and the,

200
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:29,210
he was in the island and the guy was,

201
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,980
he had the drum thing,

202
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,370
right.

203
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,930
And everybody was doing it right.

204
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,950
So it's kind of like that because you're
spinning your hip and your whole hook

205
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,970
comes from your hip and your arm is
just a rope in your hand as a rock.

206
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,261
So I tell people,

207
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:43,910
visualize your hand being a rock.

208
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:44,601
I mean,

209
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:45,830
and you're harming a rope,

210
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,120
no power in your arm.

211
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,440
Your arm is relaxed,

212
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,700
your hand is tight,

213
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,590
and it all starts from your hip.

214
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,780
So just so just turns that way and
you spin it and you don't stop.

215
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,080
You go in this direction has almost
the same with the right hook,

216
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,240
but it's mainly the left took,

217
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:03,110
I teach that way.

218
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,610
So it's like a whip,

219
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,541
it's like a whip,

220
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:09,200
but you're hitting them with a rock
and most efficient use of movements.

221
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,980
And then,

222
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,690
and then the commitment is not there.

223
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:12,710
Like with a right hand,

224
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,970
if I throw it hard,

225
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,480
I'm giving the person my hip so
the wrestler could get my hip.

226
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,040
When I'm throwing my hook,

227
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm trying my hip over
there on the way past,

228
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,950
I'm trying to hit their chin
from my hip's going here.

229
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:26,480
So even if it's a wrestler,

230
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:27,770
I just step out this way.

231
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,340
It's easier to defend a take down
cause I'll commit all the way.

232
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,670
Even taking my eyes off him cause
it's really hard to counter this hook.

233
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,130
He might grab her single
and I can step through,

234
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,350
but I want all my coat hook.

235
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,510
So when I'm did hooks I did it this way.

236
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,583
And then,

237
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,630
and when I,

238
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,040
when I teach them not coming back first,

239
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,120
the way I teach them to not pull back
first is have this guy tried to drop it

240
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,410
because you'll see a guy like
this and then they pulled back to,

241
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:55,880
so the hook every time.

242
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,490
But if you're out here more like I
used to have chuck find out here.

243
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,100
So then from here it says he steps in,

244
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,540
you can just turn it right over.

245
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,560
So if he's right here,

246
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,420
you don't pull it back first.

247
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,283
He can drill that.

248
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,600
Alright.

249
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,433
Alright.

250
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,370
And so it's ascending,

251
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,890
it's going to get a network
connection with other second.

252
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,641
Okay,

253
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:15,360
great.

254
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,193
So this is easy.

255
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,543
Um,

256
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,820
yeah android APP is much
nicer than the iPhone is it?

257
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,170
Yeah.

258
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,280
Cause at first it was really annoying.

259
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:24,114
So that's gone.

260
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,070
So now if you go into your piggy bank,

261
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,030
okay,

262
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,760
wait a bit.

263
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,170
That's all right.

264
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:31,920
Don't phone.

265
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,760
So I go send.

266
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,103
That's all.

267
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,123
I liked the Samsung.

268
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,730
Thank you.

269
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,510
This is cool.

270
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,343
Now I can say,

271
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,580
so I say scan the Qr code this
most you heard that the um,

272
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,750
the mega is not as good as the galaxy.

273
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,540
You know that resolution is not as good.

274
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,220
It's actually the guts of the gs three,

275
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,643
a galaxy

276
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,260
guts.

277
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,770
It's not that good.

278
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,300
It's just big.

279
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,140
But I gotta copy George Dress.

280
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,050
You see how it says one,

281
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:01,720
three HC.

282
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,420
It's just to send me this in an easy way.

283
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,130
You could also copy
paste that in an email.

284
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:06,330
There's nothing secret about this.

285
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,590
It's like an email address.

286
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,490
Just your identifier.

287
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,430
And at one point I say 0.005

288
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,993
and said,

289
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,550
and asked me for a second password
because I'm trying to send money

290
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,960
and then you just wait a few seconds.

291
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,820
It's still sending on this side.

292
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:30,651
Oh,

293
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:31,484
thank you.

294
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,993
Okay.

295
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,770
Now this was not from
my phone to your phone.

296
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,690
This was from me to the bitcoin network.

297
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,040
From the Big Horn network to your phone.

298
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:44,670
So if you weren't,

299
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,500
Kuala Lumpur would have taken
the same amount of time.

300
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,473
Right?

301
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,730
Let's just mediated by the network.

302
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:56,620
Now tell me when you could
send $5 electronically to
some random person without

303
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,660
jumping through hoops
and taking seven days.

304
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,320
And I know this is a lot
more than paypal obviously,

305
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:03,470
but even as,

306
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,920
as to how it does such a better job.

307
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,950
And if I wanted to,

308
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,330
I want them to freeze this by the way.

309
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,140
No one,

310
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,973
oh no,

311
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,210
this is sitting on keys
or a wallet on this phone.

312
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,150
Also on the website to best as a backup.

313
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:19,871
Now,

314
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:22,300
if somebody wanted to buy more bitcoin,

315
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:23,470
how would they go about doing that?

316
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,420
Um,

317
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,560
two ways for Americans.

318
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:30,910
Probably the easiest one is you go to
coinbase.com I can write it down for you.

319
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So Coinbase is a San Francisco company.

320
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,530
They work with the banks,

321
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:37,210
they're registered as
a money transmission.

322
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,860
They've done some of the regulation.

323
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,140
So connect via ACH,

324
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,430
direct debit to your bank account.

325
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,730
They'll do two small deposits to verify
that it's yours and you give them,

326
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,031
you know,

327
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:46,900
like paperworks.

328
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,790
And then once they've got that link up,

329
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:49,211
you say,

330
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:52,480
buy bitcoin $5,000 boom.

331
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:52,901
It's going to say,

332
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:54,190
this is the price we're going to get you.

333
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,150
It's going to debit your account in four
days and four days later your account

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,440

338
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,570
