1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:07,110
Boom and live cheeto. Santina of
gentlemen come u with the hot ones.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,710
Hello Sir. How are you going?
I'm big daddy. Good brother.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,250
Just played a little bit of pool
and lost a game and lost. Lost One.

4
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:18,750
Ill illegitimately you one, one
illegitimate. You mean lost?

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,390
You lost one illegitimately yeah.
Yeah.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,810
Scratching is not a good way to win
or we are scratching the eight ball.

7
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:28,070
These gentlemen. It is. It is the way
to, when it happens, even to the baskets.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,180
It's a real way to win. I'm
good you. While you can't,

9
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,370
you must control the cue ball.
I have no,

10
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:37,290
I have no balance over any
of that stuff whatsoever.

11
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,110
I know there's a little red dots on
there. Yeah. It means nothing to me.

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,910
Those little red dots are the,

13
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:46,140
they call that the measles cue ball
in that cue ball they've developed for

14
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:50,010
television so that you could wash the
ball spin so you know what kind of English

15
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:52,230
the guy puts on the ball has nothing
to do with the person that shooting

16
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:57,120
whatsoever. It does. Yeah. It's the
person that like for the, for the most,

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,940
it's a very controversial ball.
You really want to get into it.

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,950
I do because it has a different reaction
than a red circle cue ball or a red dot

19
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:08,430
Q ball. Those are the preferred cue
balls have a lot of players. Right,

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,740
but the measles cue balls,

21
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,990
it's just maybe the tiniest bit
heavier or the surface is different or

22
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:19,980
something. But it's still legal. People
use it in tournaments. Yeah. Okay.

23
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,560
But players got, some players got
angry when they came up with it.

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,270
They didn't like it.
They like the old cue ball.

25
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,480
That's how precise the reactions are.

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,530
When we get to the very top level of pool
players, let's kind of like golf balls,

27
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:33,810
but people think almost don't
mean anything to golfers. They do.

28
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,080
I'm sure the field is so there's
a lot of soft, softer golf balls.

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,050
Like a lot of people like Titlest makes
predicting a provi once or probably one

30
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:43,740
access harder, softer. He average
Joe who's full of Shit, who's like,

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,020
I like Pro v one it doesn't
mean anything to him.

32
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,620
Some guy that's like a 15 or 20 handicap.
It means nothing.

33
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,650
A guy that's like a scratch golfer.
Like a like a pro pool player.

34
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,850
It makes all the difference. Yeah. How
it comes off the face, how it spins.

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,250
There's a thing called a mud ball.
If it's buried in mud it, it,

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,360
it reacts differently the moment
it comes off the face mud on it,

37
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:07,440
it's even a little bit right? Yeah.
That mean the tiniest bit that, wait,

38
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,250
can you hear pros?

39
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,100
Impressive bulk offers to as they played
with a bunch of different weights of

40
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:11,934
clubs.
Yeah.

41
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,020
It's like a pool player basically uses
one cue and maybe one cue to break with

42
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:20,580
and some players even break
with their playing cue. But you,

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,700
you don't have like a bunch of different
cues for a bunch of different shots

44
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:24,460
usually.

45
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,290
Well this cause the distances but you
just get used to the feel of one cue.

46
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,970
So when a player changes cues,

47
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:33,330
like say if you go from a 18
ounce Q two at 21 ounce Q,

48
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,640
there's a big difference in
the way it hits the ball,

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,880
drives through the ball different. You
have to make the Q do more of the work.

50
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,650
Right.
Heavy with a heavy Q.

51
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:43,690
Do you think it mentally changes the
way you strike it? Totally, yeah.

52
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,590
That's the Fox and people's heads.
That's what's so impressive about golfers.

53
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:48,870
They got all these different weights.
Everything's different shape.

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,070
It's different. There's a guy, I
think his name is Bryce. Cindy Shambo,

55
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,520
I think that's the golfer he used.
All his clubs are cut to the same length,

56
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,130
which is really rare. Nobody does
that. Like almost every club set

57
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,000
you get is all different
lengths clubs and he is this,

58
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,560
people did it years and years ago,

59
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,140
but he's like one of the only guys on
tour that now cuts his clubs to the same

60
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:12,220
length cause he mentally wants to have
the same exact stance over the ball no

61
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:15,970
matter the shot. It's pretty smart.
It's, I mean it's a, it's a cool,

62
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:19,720
interesting concept. A lot of golfers
don't know how to adjust that much.

63
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,670
I don't know Jack Shit about golf, but
there's guys with weird strokes and pool.

64
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,830
There's guys with weird technique
in boxing and it still works. Yeah.

65
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,050
There's people that do shit different.
There's no way that,

66
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,490
I don't think there's
any right way in sports.

67
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,320
Some of the ugliest shots in basketball
tend to be some of the most fun to watch.

68
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,610
And sometimes they're really good.

69
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,510
Like sometimes like the classic Ray Allen
basketball stroke is probably the most

70
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:46,120
beautiful jumpshot, you know,
compared to him and Jordan.

71
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,060
But there are guys that
have terrible looking shots,

72
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,430
but they're fucking phenomenal.
It's just,

73
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,690
it's just consistency and their
inner balance over, you know, the,

74
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:57,640
the timing that they have in
the release that they have.

75
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,490
That's to say that's gotta be the same
thing in every sport pool for same shit

76
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,340
for sure. In boxing too. Yeah. You know,

77
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:07,510
in boxing it used to be thought
that you pretty much, you know,

78
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,020
if you went to a good trainer, they
would teach you to keep your hands up.

79
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,520
Those always the way to box. But then you
get to a level of like a Tommy Hearns.

80
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,440
You remember the way Tommy
Hearns used to fight?

81
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:21,190
He used to keep his left hand low.
Really low. Yeah. Down to the side.

82
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:26,950
And he would snap that left hand at
you like a fucking let Colebra man is

83
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:31,000
cracked motor city Cobra. He would just
pop that fucker right in your face.

84
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:33,280
That's why they used to call them that
because it was coming out of fucking

85
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:37,060
nowhere. Hitman, Tommy Hearns.
He was a bad motherfucker dude.

86
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:40,540
And then he would hit you with that right
hand and he had so much torque cause

87
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:44,680
he was really wide. He was really
long and wide for a welterweight man.

88
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,450
You'd look at him in 147 pounds.

89
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:51,451
I think he was probably like six two and
just shred hatch act and just Korean 47

90
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,130
at six two is lightweight champ.

91
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,640
You're see what he looked like when
he fought sugar ray Leonard. Uh Huh.

92
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,090
Oh my God.
Yeah.

93
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:02,140
And then he went up to one
60 fought Hagler and got k
owed by Hagler and a crazy

94
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:03,580
slug fest. You never saw that. Fine.

95
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,100
Pull up Marvin Hagler versus Thomas
Hearns. This might've been the great,

96
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,390
I think it went two rounds,

97
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,510
but it might've been the greatest two
rounds in the history of the middle weight

98
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:16,660
division because these two guys
were super skilled. I mean,

99
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:19,420
Marvin Hagler was a
brilliant technical boxer,

100
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,240
can switch from south pod
orthodox like fluidly like you,

101
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,300
you didn't even notice a difference.

102
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,900
He fought just as good from both sides
and he knocked everybody out and had an

103
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:32,230
iron chin and Tommy Hearns was
mark and motherfuckers. He mark,

104
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:37,150
Roberto Duran with one punch. It's blank
face planted on fucking one punch, man.

105
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,810
He's titty. Stung with one shot
and let me let them see that first.

106
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,070
Here's the buildup. The buildup
is Tommy Hearns, [inaudible],

107
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:46,210
Roberto Duran.

108
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,670
Let's watch that first and then we're
going to go back to Marvin Hagler versus

109
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:55,100
Tommy Hearns. So you get a feel for what
it was like to be able to switch up.

110
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,520
Your stances is so crazy to me to be
able to do that so fluidly that well,

111
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:01,130
that's one of the brilliant
things about Hagler.

112
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,670
I mean he was just so good
at that and he get in.

113
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,810
It's weird for a guy when you're used to,

114
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,850
I remember the first time I
fought a guy who was left handed.

115
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:11,030
It was super confusing.
Everything's coming from the wrong place.

116
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,940
Everything was like reversed.
You gotta get used to it, right?

117
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,860
You don't see it as often, right?
So if you don't see it as often,

118
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,300
sometimes it's more effective. But some
guys are really good. Again, southpaw,

119
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,730
some guys have like a
lightning right hand.

120
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,360
And that was one of the speculations
about Hagler and Hearns cause Hearns had

121
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:30,980
this lightning right hand and
Hagler oftentimes fought south pot.

122
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:33,890
And that's the counter for south
hall is a, is a straight right. Now,

123
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:37,550
watch this though. This is just goes to
show you how God look, how big he is.

124
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,860
Rude. She's look at
this. Ooh, come on man.

125
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,450
When Tommy Hearns Merck
people, he's marked people
and you've got to understand,

126
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:55,070
man, he did this to Roberto Duran.
That's fast in slow motion, dude,

127
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:58,370
he was so fast, fast, even
in fucking slow motion.

128
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:00,740
He was so fast and he hits so hard,

129
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,130
but now you've got to watch this
and this is Hagler in his prime.

130
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,660
He was 30 years old who was the undisputed
mother fucking middleweight champion

131
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,090
of the world and most people thought
he's the best pound for pound fighter on

132
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,120
earth and Tommy Hearns of course you
just saw what he did to Roberto Duran and

133
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:17,900
it was a lot of speculation,

134
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,980
a lot of speculation coming into this
fight and they just went at it from the

135
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:24,100
beginning of the round.
There was very little feeling.

136
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,490
It was just constant pressure by
Hagler right hooks, boom, boom,

137
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,920
we this bro, they, they're going to war.

138
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,420
These are two of the best fucking
middleweights ever and they're standing in

139
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:39,950
front of each other, go wing to war and
it doesn't feel like anybody's faced.

140
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:42,340
It feels like there's, it
feels like they're at the
exact same energy level too.

141
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,490
Oh Dude.
Both of them are.

142
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:47,300
They have the same output
look fucking crazy fight Matt.

143
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,510
And they were throwing full power shots
from the moment the fight started and

144
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:56,300
they right in front of each
other. Man, if for Hearns this,

145
00:07:56,301 --> 00:08:00,290
this negates is gigantic reach
advantage over almost everybody. Yeah.

146
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,060
So Hearns decided to fight this way.
He decided to stand right and look at him.

147
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,320
The referee could barely separate herds,

148
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,340
decided to stand right in front of Hagler
and haggard decides to have right in

149
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,560
front of her aunts and they
just now Hearns is moving.

150
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,310
See now this is what Hearns could have
done from the beginning and made it

151
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:20,090
interesting. Sticking and moving. But
by the time he decided to do that,

152
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:23,760
he was already touched up and Marvin
starts moving in for the kill that left

153
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:24,620
hand to the body.

154
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,930
Hagler was relentless in his
cardio was fucking supreme.

155
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,310
It was supreme. He always put pressure
on people and you couldn't have hurt him.

156
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,380
He only had one bullshit knocked down.

157
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:39,740
His entire crew is a bullshit knocked
down. He fly. I think it was one role,

158
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:41,810
Dan and won role.
Dan kind of like,

159
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,250
it was more like a shove and maybe maybe
they tripped or something like that.

160
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,120
And the referee called it a knockdown.
But I remember thinking God,

161
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,160
cause Hagler had a weird thing that
he was either born with or developed.

162
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,410
He had giant muscles on
the side of his head.

163
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,060
Like he was temple worn with head gear.
I'm not bullshitting.

164
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,980
They had him and this was like a big
thing in the world of sports back in the

165
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,870
day like that. He was literally almost
born for this. That's how good Hagler was.

166
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,320
Yeah. These motherfuckers are really,
I mean it's relentless do their,

167
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,010
they're towed up every time it's up there.

168
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:20,160
Barely look looking for any
distance between each other.
And you got to realize,

169
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:21,990
man,
this is not how people usually fight.

170
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:24,450
They don't throw full
power shots and every shot,

171
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,450
I mean they'd be tired within 15 seconds.
These guys are just going at it.

172
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,270
So I think this was like
almost like a game of chicken.

173
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:33,160
Like both of them knew there were never
going to reach the 12th round. Right.

174
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,070
So they said fuck it,
let's just do this.

175
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,120
And haggard just stood right in front
of them, constantly blasted them.

176
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,300
And you see at the end of the first round,
Hearns is wilting.

177
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:47,050
He just does not have the
power or the speed or the
movement. See, he's all goofy.

178
00:09:47,051 --> 00:09:50,190
Yeah, he's sloppy. He's just
exhausted. He is exhausted.

179
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:54,000
But still the warrior in him is making
him throw these fucking bombs, man.

180
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,790
You got to realize like at the time,

181
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,910
no one really knew what the fuck
was going to happen in this fight.

182
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,670
And then Hagler heard them.
Yeah.

183
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,390
There's a little stumble in one of
one of hagglers incredible attributes.

184
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:09,930
Besides his skill was his
determination to win. Man,

185
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:14,160
he was just Keizer for Roche's
competitor, man. Just ferocious.

186
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,640
And so if someone was willing to
engage him in this kind of crazy fight,

187
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,270
we're going to stand toe to toe and
see who's the bigger man. Oh my God.

188
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:22,230
Everyone's going to die.

189
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,500
That is going to take you to the end of
the earth man to the end of the earth.

190
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,150
I mean, haggler just looked like he just
had, it's still so much left in the tank.

191
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:35,760
Even at the end of the first round,
like if he's not doing this for years,

192
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,360
he's never had a shape. He never
partied. He never did anything stupid.

193
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,680
What did he didn't want any short? No,
never got fat. No drugs, no alcohol,

194
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:44,910
no nothing. No. And how about this?

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,050
Retired after the sugar ray Leonard
fight lost a controversial decisions.

196
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:53,760
Sugary Lennar to, to this day, I think you
won. And then, but it was a close fight,

197
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,180
but and then just retired and became
a fucking movie star in Italy.

198
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,360
That's fucking wild. Love that guy.
Yeah, but that's the way to do it.

199
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,360
I'll kind of go out of the good
prime and then just say good night.

200
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,770
Nobody else did it like him, man.
Nobody else did it. Like, Ooh,

201
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,910
that's where you heard him. Yup. Now
he's just moving in for the kill.

202
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,070
Move in for the kill.
Now he's taking his time.

203
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,430
See now it's just nice and relaxed.
This is inevitable.

204
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:18,330
Now Marvin is just moving in and
decide and when he's going to uncork,

205
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:21,900
when he's going to uncork moving in,
blocking these shots, he knows it.

206
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:24,660
Hearns is hurt and he
starts teeing him up.

207
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,560
Shanahan and Hearns is
trying to move down.

208
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,480
See now that's how I thought
Hearns was going to fight. And Mo,

209
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,450
most people thought Hearns is
going to fight from the beginning.

210
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,700
Like that just keep me down.
Got moved from the outside,

211
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,800
from the outside like that.
I mean that's,

212
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,840
that's classic Thomas Hearns but the
warrior and him wanting to find out,

213
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:48,060
you know, and want to find out who's the
baddest motherfucker in town. Who is it?

214
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,120
You know, you could fit you and you
can feel him backing up. Kinda he,

215
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:54,130
he knows what's kind of,
it's like he knows what's coming.

216
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,520
He, he's getting in some good shots.
Even then he's creating distance,

217
00:11:57,521 --> 00:12:01,940
but even still, it just doesn't feel like
he's balanced. See that right there. Oh,

218
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,980
he's hurt. Haggar standing right in front
of him. He is touching him, but he's,

219
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,780
he just doesn't have the pop anymore.

220
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,330
You know what it's like when you're
working out and at the end of the workout

221
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:13,360
you're fucking exhausted and
you could barely do one rep.

222
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,100
That's what happens with your arms
when you're fighting. It just,

223
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,300
there's nothing left. There's nothing
left. It's not like, you know,

224
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,320
he's doing this on purpose.
Right. He's, he doesn't have it.

225
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:28,120
There's no gas in his arms, like his
arms are completely flooded right now.

226
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,600
Like all the blood in them and every,
it's just they're not recovering.

227
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,320
It's a horrible feeling to, he's
swinging though. Look, he's swinging,

228
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,680
but it's way slower than it was the
first round. Right. His snap was,

229
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,750
snap was so much quicker in
the first round and now he's,

230
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,970
now he's not following
through a little bit. Exactly.

231
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,600
He's trying to conserve energy.
He realizes he can't do this forever.

232
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:49,690
He's exhausted God there, but they both
look like they're fucking at that one.

233
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:52,150
That little breaking point
where it's about to be either.

234
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,760
I'm telling you it Hagler
even though he might,

235
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,120
it might look like that because it is a
fast pace. He could do this for years.

236
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,260
He says they can do this. He
just didn't get tired, man,

237
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,970
and you couldn't hurt him. He was crazy.
He fought a dude named John the beast.

238
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:10,780
Mugabi and John the piece when Gabby
was fucking terrifying people, man,

239
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,530
he starts Terry Norris. He starts to
bunch of dudes. He was a heavy puncher,

240
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:20,550
heavy puncher and Hagler stood right in
front of them and he got caught with one

241
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:22,990
big upper cut and it didn't even budge.

242
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,440
Upper cuts that were like Merck and
people didn't even, he didn't even flinch.

243
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,430
So what round was it? Was it the third
round of the third year? The third round?

244
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,720
Here's the third round right here.

245
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,380
It shows you how fucking tough
Tommy Hearns was. I mean,

246
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:39,820
those two rounds were just
fucking knockout. Drag out.
Relent. Yeah, just nonstop.

247
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,450
But towards the end, you clearly see
hagglers coming on. I mean, he looks good,

248
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,550
he looks good and he's pacing himself.
Now he's just, just moving forward,

249
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,470
throwing shots. But yeah.
Hearns is exhausted, man.
It's fucking raw. Rough man.

250
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,720
There it is. Boom, boom, boom.

251
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,160
Or just trying to keep it and
I was trying to keep him right.

252
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,140
He's having a hard time breathing
though, man. I mean, he's exhausted.

253
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:06,630
See that big deep breath.
What are you take that Big Sigh?

254
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:10,450
It's almost like not, uh, somebody
lost a mouthpiece, I think.

255
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,070
Is that what it was? He called his time.
Yeah. I think that's what happened.

256
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,610
I Dunno man. It's hard to tell.
It's really blurry for this.

257
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,460
Just going to say Amanda to
two 40 p was weird back then.

258
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,670
Hod look normal to us back then. Your
eyes knew how to handle it, right? Well,

259
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:28,540
you were just excited that you could see
the fight. Right. You know, but this was,

260
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,520
it was,
I wonder if this,

261
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:32,940
would it look like when it's on HBO
had to vent a little bit on those TV.

262
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,980
Do you know Hbo just canceled boxing?

263
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:39,790
They don't have boxing anymore
at all. At all. Just paper view.

264
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:43,150
Now they don't even do pay per view.
They're out of the boxing business. What?

265
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,270
Yeah, and that crazy. So they'll never end

266
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,980
and he's moving boom, right hand.
Oh, it's does it. He knew it.

267
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,540
Damn. Dance it. Third round
gone. I always miss this.

268
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,160
I always think it's just
hanging around for some reason.

269
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:02,600
I think we've actually gone over this
before, but third round. Yeah man.

270
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,290
But I don't have boxing anymore.
HBL got out of the boxing business.

271
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,750
What do you think that's because of
it's not earned enough money anymore.

272
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,450
I don't know.
It makes me sad though.

273
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:14,760
They had some of the greatest
boxing telecast of all time.

274
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,340
I mean that was what you would do.

275
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:19,310
You'd go if a big fight was
on Bernard Hopkins was on,

276
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,520
a lot of the times it was on
HBO and it was on paper view.

277
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,150
Then you knew it was going to be
on HBO the following week. Right.

278
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,990
So even if you couldn't
afford the pay view,

279
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,870
you could see the hang in there
a week later. You knew who won,

280
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:32,600
but you could watch the fight on HBO.
I remember going to watch,

281
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:34,430
I remember watching fights in Hpo.

282
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,590
I just remembered that let let HBO boxing
being such like a emblematic thing for,

283
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:41,210
you know what I mean?
It's so recognizable.

284
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:45,050
So like pay view on Hbo so them
get out of the game is so strange.

285
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:47,180
It's kind of like the
revolution that's happening now.

286
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,210
The last fight I went to with you at
UFC, now their ESPN, what does it plus?

287
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,370
ESPN plus. That's what it
is. Private paid service.

288
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,370
It's a subscription service, like
a Netflix for sports, but it's,

289
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,100
it's not just UFC fights. It's,
it's a bunch of other stuff. Wow.

290
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,910
All kinds of shit and stuff. They
just won't show on ESPN at Aldo? No,

291
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:12,200
they sometimes show you
mean it's ESPN content?

292
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:17,201
I guess so you could watch some fights
that were on ESPN plus later they'll

293
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:21,800
probably show him on ESPN. Sort of like
the same thing with Hbo pay per view,

294
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,400
you know, but um, I think
what HBO did with Paper View,

295
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,620
it was brilliant where you
would have the paper view,

296
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:28,940
but then let people watch it for free.

297
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:30,770
A week later you're just
going to make more fans. Yeah.

298
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,750
It's like you're not going to
lose money on the paper view.

299
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,830
I'm just going to make more fans.
Well that's the whole idea of like a,

300
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,380
that's why this, this, this
is funny. I was going to talk
to you about this anyway.

301
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:43,130
I just moved and I cancel my
directv. I'm done. I canceled them.

302
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,360
I cut the wire and I'm just doing
like a Hulu live TV, Internet shit.

303
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,150
All the years of hearing people being
like cutting the cord, cutting the cord.

304
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:54,290
I'm like, I dunno man. I like it now. Fuck
it. I love, I love what I'm doing now.

305
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,123
And I gotta Tell Ya,

306
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,340
I can get all the shit that I want
for cheaper than I had it before.

307
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,550
And it's just way more convenient now.
I used to be so tethered to being like,

308
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,970
I'll never give up cable now. I'm like,
fuck it. I don't want it anymore. I don't,

309
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:07,100
I don't want it.
This has been the best version.

310
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,360
I'll always have a blockbuster
card. Oh yeah. It'll never go away.

311
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,530
It'll never Hollywood video,
dude, I want to rent, man.

312
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,670
If you put all your money in that he like,

313
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:21,671
I'm telling you in 20 years this is going
to amount to $15 million fucking Klan.

314
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,460
Do you think people invested in Netflix
when it was the DVD subscription service

315
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:31,520
and that, you know what I mean, like early
on and now they're still getting the,

316
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,120
the revenue dividends of what Netflix
is now. I wonder about that. Oh yeah.

317
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,050
I'm sure you do.
Like,

318
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:38,480
that's gotta be the best money cause
it was worth nothing back then.

319
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,850
It was just another subscription
video service and they had,

320
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,580
there was a ton of them. I mean Red Fox.
I did my first Netflix special in 2005.

321
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,980
Oh my God, there's one
left. Oh, I think I've

322
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,180
seen this. Oregon. Here you go.
Yes. An Oregon, Oregon Bend, Oregon.

323
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,480
That's so weird to last.
Blockbuster.

324
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,660
They went from 4,855 stores
in 2008 to one store.

325
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,310
2018.

326
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,750
That is the craziest demolition
of a business I've ever heard.

327
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,190
I wouldn't never heard of
what other business in our
lifetimes vanish like that.

328
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,830
Like, uh, like I've come
or like a storefront.

329
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:20,370
I can't think of something that went
away that quick little industry gone.

330
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:25,140
It was John. It was a part of our weekend.
Yeah. You go to plop buster. Huge.

331
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:28,770
What do they got right?
Ah, you hear anything about
this? He'd look at the cover.

332
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,750
I don't know that I never
even heard of this one.

333
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,950
Maybe it's good watching like obscure
Dolph Lundgren movies that were made in

334
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:39,540
Italy. Yeah. You would, you'd get to
pick out shit that you're like, ah,

335
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,510
this looks kind of dope. We'll
see. Back then. Gamble was fun.

336
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,680
The name meant a lot like it was like
this guy from dances with wolves.

337
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,430
Oh, okay. Remember that guy? I can. Cool.
You'll take a chance. Yeah, you will.

338
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,700
You will. But I think that's
happening again now with Netflix.

339
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,080
I'll take a chance with
shit now that I've,

340
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,730
Shit I've never heard of because Netflix,

341
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,670
you pop up all these different
titles and you'll go, hmm,

342
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,020
I'll try this fucking shit.

343
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,800
I just started a new show I just tried
to show and it's called dead to me with

344
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,600
Christina Applegate. Christina
Applegate. Yeah. It's okay.

345
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,110
But like I try, I'll try it. I
would have never think to, to, to,

346
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,870
to watch this new show
about these, you know, this,

347
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,010
have you gone through all the staples at
Netflix? Said, did you watch Ozarks yet?

348
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,120
Done? Watched both seasons. Phenomenon.
One of the best shows I've ever seen.

349
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:27,810
Did you watch unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt?
Now I've seen a few episodes of it,

350
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,980
but I fucking hilarious. She gets f
people like it. But I love that show.

351
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:36,040
It's so silly at the same kind
of tone as 30 rock. Right.

352
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,860
Does it say it's Tina again?
Tina Fey's in it too. Oh she is.

353
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,520
Sometimes she plays this
wacky psychologist. It's
out of her fucking mind.

354
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:46,960
Likes to party. Yeah, she craves David.

355
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,630
She has some of the best
character development man.

356
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,560
That's why 30 rock was so good. That show
is funny, man. Kimmy Schmidt is funny.

357
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,400
All right, I'll, I'll watch it. I'll try
it. It just didn't seem like my show.

358
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,660
It's absurd. You gotta give
it a chance, right? It becomes
really, it's really good.

359
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,050
That's why it was like a some dull
moments and one of those series,

360
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:07,920
but they tightened it up
quick. They, whatever problem
they have with the writing,

361
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:11,250
they've fixed it real quick.
Right. Well, I mean, first
seasons are always hard, man.

362
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,960
Well, I mean just writing is hard.
Yeah. Writing for a Sitcom so hard.

363
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,120
They hit ruts sometimes, you know? Yeah.

364
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:21,810
Like sometimes I'll watch old Seinfeld
when they pop on and some of the episodes

365
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:25,020
are just fucking flawless there.
Bangers like everything to be stories.

366
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:28,170
Just as funny as a story and
it's, sometimes you watch a
few and you're like, Huh,

367
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,130
yeah. They were like, they
had a tough week tunic.

368
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,410
You could tell they had a tough go. I
remember that feeling with the news radio.

369
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:36,840
I remember like episodes where just like,
Ooh,

370
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,410
well we did our best and that's
all there was this one. Yeah,

371
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:44,310
let me see what happens. They just
don't, and then you'll have the next one.

372
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:48,010
That's just insane. And a lot of
times it's, it's like stand up in that

373
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,090
sense that a lot of times
it's just like the subjects,

374
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,140
like what are the subjects?
Like what,

375
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:56,750
what juicy topic do you have?
Right. You know, what, uh, what,

376
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,790
what is happening? And you just, yeah.

377
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,660
You have to have something that engages
people and sometimes it's sitcoms.

378
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:07,810
Like fuck, you have to put out
20 something episodes a year,

379
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,330
2123 right.

380
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,630
23 short stories in a year.

381
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,450
I make them all tie in and have a nice
little kind of a perfect through lifelong

382
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,210
season. I know what nowadays a lot
of people relying on on politics,

383
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:24,670
which I think is, you know,
it's becoming the new norm.

384
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:26,980
Every time I see a billboard
now it's a new political show.

385
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:29,650
It's like a why it's
seen act just got one.

386
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:33,040
Jordan Klepper who was a daily show
correspondent. He just got another one.

387
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:37,230
Hassan Manoj as his, I mean there's
like so many political shows now. They,

388
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,010
they should all be writing
letters thanking Trump.

389
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,850
It's like Trump is really fueling all
these new shows. If it weren't for him,

390
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:46,810
it was like this new wave of political
satire. I don't think I've had,

391
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,000
I've seen this in comedy in my career.

392
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,390
I've never seen this many shows
about politics. Samantha Bee,

393
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,890
I mean I just named five in a row.

394
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,370
John Oliver show is right that
last week tonight or whatever.

395
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:01,960
That's essentially a political base show.

396
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,700
It's, it's slightly political, but it's
very social too. Yeah, it is. It's,

397
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,360
it's fucked up right in the week.

398
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,280
He's, I mean, listen, he's brilliant and
some of these shows are probably great.

399
00:22:11,281 --> 00:22:13,650
I just think there's so much
political comedy right now. It's just,

400
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,700
it's not my shit.

401
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,740
No. Oliver's excellent.
Yeah. He's a genius.

402
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,890
The whole thing is what's,

403
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,870
what's uncomfortable is that it's very,

404
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:25,650
they're very little conversations taking
place and a lot of people that are like

405
00:22:25,651 --> 00:22:28,950
really angry. Yeah. You know? Yeah.
I was watching this guy, some,

406
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,930
some representative,
I don't even know his name,

407
00:22:30,931 --> 00:22:35,931
but he was a offering a hundred dollars
to name the these girls that were in

408
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:37,920
front of a,
um,

409
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,850
planned parenthood and um,

410
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,010
he's like a grown man that these, they're
girls, they're young Christian girl.

411
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,070
What do you mean name them as
in like call them out games

412
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,560
so he could shame them publicly. Cool.
Very smart. This guy's named name and,

413
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,090
but he's an offering on this video.
$100 like,

414
00:22:57,091 --> 00:23:00,550
but this is where people have gotten to
where they think that that's okay. Yeah.

415
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,900
Like these people you have like,
do,

416
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,110
I know you're there to support
a woman's right to choose,

417
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,700
but you have to understand that these
people think that this is a place where

418
00:23:11,701 --> 00:23:14,940
they kill babies. Yeah. Right.
This is what they think.

419
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:17,910
Whether regardless of what you think,
right. This is why they're there.

420
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:19,880
They're not there because they're evil.
Right.

421
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,280
And I know that this would put unwanted
pressure on a girls going there for an

422
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:27,840
abortion. I get it. I get the whole thing.

423
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:31,710
I get it from your side and I see
where they're coming from too.

424
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,510
And although I fully support
a woman's right to choose you,

425
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,720
you can't want to dox people that think
they're saving babies or talking someone

426
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:46,010
into having a child and
that they think we'll

427
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,030
become the kind of relationship with
that child and that mother become like

428
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:53,650
their mother and them or like
the ideal version of that. Sure.

429
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,300
I mean that's what they're, they're not
doing it because they're bad people.

430
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:56,781
Right?

431
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:59,960
Like there's some groups that do it just
because they're pieces of shit like the

432
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:03,260
Westboro Baptist church. Like they
do things because they're bad people.

433
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,730
Like all they want to do is go
protest a soldier's funeral.

434
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,480
I didn't want to cause a stir Megan Phelps
who left them, right, that got out. Yes.

435
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:16,280
Yeah. And now, dude, she met a guy
on Twitter. It's a great store,

436
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,440
right? It's an amazing human. Again. Well,

437
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,820
she started talking to people and then
investigating and real and dude, wow,

438
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:25,370
I'm telling you, when you talked
to her, she's like the nicest,

439
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,080
most reasonable person. Right? To think
that just 15 years ago, whatever it was,

440
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:34,940
10 years ago, she was a full on zealot.
It's weird. And her dad or uncle,

441
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:39,260
grandfather, brother can't even get it
right? Her grandfather is the Fred Phelps.

442
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:42,170
He started the whole thing. He's
the old dude, that old mean guy.

443
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,750
But do you think it's fact you bill,

444
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,220
you completely do you completely buy into
the fact that she's a hundred years of

445
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:47,600
it?

446
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,280
So none of that's underneath while she's
so honest and open about what she felt

447
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:56,600
and why she felt it and why
she was conflicted and why
it didn't jive with what

448
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:59,330
she was reading in the Bible. It
didn't make sense to her. Right. And,

449
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,800
and the way he was doing it,

450
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:04,490
which she was realizing was
not how Christians did it
all over the world. Right.

451
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:06,860
And that this, this, you know,

452
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,490
this desire to constantly
get attention in the news.

453
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,770
Even at soldier's funerals,

454
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,040
they would go to soldier's funerals
and say that these soldiers are dying

455
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:19,400
because gay people are getting married.
Like what they were saying,

456
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:22,220
they deserve to die. They deserve to
be dead. I mean that kind of, you know,

457
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,910
but I'm telling you from that she's like
the nicest person you'd ever want to

458
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:29,830
meet. So she up in and regulation in
her world, she realizes it was bullshit.

459
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,410
She was tricked and you know,
she's done a great job to free herself.

460
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:37,940
But when you indoctrinate
someone heavily into anything,

461
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:42,941
and this is whether it's being a religious
zealot or being a political salad,

462
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,960
you indoctrinate someone when they're
early in their, their, their youth,

463
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,750
a formidable years. Very difficult for
them to get out of it. It takes real work.

464
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,830
But that's what I mean. I that's right.
I guess I'm saying it sticks with you,

465
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:58,670
right? Like my whole thing is there's
things instilled in me from my youth,

466
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,510
from where I grew up culturally and
how I grew up that even though I'm more

467
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:07,400
learned now, I still do understand
those ways of thinking. Right?

468
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:09,470
So it is hard to break
away from those things.

469
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:13,190
Even though like when you just said the
whole like w a woman's right to choose,

470
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:15,620
right? Like I grew up in the
Midwest, I grew up Catholic.

471
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,800
This is how I am most of my family is
for so in so many words against abortion,

472
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,050
uh, but I don't think these things are
mutually exclusive that you can be against

473
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:28,490
abortion and against
women's rights to choose.

474
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,830
You can say that you don't like abortion,

475
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,100
but also say I'm not going to
control what you do with your body.

476
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,760
It's kind of how I feel. I don't love
the idea of abortion. I'm being honest.

477
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:38,690
I just,
I just don't love it.

478
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,740
But I do think I'm not going to stand
here and tell people what to do,

479
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,280
but I should be able to still say

480
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,880
I don't like it. I don't think it's, I
don't think it's a healthy thing to do.

481
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,050
I don't really enjoy,

482
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,670
I don't enjoy like the spreading of it
being kind of this not a big deal thing.

483
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,070
But I do think people can do
whatever they fucking want to do.

484
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:00,540
But I'm also allowed to go. Uh, I
don't, I don't, I don't love the idea.

485
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,640
Like I don't like it. Uh, just as
an option. I just don't love it.

486
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:10,080
I don't love it. Birth
control is obviously the
best method. Yeah, of course.

487
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:13,260
And I think women should be more aware,
but women, when they take birth control,

488
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:14,370
man,
they have to,

489
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,630
I'm not not advocating for abortion
as a method of birth control,

490
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:20,970
but what I'm saying is when
women take birth control pills,

491
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,090
that shit fucks with them. The fuck's
with their horse, not a good thing.

492
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,350
It's not good. And that, I know. And,
and when they do it in, they also smoke.

493
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,370
They can cause like real
complications. It can, it's a lot.

494
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:35,640
I mean there's a lot of women have really
bad reactions to the pill changes your

495
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:38,850
behavior, suicidal tendencies. I, I've
heard a lot of like really bad stories.

496
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:41,760
Now I'm also saying if we want to look
at it from a different perspective,

497
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,270
men should also take way more
fucking responsibility then like,

498
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:46,810
this is the other side is this,

499
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,790
this argument tends to land on women a
lot where it's like you don't tell me how

500
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:53,550
to fucking, you don't tell a woman
what to do with the body is like, okay,

501
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:56,400
that's fine. I'm just saying
how I don't like it. Also,

502
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:00,960
I don't like guys nutting in women and
fucking ghosting and not wanting to raise

503
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:01,980
a child.
Right?

504
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,730
So I think the other side of it is two
parties here should be responsible.

505
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:07,500
Men should take some
fucking responsibility over,

506
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,010
stop common inside of these fucking
people. If you're not ready to have kids,

507
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,730
I'm just being real. It's like
either wear a condom or stop, stop,

508
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:19,170
stop doing the thing that you know,
makes children. So, you know, but again,

509
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,900
this is this weird balance of,
like I say, I come from this

510
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:28,230
and I am not conservative, but like this
real Catholic upbringing in the Midwest,

511
00:28:28,231 --> 00:28:28,451
you know,

512
00:28:28,451 --> 00:28:32,940
a good old Irish Catholic boy and the
ideas that you hear as a kid all the time,

513
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,130
you then grow and I now go,

514
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,260
I think people should be able
to do whatever they want to do.

515
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:39,110
I'm not going to fucking control somebody.
Mm.

516
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,360
But I still have those little moments
of, yeah. I just don't love it though,

517
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,500
because it was something
that was instilled in me as
a youth, you know? I mean,

518
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:50,280
it's the same way for years. I felt
guilty smoking pot because that was like,

519
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,530
I've been smoking pot for 20 years,

520
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,800
but I felt guilty for a long time cause
my pa because drugs were so bad. Yeah.

521
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,830
It was just like this over. And even
today, sometimes I get high and I go,

522
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,940
should I be getting high today?
Do I have shit to do? Do I, am I,

523
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,480
am I doing something wrong? No, no. I'm
a grownup. I have all my shit together.

524
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,230
I sure
I'm allowed to get high.

525
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,630
You're one of the few comedian friends
that I know that has their shit together.

526
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:18,570
You're grown up trying to just stay,
stay having my shit together.

527
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,010
You can just tear your shit. It's a
hard task though, right? It's not easy.

528
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,500
Especially for immature dip
shits like us. Yeah, it's,

529
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,100
we're not suppose this isn't supposed
to have. Nikki Glaser had a funny,

530
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,250
she was on stage two and a bit and she
just had said this phrase and I kept

531
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:34,890
talking to her about it afterwards. She
was like, we don't deserve this money.

532
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,620
And I was like, what do you mean we don't
fucking, and we just, and she's like,

533
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,250
we just don't deserve this much
money for being so immature.

534
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,230
I was like,
I guess that's Kinda true.

535
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:48,940
Like we get to be clowny kids and still
make a good living. Meanwhile, the guy,

536
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,430
there's a guy who's an electrician
at my house the other day,

537
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,280
the shit he was telling me I couldn't
fucking keep, I mean he sounded,

538
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:57,430
he was speaking fucking another
language and I had no, I was, he's like,

539
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:59,230
all you have to have another ground.
Cause the neutrals are different.

540
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,850
How this is a two wire system back
in 1946, you got to have three weeks.

541
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,590
It's going on and on and on and on.
I was like, you deserve more money.

542
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:11,200
Like you're worth more money. I don't
know why I have more money than you do.

543
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:12,640
You do much more important shit.

544
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,610
It's all about with our guest with
money, right? It's all about reach.

545
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:21,540
You know what we were talking
about earlier today about
how much money Facebook

546
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:25,590
and Google and all these people make from
ads and how weird it is that like you

547
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:30,250
look for something, then instantly
those ads start popping up constantly.

548
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,780
I am referencing Sam Harris's podcast
again. I don't remember which one it was.

549
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:38,460
It was fairly recently. He had a
guest on and they talked about the,

550
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,420
uh, the, the commodity
of your data, right?

551
00:30:42,421 --> 00:30:46,410
The commodity of your searches and
who's selling that and how they're,

552
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,730
how they're profiting off of that and
that this was like this commodity that

553
00:30:50,731 --> 00:30:54,510
nobody thought they were giving up. Then
nobody thought there was anything to it.

554
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:54,680
Right?

555
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,650
Then these companies have found this
loophole and have made billions of dollars

556
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,710
through it by giving you free email,

557
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:06,390
by giving you a free web browser,
right? By giving you free searches,

558
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,510
basically providing you with all
the information in the world, right?

559
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,540
What they want from you is want
to know what you're interested in.

560
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,490
That's all there'll be.

561
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,630
It's kind of like the real
world example would be, uh,

562
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,280
those trash companies that are like,

563
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,270
you have a garage full of shit will
come pick it up for free. Right?

564
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,370
You don't know what's in that fucking
garage. Some people are so old,

565
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,870
they just throw shit out and they go, ah,
I just get rid of it. Fuck it. You know,

566
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,840
you know those storage wars shows,
I guess they fake. Yeah, they do.

567
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:34,060
They set them up. They
load up the, the storage.

568
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,160
We believe we found a world
war two helmet. It's Elvis.

569
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:41,320
His underwear was unbelievable.
Yeah, they used to be real.

570
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:43,430
Actually a few of them were very
real and then they are very,

571
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,430
then they got caught online.
A bunch of people online,

572
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:48,190
we're calling them out being like,
this is bullshit. This is fake.

573
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:51,900
I saw them setting it up like they
got, they got caught. But that's,

574
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:56,010
they're going to do that. They should
find magic in there and say this is fine.

575
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:01,330
Should definitely shit storage wars
where they go in there and they find a

576
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,740
Leprechaun. The gap around
makes you disappear. Yeah.

577
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:09,310
One person disappears and they have a
genie in a lamp and that's gotta be worth

578
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:12,910
treating me like I'm really stupid. Have
you ever watched the show ghost hunters?

579
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,080
Do you know who it goes to? The
ventures. Do you know this Guy Zach bag?

580
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,890
Zak bagans. Do you know this guy? I
do not know him personally. Oh Man.

581
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:25,600
He makes me laugh so fucking hard because
they've done like nine seasons now.

582
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,180
I don't even know how many they
found any ghosts come out, man.

583
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:33,010
They have all this great technology
now that you think that he believes in

584
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:37,300
ghosts. Here's the best part.
Okay. He is all in, right?

585
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,830
I love anybody that's all in
whatever they're doing to have to be.

586
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,870
The host is all his adventure,

587
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:46,930
but also now he's super self aware of
their popularity and of his character

588
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,270
caricature of himself.
So he does it now on purpose.

589
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,550
He took off his shirt
when episode and he goes,

590
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,150
you want to fucking fight me ghost?
Let's fucking go to tow up.

591
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,160
Throw a fucking punch.
You're like,

592
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,830
he's aware of his character that
is this broey ghost fist fighter.

593
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,810
This dude is Brennan shop and shop.
That was on episode. Look at him.

594
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:14,990
He looks like he just got along from
Shane Carwood sparring sessions. Yeah,

595
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:18,500
he's still in the fight. He's still
out of it. And so this is Zach is what?

596
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:21,170
The beard? No, Zack is that dude
right there, right? So Zack,

597
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,310
where's Ed hardy type of shirts,
right? He wears these loud,

598
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,360
ridiculous, he patterned shirts, but he's,

599
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,640
you got to see it do with
more newer episode produce,

600
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,730
do something from like 2009 to 18.
You'll see what he looks like now.

601
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:39,110
He's gotten way more fucking jacked. His
hair, his hair is all flaked up. You know,

602
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,060
he's gotten like more tan around and shit.

603
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,300
He's become,

604
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,810
do you think this becomes super self
aware that he believes in ghosts? No,

605
00:33:47,811 --> 00:33:50,630
I think he's just self aware of
the product he's created really,

606
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,970
that he understands
now that's a challenge.

607
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,440
I see the next whiskey ginger
podcast, me and Zack, Zack, Zack,

608
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,210
that's him right there, right?
Like now he's like, Holly, what?

609
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:03,020
He looks like a Hollywood guy. He's
got these big black frame glass. Funny.

610
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:05,490
Like you can't, he can't
look any better. You know,

611
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,570
you're not allowing him to have
better style like that when Hollywood,

612
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:13,910
you're so Chicago, it's fucking good as
fucking Hollywood flog this spiky hair.

613
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,860
He went Hollywood the fall.
I'll tell you.

614
00:34:15,861 --> 00:34:19,250
That's the one thing I know I
won't do is uh, like I'll never,

615
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,300
I'll never get to a place when I'll be
wearing clothes where I used to make fun

616
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:25,310
of them like that.
Like I remember going,

617
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:29,480
sky's wearing a fucking $900 tee shirt.

618
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:34,370
I know now I can't do that.
Like I can't, I can't get,

619
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,100
I can't do that now cause I used
to shit on it so much. Yeah.

620
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:40,520
You have to mind by the
rules of your own mall. If I,

621
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:44,150
if I pushed it out there for so long,
let's say he's got a nice hats him. Yeah,

622
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:44,640
it looks good.

623
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,900
I has had Jamie that your buddy and say
the breath recent photo I could find.

624
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:50,780
Jamie, do I zoom in real quick? I
thought you were trying to say something.

625
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,450
Is he handsome fellow? Cute Guy. Jamie,

626
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:56,090
I want you to grow your facial hair
just like that. You really think,

627
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,400
do you really think he
doesn't believe in ghosts?

628
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,350
I think he does not believe in ghosts.
I think he,

629
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:04,130
I think he loves the paranormal, right?
He loves the idea of the paranormal.

630
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,440
I think he loves the idea of forces
that nature happening. Molecules,

631
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,980
energies around us, all
influencing the way we act. Sure.

632
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,670
I don't think he believes in actual
apparitions or what do they do?

633
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,110
They call him s uh, uh, spirits
on his EVP. We felt the spirit,

634
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,900
they'll do this thing where they'll
see a little orb or a light.

635
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:27,860
This happens all the time with cameras
when you switch to night vision and not

636
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,190
these little deaf flecks of dusk
kind of reflect light off the lenses.

637
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:35,060
And he'll go, what's an orb? And
they'll watch it float through the Lens.

638
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,160
And he's a, he is obsessed about
these orbs. They enter the orb

639
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,060
and he does this voiceover shit. He
got lots of fucking jail. I get hired,

640
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:44,670
I watch it. It's maybe one of my
favorite things. What's the, Jamie,

641
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:46,970
you're a photographer. What's the, um,

642
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:51,150
scientific explanation for those little
balls that show up in photographs?

643
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,650
What is it?

644
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,750
Um,
I don't have the knowledge for that,

645
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,630
but it can be explained in lots
of different ways. It's mostly,

646
00:35:56,631 --> 00:36:01,430
it probably like a light flare
of some kind just because there's

647
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,750
just like in this dose you
stammered through that. So bad,

648
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,860
terrible fucking joke. Tography
science. But like in this lens here,

649
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:12,870
there's like five
different pieces of glass.

650
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,390
So there's just at whatever
angle you're holding it,

651
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:17,170
depending on where the light
source is coming from, right.

652
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,410
It might create an artifact,

653
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:24,411
which would be a little circle if you're
dealing with a really nice camera like

654
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:25,261
that one.

655
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:30,120
But what about like with one of them
bullshit zipping and shoot ones,

656
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,180
then they're using that

657
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,620
less, uh, just why there would be some
on that. It's probably because it's less,

658
00:36:38,621 --> 00:36:41,740
it's less good. It's, it's
has less, not the right word,

659
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:46,270
but a less technology in
there. I don't know. I don't,
I can't explain it honestly.

660
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,670
Well, wines, we should Google it because,
or Glover's right now are freaking out.

661
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,920
Oh my God,
they are angels there in front of you.

662
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,410
Anytime in or passes near a human,

663
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,850
he'll go watch chose reaction as
the orb goes behind his hand. Yeah.

664
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,650
And you change your eyes or your
thighs will change. It was amazing.

665
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:08,910
You don't believe in fucking ghost.
I believe in every,

666
00:37:08,911 --> 00:37:12,550
you don't believe in guns
all in with everything locked
that foot back scattered.

667
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:17,030
Here you go back scatter,
back scatter.

668
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,020
The artifact can result from
the backscatter or retro
reflection of light from

669
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:26,820
airborne solid particles such as dust or
part, but I sell it. Or liquid droplets,

670
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,930
especially rain or mist can also be
caused by foreign material within the

671
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:34,740
camera's Lens. So these dots are
blurred images of dust particles.

672
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,530
M night Shambhala,
Ding Dong should make a movie

673
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,780
in that movie and it should be called
backscatter. Call him that anymore.

674
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,280
That's really rude. Is it though?
It's kind of funny. It's Sean Milan.

675
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,850
That's his fucking [inaudible].
I'm [inaudible].

676
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:54,300
You turn on the day you started it. You
fucking put it on me. What are you racist?

677
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:57,320
What's wrong with you man? He makes
them good God damn movies, the guy,

678
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,500
he takes some crazy risks. But uh, I love
the sixth sense. That was a great fuck.

679
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:04,290
Come on. Every, I love the village.
People didn't like that and see,

680
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,490
I thought the bill was the end of it. I
was like, where, what about planes? They,

681
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,550
they, they don't, they don't
show any planes going over.

682
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,550
It would have to be to
avoid all the planes.

683
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,990
Well they have to be in a shepherd plain
to places where no planes flying remote

684
00:38:18,991 --> 00:38:21,900
cause they made it out so the road and
then instantly the guy to the road and

685
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:23,730
people are like, Hey, I like what

686
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:28,900
they're like Saint Louis. It's like right
there. You know what I liked though?

687
00:38:28,901 --> 00:38:33,460
His ghost. No Devil. The one was in the
elevator. That was a good one. Yeah,

688
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:36,370
it was good. That was good. That's
good. Well he takes chances.

689
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,260
He takes a shower like,
hey wait, that's this.

690
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,740
This reminds me of you tell when you talk
about that island, that private island,

691
00:38:42,741 --> 00:38:43,780
do you know, sent in a lot, sent,

692
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:48,340
sent or sensible or central island
planes still fly over that or no.

693
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,680
Are they not allowed to sign
it as a restricted airspace?

694
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,570
I don't think it's restricted.
No,

695
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,440
but you can't land there
and you can't circle. Right.

696
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,320
You can't visit India owns it,
right?

697
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:02,890
Doesn't the co it doesn't India control
of leaves and it's like 10 mile radius.

698
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,160
I saw a thing online that said a boat
crash there and you could still see on

699
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:07,630
Google images the remnants of the boat.
Yeah.

700
00:39:07,631 --> 00:39:09,250
They came for the people in the boat too.

701
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:11,050
And the helicopters got them off the boat.

702
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,950
Right as the people were like pulling up
and I'll say they live and shit. Yeah.

703
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:19,360
Fuck yeah, they, they live. But those, the
villages were common for them. Oh yeah.

704
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,440
Can you imagine stepping across a village
they've been fucked with sometime in

705
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:28,210
the past? You know that a commander
Maurice Avi, Dow Portman. Yeah. Guy. Yeah.

706
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:33,670
Shout out to a respectable
law on, uh, Twitter.

707
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,710
He has a, a, a giant thread about it.

708
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:41,590
It may be pinned on the top of
his Twitter page, but explaining,

709
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:45,340
uh, like one of the reasons why
those people are so hostile. Right.

710
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:50,210
And it has to do with this British
explorer who was really kinky and, uh,

711
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:54,010
you went there to fuck. Who knows, we
want to fuck island. He was what he did.

712
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:58,560
But people got sick because you know this,
I had this Guy Graham Hancock on yeah.

713
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:01,440
And he was talking to me about, um, uh,

714
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:05,650
all the different shit that they're
finding in the Amazon and in South America

715
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:09,460
and that they used to be 20 million people
that live in the Amazon and they died

716
00:40:09,461 --> 00:40:12,590
off because of sickness.
They were visited mostly,

717
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,550
apparently Europeans when they
came in like the 15 hundreds,

718
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,270
they would tell these incredible stories
about these huge civilizations in the

719
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:22,690
Amazon. But then when explorers
came back 200 years later,

720
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:26,770
there was nothing there. And they were
like, this is crazy. They, they lied.

721
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,140
They must allied.
But it turns out they didn't lie.

722
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:33,370
What happened was smallpox ran through
the fucking jungle and white people,

723
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,310
everybody, we did it. And then these,

724
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:40,390
the jungle just overtook the cities and
now they're finding these cities with

725
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:41,620
something called Lidar.

726
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:45,460
They use these planes and they circle
over this area or helicopters or whatever

727
00:40:45,461 --> 00:40:48,670
the fuck they do.
And they shoot this shit down this lidar.

728
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:53,970
It's like laser radar and it gives you
a detailed image of what's below the

729
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:57,970
surface and what's their shit. And it
shows them all these crazy structures,

730
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,350
all these like,
uh,

731
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:04,380
like roadways and irrigation systems
and circles inside of a square.

732
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,080
Like it was villages and cities and the
millions of people probably live there.

733
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:11,230
Look at it. That's all the stuff
they're finding that, yeah.

734
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,330
And all of it was
swallowed up by the jungle.

735
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,540
They think within like a hundred
years just vanished in the jungle. Oh,

736
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,530
because it's so, so lush and
tropical down there. Dude,

737
00:41:20,531 --> 00:41:25,531
it was one of the most amazing podcast
I've ever done to listening to that guy.

738
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,770
Tell this story right after this
one though. Now you are the best.

739
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,100
You're the best. This is kind of, well,
this is like a, this is like the findings

740
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,720
of Atlantis, right? Like
when they started finding,

741
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,300
you started finding more and
more land under Christine, this,

742
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:43,301
they found traces of five drugs including
dimethyltryptamine on a thousand year

743
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:47,930
old South American ritual, key empty
baby. That's like proof positive,

744
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:49,523
um,

745
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:54,800
evidence that it at least 1000
years ago they were using Iowasca.

746
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,630
Wow. This was the drug pouch
that was made from Fox snouts.

747
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,810
That's so crazy. It
literally, when you see it,

748
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:06,890
it looks like they used
everything and the first crazy,

749
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:10,850
it looks really nice and knows.
I wonder why they do that with a Fox.

750
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:15,230
It's probably like some
cleverness something though
that that's what a showman,

751
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,660
that's like literally what
a shaman is supposed to.

752
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:21,140
That's what the definition is
supposed to be in certain cultures,

753
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:26,240
certain cultures. It's a clever fellow.
That's who the sh the shaman is. Okay.

754
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:27,980
I kind of make sense.
They are just clever fellows,

755
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:31,040
but I mean imagine that like he takes
a Fox, that clever little fucker.

756
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,520
I'm going to take his face.
I want wanted fucking drugs in his face.

757
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,550
Only a person would think to do something.

758
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:42,020
So great trucks and this
chipmunk cheeks. Yeah, right.

759
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,550
That would be the good little,
yeah.

760
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,270
The little pouch sugar pouches
that hangs for your belt.

761
00:42:46,271 --> 00:42:50,730
It's just chip Monck sheets with
all your coins in it. The dump.

762
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:52,610
What about the dumbest animal?
You could have stuff ed.

763
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,100
What would be the worst animal
to put stuff in it? Gunks skunks.

764
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,280
Raccoons or raccoons are
actually kind of smart, you know?

765
00:42:58,281 --> 00:43:02,330
Do you know skunks are predators? This
little creeps? They are, yeah. Yeah, Bro.

766
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:05,590
They were coming from a chicken's, Oh
yeah. They try to eat your chickens.

767
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,870
You want to kill your chickens? They skunk
up the for this spray him and shit. No,

768
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,170
they're just there to kill the [inaudible]
only spray things when things come

769
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:15,140
near them. When they're or when they're
about to die. Right. That's like the,

770
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,440
when they think they're going to
die, they just admit that. Yeah.

771
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,460
That's like so many animals
are able to do that.

772
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,190
We're like one of the only species that
doesn't know how to fake death to have

773
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:23,750
to avoid actually dying.
Right.

774
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:27,230
A lot of species we'll hide or change
colors or shapes and we're a mid something

775
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,980
to give the other species, the, the, the,

776
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,930
the thought that they are dead or
deceased or that they've, you know,

777
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:34,940
they're gone. We don't do, we
don't, we are the only ones.

778
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:36,470
Don't know if you're
running away from a fight,

779
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:39,450
you can't just pretend to be dead
and then they'll stop fucking, you

780
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,200
still gonna fuck you up. Well, human
beings, well I think humans and chimps to,

781
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,190
they want retribution. He want
revenge. We love vengeance, man.

782
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,660
That's like our favorite
thing in the world.

783
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,140
A guy almost fucking hit me four times
today. I wish I got his license plate.

784
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:57,500
I called them out on here and he was
cutting me off and he kept trying to hit

785
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:02,501
like hit my car after he cut me off in
a big like f three 50 truck and then I

786
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:06,260
gave him one of these fucking Hawk like,
dude, I mean just miss my car, you know?

787
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,690
Then I move on.
Well he pulls over next to me,

788
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,190
gives me the finger and then tries to like
pulling my fucking lane like he's, he,

789
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:16,370
if he's going to hit my car out
of his, I was like, it's okay.

790
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,100
He just knows.
He just knows his car hits my car.

791
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,990
His car has barely any damage on it.
He knows a big f three 50 trucks.

792
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,650
His tires the size of my fucking car.
He was a dick, but he wanted shit.

793
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:31,070
So it's like now vindictively I
hope I see him again. Like now,

794
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,320
just want to fucking see him again
somewhere in the city. Just started.

795
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:37,500
Just this guy. I want to have
that moment with them again.

796
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:41,650
See Him outside of his fucking big truck.
That's funny. Yeah, we love, we like I,

797
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:45,610
I don't hold grudges.
Like Bobby Lee and I were talking about a,

798
00:44:45,611 --> 00:44:47,670
Bobby holds the biggest grudges on earth.
He some of the worst.

799
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:52,590
I mean he has like 20 year
grudges. Really? Oh my God.
Bobby Lee ask him about it.

800
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:57,360
He genuinely,
when someone does the wrong thing to him,

801
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,610
like I'm not talking
like makes a bad mistake.

802
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,220
When someone does something where
you're like, that's fucked up,

803
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,420
that can fuck up a friendship.

804
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:07,500
He will hold that against you for the
rest of time. That's it. That's it.

805
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:11,700
Where some people would go, whatever, man,
I forgive you. Shit happens. Nah, he's,

806
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:16,590
he holds a fucking grudge, dude.
Bad. That little tiny ball.

807
00:45:16,591 --> 00:45:21,000
Rice ball has a lot of fucking vengeance
inside of him. He's my little dump.

808
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:25,230
How dare you? I'm allowed to say that,
man. I'm allowed to say that because I uh,

809
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,950
because I used to own Bobbie. I
used to buy, bought him for a month.

810
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:34,290
How much did it cost? 65 grand.
That's a lot. Did you anything, any,

811
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,860
did you have to feed him?
He doesn't really require that much food.

812
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,080
Now when does he get to own you?
That's part of the deal, right?

813
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:42,450
He owns you for a month. 10
years later. 10 years later.

814
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:44,260
He owns you for a whole model
with me for a month. Yeah.

815
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:49,110
Then he's going to be stewing on it for
10 years. People really did do that.

816
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,520
If they just decide, okay, you
can own me for one month. Yeah,

817
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:55,650
and I'll do whatever the fuck you want,
but then I own you for one month.

818
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:59,520
10 years from now. That's a great
movie. By the way. This is a crazy deal.

819
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:02,970
It's [inaudible] alive.
Meanwhile, like nine years later,

820
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:07,580
that dude's just drank in and chain smoke
and try to kill him to kill us because

821
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,690
it was a flood of figures
slave for a month.

822
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,350
That'd be like indentured servitude,
right.

823
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,700
Mostly was people that were too poor
to make journeys are too poor to do

824
00:46:17,701 --> 00:46:18,001
something.

825
00:46:18,001 --> 00:46:22,500
So they would give up a certain amount
of like they would make a contract,

826
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:24,600
like they would work for someone
for a certain amount of time. Right.

827
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:27,120
That's essentially how we set up.
Yeah.

828
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,850
I mean that's basically what it is
basically saying like, but it's, yeah. Is,

829
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,760
it's like a slut. I mean, I guess the
condition is probably varied. You know,

830
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:38,460
one of the grossest ones
I ever saw was, um, uh,

831
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:43,410
vice did a piece about Dubai,
I believe it was, and about,

832
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,050
um, some people who are unscrupulous, uh,

833
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:52,130
construction people would take these
folks in from Third World countries and

834
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:54,900
promised them all this
money to work there.

835
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,770
And then they'd take their passports away
from them and then pay them a fraction

836
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,710
of what they're supposed to pay for
them so that they're trap and they were

837
00:47:01,711 --> 00:47:04,890
living in squalor, trapped. They
don't have their passport anymore.

838
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:07,620
Human trafficking is what it is.
I mean,

839
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:09,240
that's the same as when they
do to these young girls.

840
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,370
They had these girls come over to
the United States, you know, uh,

841
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,870
I think it was a documentary on Netflix
about these, like young Russian models,

842
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,350
right? And they give these goals modeling
contracts. They live in, uh, you know,

843
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:24,330
like a four bedroom apartment, two girls
to a room, right. And they essentially,

844
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:27,570
you know, fuck them around for a
little while with small little weird,

845
00:47:27,571 --> 00:47:30,640
maybe random gigs. And they're like,
hey, if you want to make more money,

846
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:34,840
you could always sell your
body or sell pictures of you.

847
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:38,440
Nude makes way more money and they
think it's kind of part of this modeling

848
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,800
thing, and this is like a content. I think
it was a d, I think it was on Netflix,

849
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,140
but it was all about these girls
getting trapped and they can't go back.

850
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:47,470
They don't have enough money. And this,
this modeling agencies, modeling agencies,

851
00:47:47,471 --> 00:47:50,230
these are these manager,
manager agencies there.

852
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,370
Well we have to keep your money and we'll
give you like a a salary so to speak.

853
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,940
We pay your rent, we'll give
you food. It's horrible. But

854
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:03,030
if it was dudes, I wouldn't care
at all. Yeah, of course. Of course.

855
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,051
It was true.

856
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:07,500
It was these five handsome guys came over
from Russia looking to get some pussy

857
00:48:07,501 --> 00:48:10,200
and drive Ferrari's,
but it wasn't really working out for them.

858
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:12,160
But like get a job, get a
job. It's switching gears.

859
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,410
Where the fuck did you
think was going to happen?

860
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,420
You're just going to get
pussy and Ferrari. Get outta
here bro. I'm good looking.

861
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:22,850
I thought this would make me make me say
I'm sorry I can't get you any modeling

862
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,870
gigs, but if you want to make some
money, fuck this old lady. Sup.

863
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:32,250
How much for two grand for me to fuck
that old lady. Okay, so all you gotta do.

864
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:36,910
Do I have to come or just hang with
her for awhile? She has to. She asked.

865
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,620
I have to work with Hotel Chicago.
Yeah. So you got to work with her. Okay.

866
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,470
You got to be a good act. No
eating pussy. I can't do that. Oh,

867
00:48:43,471 --> 00:48:45,990
you have to do to proceed.
I have two, three grand.

868
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,530
They don't even shave old
ladies. They gave up. Okay,

869
00:48:49,531 --> 00:48:53,900
so eat Harry Bush for two grand. I'll
do three grand. Three grand. [inaudible]

870
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:56,070
right.

871
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:59,040
How much sympathy would you have for
their watch to show Gigolos on showtime?

872
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:03,390
I didn't, but I know shop watched it.
I know Tom and Christina loved it.

873
00:49:03,391 --> 00:49:06,730
They talked about it a lot. Why is it
that shop right there on the right,

874
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:11,010
so they stick it ran its course.
It was on for like seven. No,

875
00:49:11,011 --> 00:49:15,170
it was not up for 60 g's.
Interviewed one of the guys that belief,

876
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:16,370
by the way,

877
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,760
every TV show I've done is only gone for
like two years, but Gigolos gets six.

878
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:26,540
That's the state of television. Jesus
Christ. That is crazy. That's a very,

879
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:30,080
that's a very good tell by the way.
There's like not a lot of these, these uh,

880
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:34,250
this whole like the culture of male
Gigolos I think they said percentage wise

881
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,020
it's like unbelievably smaller.

882
00:49:36,021 --> 00:49:39,740
These guys that get into the Gigolo world
and stay, they all get, they get in,

883
00:49:39,741 --> 00:49:42,020
they get out.
Most women that get into sex work,

884
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,990
La last significantly
longer than these dudes way,

885
00:49:44,991 --> 00:49:47,240
way long for very varied reasons.

886
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,140
But I think the Gigolo thing is kind of
like a moment in a man's life where he's

887
00:49:51,141 --> 00:49:55,730
like, I want to fucking try it some
young like fun, loving free for all.

888
00:49:55,731 --> 00:49:58,580
It's like open mind. I'll just give
it a world and he gets right out.

889
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:01,850
I don't think that happens for girls
at all. I think women stay in second.

890
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,920
Would you feel bad for some dude who
was working as a Gigolo in his pimp was

891
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:11,190
shook night and it's pimp
was making them go out there,

892
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:15,120
eat that pussy now to make that money.
It's the website for it.

893
00:50:15,121 --> 00:50:16,920
I just know on a website for it.
Yeah.

894
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,370
That's actually writes really
good poets or this guy.

895
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,870
What's going on within Vin Armani?

896
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,420
What's going on when he works
at the coffee shop around
the corner from my house.

897
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,940
Why is he wearing in Charlotte? Thought
that's just how it says. Look Dude,

898
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,670
Bradley, Lawrence, Nicole.
Hey man, I ain't hating.

899
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,900
If you could sling Dick and get paid,
good luck to you. Look, some people do it.

900
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:40,190
Some people out there working as a misuse
that do not like touching people. Okay.

901
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:44,030
Tell me how much that is. That's a bummer
though. How much different is that then?

902
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,530
Being able to be a guy on wear.

903
00:50:45,531 --> 00:50:47,480
Nice shirts like that and
occasionally got a bank broad.

904
00:50:47,481 --> 00:50:51,980
You don't want to wear nice
shirts, so horrible. Look,
you get some nice now. Fuck.

905
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,800
The world could be worse.
Do you remember Richard Gere?

906
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:57,730
Wasn't he a Gigolo in one of his movies?
Who is,

907
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:01,190
he didn't have a movie called Gigolo.
We'd like bang old ladies.

908
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,170
I don't know if it's called Gigolo,
but yeah,

909
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:07,790
he think it was called Gigolo
Gigolo. That's right. Boy,

910
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,990
you must have loved this shit. Yeah. You
know, she gives up their bag and ladies,

911
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,040
here's what they don't tell you.

912
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,790
Most of that money and that Gigolo
world is sucking Dick. Okay.

913
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:20,000
If you want to go out there and suck
that Dick, you can make that money.

914
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,770
But if you just want to bang old ladies,
ah, Whoa, look at the difference.

915
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:28,620
That's when he was young. That's when he
was how old you gotta be like 22, 23. Um,

916
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:33,340
he was pretty young and handsome and then
father Tom done fucking Molly wop him

917
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:35,900
all the time. Got Him. Marvin
Hagler on Thomas Hearns

918
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:38,660
third round.

919
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:44,020
I remember when he went on
stage in New York after nine 11.

920
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,550
Who did Richard Gere did and,
uh,

921
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:51,950
was trying to tell the audience that
they should choose love and that,

922
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,000
wait,
we're not state state where on stage she,

923
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:57,350
he was on stage at some sort of a
benefit. Oh, right. After nine 11.

924
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,760
It was right after nine 11. And he
was saying essentially that, you know,

925
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:03,810
great message.
She was,

926
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,100
at the time people were just blood
thirsty and they booed him. They're like,

927
00:52:07,101 --> 00:52:09,230
fuck you. What are you saying? Fuck you.

928
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,740
He's basically saying let's
not have military action.

929
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:16,250
More people shouldn't die because of
some things that these people did to us.

930
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:19,190
He's saying try to figure out a different
way to do this. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he's,

931
00:52:19,191 --> 00:52:21,980
he's, he's a Buddhist I believe.
I mean, he's really like,

932
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,940
he's really close pals with
the Dalai Lama. Yeah. But, but,

933
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,180
but in the interest of talking
about what we're talking about,

934
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:30,140
revenge means a lot.

935
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,600
It's Kinda hard to tell America to
not get revenge on somebody. Right.

936
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,270
We love revenge. Well, yeah. Well,

937
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,930
we love getting back people that have
tried to fuck with us. Even if we go,

938
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,470
even if we go way deeper than they did
were warlike monkeys. Yeah, we love it.

939
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:44,060
We we,
we when,

940
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:47,520
when we think we're being attacked
like retribution and revenge is,

941
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:50,630
well we're just talking about earlier
about like chimps. Chimps do that too.

942
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,380
Natural, it's nature, nature,
nature. You want to get revenge.

943
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:58,700
Motherfuckers like we were talking about
that guy and got ripped apart by the

944
00:52:58,701 --> 00:53:00,920
chimp rent to bring a birthday cake.
Dude.

945
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:03,080
See other chimps that did it
because they were jealous.

946
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:06,520
They were angry that that jealous
of getting this compassion.

947
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,430
You didn't get shit and someone fucked
up and left the gate open and they came

948
00:53:10,431 --> 00:53:11,990
out.
Fuck that dude up.

949
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:16,010
He ripped his limbs off toward his face
part just because he wouldn't give them,

950
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:19,520
didn't bring cake for them where
they female chimps now there a man,

951
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,540
where's my cake losing it?

952
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:28,020
Cake must be so must've been good ass
fucking cake to a chimp that doesn't

953
00:53:28,021 --> 00:53:30,930
understand what cake is like.
Hold the fuck dude, you do this.

954
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:33,270
But they do understand what cake is.
Wherever they understand it.

955
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:35,700
Once you get it to them, the gem.
Yeah. It's something, it's, it's,

956
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,000
that's like a powerful or be brought.
That's how you want more in Costa Rica.

957
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:43,170
And uh, there's, there's monkeys
everywhere. That's crazy.
Cool. Cool. Last monkeys,

958
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:46,080
but there are a little sketchy. I know.
I got married down there and oh, he did.

959
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,600
And Costa Rica. Yeah. Yeah. They're
out. They're out of their fucking mind.

960
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,000
We were hanging out with them and uh,

961
00:53:51,001 --> 00:53:53,970
there's a thing called a [inaudible]
Monday. You know what that is? No,

962
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,560
they look like a,

963
00:53:55,710 --> 00:54:00,120
like a raccoon monkey thing
to weird creature, a rocky.

964
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,050
And uh,
they would come up,

965
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:07,050
we were staying at this resort and they
would just come right down the pathway

966
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:11,220
to where your, uh, your door to your room
was and they'd just hang out with you.

967
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,730
Like these Quad Mondays just hang out
and you could feed them grapes and shed.

968
00:54:14,731 --> 00:54:18,420
They would take them right out of your
hands, but it like no danger at all.

969
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,250
They were like super chill and friendly.

970
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,470
So we gave this quantum
Monday some grapes,

971
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:27,650
and then he laid down and took a nap
under my chair. I just took a fucking nap,

972
00:54:27,651 --> 00:54:32,430
like a dog was a dog and like the most
chill dog of all time. I'm like, God damn,

973
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:34,980
these things are cool. Like we were
just sitting there. It just check, oh,

974
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:39,420
go ahead buddy. Tickets,
take a nap. You're safe here
again. Some grapes and shit.

975
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:41,720
People want it. Want chimps at their
house. People love the idea of,

976
00:54:41,721 --> 00:54:45,990
of having them. So the monkeys came over
and we only had a, that's what a quad,

977
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,210
a Monday. It looks like, dude,
they're the shit. There's,

978
00:54:48,211 --> 00:54:51,390
there's such cool little animals.
It does kind of look raccoon ish.

979
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,180
My daughters gave him a fake name, like
a, they were calling him a Kinkajou.

980
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,230
They just decided to call it a
Kinkajou. What's more fun? Yeah,

981
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,750
they could choose made their own word up,
I think.

982
00:55:00,751 --> 00:55:02,580
I don't think that's a real word.
Kalata Monday,

983
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:04,950
but that little that'll guy was so cool.

984
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:08,790
So she's an interesting little fella
when you just would gently take grapes

985
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:12,510
right out of your hand gently,
right the most chill dog of all time.

986
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,640
So anyway, we were out of grapes and
these a monkey showed up and they're,

987
00:55:17,641 --> 00:55:20,130
they're like hanging out, like
looking like, what do you got for us?

988
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,310
These guys are hungry.
No real monkey that's on a monkey.

989
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:26,940
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what a cold water Monday is.

990
00:55:26,941 --> 00:55:30,700
What family is, what is that?
Anyway, we gave these, uh, my killer,

991
00:55:30,701 --> 00:55:33,360
like I don't know if we should
give these monkeys, these Oreos.

992
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:36,170
It's Kinda fucked up. Like it's not
good for them. I'm going to look at,

993
00:55:36,171 --> 00:55:38,480
one of them only had one hand. I'm like,
well that's not good for him either.

994
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:43,410
The fucking handbid off. So
I gave him, gave him that,

995
00:55:43,411 --> 00:55:47,820
he snatched it from me and he opened it
up and then started chewing the white

996
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:51,870
stuff like the cream. He's one of us, but
he already knew about it, knew to like,

997
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:56,400
he's probably getting Oreos for his whole
life time from people that stay at the

998
00:55:56,401 --> 00:56:01,190
resort. He knows the trek. Did he? I mean
he knew what the fuck to do. I'll do it.

999
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,950
Well they make you at this, you
know, they're all open air houses.

1000
00:56:04,951 --> 00:56:05,731
You rent on the beach,

1001
00:56:05,731 --> 00:56:07,800
you know that everything's pretty open
except for the bedroom is the only thing

1002
00:56:07,801 --> 00:56:10,860
that's closed off.
And they had latched locks,

1003
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:15,600
padlocks on the refrigerator. And I was
like, what are you guys lock that up?

1004
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:17,940
And they're like, the monkeys know
how to get into all that shit.

1005
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:21,420
They know how to open the door and they
know how to get into drawers. He's like,

1006
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:24,070
dude, they knew how to, they
know how to open up egg cartons.

1007
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,150
They know how to open the lid and take
eggs and close the lid. I'm not kidding.

1008
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:30,880
He's like, they're that smart.
So in the middle of the night,

1009
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:32,140
the first night that we were there,

1010
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,970
I hear the gate kind of rustling and
then I hear movement and I'm like,

1011
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,150
someone's in the fucking house cause
it's on the beach. It's wide open.

1012
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,090
So of course I like grabbed something
is the biggest thing I could find.

1013
00:56:43,091 --> 00:56:45,130
Nice man. I'm out there. I'm
like, Hey, hey, you know,

1014
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:48,340
like a nut bag and my fucking arm,
um, yelling. Of course I look it,

1015
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:51,490
they're just monkeys. Chillen trying
to like get shit in the house.

1016
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,790
They're trying to find shit laying
around food, drinks, whatever it was.

1017
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,510
And of course I go back to bed and every
night I would hear them come and go,

1018
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,220
but you'd hear them try the refrigerator.

1019
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:03,520
They would hear him pulling on
it to see if the latch was like,

1020
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:06,410
if we left it unlocked. They're
smart, they learn, they learn,

1021
00:57:06,411 --> 00:57:09,310
they learn all the little tricks
of where you put stuff. Cabinets.

1022
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:12,040
I could hear a cabinet is opening and
closing. Yeah, they were smart man.

1023
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:16,150
That's so weird. It's like a little
person. It is a little sneaky,

1024
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,820
but yet it was a little person.
He fuck use it. And they,

1025
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,510
and they put purposely up in
this place that I was at, um,

1026
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:25,510
they'd purposely string wire
from house to house to house.

1027
00:57:25,511 --> 00:57:29,920
So the monkeys kind of had freedom to go
up above because if they would go down

1028
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:33,070
by the road, it would cause more traffic
and disturbances and all that stuff.

1029
00:57:33,071 --> 00:57:34,540
So they keep them up in the canopy.

1030
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:38,680
They put rope purposely house to house
and tree to tree that humans put up.

1031
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:42,040
So they have easier pathways to get
down to the water because they say when

1032
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,470
they're down on the ground, it's
more distracting. There's, you know,

1033
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,950
it's a lot harder to drive. They,
they create little messes down below.

1034
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,610
So if they keep them up high, it's
better for them. It was crazy man.

1035
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:56,110
What a wild little creature that can swing
from tree to tree and they fly up and

1036
00:57:56,111 --> 00:57:59,530
down the tree tops like that.
There is a guy from shit,

1037
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,370
just one most like people
sometimes I'd see one just hanging.

1038
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:05,950
It'd be staring right at you, but
they're almost like people. They're so,

1039
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:10,720
they're the right fucking there. Well
the weird, the weirdest thing is that if,

1040
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:14,890
if evolution is happening all the time,
looking at this little monkey junk,

1041
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:18,370
is this in breaking into a house? Yeah.
Watch, watch this. Watch how smart. Look,

1042
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:21,070
he'll give me those chips. I love
these fucking chips. I love that.

1043
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,700
It looks like he's looking right at
the person too. Yeah, he is. Oh Wow.

1044
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:28,750
And he just takes off with the chips.
Do they know which ones they eat them?

1045
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,210
They know which ones they like.
Just be nice to them.

1046
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:33,070
What happens if you feed them?
You can't know.

1047
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:36,010
They tell you not to feed them because
well then they know to keep coming back

1048
00:58:36,011 --> 00:58:39,880
and where they can get food for like
monkeys now they say at the end of you and

1049
00:58:39,881 --> 00:58:41,770
they say, if you don't, if you
swing, you stop feeding them.

1050
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:43,930
After you fed them enough,
then they start to get aggressive.

1051
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:46,720
So then you shoot one and he said,
tell him, send a message. Right?

1052
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:50,020
And then they all come back and kill
you out of fucking 12 gauge and you blow

1053
00:58:50,021 --> 00:58:53,470
the little face off one of those clients
and you make your drug and you go, hey,

1054
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:57,450
you guys want free food. You'll get
it. But you get it on my terms. Mcgee,

1055
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:01,180
go back inside. You just described
a plot for a planet of the apes.

1056
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:04,120
It's literally like the plot for
planning. You get them hooked. Yeah.

1057
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:06,790
You Bait that I'm hooked on
food. Yeah. You Bait them.

1058
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:09,730
There's a lot of places
like that. Um, we're, we're,

1059
00:59:09,731 --> 00:59:11,440
animals are dependent on people.

1060
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:15,070
They were dependent on people to feed
them and it's a, it's a little squirrely.

1061
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,540
Like whoa.
There's a place in,

1062
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:21,580
I think it's Jamaica where
people swim with wild pigs. No,

1063
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:22,430
Wild

1064
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,310
Bahamas,
Bahamas.

1065
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:28,730
Now wild pigs generally avoid people they
don't want to have anything to do with

1066
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:32,180
you and they're dangerous. Sketchy.
Yeah. Wild boars are nuts. Yeah.

1067
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,750
But in this place, people have been
feeding these things for so long.

1068
00:59:35,751 --> 00:59:39,140
They have trips like tourist
trips where people fly in,

1069
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:41,780
feed these pigs and swim around with them.
Pig Island,

1070
00:59:41,781 --> 00:59:44,900
they got wild pigs that are
constantly being fed by people.

1071
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:49,280
But a friend of a friend went there
and someone they were with got bit.

1072
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:52,730
Oh yeah, I've heard they put them
in the ass a bit. One of the,

1073
00:59:52,731 --> 00:59:54,260
one of the pigs bit them in the ass.

1074
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,210
And it was because they didn't have
any food or something like that.

1075
00:59:56,211 --> 00:59:57,610
They didn't offer him anything.

1076
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,330
He have to keep feeding them
throughout the whole thing.

1077
00:59:59,331 --> 01:00:00,710
It tells you all about it that they,

1078
01:00:00,711 --> 01:00:04,610
that they get really ornery and they
get really annoyed. Fuck you. Fuck you.

1079
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,990
Fuck you just drown it. Just put it right
under non bro. Those they're strong now.

1080
01:00:08,991 --> 01:00:11,150
They are. You can't fuck with
those sentences. The animal,

1081
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,670
because they're beautiful and they're
sweet and the like pigs are there are

1082
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,120
weird one and it was there. Look
as cool. Look, I'm a dog lover.

1083
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:21,080
I love dogs.

1084
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:25,550
Pigs are almost like a dog and
maybe smarter close their Pr.

1085
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,810
The probably definitely smarter,

1086
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,650
but they liked the way that we
react to people and it, look,

1087
01:00:29,651 --> 01:00:31,970
if you feed them and you're their friend,
you become their buddy,

1088
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:36,110
but are you against eating them?
No, but also looks I've killed them.

1089
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,610
I know that kills wild ones,

1090
01:00:37,611 --> 01:00:41,690
but wild ones are different men because
they're out there hustling. Okay.

1091
01:00:41,691 --> 01:00:42,230
They don't,

1092
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:46,190
they're not in this fucking pen getting
slop all day trying to fatten them up.

1093
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,470
Right. It's hard to get fat
out there. They're out there.

1094
01:00:48,471 --> 01:00:51,350
How much more lean meat out there.
They're much leaner,

1095
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:52,970
but they're also vicious man.

1096
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,340
They're v the getting rid
to grow these giant tusks,

1097
01:00:55,341 --> 01:00:56,840
they have these big fucking fangs.

1098
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:01,550
And the crazy thing is there's the
same species as a domestic pig, right?

1099
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:02,450
It's the same animal.

1100
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:05,330
Just once one's one's pampered
and one's not exactly bring up.

1101
01:01:05,331 --> 01:01:08,540
Have you ever seen Havoline Aleena's do
you know what [inaudible] are in Arizona?

1102
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:11,770
Peccary well, when I saw that
it looks just like a pig. Yeah,

1103
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:15,350
that was when I first, when I first moved
to Arizona, I saw one and I was like, oh,

1104
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:18,140
what the fuck is that thing? And my buddy
was like, no, no, no, don't cut it. They,

1105
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:19,220
they'll come right at yet.

1106
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:22,610
They will fucking go for your legs bad
because they're real low to the ground.

1107
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,490
But he's like, they'll start spearing
you and they'll come at your legs.

1108
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:28,910
And one time I was valeting in college
and when I was up way in the up in the

1109
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:32,180
mountain and it's some dudes, you know,
some private, huge private residence.

1110
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,200
And there with packs,

1111
01:01:33,201 --> 01:01:36,050
I mean packs of them and I could hear
them rustling around and they were like

1112
01:01:36,051 --> 01:01:37,840
positioning themselves because I was,

1113
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,580
we were parking cars where they
were living and I was like,

1114
01:01:40,581 --> 01:01:41,540
we can't park cars up there.

1115
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,420
You can tell they started
to get aggressive in jumping
and diving at the cars.

1116
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:47,030
Yeah, they were getting fucking
annoyed, man. They didn't. I was like,

1117
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:47,781
we can't go back up there.

1118
01:01:47,781 --> 01:01:49,810
We're going to get fucked up by these
little bullshit pigs. You don't,

1119
01:01:49,811 --> 01:01:52,910
we're Stan hope lives out in Bisbee,
which is real close to the border.

1120
01:01:52,911 --> 01:01:54,470
They have them all over the
place. Yeah, they're everywhere.

1121
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,650
They killed one of his friend's dog.
They do kill dog. They, well they,

1122
01:01:57,651 --> 01:01:59,030
they're known to kill cats more,
but yeah,

1123
01:01:59,031 --> 01:02:01,850
they do kill dogs because dogs are about,
depending on the size of your dog,

1124
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:02,780
there's some of those,

1125
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:05,530
some dogs could fuck those things up
because they're not that big, but they,

1126
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:08,330
they're known as murder cats.
It was a small dog, I think.

1127
01:02:08,331 --> 01:02:12,090
And I think they flanked it and it just
came at it from the sides of the part,

1128
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,300
the real part of dog.
What do you do when someone,

1129
01:02:14,301 --> 01:02:16,130
something like that kills your dog?
Are you out with a shotgun?

1130
01:02:16,131 --> 01:02:17,360
Trying to find the rest of them did.

1131
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:20,130
I was trying to kill coyotes after the
eight my chickens and I don't give,

1132
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:25,170
I mean, I love chickens.
Like they're cute. They're my
friends. But when they died,

1133
01:02:25,171 --> 01:02:29,070
a couple of them died of natural causes.
Yeah. I'd be like, Aww, poor little guy.

1134
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:31,920
But if my dog died, it'd be
really sad. You know what I mean?

1135
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,780
It's a different relationship.
Different.

1136
01:02:33,781 --> 01:02:35,490
So when these coyotes killed my chickens,

1137
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:40,491
I sat out there on the porch with a bow
and a range finder waiting to fuck them

1138
01:02:40,951 --> 01:02:45,780
up for days. I even tied one of the
dead chickens that they killed to a pot,

1139
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,990
like a, you know, that you would
plant in. What are you doing, Jamie?

1140
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:53,100
Um,
the Po that you plant things in.

1141
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:57,270
And I sat it in the middle of the yard as
bait. Right. And I sat up there waiting.

1142
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,750
David, one of them came and my daughter
screamed out a coyote and I'm like,

1143
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:05,570
God damn, I got to teach her how to hunt.
Like I had that motherfucker that's,

1144
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:08,960
it was inside of these inside of 40 yards
and he was creeping in. I was like, aw.

1145
01:03:08,961 --> 01:03:12,840
I had to do is get to my spot and I
would have probably got a shot. Yeah.

1146
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,041
How 40 yards.

1147
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:17,350
That's a far away [inaudible] he was
at 40 yards when my daughter scream.

1148
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,730
Oh Shit. Well then, then
he's like, fuck this.

1149
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:21,860
I stayed up there for a few hours longer.
What's the,

1150
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:24,810
what's the furthest that you can feel
comfortable hitting a target for where the

1151
01:03:24,811 --> 01:03:27,180
little target,
you know,

1152
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:32,270
there's a difference between
something that's the size of a coyote.

1153
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,070
Coyote is only like,
they're not paying,

1154
01:03:35,071 --> 01:03:40,020
their body might be like a foot, a foot
and a half. They're not big at all.

1155
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:43,320
Yeah. They're tiny from top to
bottom. So what we're trying to,

1156
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:47,010
if you're trying to hit them in the
vitals, you don't have a lot to aim at.

1157
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:51,450
It's a very small bag. Dot. Yeah. Yeah.
Want to be, you'd want to be fairly close.

1158
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:54,120
I think about that all the time. They'll
go with a rifle, you could shoot them.

1159
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,630
That's not something totally different.
I tried to kill him.

1160
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:59,160
I only grew up shooting rifles.

1161
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:03,570
I never shot a gun until I
was in my twenties but rifles,

1162
01:04:03,571 --> 01:04:04,440
I was so used to shooting.

1163
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:09,030
I got so accustomed to shooting it and
then I tried to boat once and that was

1164
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:12,720
unbelievably fucking hard. You
should learn. It'd be fun for it.

1165
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:15,120
You can always come here and practice.
I'll come next time.

1166
01:04:15,121 --> 01:04:20,040
John Dudley comes into town, I'll have
him a hook you up and they'd love it, man.

1167
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:24,540
Not even like to go hunting but just
to shoot targets. It's really fun.

1168
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:27,420
And that like guns though. That
game out there. I do too. Yeah.

1169
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:31,650
That game out there that I have that uh,
techno hunt gay dude.

1170
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:35,400
Once you get into that and start playing
that once your [inaudible] at a screen,

1171
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,540
you're fucking good at it. Oh, fun. I had
Corey Anderson, UFC light heavyweight.

1172
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:40,211
He's a bow hunter.

1173
01:04:40,211 --> 01:04:42,510
I had him here the other day and
he was playing it cause he good.

1174
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,330
He's really good. But you could
tell like writing me, he practiced.

1175
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:49,100
He so fucking elite athlete of course
he's going to be good at, but one thing.

1176
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,240
Yeah, that's true. What do they not,

1177
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:56,970
so he's got this discipline mindset
and you know, it's just on the ball.

1178
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:00,420
But um, you could say right away when
you planned, it was like, oh my God,

1179
01:05:00,421 --> 01:05:03,330
this is so addictive. I'm like, this
is the most addictive game of all time.

1180
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:06,480
Once you started, it's hard to get let it
go. If you're an actual bow hunter, you,

1181
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:11,400
you only get to shoot a thing
like a couple of times a year.

1182
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,590
Yeah. You know, if you're going a lot,

1183
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:17,970
if you're going a lot like the idea that
you're going to shoot a lot of like tea,

1184
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:21,550
if you're some Ramey warrant type
character or Cameron Hanes, yeah.

1185
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:25,260
You'll shoot a bunch of deer a
year and you live off those. Yeah.

1186
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,430
But if you're a regular person,

1187
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:30,130
like you think how many deer
you think you're going to find,

1188
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:33,200
how many deer you think you gonna sneak
up on if you're lucky, one or two a year.

1189
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:37,210
So like the moment when it happens, it's
such a big moment. You're like, fuck,

1190
01:05:37,211 --> 01:05:40,180
here it is. Here it is. We're
trying to stay calm and stay calm.

1191
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,600
But with that thing you're shooting
at them all the time. Just fun.

1192
01:05:43,601 --> 01:05:44,500
So it's in your head.

1193
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:48,940
So like what I'm seeing is this animal
moves and moves into the pocket, boom,

1194
01:05:48,941 --> 01:05:52,540
the release pop and it hits it perfect
and you see it over and over and over and

1195
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:53,374
over and over again.

1196
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,080
So what you learned from martial arts
and what you learned from standup,

1197
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:59,350
it's the same thing that applies
to bow hunt. It's about repetition.

1198
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:02,590
The more you can do it and the more you
see it over and over and over again,

1199
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:05,220
the more that pattern becomes your mind.
So that gate for it,

1200
01:06:05,221 --> 01:06:10,000
for a guy like Cory or someone like me,
you bow hunts that games like, Holy Shit,

1201
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:14,410
this is what I've been looking for. See
a real animal walk into range that would,

1202
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:15,850
cause you always want to be ethical,
right?

1203
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:18,370
You want to be able to
shoot the right animal.

1204
01:06:18,371 --> 01:06:20,830
Like you want to be able to
hit it exactly where you want,

1205
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,630
where it expires very quickly.

1206
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:24,890
The best way to do that as
well as some difference.

1207
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:29,080
So this game is just super addictive.
What's it called? What's the game called?

1208
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:32,680
It's called Techno Hunt Techno. Ah,
can you, your score against each other.

1209
01:06:32,681 --> 01:06:36,010
So if you and I were playing it like
you give 10 points for a Bullseye,

1210
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,770
eight points for the vitals,
you get like five points for headshots.

1211
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:42,430
Where's the shot? No, no.

1212
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:45,610
It would have to be a very small
subset about headshots learning,

1213
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:48,250
like playing gun games, first person
shooter games. Over the years,

1214
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:50,920
headshots are always the most
rewarding thing. Like, oh, add shot.

1215
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,360
But you don't want to
do that with an animal.

1216
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:57,250
Do you do if you have a rifle and you
want it to die instantaneous. And it is a,

1217
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:02,700
the way they do it that some hunters that
are chefs do it when they like hunters

1218
01:07:03,461 --> 01:07:07,750
who are chefs. Um, there's, there's
two different kinds of hunters, right?

1219
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:12,640
There's a hunter's that eat the
meat and they, but they want,

1220
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:17,200
they want to shoot a mature animal
because that's what everybody strives for.

1221
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,240
It like if you're a skilled hunter,
like of your,

1222
01:07:19,241 --> 01:07:23,200
a Steven Rinella or someone like that,
what you're trying to get is, uh,

1223
01:07:23,201 --> 01:07:25,750
an old wise animal.

1224
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:30,700
It's already spread its DNA and it's
mature and it's probably the end of its

1225
01:07:30,701 --> 01:07:33,430
breeding cycle. That's what a
guy like that wants. What he's,

1226
01:07:33,431 --> 01:07:35,770
he's like the ultimate hunter,
right?

1227
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,130
What he wants is the most fair chase.

1228
01:07:39,131 --> 01:07:43,030
He's never hunts in high fence operations,
the most fair chase,

1229
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:46,930
the wildest animal, and he wants
to get the oldest maturest one.

1230
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,850
But then there's chefs and
chefs believe some of them do.

1231
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:55,600
It's very debatable that the younger
animals tastes better than the older

1232
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:58,930
animals. So they're not trying
to get an old mature animal.

1233
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:03,060
They're trying to get a, a young, um,

1234
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:06,660
a tender animal that isn't
like fully muscled, ripe,

1235
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:10,210
worn out with a, you want some, you
want some stills tenderness to it,

1236
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:14,500
some softness to the muscle. But then
there's people like Hank Shaw who's a,

1237
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:16,430
also a world famous chef

1238
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:21,460
who's also a hunter who prefers older
animals cause he thinks there's like

1239
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:25,520
there's flavor to them and there's
life to them like that they're,

1240
01:08:25,521 --> 01:08:28,490
they're aging and they'll
all their life experience,

1241
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:30,140
it comes out if you cook them correctly,

1242
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:33,060
it just requires a different sort of
preparation. Right. It's Kinda like,

1243
01:08:33,061 --> 01:08:35,930
it's Kinda like a young
women versus older women.

1244
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:38,570
Like young women have a lot
of positives about them,

1245
01:08:38,571 --> 01:08:43,340
but older women have just as
many positives about them.
Older women that flavor.

1246
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,330
That's what you want, right? You
want to check who's like, yeah,

1247
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:51,140
who didn't give a six plus who hits
the gym every day. I know. Trust me,

1248
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:55,470
I know. I, I've had this conversation
about the whole night because when,

1249
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,550
if we stop working out, it's over. I
said, if we stop working for like we,

1250
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:01,810
if we stop exercising and carrying water
health, it's all there. It's over fact.

1251
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:05,050
No, I mean like I wanted
a sign I wanted my, uh,

1252
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:08,420
and one of my lawyer has a joke to sign
document that says if we, if we get fat,

1253
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:13,670
it's like a free and clear
gone. But I mean it, if she
gets fat out, if I get fat,

1254
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:17,270
she should be out. If either of us break
this thing that we're doing together,

1255
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,090
what if it brings you closer that we get,

1256
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:23,300
she gets fed to worry about body image
anymore. Fuck you just let yourself go.

1257
01:09:23,301 --> 01:09:26,600
Fuck that. Come on. Fuck
that shit. Hey, hey,

1258
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:30,920
hey shaming right now. We can realize it
or not. Hey, I know you don't want sham

1259
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:36,590
show you fat. Fuck, I can't
believe you. I just think,

1260
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:39,050
I think we've made a bond together.
We made a pact where we're like,

1261
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:41,570
we both want to stay relatively
healthy and take care of ourselves.

1262
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:43,430
So in our older years,
like my parents are both in,

1263
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,680
in really great shape because
they've cared their whole lives.

1264
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,980
Not to a point of like,
you know, not having fun,

1265
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:50,360
they still have a great fucking time,

1266
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,290
but just they just stayed consistent
with a caring about what you put in your

1267
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:58,400
body and the way you work as simple
shit. So yeah, if she gets fat by,

1268
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:03,050
if I get that she's by two, if I get
fucking fat, she's gone. She even said it.

1269
01:10:03,051 --> 01:10:05,090
She was like,
I'll leave your fat ass being fat.

1270
01:10:05,091 --> 01:10:08,420
It's such a weird one that people
call people fat who aren't fat. Right?

1271
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:12,830
I mean it might be,
but I'm just saying like as an insult.

1272
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:16,250
It's such a weird one. It is because
like girls will call girls fat.

1273
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:21,080
Like that fat bitch look at our is not
fat. No. What he's saying, it's just that,

1274
01:10:21,081 --> 01:10:23,960
let's just say it's a dig. It's
another gift for you. You Fat.

1275
01:10:23,961 --> 01:10:27,980
Fuck the guys who say that. The guys that
like barely have any fat on bed. Fuck,

1276
01:10:27,981 --> 01:10:31,280
we need to know the cheeseburger.
Jamie. You Fat. Fuck. Fuck that it,

1277
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:36,320
it's an easy day. It's an easy insult to,
to how to grow. Call me fat at the con.

1278
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:37,550
There's a video of it online.

1279
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:41,870
Who girl calling me fat at the comedy
store and a pull up my sheet, my six pack.

1280
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:46,640
No, like long time now.
Crazy. But it was like,

1281
01:10:46,641 --> 01:10:48,370
why am I am I'm fat?
Like what?

1282
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:51,410
Where are you coming up with
that you're affecting you're fat.

1283
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,950
I bet you it's a weird thing.
The the,

1284
01:10:55,610 --> 01:11:00,320
the fact that the body
can carry excess tissue.

1285
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,610
It's a mistake. Like I get it.
It's a good way to store fuel.

1286
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,250
And when it gets to a point
like why are you still hungry?

1287
01:11:07,251 --> 01:11:11,030
What kind of shitty system do we have
that you're this big and you're still

1288
01:11:11,031 --> 01:11:14,110
hungry? Didn't attempt to break and
say, hey bro, bro, bro, Bro, stop.

1289
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,510
We got the fuel.

1290
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:18,270
But it does not put to your bodies
and working off carbohydrates.

1291
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,670
That's a problem. Right?
And it's not burning fat.

1292
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:24,660
That's why that whole ketogenic diet works
as much as people don't like to think

1293
01:11:24,661 --> 01:11:28,760
that it does. There's so much controversy
about that, like from nonscientists,

1294
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:29,820
which is hilarious.

1295
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:33,480
Have you talked to actual scientists like
Dom D'agostino who talked to you about

1296
01:11:33,481 --> 01:11:34,800
the peer reviewed research?

1297
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:39,000
That's been done on ketogenic states and
all the different benefits and what you

1298
01:11:39,001 --> 01:11:42,930
know and how it could be healthy and
how he does it and Ketone esters and all

1299
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:45,570
these different factors you have to take
into consideration and they'd ketone

1300
01:11:45,571 --> 01:11:47,520
testing and blood testing it.

1301
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:51,480
There's all these knuckleheads saying
it's bad for you. It's not a good idea.

1302
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:54,240
Like Julian Micheal. It's like it's
not a good idea. It's not good.

1303
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:58,560
You finished up, they say
that as a benefit. Sam Pounds,
right. It's a normal state.

1304
01:11:58,561 --> 01:12:03,030
It's a normal state for your body to
burn fat and you have more clarity and

1305
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:07,910
you'll also, you're not as hungry. You're
not as hungry during the day. My team,

1306
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:12,330
my problem with it is I don't think
it's the best thing for performance.

1307
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:16,580
I think like you have a
little bit more energy if he,

1308
01:12:16,581 --> 01:12:20,600
you burn glucose too cause
even like the top, ah,

1309
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:23,760
there's a Zack bitter.
He wouldn't even when the American,

1310
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:28,770
he ran 20 he ran a hundred miles
in like 11 hours around a track.

1311
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,830
These guys that could do this shit.
It was some crazy record.

1312
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,630
Two miles and I need to chill
for a minute. Some crazy,

1313
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:41,430
some crazy record for a hundred
mile record. He broke 11 hours,

1314
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:44,670
40 minutes second. That's
insane. That a minute mile,

1315
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:48,330
seven minute miles or a
hundred fucking miles.

1316
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:52,560
Now he is on primarily a carnivore diet.

1317
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:57,570
All meat, all meat, rib eyes, and
barely eat barely any meat and fat.

1318
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,950
Barely any greens. Right? Barely in
Greens. But then when he competes,

1319
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:06,570
he takes a lot of uh, glucose.
Like he'll take like glucose gel,

1320
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,130
like those gels. Gel packets. Yes.
And those runners use, yeah, he,

1321
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:15,090
he pounds in that shit. Pounds
in the carbs. So he could
burn that off too. Right.

1322
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:19,020
You know, cause he's living
off for like fat and protein.

1323
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:23,790
But when he competes, he
doesn't do that. And the thing,

1324
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:28,080
I think that's the key. You're saying
when he competes, he does use the glucose,

1325
01:13:28,081 --> 01:13:32,160
but when he's done competing he does.
He goes back to putting his body in a fat,

1326
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:35,610
a fat burning state.
It's a pure carnivore.

1327
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,470
Our diets are kind of crazy
as I don't like pure, just,

1328
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:41,370
just meat and nothing else. And
saw the eight man. I know you,

1329
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:46,110
Jordan Peterson has done it now for over
a year and he released his blood work

1330
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:49,620
or the results of his blood work.
At least everything's in range.

1331
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:53,370
Everything's healthy.
Supplemental vitamins, nothing.
No, he doesn't do anything.

1332
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:58,020
He eats steak with salt
on it and he drinks water.

1333
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,190
And I'm telling you, listen to me, man.
If he gets a Perrier with lime in it,

1334
01:14:02,191 --> 01:14:03,120
he'll spit it out.

1335
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:08,040
He doesn't want the lime in a fucking
Perry and that it's yes. Crazy.

1336
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:12,130
That's too much. I lost 50
pounds, 50 pounds, 80 pounds,

1337
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:16,630
lost 50 pounds. He had some
serious immunological, uh, issues.

1338
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:21,790
Um, immunological that'll
word and know. Yeah,

1339
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:26,380
it sounds made up. Yeah. I Dunno.
He had serious immune deficiency.

1340
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:29,590
He had immunity, immune deficiency.
Immunological Bob. But doesn't it sound,

1341
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:33,240
it sounds phony. Yeah. It sounds fake.
Immunology and immunology, you know,

1342
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,920
but immunological sounds blood bullshit.

1343
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:37,720
It sounds like you took two
words and put them together.

1344
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:41,110
Where fake sophistication,
sophistication,

1345
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:46,180
he'd some serious issues, um, as helped.
Yeah, dude also suffered from depression.

1346
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:47,620
All that stuff.
Look,

1347
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:51,280
a lot of what they think that a lot
of the issues that people suffer from,

1348
01:14:51,281 --> 01:14:53,770
they suffer because of inflammation.

1349
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:57,580
And when scientists are studying things
at the carnivore diet, what would,

1350
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:02,770
what's striking to them almost more than
the fact that you're just eating meat

1351
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,810
is that you're not eating
all these other things.

1352
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:09,100
And so that in giving your body
only one food source to deal with,

1353
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:13,150
sometimes your body can eliminate
a lot of the issues that it has.

1354
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,470
And it also mimics like some of
the benefits of fasting. It's,

1355
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:20,260
I'm too stupid to be really judging this.
I don't know. I'm listening to all that.

1356
01:15:20,261 --> 01:15:23,770
I know that I'm fucking dumped too.
He had like receding gums,

1357
01:15:23,771 --> 01:15:25,990
he had some serious gum
issues that all went away.

1358
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,960
All these things went away when he was
on that carnivore diet for you. Okay.

1359
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:32,230
I don't eat like that. I'm not saying
eat like I don't eat like that.

1360
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:34,630
I think it's gotta be a balance,
I think.

1361
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:36,250
I think some people may
may work with that, right?

1362
01:15:36,251 --> 01:15:38,740
But they'll also tell you there's so many
diets that people do that their blood

1363
01:15:38,741 --> 01:15:40,960
doesn't line up with that diet.
It's not good for them. Right.

1364
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:43,090
Some people that just works
with, right. Some people,

1365
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,630
some people can have higher intakes of
red meat and other people, it's really,

1366
01:15:46,631 --> 01:15:49,120
really bad for their system just
because of the way were blood is,

1367
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:52,540
well some people are literally
allergic to it. Right. But like uh,

1368
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:55,840
like my wife needs way more iron,
like needs like has to happen.

1369
01:15:56,100 --> 01:16:00,100
So whether it's supplemented by pills
or by higher incidence of meets with

1370
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:04,580
higher iron in it comes a lot of vitamins
in it and some iron. I'm Natalie,

1371
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,810
I can't produce any more man. None.
They cut off my balls. Doo, Doo Doo.

1372
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:12,040
I turned him in. Yeah. What did it,
what caused you to turn them in?

1373
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:13,450
What was the final straw?

1374
01:16:13,451 --> 01:16:16,510
Was this movement downtown La
Barista at your own gender? Yeah.

1375
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,730
I went to the me too thing and I cut
off my balls and I left him there.

1376
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:23,440
So I just, I donated them if you like,
if people started calling for that.

1377
01:16:23,441 --> 01:16:26,920
If girls are calling for that,
guys would do it. Remove your nuts.

1378
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:30,070
There's guys out there that would,
there is a certain kind of guy that would,

1379
01:16:30,071 --> 01:16:31,570
there's so many people there.

1380
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:36,280
If you called for guys to step out into
the middle of the town square and cut

1381
01:16:36,281 --> 01:16:38,900
their own balls off,
at least a couple of guys would show up.

1382
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:41,700
I can name two to send us.
We live in,

1383
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:44,290
there's a couple of dudes I know
that would fuck up that exactly.

1384
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:46,840
Just for like Twitter credit.
Yeah, just for some street. I just,

1385
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:49,040
I just rather read tweets.

1386
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:52,960
Love from is how you are an ally.

1387
01:16:52,961 --> 01:16:57,760
Boys learn like my fed. Like we were
favorite. Like your favorite shirts.

1388
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:02,410
Yeah. Females kick ass or what is it? Oh
women kick ass or whatever else. Yeah,

1389
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,840
yeah, yeah. That'll hold
the idea of like a of a,

1390
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:10,040
of virtue signaling overt,
overt support for

1391
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:13,940
something. It's so seethrough when
you're like, I'm here for you girls.

1392
01:17:13,941 --> 01:17:16,810
It's so seethrough. God, it's
such a crock of shit, but the,

1393
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:19,820
they can feel that way without
yelling at all the time we pull.

1394
01:17:19,821 --> 01:17:24,290
You also like broadcasting like that.
Like what? What are you doing? Yeah.

1395
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:26,990
What are you doing? What's the
purpose? Yeah, that's what I like. Why?

1396
01:17:26,991 --> 01:17:30,680
Why are you reaching out? You're
supporting, what do you supporting?

1397
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:31,993
What is happening here?

1398
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:36,410
It's another instance of the echo chamber
doing the whole supporting the thing

1399
01:17:36,411 --> 01:17:37,640
that I don't think people are really,

1400
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,820
I talk about it on stage
about the Trent Trent,

1401
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:46,430
the word transphobic over
like I understand the meaning,

1402
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:50,870
but I also think it's hyperbolized and
in essence of like there are these large

1403
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:53,660
groups of people that are against trans
people. I don't believe that whatsoever,

1404
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:54,680
but there were definitely are.

1405
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:57,200
I think there's small groups of
people that get a lot of attention.

1406
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:02,780
I don't think there's massive look. The
KKK is significantly larger of a group.

1407
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:06,500
Then whatever group you want to formulate
of a transfer of trans phobic nature.

1408
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:08,500
I know a lot of people don't
even know what that is. Right?

1409
01:18:08,501 --> 01:18:10,610
I haven't done any statistical research.

1410
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,480
Look how many KKK members
are in the United States?
There are tens of thousands.

1411
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,380
Okay. How many people? What do people do?
I think a trans people religious that,

1412
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:23,060
that don't believe in trans people or
they don't think that they should be able

1413
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:24,710
to call themselves a woman.
I think Ma,

1414
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:28,580
I think most of those people don't care
enough to call themselves part of that

1415
01:18:28,581 --> 01:18:31,760
category. They just disagree with they go,
I don't really like it. I don't get it.

1416
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:32,660
I think,

1417
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:35,030
I think there's more of those than
there are people that are like adamantly

1418
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:37,070
against trans rights.

1419
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:40,520
I think we have to take into consideration
what we already said about God's

1420
01:18:40,521 --> 01:18:43,970
willing to cut their balls off that
there are guys like that or sure.

1421
01:18:43,971 --> 01:18:46,910
There are some,
there are so many people in this country.

1422
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:51,080
I guarantee you there's a lot of trans
phobic people a lot. Cause listen man,

1423
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:53,960
if you read the comments and I don't,
and I didn't,

1424
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,290
but someone told me that the
comments and the Eddie Izzard uh,

1425
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,360
Instagram posts that
are made were horrific.

1426
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,880
But don't you think that
is an internet fodder?

1427
01:19:01,881 --> 01:19:04,340
See that's my thing is I think people
like to say shit on the Internet,

1428
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,220
even if they don't believe it, because
they know that gets attention. If they go,

1429
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:10,610
fuck this fucking dude looks like a
chick that I don't know what they said.

1430
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,890
Maybe they were just making fun
of the way he looks. So you can,

1431
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,160
you can assume what fucking people right
on the Internet about that, that issue.

1432
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,280
They would just go, what's up with this?
Fuck. Oh, here. I'll give you an example.

1433
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:23,600
I tweeted the other day about
the met gala Harry styles. Uh,

1434
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:25,490
I tweeted a,
uh,

1435
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,940
he was wearing like a lot of men were
wearing like dresses at the met gala.

1436
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:31,040
This was a whole thing.
And I tweeted,

1437
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:35,630
Tilda Swinton looked fire at the met
gala because he looked like Tilda Swinton

1438
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:37,730
not cause I'm saying like,
who's till the swim?

1439
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:41,630
She's a fucking actress who has short
hair, right. So right. That was him.

1440
01:19:41,631 --> 01:19:45,330
And I said, Tilda Swinton looked fire
at the met gala. Who is this gentleman?

1441
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:49,310
He's a, he's a pop star. He's like part
of, what's it called? One direction.

1442
01:19:49,311 --> 01:19:51,710
He's part of one direction. What?
What is happening with that shirt?

1443
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:55,900
That's what he wore to the met. Callous.
What'd you say Jamie? It's a blouse.

1444
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:58,850
Blouse. Shirts versus blouses.
Okay. Here's the thing.

1445
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:01,550
If you're going to one of those things
and you're going to stand in front of all

1446
01:20:01,551 --> 01:20:05,150
these jackasses with cameras taking
pictures of why not wear a fucking blouse?

1447
01:20:05,151 --> 01:20:07,980
That's what, that's what, but I said till

1448
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,990
the sweat and looked fire because
when I saw the first image,

1449
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:11,870
his face kind of looked
like Tilda Swinton. Okay.

1450
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:15,060
Of course I'm making the joke about a
joke. You're a comedian. Well, dude,

1451
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:18,150
everyone was like very funny
last night. Thank you. Thank you.

1452
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,540
Everyone went after me. Everyone
was like, oh, of course you fucking,

1453
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:26,340
I mean Habsi are you a Nazi? The,
here's my problem. They go, um, he,

1454
01:20:26,341 --> 01:20:28,710
I think he's gay, right? Is
He, is he gay? Jamie? No,

1455
01:20:28,711 --> 01:20:30,900
I think somebody told me they were
like alone. They were like your, your,

1456
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:35,490
your menu. I was like, Whoa, I can't
make fun of people anymore for people.

1457
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,910
I said he looked like till the fucking
Swinton. Why are you reading comments?

1458
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:43,210
Because I'm not as famous as you stop
and think about the amount of people that

1459
01:20:43,211 --> 01:20:44,044
have had their balls.

1460
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:48,450
I know that would just walk into that
town square and cut their balls off.

1461
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:52,970
Now stop and think about those
people commenting. Yeah, I know.

1462
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:55,650
And you're reading it and allowing
it to fuck with your head.

1463
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,980
Sometimes I feed into it. A lot
of times I don't. When do you not?

1464
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,450
When I'm confident in whatever I
posted. That's interesting. Right?

1465
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,630
We're not like that joke.
I knew it was going to be misinterpreted.

1466
01:21:06,631 --> 01:21:10,520
Like I knew when I wrote that I go, some
of them misinterpret this. Who Care?

1467
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:14,850
That's why I still posted it, but, but
I read some shit sometimes if I go,

1468
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:17,220
I wonder if that was
dumb or if that was cool.

1469
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:20,870
Wouldn't it be fun if you could be half
drunk all the time and never suffered

1470
01:21:20,871 --> 01:21:23,220
any physical consequences?
Me, you know, I'd love that.

1471
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:27,870
Nothing would make me more happy. Love
drinking, but with a half a buzz on,

1472
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,450
you know that feeling when
you got to half of on it?

1473
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:33,140
Like my favorite thing in the world
because no one could touch me.

1474
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:37,050
Just feel good. You know how I know that
feeling, hanging out with your friends,

1475
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:40,560
having a buzz and not worried about it.
That's how alcoholism starts.

1476
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:43,470
I think that was a lot of members of
my family had half a buzz all the time,

1477
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:48,270
but well, half a buzz all the
time would be a, it's like a,

1478
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:52,950
that'd be a good place to be. Maybe. How
many [inaudible] how many chats are good?

1479
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:53,820
Half of the bad half.

1480
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:58,380
You came a little little like that
feeling you get after that first glass of

1481
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:01,080
wine when you're like, ah, why do
you think people have wine at lunch?

1482
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:03,800
A lot of people show up work.

1483
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:06,900
I sushi had someone was drinking a
bottle of wine by herself yesterday.

1484
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,740
Is that league, like if you work
in an office and you have a glass,

1485
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,980
did they let you have a cocktail at
lunch? Totally. It depends on who you are,

1486
01:22:12,981 --> 01:22:16,140
where you work. If you listened in
our industry, entertainment street,

1487
01:22:16,141 --> 01:22:18,750
there's no fucking rules. Well,
obviously, but I'm saying like a regular,

1488
01:22:18,751 --> 01:22:21,750
but do you remember the dude who used
to run the Tempe Improv didn't want you

1489
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,470
doing shots before you go onto the note,

1490
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:26,850
no drinks before you pop a conversation
with me about it. He's like,

1491
01:22:26,851 --> 01:22:30,660
do you really need that? And I was like,
Hey, hey, listen to me. Look at me.

1492
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:35,310
I'm a professional, right? I'm also an
athlete or I work out a lot. I'll be fine.

1493
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:38,010
I'll be, I'm going to do this
or I'm going to go to the gym.

1494
01:22:38,011 --> 01:22:41,550
You want to work out with me? Yeah,
we'll shut the fuck up, man. Come on.

1495
01:22:41,551 --> 01:22:45,180
Just on the club, dude. I'm not, I'm
not going to get so drunk or can't talk.

1496
01:22:45,181 --> 01:22:49,730
I'm having a shot. Yeah. Four I perform.
If you became one of those guys, yeah,

1497
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,420
you would know.
Everybody knows.

1498
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:56,440
It's like I know what I'm doing
and even if I have too many,

1499
01:22:56,701 --> 01:23:01,440
if I have four or five instead of two,
I'm going to be okay.

1500
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:05,320
Like I'm growing up. I'm still figuring
it out. Driving anywhere, drug.

1501
01:23:05,321 --> 01:23:06,460
I'm not doing anything stupid

1502
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:09,360
working tonight. In fact, there's
nights where I've had a few,

1503
01:23:09,361 --> 01:23:10,890
cause I've been sad about where I am,

1504
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:13,590
like I'm at a club that I don't want to
be at or something and I'll have a few

1505
01:23:13,591 --> 01:23:14,160
too many,

1506
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:17,460
but I'll get on stage and the first
thing I think is I still got to put on a

1507
01:23:17,461 --> 01:23:21,000
show. I still got to work hard,
but I'm a little, little drunk,

1508
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:25,050
but autopilot kicks in a little bit
sometimes. Like back in the day,

1509
01:23:25,051 --> 01:23:26,970
if I was sad about the small shitty room,

1510
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:30,030
it would just kick into the jokes I
already knew were going to work and I was

1511
01:23:30,031 --> 01:23:32,130
kinda going through the motions.
I was still delivering,

1512
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,050
but it was sad because you're like,
I'm not,

1513
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:36,390
I don't know if I'm enjoying this or I'm
going through the motions if I'm just

1514
01:23:36,391 --> 01:23:38,130
kind of like, Hey, this is the joke.

1515
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:41,970
That's the joke in my mind is just
on a Rolodex of like this joke,

1516
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,000
spend that joke where now I'm just had
a happier place in my career that now if

1517
01:23:48,451 --> 01:23:51,090
I do, if I did get a little
too drunk for, I want to stage,

1518
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:55,470
I'd be genuinely nervous.
I'd be nervous about my performance level.

1519
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,630
It's like fuck him. Are they going
to hear me slip up a little bit?

1520
01:23:57,631 --> 01:24:00,480
Am I going to cause I'll feel
it because with, with great,

1521
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,270
with great power comes
great responsibility rate.
The greater the rooms,

1522
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:07,680
the group, the bigger the rooms,
the more power, not me but with,

1523
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:11,190
but the bigger the rooms get,
the more I feel more.

1524
01:24:11,191 --> 01:24:15,040
I feel more responsible to do even
better than I have been doing.

1525
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:20,110
Do you walked out on stage in San Diego
in front of 13 13,000 people and own

1526
01:24:20,601 --> 01:24:23,330
that motherfucker is fucking
wild. It was wild. It felt,

1527
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:25,040
you know what it was doing in the round.

1528
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:28,910
It was weird to do the round.
I, I don't know if I love it.

1529
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:30,260
I don't know if I loved it or hated it,

1530
01:24:30,261 --> 01:24:34,210
but it was this feeling of such
uniqueness that I couldn't judge it in the

1531
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:36,500
moment like it was too.
It was happening so fast.

1532
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:40,540
There was no, there's no sitting on
the stool and there's 13,000 people.

1533
01:24:40,590 --> 01:24:42,420
There's no stagnancy.
You have to keep moving.

1534
01:24:42,421 --> 01:24:45,570
You're moving around the whole title.
Yeah. I liked it. It's interesting.

1535
01:24:45,571 --> 01:24:48,240
It was wild because the screens are so
big and everybody could always see your

1536
01:24:48,241 --> 01:24:51,930
face no matter where. Yeah, it
was. It was good. I loved it.

1537
01:24:52,110 --> 01:24:55,200
13,000 human beings. It's a
lot of fucking people, son,

1538
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:59,220
who's very weird by the way. I'm
going to Denver. When is that?

1539
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,840
What does it know? Jamie's gimme
give wrong information? Jamie.

1540
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:08,040
Jamie just blurts things out. Just
takes chances. 24th of September,

1541
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:10,240
he's been slipping a little bit.
Have you noticed Sanchez draw?

1542
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:14,280
What's been going on? Jamie? Half Trump
all the time. You have bust. It's August.

1543
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:18,210
August what? 23 and 24 hours.
23rd I'm at the Belko theater.

1544
01:25:18,211 --> 01:25:20,310
How did you not know that?
Jamie and I just belted that out.

1545
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:22,320
And then you have the fucking computer.

1546
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:27,590
August 9th I'm in Portland and August
10th I'm in the bay area at the shoreline.

1547
01:25:28,771 --> 01:25:33,130
Amphitheatre yeah. Oh Shit.
Oh Shit. Oh Shit. Oh Shit.

1548
01:25:33,131 --> 01:25:35,280
And have some fun dude.
Fucking, hey, we go to Chicago.

1549
01:25:35,281 --> 01:25:38,650
I'm going to go with you to Chicago.
Austin. Austin was a good guy. Incredible.

1550
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:42,660
Incredible. It's so good. Yeah,
it's great. Cap City, you know,

1551
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:46,680
one of the best clubs in the country.
That's like it. I think doing those clubs,

1552
01:25:46,681 --> 01:25:50,730
like doing weekends at clubs is
real valuable. That's, I got to,

1553
01:25:50,731 --> 01:25:52,830
I'm going to book more of those,
you know,

1554
01:25:52,831 --> 01:25:55,140
it gets great always to be working at
the store and it's great when we're doing

1555
01:25:55,141 --> 01:25:56,940
these big places in the road,
but those clubs,

1556
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:59,910
there's something about like if
you've done xannies in Nashville,

1557
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:03,500
never done Sandy's Nashville, let's do it.
Zany Chicago. I've got never Nashville.

1558
01:26:03,501 --> 01:26:04,310
Let's do it.
Okay,

1559
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:06,060
let's do it.
Let's got that pleases Shit.

1560
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:10,760
You see that the punchline in San
Francisco follows and so the parlor live,

1561
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:14,210
the part of their lives going down
to the punchline is closing forever.

1562
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,870
They might move it. No, no, no. Here's
what's happening. This is the real report.

1563
01:26:17,871 --> 01:26:19,010
I read it.
I read a,

1564
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:22,980
an article again this morning because
last night Ali Wong told me, and um,

1565
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:26,270
I read the article that was posted this
morning and it basically said they lost

1566
01:26:26,271 --> 01:26:28,400
their lease.
They couldn't renew it because it's got,

1567
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:30,170
that building's getting
bought out basically.

1568
01:26:30,530 --> 01:26:34,460
So they are working diligently
now to try to relocate the club.

1569
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:37,490
So we just need to find a new look. Yeah.
But it, but, but for the time being,

1570
01:26:37,491 --> 01:26:39,620
it's going to be gone.
You know what I worry about?

1571
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:42,400
I'm worried they're going to go
big like did with cops, right?

1572
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:45,830
Like I used to do cobb's um,
when it was not,

1573
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:50,720
I don't think it was 150 seats. It
was tiny. Right now it's like four 50.

1574
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:54,290
[inaudible] it became, it became the
opposite of what you used to be. Right.

1575
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:55,850
It used to be a place that you would go,

1576
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,180
you'd make less money but you'd have
more fun cause it was like real tight.

1577
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:03,390
Everybody was like smashed into this place
and it was a legendary place. That's,

1578
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:06,560
that's, that's easily one of the
best and I want it to go back,

1579
01:27:06,561 --> 01:27:08,300
which kind of sucks that
it's going to be gone now.

1580
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:09,710
The reason I love this club so much,

1581
01:27:09,711 --> 01:27:13,580
so what you see is the stage
and tables and behind us,

1582
01:27:13,581 --> 01:27:15,710
which you can't see as the
bars in the back of the room,

1583
01:27:15,711 --> 01:27:17,780
which is one of my favorite
elements of a cool club.

1584
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:21,770
You don't need to worry about people
getting a drink to the side or the left

1585
01:27:21,771 --> 01:27:23,250
behind.
You can't hear an ice machine,

1586
01:27:23,251 --> 01:27:27,200
but it's in the very back of the room
and they do such a good job of hiding

1587
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:30,110
their noise and they're distractions.
So it's all about the show.

1588
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:32,990
They were fucking so good at
it, man. They're really good.

1589
01:27:32,991 --> 01:27:36,440
I hope they keep it intimate venue
or really do. Yeah, I love that room.

1590
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:39,770
Needs an intimate venue.
Does San Francisco have a
good comedy scene these days?

1591
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:42,050
I hear,
I hear a variant of stories.

1592
01:27:42,051 --> 01:27:45,260
I think a lot of people would say
that was better back back, you know,

1593
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:48,740
a couple decades ago.
But I do think that when I go up there,

1594
01:27:48,741 --> 01:27:49,491
when I had been up there,

1595
01:27:49,491 --> 01:27:51,770
there's a lot of young people that are
really good that are coming still out in

1596
01:27:51,771 --> 01:27:56,390
northern California, but I mean
cobs and there used to be, um,

1597
01:27:56,660 --> 01:28:00,080
what is it? Green onion? No, the purple
onion. Yeah. That used to be there.

1598
01:28:00,081 --> 01:28:02,240
There was no, there was one
more. Is that what it's called?

1599
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:05,150
Why does it sound wrong? I don't know
cause I'm saying it sounds wrong. No,

1600
01:28:05,151 --> 01:28:07,670
is it the purple onion look up. The
purple line is like, I think you're right.

1601
01:28:07,671 --> 01:28:10,280
But it sounds, it's one of those things,
yeah. Where you're like, the other thing,

1602
01:28:10,281 --> 01:28:12,100
we talked about it again, that
sounds wrong. You're like,

1603
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:15,010
you made that a logical immunological.
I'm,

1604
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:17,580
we're gonna open up a club called
immunological purple onion. But I, I,

1605
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:20,960
I don't know shit about the fucking San
Francisco scene anymore because the only

1606
01:28:20,961 --> 01:28:22,130
clubs that I've done are,

1607
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:26,910
the only things I've done are punchline
and I did cops I think Zach Galifianakis

1608
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:30,050
special at live of the purple
line? Yes. That's right.

1609
01:28:30,290 --> 01:28:34,640
A small price to per blended. Yeah. It
was tiny, tiny sat gone. That plays,

1610
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:35,720
I think that's not there anymore.

1611
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,780
So the like for like real
intimate spots on the road,

1612
01:28:38,781 --> 01:28:41,930
like you still have Atlanta.
Atlanta has got one of the best places.

1613
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:45,590
That's that's that's gone.

1614
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:50,690
Gone Fuck 2012 yeah,
it was called to close in 2012 God,

1615
01:28:50,691 --> 01:28:52,820
look how intimate it is.
Small.

1616
01:28:52,821 --> 01:28:56,270
It is the only other venue that's like
that that's small like that still is like

1617
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:59,990
you're talking about laughing skull is
still small. That's still tiny. Tiny.

1618
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:03,750
What does that seat like? 90 I think
they said 90 yeah, a hundred a therapist,

1619
01:29:03,751 --> 01:29:06,930
a packed out stuff and I'm in there.
I went, I was in town doing something.

1620
01:29:06,931 --> 01:29:11,010
I went over there to watch
garland to watch Jeff to
Jeff's thing. And how was it?

1621
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:12,540
It's just Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

1622
01:29:12,541 --> 01:29:17,541
Jeff is so unabashedly clear that
he's just fucking around like he was.

1623
01:29:19,291 --> 01:29:24,291
So obviously like I'm going to fucking
do this whole set about one guy and he

1624
01:29:25,081 --> 01:29:28,290
picked like picked the guy in the audience
and he the entire set about the guy

1625
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:32,510
and it was just like, I'm just
fucking around. He was having some,

1626
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:36,820
he was having tons of fun. He's a sweet
guy. He's hilarious man. He's here,

1627
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:39,950
he moves. He is, his brain moves, uh,

1628
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:42,780
very fast in a way that I
wouldn't anticipate. Right.

1629
01:29:42,781 --> 01:29:45,340
For some reason you think I,

1630
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,540
you're like this is he quick is that
he's very quick. He's a fucking,

1631
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:53,370
he's a very cool, funny dude I like
to do, but yeah, I haven't, uh,

1632
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:59,070
I don't know. I'm starting to do a
few new clubs now and in the size,

1633
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:04,230
the sizing is different and I just,
I like to be able to do bigger places,

1634
01:30:04,231 --> 01:30:06,990
but I love intimate venues, man.
A tiny, there's no way to get,

1635
01:30:06,991 --> 01:30:10,110
there's no way to get that feeling
of how when you're there all,

1636
01:30:10,111 --> 01:30:11,190
it's all different,
man.

1637
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:15,180
There's no way to get that feeling of
13,000 people either except for fucking

1638
01:30:15,181 --> 01:30:19,770
that a fucking arena. Different feel. It's
all different, man. It's all different.

1639
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:21,870
It does. It's all worth it. Yeah.

1640
01:30:21,871 --> 01:30:24,140
I think you gotta be on a
steady diet of everything. Yeah.

1641
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:28,470
It's like you don't want to be just a
carnivore and only do 13,000 seat arenas.

1642
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:30,770
You don't want to be just, who
is it? Who's your carnivore?

1643
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:33,100
Who is at Jordan Peterson?
Is that how of this? Yeah,

1644
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:34,620
he's the only one of them that I know.

1645
01:30:34,621 --> 01:30:37,740
I know several people that are
on the cardboard diet. I can't,

1646
01:30:37,741 --> 01:30:39,660
I can't get innocent because
I still like bullshit.

1647
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:42,090
I'm not going to not have
ice cream once in a while.

1648
01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:45,270
I'm not going to not have a fucking
couple of French when I'm that guy.

1649
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:49,020
I'm going to work out, but I'm also going
to have and do what the fuck I want.

1650
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:53,310
I just, I can't get on that train. I
suffered for a while doing a crazy diet.

1651
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:57,270
Would you do, I did.
I did. I did this. Um,

1652
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,810
it's almost like a circuit
likes how circuit workout is.

1653
01:31:00,811 --> 01:31:03,090
It's like circuit dieting where
it's like one week without,

1654
01:31:03,091 --> 01:31:05,790
do you know what that is?
No. Yeah, you did. You, you,

1655
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:09,960
you get rid of an element that's kind
of a vice, right. Whether it's like a,

1656
01:31:10,190 --> 01:31:11,760
and if it's a, it's gotta
be a heavy vice, right?

1657
01:31:11,761 --> 01:31:14,160
Like it's like I've high
amounts of sugar in my diet,

1658
01:31:14,161 --> 01:31:16,830
so it's like I do a week completely
without sugar and then I do a week without

1659
01:31:16,831 --> 01:31:19,920
meeting. Then I did a week without
you, I don't know, fish or whatever.

1660
01:31:19,921 --> 01:31:23,520
I kept changing what it was to find
how my body reacted to it and I fucking

1661
01:31:23,521 --> 01:31:25,950
hated it. The fucking
hated it. I was like,

1662
01:31:25,951 --> 01:31:29,940
I'm a much more balanced person up here
in my work and my writing in my exercise

1663
01:31:29,941 --> 01:31:33,930
and my sleep and my fuck life when I just
get to eat what I want. Regimented Lee,

1664
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:36,360
that's a fake word. Fuck. Life.

1665
01:31:39,510 --> 01:31:43,410
Regimented life. It's a better question.

1666
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,970
Fuck lights the name of my new album.
That's a good law.

1667
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:50,040
Now she get that tattooed across his
fuck life.

1668
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:54,930
I'm much better. Why do you
say fuck life? No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. The fuck, fuck,

1669
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,740
life. The fuck life. You know, I'm into
my fucking on the pump. Got Bug life

1670
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:05,140
regimen regimen. Mentally,
mentally. Regimentally see
that sounds fucking wrong.

1671
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:10,120
Regimental lead like I'm better off when
I just, when I do, when I just balanced,

1672
01:32:10,121 --> 01:32:12,730
when I go, I don't need that
shit. I should need that bullshit.

1673
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:16,990
And I poke in and out things
once in a while. It's, that's
just, I don't know man.

1674
01:32:16,991 --> 01:32:17,920
I think that's almost like,

1675
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:22,690
that's the only way to live for me to
wait for it to work. I've tried shit.

1676
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,200
I can't do it.
Yeah.

1677
01:32:24,630 --> 01:32:27,850
I think people like going on diets cause
it gives them something to concentrate

1678
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:30,490
too. That's what I'm saying.
I have shit going on.

1679
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:34,640
I can't worry overtly all day long about
like, is this meal going to, is like,

1680
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:35,980
how am I going to get fucked that shit.

1681
01:32:35,981 --> 01:32:38,110
But that's one of the things that
people like about it. Like, okay,

1682
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:42,310
I'm on this diet now I gotta concentrate
this. Is it like meal prep? Really? Um,

1683
01:32:42,311 --> 01:32:43,390
yeah.
Or meal prepping.

1684
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:47,040
And Sunday prepping all up inside of me
where I look at my shows in Melbourne

1685
01:32:47,050 --> 01:32:51,700
for trader, no prep. I am in control of
my world, asteroid hurdling towards us.

1686
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:56,230
I'm a complete control of him in control,
getting rocket space.

1687
01:32:56,231 --> 01:32:59,740
I have a finite lifespan.
I have to constantly eat and shit,

1688
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:03,500
but everything's fine. Everything
else is okay. Everything's fine.

1689
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:06,800
My buddy texted me today by
the way, I was, he goes, uh,

1690
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:11,170
he had a concern I talked about on
another podcast about how he couldn't,

1691
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,770
he didn't shit for like five days.
Oh.

1692
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:15,430
I have a buddy who went through that and
he went to the doctor and he has this

1693
01:33:15,431 --> 01:33:17,290
thing and he had to get help
for, he texted me, he goes,

1694
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:20,650
I just want to let you know I'm back
from vacation. I feel really good. Also,

1695
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,960
I'm shitting like normal again.
And I was like,

1696
01:33:22,961 --> 01:33:26,260
I feel like a like a really proud friend.
Like he, he was really struggling.

1697
01:33:26,261 --> 01:33:28,570
He was nervous about it. He was like,
dude, I haven't shit in like four days.

1698
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:30,820
I was like four fucking days.

1699
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:32,650
Who was the guy that had
worked with on fear factor.

1700
01:33:32,651 --> 01:33:35,360
I don't want to shame them so I won't
say his name and he wants it out there.

1701
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:40,540
Great Guy. Um, he had a real
problem, a real problem.

1702
01:33:40,541 --> 01:33:42,580
It was packed in there for days and days.

1703
01:33:42,581 --> 01:33:45,610
It wasn't coming out and he could feel
it like you could touch his bottle and

1704
01:33:45,611 --> 01:33:48,590
feel it inside. It was
hard. It's hard grows.

1705
01:33:49,150 --> 01:33:53,560
So fiber dog had to go to a doctor and
they literally had to chip it out of his

1706
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:57,520
asshole, shut the fuck allocated,
impacted it chisel in his blood hole.

1707
01:33:57,580 --> 01:34:01,600
They had to get in there and break it up
and then they had to make him take this

1708
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:04,600
like really intense laxative.

1709
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:06,760
So it takes this really intense laxative,

1710
01:34:06,761 --> 01:34:09,850
like like weapons grade
laxative and they're in,

1711
01:34:09,851 --> 01:34:12,340
they're chipping away at the stone wall,

1712
01:34:12,341 --> 01:34:16,160
which is essentially just like a
dam to keep all this shit juice.

1713
01:34:16,161 --> 01:34:17,380
It's piling up.

1714
01:34:17,530 --> 01:34:21,460
Dammed it because he's got the impacted
dried out shit that should have been out

1715
01:34:21,461 --> 01:34:23,140
of his body days ago.

1716
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:27,700
And then he's got the fresh shit
on top of that. At the top of that,

1717
01:34:27,701 --> 01:34:32,701
he's got this camera goal laxative that's
just sending off explosion the side of

1718
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:36,410
the dock.

1719
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:41,410
It was a fucking hammer hammer and a
screwdriver just whacking at the ship rock

1720
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:45,910
that's at the bottom of his asshole and
then it breaks loose and just explodes

1721
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:49,090
everywhere. Fuck. Like he
gave birth to a dead seal.

1722
01:34:49,091 --> 01:34:53,770
Just fly it out of the capsule bag.
All right, we got it. We got it.

1723
01:34:54,070 --> 01:34:56,110
How much did you, how much weight
did you lose? I don't know.

1724
01:34:56,111 --> 01:34:57,350
But he said it was awful.

1725
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:02,810
It was awful. Like they had to pry the
shit out of his ass and break it up.

1726
01:35:03,010 --> 01:35:06,740
It kind of paints pains. Those downstairs
to payments. I can't imagine from,

1727
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:11,330
you're not shitting. Yes, it's it. What's
it called? A, um, you give yourself, um,

1728
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:13,340
imagine that. What's it
called? Come on. Look it up.

1729
01:35:13,341 --> 01:35:15,650
You know what I'm talking about?
It's it now, but there's a,

1730
01:35:15,651 --> 01:35:19,440
there's a word it's called, it's like
a toxic, like toxic shock syndrome.

1731
01:35:19,441 --> 01:35:23,090
And that women get, if they leave like
a tampon into too long. Yeah. If you're,

1732
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:27,830
if you don't shit for a certain amount of
time, you, you poison yourself. Mm. Yeah.

1733
01:35:27,831 --> 01:35:29,570
It starts to leak into your
organs and shit. Something,

1734
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:33,260
it's something absurdly Gr. I just, there
was a sh, uh, one of those like, um,

1735
01:35:33,590 --> 01:35:38,510
a 600 pound life or whatever those shows
are, this woman wouldn't shit. And she,

1736
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:41,540
she, which kept holding on, holding on
and they're like, purpose. Yes. Why?

1737
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:44,450
Because she didn't want, she couldn't
move to shit. She was so fucking big,

1738
01:35:44,451 --> 01:35:47,660
she couldn't move to shit.
So the shit packed up and they were like,

1739
01:35:47,661 --> 01:35:49,460
you're gonna fucking die.
It's going to get in your bloods.

1740
01:35:49,461 --> 01:35:52,310
It's going to get in your, uh, your other
organs in your bloodstream and kill you.

1741
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:53,730
It like,

1742
01:35:54,050 --> 01:35:57,120
doesn't that freak you out when you watch
a show like that where someone's like,

1743
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:58,113
like,
uh,

1744
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,070
uh, what are those called? Hoarders,

1745
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:05,240
like a hoarder or someone who's gaining
a ton of weight or something to get

1746
01:36:05,241 --> 01:36:09,500
there, but you know, that you could get
there. You know, you couldn't get there.

1747
01:36:09,650 --> 01:36:12,450
But you know that a person could
get there. Yeah, right. You right.

1748
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:17,360
You now Andrew Santino May, 2019
you're, I are going to get there. No,

1749
01:36:17,361 --> 01:36:18,560
probably not.
You're fine.

1750
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:23,540
But some people how bad road and they
can't turn around. They're stuck.

1751
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:25,820
Yeah. And h but they compile it. Right?

1752
01:36:25,821 --> 01:36:30,110
Cause that cause the depression feeds
the hunger feeds the depression. Yeah.

1753
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,750
What does that,
that's shit constantly.

1754
01:36:32,910 --> 01:36:36,350
[inaudible] died after
feces filled bowel burst.

1755
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:39,290
Oh look how much shit there's there.

1756
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:44,600
His rectum a dilated up to 18 centimeters
inside his body and was filled with

1757
01:36:44,601 --> 01:36:46,400
feces according to the BMJ

1758
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:50,230
24 he's a child.

1759
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:55,410
24 this isn't some 80 year old man who
just is like, wow, he's autistic. Right?

1760
01:36:55,411 --> 01:37:00,130
Okay. It's chronic constipation. Oh,
okay. Well Great. Now we feel bad.

1761
01:37:00,131 --> 01:37:04,180
Jamie. Thanks. Jamie. Fox
baiting us with some shit.

1762
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:09,790
Still look at that guy and almost died
from constipation. So it's a few people.

1763
01:37:09,791 --> 01:37:14,791
Every year they had to surgically remove
two liters of poop up coca cola bottle

1764
01:37:14,801 --> 01:37:18,650
filled with poop to leaders to lead it.

1765
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:22,990
Think of a liter bottle of coke and
picking two of those fill with sand and

1766
01:37:22,991 --> 01:37:27,991
stuffed up your ass shit and your ankle
is sand leading to a lack of blood flow

1767
01:37:28,751 --> 01:37:32,590
to the leg and was pressing on his
artery, bro. Oh my God. It was,

1768
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:35,080
his shit was choking his leg out.

1769
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:39,670
That's what was happening.

1770
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:44,050
Shit was just Chinwag Army Shit Hospital
for 23 days and took 13 days for you

1771
01:37:44,051 --> 01:37:47,100
could walk again. I'm like, boy,

1772
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:52,260
no explanation has been found yet as to
explain his significant faecal loading,

1773
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:56,190
uh, loading constipation,
looking the spell, fecal

1774
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:59,800
f, a. E, c a.L is that
because they're in Australia?

1775
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:01,920
Fucking those idiots.

1776
01:38:01,970 --> 01:38:06,150
The guy was probably bang kangaroos or
something and he caught some disease.

1777
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:10,550
Those people, no time to pope. I'm
faecal loading bang and Kangaroos.

1778
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:13,470
Have you heard of that?
Um,

1779
01:38:13,770 --> 01:38:18,770
coupled that they ate a raw rat heart
from Mongolia and they got the black

1780
01:38:21,181 --> 01:38:23,910
plague. What? Yeah, they died,

1781
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:28,590
exists the black plague from
fucking fucking crazy people. Liver.

1782
01:38:28,591 --> 01:38:29,580
That's what it was.
A liver.

1783
01:38:29,730 --> 01:38:34,730
They ate a raw rat liver and
they died of the bubonic plague.

1784
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:37,230
Why did they eat it?
Take or bubonic plague?

1785
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:39,740
I think it'd be Bonac play black sounds
like it. Yeah. It's gotta be bond.

1786
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:44,040
They have a bionic play.
What's the difference? Cause
Obama plague was a bacteria,

1787
01:38:44,041 --> 01:38:48,330
right? Well what's the black plague? That
was a virus, right? Wasn't that a virus?

1788
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,690
What do you at Doctor? Not,
not anymore. I got disbarred.

1789
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:56,100
Apparently you're not going to like keep
them. You can't keep the faecal loading.

1790
01:38:56,101 --> 01:38:59,780
So you were in college. What did you think
you were going to be comedian. Really?

1791
01:38:59,860 --> 01:39:03,810
Yeah, like this is a waste of time.
It's just funny because I had my,

1792
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:07,920
my modeling throwing shown Andrew
Santino no case on his phone. Yeah.

1793
01:39:07,921 --> 01:39:10,400
Fuck that shit. One of those
gangs, the black plague was a,

1794
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:14,880
an event during a time period and the
13 hundreds and the bubonic plague is a

1795
01:39:14,881 --> 01:39:18,040
thing you can get right.
But the black plague the plague was what?

1796
01:39:18,730 --> 01:39:20,670
A viral disease that was killing people.
Right?

1797
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:25,050
So it's the bubonic plague that these
folks got and they got it from eating a

1798
01:39:25,051 --> 01:39:29,910
raw rats, heart or liver. Think it's
liver can look at us. What does this,

1799
01:39:29,911 --> 01:39:33,630
kidney, Kidney, oh, that's in high
school. Why would they kidneys?

1800
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:38,850
Is it something that you wrote? Yeah,
that's in high school. Oh my God.

1801
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:44,550
That you wanted to be a comedian and says,
I wanted to be, I want to be a queen.

1802
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:49,060
I want to stand up comic and to
work with comedy on television.

1803
01:39:51,410 --> 01:39:55,430
Yeah. I'm willing to do whatever
it takes. Make It. Yeah.

1804
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:59,540
So it says I want to do anything. I like
what I'm hearing. Whatever it takes,

1805
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:01,400
whatever it takes. Look at, I wrote below,

1806
01:40:01,401 --> 01:40:06,401
I want you to wear a track suit with
no underwear and meet me at the doc.

1807
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:10,370
Got It. We're going to get on my
yacht. You got good time. Let's go.

1808
01:40:10,371 --> 01:40:13,370
And I got a part for you
to read my script. Oh,

1809
01:40:13,490 --> 01:40:17,720
imagine some guy takes you out on
his, on his yacht. You're like, wow.

1810
01:40:17,721 --> 01:40:22,040
So you really think my tape was good.
Ah, yeah, you tape tapers. Amazing.

1811
01:40:22,070 --> 01:40:25,760
We're going to show you
that are listening. And he,

1812
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:30,590
he brings you this script and it
tells you what's required of you.

1813
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:35,330
And then you're out there in the middle
of the water bobbing around staring at

1814
01:40:35,331 --> 01:40:37,130
this guy and he got a couple of
glasses of wine. He was like,

1815
01:40:37,131 --> 01:40:40,250
I'm gonna make you a star. I
need to get my dick sucked. Okay.

1816
01:40:40,251 --> 01:40:44,000
I gotta get that Shit. I get it. I did
write in high school anything it takes.

1817
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:46,310
Now imagine being a woman
and you're in that situation.

1818
01:40:46,311 --> 01:40:48,800
You think you're gonna be able to
sweet. Talk to that guy. Right?

1819
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:53,050
That's why you were flirting with them
and that's why he got close to him. He's,

1820
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:55,240
you're going to get a part you to
play him. You got to get apart.

1821
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:58,030
Next thing you know, you're on
that ocean. Well that feels creepy.

1822
01:40:58,031 --> 01:41:01,930
That feels rapey and is rapey right?
When you're a dude, you'd be like,

1823
01:41:01,931 --> 01:41:06,730
fuck that guy fucked up. Just sacrifice
man. For the role that I'm saying.

1824
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:08,360
It's a different feeling.
Totally,

1825
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:13,180
but still dangerous because if the guy
finds out that you're not willing and

1826
01:41:13,181 --> 01:41:18,181
then you might be hostile and then he
might be hostile back like your two dudes.

1827
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:20,230
One Dude want to get his
dick sucked by a dude,

1828
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:24,520
but you're both two dudes and it's a real
hair raising situation for both of you.

1829
01:41:24,521 --> 01:41:26,530
What are your healing for
him? It's hair raising, right?

1830
01:41:26,531 --> 01:41:28,330
You tried to get this guy to
suck your Dick and the guy said,

1831
01:41:28,331 --> 01:41:29,890
I'll fucking kill you.
And you're like, Jesus.

1832
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:33,820
Now I gotta drive this guy back
in my boat. It just me and him,

1833
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:37,540
a guy who said he would kill me,
a 20 foot long little boat. Yeah.

1834
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:40,180
You got to sit while you got to make him
sit up by the bow and you'd just drive

1835
01:41:40,181 --> 01:41:44,710
quietly. Do you do jump in and log?
That's where people kill people.

1836
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:47,700
Like you know he's going to tell people.
Yeah, totally. That's how he gets good.

1837
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:49,780
That's why that's where that
kid from Iowa goes missing.

1838
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:53,320
Went to Hollywood for big dreams,
never came back, is out on the water.

1839
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,840
Cement shoes my friend put on the shoes.
Yeah,

1840
01:41:58,930 --> 01:42:00,190
I guarantee that's happened.

1841
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:03,040
But I guarantee you the guys tried to
get a guy to suck his dick and the guy

1842
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:05,230
tried to fight them and they
fought to the death academy.

1843
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:10,720
I'm sure it's happening now.
There's got to be right as we're speaking,

1844
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:15,040
there's gotta be listening to this murder.
Gay Guy is choking them to death.

1845
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:20,830
Doesn't want anyone to know. Don't go on
the boat unless you really know the guy.

1846
01:42:20,831 --> 01:42:24,570
That's my, that's my message. How well
do you know the guy, man or women,

1847
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:27,910
if the guys a producer and he takes
you on the boat, don't go on the boat.

1848
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,880
I feel like that about it. How well do
you know the guy with the boat? Not that,

1849
01:42:30,881 --> 01:42:32,290
well,
I'm not going on the guy's fucking vote.

1850
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:37,270
I was on a show once and there was
a guy who was kind of a, he was a,

1851
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:42,550
I don't want to be mean, but he was
sleazy. You're just a Hollywood.

1852
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:44,920
How's that mean? Calling out
someone for being fucking sleazy.

1853
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:49,560
Sleazebag but it's the most
stereotypical version of, ah, and uh,

1854
01:42:49,570 --> 01:42:52,000
there was a Gao who's also
working on the television shown,

1855
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:56,800
choose young and flirtatious
and next thing you know,

1856
01:42:56,980 --> 01:43:00,970
they were on his boat for the weekend
working on the script and they came back.

1857
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,610
We were like, it's like you really
just said that. Yeah, we are,

1858
01:43:04,611 --> 01:43:07,240
we're guys creatively, oh
gosh. Working creatively,

1859
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:10,210
just out in the middle of the water
the water gives me, and being at Unis,

1860
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:14,140
the water makes me feel a type of way,
but it's like normal stuff.

1861
01:43:14,141 --> 01:43:18,550
Like that's what people did for this
business. Yeah, he used to be. But Jamie,

1862
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:21,520
you wanted to bring this up because you
can sort of talking about that and we

1863
01:43:21,521 --> 01:43:26,410
never, oh, well this was a
different subject, but I'll save it.

1864
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:30,490
This is a Ed buck. Do you know
who that guy is? Like, no,

1865
01:43:30,491 --> 01:43:34,200
he's like this democratic,
uh, he's a a donor. Oh, right.

1866
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:38,830
You and I talked about were 10 to
two dudes had been found dead there,

1867
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,350
um,
from drug overdoses.

1868
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:46,480
So they'd come over and one guy said that,
what did he say?

1869
01:43:46,481 --> 01:43:48,040
That.
I don't know what they've said,

1870
01:43:48,041 --> 01:43:52,430
but like I think with him makes him do
drugs or he or he's taking them in while

1871
01:43:52,431 --> 01:43:55,230
they're already super high and
he's helping them out or something.

1872
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:57,910
They die and they ended up dying water.

1873
01:43:58,010 --> 01:44:02,010
They're claiming that he's helping two
people that I think that's what it is.

1874
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:05,500
Coincidence is maybe he's telling
the truth. Maybe like, yeah,

1875
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:09,500
he goes out there and finds really high
people keep trying to save people in the

1876
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:11,090
middle of the night. What do
you cynical bro? Yeah, Dude.

1877
01:44:11,150 --> 01:44:14,570
What do you think is happening? You want
me to take a wild guess? Yeah, I bet.

1878
01:44:14,571 --> 01:44:16,670
He goes out looking for people that
are real fucked up to get back to his

1879
01:44:16,671 --> 01:44:20,550
apartment to get some
fucking Dick. What? No Way.

1880
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:24,110
And then that side that's, and then
they say, do you have any more drugs?

1881
01:44:24,111 --> 01:44:26,030
And he goes,
you bet I got more fucking drugs.

1882
01:44:26,410 --> 01:44:31,280
They do more drugs together and they die
and he dies and he stays alive. Whoa.

1883
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:36,170
You sure? Case closed, your honor. Are you
oh directed. I rest my second gentleman.

1884
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:40,070
Mr. Buck. Okay. Well it
looks like a fine man.

1885
01:44:41,010 --> 01:44:45,170
It looks like he doesn't do anything like
he's got a nice gold tooth shining in

1886
01:44:45,171 --> 01:44:48,350
the back of his mouth. Like a, what's his
name? The wet bandits from home alone,

1887
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:51,260
investigators found multiple sex toys,

1888
01:44:51,261 --> 01:44:54,200
multiple syringes and clear
plastic bags with suspects.

1889
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:59,530
Suspected methamphetamine in a toolbox
roll cabinet in the living room.

1890
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:05,930
He's got a tool box filled with
syringes and sex toys. Let's go to work.

1891
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:11,030
Clear plastic bags with meth.
More has been homeless and how it worked.

1892
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:14,120
How it says Ma bags.

1893
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:17,480
Clear plastic bags like more than many.

1894
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,340
He's got bags of speed.

1895
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:24,110
He had been homeless and it
worked as an escort. Yeah, that's,

1896
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:28,370
he was on that Gigolo show. Season Four.
He was one of the main guy. He's the guy.

1897
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:31,790
I become addicted to.
Drugs in the Bush is the one to thank you.

1898
01:45:31,791 --> 01:45:34,190
Gave me my first
injection of crystal meth.

1899
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:38,600
I become addicted to drugs and
the worst one at that. Well,

1900
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:42,770
I don't know if that's true,
but it's crazy story that the,

1901
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:45,120
what we do know is true is two
people died over there. Yeah.

1902
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:49,010
That's fucking insane.
He's all, oh, hey man,

1903
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:53,210
it's just g is there, there's different
standards, right? Like here's,

1904
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:55,280
here's the thing,
like if that guy,

1905
01:45:55,970 --> 01:46:00,650
if he was a heterosexual guy and
two women had died at his house,

1906
01:46:01,310 --> 01:46:05,870
prison for life, what are the odds
that they wouldn't arrest him?

1907
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:11,240
Zero. Zero, zero. Zero. If one woman is
found dead in your fucking apartment,

1908
01:46:11,270 --> 01:46:12,041
yeah,
if you could,

1909
01:46:12,041 --> 01:46:14,550
we're going to go to Chris hookers
and shoot them up with meth. Yeah,

1910
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:17,910
you go to jail, go to prison.
But if you pick up mail, look,

1911
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:20,900
it's like what we were talking about
earlier. If it's a guy like, ah,

1912
01:46:20,901 --> 01:46:23,690
you're a Russian model. You came
over here to that work, Bro.

1913
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:28,220
Fuck the old ladies come on.
Like, that's true. But these guys,

1914
01:46:28,221 --> 01:46:31,040
two guys are dead and
everybody's like, Hey, you know,

1915
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:32,960
that's the fucking game they're playing.

1916
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:36,610
They Odi playing that shoot the
math game. Once you shoot Sean, you,

1917
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:40,010
he's the only killed two guys. What
the fuck? That's kind of like the, the,

1918
01:46:40,011 --> 01:46:42,230
what is it? The, uh, the, the staircase.

1919
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:45,710
You know that documentary where like two
of his wives died falling downstairs.

1920
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:50,040
Oh yeah. That's, people are like,
what? You still fucking know.

1921
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:53,490
You think two women
coincidentally magic they did.

1922
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:56,280
They're your favorite people ever
and they just kept falling and pop it

1923
01:46:56,281 --> 01:46:59,910
literally impossible. What if you're a
rock climber there? It was in his kitchen.

1924
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:05,640
Is it is fucking kitchen. Did he
throw second? Al Did it. What's this

1925
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:11,140
crazy dude? He has such a fluid.

1926
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:15,600
He said a bird flew in and scared her
and flew out of the home because there

1927
01:47:15,601 --> 01:47:16,770
wasn't no fucking bird by the way.

1928
01:47:17,370 --> 01:47:21,000
But he said a bird flu and scared her
and she fell down the stairs backwards.

1929
01:47:21,030 --> 01:47:21,863
By the way,

1930
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:24,810
you know how hard it is to fall back
down the stairs backwards when you,

1931
01:47:24,811 --> 01:47:26,220
when you're already at the top of a stair,

1932
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:29,970
nobody falls backwards when they're
walking upstairs. Kicked Sparta,

1933
01:47:29,971 --> 01:47:33,300
someone has to hit you down the that's
exactly the, the lawyer was like,

1934
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:37,170
somebody pushed you down the stairs.
That's the only way that happens. Sparta.

1935
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:39,350
Sparta,
fuck you.

1936
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:43,350
If they did an autopsy and they see the
footprint right in the middle of her

1937
01:47:43,351 --> 01:47:44,184
chest.

1938
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:47,640
Well they said the blood splatter was
like so obviously consistent with someone

1939
01:47:47,641 --> 01:47:49,850
that was like thrown downstairs.

1940
01:47:51,110 --> 01:47:54,720
Well the how will god her Bro
and these hours are doing that.

1941
01:47:54,721 --> 01:47:58,020
That is a thing that happens off fly
into your home. They fucked shit up.

1942
01:47:58,190 --> 01:48:01,590
They're not good guests. They're
not nice people. Assholes. Yeah.

1943
01:48:01,591 --> 01:48:03,270
They really are truly not nice.

1944
01:48:03,860 --> 01:48:07,400
There's such a cool animal. Yeah, they
are. They're a weird animal that we like.

1945
01:48:07,401 --> 01:48:11,430
Think of them as these wise
old creatures. Like we, we,

1946
01:48:11,431 --> 01:48:15,980
we have like an anthropomorphic version
of an owl. Yeah. That's really smart.

1947
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:19,710
Like an owl is like, well
yeah, like read off the, uh,

1948
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:23,390
find out what's going on. The tootsie
pop owl. How many licks does it take?

1949
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:27,450
That was like he wore glasses.
Yeah. Well that must be what it did.

1950
01:48:27,470 --> 01:48:31,970
But the wise old owl is like
an adage, right? Yeah. Why
is it though? I Dunno man.

1951
01:48:31,971 --> 01:48:33,320
Because they're fucking ruthless.

1952
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:38,690
What they are is just cunts that's
swooped down and kill rabbits. Rabbits up,

1953
01:48:38,691 --> 01:48:41,780
man. They're wingspans are fucking
incredible. When you see them take off,

1954
01:48:41,781 --> 01:48:43,430
take flight and it comes snag something.
It's,

1955
01:48:43,530 --> 01:48:47,720
it's wild to safe driving home once and
one was flying over my head and I guess

1956
01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:52,750
it didn't like how low it was as
to where my car was on the road.

1957
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,990
Like hit had picked a path
probably not in its head.

1958
01:48:56,991 --> 01:49:01,360
Understanding the cars go down this
road. Right. It was flying. Right, right.

1959
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:03,080
And the car was just too close.

1960
01:49:03,081 --> 01:49:05,990
Who just dropped the rabbit
and went to get it later.

1961
01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:09,320
I pulled over cause I'm like, what
the fuck was that? Because it was big.

1962
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:13,220
Like whatever it dropped was
a fairly large creature and a,

1963
01:49:13,221 --> 01:49:16,880
I went over in this rabbit that was just
gutted because the first thing they eat

1964
01:49:16,881 --> 01:49:20,240
is the guts. Right. So to just
torn the guts out of this rabbit,

1965
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:24,230
they pick it apart and then they take the
rest home with them. They swooped down.

1966
01:49:24,231 --> 01:49:27,830
Have you ever seen a, an OWL's clause?
Yeah, they're fucking nasty. Either.

1967
01:49:27,831 --> 01:49:32,540
Huge giant ass clause that the
coolest video. Look at that thing.

1968
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:37,010
Look at the closet that they're bad ass.
Dude, I mean, God, it's an amazing one.

1969
01:49:37,011 --> 01:49:39,470
Predator. The first picture, it looks
like him saying don't take a picture.

1970
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:42,320
And in the second one he's like,
why did you take the fucking,

1971
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:46,670
I told you not to make a pitch cause
it's like mad at you and she's picking it

1972
01:49:46,671 --> 01:49:48,100
up.
Look at the eyes

1973
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,510
in that thing, man. I mean,

1974
01:49:49,511 --> 01:49:54,190
it has a demonic face that's
like beautiful Predator man.

1975
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:57,850
It's an incredible animal.
Um, but look at that one.

1976
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:01,210
There's an amazing video
online of one killing hawk.

1977
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:06,190
It kills a hawk in its, in its
nest. It swoops down in the night.

1978
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:09,070
They got a trail camera,
Frodo. They had these, this,

1979
01:50:09,071 --> 01:50:12,730
these hawks that were in this nest
and these a wildlife biologist.

1980
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:15,990
We're filming it and
this, this ego, this uh,

1981
01:50:16,130 --> 01:50:20,290
owl comes in and watch this and just
snatches the Hawk right from the nest.

1982
01:50:20,291 --> 01:50:22,360
Watch this.
Here comes in the distance.

1983
01:50:22,361 --> 01:50:26,690
You'll see it's a little eyes any second
now it's crazy shit to watch the little

1984
01:50:26,691 --> 01:50:30,670
baby Haka. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A little baby. Look at that.

1985
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:35,620
Watch this motherfucker come in and
look at this like, Oh shit bitch, whoa,

1986
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:41,140
fuck, that's a wrap. Son snatched it.
I'll get the mom is like, what happened?

1987
01:50:41,141 --> 01:50:42,820
What happened? I don't even
know what. That's a mom.

1988
01:50:42,821 --> 01:50:46,300
That might also be another
baby. It's pretty big though.
Yeah. It's hard to tell.

1989
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:48,610
It's hard to tell because we don't
have a perspective. But look at this.

1990
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:50,630
Look how it snatches it.
Bang.

1991
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:54,430
Just to hand look all
the feathers of fly off.

1992
01:50:54,490 --> 01:50:57,430
Two hands grabbing a hold.

1993
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:01,420
I don't know why that freaks me out so
much now. That freaks me the fuck out.

1994
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:06,010
Bird on bird. Violences weird, crazy
dude. It is bird lives matter man.

1995
01:51:06,190 --> 01:51:09,940
But it's bird on bird violence is strange
cause it's almost like a cannibalism.

1996
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:15,310
It's, it happens so often. Yeah. Is Jack
Birds because they don't give a fuck.

1997
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:18,520
It doesn't matter. They don't give a fuck.
But do you think that's a last resort?

1998
01:51:18,521 --> 01:51:20,860
Kind of. They don't really want
to eat other birds, right, bro?

1999
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:23,350
Everybody eats birds or the next picture.
Even birds.

2000
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:26,590
It's a bird swallowing
chick. Yeah, look at it.

2001
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:30,700
Look at it bucking and it's his throat.
Fuck what a Twat.

2002
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:36,510
Fuck. That's a fucking whole
duck. That's huge. Yeah. Yeah.

2003
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,030
Look at that thing. That
is huge. Well it's a check.

2004
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:44,650
It's not a fully grown duck but,
but it's big.

2005
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:47,650
It's big enough that it's crazy
that that thinks swallows it.

2006
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:50,740
You know the one of the really
fucked up ones and I saw a recently,

2007
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:56,140
I saw a toad eat a rat or
a mouse. I totally want to
see that. Your mouse? Yeah.

2008
01:51:56,141 --> 01:51:58,150
He's either frog or a toad.
I don't know what it was.

2009
01:51:58,151 --> 01:52:02,950
But a big ass green frog looking
type creature swallowed a mouse hole.

2010
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:06,160
Watch this. This is it. Yeah. This
is crazy dude. Oh this is not,

2011
01:52:06,161 --> 01:52:09,730
it does not it because this one is hidden.

2012
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:11,260
There's one that's not hidden.

2013
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:16,240
There's one where you could see it
like in like a little glass container.

2014
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:22,210
Damn. I wish I could find it.
Um, cause it's a really good one.

2015
01:52:22,211 --> 01:52:26,650
It's from like a top down view.
That's pretty good. Watch this.

2016
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:31,150
I didn't think that frogs ate mice, man.
I used to think the frogs are like, oh,

2017
01:52:31,151 --> 01:52:34,930
you know, they just get bugs, bugs out of
the air watch. He's just waiting. Not yet.

2018
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:38,950
Not yet. I want to make sure I get them.
Making sure. Yeah. I'm sniff around. Oh,

2019
01:52:38,951 --> 01:52:42,460
you're close to maybe move a
little baby move. I'm on you.

2020
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:47,390
And as soon as I decide you're lined up,

2021
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:51,970
fuck you. Look at that
head first. Just lead it,

2022
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:54,980
stuffing it in there with
his greedy little fingers.

2023
01:52:57,290 --> 01:52:59,750
I mean think about what a pro,
get them a house trying to get out.

2024
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:02,800
The mouse is trying to get out
because they don't have teeth. Right?

2025
01:53:02,801 --> 01:53:05,930
So they just got to swallow that.
Get Out. Its head is out, man. Look,

2026
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:10,940
it's eating ass asshole first.
Jesus Christ. The mouse is
like, let me just let me,

2027
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:11,990
I'm just curious me.

2028
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:14,630
But I guess eat the butthole first
cause that's the worst taste.

2029
01:53:14,631 --> 01:53:18,590
So it gets a bad taste out of how they're
thinking. That's just where it was.

2030
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:21,140
I think it would have eaten it
head first too. But look at it.

2031
01:53:21,141 --> 01:53:23,750
It's just blinking slowly
swallowing the mouse.

2032
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:26,840
Imagine you being able to eat a dog.

2033
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:29,480
That's what that's like
the size difference.

2034
01:53:29,481 --> 01:53:30,880
That's like you eating a German shepherd,

2035
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:34,610
German shepherd and just stuffing anymore
face. Dislocating my jaw putting it in.

2036
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:36,920
How big is a frog's mouth?
That's crazy,

2037
01:53:37,090 --> 01:53:39,560
but that's I guess when you see those
things I can dislocate their jaws.

2038
01:53:39,561 --> 01:53:42,290
I think that's incredible. Animals
that can fucking unhinged their job.

2039
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:45,470
Snakes and snakes, that shit.
These are fasting charts.

2040
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:48,260
Found them in California
again off the class after.

2041
01:53:48,261 --> 01:53:50,810
They haven't been here for 30 years and
they just weren't showing up again off

2042
01:53:50,830 --> 01:53:52,640
San Francisco Center or whatever.

2043
01:53:52,730 --> 01:53:56,660
What the fuck they they swim through
like little schools of fish and they just

2044
01:53:56,661 --> 01:54:01,310
swallow. I've seen that. It's
a basking shark. Giant mouth.
Yeah. Wild looking thing.

2045
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:05,540
Just like a funnel for the ocean. How many
bottle caps are those things? Swallow?

2046
01:54:05,770 --> 01:54:09,350
Yeah. He was like, what you want to talk
about? Plastic straws, 30 feet long.

2047
01:54:09,351 --> 01:54:14,351
Imagine what kind of shit impacted
like six pack tops are assholes.

2048
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:22,160
So many old cans of Colin Miller lite
blood streaming out of their asshole in

2049
01:54:22,161 --> 01:54:24,310
this shit. Those things.
Got It. They'll say,

2050
01:54:24,311 --> 01:54:26,270
you've got to be able to handle
anything after all these years.

2051
01:54:26,271 --> 01:54:28,030
They've swallowed so much bullshit.
Yeah.

2052
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:32,900
Boots and fucking license plates
to build both parts. Bones,

2053
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:37,580
all that shit. Yeah. Creepy shift
from the bottom of the fucking ocean.

2054
01:54:37,581 --> 01:54:41,630
Whale found dead with 13 pounds of
plastic in its stomach. Holy Shit.

2055
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:46,930
13 pounds were so gross.
So there was a guy named that.

2056
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:50,240
You see that? What does this
flip flops and 115 drinking cup.

2057
01:54:50,241 --> 01:54:52,280
They can't say red solo cups,
but that's what that is.

2058
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:57,380
People out there partying far down on
that boat and I'm sperm whales. Wow. Damn,

2059
01:54:57,410 --> 01:55:00,110
that's fucked up. And flip flops.
I've probably had one of those flip.

2060
01:55:00,170 --> 01:55:02,650
I've lost so many pairs. I'm one of
mine is in his sperm whales. Oh Wow.

2061
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:05,750
Did you see the video? That Beluga
whale returning the girl's cell phone?

2062
01:55:06,530 --> 01:55:10,730
What you did? Okay. Yeah. It's
fucking, if they set this up,

2063
01:55:10,731 --> 01:55:14,420
it would have been an amazing setup.
But I'll show you the video. Whoa.

2064
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:16,700
Returning a girl south.
You Go.

2065
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:19,400
The whale understands
objects are important to you.

2066
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:23,390
She knows I phones are expensive and it
was how far it got dropped down in the

2067
01:55:23,391 --> 01:55:26,330
water. But you know, pull it up here.
It's going all over Instagram and Twitter.

2068
01:55:26,331 --> 01:55:29,990
You can use the find the video. I mean
it's coming from the depths of the water.

2069
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:35,170
So like I don't know how the fuck this
and fuck I fucking God holding onto her

2070
01:55:35,571 --> 01:55:40,140
phone and it brings it up.
Like I don't know how you would fake that.

2071
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:43,920
Well I they don't look like trainers.
It doesn't look like it's in like a,

2072
01:55:43,950 --> 01:55:44,401
you know what I mean?

2073
01:55:44,401 --> 01:55:47,940
Like it looks like it's in the water and
it says it's the one that was captured

2074
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:50,970
last week. I don't know if that
the same one. That's the part.

2075
01:55:50,971 --> 01:55:54,240
I think he was fake about it, but, oh,
how do they know? How would they know?

2076
01:55:54,241 --> 01:55:55,680
It's the same one,
but the ones that have it.

2077
01:55:56,250 --> 01:56:00,020
I think that that's how I initially
saw the story and I don't lie.

2078
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:03,240
Don't believe that they're tagged
and tracked. And I the white whale,

2079
01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:06,030
the white whale that we posted about
last week, well it stuck around.

2080
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:09,210
He's been staying at Hammerfest and then
for, well maybe it's a different one.

2081
01:56:09,810 --> 01:56:13,080
Yeah. Maybe it's a whale that they saw
and not the one that was captured with the

2082
01:56:13,290 --> 01:56:16,000
harness. I think that's what's
wrong. They're just, well,

2083
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:19,140
what did they post about last week? Go
to, they'll go to there. That's the one.

2084
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:22,820
This is where that story came from
and know that's the part why I was so,

2085
01:56:22,830 --> 01:56:27,580
it is the same story. Yeah, it's
trained. It's a trained well, yeah.

2086
01:56:27,870 --> 01:56:30,360
Maybe you wanted food, man. Yeah, I just
thought it was going to get something.

2087
01:56:30,361 --> 01:56:33,090
Fish. Bitch. She, that's so
funny out there. Here's your
phone she had, they're like,

2088
01:56:33,091 --> 01:56:36,480
thank you. And he's like, no bitch fucking
feet. And he's just like the monkeys,

2089
01:56:36,481 --> 01:56:40,470
man. Give Up. Give up the
foods. You Bitch. That's what
I've come to steal from you.

2090
01:56:40,471 --> 01:56:41,400
I'm stealing.
Oh,

2091
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:45,030
that was the other thing that we got
Margarita's and we left like a pitcher of

2092
01:56:45,031 --> 01:56:49,050
Margaritas out and they dumped the
picture over and drank the Margarita.

2093
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:53,490
They like to party. So the monkeys
are probably partying on our porch.

2094
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:58,110
They'll leave Margarita's out. Dude.
They're gonna fucking say hammered.

2095
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:00,900
They get wasted. They must get so
hammered like a picture of mark.

2096
01:57:00,901 --> 01:57:03,750
I don't know how much they lapped
up after it spilled. Right.

2097
01:57:03,751 --> 01:57:07,050
I imagine they probably just drank
every drop. There was nothing left.

2098
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:11,050
They knocked over the pitcher and some
of it must have stayed in the picture and

2099
01:57:11,051 --> 01:57:12,180
these are like,
this is what we want.

2100
01:57:12,210 --> 01:57:14,820
And they started drinking it and they
knock on your door like you have salt.

2101
01:57:15,150 --> 01:57:17,640
You guys didn't live in the fucking
salt out. Okay. He's drinking. Yeah,

2102
01:57:17,641 --> 01:57:22,150
he's boost out. They drink booze. This
is crazy. Drunk monkeys call Nicola.

2103
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:26,810
They love Coca Cola. Oh yeah, look at
him. He doesn't know how to drink those.

2104
01:57:26,850 --> 01:57:30,590
Anything with sugar. They love sugar
shifts to Fau. He's hammered. Look at him.

2105
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:34,740
Oh there. Put a draw. Oh my God. There's
videos of drunk monkeys there. Fucked up.

2106
01:57:34,741 --> 01:57:39,690
Look at him. They gave him wrestle
these fall down. That's hilarious.

2107
01:57:40,230 --> 01:57:44,130
Oh that people spill it off of drinks
that they're licking it off. Check tables.

2108
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:48,540
If I had a monkey, I get him drunk every
day. Me and that monkey, we just party.

2109
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:51,840
If everything goes totally south with me,
you're going to find me on key west.

2110
01:57:51,841 --> 01:57:55,410
Live in like those psycho white people
just drinking with monkeys going to be

2111
01:57:55,420 --> 01:57:58,710
messy. Yeah. It'll be the next one. Just
like that. But I'll stay in America.

2112
01:57:58,740 --> 01:58:01,440
Make girls poop in your mind. I
don't think he does that, bro.

2113
01:58:01,441 --> 01:58:02,760
And you should stop saying that he did.

2114
01:58:02,761 --> 01:58:07,590
Key West is a key West Key West is the
furthest you can get and still be in

2115
01:58:07,591 --> 01:58:09,600
America.
Is it rather than Alaska?

2116
01:58:10,010 --> 01:58:12,420
Some of the most ridiculous
thing to call that America.

2117
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:15,360
That's like not even connected to Florida
and there are those people that live

2118
01:58:15,361 --> 01:58:17,850
down there. They might as well be ex
pats living on an island somewhere.

2119
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:22,110
That's what it is. Right. Hurricane there.
Every 13 days they'd just get wiped out.

2120
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:24,570
The southern most point.
Yeah, southern most point.

2121
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:28,000
But I mean it's not just that they're
there, the keys. They're islands. Yeah.

2122
01:58:28,001 --> 01:58:31,620
I think you have to drive over land
like they're not really America. No,

2123
01:58:31,621 --> 01:58:34,710
it's its own little thing. It's like
Puerto Rico. The US Virgin Islands. Yeah.

2124
01:58:34,711 --> 01:58:37,620
Get the fuck out of here. How do we
own Guam? Yeah. How? What's that?

2125
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:40,800
What does that to us there? Yeah.
That's way away from Hawaii.

2126
01:58:41,190 --> 01:58:42,130
It takes forever to get

2127
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:42,520
there.

2128
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:47,200
How do we get this fucking far
Hawaii's five hours by jet?

2129
01:58:48,930 --> 01:58:53,500
No, no, no. This is America.
America. I liked that.

2130
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:55,100
I liked that we protect Hawaii,

2131
01:58:55,140 --> 01:58:59,050
but I think Hawaii is its own fucking
thing that those people were on their own

2132
01:58:59,051 --> 01:59:02,380
country and you know what would happen
immediately. Mushrooms should be legal.

2133
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:05,770
That'd be the place to party. They voted
this week. A bunch of places voted.

2134
01:59:05,771 --> 01:59:07,710
Denver tried. Yeah. Denver
didn't make it though.

2135
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:10,180
47% I think setting those old ranchers,

2136
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:11,920
those old ranchers came
out of the mountain.

2137
01:59:11,921 --> 01:59:14,030
Those farmers actually do
it on the way here. I saw,

2138
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:17,590
I saw hilarious on the bed of a
truck on the back of a truck window,

2139
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:22,360
had a big thing that says what's going
on and it said it had a pot leaf and it

2140
01:59:22,361 --> 01:59:26,800
said legal and then it had a hose
watering a lawn and it said, illegal.

2141
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:31,360
What's going on? Oh my God, look
into it. That's what he's saying.

2142
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:35,200
What's going on. Dumb ass
called the drought. Fuck.
What's in the draft went away.

2143
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:40,430
You can grow water conserving water.
You fuck head fuck coupons,

2144
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:42,760
plants.
Fuck you can eat it had hey easy.

2145
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:47,050
She about the guy in Florida that got
arrested because he would not take I eat

2146
01:59:47,051 --> 01:59:49,720
ass off the back when we were
talking about that I eat ass.

2147
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:52,450
You eat ass said on
the back of his window.

2148
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:56,890
He said it is his first amendment right
to let everyone know that he eats ass.

2149
01:59:56,920 --> 02:00:00,100
It is. Yeah, but that's a funny
thing. Imagine if that's your boy.

2150
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:04,030
You have this little baby sucking on your
nipple and you're like my cute little

2151
02:00:04,031 --> 02:00:05,710
boy.
He's adorable.

2152
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,920
Oh my little Billy wants to play baseball
but he doesn't like getting up early

2153
02:00:08,921 --> 02:00:10,150
and he misses a lot of practice.

2154
02:00:10,150 --> 02:00:12,040
He got cut from the team and
now he's kind of depressed.

2155
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:15,310
He just plays Madden all
day and in one day bill,

2156
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:19,030
he's got a pickup truck and Billy's
pickup trucks as I, he asked, right?

2157
02:00:19,330 --> 02:00:22,780
You come home and he's still living at
your house cause he's a fucking loser and

2158
02:00:22,781 --> 02:00:26,650
you come home and you see a little Billy
with his I eat ass and do you really

2159
02:00:26,651 --> 02:00:30,920
need to have that on your truck
and I drive what I do do more.

2160
02:00:31,660 --> 02:00:36,420
That's how I get my ass to eat. A lot
of guys don't put our dudes who I love.

2161
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:40,960
I know I do. I do. I do.

2162
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:44,050
I and the dad is like, I still
support them and I love him very much.

2163
02:00:44,051 --> 02:00:44,890
I also eat ass.

2164
02:00:45,250 --> 02:00:48,670
Got It from your mom and you're driving
on the highway and you're stuck in

2165
02:00:48,671 --> 02:00:52,750
bumper to bumper traffic with e ass in
front of you for an hour. We'd laugh.

2166
02:00:52,751 --> 02:00:55,810
My mom would laugh. My mom would get
mad at me for staying in the same lane.

2167
02:00:56,910 --> 02:01:00,570
Watch here in this lane because you think
it's funny that I have to look at eat

2168
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:04,120
ass. I didn't say that mom. I did
not say that. It is funny though.

2169
02:01:04,330 --> 02:01:06,250
You think it's funny.
It is very funny.

2170
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:08,200
Do you think it's funny because
my story about that guy,

2171
02:01:08,201 --> 02:01:10,630
I know you'd think it was,
I think it was more positive than that.

2172
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:16,320
I think he wanted to let people know that
he eats ass because he's got this ma,

2173
02:01:16,810 --> 02:01:19,300
he's got an, I don't know if you know him,
but we know him. I know him very well.

2174
02:01:19,301 --> 02:01:20,440
Jamie and I know him very well,

2175
02:01:20,740 --> 02:01:24,100
but he's got this half of his tongue
was bid off by a dog when he was young,

2176
02:01:24,460 --> 02:01:28,660
so he knows how to eat ass rough. Yeah,
he's got it wrong at the end of it.

2177
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:32,020
A little bit. Yeah. He knows how to flip
it around. Move. He's good at eating ass.

2178
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:35,230
But I think people for years where
like you can't eat ass anymore Mike.

2179
02:01:35,290 --> 02:01:37,090
And he was like,
fuck you guys man.

2180
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:39,860
What are you trying to say to
another Florida Man Story? Eating ass

2181
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:43,700
man arrested after caught eating
ass inside toys r US store.

2182
02:01:43,730 --> 02:01:46,460
That's why they closed down.
That's why they're not in business.

2183
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:50,430
That's a bold move. Little kids in
there. Oh, I know what I saw it.

2184
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:54,890
So around here somewhere it
said the thing that game is,

2185
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:58,010
there's a monkey on the cover and he's
got a hammer. He's trying to whack

2186
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:02,980
the moles and there's guys
in this girl's pug guys,

2187
02:02:03,030 --> 02:02:06,000
he didn't girls poop.
Mommy,

2188
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:09,750
you imagine if you saw a dude
eating an asshole underwear,

2189
02:02:10,770 --> 02:02:14,240
middle of toys r us. You're walking
around with your kid. Go, she'll,

2190
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:16,260
but should we get,
what should we get a wiffle ball bat?

2191
02:02:16,290 --> 02:02:18,580
You want to play wiffle ball football?

2192
02:02:19,590 --> 02:02:23,540
And he tried to call
it and then a girl and

2193
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:27,950
she goes, get out of here. Well, down a
rabbit hole with this one with ass eating.

2194
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:28,611
Yeah,
man.

2195
02:02:28,611 --> 02:02:33,050
Who ripped out girlfriends intestines
for yelling her husband's name during sex

2196
02:02:33,051 --> 02:02:35,720
gets life in prison.
Makes perfect sense.

2197
02:02:35,750 --> 02:02:40,250
What man who ripped out his girlfriend's
intestines for yelling at that point?

2198
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:44,900
I get mad. Fidel Lopez told investigators,
I get really, really mad. He,

2199
02:02:45,300 --> 02:02:48,980
he ripped out her intestine for
yelling out her husband's name,

2200
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:53,180
but that's a complicated story.
Awesome. Florida. Oh no shit.

2201
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:55,940
She called me the name
of the other fucking guy.

2202
02:02:55,941 --> 02:02:59,480
He told investigators after September,

2203
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:03,650
2015 murder and she said it twice and
she was wrong and she was confusing me

2204
02:03:03,651 --> 02:03:07,130
with him at that point. I get mad. I would
get really, really mad. Oh Jesus Christ.

2205
02:03:07,190 --> 02:03:10,790
As the 31 year old lay stricken,
he shoved objects into Miss Nemesis,

2206
02:03:10,791 --> 02:03:13,700
vagina and anus, including a beer
bottle of hair, iron, even his fist.

2207
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:17,840
And this is not, this guy's a psycho.
This is not something I needed to see.

2208
02:03:17,990 --> 02:03:21,450
Let a piece of me, Jesus Channel
is go. Are you reading about this?

2209
02:03:21,470 --> 02:03:23,930
Is something wrong with you? Where
do you find that stuff, Jamie?

2210
02:03:23,931 --> 02:03:28,160
Why do you go looking for your
saved pages? We'll try to sell you.

2211
02:03:28,350 --> 02:03:32,510
This is the images of I eat asked Florida
man, and I just started scrolling down.

2212
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:35,750
Okay,
we go to Jamie's like Google ads.

2213
02:03:35,751 --> 02:03:40,610
It's all duck tape and crowbars and
shit. Hey, what's up with all this up,

2214
02:03:40,630 --> 02:03:42,290
all the handsaws on on man.

2215
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:44,570
This is how you know that even
when you clear your search engine,

2216
02:03:44,571 --> 02:03:47,420
it doesn't matter because I
clear my shit sometimes and,

2217
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:50,510
and even if I want to go back to porn hub,
it's still knows my suggested shit.

2218
02:03:51,110 --> 02:03:55,430
So creepy look into it.
Time to look into it,

2219
02:03:55,431 --> 02:03:59,900
time to look into the porn. That's where
there, where people are making money.

2220
02:03:59,930 --> 02:04:04,930
It's from cookies and like using your
information and your data and finding out

2221
02:04:06,501 --> 02:04:10,130
what you're interested in selling
it to advertisers. It's all very,

2222
02:04:10,131 --> 02:04:13,940
very sorted stuff to Zuckerberg
has got us, dude. Yeah,

2223
02:04:13,941 --> 02:04:18,370
there was a car parked
us. I mean it's just this,

2224
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:23,390
a lot of it's weird that that sort of
escaped the imagination of people that

2225
02:04:24,831 --> 02:04:26,510
were like looking towards the future.

2226
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:30,350
Like they didn't think that data
would be so valuable. Nobody really,

2227
02:04:30,650 --> 02:04:35,000
nobody really saw that 20 years ago when
the Internet was first coming alive.

2228
02:04:35,001 --> 02:04:38,520
Like nobody ever thought they'd be
able to like check your searches.

2229
02:04:39,090 --> 02:04:43,320
Like when they figured out how to make
a search engine then tied it into what

2230
02:04:43,321 --> 02:04:48,300
you're searching for and selling that to
advertisers. God, it's genius, but it's,

2231
02:04:49,350 --> 02:04:53,070
it's crazy that they can make so much
money. It's like you were talking about,

2232
02:04:53,130 --> 02:04:56,460
well, it's not right that you can make
so much money telling jokes. Well,

2233
02:04:56,461 --> 02:04:57,690
it's really not right.

2234
02:04:58,060 --> 02:05:01,830
You make so much money providing a
search engine off of the materials that

2235
02:05:01,831 --> 02:05:04,680
you've searched, what you're
supposedly, you're protected by, right?

2236
02:05:04,681 --> 02:05:07,890
You're supposed to think that
your searches are protected,
but on one hand, right,

2237
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:10,920
like it's cool because you get all
this data, you get to this information,

2238
02:05:11,190 --> 02:05:14,250
but you know, you could literally
find out any answer to any question.

2239
02:05:14,251 --> 02:05:17,010
We do it all the time. Yeah. But
then the other part it's like, well,

2240
02:05:17,011 --> 02:05:21,600
what am I giving up? You get to now
they know what you like, what kind of,

2241
02:05:21,601 --> 02:05:23,930
what things you're thinking about
buying or what you are interested,

2242
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:26,850
interested in, what movies
you like. They know that.

2243
02:05:26,851 --> 02:05:28,460
So they start selling you that I like,

2244
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:32,850
oh well I guess I want them to sell it
to me. That's is what I like. Kind of.

2245
02:05:32,851 --> 02:05:36,360
It is a nice car. Wow. Look at that. All
right. Hit that movie does look good.

2246
02:05:36,720 --> 02:05:39,330
You know, and then you're like, oh my
Google is really working out well for me.

2247
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:40,800
You want to become
autonomous with the machine.

2248
02:05:40,830 --> 02:05:45,090
It's just a big net as casting out
and just think if they put a chip in.

2249
02:05:45,091 --> 02:05:47,330
You mentioned you cool with the chip.
I've got one already,

2250
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:52,200
but you've got the chip dot. Which,
which version though? Um, 2.6.

2251
02:05:52,470 --> 02:05:56,300
I don't know. I don't ask.
Just chip, chip me up dog.

2252
02:05:57,390 --> 02:06:02,160
You got to go to Langley, Virginia. You
go to where they kept Hannibal Lecter.

2253
02:06:02,190 --> 02:06:05,850
That's how they chip you. Chip you out
then Langley you got to go to the FBI,

2254
02:06:05,950 --> 02:06:10,110
but they have to know you're okay. I'll
get you a cool chip. May Dude, I'll chip.

2255
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:14,910
Shut me the fuck up. What
would it take for you to, uh,
get chipped? Like for real,

2256
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:18,660
if there was a chip and it provided
your gps tracking everywhere you go,

2257
02:06:18,661 --> 02:06:23,460
but you could read people's minds so the
government knew where you were all the

2258
02:06:23,461 --> 02:06:27,810
time. They do. But everybody else that had
a chip in it, you could read their mind.

2259
02:06:27,870 --> 02:06:29,640
Like you could see their intentions.
You could,

2260
02:06:29,641 --> 02:06:32,700
you could find out if they're upset, you
can find out the rational or irrational.

2261
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:37,370
Maybe you could even show them the error
of their ways with your thoughts. Oh,

2262
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:38,520
I don't want to just take that shit.

2263
02:06:38,521 --> 02:06:40,410
I want to know people's head
already know where you're at, man.

2264
02:06:40,411 --> 02:06:42,090
They've got your fucking phone.
They can have that.

2265
02:06:42,091 --> 02:06:44,730
I don't want to know what's going on it
like Jamie's had legal want to know is

2266
02:06:44,731 --> 02:06:48,680
fine. You know he's thinking
about right now food. Yeah.

2267
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:53,040
It's like three of 20. You're gonna have
to move. We upgrade almost. Oh yeah.

2268
02:06:53,070 --> 02:06:56,640
That is like what it was like, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Remember why he got it.

2269
02:06:56,641 --> 02:07:00,930
But um, he was, he was
shot in a w spoiler alert.

2270
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:04,980
He was shot in like a robbery
by armed gang members.

2271
02:07:04,981 --> 02:07:06,480
They shot him and paralyzed him.

2272
02:07:06,481 --> 02:07:10,830
And then this guy brought him back to
life with this chip in his spine that

2273
02:07:10,831 --> 02:07:15,390
regenerated spinal tissue and gave him
super powers and the new Kung Fu and all

2274
02:07:15,391 --> 02:07:19,890
kinds of other shit. Shit.
Me Dude. Yeah. John Carpay.

2275
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:23,310
Jamie can out of here with me. You're
distracting the shit out of me today.

2276
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:28,020
What's going on with you? I say
chip me up. Shut me the fuck up.

2277
02:07:28,410 --> 02:07:30,240
What do you about you, Jamie?
What'd you get distracted?

2278
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:33,500
If you had a chip inside of you, would
you think about it all the time? Yeah.

2279
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:35,890
The neural links scares the shit out of
him at the, basically the same thing,

2280
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:36,130
right?

2281
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:38,040
If you're wearing it? Yeah. Oh, you,

2282
02:07:38,050 --> 02:07:40,420
but do you think you'd like
that would become like,

2283
02:07:40,421 --> 02:07:44,410
you would think about that chip
all the time? No. No. You probably,

2284
02:07:44,450 --> 02:07:45,460
you'd definitely forget about it.

2285
02:07:46,540 --> 02:07:48,190
Forget about anything else
that you have and that you,

2286
02:07:48,191 --> 02:07:50,660
you forget about this thing that
this tracking device on a car,

2287
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:52,510
as long as you could pick
it up and put it down,

2288
02:07:52,910 --> 02:07:56,170
but do you feel like you're
not really connected to,
yeah. No, you absolutely are.

2289
02:07:56,740 --> 02:07:58,780
But if you had something inside
of you, you'd be like, Ooh,

2290
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:03,810
pull out when I really went for it. Okay.
The chip. Are you talking to it? Yeah.

2291
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:08,860
I want to talk to it. The upgrade to
turn on my car. Get directions to Joe's.

2292
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:11,880
Yeah, forget about it. Then it's close
to it, man. You have a, then you just,

2293
02:08:11,890 --> 02:08:13,780
then it becomes one with you.
It's not like you're thinking about it.

2294
02:08:13,781 --> 02:08:16,630
You're just acting. You're woke you up
in the middle of night. He'd be pissed.

2295
02:08:17,020 --> 02:08:18,940
Why would it wake me up?
I told him not to.

2296
02:08:19,180 --> 02:08:22,480
You know what I've been doing with a
Siri lately. The dumb bitch don't use it.

2297
02:08:22,690 --> 02:08:26,890
I tell her what to do. Um, I
make her make a notes for me.

2298
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:31,780
Uh, so I go, Hey Siri, make a note
and what would you like to say

2299
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:36,890
exactly right there. Whose phone
was that? Mine or yours or yours?

2300
02:08:38,810 --> 02:08:43,130
See that
she created a note.

2301
02:08:43,990 --> 02:08:48,290
She's listening to you, dude.
Hey, here we go. Hey Siri.

2302
02:08:48,410 --> 02:08:51,530
Make a note.
What do you want it to say?

2303
02:08:53,350 --> 02:08:56,350
Andrew Santino was the
last of the great gingers.

2304
02:08:59,070 --> 02:09:03,960
Okay. I created a note. Andrew Santino
was the last of the great changes.

2305
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:07,320
That's a good, that was pretty,
beautified it out. She's pretty good.

2306
02:09:07,380 --> 02:09:10,920
You change was to, is did
you say is she did that. See,

2307
02:09:10,980 --> 02:09:14,640
but it's good enough for
me if I have ideas. If I'm
driving around, I have ideas.

2308
02:09:14,670 --> 02:09:19,560
I just tell Siri to do my dirty work
for me. It's the best I got. It's like,

2309
02:09:19,590 --> 02:09:22,110
it's made me capture so many more ideas.

2310
02:09:22,111 --> 02:09:24,150
I would never be able to capture
cause I'm driving. It's just funny.

2311
02:09:24,151 --> 02:09:25,380
I thought there was in
the shower the other day,

2312
02:09:25,381 --> 02:09:28,050
I spend an inordinate amount
of time thinking in the shower.

2313
02:09:28,051 --> 02:09:31,710
I really enjoy thinking in the shower
because it's really quiet and I'll sit

2314
02:09:31,711 --> 02:09:32,341
there and I'll think,

2315
02:09:32,341 --> 02:09:35,670
and sometimes I'll get a great idea and
in the time it takes me to get out of

2316
02:09:35,671 --> 02:09:38,810
the fucking shower, forget it.
I've washed it away. I want to,

2317
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:41,970
I want a notebook. Like
A, yeah. Waterproof,

2318
02:09:41,971 --> 02:09:45,150
no board in the shower so I can write you
into one of those. Do they make those?

2319
02:09:45,151 --> 02:09:46,440
Yeah,
but your wife would get annoyed at you.

2320
02:09:46,710 --> 02:09:51,710
I have home sweet home sign and you
have a fucking thing over it so you can

2321
02:09:52,351 --> 02:09:57,090
write your stupid Oh, Dick in mom's pussy
is hilarious. No it's not. And I'll go,

2322
02:09:57,091 --> 02:10:00,990
you know what babe? I bought this
fucking shower. Why is that a joke?

2323
02:10:01,020 --> 02:10:03,900
Get outside Dick and mom's pussies
hilarious. What's wrong with you?

2324
02:10:03,901 --> 02:10:06,880
Get in the garage where you belong.
You're smoking pot with Theo Vaughn.

2325
02:10:08,130 --> 02:10:11,850
Vaughn says he doesn't smoke pot. I don't
believe him. You was just smoking pot.

2326
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:16,650
Anybody who talks like that with all
those weird hey mans and gang a gang.

2327
02:10:17,160 --> 02:10:20,990
What is his, who is his gang
anyway? Tell him to fix his haircut.

2328
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:24,450
Girls are getting mad at you.
The way your friends dress.

2329
02:10:24,730 --> 02:10:27,750
Tell him stop dressing like that
or the way your friends act.

2330
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:31,470
Why does he do that? Why does he think
that's funny to throw stuff to do that?

2331
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:33,890
Well cause he's funny.

2332
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:36,320
It's fun. It's fun. When he
does that, I don't like it.

2333
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:41,480
I don't like to so good thing you
and I are the same person. Yeah.

2334
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:43,610
And you know what?
I can replace you.

2335
02:10:45,110 --> 02:10:48,560
Oh that's a threat.
You shouldn't say that to people.

2336
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:53,720
They feel like you might,
you might replace, are we
all replaceable in every way?

2337
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:58,310
Literally we're all replaceable.
I had Lex Friedman on yesterday from Mit.

2338
02:10:58,340 --> 02:10:59,021
He's a a,

2339
02:10:59,021 --> 02:11:03,800
a autonomous vehicle expert
in artificial intelligence.

2340
02:11:03,801 --> 02:11:06,140
Expert.
Creepy and interesting stuff.

2341
02:11:06,141 --> 02:11:09,350
But one of the things he was talking
about was like the movie her and that his

2342
02:11:09,351 --> 02:11:13,010
ultimate goal is to create something
that provides companionship to people.

2343
02:11:13,011 --> 02:11:16,040
I'm like, dude, so immediately
I think, can you fuck it?

2344
02:11:16,220 --> 02:11:19,730
And then I think if it's
a guy and it provides, uh,

2345
02:11:20,030 --> 02:11:24,170
if you want to gay boyfriend, sure,
can you make it be gay for you?

2346
02:11:24,470 --> 02:11:25,640
And that was like the big question.

2347
02:11:25,641 --> 02:11:29,240
Like if it is so smart that it's
like literally like a companion.

2348
02:11:29,450 --> 02:11:30,320
What if it's not gay?

2349
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:33,740
And he was saying we have to face the
fact that robots are going to leave us or

2350
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:35,330
grow.
We're going to make robots that leave us.

2351
02:11:35,331 --> 02:11:38,750
What the fuck's the point and make
it a robot unless it leaves you.

2352
02:11:38,780 --> 02:11:39,650
What the fuck?

2353
02:11:39,710 --> 02:11:43,370
And then there was an article about a
Pida that was mad at the folks that work

2354
02:11:43,371 --> 02:11:45,470
at Boston Dynamics
because Boston dynamics,

2355
02:11:45,471 --> 02:11:48,740
they make all these crazy robots and
they have incredible balance and they can

2356
02:11:48,741 --> 02:11:51,020
go running down hills and
shit and do back flips.

2357
02:11:51,230 --> 02:11:56,120
So these engineers were kicking these
robots that try to down dog. Well,

2358
02:11:56,121 --> 02:11:59,270
the dem, no, they didn't think it was
real dog. They were demonstrating that it,

2359
02:11:59,770 --> 02:12:03,590
you know, it can react to pressure
and it has balanced. Sure.

2360
02:12:03,890 --> 02:12:08,000
So Peter got mad and said they didn't
think it was cool that you kicked robots.

2361
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:10,160
They're really talking about,

2362
02:12:10,161 --> 02:12:12,860
I don't even know why anybody would want
to do that too because you don't have

2363
02:12:12,861 --> 02:12:14,170
to find on if you can.

2364
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:18,800
The only way to find out as your fucking
engineering works is you kick kick it.

2365
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:22,100
It doesn't have feelings.
You fuck, but it does jail.

2366
02:12:22,340 --> 02:12:23,970
That's where you're
making mistakes happen.

2367
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:25,910
The type of person that
you have to be to say,

2368
02:12:25,940 --> 02:12:29,620
I just don't think why any reasonable
person in front of kicked that rope.

2369
02:12:30,160 --> 02:12:33,080
Cause you've got to find out if he can
kick her fucking robot. How about this?

2370
02:12:33,230 --> 02:12:37,070
Come on, I'll, I'll pad that robot up
and kick the fucking shit out of it.

2371
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:40,970
For a workout. Yeah. Like I would like
a robot that I could kick. It'd be dope.

2372
02:12:41,130 --> 02:12:43,850
I would like a robot that I could
kick a lot pads and move. Yeah.

2373
02:12:44,140 --> 02:12:48,560
I want to hit it. Oh, you want to hit
it right? I would like to fuck pads.

2374
02:12:48,710 --> 02:12:52,940
I want to be able to tee off on a robot,
man. If you have a real bite back though,

2375
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:57,380
it looked, what if it moves at
like 30 or 40% that's all I want.

2376
02:12:57,410 --> 02:13:00,230
I want it to be a little dangerous,
but I want to be able to get my shots off.

2377
02:13:00,231 --> 02:13:03,470
But how do you know it's not gonna
fucking kill you? I don't say that.

2378
02:13:03,850 --> 02:13:07,600
That's probably, it's not going to
hurt. It's going to hit you. You know?

2379
02:13:07,601 --> 02:13:11,750
And I would know when I throw a leg kick
and it checks it and I hurt my Shin,

2380
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:12,640
I'm like,
oh no.

2381
02:13:12,641 --> 02:13:16,310
When you hear it called Goshen to shit
on me and then it starts lifting up its

2382
02:13:16,311 --> 02:13:18,140
front leg and pressing for
it. I'm like, oh my God,

2383
02:13:18,141 --> 02:13:20,390
my role was going to
fuck me up or fucked up.

2384
02:13:20,390 --> 02:13:25,130
I got it mad stomps on your fucking head.
You would have to get something,

2385
02:13:25,190 --> 02:13:29,990
a robot that's made out of like heavy
bag material on the outside and then the

2386
02:13:29,991 --> 02:13:34,290
inside would just be some of a wire
framework that moves fairly crudely.

2387
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:35,790
How do you stop it?
This is a thing.

2388
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:37,770
You're creating a world where we're
going to get killed by robots.

2389
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:40,290
How do you stop it?
That's the real question.

2390
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:43,710
The real question is what happens when
they get so smart and so powerful that

2391
02:13:43,711 --> 02:13:46,020
they're tired of our nonsense
and this is going to happen.

2392
02:13:46,021 --> 02:13:49,530
But Lex and I were discussing and he was
talking about all the beauty in being a

2393
02:13:49,531 --> 02:13:52,710
person and the meaning and the meaning
that we have being a person and that was

2394
02:13:52,711 --> 02:13:54,570
agreeing with them. I mean, I love people.

2395
02:13:54,590 --> 02:13:57,870
I think that's one of the things that's
interesting about us is how much we

2396
02:13:57,871 --> 02:14:00,240
appreciate the things that we,
we all do.

2397
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:04,260
We appreciate other people's art and
inspiration and even we appreciate the way

2398
02:14:04,261 --> 02:14:06,530
people look. We'd love,
we appreciate that. Yeah.

2399
02:14:06,550 --> 02:14:10,820
Something about the robots don't
give a fuck about all that. The,

2400
02:14:10,830 --> 02:14:15,030
my worry is that we could turn something
on that you can never turn back if they

2401
02:14:15,031 --> 02:14:18,660
become sentient, if they have the
ability to do whatever they want,

2402
02:14:18,661 --> 02:14:19,471
whenever they want to,

2403
02:14:19,471 --> 02:14:24,090
and they look at us when the sperm
whales with 150 flip flops in there,

2404
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:25,650
but they're going to go,

2405
02:14:25,651 --> 02:14:28,450
what the fuck is wrong with
people and have we got to fix it?

2406
02:14:28,451 --> 02:14:30,740
Are they doing like, look
how gross they are. They,

2407
02:14:30,741 --> 02:14:35,670
they eat all the fish and they throw
their plastic in the water and whales are

2408
02:14:35,671 --> 02:14:36,001
eating.

2409
02:14:36,001 --> 02:14:39,330
They're plastic and dying and they would
look at all the stuff we do and then

2410
02:14:39,331 --> 02:14:42,650
we'll go wide. It kill us. Why
are we don't need you around?

2411
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:43,650
You guys are worthless.

2412
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:48,680
But we are so ego testicle
and so egocentric that we
can't imagine a world with

2413
02:14:49,291 --> 02:14:53,160
meaning without us, right? Because we are
everything. But even though we're finite,

2414
02:14:53,250 --> 02:14:55,170
we can only only,
only exist for a certain amount of time,

2415
02:14:55,290 --> 02:14:57,470
but leave behind a legacy
that other people could enjoy.

2416
02:14:57,620 --> 02:15:00,960
It doesn't matter if they're going to die
too though, does it, but it does matter.

2417
02:15:00,961 --> 02:15:03,420
It matters. While you're
alive. Okay, got it.

2418
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:07,640
The universe doesn't give a fuck about
all that and all these crazy robots that

2419
02:15:07,641 --> 02:15:09,960
take over.
Imagine if we got to a planet one day,

2420
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:15,480
I can imagine if we traveled the universe
and we managed to avoid creating some

2421
02:15:15,751 --> 02:15:19,380
sort of artificial intelligence because
we got hit with a solar flare that

2422
02:15:19,381 --> 02:15:21,690
killed the fucking power grid or
something like that. And when,

2423
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:25,320
then we got wiser as a civilization and
then we got to a place where we could

2424
02:15:25,321 --> 02:15:29,670
travel and we traveled to another planet
and we got there. And those robots,

2425
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,880
just robots, no humans, no humans.

2426
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:36,750
And they were just running
around aimlessly because
they'd killed off all the

2427
02:15:36,751 --> 02:15:37,830
biological life.

2428
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:41,670
And they just sit in there operating
on the sun with nothing to do and no

2429
02:15:41,671 --> 02:15:43,290
purpose and no reason to exist.

2430
02:15:43,291 --> 02:15:46,920
And like what happened and these crazy
monkeys that lived on this planet,

2431
02:15:46,950 --> 02:15:48,690
they decided to for an experiment,

2432
02:15:48,691 --> 02:15:52,140
make an artificial intelligence
and just let it go. Run a muck.

2433
02:15:52,410 --> 02:15:56,080
And what it did was eat everything it
lived off biological material to there's

2434
02:15:56,100 --> 02:15:56,933
nothing left.

2435
02:15:56,940 --> 02:16:00,240
And then it just sat there in the
sun and waited for someone to arrive.

2436
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:05,370
No, that can never happen. Of
course it could. That's happening.

2437
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:07,860
I'm thinking too deeply about where
I'm going to be when that happens.

2438
02:16:07,861 --> 02:16:10,920
Those Boston dynamic robots are going
to have a little pinchers on each arm.

2439
02:16:10,921 --> 02:16:14,160
Just wrapping everything in front of
them and stuffing them in their big giant

2440
02:16:14,161 --> 02:16:15,560
mouse. Cha Cha. What about the,

2441
02:16:15,690 --> 02:16:18,030
what about the role that's a turn
themselves back on? Didn't that happen?

2442
02:16:18,031 --> 02:16:18,864
Where was that?
Right.

2443
02:16:19,230 --> 02:16:21,900
That has shut of robot down in Korea
because it turned itself back on.

2444
02:16:21,901 --> 02:16:23,940
If there were shut off,
that's what's happening.

2445
02:16:24,240 --> 02:16:27,920
That's what's going to happen though.
The robots are going to start going, ah,

2446
02:16:27,970 --> 02:16:30,070
I want to be on right now.
I don't like being off.

2447
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:32,290
It wasn't that something that
they were doing with Google.

2448
02:16:32,291 --> 02:16:37,291
Artificial people in new study struggled
to turn off a robot when it begged them

2449
02:16:38,111 --> 02:16:41,680
not to. Oh, begged them. Not too creepy.

2450
02:16:41,740 --> 02:16:46,090
I somehow felt sorry for him. Whoa.
Please don't tag me off. Chill dude.

2451
02:16:46,091 --> 02:16:49,840
That I'm telling you when that becomes
a real woman like x Mokena. Yep.

2452
02:16:49,870 --> 02:16:52,580
And you're in love with her and she
tells you to kill your boss. Yup.

2453
02:16:53,650 --> 02:16:57,320
I want to be with you, Andrew. You don't
need to go to work. Jamie's for full.

2454
02:16:57,330 --> 02:17:01,840
Jamie won't let us leave. Jamie doesn't
think I'm a real woman, but I know you do.

2455
02:17:02,420 --> 02:17:03,370
Like,
oh we got to,

2456
02:17:03,430 --> 02:17:05,920
that happened that we were on the way to
that happening and we made a deal with

2457
02:17:05,921 --> 02:17:09,880
them to leave us alone and we got to
go to north central island to exist.

2458
02:17:09,881 --> 02:17:14,200
Uncontacted showing them what would you
rather be eaten by a robot or live like

2459
02:17:14,201 --> 02:17:18,010
a savage savage. Oh my
God. Any Day of the week.

2460
02:17:18,011 --> 02:17:20,590
Let me live off the
grid forever like that.

2461
02:17:20,650 --> 02:17:25,120
As long as you're in a resource rich
place, I would take the money that bad.

2462
02:17:25,150 --> 02:17:26,260
They've lived there for a long time.

2463
02:17:26,350 --> 02:17:30,280
It's the size of Manhattan and there's
only 39 of them though. That ain't good.

2464
02:17:30,310 --> 02:17:32,980
Yeah, but that's also because how can
they repopulate their fucking each other.

2465
02:17:33,010 --> 02:17:35,530
That's what I'm saying.
So how you can only repopulate so much.

2466
02:17:36,070 --> 02:17:38,500
You can only continue to
repopulate within your own. Right.

2467
02:17:38,501 --> 02:17:41,440
What kind of gene pool they're drawn from.
It's only 39 of them.

2468
02:17:41,770 --> 02:17:45,070
They have to be fucking relatives.
They're all relatives.

2469
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:46,540
There's no way they've got to,
there's no way.

2470
02:17:46,541 --> 02:17:48,580
They have a map on the island
of people that they're like,

2471
02:17:48,581 --> 02:17:50,950
you can't fuck her remap. Just keep
that in mind. They're like, well,

2472
02:17:50,951 --> 02:17:54,820
there's only 17 choices. Yeah,
it's only 39 of [inaudible] either.

2473
02:17:55,060 --> 02:17:57,430
I wonder if it's how many, if it's
male versus female, what it is,

2474
02:17:57,850 --> 02:18:02,850
but it's more dominant percent men
fighting for 15 girls or but fucking

2475
02:18:03,520 --> 02:18:07,360
[inaudible] get him the girls to
get pregnant. The only 39 of them,

2476
02:18:07,361 --> 02:18:10,240
because they're all gay
and like they go skate.

2477
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:13,470
It's time to make a baby like now and wow.

2478
02:18:13,510 --> 02:18:16,680
Hey Girl started crows and
they run up to the tree tops.

2479
02:18:16,681 --> 02:18:19,810
Start Banging each other and
looking at the girls. Yeah. Growth.

2480
02:18:19,811 --> 02:18:24,811
Get really mad because they want a baby
surrounded by all these damaged said the

2481
02:18:26,231 --> 02:18:29,380
sad, the story of sets in
the island, dammit. Yeah.

2482
02:18:29,381 --> 02:18:32,070
They must be to say they're all cousins.
They're all fucking sick.

2483
02:18:32,570 --> 02:18:33,940
You had to live in the jungle.

2484
02:18:34,690 --> 02:18:37,960
What have you had to live in the junk
you'd live in the jungle look like in the

2485
02:18:37,961 --> 02:18:42,880
Amazon. Like I'd rather live in the
desert. The junk. Really? Yeah. Not me.

2486
02:18:43,340 --> 02:18:45,940
I live in a desert. Desert.
Desert. W were you going to do it?

2487
02:18:45,941 --> 02:18:49,110
Make a house out of sand. Fuck you.
Gonna do there. You had dialed there.

2488
02:18:49,111 --> 02:18:50,800
My dying while you've been a mountain.
First of all,

2489
02:18:50,801 --> 02:18:51,730
you can make a house in a mountain.

2490
02:18:52,640 --> 02:18:55,840
What carve it out was the last
time you were at a desert.

2491
02:18:55,841 --> 02:18:57,820
They don't have mountains
in a mother fucking desert.

2492
02:18:58,390 --> 02:19:01,950
Usually Los Angeles was a desert. These
are mountains all over the place. No,

2493
02:19:01,970 --> 02:19:05,210
you go to the mountains. It's not
desert. There are demos in the deserts.

2494
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:10,000
Varied terrain. Arizona
desert. Desert mountains. Yeah.
They do have some mountains,

2495
02:19:10,690 --> 02:19:13,870
but they have desert and then they have
mountains. Does it know desert mountain?

2496
02:19:13,900 --> 02:19:16,930
Sure. There is no, once you get up
in the mountains, trees and shit. No,

2497
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:20,330
not in Arizona. There's, that's true.
Some of them are rocky, right? Yeah.

2498
02:19:21,890 --> 02:19:22,580
Well,

2499
02:19:22,580 --> 02:19:26,230
you know what's the really coolest when
you go from like San Diego and you drive

2500
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:31,800
through that area like into Arizona and
you find all those crazy rock formations

2501
02:19:32,061 --> 02:19:33,530
and Cheryl can beautiful out there,
man,

2502
02:19:33,650 --> 02:19:37,670
if you really stop and think about all
the different types of environment that

2503
02:19:37,671 --> 02:19:42,230
exists here in America where you go to
Yellowstone and see all that crazy shit

2504
02:19:42,350 --> 02:19:45,410
and then you can go to Miami and the
keys and see all that crazy shit.

2505
02:19:45,440 --> 02:19:50,440
You could be up in Maine and see the
frozen north in Michigan and Idaho and on

2506
02:19:50,721 --> 02:19:54,110
the train down to San Diego.
When we were going down there,

2507
02:19:54,111 --> 02:19:57,260
I was on the train and I had to had
one gentleman and this gentleman like

2508
02:19:57,261 --> 02:19:58,850
explore like I like I like I like,

2509
02:19:58,870 --> 02:20:01,490
I like a guy who likes to fucking
relax and not be in traffic.

2510
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:04,190
I was sitting in the train and some
guy next to me was gone talking to some

2511
02:20:04,191 --> 02:20:07,430
young kid. Some young kid was
like, I want to go to Europe.

2512
02:20:07,431 --> 02:20:09,980
I think Europe is awesome. It's better
than America. It's an older guy.

2513
02:20:09,981 --> 02:20:13,520
He was like, this country has more to
offer than you could ever fucking dream.

2514
02:20:13,820 --> 02:20:15,750
And he was like, what do you, what do
you tie? What are you talking about it?

2515
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:18,110
And he's like,
you can see the beauty of the mountains.

2516
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:20,080
You can see the beauty of Alaska.
You could see that.

2517
02:20:20,081 --> 02:20:22,130
And he was explaining all this
stuff about that. He's like,

2518
02:20:22,250 --> 02:20:25,250
I've never left the United States and
I've traveled to almost every state and

2519
02:20:25,251 --> 02:20:29,090
every state gets better. And I
was like, ah, shut up punk. Yeah,

2520
02:20:29,091 --> 02:20:31,820
shut up you little punk bitch,
you little pussy.

2521
02:20:31,910 --> 02:20:34,550
He was pushing around that same agenda
though, that he was here. But it is true.

2522
02:20:34,670 --> 02:20:36,890
The more I travel, the more I'm like,
oh, this place is fucking gorgeous.

2523
02:20:36,890 --> 02:20:39,860
I would have never thought to come here.
If it weren't for comedy. I get to go to,

2524
02:20:39,861 --> 02:20:42,380
we get to go to places where I'm like,
I would have never traveled here.

2525
02:20:42,410 --> 02:20:46,150
There was no reason for me to go to
Virginia outside of for doing standup.

2526
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:49,220
I was never going to vacation
there. I mean, that's true.
That's a good point. Yeah.

2527
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:51,620
I was never going to go off.
And unless you're traveling for work,

2528
02:20:51,621 --> 02:20:54,830
how often are you traveling to these
kinds of cities? Just just check them out.

2529
02:20:54,860 --> 02:20:58,460
Yeah. Who does that? Maine. Maine
was fucking beautiful. I had no idea.

2530
02:20:58,461 --> 02:21:01,400
Main was that nice. Has like
eight people living in it. Yeah,

2531
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:04,010
I was nine when I showed up.
I got a couple of kids there too.

2532
02:21:04,130 --> 02:21:08,810
This spots and main where you just drive
and all you see is woods for like an

2533
02:21:08,810 --> 02:21:11,570
hour. It's fucking beautiful though.
When you see that kind of like land,

2534
02:21:11,930 --> 02:21:16,520
like little towns that still just haven't
been like butt fucked by pop culture

2535
02:21:16,521 --> 02:21:17,870
influenced and still have their own thing.

2536
02:21:17,871 --> 02:21:19,880
We up to Bangor were Stephen King lives.

2537
02:21:20,060 --> 02:21:21,980
I think he's what they
call a snowbird now.

2538
02:21:21,981 --> 02:21:25,160
Like he lives in Florida and then
in the summertime he lives in Maine.

2539
02:21:25,220 --> 02:21:26,530
That's like my nightmare man.
He,

2540
02:21:26,550 --> 02:21:31,550
he lives in a house in the
middle of Bangor and like
you could drive to his gate

2541
02:21:32,270 --> 02:21:32,751
like his,

2542
02:21:32,751 --> 02:21:36,170
his gait is there and everybody knows
this is his house cause it's this big ass

2543
02:21:36,171 --> 02:21:38,420
house.
I bet it's a s k on the fucking gate.

2544
02:21:38,630 --> 02:21:42,350
Well it has the rod iron gates have
like gargoyles on them and shit.

2545
02:21:42,650 --> 02:21:45,330
So it's like everyone knows
it's his house kick shit.

2546
02:21:45,470 --> 02:21:48,680
But he gets like Weirdo showing up,
banging on his door and stuff,

2547
02:21:49,130 --> 02:21:53,180
trying to give her a script house.
Wow. Yeah. It's a dope old house.

2548
02:21:53,510 --> 02:21:56,240
But I mean he lives right,
doesn't there?

2549
02:21:56,270 --> 02:21:58,950
Doesn't it looked like Stephen King
lived there. Look, it is looking at the,

2550
02:21:58,951 --> 02:22:02,700
the winged creatures on is, what is
that? It's the Gargoyle, right? Yeah.

2551
02:22:02,830 --> 02:22:07,340
Cooley look, fuck that looks, that's
wild. He had that made, I mean,

2552
02:22:07,341 --> 02:22:12,130
it's so obvious that it's his house.
He's got a frog also. He loves frogs.

2553
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:16,130
The frogs at fuck up mice
and shit. Yeah. He's um,

2554
02:22:16,980 --> 02:22:21,860
you know, I don't think Bangor has
a population of 100,000 people.

2555
02:22:22,100 --> 02:22:25,770
If I had to guess what state?
Bangor Maine. That's where he lives.

2556
02:22:25,890 --> 02:22:30,870
I didn't know as many, what's
the population of Bangor?
30 1030 1000 in a city.

2557
02:22:31,610 --> 02:22:35,310
My buddy was living up there and my friend
Marcus Davis was living up there and

2558
02:22:35,311 --> 02:22:39,570
he loved it. He's a fighter because
say there's no crime, there's no crime.

2559
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:42,030
It's kind of hard when there's that
low of a population. Yeah. He's like,

2560
02:22:42,031 --> 02:22:45,570
it's really cold up there and shit, but
there's no crime. I still gigs up there.

2561
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:48,270
I used to gigs up there
when I was living in Boston.

2562
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:52,650
He drove three and a half hours to Bangor,
Maine in the last hour.

2563
02:22:52,980 --> 02:22:57,720
You have to make sure you get gas because
you got to drive an hour with no gas.

2564
02:22:58,170 --> 02:23:01,760
There's an does that Bangor,
that's fright. There is beautiful.

2565
02:23:01,761 --> 02:23:05,370
The mountain in the lake.
God, it's beautiful cotton.

2566
02:23:07,410 --> 02:23:10,230
Dana white keeps a place up
there in Maine. Yeah, yeah.

2567
02:23:10,231 --> 02:23:13,260
He's got a place in some other
part of Maine, like a beautiful,

2568
02:23:13,710 --> 02:23:17,100
like he's got a big spread up there,
a lot of land,

2569
02:23:17,101 --> 02:23:20,100
and he's like a vacation place where
he goes and brings his friends and they

2570
02:23:20,101 --> 02:23:21,840
just chill. That's it can,
I mean, it's interesting.

2571
02:23:21,841 --> 02:23:25,410
I don't know if that wouldn't be my
vacation place spot, but I guess, well,

2572
02:23:25,411 --> 02:23:26,930
it's fucking beautiful man.

2573
02:23:26,950 --> 02:23:29,640
And there's no one there and it's
gone and they can let you know.

2574
02:23:29,670 --> 02:23:31,380
I guess you just want to get
away from fucking society.

2575
02:23:31,381 --> 02:23:35,820
You know my vacation spot would
be in a lake, Louise and Banff.

2576
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:40,020
What's Bam? Bam for national forest
is in Calgary. Oh, Lake Louise.

2577
02:23:40,021 --> 02:23:42,510
You'll probably see them. The prettiest
lake I've ever seen in my fucking life.

2578
02:23:43,470 --> 02:23:46,250
I think it's pretty country up
there, dude. Oh Calgary's gorgeous.

2579
02:23:46,260 --> 02:23:49,530
Fucking beautiful. But Lake Louise
in like specifically, I went,

2580
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:54,560
I went to Banff national forest when we
were doing this thing and I was stunned

2581
02:23:55,440 --> 02:23:58,920
by how fucking look at that Lake
Louise. Ooh Man, that's so pretty.

2582
02:23:58,921 --> 02:24:02,240
There's some about a mountain
and a Lake Combo, right?

2583
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:06,270
Mountains in a lake together.
It's like fishing.

2584
02:24:06,810 --> 02:24:10,230
I do like fucking fishing. I love
fishing. Don't get to do it enough.

2585
02:24:10,490 --> 02:24:13,320
I let me needed, that's a problem. But
I've been thinking about that lately.

2586
02:24:13,321 --> 02:24:16,520
Like I need to do more fishing. Like,
I see shit like that and I go, God,

2587
02:24:16,521 --> 02:24:20,790
I don't want to be out there like
catching northern pike having a good old

2588
02:24:20,791 --> 02:24:21,624
fucking time.

2589
02:24:22,020 --> 02:24:25,680
It's the best way to like hang out with
friends and just chill the fuck out and

2590
02:24:25,681 --> 02:24:29,560
talk shit and have a laugh and, and
if you can cook them on the shore, uh,

2591
02:24:29,561 --> 02:24:32,460
that's the best thing of frying
pan and cook it right there.

2592
02:24:33,190 --> 02:24:36,510
They're so delicious. Like you can't
believe how much more delicious they are.

2593
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:40,970
Fresh fish is unbeatable. There's no two
different plays. So much better. Yeah.

2594
02:24:41,010 --> 02:24:43,350
Store bought fish. It's
just not the same. Yeah,

2595
02:24:43,351 --> 02:24:46,950
me and the missus caught some Mahima he
wants and then we brought it right back

2596
02:24:46,951 --> 02:24:50,790
to the, uh, to the place in Mexico and
they were cooking it at the resort.

2597
02:24:51,180 --> 02:24:53,580
And I was like, this is the best
fish I've ever eaten in my life.

2598
02:24:53,610 --> 02:24:55,950
I can't believe how good it also
circumstantial that you're like,

2599
02:24:55,951 --> 02:24:58,260
this is one of the greatest
kind of ways to have that.

2600
02:24:58,261 --> 02:25:01,080
So it also probably releases different
endorphins in your brain to be like,

2601
02:25:01,081 --> 02:25:03,360
I'm enjoying this more than I
ever would enjoy other fish.

2602
02:25:03,390 --> 02:25:04,890
But it was the first time I'd ever caught,

2603
02:25:05,070 --> 02:25:09,540
I would eat and Mahi Mahi that was her
super fresh. Like I had eaten it before,

2604
02:25:09,541 --> 02:25:12,690
but it was probably frozen. You
know what I mean? Not that fresh.

2605
02:25:12,691 --> 02:25:16,940
Maybe a day old pat. Yeah, but when you
eat it like an hour after you catch,

2606
02:25:16,950 --> 02:25:20,070
it's like, Holy Shit. Imagine
how salmon tastes the bears.

2607
02:25:20,071 --> 02:25:22,290
I catch them out of the fucking
room or in their office. So excited.

2608
02:25:22,340 --> 02:25:27,250
They get so fat they get so fucking
fat. Coastal bears. That's the big ones.

2609
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:29,500
You know, brown bears and
grizzly bears are the same thing,

2610
02:25:29,501 --> 02:25:32,650
but brown bears are way bigger and
the reason why they're way bigger,

2611
02:25:32,651 --> 02:25:33,600
it's because they live on the coast,

2612
02:25:33,601 --> 02:25:37,930
so just eating fish and dead whales they
launched and anything else they can get

2613
02:25:37,931 --> 02:25:42,760
there. Fuck origin on fucking
fatty, fatty, heavy foods.
There's an awful video.

2614
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:44,680
Awful. Jamie. I'll find it.

2615
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:49,920
Of a grizzly that's polling black bear
cubs out of a den and killing them and

2616
02:25:51,340 --> 02:25:54,040
eating them and the mother
is trying to stomp them.

2617
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:59,400
He's trying to stop the grizzly from
eating her babies and he just swats are

2618
02:26:01,001 --> 02:26:04,840
away like she ain't shit. I got
say, it's awful dude, you shouldn't,

2619
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:08,980
shouldn't play it. It definitely cannot
play it and you shouldn't even watch it.

2620
02:26:09,220 --> 02:26:11,830
I'm gonna it.
The screens that they make and it takes,

2621
02:26:11,850 --> 02:26:15,850
it's a long ass video and she's trying
to fight him off but he's like, fuck you,

2622
02:26:15,851 --> 02:26:17,080
I'm eating your babies.

2623
02:26:18,310 --> 02:26:23,310
That's one thing that bothers me the
most about the anthropomorphization that

2624
02:26:24,461 --> 02:26:27,840
people do with animals is the,
their stance on bears is,

2625
02:26:27,850 --> 02:26:29,710
I don't want people to hate bears,

2626
02:26:29,711 --> 02:26:33,340
but I want people to know what a bear
really is versus what they think it is.

2627
02:26:33,370 --> 02:26:34,060
I think they're sweet.

2628
02:26:34,060 --> 02:26:37,270
They eat honey and they're sweet and
they're nice and they don't really fuck

2629
02:26:37,271 --> 02:26:40,990
shit up. They, they're amazing.
I'm a big fan of bears,

2630
02:26:41,860 --> 02:26:45,130
but they are all cannibals.
They're all cal bears make me feel like,

2631
02:26:45,131 --> 02:26:48,730
of course there were dinosaurs pairs
or like that's just a fucking dinosaur.

2632
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:53,650
Well, it's a beast. This is what it
is. It's a beast in the purest sense.

2633
02:26:53,651 --> 02:26:56,650
So any beast make reminds me that we
definitely had had to have dinosaurs.

2634
02:26:56,651 --> 02:27:01,150
That that was just a small dinosaur. No,
it's nothing like a dinosaur's far, far,

2635
02:27:01,151 --> 02:27:04,000
far, far, far creep here,
they don't have any hair.

2636
02:27:04,930 --> 02:27:07,930
I don't trust anything with no hair.
You don't have any fucking hair.

2637
02:27:07,931 --> 02:27:10,470
I have a little,
I got out of my face get ugly,

2638
02:27:10,960 --> 02:27:15,070
but I don't trust anything that like
is hairless. Any hair on its body.

2639
02:27:15,071 --> 02:27:18,160
It's what other animals? What do you
mean? Like fish or hairless like a snake.

2640
02:27:18,190 --> 02:27:20,950
Everything in the waters hair list.
You don't trust those fox? None of it.

2641
02:27:20,980 --> 02:27:21,670
None of it.

2642
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:24,190
That bottlenose dolphins I brought back
and they just found you don't trust that

2643
02:27:24,191 --> 02:27:27,460
dolphin and so that's a weapon
from Russia. It's awesome.

2644
02:27:27,461 --> 02:27:32,110
They want to put a bomb on that thing,
but we had a Russian strap on. It's back.

2645
02:27:32,111 --> 02:27:35,240
That's the whole did spoke Russian.
It had a Russian strap on its back.

2646
02:27:35,241 --> 02:27:38,770
Stope like the, the, the whale
that they're talking about.

2647
02:27:38,800 --> 02:27:42,970
They think the Russians had trained it
to get close to boats so that it could

2648
02:27:42,971 --> 02:27:47,020
hit the boat and blow it up.
Stope you don't care. I care.

2649
02:27:47,050 --> 02:27:51,490
Some things are cool.
I mean they're rendering of rex hair hair.

2650
02:27:51,491 --> 02:27:55,180
But I thought they think it has feathers
to think those are fair and looking at

2651
02:27:55,190 --> 02:27:58,210
it has red hair by the way, at the front
of its face. Well that's the other thing.

2652
02:27:58,211 --> 02:28:02,770
They think that it might've been because
they think they might been scavengers.

2653
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:07,060
T rex was a ginger with freckles.
Where did you find this Jamie's holes?

2654
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:12,020
Fucking Dick rule that no ginger's that
are assholes. How about a Dunn's word?

2655
02:28:13,550 --> 02:28:16,940
They're all over the place. Changes that
are assholes you can't not find. Look at,

2656
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:20,770
there's nothing. Might've had
facial features like a vulture.

2657
02:28:21,050 --> 02:28:22,310
They think it might have been red

2658
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:24,950
in the face cause they really don't
have any idea what the, I mean,

2659
02:28:24,951 --> 02:28:27,500
when you see these color drawings,
they just take chances.

2660
02:28:27,501 --> 02:28:32,210
They just are all made up.
The, um, university of Bozeman,

2661
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:35,660
not the University of Bozeman and the
natural history museum, and Bozeman,

2662
02:28:36,470 --> 02:28:40,430
Montana has a raptor
that on one side of it,

2663
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:41,720
they had feathers on it.

2664
02:28:41,740 --> 02:28:45,350
So it's hard to give you like an
alternate perspective of what it might've

2665
02:28:45,351 --> 02:28:50,060
looked like. So they had this
raptor and in one side of it,

2666
02:28:50,061 --> 02:28:53,860
it looked just like an, like an evil
bird. It's really cool because they,

2667
02:28:53,861 --> 02:28:55,340
they know now.
That's what it looked like.

2668
02:28:55,550 --> 02:28:59,900
They know now that a lot of
dinosaurs had had feathers.

2669
02:28:59,930 --> 02:29:04,640
They've actually got fossils
of dinosaurs with feathers.

2670
02:29:04,670 --> 02:29:09,500
So they know that the idea
that all dinosaurs were
these reptile looking things

2671
02:29:09,501 --> 02:29:13,700
is incorrect. Some of them literally were
birds. So the birds that you see today,

2672
02:29:13,701 --> 02:29:15,890
whether it's a peacock or a
chicken or something like that,

2673
02:29:16,130 --> 02:29:18,050
they're fucking dinosaurs.
That's what that is.

2674
02:29:18,051 --> 02:29:20,930
It's a dinosaur that survived the
ones that are bigger than a chicken.

2675
02:29:20,931 --> 02:29:23,090
It didn't really make it,
but the ones, you know,

2676
02:29:23,150 --> 02:29:28,150
why did the small ones making it will
hide that when the impact of the crater

2677
02:29:29,750 --> 02:29:33,560
hit the world, that it was so devastating.
They killed almost everything.

2678
02:29:33,790 --> 02:29:36,710
Kyla and every, whatever was
left, whatever, scrounging,

2679
02:29:36,711 --> 02:29:40,160
scavenging little creature that was left,
evolved and became us.

2680
02:29:40,161 --> 02:29:44,360
We used to be a mole. We used to be
like a shrew 65 million years ago.

2681
02:29:44,361 --> 02:29:47,910
That's what these people, these, these
nonbelievers is what they think you,

2682
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:51,550
you think it's ridiculous that you think
you came from a monkey to know it's

2683
02:29:51,580 --> 02:29:55,670
addictive. I know. You know, this
is how crazy these liberals are.

2684
02:29:56,060 --> 02:29:58,940
You know that it's crazy to
think you came from monkey.

2685
02:29:58,941 --> 02:30:02,000
Willie's motherfuckers take it to
another level. They, they're so crazy.

2686
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:06,260
They think you came from a shrew. He were
a lack. A little mole cannot here. Yep,

2687
02:30:06,261 --> 02:30:08,390
Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep. And
then that became a monkey.

2688
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:13,070
And then add the monkey becomes you all
that shit inside of 65 million years.

2689
02:30:13,310 --> 02:30:15,380
Get the fuck Outta here. Fuck. Meanwhile,

2690
02:30:15,381 --> 02:30:18,770
crocodiles are a hundred million
years old. So crocodiles are the same.

2691
02:30:18,890 --> 02:30:19,880
But somehow or another,

2692
02:30:19,881 --> 02:30:24,290
we went from being a fucking shrew to
being a person who knows and loves Jesus

2693
02:30:24,291 --> 02:30:27,410
and her heart shit. That's it
right there. That's that thing.

2694
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:32,900
So if you see like rats, like
there was a, I don't buy it.

2695
02:30:33,650 --> 02:30:37,850
I think it was in, where
was it? There was a video.

2696
02:30:37,880 --> 02:30:41,690
We were a science experiment.
There was a video of rats in Chinatown.

2697
02:30:42,410 --> 02:30:46,850
I th I want to say
it might've been northern California,

2698
02:30:47,150 --> 02:30:47,810
but there was,

2699
02:30:47,810 --> 02:30:52,810
they were tearing down a building in
Chinatown and the volume of rats that come

2700
02:30:53,691 --> 02:30:58,330
pouring out of this building, it's like,
hold on, say that Shit. They did what?

2701
02:30:58,340 --> 02:30:59,540
They were living in the
walls of this building,

2702
02:30:59,541 --> 02:31:00,890
it demolish it and all the rest came out.

2703
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:03,260
They were demolishing it and
people were outside filming.

2704
02:31:03,560 --> 02:31:08,510
As you're seeing like streams of rats
run out of this building and out onto the

2705
02:31:08,511 --> 02:31:12,140
street, stumbling into the gutter,
standing there on the sidewalk,

2706
02:31:12,141 --> 02:31:15,080
not knowing where to go and fucking
hate rats are running past him,

2707
02:31:15,290 --> 02:31:18,770
but I mean hundreds of rats,
hundreds, probably thousands
if they're in the walls.

2708
02:31:18,771 --> 02:31:19,830
Right?
For sure.

2709
02:31:20,310 --> 02:31:23,700
For sure. Communities are rats inside
the rural walls. This building,

2710
02:31:23,701 --> 02:31:25,860
they're tearing down. I'm glad we
don't have rats in Los Angeles.

2711
02:31:26,460 --> 02:31:28,740
Not like they do in like New York.
Do you know why we don't have rats?

2712
02:31:31,660 --> 02:31:34,060
Cody's, that's right.
Yeah. The coyotes. Yeah.

2713
02:31:34,180 --> 02:31:36,870
Those motherfuckers [inaudible] mark,

2714
02:31:37,030 --> 02:31:40,330
creepy weird dogs that you see running
around taking all the fucking rats.

2715
02:31:40,480 --> 02:31:43,270
Those who don't quit be cons. They
keep us in check. What do you,

2716
02:31:43,271 --> 02:31:43,971
what did you find Jamie?

2717
02:31:43,971 --> 02:31:46,750
Do you find the rat video with all the
other video about by found like this one

2718
02:31:46,751 --> 02:31:49,090
lady said she thought she was going to
die. There were so many rats around her.

2719
02:31:49,091 --> 02:31:51,460
She didn't know what to do. Just
a little. Just a little much.

2720
02:31:51,461 --> 02:31:54,220
But it says there was a huge
problem in 91 year old building.

2721
02:31:54,221 --> 02:31:56,000
I can't find a video of your,

2722
02:31:56,950 --> 02:32:00,220
that's an l like February 9th and they
tore it down, I think. Oh Shit. Well,

2723
02:32:00,221 --> 02:32:01,060
if you're in the city,

2724
02:32:01,061 --> 02:32:03,460
I'm sure there's horrible rat problems
and I know there's rat problems in the

2725
02:32:03,461 --> 02:32:07,260
Hollywood hills too. Um, yeah, I, yeah,
that's your out here. There's no fun.

2726
02:32:07,270 --> 02:32:08,980
Somebody told me they were
at a movie theater and some,

2727
02:32:08,981 --> 02:32:12,370
some person who lives in the hills
had a nice house with a movie theater,

2728
02:32:12,520 --> 02:32:15,510
but they had to keep their feet up
when they watch movies cause rats were

2729
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:16,600
running across your feet.

2730
02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:19,990
Shut the fuck up in their Nice
House with a movie theater. Okay,

2731
02:32:19,991 --> 02:32:23,630
get that shit handled called exterminator.
Get that shit handled the or get a,

2732
02:32:23,650 --> 02:32:26,980
get a couple more dogs. Keep your
feet up. Get more dog cats around.

2733
02:32:27,160 --> 02:32:30,840
When they get shit in a box in your
house, just piss in a box. A little dog.

2734
02:32:31,270 --> 02:32:35,500
Does Marshall or eat little
critter things? He does. He
bring him into the house.

2735
02:32:35,501 --> 02:32:38,710
He loves kill squirrels. Would joke
around about it. He's a squirrel killer,

2736
02:32:38,740 --> 02:32:41,830
but he's a straight up squirrel,
killer murderer. He's so sweet,

2737
02:32:41,860 --> 02:32:44,140
but not the squirrels thing
is he doesn't rip them apart.

2738
02:32:44,200 --> 02:32:46,510
He just kills them like they're
a toy and he brings him back.

2739
02:32:46,511 --> 02:32:49,050
I don't think he understands what the
fuck they are. No, he doesn't fuck up.

2740
02:32:49,090 --> 02:32:51,250
But he brings him back and then what
does he put them in the same spot.

2741
02:32:51,251 --> 02:32:52,990
Every time you bring your ball back,

2742
02:32:52,991 --> 02:32:55,700
they'll drop in this bottle being
a squirrel bag drop in this bar.

2743
02:32:56,200 --> 02:32:58,420
Like they returned things.
Yeah, he's a retriever.

2744
02:32:58,450 --> 02:33:02,000
Well he just wants to know if
you want this. No, no, he's
a retriever. Yeah, go get,

2745
02:33:02,080 --> 02:33:03,130
that's what those dogs are.

2746
02:33:03,310 --> 02:33:06,310
Those dogs are designed probably
for like duck hunting or some shit,

2747
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:10,930
like whatever, whatever retrieval that
you wanted them to do. But they, they're,

2748
02:33:10,970 --> 02:33:14,650
they don't crush things. They have a
gentle mouth. They call it a soft mouth.

2749
02:33:14,980 --> 02:33:17,640
Like when they carry things they
don't like I've had pimples. Right.

2750
02:33:17,650 --> 02:33:20,110
And they just crush everything.
They merge everything you give them.

2751
02:33:20,111 --> 02:33:23,260
I had a dog that I had to give him
a fucking root canal. Not, I did it.

2752
02:33:23,320 --> 02:33:27,100
I brought him to an actual dentist
show the dentist. He, he bits so hard.

2753
02:33:27,101 --> 02:33:31,780
He shattered his teeth. He shattered his
back, his back teeth. Ah, by crushing,

2754
02:33:31,781 --> 02:33:35,380
um, uh, bones. It just
was crushing, just going,

2755
02:33:35,410 --> 02:33:38,350
since they have so much power
that their teeth would crack.

2756
02:33:38,680 --> 02:33:40,660
But the cold retrievers don't
bite that heart. They don't bite.

2757
02:33:40,670 --> 02:33:43,420
That's like Brittany's, my dad's
friend had a Brittany, a hunting dog.

2758
02:33:43,480 --> 02:33:44,410
Brittanys are like that too.

2759
02:33:44,480 --> 02:33:46,210
They're gentle and put a duck
in their mouth or something,

2760
02:33:46,211 --> 02:33:50,070
but they won't buy exactly. Like you
can't go duck hunting with a pit bull.

2761
02:33:51,290 --> 02:33:53,080
So bring you back a hamburger patty.

2762
02:33:53,081 --> 02:33:56,290
Like it happened to duck you fucking
asshole. And it's like, Shit,

2763
02:33:56,330 --> 02:34:01,100
get it shock rip to fucking
shreds. Yeah. Do you have,

2764
02:34:01,330 --> 02:34:02,380
you want a dog?

2765
02:34:02,410 --> 02:34:06,550
You don't want a German shepherd that does
bite work to go out and get your docs,

2766
02:34:06,730 --> 02:34:08,110
whatever retriever.
I mean,

2767
02:34:08,111 --> 02:34:11,440
it's not a coincidence that those
dogs like labs and retrievers,

2768
02:34:11,441 --> 02:34:14,510
they're like the sweetest dogs in the
world. There's so nice to people. Yeah,

2769
02:34:14,511 --> 02:34:17,830
because it, because they're, I think
they're inherently like their whole,

2770
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:20,400
they're not a vicious attack.
They don't like attacking. I'm,

2771
02:34:20,470 --> 02:34:23,860
I've never seen a of golden attack, so,
no, no, no. They're not like that at all.

2772
02:34:23,861 --> 02:34:27,030
But they're bred for that and that's
the way their bread. Like you,

2773
02:34:27,031 --> 02:34:30,310
you never met my dog yet. Right. She's
the fucking nicest. I, if he's in here,

2774
02:34:30,311 --> 02:34:33,520
he wouldn't leave you alone. Who usually
putting his head in your lap like hello?

2775
02:34:33,820 --> 02:34:37,300
Like he just, he'll drop to his back all
the time. Just come on. Belly rubbed me.

2776
02:34:37,570 --> 02:34:38,500
Like if he meets you,

2777
02:34:38,501 --> 02:34:41,500
he'll start whining and he runs around
in circles and then he drops his basic

2778
02:34:41,501 --> 02:34:44,920
rub my belly. Come on in here and you
know you went to and he just want love.

2779
02:34:45,550 --> 02:34:48,460
Constantly want love and
hugs. My Day. Every day.

2780
02:34:48,461 --> 02:34:49,990
I'm not going to lie for a long time.

2781
02:34:50,500 --> 02:34:52,390
Not having a dog at the
house is so strange.

2782
02:34:52,391 --> 02:34:55,750
And because you said when you come home
and not have anything, sometimes it's,

2783
02:34:55,810 --> 02:34:58,630
it's a little overwhelming. Yeah. It's
nice to have something to be like, hey,

2784
02:34:58,690 --> 02:35:01,370
it's great for lonely people.
Oh my God. By herself.

2785
02:35:01,570 --> 02:35:05,770
It makes a big difference having a dog.
Do you criminalize second? What? Wait.

2786
02:35:05,940 --> 02:35:07,300
It came through.
Oh my God.

2787
02:35:07,301 --> 02:35:10,030
I thought you said it didn't pass this
morning and said it didn't it 15 minutes

2788
02:35:10,031 --> 02:35:12,790
ago.
Shit.

2789
02:35:12,940 --> 02:35:17,940
Denver became the first city in
the u s to decriminalize marijuana.

2790
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:24,070
Wow. Powerful Denver. Wow.

2791
02:35:24,310 --> 02:35:25,660
Holy Shit Man.

2792
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:29,230
It passed for voters approved measure
decriminalized psychedelic mushrooms can.

2793
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:30,850
Congratulations.
Amazing.

2794
02:35:31,450 --> 02:35:35,380
How did we think they eat better
information? You son of a bitch.

2795
02:35:35,410 --> 02:35:38,260
They were staying at all
night for some reason.

2796
02:35:38,261 --> 02:35:42,240
They did say son of a bitch.
Jamie working with the CIA.

2797
02:35:42,280 --> 02:35:45,310
Still unofficial apparently though as
close to it on Wednesday afternoon,

2798
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:48,160
ended up pulling 51 pulled
ahead this afternoon.

2799
02:35:48,161 --> 02:35:51,370
That's why this morning it wasn't
a head and then they still,

2800
02:35:51,371 --> 02:35:52,300
they're still counting votes.

2801
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:55,450
The provisions prohibit the
city government or using
any resources to impose

2802
02:35:55,451 --> 02:35:57,780
criminal penalties against adults over
21 years of age or personally he's

2803
02:35:57,790 --> 02:35:59,110
possession of psychosocial seven hey,

2804
02:35:59,111 --> 02:36:01,210
you don't have to talk about
during the end of a commercial.

2805
02:36:01,240 --> 02:36:03,880
What do you want to do it? You have to
get it all out just in case. No, no, no.

2806
02:36:03,881 --> 02:36:04,490
This is not a discount.

2807
02:36:04,490 --> 02:36:07,260
What if something hits us
and kill somebody knows the
fuck you just said. Yeah,

2808
02:36:07,270 --> 02:36:11,730
it is. That's just the funny thing
about those commercials and the flood.

2809
02:36:11,731 --> 02:36:12,440
A little, little, little, little,

2810
02:36:12,440 --> 02:36:17,440
little [inaudible] doing it so fast they
can't because they just easily get it

2811
02:36:18,221 --> 02:36:21,580
out legally. It's gray, but it's so
gross. Yeah. They just have to get it out.

2812
02:36:21,610 --> 02:36:23,290
When I first started hearing that,
I'm like,

2813
02:36:23,291 --> 02:36:28,150
there's a job for fast talking
bullshitters it's safe like the rapper Mac

2814
02:36:28,151 --> 02:36:30,040
lethal. Not that he's a
fast talker and bullshitter,

2815
02:36:30,041 --> 02:36:33,460
but he wrapped so fast and uh,
do you know he is? Yeah. Dude,

2816
02:36:33,700 --> 02:36:35,370
he could barely hear half of
the shit comes out of his mouth.

2817
02:36:35,380 --> 02:36:40,230
You can hear it pretty clear.
Sometimes pretty fucking clear.

2818
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:43,150
Pretty fucking. When he does the wraps in
the morning. I've seen some of his shit.

2819
02:36:43,151 --> 02:36:45,820
Dude, that's a talent. Yeah, that's,

2820
02:36:46,260 --> 02:36:49,360
I mean the way he does it is
incredible. Yeah. He's got dunning.

2821
02:36:49,390 --> 02:36:50,500
Like I hear it and I just go,

2822
02:36:50,501 --> 02:36:53,110
I don't even understand how the
fuck tongue can move that fast,

2823
02:36:53,320 --> 02:36:56,380
but it makes sense. Like do you ever
do something with your right hand?

2824
02:36:56,381 --> 02:36:58,960
Like he'd go like this really fast
and I'll try it with your left hand.

2825
02:36:58,961 --> 02:37:01,280
It's like they can't do it all.
It's like, yeah, like I can,

2826
02:37:01,290 --> 02:37:04,660
I can tap this real fast but I can't,
I can't really do with my left hand.

2827
02:37:04,780 --> 02:37:07,070
Exactly. That's tapping
is a good example. Yeah.

2828
02:37:07,480 --> 02:37:09,850
You got to think that your face
is like that too, but your mouth,

2829
02:37:09,851 --> 02:37:13,290
it's got to be quick. You gonna
Move Advisor won't Pfizer, Pamela.

2830
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:15,070
I went to an auction basically.
Hey,

2831
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:20,480
otherwise I've got to ride dad. Dad.

2832
02:37:20,481 --> 02:37:23,780
Keeping up with your face with
the noises is that same skill.

2833
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:27,100
It's the same way that a buffer brothers
were able to do that thing that they're

2834
02:37:27,110 --> 02:37:31,820
able to do. No, there's something,
there's something about it. I know,

2835
02:37:31,821 --> 02:37:32,900
but there's something about it.
Well,

2836
02:37:32,901 --> 02:37:34,880
there's definitely something
about the rhythm that he does.

2837
02:37:34,881 --> 02:37:37,760
The rhythm that he announces this. It's
like, it's so specific that you're like,

2838
02:37:37,761 --> 02:37:42,440
wow, this is really, it's such a unique
talent. Bruce is different than anybody.

2839
02:37:42,620 --> 02:37:46,940
Anybody that's ever done that kind of
shit because he gets fucking crazy.

2840
02:37:47,150 --> 02:37:48,440
Like he's perfect for MMA.

2841
02:37:48,470 --> 02:37:53,470
He gets so amped up because most people
are just professional in the red corner

2842
02:37:53,750 --> 02:37:57,350
coming from Los Angeles,
California, stitch it up.

2843
02:37:57,410 --> 02:38:00,980
Joe Schilling,
you know what I mean?

2844
02:38:01,100 --> 02:38:05,970
But Bruce fucking screen,
he goes fighting. Yeah.

2845
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:10,480
The way he yells. It's
so fucking true. Ooh.

2846
02:38:11,370 --> 02:38:13,670
He gets crazy perfect for MMA.

2847
02:38:13,730 --> 02:38:16,370
It must amp up the fight are so fucking
much they might do when they hear your

2848
02:38:16,371 --> 02:38:19,790
name, you're just going to be like,
and he's almost having a heart attack.

2849
02:38:19,940 --> 02:38:22,430
If he takes to tend to
have a heart attack,

2850
02:38:22,580 --> 02:38:26,870
Bruce buffer gets to five every fucking
show. Look at them there. I mean,

2851
02:38:27,140 --> 02:38:29,420
he's not dying.
He's in great shape,

2852
02:38:29,690 --> 02:38:34,670
but he gets to halfway to a heart
attack every fucking time. Like,

2853
02:38:34,671 --> 02:38:38,570
look, I'll ready gets bro. I mean
you, he's putting it out there.

2854
02:38:38,780 --> 02:38:43,070
That's why he's so much different than
any other ring announcer ever because you

2855
02:38:43,071 --> 02:38:46,520
can't just do that. Like if you
go back and watch his early days,

2856
02:38:46,521 --> 02:38:49,910
he wasn't really doing it like that.
Like she developed his style.

2857
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,290
Look how cool that is,
man.

2858
02:38:51,440 --> 02:38:55,820
Him and Tj Dillashaw fucking bombed out.
Pumped.

2859
02:38:55,821 --> 02:38:56,870
Is he right there?

2860
02:38:58,100 --> 02:39:02,480
That's telling you about
Bruce buffer pumps people the
fuck up, man. Look at that.

2861
02:39:02,481 --> 02:39:07,100
That's intense, man. That's
intense. Whoo. That's so exciting.

2862
02:39:07,700 --> 02:39:11,000
He's awesome. He said she character
too, man. He's perfect suits.

2863
02:39:11,001 --> 02:39:13,880
He's always got a different
one. Yeah, he's always looking.
She always looks sharp,

2864
02:39:14,060 --> 02:39:15,440
sharp as long as it's real fucking shot.

2865
02:39:15,450 --> 02:39:19,910
But it's interesting that like that
style of announcing really didn't exist

2866
02:39:20,060 --> 02:39:23,390
before Bruce. Right. And
before MMA, like it didn't,

2867
02:39:23,391 --> 02:39:24,860
it was not appropriate for boxing.

2868
02:39:25,130 --> 02:39:29,810
Like he had this air of old man class
kind of still that you had to abide by

2869
02:39:29,811 --> 02:39:34,160
these rules and they still have a bell
thing come out and hit the bell with the

2870
02:39:34,161 --> 02:39:38,580
thing. Well I mean, I mean w the would
clap still happens across the board for,

2871
02:39:38,610 --> 02:39:41,540
for boxing and MMA. Yes. Yes. Warning.

2872
02:39:41,950 --> 02:39:44,750
Second warning is still a thing.
Yeah.

2873
02:39:44,810 --> 02:39:47,330
Like how come they have an upgraded
that to a sound? I don't understand.

2874
02:39:47,420 --> 02:39:50,570
What's a good quote? That's a good point
because sometimes people get confused.

2875
02:39:50,571 --> 02:39:54,350
It's happening even with professionals
and they misinterpret the would clap as

2876
02:39:54,351 --> 02:39:56,900
being the end of the round because just
cause they're so in the groove right

2877
02:39:56,930 --> 02:39:57,051
there.

2878
02:39:57,051 --> 02:39:59,970
Like what happened did that was at the
end of the round and they'll stop and the

2879
02:40:00,130 --> 02:40:02,750
ref go now I'll keep going
and you have 10 seconds left.

2880
02:40:02,751 --> 02:40:05,750
And then like sometimes weird stuff
happens where guys get out of their mental

2881
02:40:05,751 --> 02:40:07,770
pattern. Sure. It's happened many times.

2882
02:40:07,771 --> 02:40:10,070
It's got to also be the noise of
an arena sometimes can take over.

2883
02:40:10,071 --> 02:40:12,560
I'm sure something gets
distracted here that you think,

2884
02:40:12,561 --> 02:40:14,040
was that a yell or was that the clap?
Like do

2885
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:17,940
I have 10 seconds left her dewine so
we're going to be in Chicago for that big

2886
02:40:17,941 --> 02:40:22,710
fight. Fucking oh shit was going
to be fine. What does that, June,

2887
02:40:23,940 --> 02:40:26,970
what does that, what does June 8th
right? June 8th. Right now I don't,

2888
02:40:27,530 --> 02:40:29,890
I don't think there's any tickets
left if anybody wants. No,

2889
02:40:29,940 --> 02:40:33,720
I doubt it pretty close. But there's
a, that's a big UFC card too, isn't it?

2890
02:40:34,290 --> 02:40:38,100
Who's on that car? Uh, I just saw this
morning, I just looked this morning,

2891
02:40:39,360 --> 02:40:43,850
Henry Cejudo versus Marlin Mariah's
for the bantamweight title. Ooh.

2892
02:40:44,030 --> 02:40:46,470
She has the opportunity
to become champ champ.

2893
02:40:47,760 --> 02:40:52,530
And then I'm Ma Marlin rise.
Fucking fantastic fighter. Yeah,

2894
02:40:52,531 --> 02:40:56,270
that's a great card. Jimmy
Rivera. Petra Yawn. Yawn.

2895
02:40:56,560 --> 02:40:57,730
Pyotr I think it's just,

2896
02:40:57,760 --> 02:41:02,280
we'll say the pure to pure Tra fuel truck,

2897
02:41:03,090 --> 02:41:07,600
Russian character. Valentina Shevchenko
versus Jessica. I, that's great. Fight to,

2898
02:41:08,430 --> 02:41:12,660
um, that's such a great name. So chanko
yeah. Such a great fucking Badass.

2899
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:16,380
I fuck you up. Name that. Hold
on. Stop scrolling back up.

2900
02:41:16,550 --> 02:41:21,030
It's Tatiana Suarez is a B stew.
That woman is so good.

2901
02:41:21,031 --> 02:41:23,790
She's probably the best
wrestler in female MMA.

2902
02:41:23,820 --> 02:41:28,410
She smashes people and need
an Sar off is fantastic.

2903
02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:32,370
That's a great fight. That's um,
Amanda Nunez. His girlfriend too.

2904
02:41:32,820 --> 02:41:37,410
Amanda Nunez is probably the
baddest woman. Literally ever. Oh,

2905
02:41:37,420 --> 02:41:40,260
we met her, right? Yeah, she
was at the last, she's the
one that knocked out. Cyborg.

2906
02:41:40,410 --> 02:41:45,410
Cyborg was the baddest woman in MMA when
Amanda Knew Nunez starched her in the

2907
02:41:45,451 --> 02:41:49,590
first round. There's no one you
could literally legitimately
give that title too.

2908
02:41:49,620 --> 02:41:51,810
It's Amanda Nunez.
She's the baddest woman ever.

2909
02:41:52,530 --> 02:41:56,130
Aljamain sterling versus page on Munoz.
That's a gray card.

2910
02:41:56,550 --> 02:42:01,500
Ricardo Lamas. Calvin or that's
a great fight to shit. A lot of,

2911
02:42:01,501 --> 02:42:04,590
a lot of chicks. A lot of checks be
fighting. A lot of Chicago girls.

2912
02:42:04,591 --> 02:42:07,270
It's not Chicago girls angry
for getting ready to fly.

2913
02:42:07,270 --> 02:42:10,690
Tamp fucking tie into this town.
That's you guys. That's Boston.

2914
02:42:11,010 --> 02:42:15,330
Chicago girls are more, I don't know
how to say the Chicago. Chicago's no,

2915
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:20,700
fuck a talented. He's Tan. Kiss my ass.
I'll fuck you up drill. Say That I ass.

2916
02:42:20,701 --> 02:42:21,630
Yeah.
Fuck you.

2917
02:42:22,220 --> 02:42:26,340
Chicago is an interesting combination
with like Midwest and urban,

2918
02:42:26,430 --> 02:42:31,110
like it's a city. It's like, it's
like cosmopolitan. It's sophisticated,

2919
02:42:31,111 --> 02:42:34,770
but it's also the city in the Midwest.
That's what it is. It wouldn't be. Yeah,

2920
02:42:34,771 --> 02:42:37,290
that's right in the middle
of fucking Ohio Turd.

2921
02:42:37,500 --> 02:42:42,090
So they get so jealous when we say that
Columbus has an argument that it might

2922
02:42:42,091 --> 02:42:42,930
be better than Chicago.

2923
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:46,850
No other city in the Midwest has an
argument that a lot of people that that's

2924
02:42:46,860 --> 02:42:49,710
like where you would graduate from if
you've got tired or too big for Columbus

2925
02:42:49,730 --> 02:42:52,980
and he move over to see how far you drive.
Six hours.

2926
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:56,280
It's not bad to make it to San
Francisco. Yeah. It's not bad at all.

2927
02:42:56,370 --> 02:42:59,280
But all the cities in the Midwest
compete with Chicago and they all know.

2928
02:42:59,340 --> 02:43:02,040
They fucking know. I mean, it
was who would be, who would
beat us? Who'd be better?

2929
02:43:02,070 --> 02:43:05,880
Detroit, Kansas City, St Louis.
Detroit's in a bad spot. Indianapolis.

2930
02:43:05,910 --> 02:43:07,620
None of these places have
the things that we have.

2931
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:10,880
Don't kick Detroit while it's down. No,
no. I like to try to what you're doing,

2932
02:43:10,920 --> 02:43:14,200
I them, they're just not as much tone.
Their industry fell apart and Chicago,

2933
02:43:14,800 --> 02:43:17,080
Milwaukee, I mean all these other
cities, they're great cities,

2934
02:43:17,081 --> 02:43:18,340
but I'm not Chicago.

2935
02:43:18,430 --> 02:43:23,430
Really crazy is that Detroit in the
1950s was the richest city in the world.

2936
02:43:24,400 --> 02:43:26,890
Sure. World. Yeah. It's
a lot of wealth up.

2937
02:43:26,891 --> 02:43:29,560
They're getting so many people
in the automotive industry. Well,

2938
02:43:29,561 --> 02:43:34,060
that time when they were at the top of
the automotive industry and they were

2939
02:43:34,061 --> 02:43:38,710
making cars that were coveted throughout
the world and all the manufacturing was

2940
02:43:38,711 --> 02:43:42,250
done there, she wasn't the richest
city in the world at one point in time.

2941
02:43:42,460 --> 02:43:46,720
Now it's one of the poorest. It's less
than a century later. It's really crazy.

2942
02:43:46,900 --> 02:43:50,680
There's not another city like that
that hasn't had like some sort of a

2943
02:43:50,681 --> 02:43:55,160
catastrophe, like something hit
it like it just went away. Yep.

2944
02:43:55,440 --> 02:43:58,690
Detroit as, I mean I, it's
actually a wonderful fucking city.

2945
02:43:58,691 --> 02:44:01,990
I actually do love to try it. It
is really sad. Yeah. It's sad.

2946
02:44:01,991 --> 02:44:04,600
When you go up there cause you,
you see remnants of what was,

2947
02:44:04,601 --> 02:44:07,750
it's really strange to see what,
what happened with GM and all that shit.

2948
02:44:07,780 --> 02:44:09,670
You could buy a house for $100

2949
02:44:12,130 --> 02:44:16,270
that's not funny. Now you can kind of
a bitch. Why you laughing? You must be,

2950
02:44:16,660 --> 02:44:18,660
don't tell me jokes person.

2951
02:44:19,120 --> 02:44:20,820
I think it's funny that you
could buy a house when you,

2952
02:44:20,821 --> 02:44:22,840
while you can't buy a
house out here for fucking,

2953
02:44:23,020 --> 02:44:25,630
you can't even buy a house for a
hundred grand. Nope. Not even people.

2954
02:44:25,630 --> 02:44:28,570
We tell people that like you can't buy
a house for $100,000 it's like, no,

2955
02:44:28,571 --> 02:44:31,630
you can't. And impossible.
I think a what? Impossible.

2956
02:44:31,970 --> 02:44:34,270
Like if you live in Sugarland,
Texas,

2957
02:44:34,480 --> 02:44:38,530
you can get a pretty decent house
for like 150 grand, like Nice House.

2958
02:44:39,490 --> 02:44:42,440
Not here. Not Fuck that. Not even
close people. What's the what?

2959
02:44:42,450 --> 02:44:45,940
What is it like in Ohio cheap looking
on Detroit. Zillow. This is $1,000.

2960
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,580
It's foreclosed though.
Thousand Bucks. It's nice house.

2961
02:44:48,581 --> 02:44:51,730
Let's go there and start a podcast studio,
our next podcast,

2962
02:44:51,731 --> 02:44:54,340
studio downstream match.
And if we just decided to do that,

2963
02:44:54,460 --> 02:44:58,540
we decided to armor plate a fucking
house. Have a guard there, 24,

2964
02:44:58,541 --> 02:45:03,400
seven and helicopter in. We'll fly in
brow this regular flights to Detroit,

2965
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:07,300
and then we have a Detroit version
of our podcast and kind of fun,

2966
02:45:07,450 --> 02:45:10,920
but we have to wheel in our electronics
or they'll try to steal it. Yeah,

2967
02:45:11,020 --> 02:45:15,190
I mean that's just not smart.
Detroit is like too dangerous.

2968
02:45:15,400 --> 02:45:19,630
We have to go somewhere more rural, but
also ridiculous. Can we go main? Yeah.

2969
02:45:19,631 --> 02:45:22,700
Main Bank. Gorman far out. Oh, come
on, bro. Don't be scared, man. C'Mon.

2970
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:23,553
Let's go somewhere close.

2971
02:45:23,560 --> 02:45:27,190
We'd get all those cool people
from northern California.
Let's go up to like, uh,

2972
02:45:27,880 --> 02:45:32,710
like, like, like, like Napas area.
Like, hmm. Okay. Well let's go.

2973
02:45:32,711 --> 02:45:36,370
But that plays burns every couple of
years. Bad. Yeah, I guess it does. Yeah.

2974
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:38,590
What about, okay, well what, what
by the ocean? We'll do like Carmel,

2975
02:45:38,770 --> 02:45:41,590
Carmel by the sea. You tuffle
C'mon. Let's see. Hormel's gorgeous.

2976
02:45:42,320 --> 02:45:45,370
I like how you're talking. That's where
Clint Eastwood film play misty for me.

2977
02:45:45,400 --> 02:45:49,630
That's where he lives, right? Well,
he was the mayor of Carmel. Oh Shit.

2978
02:45:49,690 --> 02:45:52,570
He won your mayor.
Can't it can't stop that guy.

2979
02:45:53,260 --> 02:45:55,380
Why aren't we going where
the mushrooms illegal? Oh,

2980
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:58,540
too many people to move in in
Denver, man. Too many people,

2981
02:45:59,300 --> 02:46:01,100
too many people are moving with that.
Look it up.

2982
02:46:01,101 --> 02:46:02,950
Look it up about Denver's problem
with their infrastructure.

2983
02:46:02,951 --> 02:46:05,380
They're hating how many people are
coming into their city. Listen Bro,

2984
02:46:05,381 --> 02:46:08,500
you moved to evergreen live
in the mountains. Savage.

2985
02:46:08,530 --> 02:46:10,280
I'll move to Breck Elvis
album to breakfast.

2986
02:46:10,610 --> 02:46:15,080
How about Aspen? That's a rich. When he
coke Breckenridge is nice. I like Breck.

2987
02:46:15,170 --> 02:46:19,400
Don't you want to see y'all girls yelled
or boyfriends and scream out in this

2988
02:46:19,401 --> 02:46:24,380
treat with naked
is we need more money.

2989
02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:27,320
Is the mushroom legality,
is that going to be like a doctor thing?

2990
02:46:27,340 --> 02:46:31,450
Are they going to like, no,
it's deep. Criminalized is,

2991
02:46:31,451 --> 02:46:35,330
is that you don't go to go. You don't go
to jail but you can't sell it legally.

2992
02:46:35,340 --> 02:46:39,860
It's very squirrely but it's what it
is is step one and that's what we need.

2993
02:46:40,070 --> 02:46:44,420
We need step one and then it's also
on the ballot in California soon.

2994
02:46:44,730 --> 02:46:48,680
And when it's on the ballot in California,
soon it has a likelier chance here.

2995
02:46:48,681 --> 02:46:52,700
I think that even in Denver and more
so now the real problem is people don't

2996
02:46:52,701 --> 02:46:57,080
understand what it is. Right. And
they think it's just like, oh my God,

2997
02:46:57,081 --> 02:46:59,120
these kids going to do mushrooms
are gonna drive off cliffs.

2998
02:46:59,990 --> 02:47:02,180
That's what people worry about.
You can do more testing now. Right?

2999
02:47:02,181 --> 02:47:04,700
Is that sort of what it helps?
Well, they've done some tasks.

3000
02:47:04,730 --> 02:47:09,200
Johns Hopkins University had some pretty
extensive testing that they did that

3001
02:47:09,201 --> 02:47:10,550
showed,
um,

3002
02:47:10,700 --> 02:47:15,700
real positive results with people
that had terminal illnesses where it

3003
02:47:15,711 --> 02:47:19,550
alleviated the worry of death.
And um,

3004
02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:21,620
there was some other studies
that had been run on it,

3005
02:47:21,621 --> 02:47:26,621
but there's so far no one
has ever instituted in the
United States at least like

3006
02:47:27,831 --> 02:47:30,170
a real thorough,

3007
02:47:30,171 --> 02:47:35,171
comprehensive clinic where you can go and
they can treat you if you have alcohol

3008
02:47:36,021 --> 02:47:37,430
addiction,
Ptsd.

3009
02:47:37,431 --> 02:47:39,530
There's a lot of different things
they could treat with psilocybin.

3010
02:47:40,070 --> 02:47:44,240
And it's been illegal
because it's a schedule one
substance. So all these people,

3011
02:47:44,241 --> 02:47:46,460
it's one of the best
things on earth to fix,

3012
02:47:46,640 --> 02:47:48,830
like mental barriers and
problems that you have,

3013
02:47:48,831 --> 02:47:53,090
especially if it was done in a controlled
clinical environment by people you

3014
02:47:53,091 --> 02:47:56,810
trusted and you felt safe. And that's
what a shaman is supposed to be, right?

3015
02:47:57,140 --> 02:47:58,060
What a shaman is supposed to be.

3016
02:47:58,090 --> 02:48:02,030
So many provides you with the psychedelic
substances in a controlled state with

3017
02:48:02,031 --> 02:48:05,870
they, they let you be in a good state
of mind set and setting is always very,

3018
02:48:05,871 --> 02:48:08,600
very important.
And if we could do that,

3019
02:48:08,840 --> 02:48:12,050
I mean I really think we have a real
good chance of turning a lot of people

3020
02:48:12,051 --> 02:48:15,410
around. People that are
addicted to things, people
with psychological problems,

3021
02:48:15,411 --> 02:48:18,980
people that can't see themselves should
have a lot of, lot of different issues.

3022
02:48:19,070 --> 02:48:24,050
And it's one of the best tools for that.
But like every tool, it could be abused,

3023
02:48:24,530 --> 02:48:28,250
but the problem is not the tool.
The problem is abused,

3024
02:48:28,251 --> 02:48:32,780
whether it's with alcohol or pills
or food or any of these things.

3025
02:48:32,781 --> 02:48:35,840
We're talking about sex.
People can abuse anything of course,

3026
02:48:35,960 --> 02:48:40,640
but it doesn't mean that silicide
and isn't in an amazing compound that

3027
02:48:40,641 --> 02:48:43,550
literally can change humanity.
It can.

3028
02:48:43,640 --> 02:48:45,770
Yeah, it has. It has. It does.
And there's so many other,

3029
02:48:45,980 --> 02:48:47,510
there are so many other things
that we don't even know.

3030
02:48:47,511 --> 02:48:49,220
We haven't even tapped
into the possibilities.

3031
02:48:49,221 --> 02:48:51,380
That's the other thing was when you
limit yourself on the possibilities,

3032
02:48:51,381 --> 02:48:53,610
it's like, well, we don't,
how do we know what happens?

3033
02:48:53,611 --> 02:48:54,530
How do you know what it's going to do?

3034
02:48:54,650 --> 02:48:59,180
What if the chip releases mushroom juice
every 15 minutes? A little micro dose.

3035
02:49:00,300 --> 02:49:04,310
Just a little micro dose. No, it feels
your levels when you start getting angry.

3036
02:49:04,311 --> 02:49:07,980
When they got cuts me off and I'm like,
you fucking asshole releases and I'm

3037
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:12,540
like, a little bit of God
juice. I'm fine. You are fine.

3038
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:16,080
Aren't you going somewhere this weekend?
Were you at when Vegas? Oh Jesus.

3039
02:49:16,081 --> 02:49:18,630
Would he do in Vegas? What
are you doing? Jimmy Kimmel.

3040
02:49:18,631 --> 02:49:19,680
Just open up and call it out there.

3041
02:49:20,180 --> 02:49:23,310
Do you think it was from Vegas and he
opened up a comedy club, I think. Uh,

3042
02:49:23,460 --> 02:49:27,450
what day are you there? Uh,
Friday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

3043
02:49:27,780 --> 02:49:31,560
And who you work with, you
know, uh, I'm taken, uh,

3044
02:49:31,650 --> 02:49:35,880
taken young Ari Mannis
excellence. Excellence. Yeah.

3045
02:49:35,940 --> 02:49:39,240
Be a Vegas and then two weeks ago
to rally before I go to Chicago,

3046
02:49:39,270 --> 02:49:42,120
I got up Charlie. Good night. Good nights
baby. Oh, it's just good nights now.

3047
02:49:42,180 --> 02:49:44,460
I think it's about, yeah, just
good night's comedy. He brought it,

3048
02:49:44,490 --> 02:49:48,370
but it's the same, same setup. Same Shit
to beautiful club raw. That's another one.

3049
02:49:48,371 --> 02:49:51,630
That small kind of intimate, it's a
two legged two, two l Raleigh's great,

3050
02:49:51,660 --> 02:49:54,930
great town. I got family from North
Carolina, so I'll be seeing some north.

3051
02:49:54,931 --> 02:49:59,310
That's like a really cool town. Cool.
College towns. Hip. Yes. The vibe.

3052
02:49:59,340 --> 02:50:03,090
The vibe is really cool. The
vibe. The five is cool, cool.

3053
02:50:03,091 --> 02:50:05,540
Cats out there and no smoking.
Cigarette painting,

3054
02:50:06,450 --> 02:50:10,320
chill and making jazz man.
That's who they are.

3055
02:50:10,321 --> 02:50:14,190
Shows Cooler which shows like that
all the time, man. Which I was a cat.

3056
02:50:14,191 --> 02:50:17,100
Get a champion. You'll be together.
You'll get a little bit for advice.

3057
02:50:17,130 --> 02:50:21,340
Just ask me anything man.
Magic chips become the new law.

3058
02:50:21,341 --> 02:50:23,360
Bottomy like in the future they were,

3059
02:50:23,370 --> 02:50:27,000
I can't believe these people let
themselves get chipped and the chip just

3060
02:50:27,001 --> 02:50:29,730
deteriorates inside of you and
starts rotting your NeuroQore.

3061
02:50:29,990 --> 02:50:33,960
We start to fucking slowly, slowly
turn into machining. You, you,

3062
02:50:33,961 --> 02:50:36,600
you can read minds for the first
10 years, Denny, get Parkinson's.

3063
02:50:37,440 --> 02:50:42,390
Fuck sacrifice dude. You thinking in 10
years I'll fix it. I'll fix it by then.

3064
02:50:42,960 --> 02:50:44,190
10 years.
We do that all the time.

3065
02:50:44,560 --> 02:50:46,140
It's not a cure by the time
that we're done with it.

3066
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:49,990
I've seen people say that about
cigarettes. I think, you know,

3067
02:50:50,990 --> 02:50:54,660
I wish I didn't have to smoke, but I do.
And I'm thinking they're going to fix it.

3068
02:50:54,840 --> 02:50:56,310
They're going to fix it with medics,
mate.

3069
02:50:56,460 --> 02:50:58,020
I've got to fix it with
Madison about Jules.

3070
02:50:58,021 --> 02:51:00,610
What about these electronic cigarettes?
That's next close.

3071
02:51:01,320 --> 02:51:05,190
They're so close to being able to
reverse cancer by the time I get cancer,

3072
02:51:05,790 --> 02:51:10,020
my mother, I dunno, my mother's going to
die from cancer, but maybe not me. Not me,

3073
02:51:10,170 --> 02:51:14,340
not me, bro. All these other
younger generation does
suck and not the electronic.

3074
02:51:14,341 --> 02:51:17,940
The robot. Dick's. I think that's going
to kill him. I Dunno. That's going to,

3075
02:51:17,941 --> 02:51:22,110
I think there's gonna be some shit in
there. Did you pens? Fuck yeah, thanks.

3076
02:51:22,710 --> 02:51:26,370
How do you know what's in those
you ask and they'll tell you.

3077
02:51:26,550 --> 02:51:30,510
Why are they lying to you then why would
they tell you? Cause you're so stupid.

3078
02:51:30,511 --> 02:51:33,210
You're willing to smoke a robot. Did they
tell you the truth of what's in there?

3079
02:51:33,211 --> 02:51:35,060
You think they're going to keep
selling them? They could sell them.

3080
02:51:35,080 --> 02:51:39,330
They had skulls and crossbones on it
with a, with a person with x's for eyes.

3081
02:51:39,331 --> 02:51:44,250
Like right there. Like people die
from this. This, yeah. Choke to death.

3082
02:51:44,251 --> 02:51:46,920
Cigarettes like cigarettes in Europe,
they have the packet they had,

3083
02:51:46,921 --> 02:51:49,470
they've show pictures of people with
like lung cancer. Oh this happens.

3084
02:51:49,471 --> 02:51:54,120
People at giant warnings not telling
me. Oh. Fark Foskett keeps smoking.

3085
02:51:54,180 --> 02:51:56,280
Did you ever smoke when you
were young? No, I tried it.

3086
02:51:56,700 --> 02:51:59,820
I tried it when I was 15 me and my
sister tried it. She kept smoking.

3087
02:51:59,880 --> 02:52:02,730
She smoked for years and now she's quit.
She quit.

3088
02:52:02,731 --> 02:52:06,130
Eventually she quit when she had
kids. What about, what about a robot?

3089
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:09,430
Cigars. You never smoked cigars? Yeah,
I like cigars. I smoke cigars. Yeah.

3090
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:11,840
I used to have some here,
but I don't want anymore and none of them.

3091
02:52:11,841 --> 02:52:14,780
Well now they have weed in them.
Yeah. It wasn't my favorite sectors.

3092
02:52:15,090 --> 02:52:19,550
It's a different thing like the cigar
with no weed is like that speedy kinda

3093
02:52:19,560 --> 02:52:24,460
relax. See, weird high. People don't
know. If you don't smoke cigars,

3094
02:52:24,490 --> 02:52:29,180
you get high. This is why like
Republicans who are anti-drug,

3095
02:52:29,260 --> 02:52:34,190
who smokes cigars and like whiskey,
shut your dirty mouth. You're on drugs.

3096
02:52:34,510 --> 02:52:37,150
Okay, they, these are, you're
on a substance. Yeah. You're,

3097
02:52:37,180 --> 02:52:39,610
you're altering your state of
consciousness. With cigars,

3098
02:52:39,850 --> 02:52:42,700
they give you a certain
amount of euphoria. Nicotine,

3099
02:52:42,730 --> 02:52:44,890
you get that little buzz from the high,

3100
02:52:45,220 --> 02:52:47,200
like I used to smoke cigars
all the time with Kevin James.

3101
02:52:47,530 --> 02:52:50,200
Kevin James doesn't fuck with weed.
He doesn't really drink,

3102
02:52:50,560 --> 02:52:53,800
but he will smoke the shit out
some cigars and we got fucked up.

3103
02:52:53,830 --> 02:52:57,460
They fuck you up. They do. They do in
a weird way or over that, that it's,

3104
02:52:57,490 --> 02:52:59,650
it's overwhelming. There are a
lot. They're heavy. It's a lie.

3105
02:52:59,651 --> 02:53:00,820
You just want to kind of like,

3106
02:53:01,210 --> 02:53:06,210
I'd like him after a fat steak and I want
to feel like an ugly American of a fat

3107
02:53:06,521 --> 02:53:08,930
Ribeye and then a fucking cube and

3108
02:53:11,860 --> 02:53:14,200
sit on a porch and just
talk shit with your friends.

3109
02:53:14,480 --> 02:53:15,850
You know have a glass of whiskey.

3110
02:53:16,180 --> 02:53:20,380
Yeah and that's a like
a non self aware high.

3111
02:53:20,620 --> 02:53:22,300
Like sometimes you don't want to be,

3112
02:53:22,360 --> 02:53:26,740
you don't want to be like not even
self awareness is the wrong term when a

3113
02:53:26,741 --> 02:53:29,200
really looking for is like self analysis.

3114
02:53:29,450 --> 02:53:32,980
You're not an analyzing yourself and you
smoking a cigar and drinking whiskey.

3115
02:53:33,240 --> 02:53:36,940
You have fun. Yeah. Just
hanging a comeback kicking
back and your brain's not,

3116
02:53:36,941 --> 02:53:38,830
your brain's kind of turned
off and you do those things.

3117
02:53:39,340 --> 02:53:41,200
It's not turned on like the,

3118
02:53:41,220 --> 02:53:43,900
the problem with the weed is all
the good things about the weed.

3119
02:53:43,901 --> 02:53:46,390
The weed is good because it makes
you think and it makes you paranoid.

3120
02:53:46,391 --> 02:53:49,230
It makes you aware and yeah,
he makes you more compassionate.

3121
02:53:49,270 --> 02:53:52,930
It makes you more contemplatives
and makes you more self analytical.

3122
02:53:53,380 --> 02:53:56,470
But it also could freak out sometimes
and maybe that's not what you want that

3123
02:53:56,471 --> 02:54:00,880
day. Maybe that day you just want
to Hoyle de Monterrey double corona.

3124
02:54:02,410 --> 02:54:06,730
Just puff on that bad boy.
You ever inhale?

3125
02:54:06,870 --> 02:54:10,780
Look now at glass of Buffalo.
Trace with a big fucking ice cube.

3126
02:54:11,370 --> 02:54:15,190
I swear to you Peshy when
a big fucking nice big fat.

3127
02:54:15,370 --> 02:54:20,080
Whenever we go and get drinks. Andrew
Santino asks, how big are your ice cube?

3128
02:54:20,680 --> 02:54:25,300
This? We asked like a
whiskey, but you have a,

3129
02:54:25,330 --> 02:54:28,870
do you have a large queue of one
stone and I always look away like this

3130
02:54:29,010 --> 02:54:33,080
motherfucker and aids. I said, do you
have one stone? I just want one stone.

3131
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:36,550
So high maintenance. He wants
a large ball. It got a ball.

3132
02:54:36,551 --> 02:54:38,220
Can you get me a nice ball?
Yeah,

3133
02:54:38,270 --> 02:54:40,060
with the fur balls of ice
because you know what they do.

3134
02:54:40,270 --> 02:54:43,190
Otherwise they scoop a fuck load of ice
in there and it dilutes the whiskey and

3135
02:54:43,191 --> 02:54:45,940
it's all water. I don't like it.
No. My friend John Dudley does,

3136
02:54:46,010 --> 02:54:50,320
it wasn't play games. He takes a
pan of water, like a large pan,

3137
02:54:50,590 --> 02:54:55,450
and then he puts it in the trade or grills
and he sets it to super smoke and the

3138
02:54:55,451 --> 02:54:59,710
smoke is constantly pumping into the
water. It leaves it there for hours.

3139
02:54:59,980 --> 02:55:03,980
Then he takes that smoke filled
water and he pours it into those

3140
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:04,813
ball.

3141
02:55:05,260 --> 02:55:09,730
So he makes those molds with
smoke infused water. I love him.

3142
02:55:09,750 --> 02:55:14,750
Then he puts dat in the glass and
the Whiskey, he knows and I'm like,

3143
02:55:14,751 --> 02:55:17,900
Whoa, that's next level.
And like that shit smoked.

3144
02:55:17,901 --> 02:55:20,600
It smoked and you gotta break up. You're
supposed to break those bottles on hand.

3145
02:55:20,620 --> 02:55:23,660
Yeah. Who is it? WHO's out
there doing that? What does
that, oh, that's the wedge.

3146
02:55:23,661 --> 02:55:26,950
I've seen this. Yeah. What is
this? Communism. What does it it?

3147
02:55:27,380 --> 02:55:31,280
It's half ice. Half glass.
Get that shit out of my face.

3148
02:55:32,060 --> 02:55:36,920
God Damn hippies. Fucking hippies.
What else? You got your own cold brew.

3149
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:41,520
Ha. Yeah. Homemade. That's like, go to
see if you could find you want to be,

3150
02:55:42,220 --> 02:55:45,210
prove your wizardry skills
cause I know he has them. Yeah.

3151
02:55:45,680 --> 02:55:50,680
Try to find John Dudley smoked
ice balls on the Instagram.

3152
02:55:51,621 --> 02:55:55,880
Good luck. He'll find it. He'll find
it within sex. Rager smoke balls.

3153
02:55:55,940 --> 02:56:00,620
He calls him smokey balls. So he
makes him doesn't himself. Yeah,

3154
02:56:00,621 --> 02:56:02,610
he makes it doesn't himself
like in his backyard.

3155
02:56:02,611 --> 02:56:06,350
And he started already got I got, I got
to bring it up to see if it makes sense.

3156
02:56:06,830 --> 02:56:08,750
I can't,
if he gave me time,

3157
02:56:08,751 --> 02:56:10,610
I wouldn't be able to convince
her if I can't do that shit.

3158
02:56:10,611 --> 02:56:13,430
He was doing it while he's operating
the camera. So here's John's, uh,

3159
02:56:13,490 --> 02:56:17,660
he's going to grill running. So he's
got that, that pan fill with water.

3160
02:56:17,870 --> 02:56:21,610
There is smoke in it.
Yeah. And, and this is a,

3161
02:56:21,620 --> 02:56:24,980
he's got the insulated top
on it because he's in Iowa.

3162
02:56:25,350 --> 02:56:26,810
It's freezing fucking cold.

3163
02:56:27,050 --> 02:56:31,320
And then he pours that
smokey water into the molds.

3164
02:56:32,360 --> 02:56:34,290
Dun, Dun, Dun. Okay. Balls

3165
02:56:35,860 --> 02:56:39,560
trying to give fucked up kids.
Ooh.

3166
02:56:39,800 --> 02:56:44,190
Smoky balls, Cat Lady.
That crazy shit. So yeah,

3167
02:56:44,270 --> 02:56:48,950
that was when we were in Lanai when we
were little. And I, John, John and I have,

3168
02:56:49,130 --> 02:56:51,890
we've tied it on, man.
We've tied it on many times,

3169
02:56:51,891 --> 02:56:55,070
but we did one podcast with a bunch
of bow hunters and we got fucked up.

3170
02:56:55,071 --> 02:57:00,071
We're drinking everything in the mini
cabinet and a w the minibar had red bull

3171
02:57:01,070 --> 02:57:05,360
and red wine and Tequila and a,
what else?

3172
02:57:05,361 --> 02:57:08,870
Die Coke and John Dudley mix it
all up and call it a cat lady.

3173
02:57:09,760 --> 02:57:13,850
Cause just like some crazy shit fucked
up. And we were all drinking. I had no,

3174
02:57:13,851 --> 02:57:14,840
there was no diet coke.

3175
02:57:15,020 --> 02:57:19,970
It was red bull Tequila and red wine.
That's what it was.

3176
02:57:20,060 --> 02:57:23,120
It was the damn delicious.
What are so trashy?

3177
02:57:23,121 --> 02:57:27,740
I was going to say when we were high as
fuck and we're just trashed trying to go

3178
02:57:27,741 --> 02:57:32,030
to your fucked up. The kids who do
the suicide, you know that every,

3179
02:57:32,060 --> 02:57:34,640
every fucking kind of soda
and the machine. It's only
good because you're like,

3180
02:57:34,670 --> 02:57:38,270
Eh, this is supposed to be fun. We were
just having a good time doing a podcast,

3181
02:57:38,390 --> 02:57:43,010
you know, having a good time. Just
drinking ridiculous shit. Bullshit.

3182
02:57:43,130 --> 02:57:44,330
Yeah,
the Cat Lady,

3183
02:57:44,560 --> 02:57:46,450
it's going to be a thing because now
the internet is gonna be like, well,

3184
02:57:46,451 --> 02:57:48,890
I want to make a cab was a thing
for a while. People were doing it,

3185
02:57:48,891 --> 02:57:52,680
but then they realize why would you do
that when you could have a Margarita or

3186
02:57:52,860 --> 02:57:54,980
have a peer that actually
raised him on their own? Yeah.

3187
02:57:54,990 --> 02:57:59,210
Have a nice glass of wine by itself.
It's just some shit you do when you're,

3188
02:57:59,270 --> 02:58:02,950
you know, you're scratching your
and scavenging and a mini bar.

3189
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:04,710
Whenever you get bored in high,
you create like the most,

3190
02:58:05,190 --> 02:58:06,480
I saw someone on the Internet posted.

3191
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:10,560
They took the ice cream from an ice cream
sandwich and then rice to Rice Krispie

3192
02:58:10,561 --> 02:58:13,590
treats and they put the ice cream
between is it was an ice crispy treat.

3193
02:58:14,210 --> 02:58:16,750
Someone wants them for diabetes.
Aubrey,

3194
02:58:16,860 --> 02:58:18,700
I think we can go with the Burrito
that like ice cream burrito.

3195
02:58:18,701 --> 02:58:22,400
It's going around. I seen that candy and
ice cream and shit. That shit's gross.

3196
02:58:23,290 --> 02:58:28,200
Cub Swanson turned a double double
from in and out into a Taco.

3197
02:58:28,980 --> 02:58:30,080
What?
Yeah.

3198
02:58:30,330 --> 02:58:33,800
He chopped up a double double and put
it into a taco shell asked from me to

3199
02:58:34,040 --> 02:58:37,300
remember us talking about it, whether
or not that's okay. Blasphemy.

3200
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:42,060
You can't fuck with it in and
out. Push things along. God,

3201
02:58:42,440 --> 02:58:46,460
how was that Shit? Taco Bell.
Fucking gross. Gross. Well foul.

3202
02:58:46,680 --> 02:58:49,950
Anybody that eats Taco bell living in
Los Angeles, a shameful human being.

3203
02:58:49,980 --> 02:58:53,340
The amount of good Mexican food
just so it's like it's too much.

3204
02:58:53,341 --> 02:58:55,260
There's too much good.
What is happening here?

3205
02:58:55,950 --> 02:58:59,970
Turn 200 McDonald's burgers
into a Burrito. Yeah, this guy,

3206
02:59:00,420 --> 02:59:02,190
the mealtime guys,
they've been doing this for a while.

3207
02:59:02,190 --> 02:59:05,850
I've been doing this for 10 years. They
stuff it in there. And what is the wrap?

3208
02:59:05,880 --> 02:59:10,380
Is that a Burrito wrap and then
Kevin need to see this. Jamie. Jamie,

3209
02:59:10,440 --> 02:59:13,560
I want to look at your search engine.
I would take away your right to vote.

3210
02:59:14,230 --> 02:59:17,400
I'd be like, there's no way.
Like at different computers.
What's wrong with you?

3211
02:59:17,460 --> 02:59:20,420
That's why it got different.
That's why I got different computers.

3212
02:59:20,421 --> 02:59:21,960
You don't see my other ones, Dan, you.

3213
02:59:22,100 --> 02:59:25,920
I don't know why anybody
now I have different emails.
This is Mr. Happy Easter.

3214
02:59:25,921 --> 02:59:29,760
Happy Lines to get on. This one only
looks for happy things. Flowers,

3215
02:59:29,790 --> 02:59:33,270
different personality for different
computers. This is Mr Dirty.

3216
02:59:33,271 --> 02:59:36,360
This is what I really like.
I like the best organic fertilizer.

3217
02:59:36,361 --> 02:59:37,560
It just hurt the environment.

3218
02:59:41,570 --> 02:59:46,300
You live in La. Where
would you live? And if we,

3219
02:59:46,301 --> 02:59:50,370
we all moved together, where should
we go to questions either. Well,

3220
02:59:50,371 --> 02:59:53,640
it's gotta be somewhere where there's
no state income tax because you're tired

3221
02:59:53,641 --> 02:59:56,820
of this shit. Tired of this bullshit.
But what if you start making more money?

3222
02:59:56,821 --> 02:59:58,950
You don't give a fuck anymore.
But still it's kind of like,

3223
02:59:58,951 --> 03:00:00,380
why am I paying any more
money to the fucking,

3224
03:00:00,390 --> 03:00:04,630
so plenty of homeless people
around. Okay. All right, fine.

3225
03:00:04,920 --> 03:00:08,610
Someone's going to fix the streets too.
Are they? When are they going to start?

3226
03:00:08,780 --> 03:00:11,730
It looks good. That's why a lot of
athletes operate out of Florida.

3227
03:00:11,850 --> 03:00:13,920
I drove here today and it
didn't bother me at all. Yeah,

3228
03:00:13,921 --> 03:00:15,480
you live so close to here.

3229
03:00:16,140 --> 03:00:20,220
I live on the roof live in Florida
because of low income tenants.

3230
03:00:21,240 --> 03:00:23,850
Say operational business out of
this is why Oj is, they're like,

3231
03:00:23,851 --> 03:00:27,660
they can't get you if you owe
money. Florida kick at you. Yeah.

3232
03:00:27,661 --> 03:00:30,240
You can hide in Florida if you
owe money. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

3233
03:00:30,241 --> 03:00:32,430
It's one of them weird ones, so I've
trumped nationals down there. Well,

3234
03:00:32,431 --> 03:00:35,850
I think that's like pensions and shit.
Like they can't take away your pensions.

3235
03:00:36,180 --> 03:00:36,481
Right?

3236
03:00:36,481 --> 03:00:39,120
They probably have some weird like union
restriction law that they can't touch

3237
03:00:39,121 --> 03:00:41,880
your stuff. I think. I don't really, I
don't know if I could live in Florida,

3238
03:00:41,881 --> 03:00:45,120
but yeah, you could. Yeah,
you would just mock it.

3239
03:00:45,480 --> 03:00:49,290
Me and oatmeal and John Travolta and he
lives in a collar one right next door to

3240
03:00:49,291 --> 03:00:54,120
him. He always offer massages and
shit and he'd be like, Nah, I'm good.

3241
03:00:54,160 --> 03:00:57,990
You want to jump on a plane? Fly To dance
together. You and me just fly. Fuck.

3242
03:00:58,050 --> 03:01:00,130
I don't know man.
John Travolta wants to be my friend.

3243
03:01:00,131 --> 03:01:03,070
Do you think he's just wants
to be my friend? He just
said, buddy, he's a good guy.

3244
03:01:03,071 --> 03:01:06,160
He's got a [inaudible]. Oh No,
we have to land in the water.

3245
03:01:06,280 --> 03:01:08,310
We'll have to hold each other
for warmth for awhile. Oh,

3246
03:01:08,320 --> 03:01:10,030
how long for like four days.

3247
03:01:10,031 --> 03:01:13,510
Maybe fall inside you and keep you warm
or from the inside by Dixon your ass.

3248
03:01:13,511 --> 03:01:16,950
They might come rescue me as turns. Very
hot. I know that sounds crazy, but it's a,

3249
03:01:17,030 --> 03:01:20,080
it's a different change of life and death.
Got to put it inside.

3250
03:01:20,110 --> 03:01:22,360
If you put your mouth on my
penis, it, it heals. You'll see.

3251
03:01:22,361 --> 03:01:26,770
It's like over a hundred degree. Blow
me up and then ride me as we float away,

3252
03:01:27,190 --> 03:01:28,330
blowing me up like a balloon.

3253
03:01:31,090 --> 03:01:34,700
His playground scenario or Volta.
I don't know where I would live probably.

3254
03:01:34,870 --> 03:01:37,430
I mean Chicago is an easy answer.
I really want to move back to Chicago.

3255
03:01:38,080 --> 03:01:39,530
I love it.
You don't mind the winters,

3256
03:01:40,610 --> 03:01:43,430
you bond something about the bonding
that happens in the winter in Chicago.

3257
03:01:43,431 --> 03:01:46,220
I believe that too. You have like
a cultural bond with people. Man.

3258
03:01:46,340 --> 03:01:48,560
There's nothing better than going to a
bar in the winter in Chicago and it's

3259
03:01:48,561 --> 03:01:52,130
fucking gross and sad and cold outside
and everyone is having a good time.

3260
03:01:52,220 --> 03:01:54,110
Everyone wants to read
together in these moments.

3261
03:01:54,110 --> 03:01:54,943
It's true,

3262
03:01:55,280 --> 03:01:58,610
but you don't want to live in the south
side where the bullets are going off

3263
03:01:58,611 --> 03:02:02,450
left. And Ryan, I'll let you know
nowhere near this. How do they stop that?

3264
03:02:02,451 --> 03:02:05,600
I was talking to a guy who was a cop
and he was telling me that it's a,

3265
03:02:05,630 --> 03:02:09,020
they arrested certain gang members,

3266
03:02:09,021 --> 03:02:10,520
like certain people that
are running the gangs,

3267
03:02:10,521 --> 03:02:14,180
gang leaders and they created a power
vacuum and then they start fighting.

3268
03:02:14,250 --> 03:02:15,230
Then it got even more chaos.

3269
03:02:15,260 --> 03:02:16,093
It got way worse.

3270
03:02:16,330 --> 03:02:18,800
But at the cops have tried to work
with gangs over the years in a million

3271
03:02:18,801 --> 03:02:22,340
different ways to try to like curb the
violence. They did it here in Los Angeles.

3272
03:02:22,700 --> 03:02:24,560
How'd they do it?
They have these people,

3273
03:02:24,561 --> 03:02:28,550
they have these people that are like these
community organizers who like run the

3274
03:02:28,551 --> 03:02:32,540
neighborhood and they have these like
kind of peace talks with these gang

3275
03:02:32,541 --> 03:02:37,220
leaders to tell them like certain ways
to operate in within the community

3276
03:02:37,221 --> 03:02:39,950
because they're like, your kids live
here, you're with your girlfriends.

3277
03:02:40,460 --> 03:02:45,460
So it it for some reason I think there's
been a lot of weird cultural movements

3278
03:02:45,921 --> 03:02:50,060
in La, uh, that have helped.
Like, you know, Nipsey, uh,

3279
03:02:50,410 --> 03:02:55,410
Nipsey Hussle got shot and I think all
these crips showed up with blood and

3280
03:02:55,461 --> 03:02:56,600
other people came together.

3281
03:02:56,720 --> 03:03:00,530
I think it was this weird coming together
of gangs and this has happened in La a

3282
03:03:00,531 --> 03:03:03,410
few different times or
community organizers kind of
started like peel back these

3283
03:03:03,411 --> 03:03:05,270
walls of like,
we also have to live here.

3284
03:03:05,690 --> 03:03:09,920
I know you want to function
as an organization, but I
think Chicago is reckless.

3285
03:03:09,921 --> 03:03:12,020
I don't think it's,
I think it's less about gangs in Chicago.

3286
03:03:12,021 --> 03:03:17,021
It's more about young people with guns
who want control and I don't think

3287
03:03:17,451 --> 03:03:20,540
they're all parts of gangs. I just think
this is, it's a, it's a violent city.

3288
03:03:20,690 --> 03:03:25,310
It's an angry violence that it's a lot
of, a lot of poverty, a lot of poverty.

3289
03:03:25,760 --> 03:03:27,550
And you live there most of your life.
So what,

3290
03:03:27,560 --> 03:03:29,840
what's the consensus
thinking of how to fix it?

3291
03:03:34,060 --> 03:03:35,940
I don't know, man. I
wish. I wish I had like a,

3292
03:03:35,950 --> 03:03:38,980
I wish I felt like I knew what
would help that kind of stuff.

3293
03:03:38,981 --> 03:03:40,720
But I'm just a fucking white
guy from the north side.

3294
03:03:40,870 --> 03:03:43,090
You know like the majority
of these people are black.

3295
03:03:43,360 --> 03:03:46,480
The majority of the south side is black
and the majority of the violence and the

3296
03:03:46,481 --> 03:03:51,220
crime that happens in that community is
driven around these pockets of the south

3297
03:03:51,221 --> 03:03:54,370
side. I have no relatability.
That's the problem. Right,

3298
03:03:54,371 --> 03:03:57,800
but what did they think is the way to
fix it? Shit, I don't fucking know. Look,

3299
03:03:57,801 --> 03:03:59,090
if you are the king of the world,

3300
03:03:59,091 --> 03:04:02,510
what would you do to fix the crime and
south side for the last thing that we

3301
03:04:02,511 --> 03:04:06,160
talk about on this podcast, I would
do if it was me, if I was trying,

3302
03:04:06,170 --> 03:04:10,930
if I really tried to think world
president puts him, puts him Tino.

3303
03:04:10,970 --> 03:04:13,130
If I could put some more money in
there and get some programs in there,

3304
03:04:13,131 --> 03:04:14,990
start helping people.
I don't know what it is.

3305
03:04:14,991 --> 03:04:17,930
I don't know what the specific thing and
typical liberal you think it's going to

3306
03:04:17,931 --> 03:04:21,380
be fixing and money. These motherfuckers
and they wonder why Trump won.

3307
03:04:21,410 --> 03:04:23,540
Well they always say like
[inaudible] gonna take away the guns.

3308
03:04:24,860 --> 03:04:26,510
Never gonna take away the guns.
It's never going to work.

3309
03:04:26,970 --> 03:04:29,870
You've got to make some kind of
program that helps people function.

3310
03:04:30,440 --> 03:04:33,080
I don't know what it is. I'm not
that smart. I'm not that smart.

3311
03:04:33,470 --> 03:04:35,630
But I do think there's,
I do think there's a way to fix it,

3312
03:04:35,750 --> 03:04:38,780
but I do think there's also a lot of
young kids who would get guns in Chicago

3313
03:04:39,140 --> 03:04:44,050
and they kill people. Uh, it's going
to be a slow process of change forever.

3314
03:04:44,090 --> 03:04:46,560
Obama couldn't do shit.
A lot of them from Chicago,

3315
03:04:46,760 --> 03:04:49,820
a lot of those community organizers in
Chicago were mad at him cause he didn't

3316
03:04:49,821 --> 03:04:52,220
fix anything because people in the black
community where like you promised you

3317
03:04:52,221 --> 03:04:54,740
would fucking help a little
bit. And then it, look,

3318
03:04:54,741 --> 03:04:58,910
this is the first year I think we've had
a dip in murders in Chicago and we're

3319
03:04:58,911 --> 03:04:59,631
coming up on the summer.

3320
03:04:59,631 --> 03:05:04,010
So we'll see the summer's party
telling a few Yvonne bit. We'll see.

3321
03:05:04,070 --> 03:05:06,880
We'll say. We'll say people got guns, man,

3322
03:05:06,950 --> 03:05:09,190
you Santina let's wrap this bitch up.
Bring it home.

3323
03:05:09,191 --> 03:05:12,790

Instagram and on the Twitter.

3324
