1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,340
The joe rogan experience.
That's a guy thing like guys want to see

2
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:08,120
like yoga pants on it's schick.
Like a girl can walk down the street

3
00:00:08,121 --> 00:00:11,750
with yoga pants and a camel toe.
Totally acceptable.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,760
If a guy walked down the street with
fucking ballet tights on and no shirt,

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,430
Jesus Christ is Hugh Jackman.
That's not real.

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,660
Yeah,
no it's not.

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,220
Come on.
That's not real.

8
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:23,480
That guy's face faces.
Photoshop.

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,530
You're so full of shit.
Look at that guy in the left.

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,900
The lighting,
the lighting is totally,

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,630
it's not real.
They're,

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,440
they have their shadows are in the wrong
direction.

13
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:37,340
Hugh Jackman Shadow's coming towards us.
This guy's shadow is going towards his

14
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:41,030
left shoulder on real.
Get the fuck out of here.

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,180
How dare you think that Dude's hgh in?
Uh,

16
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:44,930
probably.
Yeah,

17
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,610
if he's smart.
Shred it out,

18
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:48,020
Bro.
We were,

19
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,930
for whatever reason,
Brian was obsessed with the fact that

20
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:52,070
Hugh Jackman was Kay.

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,730
He wouldn't stop talking about it.
It's fucking hands were moving.

22
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:57,590
He kept puffing on the glass.
Dick.

23
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,000
He was like,
I hear you.

24
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:03,470
Jacqueline's gay.
There's multiple pictures of him holding

25
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:05,570
hands with guys.
Come on,

26
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:07,190
son.
Is Multiple pictures of me with big

27
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:08,510
black dicks in my mouth.
But I did

28
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,950
hold on a second back that up because
one of those look real.

29
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,020
Go ahead.
Go piss you weak bladder at son of a

30
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:17,510
bitch.
Who's the guy with the beard is a

31
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,910
Wolverine Fan.
He's telling them how I'm watching that

32
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:22,670
movie made them cure cancer.
That's what it is.

33
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,720
So Hugh Jackman's guy in the right,
let me see,

34
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:28,930
is he really holding that guy's hand or
is that a perspective that night?

35
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:32,420
Like a perspective thing.
Who cares if he's gay?

36
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,250
But it's a weird thing like a chicken.
Be Gay like a Jodie foster and everyone

37
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:38,360
knows she's gay.
She's out,

38
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,640
it's all good.
And she could play okay.

39
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:42,890
That is super gay.
God,

40
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,900
but sexy Frawley he looks so these look
so big.

41
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,790
But you know,
if a woman like Jodie foster be decides

42
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,490
to come out and you know,
proclaims that she's gay,

43
00:01:58,491 --> 00:01:59,990
that's not real either.
Stop it.

44
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,280
Just stop.
Stop.

45
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:03,590
Now.
It's a woo hoo.

46
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,730
Awesome opinions.
What's this guy doing?

47
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:07,310
It's fucking my kg.
I didn't plan this.

48
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,580
Um,
tell you a funny story and some of your

49
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:14,730
listeners know I had the first Jujitsu
Academy and the eastern seaboard and

50
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:17,010
these guys and a exercise.

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,270
And um,
at one point we had a guy by the name of

52
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:21,991
Jeff,
Tom Watson,

53
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:24,480
who was a Philadelphia Eagle football
player.

54
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,410
This guy was probably about six foot
five to 75 at the time,

55
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:33,060
if I remember correctly.
Unbelievably strong and lean and slim.

56
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,750
He was the darling of the super bowl the
year that the eagles went to the

57
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,430
superbowl in Jacksonville.
He was called up.

58
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,380
He had actually been released from the
team,

59
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:45,880
but they had a couple of injuries and
they called him in and went in there,

60
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,670
caught a couple of touchdown passes.
Wow.

61
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,190
So,
uh,

62
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,023
he,
he's,

63
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,140
he comes to my Jujitsu class and it's
like,

64
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,310
Whoa,
wait a minute.

65
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,860
[inaudible] was designed to protect us
for guys like you,

66
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:56,694
man.
You know,

67
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,130
what do you do with a guy?
I mean just ungodly strong.

68
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,060
Yeah.
He came to my kettlebell class.

69
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:04,810
It's the first time I ever had to break
out like a 48 kilogram kettlebell just

70
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,360
to teach these guys swings cause he was
based kilogram.

71
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,460
What is that about a hundred pounds?
That's a hundred.

72
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,680
I mean he was just like doing front
uprisings,

73
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,320
w you know,
front front raises with his shoulders.

74
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:18,820
He was just so ridiculously strong.
So he gets a go on with one of my brown

75
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,830
butter,
the time a fellow by the name of Ron

76
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,710
Hawkins who lives in Hawaii.
He teaches in the why now.

77
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:27,550
But at that time Ronnie was a brown belt
and ron gets him of course,

78
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:29,740
you know,
and then our block right from the mouth

79
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,860
and the guy literally does a Turkish get
up with Ronnie,

80
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,070
the fcm op.
How much does Ronnie way?

81
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,940
Probably about 148 pounds at the time.
Under 50 and the,

82
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,300
you know,
this guy's like two seven fa.

83
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,110
He literally does a Turkey.
Turkey's got up and just putting rhymes

84
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,800
head through the ceiling.
I remember screaming cause I,

85
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,950
you know,
this guy was like really an important

86
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:48,610
part of our team.

87
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,990
Don't hurt.
Don't break Friday.

88
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:51,820
Don't break rati put him down.
Put him down.

89
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,420
It was insane.
It's just insane.

90
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:57,850
Just how strong some people can be.
I mean,

91
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,450
you mean once you came to America and
what I was trying to get at was like,

92
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,180
what is it?
What's the opinion of America when

93
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:06,850
you're living over in England?
Does it look like when you see people

94
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,740
were invading Afghanistan,
fucking blowing up Iraq and some

95
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,320
missiles into Pakistan from robots that
fly in the sky or sucking up all the oil

96
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,470
all over the world.
Didn't bug us at all.

97
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,170
You're fucking awesome neighbors.
No,

98
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:21,640
I didn't know the craziest fucking
phrase.

99
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,710
A really fucking pissed us off guys.
Serious is when you come into our pubs

100
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,880

You know who is this weekend?

101
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,640
What the Fuck Matt Farah?
We didn't do nothing.

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,560
I don't own a single north face.

103
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,560
I know

104
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,770

105
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:49,280

106
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:49,730
Wait a minute.

107
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,170
Don't be surprised.

108
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,390
I'm always prize when I get beaten up.
Right.

109
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,790
You're getting beaten up so often.
The Not surprised I'd be like,

110
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,481
God damn,

111
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:00,850

You got to talk to people nicer.
Just fucking getting beaten up left and

113
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:06,220

That's not surprising.

114
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,410
You fucking make it some critical
errors,

115
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,820
basically.
Everywhere you go.

116
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,380
I'm a fucking constantly shocked and I'm
beaten up every time it's ever happened

117
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,610
to be like,
what the fuck did I do that led to this?

118
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:21,430
Let's break this all down and never
repeat this problem again.

119
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,691
He's like,

so we had a Kona them for the queen.

121
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,200
Okay.
You can see the wrong colors on

122
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,250
northface inquisition and he was born on
the wrong Patchett.

123
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,880
We signed the Patagonia Charter in 2014
Naco Sandwich coming your way,

124
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:41,570

128
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:01,670
