1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,850
The Joe Rogan experience lie.
Apparently you don't need an ID to fly.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,650
You just need to go.
They were like,

3
00:00:05,651 --> 00:00:07,760
we need to put you through like 20
security tests,

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,880
so come to the airport two hours early.
I was like,

5
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:11,300
God dammit.
They're going to molest year.

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,570
Have you ever had that happen before
where you get like roughly frisked?

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,750
No,
but I have gotten yelled at by a TSA

9
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:22,800
agent because I didn't want to go
through the body scanner and he was

10
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:23,910
like,
what are you a celebrity?

11
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:25,860
He's like,
only celebrities don't want to go

12
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:27,150
through the body scanner.
And I was like,

13
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:27,901
why?
I was like,

14
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:30,170
this is crazy that you're talking to me
like this.

15
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,070
Like what the fuck?
This is nuts.

16
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,420
It's an option,
isn't it?

17
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,081
Yeah.
Yeah.

18
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:37,950
He was just like totally demeaning me.
Like in front of everyone was nuts.

19
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,960
Why would celebrities not want to go
through it?

20
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,570
But it's like,
yeah,

21
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:45,560
why would you want to get molested?
I mean,

22
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,250
well it's.
I've never had it happen to me.

23
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:51,850
Everyone has been pleasant with me,
but Graham Hancock,

24
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,950
who's been on the podcast several times,
she's a good friend.

25
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,330
He went through one and he said this
dude like just was aggressively sexual

26
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:02,420
with him,
like grabbing his,

27
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,350
his body,
like it felt like he was being molested,

28
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,060
like I shouldn't say aggressively
sexual,

29
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:10,690
but he grabbed his cock and the whole
thing mean like he said,

30
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:14,350
it felt like he was getting raped,
like obviously not as extreme,

31
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:16,960
but you know,
it's like a form of a violation and he

32
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:19,060
was really shocked by it and he wrote
about it.

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,340
He was shocked enough that he didn't
just let it go.

34
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:22,350
We sat down and wrote some stuff.

35
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,540
Well,
there was this report that came out that

36
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:29,190
said that there's so many more cases of
malfeasance and misconduct and the Tsa

37
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:32,040
than any other government.
I mean this is like 20 times more.

38
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,930
And so there was this investigation done
to find out,

39
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:37,170
well why is there so much fucking crimes
happening?

40
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:40,650
Like robbery,
sexual abuse and stuff.

41
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:42,900
And it was.
And basically this representative

42
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:45,330
figured out that they don't really do
background checks.

43
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,310
Oh my God.
And they're just kind of skipping

44
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:48,500
through this huge,
uh,

45
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,860
you know,
you think that you would.

46
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,820
So basically they're hiring a pedophiles
and child and lessors what they found

47
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:54,654
out.
Yeah.

48
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,300
No,
wait.

49
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,133
Yes.

50
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,310
Well not nice people too.
We should,

51
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,790
we should say that I've,
I've met a lot of really nice people to

52
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:01,624
Tsa.

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,870
You fucking government chill.
Relax.

54
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,720
Well,
how do you think that you should do

55
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,120
security?
We did before nine slash 11 was totally

56
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:11,030
created in the wake of nine slash 11 is
a total thing.

57
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,570
New Government Agency.
Just like the department,

58
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:15,120
Homeland Security and just,
I mean think about it,

59
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:19,830
the hijackers brought on what knives,
like you can still bring those in.

60
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:24,030
This Guy Jonathan corbet basically
expose the fact that you can just create

61
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:26,490
an insole in pocket and bring in
whatever the fuck you want through these

62
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:29,220
body scanners.
So they really have like a huge security

63
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:30,570
breach.
So.

64
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:32,880
But when you go back to why the body
scanners were implemented,

65
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,490
like an inside pocket that's like silver
or something.

66
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,270
Oh.
So it has to be like,

67
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,320
yeah,
you can carry anything through.

68
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,340
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

69
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,680
But I mean,
the reason that the body scanners were

70
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:45,240
implemented in the first place,
this is Michael.

71
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,470
Michael Chertoff was tied up with rape,
rape,

72
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,330
a scan,
which is also the name of the body

73
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:51,811
scanner,
right?

74
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:53,080
Rapiscan,
rapid,

75
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,730
rapid scan.
But I call

76
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,000
the government was really

77
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,873
like,
Yep,

78
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,620
losing.
I've got a patent rapiscan.

79
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,410
I got a patent,
I'm not changing the fucking name.

80
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,180
And then you understand it 100 percent.
Like you ever the worst feeling in the

81
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:14,280
world.
Strong words you ever go to a concert

82
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,620
like pipe.
My wife me go to fucking.

83
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,130
Oh God son.
That's the ugly one.

84
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,790
And my wife made me go to.
Is always bad.

85
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,240
But then when you say,
I shouldn't say the only thing worse

86
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:31,100
than Dave Matthews is John Meyer,
your wife made you go to a John Mayer,

87
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,770
John Mayer Meyer.
And she was just like,

88
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,310
just enthralled by him.
I could do.

89
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:39,760
John Mayer will know I can do to.
No,

90
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,340
I think he's great.
I think he's very talented.

91
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,010
But if your wife is really into going
know what I'm saying,

92
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:45,840
like she dragged you there and just
stares at him.

93
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,190
And you're like,
I paid for this.

94
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,480
Paid to have your wife close her eyes
later and think about him.

95
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,600
You notice she's not clapping because
when her hand slipped down.

96
00:03:57,601 --> 00:04:01,270
Okay James,
she's deep.

97
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,970
She's clapping with one hand.
It sounds like something stabbing of

98
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:14,971
seal.
It sounds like one of those martial arts

99
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:17,460
movies where they ripped a guy's heart
out after.

100
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,480
She's just fiserv herself.
She's all the way to her elbow.

101
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:26,770
Just gritting their teeth and pounded it
in there.

102
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,850
Get the wedding ring off.
She's just fucking strafing the.

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,700
You can see her rib cage expand.
That's a fist.

104
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:37,701
Goes up there.
Okay,

105
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:46,130
let's go.
Then you realize it's in her asshole.

106
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,520
You thought it was bad?
Fucking shit.

107
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,590
Up to.
What?

108
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,610
Is this the fuck are you doing?
I thought we were going to see a

109
00:04:58,611 --> 00:05:00,890
concert.
Just says licking her arm.

110
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,420
Oh John.
Oh John,

111
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,780
make me eat my shit.
Meanwhile,

112
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:12,730
that's not the craziest person that ever
lived.

113
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,290
Nope.
That's not even close.

114
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:19,291
Nope.
Oh Shit.

115
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:46,740
Itunes or recording to server to get the
fuck outta here.

116
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:47,310
Server.
