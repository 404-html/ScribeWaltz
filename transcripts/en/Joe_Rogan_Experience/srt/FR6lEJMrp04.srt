10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,890
[inaudible]

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,010
Zam brothers and sisters were going
to go on a journey today. All right.

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,550
We're back from the journey
back from Las Vegas. Well, a,

13
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:58,470
I met Anthony Bordain. What am I
here? I got fucking starstruck. I met,

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,560
you know Anthony Bourdain and my
friend Yon Urban is here. Anthony,

15
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,280
do you watch TV at all or you just
fucking read in books all day?

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,130
I haven't had a TV turned on around
me and probably a couple of years.

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,521
Wow.

18
00:01:12,521 --> 00:01:17,410
You completely out of the cultural loop
textbooks on mushrooms from the 15th.

19
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,240
Right. What happened? Uh,
Anthony, what'd you do?

20
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:25,150
Did you change the volume of it
was just turning it down and lunch.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,540
She stopped doing that fucking
Weirdo. Leave that shit alone. Uh,

22
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:33,200
Anthony Bourdain's a chef and he's got
this television show. He was a chef.

23
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:37,940
Now he's pretty much like sort of this
traveling, uh, Guy, uh, who, uh, samples,

24
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:40,040
food and different restaurants
all throughout the world,

25
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,520
but more as like a commentator on the
cultures of these places, you know,

26
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:48,230
and uses food as sort of like a way to
get you to know the culture, you know,

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,070
uses like eating with indigenous people
and he's like tribes and weird fucking

28
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:52,970
crazy places.
I mean,

29
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:56,930
it's a bad ass fucking show
interest and it's my favorite show.

30
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,680
And so I met him and you know,
just of just no one, some just,

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,670
it's the weirdest fucking thing when you
admire someone and you liked their work

32
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,340
and they know who you
are too, you know, and,

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,000
and all of a sudden you're talking about
stuff and he came to my comedy show.

34
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:15,170
I'm like, it seems like it shouldn't
freak me out at this point in my life,

35
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,110
but I'm still like Holy Shit Anthony
Board days in the fucking audience.

36
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,320
Like it was, it was weird, you
know, it was, it was interesting.

37
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,650
He's a bad motherfucker. I uh,
I admire him very much. He's a,

38
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,810
one of the most interesting
guys on television, so he's
going to do the podcast.

39
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,870
He said he gets asked to things on
Twitter one go fuck himself and two

40
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,140
if you would do the Joe Rogan
podcast. So it's his words. Yeah,

41
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,650
he's cool as fuck dude. And his wife
is a, a phene for mixed martial arts.

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,240
His wife takes Jujitsu and Moy Thai and
they have a pattern up upper room in

43
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:51,530
their house and you know,

44
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:55,050
and she's got fucking trainers teach her
how to strangle people and Shit. Wow.

45
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,570
Yeah,
she's a freak dude.

46
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,250
She's like so like aggressively into it.

47
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,690
It was crazy watching like
her like fucking scream and
yell and get all excited

48
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:09,460
at the Wayans and Shit, you know? And he
sort of, it seems like he sort of a, okay,

49
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,660
I don't want, this is what she loves. I
will go along for the ride, but it just,

50
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,140
you know, I don't know if he would be into
it other than that, you know, I don't,

51
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:21,430
I dunno. Maybe I'm wrong. It didn't seem
like he was as into it as she is though.

52
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,090
She seemed really into it.
His wife is like a fucking
super fan. She's like on it.

53
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,060
It's like owning a gun. She's, she's
his gun probably. Yeah. She's shut.

54
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:34,030
Fuck you up dude. She's into it, man.
Yeah. He like tweeted once, you know,

55
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,560
I think her name was Octavia activity
of Bordain choked out or trainer.

56
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,400
Put them to sleep. Wow. He's
tweeting about, that's interesting.

57
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,730
I don't know if I could date a girl
that was more stronger and tougher and

58
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:49,420
crazier than me. You know, I need
to take control of situations.

59
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:52,720
I need to make sure I can do that.
Not like, no, I don't want to watch

60
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,280
whatever gay movie you want
to watch. I mean, sorry,

61
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,700
silly movie that you went to watch a
and then she'll just check me out. Yeah.

62
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,600
Wake up and you know. Well, it would
be more of a struggle than that.

63
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:04,870
I would hope he learns so
defense after awhile, son,

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,240
having tasers protect your neck.
Yeah. I think that's a weird dynamic,

65
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:12,700
man. When the girl can kick your
ass. I don't think I'd be into that.

66
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,250
But you know what? Some people
are, everybody's different man,

67
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,910
and he's obviously not in the physical
fitness and, and he's a wild dude.

68
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:22,010
Won't take some chances. He'll
rod that crazy snake. Yeah.

69
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:22,883
You know what I'm saying?

70
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,880
He'll jump on that IOWASCA
snake and go for a ride.

71
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,030
But he's in the best pussy
eater. You think so? Yeah.

72
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,980
And this is just a champion because
he's so into, I mean that's his job.

73
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:37,360
I'm the best eater in the rural, well,
he's more of a cook than it eats.

74
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,890
Like the best eater would be that man
versus food guy who just eats piles of

75
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,090
shitty food every week or used to
it, doesn't he not eat anymore? Yeah.

76
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,760
That's what a Bert
Kreischer was telling us,

77
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,950
or are we not supposed to say it was
always that, oh wait, I've already,

78
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:49,120
we've already started showing it,

79
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,270
but he doesn't do the stunts
anymore because it's fucking
body was falling apart

80
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,810
because it's poor guys eating,
you know,

81
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,970
20 pounds cheeseburgers every
night while they're filming.

82
00:04:55,971 --> 00:04:57,820
And you know what I mean?
He's,

83
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:01,330
he's ridiculous food challenges where
he would have to eat like, you know,

84
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:05,640
in some insane amounts of
food. Right. Yeah. I mean, I
wouldn't ever really watched,

85
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,830
I saw clips. I wonder if it's that, or if
he's just dating a girl. She's like, well,

86
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:11,760
my guy to getting so fat. And he's
like, you know what I mean? Like, dude,

87
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,620
you can't control that. How could you
possibly eat that much food? Yeah.

88
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,380
It's, yeah, it's terrible for you. But
you know, getting fat is really unhealthy.

89
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:24,400
Yeah. You know, I mean, you've been
fat and you've been skinny, you know,

90
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:28,330
don't you feel way better when
you're skinning? Yeah, yeah,

91
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,240
yeah. But I also like eating,
you know, I was, you know,

92
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,320
I was thinking about that the other
day. I was like, you know what?

93
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,590
When I was in a hardcore diet,

94
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,580
I made sure I only ate certain
kinds of food. You know,

95
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:45,030
like I would only eat like chickens
and and salads and stuff like that.

96
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,840
But then I was like, you know
what? If I wanted to Lasagna,

97
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:51,770
I couldn't have lasagna. You know?
To me it's like, wait a second.

98
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:52,371
You know what I mean?

99
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:56,090
I would rather be somewhere kind of in
the middle where I still eat healthy most

100
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:58,160
of the time,
but I need to fucking bad

101
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,610
once in a while. That was in Vegas.
That is the best fucking food.

102
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,750
Vegas has the best food. Well, you only
have an issue in that. You don't exercise.

103
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,140
If you exercise, you can still waiting
for 24 hour fitness to open up in Burbank.

104
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:13,640
It's just, it's impossible to
work out. You're so unmotivated.

105
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:17,570
All you need is one thing to be wrong.
It takes a radio, doesn't work in my car.

106
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:21,530
I'm not going to drive all the way to
the gym with no radio and they fixed my

107
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:24,860
radio. Then I'll start going to the
gym again. I agree. You will find,

108
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,160
I hate exercise, but if I, if I,
if I do it, I want to do it right.

109
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,670
I want to have a nice gym. It's so much
easier to have a gym at your disposable.

110
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,070
Anthony Bourdain's wife can learn Jujitsu.

111
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:37,820
You girl [inaudible] why don't you learn
something and see just the good thing

112
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:42,320
about it is, you know, what tires you
out? I've known you for what, eight years?

113
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:43,580
Yeah.
At least you know,

114
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:47,390
and you've worked with him
for eight years and you know,

115
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,070
Joe and Eddie were trying to get me
to train in Jujitsu eight years ago,

116
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,830
but I don't hang out with them
everyday. So what the fuck, dude,

117
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,203
you would've done it.

118
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,930
I would've totally done it if I
didn't have an hour and a half,

119
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:03,110
two hour drive every time. But I mean
like what the fuck is your excuse?

120
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,240
My knee is my biggest excuse.

121
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:08,300
We've talked about this already a
thousand times and I have a bad knee and

122
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,090
Jujitsu. It's all about fucking
twisting bones and bodies and you know,

123
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:14,540
and that does not seem like
it's a good idea. Like, Hey,

124
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,460
do I want to have knee problems
for the rest of my life?

125
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:19,190
Do I want to deal with all the fucking
bullshit that's going to come along with

126
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:23,060
doing Jujitsu? Like fucking getting
ringworm and, and all that crap,

127
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,020
or do I want to get a membership
at 24 hour fitness was like,

128
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:31,720
someone literally is a glass half
empty sort of fellow. You know,

129
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,920
there's, there's positive
benefits from these things.

130
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,310
It's not like there's only all these
negatives you're saying? No, no.

131
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:41,630
I'm sure if all these negatives as if
there's nothing for you to be learned

132
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,410
there.

133
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,250
I didn't have a brother growing up and
so like rolling around with a guy's still

134
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:49,720
at this, not worried
about, no, it's just like,

135
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,350
I don't if it was a guy versus girl
Jujitsu, I'm 100% end. I'll fuck,

136
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,880
fuck my knee. Who Cares? You know?

137
00:07:55,881 --> 00:08:00,170
I just don't feel like rolling around on
the floor with a guy. I don't know why.

138
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,510
Same reason if somebody goes,
hey,

139
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:05,360
would you rather hang out with
three guys and watch sports?

140
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,750
Or would you rather hang out with
three girls and watch porn? Yeah,

141
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:12,600
I wouldn't have to say that. It's
sort of a learned thing, you know,

142
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,450
it's like an acquired
taste. Yeah, it does. It's,

143
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,340
I've been doing it for so long,
it's just totally normal to me,

144
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:21,050
but there's times I've thought about it.

145
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,200
There's Times where I'm rolling with a
guy and I know his sweat is in my mouth.

146
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,480
Yeah, no, no. Getting around it.
There's no getting around it.

147
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,550
Like if a guy like say a few are
like you're doing Nogi in, you know,

148
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,660
a guy's on top of you and you've got
them in half guard or something like that

149
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:39,290
and he's sweating. His chess could
easily be on your face. Yeah.

150
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,140
And your bold drenched with
sweat. I, if I had to do it,

151
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,970
I would definitely do geeky with two
comforters are wrapped around near

152
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,400
something. You're exchanging fluids,
you know, you're exchanging your sweat,

153
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,830
your moisture.
I mean they're not really exchanging,

154
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,040
but you're getting it on each other to
have, now it's not going internally,

155
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,220
but it does go into scratch

156
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,420
is the largest organ of the body and
shit does go right through the skin. So

157
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,070
it does. It does. That's why men have
to constantly worried about Matt herpes,

158
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,120
herpes, or real. You have to worry about
that. You have to worry about skin,

159
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:12,990
like ringworm type shit. You have to worry
about staph infections. A lot of guys,

160
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:16,530
it's dirty motherfuckers, man. Most
everybody's different. Like Ari,

161
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:19,530
they only changed their sheets like
once every month and a half, you know?

162
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,870
So He fucking,
he got staff.

163
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,500
That fucking guy would just go to
Jujitsu and then not shower. I was like,

164
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:29,010
why are you crazy? You would just roll
around with dudes and then not shower.

165
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,290
Why don't you just have people
just shit on you? Yeah. You know,

166
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,720
just to have people just piss
all over your body, you know?

167
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:36,890
Like what are you doing when you got to
clean yourself off, man? So what have you,

168
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,390
so you've got staff. There was, yeah,
he didn't even know he had staff.

169
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:42,840
We were playing pool and he's limping
around and I go, what's going on?

170
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,600
I got bit by a spider. Yeah.
Yeah. I did hear about this.

171
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,830
He pulls his pants up to show me the
spider bite. I'm like, dude, that is,

172
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,410
that looks like a staph infection and
you should go to the hospital right now.

173
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:57,520
You get a check. Like you can't just walk
around like that, but he didn't know.

174
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,750
He had no idea that you could actually
get something like that from exercise,

175
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:02,710
from Jujitsu,
you know,

176
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:04,900
you don't really hear about
people getting staph infections,

177
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,730
lessons from surgery, you know? Yeah.

178
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,310
Well most sports you don't get
staff like you're playing tennis,

179
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:10,570
you don't get to staff,
you know?

180
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:15,120
Yeah. Football players can get it. They
get it. Sometimes. It's tricky. It's very,

181
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:18,900
very dangerous. Very dangerous. And you
know, of course there's that, you know,

182
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:23,901
Murcia the a antibiotic resistant
staph infection that they've have now.

183
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:27,420
That's really dangerous because
you know, it's, it's a very,

184
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:29,760
very strong form of it and
it's very hard to kill.

185
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,110
It's from mostly from people not
taking their antibiotics correctly.

186
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,083
Yeah.
And what,

187
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,290
what I've found to one of the best things
to get rid of like a athlete's foot

188
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,050
and shit, which I'm sure you get
an environment like that a lot,

189
00:10:42,051 --> 00:10:43,910
is a apple cider vinegar.

190
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:46,280
He rubbed that stuff on it a
couple of times and it's gone.

191
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,660
They say supposed to pee on your
feet too. Yeah, that works too.

192
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,110
My feet every faster though.
Yeah.

193
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,080
Yeah. Why not move? Why not? Not Bad for
you. It's not bad for you and it's a warm,

194
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,320
yeah, it comes from my own body. I is
it like what doesn't even leave my body?

195
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:00,400
It's one continuous stream.
It's not like it leaves, yeah.

196
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,100
Body at all.
It must have been about what,

197
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:07,080
2004 2005 I was living up in the mountains
and my phone starts ringing and it

198
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:11,550
was like probably one 32 o'clock
in the fucking morning. Right?

199
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,780
And I don't get, or I get
up and I answered the phone
and it's fucking this dude.

200
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,170
It's Joe and he's on the phone. He's
like, dude, I'm sick as fuck man.

201
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:23,850
I gotta be at the studio at like 6:00
AM I feel like shit. What do I do?

202
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,530
And I,
I tell us how it drink.

203
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,150
Drink a couple of glasses of your pis
and it'll make you feel better. Right.

204
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:36,430
Giggling with a finger in your
butt when you told him so.

205
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,650
So anyway, I'm fucking, I got it
back to bed. Right. And then, uh,

206
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,600
it must've been like three, three 30 in
the morning and my phone rings again.

207
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,920
It's fucking Joe.
This time I don't get up to answer it.

208
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,230
I would just fucking lie in bed and I,

209
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:52,470
and I hear the answering machine
pick up and it's Joe. He's a dude.

210
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,710
I gotta tell you man, I just drink
two glasses of my peers, dude.

211
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,390
I feel fucking great. I gotta tell
you man, I'm a peer streaker too.

212
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,510
If when people don't know,
this is very controversial

213
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,173
obviously,

214
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,920
but there's a thing called year in therapy
and the idea behind it is that your

215
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:19,921
body processes waste and that waste
comes out in the form of Shit.

216
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,860
But that also when water waste comes out,

217
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,740
the water that comes out of your body
is actually sterile and that there are

218
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:32,741
some sort of nutrients in it
and antibodies when you're
trying to get over colds

219
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:34,240
and things of that nature.

220
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:38,440
And so a lot of doctors say it's
utter complete total horse shit.

221
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,620
But people in indigenous cultures,
for instance,

222
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:45,940
who've been doing that to try to cure
diseases and illnesses for a long,

223
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:49,950
long time. Obviously modern medicine
is way better than drinking your own

224
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,650
piss. Well, you know what's interesting
though is in, in India, every year,

225
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,700
every couple of years they have a
meeting of doctors who meet up to,

226
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,390
to discuss the latest research
and you're in therapy. Uh,

227
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,400
I knew somebody who went to the doctor
in South America for a skin problem and

228
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:12,620
was told to drink their
urine. Whoa. So I, it is,

229
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,490
it's not, you know, it's, it's very rarest
I think, especially in the United States,

230
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:20,630
but I think in India and China and
certain places in South America,

231
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:21,620
it has been adopted.

232
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,500
He's been adopted by modern
medicine, adopted by freaks. Listen,

233
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,030
I'll try anything, man. I'll try anything.
I've been in zone healers before.

234
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:34,110
I'm like, look, I don't, every instinct
in my body is telling me this is nonsense.

235
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,050
But go ahead. Let me see what's up.
You know, let me see what's up. I just,

236
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,650
I'll listen to you. I listen to you and
maybe even just for material, you know,

237
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,470
maybe even I don't believe it and I just,

238
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,350
just in the interest of this might be
something that would be funny to talk

239
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:49,770
about on stage. I'll let you try
your Voodoo on me. But you know,

240
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,150
it's like nature makes things
look shocking and scary
because they're poisonous

241
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,090
if they want to. If, if, if you
were supposed to drink your pee,

242
00:13:57,091 --> 00:14:01,080
it would taste like fucking stronger.
It doesn't taste bad at all.

243
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,320
Well it actually, it tastes without
what you ate that day. I mean,

244
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:10,060
if you drank a bunch of coffee and
soda pop and ate a bunch of crap food,

245
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,860
it's probably going to
taste pretty fucking bad.

246
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:14,260
But if you eat healthy and take
care of yourself, you know,

247
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:17,290
I've done it a few times as you know,
when I was sick and uh,

248
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,660
and something else that we'll
talk about later when a,

249
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:25,661
I was on mushrooms and you can recycle
your urine and it's supposed to put you

250
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:28,720
through Pluto. Right. And
it doesn't taste bad at all,

251
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:30,900
but it's very much,

252
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,240
dean is like people that
do it for health reasons,

253
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:38,020
they say that it enables them to monitor
their body on a regular basis of what

254
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:42,040
their intake is because they immediately
taste it and it's like, oh shit.

255
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,010
Well I don't want to eat that anymore.
I don't want to do that anymore.

256
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,280
It's like it, it's an
automatic alarm system, right?

257
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,920
Yeah. It doesn't taste bad
bro. It's not that bad.

258
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:55,620
I did it on the radio rather.
And uh,

259
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,420
there was a radio station,
no name show in San Francisco.

260
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,150
What it no anymore is it didn't
name was no name, Huh? Yeah.

261
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,730
Me and no name drank our own
p remember? Oh yeah, he drank,

262
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,700
he drank and he was gagging and I just
threw it down like it was nothing for God

263
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:13,760
was like, I drank my own pissed
like 10 times. Right. You know, I,

264
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,350
I mean I'll do it on a regular basis,

265
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,580
but there was a big thing
about Leo Machida in the UFC
that Leo Machida does it.

266
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,540
And then his father,

267
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:24,110
who was this karate masters
trained him since he was young boy.

268
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,180
He recycles his urine every morning,

269
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,560
every morning and gets up and drinks
his pig. Who the fuck knows man,

270
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,190
it might be bullshit. But if people
have been doing it for that long,

271
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,480
there might be some merit in it.

272
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,510
Yes. I've had people come up to me when
I've given lectures and say that they've

273
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,190
taken it for various, you
know, gout or leg problems and,

274
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,500
and pain problems and after, you
know, four to six, eight weeks there,

275
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,360
their problems cleared up. It's all
over their gout. He's, you know,

276
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,230
they would lay with for a week they
would drink like a, a small amount,

277
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:58,500
like a half a cup every,
every morning fresh, you know,

278
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,830
really. I would, I would try it once,

279
00:16:01,831 --> 00:16:06,240
but I would definitely make sure I ate
a bunch of berries and I would just make

280
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:09,000
it good. How to cook it good.
I'd be a good chef. You know,

281
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,690
I don't recommend coffee before you do it.

282
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:16,550
The first thing you can really start
getting coffee for breakfast this morning.

283
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,240
It's just,
you know,

284
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,080
there was a guy who used to post on the
message board until he got to creepy and

285
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:26,160
someone bandom cause he was just,
uh, I forget what his deal was,

286
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:27,300
but he would,

287
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,810
he would get these girls that like
didn't have any money and they would uh,

288
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,900
take care of them for a little while
and eventually do like a bunch of dirty

289
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:36,270
shit to him like he was into
and write stories about this.

290
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,930
And one of the things he would do is make
as loads tastes disgusting as possible.

291
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,520
So he would talk about the,

292
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:46,510
the asparagus coffee loads
that he would name on it.

293
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,570
I don't remember honestly,

294
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,180
but I remember he made a lot of people
angry because they were like, well,

295
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:54,270
if this guy's telling the truth, he's
a real piece of shit as a human being.

296
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,900
And if he's just trolling like, stop,
stop making up some fucking story.

297
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:04,050
Say it's trolling, but you never know.
Who knows, man. I mean most likely, yeah,

298
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:06,510
most likely trolling. But either
way, it was really good writing.

299
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:10,980
It was compelling. I didn't like him in
his writing. I didn't like who he was,

300
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,840
but it was very compelling and I was like,
this is interesting. It's like this is,

301
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,410
it's obviously very good and very well
written because the idea behind it is

302
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:22,350
kind of gross to me that you would like
go out of your way to take some poor

303
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:25,440
woman who doesn't know what to do with
her life and she's really broke and you

304
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:29,540
forced her into, you know, doing
weird shit for you because you know,

305
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,560
that's how you get off and then
you write about it, you know,

306
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:34,050
like that's like you're victimizing
people and why, why are you doing that?

307
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,820
But not knowing whether or not it
was true or not true. You know,

308
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,430
choosing to look at it from the point
of view. Like maybe it's just fiction.

309
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:44,160
Maybe this guy is just into the mind of
a creep. You know, who knows, who knows?

310
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,260
But it's really well written,
but he was all into just gross loads

311
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,240
is apparently a recipe.

312
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,520
Joe Diaz will tell you how to make
it come out like shotguns. Uh,

313
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,720
I, yeah, I stay at this
horrible hotel. All right.

314
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,870
Last night we were in Vegas and I didn't
know it was a hotel that's next to a

315
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:06,350
strip club that we did a show at.
And uh,

316
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,110
I think that the guy that owns a strip
club owns the hotel and it's one of those

317
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:13,290
boutique hotels where you walk in and
there's nice paintings everywhere.

318
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:17,130
Like every room was a different theme
of painting and I were really cool.

319
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,480
But after six o'clock,

320
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:23,340
it turns into a nightclub that ope that's
open til like 8:00 AM and it's just

321
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,230
the gay,
the gay people,

322
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:29,150
the ravers 6:00 AM 8:00 AM it
goes about NATO, what times?

323
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:33,750
It starts at 6:00 PM 6:00 PM so we, we
got back to the hotel and there was like,

324
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,051
you know,

325
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:37,890
lines of people getting into the hotel
and the red rope and they're like,

326
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:40,020
you have to wait in line. I'm like, no,
we're staying here in, they're like, oh,

327
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,500
go through. We could want in the
whole lobby is a rave. And I'm like,

328
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,120
what the fuck is this place?

329
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:50,130
So we go upstairs and then looking out
the window and it was one of those views

330
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:52,380
where it's like you're just
looking at air conditioning units.

331
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,220
Like it's the roof,

332
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,730
but there's just people that were sneaking
in through like this air conditioning

333
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,810
unit and going up there and doing like
crazy drugs and having sex right outside

334
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:03,060
your window. And then I'm thinking, wow,

335
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:07,140
sneaking in through the air conditioning
unit. What do you mean there was doors,

336
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,490
there was a door going through the floor
and they were climbing out and like all

337
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:15,810
these people are hanging out on the roof
outside of our window. It was fucked up.

338
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:19,500
And then I'm looking at him like these
beds were PR are probably just made for

339
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:22,980
having sex with hookers and the process
in like strippers that are coming from

340
00:19:22,981 --> 00:19:23,814
the Strip club,
you know?

341
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,720
And so there's that red pillow that's
a was on the bed was like one of those

342
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:30,030
fashion pills that you throw on the
ground. You don't really sleep on.

343
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:34,830
There is this come all over it
dude. And then, and then, uh,

344
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,420
the, the, the channels, the TV, cause
we were on shrooms, so we were like,

345
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:43,110
just trying to watch TV and you
can't hear anything except, you know,

346
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:46,440
like whole time turn on the TV
and it was just scrambled porn.

347
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,560
Like you straight on anal sex pops
up on your TV and you're like,

348
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:52,760
what the fuck minute scrambled.
It was a scramble it and it was,

349
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,060
it was channels were porn and then it's
tons of scrambled porn mixed in like

350
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,250
you'd go to a channel,
it's just like what is going on in that?

351
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,550
And then it would be like NBC and
then suddenly scrambled porn channel.

352
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,880
Fucking weird. Then all the lights
just turned off and turned into,

353
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,590
explained that it was porn and then
it would, it would go to NBC. Yeah.

354
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:14,550
Like the channels were mixed up
with porn and then scrambled porn.

355
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,680
So you'd whatever channel you would watch,
porn would just invade the champ. No,

356
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:21,770
no, no, no, no, no. Like, like you turn to
NBC and you turn it to the next channel.

357
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:24,360
It'll be a guy getting his
ass hole licked by a girl.

358
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,370
There's not porn on NBC. No, no,
no, no. Okay. Then there was,

359
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,950
it sounded like you remember scrambled
porn back in the day where it's just a

360
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:33,030
bunch of static.
Yeah.

361
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,270
You go to a hotel room and they would
have like pay per view channels and you

362
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:39,060
could click on it and you wouldn't be
able to see any doors kinds of that.

363
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,870
It was, it was so weird and then
the lights didn't turn on and off.

364
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,480
They turn on and off when you
wanted to and they were like, yeah,

365
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:48,100
this is an eco friendly
hotel where you put your key

366
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,680
in and it controls the air
conditioning and the lights,

367
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,740
which means the air conditioning didn't
work and all the lights were just

368
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:57,520
flashing on and off whenever they
want it to. And then the, the,

369
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:02,380
the pool area, topless ploy area, but
like 90% of the girls where you're like,

370
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:06,580
Holy Shit, I have your chest than her.
Or, I mean she has a Harrier tested me.

371
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:11,920
It was fucking the worst hotel in
the history of hotels, but it was

372
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:15,910
for the time we, the worst hotel you got
out alive. Here's some hotels in Russia,

373
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,050
but stitches where your liver,
he used to be, right? Yeah.

374
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,650
Yeah.
It sounds like the hotel,

375
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,600
it was crazy.

376
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,900
It was one of those hotels where they
like some of the fashion of the room was

377
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:29,900
these like little mirrors that were
placed everywhere on the wall and you're

378
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:33,710
sitting there thinking, I wonder if this
cameras underneath all those mirrors,

379
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:37,130
you know, like it seemed that sketchy.
Like what the fuck is it? Very easily.

380
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,310
Very easily.
If it's owned by that Strip club too.

381
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,740
Yeah. Wow. Ooh.

382
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,870
I remember that one guy, there was a guy
who got caught and he was some really,

383
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:52,290
really famous rich guy. Not A,
not a fit and famous rich guy,

384
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:56,100
but a famous rich guys son. I don't
remember the guy's name. But anyway,

385
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:59,760
they found all these fucking
cameras in his house.

386
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,750
Like this guy had his house like set up
as basically like a little film studio

387
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:08,751
and everything was hidden cameras and
just hundreds of videos of him just with

388
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,380
these drugged up checks,

389
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,380
it would come in stumbling in and
not knowing what the fuck, you know,

390
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:16,590
he put something in there,
drag or something. And then
he was filming all of it.

391
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,880
Do you remember that story?

392
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,870
Yeah, I do. I haven't combined two
stories. How long? I don't know.

393
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:24,620
I remember that though. Like he found
shit, like his phones were all tapped.

394
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,260
There was cameras in everywhere.
Like in his lights and everything.

395
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,870
No, no, no, no. This guy did
it on purpose. He set up his
room, his bedroom like that.

396
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,300
And then they suspected
them of drugging checks.

397
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,060
I was thinking of a story
where a guy found out that he,

398
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,340
his whole house was bugged anything.

399
00:22:38,341 --> 00:22:40,930
So that was the government and
it was from like three years ago.

400
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:41,830
I can't remember.
Who Cares?

401
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,460
Well, there was that Hemingway
thing. It's just came out, you know,

402
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:47,900
Hemingway thought that the government
was following him and it turns out their

403
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,580
war. They were tablets, phones,
they were following him.

404
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:54,490
So he was right and it was
like what they say, you know,

405
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,680
some people say the,

406
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,160
the last straw that drove Hemingway
to commit suicide and that he was a,

407
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,690
people thought he was just paranoid
but in fact the government really was

408
00:23:03,691 --> 00:23:08,400
watching him. Like why the fuck would
you be watching a writer? You know,

409
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:09,121
like what do you know?

410
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,300
The idea I guess is that he was too
close to the communist or something like

411
00:23:12,301 --> 00:23:14,560
that. Cause he was
always in Cuba. You know,

412
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,130
he was just fucking to overthrow
the government or something.

413
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,110
Just being a bad ass being Hemingway.

414
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,870
Yeah. You know, there was so much
intelligence going on on different levels.

415
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:29,871
You had this whole dialectic
between communism and
capitalism on one level being

416
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:32,670
steered by bankers higher up.

417
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:35,980
But all of this stuff,
you know,

418
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,880
that goes into a lot of my current
research right now. In fact,

419
00:23:38,881 --> 00:23:42,810
I've got council on foreign relations
documents sitting right here next to me

420
00:23:42,811 --> 00:23:46,400
from them talking about mushrooms,
stuff like that. You know,

421
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,520
these are the key players in the
council on foreign relations.

422
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,310
People are in a crazy stuff on
so many levels, you know? Yeah.

423
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,100
And you were messing up people's heads
and the CIA messing with people's heads.

424
00:23:58,101 --> 00:23:59,240
Mk Ultra,
they've been,

425
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,260
they've been spying on people and mess
with people forever. Of course. Yeah.

426
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,071
And you,
you would,

427
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:09,071
you would have to think that anyone with
any level of intelligence who is in any

428
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:14,210
position of power would want to know
about chemicals to change people's minds.

429
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,660
He'd want to know about it. You know,
you, you, you wouldn't just ignore it.

430
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,240
You wouldn't just say, oh,
we need to make this illegal.

431
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,960
They would start looking into some things.
There's no way they have,

432
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,340
it would be crazy not to.

433
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,520
Well,
interestingly,

434
00:24:26,521 --> 00:24:31,521
what I've found out recently is that there
was this exclusive club that a lot of

435
00:24:32,191 --> 00:24:37,191
these elitists and bankers and
intelligence people belonged to,

436
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,860
and they would share the information
on psychedelics at the highest levels.

437
00:24:42,901 --> 00:24:43,111
I mean,

438
00:24:43,111 --> 00:24:48,111
pretty much everybody at the highest
levels from the 1940s through the 60s knew

439
00:24:48,631 --> 00:24:53,430
what was going on about psychedelics
on every level before the public did.

440
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,300
And, uh, yeah,

441
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,590
I would think they'd have to,

442
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,820
I don't know how you could be any position
in any position of power and not be

443
00:25:00,821 --> 00:25:04,060
aware of something that powerful.
Something that's, you know,

444
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,810
like the whole movement of the 60s and
whether people want to wrap their head

445
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:11,260
around it or not. That was all
drugs. That whole, you know,

446
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:15,040
that whole acid culture that was coming
out of San Francisco, that whole,

447
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,060
that whole summer of love, that,
that, that generational gap,

448
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:23,680
that huge leap between the 1950s
and 1960s that was all drugs, man.

449
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:24,731
There was all drugs.

450
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:28,600
It was all people smoking pot and people
doing heroin and people, you know,

451
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,820
getting high on mushrooms and acid and
feeling things that they had never felt

452
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:37,690
before and being able to express things
in a way they never felt before and the

453
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:41,530
disenfranchised every fucking
generation filled disenfranchise man.

454
00:25:41,531 --> 00:25:44,140
There's no getting around that.
It's impossible to get around it.

455
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:47,020
Everybody wants to escape from
their fucking parents. Clutches.

456
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,350
Everybody wants to escape from the
designs of a system that's they've been

457
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:51,610
thrust into.
You know,

458
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:54,460
you've been born into this fucking
system that you have to participate in

459
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,760
without you having any say
in it whatsoever. Just boom.

460
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,430
Every fucking single
generation feels like that.

461
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,800
But that generation
got ahold of some shit.

462
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,140
Well, you know, lawsuit. And the
interesting thing, you know, and,

463
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:09,210
and here I've got literally
a stack of stuff right here.

464
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,300
This is all council on foreign. We're
going to go through that in a podcast.

465
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:15,660
Mr Oh, I'm just showing you guys,
we're not going to go through it,

466
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:20,661
but there is some serious stuff right
here that shows how top members of US

467
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,290
intelligence like Allen Dulles,
John Foster, Dulles, uh,

468
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,260
Bank bankers like,
uh,

469
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:31,470
frank [inaudible] and other
guys like Walter Lippmann,

470
00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:33,540
all of these intelligence people as well.

471
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,940
We're at the highest levels
involved in all of the psychedelics.

472
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:43,200
I all idea guys knew it. I have no idea
who any of those people Alan Gomes was.

473
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:47,670
Hold on, let me see if theorists out
there, I'll know who Allen Dulles is.

474
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,920
I have no idea any of those people are.

475
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:55,070
But I do think that if I was like a total
like Internet conspiracy Geek and he

476
00:26:56,611 --> 00:26:58,920
just hit me with all those names in a row,

477
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:03,690
I would have the Uber obscure
named Guy Hard on right now.

478
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,560
Those right now get the fuck out of those.

479
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,590
I was thinking about all those documents.

480
00:27:09,591 --> 00:27:11,530
Don't they haven't like
in pdf form now you can.

481
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,750
You can just have him like I have
all these documents on my phone.

482
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:19,610
Think right here is eight gigs and the
only reasons why it's eight gigs because

483
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:22,800
the 16 gig ones for some reason that
they don't process well with our,

484
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,750
our little MP three recorder.
We don't need your crazy papers.

485
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,760
Your stacks of nonsense.

486
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,360
The problem with that is we don't
believe it and that's the top paper man.

487
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,370
If it's digital,
you can do anything digital shit.

488
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,420
We can do anything to paper ship to the
age of knowing what the fuck anything is

489
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:41,810
is over.
Those days are done man.

490
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,420
You're not going to know what's real
and what's not real anymore. It's just,

491
00:27:44,421 --> 00:27:48,470
it's going to be, it's too tricky. There's
two pictures of Megan Fox getting fun,

492
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,100
have a systematic method of figuring
shit out anymore. That's the big problem.

493
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,241
That is a problem.

494
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:56,430
But the other problem is the ability
to manipulate information, Matt matter.

495
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,050
It's just too, if you have a
systematic method of filtering it,

496
00:28:00,051 --> 00:28:04,850
then you know how to spot bullshit
right away. You know it's, it's, yeah,

497
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:07,900
maybe there is, there is a way
to do it. Actually there's,

498
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,790
there's experience and instincts too.
You know,

499
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,650
there's certain times when
you look at something,

500
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:15,940
Brian's pretty good at spotting a
internet meme sort of bullshit. Right?

501
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,490
Well you got it. You nailed them. I
say you had all the people that I know,

502
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:22,450
you probably have the highest success
rate for nailing Internet meme.

503
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,240
I think I'm pretty good at with
it in life to just meeting people,

504
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,260
judging people.
I'm,

505
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,740
I overthink everything and try to
like play out all these different,

506
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:35,530
same area. If you guys ever
studied logical fallacies,

507
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,620
no.

508
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,290
That gets really good because it shows
you exactly how people lie and then

509
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,350
enables you to name the
exact lie that they're using.

510
00:28:44,351 --> 00:28:46,150
So it gives you explicit knowledge.

511
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:49,340
So like if somebody uses
an ad hominem worker,

512
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,720
an attack on the man right there,
let's say you say something,

513
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:55,090
you make a claim and they
say, oh, well Brian's a fag.

514
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,490
I don't want to listen to anything.
He says, well then you know, oh,

515
00:28:57,491 --> 00:28:58,540
well that's an ad hominem.

516
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:00,880
He didn't deal with the
information that Brian presented.

517
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,670
He attacked Brian instead. There's
all of these network. Exactly. No,

518
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,430
there's all these new macro fallacies.
So you, when you can name them though,

519
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,660
it totally enables you how to,
to know when somebody's lying to you.

520
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,720
And so when you can understand that.

521
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,090
See, now I have like this
energy thing where I think it's,

522
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:22,440
I really think it's mushrooms are soggy
psychedelics that it's kind of enhance

523
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:22,950
this,

524
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:26,850
that I could actually look at people and
kind of hear him talk and look at their

525
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:29,820
eyes and face and not actually study it.
Just an overall,

526
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:32,730
I could feel they're kind of like an
energy almost like I can see if this

527
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:36,280
person's a little dark in places
and kind of like, it's weird.

528
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,860
It's true. There's certain people
that you're not going to feel yes.

529
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,010
It's a sociopath. Yeah. Have you ever

530
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,850
had a sociopath snip a new circle and
you didn't realize he was a sociopath

531
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,970
until like after a while you're like,
Whoa, what the fuck is going? You know,

532
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:52,510
Eddie Bravo and I knew I'd do to kill
the guy. Yeah, I haven't had that,

533
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,940
you know that story. Now what
happened? There was a guy his,

534
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,210
well he would say his name is Rafael Tory,
but that wasn't his real name.

535
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:59,380
His real name was something else.

536
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:03,100
He like invented this name and pretended
he was a Brazilian jujitsu black belt

537
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:07,810
and made his way into the mixed martial
arts community as a total scam artist.

538
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,100
And uh,

539
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:14,100
Eddie had disowned him for lying about
jujitsu cause Eddie found out that he

540
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:17,620
lied about being a black belt.
He wasn't really a black belt at all.

541
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:19,960
So Eddie like stop hanging out with
him cause he's like, this guy's crazy.

542
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,980
He's just making things up.

543
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,800
Like he had rolled them a couple of
times and tapped him out really easy.

544
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,350
But then he thought maybe the guy was
like being respectful and not trying to

545
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:28,620
roll too hard. But then he
realized after a while I go, no,

546
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,970
this guy is terrible cause he's not,
he doesn't know any Jujitsu.

547
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:34,630
He's not black belt. This is
crazy. Anyway, time goes on.

548
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,080
That guy killed a guy and uh,

549
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:41,950
he was dating this guy's wife and Lord,
this guy back to his dojo apparently,

550
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:47,140
and choke the guy to death. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. That's deep shit.

551
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,500
Killed The guy and then was driving
around the dude's car and shit.

552
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,840
So I knew that guy, man.
I hung out with that guy.

553
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:56,480
I hung out with that guy and his wife.
Wow. Yeah. They were over at Eddie's.

554
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,660
And you had no,
no feeling at all,

555
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,330
feeling of danger or any
feeling that he was a bad guy.

556
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:07,470
He seemed like just a friendly dude.
Just, he hadn't killed anybody yet.

557
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,500
I don't think. I mean maybe did
it earlier and got away with it.

558
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,230
I don't think maybe the
posting was so good.

559
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,840
Maybe it was just so good.
He just couldn't help it.
I don't know. I doubt it.

560
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,940
But he was already getting it. I
don't get the killing part. Yeah.

561
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,560
How about you just moved to Florida
together or something crazy.

562
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:30,140
We don't have to fucking kill that guy
man. Go halfsies on Costco memberships.

563
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,440
You don't be crazy.

564
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:36,990
But I think I like to think that I have
the ability to spot bullshit and I think

565
00:31:36,991 --> 00:31:41,660
I'm pretty good at it. But thank God
it troubles me. That got troubles me,

566
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,610
the idea that you know that I ran into
that guy and had no idea that he was

567
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,860
capable of murder because I've met some
other people and if you ask me if they

568
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:49,380
are capable of murder I
would say yeah probably.

569
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,980
This is funny cause like,
you know, Dunkin is,

570
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,770
would you ever think that Dunkin could
be one of those guys that go off and go

571
00:31:55,771 --> 00:31:58,350
crazy murder people?
Duncan can murder somebody.

572
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,710
She was correct because I was looking at,
if I haven't seen could,

573
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:05,670
if you had your life, that danger, if
you saw it, you know, everybody could,

574
00:32:05,671 --> 00:32:08,550
if you were pushed to a position
where you felt like you had to,

575
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,750
I Love Dunkin a death. But, but
he, that the thoughts that he has,

576
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:16,200
and especially when he was in that satanic
mode, I was like, really? Is He? Like,

577
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:19,710
I always wondered, oh, well he's
just experimental. You know,

578
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:22,380
when he was in the Satanism,
he was just being experimental.

579
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:25,860
He wasn't really like, I'm gonna
fucking worships Satan. He was like,

580
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:29,340
I think it's fascinating that everybody
misunderstands this and what it really

581
00:32:29,341 --> 00:32:33,510
is, is there, they're saying they want
to be hedonistic, you know, they want to,

582
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:37,590
you know, indulge and pleasures and
overeat and have sex and sleep till noon.

583
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,980
Like that's like,
that's satanism to

584
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,490
them,

585
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,490
that's like expressing themselves in the
most ridiculous and outrageous and self

586
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:49,370
serving way possible as opposed
to this idea of, you know,

587
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,730
the pious Christian who's trying
to serve the Holy Father. Well,

588
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:55,520
you have his fascination with serial
killers too, which is amazing.

589
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:59,160
He does. Yeah. Yeah. There is
another level to satanism. They,

590
00:32:59,161 --> 00:33:02,520
you should check out to mark pass.
He was work those interested.

591
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,970
He goes into some deep stuff.

592
00:33:03,971 --> 00:33:07,410
He used to be at a priest of
the Church of Satan Dunkin.

593
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:11,580
Like all artists toys with
madness. You know, everybody does.

594
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:15,300
He does it to the most. I that I know.
That's why I would think I agree. I agree.

595
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,860
He, he's, he gets, he
gets deep. He wants, well,

596
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,610
he's very experimental with
his thought process is,

597
00:33:20,611 --> 00:33:24,600
it's one of the reasons why it's comedy
so funny and that uh, you know, his,

598
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,990
just his sense of the world.
This is very unique. I love it.

599
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,370
It's a very fascinating take,
but it's a couple steps away from crazy.

600
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,990
I know. It really is. And it's as it is
mine, you know, I am guilty as charged,

601
00:33:36,991 --> 00:33:40,610
you know, when people say it would be
human, they're like, dude, there's no,

602
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,660
you're never going to get out
of me than I think in any way,

603
00:33:42,661 --> 00:33:44,580
shape or form that I'm some
sort of a perfect person.

604
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:48,290
I'm constantly fucking up left and right,
trying to patch up mistakes,

605
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,630
trying to fucking be on the straight
and narrow all the time. But uh,

606
00:33:51,631 --> 00:33:56,190
I'm crazy too. I know, I know. Given the
right circumstances, the right situation,

607
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,230
I could go fucking completely insane.

608
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:03,360
And I think a lot of artists are in that
same situation. You know, you, you, you,

609
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:06,090
you know, if everything's going smooth in
your life, you don't even know yourself.

610
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:07,200
You don't know what you're capable of.

611
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,890
It's when the shit gets ugly that you
find out what you're really capable of.

612
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,940
You know like Donner Party start type
shit where people freeze and you got to

613
00:34:14,941 --> 00:34:15,774
eat them.

614
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,650
You don't want to start with you first
meet somebody, Bro. I'm getting that ass.

615
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,480
Snap is his ass is mine.

616
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,540
I'll go way over to the dark side up
well over some burning sticks because

617
00:34:27,851 --> 00:34:29,860
there's so much fat in
his meat. He would, yeah,

618
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:32,750
that would be the be delicious pecan.
Yet you might be the best.

619
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:36,790
So you're like a fail. I don't know.
I feel like a Chubby, very hairy.

620
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:39,500
I think it would have a lot of roots.
So it was a pig bro, but a delicious,

621
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:43,210
once you burn that hair off.
Come on son. Come on son.

622
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:44,800
I'm black so don't get crazy.

623
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,610
Oh,
so young.

624
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:51,230
You wrote two books on psychedelics
and their relationship to Christianity.

625
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:54,950
You've got the first one that you wrote
was the farm aquatic inquisition. Well,

626
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:59,160
that was the DVD I did
from Pharma aquatic quick,

627
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,160
the quack in there and I see that, yeah.
Asked for theology and shamanism was,

628
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:05,120
that was the book,
right?

629
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,690
So the Pharma cratic inquisition was what
you were going to call it at one point

630
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:11,330
in time and then you decided to
just do it as a lecture series.

631
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,520
Right. Well, you know, it just
asked her theology in shamanism.

632
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:19,220
Describe more of what the book
is about, which is the, well, we,

633
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,010
we published ancient primary texts
about ancient son and star worship and

634
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:23,761
Christianity.

635
00:35:23,761 --> 00:35:28,761
And we've also published a more recently
ancient primary texts on Christian's

636
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,580
using mushrooms as well, which is
what, uh, my second book is about.

637
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:33,990
And that's the holy month.

638
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:37,020
That's the holy mushroom evidence
of mushrooms in Judeo Christianity.

639
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,470
But in that book, I published
the first ancient, uh,

640
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,120
primary texts of mushroom
use by Christians.

641
00:35:45,121 --> 00:35:48,360
And it was a document called the
epistle to the renegade bishops,

642
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:53,040
which is a Canaanite text
for the, uh, Orthodox church.

643
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,760
You know what I love about yawn
before you go any further? I met,

644
00:35:56,761 --> 00:36:00,510
I met Jaan years ago. I mean, how long ago
have I known you? At least eight years.

645
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:02,910
At least eight years.
And when I met Jaan years ago,

646
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,900
he was just this really cool guy. I met
you over a Jack Harris House, right?

647
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,070
We got to Jackson.
Yeah,

648
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:11,630
we went to Jack Harris House and yon
was just this really cool guy who was a

649
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,660
very smart and had a lot of information.
But there's a lot of those guys,

650
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,130
you know,
and they'll tell you things,

651
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:20,310
they'll tell you stuff about this and
did you know that the 15th president,

652
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,440
Blah Blah Blah. And then you
know the fascinating to talk to,

653
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,300
but you actually wrote fucking books.
You know what I'm saying?

654
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,790
Like my man wrote some real ass books,
you know,

655
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:32,360
with like references and you know,

656
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,750
banner photos got a glossary in this
bitch. You know, there's photographs,

657
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:41,190
the color photos are fucking awesome
because it's like at a certain point in

658
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:43,470
time it becomes undeniable.
And that shirt,

659
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:47,700
the shirt that you have on that is
a cardinal. Anybody can see that.

660
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,350
It shows the color cardinal
and how the cardinals, well,

661
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,880
you know the, the ancient Catholic Church
period, the ancient Christianity was,

662
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,500
they were obsessed with that mushroom.

663
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,660
Either miscarry a mushroom or you
got it over there. Hold up the,

664
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,660
hold up the front cover
of the holy mushroom book.

665
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:09,000
It's hard to see because this is
a really old painting and it's uh,

666
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,510
when you're,
when you're looking at it,

667
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,330
let me, let me tell him
what it is though. On the,

668
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:13,890
on the right side of the window there,

669
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:18,891
up above his baby Jesus riding on the
back of Saint Christopher and baby Jesus

670
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,500
is in the shape of a mushroom.
And we've even had a,

671
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:27,180
a professor of my Qology identify the
exact type of mushroom that Jesus is

672
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:28,170
depicted as there.

673
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,790
And that's from a month Ferran de
Perigord France from the 13th century,

674
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:33,660
from a chapel there.

675
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,000
And there's a lot of mushrooms
on this fucking wall.

676
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:38,370
So most artists are drug addicts.

677
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:41,460
So wouldn't you think back then that
artist they did. It was just like, man,

678
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:44,340
I'd like to get some mushrooms
and I got hired to do this. Church

679
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,520
is with the mushroom.
Let you know if you think about it,

680
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,050
he probably got a lot of trouble
for that. Right. That's got stoned.

681
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,920
They ain't got,
a lot of people are probably like,

682
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,510
what the fuck Christian Jews and
mushrooms. What's that about? You know,

683
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,650
imagine if this whole Christian mushroom
connection was really just a bunch of

684
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:09,240
taggers. I seriously, I just
jokesters who were already as well.

685
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,580
We actually do have several
primary texts about it. In fact,

686
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,750
there's one text found in the Jewish
Kabbalah and the book is Zahar.

687
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,950
This specifically discusses the mushroom,

688
00:38:17,951 --> 00:38:22,930
the red mushroom or the red fungus
actually. And uh, like I said,

689
00:38:22,931 --> 00:38:25,450
the Christian texts, the epistle,
the ring renegade bishops,

690
00:38:25,451 --> 00:38:28,620
there's a Muslim texts
from, from this, uh,

691
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:33,400
from the seventh century that discusses
Manna being a type of mushroom.

692
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,070
And Mana was, uh, referred to in

693
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,700
other texts as well, and Soma and
was referred to in the Hindu text.

694
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:43,210
And that was also thought to be
possibly related to her. Right, right.

695
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:46,930
And that there is an argument right
now going on between academics.

696
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:51,610
If the Mana that where it says that
it's a mushroom in this Muslim mish cat

697
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:52,444
text,

698
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:57,100
if it's talking about a truffle or a
psychedelic mushroom and the word there

699
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:57,861
that they use it,
you know,

700
00:38:57,861 --> 00:39:00,460
it describes the word site
and the word site that they,

701
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:06,110
that is written in the original text
can be spiritual or visual site.

702
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:06,790
So they're,

703
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,330
the debate is whether or not this
truffle is a mushroom mushroom or a or a

704
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:14,800
truffle type mushrooms. So,
you know, but uh, either way,

705
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,850
Matt Maana, Manna appears to have
been a type of mushroom, but you know,

706
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:22,120
I have to give John Market
will they grow credit?

707
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,090
I am the publisher of the 40th
anniversary edition of his book.

708
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:30,091
And this book here was actually
a really famous book and the uh,

709
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,630
we've taught a 1970. Yeah, we've talked
about this many times on the show.

710
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,610
I republish that a little book.

711
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:41,010
Well this is the new version that you guys
published. Yeah, I republished it. Yeah.

712
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,060
I work with Gianna lagers, family and
two copies of the old original one. Yeah,

713
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,013
I've got a couple.

714
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,280
I bonded to buy them because I knew
they were out of print and there were so

715
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,480
it's so great. It was, uh,

716
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:57,030
the new version has a 35 page addendum
by Professor Carl Rock from Boston

717
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,550
University who has come out publicly
endorsing the lagers work, you know,

718
00:40:00,551 --> 00:40:01,480
and then plus,
like I said,

719
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:05,230
my back's it though any further
because there's a lot of people who are

720
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:07,080
uninitiated. All right. Ma.

721
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,100
John Marco Allegro law worked for the
people that were deciphered the dead.

722
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,100
So he was one of the original eight
members of the Dead Sea Scrolls team to

723
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:18,820
translate the Dead Sea Scrolls. They,
they contacted Oxford University.

724
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:23,670
He was studying for the, his
doctorate in philology there, uh, in,

725
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:28,390
uh, Asiatic languages, which
the, that part of the Middle
East is considered Asia.

726
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,430
And uh, so he, that somebody,

727
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,490
somebody contacted the university
and asked them to send their best.

728
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:41,491
So they recommended John Allegro ago and
so he worked to translate the Dead Sea

729
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:44,740
scrolls from 1953 until 1968.

730
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,610
He was actually the only member of the
tribe of the Dead Sea scrolls scrolls

731
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:53,611
team to ever release any information
about the Dead Sea scrolls to the public

732
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:54,934
during the,
uh,

733
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,200
that period from like 1953 until 1991.

734
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,970
And, uh, so he,

735
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:06,180
the other members of the team sat on
their information for years and after a

736
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:11,500
huge blow up the Huntington
Library and about 1990 91,

737
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:14,140
which is over by Pasadena,
uh,

738
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:18,310
they finally released all
of their photographs and
their possession of the Dead

739
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:18,311
Sea Scrolls,

740
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:22,210
which finally allowed other scholars to
get their hands on them and translate

741
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:24,490
them. But John Allegro,
up until that point,

742
00:41:24,491 --> 00:41:27,520
was the only one that was fighting
against the rest of the team to put

743
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,620
information out. And of
course, they attacked him.

744
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:32,020
If you've got a dead sea
scrolls displays today,

745
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:36,320
they almost completely omit them from any
mention of a, of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

746
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:39,050
But he was really the key player
to get it out to the public.

747
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,910
And so in, um, well what
happened was in the,

748
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:46,040
in the 1950s, Pr, uh,

749
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,390
professor John Rams bottom from the
London Botanical Museum published a book

750
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,530
suggesting that and Adam and eve and the,
and the,

751
00:41:53,531 --> 00:41:58,531
and the tree of knowledge was a mushroom
and he showed a fresco from France,

752
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:02,740
from, it's called the Plain Crow
Fresco. That's how can people find,

753
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,140
what is it called? The Plain Crow Fresco
and spell that's in the book there.

754
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:10,690
Image number here because it's a
fascinating image. Let me see that. Uh,

755
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,540
just hold up the back of the book.
They're actually,

756
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,100
the problem is that most people are
not going to see this. This is wrong.

757
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,110
Most people are going to get this on
Sirius satellite radio or on iTunes. Yeah,

758
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:25,120
but it's p l a I.

759
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,220
N c O. U. R. A. U. L. T. Say
that again brother. I was
talking over you. I'm sorry.

760
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,080
P L A I. N C. O. U. R. A. U. L. T.

761
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,640
And let me check that again.

762
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,690
The painting is amazing if you
haven't seen it before. And again,

763
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,110
Brian could be right, it could be some
crazy artist who's really into mushrooms.

764
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,290
Well that's what most artists are into.
You know,

765
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,120
we'll take it out like
that's why they're painting.

766
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:49,300
I've never heard that point before.
It's very, it's a very good point.

767
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,160
I know every artist and every
author like to do drugs there.

768
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,680
They're taking these scrolls or Deaton.

769
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,290
These guys probably did a lot drugs and
they were throwing mushrooms in also

770
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,110
like that. You were talking
about that maze or whatever.

771
00:42:59,111 --> 00:43:01,390
It's called the maze mushroom early.
Earlier.

772
00:43:01,391 --> 00:43:03,400
What was the mice from that
you're calling earlier? Uh,

773
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,770
you said it was from the old
Hebrew text when you translate it.

774
00:43:05,771 --> 00:43:09,940
They said they called mom. Yeah. Yeah.
So maybe the author of, you know,

775
00:43:09,941 --> 00:43:12,400
cause of that was on my
shoulders to the camera.

776
00:43:12,401 --> 00:43:15,490
Throw some mushrooms in here
cause I like to eat mushrooms too.

777
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:19,350
Throwing it
in my holy mushroom book,

778
00:43:19,351 --> 00:43:24,351
I published 43 images are paintings
that that go from Russia to England,

779
00:43:25,711 --> 00:43:29,010
and it shows a pretty
widespread use from the early

780
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:35,660
first millennium all the way through
the 1890 [inaudible] or late 1800

781
00:43:36,721 --> 00:43:36,790
[inaudible].

782
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:40,450
So as of God hired someone to write
the Bible, and as they do is write me,

783
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,950
just draw some mushroom. She's like, yeah,

784
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,960
of course he's going to tag
the Bible if God, God Pagan,

785
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:50,350
gods busy, he has other things except for
looking through deciphering mushrooms.

786
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:53,820
Back to this John Mark old allegro thing.
So John Mark Fro Allegro,

787
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,540
working in the Dead Sea
Scrolls for 1415 years. He,

788
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:01,450
he comes to the conclusion with this
book that you are republishing the Sacred

789
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:04,760
Mushroom, the cross, right? And if you
allow me, if, tell me if it's correct,

790
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,880
his conclusion is that all of Christianity
is a gigantic misunderstanding of

791
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:11,094
what it really,

792
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,410
what it really is about is the
fertility calls and the consumption of

793
00:44:15,411 --> 00:44:18,470
psychedelic mushroom, right?
And that's the whole religion.

794
00:44:18,471 --> 00:44:21,830
He argues that Jesus himself
was an anthropomorphism,

795
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:25,700
are a metaphor for the mushroom,
for the entheogenic experience itself,

796
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:30,530
not a physical person. And
in fact, uh, theologists and,

797
00:44:30,531 --> 00:44:31,364
uh,

798
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:36,690
religious experts still today are a
debate constantly whether or not Jesus and

799
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:39,330
these characters were a historical,
uh,

800
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:44,310
there's a lot of evidence to suggest that
they are in fact myths just like Zeus

801
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:47,190
or any of the Greek gods or, or, you know,

802
00:44:47,191 --> 00:44:52,170
any of the Hindu gods or any
other gods. Um, so, but you know,

803
00:44:52,171 --> 00:44:55,050
when you live in your own religion
and you have your own beliefs,

804
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:58,500
you tend to take them on as
real historical characters.

805
00:44:58,501 --> 00:45:01,920
But as I showed him my first book
asked with theology in Shamanism,

806
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:06,921
when you compare all of these different
religions that hold beliefs like a sun,

807
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:10,230
worship and moon worship in these
things as well as psychedelics,

808
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:11,850
and they all start to tie together,

809
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,830
when you look at their similarities
through a fertility rituals,

810
00:45:16,831 --> 00:45:20,880
through psychedelic use and through Sun
and star and moon worship. You know,

811
00:45:20,881 --> 00:45:24,730
like I said earlier, I published
a, a fourth century, uh,

812
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:30,060
texts from father epiphanies where he's
sitting there talking about how, uh,

813
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,900
the birth of Jesus coincides exactly
with the birth of the sun and everything.

814
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:36,660
And then he says,
but all of those other pagan religions,

815
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:38,610
they're not the real one.
We're the real one.

816
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:42,550
And his text was actually censored for
a thousand years by the church until

817
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:47,610
another, uh, older copy of it was
later found and published in the 1850s.

818
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:52,140
So they, you know, the church literally
tried to suppress one of their own guys,

819
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:53,700
text talking about this stuff.

820
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,360
Well,
I would assume that if you,

821
00:45:56,361 --> 00:46:00,800
if you look at all this religious artwork
that has all these mushrooms symbols

822
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:03,820
in them, and we're talking about
doorway openings, right, like the,

823
00:46:03,821 --> 00:46:07,580
the shape of doorway openings and Jack
Herer when he was about to write the

824
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:11,430
Sriracha, open up Astra theology and
shamanism and show him some of the door

825
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,490
to just audio because like I said,
the majority,

826
00:46:16,491 --> 00:46:19,540
the vast majority of the people that
get this podcast get adjusted. Yeah,

827
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:23,660
that's right. All right. But,
um, anyway, what my point was,

828
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:28,490
do you think that how it went down
was that all of this knowledge and

829
00:46:28,491 --> 00:46:33,491
information about psychedelics
was kept from the common person?

830
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:37,980
Was it like only with the
powers of the church? Was it? It

831
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,410
was, it was kept with, it
was kept for the elite.

832
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,280
Those who basically have the knowledge
of the trivium and quadrivium or had

833
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:46,980
studied the seven liberal arts,
they were considered better than the,

834
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:51,720
than the masses or the dead as they're
also known are the profane. Right.

835
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,490
And so the elites in the educated
withhold this information for themselves,

836
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,090
the trivium and quadrivium, the
psychedelics, the history of philosophy.

837
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:00,960
There's actually,

838
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:04,230
there's also that a lot of people don't
know about is there was this ancient

839
00:47:04,231 --> 00:47:06,780
conversation.
It's 2,500 years old.

840
00:47:06,781 --> 00:47:11,130
It's still going on and it's called a,
it was called the great conversation,

841
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:15,090
but it's found in a series of books called
the great books of the Western World

842
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,320
and, uh, leading thinkers
and leading experts.

843
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:22,950
Every generation add on to
this great conversation.

844
00:47:22,951 --> 00:47:26,340
And it's still going on today. It goes
all the way from Socrates to today.

845
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,810
And a right now it's like 54 or
59 volumes or something like that.

846
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:33,640
It's like a tenure undertaking.

847
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:38,500
But any real expert in the
ancient knowledge or in
philosophy or anything like

848
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:42,970
that is studied this, this great
conversation or has participated in it.

849
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:46,660
And so there's all of these
different levels of knowledge.

850
00:47:46,661 --> 00:47:50,470
The trivium and quadrivium
is the foundation to the
great books of the Western

851
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:55,000
world. So you have to have
a firm understanding of of
this information like the,

852
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:57,370
and all of this is related
to the religions as well.

853
00:47:57,371 --> 00:48:00,280
But just to give a very quick synopsis,

854
00:48:00,281 --> 00:48:03,220
the trivium specifically
in this order is grammar,

855
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:08,221
logic and rhetoric and that teaches
you how to think and how to learn,

856
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,620
not what to think. And then the
quadrivium is math, geometry,

857
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:15,830
music and astronomy specifically
in that order. Math is number in,

858
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:21,100
uh, math is number, math,
geometry is number in space.

859
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:25,210
Music has number in time. And astronomy
is number and music and time. And then,

860
00:48:25,211 --> 00:48:29,620
so when you have this foundation is number
and music and number number in space

861
00:48:29,621 --> 00:48:33,880
and time. Music is number
and time. Astronomy is number
in space and time. Okay,

862
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:39,430
sorry about that. So if this
motherfucker, I need a calculator,

863
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:43,090
but what they, what they do is,
you know, up until the 1850s,

864
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:46,360
everybody in their schooling was
taught the trivium and quadrivium.

865
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:50,890
So then if you wanted to go on to this
higher level of education in the great

866
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:52,720
books of the Western world,
you could participate.

867
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,630
But all of the old grade thinkers were,
were in on it basically.

868
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:58,630
So all the old great thinkers
were in on mushrooms. But no,

869
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:01,870
well not necessarily in on the mushrooms.
They were in on the great conversation.

870
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:03,380
But there are aspects and you know,

871
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:06,820
in my research and in some of these
documents here through some of the clubs,

872
00:49:06,821 --> 00:49:11,350
it's very clear that that,
uh, many members of the elite,

873
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:15,610
like let's say the owner of time
life magazine, the head of the CIA,

874
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:19,630
uh, rich finance, here's
like Oppenheimer or,

875
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:24,190
or Walter Lippmann or, or,
uh, uh, uh, frank asphalt,

876
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,830
these guys geek boner right now.
Right?

877
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:31,000
All of these guys were in on this top
knowledge and they were sharing this

878
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,250
information at the top levels.
I can actually,

879
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,280
you know I have documentation that
actually these are from university life,

880
00:49:39,131 --> 00:49:42,610
from the CFR archives at at Princeton
University and things like that.

881
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:46,690
So I can show you from their
own archives and their archives.

882
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:49,040
They talk about mushrooms,
they talk about psychedelic drugs.

883
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,230
The key players involved,
like especially Gordon Wasson,

884
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:58,120
the Gordon Wasson was involved in all
levels of US intelligence and he is the

885
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:03,121
guy who in 1957 brought out the story
about magic mushrooms and light and

886
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,450
magazine magazine. Bright
and very famous art. Right.

887
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:12,510
So really sending Gordon Wasson was
a chairman for the council on Foreign

888
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:17,170
Relations, right? Henry Luce at time
life magazine. He was and bones,

889
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:20,150
but he was also working with,
with Gordon Wasson ads.

890
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,430
This is what I want to see a our,

891
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:24,850
this is what I wanted to avoid because
this is whenever I talked to Yon,

892
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:28,040
he has to go so deep
what all this shit and

893
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,010
I'm sure it's all real. Well
I'm sure it's all real. I'm,

894
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:31,910
I shouldn't say conspiracy.
He conspired,

895
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:35,480
they conspired to do something and do
they have the documents that show that?

896
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:39,860
That's not interesting to me.
What's interesting to me is how this all,

897
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:44,660
what about those audiences might be
too far?

898
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:47,300
You go too far and you go too
far down to this guy, that guy,

899
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:49,860
I got to take notes on names.
I don't know. Honestly,

900
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,820
to me it's like you start saying all
these names and stuff and I'm still

901
00:50:52,821 --> 00:50:54,920
confused because I don't know any
of the treatments or take it from an

902
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:57,410
entertainer who knows his audience and
he dropped me a wrong way to go with this

903
00:50:57,411 --> 00:51:00,080
subject. Draw me a picture because
it's a fascinating subject.

904
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:03,830
The idea that all religions experiences
come from psychedelic experiences.

905
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,760
It totally, completely makes sense. The
connection between this Ama miscarry,

906
00:51:07,761 --> 00:51:10,550
a mushroom, the relationship
that it has to Christmas trees,

907
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:14,450
you know that it has a Michael
Riser relationship with
the Christmas tree and it

908
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:17,090
grows under him, you know, and
that all of these things, these,

909
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,470
this is no one knows about this.

910
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:23,380
This is all for some reason
has been kept out of uh,

911
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:27,000
public school systems kept out of
universities. No, nobody's talking about,

912
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:27,530
it's all about it.

913
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:32,530
It's all being kept from
the public education system
isn't designed to make you

914
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:36,280
intelligent for your mind. It's designed
to make you a good soldier of fact.

915
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:38,180
Right. But, okay. But forget about that.

916
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:41,420
Is there a single course in any accredited
university anywhere in the world

917
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:44,260
where they go into depth about
the history of psychedelic use?

918
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:48,370
I would say yes. There are a few and
you know, and anthropology especially,

919
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:53,110
but a professor Tom Roberts
at the University of Illinois
has been teaching the

920
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:57,160
oldest running psychedelics course since
the 1980s and what does he talk about?

921
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:00,610
He makes me about psychedelic
research or as well, yeah.

922
00:52:00,611 --> 00:52:03,930
He's also a major archiver of psychedelic
information and things like that.

923
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:07,550
So go into depth about like the history
of its use. Like John Mako, allegro. Yeah.

924
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,330
And people are allowed to, you
know, study, you know with the,

925
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,360
he allows his people in his class
to choose a book and the whole,

926
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:15,971
you know,

927
00:52:15,971 --> 00:52:20,230
there's like four or 500 books on
psychedelic studies on from all different

928
00:52:20,231 --> 00:52:23,380
directions out there and he lets
them go out and research these and,

929
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:26,410
and write reports on them.
And things like that as part of the class.

930
00:52:26,411 --> 00:52:27,221
So That's interesting.

931
00:52:27,221 --> 00:52:31,660
I wonder how if he gets talked to by
anybody in any point in time, you know,

932
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:34,960
and they have to make sure that he doesn't
encourage the use of these and that

933
00:52:34,961 --> 00:52:37,930
it has to go through now as
I'm sure that they make it.

934
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,390
What do you think obvious,
but, uh, you know,

935
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:45,190
I interviewed him on my podcast for those
who don't know gnostic media.com but

936
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,480
gnostic is g n o s t I c media.com.

937
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,950
But,
uh,

938
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:55,300
he was very open about his
own psychedelic use on my show

939
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:57,740
really well is, you know, I've,

940
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:02,741
I've interviewed more than 60 doctors
and professors and leading experts in,

941
00:53:03,461 --> 00:53:07,120
in psychedelic studies on
my show from Stan Grof,

942
00:53:07,121 --> 00:53:10,870
who's one of the leading x or the leading
expert on Lsd and a bunch of other

943
00:53:10,871 --> 00:53:14,620
people. And they're very straight
forward about their own personal use.

944
00:53:14,621 --> 00:53:19,390
I think there's been one doctor that I've
had on Deborah Mash at the University

945
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:22,750
of Miami who said she's never tried
the drugs that she researches. Hmm.

946
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,010
That's interesting. Um, Strassman's

947
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,680
Kinda, he, he doesn't really
talk about it that much. Josie,

948
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,320
not too much. But, uh, you know,

949
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:34,050
he and I have talked about it a
little bit on the side before,

950
00:53:34,051 --> 00:53:36,390
but he's not too public about anything.

951
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:40,370
Well, his, if you don't know Strassman
as the guy who wrote the book, Dmt,

952
00:53:40,371 --> 00:53:44,760
the spirit molecule, which is an amazing
book. One of the more recent, uh,

953
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,350
probably the most recent study of,
of a,

954
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:52,840
of psychedelic drugs that was a approved
by the federal government. And He, uh,

955
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:53,800
he's shot these people up,

956
00:53:53,801 --> 00:53:57,710
but DMT and they had these fucking
incredible visions and incredible stories,

957
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:01,940
like really intense book and a very,
very fascinating,

958
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,320
but he didn't talk about it too much,

959
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:07,100
but he did tell me about these crazy
people that have a loophole in New Mexico

960
00:54:07,101 --> 00:54:08,210
and they just got away with doing this.

961
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:11,900
Apparently they just one
during the supreme, uh, with,
uh, with the Supreme Court.

962
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,370
You know,
the people I'm talking about,

963
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:16,840
the church that they drink
that a wasp wasp, it's not,

964
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:20,780
they call it Hawaii Oscar though you know
it, but it is a DMT and orally active.

965
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:24,920
Right. Well, you know, Paska Iowasca
there's a few different names for it,

966
00:54:24,921 --> 00:54:29,280
but there, same thing, same thing.
Would you recommend [inaudible] was it,

967
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,350
I think that's the name of it.
And they wear,

968
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:36,580
they wear uniforms and they all take
like super powerful IOWASCA and then sing

969
00:54:36,711 --> 00:54:38,090
songs about Jesus.

970
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,290
Right? Yeah. The Santo Daime a church,

971
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:44,520
they won the rights to practice
up in Oregon about two years ago.

972
00:54:44,521 --> 00:54:48,780
And the Uno de Vegetal is another Iowasca
church that operates in the United

973
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,910
States and they've had approval
for about five or 10 years.

974
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:54,030
How incredible is that? Right? It's like
you have the native American church,

975
00:54:54,031 --> 00:54:56,340
you have the native American church.

976
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:59,490
The Oakland way on native
American church is the only one,

977
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,570
only native American church that
allows non natives to practice and they

978
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,810
practice payoti mushrooms. They pretty
much did the whole thing there. Yeah.

979
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,020
And non natives are allowed, non
natives are allowed in the open of way.

980
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:14,220
How branch and that's run by uh,
James Warren,

981
00:55:14,221 --> 00:55:18,750
flaming eagle. Mooney Flying
Eagle, sir. Yeah. Out there.

982
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:24,270
Let's make something happen.
I'm talking about like a yearly thing.

983
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:28,240
Holla at your boy. We could
do at legal legal, right.

984
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:33,360
Payoti the desert. You know, and when
you think about it, almost all religions,

985
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:35,550
if you go back far enough,
they were using psychedelics.

986
00:55:35,551 --> 00:55:40,050
It wasn't just the native Americans of
the South Americans use Iowasca or you

987
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:43,950
know, it wasn't just the brown cultures,
it was the white culture is to, you know,

988
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,900
and in genesis,

989
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:50,460
Rachel and Leah are arguing over who
gets the mandrakes to have sex with a

990
00:55:50,461 --> 00:55:54,530
Rachel's husband. Right? So
this is Greek. Mandrake is a, a,

991
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:58,430
is a psychedelic as well as an
aphrodisiac. It's a, in the school, Paul,

992
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:02,940
I mean family with the GSS, 10 found new
drug. Right. You know, and the, in the,

993
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:05,790
in the song of Solomon's it,
in the Song of Solomon,

994
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,500
it discusses mandrake
there as well. And, uh,

995
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:13,740
there's been a number of people,
myself, Jack Hair, that we both knew,

996
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:14,940
Andy Clark,

997
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:19,940
Heinrich of all argued that the entire
story in Song of Solomon is actually a,

998
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,160
a basically a psychedelic
story if you'd look at it.

999
00:56:24,161 --> 00:56:29,161
And if the characters are put in context
of drugs and red mushrooms with white

1000
00:56:29,621 --> 00:56:31,750
spots and things,
suddenly the story makes a lot more sense.

1001
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,240
Here's an example,
and it is on the same subject though.

1002
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:36,700
It doesn't feel that it would be of,
uh,

1003
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,910
you know how we were talking earlier about
being able to feel if someone's weird

1004
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,110
feeling someone's crazy.

1005
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:44,670
The first time I was introduced to the
subject was the first time I met Yawn,

1006
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:49,690
Yawn over Jack Harris Place and Jack
Hara was showing me all these photos,

1007
00:56:49,691 --> 00:56:52,210
which I hope are still around.
I hope somebody got those.

1008
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,370
He had these incredible photos of artwork.

1009
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,730
We're showed naked people on the
block and all and stuff like that.

1010
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,990
They were under a mushroom.

1011
00:56:58,991 --> 00:57:01,690
They had like a transparent mushroom
and they were naked in ecstasy,

1012
00:57:01,691 --> 00:57:02,560
dancing as the mushroom.

1013
00:57:02,561 --> 00:57:06,250
Clearly showing these people under
the effect of this psychedelic drug.

1014
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:11,560
And so it's me and it's yon and it's
Jack and it's Jack's friend and man,

1015
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,750
Jack's friend. All my alarms
are going off. I'm like,

1016
00:57:13,751 --> 00:57:18,390
this guy is just fucking weird, man. I'm
like, this guy is creeping me out. Yeah.

1017
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,700
You know, like to wait talks. I don't
like the way he interacts with me.

1018
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,890
I'm uncomfortable when it
gets close to me. I'm like,

1019
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,710
how are these people around
this guy? I'm like, this guy.

1020
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:29,340
Yeah. And I'm just not picking up any of
this. And you know, it's funny. It's like,

1021
00:57:29,341 --> 00:57:31,590
what? It must have been like six
months later, I called Joe Up,

1022
00:57:31,591 --> 00:57:34,320
I'm driving down the freeway one day and
I called you up and they're like, dude,

1023
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,410
you know that guy that was at
Jack's House that day? I was all,

1024
00:57:37,411 --> 00:57:38,820
he just got busted.
He's all,

1025
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:43,440
and then Joe interrupts me and he
said he was a pedophile and I went,

1026
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:47,880
oh my fucking God. How did you know?
And he's all, I just knew dude. Right?

1027
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,610
The guy got arrested for being,
yeah.

1028
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:53,400
The guy got arrested for pedophilia
and killed himself in jail. Wow.

1029
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:57,330
Or supposedly, oh no, he did.
Dude, he can set up this whole, no,

1030
00:57:57,331 --> 00:58:00,100
he set up this whole little
rich little ritual and oh,

1031
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,550
when he sent a letter to my friend about
the whole ritual that he was doing,

1032
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,520
I mean it was all like,
you know,

1033
00:58:05,521 --> 00:58:08,310
timed with the eclipse and all
this shit and with the pope,

1034
00:58:08,311 --> 00:58:10,770
with Pope John Paul's burial,
it was like,

1035
00:58:10,771 --> 00:58:13,650
what's his pocket with 2005 or some shit?

1036
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:18,960
No. Um, I don't know. I just
knew, I knew I wanted to kill him.

1037
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:22,590
When you're around certain people, when
you want to kill him, that's not good.

1038
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,270
Like when you're,
you feel like,

1039
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:27,420
you just feel like this is a
dangerous animal that's near me. Like,

1040
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:30,900
why am I allowing this thing to be
near me? I did mine. I don't, you know,

1041
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:33,920
like I said, I don't claim
to be perfect at this. I did.

1042
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:36,210
Raphael Tory guy totally
slipped through my radar.

1043
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,540
My mostly because I was stoned
as fuck when I was everywhere.

1044
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:41,310
I was hanging around with them. Right.
Maybe it was that. Maybe it was just too,

1045
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:42,190
you know,

1046
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:46,930
we were just known as fuck that day at
Jack Harris household places. Good point.

1047
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,180
Whatever it was,
this movement

1048
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:50,343
me off. Yeah, it was so,

1049
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:53,170
it was so uncomfortable because it was
the first time I was meeting Jack and it

1050
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:56,080
was a, it was really like, you know,
if you don't know who Jack Hara is,

1051
00:58:56,081 --> 00:59:00,880
Jack Hara wrote the book. The emperor
was sank him, rest in peace. Jack. Um,

1052
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:04,390
he wrote a book called the emperor wears
no clothes and it's a brilliant book

1053
00:59:04,391 --> 00:59:07,690
where it really breaks
down everything that, um,

1054
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:11,510
the whole history of standing up
and marijuana and medical marijuana.

1055
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,211
Actually,

1056
00:59:12,211 --> 00:59:16,730
our friend Todd McCormick has
rerelease this and they put a new one.

1057
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,340
Just have a new edition.
I haven't even,

1058
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:21,740
the Todd moved up north and I haven't any,

1059
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,770
I don't have a new one. I still have
the old one, but it's my library,

1060
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:26,330
which is in the other side of the house.
It's like,

1061
00:59:26,331 --> 00:59:29,960
he's like 12 autograph copies
from every edition from jacket.

1062
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:35,270
He was a guy who, it's really fascinating
story. He was a Goldwater Republican,

1063
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:36,370
a real man's man.

1064
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:40,460
It was in the military and this guy gets
divorced and he made some woman and you

1065
00:59:40,461 --> 00:59:41,360
know,
I wants to get laid.

1066
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:45,560
So he gets high with her and now all of
a sudden he like realizes the benefits

1067
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:48,320
of marijuana and then he gets
angry and realize it. Holy Shit.

1068
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:51,650
Like we're being fucked over and lied to.
Like this stuff is great.

1069
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:54,970
And dedicates his life to
letting people know how amazing.

1070
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,580
Literally the father of the
hip movement and uh, yeah,

1071
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:02,750
so he actually brought industrial hemp
back to like 50 comes. That's not him.

1072
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:08,040
The guy in the middle, the older
guy next to him. That guy. No, no,

1073
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:11,850
no. I have photos of the child molester
guy. I have a photo of all of us together.

1074
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:16,520
All of us, all of us together. You, me and
Jack and the dead child molester. Yeah,

1075
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:19,940
man, I knew when you called me
up, I just knew it sounds stupid.

1076
01:00:19,941 --> 01:00:23,450
I mean it could have been just a great
guest and I'm all cocky like you're a

1077
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:24,740
cold.
I knew it,

1078
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:28,040
but I knew when I was around that
there was something wrong with them.

1079
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:30,530
I knew it was so obvious to me.
I was like,

1080
01:00:30,531 --> 01:00:34,070
how are these mother fuckers hanging
out with this guy every now and then?

1081
01:00:34,071 --> 01:00:36,230
Like if that's the, the,
the danger that you run.

1082
01:00:36,231 --> 01:00:38,240
If you ever decide to have a party,
you know,

1083
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:42,080
like one buddy will bring this one dude
that's like completely insane and you're

1084
01:00:42,081 --> 01:00:44,990
like, how do you not know this guy's
at the scene? You know, like there's,

1085
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,250
there's certain people that were like,

1086
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:50,030
hang out with one person who is completely
off the charts crazy and they just

1087
01:00:50,031 --> 01:00:53,150
accepted probably cause they grew
up with them or something. Yeah.

1088
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:53,901
If you're having a party,

1089
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:56,600
that motherfucker come over crashing
and that's what that guy was.

1090
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,040
But that guy also,

1091
01:00:58,041 --> 01:01:01,790
besides being a complete fucking nut
and a psychopath and a child molester,

1092
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:06,970
he also was like really fascinated by
the idea of Santa Claus being the Amanita

1093
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,170
Mascara machine and the whole
history of that mushroom.

1094
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,530
But people don't know Santa Claus was
red and white. The laminated miscarry.

1095
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:16,130
A mushroom was written white Santa Claus
lives in Siberia and the North Pole,

1096
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,900
the emoney to miscarry a mushroom
that it's, you know, used by the shot.

1097
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:23,680
His favorite food is the enemy. We need
to miscarry a mushroom reindeer Caribou.

1098
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,450
Caribou is who characters.

1099
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:29,260
That's what they love to eat and they
literally will eat your pis. If you're P,

1100
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,920
if you step outside of a showman lodge,

1101
01:01:30,921 --> 01:01:33,140
when you're fucking doing these
mushrooms and you piss in the snow,

1102
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,540
they will knock you over
to eat your pits for those.

1103
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:37,190
You know what I should mention
for those interests to,

1104
01:01:37,191 --> 01:01:41,300
they can go out of my nonstick media
website and that's g, N, O, s t,

So much information. Oh,

1112
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:07,700
Adderall is one of those add drugs. It
makes you retain everything. Oh really?

1113
01:02:07,701 --> 01:02:10,490
Yeah. Adderall supposedly as the
best. If you ever want to work,

1114
01:02:10,491 --> 01:02:14,330
make these fuckers. Yeah. It's like
cocaine. Yeah. My friend rest his soul,

1115
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:17,900
Robert Schimmel, he, uh, he told
me once that a, someone else,

1116
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,010
like in his family or something
was on the Adderall and he

1117
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,740
accidentally take, took it, thought it
was something else and a freaked out.

1118
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:28,000
He had no, he did. He completely, because
he had had a heart attack before and uh,

1119
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:31,050
you know, he had, he had
some serious problems, some
health issues. He had cancer.

1120
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:34,200
I'm sorry, we didn't have a heart
attack. He had cancer. Um, so, you know,

1121
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:37,620
he wouldn't be a fucking with something
as crazy as Adderall if he didn't know

1122
01:02:37,621 --> 01:02:40,440
what it was. But he said he accidentally
took it. He called this doctor,

1123
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:43,230
doctor said, don't worry about it. You're
going to be fine. You just, you know,

1124
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:46,660
you'll just be under the effects of it for
the next, you know, 10 hours or so, it,

1125
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:50,070
whatever the fuck it is.
And he said he went on a cleaning rampage.

1126
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:51,600
He said he cleaned everything,

1127
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,660
organized all of his notes on all
of his material together. He said,

1128
01:02:54,661 --> 01:02:56,310
I have never been more focused in my life.

1129
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:58,920
It's for like attention
deficit disorder and stuff.

1130
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:00,250
Yeah.
So that's,

1131
01:03:00,251 --> 01:03:04,690
I'm recommending Adderall for Bush sugar
and corn Syrup and red food coloring

1132
01:03:04,691 --> 01:03:05,210
and shit.

1133
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:07,250
Well I'm sure it's caused by
a lot of things, but you know,

1134
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:11,450
in nutritional deficiencies are
responsible for a hoard of diseases.

1135
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:15,350
And so many of us just don't
eat, you know, they don't,
we don't take any vitamins.

1136
01:03:15,351 --> 01:03:16,460
We don't eat vegetables.

1137
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,310
People have been asking me about this
because I talked about on the podcast

1138
01:03:19,311 --> 01:03:22,040
about Vitamix blender
fucking thing that I got.

1139
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:25,960
I don't know the name of it because I'm
just sitting right here. I forgot. But um,

1140
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:26,150
it,

1141
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:30,760
what it is is a blender for it takes these
fruits and vegetables and just mashes

1142
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:34,310
them down like almost like they're pre
digested and that's the idea behind it.

1143
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:37,010
That instead of juice,
whereas you taking juice,

1144
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:39,770
you're squeezing all the liquids out
of it and you get a lot of minerals.

1145
01:03:39,771 --> 01:03:40,880
And nutrients,
everything like that.

1146
01:03:40,881 --> 01:03:43,670
But you don't get as much is
when you chop it up and blend it.

1147
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,770
So you chat with them about it.

1148
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,810
Kevin James has been on this for
the last year or so and she's lost.

1149
01:03:47,811 --> 01:03:51,410
Like I told you like 80 something pounds
when he looks fucking fantastic and he

1150
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:56,330
swears by this shit. So what I've been
eating is just Kale, cucumbers, pairs,

1151
01:03:56,450 --> 01:04:00,260
um, and um, uh, raw. Um, what's our stuff?

1152
01:04:00,261 --> 01:04:04,520
Ginger and I throw it all together in
that thing and it doesn't taste that good.

1153
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:09,460
But Sally Fallon's book
nourishing traditions. No, no.

1154
01:04:09,461 --> 01:04:11,140
What's that about it?
That's a really good one too.

1155
01:04:11,141 --> 01:04:16,141
She argues that the whole saturated
animal fats scare is a complete myth and

1156
01:04:17,081 --> 01:04:19,630
she's got a lot of
documentation to back it up.

1157
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:22,130
A lot of people think that animal
fat is actually very good for you.

1158
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:24,280
Well, she, she proves that a,

1159
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:28,870
that there was a good scandal with the
oil companies to cover up that animal

1160
01:04:28,871 --> 01:04:33,340
fats are oil companies, the oil companies,
because they were selling these new,

1161
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:37,540
newly invented a vegetable oils which
weren't around except for olive oil.

1162
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:41,350
And maybe him. Boy, you didn't
have vegetable oils on the
market before the 1920s.

1163
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,110
So she, even if she even shows that
you can, you can parallel the, uh,

1164
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:51,100
the explosion of a heart disease and
cancer in the United States. Exactly.

1165
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,690
With the use of vegetable
oils. Exactly. Yep. No kidding.

1166
01:04:56,260 --> 01:05:00,040
And she's got this really good Wii
video that you can get it off of Amazon

1167
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:02,500
called the oily and of
America. What, you know,

1168
01:05:02,501 --> 01:05:05,920
it's a really slow going video and she's
showing all the documentation on the

1169
01:05:05,921 --> 01:05:07,270
screen.
It'll blow your mind.

1170
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:12,420
Steve Maxwell's this master fitness guy,
trainer guy, he's an incredible dude,

1171
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:17,421
but he knows everything about health and
nutrition and exercises and said that

1172
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:18,190
lack

1173
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:23,100
of, uh, animal fat is the reason why
some people can get skin cancer. Well,

1174
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:26,800
body can't like you, like, like
a certain amount of cholesterol,

1175
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:31,750
certain amount of like, right. Well you
need a combination of things in your body.

1176
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:36,930
Basically what causes the heart attacks
and heart disease and all of that shit

1177
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,750
is vegetable oils and carbohydrates,
especially process carbos. You know,

1178
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,130
if you get rid of those things out
of your diet, heart disease, obesity,

1179
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:47,020
all that shit starts to clear up.
You know,

1180
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:49,720
certainly eat your vegetables and
things, but she says that, you know,

1181
01:05:49,721 --> 01:05:52,420
what a lot of people do is they'll go
out and they'll eat a salad and then

1182
01:05:52,421 --> 01:05:55,090
they'll pour a salad dressing all over it,

1183
01:05:55,091 --> 01:05:58,630
which is these processed vegetable
oils instead of, you know,

1184
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,840
all of oil or butter is basically
all you want to use on a salad.

1185
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:06,730
Any of these other new fangled
oils don't eat that shit at all.

1186
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,620
So it just,
what happens when you eat it,

1187
01:06:08,621 --> 01:06:11,840
your body just has a hard time processing
that your body, that's what all this,

1188
01:06:11,841 --> 01:06:14,370
this trans fat scare and what
they also do is, you know,

1189
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:18,970
they're allowed to actually put a half
a gram or anything less than a gram of

1190
01:06:18,971 --> 01:06:23,700
trans fat on any packages today is still
able to zero trans fats even though in

1191
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:24,790
it. Yep, we'll do,

1192
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:28,750
do you ever have salad farts salad far
to the most uncomfortable farts ever? No.

1193
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:32,800
Not Vegetable far salad bars cause that
goddamn salad dressing along with all

1194
01:06:32,801 --> 01:06:33,160
that.
Yeah.

1195
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,210
I usually only use hemp oil or olive
oil and balsamic vinegar on myself.

1196
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,650
He put oil on your salad,

1197
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:43,860
credibility signs.
Sometimes you just gotta stop,

1198
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:46,410
put some fucking strawberries
on there in college.

1199
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:51,660
You know it's very nutty. It tastes like
a very similar to olive oil. True Story.

1200
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:56,340
The jerk off with hand boil. No,
no, no. I just figured fuck it man.

1201
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:59,700
Why not try it? Maybe jerk off with
that stuff that actually gets you high.

1202
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:02,640
That shit that a, they sell it. The
little droppers. Do they sell it?

1203
01:07:02,641 --> 01:07:03,810
The medical marijuana places

1204
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,160
jerk off to that cause it's
Kinda getting your standard.

1205
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,460
Dick would be stoned as fuck.
That's funny.

1206
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,590
That'd be probably a pretty good
take one states and puts pussy.

1207
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:17,670
Well don't people put like cocaine
on girls' clips and stuff like that.

1208
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:22,800
Talking about you put it on your day off
that girl's pussy. Joey, talk about that.

1209
01:07:22,801 --> 01:07:25,770
I forgot all about that. That hotel
in the elevator. I get in and out.

1210
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:29,070
We're doing one's doing
cocaine in the elevator.

1211
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:32,040
There was just a girl just had her little
mirror out. Just fucking, I'm like,

1212
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,350
they didn't care. I walked
into the elevator. Hi Vegas.

1213
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,890
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
He fuck that shit in the elevator niche.

1214
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,710
Look at you. You're ratting
that grow out. Fuck that girl.

1215
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,770
There's going to be cops. They're going
to invade that place. Good. You know?

1216
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:48,840
Look for people, fucking
and cocaine. You're going to
ruin the whole Party, Brian.

1217
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:52,860
Good. Why good? Because you didn't stay at
the four seasons and no fucked up. Good,

1218
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:56,700
because you should not pay. If if, if I
wanted to sleep at the hotel impossible.

1219
01:07:56,910 --> 01:08:00,570
You should not sell that as a hotel.
You just sell that Brad's eight our lease.

1220
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,260
You sound like some delusional bitch.
She could see it. Listen to me.

1221
01:08:04,261 --> 01:08:07,140
You sound like a delusional bitch that
goes to a massage parlor where they give

1222
01:08:07,141 --> 01:08:10,140
out hand jobs and you didn't know it
was a massage parlor where they give out

1223
01:08:10,141 --> 01:08:13,290
hand jobs and you leave and you call
the cops. You're like, what the fuck?

1224
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:16,120
I just want a regular massage.
I paid for rent.

1225
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,440
Where's my regular massage?

1226
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:21,770
She massages me for just like five
minutes and she judge Jerky me off.

1227
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:26,420
Do you think every hotel will be like
that? No. It's not every hotel, bro.

1228
01:08:26,421 --> 01:08:30,110
It's the fuck hotel everybody else knew.
We know now.

1229
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:32,740
Just like when you go to your hand job,

1230
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,210
I'm just saying if you were on
Yelp and you type it in hotel,

1231
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,700
that thing has like three and
a half stars. I didn't go, hey,

1232
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:38,930
that looks like a nice hotel.

1233
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:40,830
And they didn't have stars
from people who work there.

1234
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:46,100
You didn't know it was planted.
I didn't know it was a fucking sex hotel.

1235
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:49,800
Now I know now. Well, don't complain now.

1236
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:52,790
Give me my money back when they go
somewhere else. No, no bitch. No.

1237
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:53,630
You had to learn.

1238
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:56,960
You had to pay to learn and now that
you know if you're looking for that,

1239
01:08:56,961 --> 01:08:58,190
if you ever looking for a hotel,

1240
01:08:58,191 --> 01:09:01,110
do ecstasy and Viagara and just
start fucking a bunch of random.

1241
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:04,820
Now you know the spot. You know the spot
where people are getting their freak on.

1242
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,970
Just like if you go to a massage parlor
and they rub your feet and then start

1243
01:09:08,971 --> 01:09:11,930
sucking your Dick, you know that's
a different kind of massage parlor.

1244
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,640
All right? Don't be
hating Brian. Fuck that

1245
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,990
hotel. Don't give out the
name. Even if Yelper if,

1246
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:21,190
if the people at Yelp are listening,
please give me my Yelp elite status back.

1247
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,033
Don't give it to you.

1248
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:28,870
He's my friend and I'd say ignore
his requests. Fuck you, dude.

1249
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,530
It's ridiculous, Hayden. Right? Don't
you think he's say, that's total party.

1250
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:36,020
I would love to have seen [inaudible]
Williams for Todd McCord. Mccord.

1251
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:38,650
You will ever see Joe turn around
and go to another hotel. Yeah,

1252
01:09:38,651 --> 01:09:42,490
because you can do, man, you just
got to be willing to bite the bullet.

1253
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,090
Chomp down.
Yeah.

1254
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:50,780
Fuck that hotel in has in
the ass. How rude, dude.

1255
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,300
That's all I have to say to you. How
rude. She didn't call it a hotel.

1256
01:09:53,301 --> 01:09:53,840
That's all I'm saying.

1257
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:57,800
Another guy we hung out with this weekend
was a George sucralose, sucralose,

1258
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,640
sucralose, Giorgio sucralose, the
guy from ancient aliens. Right.

1259
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,580
What a fascinating cat and do is awesome.
He is great.

1260
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:08,350
We had a great fucking time, man. He
was way cooler than I could've imagined.

1261
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:10,910
Both him and Anthony
Bordain way cooler than,

1262
01:10:10,911 --> 01:10:13,760
I couldn't imagine Giorgio
came back stage with us.

1263
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,010
I don't want to say he smoked some weed.

1264
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:22,440
We had a great fucking time.
We hung out with me and that dude like

1265
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:24,540
right away clicked instantly.
You know,

1266
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:27,480
he makes some fantastical
claims on that show,

1267
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:31,830
but you know when you talk to him in
real life, he ain't married to anything.

1268
01:10:31,831 --> 01:10:35,130
He's not married to any thought.
You know, we discussed aliens,

1269
01:10:35,131 --> 01:10:37,650
we discussed possibilities.
He's like,

1270
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:40,170
it's just a possibility and there's
another possible and there's nothing and

1271
01:10:40,171 --> 01:10:43,410
he's not married to any of them and
he's super cool and a really nice guy.

1272
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,230
He comes off, I liked him on
the show. I liked that wacky.

1273
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:47,580
I would be like this wacky motherfucker.

1274
01:10:47,581 --> 01:10:51,060
He's like saying all kinds of crazy shit.
But sometimes he would annoy me.

1275
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,150
I'm going to be honest,
like you said, like,

1276
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,440
like maybe Atlantis was a
spaceship and took off. You know,

1277
01:10:55,441 --> 01:10:57,840
maybe my Dick is a helicopter
and I'll fly to Mars. Like,

1278
01:10:57,841 --> 01:10:59,040
what the fuck are you talking about?

1279
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:03,620
Maybe Santa Claus as a, but I don't
have any evidence for it. Yeah, you

1280
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:06,560
just completely dismiss it. It's
nonsense, but it's a show, right?

1281
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:09,380
That's what he's doing. He's doing a TV
show and when you're doing a TV show,

1282
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,251
look,
you know,

1283
01:11:10,251 --> 01:11:13,010
I could tell you right off the bat there's
some shit that you say that kind of

1284
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,490
move the show along,
you know,

1285
01:11:14,491 --> 01:11:17,400
and there's some shit that you say may
maybe what if maybe you want to hear

1286
01:11:17,401 --> 01:11:18,990
something crazy.
I'll give you some crazy shit.

1287
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:22,350
You want a sound bite and I'll give you
a sound bite and maybe, and you know,

1288
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:26,220
you might not even believe that. Maybe
what you say it anyway, but in real life,

1289
01:11:26,221 --> 01:11:27,150
talking to him in real life,

1290
01:11:27,151 --> 01:11:30,120
he's cool as fuck great hair to
his fucking hair's all crazy.

1291
01:11:30,121 --> 01:11:33,840
It's like some crazy peacock fan going
on. He, she fucking owns it, dude.

1292
01:11:33,841 --> 01:11:38,270
He owns it. He loves it. He has
crazy beads on and shit. Yeah, I did.

1293
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,240
Very nice jeans.
I dig him.

1294
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:43,830
He's going to be on show
July 27 this weekend.

1295
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:46,020
It's going to be me and mad flavor.

1296
01:11:46,021 --> 01:11:49,350
Aka Joe Diaz at the Irvine Improv.

1297
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:52,410
That is a Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.

1298
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:56,850
You dirty dirty Orange
County bridges and uh,

1299
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,940
this is going to be a, it's almost sold
out on Friday and Saturday already.

1300
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:04,560
And then Sunday is um,
the 10th is the last day we're doing it.

1301
01:12:04,561 --> 01:12:08,640
So it should be a lot of fun. You know,
that's an awesome club. Irvine is a place,

1302
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:10,910
it's a great place to do stand up.
I love that level.

1303
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:14,030
That whole area down there before yeah.
Is Nice.

1304
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:17,340
It's like a nice little oasis of
cool shit to do. Like a Ferris wheel.

1305
01:12:17,341 --> 01:12:19,440
Is that one of the Ferris wheel?
I think it has a Ferris wheel.

1306
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:23,330
There's the one with the
first is in Irvine. Yeah.

1307
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:25,980
There was even a place out
back to smoke out. Yeah.

1308
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,010
We'll start with you got to have that
if you're going to have a goddamn comedy

1309
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:31,140
show.
Yeah.

1310
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,600
I got a little nervous that Anthony
Bourdain was in the audience and I was

1311
01:12:33,601 --> 01:12:36,570
worried if I was too high. I was like,
how many hits I have? I had three heads.

1312
01:12:36,571 --> 01:12:40,440
Shit, I'm skiing right now. Cause
when you have three heads you got it.

1313
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:43,980
For as long as I know that I've gone over
my material and I know that I've been

1314
01:12:43,981 --> 01:12:46,080
performing a lot and I know
that I'm in the groove,

1315
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:47,520
I can just go out there and ski.

1316
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:51,990
And by skiing means you never watched
those videos where a dude gets dropped on

1317
01:12:51,991 --> 01:12:56,100
top of a mountain on the helicopter and
then do a lot of cocaine and then he's

1318
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:00,600
going down that mountain and it's some
uncharted territory and you know this guy

1319
01:13:00,601 --> 01:13:04,200
fucking hits a rock the wrong way.
He's done right.

1320
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:08,310
This guy's coming back behind. Yeah,
the avalanche behind them and you know,

1321
01:13:08,311 --> 01:13:11,700
there's no way he can stop. He cannot
control this. He's going way too fast.

1322
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:13,830
That's how you feel when
you get three hits in.

1323
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:15,690
They kind of know what
the fuck you're doing.

1324
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:19,320
When you go on stage that hot you gotta
be prepared. But fortunately I was,

1325
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,230
fortunately I was completely
comfortable in, in the groove.

1326
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:27,570
These comedy shows have gotten 80%
better in the last year and a half.

1327
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,260
And it's because of the podcast.
It's 100% because of the podcast.

1328
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:33,780
I asked people on stage,
how many guys listen to the podcast?

1329
01:13:33,781 --> 01:13:36,330
The place went fucking crazy.
It was all of them.

1330
01:13:36,331 --> 01:13:39,990
It was all 1500 people that were
there that it's, it's nuts man.

1331
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:43,500
They're all polite and friendly.
It's like he used to be like,

1332
01:13:43,501 --> 01:13:45,960
you have to battle just
to get ground on stage.

1333
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:49,260
And now when Joey and Ari
and Doug Benson one onstage,

1334
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,990
all three of them got
huge rounds of applause.

1335
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:55,580
Like everybody was psyched to see Ari
there was psyched to see Joey there was

1336
01:13:55,581 --> 01:13:59,850
psyched to see Doug. It's a just an
amazing thing now. It's so different.

1337
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,670
Even in huge to that place is so huge.

1338
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:07,020
That's where the lion king is like
usually this huge fucking show is usually

1339
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:11,440
there and now it's good. I know we
packed it just talking. It's ridiculous.

1340
01:14:11,441 --> 01:14:15,490
Comedy is a strange thing, but the, it's
still my favorite thing to watch, man.

1341
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:17,650
You know,
I thought about staying an extra day.

1342
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:22,800
I was going to stay until Sunday cause
bill burr and Jim Norton and Jim Breuer

1343
01:14:23,891 --> 01:14:28,450
and Dave Attell are all doing a show
together at the palm and up for a minute.

1344
01:14:28,451 --> 01:14:29,770
I was thinking, why don't I, you know,

1345
01:14:29,771 --> 01:14:33,010
fly out Mrs Rogan for the day and
we'll go to see a comedy show.

1346
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,890
Like maybe she would be into that. And
I'm like, can we get the fuck home?

1347
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:36,400
You know,

1348
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:40,570
I changed my mind but I do love stand
up so much that I almost stayed an extra

1349
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:44,470
day to watch this show because I went
out to dinner Saturday night with Jim

1350
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:45,920
Norton and Bill Burr and uh,

1351
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:49,090
my friend Justin from the actual report
and Russell Peters were there too.

1352
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,210
And so we're all sitting around and
Kenny, you know, clubs would have county.

1353
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,770
We're all sitting around
shooting the shit.

1354
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:56,410
And they were telling me
about Jim brewers new bit.

1355
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:00,580
Jim Breuer apparently has some clothes
or that is just insane about him.

1356
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:03,700
His Dad taking a ship and they were
all talking about like how this,

1357
01:15:03,701 --> 01:15:06,040
this thing builds up like
his dad shit in the car.

1358
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:09,350
His Dad's like an older guy and apparently
it's the funniest fucking better one

1359
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:13,440
bed time. And they were, and
I was like [inaudible] know.
Right, right. Yeah. Okay.

1360
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:14,840
Vegan called that.

1361
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:22,060
I know he's doing well. He did. He did.
He did well in front of large audiences.

1362
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,150
Ice House Thursday,
Brian went on in front of a,

1363
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:28,140
I mean one of the first times ever got
him to do comedy. All right, this is,

1364
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:32,830
this has got, you know, this took Matt
balls. This was way before the podcast.

1365
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,660
The audience was all meat heads.

1366
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:38,410
It was a UFC audience in Atlanta
and it was a midnight show.

1367
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:40,390
So it was a midnight fucking show.

1368
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:44,560
And Brian goes on in the middle
of the fucking show and kills you.

1369
01:15:44,561 --> 01:15:48,190
You and you pulled yourself out of the
fire because you started bombing and then

1370
01:15:48,191 --> 01:15:51,130
you pulled yourself out of the fire and
then at the end you ended like really

1371
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:55,490
strong. And that was the first time he
did comedy and like years and years.

1372
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,020
Six years. Really? Yeah.

1373
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,550
But then I've thrown them up a bunch of
times and I'm throwing them up in Austin,

1374
01:16:00,551 --> 01:16:04,570
Texas in front of sold out crowds.
And you know it's interesting like your,

1375
01:16:04,571 --> 01:16:08,460
your introduction to comedy is 1000%
different than the average person's

1376
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:12,070
introductions cheat codes.
It's traded on two ways.

1377
01:16:12,071 --> 01:16:15,030
One because everybody knows who
you are before you can go on stage.

1378
01:16:15,031 --> 01:16:17,830
Cause then you'll get from the podcast
now and they know you from all of the

1379
01:16:17,831 --> 01:16:20,650
videos that you've made. You know, if you
ever watched the Carlos men see a video,

1380
01:16:20,651 --> 01:16:22,180
that was Brian's work and all,

1381
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:25,600
there's all these videos called death
squad videos are all Brian's work.

1382
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:29,080
And so they already know who you are
and you're an open mic or basically,

1383
01:16:29,081 --> 01:16:29,231
you know,

1384
01:16:29,231 --> 01:16:32,080
you're just starting out and yet they
still know who you are and they're all

1385
01:16:32,081 --> 01:16:34,410
clapping and cheering to watch
you practice out your new jokes.

1386
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,330
Yeah, it kind of sucks
cause I, there's more,

1387
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,570
a little bit more pressure because now
people know who I am and now I'm getting

1388
01:16:39,571 --> 01:16:42,960
thrown up in front of sold out show
is I actually have to act somewhat.

1389
01:16:42,961 --> 01:16:44,550
Like I fit in,
you know,

1390
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,710
you just do it.
Just be relaxed.

1391
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:52,270
You a smoked some weed before you go on
to that idea. I found Brian has to, uh,

1392
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:56,680
you, you could go and, and I'm not dissing
you in any way. I'm just being honest.

1393
01:16:56,860 --> 01:17:00,730
You could go and work with a coach
who would help you learn how to speak.

1394
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:05,610
I figured it out. It's, it's got 100%
marijuana. It, I, it does not work for me.

1395
01:17:05,611 --> 01:17:09,830
When I get stoned, my brain goes, no,
I can still, my brain goes overdrive.

1396
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:12,680
I'm thinking a thousand things at once.
Like I'm almost like

1397
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:14,770
trying to figure out,
you know,

1398
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:17,640
you don't need to learn how to
manage it with your mouth. Yeah.

1399
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:22,500
But when I'm on stage, my, like
my memories everywhere, you know,

1400
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:24,470
you just got to do it more.

1401
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:27,930
Go Do it 20 or 30 times and get
over that and then it'll kick.

1402
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:31,960
Okay. I found, but I just found
that, you know, I'd rather not,

1403
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:33,960
I'd rather just go out
with like a drink in me

1404
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:36,510
and I'm good. No, try to
get me to go on stage.

1405
01:17:36,511 --> 01:17:39,250
What about six years ago and I
chickened out. He checked it out.

1406
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:42,630
I tried to get everybody to do it. Smart.
I think someone's smart. I'm like, look,

1407
01:17:42,631 --> 01:17:45,780
if you're smart, you can figure it out.
Comedy, if you're smart, you're nice,

1408
01:17:45,781 --> 01:17:48,900
and you make your friends laugh, you could
figure it out. Colony, it ain't easy,

1409
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:50,550
but God damn,
if you could do it,

1410
01:17:50,551 --> 01:17:52,520
it's the greatest job in
the history of the world. I,

1411
01:17:52,521 --> 01:17:55,050
I'm constantly trying to recruit
people to try stand up comedy.

1412
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,090
I ran into some fucking
17 year old kid in Vegas.

1413
01:17:57,091 --> 01:17:59,640
I've talked to him for 20 minutes because
him and his friend were thinking about

1414
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:03,150
doing standup comedy and they're asking
me for advice and I said, all right,

1415
01:18:03,151 --> 01:18:05,360
I'm not doing anything. I'll, I'll
tell you everything I know. You know,

1416
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,350
this is what you gotta do.
You gotta write like fucking crazy.

1417
01:18:07,351 --> 01:18:09,780
You've got to go up every time you can
and you got to listen to your own shit.

1418
01:18:09,781 --> 01:18:13,080
Go back and listen to recordings.
Be Honest. If a bid is bombing,

1419
01:18:13,081 --> 01:18:14,670
try it differently.
And if it,

1420
01:18:14,671 --> 01:18:17,160
you eventually you're gonna have to
give up on that bitch and move on.

1421
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:19,290
Constantly keep writing.
Like we went on this long thing,

1422
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:22,560
I go put yourself in positions where,
you know, some weird shit might go down.

1423
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:24,930
That's a good way to write material.
Like you've got to think that way.

1424
01:18:24,931 --> 01:18:27,810
You gotta be a professional party
animal, you know, for real, like the,

1425
01:18:27,811 --> 01:18:30,380
the greatest comics ever.
The Richard Pryor's and Sam Kinison,

1426
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:32,370
they were out there getting shit done.
All right.

1427
01:18:32,371 --> 01:18:35,550
It wasn't just going on stage and talk
and they were living a crazy life too.

1428
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:38,940
That's part of the program to, I
don't, it doesn't mean abusive.

1429
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,910
It doesn't mean what they did, but
it means, you know, try shit out.

1430
01:18:41,911 --> 01:18:45,360
So fucking on the 15 at 200 miles an
hour and getting a head on. Yeah. I mean,

1431
01:18:45,361 --> 01:18:46,290
that's why I needed to,

1432
01:18:46,291 --> 01:18:48,240
Colorado was one of the reasons
besides wanting to get away,

1433
01:18:48,241 --> 01:18:49,860
I knew that I was gonna get
some material out of that.

1434
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:54,700
Like you've got to do things like that.
So I, I, I'm a fucking huge supporter,

1435
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:57,240
standup comedy. I tried to get everybody
to do it. I tried to get taped to do it.

1436
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:00,900
I got you to do it while you're
done it before. But I got, you know,

1437
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,510
I've gotten a couple of people to do
what I've got to Eddie Bravo to do it.

1438
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:05,280
It's just nobody sticks with it.

1439
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:07,600
That was the big thing is,
is that it's definitely,

1440
01:19:07,601 --> 01:19:10,540
I think something you have to start
when you're younger and you have to make

1441
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:14,110
that year career and I think all these
people that you had try it. Yeah.

1442
01:19:14,111 --> 01:19:16,630
They had their own thing going and they
were doing it as for fun on the side.

1443
01:19:16,631 --> 01:19:18,280
Kind of like what I do.
But they're not,

1444
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:22,330
they don't want that as a job because
it cause that's really risky to do it.

1445
01:19:22,331 --> 01:19:22,500
Right.

1446
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:27,140
Well, you're 36 hours to do it.
We were all young, you know. Fuck.

1447
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:31,463
Wow.

1448
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:36,610
Have you ever driven a home from Vegas
and see night that abandoned water slide.

1449
01:19:36,611 --> 01:19:37,830
Amusement side of the,
yeah.

1450
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:42,200
Oh, what the hell was the,
uh, it's creepy. Like Dolores,
that's what it was. Yeah.

1451
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:46,180
We were going to break into it and just
like walk around with some cameras and

1452
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:49,720
stuff on the way home. But we are, the
traffic was so bad so we decided not to.

1453
01:19:49,721 --> 01:19:54,721
So if there's this Wikipedia page all
about it and it's so amazing the history

1454
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:56,500
of that amusement park,

1455
01:19:56,501 --> 01:20:00,280
like in the fifties and sixties this
businessman bought it and he just put this

1456
01:20:00,281 --> 01:20:03,490
water slide amusement park in the middle
of the Mojave desert I think it is or

1457
01:20:03,491 --> 01:20:06,050
something like that in the middle of the
desert and there's this huge waterpark

1458
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,220
knows fifties themes.
It was like very like fifties

1459
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,610
music and sixties music and stuff
like that. And it just, you know,

1460
01:20:11,611 --> 01:20:14,030
it was millions of dollars in the,

1461
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,420
I remember in like the late seventies
and eighties all the time on TV you would

1462
01:20:18,421 --> 01:20:21,130
see like Dolores commercials and
stuff, but the, you know, you know,

1463
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:24,720
they would say it's time I 15 but they
didn't tell you is three fucking hours

1464
01:20:24,721 --> 01:20:25,870
from here.
So

1465
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:31,740
[inaudible] bought it and renamed it
things every 10 years it would close and

1466
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:33,030
then be closed for like five years.

1467
01:20:33,031 --> 01:20:36,540
And somebody else would read by and try
for a year and then we'd go bankrupt and

1468
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:39,900
now somebody else is just a,
just bought it again is trying it again.

1469
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:42,570
And they have like this whole youtube
page and website all about them,

1470
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:46,940
like restoring it and stuff like that.
It is the dumbest idea ever.

1471
01:20:46,941 --> 01:20:48,420
Like people are fucking retarded.

1472
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:53,560
Going to go through the middle
of a desert to go to, you know,

1473
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:57,780
see what the, I guess for them, like
they're planning on that business.

1474
01:20:57,781 --> 01:21:01,880
When you have the, the occasional car
accident, it shuts down the whole fuck,

1475
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,700
right.
Let's go to the water bar,

1476
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,730
stock car accidents and they're all in
the lay down some fucking nails trips.

1477
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,940
Oh Man. Let me now share on Memorial
Day weekend out in Vegas. And it's like,

1478
01:21:11,941 --> 01:21:16,640
it was like 1214 hours getting
across that four hours. Anyway,

1479
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:20,230
man, it sucked, man. 14
hours. Really? It was,

1480
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:23,070
it was five,
10 miles an hour most of the way.

1481
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:26,440
Imagine if you had a
clutch. Oh God. Oh God.

1482
01:21:26,441 --> 01:21:30,620
That took me six hours yesterday
driving a standard kind of traffic.

1483
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:35,630
We'll drive you fucking
insane. Yeah. Six hours.

1484
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:39,560
Don't fucking drive. Ever. Never
expanded that she went back.

1485
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:42,440
You got caught going back. I'm going
back. I didn't think about going there.

1486
01:21:42,441 --> 01:21:46,370
You went easy, right? Easy. Three hours
and 15 minutes and fucking amazing.

1487
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:47,870
Super fast.
Way Back.

1488
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:52,400
We stayed an extra day so I could
do a set at the nightly show and,

1489
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:56,810
and then um, I didn't think about it.
I'm like, wait, everyone has Monday off.

1490
01:21:57,050 --> 01:22:00,470
So they're probably going to have probably
have to work Tuesday so everybody's

1491
01:22:00,471 --> 01:22:01,820
going to be traveling back Monday.

1492
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:05,180
So I picked the worst data
ever drive back from Vegas.

1493
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:07,950
It was only [inaudible] you go
to a flight. Yeah, absolutely.

1494
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:12,920
And that's leaving 9:00 AM to, I
mean I left fucking early. Wow.

1495
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:15,650
9:00 AM six hours. Yeah. You
gotta go like four in the morning.

1496
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:19,250
You gotta just stay up there. Just got
to take those five hour energy drinks.

1497
01:22:19,251 --> 01:22:21,180
Jenna Hayes did that to a like that one.

1498
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:24,020
I'm just slightly less than
what you get with it. Stroke,

1499
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:29,510
just less than a strokes dose and then
just ride that bitch just right when you

1500
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:30,344
started twitching.

1501
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:36,790
That's what all night foot to the
fucking floor looking out for coyotes,

1502
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:42,590
both human and otherwise. Right. That's
a creepy fucking stretch of road man.

1503
01:22:42,591 --> 01:22:43,690
Those,
that's boulevard

1504
01:22:44,110 --> 01:22:46,860
you. They were supposed to put a bullet
train out there like 10 years ago.

1505
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:49,690
I think it never did.
And I think they're still doing it from,

1506
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:52,150
isn't it from Santa Monica to
Vegas or something like that.

1507
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:54,870
You have to come up long
dollars to make that happen.

1508
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:59,530
Okay. Do you know, and it's
such a long highway, you know
it's been, it's been, what,

1509
01:22:59,531 --> 01:23:01,360
two lanes since the fricking sixties yeah.

1510
01:23:01,361 --> 01:23:04,990
It's ridiculous that the road is
ridiculous this, but you know what,

1511
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:05,980
there was no one's going to

1512
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,200
do anything different because the airline
industry doesn't want anybody driving.

1513
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:12,040
You know, the airline industry
wants everybody, you know,

1514
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:14,740
flying as much as possible.
And then what,

1515
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:18,010
who's going to spend the money to Wa
is Vegas going to spend the money that

1516
01:23:18,011 --> 01:23:19,580
you've talking about a lot
of fucking money problems.

1517
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,970
Nobody else is going to want
to like why would we do that?

1518
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,930
How about you figure it out in
your own fuck face and sure.

1519
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:27,550
California has casinos as well. Yeah.
It's probably put a dampener on the whole,

1520
01:23:27,551 --> 01:23:30,650
but they don't really have
casinos. I mean, they do and
they don't, you know, it's,

1521
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:33,210
they're not full casinos.
You can't do everything at the casinos.

1522
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:36,640
You can't play slots and blackjack
and poker. You know what I mean?

1523
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:39,340
It's like you have like
little restrictions like this
one. You can only do this.

1524
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:43,300
There's these, you don't let to play
cards. Casino. Yeah. You might know this.

1525
01:23:43,301 --> 01:23:46,120
I had a lot of people have been
telling me this lately that the medical

1526
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:49,900
marijuana in Vegas, you can use your
California license and they accept it.

1527
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:53,320
The California license in Vegas do that
in a couple different states. Really?

1528
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:55,750
Yeah. They told me they
do that in Denver as well.

1529
01:23:56,730 --> 01:24:01,130
No, no. That's the first I heard.
Yeah. Todd Todd or Chris Conrad would

1530
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:03,230
be open, I guess. Yeah,
you would have to a,

1531
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:07,260
it would be different things state
by state, you know, but they, oh,

1532
01:24:07,261 --> 01:24:09,810
they took it when we were in a Vancouver.
Yeah.

1533
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:12,780
When Vancouver they accepted
our California recommendations.

1534
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:16,520
You need one in Vancouver because last
time I was up there there was blunt

1535
01:24:16,521 --> 01:24:17,990
brothers and stuff.
You could just,

1536
01:24:18,230 --> 01:24:22,520
you'll be seeing smoke British Columbia,
not Vancouver, Washington. No. Yeah,

1537
01:24:22,521 --> 01:24:25,520
you did. There was um,
there was a pharmacies,

1538
01:24:25,521 --> 01:24:28,630
now they have dispensaries
in Vancouver. BC. Rice. Yeah.

1539
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:31,700
They're setting it up just like
California. But California has at the,

1540
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:33,580
we're at the front. Oh
yeah. The front of mine.

1541
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:35,920
There's nowhere will like this
anywhere on the planet. I don't know.

1542
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:39,180
Well, you know, and uh, right now
Amsterdam was shutting everything down.

1543
01:24:39,181 --> 01:24:41,090
So guess where all that business
is going to start coming? It's,

1544
01:24:41,091 --> 01:24:42,990
see there's going to be here.
It's going to be Vancouver.

1545
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:45,850
You see the fuck is Amsterdam thinking
that was the dumbest shit ever.

1546
01:24:45,851 --> 01:24:47,810
You guys are known for
weed and you're going

1547
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:49,700
and that's,
and it's been legal for what,

1548
01:24:49,701 --> 01:24:53,300
35 years or something and now they're
going to shut it down to only residents.

1549
01:24:53,301 --> 01:24:56,120
What the hell, you know?
Yeah. What does that,

1550
01:24:56,121 --> 01:24:58,830
what it is too many people
tripping and fucking, I mean,

1551
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:04,040
you'll get like 10 but see how many people
do dumb shit on alcohol every night.

1552
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:08,330
Alcohol is by far the worst drug
out there in every study ever done.

1553
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:08,930
But when you have,

1554
01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:12,690
you know Frank's house and there's people
showrooming like Dunkin donuts every

1555
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:13,260
Sunday,

1556
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:17,480
every couple of people that dove off a
bridge and committed suicide on mushrooms

1557
01:25:17,481 --> 01:25:18,800
and Amsterdam.
And it's like,

1558
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:23,230
you know how many fricking people do that
shit at night on alcohol and, and, and,

1559
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:27,800
you know, Holland alone. Well,
so scared. It's like, oh my God,

1560
01:25:27,801 --> 01:25:28,910
they would have done it anyway.

1561
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:33,260
It's way easier to a band things
than it is to make things legal.

1562
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:38,150
And we make it very easy to
write things off and decide that,

1563
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:39,430
you know, like there's people, right?

1564
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:42,930
Behavior, oh my God.
People without any studies

1565
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:45,400
whatsoever. They're trying to outlaw
Salvia, you know, and they're,

1566
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:48,610
they're pulling it off in,
in various states and making it illegal.

1567
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:51,150
And there's no research behind
any of this. They're just pulling.

1568
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:56,110
Oh yeah. And all this stuff is scare
tactics. You know, it's like this kid did,

1569
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:58,480
you know, a couple of years ago,
there was this big scare back east.

1570
01:25:58,481 --> 01:26:01,420
This kid had done salvia
several months before,

1571
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:05,600
wrote in his diary that he could see how
half the shit in his life was complete

1572
01:26:05,601 --> 01:26:09,170
bullshit. He was starting to see
through the big fucking lie out there.

1573
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:12,620
And then they said, you know,
months later they tried to say, oh,

1574
01:26:12,621 --> 01:26:15,710
well he committed suicide
because of Salvia,

1575
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:20,780
even though he was not on Salvia and
he had done it months before, you know,

1576
01:26:20,781 --> 01:26:22,520
it's, it's that he, you know,

1577
01:26:22,521 --> 01:26:27,020
he certainly started seeing how a lot
of what the media and government and

1578
01:26:27,021 --> 01:26:30,380
things like that tell you is bullshit
until they come up with a suicide.

1579
01:26:30,381 --> 01:26:32,460
It's like saying, you know, Lsd, you know,

1580
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:37,040
somebody waking up from LSD like a
Timothy leary and then years later they

1581
01:26:37,041 --> 01:26:40,520
commit suicide. Oh, it's because
it was because of the LSD. Okay.

1582
01:26:40,521 --> 01:26:44,090
But you can clearly make some sort of
a connection between some of those kids

1583
01:26:44,091 --> 01:26:45,650
that got experimented on in Harvard,

1584
01:26:45,651 --> 01:26:49,160
like Ted Kaczynski and
his behavior afterwards.

1585
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:51,840
We'll sure there is a connection
between really. Yeah. You know,

1586
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:54,050
I would love to know what trips,
what they did to him.

1587
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,800
I would really like to know what they
did to Ted Kaczynski. The unibomber.

1588
01:26:57,801 --> 01:27:01,430
Ted Kaczynski was a part of the
Harvard LSD studies and he was,

1589
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:05,480
he was a professor of math up at Berkeley.
This was no dumb shit.

1590
01:27:05,481 --> 01:27:09,620
This was a top scholar. Yeah. He
just completely lost his marbles.

1591
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:14,810
Presumably during these LSD experiments.
Maybe they expose something.

1592
01:27:14,811 --> 01:27:18,260
Maybe they, uh, they broke. So what's
that documentary called about him?

1593
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:22,610
That's a good question. I
don't remember. Oh, shoot. Is
that, I've seen it. Yeah. Yeah.

1594
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:26,930
I forget. Just look up, look up
a unibomber documentary. I'm,

1595
01:27:26,931 --> 01:27:29,640
I'm sure you'll find it,
but it's a, yeah, it's,

1596
01:27:29,641 --> 01:27:32,930
it's about something with the computer
industry as well, I think. Yes,

1597
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:37,960
yes. Well, you know, he, uh,
it's really fascinating what
he did when, when is it? No,

1598
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:42,740
that's a new one. When your brother
was the Unabomber, the net than that.

1599
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:45,600
Exactly. That's it. Um, he, uh,

1600
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:49,000
he saved up all his money after
these studies and worked, uh,

1601
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:52,890
as a professor of mathematics at Berkeley.
And when he was working there,

1602
01:27:52,891 --> 01:27:56,490
he was just studying and saving up his
money and trying to figure out what the

1603
01:27:56,491 --> 01:27:59,220
fuck he was going to do when he moved
to the woods and how he was going to

1604
01:27:59,240 --> 01:27:59,740
tactics.

1605
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:00,220
Yeah.
You know,

1606
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:04,720
I would love to know who was in
charge of the study that he was in.

1607
01:28:04,721 --> 01:28:06,910
Was it Dick Alpert?
Was it Tim leary?

1608
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:10,970
What he did was absolutely horrible.
You know, and what he did for sure,

1609
01:28:10,971 --> 01:28:13,760
that guy should go to jail for it for
sure. He was absolutely insane for sure.

1610
01:28:13,761 --> 01:28:14,600
He was homicidal.

1611
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:19,870
But the thought behind what he was
saying was that technology is eventually

1612
01:28:20,151 --> 01:28:20,920
going to kill us.

1613
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,800
Right. Well, yeah, we need to stop. Well,

1614
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:26,490
basically what he was arguing was that
they're using the technology to enslave

1615
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:29,380
everybody and to dumb us down
and to control everything.

1616
01:28:29,381 --> 01:28:34,080
And he was trying to stop it because
he started being the math professor at

1617
01:28:34,090 --> 01:28:37,120
Berkeley started seeing how the whole
system worked and he wanted to shut it

1618
01:28:37,121 --> 01:28:39,610
down. Right. I mean, well, the
way he did it was nice and saying,

1619
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:42,980
you know what kills a bunch. Yeah, he, Oh
fuck people's lives up. You know, he's,

1620
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:47,020
he went about it. You know, he
didn't use critical thinking.

1621
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:50,410
Properly run is an
analysis of his solution,

1622
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:52,000
but there's something to what he sang.

1623
01:28:52,270 --> 01:28:55,720
The idea that technology eventually is
going to overtake us. It's absolutely,

1624
01:28:55,721 --> 01:29:00,460
I mean it's discussed in depth
by thousands of scientists
and futurists and the

1625
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:02,430
rate Kurt's and my grandfather,

1626
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:05,010
your grandfather talks about that
shit and hates technology so that it's

1627
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:08,130
overtaking us. Just to say
that all the time. Well,

1628
01:29:08,131 --> 01:29:10,080
I think anybody at our grandfather's,

1629
01:29:10,081 --> 01:29:13,110
an older guy grew up in a time where
there was no phones and no nothing.

1630
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:16,350
We put out a documentary
last November called, uh,

1631
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:20,010
what you've been missing in
episode one of the noble lie,

1632
01:29:20,011 --> 01:29:23,160
which goes into this whole use
of technology to dumb us down.

1633
01:29:23,161 --> 01:29:27,000
So anybody wants to check that out. Look
it up. I think it's a silly argument.

1634
01:29:27,001 --> 01:29:28,740
I don't think,
I don't think it dumbs us down.

1635
01:29:28,741 --> 01:29:30,330
I think there are dumber people than ever.

1636
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:33,240
It's because life has
become easy for them.

1637
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:36,560
It's easy to become dumb or checkout
and checkout the how they're,

1638
01:29:36,561 --> 01:29:37,231
they're doing it.

1639
01:29:37,231 --> 01:29:41,610
They're using the BF Skinner's ideas
from the Skinner box and how they

1640
01:29:41,611 --> 01:29:43,840
controlled animals and things like that.
Uh,

1641
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,920
there's a lot of Edward Bernays was
talking about, what are you talking about?

1642
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:48,100
Well,
Skinner,

1643
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:52,110
the Skinner box is a box that they would
put a pigeons and rats and things like

1644
01:29:52,111 --> 01:29:56,310
that and get them to do certain things
for food or whatever on a stimuli.

1645
01:29:56,610 --> 01:30:01,320
And they've learned to apply that stuff
directly to computer games and to,

1646
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:05,070
uh, you know, purchasing and the grocery
stores and things like things like that.

1647
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:08,370
But what checkouts checkout
checkout, it's, you know,

1648
01:30:08,371 --> 01:30:11,570
it's an hour and a half long documentary.
Just, you know, what you've been missing.

1649
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:12,600
Episode one,

1650
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:17,020
check it out sometimes what you've been
missing episode one and it did. Okay.

1651
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:17,950
And they can,

1652
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:21,570
they can go to the gnostic media website
and click on the videos thing there and

1653
01:30:21,571 --> 01:30:26,490
it'll be right there. Okay. Okay.
And the, what is the conclusion?

1654
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:32,520
Well that there are certain people using
marketing and advertising and computer

1655
01:30:32,521 --> 01:30:37,350
technology, uh, to specifically to
mind control people. And it's very,

1656
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:41,950
very simple to do. Is it mind control?
It's mine. It's mine controlled at,

1657
01:30:41,951 --> 01:30:45,410
at face value when, once you see how
it works, it's just, it's real blade.

1658
01:30:45,411 --> 01:30:48,070
Do you accept the argument though that
marketing is mind control and they're

1659
01:30:48,071 --> 01:30:52,380
getting people obsessed? Socio Jack?
See the thing how mind control works is,

1660
01:30:52,381 --> 01:30:52,591
you know,

1661
01:30:52,591 --> 01:30:56,160
I mentioned this trivium thing earlier
by people not having the trivium.

1662
01:30:56,730 --> 01:31:00,930
That's what enables marketing and public
relations, the polyp political system,

1663
01:31:00,931 --> 01:31:04,050
the last system that we have today,
that's what enables it to work.

1664
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:06,180
That stuff wouldn't be able to function.

1665
01:31:06,330 --> 01:31:08,610
That's why it doesn't work on
any intelligent person. And He,

1666
01:31:08,611 --> 01:31:12,840
no intelligent person watches any nonsense
propaganda on television and buys it

1667
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:17,240
immediately because you've accumulated
a certain amount, like you know,

1668
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:21,120
say if you go out and you study logical
fallacies for 20 minutes and then you go

1669
01:31:21,121 --> 01:31:22,230
study commercials,

1670
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:25,740
you'll see how every commercial
is filled with logical fallacies.

1671
01:31:25,741 --> 01:31:28,470
So once you can identify
those logical fallacies,

1672
01:31:28,471 --> 01:31:32,100
you begin to see how they're using
these lies against you everywhere.

1673
01:31:32,101 --> 01:31:37,100
And then you just block them out. What's
the end game though? And like, well,

1674
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:41,430
the end game is just to learn your own,
your own gain,

1675
01:31:41,431 --> 01:31:44,130
your own autonomy,
your own adulthood.

1676
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:47,490
Really it's to see through the
crap and gain yourself back.

1677
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:50,640
It is important though,
to enjoy life, right?

1678
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:55,320
It is important to do this and to figure
out how to enjoy life. Don't you think?

1679
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:58,830
Oh, I definitely see here, let
me, let me put it to you this way.

1680
01:31:58,870 --> 01:32:01,090
And in ancient Roman times,

1681
01:32:01,330 --> 01:32:05,230
they considered those who had studied
the seven liberal arts is free and those

1682
01:32:05,231 --> 01:32:06,310
who didn't were slaves.

1683
01:32:06,311 --> 01:32:08,860
The slaves were not allowed to
study the seven liberal arts,

1684
01:32:08,861 --> 01:32:13,060
this trivium or quadrivium thing.
As soon as you got free of slavery,

1685
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:16,780
that was the first thing you
did was undertake a study
of the seven liberal arts,

1686
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:17,350
right?

1687
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:22,350
So let's say nobody in our society in
the masses even has that education now.

1688
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:26,530
So we would be considered in
Roman times the slave class. Okay?

1689
01:32:26,531 --> 01:32:30,100
So when you see the word
freedom, literally, uh,

1690
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:34,180
which is what the word liberal is,
is from the Latin word book.

1691
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:37,570
Liebherr and so Liebherr and uh,

1692
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,730
library liberty, these are
really on me Bro, isn't this,

1693
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:45,040
this is what we'll hold on that horizon.
This is where it calls out.

1694
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:48,580
This is where freedom comes from.
So when people learn this stuff,

1695
01:32:48,581 --> 01:32:50,980
this is how they got free.
So you know,

1696
01:32:50,981 --> 01:32:54,270
it's the difference of knowing
that you're a slave free from,

1697
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:57,070
totally agree with you on this.
We're basically,

1698
01:32:57,071 --> 01:33:00,490
this is a very complicated way of saying
that our education system sucks and it

1699
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:02,840
could possibly be set
up that way on purpose.

1700
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:05,780
Don't dumb your audience down too
much, Bro. It's not dumbing them down.

1701
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:10,660
Kind of fill in the voids here. I'm
trying to bring this show back to life.

1702
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:14,940
The idea is that good. And at one
point in time, uh, people were,

1703
01:33:14,941 --> 01:33:18,730
were taught this stuff on a regular
basis and now our education system is no

1704
01:33:18,731 --> 01:33:21,770
longer a pizza, been completely
removed from people's education.

1705
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:24,190
Does that really is on purpose?
Do you think that's it? Oh yeah,

1706
01:33:24,191 --> 01:33:26,650
there's evidence that it was done
on purpose. We don't, and in fact,

1707
01:33:26,651 --> 01:33:30,070
I just saw an article by this woman
Kelly from Canada free press yesterday

1708
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:34,510
talking about, uh, the American, uh,
freedom or the American rebellion,

1709
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,200
uh,

1710
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:40,200
from England was originally
centered around the trivium
and classical education.

1711
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,650
Okay. So when people are in a
school today, you know, when,

1712
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:48,220
when they come up with some sort of a,
a little lesson plan for the year,

1713
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:51,880
is there someone who's actually saying,
hey, we don't want these people smarter.

1714
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:55,230
Let's like dumb shit down and
you can see if you happening.

1715
01:33:55,310 --> 01:33:57,310
Whereas if people want evidence of that,

1716
01:33:57,311 --> 01:33:59,110
they can study Charlotte is or beats book.

1717
01:33:59,111 --> 01:34:01,450
Do you believe this Brian now and as well,

1718
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:04,060
I would suggest people study two people,

1719
01:34:04,061 --> 01:34:08,620
primarily John Taylor Gatto and he's
written a very good book. The America,

1720
01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:13,030
the underground history of underground
history of American education for people

1721
01:34:13,031 --> 01:34:16,720
that read and also Charlotte is or
beats book the dumbing down of America,

1722
01:34:16,990 --> 01:34:21,190
which she also has a lot of primary
documents in her book on the Reese

1723
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:24,700
Commission and how they dictate stuff.
Check it out before you dismiss it.

1724
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:28,060
Let's say those two names. Now they're
under more time. You're freaking people.

1725
01:34:28,061 --> 01:34:32,710
The fuck out people on Twitter right now
is saying this is the most name drops

1726
01:34:32,711 --> 01:34:36,250
anyone has ever had in the podcast.
Please fucking write this shit somewhere.

1727
01:34:36,251 --> 01:34:40,100
I'm freaking out because John
Taylor, Gatto and Charlotte is, or B,

1728
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:42,310
these are the last people's books we're
going to tell people to read because

1729
01:34:42,311 --> 01:34:44,470
otherwise we're going to look like
God damn. University studies go.

1730
01:34:44,471 --> 01:34:48,220
We'll just go onto my website. I've got
a video up on Gatto right on my website.

1731
01:34:48,221 --> 01:34:51,760
They can look at it. They're okay.
They'll do that. Now you, you,

1732
01:34:51,761 --> 01:34:53,020
how long have you been into this?
This,

1733
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:57,800
this studying of psychedelic
chemicals and you know, the between,

1734
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,690
you know, these, uh, these
things and religions and you,

1735
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:02,570
you've been in this for a long ass time,

1736
01:35:02,571 --> 01:35:05,570
but how did you ever get into it to
the point where this is how you make a

1737
01:35:05,571 --> 01:35:06,404
living?

1738
01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:11,810
Well, let's see. I've been in
it at least 20, 22 years or so,

1739
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,490
but, uh, originally I got in at working
with Jack Herer on the California health

1740
01:35:16,491 --> 01:35:20,410
initiative and he was the one who
originally turned me on to a John Allegro,

1741
01:35:20,411 --> 01:35:24,710
his book, the sacred mushroom in
the cross. And, uh, I, you know,

1742
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:27,700
how did you feel like when
you first discovered this
stuff? But I thought, Jack,

1743
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:31,180
the bat shit crazy when he first
told me about it. The same when you,

1744
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,560
when you met us and you thought
we were completely crazy.

1745
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:36,300
I didn't think he was crazy.
I thought, first of all,

1746
01:35:36,301 --> 01:35:39,300
I'd been exposed to a bunch of things
that I never would have thought it existed

1747
01:35:39,301 --> 01:35:43,080
before by that time. So I was already
open to the possibility, like,

1748
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:44,000
who the fuck knows?

1749
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,800
I'm pretty ignorant as to the way the
universe really operates. You know,

1750
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:50,910
just started reading about quantum
physics and you know what I mean?

1751
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:54,060
Like you start reading about things in
super position where a particle is moving

1752
01:35:54,061 --> 01:35:56,670
and not moving and in one place
and another at the same time.

1753
01:35:56,671 --> 01:35:59,580
And like what the fuck is real and
what's not and what does the Observer,

1754
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:02,970
so when then some guy tells you that
he thinks that mushrooms, you know,

1755
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,220
probably shaped religion.
That's not even crazy.

1756
01:36:06,210 --> 01:36:10,140
Where'd you meet Jack and I? A grateful
dead concert or at school actually,

1757
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:14,910
my sister turned me onto his book when
I was probably 18 and then I had met him

1758
01:36:14,911 --> 01:36:17,700
at a hemp rally and December,

1759
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:22,230
2002 I went to his house and we instantly
hit it off and we were friends for 18

1760
01:36:22,231 --> 01:36:25,320
years and I was one of the people
that help bury him in April last year.

1761
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:29,520
Because you, you know, on
your show for sure, you preach
to the converted, you know,

1762
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:31,040
and you have a, a really, uh,

1763
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:36,041
a big following of people who like me
are kind of pretty well versed in this

1764
01:36:36,351 --> 01:36:40,790
subject matter and, and understand a lot
about, you know, psychedelic drugs and,

1765
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:41,961
and you know,
the,

1766
01:36:41,961 --> 01:36:45,080
the relationship they've had to humanity
for thousands and thousands of years.

1767
01:36:45,081 --> 01:36:49,100
But what about the average person once
you run into like some regular square

1768
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:50,760
dude and he,

1769
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,790
so what do you, first of all, he's
got to get by your name. Jaan yeah,

1770
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:59,860
it looks like Jan to me cause it's
way he spells it Scandinavian,

1771
01:36:59,861 --> 01:37:00,401
right?
Yeah,

1772
01:37:00,401 --> 01:37:04,410
he's only English pronounces Jay is just
so it's more like you're yawning like,

1773
01:37:04,450 --> 01:37:07,990
oh, well, you know, you have
Johann or, or something like that.

1774
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:12,220
Viking blood in your past.
I'm primarily a Danish,

1775
01:37:12,221 --> 01:37:17,200
Welsh and Scottish and he viking
in there. Any of those? Possibly.

1776
01:37:17,201 --> 01:37:21,620
Who knows who's a viking? What
was it? What was it? Norway.
Yeah, the Norris. Norris.

1777
01:37:21,621 --> 01:37:25,780
The North men. Right.
Okay. So no viking. Eric.

1778
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:27,783
Hmm.

1779
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,360
But now,
but what is squares do when you,

1780
01:37:29,361 --> 01:37:32,540
you meet some regular dude like in your
neck of the woods and your small town

1781
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:35,300
that you live in and he's like, so what
are your right about there? Yeah. Oh well

1782
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:37,540
I don't, you know, it's interesting.

1783
01:37:37,541 --> 01:37:40,240
I usually don't even talk about
it in my neck of the woods.

1784
01:37:40,241 --> 01:37:43,780
I'm usually so busy with work
and doing my show and you know,

1785
01:37:43,781 --> 01:37:47,260
it takes me two hours to answer all the
emails and I hear from people all the

1786
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:49,060
time to see my work online and Holy Shit,

1787
01:37:49,061 --> 01:37:52,330
I just saw your work and it
completely blew me away. But you know,

1788
01:37:52,331 --> 01:37:56,010
I very rarely have people that
come to me and just say, oh, that's

1789
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,330
completely bat shit crazy.

1790
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:01,290
How often do you communicate about what
you do to someone who is completely

1791
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:02,700
uninitiated? It's, what
I'm trying to say is,

1792
01:38:02,701 --> 01:38:05,180
I have had some
conversations before and uh,

1793
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:09,780
one of them I had on a plane with a doctor
and he was a very intelligent guy and

1794
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:11,730
uh, we, we sat down and you know,

1795
01:38:11,731 --> 01:38:15,060
he was just being real
friendly and started off with
like fear factor questions

1796
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:16,103
and then somebody

1797
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:18,590
start off, you know, with,

1798
01:38:18,591 --> 01:38:21,890
with ancient primary sources and
things like that because you know,

1799
01:38:21,891 --> 01:38:25,130
a doctor's gonna want to cut
straight to the facts. No bullshit.

1800
01:38:25,131 --> 01:38:28,880
So just give him the primary text
says, listen, listen iconography,

1801
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:32,520
listen dude, it's a social
situation. You're having a
drink with a guy on a plane,

1802
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:35,530
you know, breaking things down for them.
You just talking, shooting the shit.

1803
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:41,310
And we broached the subject of first
marijuana and then he was asking you about

1804
01:38:41,311 --> 01:38:44,400
that book, Dmt, the spirit molecule
that was sitting on my table.

1805
01:38:44,401 --> 01:38:45,600
You just mentioned another boat.

1806
01:38:45,601 --> 01:38:48,040
So you have this guy where
you're talking to him.

1807
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:52,320
So he's an intelligent guy that's like
50 years old that has no experience

1808
01:38:52,321 --> 01:38:54,030
whatsoever in anything psychedelic.

1809
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:57,420
And when I started describing the
experience and I started talking about it,

1810
01:38:57,421 --> 01:39:00,150
then he started getting interested and
then he started talking to me about it.

1811
01:39:00,151 --> 01:39:03,630
And then he started writing things down
and he started like taking little notes

1812
01:39:03,631 --> 01:39:06,660
on it and things that he wanted to
investigate. And he asked me, you know,

1813
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:09,030
like where it could get the book,
you know, it was it on a website.

1814
01:39:09,031 --> 01:39:10,170
Can I get it on Amazon?

1815
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:10,451
You know,

1816
01:39:10,451 --> 01:39:14,830
somebody for something that
might be easier for a guy
like that would be like Dr

1817
01:39:14,831 --> 01:39:16,070
Roland Griffiths work.

1818
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:18,030
Oh, he's fucking name
dropping again. This con

1819
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:21,780
Roland Griffiths.

1820
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:22,480
Look sorry.

1821
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:26,830
Is his study silicide been a
religious experience and that was,

1822
01:39:26,831 --> 01:39:30,310
that was all over the news a couple of
years ago. The most recent one. Yeah.

1823
01:39:30,311 --> 01:39:32,170
It's very recent stuff.

1824
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:35,120
Psilocybin and religious experience.
And what's this dude's name again?

1825
01:39:35,121 --> 01:39:38,570
Roland Griffiths. You know, it's, I mean,

1826
01:39:38,571 --> 01:39:42,050
how many fucking more books can come out
about it before they start teaching it

1827
01:39:42,051 --> 01:39:43,430
in mainstream mainstream?

1828
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:46,970
Well, you know what's interesting
is, is, uh, in December,

1829
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,750
Loma Linda University Medical Center,
which is a seventh Adventist, uh,

1830
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:53,240
medical school. And it's considered
one of the best in the world.

1831
01:39:53,241 --> 01:39:56,720
They had me come in and like a Mormon
seven days. No, it's not Mormons,

1832
01:39:56,721 --> 01:39:57,680
but seventh day Adventists.

1833
01:39:57,730 --> 01:40:02,330
They're seventh day Adventists while
there is a Christian group. But uh,

1834
01:40:02,510 --> 01:40:05,480
anyway, they worship on Saturday
and Sunday instead of Saturday.

1835
01:40:05,481 --> 01:40:09,040
The worship on the sabbath
basically. So, uh, this,

1836
01:40:09,041 --> 01:40:13,010
this school had me come into their
pharmacy department and give a two hour

1837
01:40:13,011 --> 01:40:17,630
lecture on the history of the medical
and spiritual applications of psychedelic

1838
01:40:17,631 --> 01:40:18,464
drugs.

1839
01:40:19,570 --> 01:40:20,920
Whoa.
What was that like?

1840
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:22,900
Did you get a lot of hippie
chicks to have the show Montana?

1841
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:28,390
I want to get a piece of that author.
We just have,

1842
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:31,030
I have so many thoughts that
was so similar to yours.

1843
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:35,660
Real freaky. You must get
through. Fortunately the,

1844
01:40:36,650 --> 01:40:40,460
the class was those who were allowed to
participate where the top of the class,

1845
01:40:40,461 --> 01:40:43,310
so they couldn't, uh, you know,
there were, there were no,

1846
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:46,640
anybody who thought that they thought
was going to deviate from the norm of

1847
01:40:46,641 --> 01:40:48,690
society were even allowed
to attend the lecture. Sure.

1848
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:52,440
Wow. Huh. Do you get psychedelic groupies?

1849
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,130
Do you get girls who are like

1850
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:57,120
interested because they're like really?
And decided that Alex,

1851
01:40:57,170 --> 01:40:59,830
there's their colors. Yeah.
There's been some your arms.

1852
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:05,310
He has a beautiful Arra got the same sign
as me. I see you in your documentary.

1853
01:41:06,150 --> 01:41:09,130
How this connection,
the farmer credit inquisition.

1854
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:11,150
I was never in the documentary,

1855
01:41:11,151 --> 01:41:13,970
but they can see me in the one that
you and I were in American drug war.

1856
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,460
Yeah. That was a long ass time ago. Right.

1857
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:20,420
Did they wind up using your,
your footage in that?

1858
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:25,930
Yeah, they use like 15 seconds or 30
seconds or something of it. It's um,

1859
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:28,780
and then, uh, Kevin Booth, he was going
to use a lot more of that later on,

1860
01:41:28,781 --> 01:41:30,180
but I guess never went back to it.

1861
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:34,280
It's w what I was saying is what I was
trying to address by asking you what it's

1862
01:41:34,281 --> 01:41:37,310
like when you talked to her regular
people that don't have any experience in

1863
01:41:37,311 --> 01:41:41,910
this. It's a, it's a very weird subject
to broach all of it. The, the, the,

1864
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,840
the use of psychedelic drugs as
anything more than a party favor.

1865
01:41:44,910 --> 01:41:48,560
But you know what's interesting
is his last April up in San Jose,

1866
01:41:48,561 --> 01:41:49,700
there's a group called maps,

1867
01:41:49,701 --> 01:41:52,190
the Multidisciplinary Association
for Psychedelic Studies.

1868
01:41:52,191 --> 01:41:56,120
They hold a huge conference. It was
the first one in like 35 or 40 years,

1869
01:41:56,121 --> 01:42:01,100
but there was eight or 900 doctors and
professors there at this conference.

1870
01:42:01,101 --> 01:42:03,980
And the whole thing was about the
latest research and psychedelics.

1871
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:08,270
And it's a regular basis, right?
This is, uh, there, there, well they,

1872
01:42:08,271 --> 01:42:11,000
they are planning,
there are different ones,

1873
01:42:11,001 --> 01:42:15,680
but this was the first and the largest
is a national one instead of regionals I

1874
01:42:15,681 --> 01:42:19,370
would have is, well this one was,
it was the largest where they,

1875
01:42:19,371 --> 01:42:23,840
it was like spread out over three days,
uh, almost a hundred presenters. You know,

1876
01:42:23,841 --> 01:42:26,150
literally people come flying
in from all over the world,

1877
01:42:26,151 --> 01:42:27,890
medical professionals
from all over the world,

1878
01:42:27,891 --> 01:42:32,630
experts in psychedelics presenting
on just everything. So, I mean,

1879
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:33,830
you know, the, the, the,

1880
01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:39,350
the psychedelic craze and fear of the
60s is pretty much a over and it's

1881
01:42:39,351 --> 01:42:44,240
becoming a lot more in tune
with the academic side and
with real knowledge about

1882
01:42:44,241 --> 01:42:47,510
psychedelics instead of just the
fear that was put out by the,

1883
01:42:47,511 --> 01:42:51,260
the mass media for the last 40 years.
So you really think there's a shift,

1884
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:53,820
you really think that things are
actually changing? Oh, yeah. Well,

1885
01:42:53,830 --> 01:42:56,300
because it was a recent,
just in the last six or eight months,

1886
01:42:56,301 --> 01:43:00,290
I think maybe it was, uh, October
last year, uh, uh, ecstasy,

1887
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:05,350
Mtma was approved for treating PTSD
and military professionals and a,

1888
01:43:05,451 --> 01:43:10,350
there's pilot studies pilot
treatment studies happening
in, uh, in Colorado. Right.

1889
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:12,550
And how often is that happening now or?
Well,

1890
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:17,540
it's actually giving Mtma to people
that Israel is using it. Uh, there's a,

1891
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:21,950
a couple of other different places that
are already using it for the treatment

1892
01:43:21,951 --> 01:43:26,240
of Ptsd. Uh, right. But is that
actually happening in America? Yes,

1893
01:43:26,241 --> 01:43:30,490
it's happening in Colorado right now. It's
already been approved for use. And, uh,

1894
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:34,160
the one thing that's approved for use in
almost every other country in the world

1895
01:43:34,161 --> 01:43:39,161
is he boga from the Ibogaine
in the treatment of alcoholism
and heroin and opium

1896
01:43:39,801 --> 01:43:42,950
addiction.
And that's got like a 92% success rate.

1897
01:43:42,951 --> 01:43:46,670
But unfortunately the United States is
one of the only countries in the world

1898
01:43:46,671 --> 01:43:51,580
where we're drug addiction
treatment is illegal with, uh,

1899
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:52,490
with Ibogaine.

1900
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:57,660
And a Iowasca is also been shown to
be very effective in the treatment of,

1901
01:43:57,690 --> 01:43:59,900
of alcoholism and opiate addiction.
Yeah.

1902
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:04,010
Yeah. We're held captive what we're held
captive by corrupt politicians. Oh, sure,

1903
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:06,680
sure. Yeah. You know, from
special interest groups and,

1904
01:44:06,681 --> 01:44:07,840
and that's what's wrong with it.
Right?

1905
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:11,640
Yeah. I don't want to drop any names
that people can, if people are,

1906
01:44:11,641 --> 01:44:14,370
if there's any addicts out there
that want more information,

1907
01:44:14,371 --> 01:44:15,350
contact me through my wedding.

1908
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:19,350
You can find Ibogaine research places
in Mexico where they have, I'm sure

1909
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:21,750
Canada or pretty much anywhere in Europe.

1910
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:23,410
I didn't know they haven't been Canada,

1911
01:44:23,411 --> 01:44:26,830
but I know a buddy who was gone to
Mexico several times to do it and he said

1912
01:44:26,831 --> 01:44:29,510
that it's changed his entire life,
changed the way it looks at everything,

1913
01:44:29,511 --> 01:44:33,370
and they made him see himself for who he
really is and abandoned all those false

1914
01:44:33,371 --> 01:44:36,940
patterns of behavior that he had gotten
stuck with and all the false connections

1915
01:44:36,941 --> 01:44:39,160
that he had made in his mind that
we're constantly tripping them up.

1916
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,780
Yeah.
Ibogaine actually blocks the,

1917
01:44:41,810 --> 01:44:44,970
the opiates ability to trigger
those receptors in your body.

1918
01:44:44,971 --> 01:44:49,971
So you come down from this 12 or 24 hour
trip and you are literally not addicted

1919
01:44:50,101 --> 01:44:50,550
anymore.

1920
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:55,550
It cuts that addiction off and now
and at the same time it's like a,

1921
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:58,590
you know the, in Aa when you
have to have the life review it,

1922
01:44:58,620 --> 01:45:02,070
it forces that life
review in that long trip.

1923
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:04,230
So it not only do you get the life review,

1924
01:45:04,231 --> 01:45:07,230
but at the end of the trip it blocks
you from being addicted anymore.

1925
01:45:08,070 --> 01:45:11,580
It's like it's designed to cure
you of any wrong. A dense, yeah.

1926
01:45:11,581 --> 01:45:14,010
And it's an extremely
powerful psychedelic.

1927
01:45:14,011 --> 01:45:19,011
It's been used by the weedy and Africa
for thousands of years and yet it's

1928
01:45:19,171 --> 01:45:20,400
illegal and it's illegal.

1929
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:24,290
The US passed in the
1970 classification that,

1930
01:45:24,291 --> 01:45:27,120
that whole ruling that made all
those different psychedelic drugs,

1931
01:45:28,230 --> 01:45:31,140
was it just lumped into there as I
might say, I'm sure it probably was.

1932
01:45:31,170 --> 01:45:33,660
What's amazing is the ones that didn't
get lumped in there and they didn't know

1933
01:45:33,661 --> 01:45:36,680
about like five methoxy DMT,
the most

1934
01:45:36,910 --> 01:45:38,320
full psychedelic on earth.

1935
01:45:38,321 --> 01:45:43,260
And there is a church operating in the
United States called Toad Tuya de, uh,

1936
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:46,660
that operates using a five
methoxy and dimethyl trip

1937
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:49,600
domains. And this may or may not
have happened. It might be fiction,

1938
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:52,420
but a long time ago,
maybe me and yon did some of that shit.

1939
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:59,050
Maybe, uh, maybe we learned
a lot and we paid him.

1940
01:45:59,051 --> 01:46:02,050
He bought it online.
Maybe we bought it online easy.

1941
01:46:02,350 --> 01:46:04,060
Don't do DMT with Eddie Bravo.

1942
01:46:06,430 --> 01:46:10,190
Yeah, Eddie is, he's
grown as a man since then,

1943
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:12,700
although now he's wearing
me with his love for bunnies

1944
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:18,900
can ever happen to it. Channeling.
He's ready to have a child.

1945
01:46:18,901 --> 01:46:22,520
And so now he's like really into bunnies.
And the loving, loving, small things.

1946
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:26,900
In fact that Eddie Bravo can
make me almost cry now is
amazing about a bunny. No,

1947
01:46:26,901 --> 01:46:29,210
like just when we had
him on that last podcast,

1948
01:46:29,211 --> 01:46:31,730
they was just stick the most on his
sign and everything. I was like damn,

1949
01:46:31,731 --> 01:46:34,220
this is a softer side of Sears.
Yeah.

1950
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:36,360
And then he shut down on
us in the conversation.

1951
01:46:36,361 --> 01:46:39,380
It was like just fucking ended it
hit a wall and just dropped off.

1952
01:46:39,381 --> 01:46:44,150
And then Eddie Saturday with a sad face
and Brian was half asleep. So I'm like,

1953
01:46:44,151 --> 01:46:44,361
Hey,

1954
01:46:44,361 --> 01:46:48,700
is anybody out there like that fucking
show with the guys on the radio trying to

1955
01:46:48,710 --> 01:46:51,050
talk to past sheet.

1956
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:53,250
Remember?
Oh it was in the movie contact.

1957
01:46:53,251 --> 01:46:56,670
Remember she was trying to call
her saddest moment of all time.

1958
01:46:56,671 --> 01:46:59,460
The little girl was trying to call
her dad. Yeah, she almost got to him.

1959
01:46:59,461 --> 01:47:02,090
She couldn't get the medicine to them.
That was pretty solid.

1960
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:05,270
So what am I was trying to get at is do,

1961
01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:09,000
do you ever have any interaction with
regular people who just think you're

1962
01:47:09,001 --> 01:47:12,960
fucking crazy for studying this
stuff? You turn off, do you turn off?

1963
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:16,500
Occasionally you'll have the person who's
never looked at any of the research or

1964
01:47:16,501 --> 01:47:19,740
evidence call up when I'll do a radio
interview view or something all freaked

1965
01:47:19,741 --> 01:47:21,510
out about it.
But you know,

1966
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:26,460
they're telling people to do drugs and I
think what you're doing, it's raw. Yeah,

1967
01:47:26,461 --> 01:47:30,130
you've got, you know, I
mean, you should be manage.

1968
01:47:30,190 --> 01:47:34,080
Me and Johnny Rotten gave you DMT and
look what happened after that, you know?

1969
01:47:34,290 --> 01:47:37,440
Yeah, yeah. Johnny rotten was on
the podcast once we talked about it,

1970
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:40,410
about psychedelic trembling
changes the whole world.

1971
01:47:40,411 --> 01:47:44,520
Because if you go through that and
you, uh, your world doesn't change,

1972
01:47:44,521 --> 01:47:47,280
well then man, you must have known
something already. You must have already,

1973
01:47:47,290 --> 01:47:49,470
I mean, it must be the
smartest person in the world.

1974
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:53,250
How could you not improve radically
multistate consciousness theory.

1975
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:56,400
Mckenna had the best
description of it and his,

1976
01:47:56,401 --> 01:48:01,401
his description was that he looked at
your culture as an operating system and he

1977
01:48:01,651 --> 01:48:06,651
said that there is only one way to
a band in this operating system.

1978
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,410
You have to take something,
a program that, that,

1979
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:13,810
that sort of reprograms your operating
system and you could do it and he hadn't,

1980
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,860
you know, name out all these different
psychedelic compounds and he said,

1981
01:48:16,861 --> 01:48:21,420
or you could do it in DMT form,
which is like a compressed,

1982
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:26,310
you know, 15 minute for him. You know,
it's like taking Shannon's shut file,

1983
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:30,910
you know, and, and uh, unzipping
and into your hard drive, just boom,

1984
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:34,680
you got to change two terabytes
of new information that flying in.

1985
01:48:34,681 --> 01:48:37,410
It was not something
that everybody should do.

1986
01:48:37,411 --> 01:48:39,900
I think some people have a
hard time with regular life.

1987
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:42,810
I think some people have a hard time
with just a fucking getting through life

1988
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:45,370
and it could be a whole host
of things wrong with them.

1989
01:48:45,371 --> 01:48:49,350
That's largely because of
societal conditioning in an,

1990
01:48:49,410 --> 01:48:53,100
in the first place. So, so gets
caught in this catch 22 loop.

1991
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:56,130
It could be medical,
it could be a lot of other things.

1992
01:48:56,131 --> 01:48:58,980
There's some people that have issues
that like just holding on to regular

1993
01:48:58,981 --> 01:49:01,560
reality. So I'm not suggesting
that everybody do it,

1994
01:49:01,561 --> 01:49:04,830
but I'm suggesting that we should
be able to go places and try it.

1995
01:49:04,831 --> 01:49:08,040
If you're a fucking regular person and
you've got your shit together and you

1996
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:09,090
know and you,
you're,

1997
01:49:09,091 --> 01:49:12,480
you're curious about expanding your
mind and your consciousness with these

1998
01:49:12,481 --> 01:49:13,081
experiences,

1999
01:49:13,081 --> 01:49:15,960
there should be a place where we could
go where the government fucking make sure

2000
01:49:15,961 --> 01:49:18,330
this stuff is pure,
they get taxes from it.

2001
01:49:18,450 --> 01:49:21,900
Everybody profits and the society profits
because you're going to have better

2002
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:25,880
though man. I mean it really needs to
go back to just being free. You know,

2003
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:27,360
it should,
okay that would be nice,

2004
01:49:27,361 --> 01:49:30,270
but why not have it where you can make
money off of it and it actually is a

2005
01:49:30,271 --> 01:49:33,510
contributing member to society. Okay.
Because let's go back selling it,

2006
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:37,350
giving people the gold coins and shit
and making, hey man, here's a basket.

2007
01:49:37,351 --> 01:49:38,880
Can I have some eggs?
You know what I mean?

2008
01:49:38,881 --> 01:49:40,500
Like we can go back to bartering things,

2009
01:49:40,501 --> 01:49:43,380
but in the meantime we need God
damn government. You know we need,

2010
01:49:43,590 --> 01:49:45,450
you know what I'm saying? I don't
know. I'm not sure about that.

2011
01:49:45,451 --> 01:49:48,040
There is a committee, the
government out there, there is

2012
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:51,250
a myth of government, some structure.
We need to be able to call the cops.

2013
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:55,000
We need someone who's going to fucking
fix the roads. Roads. We need some shit.

2014
01:49:55,030 --> 01:49:57,760
They say we don't help.

2015
01:49:58,420 --> 01:50:01,580
The problem is is when they say we don't
need any organization is kind of silly.

2016
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:06,520
Well you have to say,
I don't want to give a name call out here,

2017
01:50:06,521 --> 01:50:09,070
but please don't check this
300 million people. Man.

2018
01:50:09,071 --> 01:50:11,830
You need to go to my podcast and
check out this show called the myth of

2019
01:50:11,831 --> 01:50:16,200
government that I did a few weeks ago.
Okay, let's talk about farts. No, no.

2020
01:50:16,750 --> 01:50:19,270
Shut up Brian. Shut up. I just a,

2021
01:50:19,271 --> 01:50:23,110
I think you know Brian's got to keep
it as shallow as possible. Yeah,

2022
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:26,680
that's what he's here for.
Real.

2023
01:50:26,710 --> 01:50:29,830
Let's not get deep at all.
Let's, we got pretty deep dude.

2024
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:33,330
That's deeper than most people.
We can't get scholarly. We can't,

2025
01:50:33,370 --> 01:50:35,380
we can't go drop into a thousand names.

2026
01:50:35,381 --> 01:50:37,780
It's just too confusing for all the
stoners and are in their car right now

2027
01:50:37,781 --> 01:50:40,390
called.
I'm trying to fucking absorb this man.

2028
01:50:41,390 --> 01:50:43,540
But the books names are important.

2029
01:50:43,541 --> 01:50:47,530
So the number one book from John Marco
Allegro is called the sacred mushroom and

2030
01:50:47,531 --> 01:50:48,100
across,

2031
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:51,460
and that is the one we talked about
earlier and Jay Yawns two books that he's

2032
01:50:51,461 --> 01:50:55,000
published are, what was the, uh, the
mushroom one, the Holy Holy Mushrooms,

2033
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:59,470
the most recent one. And
then the one before that is
astro theology in shamanism.

2034
01:50:59,471 --> 01:51:00,730
Christianity's pagan roots.

2035
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:03,430
And that one's really interesting too
because there's so many cool photographs

2036
01:51:03,431 --> 01:51:06,910
in it and you can just really see, yeah,
they both have a lot of photos. Keller,

2037
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:09,940
nobody would have ever believed
that shit was real. Nobody.

2038
01:51:09,941 --> 01:51:12,360
Will you just looking at those
photos and be like, are these mate,

2039
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:14,500
I think making this up?
Like how could this be written?

2040
01:51:14,510 --> 01:51:17,620
And most of them we pulled
from ancient library archives,

2041
01:51:17,650 --> 01:51:19,060
Biblical archives and stuff.

2042
01:51:19,190 --> 01:51:22,400
Are you going to put them in digital form
and any of these books? Because I, I've,

2043
01:51:22,401 --> 01:51:26,680
I've honestly caught my selfie.
Bali mushroom book is available on kindle,

2044
01:51:26,681 --> 01:51:31,681
but because astro theology and shamanism
has like 185 color images and it,

2045
01:51:32,170 --> 01:51:36,550
it was too hard to put it into a,
a clean digital format like Kennel.

2046
01:51:36,551 --> 01:51:38,440
So it's left in book only for

2047
01:51:38,970 --> 01:51:43,020
man. I feel like we should be able
to do that in iPad form or you know,

2048
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:47,680
and I got a couple of copies. I'm yeah,
iPads have that option now. I mean I,

2049
01:51:47,681 --> 01:51:48,514
I've been watching,

2050
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:52,380
not watching but I say watching comic
books on an iPad because it is like a

2051
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:56,760
watching a comic book if you've never
seen it. Well you can get iPad has um,

2052
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:00,060
a bunch of different programs and one
of them is for marvel comics and you buy

2053
01:52:00,061 --> 01:52:03,240
comics and you can watch them
frame by frame, you tap the frame,

2054
01:52:03,241 --> 01:52:06,270
then it goes to the next frame and
then, oh, it's fucking incredible man.

2055
01:52:06,330 --> 01:52:07,163
It's incredible.

2056
01:52:07,260 --> 01:52:10,110
And if they can do that with comic books
and have these high resolution images

2057
01:52:10,111 --> 01:52:10,920
for each one,

2058
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:13,320
I feel like they should be able to
do that with your magazine or your,

2059
01:52:13,330 --> 01:52:17,580
your book rather. Cause they, they do it
with magazines to do with wired magazine.

2060
01:52:17,610 --> 01:52:21,510
Yeah. This is, he's got the marvel
comics one. See how it's set up

2061
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:25,640
instead of you looking at Saturday,
same people from pirating it, those,

2062
01:52:25,641 --> 01:52:30,590
the thing a big, because what it does,
it has to run inside of a program.

2063
01:52:30,591 --> 01:52:35,590
So this comic alone, you can't just
take out and look at it like got to,

2064
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:37,720
you got a keyboard in
your little case studies.

2065
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:41,420
He bitched keyboard you sexy bitch.
You know what you're doing.

2066
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:45,830
And it doesn't even seem much bigger
than a regular iPad with keyboard is

2067
01:52:45,831 --> 01:52:46,130
probably

2068
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:47,120
the right size.
Do you,

2069
01:52:47,121 --> 01:52:49,850
are you considering taking that
with you instead of a laptop? Yeah,

2070
01:52:49,851 --> 01:52:53,360
I've been doing that lately. But
you're living on the edge. It's only,

2071
01:52:53,361 --> 01:52:57,170
I can't work relate too much.
Like I can't run it podcasts on it.

2072
01:52:58,010 --> 01:52:59,930
No disposable media on it.
Right.

2073
01:52:59,931 --> 01:53:02,420
You can't like connect anything is
there a USB knows nothing. Right.

2074
01:53:02,740 --> 01:53:06,380
And connect the USB to it when a hard
drive or anything and you can't use it as

2075
01:53:06,381 --> 01:53:10,130
a hard travel can store things on
the desktop. Internet and games.

2076
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:14,360
I like game boy and a new slate that's
a full on computer. You can edit audio,

2077
01:53:14,361 --> 01:53:16,340
do everything,
all programs

2078
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:19,870
desktop. Why couldn't you create
a new file and put it on desktop?

2079
01:53:19,871 --> 01:53:24,100
Can you do that? I mean it really
depends on what you need to do.

2080
01:53:24,101 --> 01:53:27,430
Like if you want to have like a
document. Yes, there's a word program.

2081
01:53:27,431 --> 01:53:31,390
There's Dropbox, there's you save
them inside the the the IPAD.

2082
01:53:31,391 --> 01:53:32,750
It'll allows you to save things.
Yeah.

2083
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:36,790
It's got a 64 gig hard drive and
really or whatever it is eventually.

2084
01:53:36,791 --> 01:53:38,260
Do you think that's what's
going to be going on?

2085
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,270
If that seems like a small laptop?
I totally feel that.

2086
01:53:40,271 --> 01:53:44,110
Let me feel that it's still kind of
heavy. I tell you, Mac, Mac book, air,

2087
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:46,060
macbook air,
they're about to release a new one.

2088
01:53:46,061 --> 01:53:49,590
I think next week the new macbook
airs are the way to go there.

2089
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:53,650
The price of the macbook air is now
only a thousand dollars or less and and,

2090
01:53:53,710 --> 01:53:55,950
and that they're having a new one
that comes out next week that's,

2091
01:53:55,951 --> 01:54:00,160
it uses this new memory that's going to
be so much faster. Something like that.

2092
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:02,890
I mean for the majority,
unless you're working heavy on the road,

2093
01:54:02,891 --> 01:54:07,150
that right there is better than any iPad
or tablet or anything skipped that wait

2094
01:54:07,151 --> 01:54:07,661
for the new Mac.

2095
01:54:07,661 --> 01:54:11,310
But most people just need to keep up
with whatever technology is on websites.

2096
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:13,450
Right? Yeah. I mean absolutely. It's just,

2097
01:54:13,490 --> 01:54:17,710
it's just basic work usually speaking
to technology, aren't you the dude?

2098
01:54:17,980 --> 01:54:21,190
Didn't you transcribe a gang
of those? Uh, Terence Mckenna

2099
01:54:23,590 --> 01:54:24,340
didn't.
You

2100
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:26,320
did. Right. Cause I remember
when I first met you,

2101
01:54:26,321 --> 01:54:29,470
you were talking about having those
from Siemens can remembers for the last

2102
01:54:29,471 --> 01:54:30,640
seven or eight years,
right.

2103
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:34,750
Have you had to do damage control because
you know as much as he had, right.

2104
01:54:34,751 --> 01:54:39,060
There was a lot of pseudoscience bullshit
in there to really misinformation.

2105
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:40,780
People have criticized
him for a few things.

2106
01:54:40,781 --> 01:54:43,390
What was the main thing that you think
that you could talk about? The 10 well,

2107
01:54:43,391 --> 01:54:48,010
2012 first off, I mean now we know
exactly where the whole theory came from,

2108
01:54:48,011 --> 01:54:52,090
where they developed it. Basically, it
originally started with a in search of,

2109
01:54:52,091 --> 01:54:57,080
and then a hose Eric [inaudible] and
Terence Mckenna picked up on it and they

2110
01:54:57,081 --> 01:55:00,830
spread it until, you know, Daniel
Pinchbeck made it famous based.

2111
01:55:00,831 --> 01:55:02,950
So you're talking about
the Mayan version of two,

2112
01:55:03,010 --> 01:55:08,010
2012 not even Terrence as TimeWave zero
and all of that was launched by Mckenna

2113
01:55:09,761 --> 01:55:13,480
and the in search of program with
Leonard Nimoy and Shit. That was the,

2114
01:55:13,481 --> 01:55:15,820
the the premier episode.
So as your assertion,

2115
01:55:16,270 --> 01:55:17,680
if people are,
people don't know this,

2116
01:55:17,710 --> 01:55:21,730
Terence Mckenna came up with a thing
called TimeWave zero novelty theory. Well,

2117
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:24,700
you know, Terrence, Terrence admitted that
the knowledge, the theory was, hold on,

2118
01:55:24,730 --> 01:55:25,720
hold on.
It's a,

2119
01:55:25,721 --> 01:55:29,020
it's a theory that just as for people who
don't know what the fuck we're talking

2120
01:55:29,021 --> 01:55:32,800
about, all right. It's a theory that
supposedly can track waves and time.

2121
01:55:32,801 --> 01:55:37,000
And the idea is that time is actually
something that you can track with a

2122
01:55:37,001 --> 01:55:41,890
program and that his program was based
on the each ang and that it tracked

2123
01:55:41,891 --> 01:55:45,370
novelty or innovation and inventions and,
and,

2124
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:48,030
and great moments of
change all throughout time.

2125
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:52,980
And that by applying this novelty program,
this algorithm to the past,

2126
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:56,730
he could point out real big spikes
in the curve. That was all bullshit.

2127
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,630
Well, the problem was, and uh,

2128
01:55:58,631 --> 01:56:02,110
there was a guy who came out and
presented a paper called mathematical

2129
01:56:02,111 --> 01:56:05,140
hallucinations, is Watson.
Uh, I don't remember the guys,

2130
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:07,520
the Watson, there was a,
there was a guy named,

2131
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:10,730
I remember it's in my ans book,
but uh,

2132
01:56:11,010 --> 01:56:14,720
came out with a paper mathematical
hallucinations and basically showed that,

2133
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:19,880
you know, what Terrence did was
arbitrarily place the, this,

2134
01:56:19,910 --> 01:56:24,230
the end date. And there is no
way really to match up perfectly.

2135
01:56:24,231 --> 01:56:28,280
He just had to arbitrarily say
December 21st, 2012 and if you look in,

2136
01:56:28,570 --> 01:56:33,400
what was his other options, he could have
said January 30th, 2013 he could sing,

2137
01:56:33,790 --> 01:56:37,190
he could have said
anything because in 1975,

2138
01:56:37,191 --> 01:56:39,950
when the first edition of
invisible landscape came out,

2139
01:56:39,951 --> 01:56:44,180
you can look in the first edition
and there is no, December 21st, 2012,

2140
01:56:44,181 --> 01:56:46,190
it just says 2011 or 2012.

2141
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:50,870
It's in the 1993 edition when he and
Jose are Gwas got together. And, and,

2142
01:56:51,230 --> 01:56:55,610
and both decided on December,
December 21st, 2012 date. But in fact,

2143
01:56:55,611 --> 01:56:57,320
there is no,
there is no even,

2144
01:56:57,530 --> 01:57:00,680
there is no connection to the
Mayan calendar there whatsoever.

2145
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:03,120
Well, there wasn't supposed to be
in my Mckenna Mckenna's defense.

2146
01:57:03,121 --> 01:57:05,520
It took him 25 years to work on this thing

2147
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:09,940
well out himself and admitted that
it was wrong before his death.

2148
01:57:10,030 --> 01:57:13,610
What was wrong about it?
That because of the arbitrary placement,

2149
01:57:13,611 --> 01:57:17,170
and there was a few flaws in the math
that this guy had pointed out in the

2150
01:57:17,171 --> 01:57:20,210
mathematical hallucinations
paper that Mckenna, uh,

2151
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:24,640
stuck to his academic honesty and
relinquished the theory. Well, this is,

2152
01:57:24,641 --> 01:57:26,200
my theory has continued on.

2153
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:29,940
I don't understand because
you're saying that he lied.

2154
01:57:29,970 --> 01:57:32,320
What you're basically saying
is that he knew about that.

2155
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:36,280
Well, I talked to, I talked to his
brother about this, Dennis Mckenna,

2156
01:57:36,281 --> 01:57:39,520
and he's been on my show and he and I
have done a couple shows together as well

2157
01:57:39,521 --> 01:57:40,900
on other places. But, uh,

2158
01:57:41,770 --> 01:57:46,770
what he said was that basically the
theory got so popular so quickly that

2159
01:57:47,351 --> 01:57:52,060
Terrence basically just let it
run the theory, the, the, the,

2160
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:57,180
the novelty and the end date that the
entire theory is based on the appeal to

2161
01:57:57,821 --> 01:58:00,190
novelty, which is a logical
fallacy in and of itself.

2162
01:58:00,250 --> 01:58:01,750
What about the theory?
I mean,

2163
01:58:01,751 --> 01:58:04,840
what about the end day coinciding with
the end of the long count of the Mayan

2164
01:58:04,841 --> 01:58:05,674
calendar?

2165
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:07,030
Well,
there is no,

2166
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:12,240
see there's only one monument in that
we know of its monuments six that even

2167
01:58:13,571 --> 01:58:15,700
discusses December 21st,

2168
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:19,810
2012 and the only thing that it
says is that a king will be robed.

2169
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:24,790
That is it. Anything else that's
applied about December 21st,

2170
01:58:24,790 --> 01:58:27,340
2012 beyond that has been
made up and embellish.

2171
01:58:27,341 --> 01:58:30,430
So it might be that prince dude from
England just goes to get a new suit.

2172
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:34,240
I am betting my money on.
So you know,

2173
01:58:34,241 --> 01:58:36,550
so anybody who says that
it's the end of the world,

2174
01:58:36,551 --> 01:58:39,430
that they can trace this to the Mayan
calendar, all of that stuff has made up.

2175
01:58:39,431 --> 01:58:42,140
The only thing,
the only that we have is a king

2176
01:58:42,140 --> 01:58:44,260
will be robed. Oh really?
That's amazing. That's it.

2177
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:47,740
What about the end of the long count,
isn't it the end of the long count?

2178
01:58:49,980 --> 01:58:54,720
December 31st and January 1st it's
about, you know, that, you know,

2179
01:58:54,721 --> 01:58:58,080
I mean there may be a planetary alignment,
but you know,

2180
01:58:58,081 --> 01:59:01,350
do the polls shift and does the end of
the world happen and all of this stuff.

2181
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:02,730
I mean people,
you know,

2182
01:59:02,731 --> 01:59:06,220
wake up in the morning and get
ready for work and you know,

2183
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:09,570
take a shower and all that shit
like you usually do on December 20th

2184
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:13,120
second pinch back says that we should be
in the woods and we should make our own

2185
01:59:13,121 --> 01:59:14,140
money. Right. Well,

2186
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:19,200
Daniel Pinchbeck charges $325 a ticket
for 22 2012 conferences as well.

2187
01:59:19,590 --> 01:59:23,110
He really, yeah. Really?
Wow. What a genius.

2188
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:26,320
He asked me to do one in like Utah.
Yeah.

2189
01:59:26,370 --> 01:59:30,320
Well go to you all the power to them. You
know, I know professor John Hops, who's,

2190
01:59:30,321 --> 01:59:35,100
uh, who's an expert in Maya's studies
and he sent pinch back a whole bunch of

2191
01:59:35,101 --> 01:59:38,380
information when he was writing that book,
showing that pinch,

2192
01:59:38,390 --> 01:59:41,280
his whole theory was completely
bogus. You know, not only that,

2193
01:59:41,281 --> 01:59:45,330
but Pinchbeck is using an Aztec God kits,
a Quadel to tech talk about, uh, uh,

2194
01:59:45,331 --> 01:59:46,290
Maya calendar.

2195
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:51,320
What is an Aztec God dealing with the
Maya calendar and why would he come down

2196
01:59:52,171 --> 01:59:56,940
and come to Daniel Pinchbeck this
New Yorker, white guy to, you know,

2197
01:59:56,941 --> 02:00:01,390
to reveal 2012 to the
world, right? [inaudible]

2198
02:00:01,850 --> 02:00:03,620
wait a minute, wait a minute.
You say, wait a minute.

2199
02:00:03,890 --> 02:00:07,100
He actually says that this thing came
down and revealed it to him. Yeah.

2200
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:09,020
Quadel and Aztec,

2201
02:00:09,021 --> 02:00:13,730
God came to him and told him about
a Mayan calendar and the 2012 thing,

2202
02:00:14,030 --> 02:00:15,640
the end of the community's
needs. So, you know,

2203
02:00:15,650 --> 02:00:18,890
I remember when I said about arguing
the arbitrary or earlier when you don't

2204
02:00:18,891 --> 02:00:21,680
have any evidence of anything, it's
bullshit and you throw it out. Well,

2205
02:00:21,681 --> 02:00:22,700
this is when you take,

2206
02:00:22,701 --> 02:00:26,960
are arguing the arbitrary and you make a
fucking shit load of money on. Exactly.

2207
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:31,260
Okay. But this guy, he, I did
not know that he did this.
So he, I've met him before.

2208
02:00:31,261 --> 02:00:34,760
He seemed like a very nice conversation
with them out in my backyard. Well,

2209
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:36,150
are we talked about at
the end of the world?

2210
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:40,010
I think that's what he rocks with what?
I wanted to get them on the podcast,

2211
02:00:40,011 --> 02:00:42,540
see if I can get them high and
just dug about life, you know,

2212
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:45,060
find out what makes you
tick, dude. Um, but,

2213
02:00:45,330 --> 02:00:48,810
so you're saying that it's all bullshit.
So you're saying that he's just,

2214
02:00:49,310 --> 02:00:53,010
there's no correlation to the Maya
calendar and you're saying it like it says

2215
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:59,200
God Catsa Quadel was it a dream? That's
the story is a trip or whatever. Right.

2216
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:03,200
Okay. And so, and so there's an Aztec
God telling him about a Maya calendar.

2217
02:01:03,201 --> 02:01:06,320
We're talking about two different
cultures, two different religions,

2218
02:01:06,321 --> 02:01:07,430
two different calendars.

2219
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:11,360
The Maya didn't celebrate quests.
It's like, it's like, you know,

2220
02:01:11,361 --> 02:01:14,920
Jesus came to me in this vision and told
me to teach the world about the Mayan

2221
02:01:14,921 --> 02:01:17,470
calendar. Right. Same ridiculousness.

2222
02:01:18,370 --> 02:01:22,090
The Mayans didn't study quinto Quarto
or they didn't have a quite so Quadel

2223
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:26,790
well, they have their own deities
in their own college model.

2224
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:30,630
It's not, no, it's not called
Catsa. Quadel. That's an
asset. That's an asset. God.

2225
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:35,620
Hmm. So that snake, the plumed
serpent from the Maya, what is that?

2226
02:01:35,730 --> 02:01:39,840
What's that called? Oh, let me see. Oh,

2227
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:41,023
thank you.
Right.

2228
02:01:42,410 --> 02:01:45,270
I don't, I'm not recalling the
name off the top of my head. Okay,

2229
02:01:45,271 --> 02:01:49,860
so you're basically saying pinch and
shit though. Yes. Wow. Strong words.

2230
02:01:50,190 --> 02:01:54,040
You heard a Pinchbeck. It's time to come
on the podcast for counterpoint point.

2231
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:56,520
Counterpoint in there and
have him address publicly.

2232
02:01:56,521 --> 02:02:01,521
All of John Hubs is points that ups has
been publishing the entire regions of

2233
02:02:01,531 --> 02:02:04,350
2012. He's published it three,
uh, two times on my show,

2234
02:02:04,351 --> 02:02:06,180
but he's also coming out with
a book on the whole thing.

2235
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:11,560
I watched a fascinating show on them
trying to figure out how to decode Mayan

2236
02:02:12,021 --> 02:02:14,750
language because what Mayan language,
like each,

2237
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:19,430
each little symbol like will
like you will say things like,

2238
02:02:19,431 --> 02:02:21,290
you will see things like
Mckenna described it.

2239
02:02:21,291 --> 02:02:26,291
Like if you had an eyeball and a
saw and an aunt insect and a rose,

2240
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:30,710
I saw aunt rose. That's how you
would say I saw aunt rose. Right?

2241
02:02:30,711 --> 02:02:32,810
You'd have to do it like
that. Like it's, it's,

2242
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:35,420
it's incredibly difficult to decipher,

2243
02:02:35,570 --> 02:02:40,130
but a fascinating documentary about these
scientists and archeologists trying to

2244
02:02:40,131 --> 02:02:43,340
break it down and figuring out what the
fuck everything means and how long it

2245
02:02:43,341 --> 02:02:47,930
took and all these breakthroughs that
they can go wrong to all sorts of things

2246
02:02:47,931 --> 02:02:50,360
that are being thrown. What's so
difficult to decipher? It's like,

2247
02:02:50,510 --> 02:02:51,950
and I was going to ask you
this because I've seen,

2248
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:54,920
I saw this in a park and not a podcast,
a documentary once,

2249
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:57,620
but I an Ari agreed that
it's probably correct,

2250
02:02:57,770 --> 02:03:02,000
but I haven't been able to break it
down with anybody who really knows a lot

2251
02:03:02,001 --> 02:03:04,790
about ancient, the ancient Bible
and the ancient Hebrew Bible.

2252
02:03:05,270 --> 02:03:07,670
The ancient Hebrew Bible, uh, was all,

2253
02:03:07,730 --> 02:03:10,010
that was not the earliest
version of the Bible.

2254
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:13,400
The earlier versions of the Bible
where the sacred would, uh, was,

2255
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:14,680
was the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Right?

2256
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:16,591
Well,

2257
02:03:16,591 --> 02:03:21,591
the Dead Sea scrolls were probably written
from the second century BCE to about

2258
02:03:24,181 --> 02:03:25,720
67,
80.

2259
02:03:27,060 --> 02:03:29,760
Original Torah would've been written,

2260
02:03:29,761 --> 02:03:34,130
like genesis was probably
written about five 86 BCE.

2261
02:03:35,070 --> 02:03:38,040
So the Torah with, you know,
certain aspects of the Torah,

2262
02:03:38,041 --> 02:03:40,890
which we don't have an original
copy that's that old, but, uh,

2263
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:45,330
would technically be older than certain
sections of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

2264
02:03:45,331 --> 02:03:49,350
But there is a lot of, you know,
identical copies of, of, uh,

2265
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:51,780
original Hebrew texts
in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

2266
02:03:52,050 --> 02:03:54,380
And the Dead Sea scrolls were
written in Aramaic. Right.

2267
02:03:54,390 --> 02:03:58,080
Which they're written in Aramaic
and it's on animal skins. Right. Uh,

2268
02:03:58,650 --> 02:04:03,390
mostly most of it's on par parchment.
Some of it was on a pirates.

2269
02:04:03,391 --> 02:04:06,030
And then, uh, then there was
the copper scroll as well,

2270
02:04:06,390 --> 02:04:08,820
but there was someone animal skins.
Yeah, most of it was parchment,

2271
02:04:08,821 --> 02:04:12,540
which is lamb skin. Yeah. Oh, wow.
That's what Parchman is. Right.

2272
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:18,580
Wow. I thought it was a type of
paper. I have no idea. Right. Wow.

2273
02:04:18,581 --> 02:04:21,640
And so that was one of the things that
I read that they were trying to match up

2274
02:04:22,180 --> 02:04:27,160
different pieces of the Dead Sea Scrolls
by using DNA so that the parchment came

2275
02:04:27,161 --> 02:04:30,910
from the same cow matching
the DNA of the fucking,

2276
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:35,680
the shit they were writing on.
Try to figure out what pile this pile is.

2277
02:04:35,681 --> 02:04:38,820
All this one animal. Let's figure
out if this was the same scroll.

2278
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:40,470
Fucking incredible Mami.
Thank you.

2279
02:04:40,530 --> 02:04:42,510
That is a,
that is a brilliant idea.

2280
02:04:43,330 --> 02:04:44,170
Did you,
um,

2281
02:04:44,230 --> 02:04:47,110
have you ever seen this shit that's
going on now in Turkey where they're

2282
02:04:47,111 --> 02:04:50,630
unveiling that that temple that was,
it was on the front page of a,

2283
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:54,080
of a life magazine recently
or not in life? Um,

2284
02:04:54,230 --> 02:04:58,990
so it's the yellow and
national geographic. It's a
go go Beckley Tepi that uh,

2285
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:02,470
it completely predates by a huge chunk.

2286
02:05:02,471 --> 02:05:07,090
Anything that they thought people were
doing 12,000 years ago or earlier.

2287
02:05:07,450 --> 02:05:11,380
It's um, you know, the earliest known
human civilizations, Mesopotamia.

2288
02:05:11,381 --> 02:05:12,670
It's like Babylon in Iraq.

2289
02:05:12,750 --> 02:05:16,070
Interesting. No, I recall hearing
something about it, but I haven't studied.

2290
02:05:16,170 --> 02:05:19,760
They found this is these temples in
Turkey and there they've been, uh,

2291
02:05:20,070 --> 02:05:22,590
unearthing I'm there trying to like
decipher them and figure out what the fuck

2292
02:05:22,591 --> 02:05:23,130
it is.

2293
02:05:23,130 --> 02:05:26,010
This is back when they thought people
were nothing but straight hunter gatherers

2294
02:05:26,011 --> 02:05:27,410
just roaming around like animals.

2295
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:28,021
Well we're,

2296
02:05:28,021 --> 02:05:33,021
we're finding out more and more often
that civilization is probably 10 or 15,000

2297
02:05:33,901 --> 02:05:36,870
years older than most previously believed.

2298
02:05:37,110 --> 02:05:39,600
And a lot of those early civilizations,

2299
02:05:39,601 --> 02:05:43,710
they had evidence of cattle worship
and evidence of psychedelic mushrooms.

2300
02:05:43,730 --> 02:05:46,420
Marsha, right? Cows and
mushrooms go hand in hand. Yeah.

2301
02:05:46,580 --> 02:05:51,320
Like that one. Um, one of the earliest
ones. What was it? Um, uh, God,

2302
02:05:52,050 --> 02:05:53,990
chuck,
how do you say I'd Tuck Tuck Holyoke.

2303
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:57,880
Yeah, I know what you're and
cut the line or whatever.

2304
02:05:58,210 --> 02:06:00,620
However you say it looks weird
when it's written it down. Right?

2305
02:06:00,730 --> 02:06:03,010
But it's all cows and shit.
They're worshiping counts.

2306
02:06:03,190 --> 02:06:05,760
I guess you would worship cast cause
they keep you alive because they eat them

2307
02:06:05,761 --> 02:06:06,340
and that

2308
02:06:06,340 --> 02:06:09,450
and then they poop. And then these,
these things that give you religious, uh,

2309
02:06:09,451 --> 02:06:11,430
inspiration come out of the poop.

2310
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:12,030
Yeah.

2311
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:16,020
That's the amazing part of it is that
most likely that's responsible for why

2312
02:06:16,021 --> 02:06:18,210
Hindus are so fascinated
by cows and they love it.

2313
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:21,380
Oh, sure. And don't want to ever even take
that into consideration. Now, you know,

2314
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:24,730
and there's more than a hundred a
hundred psychedelic psychoactive plants

2315
02:06:24,731 --> 02:06:29,680
dedicated to Shiva alone.
Yeah. But, uh, you know, the
Hindus still use bang or bond,

2316
02:06:29,681 --> 02:06:34,681
which is marijuana and Soma was argued
by Gordon Wasson to be a am Anita

2317
02:06:35,030 --> 02:06:35,670
miscarried,

2318
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:39,490
the red and white spotted mushroom that
you see in all the fairy tales and note

2319
02:06:39,491 --> 02:06:42,370
with gnomes and dwarves and,
and Mario brothers and shit like that.

2320
02:06:42,430 --> 02:06:46,900
And there's so much ancient Hindu art.
It shows people holding up mushrooms,

2321
02:06:47,290 --> 02:06:50,800
mushrooms and mushrooms coming out of
their heads and all this stuff. You know,

2322
02:06:50,801 --> 02:06:54,640
just like we've got for, for
ancient Christian, uh, uh, artwork.

2323
02:06:54,910 --> 02:06:56,560
There's a lot of that stuff out there.

2324
02:06:57,240 --> 02:07:00,960
It's amazing that you have to hear about
this from the podcast of a comedian.

2325
02:07:01,940 --> 02:07:05,640
You know, you know, hearing about
this on CNN, they won't discuss this.

2326
02:07:05,641 --> 02:07:09,480
They wouldn't allow you to come on and
have a two hour uncensored conversation

2327
02:07:09,481 --> 02:07:13,380
about the origin. No kidding. Yeah, it's,
it's, it's a weird world that we live in,

2328
02:07:13,381 --> 02:07:16,860
man. It's a weird world that we have
this incredible access to information,

2329
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:20,580
but yet we're still filtered or
filtered pretty fucking heavily.

2330
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:24,000
It starting to change though.
They're really starting to change.

2331
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:25,290
It blows me away too.

2332
02:07:25,291 --> 02:07:29,190
How many academics and researchers
are out there all over the world and

2333
02:07:29,191 --> 02:07:33,180
universities working on this stuff and
there's academics all over the place that

2334
02:07:33,181 --> 02:07:34,920
know about it. But, uh, you know,

2335
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:38,780
the mainstream public is
completely unaware of it

2336
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:40,060
for the longest time,

2337
02:07:40,061 --> 02:07:45,061
for any academic using even the term
psychedelics as a subject of serious

2338
02:07:45,281 --> 02:07:47,530
research, you know, you got all,
I'm looking into psychedelics,

2339
02:07:47,531 --> 02:07:51,230
so what the fuck are you wasting
your career on, man? You know,

2340
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:56,730
the leary and the, the bad connotation
that he left a psychedelics. Yes. Yeah.

2341
02:07:57,120 --> 02:07:57,571
But you know,

2342
02:07:57,571 --> 02:08:01,920
it's interesting that time life or
that Time magazine actually had more

2343
02:08:01,921 --> 02:08:04,890
influence and popularizing LSD
then Tim leary had in time,

2344
02:08:04,900 --> 02:08:08,040
life was being run by skull and bones.

2345
02:08:08,930 --> 02:08:12,620
Huh? What did, how did time life
have more? Just the stories? Yeah.

2346
02:08:12,910 --> 02:08:16,390
Well, the Henry Luce who is the
president of timeline, if he, you know,

2347
02:08:16,391 --> 02:08:19,620
he's even his wife,
Clare Booth Luce is even closed.

2348
02:08:19,630 --> 02:08:23,860
Quoted as saying that she and her husband
had more to do with popularizing LSD

2349
02:08:23,861 --> 02:08:26,800
then Tim leary ever did
on purpose. Oh yeah. Wow.

2350
02:08:26,820 --> 02:08:30,790
There they had done it and they
were, they were, they were in on the,

2351
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:31,750
on it from the top,

2352
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:36,040
but Timothy leary was the spokesperson
because he was a guy like, holy shit,

2353
02:08:36,041 --> 02:08:37,770
this guy's a harder,
he was the one that they

2354
02:08:37,870 --> 02:08:39,760
put up front as the spokesperson.

2355
02:08:39,761 --> 02:08:42,100
He was the one that Kinda
just went hog wild with it.

2356
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:46,100
Was he responsible in any way
for the Ted Kaczynski thing?

2357
02:08:46,770 --> 02:08:47,970
That's an interesting question.

2358
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,920
I would have to go to a were
Ted Kaczynski is locked up and

2359
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:54,890
ask him myself, you know? Yeah.

2360
02:08:55,610 --> 02:08:58,430
That would be an interesting guy
to do an interview with. Right.

2361
02:09:00,350 --> 02:09:02,030
People wouldn't be angry.
You know,

2362
02:09:02,031 --> 02:09:03,980
it's like when someone's
killed a member of your family,

2363
02:09:03,981 --> 02:09:06,360
you don't want that person
being glorified as you know.

2364
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:10,310
Perhaps I misunderstood the fuck
happened. And who, who gave you the LSD?

2365
02:09:10,311 --> 02:09:13,130
What was behind the program? Let's
think. Let's get down to the meat.

2366
02:09:13,131 --> 02:09:14,690
Tell us what really happened there.

2367
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:18,770
Isn't it incredible that he really
is like a true, I mean it's possible.

2368
02:09:18,771 --> 02:09:21,950
We don't know whether or not that's
what caused him, but it's possible.

2369
02:09:21,951 --> 02:09:26,360
It's a very strong possibility that he
really has some real Manchurian candidate

2370
02:09:26,420 --> 02:09:30,620
Kennedy type of a dude. He really is
something guy that they, you know, they,

2371
02:09:30,621 --> 02:09:34,730
they did some shit to him. Not as
my AdvaMed is that, you know what?

2372
02:09:34,740 --> 02:09:38,830
I think he might've been more
brilliant than that. But yeah, I don't,

2373
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:42,680
I mean the idea that someone
could be changed and then
become a killer, you know,

2374
02:09:42,681 --> 02:09:45,740
and that literally it can be done not in
miniature and candidate was like he was,

2375
02:09:46,010 --> 02:09:46,381
what did they,

2376
02:09:46,381 --> 02:09:49,100
you have to come up to him
and say something to him
and he fucking snaps or some

2377
02:09:49,101 --> 02:09:50,930
silliness like that.
But I think the,

2378
02:09:50,940 --> 02:09:55,570
in the case of Kandinsky that they
might have fried disguise circuit point.

2379
02:09:55,730 --> 02:09:58,070
This is the,
but I don't think it was planned.

2380
02:09:58,230 --> 02:10:03,230
Did all the unibomber shit 20 or 25
years after these LSD experiments.

2381
02:10:03,661 --> 02:10:05,580
You know, he was a really, oh yeah.

2382
02:10:05,581 --> 02:10:09,560
You know that those experiments were
in the what, the 50s or 60s and a,

2383
02:10:09,570 --> 02:10:13,080
he was professor of math up until
mid nineties up at Berkeley.

2384
02:10:13,370 --> 02:10:16,130
Really? So when, um, didn't need what?

2385
02:10:16,131 --> 02:10:18,710
I thought it was only a professor for
a few years, but I don't think so.

2386
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:21,650
Check double check me. Do it. Pretty
sure I do a wiki search. In fact,

2387
02:10:21,651 --> 02:10:24,950
check me shit.
This is going to take too much time,

2388
02:10:24,970 --> 02:10:29,150
but let's just say then just the net
is a very fascinating documentary.

2389
02:10:29,151 --> 02:10:32,000
If you want to watch it, it is a from
another country, I'm not sure which show.

2390
02:10:32,001 --> 02:10:34,220
It's all in subtitles. And
you know, there's another

2391
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:37,610
really good documentary that people should
check out is called the crazy rulers

2392
02:10:37,611 --> 02:10:39,700
of the world. It's a that they, the,

2393
02:10:39,720 --> 02:10:44,060
the movie the Hollywood movie men who
stare at goats is based off of the film.

2394
02:10:44,061 --> 02:10:47,930
Crazy rulers of the world. Check out
that one and the net back to back.

2395
02:10:47,980 --> 02:10:52,010
It'll give you some really
interesting insights.

2396
02:10:52,340 --> 02:10:53,540
Information on us.

2397
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:56,930
Intelligence and psychedelics do is too
much information out there and I don't

2398
02:10:56,931 --> 02:11:00,710
want some of it in my head yonder oven.
I don't touch shit.

2399
02:11:00,711 --> 02:11:03,050
Let you get into it then.

2400
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:06,080
Don't you think though that a certain
point in time it's like God dammit.

2401
02:11:06,380 --> 02:11:10,100
You're like, no, no, no.

2402
02:11:10,101 --> 02:11:14,000
But I'm saying dig so deep into the
rabbit hole and he's like, fuck,

2403
02:11:14,001 --> 02:11:15,410
I can never like live a real life.

2404
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:19,790
Now I'm always looking for a skull and
crossbones and secret societies and

2405
02:11:19,791 --> 02:11:23,520
fucking anybody can look in an
old dictionary and see that uh,

2406
02:11:23,580 --> 02:11:27,730
the Illuminati in skull and bones and shit
is real. I mean pull up, pull out, uh,

2407
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:33,020
a 1911 dictionary and that Shit's
right there. Nobody disputes. Oh, sure.

2408
02:11:33,021 --> 02:11:35,520
I hear people. Oh, the Illuminati
conspiracy. But that's shit.

2409
02:11:35,521 --> 02:11:37,190
It's totally approved.
That's not what I'm saying.

2410
02:11:37,310 --> 02:11:39,950
What I'm saying is it has ever get to
a point in time where you're just like,

2411
02:11:40,010 --> 02:11:43,220
you're, you're so absorbed in all the
shit that you can enjoy regular life.

2412
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:47,720
Not really. I mean I, I'm
fascinated by this research.

2413
02:11:47,721 --> 02:11:50,240
That's why I do it in the first
place. It's a passion. Right.

2414
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:53,780
And wouldn't do it if I wasn't fascinated
by it. Yeah. And it's, but you're,

2415
02:11:53,781 --> 02:11:58,781
your research is all like exposing all
kinds of crazy shit that the government

2416
02:11:59,571 --> 02:12:01,080
is up to.
I mean,

2417
02:12:01,081 --> 02:12:05,300
it's like founding the founding father
of the whole field of psychedelics was

2418
02:12:05,301 --> 02:12:07,760
the chairman for the council
on Foreign Relations. I mean,

2419
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:12,590
when that shit goes public out there in
our field, it's going to be explosive.

2420
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:16,790
I mean, you know, that's taking away
their guy who was the founding father,

2421
02:12:16,791 --> 02:12:17,740
but I can show that he,

2422
02:12:17,790 --> 02:12:22,730
he stole many of his ideas from this
other researcher who came 70 years before

2423
02:12:22,731 --> 02:12:26,990
him and the 1890s. And uh, but you know,
there's a whole big there. You know,

2424
02:12:26,991 --> 02:12:31,460
there's, there's scandal on top of scandal
on top of intelligence, CIA bullshit.

2425
02:12:31,590 --> 02:12:34,700
And does it ever get to a point where
you're like overwhelmed by this shit when

2426
02:12:34,701 --> 02:12:37,400
you just want to just take a deep breath?

2427
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:41,090
Do you have your phone shit on silly boy,
you know, every once in a while. Sure.

2428
02:12:41,091 --> 02:12:45,860
But, uh, you know, usually when I get
into and find all the more crazy shit,

2429
02:12:45,861 --> 02:12:47,420
it's like, Aha, here's another book.

2430
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:51,590
Write another book for you to write or
to read or to write. Oh, well, okay.

2431
02:12:52,020 --> 02:12:54,310
In that sense, man, it
totally makes sense. What,

2432
02:12:54,360 --> 02:12:58,820
what the fuck can be done in closing?
What can be done? How can, how can people,

2433
02:12:59,010 --> 02:13:02,240
um, do something about this
situation that we're in,

2434
02:13:02,241 --> 02:13:06,260
that's been here since you and I were
children and that he is here now that we

2435
02:13:06,261 --> 02:13:09,350
have the best, the best thing
that people can do, in my opinion,

2436
02:13:09,410 --> 02:13:13,220
that is the real solution is pick up
the trivium pickup critical thinking,

2437
02:13:13,221 --> 02:13:15,440
grammar, logic and rhetoric.
That is the best way.

2438
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:19,340
It's like installing a mental antivirus
system into your brain so that you know,

2439
02:13:19,341 --> 02:13:21,080
suddenly it's like taking the red pill.

2440
02:13:21,081 --> 02:13:23,380
All of a sudden the green lines are
coming down the screen. You see,

2441
02:13:23,390 --> 02:13:26,810
you got to write a book about this.
Um, we've, we've talked about it.

2442
02:13:26,811 --> 02:13:28,640
A friend of mine is already
writing a book on it.

2443
02:13:28,641 --> 02:13:33,641
We've done a number of documentaries
on the trivia run trivium education.com

2444
02:13:33,990 --> 02:13:37,050
website that people can check out and
run this. I run that website. Yeah.

2445
02:13:37,051 --> 02:13:38,430
So people can check that out.
There's,

2446
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:41,220
there's videos and stuff up there
that people can check out on it.

2447
02:13:41,550 --> 02:13:44,820
But I would say that that's
the most important thing
because once you have that,

2448
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:47,870
you can see all the other bullshit
going on it teeth, you know you,

2449
02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:49,380
it doesn't teach you what to think.

2450
02:13:49,381 --> 02:13:51,810
It teaches you how to think
and how to see through all that

2451
02:13:51,850 --> 02:13:54,940
bullshit. That's nice for the people
that are going to pay attention,

2452
02:13:54,941 --> 02:13:57,250
but what kind of a strategy,
if any,

2453
02:13:57,280 --> 02:14:01,480
is possible for letting people
know about psychedelics,

2454
02:14:01,510 --> 02:14:05,200
letting people know about the benefits
and positives of these things that have

2455
02:14:05,201 --> 02:14:06,700
really been held back from people.

2456
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:10,060
One of the things that Mckenna said that
always stuck with me is that living a

2457
02:14:10,061 --> 02:14:14,260
life and going birth to the grave with
like without psychedelics to me is like

2458
02:14:14,261 --> 02:14:17,560
living a life and going birth to
the grave without ever having sex.

2459
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:18,590
I would agree with that,

2460
02:14:18,591 --> 02:14:23,030
but the problem with just
doing psychedelics with how
critical thinking is that

2461
02:14:23,031 --> 02:14:27,440
when somebody breaks free
of their religious paradigm
or the new age paradigms

2462
02:14:27,441 --> 02:14:32,210
that are just as much mine control out
there as anything else. The problem is,

2463
02:14:32,211 --> 02:14:35,780
is if they do psychedelics alone,
they're easily manipulated.

2464
02:14:36,170 --> 02:14:37,670
And so I disagree with,

2465
02:14:37,940 --> 02:14:40,760
with Mckenna and Larry's theory
that everybody should just take it.

2466
02:14:40,761 --> 02:14:44,450
I think that people should be given the
proper tools of critical thinking and

2467
02:14:44,451 --> 02:14:47,300
then take the psychedelics and
then they really break free.

2468
02:14:47,470 --> 02:14:51,820
Basically we have to start our
own cult slash educational center.

2469
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:53,300
Oh, we don't need it.
When do we need to do,

2470
02:14:53,330 --> 02:14:56,900
that's the nice thing about the trivium
is that it prevents people from buying

2471
02:14:56,901 --> 02:14:57,790
into religious creek.

2472
02:14:57,990 --> 02:15:00,620
Clearly not serious,
but if we had it called,

2473
02:15:00,630 --> 02:15:04,830
where would we rock this shit salt
and see Brian Canoga Park Canoga Park.

2474
02:15:05,010 --> 02:15:06,750
It's really close by.
It'd be much more convenient.

2475
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:12,840
There's no lesson exposing people to
this information is probably step one.

2476
02:15:12,841 --> 02:15:16,410
There's a bunch of people that are
growing up now that are in high school and

2477
02:15:16,411 --> 02:15:19,830
college that are reading these types of
books and listening to these types of

2478
02:15:19,831 --> 02:15:22,530
conversations that we're having on this
podcast and researching this type of

2479
02:15:22,531 --> 02:15:27,180
information. And uh, just having this
stuff, being a part of public discourse,

2480
02:15:27,590 --> 02:15:29,760
it allows people to know it's out there.

2481
02:15:29,761 --> 02:15:32,370
And it allows people to start thinking
about things and a little bit of a

2482
02:15:32,371 --> 02:15:35,730
different way, you know, we're all
programmed in one way or another,

2483
02:15:35,731 --> 02:15:36,990
whether we like it or not,
you know,

2484
02:15:36,991 --> 02:15:41,150
we're programmed by our experiences were
programmed by our environment and um,

2485
02:15:41,190 --> 02:15:44,970
it's not always necessarily for your own
good to follow that fucking programming.

2486
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:46,470
Right.
Indeed.

2487
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:49,650
And so Jaan thank you very much for
coming on the show and thank you for your

2488
02:15:49,651 --> 02:15:52,830
books man. And thank you for republishing
the Sacred Mushroom that cross.

2489
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:57,090
And if people want to buy your books,
they're all available on amazon.com right?

2490
02:15:57,380 --> 02:16:01,650
Uh, yes, there is that where it, is there
some hippy fucking thing about Amazon?

2491
02:16:01,651 --> 02:16:02,484
Am I supposed to avoid it?

2492
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:03,740
No, actually, but if you,

2493
02:16:03,741 --> 02:16:06,360
if you do buy it directly from
the gnostic media websites,

2494
02:16:06,361 --> 02:16:08,440
a Amazon takes less of our cuts.

2495
02:16:08,441 --> 02:16:12,460
So get it from me ever sponsored,
you know,

2496
02:16:12,461 --> 02:16:14,470
all of the research and work
is sponsored by the public.

2497
02:16:14,540 --> 02:16:18,860
So this a Friday, Saturday and Sunday
we will be at the Irvine Improv.

2498
02:16:19,610 --> 02:16:23,480
Tomorrow we're going to have an
early podcasts, a noon one with none.

2499

this Anthony Bordain thing.

2501
02:16:28,770 --> 02:16:30,150

2504
02:16:36,461 --> 02:16:38,980
Clay said he would do it too, but
yeah. All right, Holler at your boy.

2505

endorsement. Never thought of that,

2510
02:16:54,981 --> 02:16:55,780
that they might,

2511
02:16:55,780 --> 02:16:59,050
they might step in with
some fucking shitty letter
writing campaign. Don't do it.

2512
