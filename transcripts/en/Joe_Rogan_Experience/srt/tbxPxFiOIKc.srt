1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Joe rogan podcast all day,
the Joe Rogan experience podcast all 

2
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:13,850
day.

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,550
Hey everybody.
Let me introduce you to everybody here 

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,190
because we've got a large group of 
humans.

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,080
First of all,
we have my good friend Dr.

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,210
Mark Gordon.
He's been on the podcast before,

7
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:27,490
brilliant endocrinologist slash all 
around.

8
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:32,491
Awesome dude and his friend and patient,
Matthew Gosney and Matthew and I'm right

9
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,310
here to my left.
We have Jason Halls,

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,340
a screenwriter for American sniper and 
we're going to get into a lot of things 

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:41,910
on this podcast,
but one of the big ones that we're going

12
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:46,911
to talk about is Dr Gordon,
if you've listened to the previous 

13
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:48,120
podcast that he and I did have,
you haven't.

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:53,130
It's excellent.
Go back and check it out if you're 

15
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:53,130
bored.
Um,

16
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,770
but you're an expert in traumatic brain 
injury and you contacted me about 

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,031
Matthew and you've,
you've done some amazing work on 

18
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:01,190
soldiers coming back from,
uh,

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,230
from Iraq and Afghanistan and also 
athletes with ptsd and the issues that 

20
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:08,470
come out of ptsd.

21
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,310
Not just psychological but traumatic 
brain injury,

22
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,420
which is something that we're dealing 
with more with these series of wars.

23
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:21,421
And we ever had before,
because of the advancements in medical 

24
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:23,521
science,
they're able to keep people alive that 

25
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:24,340
may have died before and also they're 
able to recognize what's going on,

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,520
what shell shock is this term that they 
used after World War Two and know would 

27
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,650
they.
They changed it a little bit in Vietnam 

28
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,311
that they altered the name of it,
but essentially we're dealing with the 

29
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,041
same issues.
We're dealing with the trauma to both 

30
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,910
the mind and the consciousness that's 
happening to people that experienced 

31
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,910
horrible things,
see horrible things,

32
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,030
but also experienced damage to their 
actual brain itself.

33
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,310
Absolutely.
The point of a foundation is the 

34
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:59,930
distinction between what ptsd is versus 
minimal or mild traumatic brain injury.

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,320
Unfortunately about 410,000
vets were coming back with what's being 

36
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,911
late.
They're being labeled as traumatic as 

37
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:11,210
ptsd when in fact they have a form of 
traumatic brain injury.

38
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:16,211
The distinction between the two is a 
psychological one which has ptsd and a 

39
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,000
physical one which is traumatic brain.
Under the psychological.

40
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,110
You've witnessed,
you know,

41
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:26,170
horrible things out there in the 
battlefield where you've seen your 

42
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,111
friends being gutted or ied,
blowing them up in being left without 

43
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:31,020
any limbs,
and then in the psychologic,

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,040
in the physical one,
you actually have the impact of the 

45
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,070
explosion or a penetrating wound like a 
shot to the head or being bludgeoned and

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,400
in football,
and it's believed that under the 

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,191
psychological one with the ptsd,
that reliving the event that 

48
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:53,291
precipitated is what causes you to 
become depressed and anxious and so 

49
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:53,291
forth.

50
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,010
Under the minimum or the mild traumatic 
brain injury.

51
00:02:55,011 --> 00:02:59,030
It's the physical trauma to the brain 
that leads to deficiencies of hormones,

52
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,050
which is what my whole premise has been 
for my treatment of traumatic brain 

53
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,720
injury.
So what's being missed is there are guys

54
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:12,721
that go out there in the field who have 
already had issues of traumatic brain 

55
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:17,011
injury because they'd been fighting a 
firing weapons which caused jolting 

56
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:20,260
action or they've been jumping off out 
of planes and hitting the ground at 10,

57
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:21,490
15,
20 miles an hour.

58
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,880
These types of impacts are significant 
amount of to make a traumatic brain 

59
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:32,101
injury and interrupt the way that the 
brain controls our hormone balance in 

60
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:33,760
our body,
and this is all fairly new,

61
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:38,761
this understanding of these things like 
jumping out of planes or even playing 

62
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,120
soccer and heading the ball.
Correct.

63
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,150
That's what we're finding in in 
football,

64
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:46,330
you know by the time you get into the 
national football league,

65
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:49,660
you've already gone through peewee pop 
warner in high school,

66
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:52,120
junior high school and so forth and 
college football,

67
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,450
and by the time you get to the major 
games you've already have the entire 

68
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,101
process of loss of functionality in the 
brain and then you need just one more 

69
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:03,970
hit,
one more,

70
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:08,971
not even loss of consciousness to create
the scenario of inflammation in the 

71
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:09,940
brain that leads to hormone deficiency.

72
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,850
Yeah,
it's the.

73
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,970
The issue has always been thought of as 
when you.

74
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,280
When it comes to brain damage,
you,

75
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,280
you always thought of people who have 
been beaten up like boxers that have had

76
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:26,281
long careers or football players who 
have had long careers and they just 

77
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:29,620
stayed in too long,
but we're finding that a lot of athletes

78
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:32,320
like mark Henry's,
his name was no,

79
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,240
what was his name?
The young guy,

80
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,530
Chris Henry,
Chris at the young guy who fell off the 

81
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:39,550
back of a truck,
did something really irrational.

82
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,220
His girlfriend was driving away,
jumped on the back of her truck,

83
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,110
fell off,
died,

84
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,910
hit his head,
but then when they examined his brain,

85
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,730
like this guy has a brain of a 70 year 
old Alzheimer's patient.

86
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,670
Right,
and it's all just be.

87
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:52,150
And he was 26,
I believe,

88
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,210
26.
I'm a mid twenties and just a career of 

89
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,440
playing in the NFL as well as well as 
college football,

90
00:04:59,560 --> 00:04:59,980
high school.

91
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,980
The whole deal that like you detailed 
had left this guy with a significantly 

92
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,971
damaged brain before he was even 30 
years old and he was running around 

93
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:10,060
functioning.
Nobody had suspected this.

94
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,030
He was behaving like a normal person.
Correct.

95
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,060
If you look at the suicides that have 
been happening in football,

96
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:21,061
when they're between the ages of 25 and 
35 that committing suicide,

97
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,940
looking at their brain,
you see that they're aging a lot more 

98
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,690
faster than normal person,
and in fact a study that was performed 

99
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:35,731
by the nfl showed that there was an 18 
times faster occurrence of Alzheimer's 

100
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:38,950
disease in people who have had traumatic
brain injury playing in nfl.

101
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,460
We've had boxers as patient.
Two Thousand and seven did a espn 

102
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:48,300
outside the line with a two football 
players in a boxer,

103
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,120
James,
Tony,

104
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,110
and we showed his hormone levels were 
down low.

105
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,940
The laboratory read them all as being 
low.

106
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,940
I didn't have to interpret it.
The lab did so that verified the fact 

107
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,260
that they were really low and he had a 
lot of difficulties with weight,

108
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,590
with control and so forth.
And as the host of the show said,

109
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,860
how can you be testosterone growth 
hormone deficient and still be able to 

110
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:11,860
do that kind of functioning.
You know,

111
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,130
the personality takes over.
You know,

112
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:18,131
it's just the way that the person 
projects their life hormones help to 

113
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:20,150
stabilize it,
to make it available,

114
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:22,930
and then you as an individual get to 
decide what you do.

115
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:25,310
And he was in the ring fighting as 
though there was nothing wrong,

116
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:27,380
but he had a lot of problems outside the
ring.

117
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,450
So what you're saying essentially is 
that is just his,

118
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:32,490
his discipline and his will that kept 
him fighting,

119
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:34,530
but he was significantly depleted.
Correct.

120
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,630
He was unbelievably depleted.
And then looking at a gentleman by the 

121
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,830
name of Brad legged,
who was the mariners and the patriots,

122
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,580
his hormone levels were incredibly low 
when he talks about how his,

123
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,010
I'll use rejuvenation occurred where he 
improved in mental functioning,

124
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,350
physical functioning and physiological 
functioning.

125
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,590
When he had his hormones returned to 
normal and pat harlow was on the show 

126
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,920
and they all talked about their 
experience when from multiple head 

127
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,131
traumas.
I think pat said he had double digit 

128
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:05,131
head traumas and um,
you know,

129
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:07,540
if we go back and start doing some of 
the new technology,

130
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,960
like a dtm awry,
which has an MRI that looks at the 

131
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,841
connectivity of nerves.
Look at a pet scanner spect scan that 

132
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:19,351
looks at the flow of blood through the 
brain and you can find areas of deficit 

133
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,550
because they've been damaged and you 
can't get them back.

134
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,920
And Matthew,
how did you get in touch with Dr Gordon 

135
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,880
and had this whole process start?
I'll start with your shell.

136
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,030
Actually,
when he was on here last time I was in 

137
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,290
the hospital for a suicide attempt and 
was an avid listener.

138
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,290
Was listening to that.
He was on here talking about it.

139
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,940
You know,
I was at my last.

140
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,910
I had no other options essentially.
And you're a veteran explaining.

141
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,650
Explain your history for the people 
listening to this.

142
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,810
Sure.
On the navy seal medic.

143
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,710
I've been out since 2008.
I live up in Washington,

144
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,690
got out,
started having all kinds of issues,

145
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,640
just kind of down spiraled.
Went into the va finally and said,

146
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,210
this is going on.
Immediately they diagnosed me with PTSD,

147
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,070
handed me about 10 medications and then 
we did follow ups checkups can what kind

148
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:16,190
of medications?
The SSRI antidepressants,

149
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,620
antianxiety meds.
I have chronic pain,

150
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:23,330
so they dosed me up on pain medications 
to cotton things along those lines.

151
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,530
Fentanyl,
morphine,

152
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,690
oxycontin.
It was on all three at one point.

153
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,750
Jesus,
by the way,

154
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:30,650
how high did you get

155
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:37,430
the ground?
Totally feel bad for them or jealous did

156
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:40,920
he share?

157
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,020
Wow.
And so,

158
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:47,480
um,
I was just having a lot of issues.

159
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:50,120
I was really depressed.
I started gaining weight.

160
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,230
I couldn't get up out of bed.
I was married at the time,

161
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,100
really struggling all that.
Then my wife left me because of what was

162
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:01,200
going on and I just,
I mean,

163
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:06,201
I literally had no hope because it,
I was thinking that I can't be fixed 

164
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:12,021
because they're giving me all these 
things saying this is going to make you 

165
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:12,021
better,
this is going to make you better.

166
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:14,310
And my mind wasn't getting any better.
So,

167
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,350
you know,
I decided it was better that I just 

168
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,350
wasn't here.
And ended up in the hospital,

169
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,780
was there for a week.
My wife actually brought me,

170
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,630
um,
my ipod and all my stuff.

171
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,870
So I was able to listen because she knew
that I and listened to the show.

172
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,760
And he was on here,
it literally,

173
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:32,190
the day I got out,
I went on and I applied,

174
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,580
got a grant,
had all my lab work done,

175
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,380
got sent to him.
Uh,

176
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:42,381
he sent me all my results back and so we
figured out kind of what kind of 

177
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,000
protocol I needed to do and then I flew 
down here to talk to him and started,

178
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,060
uh,
the trt.

179
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,890
So what do you think,
I mean,

180
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:51,770
if you could,
do you have like a series of events that

181
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:55,460
you can recall that caused your injuries
or is it just a,

182
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,000
just the entire entirety of your career 
in the military?

183
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,690
Well,
I was in two IED explosions to the face,

184
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,140
so I have six bolts in my jaw.
I took shrapnel to the side of my face.

185
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:11,141
I was shot in my leg.
I'm just from all the damage of doing 

186
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:11,690
everything,
not related to any mission,

187
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:13,910
but I ended up having surgeries on my 
shoulder,

188
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,210
arthritis and all my joints I have back 
issues.

189
00:10:17,211 --> 00:10:22,211
I mean,
so it just all kind of compounded into 

190
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:22,211
one of damage.
And then just,

191
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:23,480
you know,
shooting on fours all day,

192
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,180
jumping out of things,
rolling around,

193
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,140
you know,
even just,

194
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:28,560
um,
you know,

195
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,580
just hand to hand combat when we're 
practicing things you can get thrown on 

196
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,090
the ground and,
you know,

197
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,830
over time it's just,
that's essentially what it was,

198
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,600
is just so much stuff happened over 
time.

199
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:40,190
Then that just compounded.

200
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,640
And did you feel this coming on slowly 
or was it very quickly?

201
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:48,130
Was it when you got home was when you 
were over there?

202
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Um,
that's a hard thing to answer because 

203
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,851
for me it wasn't very noticeable other 
than the fact that I just didn't feel 

204
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:59,920
good mentally.
I wasn't there mentally.

205
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:04,921
You learn to shut things off,
you become desensitized to the world 

206
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:05,500
around you.
It as a soldier,

207
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:10,590
it's a survival mechanism.
And so emotionally I was able to do 

208
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,911
that,
to turn it off where everyone else 

209
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:16,951
around me could see something was wrong.
I wasn't acknowledging it because to me 

210
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,790
there wasn't anything wrong.
Um,

211
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,490
but,
you know,

212
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,580
I just thought the pain that I had,
that was just going to be the way it 

213
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:26,580
was.
I was depressed with everything.

214
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:26,580
I thought,
hey,

215
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,420
that's just life.
Now I went and did this.

216
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,780
Now I have to deal with that,
and you have this stubborn mentality 

217
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,861
because you put all these goals in front
of you and you've always accomplished 

218
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:41,131
them,
so now here's something that they're 

219
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:41,131
saying,
yeah,

220
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:41,131
you have this,
okay,

221
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:41,850
I can beat this too,
but as you're,

222
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,950
you keep going.
You're fine.

223
00:11:42,951 --> 00:11:44,400
Hey,
I'm not doing.

224
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,450
I can't beat this.
What's going on here?

225
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,190
So then you look at yourself when you 
go,

226
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,330
this is just me.

227
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,980
And does it get to a point where it 
seems like life is

228
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,980
so painful and there's so much 
negativity involved in your day to day 

229
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,760
existence that it seems pointless and 
you just want to shut it off and ended.

230
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,940
Is that like what's the mindset before 
you decided to try to take your life?

231
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,890
That's exactly the mindset.
I mean,

232
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,950
for me the breaking point was I think 
when my wife left because she didn't 

233
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:18,961
leave because she didn't love me.
She left because she couldn't live with 

234
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:22,471
me.
And if this person that I love and who 

235
00:12:22,471 --> 00:12:22,471
loves me back,
he can't live with me,

236
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:27,570
then what's the point in me being here 
and if she's begging me to get better 

237
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,230
and I'm going to counseling,
I'm going on all these medications,

238
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,380
they're switching my medications up 
every three months because the fucking 

239
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:34,570
not working and you're going,
okay,

240
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,000
I can't keep doing this.
I can't keep going on meds.

241
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:39,160
I can't keep being stoned out of my 
mind,

242
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,670
I guess you could say with all the pain 
meds and just.

243
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,390
I mean I didn't even feel like a human 
being.

244
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,330
There was this fog.
I didn't have cognitive function.

245
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,160
I could barely read.
I'm an avid reader,

246
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,260
I mean 10 minutes,
15 minutes.

247
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:51,220
And I was like,
fuck this,

248
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:53,380
I can't do it.
It just,

249
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,460
even even sleeping and was like,
alright,

250
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,430
I guess I couldn't sleep.
Struggled with that.

251
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,010
So even sleep wasn't even giving me 
comfort.

252
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,410
And so it was just,
you know,

253
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,720
there was no point to be here.
And were you in contact still with a lot

254
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,240
of the guys you served with and did they
have similar issues?

255
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,540
Some of them did,
some of them had different kinds of 

256
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:15,540
issues.
Um,

257
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,420
I think there's a stigma that ptsd 
causes us huge aggression.

258
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:20,230
That's,
you know,

259
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,750
anyone I discussed with a and I tell 
them,

260
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,700
you know,
I have ptsd like,

261
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,730
oh,
are you gonna you're worried you're 

262
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:29,730
going to fucking snap and kill 
everybody.

263
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:29,730
And I think,
um,

264
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,050
that's not,
I don't know if that's as common as it's

265
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:37,051
been made out to be.
I think there's just been some huge 

266
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:37,051
cases and it's come out,
but it definitely is an issue.

267
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,560
But for me that,
that wasn't the case.

268
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:44,430
Excuse me.
For me it was more just internalizing 

269
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:44,430
everything and shutting off and just,
um,

270
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,600
uh,
but you know,

271
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:50,080
having the ability.
I was telling Dr Gordon this yesterday,

272
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,460
you know,
for like for my wife,

273
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,520
she didn't know what Matthew,
she was getting each morning and there 

274
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,640
was the matthew who was loving could 
listen or whatever,

275
00:13:57,641 --> 00:14:02,641
you know,
the one she married or she was in get 

276
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,771
the math,
you could rip your soul out and eat it 

277
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:04,771
right in front of her.
And she didn't know.

278
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:05,260
And I was never,
I never hurt her,

279
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,810
but um,
there's definitely,

280
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,940
when you shut off emotions,
uh,

281
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,970
there's a fierceness to that and it's 
scary,

282
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,170
you know,
she would tell me,

283
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:14,620
you know,
your,

284
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,790
your face scares me and I wouldn't hurt 
her,

285
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,860
but there it's a protection thing for 
me.

286
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,130
And you just,
um,

287
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,180
you just learn.
So a protection thing,

288
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:26,380
meaning,
like your aggression,

289
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:28,090
it was almost like to shut other people 
out.

290
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,560
Yeah.
Well,

291
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:31,270
yeah,
there's multiple things to that.

292
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,350
One,
I didn't want to deal with it.

293
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:34,240
And two,
if I could shut them out,

294
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,390
then um,
then I didn't have to acknowledge that I

295
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:40,060
was interactions.
I just don't want to interact.

296
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,760
I don't want to talk to you.
I don't even want to look at you just go

297
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:45,670
away.
And because you could see the pain,

298
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:47,920
every time they look at you and it's 
just a reminder,

299
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,450
it's that case of,
you know,

300
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,180
you can't,
can't get better until you acknowledge 

301
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:55,180
it's wrong.

302
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:55,180
So you just don't acknowledge it in the 
same bucket.

303
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,330
So you,
you hear about Dr Gordon on the podcast.

304
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,340
You hear about this,
the treatment for traumatic brain 

305
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,771
injury,
and you hear about hormone replacement 

306
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:06,440
and the damage to the pituitary gland 
that happens during these impacts.

307
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,690
You,
you get together and you start hormone 

308
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,440
replacement therapy.
And then what are the results?

309
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,500
Well,
it sounds like an infomercial does.

310
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,730
I mean,
it almost sounds almost sounds like a 

311
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:20,730
miracle cure,
but at this point,

312
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:20,850
for me it was,
um,

313
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,290
within 10 days,
the biggest thing for me was my 

314
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,560
cognitive function.
Within 10 days the fog was lifted.

315
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,720
I could think clearly I could do things 
again.

316
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:35,190
Um,
and even physically within those first 

317
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:35,190
10 days,
I was able to get out of bed,

318
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:35,720
less pain,
you know,

319
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,510
I could move.
Um,

320
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,060
and then within like six weeks I started
feeling like matthew started feeling 

321
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,430
like me,
okay,

322
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,270
I can go to the gym today,
you know,

323
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,400
and I can go do this today.

324
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,010
I can read today,
I can interact today.

325
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:49,980
I mean,
it,

326
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,200
it's so hard to describe because you got
so used to how it felt that once it 

327
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:58,010
starts changing,
you're like,

328
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,330
Whoa,
this is unreal.

329
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,650
This is happening.
So this,

330
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:02,630
I'm a different person,
my real,

331
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,270
I'm the real me,
but a different person than you know,

332
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,750
or had been the last couple of years and
so it's,

333
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,780
it's almost an adjustment because now 
you've got to go back and try to just 

334
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,850
heal all the damage that you did around 
you.

335
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,910
Wow.
You know,

336
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:20,110
so just replacing your hormones had that
significant an effect on your wellbeing,

337
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,450
how you interacted with people.
She cope,

338
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,460
changed everything.
That's amazing.

339
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,370
So what,
what exactly did you.

340
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,190
Well,
what'd you put them on?

341
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:29,320
Tell me what,
what,

342
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:34,330
how did it start as a medical issue of 
talk about that now he's given me the 

343
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:34,330
green light.

344
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,650
He gave me the green light for it.
You know,

345
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:41,651
we ran through a 28 point hormonal 
assessment and that 28 hormones 

346
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:44,750
assessment looks at brain regulation of 
the peripheral hormones,

347
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:49,751
you know,
in order to make testosterone signal 

348
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:50,630
comes from the pituitary and tells your 
testicles or a woman the ovaries to make

349
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:52,760
Gastrin,
stoss drone and then whatever.

350
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:58,390
And in looking at his pattern,
he had a very deep deficiency of the 

351
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,350
regulatory mechanism for production of 
testosterone.

352
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,060
But testosterone is only one of the 
multitude of hormones that we focus on.

353
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:07,910
There's Dht,
dihydrotestosterone is Dah,

354
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:12,380
da Di dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.
And what we're finding,

355
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:15,920
you said we think of hormones as gender 
or sex hormones.

356
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:18,650
Well,
the sex aspect of it as baby 30 slash 40

357
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:19,550
percent.
The roots,

358
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,110
the remainder is on repair and 
maintenance of our body.

359
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,460
One of the greatest things about 
testosterone's,

360
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,410
anti inflammatory.

361
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,600
What happened to your joint pains in 
your back?

362
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:33,560
Pains on testosterone.
So reduced by half of that first week.

363
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,870
That's incredible.
And this is in the literature,

364
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:40,871
you know,
I won't get too technical because I 

365
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:43,301
won't understand it myself,
but the issue is that the testosterone 

366
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,820
growth hormone like estrodial 
progesterone all regulate inflammatory 

367
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,220
chemistry in our body,
our immune system.

368
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,320
And we've also found in the past seven 
to 10 years that the brain makes its own

369
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:57,990
hormones and its own hormones being 
testosterone,

370
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:00,750
dihydrotestosterone,
estrogen and so forth in the brain.

371
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,990
And what they do is they regulate the 
ability of the nerves.

372
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:05,890
And I just gave a lecture that we 
called,

373
00:18:05,891 --> 00:18:10,891
um,
the non permissive environment which 

374
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:11,520
talks about when you have head trauma 
neurotrauma,

375
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,550
where you've been hit or explosion and 
so forth were areas of the brain shut 

376
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:20,161
down in their ability to produce 
hormones that regulate how you feel in 

377
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:21,330
your ability to have cognitive 
functioning.

378
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,130
So not only on testosterone replacement,
we use physiological dosing,

379
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:26,940
which is,
you know,

380
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:31,590
an average 25 to 35 year old male makes 
about four to 10 milligrams a day.

381
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:34,620
So we'll use 60 milligrams a week or 80 
milligrams a week,

382
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:39,621
which is about a fourth.
The amount that's used out there by 

383
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:41,010
traditional physicians who are replacing
testosterone.

384
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,310
And he got phenomenal response without 
any of the side effects.

385
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,700
So the hormone replacement includes I'm 
anti inflammatory medication,

386
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:55,011
which are all natural things like Pqq,
which is a form of Co q 10 that stopped 

387
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:58,380
the production of oxygen.
They call it reactive oxygen species,

388
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:03,381
which are oxidative chemistry oxidants.
And that leads to death of cells.

389
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,990
And there's an incredible amount of 
literature that has been out for many,

390
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:11,991
many years.
And now it's getting more focused that 

391
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:14,001
in order for us to heal the brain,
not only do we have to replace the 

392
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:15,000
hormones,
but we also have to protect it from this

393
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,310
oxidative stress that the brain goes 
through.

394
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,510
Sounds like,
you know,

395
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:23,511
one of those trendy kind of statements,
but it's actually factual and there's 

396
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:28,160
just thousands of articles coming out 
and how much we need glutathione or we 

397
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:31,080
need vitamin C dot Pqq,
Co q 10,

398
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,260
all the things that take the free 
radicals that are damaging the ability 

399
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,380
of the brain to regenerate.
And uh,

400
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,280
in this lecture I just gave back in 
1911,

401
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:46,310
there was a guy by the name of Italo who
proved that we can generate our nerve 

402
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,120
cells or neurons.
And then 19,

403
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:53,121
28,
and then there's a guy in Canada who's 

404
00:19:53,121 --> 00:19:53,280
like the guru and the ability to 
regenerate the brain,

405
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:55,020
but you have to have the right 
environment.

406
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,750
That right environment involves,
you know,

407
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:02,751
hormones.
And also to help step up the system's 

408
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:02,751
ability to fight the oxidative stress.

409
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,350
Why is this a sort it,
if not ignored?

410
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:11,351
Why is this not commonly known by a lot 
of physicians or by a lot of people that

411
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:16,391
talk about different neurochemicals that
change behavior because we think of 

412
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:18,830
dopamine and Serotonin.
Those are the two big ones,

413
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,850
right?
When you think of Serotonin reuptake 

414
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,841
inhibitors,
when you think of antidepressants or 

415
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:27,410
when you think of people depleting that 
with drugs,

416
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,040
you're thinking of dopamine and 
serotonin primarily.

417
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,150
Well,
very rarely does he do.

418
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,320
The other ones get brought up.
Well,

419
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:34,850
I think

420
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,260
unfortunately there's a financial 
motivation to things.

421
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Matthew is on probably about 40 or 50 a 
month of medication.

422
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:53,590
One of the medications that he was on 
was a couple hundred dollars a month and

423
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:58,591
when you're talking about,
I think you said 15 total medications 

424
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,250
that when you add up the cost per month,
you're talking about thousands of 

425
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,330
dollars a month,
so it was history and keeping these 

426
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,400
people in medical industry as well.
As you know,

427
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,480
the analogy that I make is,
if you remember back in Legionella 

428
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,240
Pneumophila in Philadelphia,
which was a lung infection,

429
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:17,920
they went and gave these people know 
thousand dollars drugs and it turned out

430
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,620
that it was a fifty cent drug.
Erythromycin that treated it.

431
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,680
We're looking for things that are so 
brand new that we've ignored the very 

432
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,421
basic fundamentals.
My martial arts instructor always said 

433
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:30,520
back to basics,
back to basics.

434
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,590
Thank you young you.
So,

435
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,630
so Jason Hall,
uh,

436
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,170
you're a screenwriter,
you,

437
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:41,230
you wrote American sniper,
which has been directed by Clint 

438
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,230
Eastwood,
which is a,

439
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,070
uh,
when is that coming out?

440
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,880
It comes out at Christmas and it's about
Chris Kyle,

441
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,510
a famous story of the book,
American sniper,

442
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:52,390
of course,
best selling book and a tragedy where he

443
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:57,391
was killed while he was working with 
Ptsd sufferers and he was working with 

444
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,260
someone on the range who was suffering 
and he wound up getting killed by them.

445
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,940
How did you get involved in all this?

446
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,260
I'll say first that you know,
that's a,

447
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,920
that's a pending trial.
So we don't know if that guy had ptsd or

448
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,490
you just had a screw loose or what it 
was.

449
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:18,970
He got approached by a woman who is 
working to get that sucker right up to 

450
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,330
your mouth.
Woman who was working in the parking lot

451
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:21,590
at his kid's school said,
you know,

452
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,660
my,
my kid is suffering and read your book,

453
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:24,920
you serve.
Can you help him out?

454
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,010
And that's about all he got.
And uh,

455
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,560
he'd been helping out a lot of vets and 
uh,

456
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,940
you know,
this guy had it informed and uh,

457
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,620
it was,
it was a tragic story.

458
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:37,900
I met Chris,
uh,

459
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
in 2010.
He got out in 2009 and I'd heard his 

460
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,330
story and I went down to Texas to meet 
him.

461
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,590
And,
uh,

462
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,890
I'd never been to Texas before either 
and had,

463
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,990
hadn't met many navy seal snipers.

464
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,100
Welcome to America to access and navy 
seals altogether.

465
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,190
I showed up and it's like 60 cops,
60 Texas cops,

466
00:22:58,191 --> 00:23:01,780
like half of all the Texas Rangers were 
in the room and uh,

467
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,760
and I don't drink.
So I wasn't real popular at first.

468
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,460
The only way I could ingratiate myself 
to them was one of them was picking on 

469
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,530
me and call me Hollywood liberal and 
this and that and panty waist and,

470
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:20,590
and uh,
so I throw them in a front headlock and 

471
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,971
I had jacked him up a little bit and 
then Chris finally started talking to 

472
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:27,191
me.
It was like a choke him out a little 

473
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:27,191
bit.
Yeah.

474
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,070
How did you get

475
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:28,970
involved in this?
You,

476
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:30,460
you read the story?

477
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,470
I heard this story.
Yeah.

478
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,860
I heard the story of this guy had shot,
you know,

479
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,800
you've got more confirmed kills in 
anyone US military history.

480
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,460
And uh,
I called a buddy of mine who was 

481
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:43,460
serving.
He had a,

482
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,910
he had been seal team six.
He was working down at the CIA at the 

483
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:46,910
farm and I said,
hey,

484
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,860
this guy,
this guys killed,

485
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,970
got more confirmed kills than anybody.
And he hit a shot from 2100 yards,

486
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,220
confirmed,
kill at 2100 yards.

487
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,110
He's like,
I got news for you buddy.

488
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,870
Your guy's full of shit.
You're full of shit.

489
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,330
They're five guys on the planet who can 
hit that shot in your boys.

490
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:03,770
Not One of them.
I was like,

491
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:04,760
all right,
well look it up.

492
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,090
So he calls back and he's like,
so uh,

493
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,860
Chris,
cause one of the five.

494
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,150
Wow.
Yeah.

495
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,640
There's a vortex optics.
Some,

496
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:17,570
a friend of mine that are provided me 
with scopes and stuff for hunting.

497
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,970
They,
they actually got a call from someone in

498
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:24,971
Afghanistan that was about to shoot 
somebody and they needed to know how to 

499
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:29,471
adjust their scope correctly.
So they were talking over a sat phone 

500
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:33,610
with the guys at vortex and giving them 
the exact adjustments to make some 

501
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,260
fucking thousand yard shot.
Yeah,

502
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,600
thanks.
Take care.

503
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,500
It's great when you get to like real 
long distance,

504
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:49,510
like a thousand yards plus,
I mean a lot of it is just calculations 

505
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,320
and mathematics and understanding scopes
and how much the bullet's gonna drop.

506
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,290
Yeah.
And I think some of it is,

507
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,840
some of it is instinct and I think some 
of it is,

508
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,580
you know,
he said God kissed the bullet.

509
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,050
Yeah.

510
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,190
Jesus Christ.
Amen.

511
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:05,690
God's mean fuck or not either way kissed
it or he blew on it.

512
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,670
Whatever happened,
it worked.

513
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,390
Um,
so you get involved with these guys.

514
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,660
You start in just becoming immersed in 
the world of the soldiers and their 

515
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:22,730
issues.
And how did you get connected to Matthew

516
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,870
and to Dr Gordon?

517
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,410
Well,
when I met Chris,

518
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,340
you know,
I walked in,

519
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:28,110
I met him,
I looked him in the eye and I was like,

520
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,870
Oh shit,
you know,

521
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,820
this guy's not home yet.
Like you could see it in his eyes.

522
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:34,650
There was something going on and it 
felt,

523
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,730
it felt like there was turmoil there.
It felt like he was still fighting and I

524
00:25:38,731 --> 00:25:40,350
called my wife and I was,
I was like,

525
00:25:40,351 --> 00:25:45,351
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I don't know what's going to go on with 

526
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:45,351
this guy.
I don't know,

527
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:45,750
you know,
how he's going to work it out.

528
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:50,751
But he's,
he's got some stuff to work out and 

529
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:50,751
it's,
you know,

530
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:51,450
it was hard to look at.
It was hard to look into his eyes.

531
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:57,020
And uh,
thankfully his wife and his kid showed 

532
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,421
up the next day and I saw it change.
I saw for a minute the fog kind of 

533
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:03,000
lifted and I saw him light up,
his kids ran into his arms and,

534
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,910
and I saw like,
here's what this guy was like before the

535
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:06,890
war,
you know,

536
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,590
this is the man who,
who was there before the war and,

537
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,290
and here's maybe the man that he could 
become again.

538
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:18,910
Wow.
How many of these guys are just tough 

539
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,170
and they just deal with this new 
reality.

540
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:26,650
I mean,
it seems like that is a big part of 

541
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:26,650
what's going on when you're saying the 
guy wasn't back yet,

542
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,941
but yet he was physically and he was 
going through emotions and living his 

543
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:34,040
life.
But all the shit that probably was going

544
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:36,500
on in his brain and certainly going on 
in his psyche,

545
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,100
I think most come back that way.
I think that's their first mentality is 

546
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,100
like,
for me,

547
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,350
you don't,
you're not going to admit that

548
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,830
I've beaten things worse than this.
I'm going to keep going.

549
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,770
Especially seals,
right?

550
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,110
Yeah.
Just to get through buds,

551
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,150
just to get through any of it.
That's what I said.

552
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:55,770
But any,
any challenge has been in front of me.

553
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,260
It seems like I've completed it.
And so this,

554
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,320
that's all it was.
And once I finally realized that I 

555
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,690
couldn't how broken,
because then I,

556
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,470
then I really felt broken because it's 
never happened.

557
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,180
There's no light at the end of the 
tunnel.

558
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,970
I just all dark.
It goes dark to the end of time.

559
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,350
Yeah.
I mean the best parts about me were gone

560
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,040
and had Chris Kyle,
if he received any treatment for ptsd 

561
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,631
other than the standard dose of 
painkillers and Ssrs and what have you.

562
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,040
No,
you know,

563
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:30,140
I think Chris,
I think Chris dealt with it,

564
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,250
doing some drinking and then he finally 
kind of worked his way through it.

565
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:35,270
Got a little,
you know,

566
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,300
got back into church and,
and started actually helping these guys 

567
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,160
helping other veterans and he found 
peace in that he found peace and helping

568
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,990
other guys.
And you know,

569
00:27:44,991 --> 00:27:49,991
I can't speak to,
to what he felt when he laid his head 

570
00:27:49,991 --> 00:27:49,991
down on the pillow at night.
But,

571
00:27:49,991 --> 00:27:52,340
uh,
he found some real solace in,

572
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,320
in helping these vats and they'd,
you know,

573
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,340
they'd bring them up and they'd go out 
shooting at the range or go hunting and 

574
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:00,650
uh,
you know,

575
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:05,740
and end up talking around the bed of a 
pickup truck for four hours with a 

576
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,221
couple of beers in and then you,
you get a little bit of this comradery 

577
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,460
and,
and they don't feel so alone.

578
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,840
We had a purpose.
Again,

579
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,290
you have a purpose while you're in,
you have a job

580
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,060
now and it's gone.
It's ripped from you and there's not,

581
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:25,150
you know,
there's no clear goal or mission in 

582
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:25,280
front of you anymore.
So you kind of searched for that.

583
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:27,980
Like for me,
I kind of was trying to figure out what,

584
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,160
you know,
what the fuck am I going to do with 

585
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,160
myself now?
What mission can I accomplish?

586
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,820
And it's not there anymore.
There's no people,

587
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:39,821
you know,
there's the structure of things are 

588
00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:39,821
gone,
the command is gone.

589
00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:43,870
It's just you.
And I think if it hadn't been for my 

590
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:47,171
wife,
I've never even would have gone in to 

591
00:28:47,171 --> 00:28:48,080
the va honestly because there's,
there's just happened to be someone that

592
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:52,160
lived with me the whole time who's like,
you need to go in or I'm gone.

593
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,210
And I mean if she hadn't been there,
I'd probably still be that way.

594
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:57,290
Now.
Honestly,

595
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:02,650
the UFC has done a lot of work for a 
traumatic brain injury and uh,

596
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,230
in,
in,

597
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:08,000
in helping to fund the Intrepid Center 
for traumatic brain injury.

598
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,280
And one of the most shocking things to 
me when we got involved,

599
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:14,780
we started doing these fights with the 
troops,

600
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,080
was that there was no funding for this,
that they had to get funding from other 

601
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,671
sources that they had to get funding 
from donations and they had to ask 

602
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:28,331
people to call in and donate.
And just unbelievably shocking to me 

603
00:29:28,331 --> 00:29:31,670
that we spend so much money to send 
these guys over there.

604
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:36,671
So much money for weapons and so much 
money for the latest high tech ways to 

605
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:42,010
kill people.
And so little on how to treat

606
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,050
these guys when they come back.
And girls.

607
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,480
I mean it's,
it's an issue,

608
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:50,550
so little money and also so little 
imagination and so little willingness 

609
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:50,830
to,
to explore new things.

610
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:52,510
We're talking about a fucking blood 
test.

611
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Yeah.
He's talking about a blood test to test 

612
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:57,610
their hormones and it's like,
oh,

613
00:29:57,611 --> 00:30:00,550
what a crazy idea.
This guy's out of the box.

614
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:01,780
He's crackers,
you know,

615
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:02,920
and it's,
it's.

616
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,420
You look at the,
you look at,

617
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:09,750
at the symptoms,
they're having the same symptoms the 

618
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,530
guys in the nfl are having.
It's the same symptoms that guys would.

619
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:15,850
Low Testosterone or habit and it's not a
huge mystery,

620
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:21,270
you know,
but it is a mystery to all these people 

621
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,451
and you know,
we're also talking about Kris Carr who 

622
00:30:24,451 --> 00:30:26,470
was the Achilles of Iraq and like that 
guy was having a hard time.

623
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,670
That guy had to go through the same 
thing and go talk to somebody.

624
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:36,150
You know,
there's a lot of guys out there who 

625
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,600
served and got no thanks for it.
They've got no recognition.

626
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,110
They got.
They were anonymous soldiers in a,

627
00:30:40,111 --> 00:30:44,200
in a war that nobody wanted and they 
came home and they were messed up.

628
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,700
Most,
most of them.

629
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,380
Most are like that,
you know,

630
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:48,010
and,
and look,

631
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,680
I'm sure there's guys who came home and 
they were okay.

632
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:53,650
Like I,
I haven't met a ton of those guys.

633
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:55,540
I've,
some of the seals are like that.

634
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,040
They're fun,
you know,

635
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:02,310
God bless.
But I spent the last year after writing 

636
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,620
sniper,
I'm adapting a book called thank you for

637
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:05,290
your service and this guy followed these
guys home.

638
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,960
He followed a battalion of army guys 
home from,

639
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:12,961
uh,
from Iraq and followed their wanderings 

640
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:14,790
into like how they were going to get 
back into their lives and how they,

641
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,890
these guys were going to deal with their
stress and dealing with the Va.

642
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:21,640
And it was a nightmare man.
And you meet these guys that just,

643
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,640
they don't have any hope.
They don't have any hope.

644
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,500
And you know,
some of them have,

645
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,620
have,
have the ptsd and some of them have 

646
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,440
additional injuries like matthew had and
they've got nothing.

647
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,160
They've got nothing in the va is like,
you know,

648
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,520
you're talking 22 soldiers a day kill 
themselves for soldiers who have killed 

649
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:47,221
themselves and have died.
And they'll correct which is the first 

650
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:47,221
time in any war in us history.

651
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:48,260
Well,
the thing we keep,

652
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:53,500
we keep records of it now there's a 
website which is called prevention and 

653
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:57,740
awareness,
suicide prevention awareness,

654
00:31:57,741 --> 00:32:02,741
which is a military site which keeps 
track of all the suicides and also 

655
00:32:02,991 --> 00:32:07,991
things to prevent it.
And they keep records of the dod in the 

656
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:08,330
22 a day I think is,
uh,

657
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,510
is not an accurate number.
and there was another report that came 

658
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,150
out where it's like 40 today where it's 
even more,

659
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:19,390
but you're right in 2012,
when they started really releasing the 

660
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:19,550
numbers,
there were more people killed,

661
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:25,180
more people committed suicide.
Then people were killed in A year of 

662
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,240
fighting in 2000 unfucking.
Believable from a patient standpoint 

663
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,470
going into the va.
I liked the va and they've been nothing 

664
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,831
but very kind to me and very good to me.
So I don't have anything in that regard 

665
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:39,700
to say.
But when you go in there and you get 

666
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,190
diagnosed with ptsd,
they you

667
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,300
one of the meds and to with all these 
appointments to talk to people who want,

668
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,580
you're not gonna fucking relate to,
I'm sorry,

669
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:51,581
but ms dot susie over there,
hasn't seen what I've seen or done what 

670
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:55,031
I've done and she's trying to engage me 
in this conversation and all I want to 

671
00:32:55,031 --> 00:32:59,381
do a slim face on the floor because 
she's trying to act as if she's my 

672
00:32:59,381 --> 00:33:01,160
friend and knows what I'm talking about 
and she doesn't.

673
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:06,310
And I know she only has goodwill,
but as a patient sitting there and this 

674
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:10,010
is supposed to help you and it's not 
helping you like this is fucking stupid.

675
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,160
And that's what happens.
Most people go to like one or two 

676
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,160
sessions and never go to counseling 
again.

677
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,040
You cannot fix the mind when the body is
not working.

678
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,500
When it's physiologically not working 
correctly,

679
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,110
the mind will never get better.

680
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,040
So that's essentially what's happening 
is they're trying to fix these ma,

681
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:31,370
the mind and these mental issues without
fixing the physiological aspect of it.

682
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,190
And then wondering why none of these 
people are getting better.

683
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,330
Okay,
well,

684
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,310
why are none of these medications 
working?

685
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,290
How many more medications can we give 
you,

686
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:44,650
you know,
before you end up in a situation like 

687
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:44,650
mine.
And that's what's happening.

688
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:49,240
And it's that part of it is ridiculous.
And that part of it angers me because it

689
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:51,170
is such an easy fix.
It's such a,

690
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,480
it seems like an easy fix,
you know,

691
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,570
as a patient that was effective fix in 
effect the fix.

692
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,060
But it's that,
um,

693
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,760
you know,
I remember when I first was going in 

694
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:03,760
there for my chronic pain,
you know,

695
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,200
they started me off with like aspirin,
tylenol.

696
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,390
They went through this progression to 
where they were.

697
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,030
And I remember my doctor look at me 
saying,

698
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:14,000
I know what you need,
but I have to do it this way.

699
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:19,510
So not only did I waste another six 
months to a year going on these 

700
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,420
ineffective because I did need something
for my pain,

701
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:24,230
probably not what they gave me,
but that's just another,

702
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:24,930
you know,
um,

703
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,700
example of sometimes I think they know 
that it's not working,

704
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:31,190
but they're in this bureaucracy where 
they have to just,

705
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,040
that's,
you know,

706
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,000
it's a federal institution.
They have to do this.

707
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:37,730
That's what they have to have,
sort of a chain of prescriptions.

708
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,260
There's,
this just didn't work.

709
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:41,840
We tried that and documentation of it.
Is that what it is?

710
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,590
Well,
yeah,

711
00:34:42,591 --> 00:34:47,591
I mean it's,
it's a rainbow of medications that 

712
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:49,541
everyone starts off on it seems like.
And that's what everyone's getting when 

713
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:51,710
they go in there and then they're 
wondering while none of them are effect,

714
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:53,180
you know,
some of them are effective,

715
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:55,280
but as a whole they're not.

716
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,360
And so you go in there.
I mean,

717
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:58,220
I was going in,
you know,

718
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,800
you know,
I would go in after 30 days,

719
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,270
it's,
I really do anything.

720
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:03,920
All right,
let's try it another two months.

721
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,120
Okay,
here's three months.

722
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,420
Well,
let's either up your dose or let's just 

723
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:10,420
throw that shit in the garbage and give 
you something else.

724
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:14,620
So noT only are you taking something,
my body's been on for three months now 

725
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,170
and then just introducing it to 
something else.

726
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,390
you know,
that I was like,

727
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,480
I was becoming worse.
I was just becoming more just not when 

728
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,040
the frustration,
frustration you need by the end of that 

729
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,000
you need a stronger medication just to 
deal with all the appointments you've 

730
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,000
been to.
Oh yeah.

731
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,110
It's ridiculous.
I mean,

732
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:35,111
I,
I did stop going to all my mental 

733
00:35:35,111 --> 00:35:35,410
counseling sessions because I knew that 
wasn't,

734
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,070
was,
wasn't what was going to help me.

735
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,330
I didn't need,
especially not talking to them,

736
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,250
you know,
maybe maybe a friend or something,

737
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,220
but a lot of that stuff that happens 
over there,

738
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,850
I don't want to talk about it at all.
It's very sacred.

739
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,880
It's very personal and intimate and to 
me it's not a game.

740
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,040
Most of the people around you talk to 
you and it's a fucking video game.

741
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,650
It's cAlled a duty and they sit there 
and they talk,

742
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:03,660
you know,
they talk and he was at that like that 

743
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:03,660
and you're like,
listen,

744
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,710
this is not okay,
so you just don't say anything.

745
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:10,070
Not only that,
I'm not going to tell my wife because 

746
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:10,240
she doesn't need to know any of this 
horror stuff that I went through.

747
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,600
So you just internalize it.
You internalize it,

748
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,840
you're buddies.
You almost don't want to talk about it 

749
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,241
because you know either you're still 
buddies or just anyone else she knew in 

750
00:36:20,241 --> 00:36:23,181
the military because then you're 
bringing it up to the surface again so 

751
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,230
it just becomes this thing where you 
take the deepest aspect of your soul and

752
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:30,231
you just shut the fuck in there and then
you pray and walk away and that is part 

753
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,460
of the problem and it's a mental issue.

754
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:36,660
It's that mental issue of like,
I think it progresses down this,

755
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:41,010
this slope downhill because when your 
body just starts smell functioning,

756
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,360
all this stuff that you're trying to 
deal with mentally goes with it.

757
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,660
It just all goes down and then you then 
you can't start handling just the daily 

758
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,390
things of life around you can't handle,
oh,

759
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:53,370
they got my coffee wrong.
All right,

760
00:36:53,371 --> 00:36:56,250
well now I'm fucking pissed and let's go
break a ton of shit.

761
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,050
You know,
just simple things like that,

762
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,070
that everyday it's like,
no,

763
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,810
it's not a big issue,
you know,

764
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,740
but you can't handle the little things 
around you and you don't have a buffer.

765
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,180
Yeah,
there's no buffer.

766
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:07,830
There's no nothing.
I mean,

767
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,640
and you find things to do.
I tried to find all kinds of hobbies to 

768
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:13,980
do and they work for a week,
but then you're just,

769
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:19,010
you realize you're right where you were 
and you just keep moving on and it just 

770
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:21,681
never gets better.
And that's the thing that was so 

771
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:21,681
frustrating about it.

772
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:23,770
It's also got to be frustrating for you,
Dr.

773
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:28,770
Gordon,
to know that there's sort of an 

774
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,550
ignorance involved in just treating the 
mind or just treating the symptoms of 

775
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:39,301
antidepressants with these kinds of 
medications when you're dealing with so 

776
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:42,631
many different things holistically.
The entire body has so many issues that 

777
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:46,441
aren't being addressed and they just 
addressing this one thing because this 

778
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:46,840
is all these doctors know,

779
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:52,140
correct.
It's really an a masking process that 

780
00:37:52,211 --> 00:37:55,030
they're doing.
The patient has complaints of isolation,

781
00:37:55,031 --> 00:37:57,310
which matthew had isolation,
withdrawal,

782
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,630
and hedonism.
He weren't enjoying doing the things you

783
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:03,780
were enjoying before.
And that's classical depression.

784
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,130
So we'll put them on an antidepressant.
Uh,

785
00:38:06,131 --> 00:38:11,131
you're having difficulty sleeping and 
put them on tresona and put them on 

786
00:38:11,131 --> 00:38:11,740
whatever medication in the frustration 
is.

787
00:38:11,741 --> 00:38:14,590
The literature is so clear.
I mean,

788
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:19,650
I didn't invent anything.
I just sit in front of the computer for 

789
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:19,990
eight,
nine hours a day and read the literature

790
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:24,991
that's coming out from all over the 
planet and they're so compelling that I 

791
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:26,300
put it into clinical application,
uh,

792
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:31,650
with not only the veterans but with the 
civilians who have had traumatic brain 

793
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,640
injury from motor vehicle accidents,
slip and fall,

794
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:35,860
what have you,
and the responses across the board.

795
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:40,890
Once you find the laboratory proven 
deficiencies or insufficiencies and you 

796
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:45,970
replace it,
you get these incredible responses.

797
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:51,030
A woman 32 years ago who had an motor 
vehicle accident head on we're neck,

798
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:56,281
hit the steering wheel and crushed her 
karate and she had a stroke on the 

799
00:38:56,281 --> 00:38:59,371
opposite side,
32 years of being on a multitude of 

800
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,540
medications and then she comes in and 
within a month she's feeling better.

801
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:06,541
They had her on adderall to counteract 
the side effects of the five 

802
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:07,990
psychotropic drugs like the ssri is and 
whatever and whatever,

803
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:13,650
and I'm at one month goes back to her 
psychiatrist in the south and she says 

804
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:15,560
to the doc,
a female doc,

805
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,530
she says,
I'd like to get off these medications.

806
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:19,090
The doc says,
honey,

807
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,490
I put people on antidepressants.
I adam,

808
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:24,280
take them off,
and that's the mentality that we have to

809
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:27,970
start educating that there are all our 
alternatives,

810
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,210
but they're being told the quick fix is 
to put them on an antidepressant.

811
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,120
Listening to matthew story,
in 10 days,

812
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:39,150
the clouds started to lift.
The fog started to dissipate and by six 

813
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,980
weeks he was coming back to who matthew 
remembered himself being.

814
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:47,230
That's the place.
Then that's the place where he can deal 

815
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:47,980
with the other stuff that has been 
suppressing.

816
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,880
Yes,
correct.

817
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,900
Exact.
Because these are.

818
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,820
These things are not independent of each
other.

819
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,080
You know,
in the past I started in 2004.

820
00:39:56,081 --> 00:40:00,430
I had four head traumas and when I was 
between 34 and 46,

821
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,080
I think I shared this with you once 
before.

822
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,500
Between 34 and 46 I started developing 
depression was depression was on paxil 

823
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,990
just wasn't a happy camper.
What will your head traumas from,

824
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,160
let's say at four years of age,
playing jungle gym in New York during 

825
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,160
the winter,
hit my head on the metal bars,

826
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,520
landed up in the ground at,
believe it or not,

827
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:19,020
I was sitting,

828
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,000
dare you shut that off,
shoot it.

829
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:30,110
And then when I was riding my bicycle to
a hebrew school at between twelVe and 

830
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:35,091
13,
I was hit by a car and knocked down or 

831
00:40:35,091 --> 00:40:35,091
cut my face,
cut my chin.

832
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,410
let's see.
At 18 years of age on the swim team,

833
00:40:37,411 --> 00:40:39,710
I was screwing around and hit my head on
the swimming poured.

834
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,290
And then in the February 9th,
February 9th,

835
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,420
19,
71 sylmar earthquake,

836
00:40:45,421 --> 00:40:48,240
before you were born,
a shelf,

837
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:51,360
a large shelf fell on my head and 
knocked me out.

838
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,100
So I was,
you know,

839
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,620
went through undergraduate medical 
school,

840
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:57,030
residency.
Everything was fine,

841
00:40:57,031 --> 00:41:02,031
but between 34 and 46 started developing
all these symptoms and then I went to a 

842
00:41:02,031 --> 00:41:04,920
facility and I had my hormones checked 
and I was thyroid,

843
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,170
which you saw me take earlier,
thyroid,

844
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,810
testosterone growth hormone deficient 
and uh,

845
00:41:09,811 --> 00:41:11,340
started on it.
And within a period,

846
00:41:11,341 --> 00:41:13,170
let's see,
august to November 3rd,

847
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:17,370
I woke up totally different person,
similar to what matthew was stating.

848
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,460
And not until that was 99,
not until 2004 when I read an article 

849
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,780
out of Turkey,
Turkey,

850
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:26,730
they have a lot of pugilist.
I like boxing.

851
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:32,030
And there was this one article that said
that boxers in Turkey were found to have

852
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,600
unusually high amounts of growth hormone
deficiency.

853
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,210
And the following year,
muay thai in Thailand came out.

854
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:43,211
And then that was my epiphany.
I went back to the literature and 

855
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:43,211
started finding one,
two,

856
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:47,381
five,
10 articles talking about head trauma 

857
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:48,320
associated with hormone deficiency and 
from 2014 to present,

858
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:53,590
that's all I read is these relationships
and we know in gerontology and geriatric

859
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:59,891
medicine,
internal medicine that as mail gets to 

860
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:03,311
be in sixties and seventies that you see
them go through a process that they 

861
00:42:03,311 --> 00:42:04,430
called dysthymia,
which is a mild kind of a blue,

862
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,460
you know,
feeling blue depression and they have 

863
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:09,590
significant testosterone deficiency.
When you replaced it,

864
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:10,130
they get better.

865
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,930
so why can't we see that things that 
accelerate your last head trauma leading

866
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:17,600
to testosterone deficiency causing 
depression,

867
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,020
that looking at the older generation who
have,

868
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:24,020
or the older age individuals who have 
hormone deficiency,

869
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:26,810
both males and females that they 
developed depression.

870
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:32,080
Why can't you link the two?
And that's where the problem's been in 

871
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,571
linking the two issues.
Hormone deficiency for whatever cause 

872
00:42:34,571 --> 00:42:35,450
can predispose you to,
uh,

873
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:36,710
issues of,
uh,

874
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:37,810
you know,
uh,

875
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:42,930
psychological problems and psychological
problems like depression is the number 

876
00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:46,520
one is fatigued.
Did you have fatigue,

877
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,610
fatigue,
fatigue with out being able to sleep,

878
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,290
correct.
Fatigue,

879
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,060
insomnia,
depression,

880
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,090
rage,
just for no reason.

881
00:42:56,091 --> 00:42:59,060
You just start being angry and rage,
screaming at people.

882
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,340
Patients has gone,
a libido,

883
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:04,820
sexual drive is gone.
You start doubting yourself.

884
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:09,821
A sense of wellbeing is gone.
A plum has gone confidence and 

885
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:12,320
assertiveness has gone and that's this 
issue of what they call co-morbidity.

886
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,080
When you're arguing the fact of it being
ptsd,

887
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:18,770
psychological versus a physiological 
cause for that psychological,

888
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:24,100
I think the head trauma creates the 
scenario biochemically to allow you to 

889
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,581
have sensitivity to these things that 
are called cycle effect of disease or 

890
00:43:27,581 --> 00:43:29,960
cycle neurotic diseases or whatever 
they're using today.

891
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:35,350
So it predisposes it so it mAkes you 
susceptible to the correct or the bad 

892
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:35,810
thoughts.
Correct.

893
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,220
What's the difference between,
you know,

894
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,710
you were talking when you were talking 
to jason,

895
00:43:39,711 --> 00:43:41,990
that when you saw,
when chris saw his kids,

896
00:43:41,991 --> 00:43:45,710
his personality changed.
That was the stimulus that was something

897
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:46,270
that,
you know,

898
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,980
put them on a peak.
Same thing with hormone correction.

899
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:52,970
It can correct those thoughts and we're 
finding something called neuro steroids,

900
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:58,330
which are the minor hormones that run 
through our body that are lost during 

901
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:02,540
inflammatory processes throughout the 
body can affect the brain that stabilize

902
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,760
our ability to not be schizophrenia.

903
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,800
Our ability not to be depressed,
our cognitive ability so that the long 

904
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,381
neurons that conduct information over 
long period of time to ingrain our raw 

905
00:44:14,381 --> 00:44:19,010
memories and so forth are stabilized.
And if you lose that stabilization,

906
00:44:19,011 --> 00:44:24,011
it's like pulling the plug.
You lose that ability to control it or 

907
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:24,350
you know,
turning the sound all the way down.

908
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:29,620
So by correcting the hormones,
that allows for the sound to come back 

909
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,741
up to where it should be so that you can
function at the level that I'm matthew 

910
00:44:32,741 --> 00:44:37,251
is.
We have a lot of people that have had a 

911
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:37,251
multitude of injuries.
Um,

912
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:41,780
what happened was because of a 
laboratory access medical lab in 

913
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,470
Florida,
they gave me a grant.

914
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:49,040
And what happens that they gave me a 
chunk of money and I matched it out of 

915
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,220
my pocket of my practice to provide the 
type of services that matthew in a large

916
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:58,410
group of other vets from the green 
berets from the navy.

917
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,750
Unshipped navy.
It's same navy,

918
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,250
right?
Yeah.

919
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,960
The st louis side,
the blue side.

920
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,950
Right.
And,

921
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:05,910
um,
in fact,

922
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,920
matthew matthew was the last one to get 
in on this program and because we ran 

923
00:45:12,991 --> 00:45:14,480
out of funds and,
uh,

924
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,640
we did a radio show a couple of weeks 
ago and one of my patients calls and 

925
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,450
offers US the money to get the system 
back up and running.

926
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,750
And last week when I was lecturing in 
vegas,

927
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:30,000
I'm approached by someone who had put in
a grant with deal with the dod,

928
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:33,480
uh,
doctors and get a patty and dr dash at a

929
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:38,481
university test of Texas who are now 
helping me to apply for a dod grant so 

930
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:41,400
that I can continue doing the work that 
we've been doing.

931
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,050
I'm still taking money out of my pocket.
And uh,

932
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,280
the lab is still providing us With the 
funds so that we can have a trickle of 

933
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,961
people,
but before we get 10 people at a time 

934
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:56,440
and they've all gotten better,
just not a lot of people that are 

935
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,250
talking about this though in the sense 
that the way you're talking about it,

936
00:45:58,251 --> 00:46:03,251
like did you see the hbo real sports 
piece on traumatic brain injury in 

937
00:46:03,251 --> 00:46:03,251
football players?

938
00:46:03,251 --> 00:46:03,800
No.
Well you're,

939
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:07,940
you're seizing all these pieces on these
guys that have all these issues,

940
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:13,210
but what you eat,
well they know what they're saying 

941
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,491
essentially is we have to be careful 
with the amount of damage these guys 

942
00:46:15,491 --> 00:46:18,641
take and football and there's gotta be 
some sort of methods in place to 

943
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:22,370
mitigate this or at least to monitor,
like put sensors on the helmets,

944
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:27,690
but they're not talking about hormones.
They're not talking about an another 

945
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,301
avenue of treatment that is based upon 
doing the right testing to see what the 

946
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:35,021
problem is.
They're not doing the testing to find 

947
00:46:35,021 --> 00:46:35,021
the hormone deficiency.
Defining,

948
00:46:35,021 --> 00:46:38,841
finding brain damage.
They're finding you're going to find 

949
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:40,280
dte,
the encephalopathy from trauma.

950
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:44,120
You're going to find that.
And what the literature is I referred to

951
00:46:44,121 --> 00:46:47,540
earlier is showing us that we can 
regenerate neurons.

952
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:51,110
It's been done,
we can heal the brain.

953
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,560
And the piece that came out in life 
extension magazine a couple years ago,

954
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:56,840
you know,
they interviewed me for this thing about

955
00:46:56,841 --> 00:47:00,950
healing the brain with hormones is 
happening and healing the brain,

956
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:05,951
regenerate neurons.
Like how has that done and what's the 

957
00:47:05,951 --> 00:47:05,951
process involved?
Well,

958
00:47:05,951 --> 00:47:09,320
it was my three hour lecture,
so I'll make it as short as I can,

959
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:14,630
having head trauma.
It initiates a group of inflammation,

960
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,660
inflammatory cascades in the brain that 
have,

961
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,370
that changed the chemistry of the brain 
so that the natural ability of the brain

962
00:47:22,371 --> 00:47:27,371
to regenerate nerves is lost.
we're finding that thyroid hormone,

963
00:47:27,491 --> 00:47:30,850
specifically thyroid three trial to 
directing,

964
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,300
is extremely important to help stem 
cells in the brain,

965
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:35,410
which they just found,
you know,

966
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:40,470
recently in the past 10 years that we 
have stem cells left in the brain that 

967
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:42,490
could regenerate the brain.
so when you're thyroid deficient,

968
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:47,491
what happens is the cells lose their 
ability to stimulate growth factors for 

969
00:47:47,491 --> 00:47:47,800
nerve regeneration.

970
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,570
And so having all the hormones back,
removing the trump,

971
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:57,630
the inflammatory processes in the brain 
can foster a neuro permissive 

972
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,200
environment with the nerves will grow 
and the sciences there,

973
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:07,260
they showing the things that stop the 
things that stimulated and in head 

974
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:07,270
trauma,
the not have been testing it because the

975
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:09,880
difficulty is in order to know what's 
going on in the brain,

976
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:13,610
you have to take a brain biopsy.
They'd been trying to get a markers.

977
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,170
s 100 is one of the markets they're 
working with right now.

978
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,630
That just tells you that it's happened.
You know,

979
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:24,340
we're doing so phenomenal at diagnosing 
that you have traumatic brain injury and

980
00:48:24,341 --> 00:48:27,550
seeing it on one of the neuro 
radiological techniques,

981
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:32,260
but they're failing in treatment.
What about the connective tissue between

982
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:34,870
the brain and the skull itself?
I mean,

983
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:39,871
isn't that an issue with boxers and 
fighters that have had repeated trauma 

984
00:48:39,871 --> 00:48:41,850
to see the connective tissue gets 
damaged?

985
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:46,860
What happens is subdural hematoma,
which is a bleed between the pia mater 

986
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,310
in the brain.
And then there's intra,

987
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,410
um,
cerebral bleeding that occurs.

988
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:55,500
And what happens,
the cause for loss of consciousness is 

989
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,331
because you've torn,
you've shared is what they call an 

990
00:49:00,331 --> 00:49:03,881
shearing or too few secs o'neil trauma.
You've broken the long nerves that 

991
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:09,691
connect everything to keep you 
stimulated to be awake and through this 

992
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:14,790
process called an mri or a dtm mri,
you can actually see a where nerves have

993
00:49:15,881 --> 00:49:18,670
broken and when you break them,
that's when you lose consciousness.

994
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:24,300
And so we can detect it.
We can not regenerate those directly,

995
00:49:24,371 --> 00:49:27,910
but we can build secondary pathways and 
that's what they're finding.

996
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:31,340
There's a chemical called nogo a and o,
g o a,

997
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:35,680
which actually inhibits the ability of 
nerves to regenerate.

998
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,740
And it's by controlling the environment,
you know,

999
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:43,741
using ivy gludethyon,
using some of the products that we have 

1000
00:49:43,741 --> 00:49:48,000
that can allow the brain to have an a 
environment and environment where it can

1001
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:49,450
regenerate.

1002
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,910
So the,
the,

1003
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:56,940
the trauma to the brain itself,
the nerves that get damaged will never 

1004
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:02,161
be replaced.
But the secondary pathways that are 

1005
00:50:02,161 --> 00:50:04,801
created to in response to that damage,
can they put someone back to the same 

1006
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:08,200
state that they were at?
Will they always be diminished?

1007
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,730
Like say you're talking about a guy like
you know,

1008
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:15,860
an unnamed mma champion who at the end 
of his career starts getting knocked out

1009
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:20,941
a bunch of times and we see that with 
guys who used to be able to take 

1010
00:50:20,941 --> 00:50:22,360
tremendous punches and now all of a 
sudden they get hit and they just go.

1011
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:27,570
Is that because of all those nerve 
breaks that have happened over the 

1012
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:28,040
course of their career and the secondary

1013
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,040
pathways just simply inadequate or is 
there another response going on where 

1014
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,080
the mind is protecting itself?
This is what I've heard described to me.

1015
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:40,370
They're shutting off quicker because the
mind has recognized this pattern,

1016
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,110
oh,
we're receiving trauma.

1017
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,500
The best way to do to mitigate this is 
just shut off.

1018
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,270
Well,
that's a simplified version of it.

1019
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:55,160
I'm not to make it too deep,
but their tolerance has changed.

1020
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,400
We're in the past,
they have a regenerative capacity or 

1021
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,950
they have endogenous system inside that 
can help to keep things in balance.

1022
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:08,360
When you've lost the ability of this 
automated system to control things,

1023
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,510
you pass out whether or not it's the 
vascular.

1024
00:51:11,511 --> 00:51:12,800
You're more sensitive.
Vascular,

1025
00:51:12,801 --> 00:51:17,801
so on the head trauma,
the blood shunts from one area to 

1026
00:51:17,801 --> 00:51:21,341
another,
so you lose the blood that keeps you 

1027
00:51:21,341 --> 00:51:21,341
awake and you pass out.
Um,

1028
00:51:21,341 --> 00:51:23,180
neurologicAlly,
yes,

1029
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:27,680
they could be breaking more nerves and 
therefore I'm losing it more readily.

1030
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:33,010
It's about resilience tolerance and how 
much of that you've lost.

1031
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:36,800
So you no longer have $100,000
in your bank account.

1032
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:41,801
You got a penny.
So when you buy that piece of gum that 

1033
00:51:41,801 --> 00:51:41,801
you can't buy you your empty.

1034
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:46,950
So any shot,
I mean that's what we just shot a shot 

1035
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:50,311
to the head.
They just start going and that doesn't 

1036
00:51:50,311 --> 00:51:50,311
get fixed.

1037
00:51:50,311 --> 00:51:53,520
correct.
Can't answer whether it gets fixed or 

1038
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,480
not because it depends on the individual
individual looking at their hormonal.

1039
00:51:55,481 --> 00:51:59,120
May lou looking at anything else that's 
a cold morbidity,

1040
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,590
things that are predisposing them to 
have a more sensitive response to it.

1041
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:03,820
Uh,
you know,

1042
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,530
certain drugs,
alcohol,

1043
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:09,350
I mean a lot of the drugs that we use,
there is one drug that's used a lot,

1044
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:14,360
I won't say the name,
but deals with cholesterol that doesn't 

1045
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,170
allow cells to regenerate.
Also wax your vitamin d and your co q 10

1046
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:22,080
when something like that.
I can't say the name because I want to 

1047
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,421
get sued.
Doesn't want the fucking evil army 

1048
00:52:25,421 --> 00:52:25,421
comIng after them.
Well,

1049
00:52:25,421 --> 00:52:27,680
there are articles showing that to know 
that the cells

1050
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:32,820
breakdown more readily and there's a 
process for processes in the brain which

1051
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:37,240
regulate a nerves staying strong and 
then being destroyed by.

1052
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:41,590
So anyone who's on those kinds of drugs,
like anti cholesterol drugs,

1053
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,690
they're risking a lot of damage to their
body.

1054
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:49,400
There are multitude of levels you shut 
off because I have a friend who's on it.

1055
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,690
Well,
anthony bourdain's on it.

1056
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:51,980
Uh,
you know,

1057
00:52:51,981 --> 00:52:56,981
and he's,
he's on it because he won't stop eating 

1058
00:52:56,981 --> 00:52:56,981
pork.
Is it kosher?

1059
00:52:56,981 --> 00:52:58,190
No,
I don't believe he's jewish.

1060
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:01,400
He may be the port kosher.
Obviously he isn't,

1061
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:03,000
it doesn't.
Dad's french,

1062
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,090
right?
It could be jewish.

1063
00:53:05,091 --> 00:53:05,880
I don't,
I don't think he was a.

1064
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:07,500
Well he's not religious,
but he,

1065
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:08,990
the Libya.
So it doesn't matter.

1066
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,470
Yeah.
But my point is he's,

1067
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:15,580
he's taking this just because he doesn't
want to do anything to reduce his 

1068
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,720
cholesterol because he,
because he enjoys fatty.

1069
00:53:17,721 --> 00:53:20,780
Awesome food and enjoy it,
but that shit is not good.

1070
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:21,300
Right?
Well,

1071
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:27,080
so if cocuten vitamin d in one of the 
chapters of the new book where I talk 

1072
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:28,830
about,
um,

1073
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:31,860
treatment for hormonal,
the first case that I presented as a guy

1074
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:36,861
who came in to me who was on one of 
those cholesterol lowering drugs and 

1075
00:53:36,861 --> 00:53:40,401
his,
all his hormones were down because 

1076
00:53:40,401 --> 00:53:43,221
cholesterol is the precursor to all our 
hormones are androgens and estrogens.

1077
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:46,680
So cortisol,
cortisol,

1078
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,120
pregnenolone,
testosterone,

1079
00:53:48,121 --> 00:53:48,840
estrone,
island,

1080
00:53:48,841 --> 00:53:51,840
dht and dah da.
And they were all reduced.

1081
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:55,380
all we did is stopped.
Is staten drug and it all came up.

1082
00:53:55,381 --> 00:53:59,550
I didn't have to do anything.
And what do you do to reduce cholesterol

1083
00:53:59,551 --> 00:54:01,770
other than diet?
Like for a guy like that?

1084
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,860
well,
opens up nice,

1085
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:08,040
warm the box of worms.
The question is,

1086
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:12,390
is cholesterol really the issue?
When you look at the statistics,

1087
00:54:12,391 --> 00:54:17,391
50 percent of all heart attacks happen 
in people with low or normal levels of 

1088
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:17,391
cholesterol.

1089
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:19,980
So the question that any intelligent 
person has to ask,

1090
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,120
excluding myself,
is that I'm than what's causing it?

1091
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,970
How did these people get heart attacks?
if the cholesterol is normal or low,

1092
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:32,100
why don't die of a heart attack with my 
cholesterol between 75 and 3:49,

1093
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,160
and my ultrafast ct scan that looked at 
my coronary arteries were perfectly 

1094
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:37,770
clear.
how is it that when my best buddies,

1095
00:54:37,771 --> 00:54:40,030
who's a fighter pilot,
uh,

1096
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,060
has a cholesterol 1:40
to 1:50

1097
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:47,090
and he ended up having open heart 
surgery because his cholesterol is 

1098
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:49,560
calcium count was greater than 2000.
Mine was zero.

1099
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,840
His was greater than 2000,
less than 100.

1100
00:54:51,841 --> 00:54:53,370
Great.
Greater than 400 dangerous.

1101
00:54:53,371 --> 00:54:58,371
He was greater than 2000.
He had 95 percent occlusion of the main 

1102
00:54:58,371 --> 00:55:02,781
artery.
The left anterior descending ends up 

1103
00:55:02,781 --> 00:55:03,810
having open heart surgery and you know,
hard to re replaced from his leg.

1104
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,460
How do you account for it?

1105
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:10,460
Well,
we went back and we did a series of 

1106
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:10,460
tests which were gifted by this 
laboratory.

1107
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:14,701
I work within Florida,
which called the [inaudible] that looks 

1108
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:17,721
at the inflammatory markers,
inflammation markers that lead to heart 

1109
00:55:17,721 --> 00:55:18,950
disease.
So something called pla.

1110
00:55:18,951 --> 00:55:21,120
See small density,
ldl,

1111
00:55:21,121 --> 00:55:22,830
homocysteine,
c reactive protein.

1112
00:55:22,831 --> 00:55:27,831
There's a whole group of chemistry that 
causes inflammation to lead to the 

1113
00:55:27,831 --> 00:55:31,500
hardening of the arteries in the body,
responds by putting calcium down.

1114
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:35,340
That's the atherosclerotic lesions to 
try and work like a bandaid.

1115
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:36,810
And,
um,

1116
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:39,540
what spinoff that you've heard of 
culation therapy?

1117
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,850
Well,
culation therapy for many years has been

1118
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:44,400
pooh poohed by medical community.
In three years ago,

1119
00:55:44,401 --> 00:55:46,170
the federal government did a study and 
what did they say?

1120
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,830
Culation therapy works.
What is culation therapy relationship is

1121
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,010
a two levels of it.
One is to remove all the toxins from the

1122
00:55:53,011 --> 00:55:58,011
body.
Our focus was to try and remove the 

1123
00:55:58,011 --> 00:56:00,651
castle calcium deposition of in the 
arteries and use calcium edta,

1124
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:05,850
sodium edta,
festival title coleen chemicals that 

1125
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:05,850
remove it.

1126
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:05,850
There's a,
a,

1127
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:08,430
another product which is called k one,
two,

1128
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:09,270
three,
and seven,

1129
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:14,600
which helped to remove calcium 
deposition from the lining of the 

1130
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,690
arteries.
So if you can remove the calcification,

1131
00:56:15,691 --> 00:56:20,430
you improve the atherosclerotic lesions 
that narrowed the blood vessels and lead

1132
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:23,710
spasming and inflammation that calls and
cholesterol.

1133
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:28,770
Cholesterol is has two major functions.
One is to supply the cells with the 

1134
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:33,260
precursor to all our hormones except 
growth hormone and so forth and thyroid 

1135
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:37,950
and all the sex hormones,
and also to repair the wall of the 

1136
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:43,291
arteries and studies that were done 
where they took a whole bunch of stuff 

1137
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:43,630
like trans fatty acids,
nicotine,

1138
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:45,400
sugar,
uric acid,

1139
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,570
cholesterol,
c,

1140
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:48,350
reactive protein,
testosterone,

1141
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,280
estrogen.
They put it in cultures of the lining of

1142
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:56,281
the arteries called endothelia.
The only one that didn't cause 

1143
00:56:56,281 --> 00:56:58,210
inflammation was cholesterol.
Wow.

1144
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,910
Wow.
And then a lot of articles you know that

1145
00:57:00,911 --> 00:57:04,120
talk about this,
the myth of a cholesterol myth,

1146
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:09,121
and that's what I see.
Otherwise I have hardening of the 

1147
00:57:09,121 --> 00:57:10,990
arteries,
but my genetics on this panel that we do

1148
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:14,230
an lp six,
all my inflammatory markers are low.

1149
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,760
My cholesterol is high in keith.
His inflammatory markers are high,

1150
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:20,110
but with low cholesterol.

1151
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:25,650
And so is this just a legacy?
Diagnosis is just something that we've 

1152
00:57:25,781 --> 00:57:29,050
said for so many years.
The cholesterol causes heart attacks and

1153
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:34,290
it just imprinted in our brains.
I do remember when people say sodium 

1154
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:37,100
causes high blood pressure,
but if you have no fucking salts,

1155
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,090
a mineral,
goddammit,

1156
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,060
it's an important part of your body like
you.

1157
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:42,010
You need salt,
you need certain amount of it.

1158
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:47,060
Correct,
and I think they're making generic 

1159
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,701
statements where they're selective.
It should be selective in certain 

1160
00:57:49,701 --> 00:57:50,580
people.
Sodium might be bad in certain people.

1161
00:57:50,581 --> 00:57:53,100
Cholesterol might might be bad.
I don't see it

1162
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:58,230
wasn't that sodium.
The whole diagnosis of sodium causing 

1163
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:02,911
all these health problems.
Wasn't that like inherently flawed in 

1164
00:58:02,911 --> 00:58:02,911
the first place?

1165
00:58:02,911 --> 00:58:03,490
Yes.
What was that?

1166
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,160
Did you remember what it was 
specifically,

1167
00:58:06,161 --> 00:58:10,900
but they were saying that overload of 
salt in certain racial groups.

1168
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:11,820
Can I say that?
Yes.

1169
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,900
You don't say the blacks.
Okay,

1170
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:15,190
fine.
Then I won't say that.

1171
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:20,220
I'll say in certain racial groups 
they've always been known to be more 

1172
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,671
susceptible to a kidney related issues 
and fluid retention on sodium,

1173
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:27,580
so it predisposes them to enlargement of
the heart,

1174
00:58:27,581 --> 00:58:30,700
congestive heart failure,
fluid retention in high blood pressure.

1175
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:36,060
So in treating certain racial groups,
use diuretics that make you go pee to 

1176
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:41,041
lose the fluid and the blood and other 
groups use beta blockers to relax the 

1177
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:45,450
contraction of the heart,
other ones to stretched the blood 

1178
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:46,690
vessels and so forth.
So every,

1179
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:51,910
um,
genetic predisposition has a specific 

1180
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:54,250
kind of medication that works best.
So you can't ubiquitously say,

1181
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:55,780
okay,
everybody needs a stat and drug.

1182
00:58:55,781 --> 00:58:58,540
Everybody needs water pill,
everybody needs a beta blocker.

1183
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:03,930
You have to be very selective and this 
is what's being lost as matthew 

1184
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:06,310
experience in his experience.
You walk in wiTh any of his symptoms and

1185
00:59:06,311 --> 00:59:11,311
everybody gets on a prepaid prepaid 
package of medication instead of 

1186
00:59:11,311 --> 00:59:14,470
individualizing what he needs.
He just needed a blood test,

1187
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:19,820
a $179 blood test to look at just his 
testosterone related issues and find out

1188
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:22,160
he was deficient and replace

1189
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:22,840
it.
Any.

1190
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,040
Are you still on your medication?
Any medication?

1191
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:31,030
Nope.
You're on off everything you go through 

1192
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:33,410
withdrawal will that morphine and uh,
I'm sure it's been awhile,

1193
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:37,160
but I know I still take oxycodone and 
they come down to um,

1194
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,060
between two and three pills a day.
So it's five,

1195
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:40,850
three,
25.

1196
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,230
How many were you on at the peak?
Eight a day.

1197
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,880
A day to day.
And that's with morphie?

1198
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:48,410
Um,
I was on four day.

1199
00:59:48,411 --> 00:59:51,530
And then you're still taking oxycodone 
for pain?

1200
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:52,370
I do,
yeah.

1201
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,080
And what is the,
what,

1202
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,250
what is causing your pain?
Um,

1203
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,020
well,
my gunshot wound in my leg,

1204
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:58,700
uh,
developed compartment syndrome in there.

1205
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:04,180
So essentially I guess the easiest way 
to describe that as the blood goes into 

1206
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,620
the tissue,
it doesn't have anywhere to go.

1207
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:09,500
So the pressure builds up and it starts 
breaking down muscle,

1208
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,930
a muscle tissue and it's painful.

1209
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:16,010
Um,
I have six titanium bolts in my jaw from

1210
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:21,011
one of the explosion,
so I have a lot of joint issues and I 

1211
01:00:21,011 --> 01:00:21,650
took shrapnel in the side by my ear 
canal.

1212
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,320
So I just have joint pain from all the 
movement.

1213
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,050
Um,
yeah,

1214
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:28,730
just stuff like,
I mean it's not,

1215
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:31,460
I'm not near where I was.
I mean I have arthritis,

1216
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,110
things like that.
Um,

1217
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:37,190
But yeah,
I mean I think I was on fentanyl 25.

1218
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,900
Was it micrograms I think is what it 
was.

1219
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:43,901
Twenty five milligrams every three days.
So it was a patch of morphine and was 

1220
01:00:43,901 --> 01:00:48,791
I'm 40 milligrams a day I believe 
because I think they're 20 milligram 

1221
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:49,070
pills.
I'd have to remember that.

1222
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:52,940
And then oxycodone was a five,
3:25

1223
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:57,500
and I was on eight of those and then.
So now I'm down to no fentanyl,

1224
01:00:57,501 --> 01:00:59,950
no morphine and uh,
just three.

1225
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:03,350
Oxy was a day and it seems to me,
I mean I'm ignorant to this,

1226
01:01:03,351 --> 01:01:08,351
but that still seems like a lot of pain 
medication for your body to absorb and 

1227
01:01:08,351 --> 01:01:08,870
process is that.
It is a lot,

1228
01:01:08,871 --> 01:01:13,871
but you know,
he's got a detox and then you can go 

1229
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:13,871
through cold Turkey.

1230
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:20,350
So I've been on um,
the testosterone replacement a little 

1231
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:24,791
over three months and from there I went 
from um,

1232
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:30,560
I got off the fentanyl a little bit 
before I started that because I just,

1233
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,960
I couldn't function with that and 
there's too,

1234
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:34,700
too high.
Not high,

1235
01:01:34,701 --> 01:01:36,650
but I didn't feel high because I was in 
pain,

1236
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:40,970
but I felt down like a suppressed 
immunosuppressed I guess,

1237
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:46,030
something like that.
So I went off the morphine and then 

1238
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:49,100
within three months I went from eight 
oxies down to three and so,

1239
01:01:49,101 --> 01:01:52,310
I mean it could be two or three,
just kind of depends how I am during the

1240
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:57,310
day.
So I might take one in the morning when 

1241
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,811
I wake up and then maybe one at night.
And is the goal to eVentually eliminate 

1242
01:01:58,811 --> 01:01:59,210
that completely?
Yes.

1243
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:04,360
Yeah.
Hopefully three months Is a pretty 

1244
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:04,360
significant improvement.
I mean,

1245
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,960
that's amazing.
It's such a short period of time.

1246
01:02:05,961 --> 01:02:08,450
That's the pain meds.
That's even the antidepressants,

1247
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:11,150
anti anxiety.
I mean it's all this stuff.

1248
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:13,210
I mean,
the only thing that's left out of like a

1249
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:17,950
12 medication panel is literally just 
the three pain meds.

1250
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:18,980
How,
how did it,

1251
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,760
your relationship at home and you have 
kids almost impersonal.

1252
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:26,940
I mean this is what we got divorced.
So that.

1253
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:28,400
Yeah,
that end you have,

1254
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,180
you have a couple kids,
right?

1255
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:32,310
Yeah.
Um,

1256
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:34,490
yeah.
I mean I'm,

1257
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,060
yeah,
I mean we're divorced.

1258
01:02:37,061 --> 01:02:38,980
I mean I interact with,
uh,

1259
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:41,190
with my ex every day,
but

1260
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:42,370
um,

1261
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:46,010
I'm pretty sure she's got a bitter taste
left in her mouth.

1262
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,710
But does it,
um,

1263
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,820
maybe that was the wrong way to phrase 
the question,

1264
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:54,850
how has it affected your ability to like
deal with day life stuff?

1265
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:57,560
Yeah,
it's much better.

1266
01:02:57,561 --> 01:03:02,561
I mean,
it's hard to even describe it because 

1267
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:02,561
it's so normal.
I mean,

1268
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:03,590
I feel so normal now to where it's not 
an issue.

1269
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:04,560
Um,

1270
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:10,510
I mean I'm not having that issue of just
the biggest thing for me I think was um,

1271
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:13,930
the ability to let go when things are 
upsetting,

1272
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:18,960
you know,
little things that people everyday just 

1273
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:18,960
tap in this part of life.
Whereas for me,

1274
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,790
it was end of the world and you know,
I want to tear things down.

1275
01:03:21,791 --> 01:03:23,320
We're now at,
just kind of goes off.

1276
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:28,660
Um,
my interactions with the ex have been 

1277
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:28,660
better.
There's a lot of hurt there.

1278
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:32,970
So that comes out sometimes and on both 
sides because a lot of mistakes were 

1279
01:03:34,361 --> 01:03:36,910
made in anger or in pain.
And,

1280
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:39,970
you know,
that's for me right now,

1281
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:45,270
the big thing is physically I'm getting 
to where I want to be and I'm getting,

1282
01:03:46,241 --> 01:03:46,750
you know,
I'm not,

1283
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:50,620
I'm not 100 percent there,
but I'm 80 percent physically where,

1284
01:03:50,621 --> 01:03:54,070
where I want to be and you know,
I still got a little ways to go.

1285
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:58,440
Now the second half of that will be 
working mentally tr,

1286
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:03,510
trying to figure out what it is I need 
to do to mentally get 100 percent 

1287
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:04,060
clarity of where,

1288
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:04,870
um,

1289
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:11,220
I can think is clearly as possible and 
deal with any of the things that have 

1290
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:14,581
happened,
whether a pre military military and 

1291
01:04:14,581 --> 01:04:17,731
after.
And it is going to be a challenge 

1292
01:04:17,731 --> 01:04:17,731
because,
you know,

1293
01:04:17,731 --> 01:04:18,250
I'm trying to heal broken relationships,
you know,

1294
01:04:18,251 --> 01:04:19,870
my wife,
my ex and I,

1295
01:04:19,871 --> 01:04:22,180
um,
she's with someone and very happy.

1296
01:04:22,181 --> 01:04:23,860
So does nothIng there.

1297
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:24,780
Um,

1298
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:26,950
I'll always love her.
You know,

1299
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:30,400
she was the only woman I've ever loved.
And so that's there.

1300
01:04:30,401 --> 01:04:35,401
But I want the best for her and it 
wasn't with me at that time and she's 

1301
01:04:35,401 --> 01:04:38,710
moved on and that's okay.
It wasn't okay for me beforehand because

1302
01:04:38,711 --> 01:04:42,160
I mentally couldn't brought us it,
whereas now I can look at it objectively

1303
01:04:42,161 --> 01:04:44,200
and say,
I get it.

1304
01:04:44,201 --> 01:04:45,850
I just want you to be happy and that's 
awesome,

1305
01:04:45,851 --> 01:04:46,990
man.
Good for you.

1306
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,060
But it's an attitude that,
man,

1307
01:04:49,061 --> 01:04:51,060
I wish more people would take,
but it's not.

1308
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:52,660
It's not easy.
Yeah.

1309
01:04:52,661 --> 01:04:54,100
That's incredible.
That's not easy.

1310
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:59,370
Now,
how many other people have you turned 

1311
01:04:59,370 --> 01:04:59,370
onto this?
I mean,

1312
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:02,790
you,
you must know other guys that are 

1313
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:02,790
suffering from similar conditions or at 
least you suspect they might be.

1314
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,120
Sure.
Um,

1315
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:08,230
that's this process right now.
It's part of coming on the show is we're

1316
01:05:08,231 --> 01:05:13,030
creating a dialogue as we would like to 
say Because no one knows us.

1317
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:14,950
We want to empower veterans to be able 
to say,

1318
01:05:14,951 --> 01:05:19,951
hey,
go into their doctor and with something 

1319
01:05:19,951 --> 01:05:19,951
just to say,
hey,

1320
01:05:19,951 --> 01:05:22,570
can you do this?
Because now they don't know.

1321
01:05:22,571 --> 01:05:27,571
And if they know they can at least start
something or contact me or maybe jason 

1322
01:05:28,241 --> 01:05:33,241
now or Dr.
Gordon and just get some kind of info 

1323
01:05:33,241 --> 01:05:33,241
and get it going.
Um,

1324
01:05:33,241 --> 01:05:34,180
and that's the thing,
you know,

1325
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:40,260
we're kind of limited because it's 
almost like there's just a handful of 

1326
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:43,681
people that are doing this Dr.
Gordon and then a few doctors that he's 

1327
01:05:43,681 --> 01:05:43,681
trained and gone over and,
you know,

1328
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,720
they're not,
they're not in every state and every 

1329
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,300
city and every va in every practice.

1330
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,900
It seems like they're getting an attack 
to me.

1331
01:05:51,901 --> 01:05:52,310
I mean,
I,

1332
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:57,360
I got introduced at a naval special 
warfare event to a guy who's doing some 

1333
01:05:57,421 --> 01:06:00,420
of this work down in Texas that kerrick 
and,

1334
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,480
you know,
you,

1335
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,270
you look him up and people are attacking
him and no,

1336
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:09,270
this and that.
And it was getting attacked by a doctor.

1337
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:14,310
Other doctors,
people saying they were licensed to do 

1338
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:16,851
this or,
or it's experimental medicine or you 

1339
01:06:16,851 --> 01:06:16,851
know,
these kinds of.

1340
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:22,340
yeah,
nothing that we're doing is 

1341
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:23,661
experimental.
It's all written about doctors are 

1342
01:06:23,661 --> 01:06:23,661
treating it whether they know it or not,
you know,

1343
01:06:23,661 --> 01:06:28,450
they're,
they're treating patients who are 

1344
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:28,450
testosterone deficient.
They never go into great depth.

1345
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:33,171
Ask them their history because I know I 
get a lot of patients coming from other 

1346
01:06:33,171 --> 01:06:37,880
men's clinics type of organizations and 
there was a guy recently who wanted to 

1347
01:06:38,431 --> 01:06:43,431
transfer from his organization whereas 
from his clinic to us and I asked them 

1348
01:06:43,621 --> 01:06:48,621
to send a copy of his original labs and 
to make sure it wasn't about using 

1349
01:06:48,621 --> 01:06:49,800
steroids for bodybuilding or something 
of that nature.

1350
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:53,580
And he sent to the lab silver and 
screaming on the lab results.

1351
01:06:53,581 --> 01:06:58,581
Very limited but significant enough you 
can see that he had traumatic brain 

1352
01:06:58,581 --> 01:06:58,650
injury in the past.
So I called them up,

1353
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:02,520
use 41 years of age,
called him up and introduced myself.

1354
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,460
And I said,
um,

1355
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:05,790
uh,
were you ever in an accident?

1356
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:06,360
He said,
yeah.

1357
01:07:06,361 --> 01:07:11,361
At 18 years of age he was broadsided on 
the car and his head whip lash and hit 

1358
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:15,441
the glass and broke the glass window.
So we need to go and do a better job at 

1359
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:20,550
history relative to traumatic brain 
injury.

1360
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:25,790
We're finding people who have hormonal 
deficiency and never ask about their 

1361
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:30,651
history or someone comes into their doc 
because they're depressed and the first 

1362
01:07:30,651 --> 01:07:32,040
thing they do is they put them on drugs 
instead of asking them,

1363
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:36,150
have you had any head traumas or any 
slip and falls or anything?

1364
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:37,730
well,
there's that delay effect too.

1365
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:42,740
It doesn't have to be wrecked car onset,
so when you go in there with this 

1366
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:43,200
problem,
no one's thinking to go,

1367
01:07:43,201 --> 01:07:44,310
hey,
did you have this?

1368
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:46,140
Because it might have happened 10 years 
ago,

1369
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:51,610
and so that's an issue with fighters.
It's a big issue with fighters where I 

1370
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,920
see guys who have retired and then even 
though they've retired,

1371
01:07:53,921 --> 01:07:58,080
like say if they're retiring like 2010,
you will see them three,

1372
01:07:58,081 --> 01:08:03,081
four years later with no fights at all.
They have deteriorated significantly 

1373
01:08:03,081 --> 01:08:04,650
over that period of time,
like what it is.

1374
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:07,050
How long does it take?
I've heard 10 years.

1375
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:11,350
It can be up to 17 is an article that 
came out just recently that said that it

1376
01:08:11,351 --> 01:08:16,351
can take 17 years and it might be that 
all their fights brought them up to the 

1377
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:21,440
edge and then something silly like 
getting into a automobile accident,

1378
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:23,990
five to seven miles an hour,
push them over the edge.

1379
01:08:23,991 --> 01:08:28,991
We had someone in san diego,
they had traumatic brain injury from a 

1380
01:08:28,991 --> 01:08:31,820
five to seven mile an hour rear end,
but they've had history of trauma in the

1381
01:08:31,821 --> 01:08:36,821
past.
It's just how much of the hormone may 

1382
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:38,720
lou do you have to lose before you flip 
into symptoms?

1383
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:40,310
You know,
we have a lot of reserves,

1384
01:08:40,311 --> 01:08:43,160
systems In our body,
a growth hormone reserve,

1385
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:48,161
and when you lose that reserve,
you start deteriorating from growth 

1386
01:08:48,161 --> 01:08:49,010
hormone deficiency with same thing with 
testosterone,

1387
01:08:49,011 --> 01:08:50,090
estrogen,
all the hormones.

1388
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:55,091
We have a reserved mechanism where 
there's a little bit hanging around and 

1389
01:08:55,091 --> 01:08:55,730
when you lose that reserve,
um,

1390
01:08:56,090 --> 01:09:01,090
you lose the battle.
You then become a susceptible to all the

1391
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,150
situation,
you know,

1392
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:04,490
the depression,
the fatigue and so forth that occur.

1393
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,880
And how'd you get.
How'd you guys all get involved 

1394
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:09,880
together?
How did jason get into this?

1395
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:09,880
I looked him up.

1396
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:13,590
You didn't look me up,
looked you up on the internet.

1397
01:09:13,591 --> 01:09:14,350
Did you really?
Yeah.

1398
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,610
What would,
what did you put in Mark Gordon or what?

1399
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:17,890
No,
I just,

1400
01:09:17,891 --> 01:09:18,640
you know,
I've been,

1401
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:23,370
I've been hanging out with these guys.
I looked up ptsd,

1402
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:26,750
hormone therapy and your name came up,
you know,

1403
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:29,860
a tbi,
ptsd hormone therapy.

1404
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:34,910
Okay.
And how did you hear about the hormone 

1405
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:34,910
therapy?
I've heard of some,

1406
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:39,180
some pretty well known a navy seal's 
going out and getting this therapy that 

1407
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:44,340
clearly wasn't available to the army 
guys I was talking to who have never 

1408
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,690
heard of this at all in any way,
shape or form.

1409
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:48,340
And uh,
you know,

1410
01:09:48,341 --> 01:09:50,260
because this guy had some ways and means
and,

1411
01:09:50,261 --> 01:09:51,730
and was,
was known.

1412
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,150
he was able to go get this therapy and 
is able to go get it and you know,

1413
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:58,450
it significantly helped his,
his quality of life.

1414
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,210
And so to me,
you know,

1415
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:08,190
this,
this movie that we made is about a guy 

1416
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:08,230
who's,
who makes this huge sacrifice,

1417
01:10:08,231 --> 01:10:10,870
you know,
when he sacrifices spiritually,

1418
01:10:10,871 --> 01:10:12,160
mentally,
hIs family,

1419
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,290
everything for his beliefs.

1420
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:17,560
And he comes home and he's,
he's got to fight another war,

1421
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:23,070
you know,
this guy fought as hard to get home as 

1422
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:25,291
he fought over there and uh,
and I just feel like we're looking at 

1423
01:10:25,961 --> 01:10:29,710
this thing and it's kinda like the 
public is just standing outside of glass

1424
01:10:29,711 --> 01:10:32,020
and banging their head on it.
everyone's like,

1425
01:10:32,021 --> 01:10:33,910
well,
why are these guys shootIng themselves?

1426
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:36,700
They hear the statistic that are like,
why are these guys putting guns in their

1427
01:10:36,701 --> 01:10:37,510
mouth?
So I don't get it.

1428
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:42,720
They're not even asking that question.
Just the general public is completely 

1429
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:42,820
ignorant to it.
I mean,

1430
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:47,821
the average person you walked down the 
street and say how many soldiers killed 

1431
01:10:47,821 --> 01:10:48,250
themselves?
They would have no idea that it would be

1432
01:10:48,251 --> 01:10:53,251
as many,
if not more than that stigma I was 

1433
01:10:53,251 --> 01:10:56,131
telling you about.
You say you have ptsd or something and 

1434
01:10:56,131 --> 01:10:56,131
they meet,
whoa,

1435
01:10:56,131 --> 01:10:57,190
we need to lock you up.
You know,

1436
01:10:57,191 --> 01:10:59,410
there's that mentality that now you're 
dangerous.

1437
01:10:59,411 --> 01:11:01,540
And it's so.
I think they,

1438
01:11:01,541 --> 01:11:02,100
it's,
you know,

1439
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:03,890
ignorance is bliss.
Let's just snow.

1440
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,790
It's hard to talk about.
It's hard to like,

1441
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,360
it's hard to dig in,
you know?

1442
01:11:07,361 --> 01:11:09,700
And it's hard to,
we have this thing where we're like,

1443
01:11:09,701 --> 01:11:13,440
thank you for your service and it's the 
polite thing say,

1444
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:13,980
and it kind of

1445
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,900
also puts a hand up at the same time.
You're like,

1446
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:19,050
thanks for your service.
I don't really want to know what you saw

1447
01:11:19,051 --> 01:11:20,730
or what you did,
you know.

1448
01:11:20,731 --> 01:11:22,770
And a lot of the guys correct me if I'm 
wrong,

1449
01:11:22,771 --> 01:11:24,450
who served or like,
hey,

1450
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:27,170
you wouldn't thank me if you knew what I
had to do here.

1451
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:28,480
You know?
And,

1452
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:29,760
and it's uh,
it,

1453
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,890
it kind of prevents conversation in a 
way.

1454
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:33,580
Well,
there's also that movement out there and

1455
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:35,380
it's not support the troops,
you know,

1456
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,510
and it kind of,
I mean,

1457
01:11:36,511 --> 01:11:39,330
I remember coming back a few times and 
seeing protests and it's,

1458
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,780
it doesn't anger me,
but it was a,

1459
01:11:41,781 --> 01:11:46,781
a situation of it's like you,
if you just knew this wouldn't be what 

1460
01:11:46,781 --> 01:11:51,561
you're doIng right now.
So convenient to protest it mean just 

1461
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:55,821
saying that you support the troops and 
just saying that you,

1462
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:01,040
you know,
you want them to come back home is 

1463
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:01,040
really support the troops come back 
home.

1464
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:01,980
But that's all.
That's very convenient.

1465
01:12:01,981 --> 01:12:03,240
It's very correct.
You know,

1466
01:12:03,241 --> 01:12:05,250
we all would like less war in this 
world,

1467
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:10,640
but the reality of supporting the troops
and the reality of the protesting as 

1468
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,331
you're dealing with these people that 
have gone through something that you're 

1469
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:16,731
never going to be able to comprehend,
it is absolutely impossible for you to 

1470
01:12:16,731 --> 01:12:19,971
be able to comprehend just 
psychologically what they're dealing 

1471
01:12:19,971 --> 01:12:22,551
with and to add in this physical aspect 
of it.

1472
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:25,170
The traumatic brain injury,
the loss of hormones,

1473
01:12:25,171 --> 01:12:29,940
the the loss of the ability to cope 
because of this hormonal deficiencies.

1474
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:35,090
There's so much going on.
there's so much going on and when you 

1475
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:35,820
see people protesting,
getting upset at troops,

1476
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:41,030
you're talking about kids.
You're talking about 18 year old kids 

1477
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:43,761
that are in unbelievably easily 
influenced that are sent over there and 

1478
01:12:43,761 --> 01:12:46,810
essentially brainwashed.
You're immediately thrown into your.

1479
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:51,840
You're thrown into these training 
courses that treat you how to block 

1480
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,530
things out,
how to become a trained killer,

1481
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,020
and then they come back and people want 
to protest against them.

1482
01:12:55,290 --> 01:13:00,290
Like what do you expect them to be 
unbelievably unique and be able to deal 

1483
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:05,181
with this and process it in some sort of
a strange and very unusual way where 

1484
01:13:05,181 --> 01:13:08,220
they don't they,
they become a conscientious objector.

1485
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:10,010
They step outside of it.
I mean,

1486
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:14,520
when I see people protesting the actual 
soldiers themselves,

1487
01:13:14,521 --> 01:13:17,310
it's very maddening because that could 
have been me.

1488
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:22,670
It could've been a lot of us.
It was you and it could have been 

1489
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:25,761
anybody who joins the military and that 
that shit drives me fucking crazy that 

1490
01:13:25,761 --> 01:13:28,020
you're blaming the soldiers for what 
happens.

1491
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:33,410
It's one of the,
one of the most infuriating things and 

1492
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:33,660
I've seen it time and time again.

1493
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:38,840
It's so easy to do and it's so short 
sighted when there's also no course when

1494
01:13:39,391 --> 01:13:40,220
you get,
when you're getting.

1495
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:41,280
I mean really,
there's no.

1496
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,740
I mean they do all these training things
to help you deal with getting out,

1497
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:49,010
but there's no like magic course that 
you take and all of a sudden you can 

1498
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:49,010
fucking deal with life again.
I mean,

1499
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:51,870
you're used to a structured life almost 
every day.

1500
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:54,660
Have you do this at 6:00
in the morning?

1501
01:13:54,661 --> 01:13:56,310
You do this at 10:00
in the morning,

1502
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:57,390
you do,
you do this,

1503
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,850
you eat here,
you eat when they tell you this much,

1504
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:04,851
you do this,
and then you go over there and you're 

1505
01:14:04,851 --> 01:14:04,851
doIng the same kind of.
You do these routines,

1506
01:14:04,851 --> 01:14:08,721
you do these routines and then you get 
out and you're literally left to just 

1507
01:14:08,721 --> 01:14:10,320
fucking figure it out.
Guys say that about prison as well.

1508
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:11,230
Yeah.
Well why?

1509
01:14:11,231 --> 01:14:12,190
A lot of guys want to go back

1510
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:16,060
to prison.
I mean I've known people who have gotten

1511
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:21,061
out,
couldn't handle it and went back in 

1512
01:14:21,061 --> 01:14:21,061
because they were so used to that 
structure life.

1513
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:26,130
It almost is that kind of indoctrination
of when you're 18 in a way because 

1514
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:26,530
that's all they've known and they're 
still babies at 18.

1515
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:27,540
They don't,
you know,

1516
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:32,560
maybe that's just how life was.
That's just what they know and they go 

1517
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:32,710
back and it's comfortable.
It's comfortable.

1518
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:38,700
Yeah.
Three or four years ago they had a 

1519
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:42,181
strategy.
Anyone coming into the military had to 

1520
01:14:42,181 --> 01:14:44,320
go through assessment and then when they
exit they're supposed to go through some

1521
01:14:44,321 --> 01:14:46,710
kind of exit assessment.
Is thAt being done?

1522
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:49,840
Don't know.
You don't know collIns,

1523
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:51,220
I think doing it,
yeah,

1524
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:56,240
you always go in with some kind of a,
a basic assessment physically just to 

1525
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,780
see if you meet certain criteria.
Um,

1526
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,520
but when you get out,
I mean,

1527
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:07,480
so as like a person who is in charge of 
most of the team's health type of thing.

1528
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:10,390
You do like physicals,
you do their lab work,

1529
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:13,750
you do all this stuff for them.
But um,

1530
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:15,520
yeah,
I mean if it checks out,

1531
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:16,510
you just go,
okay,

1532
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:17,500
you're good to go.
I mean,

1533
01:15:17,501 --> 01:15:22,501
you're not,
I'm not doing anything extensive that 

1534
01:15:22,501 --> 01:15:25,800
needs to be done.
Do they give you any psychological 

1535
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,950
counseling about like how to reintegrate
to society,

1536
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:31,951
how to deal with protests,
how to deal with people calling you a 

1537
01:15:31,951 --> 01:15:33,070
baby killer or whatever the fuck 
Vietnam?

1538
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,120
Uh,
I,

1539
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:37,120
no,
not you go through like things where you

1540
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:42,540
have classes,
like when you're a pqs and out or 

1541
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:42,630
however you want to call it.
Um,

1542
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:44,800
that just,
you know,

1543
01:15:44,801 --> 01:15:49,801
that teach you basic skills to how to 
get out of reintegrate into the world,

1544
01:15:51,101 --> 01:15:55,090
but I mean it's very basic on like you 
can learn like job skills.

1545
01:15:55,091 --> 01:16:00,091
I mean,
I didn't personally do any of those 

1546
01:16:00,091 --> 01:16:00,091
courses.

1547
01:16:00,091 --> 01:16:02,280
I did different things,
but they have these things for them and 

1548
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:02,280
you go through these things but nothing 
like.

1549
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:06,190
And can you train anyone really to how 
to deal with being called a baby killer?

1550
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:07,270
I mean,
you can't,

1551
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:08,710
I guess.
I mean you just,

1552
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:11,200
I don't know.
Well yeah,

1553
01:16:11,201 --> 01:16:16,201
we put all this money into training them
to fight it and then no money into 

1554
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:18,340
training them to find peace.
It's a very good way of putting it.

1555
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,680
Yeah.
The internal piece that they need,

1556
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:22,780
that we need.
And there's this uh,

1557
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,040
I don't know,
you know,

1558
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:25,990
I look at the met,
I've been doing a lot of thinking of the

1559
01:16:25,991 --> 01:16:30,991
medication lately and stuff like that,
just because I can't believe everything 

1560
01:16:30,991 --> 01:16:32,320
that I've been given and you know,
it is,

1561
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:37,321
it's like there's a market in this ptsd 
thing right now and it's just like 

1562
01:16:37,321 --> 01:16:37,420
everyone's coming back.

1563
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:39,430
If you have this symptom or that 
symptom,

1564
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:43,330
you go in there and you fall under this 
blanket of that and they're,

1565
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:48,510
they're gonna put you in there and 
you're not getting out of it because no 

1566
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:51,790
one's going to look any farther than 
that and that past to change.

1567
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:56,820
They,
they're treating everything backwards 

1568
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:56,820
and so who knows,
man,

1569
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,020
that's the info.
Just needs to get out there.

1570
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:01,180
Well,
I think this is going to help,

1571
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:03,130
but obviously it helped you the first 
time.

1572
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:08,160
I'm Dr.
Gordon talked about it in the podcast 

1573
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:08,160
that you heard.
For sure.

1574
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:12,271
Yeah,
I mean I deeply indebted that you have 

1575
01:17:12,271 --> 01:17:14,501
people on here that are coming in and 
sharing new ideas or just things that 

1576
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,530
people need to hear.
Um,

1577
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:18,140
yeah.
I mean this.

1578
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,550
Yeah.
I have no idea.

1579
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:24,551
I mean I could be dead right now if that
hadn't happened because I mean let's be 

1580
01:17:24,551 --> 01:17:28,961
frank are probably would be dead and 
that in a way probably needed to happen 

1581
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:33,790
for me to get enough courage to say this
is something I need to try.

1582
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:34,760
I mean,
I had nothing,

1583
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:39,790
nothing to lose by applying or nothing 
to lose about coming down here and just 

1584
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:44,060
seeing what was going on and trying 
nothing to lose.

1585
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:48,260
And the problem right now is we need to 
get money so that we can help people.

1586
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:51,350
We need funding,
we need to get the word out there.

1587
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:56,650
Um,
we're trying to get a non charitable 

1588
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:57,950
going so that we can get donations,
things like that.

1589
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,790
Um,
you've been a nonprofit five,

1590
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:01,470
zero,
one c,

1591
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:06,630
three non charitable or thinking of 
charity in my head and I'm just so 

1592
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:11,630
people can get money because how many 
people are on a waiting list

1593
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:15,970
right now?
We have about 28 and we just got another

1594
01:18:15,971 --> 01:18:20,971
to sober up to 30.
ThAt's just your practice and how many 

1595
01:18:20,971 --> 01:18:22,150
people like you are doing this all over 
the country.

1596
01:18:22,151 --> 01:18:23,770
We not just know fornia,
no one.

1597
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:28,860
Jesus jason looked.
I've got a couple of people who have 

1598
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:31,471
looked.
There's no one else doing it and now 

1599
01:18:31,471 --> 01:18:33,190
they're doing some very basic hormone 
because since 2004,

1600
01:18:33,191 --> 01:18:38,191
I've been going around the world 
lecturing on traumatic brain injury and 

1601
01:18:38,191 --> 01:18:40,090
hormone deficiency syndrome,
but it doesn't have the nuances that are

1602
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:41,680
in there,
so they start off by giving.

1603
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:46,710
Just to start from.
One of the issues with just giving 

1604
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:47,680
testosterone is we have a mechanism in 
our body.

1605
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:51,490
If you give a hormone or a chemical into
the body that's normally there,

1606
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,970
it shuts off the origin of that 
chemical.

1607
01:18:53,971 --> 01:18:58,240
So upstream precursors are shut off.
So in testosterone,

1608
01:18:58,241 --> 01:19:03,241
the two very important upstream 
precursors or pregnenolone and dah da.

1609
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
So it takes about four to six Months 
before you shut off those two and they 

1610
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,481
affect the brain.
So what you'll see in patients who are 

1611
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:14,821
just put on testosterone is that they'll
start complaining that they're not 

1612
01:19:14,821 --> 01:19:18,780
experiencing the same effect.
They're losing the benefit and the 

1613
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:20,020
commonest thing that's done is they 
increase the amount of testosterone,

1614
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:22,480
increased the amount of estrogen.
They get bitch tits,

1615
01:19:22,481 --> 01:19:23,190
and they get,
you know,

1616
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:26,170
feminine kind of attitudes and so forth.

1617
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,200
What are you trying to say by feminine?
Well,

1618
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,480
how dare you.
I've got three daughters,

1619
01:19:30,481 --> 01:19:32,540
you know,
what are you trying to say?

1620
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:35,370
You're going to get the feminist as 
well.

1621
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:38,580
As long as they're pretty.
That's pretty feminists.

1622
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:42,570
You just said jumbo tron,
military intelligence.

1623
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:48,860
So I think it took huge balls for you to
come down here and do this too.

1624
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:51,280
I had no idea.
Was was

1625
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:52,400
three months.
Like.

1626
01:19:52,401 --> 01:19:53,900
Honestly,
that's fucking awesome.

1627
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:58,180
It think that's a success story,
but you know,

1628
01:19:58,181 --> 01:20:03,181
it's just how many other people do we 
need to have the same thing so they can 

1629
01:20:03,181 --> 01:20:05,180
wake up and there's guys,
there's guys out there suffering,

1630
01:20:05,181 --> 01:20:05,980
man,
you know,

1631
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:08,430
we have a captain families,
you know captain

1632
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:11,880
who is.
I'm 21 years after his initial,

1633
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,770
a traumatic brain injury and five weeks 
he was 70 percent better.

1634
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:22,040
He gets better.
He gets redeployed to Afghanistan 

1635
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,351
because he's better at for a year.
He comes back and he's up in the eightY 

1636
01:20:24,351 --> 01:20:27,000
percent improvement.
Ninety percent now he's been a have five

1637
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:32,001
shaped building in Washington over 
wherever he is and he's trying to help 

1638
01:20:32,001 --> 01:20:33,690
to find the avenue for us.
Because you know,

1639
01:20:33,691 --> 01:20:38,691
he's living,
breathing proof that what we do is it 

1640
01:20:38,691 --> 01:20:39,900
works and it is very simple basics,
back to the basics,

1641
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:44,100
replace the hormones that are deficient 
and protect the brain and it works.

1642
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:49,490
And the other thing is that we're 
missing or things like alzheimer's 

1643
01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:49,590
disease,
we talked about traumatic brain injury.

1644
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:54,620
We think it's just blunt injury to the 
head while ionizing radiation from 

1645
01:20:54,811 --> 01:20:57,090
excessive x-rays,
ct scans,

1646
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:02,360
regular dental x rays,
skull x rays can cause damage to the 

1647
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,570
control mechanism in the brain called 
the hypothalamus.

1648
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:09,200
I'm also subdural hematomas,
which is bleeding in the brain from 

1649
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,891
like,
boxing has now been associated with all 

1650
01:21:12,891 --> 01:21:15,531
the same symptoms and hormonal 
deficiencies akin to traumatic brain 

1651
01:21:15,531 --> 01:21:18,750
injury.
So strokes or it's another one,

1652
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,880
um,
surgery.

1653
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,020
Uh,
I have,

1654
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:27,060
uh,
one of the robin williams issue that 

1655
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:29,350
this is that now there was one article 
that came out that started looking at 

1656
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:29,940
this,
uh,

1657
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,000
where there are some 20,700
articles that had been written on.

1658
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:40,720
I knoW that because I use something 
called google scholar and it tells you 

1659
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:41,730
in zero point zero,
one seconds,

1660
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:42,900
it pulled up,
you know,

1661
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,720
20,700
articles and you put in,

1662
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:47,130
um,
cabbage,

1663
01:21:47,131 --> 01:21:50,010
which is coronary artery bypass graph 
and depression,

1664
01:21:50,011 --> 01:21:55,011
and you see 20,700
articles come up talking about 

1665
01:21:55,011 --> 01:21:56,740
postsurgical post heart surgery,
um,

1666
01:21:57,090 --> 01:22:02,090
depression and robin williams in 2009 
had a major heart surgery on an air 

1667
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:07,730
valve replacement.
And now what we're also finding is that 

1668
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:10,730
thyroid changes the thyroid production 
in the body changes after prolonged 

1669
01:22:10,730 --> 01:22:14,871
surgery and it generates a form of 
thyroid hormone that's inactive and 

1670
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:19,970
associated with low thyroid is 
depression associated with damage to the

1671
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:23,610
pituitary from prolonged surgery is 
hormonal shutdown.

1672
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,740
So I believe that it probably is,
you know,

1673
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:29,430
contributory,
especially when the pathologist came out

1674
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:33,540
and said that there were no drugs and no
medication,

1675
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,670
no alcohol,
no medication in his blood,

1676
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:41,450
but of course they're not going to look 
at the hormone may loop to see if there 

1677
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:44,841
was a deficiency.
Low levels of testosterone leads to 

1678
01:22:44,841 --> 01:22:46,200
depression,
and you can find a 70,000

1679
01:22:46,201 --> 01:22:51,201
articles in this chapter on 
neuropsychiatry and traumatic brain 

1680
01:22:51,201 --> 01:22:52,830
injury.
There are 432,000

1681
01:22:52,831 --> 01:22:55,890
articles on growth,
hormone deficiency and depression.

1682
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:59,520
There are 235,000
articles on thyroid.

1683
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:01,680
70,000
on testosterone,

1684
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:07,010
a dah da has about 17,000.
Estrogen has a large amount of 

1685
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:10,760
progesterone.
All have depression articles that have 

1686
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:14,101
been written since 2000 2013,
almost 850,000

1687
01:23:14,411 --> 01:23:16,420
articles.
What?

1688
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:17,770
No.
Instead just producing it.

1689
01:23:17,771 --> 01:23:20,620
They're just publishing them to publish 
it and no one's reading them.

1690
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:26,280
So essentially what we're dealing with 
when it comes to happiness and avoiding 

1691
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:30,541
depression is the entire body as a unit,
as an individual unit has to be 

1692
01:23:30,551 --> 01:23:31,120
balanced.

1693
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,590
Correct?
You have to be healthy,

1694
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:35,620
you have to have the proper nutrients,
you have to have rest and exercise,

1695
01:23:35,621 --> 01:23:37,810
and you have to have your hormones in 
line.

1696
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:43,080
If they are not in line,
you're going to deal with all sorts of 

1697
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:43,080
issues,
compensatory issues,

1698
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:48,510
depression,
the all the buffers that caused you to 

1699
01:23:48,581 --> 01:23:50,710
lash out,
to not lash out.

1700
01:23:50,711 --> 01:23:52,030
All those are gone,
correct?

1701
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:54,940
Yeah.
This is a crazy thing to talk about.

1702
01:23:54,941 --> 01:23:56,160
I'm starting to revenue,
but it's just.

1703
01:23:56,170 --> 01:24:01,170
It seems like there's a rush to get this
information out here while these 40 

1704
01:24:01,841 --> 01:24:06,841
soldiers of killing themselves a day and
we're just talking about soldiers were 

1705
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:07,150
not dealing with people in car 
accidents.

1706
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,830
People will kick box,
you know,

1707
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:11,530
the people have played football that are
all dealing with thiS.

1708
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:17,340
There's a lot going on here.
There's more than enough going on and 

1709
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:22,260
the resistance of the industry,
my industry and the medical industry is 

1710
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:24,640
what is perplexing on one part because 
we went through,

1711
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:27,250
you know,
medical school and hopefully we all read

1712
01:24:27,251 --> 01:24:32,251
the hippocratic oath and we're supposed 
to serve the betterment of humanity and 

1713
01:24:32,381 --> 01:24:36,790
trying to help fix them.
And I don't think that's being done.

1714
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:39,100
I don't think it's really being focused 
on.

1715
01:24:39,930 --> 01:24:44,930
I think unfortunately I believe that 
we're more pawns in a game of chess 

1716
01:24:45,191 --> 01:24:49,450
where pharmaceutical companies are 
dictating to the insurance companies.

1717
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:54,451
Insurance companies are dictating to 
both the patients and to the physicians 

1718
01:24:54,451 --> 01:24:57,571
on how to run medicine so that you walk 
into your office and you know you're no 

1719
01:24:57,571 --> 01:25:00,480
longer an individual,
you're just a number on a card,

1720
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:02,920
but the pen will dial bill.

1721
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:08,050
Yeah.
The people getting this treatment are 

1722
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:09,710
the rich 45 year old white guys who can 
afford it,

1723
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:15,550
who are all on testosterone,
who are all finding some benefit to 

1724
01:25:15,561 --> 01:25:16,460
their,
to their,

1725
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:17,750
to their body and mind,

1726
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:20,840
but even that is not being done 
correctly.

1727
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:23,360
It doesn't sound like it's being done 
correctly at all.

1728
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,210
It's they're doing it as an entry point.
I mean,

1729
01:25:26,211 --> 01:25:31,211
I've been giving classes on andropause 
which is testosterone deficiency amount 

1730
01:25:31,211 --> 01:25:35,051
of pause,
which is growth hormone deficiency and 

1731
01:25:35,051 --> 01:25:37,001
menopause and how to balance female 
hormones a little better since 2001 and 

1732
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:44,800
a lot of docs are listened to it.
A lot of docs went into the industry to 

1733
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,320
make money and therefore they go to one 
class,

1734
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:50,720
one class for three days,
like I just participated in and they 

1735
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,551
walk out and they are the expert.
I don't consider myself an expert on 

1736
01:25:54,551 --> 01:25:58,540
anything.
I think I know a little bit and try not 

1737
01:25:58,540 --> 01:25:59,720
to get in trouble by keep on reading so 
I know a little bit more.

1738
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:04,400
and what I do is I go out and I share 
this information I'm at and uh,

1739
01:26:04,401 --> 01:26:06,260
when I was in chicago at a,
you know,

1740
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:10,040
teaching in medical school there and 
that's just my personality.

1741
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:15,130
I read a lot and I find ways to deliver 
it so it's palatable and usable in a 

1742
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:18,530
very relatively short period of time.
But you have to change,

1743
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:20,720
you know,
unfortunately since 2008,

1744
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:25,750
everything is financially oriented.
So I've put my family life and the 

1745
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:30,671
quality of my life partially on the line
because I try to make it so that my 

1746
01:26:30,671 --> 01:26:34,910
office comes as close as possible to 
breaking even and my outside lecturing,

1747
01:26:34,911 --> 01:26:39,911
whatever is what really I get my sound.
You put in the wrong place,

1748
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:42,040
uh,
to,

1749
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:42,770
uh,
to,

1750
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:44,450
for,
to be able to do it.

1751
01:26:44,451 --> 01:26:46,070
And our pricing,
I mean,

1752
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,650
the laboratory tests,
uh,

1753
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,570
patients are paying a third of the 
average.

1754
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:55,571
I'm medical director of education for 
the laboratory in the lab has put a lot 

1755
01:26:55,571 --> 01:27:00,461
into what I do.
They support what I do by matching the 

1756
01:27:00,461 --> 01:27:03,911
funds that I personally put into it so 
that people like matt and I have some 

1757
01:27:03,911 --> 01:27:07,511
patients who are not in the military,
not in law enforcement and other areas 

1758
01:27:08,211 --> 01:27:13,211
of government government who are just 
great cases that I want to,

1759
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:17,090
you know,
I want to see it work and it works and I

1760
01:27:17,091 --> 01:27:17,810
can back this.

1761
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:22,810
I know you do this because I know you 
very well and this is a real labor of 

1762
01:27:22,810 --> 01:27:23,450
love for you.
This is a very important thing for you.

1763
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:25,730
This is not just lip service.
This is something that you've.

1764
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:31,060
From the moment I met you,
you've been very adamant about this and 

1765
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:34,750
it's because of guys like matthew and 
this is one of the reasons why you 

1766
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:37,961
wanted to bring matthew in here and you.
You contacted me right after he started 

1767
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:41,501
treating him and right after he started 
experiencing positive results and I 

1768
01:27:41,501 --> 01:27:41,950
could tell that this was something that 
was very important to you,

1769
01:27:41,951 --> 01:27:45,410
which is why we brought mathieu in here 
to discuss this.

1770
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:46,640
Right.
And I'll tell you,

1771
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:51,670
jason is in an arena where I've been 
trying diligently for the past three,

1772
01:27:52,011 --> 01:27:55,940
four years to get some champion for what
we're doing.

1773
01:27:55,941 --> 01:28:00,941
Someone in the entertainment world to 
step in and to pick this up and to 

1774
01:28:00,941 --> 01:28:02,810
spread the word to spread,
help spread the word,

1775
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:05,420
you know,
I think without saying their names,

1776
01:28:05,421 --> 01:28:07,790
some of the people in the industry that 
I,

1777
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:10,400
um,
I see I work with could do it,

1778
01:28:10,401 --> 01:28:15,401
but they don't want to be looked at as 
being out there on the fringe because 

1779
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:16,070
I'm.

1780
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:21,610
Even though I'm in core medicine,
everything I do is called evidence 

1781
01:28:21,610 --> 01:28:24,391
based.
Every single thing I do is An article 

1782
01:28:24,391 --> 01:28:24,890
and you know,
I have a collection of 7,000,

1783
01:28:24,891 --> 01:28:29,891
$400 articles that I've gone through in 
the past 10 years that address each 

1784
01:28:29,891 --> 01:28:30,620
area.
And you know,

1785
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,550
colleagues says,
you know,

1786
01:28:31,551 --> 01:28:36,551
I'd like to see an article on 
testosterone and heart with that 

1787
01:28:36,551 --> 01:28:38,120
craziness that was going on.
So I sent them my portfolio with,

1788
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:43,420
you know,
600 articles about heart and 

1789
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:44,150
testosterone and all the benefits.
So there are thousands of articles,

1790
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:49,180
benefit of testosterone in the heart,
and you come up with these three 

1791
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:51,941
bullshit articles that you know,
try to taint the benefits that 

1792
01:28:51,941 --> 01:28:53,000
testosterone.
And we had one of the,

1793
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:58,300
one of the top guys in harvard,
dr abraham mergenthaler wrote the book 

1794
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:01,710
testosterone for life that refutes 
testosterone causing cancer.

1795
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:06,711
He came to us in the beginning of the 
year to an organization called age 

1796
01:29:06,711 --> 01:29:10,761
management medical group and phenomenal 
dissertation on the bullshit of these 

1797
01:29:10,761 --> 01:29:12,510
articles showing that they show a three 
percent,

1798
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:15,840
they report a three percent increase in 
coronary artery disease,

1799
01:29:15,841 --> 01:29:20,790
greater heart attack onto stastrom when 
the actual statistic showed a 30 percent

1800
01:29:20,791 --> 01:29:25,791
improvement,
but the way they picked and choosed 

1801
01:29:25,791 --> 01:29:25,791
everything.

1802
01:29:25,791 --> 01:29:25,791
But hOw,
how is it the fringe?

1803
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:28,350
These guys don't want to be perceived as
being on the fringe,

1804
01:29:28,351 --> 01:29:30,570
but they're coming to you as patients.
Well,

1805
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:31,860
it's,
that's what I,

1806
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,570
you know,
personal and public,

1807
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:36,120
right?
It's about personal image and paulo,

1808
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:41,210
but how do you,
how do you push this thing across the 

1809
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:41,210
line so it's not fringe.

1810
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:45,340
I've been on the phone with them 
frequently trying to get them if they 

1811
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:46,970
don't want to stand up and be a 
participant,

1812
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:48,440
direct me to someone directly,

1813
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:50,590
stuff like this.
I think.

1814
01:29:51,490 --> 01:29:52,850
Yeah.
I think stuff like this,

1815
01:29:52,851 --> 01:29:55,040
especially something like this where 
it's a long form,

1816
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,930
uninterrupted conversation,
you could really get deep into the facts

1817
01:29:57,931 --> 01:29:59,810
and the reality and your anecdotal 
experience.

1818
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:01,600
Controversy is not new to you.
Yeah.

1819
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,520
Everything I do is controversial.
I don't worry about it.

1820
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:06,800
What's the hottest controversy are in 
right now?

1821
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:09,710
I don't know if it's cage fighting,
forcing people to eat animal.

1822
01:30:09,711 --> 01:30:14,270
Dick's dirty jokes.
I mean a pot advocacy.

1823
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:19,590
I mean I don't have a single thing that 
I do that doesn't have somebody hating 

1824
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:19,780
me,
so it's okay enough yet,

1825
01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:23,290
but I've been through after everything 
I'm saying though.

1826
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,100
No,
I think we're good at everything.

1827
01:30:25,101 --> 01:30:26,010
I'm saying no.
W,

1828
01:30:26,011 --> 01:30:27,920
w,
w regardless of whatever it is,

1829
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:30,530
whatever the subject is.
This was what I truly believe.

1830
01:30:30,531 --> 01:30:35,531
I don't have any other motivations,
so I'm fine with the controversy and I 

1831
01:30:35,661 --> 01:30:40,661
think hormones have a stigma in this 
country because of barry ponds and 

1832
01:30:40,671 --> 01:30:43,820
fucking sammy sosa and all this crazy 
shit where everybody's like,

1833
01:30:43,821 --> 01:30:45,710
oh,
this fucking cheaters in baseball.

1834
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:50,710
They ruined everything and sports and 
everyone is so concerned with what we 

1835
01:30:51,141 --> 01:30:54,470
hear about with cheating and steroids 
and athletic performance.

1836
01:30:54,471 --> 01:30:59,471
That means you're missing out on a core 
essential aspect of being a human being.

1837
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:05,110
Being a man,
especially the lack of testosterone 

1838
01:31:05,110 --> 01:31:08,340
directly related to depression,
directly related to these.

1839
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:13,250
These people that start hitting age 
regardless of traumatic brain injury,

1840
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:16,520
they start getting older and they feel 
like fucking shit.

1841
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:19,010
They feel like shit and I've talked to a
lot of them.

1842
01:31:19,011 --> 01:31:22,040
They get on testosterone and all of a 
sudden their glow again.

1843
01:31:22,041 --> 01:31:24,680
They have energy.
They want to start doing things.

1844
01:31:24,681 --> 01:31:28,520
There are active and someone I've talked
to,

1845
01:31:28,521 --> 01:31:33,521
guys who are on testosterone that don't 
like to talk about it because they're 

1846
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:37,271
worried that someone's going to look at 
them first of all as being inferior 

1847
01:31:37,271 --> 01:31:40,691
because they need to add artificial 
testosterone to their system and that 

1848
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:46,240
they might be a roid head.
Now they might be a cheater and some 

1849
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:46,240
like,
what are you fucking playing?

1850
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:50,830
You're 55 years old,
are you playing major league baseball 

1851
01:31:50,830 --> 01:31:51,620
beHind my back with life?
You're life cheater.

1852
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:56,680
You're doing too good with these new.
meanwhile you'll take aspirin if you 

1853
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:57,080
have a fucking headache,
you take ibuprofen,

1854
01:31:57,110 --> 01:32:00,790
you'll take medication if you're sick,
like why won't you take testosterone?

1855
01:32:00,791 --> 01:32:03,070
Why won't you get your hormone levels 
change?

1856
01:32:03,071 --> 01:32:08,071
I have a very good friend that won't do 
it because he's afraid of all these 

1857
01:32:08,071 --> 01:32:08,071
other things,

1858
01:32:08,071 --> 01:32:12,770
bro.
You look like shit and you're tired all 

1859
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:12,770
the time.
Right?

1860
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:13,900
Like what are you worried about?
But the,

1861
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:18,910
and the difference to me is like us 
being there and these guys who like I 

1862
01:32:19,141 --> 01:32:24,141
sat down with a guy two weeks ago,
wrote a script about a metal for the 

1863
01:32:24,141 --> 01:32:24,141
first time.
Lovely guy,

1864
01:32:24,141 --> 01:32:25,710
like the sweetest,
sweetest,

1865
01:32:25,711 --> 01:32:30,711
nicest guy,
loves the fish and all this and I'm 

1866
01:32:30,711 --> 01:32:33,291
like,
so how is it like we really get down to 

1867
01:32:33,291 --> 01:32:33,291
basics.
He's like,

1868
01:32:33,291 --> 01:32:33,291
it's good man,
it's good,

1869
01:32:33,291 --> 01:32:38,000
but some days I just have to find a 
reason to go on living and you're just 

1870
01:32:38,761 --> 01:32:43,761
like,
you understand at that point how 

1871
01:32:43,761 --> 01:32:45,930
different it is for these guys,
how much more drastic it is,

1872
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:49,980
how much more important it is to reach 
out to these guys and,

1873
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:50,230
and

1874
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:52,500
somebody's got to do it.
Well,

1875
01:32:52,501 --> 01:32:54,720
this is a subject is very near and dear 
to my heart,

1876
01:32:54,721 --> 01:32:59,450
both because I know a lot of guys in the
military from martial arts and just from

1877
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:04,790
life in general and I know a lot of guys
have had head trauma from fighting and 

1878
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:06,450
I've had a bunch of head trauma myself.
So explains it.

1879
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,330
Yeah,
I'm sure there's some bad shit going on.

1880
01:33:09,331 --> 01:33:12,090
There must be.
It doesn't make any sense,

1881
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:15,720
but it's a,
it's a subject that's very near and dear

1882
01:33:15,721 --> 01:33:20,721
to my heart.
And once we started getting into it and 

1883
01:33:20,721 --> 01:33:22,911
we started discussing it,
it was very confusing to me that it 

1884
01:33:22,911 --> 01:33:22,920
wasn't hearing this echoed in other 
places.

1885
01:33:22,921 --> 01:33:27,921
And when sometimes when you hear things 
and you don't hear it echoed in other 

1886
01:33:27,921 --> 01:33:27,921
places,
you say,

1887
01:33:27,921 --> 01:33:28,410
well,
maybe I'm talking to a crackpot.

1888
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:33,680
Maybe this guy's fucking crazy.
It's just try to get everybody on the 

1889
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:33,680
juice.

1890
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:38,670
But when you look,
when you research it and you find the,

1891
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:42,960
all the hypocrisy and the contradictions
involved in the,

1892
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:44,890
the counteracting of it or the,
uh,

1893
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:49,140
the people who are against it,
you start realizing like,

1894
01:33:49,141 --> 01:33:54,141
wow,
this is not a rationally approach 

1895
01:33:54,141 --> 01:33:56,361
subject.
This is a subject that for whatever 

1896
01:33:56,361 --> 01:33:58,941
reason is either the people who were 
talking about it or ignorant of it,

1897
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:01,380
they don't have personal experience in 
it.

1898
01:34:01,381 --> 01:34:06,381
They don't have,
they don't have a conversation with a 

1899
01:34:06,381 --> 01:34:07,590
guy like you that has spent decades 
working on this stuff.

1900
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:09,240
There's,
this is not.

1901
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:14,310
This is not a really well understood 
subject for a lot of physicians.

1902
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:21,020
They don't have pharmaceutical reps 
coming in and telling them that they 

1903
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:22,400
need to replace testosterone for 
whatever reason.

1904
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:24,870
We're stArting to see it with an issue,
right?

1905
01:34:24,871 --> 01:34:26,700
The pharmaceutical reps coming into the 
offices.

1906
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:31,730
What?
Which doesn't make any sense because 

1907
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:32,340
there are what?
The underarm deodorant to testosterone.

1908
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:34,980
There's the rub on deodorant,
testosterone.

1909
01:34:35,150 --> 01:34:40,150
It's a.
It looks like an underarm deodorant 

1910
01:34:40,150 --> 01:34:42,711
thing to try to avoid contaminating your
loved ones with excessive amount of 

1911
01:34:42,711 --> 01:34:46,080
testosterone cream.
Put all of your body.

1912
01:34:46,081 --> 01:34:49,020
We don't use any creams per se,
except for fun issues.

1913
01:34:49,170 --> 01:34:50,520
Well,
don't take how dare you.

1914
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:56,600
Don't.
The creams have also some sort of an 

1915
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:56,620
absorption issue as well.
Well,

1916
01:34:56,621 --> 01:35:01,621
what happens is when you put a cream,
a 10 percent or five percent gel or 

1917
01:35:01,621 --> 01:35:04,250
cream of testosterone and skin,
the little hair follicles have an enzyme

1918
01:35:04,251 --> 01:35:07,160
in it that converted from testosterone 
to dihydrotestosterone,

1919
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,520
which is the active form of testosterone
that you want in the cell,

1920
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:13,820
not floating around in the blood to 
cause loss of hair.

1921
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:17,410
At one point in my head,
motherfucking loss,

1922
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:23,140
loss of hair,
shrinkage of the testicles pointed me 

1923
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:28,170
again.
Plenty large was set over there at your 

1924
01:35:28,201 --> 01:35:33,201
monster over there.
The werewolf and the world will and a 

1925
01:35:33,201 --> 01:35:33,500
enlargement of the prostate.
Uh,

1926
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:36,950
you know,
for women,

1927
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:39,790
enlargement of the clutter is not bad.
It's an imbalance,

1928
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:44,990
an imbalance or lack of dht along with 
the too much dht instead of having free 

1929
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:45,920
testosterone that you need to get into 
the brain.

1930
01:35:46,190 --> 01:35:51,190
So we have,
we're interacting with some other 

1931
01:35:51,190 --> 01:35:51,200
delivery technologies,
uh,

1932
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:54,350
aside from injectable and topical,
uh,

1933
01:35:54,351 --> 01:35:59,351
that increases the amount of 
testosterone that gets into the brain 

1934
01:35:59,351 --> 01:36:00,970
and we see the major benefits in our tbi
and,

1935
01:36:00,971 --> 01:36:05,971
or a head trauma,
neuro trauma patients where they do 

1936
01:36:05,971 --> 01:36:05,971
phenomenally well.
So it seems that,

1937
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:11,710
well,
it doesn't seem that there's a whole 

1938
01:36:11,710 --> 01:36:15,190
panel of things that have to be balanced
out in order for you to have a said 

1939
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,090
happy body.

1940
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:19,520
You said at the beginning of a holistic 
approach,

1941
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:23,870
you need to have physical activity and 
nutrition and you have to have a balance

1942
01:36:23,871 --> 01:36:28,871
of everything you take into your body.
Whether or not it's A medication or a 

1943
01:36:28,871 --> 01:36:30,200
hormone or a mineral or vitamin.
You sent me another thing.

1944
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:35,201
This is very important to talk about 
because I sent it to a buddy who was 

1945
01:36:35,201 --> 01:36:35,480
experiencing some depression that you 
sent me,

1946
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:39,320
something about propecia or [inaudible] 
or whatever,

1947
01:36:39,321 --> 01:36:44,321
the finasteride finasteride and dressed 
drive direction that has been shown to 

1948
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:50,591
cause depression in people and I have a 
buddy who got on that shit and he was 

1949
01:36:50,591 --> 01:36:53,330
experiencing some hair loss.
Get on that shit and became really,

1950
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:58,160
really depressed.
The reason being is that to stop when it

1951
01:36:58,161 --> 01:37:03,161
gets into the brain,
goes through a cascade of changes from 

1952
01:37:03,161 --> 01:37:05,090
testosterone to dihydrotestosterone 300 
scenic diane,

1953
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:08,300
and then it stimulates a chemical called
adenyl cyclase,

1954
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:10,220
which gives us our upgrade feeling.

1955
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:12,620
And when you block the conversion of 
testosterone,

1956
01:37:12,621 --> 01:37:15,530
dht,
you lose all that stuff down the road.

1957
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:18,350
So you can have issues with anger,
depression.

1958
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:23,620
We have a couple of people who were 
developed it within a short period of 

1959
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:28,121
time,
like 18 months on the finance 

1960
01:37:28,121 --> 01:37:29,720
finasteride and,
uh,

1961
01:37:30,170 --> 01:37:33,800
had to put them onto hcg little clomid 
and a little testosterone.

1962
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:35,480
Six months,
they're back in line.

1963
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:38,060
They were depressed,
they'd lost their libido.

1964
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:42,590
And it's because the effect of dht and 
testosterone,

1965
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:47,600
the brain,
testosterone and growth hormone also 

1966
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:47,600
work in an area of the brain for memory 
recall,

1967
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:51,521
and the ability to learn new things 
called the hippocampus also are 

1968
01:37:51,521 --> 01:37:52,730
panoramic vision and our panoramic 
memories.

1969
01:37:52,731 --> 01:37:56,280
So you look at something panoramic or 
you have a sequence of,

1970
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:57,290
of,
um,

1971
01:37:57,680 --> 01:38:02,680
of memories that you can lose if you 
lose your testosterone in the perry 

1972
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:05,610
campus area of the brain,
it also kills your dick like pesticide.

1973
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:06,690
Oh,
dah di,

1974
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:09,480
that fucking that print finasteride 
stuff.

1975
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:11,880
Oh yeah.
That's because dht is important.

1976
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:14,790
Testosterone's important dht in the 
brain.

1977
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:20,180
So when you use stuff that converts the 
dht in from the application on the skin,

1978
01:38:20,281 --> 01:38:22,230
it gets into the blood but doesn't get 
into the brain.

1979
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,140
So you have to generate your dht in the 
brain,

1980
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:27,000
in the cells,
not in the blood.

1981
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:31,200
And when I look at people who are on 
some of the topical products out there,

1982
01:38:31,201 --> 01:38:35,760
you see free testosterone's good.
Total testosterone is outrageously high.

1983
01:38:35,761 --> 01:38:40,761
Dht is sky high.
And they're wondering why their hair's 

1984
01:38:40,761 --> 01:38:43,250
falling out in handfuls.
Almost their testicles are disappearing 

1985
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:43,250
or else,
you know.

1986
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:47,610
But they are straight strengths up 
strength from dhd,

1987
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:50,820
but it's this,
this pill that makes your hair fall out.

1988
01:38:50,821 --> 01:38:55,821
I mean that's like,
that's one of those things like if 

1989
01:38:55,821 --> 01:38:55,821
someone could come up with a pill that 
makes you,

1990
01:38:55,821 --> 01:38:56,220
that keeps your hair from falling out,
boy,

1991
01:38:56,221 --> 01:38:57,780
that's a,
that's a very popular thing.

1992
01:38:57,990 --> 01:38:59,840
And then you look at the side effects.
I was like,

1993
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:04,850
don't give it a pregnant woman.
Your fucking kids going to be fucked up 

1994
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:05,220
if she touches it.
Like you can't even touch it if you're a

1995
01:39:05,221 --> 01:39:10,221
pregnant woman.
Like don't take something that a woman 

1996
01:39:10,221 --> 01:39:14,001
can't even touch when she's pregnant.
And the reason is that they found that 

1997
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:14,001
d,
h,

1998
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:17,820
d helps to distinguish the brain's 
gender orientation,

1999
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:21,240
dht,
dihydrotestosterone,

2000
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:25,610
gender orientation,
so that you can have externally a,

2001
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
a,
you know,

2002
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:32,200
a male body.
But If female mentality woe and it's 

2003
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:36,650
biochemical.
so do you think that this is a maybe 

2004
01:39:36,650 --> 01:39:40,520
possibly related to transgender people 
that are there that say they were born a

2005
01:39:41,551 --> 01:39:45,810
man physically but they brought born the
wrong sex dht related?

2006
01:39:45,811 --> 01:39:47,100
I think it's,
that's it.

2007
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:49,170
It's not.
I don't believe in the social,

2008
01:39:49,171 --> 01:39:50,550
cultural reasons for it,
you know,

2009
01:39:50,551 --> 01:39:53,230
someone becoming a homosexual or lesbian
is,

2010
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:56,340
you know,
as a ptsd kind of response.

2011
01:39:56,340 --> 01:40:01,340
I use the data.
A gal who was a lesbian who would just 

2012
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:01,340
go out.
No,

2013
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:04,170
it was my goal to fix her if she needed 
to be who she was,

2014
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,810
but she had been raped.
I'm kidding.

2015
01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:06,540
yeah,
I know you were.

2016
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:10,260
She had been raped multiple times when 
she lived in this country.

2017
01:40:10,261 --> 01:40:13,350
That's always conflicting over there in 
the east area.

2018
01:40:14,210 --> 01:40:14,780
Okay.
Now,

2019
01:40:14,781 --> 01:40:15,950
okay.
And uh,

2020
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:20,170
I don't know what you're saying,
but middle east area and you know,

2021
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:25,400
that country that everyone's picking on 
because it's a warmonger income country 

2022
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,090
and creates all the wars.
Syria,

2023
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:28,580
Israel,
Israel.

2024
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:31,830
So she was raped in Israel bite.
Oh god.

2025
01:40:31,831 --> 01:40:33,920
Some people there.
And um,

2026
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:37,170
she feared men,
she had a ptsd.

2027
01:40:37,171 --> 01:40:42,171
Every time she got close with the guy,
she would freak out and she didn't have 

2028
01:40:42,171 --> 01:40:42,171
it with women.
And that was,

2029
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:43,110
you know,
the pts.

2030
01:40:43,111 --> 01:40:44,590
But I think,
uh,

2031
01:40:44,591 --> 01:40:45,720
you know,
they say it's a choice.

2032
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:50,720
Well,
I don't think it's a choice in all the 

2033
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:50,970
cases.
I think in the transgender they were put

2034
01:40:50,971 --> 01:40:55,971
into the wrong body.
Their mindset was in the wrong body or 

2035
01:40:55,971 --> 01:40:58,861
their body was right.
The mindset was treated with hormones 

2036
01:40:58,861 --> 01:40:58,861
that created the,
the other gender,

2037
01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:02,200
and they're fulfilling it by transgender
surgery.

2038
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:04,450
You know,
I worked in Thailand for the past,

2039
01:41:04,451 --> 01:41:09,451
uh,
four years going back to starting the 

2040
01:41:09,451 --> 01:41:11,581
project and was exposed to a lot of the 
transgender or the gender reassignment 

2041
01:41:12,050 --> 01:41:15,560
individuals relative to hormones.
And um,

2042
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:19,990
there were people who were in the wrong 
body.

2043
01:41:20,410 --> 01:41:24,740
I mean their physical expression in the 
opposite.

2044
01:41:24,741 --> 01:41:29,741
Then sex they were born in was obviously
the wrong body and they went through 

2045
01:41:29,741 --> 01:41:30,730
surgery to have things corrected for 
them.

2046
01:41:31,290 --> 01:41:35,010
And do you think this is related to 
these hormones in the wound?

2047
01:41:35,110 --> 01:41:37,330
I think it's hormones.
It could be,

2048
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:38,800
you know,
alcohol,

2049
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:40,210
cocaine,
crack,

2050
01:41:40,211 --> 01:41:42,700
meth,
any kind of chemistry that is introduced

2051
01:41:42,701 --> 01:41:45,820
to the woman's body during that very 
frightful period of time,

2052
01:41:45,821 --> 01:41:50,821
the first seven weeks where everything 
starts developing and the change in 

2053
01:41:50,821 --> 01:41:54,991
hormones,
whether or not it's externally 

2054
01:41:54,991 --> 01:41:57,000
introduced or internally manufactured 
because of things that they've been 

2055
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,081
taken into their body like alcohol,
which can alter chemistry or smoking 

2056
01:42:01,081 --> 01:42:03,190
weed that can cause an elevation.
Esther dialed levels.

2057
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:06,220
And if you have elevation to dial dial 
levels in a,

2058
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:11,280
in a male,
you can predispose them to be female 

2059
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:11,800
brain,
physiologically male,

2060
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:13,240
female in mental.

2061
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:19,160
This is an issue that a lot of people 
get very emotional about when you're 

2062
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:20,930
talking about transgender folks.
And yes,

2063
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:26,400
and when you break it down to a chemical
relationship and you break it down to 

2064
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:28,200
this,
what,

2065
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:31,590
what you're saying about the 
introduction of the certain chemicals in

2066
01:42:31,591 --> 01:42:33,480
the womb,
people resist this information.

2067
01:42:33,950 --> 01:42:36,890
Yes they do.
They like to say that,

2068
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:40,670
you know,
they're always female.

2069
01:42:40,890 --> 01:42:45,050
Uh,
they want to be female or male or male.

2070
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:48,200
Sorry,
I just preference or female regardless.

2071
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,470
But um,
yeah,

2072
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:53,600
it's a very heated,
very emotional because you don't want to

2073
01:42:53,601 --> 01:42:57,380
have that doubt that they were a male.
You want to eliminate the fact that they

2074
01:42:57,381 --> 01:42:59,950
were a male and that there are female,
as you know,

2075
01:42:59,951 --> 01:43:01,130
in,
in mma.

2076
01:43:01,131 --> 01:43:02,450
The situation that's going on,

2077
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:07,700
the situation that I'm involved in,
well I'm involved in it because I was 

2078
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:09,030
one of many people that thought it was 
incorrect.

2079
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:14,150
There's a woman that was born a man.
She was a man for 30 years and then had 

2080
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:17,160
gender reassignment surgery two years 
later.

2081
01:43:17,161 --> 01:43:22,161
It was fighting women in mma fights.
Never fought as a man and he's fighting 

2082
01:43:22,161 --> 01:43:23,730
and beating the fuck out of these checks
and not letting them know.

2083
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:26,190
The first two,
at least that she used to be a man,

2084
01:43:26,490 --> 01:43:28,260
which I thought was just completely 
incorrect.

2085
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:33,240
And I based it on my knowledge of 
martial arts,

2086
01:43:33,450 --> 01:43:38,450
my knowledge of things like the size of 
hands and shoulders and the different 

2087
01:43:38,450 --> 01:43:41,370
relationship that the body parts of the 
hips,

2088
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:46,540
there's the,
there's the structure of a male body is 

2089
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:47,610
very different.
And then if you take steroids,

2090
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:51,060
one of the things about steroids that's 
hugely problematic,

2091
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:56,170
people that cheated and then don't cheat
anymore is that when you cheat,

2092
01:43:56,450 --> 01:44:01,450
when you take steroids,
and I'm not talking just about 

2093
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:04,301
testosterone and talking to them like 
real radical steroids and a lot of 

2094
01:44:04,301 --> 01:44:06,350
people taken you enact permanent changes
to your body,

2095
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:11,650
not just permanent changes,
but permanent changes that improve the 

2096
01:44:11,650 --> 01:44:12,560
performance of your body forever.

2097
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:15,080
You there,
there's been many studies that have come

2098
01:44:15,081 --> 01:44:18,050
out recently that people have taken 
steroids,

2099
01:44:18,051 --> 01:44:23,051
you know,
x amount of years ago and been off them 

2100
01:44:23,051 --> 01:44:25,091
for a long time,
still have the benefits of taking those 

2101
01:44:25,091 --> 01:44:27,440
steroids.
If you've taken 30 years of testosterone

2102
01:44:27,441 --> 01:44:32,441
in a male frame,
I'm a male frame which has different 

2103
01:44:32,441 --> 01:44:33,410
tendons,
which has different,

2104
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:38,510
uh,
different jaw structure which changes 

2105
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:40,820
your ability to absorb punishment.
Two years of estrogen therapy.

2106
01:44:41,210 --> 01:44:42,680
How much of that is going to change that

2107
01:44:43,730 --> 01:44:45,470
externally?
It'll change.

2108
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:50,630
Estrogen has a counteract some of the 
Benefits of testosterone.

2109
01:44:50,631 --> 01:44:55,631
So the question is,
is there also supplementation of 

2110
01:44:55,631 --> 01:44:56,880
testosterone at the same time,
it taking estrogen or are they using gas

2111
01:44:56,990 --> 01:45:00,140
testosterone to convert into estrogen as
a means of getting their estrogen?

2112
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:03,790
You'd have to look at how they're being 
treated and you know,

2113
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:08,030
their personal selection of what 
cocktail of hormones that are taking.

2114
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:13,480
Usually what happens is [inaudible] 
acetate is a drug that's used to block 

2115
01:45:14,451 --> 01:45:19,451
the androgen receptors so that a woman 
can develop the or transgender woman can

2116
01:45:19,791 --> 01:45:23,240
develop the softness and the femininity 
of her body.

2117
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:28,720
But if the individual,
the transgender female as a female 

2118
01:45:29,570 --> 01:45:34,370
maintains a lot of the muscle striations
and contours of a male,

2119
01:45:34,371 --> 01:45:39,371
then they're probably not getting 
adequate amount of estrogen or they're 

2120
01:45:39,371 --> 01:45:43,180
supplementing with one form of another,
of either testosterone or deco or 

2121
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:47,560
nandrolone or a loan.
Um,

2122
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:53,140
what androgen,
a nfr some of the other dht like 

2123
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:57,791
products.
So it'd be interesting to find out what 

2124
01:45:57,791 --> 01:45:57,980
the chemistry,
the bIochemistry is the individual,

2125
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:02,270
but you're right,
muscle muscle response,

2126
01:46:02,271 --> 01:46:03,980
time,
absorption,

2127
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:06,740
hips,
tendons,

2128
01:46:07,190 --> 01:46:09,770
cartilage and joints,
resilience,

2129
01:46:09,771 --> 01:46:12,560
thickness of the bone.
Men have more dense bones,

2130
01:46:12,561 --> 01:46:15,500
more dense jaws than women.
Um,

2131
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:17,270
mIndset.
The aggression,

2132
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:19,700
there's a totally different direction.
Imprinting,

2133
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:23,620
imprinting right from that 30 years.
Men are different for a lot of ways.

2134
01:46:23,621 --> 01:46:24,860
The way we analyze things,

2135
01:46:24,890 --> 01:46:27,990
so we're not fair,
but when it comes to bone density,

2136
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:31,230
um,
african american women have similar bone

2137
01:46:31,231 --> 01:46:32,370
density to white men.

2138
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:34,220
Correct.
For whatever reason,

2139
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:40,060
my significant other is a dentist and 
would share with me over the past 30 

2140
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:44,741
some odd years about the difference 
between different racial groups and the 

2141
01:46:45,471 --> 01:46:47,690
african american have much thicker 
bones,

2142
01:46:47,780 --> 01:46:51,840
much thicker bones comparable to a male 
or female to male,

2143
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:52,230
yes.

2144
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:57,820
And astrogen.
In taking estrogen post transition 

2145
01:46:58,970 --> 01:47:03,970
transition,
estrogen allows the bone density to 

2146
01:47:03,970 --> 01:47:07,661
remain because estrogen,
which is one of the issues in 

2147
01:47:07,661 --> 01:47:08,210
osteoporosis,
is when women go through menopause,

2148
01:47:08,211 --> 01:47:11,060
their body stops producing estrogen,
so their bones lack density.

2149
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:15,470
So in giving a transgender male 
estrogen,

2150
01:47:15,471 --> 01:47:18,630
it actually preserves bone density,
so keeps them with a male.

2151
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:23,880
That's correct.
They don't lose it as long as they're 

2152
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:26,010
making sure that not only vitamin d but 
extra dial testosterone growth hormone 

2153
01:47:26,230 --> 01:47:28,780
all help with bone density.
In fact,

2154
01:47:28,781 --> 01:47:33,781
a growth hormone works about point one 
point six percent increase in bone 

2155
01:47:33,781 --> 01:47:37,180
density in a year,
so it raises the bone density.

2156
01:47:37,181 --> 01:47:40,210
We have patients who are growth hormone 
deficient with thinning of the bones.

2157
01:47:40,211 --> 01:47:42,610
We put them back on physiologic dosing 
of growth on,

2158
01:47:42,850 --> 01:47:47,850
you see in six months to a year that 
bone density responds where in using 

2159
01:47:47,850 --> 01:47:49,210
some of the medication that are out 
there,

2160
01:47:49,211 --> 01:47:50,660
which I won't name,
you know,

2161
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,510
can take,
I'm 23 years,

2162
01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:56,740
and bone density is also altered by 
weightlifting,

2163
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,100
correct?

2164
01:47:57,230 --> 01:47:59,870
Correct.
The body responds through pulling.

2165
01:48:00,020 --> 01:48:01,790
I mean people.
The most common,

2166
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:03,010
abnormal,
uh,

2167
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:08,080
example of that are either achilles 
tendon spurs or plantar fasciitis spurs 

2168
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:14,530
from pulling a muscle or tendon on bone.
It stimulates more bone to be made.

2169
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:17,660
So if you're stressing the bones is 
really what it is,

2170
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:22,840
you increase the density.
So if you look at people who are 

2171
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:22,840
sedentary,
drink alcohol,

2172
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:23,750
blonde,
blue eyed,

2173
01:48:23,780 --> 01:48:26,450
male or female,
you'll see scandinavian study.

2174
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:31,280
You'll see that their bone density is 
less than people who are dark skinned,

2175
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:33,650
dark haired,
and physically active.

2176
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:37,560
These are things that helped maintain 
and promote denser bone.

2177
01:48:37,890 --> 01:48:41,100
What happens to tendon strength and 
things along those lines,

2178
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:44,530
because tendons play a vital role in 
striking in,

2179
01:48:44,531 --> 01:48:45,590
in combat sports.

2180
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,580
That's right.
Uh,

2181
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:50,550
specifically about tendons I can't 
answer other than the muscle.

2182
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:54,120
IT improves the muscle in muscles are 
connected to tendons.

2183
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:59,180
Tendons are a inert kind of tissue.
It's the muscle that pull on the tendon.

2184
01:48:59,521 --> 01:49:04,521
So it's the muscle issue,
but the muscles decreased with estrogen 

2185
01:49:04,521 --> 01:49:07,851
therapy.
They can do decrease with estrogen 

2186
01:49:07,851 --> 01:49:10,611
therapy,
but if they're also on something that 

2187
01:49:10,611 --> 01:49:12,180
puts back testosterone,
you can generate a balance.

2188
01:49:12,181 --> 01:49:14,820
So they get some softening,
but they don't lose the muscle.

2189
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:20,450
And then estrogen,
you'd have to look at the biochemistry 

2190
01:49:20,450 --> 01:49:24,111
of it to really answer it because if 
you're being strict on the process of 

2191
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:29,780
total transgender transformation,
you need to give them lots of estrogen 

2192
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:31,830
in diminished the testosterone which 
competes with the estrogen.

2193
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:36,980
So if you want to be a dominant estrogen
dominant to be a female estrogen 

2194
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:40,371
dominant,
then you have to wipe out the 

2195
01:49:40,371 --> 01:49:40,371
testosterone.

2196
01:49:40,371 --> 01:49:43,810
Well,
this has been such a highly charged and 

2197
01:49:43,810 --> 01:49:45,981
emotional discussion and it becomes a 
transphobic or an anti transgender more 

2198
01:49:48,371 --> 01:49:53,371
than it becomes an argument of fairness 
involving a sport where the very goal is

2199
01:49:54,521 --> 01:49:59,521
to use your body to hurt somebody else 
and if you have some sort of just 

2200
01:49:59,521 --> 01:50:04,320
natural physiological advantages over 
that person because you were born male,

2201
01:50:04,961 --> 01:50:09,961
not because you're.
I meAn this is a spectrum involving 

2202
01:50:09,961 --> 01:50:12,931
women.
There's some women that are very 

2203
01:50:12,931 --> 01:50:12,931
feminine,
very petite,

2204
01:50:12,931 --> 01:50:15,651
and there's some women that are very 
thIck and very physically strong just 

2205
01:50:15,651 --> 01:50:15,760
naturally,
but from the womb,

2206
01:50:15,930 --> 01:50:17,410
you know,
no added hormones,

2207
01:50:17,411 --> 01:50:18,780
no added anything.
So.

2208
01:50:18,810 --> 01:50:22,180
but the idea is that that's mitigated by
weight classes.

2209
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:25,890
The idea is that a 135 pound woman in 
135 pound woman,

2210
01:50:25,930 --> 01:50:27,820
you know,
they're both 135 pounds.

2211
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:30,040
They're pre,
whether they're,

2212
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:31,570
you know,
there's variations,

2213
01:50:31,571 --> 01:50:33,330
but pretty close,
let's,

2214
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:34,720
let's have them compete against each 
other.

2215
01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:38,800
But 135 pound man versus 135 pound 
woman.

2216
01:50:39,130 --> 01:50:44,130
Very different.
One hundred and 35 pound transitioning 

2217
01:50:44,130 --> 01:50:47,881
man to transgender woman.
Still different than a biologic,

2218
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:53,110
a woman,
they would have undue disadvantage.

2219
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:56,560
The competitor,
female natural born,

2220
01:50:56,561 --> 01:51:01,561
digital born female,
would have undue disadvantage against a 

2221
01:51:01,561 --> 01:51:04,681
transgender female from male to female.
Genetically,

2222
01:51:05,420 --> 01:51:10,420
you know,
you're always going to be a male 

2223
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:10,420
genetically,
so it means that the biochemistry,

2224
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:14,671
when you put these things into it,
the body wIll respond to preference 

2225
01:51:14,671 --> 01:51:17,440
male,
unless you totally put in chemistry to,

2226
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,570
uh,
to stop that.

2227
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:20,530
And that's that cypress.

2228
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:24,160
But let's assume that they even do put 
the chemicals in to stop that.

2229
01:51:24,161 --> 01:51:27,190
Would they still have significant 
advantages in any area?

2230
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:28,870
Yes.
For a timeframe they would.

2231
01:51:28,871 --> 01:51:33,871
Until the optimal effects that you're 
looking for by giving estrogen for 

2232
01:51:34,361 --> 01:51:36,970
softening the musculature,
take effect.

2233
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:38,220
well,
it's still,

2234
01:51:38,221 --> 01:51:42,510
there's a 10 percent benefit that men 
have over women,

2235
01:51:42,511 --> 01:51:47,511
like across the board and reaction time.
Would that still be a factor if they had

2236
01:51:48,090 --> 01:51:49,140
transitioned to a woman?

2237
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:51,190
I really don't know.
That answer

2238
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:57,000
is.
There probably hasn't been that many 

2239
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:57,000
studies on this as well.

2240
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,690
I think the biggest problem in this one 
case that you're talking about is that 

2241
01:51:59,690 --> 01:52:01,920
there's really no precedences,
no wealth of documentation where they've

2242
01:52:01,921 --> 01:52:06,921
actually looked at someone who goes from
male to female and gets into some male 

2243
01:52:07,141 --> 01:52:12,141
sports within and not wrestling or 
grappling or mma or whatever the 

2244
01:52:12,271 --> 01:52:14,100
situation is.
Or baseball was there.

2245
01:52:14,101 --> 01:52:18,510
Someone recently went into transitional.
Went into a sport

2246
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:21,620
that cyclist.
Yeah.

2247
01:52:21,621 --> 01:52:23,390
Michelle,
do more ask.

2248
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:24,360
Yeah.
This,

2249
01:52:24,361 --> 01:52:27,260
it's a fascinating story.
She transitioned.

2250
01:52:27,290 --> 01:52:29,870
She had sex reassignment surgery,
became a woman,

2251
01:52:30,020 --> 01:52:35,020
and started competIng in biking in,
and in her first she,

2252
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:42,220
she entered a novice female class.
Her first finish was two point five 

2253
01:52:42,220 --> 01:52:45,080
seconds faster than the winner of the 
professional female category.

2254
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:50,190
She went on to win the fall in 2002.
She,

2255
01:52:50,191 --> 01:52:52,130
uh,
she was awarded a license to race in the

2256
01:52:52,131 --> 01:52:53,450
women's category.
Three weekS later,

2257
01:52:53,570 --> 01:52:56,240
she entered her first race in the pro 
woman's class,

2258
01:52:56,241 --> 01:53:01,241
finished third the following week.
She plays first beating her compete 

2259
01:53:01,241 --> 01:53:03,050
competition by 10 seconds.
And this is,

2260
01:53:03,070 --> 01:53:04,130
you know,
a novice,

2261
01:53:04,131 --> 01:53:09,131
a person who's just just entering into 
this world of professional racing and 

2262
01:53:09,131 --> 01:53:13,031
she's just stomping these women a wave 
of protests and sued and petition was 

2263
01:53:13,031 --> 01:53:16,811
created and signed by female and a few 
male racers asking her to be 

2264
01:53:16,811 --> 01:53:18,650
dIsqualified because she had a race 
licensed.

2265
01:53:18,650 --> 01:53:21,710
The request was denied.
So it became this huge controversy.

2266
01:53:21,950 --> 01:53:23,610
Um,
and you know,

2267
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:28,630
this is another example of someone who 
has an unfair physical advantage or is 

2268
01:53:28,630 --> 01:53:30,930
thought to have that tech chemically.
Um,

2269
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:36,320
there's another problem with this is 
that there's a lot of confirmation bias 

2270
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:37,880
about this and there's a lot of 
emotions.

2271
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:41,120
They're riding on this.
And this person who we're talking about,

2272
01:53:41,121 --> 01:53:44,810
the person in question has become 
essentially a poster boy for transgender

2273
01:53:44,811 --> 01:53:48,830
rights and transgender acceptance.
And I couldn't think of a worst possible

2274
01:53:48,831 --> 01:53:51,290
example.
It's one thing to say,

2275
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:52,940
hey,
you know,

2276
01:53:53,420 --> 01:53:57,470
this person wants their own personal 
freedom to be living their life.

2277
01:53:57,471 --> 01:53:59,480
As a woman.
Do you accept that?

2278
01:53:59,481 --> 01:54:00,920
Absolutely.
Change your name,

2279
01:54:00,921 --> 01:54:02,660
change whatever,
whatever you want,

2280
01:54:03,110 --> 01:54:05,240
but when you're asking for that,
right?

2281
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:10,840
But you're entering into combat sports 
with natural born females and literally 

2282
01:54:11,151 --> 01:54:12,920
beating the shit out of them.
Boy,

2283
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:16,040
that gets really fucking tricky.
That gets really tricky.

2284
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,620
So what do you think the resolve will 
be?

2285
01:54:18,621 --> 01:54:22,340
Have a separate organization that only 
deals with transgender.

2286
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:23,710
That's the best way.
I mean,

2287
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:25,430
that's probably the best way to 
professional.

2288
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:30,640
I mean that's the.
But if there's a point at which the 

2289
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:32,750
body,
the body provides homeostasis as a woman

2290
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:35,330
after doing all that testing.
Isn't,

2291
01:54:35,390 --> 01:54:38,060
isn't that measurable?
It's measurable,

2292
01:54:38,090 --> 01:54:43,090
but It's going to take a long time.
They might be in their seventies by the 

2293
01:54:43,090 --> 01:54:43,130
time it takes.
So it takes.

2294
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:48,160
Yeah,
but the point is they're genetically 

2295
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:48,160
there.
Whatever you throw into their body,

2296
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:51,830
their body's going to respond to it as 
their original gender.

2297
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:55,310
so the testosterone that you're talking 
about,

2298
01:54:55,380 --> 01:55:00,380
the problem that people have that I've 
talked to is if I start taking this 

2299
01:55:00,561 --> 01:55:02,060
thing,
I'm going to have to take it the rest of

2300
01:55:02,061 --> 01:55:05,780
my life.
If you're deficient,

2301
01:55:05,781 --> 01:55:09,470
I used to get this for the past 14 
years.

2302
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:12,590
You're a diabetic who needs insulin,
right?

2303
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,600
What are you going to do?
Rest of your life.

2304
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:16,420
Correct.
Same thing with testosterone.

2305
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:18,710
Thyroid.
I'm committed to my thyroid for the rest

2306
01:55:18,711 --> 01:55:22,550
of my life because without it I gained 
weight.

2307
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:27,560
My thought processes are slowed down and
now I race all the time.

2308
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:32,480
Brain wise it's.
So you have to treat it like a,

2309
01:55:32,690 --> 01:55:34,520
like a disorder,
a disease.

2310
01:55:34,521 --> 01:55:36,240
It's a deficiency syndrome.
Efficiency.

2311
01:55:36,241 --> 01:55:36,740
Yeah.
To do,

2312
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:38,360
you know,
I don't understand why,

2313
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:40,760
you know,
my colleagues tend to isolate it just as

2314
01:55:40,761 --> 01:55:41,960
you,
you know,

2315
01:55:42,110 --> 01:55:44,610
positioned it.
If you're deficient,

2316
01:55:44,611 --> 01:55:46,770
you replace your replace or replenish 
it.

2317
01:55:46,771 --> 01:55:48,180
bringing it back to where the normal 
love.

2318
01:55:48,181 --> 01:55:53,181
Liz,
the other thing is we have developed a 

2319
01:55:53,181 --> 01:55:56,100
statistical models for at 20 years of 
age,

2320
01:55:56,130 --> 01:56:01,130
you need this amount of hormone at 40 
this mount which is less and at 60 this 

2321
01:56:01,130 --> 01:56:05,271
amount,
what do we replace everything to one 

2322
01:56:05,271 --> 01:56:07,611
word,
the healthiest between 25 and 35 and 

2323
01:56:07,611 --> 01:56:08,040
that's the premise of our practice and 
that's why we get the responses we do.

2324
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:13,400
We don't return a 70 year old to the 
average 70 year old level because they 

2325
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:17,241
weren't getting any benefit in the past.
So we bring them to a level that has 

2326
01:56:17,241 --> 01:56:17,241
the,
the peak of it.

2327
01:56:17,241 --> 01:56:18,920
Do you have a seven year old wives 
coming in and go,

2328
01:56:18,950 --> 01:56:22,180
let's do one stop fucking man.
We fucking dose back.

2329
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:23,110
Jesus christ.

2330
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:25,120
I had a.
You brought it up,

2331
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:29,020
you brought it up.
Ninety four year old guy comes in with a

2332
01:56:29,021 --> 01:56:34,021
walker.
Rice 94 year old guy comes in on a 

2333
01:56:34,021 --> 01:56:36,730
walker,
was brought in by one guy that I talked 

2334
01:56:36,730 --> 01:56:37,210
about,
keith and he'd been using the walker for

2335
01:56:37,211 --> 01:56:39,040
about 17 years.
Comes in,

2336
01:56:40,090 --> 01:56:45,090
come in,
and we put them on two hormones now in 

2337
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:48,670
the past I would draw the blood,
get results and then starting.

2338
01:56:48,671 --> 01:56:51,340
But he had a classical syndrome called 
the frailty syndrome.

2339
01:56:51,370 --> 01:56:56,370
He was holding onto the walker and 
shaking because he didn't have muscle 

2340
01:56:56,370 --> 01:56:57,760
tone to support his own body.
That is classical,

2341
01:56:58,070 --> 01:57:00,310
uh,
fatigue syndrome.

2342
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:04,450
So I put them onto a middle of the road 
treatment protocol,

2343
01:57:04,570 --> 01:57:07,450
low dose regiment,
and waited for the labs,

2344
01:57:07,451 --> 01:57:09,040
come back,
told him to come back in six weeks,

2345
01:57:09,050 --> 01:57:10,990
came back in six weeks and we started 
them,

2346
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:16,220
you know,
reviewed the labs and he was on 

2347
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:16,220
appropriate mount and drew blood again 
to monitor him.

2348
01:57:16,510 --> 01:57:19,480
And we chit chatted a little bit.
And as he started leaving the room,

2349
01:57:19,481 --> 01:57:20,860
he turns to me and says,
oh,

2350
01:57:20,890 --> 01:57:22,120
by the way,
Dr.

2351
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:23,590
Gordon,
I probably should tell you,

2352
01:57:23,591 --> 01:57:25,930
I finally had sex with my 60 year old 
girlfriend.

2353
01:57:26,370 --> 01:57:29,830
And that tells you that at replacing the
hormone,

2354
01:57:29,890 --> 01:57:34,890
that psychologically you have to be 
psychologically attuned to want to have 

2355
01:57:34,890 --> 01:57:38,341
sex.
You can't just have sex because the 

2356
01:57:38,341 --> 01:57:38,341
brain is,
you know,

2357
01:57:38,341 --> 01:57:40,960
not with you physiologically.
everything that has to be working in 

2358
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:40,960
physically,
you have to have the moves.

2359
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:45,470
Well,
that's what he did to me.

2360
01:57:45,471 --> 01:57:47,350
He's got some.
The other thing is he

2361
01:57:47,610 --> 01:57:50,330
carried his walker in.
He knew it,

2362
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:53,430
didn't walk on it.
He carried it in under his arm.

2363
01:57:53,431 --> 01:57:55,200
And I said to herman,
I said to herman,

2364
01:57:55,201 --> 01:57:57,300
uh,
why are you carrying the walk?

2365
01:57:57,310 --> 01:57:57,960
He says,
well,

2366
01:57:57,961 --> 01:58:01,170
I've used it for 17 years.
I've had to continue using it.

2367
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:02,310
I said,
did you use it today?

2368
01:58:02,311 --> 01:58:02,940
He says,
no,

2369
01:58:03,190 --> 01:58:04,320
so we'll leave it home.
He says,

2370
01:58:04,321 --> 01:58:05,550
but I'm afraid I might fall.

2371
01:58:06,230 --> 01:58:07,640
He's committed to his walker.
Like,

2372
01:58:07,641 --> 01:58:09,710
you're committed to your thyroid.
Absolutely.

2373
01:58:10,190 --> 01:58:10,820
So,
um,

2374
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:14,300
I think it's different.
That's like if he needed,

2375
01:58:14,710 --> 01:58:16,970
he didn't need the thyroid,
he's still taking it with them.

2376
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:20,990
How about levitra or stylists or 
something like that?

2377
01:58:21,230 --> 01:58:26,230
It does help your testosterone does 
allegedly allegedly know anything about 

2378
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:28,250
it?
So the answer is yes.

2379
01:58:28,251 --> 01:58:30,480
You've had some 90 year old dudes.
Fucking the shit out there.

2380
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:32,750
I shouldn't say it like that.
Well,

2381
01:58:32,751 --> 01:58:34,630
no.
Um,

2382
01:58:35,630 --> 01:58:36,290
what,
what,

2383
01:58:36,350 --> 01:58:39,560
um,
if you ever had negative responses,

2384
01:58:39,630 --> 01:58:44,630
people,
you've put them on some of a hormone 

2385
01:58:44,630 --> 01:58:44,630
replacement protocol and that becomes 
issues.

2386
01:58:44,630 --> 01:58:44,630
Absolutely.
What are those?

2387
01:58:44,790 --> 01:58:45,840
Um,
let's see,

2388
01:58:46,610 --> 01:58:51,610
uh,
a gentleman who was put onto 60 

2389
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:54,981
milligrams a week of testosterone and 
all they wanted to do is have sex with 

2390
01:58:54,981 --> 01:58:55,230
anything that walked.
Uh,

2391
01:58:55,250 --> 01:58:57,480
so we had a lower them down to 40 
milligrams,

2392
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:04,340
three patients who had a panic attack 
because this process of testosterone in 

2393
01:59:04,621 --> 01:59:07,290
the brain going to this thing called 
adenyl cyclase.

2394
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:10,260
If it's the wrong person or too much 
relative to their body,

2395
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:13,200
they can get a panic attack,
which I've had in three patients.

2396
01:59:13,201 --> 01:59:14,690
You load those in,
disappears.

2397
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:16,530
What is,
what's causing the panic attack?

2398
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:21,540
It's a chemical called adenyl cyclase,
which is like a stimulate in the brain,

2399
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:24,330
just,
it just pushes you over the edge.

2400
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:28,660
So is it that they have so much 
testosterone and then their body thinks,

2401
01:59:28,661 --> 01:59:29,350
well,
we must have,

2402
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:31,960
we must be in a dangerous area.
Is that why we have.

2403
01:59:31,970 --> 01:59:32,040
Okay,

2404
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:35,090
it's relative.
Hormones are relative.

2405
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:40,240
It's not absolute.
You can't say 100 is what everybody 

2406
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:43,121
uses.
You know there are people who need 20 

2407
01:59:43,121 --> 01:59:46,991
milligrams.
I have one gal that the average 

2408
01:59:46,991 --> 01:59:46,991
production of a woman in a week is about
20 milligrams.

2409
01:59:46,991 --> 01:59:51,940
She would use 20 milligrams a month and 
she meet her it by her libido.

2410
01:59:53,150 --> 01:59:58,150
so average weekly dose she used every 
month because she was super sensItive to

2411
01:59:58,341 --> 01:59:59,660
it.
Women,

2412
01:59:59,661 --> 02:00:01,670
when they get on testosterone,
get super horny,

2413
02:00:02,210 --> 02:00:05,330
they get assertive,
which is great.

2414
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:08,840
They get allegedly,
it was mostly living with them.

2415
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:13,650
The confidence,
assertiveness a,

2416
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:16,910
they start feeling great.
They absolutely feel better,

2417
02:00:16,970 --> 02:00:21,970
a competitive and it's all degrees of.
It's all acceptable degrees of and when 

2418
02:00:22,491 --> 02:00:27,491
you overtreat them then you get into,
I want to be fucked now in our and in 

2419
02:00:27,491 --> 02:00:30,050
two hours and three hours in four hours 
and you know,

2420
02:00:30,051 --> 02:00:31,820
you're using science from personal 
experience.

2421
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:37,360
Absolutely not just a.
I had to go back and take human 

2422
02:00:37,401 --> 02:00:42,401
sexuality classes so that I can feel 
comfortable saying the f word on your 

2423
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:42,401
show.
Really.

2424
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:44,660
Absolutely you to take.
I took it years ago.

2425
02:00:45,050 --> 02:00:50,050
It helped me with dealing with my own 
upbringing and my conservative 

2426
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:54,780
conservative.
When you grew up in a time with no 

2427
02:00:54,780 --> 02:00:54,780
internet man,
the world's changed.

2428
02:00:54,780 --> 02:00:54,780
Absolutely.
working it out.

2429
02:00:54,870 --> 02:00:56,630
Doctors dot dropping,
f bombs left and right.

2430
02:00:56,631 --> 02:01:01,631
And these days,
oh you got a fucking broken leg kit and 

2431
02:01:01,631 --> 02:01:02,510
being from New York,
you know,

2432
02:01:02,810 --> 02:01:07,810
fuck is the what?
And his first and idea is second and 

2433
02:01:07,810 --> 02:01:09,180
fuck his third.
yeah,

2434
02:01:09,230 --> 02:01:10,850
it's a common one.
It's a common one,

2435
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:13,820
but there are better words in some of 
us.

2436
02:01:13,821 --> 02:01:14,630
there are better words.

2437
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:20,220
Again,
this people have this response to the 

2438
02:01:20,220 --> 02:01:22,390
testosterone.
They developed this anxiety issue,

2439
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:24,030
panic attack,
panic attack,

2440
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:26,980
but what exactly is a panic attack like 
what's going on when you,

2441
02:01:27,430 --> 02:01:32,430
it's an explosive fear of the unknown 
where they think something bad's going 

2442
02:01:32,430 --> 02:01:36,151
to happen to them and they get 
hyperventilation and they get a fast 

2443
02:01:37,571 --> 02:01:42,571
pulse and from the hyperventilation they
can actually pass out because they 

2444
02:01:42,571 --> 02:01:46,070
changed the ph of the blood.
We had a guy in the ufc that was in the,

2445
02:01:46,071 --> 02:01:48,410
um,
in the locker room about the fight,

2446
02:01:48,650 --> 02:01:53,650
had a panic attack and was 
hyperventilating and they actually 

2447
02:01:53,650 --> 02:01:56,351
pulled them from the fight,
haven't breathed it into a brown paper 

2448
02:01:56,351 --> 02:01:56,900
bag or a plastic bag or put one of those
black hoods over their head.

2449
02:01:56,930 --> 02:01:57,710
Well,
what does that do?

2450
02:01:58,130 --> 02:02:00,500
What the lag.
What it is is,

2451
02:02:00,570 --> 02:02:01,910
uh,
when you hyperventilate,

2452
02:02:01,911 --> 02:02:06,911
you're blowing in,
you're getting in too much oxygen and 

2453
02:02:06,911 --> 02:02:07,880
getting rid of your calcium and it falls
out of solutions in calcium's,

2454
02:02:07,881 --> 02:02:12,881
responsible for a neuro conductivity.
So when you breathe in too much or 

2455
02:02:12,881 --> 02:02:17,051
giving you a hyper ventilate,
you create a change in the acid balance,

2456
02:02:17,541 --> 02:02:20,570
acid base and calcium is used to try and
stabilize it.

2457
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:22,880
So what happens is it falls out of 
solution.

2458
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:25,880
Calcium hydroxide.
What does the black bag do?

2459
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:28,130
A,
I was just being funny.

2460
02:02:28,910 --> 02:02:32,420
Brown paper bag.
I like plastic over brown paper.

2461
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:34,790
Brown paper makes too much crunching.
Noise,

2462
02:02:34,820 --> 02:02:39,820
cocaine.
So the idea of a bag being that you're 

2463
02:02:39,820 --> 02:02:42,011
not getting all the oxygen from around 
where you're breathing in carbon 

2464
02:02:42,011 --> 02:02:43,820
dioxide,
you need to bring back your blowing from

2465
02:02:43,821 --> 02:02:48,821
hyperventilation.
You blow out a lot of carbon dioxide 

2466
02:02:48,821 --> 02:02:49,130
which your body actually needs.
You know,

2467
02:02:49,131 --> 02:02:52,580
if you give someone pure oxygen,
you can stop their breathing because the

2468
02:02:52,581 --> 02:02:55,520
balance of breathing is between oxygen 
and carbon dioxide.

2469
02:02:55,910 --> 02:02:58,490
The carbon dioxide is actually what 
stimulates you to breathe.

2470
02:02:58,910 --> 02:03:01,740
What about those like oxygen bars,
places?

2471
02:03:02,650 --> 02:03:06,520
What's the actor's name who has such 
with age?

2472
02:03:06,870 --> 02:03:09,530
A woody harrelson I think has a lot of 
the action bars.

2473
02:03:09,890 --> 02:03:10,700
Yeah,
they're great.

2474
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:11,450
Uh,
you know,

2475
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:15,860
Michael Jackson used to sleep in a 
hyperbaric chamber.

2476
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:20,890
He did,
and that has higher oxygen 

2477
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:20,890
concentration,
so getting more oxygen,

2478
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:21,890
you know,
in las vegas,

2479
02:03:21,891 --> 02:03:24,170
you go to the airport,
I was just there and they have all these

2480
02:03:24,171 --> 02:03:29,171
oxygen bars there.
So after you had been bombed out for 

2481
02:03:29,171 --> 02:03:32,050
three days,
playing every night until two in the 

2482
02:03:32,050 --> 02:03:32,050
morning,
we're never getting to bed.

2483
02:03:32,050 --> 02:03:32,550
Oxygen can help you,
uh,

2484
02:03:32,690 --> 02:03:36,380
with some improvement in improving your 
focus.

2485
02:03:36,470 --> 02:03:38,840
But don't they pump it into the casinos 
as well?

2486
02:03:38,841 --> 02:03:40,550
Yes.
The supposedly is what they said.

2487
02:03:40,551 --> 02:03:43,250
I don't know what the true keeps you up.
That's what I've heard too,

2488
02:03:43,490 --> 02:03:45,830
but I don't know if that's true.
We need to find.

2489
02:03:45,890 --> 02:03:50,890
I don't know if they would ever fucking 
admit that you bring an oxygen meter in 

2490
02:03:50,890 --> 02:03:53,660
and if it's a 21 percent or higher,
you know they are because it's,

2491
02:03:53,661 --> 02:03:56,720
I think 19 percent in the natural world.
The fucking tackle.

2492
02:03:56,721 --> 02:04:01,721
You want them to oxygen.
That's why they have all those cards 

2493
02:04:01,721 --> 02:04:05,980
tackle them.
That's why they have the cameras up 

2494
02:04:05,980 --> 02:04:08,021
there to make sure you don't bring 
oxygen meters and the frisky for oxygen 

2495
02:04:08,021 --> 02:04:10,901
meter walk through the door.
And the idea that the oxygen keeps you 

2496
02:04:10,901 --> 02:04:10,901
awake,
is that what it is?

2497
02:04:10,901 --> 02:04:13,190
Correct.
WhaT he says is false.

2498
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:15,490
Snopes says it's false.
how the fuck do they know?

2499
02:04:20,230 --> 02:04:22,850
It's just the gambling.
Gambling is.

2500
02:04:24,770 --> 02:04:29,770
Could you ask him,
is it true that when you ask for a 

2501
02:04:29,770 --> 02:04:29,770
drink,
when you're playing craps,

2502
02:04:29,770 --> 02:04:32,150
they put a lot of alcohol in it,
so it disinhibition so that you put more

2503
02:04:32,151 --> 02:04:37,151
money down then you have.
Well they definitely give you good free 

2504
02:04:37,151 --> 02:04:38,100
drinks when you're gambling.
that was good.

2505
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:40,530
That is a crazy fucking thing that 
they're allowed to do.

2506
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:45,560
Give you free drugs That lower your 
inhibitions and cause you to make 

2507
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:50,540
irresponsible decisions while you're 
doing something that involves gambling 

2508
02:04:50,540 --> 02:04:53,700
and fucking crazy.
But so they got oxygen there.

2509
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:55,980
I supported him 100 percent with it.
I've done those.

2510
02:04:55,981 --> 02:04:57,630
Um,
those oxygen bars.

2511
02:04:57,780 --> 02:05:02,780
I did one in vegas once we sat down and 
tried it and my friend eddie and I was 

2512
02:05:02,780 --> 02:05:02,780
like,
you're feeling anything.

2513
02:05:02,780 --> 02:05:04,920
He's like,
did you get to sit in their flavored?

2514
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:10,280
Probably was going up my nose or sucking
on it.

2515
02:05:10,700 --> 02:05:15,700
I don't even remember.
But I remember like given up after 

2516
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:15,700
awhile,
it's like,

2517
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:15,700
this isn't new,
this is not enough.

2518
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:17,100
It's not like you have a shot and you're
like,

2519
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:19,230
woo,
like this is working.

2520
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:21,510
Maybe you awake.
that was the problem.

2521
02:05:21,511 --> 02:05:22,620
You had to be asleep to do it.

2522
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:27,920
Oh.
So if you're asleep and you have little 

2523
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:27,920
oxygenic does better.
The guy at the float lab,

2524
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:31,830
he pumps a oxygen into the isolation 
tanks.

2525
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:34,020
He uh,
has an oxygen scrubber,

2526
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:38,520
like one of those ones that make those 
weird noises and you know,

2527
02:05:38,521 --> 02:05:39,690
those auctions,
scrubber things,

2528
02:05:39,890 --> 02:05:43,470
it pumps air into the isolation tank to 
enhance it.

2529
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:45,180
Doing that tomorrow for the first time.
Where,

2530
02:05:45,181 --> 02:05:45,960
which,
which place?

2531
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:47,550
Venice float lab.
Yeah.

2532
02:05:47,820 --> 02:05:49,010
it's awesome.
I love it.

2533
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:51,730
Yeah.
So I wrote lab a life changing word.

2534
02:05:51,740 --> 02:05:53,430
I going to have some flashbacks or 
something.

2535
02:05:53,580 --> 02:05:55,320
You mighT.
how long are you in the tank?

2536
02:05:55,530 --> 02:06:00,530
Depends.
You could do it for as little as an 

2537
02:06:00,530 --> 02:06:00,530
hour.
Miki.

2538
02:06:00,530 --> 02:06:00,600
I've done it for a half an hour.
If I just want to relax,

2539
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:02,850
I have something to do and I'm just 
trying to unwind.

2540
02:06:02,851 --> 02:06:07,851
I got three kids,
so I'm thinking three hours signal 

2541
02:06:07,851 --> 02:06:08,780
deprivation it.
Two hours is good.

2542
02:06:09,170 --> 02:06:11,300
It helps.
I do it every time.

2543
02:06:11,380 --> 02:06:12,060
Come down.
Yeah.

2544
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:13,830
Yeah.
What,

2545
02:06:13,831 --> 02:06:14,850
uh,
what helps about it?

2546
02:06:15,970 --> 02:06:20,760
Um,
you think in a clear fashion like things

2547
02:06:20,761 --> 02:06:22,170
are coming to you and I believe,
you know,

2548
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:23,070
it's just,
you,

2549
02:06:23,130 --> 02:06:28,130
you're able to kind of work through it a
little bit better where there's no 

2550
02:06:28,130 --> 02:06:28,130
distractions.
The distractions,

2551
02:06:28,130 --> 02:06:28,530
there's not.
Yeah,

2552
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:30,470
you don't got other stuff going on.
And,

2553
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:35,560
and I,
I work better internalizing things like 

2554
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:38,871
that.
Like Was talking about the counseling 

2555
02:06:38,871 --> 02:06:41,241
for me,
that's just my personality would never 

2556
02:06:41,241 --> 02:06:43,851
work because uh,
the person I'm talking to doesn't know 

2557
02:06:43,851 --> 02:06:46,401
what I went through,
but in my own mind when my own dialogue 

2558
02:06:46,401 --> 02:06:49,920
is talking to me back because I,
the last time I was talking to,

2559
02:06:49,950 --> 02:06:53,780
I remember talking to myself and I was 
talking back to me it was,

2560
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:54,750
yeah,
it was very,

2561
02:06:55,020 --> 02:07:00,020
it was very strange.
But that's what was happening was I was 

2562
02:07:00,020 --> 02:07:02,961
bringing up things and I was talking and
I was responding in fashion with what I 

2563
02:07:03,301 --> 02:07:05,610
was talking about,
like calming myself down.

2564
02:07:05,611 --> 02:07:06,930
And it just worked better

2565
02:07:08,020 --> 02:07:10,490
the way I describe it as a,
the first 20 minutes or so,

2566
02:07:10,570 --> 02:07:13,330
me and the tank is sort of like a 
seminar on my own life.

2567
02:07:13,850 --> 02:07:18,850
So giving myself advice because the mine
untethered from the body's very 

2568
02:07:18,850 --> 02:07:23,131
difficult to get to that state unless 
you're doing some really fucking heavy 

2569
02:07:23,131 --> 02:07:26,190
meditation for long periods of time.
It's very difficult to achieve this kind

2570
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:31,200
of state.
You get in an isolation tank after half 

2571
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:31,200
an hour just floating.
It takes me a while to get there.

2572
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:32,280
Yeah.
You got to compensate.

2573
02:07:32,300 --> 02:07:33,170
I don't know.
I don't.

2574
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:34,550
I mean I don't do it often.
Yeah,

2575
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:36,220
that's a big of it too.
It takes me a while,

2576
02:07:36,221 --> 02:07:39,280
but once I'm there it yeah,
it does help.

2577
02:07:39,281 --> 02:07:43,360
I do leave clear and it is something 
that I think is a benefit,

2578
02:07:43,361 --> 02:07:46,780
especially for things like ptsd and 
mental issue.

2579
02:07:46,781 --> 02:07:48,910
You know,
if you had one near you and you could do

2580
02:07:48,911 --> 02:07:53,911
it on a regular basis,
I think it would help even more because 

2581
02:07:53,911 --> 02:07:55,120
it's part of it is relaxing with the 
experience itself.

2582
02:07:55,210 --> 02:07:57,880
The experience to me,
because I have one of my basement,

2583
02:07:57,881 --> 02:08:00,550
it's a very natural part of life.
I go in there all the time,

2584
02:08:00,551 --> 02:08:02,080
so it's a natural thing.
It's not like,

2585
02:08:02,081 --> 02:08:03,130
oh,
what are we doing here?

2586
02:08:03,370 --> 02:08:04,600
It's like,
here We go again.

2587
02:08:04,630 --> 02:08:05,710
You know,
it's normal.

2588
02:08:05,711 --> 02:08:07,930
It's almost over,
buddy.

2589
02:08:08,150 --> 02:08:10,210
The other thing too was for me with my 
body,

2590
02:08:10,211 --> 02:08:11,260
just wIth paint,
you know,

2591
02:08:11,261 --> 02:08:16,261
I'm used to walking around at a certain 
comfort level of just the way my body 

2592
02:08:16,261 --> 02:08:17,900
works.
Some laying down in there when my body's

2593
02:08:17,950 --> 02:08:20,800
not supporting itself,
I was able to let that go.

2594
02:08:21,330 --> 02:08:26,330
I let that go and just kind of focused 
like I said on my mind and that's a huge

2595
02:08:27,370 --> 02:08:28,050
thing for me.
Like I.

2596
02:08:28,900 --> 02:08:32,590
It wasn't until I did that the first 
time that I realized how much my body is

2597
02:08:32,591 --> 02:08:34,300
impacting my mind,
you know,

2598
02:08:34,450 --> 02:08:37,420
really just because you get used to 
feeling a certain way the whole time,

2599
02:08:37,421 --> 02:08:41,140
especially with like pain or my leg or 
my knees.

2600
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:44,110
You take that out of the equation,
oh,

2601
02:08:44,310 --> 02:08:45,280
you know,
your mind's like,

2602
02:08:45,281 --> 02:08:50,281
okay,
this let's we can focus on something 

2603
02:08:50,281 --> 02:08:50,860
else and that it is nice and besides the
alleviation of pressure,

2604
02:08:50,890 --> 02:08:52,570
because you're not carrying your weight 
anymore,

2605
02:08:52,571 --> 02:08:57,571
there's also absent salts in it,
which is an excellent source of 

2606
02:08:57,571 --> 02:08:57,950
magnesium,
which also relaxes the muscle.

2607
02:08:57,951 --> 02:08:59,950
So you got like sort of a dual effect 
going on.

2608
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:03,190
You have this no gravity effect because 
you're completely floating,

2609
02:09:03,250 --> 02:09:07,360
you're bobbing in this water and then 
you also have this magnesium when,

2610
02:09:07,361 --> 02:09:12,361
and this,
one of the things that people always 

2611
02:09:12,361 --> 02:09:13,891
recommend for muscle soreness is epson 
salts and this delivery method of 

2612
02:09:14,740 --> 02:09:19,740
getting the magnesium through your skin 
that way supposed to be excellent as 

2613
02:09:19,740 --> 02:09:19,740
well.
It's the biggest organ in the body.

2614
02:09:19,740 --> 02:09:24,420
So it absorbs a lot.
What do we need to do to help more 

2615
02:09:24,420 --> 02:09:25,180
people out here with this?

2616
02:09:25,180 --> 02:09:29,080
To spread the word out about this,
about what you are doing.

2617
02:09:29,380 --> 02:09:34,380
And matthew,
thank you very much for doing this and 

2618
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:34,380
coming on here.
And uh,

2619
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:34,600
and jason,
this is,

2620
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:36,690
this is a very important issue.
And,

2621
02:09:36,691 --> 02:09:41,691
uh,
I think all the things that we've 

2622
02:09:41,691 --> 02:09:41,691
discussed here today,
the,

2623
02:09:41,691 --> 02:09:46,030
the,
the benefits I think could really 

2624
02:09:46,030 --> 02:09:47,080
greatly help a lot of people.
So how do we,

2625
02:09:47,081 --> 02:09:48,550
uh,
how do we spread this?

2626
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:51,250
Well,
as we found out in january,

2627
02:09:51,310 --> 02:09:56,310
you had an impressive response curve for
the program that we did.

2628
02:09:56,770 --> 02:09:58,090
We talked about,
you know,

2629
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:02,200
big foot and we talked about narrows and
we talked about,

2630
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:05,710
yeah,
the injection,

2631
02:10:06,490 --> 02:10:11,490
you know,
everything we've talked about and then 

2632
02:10:11,490 --> 02:10:13,770
lead up to this area of tbi.
I think finding A multitude of avenues.

2633
02:10:14,711 --> 02:10:19,711
That's why I've been dragging matthew 
with me to some of the guys that I know 

2634
02:10:19,711 --> 02:10:23,431
around the states that have shows not 
similar to yours but not as grand and 

2635
02:10:25,510 --> 02:10:30,510
have each helped to make a little dent.
And we just need someone to come up and 

2636
02:10:30,701 --> 02:10:35,701
champion a.
I'm going to get in touch with howard 

2637
02:10:35,701 --> 02:10:37,460
schultz,
who's the ceo of starbucks who,

2638
02:10:37,540 --> 02:10:42,540
uh,
yesterday I had this really great 

2639
02:10:42,540 --> 02:10:45,370
statement he made that we need to honor 
our vets by giving them a concert and a 

2640
02:10:45,381 --> 02:10:48,830
job now in order for them to go to that 
concert.

2641
02:10:48,831 --> 02:10:52,130
And I appreciate and enjoy it and have 
that job.

2642
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:57,160
We have to fix the underlying problem 
not to mask it and therefore letting 

2643
02:10:58,370 --> 02:11:02,450
vets know that there is an option and 
next year,

2644
02:11:02,530 --> 02:11:06,230
uh,
april of finished my book by january and

2645
02:11:06,231 --> 02:11:11,231
then put on a class which will be 
limited to a hundred docs to come in to 

2646
02:11:11,601 --> 02:11:16,601
be trained in this process,
these protocols which are relatively 

2647
02:11:16,601 --> 02:11:16,601
simple,
um,

2648
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:22,180
and then go out and start being 
representative of an alternative to 

2649
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,010
antidepressants,
antianxiety meds,

2650
02:11:25,450 --> 02:11:30,450
bit of an uphill battle that has to be 
fought also with the idea of 

2651
02:11:30,450 --> 02:11:33,720
supplementing hormones to achieve a 
balance in the body.

2652
02:11:33,721 --> 02:11:36,690
Because a lot of people,
when they think of soldiers,

2653
02:11:36,990 --> 02:11:41,990
what do they think of?
They think of these testosterone fueled 

2654
02:11:41,990 --> 02:11:42,480
savage men.
And then,

2655
02:11:42,481 --> 02:11:45,240
you know,
you add testosterone to that boy,

2656
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:50,260
you know,
like you're just gonna make more 

2657
02:11:50,260 --> 02:11:50,260
aggressive,
crazier.

2658
02:11:50,260 --> 02:11:52,760
It doesn't work that way.
The reason what is up yet,

2659
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:56,800
it's uphill battle.
If they weren't in the military,

2660
02:11:56,830 --> 02:12:01,830
they go into a clinic.
Now what's happening is you might have 

2661
02:12:01,830 --> 02:12:02,350
low testosterone syndrome,
let's check you.

2662
02:12:02,351 --> 02:12:07,351
And they do two tests.
And I find that they're low 

2663
02:12:07,351 --> 02:12:09,121
testosterone,
but they don't know the cause for it 

2664
02:12:09,121 --> 02:12:11,131
because they didn't do an extensive 
enough to say that it's due to head 

2665
02:12:11,131 --> 02:12:11,131
trauma,
you know,

2666
02:12:11,131 --> 02:12:15,301
whichever way they can do it,
to get guys onto a ask the history of 

2667
02:12:15,301 --> 02:12:16,540
trauma,
do the lab tests and get them on it,

2668
02:12:16,541 --> 02:12:21,541
but the resistance is because of the 
controversy that has always stood there 

2669
02:12:21,541 --> 02:12:25,621
with testosterone and with the balco and
the barry bonds and all these things 

2670
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:30,610
relative to public guide that negative.
They demonized growth hormone,

2671
02:12:30,611 --> 02:12:34,930
they demonized testosterone instead of 
talking about the benefits of it and how

2672
02:12:34,931 --> 02:12:37,810
it could be utilized in this specific 
situation and it works.

2673
02:12:38,050 --> 02:12:40,510
So anyone who's listening,
you know,

2674
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:46,220
I know someone who might be there to 
connect us with the right people in 

2675
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:47,960
government and so forth to go and do it.
That is the issue.

2676
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:49,550
Knee jerk reaction,
right?

2677
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:52,700
Immediately people want to think of it 
as like,

2678
02:12:52,990 --> 02:12:54,500
this is a.
This is a cheating thing.

2679
02:12:54,530 --> 02:12:55,430
This is a bad thing,
right?

2680
02:12:55,610 --> 02:12:57,080
Just like the salt thing that we were 
talking,

2681
02:12:57,530 --> 02:13:02,530
we'll stop everybody's estrogen 
replacement stopped everybody's insulin 

2682
02:13:02,530 --> 02:13:06,530
replacement or thyroid replacement.
Our body had it from when we were born,

2683
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:09,460
so why do we assume that it's not 
necessary?

2684
02:13:09,461 --> 02:13:14,461
I mean,
I've had a number of women who came in 

2685
02:13:14,461 --> 02:13:15,890
who were significantly testosterone 
deficient with the all the symptoms that

2686
02:13:15,930 --> 02:13:18,290
a woman get from testosterone 
deficiency.

2687
02:13:18,590 --> 02:13:21,620
they're not nice to be around and their 
doctor says,

2688
02:13:21,621 --> 02:13:22,490
well,
you don't need it.

2689
02:13:22,491 --> 02:13:26,330
You just need your estrogen replaced and
they don't even replace the progesterone

2690
02:13:26,331 --> 02:13:29,030
and you need to have that balance so 
they don't get sleep deprivation.

2691
02:13:29,031 --> 02:13:30,470
Developed depression,
panic attack,

2692
02:13:30,471 --> 02:13:32,100
and ended up in the emergency room every
two weeks

2693
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:32,970
like we see.

2694
02:13:34,050 --> 02:13:39,050
My thing too is that I think,
I don't think this is a cure for 

2695
02:13:39,050 --> 02:13:42,801
everybody.
Every single person is going to fall 

2696
02:13:42,801 --> 02:13:42,801
into this category.
You went to war,

2697
02:13:42,801 --> 02:13:44,880
you know,
you suffered some through some stuff and

2698
02:13:44,881 --> 02:13:47,250
now here's your cure.
I don't think that's what it is,

2699
02:13:47,251 --> 02:13:50,970
but I think that there's a.
There's a two stages here.

2700
02:13:50,971 --> 02:13:53,250
There's the stage where,
you know,

2701
02:13:53,251 --> 02:13:58,251
like math,
you talked about where he admitted he 

2702
02:13:58,251 --> 02:13:59,580
didn't feel okay and he was willing to 
go seek some help for it,

2703
02:14:00,090 --> 02:14:03,090
you know,
and hopefully this movie you're watching

2704
02:14:03,091 --> 02:14:05,700
chris,
who's a guy who was tough as nails,

2705
02:14:05,701 --> 02:14:07,380
he was the baddest,
baddest,

2706
02:14:07,670 --> 02:14:09,030
you know,
seal there ever was.

2707
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:14,600
He found a way to admit that he didn't 
feel okay and went and sought some help 

2708
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:16,410
for it.
Then then in seeking help,

2709
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:19,230
there needs to be more pragmatic 
solutions.

2710
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:21,360
Like right now we're looking at the 
thing and it's like,

2711
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:23,490
it's a grab bag,
you know,

2712
02:14:23,491 --> 02:14:27,600
and to me this feels like a,
a mind body solution.

2713
02:14:27,990 --> 02:14:30,570
This isn't,
this isn't freudian counseling,

2714
02:14:30,870 --> 02:14:32,820
this isn't some lady sitting there,
you know,

2715
02:14:33,030 --> 02:14:35,910
god bless these women who work at the va
in the men too.

2716
02:14:35,911 --> 02:14:38,550
Who are these counselors?
Did they go through hell?

2717
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:40,410
I mean,
imagine sitting there every day.

2718
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:45,740
They're on the clock,
they're seeing guys on their lunch 

2719
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:45,740
breaks.
They're seeing people After work.

2720
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:47,580
They have huge hearts,
but they can't handle it,

2721
02:14:47,820 --> 02:14:49,980
you know,
and after awhile you shut down,

2722
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:53,370
you hear this story over and over again,
you see the misery and it's just like,

2723
02:14:53,460 --> 02:14:55,890
it just sucks the life out of them,
you know,

2724
02:14:56,190 --> 02:14:59,550
and,
and so I don't think that's the solution

2725
02:14:59,551 --> 02:15:00,900
for everybody.
I think that there's,

2726
02:15:01,470 --> 02:15:02,280
you know,
there's a,

2727
02:15:02,281 --> 02:15:04,200
there's a number of things that are 
going to help people,

2728
02:15:04,470 --> 02:15:08,120
but If this,
if seeking blood work and seeking a mind

2729
02:15:08,121 --> 02:15:12,470
body solution through medicine is 
available and,

2730
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:17,640
and is out there in the public and is 
getting vetted through other doctors 

2731
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:22,131
and,
and spread among the medical community 

2732
02:15:22,131 --> 02:15:22,170
than these guys have a chance.
But if it's not,

2733
02:15:22,171 --> 02:15:25,500
if it's just one thing,
one doctor sit in here and uh,

2734
02:15:25,501 --> 02:15:30,501
you know,
some guy in Missouri is not gonna make 

2735
02:15:30,501 --> 02:15:30,501
it out to see Dr.
Gordon.

2736
02:15:30,501 --> 02:15:33,690
I think it's really important that you 
said what you said about the it's not 

2737
02:15:33,690 --> 02:15:36,580
the solution for everybody and it's only
one part of it that what we said before,

2738
02:15:36,581 --> 02:15:41,140
thIs is a holistic approach,
but if you don't heal the body,

2739
02:15:41,590 --> 02:15:45,700
it's going to be incredibly difficult to
put the mind at peace and it's healing.

2740
02:15:45,701 --> 02:15:48,220
The body's not necessarily going to put 
the mind at peace,

2741
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:51,070
but it's a step in the right direction 
where there's.

2742
02:15:51,250 --> 02:15:56,250
I mean it's you have nothing to lose.
You do it and you try and if that's not 

2743
02:15:58,150 --> 02:16:00,610
really what's going on,
then you take the next step,

2744
02:16:00,790 --> 02:16:03,980
but you don't know if you don't look.
Yeah,

2745
02:16:03,990 --> 02:16:05,170
you don't know.
You don't know.

2746
02:16:05,171 --> 02:16:10,171
And matthew came down,
we took a look and it's a simple blood 

2747
02:16:10,171 --> 02:16:10,171
test.
Simple blood work.

2748
02:16:10,630 --> 02:16:14,140
Okay,
so for the guy out there or the gal with

2749
02:16:14,141 --> 02:16:19,141
ptsd,
with depression that's dealing with the 

2750
02:16:19,141 --> 02:16:20,880
things that they have some sort of 
traumatic brain injuries in their past,

2751
02:16:20,881 --> 02:16:22,950
it could be contributing to this.
What's their step?

2752
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:24,250
What do they do?
Well,

2753
02:16:24,251 --> 02:16:27,910
they can go to the website which is tbi,
medlegal.com.

2754
02:16:27,970 --> 02:16:29,200
Tbi,
medlegal,

2755
02:16:29,250 --> 02:16:30,460
tbi,
med

2756
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:35,010
legal.com
and put in an application and those that

2757
02:16:35,011 --> 02:16:39,360
are coming through and it asks military 
and asked the type of injury you had and

2758
02:16:39,361 --> 02:16:44,361
what medications you're on and the 
military get put into a separate 

2759
02:16:44,361 --> 02:16:46,680
grouping and we're waiting for funding 
to come in.

2760
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:52,040
Uh,
so that we can start takIng more of the 

2761
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:53,721
people.
and this is the laboratory testing has 

2762
02:16:53,721 --> 02:16:56,250
always been a 100 percent covered.
The treatment wasn't met,

2763
02:16:56,251 --> 02:16:58,500
paid for some of them,
but I help him in his,

2764
02:16:58,610 --> 02:17:03,610
uh,
in all their situation and we're hoping 

2765
02:17:03,610 --> 02:17:03,610
to get someone who will champion with 
some money.

2766
02:17:03,610 --> 02:17:08,481
I had one patient offer a significant 
amount and that'll help to cover about 

2767
02:17:08,481 --> 02:17:10,740
100 patients.
So it'll cover everything for a year and

2768
02:17:10,741 --> 02:17:14,130
cost for treatment.
I meAn the blended to start from that we

2769
02:17:14,131 --> 02:17:19,050
developed about 10 years ago is $100 for
six months supply.

2770
02:17:19,460 --> 02:17:21,260
Well,
let's talk about doing something through

2771
02:17:21,261 --> 02:17:26,261
this show and let's talk about promoting
something like maybe through a 

2772
02:17:26,261 --> 02:17:26,600
kickstarter or go fund me or something 
like that at all.

2773
02:17:26,601 --> 02:17:31,601
Contribute to it and we'll try to get 
other people to contribute to it and 

2774
02:17:31,601 --> 02:17:32,730
let's just try to get something where 
there's at least

2775
02:17:33,010 --> 02:17:38,010
a point of.
Have a starting point for a lot of 

2776
02:17:38,010 --> 02:17:38,010
people.
It'd be great.

2777
02:17:38,010 --> 02:17:40,330
Let's do that on my end.
One thing you can,

2784
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:58,390

2787

I also have my own kickstarter up right 
now.

2788
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:05,050
You can search it up.
It's called hidden wounds.

2789
02:18:05,970 --> 02:18:10,970
And what is this for?
It's a two part book I'm putting 

2790
02:18:10,970 --> 02:18:11,470
together in the first half is about tbi,
tbi,

2791
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:15,940
and just my experience of going through 
it in the second half will be about ptsd

2792
02:18:15,941 --> 02:18:20,941
and my search to kind of deal with that,
which that's my journey right now is 

2793
02:18:20,941 --> 02:18:23,740
going on that and figuring that out and 
then once the book is done,

2794
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:26,980
which I'm hoping by June,
2015,

2795
02:18:27,320 --> 02:18:32,320
a 25 percent will go into this nonprofit
organization that we got going

2796
02:18:32,780 --> 02:18:37,780
and when is american sniper coming out 
and who's in it and give me the clinics 

2797
02:18:37,910 --> 02:18:38,840
