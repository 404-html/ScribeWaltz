1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,091
Drive by day,

2
00:00:01,091 --> 00:00:02,800
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:03,993
All Day.

4
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:04,441
Okay.

5
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:04,591
Now,

6
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:06,750
what's the situation with
Cyborg at this point?

7
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:08,070
The chick pissed hot again,

8
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,050
waiting for the,

9
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,550
to see what the commission does,

10
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,800
what kind of suspension she's getting.

11
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,680
At least a year,

12
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,910
at least.

13
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,481
What she pissed.

14
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,210
Hot four is also a,

15
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,480
an anti androgen.

16
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,720
It's a Dyo has DHT inhibitor.

17
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,320
I used to rub that shit in my
head to prevent a hair loss.

18
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,640
They might give her three age t and it's
also used by people who take steroids

19
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,061
to,

20
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:30,510
uh,

21
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,430
diminish the effects of,

22
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:33,090
um,

23
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,800
of like when females take steroids,

24
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,150
diminish the effect.

25
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,710
It's also a,

26
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:38,760
it's a masking agent,

27
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,230
so if you've take steroids,

28
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:42,150
some people take that
stuff as a masking Asian,

29
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:42,871
she's 31.

30
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,370
It's also a diuretic.

31
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,220
So it's a very weird drug called Spiro.

32
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:47,641
No lack.

33
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:49,260
Dane lack dean lactone.

34
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,050
But it has many different uses.

35
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:52,561
If she,

36
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:53,430
if she gets three years,

37
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:56,970
that's what's an argument
that it's not a good argument.

38
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,620
All the arguments that she gave her,

39
00:00:58,621 --> 00:00:59,454
not good arguments,

40
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,610
that she took something out of competition
that she was told by her doctor that

41
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,251
it'd be okay.

42
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,890
When it's clearly on the Usada banned,

43
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,590
blessed,

44
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,880
it's 100% band.

45
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,540
It's not like there's certain things
you could take out us out of context,

46
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,130
like the big ones pot.

47
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,460
Like say if they catch you tomorrow and
you're supposed to fight in six months

48
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:20,250
and you're smoking weed like crazy
and they test you and they go,

49
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:20,431
look,

50
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:21,061
we got test to go,

51
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:21,211
look,

52
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:22,920
I just wanna let you know I've
been smoking a lot of weed.

53
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,401
They're like,

54
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:23,790
okay,

55
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,720
as long as it's not steroids.

56
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,110
That's why John Jones didn't
get in trouble when he
pissed hot for cocaine three

57
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:33,750
weeks out of the fight with Daniel Cormier
because that's not in competition and

58
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:35,190
it's not a performance enhancing drug.

59
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,941
He's just partying.

60
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:36,600
Right?

61
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,300
So what this is though is a
performance enhancing drug,

62
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,250
not just a performance enhancing drug,

63
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:46,251
but problematic in that it inhibits its
performance enhancing in that it works

64
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:47,850
as a diuretic.

65
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,080
You're not allowed to use diuretics,

66
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,011
but it's,

67
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:52,230
it also inhibits your,

68
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:52,950
um,

69
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,221
the,

70
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:55,500
their ability to detect steroids in you.

71
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,270
She's in trouble.

72
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,470
She doesn't show you saw it
as going to eat her ass up.

73
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,940
And if she gets three years,

74
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:00,901
well,

75
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:01,500
here's the thing,

76
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,333
how old is she?

77
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,810
She's in her mid thirties.

78
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,490
They,

79
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:04,880
they,

80
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,360
it's time to get tested her because
she passed on three world title fights.

81
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,100
They had three world title fights
lined up for her at one 45,

82
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,280
which is the weight class that she asked
for that she said she couldn't make it

83
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,240
in eight weeks.

84
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,430
And so then they gave her
more weeks and they gave her,

85
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,150
yeah,

86
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,200
they gave her a third test and they're
like [inaudible] up and whether or not

87
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:26,190
they were going to test her anyway,

88
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:26,700
who knows?

89
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,190
But that's when they tested her
and that's when she pissed hot.

90
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,090
It makes sense.

91
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,500
And she did not reveal before that,

92
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,900
that she was taking that and then she
does the whole thing is she's in trouble.

93
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,830
Have you seen a skip in all babies?

94
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,260
Huge.

95
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,770
This is a skeptical baby now.

96
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,490
Somebody.

97
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,323
Somebody that everybody.

98
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,293
Yeah,

99
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,190
Ken's Kobe ugly that look at this baby.

100
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,500
That's so funny.

101
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,500
It's like bitch,

102
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,620
that's skeptical snakes.

103
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:54,820
So skeptical.

104
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,893
Oh,

105
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,790
with with cyborg super schedules.

106
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,880
Have you seen the skeptical house?

107
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,640
The motherfucker,

108
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,560
so skeptical.

109
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,470
Skeptical Cadillac,

110
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,590
Cadillac House.

111
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,513
What the fuck?

112
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,820
Is that a real house?

113
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,480
Yes.

114
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,590
Those were windows,

115
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,240
but the fucking window
is that skeptical window.

116
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,670
Do you think they did that on purpose?

117
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:19,504
Hell,

118
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,340
what's wrong with people?

119
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,650
It almost seems like that was an accident.

120
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,060
It's so funny.

121
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,750
Go with Cyborg.

122
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,521
She gets three years.

123
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:28,330
She's in trouble.

124
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,163
I financially too.

125
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,750
When Rhonda loss again and
she's throwing shade at Rhonda,

126
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:32,560
my bitch,

127
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:32,920
you,

128
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,370
you need,

129
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,590
you just got busted for steroids.

130
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,630
Shameless or steroids.

131
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,510
She got busted for a dihydrotestosterone.

132
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:40,621
No,

133
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:40,690
no,

134
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:40,870
no.

135
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,710
It's not a precursor.

136
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,590
It's a dihydrotestosterone inhibitor.

137
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,551
That's what it is.

138
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:46,120
Inhibitor.

139
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,570
Yeah,

140
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,051
and to me,

141
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:47,800
my brain goes,

142
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,730
you're in trouble.

143
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,110
You're in trouble.

144
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,190
She certainly could be in trouble.

145
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,330
It's one thing if she got,

146
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,850
she said it was,

147
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,330
she's got a bunch of issues because she
really did record body getting down to

148
00:03:58,331 --> 00:03:59,540
one 40 which downtime,

149
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,480
which I'm sure that that seems
fine when you wreck your body,

150
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:07,690
like I think she's saying that she takes
in too much water now and her body is

151
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:12,040
like trying to hold on to water and that
they gave her a drug to diminish the

152
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:12,874
amount of water.

153
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,210
I talked to a couple
of doctors about this.

154
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:20,140
I asked some questions and they all
gave me that snake face generally

155
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,860
in there,

156
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,190
you know her background too.

157
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,660
It's like,

158
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,493
fuck man,

159
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,660
he don't fuck with anything that's
illegal and you definitely don't fuck with

160
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:32,200
anything that people use because
they're women that take steroids.

161
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,020
Even if it's just a coincidence
that you happened to be,

162
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:38,150
you should look at every fucking
label extremely carefully.

163
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,480
Is that the worst cut of all time?

164
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,890
Yeah,

165
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,700
it's one of them.

166
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,361
What do you mean cut?

167
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:43,991
But here's the thing,

168
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:44,824
man,

169
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,050
thought of all chis Diego Sanchez made
one 45 be fought and won 85 and ultimate

170
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,630
fighter one Kenny Floyd.

171
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,620
Here's the problem.

172
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,680
She fucking dead lifts 305 pounds a
couple weeks after passing on fights,

173
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,030
she passes on the fight and then puts up
Instagrams of her dead lifting massive

174
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:04,864
weight.

175
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,741
You're in,

176
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:06,051
you know,

177
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:10,750
and it was whoever the fuck handles her
Twitter account because I wrote that up

178
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,290
because a I,

179
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,360
me and Brett Akimoto,

180
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,320
we're having a discussion
about it on Twitter.

181
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,273
Very good dude.

182
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,700
We were having a little back and
forth on Twitter about it and uh,

183
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:18,911
you know,

184
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:19,241
he said,

185
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:21,010
doesn't it weird that she's
not fighting for the title?

186
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:21,311
And I'm like,

187
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:25,930
what's weird is that they pack that
she passed on title fight and then post

188
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,740
Instagram photos of her dead lifting and
then she responded that it's just like

189
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,820
what football players do
when they're not in camp.

190
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,251
And I'm like,

191
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:33,970
what?

192
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,750
You saw that,

193
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,070
that golden snitch was like,

194
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:36,400
what?

195
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,560
What'd you say song?

196
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:37,960
He,

197
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,660
she's not writing now I'm looking
at the English is perfect.

198
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:40,901
I'm like,

199
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:41,734
this is not,

200
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,330
this is whoever works with her or her
boyfriend or whoever the fuck handles the,

201
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,460
the Instagram account.

202
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:46,870
I'm like,

203
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,710
that's no excuse.

204
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,320
There's a lot of maintenance that
you do that's not dead lifting.

205
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:51,850
305 fucking pounds.

206
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,980
You do that to put on mass.

207
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,100
That is why you dead lift you
dead lift to put fucking mass.

208
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,200
She's got Muto mass.

209
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,090
He's got plenty of mass.

210
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,950
She has no problem with mass,

211
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:04,770
you know?

212
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,000
I mean,

213
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,960
that's not what she needs.

214
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:08,960
If she really wants a fight at 145 pounds
and she needs more than eight weeks to

215
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:09,794
make the weight,

216
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,890
what she should be doing
is longterm cardio.

217
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,210
I guess that's what
she's doing too though,

218
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:14,510
Jo.

219
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:14,841
She goes,

220
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,040
I do that and then the morning
I run every morning though.

221
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:17,451
Dude,

222
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:19,160
come the fuck on.

223
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,040
Those are,

224
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,280
those aren't as heavy as they
learn to develop that power son.

225
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,040
No,

226
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,150
no,

227
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:25,251
no.

228
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,450
That's 300 some pounds.

229
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,770
That's 305 pounds,

230
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:28,604
bro.

231
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,403
That's what she's doing.

232
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,530
This is youtube though.

233
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,383
Why did she tag?

234
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,260
Why did she take Gabby Garcia?

235
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,213
That's worse.

236
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,710
Get here we go see a help tab.

237
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:39,020
You just started curling that shit.

238
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,070
You have the same doctor.

239
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,533
I Dunno.

240
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,650
Fuck say look,

241
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,090
the whole thing is awful.

242
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,900
It's awful.

243
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,341
It's awful.

244
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:48,620
I whoever the fuck is he in her
corner that let her post that video.

245
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:48,951
I'd be like,

246
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:49,101
Hey,

247
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:49,221
hey,

248
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:49,550
hey,

249
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,420
what are you doing with your phone?

250
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,680
What are you doing with your phone?

251
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,710
You're going to put that online,

252
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,370
get the fuck out.

253
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,210
Give me just the golden snitches
and literally just waiting.

254
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,780
Yeah.

255
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,270
If he's talking to a woman,

256
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,700
dead lifting 305 for
reps were going there.

257
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:02,810
6:00 AM tomorrow morning.

258
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,320
Yeah.

259
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,110
Boom.

260
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,943
I mean,

261
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,211
look,

262
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:09,200
it is possible that you could get that
big and that jacked without anything,

263
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,650
but it takes a long fucking time
and that's what you're doing.

264
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,000
That's what you're doing all the time.

265
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,240
If you look at some of those crossfit
gals that some of those are on steroids,

266
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,440
100% but some of them are not and you can
get big if you have the right genetics

267
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,910
and you do that kind of lifting.

268
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,150
Yeah,

269
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,880
but that kind of lifting is for
people that want to put on power.

270
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,530
She's got ridiculous power.

271
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,490
Cyborg has some of the nastiest power
you're ever going to see in women's MMA

272
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,630
most probably the most.

273
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,800
The most it right up there with,

274
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,430
well,

275
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,840
she has the full range.

276
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:40,520
Like she'll kick you a knee you and
punch you and elbow you where Nunez Nunez

277
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:41,271
will kick you hard.

278
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:44,040
But it's her punches that are fucking
ferocious and she doesn't hit hard and

279
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:44,480
sideboard.

280
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,060
No Way.

281
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,550
Sorry.

282
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,270
Subway hits you like
Wendy Tyson with braids.

283
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,780
She hits.

284
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,051
Yeah,

285
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,010
she hits girls.

286
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,460
You see the cop?

287
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,440
No fucking kind of shut off the bat.

288
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,150
She makes worldclass girls look like that.

289
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:57,040
Grandma and my cousin,

290
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,700
she's a beast monster.

291
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,040
Unfortunate that there's
so much controversy.

292
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,760
Like I would love if there was someone
like cyborg with no shade attached to it,

293
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:06,470
no weirdness attached to it.

294
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:08,450
But now she's got these
two strikes against her.

295
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,860
Will Amanda Nunez,

296
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,060
she has no shade.

297
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:11,270
Yes.

298
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,350
She knocks girls out.

299
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:13,184
She just Merck,

300
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,083
Misha Tate,

301
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,620
eh.

302
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:14,811
You know,

303
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:18,170
we can argue probably the number two most
famous girl of all time in women's MMA

304
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:18,841
and it's just Merck.

305
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:19,610
The number one.

306
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:19,761
Yeah.

307
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,170
Here's your star with no shade.

308
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,410
Yeah.

309
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,010
Great Person.
