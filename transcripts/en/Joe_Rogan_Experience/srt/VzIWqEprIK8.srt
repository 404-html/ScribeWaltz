1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,800
I'm working on my second photo book.

3
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:06,740
My first one came out and uh,

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,540
the second one's going to be pretty cool
cause it's all my North Korea shots.

5
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:10,374
That'll be crazy.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:10,951
Oh Wow.

7
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:12,450
You went to North Korea to where?

8
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,220
We used to get that visa a few years ago.

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,940
So it was a sad when Kim
Jong Il was still alive.

10
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,280
Uh,

11
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,530
it was a Kim Jong Il.

12
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:19,860
Yeah.

13
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,350
They'll let last days of Kim
Jong Il before Kim Jong Moon.

14
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:23,880
Yeah.

15
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,510
Yeah.

16
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,530
And it was just a,

17
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:25,891
you know,

18
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:28,140
like when I was in new Iran,

19
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,890
just like they point you with
what you're supposed to look at.

20
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,740
Don't look over here.

21
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,170
It's a propaganda to how much
time did you spend a North Korea?

22
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,360
About a week I was in Pyongyang and the
areas around Pyongyang and then I went

23
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:42,660
there via Beijing and then
from there up to Mongolia,

24
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:45,180
then over to Butan what
was North Korea life?

25
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:45,970
Just sad,

26
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:46,271
you know,

27
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:50,070
this poor people who are
scared of their government.

28
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,300
And uh,

29
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,300
my tour guides since I went there alone,

30
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,040
they were very suspicious of me.

31
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:56,560
So sure.

32
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,200
You put two tour spies on me,

33
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,050
the Nice one who talked to me and the
main one who just skeleton took notes and

34
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,120
every day the guy would ask me
basically the same question.

35
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:10,620
It's like when a detective is trying
to peel the layers of onion skin off.

36
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,530
So you said you're a businessman.

37
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:13,801
I'm like,

38
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:14,634
yeah,

39
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,271
I like it.

40
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:16,030
So what do you do?

41
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,231
Like,

42
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:16,411
you know,

43
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:17,250
I edit books,

44
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,940
which is true mine and it's a really,

45
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:21,780
what are the books about it?

46
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:21,991
I said,

47
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:22,231
well,

48
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:22,790
you know,

49
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,161
uh,

50
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:25,800
often they're not that good at winging it.

51
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,650
And so you're all putting one hotel,

52
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:29,251
uh,

53
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:31,800
you and the Dutch tourists
and the Australians.

54
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,410
Everyone's in the one hotel
across the bridge that's with men,

55
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:34,951
with rifles.

56
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:35,940
You're not going anywhere.

57
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,770
And so every day they go on their buses
and I get in the car and the Australians

58
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:41,610
recognize me,

59
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,310
the Brits recognize me
and they all want photos.

60
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,380
And you're walking to the,

61
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:47,214
um,

62
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,150
uh,

63
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,811
whatever that,

64
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:50,070
that room is the,

65
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:50,904
um,

66
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,070
the room where the north and south meet,

67
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,060
uh,

68
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,520
whether they come in through the
northern door and the southern doors,

69
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:58,470
that blue room on the Dsj,

70
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,480
uh,

71
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,721
I'll,

72
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:00,990
I'll come up with a joint.

73
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,651
The JSA,

74
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:02,850
the joint security area,

75
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:03,684
something like that.

76
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,290
I pulled one of the
Australians to the side.

77
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,780
I said,

78
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,500
can you please call your friends off me?

79
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,030
Because my tour spy is starting to ask
me really weird questions about why

80
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:17,760
people want their photo with me.

81
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,950
And if I'm caught being in movies,

82
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:20,784
writing books,

83
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,020
rock and roll,

84
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:24,840
I'm going downtown for a meeting
that I might not get out of.

85
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,690
And so he cooled out all
his Australian friends.

86
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,320
But then there's this one British guy
who just kept getting in my face with the

87
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:33,720
camera cause y'all are getting
taken to the same places.

88
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,160
And I'll never forget this.

89
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:35,994
My tour guide,

90
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,950
who for the previous three days was like,

91
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,250
his English was from school like Ha Henry.

92
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:41,640
Uh,

93
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,730
he went from that to how
does this guy know you?

94
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,680
And all of a sudden his
English was as good as mine.

95
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:47,100
I'm like,

96
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,970
oh no,

97
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,530
and I'm not good at lying.

98
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:49,921
So I said,

99
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,180
I met him in the breakfast room.

100
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:51,631
I Dunno,

101
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:52,590
maybe he's hot for me.

102
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:53,011
I have no,

103
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:56,310
I just tried to explain it away
and I just had to kind of go,

104
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:56,701
I don't know,

105
00:02:56,701 --> 00:03:00,430
and I had to try and avoid this guy and I,

106
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,241
I was getting,

107
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:04,210
I was really nervous the last day I was
there when they finally took me back to

108
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,320
the airport in Beijing.

109
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,621
I'm like,

110
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,101
damn man,

111
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:07,420
am I really getting on this plane?

112
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,770
And when the plane took off,

113
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:08,951
man,

114
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:09,550
I just like,

115
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:09,971
okay,

116
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:10,750
I did that,

117
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,520
but why wouldn't you just say,

118
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:13,600
I'm a musician.

119
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,600
I'm a good,

120
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,690
we will let you inform.

121
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,150
I went on a tourist visa and
if you claim any of that,

122
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,970
you're going to get tons of scrutiny
and they're not going to let you in.

123
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,770
They won't let you in if you're an artist.

124
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,551
Absolutely.

125
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:25,384
Absolutely not,

126
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,321
because they're just,

127
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:26,951
they fear it.

128
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:27,461
They fear what?

129
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:30,700
You'll go back to the mainland with
something in the wrong because you're a

130
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:31,511
public person,

131
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:31,920
they don't want it.

132
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,070
But they absolutely let,

133
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:33,490
uh,

134
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,271
the basketball player,

135
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:38,950
what the fuck is he towed the
party line and just told Obama,

136
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:39,220
you know,

137
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,870
just just call your pal Kim.

138
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:41,261
Sure.

139
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:41,861
That'll work out.

140
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:42,610
Great.

141
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,151
And same thing.

142
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:43,690
When I was in,

143
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:43,871
uh,

144
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:44,231
I was,

145
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:49,231
I went to Tehran via Dubai and the guy
who met me at the airport after the

146
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:50,591
airport,

147
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:51,880
people got done grilling me.

148
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,481
Uh,

149
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:52,811
he said,

150
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:52,931
look,

151
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:53,770
I got your visa,

152
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,420
I know who you are.

153
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,860
I'm not your tour guide.

154
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,970
He's a government guy.

155
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,400
Don't tell him what you do for a living,

156
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,810
will never get you outta here.

157
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,640
So the last year is Christ.

158
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,060
Yeah.

159
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,530
The last time in that country,

160
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,740
I'm eating dinner with this
guy and his amazing wife,

161
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:12,220
they're both like rocket scientists and
the email they get by with a website

162
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:13,210
that gets thesis done.

163
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,950
So his cousin,

164
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,910
her cousin,

165
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,630
a new show,

166
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,440
the woman,

167
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,870
her cousin calls her and says,

168
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,820
your friend Henry's on TV.

169
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,920
And uh,

170
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,920
Achmed dropped his fork and said,

171
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:27,820
we've got to go.

172
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,250
We have to get you to your,

173
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,011
your hotel.

174
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:32,680
You got to pack up right now
we just go to the airport,

175
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,340
check in,

176
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,173
check your luggage,

177
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,380
find a corner,

178
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,630
put your face in it and
wait for the flight.

179
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,493
And I got to the,

180
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,770
I got to the airport like four hours
early because you said you just,

181
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
you got to go.

182
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,750
Whoa.

183
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,860
And so I just sat there in the airport
with my face down and then eventually got

184
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:48,161
on like,

185
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:48,371
you know,

186
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:48,601
the,

187
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:50,890
the 3:00 AM to Dubai
and I was out of there.

188
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,880
Holy Shit.

189
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,803
Yeah.

190
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,390
What would have happened if
you get caught questions,

191
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,030
which leads to more questions
and you just don't know.

192
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,080
It turns into like,

193
00:04:59,081 --> 00:04:59,890
well,

194
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,280
he's been interrogated for the last
three months and we don't know.

195
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,990
And since I'm not a hot looking girl,

196
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,710
uh,

197
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,660
President Clinton's not
coming to rescue me.

198
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,400
And,

199
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,400
and so those are the two countries I've
been to where don't tell them what you

200
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:15,340
do with what I was
instructed before I left.

201
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,390
Wow.

202
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,223
Yeah.

203
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,290
Okay.
