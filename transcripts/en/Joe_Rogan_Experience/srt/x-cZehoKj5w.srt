1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,523
Okay.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,713
Everybody,

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,920
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by legal

4
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:14,754
zoom.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Legal Zoom is a way that you can do things
affordably and easily online that you

6
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:28,210
would normally have to go
visit a legal office to do a,

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,400
you can do things like starting an LLC
online in the comfort of your own home

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,170
for just hundred bucks,

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,030
$99 actually you can incorporate
for $99 you heard me,

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,070
you can protect your family with a last
will for just $69 get a living trust,

11
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:47,310
power of attorney and
more legal zoom guests.

12
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:47,791
The job,

13
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:48,091
right?

14
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:51,720
Nine out of 10 customers would recommend
the service to their friends and

15
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:52,554
family,

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,330
which as we've covered before,

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,560
it means a lot because we all know
that one out of 10 people is absolutely

18
00:00:58,561 --> 00:00:59,340
useless.

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,580
So if that one out of 10 people is
having a hard time with legal zoom,

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,070
it's most likely a very good service.

21
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,420
Another indication,

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,930
it's a very good service is the fact
that it got an a plus from the better

23
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:10,800
business bureau.

24
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,203
A plus,

25
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,260
not an a minus,

26
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,470
not a B plus fucking eight plus pitches.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,110
They can help you out with trademarks,

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,033
copyrights,

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,933
patents.

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,740
If you've got a great idea
and you want to protect it,

31
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,600
legal zoom is there for you.

32
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:25,980
In the past 12 years,

33
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,170
over 2 million Americans have used
legal zoom and they have saved a ton of

34
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:31,860
money.

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,030
They're online process could not be
easier and they'll take care of you from

36
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:37,170
start to finish.

37
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,350
They will also connect you with a
third party attorney if you panic.

38
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,070
If you're freaking out and you're like,

39
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,761
oh my God,

40
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:45,594
I'm going to jail.

41
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,620
No legal zoom.

42
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,221
Oh,

43
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:52,221
make sure they can connect you with an
independent third party attorney and they

44
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:57,651
can provide you with the
self help services that you

We are also brought to

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,130
N.

51

N.

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:17,761
I.

53

T.

54
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,820
One of the new things that we've added
to on it that's really pretty cool and

55
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:25,821
fascinating is we have
a gang of motivational,

56
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,190
a gang of instructional videos of,

57
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:33,240
of blogs,

58
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:33,900
entries,

59
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,190
things that you can show,

60
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,780
um,

61
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,200
you know,

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,530
it seems that you can look at rather
to get you fired up for training,

63
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:43,800
things that could put you in the right
mindset and things that will show you the

64
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:44,700
correct form,

65
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,500
the correct a way to do certain exercises
and just demonstrate what on and is

66
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:50,334
all about.

67
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,290
It's the Onnit academy and a,

68
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:57,291
it's one of the links@onat.com on
it is a human optimization website.

69
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,530
Uh,

70
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,720
Aubrey started this website arbors here,

71
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:02,500
by the way.

72
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,660
Well,

73
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,160
it's talking about him like you didn't
even hear you started this website.

74
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,043
Um,

75
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,360
with this idea and this mindset of
creating something that we would wish was

76
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,414
there for us.

77
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,110
Um,

78
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,510
selling things that we would use,

79
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,190
selling things that we do use in stuff
that we used long before we ever became

80
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:22,150
involved in the company.

81
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:22,960
Uh,

82
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,300
things like strength and
conditioning equipment,

83
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,370
like the best kettlebells we can find,

84
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:28,810
the best battle ropes,

85
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:32,800
we can find the best
steel maces steel clubs,

86
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:33,640
weight vests,

87
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,481
ab wheels,

88
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,690
all great equipment for
functional strength.

89
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,070
And then on top of that,

90
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,780
the best supplements we can find,

91
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,500
the best new nootropics for Alpha brain,

92
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,980
the best protein powder and hemp protein,

93
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,210
hemp force protein powder,

94
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,900
which we still as of right now
still have to buy from Canada.

95
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:54,140
But we are hoping that a,

96
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,160
these laws are changing and it seems
to be they're changing pretty quickly.

97
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,820
It seems like the House of cards is
falling down on the whole cannabis.

98
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,600
Uh,

99
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,051
this,

100
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:07,051
this whole embargo that is been in place
in this country for almost a hundred

101
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,181
years.

102
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:09,040
It's pretty incredible
that it lasted that long.

103
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,450
And he's had about somewhere in the 85
year range from the time it was made

104
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:14,284
illegal.

105
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,711
But,

106
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:15,070
uh,

107
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,690
it's slowly starting to go away.

108
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:17,860
And when it does go away,

109
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,440
hopefully before it goes away,

110
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:23,800
even we'll be able to buy our
hemp from America right now.

111
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:25,570
We have to buy it from Canada.

112
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,550
It's the most ridiculous thing ever.

113
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,790
You can grow it in Canada and sell it in
Canada and you can buy it and bring it

114
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:34,150
back to America,

115
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:36,100
but you cannot grow it in America.

116
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,230
It's so fucking dumb.

117
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,320
It's like if you had a cousin that
was a criminal and because of it,

118
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:42,190
you weren't allowed to vote.

119
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,290
It's that dumb really is,

120
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:44,561
right.

121
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:45,730
I mean that's like a good analogy.

122
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,163
Um,

123
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,490
but the,

124
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:49,151
on an academy,

125
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:50,020
it's really fascinating.

126
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,170
There's so much cool shit there from a,

127
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,830
there's videos with me working out with
Aubrey and we're demonstrating different

128
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,750
exercises and techniques.

129
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,973
Um,

130
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,980
there's just a slew of cool shit at the
a on an academy and we're continuing to

131
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,930
add to it all the time on.

132
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:08,920
It is continuing to grow.

133
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:10,570
When we find cool shit we added,

134
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,610
whether it's the new warrior protein bar,

135
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:14,350
which is absolutely fantastic.

136
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:19,351
It's a new buffalo bar that is 14
grams of protein in each serving.

137
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,260
Um,

138
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,260
and it's all made in the same method as
the native Americans used to preserve a,

139
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,450
their buffalo four grams
of fat per serving,

140
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:29,950
only 140 calories.

141
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,920
And it's super delicious as well.

142
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:33,970
No antibiotics,

143
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:34,930
no added hormones,

144
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:39,931
all natural and made from prairie fed
buffalo cranberries and a spicy pepper

145
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:41,944
blend.

146
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,020
That stuff is awesome.

147
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,183
It's really good.

148
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,600
It's so good because you're
eating it and it's like,

149
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,260
you know,

150
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,520
you don't have any guilt,

151
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,480
completely guilt free
as you're reading it,

152
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:51,010
you're like,

153
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,320
this tastes good and it's not a candy bar.

154
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,250
Yeah.

155
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:54,910
Lakota,

156
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,900
Lakota recipe,

157
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:56,711
Lakota tribe.

158
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:58,040
It's still making it up there in

159
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,180
the Dakotas and it's just carrying
on an old tradition with new fancier

160
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:02,691
packaging.

161
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,400
Then allows it to stay fresh for longer.

162
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,300
That's about it.

163
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,133
So go to Onondaga,

164
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,320
come and check out all
the cool shit we have.

165
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:08,831
Like I said,

166
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:09,790
we have the,

167
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,530
whenever we find if it's good,

168
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,820
we even sell blenders.

169
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:13,660
Why do we sell blenders?

170
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,640
Because we use them.

171
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,301
You know when,

172
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:17,500
if you're making protein drinks,

173
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:18,760
if you're making Kale shakes,

174
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:19,930
if you're making things along those lines,

175
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:20,991
you need a blender.

176
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:21,821
And while we said,

177
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:21,950
oh,

178
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,421
what's [inaudible] on,

179
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:25,600
what's the best blender and
the best blender turns out
to be a BLENDTEC blender.

180
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,040
It's pretty fucking bad ass.

181
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:27,761
It really is.

182
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:28,594
The best blender.

183
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,201
All right,

184
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:29,981
let's start selling it.

185
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:30,281
I mean,

186
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:31,900
that's the attitude that oneand has.

187
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:32,020
Yeah.

188
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,360
And that's the attitude we're
going to continue to have.

189
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:34,780
Uh,

190
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,190
we also carry a organic coconut oil,

191
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,380
Stevia Himalayan salt.

192
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,720
We just a ton of shit,

193
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:45,250
too much to list and one commercial,

194
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,180
but go to on it.

195
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,090
Oh and nit,

196
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,040
um,

197
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,610
get your freak on and use the codeword
Rogan save 10% off any and all

198
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,150
supplements.

199
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,900
All right.

200
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,410
Aubrey Marcus is back from Peru.

201
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,680
He was riding the wizards tail
and he's got stories for us.

202
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,680
Here we go.

203
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,513
Hit it.

204
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,680
The Joe Rogan experience.

205
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,050
Joe Rogan podcast,

206
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:11,480
my night all day

207
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,681
at all.

208
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:18,820
My friends that have done drugs

209
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,170
and I'm almost all of them.

210
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:22,220
Have your,

211
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:22,431
a,

212
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:27,431
the most dedicated at these return
visits to exotic locations for a mind,

213
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:30,290
expanding horizon,

214
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,180
expanding experiences.

215
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,463
And uh,

216
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,323
you're back again.

217
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,450
I'm back.

218
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:35,771
Do you,

219
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:36,620
you plan these out?

220
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:37,454
How far in it?

221
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:38,780
Yeah,

222
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,330
this one sometimes it's a long time.

223
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:42,860
Sometimes something just comes up.

224
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,050
And this time was one of those times,

225
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,830
a mutual acquaintance who I met
through actually the Boga world.

226
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,130
He had gone down here and done
this watch human experience,

227
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,450
which is the original way that you
described San Pedro before it got

228
00:07:56,451 --> 00:08:01,220
Catholicized from the missionaries who
came in and freaked out that the native

229
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:04,490
people were doing these ceremonies
with this San Pedro Cactus,

230
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:05,324
which is what we call,

231
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,610
but it originally comes from this 4,000
year old recipe from the shoving people,

232
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,550
which was like the peak of
pre Andean consciousness.

233
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,410
And so I heard about these ceremonies
going on and I hadn't had any experience

234
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,300
with that medicine and I was like,

235
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:20,931
fuck it,

236
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:21,440
I'm in,

237
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:21,681
you know,

238
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:22,910
I got to explore this,

239
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:23,750
see what this looks like,

240
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:26,300
see what this unique tool is good for.

241
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,990
So San Pedro is pot,

242
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,220
pot is masculine,

243
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,690
peyote is a different cactus.

244
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,170
Really?

245
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:33,411
Yeah.

246
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:34,940
So peyote is a different cactus.

247
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,540
Um,

248
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,000
similarly related in mechanism of action,

249
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,000
but it's a little bit sterner.

250
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,050
It's a little bit harsher.

251
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:43,130
They described the difference,

252
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:43,581
you know,

253
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:44,990
if one's going to whack you on the head.

254
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:45,321
Peyote,

255
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:49,790
he's more of a hammer and San
Pedro is more of a heavy feather.

256
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,510
Yeah,

257
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,020
exactly.

258
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,853
I have Wifi,

259
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,750
but uh,

260
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,660
but if it can be pretty intense
work too is I'll describe but um,

261
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,651
yeah,

262
00:08:58,651 --> 00:08:59,431
it's slightly different.

263
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:00,840
Cactuses and uh,

264
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,470
obviously the Payoti came up through
the North American tradition more

265
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,510
frequently and then the San Pedro,

266
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:09,600
why Chuma was carried on through
the South American tradition.

267
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:10,910
Wow.

268
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,391
So,

269
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:12,020
um,

270
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,240
this place that you're going to in Peru,

271
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:14,810
um,

272
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,411
is this,

273
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:15,710
uh,

274
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,700
like a center?

275
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:18,210
Is this an organized yup.

276
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,420
Regular place that people go to?

277
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,860
I didn't know that there was these,

278
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,300
there's these places online that are
like Yelp for Iowasca retreats and they

279
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,560
rate them with stars.

280
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,280
I mean,

281
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,300
it's so bizarre.

282
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,130
Someone sent me a tweet saying,

283
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,910
you know,

284
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,150
uh,

285
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,020
something about,

286
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:33,230
uh,

287
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,750
because of your spreading the word,

288
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:36,140
you know,

289
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,820
look at all these different
things that are out there.

290
00:09:37,821 --> 00:09:38,690
So I click on the link,

291
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:38,931
I'm like,

292
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:39,171
all right,

293
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:40,004
what does this,

294
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:45,070
and it's like fucking 50 different IOWASCA
retreats that all have websites and

295
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:48,860
they're all yelped and reviewed five star,

296
00:09:48,861 --> 00:09:49,491
four star.

297
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:50,540
It's fucking crazy.

298
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,530
Gotta be can you,

299
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,240
you need these kind of review systems,

300
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:57,200
especially if they're of an integrity
because this is pretty powerful medicine.

301
00:09:57,201 --> 00:10:00,380
You're dealing with internal
processes that are very intense.

302
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:05,030
IOWASCA loan is a very powerful Maoi
which can interact with a lot of things

303
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,081
with your health,

304
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:08,030
but it's also dealing with you know,

305
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:10,850
very deep spiritual issues,

306
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,140
traumas that you may have,

307
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:12,974
things like that.

308
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,230
So getting a really good showman,

309
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:17,270
a real master is so key.

310
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:19,490
So having good review systems and,

311
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,000
and really even better is knowing
people that have been there,

312
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,540
talking to people from experience and
finding them that way because there's,

313
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,810
they're popping up just to make money and
just because you're a showman and just

314
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:32,930
cause you have Iowasca it doesn't
mean you have any integrity at all.

315
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,530
Yeah.

316
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,720
Caroline was telling us about a
shaman that was feeling her up.

317
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,633
Yup.

318
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,150
Yup.

319
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,160
Then there's all kinds of crazy stories
like that and being schamens just charge

320
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:41,531
the money,

321
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:42,364
give you the brew,

322
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,900
which is a brew.

323
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:46,060
Maybe they didn't even make it themselves,

324
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,230
they just bought it in a market.

325
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,400
Maybe they put a bunch of [inaudible],

326
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,130
which is detouring in there.

327
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:56,230
And so you're getting more of like that
Batman one hallucination instead of the,

328
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,960
instead of like a really
powerful DMT experience.

329
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,220
There's a lot of things that are,

330
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:02,590
that are going on there
that are not great.

331
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,740
But if you get to a real ios Guerro and
a real center with really good medicine,

332
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,960
obviously as I've described
in previous journeys,

333
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,070
it can be incredibly powerful.

334
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,400
So this is your newest,

335
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:14,060
your latest,

336
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,380
you're just back from it.

337
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,740
Yeah.

338
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,960
You just return how long ago or a week?

339
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,650
A week ago.

340
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,220
Yeah.

341
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,210
How fucked up?

342
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:21,044
Where are you

343
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,930
as as fucked up in the most
beautiful way possible.

344
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,261
I mean,

345
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:25,891
this to me,

346
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:26,610
this was,

347
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,570
this was the one,

348
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,321
this is the one,

349
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,041
this was the one.

350
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:33,180
This was the single greatest thing
for me that I've done and I've done,

351
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:33,421
you know,

352
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:34,530
I've told all these stories,

353
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:35,281
the Iowasca,

354
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:40,020
the Boga riding the back of a drag and
seeing the flotillas of snakes popping

355
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:41,250
into the eighth dimension,

356
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:41,941
doing,

357
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:42,660
you know,

358
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,990
exploring this advent calendar
of past souls on a book.

359
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:47,370
All of these crazy stories.

360
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,620
Nothing was as dramatically,

361
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:52,800
positively impactful as
this experience down there.

362
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,070
And it was a combination,

363
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:57,880
not only of the medicine but
of the integrity of the place.

364
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,520
And of course being held by Gandalf,

365
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:01,720
the white wizard himself,

366
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,060
which was something I was surprised at.

367
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:04,271
You know,

368
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:05,110
I expected him,

369
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,060
I didn't have any expectations really.

370
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,590
And I was really just blown away.

371
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,060
By what,

372
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,180
what do you mean by Gandalf?

373
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:11,110
The white wizard himself?

374
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:12,490
Like you actually met Gandalf,

375
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,380
if there was a Gandalf,

376
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,350
like that myth I hung out with
for eight days and he's my,

377
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,243
he's my homeboy.

378
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,263
So,

379
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,510
so is this something that I'm not,

380
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:24,610
I'm not sure if you're joking around like,

381
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,310
like did you actually have hallucinations
that you were hanging out with

382
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:27,910
Gandalf?

383
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,300
No,

384
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,481
no,

385
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,550
just describing that kind of benevolent,

386
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:31,181
friendly,

387
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:36,160
slightly humorous archetype of someone
who has access to great power but can

388
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:37,150
just sit around and,

389
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:37,661
and,

390
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:38,130
uh,

391
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,380
you know,

392
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,220
smoke a pipe with you and tell
stories or when he's timed for work,

393
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:42,731
you know,

394
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:46,150
he can step up and do some
pretty amazing things.

395
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,640
It's all kind of probably get
through and into this story,

396
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:54,030
but I'm just really follows that archetype
to at t obviously no direct links to

397
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,110
the Gandel.

398
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:01,110
So explain like you take this
stuff and when you take it,

399
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,450
what is a like how long does
it take before it kicks in?

400
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:04,750
Sure.

401
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,430
And what is it similar to?

402
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,720
Yeah,

403
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,553
I'll tell the,

404
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,060
I'll tell the whole story in
succession here and we'll get to it.

405
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,341
And you know,

406
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:16,090
the first part of any of these medicine
journeys is you set your intent to do it

407
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,950
and then once that happens,

408
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,300
the process already begins.

409
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:21,970
You can talk to a lot of the
different teachers about this.

410
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:24,370
As soon as you set your intent
to do some of this work,

411
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,280
some stuff starts to
come up and there'll be,

412
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,000
you know,

413
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,420
some of your dark material that'll start
to come up as if it's almost getting

414
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:32,320
ready to surface.

415
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:35,410
And then there'll be a
serious amount of resistance.

416
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,970
Like what Steven Pressfield says,

417
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:39,280
when you go from something,

418
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,293
you know,

419
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,460
something lower to a higher place,

420
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,840
there's going to be intense resistance.

421
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,190
And for me it was the fact that I was
going down to the lower Amazon in rainy

422
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:48,850
season,

423
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,360
which means there's going to be fucking
mosquitoes everywhere and I hate

424
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:55,720
mosquitoes and I'm a bit paranoid
about things like malaria.

425
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,680
So it freaked me out and I almost
canceled like at the last minute.

426
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,750
But ultimately looking back,

427
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,220
you see that that was like,

428
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,570
that was my resistance.

429
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:04,781
Yeah,

430
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:05,614
exactly.

431
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,090
And that's going to come up for everybody.

432
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:09,640
Anybody listening who sets
their intent to do this,

433
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,490
you're going to find at the 11th
hour some serious resistance,

434
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:13,091
some fears,

435
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:15,400
some material that's going to
come up that's going to tell you,

436
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:15,590
no,

437
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,423
don't do this shit.

438
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,620
But that's normal.

439
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:17,951
You know,

440
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:19,270
and you can heat it or not.

441
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,481
You know,

442
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:20,740
life is a series of choices,

443
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:23,050
but expect resistance to come for that.

444
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,580
So that's what came to me and I got down
there and I'd been going through some,

445
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,390
some personal stuff my first time.

446
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,360
I'm single and alone in 13 years.

447
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:32,640
I just put up with my partner.

448
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,720
She's great but went that way.

449
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,970
I had some other lot
of stress and you know,

450
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:38,080
we've been pushing pretty hard.

451
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,540
So when I got there into,

452
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,403
into Peru,

453
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,200
I was seriously ready for something,

454
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,531
you know,

455
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:45,310
and I didn't know what,

456
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,160
I didn't really do that much
research on the watchu honestly.

457
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,170
Usually I like really read trip reports.

458
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:53,960
I go to place like Erowid and I look and
I read and I didn't really know shit.

459
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,030
I just knew I was going
down there and I was like,

460
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:58,820
whatever something good is
hopefully going to happen.

461
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,350
But I was still,

462
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:00,621
you know,

463
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:01,221
I arrived there.

464
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:01,670
So you,

465
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,503
you get into,

466
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,321
go into Lima.

467
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:04,370
I spent the night in Lima,

468
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,151
take the,

469
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:05,360
uh,

470
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,620
take the flight into a kidos and it Ketos
is one of the largest cities that has

471
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:10,550
no roads to it,

472
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,180
the only way to get to a
ketosis by plane or by boat.

473
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,010
So it's kind of an interesting place.

474
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:19,850
But like many of these 500,000 Whoa,

475
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,010
500,000 people and there's no
roads and it's like a jungle town.

476
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:25,161
You know,

477
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:26,930
there's a lot of what you
would call in Thailand.

478
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:27,231
You call him,

479
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,740
took Tux.

480
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:27,981
You know,

481
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:29,340
those little bikes that have a,

482
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,641
I don't know,

483
00:15:29,641 --> 00:15:33,860
a big backseat motorized bikes
and just kind of a sprawling,

484
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,320
really dirty,

485
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,700
stinky place,

486
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:38,240
you know.

487
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,260
So you cruise through,

488
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:43,700
you cruise through that place and then
we met up with Don Howard who runs the

489
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:44,301
center down there,

490
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:46,400
the spirit quest center and he's got the,

491
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,680
the long white hair and
a big friendly smile.

492
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,570
So as soon as I saw him I was like okay.

493
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,440
American.

494
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:51,770
Yeah,

495
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,011
he's,

496
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:53,910
so he's Kentucky born uh,

497
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,580
the grandson of a root doctor,

498
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,761
uh,

499
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:56,690
Kentucky root doctor,

500
00:15:56,691 --> 00:16:01,340
which is like an old natural medicine
doctor and a half native American as well.

501
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,410
So his journey just to,

502
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:05,110
just to talk briefly about it.

503
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:08,540
So I learned kind of on the boat ride
cause we hop in a boat to go to the center

504
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,900
because his centers on 200 acres in
the jungle that he's been preserving.

505
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,910
So his journey at 19,

506
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:18,500
he got called to start working with
Payoti and went and did the kind of

507
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:20,990
traditional native American
as with his ancestry,

508
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,040
that kind of path to do pod
ceremonies for about 20 years,

509
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,390
both with himself.

510
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,610
And with leading other people.

511
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,750
And then he got called to go down to
South America and start working with the

512
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:33,710
San Pedro Cactus,

513
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:34,544
the watch Houma,

514
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,130
and got kind of initiated
into the [inaudible],

515
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,570
which is a c h,

516
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:38,751
a,

517
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:38,991
v.

518
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:39,824
I n.

519
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,450
And understood,

520
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:41,751
you know,

521
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,980
kind of the old recipes,

522
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:44,930
the old ways that they
used to make the medicine.

523
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,700
And not only with the watch Houma,

524
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:47,534
but the Vielka,

525
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,880
which is the second medicine that we did.

526
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,360
And the [inaudible] is the most potent
DMT experience on the fucking planet.

527
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,750
Like nothing else.

528
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,120
I'd have done many of the other ways,

529
00:16:59,520 --> 00:16:59,810
uh,

530
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,860
can come close to that.

531
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,890
It's a combination of nn DMT five Meo
DMT and before Deneen and you snuff it

532
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,161
through your notes,

533
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,140
but I'll go through that story.

534
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:11,780
That was kind of the grand fucking
finale of this whole thing.

535
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,560
And it,

536
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,560
it launches you so much farther than
even Iowasca or anything else that I've

537
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:18,590
done.

538
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:22,100
So he got called to start working with
those medicines along with Iowasca down

539
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:24,620
in the jungle and had been
doing that for 30 years.

540
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,730
So He'd had 50 years of experience
working with these plant medicines.

541
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,020
And as you can imagine,

542
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:31,430
that's a long time to,

543
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,031
you know,

544
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,220
to be on the path and just be following.

545
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,750
I'm trying to heal as many people as
possible and show him to show him the

546
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:39,584
medicine.

547
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,910
So awesome guy and someone that
usually with these Shamans,

548
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,960
they don't speak English,

549
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:49,040
so you kind of get a vibe from him and
then you do the medicine and it's all

550
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,790
kind of magic with him,

551
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,420
you know,

552
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,640
not only is he leading
the ceremony in that way,

553
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,950
you can just sit around
and bullshit with them,

554
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:56,281
you know,

555
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:57,390
talk to them about,

556
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:57,931
you know,

557
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:01,890
crazy females that he tried to
take him to the dark side and,

558
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,590
and all kinds of these stories
that you would find from a,

559
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,131
from a guy,

560
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:09,240
like if you're hanging out with Gandalf
and the fucking Shyer and eating supper

561
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:10,380
and smoking is,

562
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:10,591
you know,

563
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:14,430
crazy dragon pipe like it had that
kind of feel to it when you get there.

564
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,991
So I get in,

565
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:18,540
I get into the jungle and
it's a really beautiful place.

566
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,400
Like the ceremonial hut has,

567
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,440
has iowasca vines that are growing along
the hut and in circling the whole hut,

568
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,390
which is pretty amazing to see.

569
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,760
And then everything is all screened in.

570
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:31,560
It's like kind of like a nice rustic wood.

571
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:31,951
As I said,

572
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:35,730
it's on 200 acres so we go into this
screen in place but I'm still extra

573
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:36,211
paranoid.

574
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:40,020
So I set up my mosquito net and I'm
like completely doused in bug spray,

575
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:43,710
like just wet with bugs strikes
and I'm still super paranoid.

576
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,770
And so we get in there and you know,

577
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:48,630
ended up talking and go
through the initiation,

578
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,000
get to a pretty good degree of comfort
and we're going to do the medicine the

579
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:51,834
next day.

580
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,060
And that night I was just,

581
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,350
I couldn't sleep at all.

582
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:59,040
I was exhausted but I still couldn't
sleep cause I was just so concerned about

583
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,690
like a lot of stuff was coming up for me,

584
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,220
a lot of emotions and stuff.

585
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,930
And when worry about this,

586
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:05,490
these bugs in this malaria thing,

587
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,350
which was made worse by,

588
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,213
of course,

589
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,690
another kind of test that came up,

590
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:10,740
somebody who was there said,

591
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,071
oh,

592
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:14,130
did you hear about those two cases of
malaria that just showed up recently?

593
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,000
I was like,

594
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,470
why you gotta fucking tell me that?

595
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,320
All the things you
volunteer that information.

596
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,790
But of course that's,

597
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,061
you know,

598
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:21,781
that's what came up.

599
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:25,530
So that was an opportunity
for me to really work on
these fears and paranoia is,

600
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,011
which for me,

601
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:27,840
my greatest fear is
that fear of suffering.

602
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:30,110
Some fear of some illness that,

603
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:31,800
that I wouldn't be able to beat,

604
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:32,011
you know,

605
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:34,260
death I'd seen in my other experiences,

606
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:36,270
what the other side kind of felt like.

607
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:36,780
And I was like,

608
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,770
well that would suck.

609
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:38,680
I don't want to die.

610
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:39,000
Uh,

611
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,920
obviously have a lot of
stuff to do and I love life.

612
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:42,870
Life's amazing stuff to do.

613
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,290
But the fear of suffering,

614
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,400
I'd never really kicked that,

615
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,241
picked that fear.

616
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:51,390
So I was just sitting there and
finally like four in the morning,

617
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,590
the jungles just loud,

618
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,401
loud as shit.

619
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:53,671
Anyway,

620
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:54,490
just the CICADAS,

621
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,820
rare air here and you know,

622
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,690
birds and these um,

623
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,980
crazy other jungle and sit her in the
trees making honking noises and all kinds

624
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:04,830
of stuff.

625
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,670
I mean really,

626
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,331
really loud.

627
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:06,541
I think.

628
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,030
I know you like the hot that you're in.

629
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,740
Does it have open window?

630
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,300
So it's all just screened in windows so
it's wide open to the jungle and we're

631
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:16,440
just nestled in the jungle.

632
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:18,750
So like when you go to the
bathroom and you turn the light on,

633
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:23,280
you find giant fucking things crawling
on the windows and stuff on the outside

634
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:23,611
part,

635
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:26,730
hopefully inside the car because
they haven't got through the screens.

636
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:27,001
But yeah,

637
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:29,130
anything attracted to the light will be,

638
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:29,710
you know,

639
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,070
kind of stuck to the
screen door looking at gas,

640
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,290
fucking dog size bugs,

641
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,310
right?

642
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:35,820
Yeah,

643
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,140
you're in,

644
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,070
you're in the jungle and there's,

645
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,031
everything was nice.

646
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:39,780
No hot water,

647
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,740
no showers in the room,

648
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,431
but you know,

649
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:42,171
everything else was,

650
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:42,781
was pretty nice.

651
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:42,961
No,

652
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:44,490
obviously air or heat or anything.

653
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,661
So anyways,

654
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,210
four in the morning I'm draped and
this mosquito net and I finally,

655
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,183
you know,

656
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,120
finally like I get this idea in my head
and the phrase trust the mud comes into

657
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:55,570
my head.

658
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,830
It's just like just trust the mud.

659
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,580
And with that final thought I was
able to finally get some sleep.

660
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,200
Trust them,

661
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,033
trust the mud.

662
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:03,330
Yeah.

663
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:07,330
And I guess to me that was just a metaphor
of the mud being the jungle itself,

664
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,780
you know,

665
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,270
and the mud being what's me,

666
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,320
you know what's inside me,

667
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,580
this flash,

668
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:13,301
this life,

669
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:14,860
this everything,

670
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:15,910
all being connected.

671
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:16,900
Just just trust it.

672
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,210
Trust the month that it's
not going to fuck me up.

673
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,750
Trusted some mosquitoes not going to
come in or some millipedes not going to

674
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:25,990
crawl up my butthole and sting me
and I'm never going to shit again.

675
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,490
Whatever other fears that I had.

676
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,660
And you hear these stories too,

677
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:30,220
but like don't pee in the water.

678
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:31,150
Cause then this,

679
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:36,070
this fish will crawl up your urethra and
spread it spines and explode your Dick.

680
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,910
It does happen.

681
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,590
It does.

682
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:37,710
No,

683
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,440
it does happen.

684
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,790
So you have all of these crazy,

685
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,760
scary stuff that you hear
about this and that can,

686
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,320
you can really freak
yourself out doing that.

687
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:45,280
But again,

688
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:45,911
so finally,

689
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:47,710
four in the morning so they trust the mud.

690
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:48,130
Fuck it.

691
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:48,670
I'm going to,

692
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,503
I'm going to go,

693
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,090
go through with this next day,

694
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,470
wake up feeling a little better.

695
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:54,430
But I feel like like a,

696
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,330
like a sick person,

697
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:57,430
you know when you go to the doctor and
you're super healthy and you're gonna get

698
00:21:57,431 --> 00:21:58,240
your blood drawn,

699
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,170
you get that kind of anticipation
before the prick of the needle prick.

700
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:02,410
It's like,

701
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:02,741
ah,

702
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:03,880
it's good for me.

703
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:04,450
I was like,

704
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,920
I just fucking need this so bad.

705
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:09,700
Like I wasn't even nervous before doing
this new completely new psychedelic,

706
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,230
which is crazy unusual.

707
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:11,741
Anytime,

708
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:14,050
even if I take like a
small dose of mushrooms,

709
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:15,640
you get those butterflies in your stomach.

710
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,090
Like,

711
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,870
Oh shit,

712
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,703
I'm about to jump.

713
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,030
I didn't even have that.

714
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:21,610
I just felt like a sick person
going to get some medicine.

715
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,420
So we get in there to the ceremonial
hut and laid out is what's called the

716
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:26,254
Masada.

717
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,380
And that's a key part of the watch Houma
ceremony is this kind of May said that

718
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:35,830
they set up and on it is these six goals,

719
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,300
three female shamans,

720
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:38,950
three male Schamens.

721
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,580
Um,

722
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:39,880
they're,

723
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,580
they're actual human skulls and set up.

724
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:46,120
And then there's Jaguar skulls and then
there's artifacts spanning all the way

725
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:46,980
back to [inaudible],

726
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,430
which is 4,000 years old.

727
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,350
There's a piece of the moon,

728
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,490
it's on this altar.

729
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,630
There's going to be each of the moon.

730
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,760
In doing the medicine,

731
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:56,680
you interact with a lot of,

732
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,640
a lot of people who've done and
collected a variety of things.

733
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:05,380
And one of the things after you're done
is you feel compelled to give something

734
00:23:05,381 --> 00:23:07,810
back to what you've researched
for what you've received.

735
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,711
So a lot of these,

736
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:13,230
most of these are just gifts that have
been accumulated over 50 years of of

737
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,541
work.

738
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,940
I don't know exactly where
that piece came from,

739
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,130
but somebody had that given to them,

740
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:18,461
whatever.

741
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:19,294
And then they say,

742
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,720
Holy Shit changed my life and here's
this fucking piece of the moon.

743
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,520
Maybe it wasn't a piece of the moon,

744
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:26,320
but it was given as a piece of the moon,

745
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,140
which is just basically the same.

746
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:28,880
Yeah,

747
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,713
I say,

748
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,180
who knows?

749
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,990
But anyways,

750
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,400
lot,

751
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,490
I mean the skulls were real.

752
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:34,450
The Jaguar skulls,

753
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:35,111
the all this.

754
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:38,860
And then they have a big centerpiece in
altar called the [inaudible] and that's

755
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:41,560
like an ancient kind of shoving,

756
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,190
um,

757
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,030
central pillar,

758
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:47,180
which acts is like the center of
this altar called the Axis Mundey,

759
00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:47,780
which,

760
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,111
you know,

761
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:48,861
transforms,

762
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:53,380
kind of into ceremonially into like the
center of the center of the universe is

763
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,290
what that's supposed to be.

764
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,600
So we're sitting there and he's,

765
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,434
um,

766
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,720
he starts going around in the medicine,

767
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:01,250
the San Pedro as the liquid medicine.

768
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,750
I didn't even know if it was liquid,

769
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:03,584
if I was going to chew it.

770
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,110
I had really had no fucking
idea what was going on.

771
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,570
I knew that it acts
that it operated on the,

772
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:09,404
um,

773
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,400
on the,

774
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,090
you know,

775
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,390
same serotonin receptors that mushrooms
and some of these other things.

776
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,380
Um,

777
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:15,981
five ht,

778
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:19,430
two a serotonin receptors that kind of
knew a little bit of the mechanism of

779
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:19,731
action,

780
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:22,160
but I didn't really know
anything other than that.

781
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,970
And he starts going around
the room and he's got,

782
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:25,160
you know,

783
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,240
kind of a warm smile.

784
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:27,890
He's cause cracking a few jokes.

785
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,180
And to me that's the best sign of any
good showman is that he's willing to like

786
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,310
crack a few jokes and stay relaxed.

787
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:37,670
Like the ones that are shady and the
ones that are weird are the ones that are

788
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:42,671
like being Sharman like watch me
play Shawman everybody be silent.

789
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,950
Like a yoga teacher that
insists on chanting.

790
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:46,281
Yeah,

791
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:47,000
exactly.

792
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,840
It was really goofy.

793
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:48,440
Exactly.

794
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,420
Like the ones that are really
comfortable in the medicine,

795
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,740
this is just what they fucking do.

796
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,011
You know,

797
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:52,880
they can crack a joke.

798
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:54,020
It's not gonna affect anything.

799
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,930
It's not going to make you think less
of them or them do the work any less and

800
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,360
it's not going to stop the drug and it's
not going to stop the dragon not going

801
00:25:01,361 --> 00:25:02,194
to stop Gandalf.

802
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,321
So anyways,

803
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:05,060
so he opens up these things.

804
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,520
It's actually covered in the
skins of the San Pedro Cactus,

805
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:08,390
these little vessels.

806
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:13,130
And he starts looking around the
room and he'll look at you and,

807
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:13,490
uh,

808
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,890
look at you for like
five seconds and then,

809
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:16,491
you know,

810
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:17,324
kind of get a,

811
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,330
get a read on you and then pour
a certain amount into a cup.

812
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,861
So I was seeing,

813
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:22,820
and he's pouring little,

814
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,170
little bits in the cockpit.

815
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:24,681
And for me,

816
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:25,940
I wanted a project,

817
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:26,241
you know,

818
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:28,520
like give me the fucking mother dose,

819
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:30,620
but I decided I was just going
to trust what he's going to do.

820
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,090
So eventually,

821
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:32,451
you know,

822
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:35,510
I watch everybody drank and it looks
like they're drinking maybe two ounces

823
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:36,470
based on what he's pouring.

824
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,400
And he gets to me and I
just bust out a huge smile,

825
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:40,770
you know,

826
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,211
it's not like,

827
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:41,600
all right,

828
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,050
let's,

829
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:42,651
let's do this.

830
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:43,011
I was like,

831
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:43,844
really?

832
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:44,540
I Dunno.

833
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,940
At that moment I was just
really looking forward to it.

834
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,950
And he got a big smile
and he pours me up just a,

835
00:25:49,951 --> 00:25:50,960
a full Mug,

836
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,890
not quite full,

837
00:25:51,891 --> 00:25:54,230
but at least six ounces of this liquid.

838
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,090
And I didn't know what it tasted like.

839
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:56,990
So I had nothing to do.

840
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,910
So you get up to the altar,

841
00:25:58,970 --> 00:25:59,661
he blows a little,

842
00:25:59,661 --> 00:26:00,441
the mum Pocho,

843
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:02,020
which is the nicotine [inaudible],

844
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,110
um,

845
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,510
tobacco in this large joint looking thing.

846
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,400
And that's kind of a cleansing plant.

847
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,700
It's just kind of ceremonial.

848
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,940
They use to cleanse the
space and cleanse your,

849
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,260
your energy before you do it.

850
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,320
When I get the cup and it takes,

851
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,561
you know,

852
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:16,311
at six ounces,

853
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:17,300
so it takes like five,

854
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,520
six gulps and it's pretty bad.

855
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:19,941
You know,

856
00:26:19,941 --> 00:26:20,391
it's thin,

857
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:21,740
it's thinner than Iowasca.

858
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,690
It's Kinda ruddy and a red.

859
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,070
Um,

860
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,903
but it's pretty,

861
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:26,821
pretty potent.

862
00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:29,000
It has that kind of bitter or B tonic,

863
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,380
he kinda thing.

864
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:30,951
But it wasn't,

865
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:31,820
it wasn't so terrible.

866
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:32,421
I ended up thinking,

867
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:32,511
oh,

868
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:33,231
that's not so terrible.

869
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:34,730
And then he has one of his assistants,

870
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,420
uh,

871
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,580
bring some lemonade to wash it down,

872
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,220
apparently the lemonade
as good electrolytes.

873
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:42,440
So you drink that
throughout the day on this.

874
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:46,290
So drink lemonade and I'm
thinking like usual ceremonies,

875
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,840
you just kind of sit
around and stuff happens,

876
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:49,674
you see stuff.

877
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,161
And I was like,

878
00:26:50,161 --> 00:26:50,431
all right,

879
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:52,110
well settling and we're gonna sit around.

880
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,640
No,

881
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,570
not what the plan was.

882
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,613
So he goes,

883
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,221
all right,

884
00:26:56,221 --> 00:26:56,800
everybody,

885
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,120
uh,

886
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,080
meet me out at the front.

887
00:26:58,081 --> 00:27:01,350
We're going to take a little boat ride
to some of my friends in the jungle.

888
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,040
Um,

889
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,510
we're going to bring him some Skeeto nets,

890
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,680
one of the local tribes.

891
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,060
I was like,

892
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,893
what the fuck?

893
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,550
We're just took a bunch of drugs.

894
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:11,310
You're going to make us get on a boat
and go traipsing through the jungle.

895
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,181
It was like,

896
00:27:12,181 --> 00:27:12,630
all right,

897
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,350
I guess that's,

898
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,400
I guess that's what the plan is.

899
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:18,990
So we get all our stuff and
meet out in the front and uh,

900
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,260
everybody starts getting really
kind of chatty in this first part.

901
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,860
And he tells us that doing what Juma is
like living a living a lifetime in a day

902
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,640
is what he says.

903
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,880
Like the medicine is going to change and
that the first part is going to be very

904
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,220
exuberant and um,

905
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,010
may even result in
uncontrollable hilarity,

906
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:38,820
you know,

907
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,170
in,

908
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,200
in the first part I was like,

909
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,034
all right,

910
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,540
and then it'll change from there.

911
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,411
And,

912
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:43,581
uh,

913
00:27:43,581 --> 00:27:46,200
the theme of this one
was the serpent Masada,

914
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:47,040
the water massada,

915
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,600
which is a very kind of fluid.

916
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,110
Uh,

917
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,510
the idea is to be like the water,

918
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:52,344
be very fluid,

919
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,510
be very close to the uh,

920
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,390
close to the earth.

921
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,100
And that's the idea for this.

922
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,750
So everybody's kind of getting chatty
and then we hop in the boat and we,

923
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,050
you know,

924
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:05,520
we cruise around and you could start
to feel that energy start to build very

925
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:06,540
silicide money,

926
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,080
you know,

927
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,040
as that kind of,

928
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,450
you feel something start to come on and
you'd want to stretch out your spine

929
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:16,020
cause there's some energy
coming up through you and
we start to feel that in the

930
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:16,710
boat.

931
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,270
But then by the time we landed on this
little inlet and you're cruising through

932
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:23,280
the jungle in these rivers,

933
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,520
and it's crazy because you'd have no
idea how they know where they're going

934
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:29,490
because they're going through these like
small little openings and the mangroves

935
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:30,324
and the trees and,

936
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,380
but whatever,

937
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,650
35 minutes later we ended up in
this really isolated landing.

938
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,730
It looks like nothing.

939
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:41,210
And these little bare chested children
come out and run out to meet us and we

940
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:43,230
hop off the boat.

941
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,110
And by that point we could tell something,

942
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,690
something very different
was starting to happen.

943
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,330
Like really like coils of energy.

944
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:56,220
We're like pulsing through our bodies
and it felt so fucking ridiculously good

945
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,050
that it's like indescribably good,

946
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,213
like,

947
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,010
like full body kind of orgasmic
little typhoons of energy.

948
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:07,890
Like just pulsing through where
you want to kind of stretch.

949
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,420
You don't know if you want to run,

950
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,710
you don't know if you can just,

951
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,840
it's like almost hard to contain it.

952
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,020
And then from the mental side of things,

953
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,170
everything just starts to open
up like the most beautiful.

954
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,650
We've,

955
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,380
we just landed in the most beautiful
place in the whole universe.

956
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,071
You know,

957
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:28,020
you just start to look around and
it has this kind of look similar,

958
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:31,860
but the lighting is a little bit different
and it's just kind of glowing to you.

959
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:35,040
Like you just landed in fucking
Pandora on Avatar world,

960
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,120
you know?

961
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,230
And the only way I can
describe the feeling of that
was this some combination of

962
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,690
like the best Mtma.

963
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,700
Like what Mtma wished it could be in its
ultimate form and a bunch of mushrooms

964
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:51,010
at the same time just smashed together.

965
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,760
So you had this kind of energetic side
from the mushrooms and this kind of

966
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:58,930
visionary clarity and
this just pure ecstasy of,

967
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:01,720
I feel so fucking great
that I can't even stand it,

968
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:02,501
you know,

969
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,260
which was not at all what I
expected from the medicine.

970
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:05,801
You know?

971
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:07,900
I was expecting something
much more visionary,

972
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,880
kind of head down visions,

973
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,073
stuff like that.

974
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,840
So we get out there and we started
interacting with the tribe.

975
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,530
The kids come and then the little kids
start playing with people in our group

976
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,730
and the kids,

977
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,390
you know,

978
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,440
because Don Howard only brings the
westerners out there to this tribe when

979
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:25,120
they're blasted on Chuma.

980
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:25,600
You know,

981
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,830
the whole tribe thinks that we're the
coolest fucking nation of people ever,

982
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:33,250
ever in the history of the universe
because we're just fucking like hugging.

983
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:38,251
Everybody were like super excited and
we're just looking around in this forest

984
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,730
and it's just beautiful.

985
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:40,660
Like everything is beautiful.

986
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:43,510
Like they bring out these little
bananas for us and we look at,

987
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:44,170
I'm like,

988
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,370
Oh fuck,

989
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,630
that looks good.

990
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,490
And then we take a banana
and you have a bite.

991
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:49,324
And it's like,

992
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,940
it's the most amazing
banana I've ever had.

993
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,920
Like everything is so fresh,

994
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,240
almost as if you've never tried or
done anything ever before in your life.

995
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,290
And you've just been an,

996
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,270
everything is new,

997
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:01,601
you know,

998
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:03,220
like if you hug your friend,

999
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:03,631
and we had,

1000
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:04,840
we had some good friends down there.

1001
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:06,430
I'll one of the people in the tribe.

1002
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,330
It just feels like this amazing
connection you have with them.

1003
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,890
It just tickles with excitement.

1004
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,180
And if you eat a banana,

1005
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,410
it's like the best tasting thing
you've ever had ever before.

1006
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,501
And so they,

1007
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,900
they come and they meet us and,

1008
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:20,950
and the men were off in the,

1009
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,540
off in the jungle doing some work.

1010
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:23,860
So it was just the women from the tribe.

1011
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:28,120
And they start playing some songs and
leading us around and some dances and

1012
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:32,950
we're stomping around and they have a
few like handcrafts that they had made.

1013
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:34,030
And we're cruising around.

1014
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,420
And,

1015
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:34,980
um,

1016
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,400
you know,

1017
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:35,580
uh,

1018
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,680
we picked up a few things to kind of
support the tribe dropped off the,

1019
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,833
um,

1020
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,200
dropped off in a Skeeto nets.

1021
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:42,220
I got this little thing.

1022
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,240
I got you something,

1023
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,150
I don't know why I got you this,

1024
00:31:49,151 --> 00:31:51,400
but this is a rattling main
that has pink dolphins on it.

1025
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,690
So I dunno,

1026
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:53,860
I dunno why,

1027
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,930
but this is yours from there.

1028
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,150
That's pretty dope.

1029
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:58,600
Yeah.

1030
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,090
So it's carved from like
a bean pod that's local.

1031
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:01,810
They're in the jungle.

1032
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:01,961
Well,

1033
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,210
I'm a big fan of dolphins.

1034
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,150
Yeah.

1035
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:04,983
Maybe that's why.

1036
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,100
Maybe that's why they picked off
and called the u s so anyway,

1037
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:10,720
so we're hanging out there and,

1038
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,450
and at that point I started,

1039
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:13,871
you know,

1040
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:14,261
we actually,

1041
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:14,620
we had a,

1042
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,570
we had a crew there with us.

1043
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,540
It was documenting this,

1044
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,291
um,

1045
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,600
which we'll get to see at some
point when this comes out.

1046
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,741
But they were asking,

1047
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:21,340
you know,

1048
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,173
about,

1049
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,361
well,

1050
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:22,991
how do you feel,

1051
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:24,490
what about all the things
you were worried about?

1052
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,110
And it wasn't at that point,

1053
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,050
like I had any solutions to the
problems that I was concerned with.

1054
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:33,640
It was just that all of it was meaningless
because life was so fucking beautiful

1055
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:34,474
and so good,

1056
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,021
you know,

1057
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:35,854
that any,

1058
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:40,370
I didn't have to figure out any of these
problems and worries and loneliness,

1059
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:40,731
fears,

1060
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:41,540
everything.

1061
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:46,040
It was just such an overwhelming feeling
of everything was so amazingly good

1062
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,180
that it just didn't matter.

1063
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:47,511
You know,

1064
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:49,640
it's like we're alive and that's enough.

1065
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:49,970
You know,

1066
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,970
every breath was so amazingly positive
and such a gift to be in that you

1067
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,460
couldn't even worry about something else.

1068
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,980
And that was kind of the nature of that
first little stop off in the jungle and

1069
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,690
I'm really cool.

1070
00:33:05,691 --> 00:33:06,471
But then it started,

1071
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:11,180
so we there for a couple hours and just
laughing and having fun and screwing

1072
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:12,050
around and,

1073
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:16,040
and thinking about things and smiling
and eating little snacks like,

1074
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,190
like the banana and then
it starts to get dusk.

1075
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:23,180
And so we go into another boat ride
and slowly before that had happened,

1076
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,103
kind of the,

1077
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,420
the hilarity of things
and everything started,

1078
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,720
the energy started to drop and we,

1079
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,170
I remembered back to what he was saying,

1080
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:31,490
how the medicine is going to change.

1081
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,730
And certainly that's when
it started to change.

1082
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,340
Everything kind of got
quieter and a little bit,

1083
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:37,941
you know,

1084
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:40,970
still very powerful
but in a different way.

1085
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:41,650
Um,

1086
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,050
kind of that ecstatic energy where you
felt like you had to run around or had to

1087
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:49,070
stretch or had to do something just to
release this energy that was in your body

1088
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,960
that kind of started to die away.

1089
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,710
And so we're at dusk on this boat ride
and the way that the shadows where it was

1090
00:33:57,051 --> 00:34:01,820
like very difficult to distinguish between
the jungle and the reflection on the

1091
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:02,151
water.

1092
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:06,020
So we're cruising in this canoe and it
looks like we're cruising right through

1093
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:07,310
the divide between,

1094
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,300
you know,

1095
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,650
air and water.

1096
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,320
Everything is just really
difficult to discern.

1097
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:14,480
What we're doing is really
kind of cool visual effect,

1098
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:16,610
obviously made stronger by the what tumor.

1099
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,830
And I start to have my first visions from
this experience and I started to have

1100
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:26,831
visions of just what I identified
as the true nature of life and uh,

1101
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,470
and that kind of feminine
life giving birthing energy.

1102
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,390
And it was just this crazy ecstatic
vision of life within life,

1103
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:39,051
within life.

1104
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:40,220
Like looking at a human,

1105
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,690
not only as a person,

1106
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:44,330
but then a collection of
cells filled with bacteria,

1107
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,560
filled with parasites,

1108
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:46,394
filled with life,

1109
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,330
just teaming all the way down to the
level of the flagella that are moving

1110
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:52,670
around like you know,

1111
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,320
and then there was visions of the octopus
tentacles flowing and changing colors

1112
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,700
and visions of ever.

1113
00:34:58,701 --> 00:34:59,600
Even in the dirt.

1114
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:04,220
The dirt itself was alive with different
bacteria and insects and things.

1115
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,210
And everywhere you look,

1116
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:08,720
there was just life
bursting through every seam.

1117
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:12,290
And with that I saw three
women with these long,

1118
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:13,670
venomous fingernails,

1119
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,621
big Philips,

1120
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:17,630
Ewas tits and amber skin and amber hair,

1121
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,321
dark,

1122
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:19,190
dark eyes.

1123
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,180
And I could,

1124
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,340
you could see the venom
dripping from their nails.

1125
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:24,860
And they're smiling at me and waving me,

1126
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,220
waving me for three of them
waving me forward like this.

1127
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,300
And it was the most irresistible
sight I've ever seen.

1128
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:33,980
Just this life everywhere,

1129
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:34,821
tentacles.

1130
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:35,654
And,

1131
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,660
and I realized that,

1132
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,500
that,

1133
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,150
that energy,

1134
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:44,151
that polarity of that extreme life giving
material feminine energy was what was

1135
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:48,120
completely irresistible
to the other force,

1136
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:50,070
which is that that life force,

1137
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:50,671
that source,

1138
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:52,650
the non creation consciousness,

1139
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:52,920
you know,

1140
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,190
that has no form and
seeks order in all things,

1141
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:56,880
you know.

1142
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,280
And so this polarity of
masculine and feminine,

1143
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,920
we're just irresistibly
attracted to each other.

1144
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,581
And that what's,

1145
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:03,390
that's what made the,

1146
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,970
the balance between
the earth and a phrase,

1147
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,500
which I still don't really understand,

1148
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,431
but it kept going.

1149
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:13,320
I kept saying it over and over in my
head was that existence is the ecstasy of

1150
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:14,154
dichotomy.

1151
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,880
And I think what that means is just
that balance between this life giving

1152
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:22,051
feminine,

1153
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:22,711
succulent,

1154
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:23,670
seductive,

1155
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,720
sexy,

1156
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,950
ecstatic,

1157
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:31,310
chaotic presence of the feminine and
the other dichotomy of consciousness

1158
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:32,131
itself,

1159
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:33,720
which has none of those attributes.

1160
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,970
None of those physical attributes.

1161
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,470
But that's what existence is.

1162
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:39,450
It's that dichotomy of both of those.

1163
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,650
What about the van Wyck together?

1164
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,990
The venom wasn't,

1165
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:43,351
you know,

1166
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,030
we think of venom is as evil,

1167
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:49,020
but that's just part of this
visceral life death cycle.

1168
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:49,650
You know,

1169
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,820
things burst forth,

1170
00:36:50,821 --> 00:36:51,750
things die.

1171
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,060
The venom is this kind of chaotic,

1172
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,950
seductive element that is,

1173
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,940
that's all a part of it.

1174
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,290
Like it's not separate.

1175
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,670
It's not like this part is good,

1176
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,480
you know,

1177
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,590
and this part is bad.

1178
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,040
It just all comes forth
naturally without any choice.

1179
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,450
So the venom and the,

1180
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,590
and a banana,

1181
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,250
you know,

1182
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,900
are really the same thing,

1183
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:11,790
just manifested in a different way,

1184
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:12,481
you know?

1185
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,700
So all of it was what was irresistible.

1186
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,080
It wasn't just the good parts,

1187
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,350
you know,

1188
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,183
even these,

1189
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,470
even these women with these venoms,

1190
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,920
nails were completely irresistible
to the place that I was in,

1191
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,581
which was,

1192
00:37:23,581 --> 00:37:25,350
it's very kind of consciousness,

1193
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,540
spiritually centered place.

1194
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,590
And that was completely irresistible to
me and I could see how it would be to

1195
00:37:31,591 --> 00:37:32,760
consciousness itself,

1196
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,750
you know,

1197
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,420
because that's the
dichotomy that creates this,

1198
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,640
the polarity and the
interesting parts of life.

1199
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,960
So we get finally,

1200
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:43,080
everybody was silent on this boat ride
cause we took it a little bit slower.

1201
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:45,030
So it took us about 45 minutes to go back.

1202
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,920
And then my friend Daniel is there,

1203
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:49,470
actually the guy who recommended
it right before we pull it up,

1204
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:50,250
he's like,

1205
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,083
man,

1206
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:56,070
that was like the best sex I've ever
had and all of us just fucking crack up

1207
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:57,480
because that's exactly what it was like.

1208
00:37:57,481 --> 00:38:02,070
I think very similar visions of
just this entering this weird,

1209
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:02,581
sexy,

1210
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,290
seductive world.

1211
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,341
And so this,

1212
00:38:05,341 --> 00:38:06,174
um,

1213
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,290
this dolphin thing came from those
people came from those people.

1214
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,970
They make them and they make them,

1215
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:13,020
they sell them or something.

1216
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:14,560
Wow.

1217
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:14,970
Yup.

1218
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,870
It feels crazy.

1219
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,770
Yeah.

1220
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,770
Like listening to your story
and hold on to those songs.

1221
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,290
Yeah.

1222
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,230
Thanks for bringing this up.

1223
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:20,391
Yeah.

1224
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:21,224
You're welcome.

1225
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,103
You're welcome.

1226
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,890
Really cool.

1227
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,723
Yeah.

1228
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:24,391
So the,

1229
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:24,810
uh,

1230
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,321
so anyways,

1231
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:26,730
we get back and then he's like,

1232
00:38:26,731 --> 00:38:26,941
well,

1233
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:28,260
meet me at back in the Maloca,

1234
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:29,450
which is the ceremonial Ha,

1235
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,420
um,

1236
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,490
to meet me back in the loca
for the night ceremony.

1237
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:36,250
And the Maloca is all lit
with these different candles.

1238
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,323
Um,

1239
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:37,781
you know,

1240
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:39,370
kind of splayed out in the whole,

1241
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,413
um,

1242
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,500
you know,

1243
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,333
the whole Mesa,

1244
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,440
if you want to actually bring up a
picture of that because it's almost

1245
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:45,580
impossible to describe.

1246
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,720
Um,

1247
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,370
what this actually looks like.

1248
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,330
It's pretty,

1249
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:49,961
pretty incredible.

1250
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:53,680
There's some at night and you'll see the
candles and you'll see this Mesa table

1251
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:57,820
and we're just kinda waiting there and
waiting for Don Howard to come in and

1252
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,430
everybody was kind of getting cleaned
up cause we're sweating from the day

1253
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,430
people took showers and
which was a little weird,

1254
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:04,000
cause you're still,

1255
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,650
you're pretty fucking
blasted at this point.

1256
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,573
Is this it right here?

1257
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:07,091
Yeah,

1258
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:07,450
that's,

1259
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:07,841
that's it.

1260
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:08,674
That's a different night.

1261
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,240
There's another night kind of front on,

1262
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:11,363
um,

1263
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,690
first because some of the pictures
that are kind of front on it,

1264
00:39:13,691 --> 00:39:14,770
but that's the table that was,

1265
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:15,640
that was the second night.

1266
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,931
But anyway,

1267
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:17,261
so,

1268
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:18,094
um,

1269
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:23,530
I'm waiting for him and there's these
MoPoTsyo cigarettes on the altar and I'm

1270
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:25,330
wanting to smoke one or us,

1271
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:25,690
you know,

1272
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,680
kind of interested in doing that.

1273
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:31,420
But for some reason I felt weird just
grabbing it off the altar without giving

1274
00:39:31,421 --> 00:39:32,410
anything back to the altar,

1275
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,700
even though he'd been passing them out.

1276
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,563
Yes.

1277
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:35,240
That's,

1278
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,790
that's what it looks
like kind of from behind.

1279
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,043
Um,

1280
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,010
but,

1281
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,260
but so I'd look through
my bag and I was like,

1282
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:41,411
well,

1283
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:43,960
I got to give something to
get this Mopotsyo and uh,

1284
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,591
and I don't know why,

1285
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,030
I'm sure it would have
been fine with Don Howard,

1286
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:47,980
but that's just really
what I felt at that moment.

1287
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,790
And so I looked through my
bag and I had a little stick,

1288
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:53,680
a cinnamon than I use to light
and burn and smells nice.

1289
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,271
But I was like,

1290
00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:54,610
okay,

1291
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,443
that seems fair.

1292
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,230
So I put the cinnamon up there and I
took them a patch on and then I think to

1293
00:39:59,231 --> 00:39:59,650
myself,

1294
00:39:59,650 --> 00:39:59,860
oh,

1295
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,670
I got to light it.

1296
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,410
Well there's a bunch of
candles in front of me,

1297
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,060
but for some reason I didn't even feel
right taking a light from those candles

1298
00:40:07,061 --> 00:40:08,680
without asking first.

1299
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,990
So I asked the candles

1300
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,543
as the candles.

1301
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,493
I said,

1302
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:19,480
do you mind if I borrow some fire and
just clear as another voice as if I was

1303
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:21,160
talking to somebody else
over here to my right.

1304
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,030
It says,

1305
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:22,510
sure,

1306
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,740
cause you're going to give me some smoke.

1307
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,990
And I go,

1308
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:25,823
uh Huh.

1309
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:26,410
Yup,

1310
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,190
you're right.

1311
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,330
So I go and I,

1312
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:32,080
there's a candle here to my left
and I lied a little bit from there.

1313
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,010
And then there was another candle
all the way to my right and I asked,

1314
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:36,311
I was like,

1315
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:36,461
oh,

1316
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:37,240
can I have some fire?

1317
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:37,571
There was like,

1318
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:37,721
yeah,

1319
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:38,554
sure.

1320
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,610
So I lied a little bit more.

1321
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:40,990
It's still wasn't fully quite lit,

1322
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:41,883
you know?

1323
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,110
And so there was a candle in
the middle and without thinking,

1324
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,750
I just went to go light from
the candle in the middle,

1325
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,681
didn't ask,

1326
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:48,340
just didn't even,

1327
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,670
it was kind of unconscious and
inexplicably when I did that,

1328
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:53,680
the smoke just blasted me in the eyes,

1329
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,080
like straight up into my
eyes and really stung.

1330
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,360
And I heard the voice come back and say,

1331
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,860
even when it's fair,

1332
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,180
make sure to ask permission.

1333
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,240
And it was the fucking craziest thing.

1334
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:09,241
And what it was was he was teaching me
the principle of reciprocity is what is

1335
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:14,620
one of the biggest fundamental core
teachings of the shoving people.

1336
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,620
And the idea is that even if
you don't have anything to give,

1337
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,360
at least give your gratitude.

1338
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:24,450
And that's one of the core reasons in
ways that we've gotten off from these kind

1339
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:27,520
of old teachings in that whatever you do,

1340
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:28,450
there's a give and take.

1341
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:28,890
You know,

1342
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,520
when you take an animal,

1343
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,950
you know at the very least give you for

1344
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,440
the gift of that animal when you take,

1345
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,940
it could be a vegetable,

1346
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:38,240
you know,

1347
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,620
just say a little,

1348
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,161
you know,

1349
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:40,910
thanks for that.

1350
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,260
And as the earth in general,

1351
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:42,531
you know,

1352
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:43,610
providing a home,

1353
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,620
providing us place materials,

1354
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,370
um,

1355
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:51,170
the principle of reciprocity would be to
do your part to protect that or at the

1356
00:41:51,171 --> 00:41:54,860
very least just be grateful
for what you've kind of got.

1357
00:41:54,861 --> 00:41:56,120
And that in itself,

1358
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:57,140
that gratitude is,

1359
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,250
is enough,

1360
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,083
you know,

1361
00:41:59,180 --> 00:41:59,420
and it,

1362
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:04,420
but it was funny how that kind of came
up in this kind of very back and forth

1363
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:08,090
verbal teaching from this altar
and this really silly thing.

1364
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:08,271
I mean,

1365
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:10,280
it's my Pocho and fire,

1366
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:10,940
you know?

1367
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,090
But that was kind of the,

1368
00:42:12,091 --> 00:42:17,091
the example that it used to kind of
drive that point home and a really stuck

1369
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:19,040
with me and as something that,

1370
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,001
you know,

1371
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:21,050
always remember like,

1372
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:21,920
all right,

1373
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,400
you know,

1374
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,050
the give and take of things is something
much older and more sacred than even

1375
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:28,820
just an idea that we have.

1376
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:29,061
You know,

1377
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:33,230
there's like that is a fundamental
principle that should be abided by.

1378
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,260
That's something that you feel too.

1379
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:35,570
Yeah.

1380
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:35,840
You know,

1381
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,670
you feel like when you see
someone who doesn't tip,

1382
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:38,421
you know,

1383
00:42:38,421 --> 00:42:41,270
you get this feeling
when you're with them,

1384
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:41,970
you know,

1385
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:42,650
it's,

1386
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:43,700
or someone who,

1387
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:43,970
uh,

1388
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:44,870
is in,

1389
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:45,141
you know,

1390
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:45,720
same,

1391
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,071
similar,

1392
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:46,760
vain,

1393
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,450
rude to someone who's in
the service profession is
trying to be kind to them and

1394
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:50,870
they,

1395
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:54,380
they recognize this imbalance because
the person's trying very hard to be nice

1396
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:56,720
to them so they feel like
they can be shitty to them.

1397
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,390
You see that in as an observer,

1398
00:42:59,600 --> 00:42:59,931
you know,

1399
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:01,460
as an outsider watching that,

1400
00:43:01,461 --> 00:43:02,570
it's very uncomfortable.

1401
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,160
It's like you're seeing in balance,

1402
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:05,360
you're feeling unbounce.

1403
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:05,930
Yeah.

1404
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,570
Or someone throwing a
cigarette butt on the ground.

1405
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:09,763
So common,

1406
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,250
yeah.

1407
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,240
Incredibly common.

1408
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,120
And that's the exact feeling
that you get from that and said,

1409
00:43:14,121 --> 00:43:19,121
this is a person that's not in tune and
amazingly so it seems to be the majority

1410
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:23,000
of people that smoke cigarettes in
their cars throw them out the window.

1411
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,280
Yep.

1412
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:23,430
Man.

1413
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,470
I don't know if it's a majority,

1414
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:25,400
I shouldn't say the majority.

1415
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:26,211
I haven't done a survey,

1416
00:43:26,211 --> 00:43:28,280
but I should say a large number.

1417
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,110
I see it all the time.

1418
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,093
I see it.

1419
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,540
I've counted eight Prius's so far that
I've seen that throw cigarettes out the

1420
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:35,901
window,

1421
00:43:35,901 --> 00:43:37,700
which I find particularly ironic.

1422
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:38,310
Right.

1423
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:42,830
Just the environmentally conscious car
with cigarette flying out the window.

1424
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,693
Right.

1425
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:46,870
Then it makes you wonder why they
chose that environmentally conscious

1426
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,080
car for auditions.

1427
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:48,531
Yeah,

1428
00:43:48,531 --> 00:43:49,300
exactly.

1429
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:49,491
Look,

1430
00:43:49,491 --> 00:43:49,910
cool.

1431
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:50,743
Exactly.

1432
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:51,020
Yeah.

1433
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,853
That's uh,

1434
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,860
that feeling of the balance,

1435
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:55,930
the,

1436
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:56,763
the,

1437
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:57,920
the reciprocity.

1438
00:43:57,921 --> 00:43:58,571
Just the,

1439
00:43:58,571 --> 00:44:00,470
the being aware of,

1440
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:00,801
you know,

1441
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:02,210
the give and take of things.

1442
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,280
That's a very important principle.

1443
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,480
It's very important for me.

1444
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,291
It's to me,

1445
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:06,771
I'm very,

1446
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:07,820
very sensitive to that.

1447
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:10,010
It's one of the most
important things to me.

1448
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:10,630
Yup.

1449
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:14,080
And you're right in line with
the very core teachings of,

1450
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,250
of the shoving people.

1451
00:44:15,251 --> 00:44:16,010
And that was it.

1452
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:16,221
And,

1453
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:17,560
and then they used to give free.

1454
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,510
So the shop Vien was not a race.

1455
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:23,170
It was a collection of individuals that
came out of the jungle collection of

1456
00:44:23,171 --> 00:44:27,020
Shamans and healers and
teachers set up shop in shoving,

1457
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,330
which has an actual location,

1458
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:32,730
but it wasn't racially organized and
they had no hierarchical structure,

1459
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:35,730
which freaks archeologists out because
they keep trying to look for it.

1460
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:35,821
Well,

1461
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:36,654
who's the king?

1462
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:36,930
Well,

1463
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:37,763
there wasn't no king.

1464
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,210
It was like the fucking round table.

1465
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,140
And they cannot,

1466
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,130
they can understand that.

1467
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,470
And they would give
ceremonies of the watch,

1468
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:46,950
Huma and the [inaudible] to any
of the pilgrims that Kinda came.

1469
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,320
And the idea was the
pilgrim brings a gift.

1470
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:50,154
Whatever they have.

1471
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,710
Sometimes they have no gift
and it's just their gratitude.

1472
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:55,770
But many times it was actual
gifts that would come.

1473
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,980
And that's kind of how the
society work based upon,

1474
00:44:59,200 --> 00:44:59,431
you know,

1475
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:01,620
simply that principle of reciprocity.

1476
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:02,610
Um,

1477
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:02,881
you know,

1478
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:03,660
eventually it,

1479
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,990
it died out and it was carried on
by a couple of other traditions,

1480
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:08,880
couple of other places
like the Mochi and things.

1481
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,100
But from that point,

1482
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:12,690
then other things started creeping in,

1483
00:45:12,691 --> 00:45:13,381
hierarchy,

1484
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:13,921
power,

1485
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:14,820
militarism,

1486
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:15,660
et cetera.

1487
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,500
Even the INCAS,

1488
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,480
which people credit is this great,

1489
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,950
highly civilized people,

1490
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:20,310
uh,

1491
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:21,540
which they were to a great degree,

1492
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:24,690
but they were still fully
militarized and you know,

1493
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,670
kind of they took over,

1494
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:30,120
they overwhelmed the whole surrounding
area with a military force,

1495
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:31,800
different than the shoving,

1496
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,680
but to just more typical
to what was going on.

1497
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:37,530
And The Times the shopping
was a really kind of unique,

1498
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,270
unique situation that they had.

1499
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,710
And like I said,

1500
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,670
their core principle,

1501
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:45,750
there was that principle of reciprocity
and guidance from these two really

1502
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:46,680
powerful medicines.

1503
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,083
Wow.

1504
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,380
So tonight's ceremony,

1505
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,191
the night ceremony.

1506
00:45:50,191 --> 00:45:50,341
Yeah.

1507
00:45:50,341 --> 00:45:54,360
So we get in there and the first part
of the night ceremony on his altar,

1508
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:54,961
on his table,

1509
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:59,961
he has these ancient whistling vessels
that are somewhere between 500 to 2,500

1510
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:01,524
years old.

1511
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,810
And they're like these clay vessels.

1512
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:04,980
Some are Jaguars.

1513
00:46:04,981 --> 00:46:06,690
Mine was a two can some,

1514
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:10,380
one of them was life and
death as friends together.

1515
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:12,480
And there's these amazing artifacts,

1516
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,191
life and death,

1517
00:46:13,191 --> 00:46:13,950
his friends.

1518
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:18,280
So one is the skeleton and
the other is this Philip.

1519
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:23,281
She was a woman and they're holding
each other like this and it's life and

1520
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:23,821
death,

1521
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:26,760
his friends and a and
all of these vessels.

1522
00:46:26,761 --> 00:46:29,790
And you blow through the top
and it creates a really unique,

1523
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:30,570
um,

1524
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,470
whistling sound.

1525
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:34,230
And so he asked us all
to the altar and he says,

1526
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:34,831
well,

1527
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:36,750
why don't we try to wake
this up a little bit?

1528
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,141
You know,

1529
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:41,250
and he always has that kind of rise smile
cause he knows he understates what's,

1530
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:42,120
what's going to happen.

1531
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,990
So we all start blowing on
these whistles and together,

1532
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:46,470
you know,

1533
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,180
it sounds discoordinate first,

1534
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:53,070
but then ultimately it locks into this
frequency that feels like it's going

1535
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:56,640
through your entire just penetrating
straight through your head.

1536
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,230
Like you're not even listening to it.

1537
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:02,640
It's just wiping you clean of any
kind of frequency that you might have.

1538
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,040
Like a really strong,

1539
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:08,310
like resonant sound that just goes
straight through your whole body,

1540
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,760
which was kind of a cool
experience in itself.

1541
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,010
And what they used it for was that,

1542
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:14,241
you know,

1543
00:47:14,241 --> 00:47:15,074
aligning,

1544
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:15,961
you know,

1545
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:19,800
just kind of sound and frequency and
getting you basically back to that clean

1546
00:47:19,801 --> 00:47:22,620
slate so that anything you
have going on in your head,

1547
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,210
maybe you got a song stuck in your head,

1548
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:25,320
maybe you gotta beat stuck in your head.

1549
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,770
Maybe you've got some late and
programs kind of going on it.

1550
00:47:28,771 --> 00:47:33,640
Just kind of wipe straight that straight
through and a a cool experience.

1551
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:34,421
Nothing crazy,

1552
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:35,320
more profound than that,

1553
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:38,920
but just kind of awesome
to be a part of this,

1554
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:39,371
you know,

1555
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:42,850
blowing these vessels that have
been used for this purpose,

1556
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:45,160
like ancient consciousness
that Collin technology,

1557
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:45,850
you know,

1558
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:50,060
2000 years old from the Mochi people
and some other people they would say

1559
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:50,811
that's something,

1560
00:47:50,811 --> 00:47:51,621
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

1561
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:55,820
but that's something that
seems to resonate in a lot
of these ancient shamanic

1562
00:47:55,821 --> 00:47:57,660
cultures is the need for music,

1563
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,370
the need for song songs that
carry through ceremonies,

1564
00:48:01,371 --> 00:48:02,840
songs that take you through,

1565
00:48:02,841 --> 00:48:05,510
whether it's a mushroom
ceremony or Iowasca,

1566
00:48:05,511 --> 00:48:07,850
the ios scarecrows and their eco rose.

1567
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:09,140
Those songs that they sing.

1568
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:09,880
What,

1569
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,580
what is the,

1570
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,241
what is there,

1571
00:48:11,241 --> 00:48:12,530
when you talk to them about that,

1572
00:48:12,531 --> 00:48:14,150
what's the connection?

1573
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:17,460
The Ero is their kind of
their own special thing,

1574
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:22,080
but almost every single shamonic
tradition has rattles and that,

1575
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:23,820
and Don Howard had rattles to,

1576
00:48:23,821 --> 00:48:26,100
his rattles were a little
different than these ones,

1577
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,770
but they talk about breaking up,

1578
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:29,401
you know,

1579
00:48:29,401 --> 00:48:29,791
for them,

1580
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:34,020
they can see these energetic forces and
for them they talk about the rattles

1581
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:36,570
breaking up this kind of frequency field,

1582
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:37,733
um,

1583
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,400
around you and kind of recalibrating
it to a certain degree.

1584
00:48:41,401 --> 00:48:44,940
So the rattles are used
completely ubiquitously.

1585
00:48:44,941 --> 00:48:48,630
And then there's other things like singing
bowls which you'd find in Tibet and

1586
00:48:48,631 --> 00:48:48,991
in the,

1587
00:48:48,991 --> 00:48:52,830
in Peru they had the whistling vessels
and other things that make kind of other

1588
00:48:52,831 --> 00:48:53,820
shrill sounds.

1589
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:55,380
And then of course
there's the drum switch.

1590
00:48:55,381 --> 00:48:56,850
Make a beat good for dancing,

1591
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:57,684
are good for that.

1592
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:58,350
Um,

1593
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:02,550
the gross themselves or just the songs
that the plant's teach you and are very

1594
00:49:02,551 --> 00:49:04,710
kind of DMT oriented is,

1595
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:05,700
um,

1596
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,810
as I kind of found out,

1597
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:10,770
cause I found myself singing one of these
songs out of the fucking blue when I

1598
00:49:10,771 --> 00:49:11,251
was smoking,

1599
00:49:11,251 --> 00:49:12,150
snorting the villa.

1600
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,470
But we'll get to that in,

1601
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:14,483
in sequence.

1602
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:15,630
Um,

1603
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:16,170
but yeah,

1604
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:18,960
it kind of just breaks
up the auditory field.

1605
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:19,440
Uh,

1606
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,280
and it also an,

1607
00:49:20,281 --> 00:49:25,281
a lot of cultures that calls in announces
basically the helper spirits to come

1608
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,940
and the allies to come.

1609
00:49:26,941 --> 00:49:27,121
Like,

1610
00:49:27,121 --> 00:49:27,690
Hey,

1611
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:28,440
here we are,

1612
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:28,770
you know,

1613
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:29,640
come find us.

1614
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:30,120
Uh,

1615
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:30,960
is another reason.

1616
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,520
But I don't know.

1617
00:49:32,521 --> 00:49:33,660
I can't see that stuff.

1618
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,690
I mean I just know it kind of sounds
good and it puts me in a good mood.

1619
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:37,660
Um,

1620
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:37,850
and,

1621
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:38,730
and it feels,

1622
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:39,623
feels good,

1623
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,350
but it takes one of those
other seniors to experience it.

1624
00:49:43,351 --> 00:49:46,530
And I don't like speculating on things
that I haven't experienced and they don't

1625
00:49:46,531 --> 00:49:48,960
actually like talking about
things that you can't experience.

1626
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,920
And that's a difference between a religion
and shamanism is they don't tell you

1627
00:49:52,921 --> 00:49:53,700
shit.

1628
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,900
They show you everything,

1629
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:55,471
you know,

1630
00:49:55,471 --> 00:49:56,940
if they can't show you,

1631
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:57,780
they just,

1632
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,710
they won't tell you.

1633
00:49:58,830 --> 00:49:59,071
You know,

1634
00:49:59,071 --> 00:50:00,450
it's like this is,

1635
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,090
this is truth and you have
to go find it for yourself,

1636
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:03,691
you know?

1637
00:50:03,691 --> 00:50:06,510
Whereas religions by and large are like,

1638
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,441
here's the truth.

1639
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:08,550
It's written down in his book.

1640
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:12,600
You better follow it whether it makes
sense or not or will burn you or kill you

1641
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,910
or Rachel.

1642
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:14,540
Well,

1643
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,450
all that stuff's unnecessary
when you can ride the dragon.

1644
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,060
Right.

1645
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,680
It really just completely unnecessary.

1646
00:50:19,681 --> 00:50:20,430
Exactly.

1647
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,151
Cause everybody,

1648
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:25,470
you get to that same conclusion piece
different people to different degrees.

1649
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:26,340
Um,

1650
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,173
but it's,

1651
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:28,311
you know,

1652
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:29,960
and it's reproducible in every individual.

1653
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:31,220
So you don't need to go talking to me.

1654
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:32,330
You don't have to believe in it.

1655
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:32,900
No,

1656
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,660
he does nothing that you have to
believe in other than just what you've

1657
00:50:35,661 --> 00:50:36,590
experienced yourself.

1658
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:37,401
You know?

1659
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:37,850
And that's,

1660
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,310
that's the beauty of this kind
of work to solve or to hear those

1661
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:42,643
beautiful.

1662
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:43,400
Um,

1663
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,920
so then the next part of that ceremony,

1664
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,940
the last part was to snort this liquid
out of what's called a single low,

1665
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:51,590
which is this giant steak.

1666
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:52,851
And I'm,

1667
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:55,760
it's a liquid preparation that
they pour in the tip of it.

1668
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,090
And it was a combination
of the Florida water,

1669
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,350
um,

1670
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,280
tobacco,

1671
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:05,150
some more what Chuma and a few
other plants in this thing.

1672
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,670
And um,

1673
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,840
so you get up there and it's this big
steak and you kind of tip it into one

1674
00:51:11,841 --> 00:51:12,201
nostril.

1675
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:12,351
Yeah,

1676
00:51:12,351 --> 00:51:13,184
I have a little bit.

1677
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:14,330
Um,

1678
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:15,710
you tip it into one nostril

1679
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:24,250
and you tip it into the other
nostril and then it fills your,

1680
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:26,330
it fills your body with,

1681
00:51:26,331 --> 00:51:27,164
uh,

1682
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:32,030
with this kind of fiery kind of
lightening sensation that you feel.

1683
00:51:32,031 --> 00:51:33,200
And it's almost like,

1684
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:34,250
you know,

1685
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,850
you're just holding on to the state
because it's burned in as it's going down

1686
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:40,040
this liquid that you just
tilt it down in your mouth,

1687
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:44,930
but it didn't have any kind of great
physical psycho dynamic effects other than

1688
00:51:44,931 --> 00:51:47,810
just to kind of like really
align you with the altar.

1689
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:48,861
And,

1690
00:51:48,861 --> 00:51:49,694
um,

1691
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:50,540
so there,

1692
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,680
so there at the altar,

1693
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,440
not too much happened,

1694
00:51:54,441 --> 00:51:58,430
but one of the interesting things was
I was the first one to go and I was

1695
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:01,040
waiting for Don Howard to tell me like,

1696
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:02,690
when my experience was up,

1697
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,141
you know,

1698
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:04,160
cause I'm up there at the altar,

1699
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:05,030
everybody's watching me.

1700
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:08,870
And one of the great things about how
he worked his throughout the whole

1701
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:09,291
session,

1702
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:10,190
he never did that.

1703
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,290
And when you had your turn to go up,

1704
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,310
he would never tell you like,

1705
00:52:13,311 --> 00:52:13,611
okay,

1706
00:52:13,611 --> 00:52:14,444
you're done.

1707
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:19,520
He just completely trusted you that you
would move and you would do take action

1708
00:52:19,521 --> 00:52:20,354
at the right time.

1709
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,520
And I really appreciated that.

1710
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:23,360
And that to me,

1711
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,111
you know,

1712
00:52:24,111 --> 00:52:26,750
instilled a great degree of trust in him,

1713
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,790
which is something that
I haven't had immensely.

1714
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:33,470
And in a lot of people is this ultimate
trust that he's got this thing kind of

1715
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:34,304
figured out.

1716
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,450
And you get that from the trust that
he puts in each other individual.

1717
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:39,800
It's kind of this interesting thing.

1718
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,580
So I'm sitting there and really the
only takeaway from that for me was,

1719
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:44,210
you know,

1720
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:44,360
uh,

1721
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,740
communication with the altar.

1722
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:46,910
Um,

1723
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:47,743
that said,

1724
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,130
um,

1725
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,240
basically I said to the,

1726
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:50,970
I,

1727
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:51,201
you know,

1728
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,540
I'm going to protect you and the altar.

1729
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:54,111
You know,

1730
00:52:54,111 --> 00:52:55,010
I could hear it again,

1731
00:52:55,011 --> 00:52:55,844
clear as day.

1732
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:56,480
And he said,

1733
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,320
I'll protect you too.

1734
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:00,050
And that was kind of the end of that,

1735
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,071
that encounter.

1736
00:53:01,071 --> 00:53:05,480
And I look back and Don Howard smiled
and I gave him back the steak and

1737
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,220
everybody went around the circle
and that kind of closed off night.

1738
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:12,260
One end of the serpent,

1739
00:53:12,261 --> 00:53:13,100
Masada night,

1740
00:53:13,101 --> 00:53:13,934
one of three,

1741
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,840
nobody tripped,

1742
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:15,770
nobody freaked out.

1743
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,100
I mean,

1744
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:19,880
tripped by nobody like had
a bad experience with this.

1745
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,970
That is the danger of going down
there and one of these retreats,

1746
00:53:22,971 --> 00:53:23,211
right?

1747
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:24,320
That you might go with a loon,

1748
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,160
you might go with some crazy person

1749
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,330
that can handle the ride.

1750
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:28,170
So he,

1751
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,890
he goes through these extensive
questionnaires that he,

1752
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:32,340
uh,

1753
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:37,340
that he reviews for anybody coming down
and he says he's pretty good at weeding

1754
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:38,280
out,

1755
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:38,760
you know,

1756
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,080
the loons that are going to come.

1757
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:40,531
He says,

1758
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:43,830
it just comes through in the writing
and how they answered the questions.

1759
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:46,590
You ask them to answer essays for him.

1760
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:46,830
Yeah,

1761
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:47,050
yeah,

1762
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:47,430
yeah.

1763
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:48,330
So they're writing,

1764
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:48,601
you know,

1765
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:51,480
writing extensive amounts about
their and 10 about their life,

1766
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:52,510
about their experiences,

1767
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:52,651
blah,

1768
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:52,801
blah,

1769
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:53,520
blah.

1770
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,470
And so he says he's pretty
good at filtering that out.

1771
00:53:55,471 --> 00:53:58,440
But of course some people
who are pathological,

1772
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:58,981
you know,

1773
00:53:58,981 --> 00:54:02,040
can fool them and it's happened before
where he gets in those situations.

1774
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,860
But you don't want to go down
there and fuck with Gandalf.

1775
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:06,803
Like it's just,

1776
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:08,760
you're not going to come out a winner.

1777
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,460
Why is it,

1778
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,170
I always have to ask what happens
when things go wrong that's like,

1779
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,140
you know,

1780
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:14,920
sad.

1781
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,500
It's like,

1782
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,141
I'm like,

1783
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:16,660
uh,

1784
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:16,911
in,

1785
00:54:16,911 --> 00:54:17,641
in some ways.

1786
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:18,630
And that's a,

1787
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,810
I'm a theorist and things
going horribly wrong,

1788
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:22,531
you know,

1789
00:54:22,531 --> 00:54:23,520
so I'm looking at this,

1790
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:23,761
I'm like,

1791
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:24,960
this all sounds beautiful.

1792
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:26,610
What could be unbeautiful about it?

1793
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:26,851
Oh,

1794
00:54:26,851 --> 00:54:28,980
you go down there with
a Dick head for sure.

1795
00:54:28,981 --> 00:54:30,300
And he said he's had that happen.

1796
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,750
He's had that happen where someone
came down and intentionally tried to

1797
00:54:33,751 --> 00:54:34,890
undermine the ceremonies.

1798
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:37,110
I didn't go into what that was,

1799
00:54:37,111 --> 00:54:37,860
but he's,

1800
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:38,693
you know,

1801
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,241
but then,

1802
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:39,421
you know,

1803
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:40,890
he's there and not only is it him,

1804
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,650
he's got two other shamans there as well.

1805
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,710
Indigenous Shamans.

1806
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,930
This Guy Donald Bear,

1807
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:46,741
who's a,

1808
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,240
a Banco current Darrow,

1809
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:52,320
which is the equivalent of like the
coral belt in Jujitsu or something like

1810
00:54:52,321 --> 00:54:52,441
that.

1811
00:54:52,441 --> 00:54:56,610
There's only like a couple in the world
who've been bestowed this great Ios

1812
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:57,443
Garrow honor,

1813
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:58,010
you know,

1814
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:03,010
so a Carindale Donald bear and his wife
don't [inaudible] who's another like

1815
00:55:03,271 --> 00:55:04,990
really bad ass Sean.

1816
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,870
So you have like the wizard council there.

1817
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:07,741
So,

1818
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:08,170
you know,

1819
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,890
they're able to really
work with some stuff and,

1820
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,030
and uh,

1821
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:12,880
and make an impact.

1822
00:55:12,881 --> 00:55:15,660
I wonder what happens to those
people if they are a crazy person.

1823
00:55:15,661 --> 00:55:17,100
They wanted them doing those drugs.

1824
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,130
He imagine if you found that you
could snap somebody back to earth,

1825
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,580
like you could have someone
who's completely sociopathic,

1826
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,310
give him some of this
and they develop empathy.

1827
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,211
I mean,

1828
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:28,080
is that possible?

1829
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:29,940
He always like right off sociopaths.

1830
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:30,901
But is it,

1831
00:55:30,901 --> 00:55:33,000
is it possible that I could ever be cured?

1832
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,081
I mean I don't,

1833
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,060
I don't understand the human mind enough.

1834
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:36,551
You know,

1835
00:55:36,551 --> 00:55:40,020
if from a scientific
standpoint the medicine is an,

1836
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:40,680
and he didn't,

1837
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,900
Don Howard was really
forthright about this,

1838
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:47,610
that the medicine by itself is neither
going to do good nor bad without the

1839
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:50,580
intent of the user because
the intent of the user,

1840
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:52,350
you can use this medicine for,

1841
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:53,483
you know,

1842
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,370
brew whole Brouhaha sorcery,

1843
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:55,740
you know,

1844
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,210
is what they call it and sorcery.

1845
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,830
To what extent that means,

1846
00:55:59,220 --> 00:55:59,640
you know,

1847
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,271
that is,

1848
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:04,350
but basically by saying that he's saying
you could use that to get your own

1849
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:09,300
power and kind of like the Shaman who
amber talks about where you know to them,

1850
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:10,350
that's the dark side.

1851
00:56:10,351 --> 00:56:14,220
So sorcery is kind of a weird word
because they're not like making weird shit

1852
00:56:14,221 --> 00:56:14,581
happened,

1853
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:15,240
although some,

1854
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,260
there's some weird stories,

1855
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:20,400
but really using it for your own
power and weird stories though.

1856
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:24,260
You have to take into account their told
you by people tripping their fucking

1857
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:24,790
balls off.

1858
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:25,540
Yeah,

1859
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,390
I'm sure you think that shit went down.

1860
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,150
I bet you're not a liar.

1861
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:32,320
I'm not saying you're a liar,

1862
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,910
but God damn,

1863
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,290
you have to sort of include that.

1864
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,920
And the no CBO effect of believing
something terrible happened is strong.

1865
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:42,100
We were on Opie and Anthony once and we,

1866
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,980
there was a woman that they have
who's a regular on the show.

1867
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,910
She comes all the time and
they call a stalker patty.

1868
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:49,840
And uh,

1869
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:54,650
we gave Stalker Patty Listerine breath
strip and told her that it was drugs and

1870
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,110
this girl,

1871
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:56,531
I mean,

1872
00:56:56,531 --> 00:56:58,090
I don't know how much of it was an act.

1873
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,070
I don't know how much of it it was.

1874
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,590
She's not like mentally completely there,

1875
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:06,640
but she was acting like she was
tripping or fucking balls off.

1876
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:11,641
Like she just ate the
strongest pot Brownie in the
world and she was just clean

1877
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,870
to the earth trying to stay on.

1878
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,300
And Ari had his balls out like our,

1879
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:21,250
he decided to take his balls out and
stand next to her and pretended as balls

1880
00:57:21,251 --> 00:57:24,160
weren't out and we all
pretended his balls weren't out.

1881
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,800
Like it's so his balls were like hanging
out of his zipper and she was like,

1882
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:27,700
oh my God.

1883
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:28,961
And everyone's like,

1884
00:57:28,961 --> 00:57:29,794
what?

1885
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:30,760
This,

1886
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,061
you know,

1887
00:57:31,061 --> 00:57:31,480
she's like,

1888
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,313
oh my God,

1889
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,460
you guys got me.

1890
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:34,211
There's a drug,

1891
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:35,044
I'm on a drug.

1892
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,000
Like she really believed that.

1893
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:36,520
Yeah.

1894
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,480
Just because of the,

1895
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,420
the effect of telling
someone that they've,

1896
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:40,871
I mean,

1897
00:57:40,871 --> 00:57:44,970
how many people that get hit with
the Holy Spirit when you know,

1898
00:57:44,971 --> 00:57:45,671
you see those people,

1899
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:46,900
they start speaking in tongues,

1900
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:48,803
you know,

1901
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:49,850
when,

1902
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:52,330
what would they do that,

1903
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:52,991
I mean,

1904
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:55,870
would they really be doing that if
someone hadn't sort of pressured him?

1905
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,950
Someone had to put in their
head that that's possible.

1906
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,420
I mean in a vacuum,

1907
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:03,160
how many people are
really going to do that?

1908
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,310
It seems like the only do that if there's
a bunch of other people around them

1909
00:58:06,311 --> 00:58:07,250
that are doing the same thing.

1910
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,420
The power of suggestion takes over
and then you really believe saw la,

1911
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:11,631
la,

1912
00:58:11,631 --> 00:58:11,771
la,

1913
00:58:11,771 --> 00:58:11,981
la,

1914
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:12,500
la La,

1915
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,370
like the board is talking three
you in Jibberish like hypnotists,

1916
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:16,690
you know,

1917
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:19,030
that there's that hypnotists kind of,

1918
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:19,930
um,

1919
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:23,050
idea that the more people who are there
and the more people who were watching,

1920
00:58:23,051 --> 00:58:25,540
the easier it is to
hypnotize you because of the,

1921
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:26,920
the whole dynamic.

1922
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,230
And the other people and
exactly our suggestion.

1923
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:29,861
Yeah,

1924
00:58:29,861 --> 00:58:30,461
absolutely.

1925
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:31,210
That plays a part.

1926
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,380
I've seen that happen.

1927
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:36,250
I've seen a lot of people get hypnotized
because I had a friend who was a

1928
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:37,084
hypnotist.

1929
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:42,040
There was a guy named Frank Santos who
was a comedian in Rhode Island and he was

1930
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:43,180
a dirty hippy and test.

1931
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:47,950
He's doing a show at stitches and his son
is actually apparently a hypnotist to,

1932
00:58:47,951 --> 00:58:49,290
I think it's Frank Santa was junior.

1933
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,040
Um,

1934
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,280
I just got a tweet for him.

1935
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:55,930
His Dad was a super nice guy and employed
me actually way back in the day you

1936
00:58:55,931 --> 00:58:56,710
had a comedy club.

1937
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:57,280
Cool.

1938
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,670
Hooked me up when I was
just starting to a headline,

1939
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:02,470
but I watched this guy

1940
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,450
dozens of times over several years.

1941
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:11,590
I watched him and we would all watch like
comics would come from like if we knew

1942
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:13,330
Frank Santos was doing
a show like at Nick's,

1943
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:14,710
we would go across town,

1944
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,030
drive over just to watch.

1945
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:16,840
Cause it was,

1946
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,100
you couldn't believe it was real.

1947
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:21,040
You would watch these people and all
of a sudden they believe they're having

1948
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:21,831
with Madonna.

1949
00:59:21,831 --> 00:59:22,940
Guys would come in their pants.

1950
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,380
They would be having sex on stage and
they'd come in their pants and we would,

1951
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,860
you would have a thing that he would say
to women and they would have an orgasm

1952
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:31,941
so he could say it,

1953
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:32,181
I'm a,

1954
00:59:32,181 --> 00:59:32,571
you know,

1955
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:37,100
a touch you on the head and I'm going
to say creamy cream filled donut or

1956
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:37,460
something.

1957
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,390
He would come up with a name,

1958
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:39,590
whatever you wanted to say.

1959
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:40,720
If it's not,

1960
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,410
that should be that I'm making that up.

1961
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,960
It's my son's probably why she
ain't never fucking saw that.

1962
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:47,000
My point is he would have,

1963
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:47,210
like,

1964
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:50,570
I would say Abracadabra and he would
touch someone on the forehead and the one

1965
00:59:50,571 --> 00:59:50,991
would just go,

1966
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:51,824
oh my God.

1967
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,750
And people would be dying laughing.

1968
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:58,490
She women would be embarrassed and there's
people that would be convinced that

1969
00:59:58,491 --> 00:59:59,181
they're naked.

1970
00:59:59,181 --> 00:59:59,361
Like,

1971
00:59:59,361 --> 00:59:59,991
oh my God.

1972
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:00,920
Like they have their clothes on,

1973
01:00:00,921 --> 01:00:01,910
they're convinced her naked.

1974
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,760
There's people that were convinced that
everyone in the audience was naked.

1975
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,361
I mean,

1976
01:00:05,361 --> 01:00:08,100
they would look around and
laughing and they really were,

1977
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,560
it's like it was really working.

1978
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,930
It wasn't that they were acting.

1979
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:13,670
There was something weird going on.

1980
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,040
And he knew when people were under,

1981
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,350
when they weren't like
people would try to fake it,

1982
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:20,460
they would be on stage with
them and he would look at my,

1983
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:20,811
nope,

1984
01:00:20,811 --> 01:00:21,051
nope,

1985
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:21,261
sorry,

1986
01:00:21,261 --> 01:00:21,620
you gotta go.

1987
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:21,831
No,

1988
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:21,891
no,

1989
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:22,040
no,

1990
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:22,873
I'm hypnotized.

1991
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:23,571
And he was like,

1992
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:23,691
no,

1993
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:24,230
you're not.

1994
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:24,351
No,

1995
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:24,800
you're not.

1996
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,730
It's not going to work with you.

1997
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,080
And he would just shuffle them off.

1998
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,120
And the ones that it would work on those,

1999
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:29,960
the ones you did it on.

2000
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:30,980
Yup.

2001
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,300
Super interesting dynamic.

2002
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,700
The mind is so incredibly powerful.

2003
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,000
That is one of the main reasons why it's
super difficult to take someone's word

2004
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:41,550
in account of,

2005
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,480
of an event when someone
starts talking about an event,

2006
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:45,860
like something that happened,

2007
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:46,521
you know,

2008
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:48,260
whether it's watching car accident,

2009
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:48,681
you know,

2010
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:51,420
being participating in
an accident and what,

2011
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,220
how much,

2012
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:55,970
how much of what you actually see in
a short traumatic circumstance or you

2013
01:00:55,971 --> 01:00:56,804
really,

2014
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:58,030
really collected like say,

2015
01:00:58,210 --> 01:00:58,820
uh,

2016
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:03,680
like an asteroid was to slam into the
ocean near Long Beach and kill like a

2017
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:07,790
fucking hundred thousand people and you
were there and you saw something happen.

2018
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,400
He saw it hit the water.

2019
01:01:09,401 --> 01:01:14,401
You saw how many people are really going
to recount that correctly unless you

2020
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:15,650
watched the video.

2021
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:18,680
Your version of the
events could vary wildly.

2022
01:01:18,681 --> 01:01:18,831
I mean,

2023
01:01:18,831 --> 01:01:19,460
it could be,

2024
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,170
you could be off by hours.

2025
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:21,801
You know,

2026
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:22,850
if you don't talk to anybody,

2027
01:01:22,851 --> 01:01:25,280
false cell phones go
down your version of it.

2028
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,280
If no one's videotaping it,

2029
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:28,460
we never get a chance to see it.

2030
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:30,650
Who knows what versions
we're going to get.

2031
01:01:30,651 --> 01:01:32,420
We're going to a hundred
different versions,

2032
01:01:32,421 --> 01:01:33,590
different timelines.

2033
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,890
It's one of the things that people
I think connect to a lot of,

2034
01:01:36,891 --> 01:01:37,160
uh,

2035
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,630
ideas of conspiracy.

2036
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,111
You know,

2037
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:39,800
people say,

2038
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,131
Oh,

2039
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:40,371
you know,

2040
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:42,710
if all these people told this story,

2041
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:43,131
you know,

2042
01:01:43,131 --> 01:01:47,330
how much of it could be a line is that
there's another option that's not how

2043
01:01:47,331 --> 01:01:48,320
much of it is a lie.

2044
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:53,420
Cause how much of it people who were
just dwelling on crazy shit until it

2045
01:01:53,421 --> 01:01:55,760
becomes real in their own head.

2046
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:58,850
And then they have these stories
and they're stories coincide.

2047
01:01:58,851 --> 01:01:59,210
Okay,

2048
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:02,240
well there's a part of the brain they
call the simulator and that's what makes

2049
01:02:02,241 --> 01:02:07,241
you like think of some weird fucked up
food combination like a cinnamon Manet's,

2050
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:08,450
right?

2051
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:11,900
No one's ever had cinnamon
Manet's probably some weeds
eating it right now where

2052
01:02:11,901 --> 01:02:16,901
they're going the fuck he saying use
the simulator to give you an a very

2053
01:02:17,991 --> 01:02:20,310
accurate idea of what cinnamon Manet's

2054
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:20,760
tastes like.

2055
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,730
And that's a very valuable
part of evolution.

2056
01:02:23,731 --> 01:02:26,400
But if you're using the
simulator constantly enough,

2057
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:27,810
it's almost going to be like,

2058
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,081
oh yeah,

2059
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:29,100
I had cinnamon Manet's,

2060
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:29,581
you know,

2061
01:02:29,581 --> 01:02:30,900
if you thought about that,

2062
01:02:30,901 --> 01:02:32,760
and then for 10 years down the road,

2063
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:33,630
Oh shit,

2064
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:34,051
wait,

2065
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:36,120
I actually never actually had
cinnamon Manet's you know?

2066
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:36,341
Well,

2067
01:02:36,341 --> 01:02:37,720
they've done that with people.

2068
01:02:37,721 --> 01:02:42,721
They've implanted fake memories
and in like in a strategic sense,

2069
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:46,300
they've done it in some sort
of another way with mice.

2070
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:50,500
They figured out a way to
implant some memories in mice,

2071
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:53,020
some weird artificial memories,

2072
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:54,070
like they have the,

2073
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,110
I believe if I'm butchering this,

2074
01:02:56,111 --> 01:02:56,910
I apologize.

2075
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,120
I'm obviously not a scientist,

2076
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,110
but I believe that what
they've accomplished so far
as they've attained this

2077
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:05,950
rudimentary ability to
introduce artificial thoughts,

2078
01:03:05,951 --> 01:03:10,951
at least in concept and at
least in concept on a less
complex mind is a humans,

2079
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:17,010
but that they can do it through tactics
with a person through counseling.

2080
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:22,890
If someone particularly like tries to
bend your mind and bend your version of

2081
01:03:23,501 --> 01:03:27,730
the past over a long series of things and
reinforces it with your friendship and

2082
01:03:27,731 --> 01:03:30,250
alienates you and you
don't follow the script,

2083
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:30,731
you know,

2084
01:03:30,731 --> 01:03:32,020
I mean that's like watching homeland.

2085
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:32,560
Yeah,

2086
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,131
sure,

2087
01:03:33,131 --> 01:03:33,431
sure.

2088
01:03:33,431 --> 01:03:35,020
It's just what churches do as well.

2089
01:03:35,021 --> 01:03:35,321
You know,

2090
01:03:35,321 --> 01:03:37,060
if you don't agree with their dog man,

2091
01:03:37,061 --> 01:03:37,894
their doctrine,

2092
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:39,310
they'll get like,

2093
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:40,120
you know,

2094
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,650
you'll get a lot of rejection,

2095
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:42,520
but if you do agree,

2096
01:03:42,521 --> 01:03:44,140
you'll get a lot of acceptance.

2097
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,590
And that's one of the
reasons why really it's,

2098
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:48,610
it's really weird,

2099
01:03:48,611 --> 01:03:50,380
but what they decide to be upset about,

2100
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:50,831
you know,

2101
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:53,620
like I'm watching all these people that
are freaking out about this gay guy that

2102
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:56,110
just got drafted into the NFL,

2103
01:03:56,111 --> 01:03:56,620
right.

2104
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:57,580
First openly gay guy.

2105
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:00,040
And I'm seeing it on both sides.

2106
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:00,341
You know,

2107
01:04:00,341 --> 01:04:02,440
I'm seeing people saying
this is an amazing thing,

2108
01:04:02,441 --> 01:04:03,940
and then I'm also seeing people saying,

2109
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:04,181
you know,

2110
01:04:04,181 --> 01:04:04,421
hey,

2111
01:04:04,421 --> 01:04:06,460
why don't you just fucking
keep it to himself?

2112
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:07,570
Like no one gives a shit.

2113
01:04:07,571 --> 01:04:08,470
Like we're not,

2114
01:04:08,471 --> 01:04:09,460
we're not homophobic.

2115
01:04:09,461 --> 01:04:10,390
We just don't want to hear it.

2116
01:04:10,391 --> 01:04:10,690
You know?

2117
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:11,523
It's,

2118
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:12,970
it's fascinating to see,

2119
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:14,081
oh,

2120
01:04:14,081 --> 01:04:14,980
it's like to what?

2121
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:16,090
What's,

2122
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:16,381
you know,

2123
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:21,040
what is it about this that people are
connecting with religion because there's

2124
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:23,940
so much crazy shit about
religion that no one's freaking,

2125
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,470
why isn't everybody
freaking out about tattoos?

2126
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,060
Because it's pretty,

2127
01:04:28,061 --> 01:04:28,930
God damn clear.

2128
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:30,400
You're not supposed to get tattoos.

2129
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,240
Why isn't everybody
freaking out about piercing?

2130
01:04:33,241 --> 01:04:34,420
You not supposed to get pierced,

2131
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:35,051
all that.

2132
01:04:35,051 --> 01:04:37,390
Isn't that why you
dwelling and the gay thing,

2133
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,550
like why is the gay thing
the number one thing?

2134
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,350
What about shellfish?

2135
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:44,500
Where's the the outrage
at the fish markets?

2136
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,300
Where's the protests?

2137
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:47,021
Where people,

2138
01:04:47,021 --> 01:04:48,250
what is really going on?

2139
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:48,830
He was this,

2140
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:49,131
this,

2141
01:04:49,131 --> 01:04:51,260
this masculine story that's been told.

2142
01:04:51,261 --> 01:04:53,300
I mean you got to figure
somewhere between,

2143
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:58,480
the stats are like in Germany it's 10%
and another places it's 2% but a certain

2144
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:00,590
percentage of men are gay.

2145
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:01,070
Yeah,

2146
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:01,820
they're just gay.

2147
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:02,300
Yeah.

2148
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:06,380
And let's get really good number of
those are just fighting it just barely

2149
01:05:06,381 --> 01:05:11,030
hanging on and then there's this story
that's out that if you are that way,

2150
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,560
then you're,

2151
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:13,460
you're not a man,

2152
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,510
you're not a full man,

2153
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:14,841
you know?

2154
01:05:14,841 --> 01:05:15,674
And so this,

2155
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:18,070
this kind of fear of not being

2156
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,020
a full man is imprinted in us.

2157
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,680
And then the combination of that mixed
with these people who are desperately

2158
01:05:23,681 --> 01:05:26,890
fighting it because they really can,

2159
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,420
are barely hanging on.

2160
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:30,280
It creates these crazy scenarios.

2161
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:35,370
I hope that it bounces out to the point
where you can goof on gay guys without

2162
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,680
worry about being labeled as homophobic.

2163
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:43,780
Like they're on the menu
for being goofed on.

2164
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,480
It's like there's like,

2165
01:05:46,481 --> 01:05:47,470
if you say anything,

2166
01:05:47,471 --> 01:05:49,750
if you see if he joke
around about gay people,

2167
01:05:49,751 --> 01:05:51,850
you owe his homophobic comments.

2168
01:05:51,851 --> 01:05:54,250
Like was that what it was?

2169
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,113
Are you sure?

2170
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,330
Because I think there's some gay
people to do some creepy shit.

2171
01:05:58,331 --> 01:06:00,400
It's not negative against gays,

2172
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:04,930
but I have a gay friend or a friend
who's friends with a gay guy more.

2173
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:05,711
I know the guy,

2174
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:09,700
but my friend really knows him and
the gay guy keeps trying to fuck him

2175
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,120
and you know,

2176
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,160
he's like stuck in this situation.

2177
01:06:15,161 --> 01:06:15,371
Like,

2178
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:15,760
man,

2179
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,770
I can't be friends with
this fucking guy anymore.

2180
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,720
Like I thought I was
going to be open minded.

2181
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,610
And then you realized
somewhere along the line,

2182
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,870
oh this is a dude.

2183
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:24,340
Oh he's a dude.

2184
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:25,600
And so he's like,

2185
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,540
just like a guy friend that hangs
around with your girlfriend,

2186
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:29,950
you don't trust that motherfucker.

2187
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:30,460
Yeah,

2188
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,170
you don't trust this gay guy,

2189
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:35,380
great guy hanging around
with the hot lesbian.

2190
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:39,400
He's going to want to fuck you.

2191
01:06:39,401 --> 01:06:40,091
If you're a guy,

2192
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:40,924
it's okay.

2193
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:42,070
There's nothing wrong with it.

2194
01:06:42,071 --> 01:06:42,940
But you know,

2195
01:06:42,941 --> 01:06:45,430
you gotta be real careful if you're
a dude and you're in one of those

2196
01:06:45,431 --> 01:06:46,264
situations,

2197
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,030
this guy won't leave him alone.

2198
01:06:49,031 --> 01:06:50,710
So it's like ruining his head.

2199
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:54,910
Like he associates that guard down
instead of with being with his friend.

2200
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,480
It's being his friend that says crazy
shit when he has a couple of drinks in

2201
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,200
him,

2202
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,970
you know where it's like he starts,

2203
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,280
he's just trying to like
psychological warfare on him.

2204
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,270
He's trying to say things like,

2205
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:06,160
look no one is born gay.

2206
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:10,120
You choose to be gay because
once you try it you like,

2207
01:07:10,121 --> 01:07:14,050
it starts like working on
your implanting idea strategy.

2208
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:18,100
He's just working his pimp
camp work camp strong.

2209
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:20,230
He's just flexing on my poor friend.

2210
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:21,251
You know?

2211
01:07:21,251 --> 01:07:22,120
And if you,

2212
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,010
if you started to do a joke about that,

2213
01:07:24,011 --> 01:07:26,890
that would be widely
considered homophobic.

2214
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:32,490
You know why they considered gay men
get a pass on all the douche genus that

2215
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:34,360
comes along with being a man.

2216
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:37,051
You know what I mean?

2217
01:07:37,051 --> 01:07:38,170
Weird Women Bro.

2218
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,380
We all possess Douchey,

2219
01:07:39,381 --> 01:07:40,810
knows it's not gender specific.

2220
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:42,100
We all sort of have things,

2221
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:44,830
I mean we're all working out life.

2222
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,950
We're all working out life from the,

2223
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,980
the information that was given to us that
people didn't know what the fuck they

2224
01:07:50,981 --> 01:07:51,814
were doing.

2225
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:56,800
We are working out life based on what
we figured out over the course of our

2226
01:07:56,801 --> 01:07:57,634
lifetime.

2227
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:02,820
And we had to de learn and d program
a lot of shit that was talked to us.

2228
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:08,290
A lot of nonsense that was spoken or
reinforced every fucking which way you

2229
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:08,750
look.

2230
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:12,100
The movies to songs to conscious people,

2231
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,630
pressure from your own parents,

2232
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,093
pressure from your own.

2233
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,940
It's gotta be one of the weirdest things.

2234
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:17,571
You know,

2235
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:17,781
there's,

2236
01:08:17,781 --> 01:08:19,670
there's people that never
recover from that shit.

2237
01:08:19,671 --> 01:08:20,031
I have,

2238
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:23,420
I have friends that whatever fucking
weirdness their parents put on them,

2239
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:25,370
they just Voodoo a five,

2240
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,510
they just don't have any confidence.

2241
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:28,160
They don't have any
ability to be themselves.

2242
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:29,480
That's an interesting thing.

2243
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:30,980
When you look at world religions,

2244
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:36,010
it's the heredity and low and
region is the absolute hands down.

2245
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:39,650
Number one deciding factor
about what religion you are.

2246
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:40,400
You know,

2247
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,310
if it was like you're
just finding the truth,

2248
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:43,581
you know,

2249
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:45,020
and you're looking at
everything and finding the true,

2250
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:46,880
it'd be fucking interspersed everywhere.

2251
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:48,050
But really what it is,

2252
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:50,510
it's just you're in an area and that's
what fucking taught to you and that's the

2253
01:08:50,511 --> 01:08:51,140
story.

2254
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,700
And so that's why you're in that religion.

2255
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:54,860
It's not that that's the best one,

2256
01:08:54,861 --> 01:08:55,161
it's just,

2257
01:08:55,161 --> 01:08:56,720
that's the one that's been
fucking taught to you.

2258
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,040
Eddie Bravo and I pulled,

2259
01:08:58,041 --> 01:08:59,570
had very similar,

2260
01:08:59,571 --> 01:09:00,230
um,

2261
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:04,640
childhood revelations and we're
having a conversation one day about,

2262
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:05,090
uh,

2263
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:07,730
the moment we realized there
was more than one religion.

2264
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:08,961
Like that's how we,

2265
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:11,210
we both kind of realized it was bullshit.

2266
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:13,130
Like I found out about Jews,

2267
01:09:13,131 --> 01:09:14,600
my uncle married a Jew,

2268
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,580
a nice Jewish woman,

2269
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:17,760
and um,

2270
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,530
converted,

2271
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:20,600
went through the whole
rig tomorrow and I was,

2272
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:22,760
I didn't understand what was going on.

2273
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:23,750
I was six years old,

2274
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:24,320
you know,

2275
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,240
and so they had explained it to me.

2276
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:26,960
They said,

2277
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:27,530
well,

2278
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:28,030
you know,

2279
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:28,490
uh,

2280
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:30,470
uncle sal on the south.

2281
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:34,040
So it was just going to change
religions all were like,

2282
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:34,610
okay,

2283
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:35,510
like what does that mean?

2284
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:35,871
Well,

2285
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,920
he's going to become Jewish,

2286
01:09:36,921 --> 01:09:40,490
so he's going to have to go through
this whole ceremony and learn a bunch of

2287
01:09:40,491 --> 01:09:41,120
things.

2288
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:41,331
You know,

2289
01:09:41,331 --> 01:09:42,680
how to learn about,

2290
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:42,801
uh,

2291
01:09:42,801 --> 01:09:43,341
the really like,

2292
01:09:43,341 --> 01:09:45,260
you have to take lessons with a rabbi.

2293
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:46,551
And I was like,

2294
01:09:46,551 --> 01:09:46,731
well,

2295
01:09:46,731 --> 01:09:46,841
what,

2296
01:09:46,841 --> 01:09:47,360
what is,

2297
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,320
what is Jewish?

2298
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:49,131
And they're like,

2299
01:09:49,131 --> 01:09:49,291
well,

2300
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:52,040
this is some people that have
a different religion than ours.

2301
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,140
You can masturbate more.

2302
01:09:53,141 --> 01:09:54,200
He can't eat bacon,

2303
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,430
but pretty much similar.

2304
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:58,830
It was just the idea that
there was another religion,

2305
01:09:59,100 --> 01:09:59,230
blah,

2306
01:09:59,230 --> 01:09:59,381
blah,

2307
01:09:59,381 --> 01:09:59,531
blah,

2308
01:09:59,531 --> 01:09:59,661
blah,

2309
01:09:59,661 --> 01:09:59,870
blah.

2310
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:03,020
Do they have the same God
like then shit got weird.

2311
01:10:03,021 --> 01:10:04,430
I started asking questions like that.

2312
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,810
They have the same God.

2313
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,570
I get the God essentially is the same,

2314
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:09,823
but they don't,

2315
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,120
they believe in Jesus.

2316
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:12,650
They just don't believe he's the Messiah.

2317
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:13,780
They don't,

2318
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:14,120
they don't,

2319
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,290
they don't believe in the resurrection.

2320
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:15,501
You're like,

2321
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:15,891
well,

2322
01:10:15,891 --> 01:10:17,540
what the fuck is going on?

2323
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:19,270
And they're right there and all
the sound's going to marijuana.

2324
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,113
These crazy people.

2325
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:21,650
What are you talking about?

2326
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:23,210
Like I thought we figured this all out.

2327
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,500
Like when I was six,

2328
01:10:24,501 --> 01:10:25,610
I guess five,

2329
01:10:25,611 --> 01:10:26,001
six,

2330
01:10:26,001 --> 01:10:26,780
whatever it was,

2331
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:27,740
which was first grade,

2332
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:28,603
I guess it was six.

2333
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,460
Um,

2334
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:34,460
I went through one of the biggest
changes in my entire life as far as my

2335
01:10:35,121 --> 01:10:37,370
understanding of the world around me.

2336
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:42,520
And it was caused by one year of
Catholic school and being in that school,

2337
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:45,860
seeing the darkness of that
place and all the evil,

2338
01:10:45,861 --> 01:10:50,060
those fucking people and all the kids
who were just like constricted and yelled

2339
01:10:50,061 --> 01:10:50,894
at in that place.

2340
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:52,130
I knew,

2341
01:10:52,131 --> 01:10:53,450
I knew it was bullshit.

2342
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,510
I was like this and uncle sal together.

2343
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:57,171
Okay,

2344
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:58,370
the whole thing is nonsense.

2345
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,610
And that was like realizing
when I was six I was like,

2346
01:11:01,611 --> 01:11:02,444
Jesus,

2347
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,130
this bad word.

2348
01:11:04,131 --> 01:11:06,890
He used street Jesus figure speech folks.

2349
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:08,840
All I was thinking was like,

2350
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:09,231
oh my God,

2351
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:11,240
this world is run by crazy people.

2352
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:14,070
Like I was given birth into a land

2353
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,180
that's filled with people that are
operating on momentum and the momentum of

2354
01:11:18,181 --> 01:11:23,181
like one of the craziest fucking stories
of all time as it's a god Damn Zombie

2355
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:28,140
story and everyone is on this momentum
of the Zombie Story to the point where

2356
01:11:28,141 --> 01:11:32,190
the men aren't fucking and the women are
wearing penguin outfits and everybody's

2357
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:33,060
beacon kids.

2358
01:11:33,061 --> 01:11:33,600
And I'm like,

2359
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,090
what are you guys doing?

2360
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,230
What is this?

2361
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:38,350
So

2362
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:39,350
and then what?

2363
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:41,110
What was really bad about it though?

2364
01:11:41,111 --> 01:11:42,340
It's not that they were just doing it,

2365
01:11:42,341 --> 01:11:46,390
but how aggressively their
mission was to spread it by death,

2366
01:11:46,391 --> 01:11:47,290
by baby,

2367
01:11:47,291 --> 01:11:49,450
by whatever fucking means possible.

2368
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:50,441
You squash everything.

2369
01:11:50,441 --> 01:11:52,540
And that's what kind
of swept through Peru.

2370
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:52,721
You know,

2371
01:11:52,721 --> 01:11:54,610
they were doing these
watch Houma ceremonies.

2372
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:57,040
The missionaries come through
and see it and they're like,

2373
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:57,601
oh no,

2374
01:11:57,601 --> 01:11:57,670
no,

2375
01:11:57,670 --> 01:11:57,821
no,

2376
01:11:57,821 --> 01:11:58,654
we can't have that.

2377
01:11:58,780 --> 01:11:58,961
You know,

2378
01:11:58,961 --> 01:12:00,400
they're accessing higher truth,

2379
01:12:00,401 --> 01:12:01,990
finding reproducible,

2380
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:02,471
you know,

2381
01:12:02,471 --> 01:12:04,750
knowledge about the universe
through consciousness.

2382
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:05,531
No,

2383
01:12:05,531 --> 01:12:06,221
we can't have that.

2384
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:08,140
But they also couldn't
completely squash it out.

2385
01:12:08,141 --> 01:12:11,350
So they kind of
reconstructed the ceremony,

2386
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:13,780
renamed the medicine from watch Houma,

2387
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:18,490
which came from the plant spirit watch
human I think is how you say it and

2388
01:12:18,491 --> 01:12:19,480
called it San Pedro.

2389
01:12:19,481 --> 01:12:19,931
And of course,

2390
01:12:19,931 --> 01:12:22,980
Saint Peter is the person
who holds the keys to heaven.

2391
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:26,020
I guess that's who you hang out with
right before you walked through the pearly

2392
01:12:26,021 --> 01:12:26,854
gates or whatever.

2393
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:27,581
So,

2394
01:12:27,581 --> 01:12:31,270
and then in renaming that they
allowed it to kind of still exist,

2395
01:12:31,271 --> 01:12:34,000
but they completely
Catholicized the whole thing.

2396
01:12:34,001 --> 01:12:35,620
They changed the nature of the altar.

2397
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:40,510
It became more religio centric and
then reconstructed the nature of the

2398
01:12:40,511 --> 01:12:41,081
ceremony.

2399
01:12:41,081 --> 01:12:45,760
So it was like communing with Saint Peter
and taking a glimpse through the gates

2400
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:46,151
of Heaven.

2401
01:12:46,151 --> 01:12:49,410
So they changed the
whole framework of the,

2402
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:53,920
the ceremony and kind of watered down the
medicine a little bit and then used it

2403
01:12:53,921 --> 01:12:56,380
in their own for their
own religious purposes.

2404
01:12:56,381 --> 01:12:59,650
And that way it kind of
changed the whole nature of,

2405
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:00,850
of what this was,

2406
01:13:00,851 --> 01:13:02,170
which was these guys.

2407
01:13:02,171 --> 01:13:04,810
And if you look at the key stone
of art for the shoving people,

2408
01:13:04,811 --> 01:13:07,210
it's this tapestry called
the Estella Raimondi.

2409
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:10,690
And it's this dude just fucking head up,

2410
01:13:10,691 --> 01:13:14,950
heart forward holding two stocks of
with Chuma turn it into a Jaguar with

2411
01:13:14,951 --> 01:13:16,330
snuffed coming down his nose.

2412
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,950
Woo.

2413
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:19,810
I need that as a tattoo.

2414
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,333
Totally.

2415
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:22,293
Totally.

2416
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:23,800
If you want to look up as Stella.

2417
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:24,191
Yes.

2418
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:24,941
T e l.

2419
01:13:24,941 --> 01:13:27,610
L a Rye Mondi are a I.

2420
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:27,821
M.

2421
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:28,001
O.

2422
01:13:28,001 --> 01:13:28,181
N.

2423
01:13:28,181 --> 01:13:28,361
D.

2424
01:13:28,361 --> 01:13:28,780
I.

2425
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,021
Yeah.

2426
01:13:29,021 --> 01:13:29,621
Pull that up.

2427
01:13:29,621 --> 01:13:30,610
That needs to be a t shirt.

2428
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:31,421
Yeah,

2429
01:13:31,421 --> 01:13:32,254
it should be an honor.

2430
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,610
It's bad ass.

2431
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:37,060
Put that alongside the Zombie on a t
shirt and then chip on the tee shirt.

2432
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:38,560
So that was the old,

2433
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:39,311
that was the old way.

2434
01:13:39,311 --> 01:13:42,730
And I'll tell you in a little bit on the
third ceremony why the Jaguar was the

2435
01:13:42,731 --> 01:13:43,730
most sacred animals.

2436
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,280
I had an experience with that.

2437
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:46,910
So to go to the second one,

2438
01:13:46,911 --> 01:13:47,140
no,

2439
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:48,700
the second one is the earth ceremony.

2440
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:49,241
And by this,

2441
01:13:49,241 --> 01:13:53,890
this is day five and I
started to go through kind of
a detox cause you're eating

2442
01:13:53,891 --> 01:13:54,281
very,

2443
01:13:54,281 --> 01:13:55,001
very clean,

2444
01:13:55,001 --> 01:13:55,661
no sugar,

2445
01:13:55,661 --> 01:13:56,321
no dairy,

2446
01:13:56,321 --> 01:13:57,154
no wheat.

2447
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:02,500
The medicine itself is very detoxifying
and I'd been drinking and whatever,

2448
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:07,000
eating crap and during the normal
kind of entertaining thing.

2449
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:07,301
Um,

2450
01:14:07,301 --> 01:14:09,430
I mean I still eat pretty
good for obviously,

2451
01:14:09,431 --> 01:14:10,150
you know,

2452
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:10,983
for a normal,

2453
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:12,130
but good enough,

2454
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,020
bad enough that I was
going through a detox.

2455
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:17,350
So I really felt like shit in
the jungle on day four and five.

2456
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:22,420
So we go into the Earth Masada and I'm
really kind of dreading it because I'm

2457
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:24,060
like not feeling good at all,

2458
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:25,970
is a wild ass fucking w.

2459
01:14:25,971 --> 01:14:27,130
Would you call that a pictograph?

2460
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:27,790
What would you call?

2461
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:27,940
Well,

2462
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:28,541
it's actually,

2463
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:31,180
it's actually carved in stone
and that's a relief of it.

2464
01:14:31,181 --> 01:14:31,991
If you want to look,

2465
01:14:31,991 --> 01:14:33,910
you can find the one
that's actually in stone.

2466
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:35,400
Holy Shit.

2467
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:37,090
So there's the one that's
actually carved in stone,

2468
01:14:37,091 --> 01:14:38,290
so that's 4,000 years old.

2469
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:40,810
So those are what Touma
stocks that he has there.

2470
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,360
If you scroll down in his hands,

2471
01:14:43,361 --> 01:14:48,361
see him holding onto those things and
he's transforming into a Jaguar there and

2472
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:53,200
all of these different layers of communion
with snakes coming off it all the way

2473
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:54,400
going all the way up to the sky.

2474
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,091
God Damn,

2475
01:14:55,091 --> 01:14:55,924
that is dope.

2476
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:57,160
That as bad as,

2477
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:57,640
wow,

2478
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:58,750
this is fascinating,

2479
01:14:58,751 --> 01:14:59,584
man.

2480
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:03,330
This is a completely different
branch of the whole psychedelic food.

2481
01:15:03,331 --> 01:15:03,670
Yeah,

2482
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:04,510
absolutely.

2483
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:05,470
Wow.

2484
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:07,570
And it completely under
known because it's,

2485
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:09,370
everybody knows it is San Pedro,

2486
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:13,780
which is this kind of watered down
Catholicized ritual and medicine.

2487
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:17,140
Because I was down there with some
people who had done San Pedro before and

2488
01:15:17,141 --> 01:15:17,710
they're like,

2489
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:17,951
yeah,

2490
01:15:17,951 --> 01:15:18,784
it was pretty cool.

2491
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:19,510
It was cool.

2492
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:20,320
It felt good,

2493
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,180
but this was a fucking
much different ballgame.

2494
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,930
Like the way he prepares it,

2495
01:15:23,931 --> 01:15:25,180
the way the whole ritual is.

2496
01:15:25,181 --> 01:15:26,140
It's totally different game.

2497
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:28,930
I want to meet this dude
who's from Kentucky,

2498
01:15:28,931 --> 01:15:30,430
who lives in the jungle.

2499
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,320
You gotta meet him at cat,

2500
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:33,101
you will meet him.

2501
01:15:33,101 --> 01:15:33,460
He's,

2502
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:33,851
he's,

2503
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:34,600
he's amazing.

2504
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,170
He's awesome.

2505
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:38,380
I just love that there's people like that
out there that are just live in these

2506
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:40,570
very wild lives.

2507
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:45,810
So it's so different than anything
that we have locked into our heads is

2508
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:47,584
acceptable,

2509
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,513
you know?

2510
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:49,280
But it's,

2511
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,460
it's hard to let go of the idea,

2512
01:15:51,461 --> 01:15:51,910
but the,

2513
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:53,860
it really is right there
in front of your face.

2514
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:55,630
It doesn't matter what you do,

2515
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,430
you just do what you want to do.

2516
01:15:57,431 --> 01:16:01,450
Like you should do what you want to do
because we're all just gonna die anyway.

2517
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:03,640
We live and we die.

2518
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:07,120
And just kind of accept
that it's hard as fuck to do

2519
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,730
and in between are just
a bunch of choices.

2520
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:10,720
And that that was,

2521
01:16:10,721 --> 01:16:11,590
now I'm getting to that,

2522
01:16:11,591 --> 01:16:15,670
cause that was one of the key teachings
of this thing is just life is just a

2523
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:16,510
series of choices.

2524
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:16,961
So anyways,

2525
01:16:16,961 --> 01:16:17,590
I go,

2526
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:18,250
I do this,

2527
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:21,400
the Earth Massada medicine
and it's a much smaller cup.

2528
01:16:21,401 --> 01:16:23,950
He looks at me and I'm looking a
little fucking shady at this point.

2529
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:26,110
Don't have that same big smile.

2530
01:16:26,111 --> 01:16:27,280
I managed some kind of smile,

2531
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:31,390
pours me about half as much medicine and
then we're going to take another boat

2532
01:16:31,391 --> 01:16:31,601
ride,

2533
01:16:31,601 --> 01:16:33,850
go to see another tribe out in the deeper,

2534
01:16:33,851 --> 01:16:35,200
in the heart of the jungle.

2535
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:39,430
So I take it and immediately
I'm just nauseous as fuck,

2536
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,320
like nauseous to death.

2537
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:42,940
Not Enough to actually make me Puke,

2538
01:16:42,941 --> 01:16:44,050
but it's just pretty brutal.

2539
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:48,130
So we hop in the boat and
we're cruising down the boat.

2540
01:16:48,131 --> 01:16:50,830
And where I'm sitting in the boat is like,

2541
01:16:50,831 --> 01:16:51,850
I'm getting all this spray.

2542
01:16:51,851 --> 01:16:55,150
It was a windy day and I'm getting a
spray on my face and I'm thinking about

2543
01:16:55,151 --> 01:16:58,750
like monsters inside of me about
the fucking parasites in the Amazon.

2544
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:00,220
I'm nauseous as shit.

2545
01:17:00,221 --> 01:17:01,001
I want to Puke,

2546
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:04,060
but I don't want to puke because I know
if I puke I have to open my mouth and

2547
01:17:04,061 --> 01:17:05,650
then the water's going to get in my mouth.

2548
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,660
And then I thought it was
going to get parasites.

2549
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:10,160
So I'm in this like locked into this hell

2550
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,150
just getting wet.

2551
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:12,230
My eyes locked,

2552
01:17:12,231 --> 01:17:13,400
closed my mouth locked,

2553
01:17:13,401 --> 01:17:13,761
closed,

2554
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:15,080
just nauseous,

2555
01:17:15,081 --> 01:17:17,420
like really nauseous for like 45 minutes.

2556
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,420
And so we arrive in this place and I seem
to be the only one feeling like this,

2557
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,050
everybody else's fucking cracking
jokes and they feel great.

2558
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:26,370
So we arrived at this place and it's,

2559
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:27,700
it's this entry in the young one.

2560
01:17:27,701 --> 01:17:27,951
They're like,

2561
01:17:27,951 --> 01:17:28,341
wow,

2562
01:17:28,341 --> 01:17:28,941
how beautiful.

2563
01:17:28,941 --> 01:17:29,600
And I'm like,

2564
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,590
it's fucking not beautiful.

2565
01:17:30,591 --> 01:17:33,260
I see this Noni tree and
if you ever had noni fruit,

2566
01:17:33,261 --> 01:17:35,420
it's really kind of a nasty fruit.

2567
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:37,550
It's good when they make it
an and health preparation,

2568
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:39,980
but it's all rotting on the
ground and it smells like,

2569
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,230
like a jock strap stuff with cheese.

2570
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:44,370
That's what's sitting out in the sun for,

2571
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:45,500
for eternity,

2572
01:17:45,501 --> 01:17:48,080
just baking and microwaving
over and over again.

2573
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:49,010
I know that smell.

2574
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:50,240
That's a really good,

2575
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,820
that's a really good
description of that smell.

2576
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:53,991
Just kinda like that,

2577
01:17:53,991 --> 01:17:54,320
right?

2578
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,240
Like this funky ball,

2579
01:17:56,241 --> 01:17:57,580
sweaty balls,

2580
01:17:57,581 --> 01:17:58,414
sweat and cheese,

2581
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:01,910
and there's pigs cruising
around and it's hot.

2582
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:03,040
Just sweltering,

2583
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:03,890
fucking hot.

2584
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,180
And there's bugs everywhere.

2585
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:06,560
And I'm just in like this little hell.

2586
01:18:06,561 --> 01:18:07,394
And everybody's like,

2587
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:08,061
well,

2588
01:18:08,061 --> 01:18:08,960
look at the jungle.

2589
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:09,531
I'm like,

2590
01:18:09,531 --> 01:18:10,670
fuck this jungle.

2591
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:12,710
I'm like not feeling it.

2592
01:18:12,711 --> 01:18:12,991
And everybody,

2593
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:16,820
everybody's on this walks were walking
in this tribe [inaudible] and they're in

2594
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:19,640
this kind of Juba and like kind
of like I was the day before.

2595
01:18:19,641 --> 01:18:20,510
But whatever reason,

2596
01:18:20,511 --> 01:18:25,511
I got locked in this bad kind of space
and I realized I had a key realization

2597
01:18:26,091 --> 01:18:27,320
that I was,

2598
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:28,790
I was feeling pain at that point.

2599
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:29,301
I was in pain,

2600
01:18:29,301 --> 01:18:30,290
I was nauseous,

2601
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:31,250
I was unhappy.

2602
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:35,990
And so in my world I was closed off and
I didn't want to give anybody a hug.

2603
01:18:35,991 --> 01:18:37,430
I didn't give a fuck about the jungle.

2604
01:18:37,431 --> 01:18:38,480
I didn't care about the earth.

2605
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:41,810
I was so focused on me
because of my own pain.

2606
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,610
And I realized at that point,

2607
01:18:43,611 --> 01:18:44,840
that's what most of us are like.

2608
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:45,960
We're in some kind of pain.

2609
01:18:45,961 --> 01:18:47,330
Sometimes it's physical pain,

2610
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:49,070
sometimes it's emotional pain,

2611
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:49,681
sometimes it's,

2612
01:18:49,681 --> 01:18:50,514
it's other pain.

2613
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:51,860
And when you're in pain,

2614
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:54,290
it's hard to give a fuck
about anybody but yourself.

2615
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:57,500
Your natural instinct is to
kind of cover up and be like,

2616
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:58,100
you know,

2617
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:58,933
I'm fucking hurting.

2618
01:18:58,940 --> 01:18:59,391
Fuck you.

2619
01:18:59,391 --> 01:18:59,871
Fuck you.

2620
01:18:59,871 --> 01:19:00,231
Fuck you.

2621
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:02,060
So you look at it like
all these youtube comment,

2622
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:06,080
that's a key indicator to me
that those people are in pain.

2623
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:06,410
You know,

2624
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:07,700
that's why they're closed off.

2625
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,490
That's why they're attacking
deep inside somewhere.

2626
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:11,061
You know,

2627
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:12,710
there's some pain undoubtedly,

2628
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:13,573
undoubtedly.

2629
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:18,640
And that pain forces more people to
reject them because that sort of negative

2630
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:23,270
energy that they give off
forces more people to shun them,

2631
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:26,150
which sort of reinforces
their bad opinion of people.

2632
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:26,810
Yep.

2633
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:27,890
And it's in this cycle.

2634
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:32,240
And so while I appreciated that kind
of message I was walking through,

2635
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,590
I was still like fuck this.

2636
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,960
Like I hoped it would be
over when it was got there.

2637
01:19:35,961 --> 01:19:36,391
So we didn't even,

2638
01:19:36,391 --> 01:19:40,430
we get to this clearing in the jungle and
these beautiful tribal people show up,

2639
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:43,910
but I'm just kind of shifting
nervously from side to side,

2640
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:45,350
everybody else's off exploring,

2641
01:19:45,351 --> 01:19:47,920
finding like jungle snail
shells and collecting them,

2642
01:19:47,921 --> 01:19:51,950
adding to their collection and they
bring out this fruit and I'm like too

2643
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,540
paranoid to eat the fruit.

2644
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:55,160
And so all these different opportunities,

2645
01:19:55,161 --> 01:19:57,440
these choices come like they
bring out these jungle pairs.

2646
01:19:58,250 --> 01:19:58,551
Right.

2647
01:19:58,551 --> 01:20:01,710
And it's just like weird thing
that I've never had half an hour,

2648
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:02,600
half like an apple,

2649
01:20:02,601 --> 01:20:06,830
half like a pear and everybody's
like orgasming over this thing.

2650
01:20:06,831 --> 01:20:07,561
But thinking like,

2651
01:20:07,561 --> 01:20:08,310
what do they wash

2652
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:09,143
this with?

2653
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:10,530
Like what's going on?

2654
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:11,461
So I,

2655
01:20:11,461 --> 01:20:15,000
I like nibbled like a piece that I
thought was safe and like didn't touch it,

2656
01:20:15,001 --> 01:20:15,241
you know?

2657
01:20:15,241 --> 01:20:18,510
And so that was like one choice and
it made me not eating that I felt even

2658
01:20:18,511 --> 01:20:18,871
worse.

2659
01:20:18,871 --> 01:20:20,100
Like I felt more isolated.

2660
01:20:20,101 --> 01:20:21,660
I felt more different than everybody.

2661
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:22,200
I was like,

2662
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,280
I'm a fucking Weirdo.

2663
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:24,360
Everybody's feeling great.

2664
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,290
And so I started to get more and more
isolated and different things would come

2665
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:31,970
up and an opportunity to
walk in here and you know,

2666
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,420
experience this part of the forest.

2667
01:20:33,421 --> 01:20:33,631
I was like,

2668
01:20:33,631 --> 01:20:34,081
fuck that.

2669
01:20:34,081 --> 01:20:34,741
There's probably bugs.

2670
01:20:34,741 --> 01:20:38,400
They're so locked in this plate and
I just got worse and worse and worse.

2671
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:41,700
And it was like the universe was
providing me these opportunities to do

2672
01:20:41,701 --> 01:20:46,701
something and I kept failing to pass the
test to finally I see this tree that is

2673
01:20:46,831 --> 01:20:47,530
pretty,

2674
01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:48,060
you know,

2675
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,920
looked pretty good for
climbing and I'm like,

2676
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:53,040
I'm going to climb this tree and
I'm thinking about it forever.

2677
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:53,461
And I was like,

2678
01:20:53,461 --> 01:20:54,300
how am I going to get up there?

2679
01:20:54,301 --> 01:20:54,601
I'm still,

2680
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:58,050
I'm pretty blasted and I see a big
spider in the nook of the tree,

2681
01:20:58,051 --> 01:20:59,460
which is going to be my original path.

2682
01:20:59,490 --> 01:20:59,731
I'm like,

2683
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:01,320
Oh fuck it just fucking spider up there.

2684
01:21:01,321 --> 01:21:02,850
I'm not going to be able to climate.

2685
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:04,740
But then I realized at
that point I was like,

2686
01:21:04,741 --> 01:21:05,100
all right,

2687
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:05,881
this is a test.

2688
01:21:05,881 --> 01:21:07,080
I really want to climb this tree.

2689
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:08,280
I can fucking figure it out.

2690
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:09,330
The spiders not going to bite me.

2691
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:14,490
And so I figured out an
easy is just super easy.

2692
01:21:14,491 --> 01:21:17,100
I just like hop a few branches
and I get up in the tree.

2693
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:20,100
And then for the first time
that in that whole session,

2694
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:20,943
the whole ceremony,

2695
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,890
I felt like I passed a little test.

2696
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,380
Like I did something that
I was supposed to do.

2697
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:28,560
I made a choice that would
lead to my happiness.

2698
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,030
So I started to feel a little bit better,

2699
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:35,390
but then we go back up to the tribe and
they start dancing around and you know,

2700
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,910
I really had this strong urge to take my
shoes off and just kind of dance around

2701
01:21:38,911 --> 01:21:42,030
because I had these big hiking
shoes are all muddy and stuff and,

2702
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,830
but I didn't do it cause I was
worried about the mosquitoes.

2703
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:44,760
Well little did I know.

2704
01:21:44,761 --> 01:21:47,280
I found out later that mosquitoes were
fucking biting me through my shoes

2705
01:21:47,281 --> 01:21:48,060
anyways,

2706
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:51,150
so I might as well three shoot
through the webbing and my shoes.

2707
01:21:51,151 --> 01:21:53,190
He's lit me up through my shoes.

2708
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:57,120
So I would have been better off taking
my shoes off and dancing around in the

2709
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:58,170
mud anyways.

2710
01:21:58,860 --> 01:21:59,331
But anyways,

2711
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:00,120
it's failed.

2712
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,740
Failed that test again.

2713
01:22:01,810 --> 01:22:02,910
So I,

2714
01:22:02,911 --> 01:22:03,810
but I kind of get the,

2715
01:22:03,811 --> 01:22:04,830
get the game like,

2716
01:22:04,831 --> 01:22:05,161
all right,

2717
01:22:05,161 --> 01:22:05,640
I get it.

2718
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:06,720
You're presented with tests.

2719
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:09,720
You can either pass them or fail in
life is kind of a series of choices.

2720
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:12,270
But I'm happy when we're
leaving the jungle.

2721
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:12,840
I'm like,

2722
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,130
thank God we're getting out of here.

2723
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:17,850
I just basically took a beating from
my own mind the whole time I was there.

2724
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,650
And as it was in doing that,

2725
01:22:19,651 --> 01:22:23,370
it was one of the most challenging times
I've ever worked with the medicine.

2726
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:24,780
Because you know,

2727
01:22:24,781 --> 01:22:25,501
even at Boga,

2728
01:22:25,501 --> 01:22:26,880
which feels like hell,

2729
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:28,110
I mean it's literal hell,

2730
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:32,130
all you really are doing is just
completely surrendering to that hell.

2731
01:22:32,131 --> 01:22:33,210
You just lie on your back.

2732
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:34,890
Like okay hell come on.

2733
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,700
This one is such an active medicine that
you're presented with these challenges

2734
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,300
and ask to do things in
a much more active way,

2735
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,100
which is great.

2736
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:46,050
But if you start getting
on the wrong side of it,

2737
01:22:46,051 --> 01:22:47,520
it can be really challenging cause you,

2738
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:48,600
you have nothing to,

2739
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:49,590
you know,

2740
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:53,490
stop your mind from really running rampage
other than just this kind of gentle

2741
01:22:53,491 --> 01:22:54,324
guidance.

2742
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:57,840
So tough experience in
the heart of the jungle.

2743
01:22:57,841 --> 01:22:58,920
When we get to the canoe,

2744
01:22:58,921 --> 01:23:01,800
I'm starting to feel a little better at
least passed one test and I climbed the

2745
01:23:01,801 --> 01:23:02,041
tree.

2746
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:02,431
So I was like,

2747
01:23:02,431 --> 01:23:03,360
well at least I did that,

2748
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:04,350
you know.

2749
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:06,040
So we get there and

2750
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,431
again,

2751
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:08,680
it starts to be dusk and
that's when the vision start.

2752
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:09,663
And um,

2753
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,030
then that was probably
where I got my most,

2754
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:13,870
uh,

2755
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:15,310
one of my most powerful visions.

2756
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:19,660
So I closed my eyes and I just bury
my hands and my head in my hands.

2757
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:21,580
And um,

2758
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,960
immediately I see this demonic face that
was made up of fires that were burning

2759
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,230
and it's demonic face full of fires.

2760
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:32,320
And then I noticed that it's plastics
that are burning in the fires.

2761
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,030
And I looked at,

2762
01:23:34,031 --> 01:23:34,301
I'm like,

2763
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,134
Oh shit.

2764
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:40,990
And then I see that laid out on the
skin of what feels like a woman.

2765
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:44,260
And it didn't have all the,

2766
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:45,041
all the features,

2767
01:23:45,041 --> 01:23:49,120
but I could see like the
jungle was this woman's

2768
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:52,060
pubic Bush,

2769
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:52,500
you know,

2770
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:57,500
like it was life coming out of her armpits
in and her vagina was all this like

2771
01:23:58,031 --> 01:23:58,571
jungle.

2772
01:23:58,571 --> 01:24:02,500
And in her hair was the desert and
her skin was like the planes and the

2773
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:03,730
different things or the mountains.

2774
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:05,230
And I got this real feeling of,

2775
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:05,981
all right,

2776
01:24:05,981 --> 01:24:06,701
I guess I get it.

2777
01:24:06,701 --> 01:24:07,930
I'm looking at the earth mother.

2778
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:13,290
But then the fires were burning all
over her skin and there was oil that was

2779
01:24:13,751 --> 01:24:14,890
being drawn out,

2780
01:24:14,891 --> 01:24:15,520
like,

2781
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,560
like someone was taking big syringes,

2782
01:24:17,561 --> 01:24:22,561
like a malevolent doctor was pulling oil
out of her skin and then adding it more

2783
01:24:22,721 --> 01:24:24,400
to the fire and the fire's kept burning.

2784
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:25,740
And it was this kind of,

2785
01:24:25,741 --> 01:24:28,060
this horrific image of this,

2786
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:29,020
you know,

2787
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:33,650
almost rape of this beautiful mother
earth that was presented it to.

2788
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:36,490
And so I couldn't really shake it.

2789
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:36,860
And I'm,

2790
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:37,750
and I'm looking and I'm,

2791
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:38,821
I,

2792
01:24:38,821 --> 01:24:38,950
you know,

2793
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:40,690
I start to tear up a little bit and I say,

2794
01:24:40,691 --> 01:24:41,140
you know,

2795
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:41,540
fuck,

2796
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:41,831
I mean,

2797
01:24:41,831 --> 01:24:42,581
how can I help?

2798
01:24:42,581 --> 01:24:43,151
What can I do?

2799
01:24:43,151 --> 01:24:43,984
What can I do?

2800
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,400
And then again,

2801
01:24:45,401 --> 01:24:46,570
just like with the altar,

2802
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:51,490
like a really clear voice comes
and answers me and she says,

2803
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:53,770
we don't have an environmental problem.

2804
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:55,210
We have a consciousness problem.

2805
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:59,320
It's like you work on the consciousness
and I'll take care of the rest.

2806
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,180
And the way she said,

2807
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:02,620
I'll take care of the rest.

2808
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:06,880
I'll never forget that because
it had such fucking strength.

2809
01:25:06,881 --> 01:25:07,714
Like,

2810
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:08,500
you know,

2811
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:09,070
please like,

2812
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:10,960
do your best work on the consciousness.

2813
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,000
But don't worry about the other shit.

2814
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,520
I'm going to protect myself
one way or the other.

2815
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:16,660
Wow.

2816
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:18,250
Kind of a really powerful moment.

2817
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:23,251
And then what I saw there is what she
showed me or what I saw was people,

2818
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:23,590
you know,

2819
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:26,470
I would touch somebody and there was a
bunch of people and they would just be

2820
01:25:26,471 --> 01:25:28,210
kind of running around all haphazard like,

2821
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,140
Eh,

2822
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:31,960
I kind of just doing these
robotic motions in circles,

2823
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:34,360
like a windup toy that was just haywire.

2824
01:25:34,361 --> 01:25:35,710
There was off balance or something.

2825
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,200
Then I would reach out and touch,

2826
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:41,020
touch one of these people and a
light would turn on in their head.

2827
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:43,240
And instead of being
moving around randomly,

2828
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:46,870
they would just stop and then look around
and then they would touch another one

2829
01:25:46,871 --> 01:25:50,560
of these wind up humans and
they would stop and look around.

2830
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:53,470
And then slowly it started to connect.

2831
01:25:53,471 --> 01:25:56,560
And what it was showing was
the spread of consciousness.

2832
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:56,891
You know,

2833
01:25:56,891 --> 01:26:01,420
you turn one person who's just locked
in their own fears and pains and worries

2834
01:26:01,421 --> 01:26:03,870
and the patterns and you know,

2835
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:07,820
help show them consciousness and then
they'll do the same to somebody else.

2836
01:26:07,821 --> 01:26:11,690
And that's how this problem is going to
be solved and then all around the world

2837
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:15,950
that just kind of all of these lights
started going off in people's heads and

2838
01:26:15,951 --> 01:26:20,951
connected and I got this image of the
utopia that the world could be where we

2839
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:23,000
essentially in humans,

2840
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:23,751
you know,

2841
01:26:23,751 --> 01:26:25,340
kind of aligned through consciousness,

2842
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:26,660
are working,

2843
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:27,291
you know,

2844
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:29,630
to help prolong life
for as long as possible.

2845
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,400
It's going to take a little time,

2846
01:26:31,401 --> 01:26:34,940
but I think within probably the next 20
years we're going to see a completely

2847
01:26:34,941 --> 01:26:36,380
different version of culture.

2848
01:26:36,570 --> 01:26:36,920
Yeah,

2849
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:37,850
I really believe that.

2850
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:41,030
I think that's that wave of touching
people and spreading it out.

2851
01:26:41,031 --> 01:26:41,810
It's already happened.

2852
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:42,200
Yeah,

2853
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:42,890
I see it.

2854
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:43,670
I feel it.

2855
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:47,600
It's online and it's moving in a way
that's just never had an opportunity to

2856
01:26:47,601 --> 01:26:48,620
move like this before.

2857
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:53,620
The ideas that got passed word to mouth
by fucking hippies and poets and the

2858
01:26:53,631 --> 01:26:56,540
beat players of the 1960s the what?

2859
01:26:56,541 --> 01:26:58,520
They were so terrified
of what they squashed.

2860
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:00,650
You know the acid and marijuana movement,

2861
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:01,850
what they squashed?

2862
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:03,890
They didn't have a way
of communicating back.

2863
01:27:03,891 --> 01:27:04,490
No,

2864
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:05,930
they didn't have this fucking thing.

2865
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,750
This is the craziest shit of all time.

2866
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:09,291
This,

2867
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:14,291
this Internet in conjunction with this
new found awareness of the psychedelic

2868
01:27:14,631 --> 01:27:19,160
experiences and the lessons that can be
learned from these psychedelic states

2869
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:20,240
with it's,

2870
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:24,650
there's a wave of a change
in consciousness that I've
personally experienced.

2871
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,090
I know that it's not,

2872
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:27,590
it's not an imaginary thing.

2873
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:28,120
It's,

2874
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:28,280
I mean,

2875
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:28,401
yeah,

2876
01:27:28,401 --> 01:27:29,600
there's people that are holding back.

2877
01:27:29,601 --> 01:27:33,710
There's people just still still
still angry or still critical,

2878
01:27:33,711 --> 01:27:35,870
are still scared and you know,

2879
01:27:35,871 --> 01:27:37,070
I kind of feel for them.

2880
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,770
You're not realizing what's going on here.

2881
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:42,110
Like you can be pessimistic.

2882
01:27:42,111 --> 01:27:42,980
You can be,

2883
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:44,451
you know,

2884
01:27:44,451 --> 01:27:47,930
you can get it into your head if you
really choose to that the world is this

2885
01:27:47,931 --> 01:27:52,931
terrible place of awful people and it's
more likely that there's just a momentum

2886
01:27:54,381 --> 01:27:58,070
going on that was created by people who
didn't know what the fuck was going on.

2887
01:27:58,071 --> 01:27:58,904
And we're awake.

2888
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:03,170
We woke up like we're on a spaceship
that's headed towards an asteroid or

2889
01:28:03,171 --> 01:28:04,280
something and woke up going,

2890
01:28:04,281 --> 01:28:04,551
okay,

2891
01:28:04,551 --> 01:28:05,384
who's flying it?

2892
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:06,540
How are you guys flying?

2893
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:07,470
You're not flying.

2894
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:07,870
Okay.

2895
01:28:07,870 --> 01:28:08,340
Um,

2896
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:09,450
how much food do we have?

2897
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:10,800
How much gas is in this fucking,

2898
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:11,140
yeah,

2899
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:11,670
totally.

2900
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:12,780
Can we turn this thing around?

2901
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:14,160
Where's the brakes?

2902
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:14,993
How does it,

2903
01:28:15,150 --> 01:28:16,560
why are we moving in this direction?

2904
01:28:16,561 --> 01:28:18,120
Is there a reason we're
moving this direction?

2905
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:19,260
Has Anybody thought this through it?

2906
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:20,753
Especially

2907
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:21,870
when you consider,

2908
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:26,100
I mean the Republican right wing side,

2909
01:28:26,101 --> 01:28:27,750
like there was a very
interesting thing recently.

2910
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,670
Bill Nye the science guy.

2911
01:28:29,790 --> 01:28:34,790
He's just a brilliant public speaker
when it comes to defending science was on

2912
01:28:35,221 --> 01:28:37,260
the show and on the show.

2913
01:28:37,261 --> 01:28:38,094
Um,

2914
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:39,700
he got called uh,

2915
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:40,730
uh,

2916
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:41,563
uh,

2917
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:41,850
uh,

2918
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:43,650
science bully or something like that.

2919
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:46,530
Or they were talking about
science bullying because,

2920
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:46,950
uh,

2921
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:51,950
they were talking about him talking about
global warming being affected by human

2922
01:28:53,371 --> 01:28:54,030
beings,

2923
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:58,110
that it's pretty much a general consensus
of scientists that human activity and

2924
01:28:58,111 --> 01:29:01,200
the carbon footprint of human
beings has affected global.

2925
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,660
And then the other guy was like,

2926
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:03,931
well,

2927
01:29:03,931 --> 01:29:04,770
first of all,

2928
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,150
I think his attitude was like,

2929
01:29:06,151 --> 01:29:08,220
we don't know exactly what it's doing.

2930
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:09,240
And you,

2931
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:12,420
what you're saying like these
regulations could harm business.

2932
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:18,980
Like that guy for sure
doesn't do mushrooms because
if he had ever done Russia

2933
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:20,341
mushrooms,

2934
01:29:20,341 --> 01:29:21,450
he would realize like that is,

2935
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:24,570
you just said a crazy thing you just said,

2936
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:27,900
we need to make money so we'll keep
poisoning the earth to make money.

2937
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:28,230
I mean,

2938
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:29,730
I know you didn't say it that way,

2939
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:31,620
but that's essentially the equals.

2940
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:31,951
You know,

2941
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:34,290
if you put them in a
mathematical computation,

2942
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:38,370
what you're saying is even if
it does poison the atmosphere,

2943
01:29:38,371 --> 01:29:40,940
we need it because we
need the jobs and your,

2944
01:29:40,941 --> 01:29:45,941
your considerations of the idea that
regulating something that's poisoning the

2945
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:46,711
earth.

2946
01:29:46,711 --> 01:29:47,730
We live on that.

2947
01:29:47,731 --> 01:29:51,750
That could be somehow controversial
because that poisoning is profitable,

2948
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:55,230
not we need to find other things that
are profitable of substitute it like,

2949
01:29:55,231 --> 01:29:55,501
yes,

2950
01:29:55,501 --> 01:29:56,820
this is obviously
something we need to stop.

2951
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:57,960
We need to find a substitution.

2952
01:29:57,980 --> 01:29:58,111
No,

2953
01:29:58,111 --> 01:29:58,301
no,

2954
01:29:58,301 --> 01:29:58,341
no,

2955
01:29:58,341 --> 01:29:58,980
no.

2956
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:01,110
You could be harming business.

2957
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:07,010
That same mine that can put together
that screen that's showing you the HD

2958
01:30:08,011 --> 01:30:10,590
version of those people having
that ridiculous argument,

2959
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:14,400
that same technology
that that technology is,

2960
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:16,170
there is a reason to figure it out.

2961
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:21,380
They wanted and needed a reason to
figure out how to make this gigantic LCD

2962
01:30:21,481 --> 01:30:26,280
screen with an incredible resolution
and just vibrant crystal clear colors.

2963
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:27,930
They wanted to figure out how to do that.

2964
01:30:27,931 --> 01:30:31,740
If they wanted to figure out how to get
rid of the garbage that's in the ocean,

2965
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:35,850
that giant patch of swirling
deteriorating garbage.

2966
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:39,960
If there was like an incredible
amount of of need to do that,

2967
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:45,140
if people decided to focus all of their
scientific aspirations on fixing all the

2968
01:30:45,361 --> 01:30:48,240
problems on earth in a profitable manner,

2969
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,670
it would be the biggest
industry of all time.

2970
01:30:50,671 --> 01:30:51,600
It would be giant.

2971
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:55,470
We would run out of polluted
places because he'd be like,

2972
01:30:55,471 --> 01:30:55,861
shit,

2973
01:30:55,861 --> 01:30:59,850
we used up all the polluted place because
we figured out some new awesome shit

2974
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,640
that turns pollution into clean air.

2975
01:31:02,641 --> 01:31:04,050
That gives you enlightenment.

2976
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:07,830
We found some new air that'll let you
read each other's minds and that you,

2977
01:31:07,831 --> 01:31:12,780
you make it by burning out nuclear
fuel rods and some sort of a high genic

2978
01:31:12,781 --> 01:31:14,910
process with a dirty ocean.

2979
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:16,520
Water purifies the ocean.

2980
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:16,741
I mean,

2981
01:31:16,741 --> 01:31:17,880
they would come up with something.

2982
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:21,660
Some fucking super egghead would come
up with some awesome shit and they would

2983
01:31:21,661 --> 01:31:22,494
figure it out.

2984
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:25,470
The key is just the
consciousness has to come first.

2985
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:26,011
Exactly.

2986
01:31:26,011 --> 01:31:27,900
Human Innovation is insane.

2987
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:31,110
We send video through the sky.

2988
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,160
Okay.

2989
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:36,390
We were fucking sending pictures
to each other on a regular basis.

2990
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:36,841
You know,

2991
01:31:36,841 --> 01:31:38,190
you can call him Dick Pics,

2992
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:39,780
but what that is is magic.

2993
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,820
That shit is fucking magic.

2994
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:46,020
Sending Magic to each other and
that and that could figure it out.

2995
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:46,890
Ultimately,

2996
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,600
that is one of the thing.

2997
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:51,750
That's the one thing that humans can do
that dolphins couldn't do or any other

2998
01:31:51,751 --> 01:31:53,250
of these creatures can't do on earth.

2999
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:57,270
Let's say something fucked up was going
to happen to earth like we saw a big

3000
01:31:57,271 --> 01:32:00,010
asteroid coming in 25 Oh god,

3001
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:04,810
it's humans who could figure some
shit out to like that fucking movie

3002
01:32:04,811 --> 01:32:05,770
Armageddon.

3003
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,820
Blow that thing up.

3004
01:32:06,821 --> 01:32:07,570
Split it into,

3005
01:32:07,570 --> 01:32:08,040
I dunno.

3006
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:09,130
Do you materialize it?

3007
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,570
Whatever the fuck it happened.

3008
01:32:10,571 --> 01:32:11,520
Like we have machine.

3009
01:32:11,550 --> 01:32:11,890
Yeah.

3010
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:14,170
Just keep going back in time
to five minutes before it hits.

3011
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:19,620
We have the opportunity potentially to
use technology to protect the earth and

3012
01:32:19,631 --> 01:32:20,560
humanity at large.

3013
01:32:20,561 --> 01:32:24,190
And that's what I think all of
this whole technological thing,

3014
01:32:24,191 --> 01:32:25,990
why it's good and why it's necessary.

3015
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,900
Otherwise we're just completely at
the mercy to these other forces.

3016
01:32:28,901 --> 01:32:31,240
I think the problem is,

3017
01:32:31,241 --> 01:32:32,890
is that as Albert Einstein said,

3018
01:32:32,891 --> 01:32:37,060
it's become appallingly obvious that our
technology has exceeded our humanity.

3019
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,640
Like both of those things were
supposed to ride together,

3020
01:32:39,641 --> 01:32:40,780
like homeboys,

3021
01:32:40,781 --> 01:32:41,051
you know,

3022
01:32:41,051 --> 01:32:42,730
a motorcycle and a fucking Sidecar,

3023
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:43,211
you know,

3024
01:32:43,211 --> 01:32:44,350
both of them right together.

3025
01:32:44,351 --> 01:32:47,500
And that shit got split off
by these oppressive forces,

3026
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:47,951
you know,

3027
01:32:47,951 --> 01:32:48,784
state,

3028
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:49,001
uh,

3029
01:32:49,001 --> 01:32:53,770
state forces and religious forces that
have kind of gone through and kicked out

3030
01:32:53,771 --> 01:32:55,180
any of these knowledge centers,

3031
01:32:55,300 --> 01:33:00,300
made illegal any of these knowledge plants
and reinforce this crazy idea putting

3032
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:03,400
business above something like the earth.

3033
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:05,100
That is absolutely,

3034
01:33:05,130 --> 01:33:06,240
totally possible.

3035
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:07,680
But there's other options too.

3036
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:10,830
And one of the weirdest ones to me is,

3037
01:33:10,831 --> 01:33:11,250
um,

3038
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:16,250
that this all has to be in place in
order to move forward with this process.

3039
01:33:18,061 --> 01:33:18,930
It's going on right now.

3040
01:33:18,931 --> 01:33:23,931
This a process with people connecting
with technology that these all these

3041
01:33:24,091 --> 01:33:24,924
forces,

3042
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:26,370
they seem to be moving.

3043
01:33:26,371 --> 01:33:27,121
I mean when you,

3044
01:33:27,121 --> 01:33:28,470
when you move warfare,

3045
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:31,500
what you move is extreme
versions of technology.

3046
01:33:31,501 --> 01:33:32,550
That's the most important thing.

3047
01:33:32,551 --> 01:33:34,290
Like that was a biggest
part of the space race.

3048
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:35,160
People said,

3049
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:35,281
oh,

3050
01:33:35,281 --> 01:33:36,540
they put so much money into that.

3051
01:33:36,541 --> 01:33:37,710
That was an unnecessary,

3052
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:40,110
do you know much military like how much,

3053
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:43,710
how many options they got that they
didn't have before because of the space

3054
01:33:43,711 --> 01:33:44,544
race.

3055
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:47,250
Just the innovation of
materials and the rockets.

3056
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:51,540
Richer understanding of what they can get
away with flying things into orbit and

3057
01:33:51,541 --> 01:33:52,374
shit,

3058
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:54,120
that's never going to stop,

3059
01:33:54,121 --> 01:33:54,780
man.

3060
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:56,040
That's not going to stop.

3061
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:56,671
It just,

3062
01:33:56,671 --> 01:34:01,671
it is what people do and sometimes people
need a a push to do it and along the

3063
01:34:01,921 --> 01:34:06,921
way they have to do battle with evil
and along the way they have to do battle

3064
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:07,921
with suppression.

3065
01:34:07,921 --> 01:34:08,611
Like for the,

3066
01:34:08,611 --> 01:34:13,560
the gay people to get married in 2014 to
cheering throngs makes it all the more

3067
01:34:13,561 --> 01:34:15,780
sweets because it was
rejected for so long.

3068
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:18,090
And I'm not saying there's
anything good about that rejection.

3069
01:34:18,091 --> 01:34:18,930
There's certainly not,

3070
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:24,230
but I almost think that it all has to be
there like that and that we're in this

3071
01:34:24,241 --> 01:34:26,160
process of becoming something different.

3072
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:29,190
We're learning about the
flaws of staying what we are,

3073
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:32,310
that this relying entirely on the flesh,

3074
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:37,970
relying entirely on these animal
instincts that we may or may not think are

3075
01:34:38,011 --> 01:34:38,970
beneficial.

3076
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:40,620
We have this connection with them.

3077
01:34:40,621 --> 01:34:41,790
We don't want to separate,

3078
01:34:41,791 --> 01:34:43,440
we don't want to separate from jealousy.

3079
01:34:43,710 --> 01:34:45,130
We don't want to separate from emotion.

3080
01:34:45,210 --> 01:34:47,940
We don't want to be a
fucking computer program,

3081
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,040
but that might be inevitable.

3082
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:53,790
What we call technology
might be a life form.

3083
01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:58,010
It might be a life form that we're
giving birth to that we are some weird

3084
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,990
worm that becomes a butterfly,

3085
01:34:59,991 --> 01:35:02,340
but we don't know it yet
and so we're just push,

3086
01:35:02,341 --> 01:35:02,641
push,

3087
01:35:02,641 --> 01:35:03,061
push and,

3088
01:35:03,061 --> 01:35:06,110
and we're full gay marriage
and pollute the air.

3089
01:35:06,111 --> 01:35:09,710
We're lightened plastic on fire and
steel and copper pipes out of abandoned

3090
01:35:09,711 --> 01:35:10,544
buildings.

3091
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:14,360
I mean were the weirdest fucking thing
that's ever existed ever at all along the

3092
01:35:14,361 --> 01:35:14,930
way.

3093
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:19,700
We're working on technology all along
the way where you could take the dumbest

3094
01:35:19,701 --> 01:35:23,360
motherfucker out there and he's
holding onto a Samsung galaxy s five,

3095
01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:24,920
you know,

3096
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:29,480
we all along the way we're were giving
birth to artificial intelligence.

3097
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:32,540
I really like your idea of
needing that resistance,

3098
01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:32,991
you know?

3099
01:35:32,991 --> 01:35:33,151
And,

3100
01:35:33,151 --> 01:35:35,120
and I think that's a great,

3101
01:35:35,121 --> 01:35:36,470
great wisdom in that.

3102
01:35:36,471 --> 01:35:40,730
And that the fact that things may be
are exactly as they're supposed to be,

3103
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:41,181
you know,

3104
01:35:41,181 --> 01:35:42,650
at times I think they are.

3105
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:43,070
Yeah.

3106
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:43,551
And that's a,

3107
01:35:43,551 --> 01:35:45,140
that's definitely a cool thought.

3108
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:48,740
And then the other thing about technology
is the point that I try to make as

3109
01:35:48,741 --> 01:35:49,890
often as possible is,

3110
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:50,810
um,

3111
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:51,740
these medicines,

3112
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,420
that's exactly what the fuck they are,

3113
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:54,560
is their technology.

3114
01:35:54,561 --> 01:35:54,890
Yeah.

3115
01:35:54,890 --> 01:35:55,581
So it's alcohol.

3116
01:35:55,581 --> 01:35:56,460
That's technology too.

3117
01:35:57,010 --> 01:35:57,320
You know,

3118
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:57,940
like all,

3119
01:35:57,940 --> 01:35:58,400
every,

3120
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,170
every one of these things is a technology.

3121
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:00,370
Yeah.

3122
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:01,430
Alcoholics causes,

3123
01:36:01,431 --> 01:36:03,410
it's kind of what somebody
figured some stuff out.

3124
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,900
Shot of whiskey equals
this broken down for you.

3125
01:36:05,901 --> 01:36:06,800
Really simply.

3126
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,560
It's right there in front
of him for people to people.

3127
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:14,630
You have all these labels and memes and
ideas and the propaganda and bullshit

3128
01:36:14,631 --> 01:36:15,370
that goes to it.

3129
01:36:15,370 --> 01:36:17,060
Just look at everything is technology.

3130
01:36:17,061 --> 01:36:18,200
Alcohol is a technology,

3131
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:20,120
methamphetamines or a technology watch,

3132
01:36:20,121 --> 01:36:20,421
humans,

3133
01:36:20,421 --> 01:36:21,254
the technology.

3134
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:24,020
But what can that
technology reproducibly get?

3135
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:24,860
Well,

3136
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:25,321
with Meth,

3137
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:27,450
it can get you to clean
your fucking house and see,

3138
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:31,160
see fucking goblins and freak
out and become a stripper.

3139
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:33,080
So that's reproducible on meth.

3140
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:35,570
Like what's reproducible on what Juma,

3141
01:36:35,571 --> 01:36:36,800
what's reproducible on Iowa.

3142
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:42,200
And you start to see patterns of how
this technology can be utilized and just

3143
01:36:42,201 --> 01:36:43,820
taking an objective look at that.

3144
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:44,350
Yeah.

3145
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:45,260
It's not a panacea.

3146
01:36:45,261 --> 01:36:47,030
It's not going to do
everything for everybody.

3147
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:47,720
Nothing is,

3148
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,261
nothing is,

3149
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:49,220
it's just a technology.

3150
01:36:49,221 --> 01:36:49,911
It's like a phone.

3151
01:36:49,911 --> 01:36:53,810
You can call somebody a bitch on the phone
or you can tell him that you love him

3152
01:36:53,811 --> 01:36:55,520
and that you'll be there
by the side forever.

3153
01:36:55,521 --> 01:36:57,230
Like it's just fucking technology.

3154
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:57,620
Yeah.

3155
01:36:57,620 --> 01:36:59,600
It's just a means to communicate with.

3156
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:00,140
Yeah.

3157
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:00,470
Yeah.

3158
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:01,430
That's so true.

3159
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:05,630
And that these ideas or this idea of,

3160
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:06,513
uh,

3161
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:11,300
an infield gin or what we would call
a drug being a technology and being a

3162
01:37:11,301 --> 01:37:12,070
method of,

3163
01:37:12,070 --> 01:37:17,060
of enlightening or a method of
opening yourself up to a whole new,

3164
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:21,350
whole new dimension of possibility.

3165
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:26,440
Like just a world that you step into
it and now your values have changed.

3166
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:26,991
Like you're a,

3167
01:37:26,991 --> 01:37:28,280
you're a different person,

3168
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:29,780
your values,

3169
01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:32,120
your ideas of human beings in general,

3170
01:37:32,121 --> 01:37:35,110
all those change and they change
in this really drastic way.

3171
01:37:35,190 --> 01:37:36,380
It's kind of unavoidable.

3172
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:37,220
You know,

3173
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:37,820
you just,

3174
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:40,080
even if you become a dick
and you get mad at that,

3175
01:37:40,081 --> 01:37:41,330
mosquitoes are stinging in your feet.

3176
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:42,260
You're still,

3177
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:42,561
you know,

3178
01:37:42,561 --> 01:37:42,950
you're,

3179
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:47,360
you're well who you are is not who you
would have been in those same exact

3180
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:49,730
frustrating circumstances three years ago,

3181
01:37:49,731 --> 01:37:50,481
four years ago,

3182
01:37:50,481 --> 01:37:51,314
five years ago,

3183
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:53,180
nor will I ever be again.

3184
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:54,020
I think it was on,

3185
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:54,201
you know,

3186
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:56,400
when you came on my podcast
that I said that quote,

3187
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:57,031
no,

3188
01:37:57,031 --> 01:37:59,730
no man ever stepped into
the same river twice for,

3189
01:37:59,731 --> 01:38:02,040
he's not the same man and
it's not the same river,

3190
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:02,791
you know?

3191
01:38:02,791 --> 01:38:02,971
And,

3192
01:38:02,971 --> 01:38:06,690
and that's the case with these
psychedelic experiences even more so.

3193
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,021
You know,

3194
01:38:07,021 --> 01:38:09,210
it's because who you
come there in general,

3195
01:38:09,211 --> 01:38:11,160
that metaphor works is
we're always changing.

3196
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:12,660
Situation's always changing.

3197
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:16,200
But you go through one of these ceremonies
and you just have this overwhelming

3198
01:38:16,201 --> 01:38:20,760
feeling that the person that you were
prior to doing it is not the person that

3199
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:23,280
you've become nor the
person that you will be.

3200
01:38:23,281 --> 01:38:23,521
I mean,

3201
01:38:23,521 --> 01:38:24,960
that's going to continue to change.

3202
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:25,760
Um,

3203
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,040
but,

3204
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:30,300
but things shift in a really dramatic
way that can be incredibly powerfully

3205
01:38:30,301 --> 01:38:30,930
positive.

3206
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:31,261
Yeah.

3207
01:38:31,261 --> 01:38:32,730
And I think that the word is out.

3208
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:38,340
People are telling people now it's
starting to spread back and forth.

3209
01:38:38,590 --> 01:38:38,841
I mean,

3210
01:38:38,841 --> 01:38:40,320
it's not just stories in the Internet.

3211
01:38:40,321 --> 01:38:43,350
I'm hearing people tell
their friends and you know,

3212
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:43,621
hey,

3213
01:38:43,621 --> 01:38:45,650
we got together and we
did this and you know,

3214
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:46,590
it changed my life.

3215
01:38:46,591 --> 01:38:46,861
And I mean,

3216
01:38:46,861 --> 01:38:49,740
I mean I hear it all the regular bank
and it's reaching different areas.

3217
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:51,900
I was hanging out with
the Chicago Blackhawks,

3218
01:38:51,901 --> 01:38:52,734
the hockey team,

3219
01:38:52,890 --> 01:38:55,580
and these are hockey players
are from Canada and farm towns.

3220
01:38:55,581 --> 01:38:59,220
They'd been bashing each other and the
boards and skating around on the ice,

3221
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:00,720
not the people you'd expect.

3222
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,490
Who'd ever even heard the word Iowasca.

3223
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:05,730
But somehow it got in the conversation
that I'd done a bunch of Iowasca

3224
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:08,160
experiences and you'd
have these guys like,

3225
01:39:08,190 --> 01:39:08,521
oh,

3226
01:39:08,521 --> 01:39:09,480
I heard about that.

3227
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:10,650
That sounds awesome.

3228
01:39:10,651 --> 01:39:11,880
I really want to go do that.

3229
01:39:12,090 --> 01:39:12,810
And you're like,

3230
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:13,500
what the fuck?

3231
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:15,000
How do you even know about this?

3232
01:39:15,001 --> 01:39:17,490
So it's reaching this
kind of critical mass,

3233
01:39:17,491 --> 01:39:18,510
which is really exciting.

3234
01:39:18,511 --> 01:39:18,840
Huge.

3235
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:20,280
In the MMA world.

3236
01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:20,910
Yeah.

3237
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:23,490
I know a dude who's a
shaman who's a trainer.

3238
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:24,630
Yeah.

3239
01:39:24,630 --> 01:39:26,130
I don't think he wants to meet him.

3240
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:27,750
I probably doesn't want
me to mention his name.

3241
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,340
He's a legit Sharman.

3242
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:29,821
I mean,

3243
01:39:29,821 --> 01:39:31,080
he's a cool dude.

3244
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:33,960
Like you have conversations with them
and you're looking at this dude's eyes

3245
01:39:33,961 --> 01:39:34,560
like,

3246
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:34,771
Oh,

3247
01:39:34,771 --> 01:39:35,880
you've seen some shit.

3248
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:36,630
You know,

3249
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:39,750
he puts on Iowasca
ceremonies for MMA fighters.

3250
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:42,210
He'll take them for a
retreat in the mountains.

3251
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:46,620
They have the spot that he goes to
and he cooks up the IOWASCA and just,

3252
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:48,860
he thinks it's important for,

3253
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:49,740
for being a fighter.

3254
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:54,210
He thinks that a fighter to really truly
get in tune with who he is as a man,

3255
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:55,860
that a psychedelic experience,

3256
01:39:55,861 --> 01:39:57,070
like an Iowasca experience,

3257
01:39:57,071 --> 01:40:00,960
we'll get rid of all that extra baggage
she's carrying around that he doesn't

3258
01:40:00,961 --> 01:40:04,890
need and it allow you to
perform as an unhindered soul.

3259
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:05,131
I mean,

3260
01:40:05,131 --> 01:40:07,770
you may not even want
to continue MMA anymore.

3261
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:09,540
That's the other problem with it.

3262
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:11,160
You do something like Iowasca.

3263
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:14,100
There's a very real possibility that you
don't ever want to hurt anybody again.

3264
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:14,990
And I think that's,

3265
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:17,760
that's a fear that a lot of people have
that they don't want to give up these

3266
01:40:17,761 --> 01:40:18,001
things,

3267
01:40:18,001 --> 01:40:20,070
but it's just your own minds truth.

3268
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:23,250
It's not like Iowasca is
telling you that as I Wasa,

3269
01:40:23,251 --> 01:40:25,650
it's just allowing you to think
about something in a certain way.

3270
01:40:25,651 --> 01:40:26,700
So don't be afraid of that shit.

3271
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:28,470
I used to be,

3272
01:40:28,471 --> 01:40:29,070
I mean,

3273
01:40:29,070 --> 01:40:31,880
this is going to be a ridiculous
statement and I'm prefacing it.

3274
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,060
I have to admit,

3275
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:34,890
I know it sounds ridiculous even to me,

3276
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:37,680
but what I was first
starting doing comedy,

3277
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:43,010
I wanted to make sure that I wasn't on
the path of enlightenment because if I

3278
01:40:44,491 --> 01:40:46,170
was on the path to be enlightened,

3279
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:48,300
I saw it fucking up my comedy.

3280
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:49,230
Right?

3281
01:40:49,230 --> 01:40:51,420
I mean it's a total ridiculous thought.

3282
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:55,000
I mean it sounds like a cop out for
not trying to be more enlightened,

3283
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:57,160
but it was a real legitimate thought.

3284
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,211
Like I was like,

3285
01:40:58,211 --> 01:41:01,660
I was thinking about all the people that
I think are really funny and what kind

3286
01:41:01,661 --> 01:41:02,000
of fun,

3287
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,070
what is their comedy?

3288
01:41:03,071 --> 01:41:04,480
What kind of comedy do I do?

3289
01:41:04,481 --> 01:41:05,410
I like that they do.

3290
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,600
And is all this like crazy,

3291
01:41:07,601 --> 01:41:10,250
ridiculous drunkin you know,

3292
01:41:10,830 --> 01:41:15,830
these tirades and stories that were just
the most ridiculous sexual escapades.

3293
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:18,760
Those are the guys that I
thought were the most hilarious.

3294
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:19,630
And I'm like,

3295
01:41:19,630 --> 01:41:19,751
well,

3296
01:41:19,751 --> 01:41:20,190
there's no,

3297
01:41:20,190 --> 01:41:21,040
you got to drink.

3298
01:41:21,110 --> 01:41:21,943
Like you can't.

3299
01:41:22,110 --> 01:41:22,943
Like you can't be,

3300
01:41:23,170 --> 01:41:25,600
you can't be doing yoga
and eating vegetables.

3301
01:41:25,601 --> 01:41:27,070
Like do you have to
drink to be this funny?

3302
01:41:27,071 --> 01:41:28,480
Like this is a totally different thing.

3303
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:33,780
And I and I remember thinking that there
was no way that you could be like on

3304
01:41:34,061 --> 01:41:34,721
the path,

3305
01:41:34,721 --> 01:41:38,110
like even thinking about it
enlightenment and still be funny.

3306
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:39,970
I think the,

3307
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:43,660
the way to think about that for me is,

3308
01:41:43,661 --> 01:41:46,000
and I think part of this
experience opened it up,

3309
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:51,420
is being on that path to enlightenment
and restricting yourself from drinking or

3310
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:53,680
having to be in a certain way.

3311
01:41:53,681 --> 01:41:56,080
It's kind of like that
shaman that's playing shaman,

3312
01:41:56,440 --> 01:42:00,970
you know like the truly enlightened
individual can decide and I think the

3313
01:42:00,971 --> 01:42:02,020
Toltecs had a word for it.

3314
01:42:02,021 --> 01:42:03,490
They call it your controlled folly.

3315
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:06,880
You can decide to get wasted
and do something like that,

3316
01:42:06,881 --> 01:42:08,710
but do it in a conscious way.

3317
01:42:08,711 --> 01:42:11,980
I mean obviously doing something to hurt
somebody that's probably going to be a

3318
01:42:11,981 --> 01:42:13,480
problem with do things of course.

3319
01:42:13,481 --> 01:42:15,520
But you can choose to be
whatever you want to be.

3320
01:42:15,521 --> 01:42:19,630
You don't have to be a fucking
raw vegan meditating every day,

3321
01:42:19,631 --> 01:42:21,370
yoga kind of kind of person,

3322
01:42:21,371 --> 01:42:22,930
unless that's what you want to be like.

3323
01:42:22,931 --> 01:42:26,980
You can still choose and it's still a
path with heart and I think that's what

3324
01:42:26,981 --> 01:42:29,740
the true enlightenment is and will be.

3325
01:42:29,741 --> 01:42:31,600
It's not going to be
playing enlightenment.

3326
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:34,150
It's just going to be
being there and deciding,

3327
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:34,690
yeah,

3328
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:37,630
we're going down this fucking Jack
Daniels hold today and we're going to see

3329
01:42:37,631 --> 01:42:38,760
what's on the other side of it.

3330
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:43,850
Well that's why there's a big issue
with people who are trying to combat and

3331
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:47,160
what they seem to be a negative,

3332
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:48,050
like a,

3333
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:52,740
a negative behavior or negative
attitude hate maybe perhaps that they're

3334
01:42:52,741 --> 01:42:54,150
combating it with hate.

3335
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:55,080
Yup.

3336
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,750
It's like it's the total
incorrect approach.

3337
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:58,980
Like if you,

3338
01:42:58,981 --> 01:43:01,590
if you're faced with was
something that hates you,

3339
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:02,873
mock it.

3340
01:43:03,090 --> 01:43:03,570
Yeah.

3341
01:43:03,570 --> 01:43:04,403
You know,

3342
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:05,593
don't hate,

3343
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:06,780
don't actually be angry.

3344
01:43:06,781 --> 01:43:08,580
Point out what's ridiculous about it.

3345
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:11,580
And if you could point out what
[inaudible] about it successfully,

3346
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:14,880
it can even be ignored by
the subject of your ridicule.

3347
01:43:14,930 --> 01:43:15,210
Yeah.

3348
01:43:15,210 --> 01:43:16,380
That's the beauty of it.

3349
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:19,710
You can't ignore it if someone shuts
you down and makes fun of you and it's a

3350
01:43:19,711 --> 01:43:21,630
really funny way and
you look really stupid.

3351
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:22,291
Like,

3352
01:43:22,291 --> 01:43:22,741
oh my God,

3353
01:43:22,741 --> 01:43:23,574
I do do that.

3354
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:26,250
You know,

3355
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:26,881
if someone,

3356
01:43:26,881 --> 01:43:29,970
by the ways he like we always do
the calendar by the way it goes up.

3357
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:30,870
Fuck I do that.

3358
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:31,591
He knows he does it.

3359
01:43:31,591 --> 01:43:32,040
Yeah.

3360
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:32,730
You know,

3361
01:43:32,730 --> 01:43:33,300
that's,

3362
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:33,810
that's,

3363
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:34,890
I mean that's a bad example,

3364
01:43:34,891 --> 01:43:36,510
but that's when you're,

3365
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:37,920
when you're trying to

3366
01:43:40,170 --> 01:43:41,820
stop hateful,

3367
01:43:41,821 --> 01:43:42,720
angry behavior,

3368
01:43:42,721 --> 01:43:46,320
the tendency is always to
meet it with a more hateful,

3369
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,330
more angry response.

3370
01:43:48,690 --> 01:43:50,130
It's almost like instinct,

3371
01:43:50,131 --> 01:43:55,131
but there's strength in forgiving
people and there's strength in having a

3372
01:43:56,961 --> 01:44:01,961
frustration and an anger towards something
and then just completely letting it

3373
01:44:02,031 --> 01:44:02,864
go.

3374
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:04,870
And there's a freedom in
that where you realize,

3375
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:05,331
oh,

3376
01:44:05,331 --> 01:44:06,860
that was a choice.

3377
01:44:07,270 --> 01:44:07,941
That was a choice.

3378
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:08,900
I was hanging onto this.

3379
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:12,620
How many guys do you know that you had
like maybe a disagreement with or a beef

3380
01:44:12,621 --> 01:44:14,930
with or you were worried
about running into them like,

3381
01:44:14,931 --> 01:44:15,621
oh my God,

3382
01:44:15,621 --> 01:44:17,420
this better not get physical.

3383
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:19,220
Like this guy better not
swing at me or something.

3384
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:20,750
But then when you got there,

3385
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:24,530
like you maybe said something that
explained your side a little better and he

3386
01:44:24,531 --> 01:44:26,090
said something and explain his side.

3387
01:44:26,091 --> 01:44:26,924
And then you hug,

3388
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,020
like you shake hands and you hug and you,

3389
01:44:29,390 --> 01:44:30,051
and then woo.

3390
01:44:30,051 --> 01:44:31,190
What a relief that is.

3391
01:44:31,191 --> 01:44:32,750
What a great feeling that is.

3392
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:37,990
When neutralize this acid you've been
keeping in this little file inside your

3393
01:44:38,031 --> 01:44:38,491
body,

3394
01:44:38,491 --> 01:44:38,630
you,

3395
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:41,810
especially when it's just a misconception.

3396
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:44,960
And when you can enlighten
that person or you can,

3397
01:44:44,961 --> 01:44:45,261
you know,

3398
01:44:45,261 --> 01:44:46,940
you can clarify what,

3399
01:44:46,941 --> 01:44:49,830
what was really going on or
what you had to do or why,

3400
01:44:49,831 --> 01:44:50,840
why you fucked up.

3401
01:44:50,841 --> 01:44:55,670
Or that's a nice feeling when people
just abandon the idea of being enemies.

3402
01:44:55,730 --> 01:45:00,050
But it makes you feel like what is
keeping us from doing this all the time?

3403
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:03,290
And one thing that I had a,

3404
01:45:03,291 --> 01:45:03,531
I mean,

3405
01:45:03,531 --> 01:45:06,050
I've had a few experiences that
were pretty changing to me,

3406
01:45:06,051 --> 01:45:06,950
but one of them that was,

3407
01:45:06,970 --> 01:45:07,580
uh,

3408
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:11,000
that I didn't expect was ecstasy to doing.

3409
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:11,271
Actually,

3410
01:45:11,271 --> 01:45:12,860
I didn't think it was
gonna change me very much.

3411
01:45:12,861 --> 01:45:14,840
I thought it was just
going to be a party drug.

3412
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:17,630
We're going to do some
ecstasy and hold hands.

3413
01:45:17,631 --> 01:45:18,950
Like I was holding my friend's hand,

3414
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:19,700
Dude's hand,

3415
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:20,870
we're rubbing fingers together.

3416
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:22,910
This was the most ridiculous thing ever.

3417
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:27,530
It's so like it would be
so homoerotic or so gay,

3418
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:27,861
you know,

3419
01:45:27,861 --> 01:45:29,090
if we did that in a regular basis,

3420
01:45:29,091 --> 01:45:29,391
if we're,

3421
01:45:29,391 --> 01:45:30,230
if we're holding hands,

3422
01:45:30,231 --> 01:45:31,340
you better be a joke involved,

3423
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:32,360
you know?

3424
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:34,730
But when you're on ecstasy
it felt totally normal.

3425
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:36,620
And then I remember
thinking after it was over,

3426
01:45:36,621 --> 01:45:41,621
like I know he's not gay and I'm not
gay like w but how come in normal life I

3427
01:45:42,291 --> 01:45:43,610
would never let that happen.

3428
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:46,300
But in this state of,

3429
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:49,880
of ecstasy when you're on
Mtma it's totally cool.

3430
01:45:49,881 --> 01:45:53,180
Hugging your friends is totally
cool and it's completely nonsexual.

3431
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:54,470
And it made me think like,

3432
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:55,250
man,

3433
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:58,330
we're really insecure and
like the strangest ways like,

3434
01:45:58,340 --> 01:46:00,980
and that we don't even
recognize as being insecure,

3435
01:46:01,310 --> 01:46:02,870
sexually insecure,

3436
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:04,580
physically insecure,

3437
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:05,900
mentally insecure,

3438
01:46:05,930 --> 01:46:08,900
insecure I to whether or
not people really like you.

3439
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:12,440
There's people out there that are
living their lives wondering if people

3440
01:46:12,441 --> 01:46:15,410
actually like them or if they're
just pretending to like them,

3441
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:16,071
they're going to turn on them.

3442
01:46:16,071 --> 01:46:16,880
Men at any moment.

3443
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:17,380
Yup.

3444
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:17,940
I mean they,

3445
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:20,750
they're going through life flinching,

3446
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:22,833
you know,

3447
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:24,260
these experiences.

3448
01:46:24,261 --> 01:46:25,490
That was one of the things with,

3449
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:26,630
with the watch humor too.

3450
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:30,570
I mean just hugging somebody who
you don't even hardly fucking no.

3451
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:30,990
Yeah.

3452
01:46:30,990 --> 01:46:33,920
But it's just another human being and
it's like at the end of the ceremony

3453
01:46:33,921 --> 01:46:34,520
night,

3454
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:34,940
you know,

3455
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:35,750
just like,

3456
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:36,560
hey that was,

3457
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:37,340
that was cool.

3458
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:40,850
You feel like you feel this connection
with that human being and it's,

3459
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:45,290
it's so weird that we become dull and
we close ourselves off to all of these

3460
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:49,470
possible expressions that are available
and these medicines are a great way to

3461
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:50,040
kind

3462
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:50,910
of open that up.

3463
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:51,550
Yeah.

3464
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:52,230
Yeah.

3465
01:46:52,230 --> 01:46:56,940
Well they are technology and they
have been used by people we know,

3466
01:46:56,941 --> 01:47:00,660
including yourself to positive
benefit to a positive result.

3467
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:03,090
And that's just something
you can't ignore anymore.

3468
01:47:03,091 --> 01:47:04,830
You can't just tell
people they can't do it.

3469
01:47:04,831 --> 01:47:06,030
Cause you said right.

3470
01:47:06,031 --> 01:47:06,260
Does it,

3471
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:08,700
you can't just do that
doesn't make any sense.

3472
01:47:08,850 --> 01:47:11,670
The only reason why this shit is
not in the United States of America,

3473
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:12,301
first of all,

3474
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:13,650
it's holding back our freedom.

3475
01:47:15,490 --> 01:47:16,323
Okay?

3476
01:47:16,770 --> 01:47:17,131
It is.

3477
01:47:17,131 --> 01:47:18,090
It's holding back our freedom.

3478
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:19,710
It really is sacred freedom.

3479
01:47:19,711 --> 01:47:21,430
We have autonomy over us.

3480
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:21,921
Well,

3481
01:47:21,921 --> 01:47:22,130
the road,

3482
01:47:22,130 --> 01:47:25,650
the only reason why human beings figured
out any things cause they had a freedom

3483
01:47:25,651 --> 01:47:26,340
to experiment.

3484
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:29,520
That's the only reason
why language was invented.

3485
01:47:29,550 --> 01:47:31,020
If you could weren't allowed to say,

3486
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:33,120
how about we fucking make a equals,

3487
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:33,630
ah,

3488
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:34,340
can we do that?

3489
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:34,810
I was,

3490
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:35,643
is this,

3491
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:35,940
you know,

3492
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:39,840
the only reason why anybody was allowed
to do that is cause you had freedom to

3493
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:41,040
express yourself.

3494
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:42,510
Freedom to try things.

3495
01:47:42,511 --> 01:47:43,344
True freedom to,

3496
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:47,520
and whether the try that trying that
thing is creating a language or whether

3497
01:47:47,521 --> 01:47:51,120
it's figuring out that
psychedelic medicines allow
you to get a better grip on

3498
01:47:51,121 --> 01:47:55,320
your ego and how much your insecurity
in the futility of life itself becomes a

3499
01:47:55,321 --> 01:47:57,090
focal point instead of life.

3500
01:47:57,330 --> 01:47:59,640
The futility of life
becomes your focal point.

3501
01:47:59,790 --> 01:48:00,091
Oh,

3502
01:48:00,091 --> 01:48:00,780
what's the point?

3503
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:01,830
There's not a point,

3504
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:02,970
but it's going on right now.

3505
01:48:02,971 --> 01:48:05,370
When you're blowing it sun and it blowing.

3506
01:48:05,371 --> 01:48:08,120
It's like Angelo Dundee said to sugar
ray Leonard before he came out to knock

3507
01:48:08,121 --> 01:48:09,030
out Tommy Hearns.

3508
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:10,710
You're blowing its sun.

3509
01:48:11,030 --> 01:48:11,640
Yeah.

3510
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:13,590
You're going through your
whole life flinching.

3511
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:14,633
Yep.

3512
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:16,200
Very wise brother,

3513
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:20,550
very when Chin and being angry at
people and he calling that angry.

3514
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:22,930
Yeah.

3515
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:23,440
That's,

3516
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:24,273
that's the key.

3517
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:24,671
And then,

3518
01:48:24,671 --> 01:48:25,060
uh,

3519
01:48:25,060 --> 01:48:27,640
that's out there that though
it is the secret's out.

3520
01:48:27,770 --> 01:48:28,160
I mean,

3521
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:29,380
I didn't invent it.

3522
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:30,860
It's fucking banging around.

3523
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:31,720
Thousand years old.

3524
01:48:31,721 --> 01:48:35,680
You gotta you gotta dude holding the
fucking watch Houma stock it his head up

3525
01:48:35,681 --> 01:48:36,640
and it's hard for it.

3526
01:48:36,790 --> 01:48:37,361
And that's actually,

3527
01:48:37,361 --> 01:48:39,010
so to close out the earth ceremony,

3528
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:41,160
they all have the shoving,

3529
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:41,471
you know,

3530
01:48:41,471 --> 01:48:42,400
spiritual figures.

3531
01:48:42,401 --> 01:48:42,911
They're jagged,

3532
01:48:42,911 --> 01:48:44,890
they're turning into
Jaguars in their heads up.

3533
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:46,630
And I didn't really understand that.

3534
01:48:46,631 --> 01:48:47,950
And He Gandalf doesn't,

3535
01:48:47,951 --> 01:48:48,071
you know,

3536
01:48:48,071 --> 01:48:50,260
Don Howard doesn't really tell you things.

3537
01:48:50,261 --> 01:48:51,580
He lets you try to figure it out.

3538
01:48:51,610 --> 01:48:56,080
So we go through and the night of the
earth ceremony was his kind of big

3539
01:48:56,081 --> 01:48:59,620
clearing night where he's working
on trying to clear the energies.

3540
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:00,613
Um,

3541
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:01,150
out of,

3542
01:49:01,150 --> 01:49:01,931
out of different people,

3543
01:49:01,931 --> 01:49:03,230
much like an ios Carol Wood.

3544
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,230
So it gets to be my turn.

3545
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:06,093
And uh,

3546
01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:06,621
and he,

3547
01:49:06,621 --> 01:49:06,881
he know,

3548
01:49:06,881 --> 01:49:07,511
he whispers,

3549
01:49:07,511 --> 01:49:08,890
he comes behind me and he says,

3550
01:49:08,891 --> 01:49:09,520
uh,

3551
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:10,030
he says,

3552
01:49:10,030 --> 01:49:11,980
you're pure Chavez and
brother heart to heart.

3553
01:49:12,610 --> 01:49:13,121
And I was like,

3554
01:49:13,121 --> 01:49:13,660
all right,

3555
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:15,580
and I could just feel
this kind of warmth and,

3556
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:17,860
and intensity and what he was saying.

3557
01:49:17,861 --> 01:49:22,450
And he starts rattling is rattles and
a feather and he starts doing it on my

3558
01:49:22,451 --> 01:49:25,600
chest and I'm just sitting
there and for about 30 seconds,

3559
01:49:25,601 --> 01:49:26,434
nothing's happening.

3560
01:49:27,490 --> 01:49:32,490
And then I noticed my chest starts to
lift like more and more until my chest is

3561
01:49:32,651 --> 01:49:35,830
so far forward that I'm not
consciously doing this at all.

3562
01:49:36,190 --> 01:49:41,190
My chest is so far forward that I can't
help but tilt my head up to the sky.

3563
01:49:42,850 --> 01:49:46,030
And I realized at that point
what the message of that was,

3564
01:49:46,031 --> 01:49:46,780
was that,

3565
01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:49,870
so we lead with the
cerebral part of our mind.

3566
01:49:49,871 --> 01:49:50,890
Just thinking,

3567
01:49:50,891 --> 01:49:51,880
constantly thinking,

3568
01:49:51,881 --> 01:49:52,271
thinking,

3569
01:49:52,271 --> 01:49:53,104
thinking.

3570
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:54,003
But really,

3571
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:54,790
you know,

3572
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:56,980
the best way to do it is to lead,

3573
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:58,030
lead with your heart.

3574
01:49:58,280 --> 01:49:58,600
You know,

3575
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:03,280
lead with that deeper knowledge that
doesn't require the magnificent calculator

3576
01:50:03,281 --> 01:50:06,370
that we have because it is a magnificent
calculator's great for computing,

3577
01:50:06,490 --> 01:50:07,121
innovating,

3578
01:50:07,121 --> 01:50:07,954
things like that.

3579
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:10,720
But to chart the course for yourself,

3580
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:11,651
for your friends,

3581
01:50:11,651 --> 01:50:12,484
for humanity,

3582
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:14,320
charting that with that deeper,

3583
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:15,460
you know,

3584
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:18,340
empathetic intelligence that
you have at your core center,

3585
01:50:18,341 --> 01:50:20,020
which you call we call heart,

3586
01:50:20,290 --> 01:50:20,561
you know,

3587
01:50:20,561 --> 01:50:21,640
whatever you want to call that.

3588
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:23,950
That's the way to really lead.

3589
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:28,930
And he was able to kind of
get that through my head
and help me understand what

3590
01:50:28,931 --> 01:50:29,520
all these,

3591
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:29,920
you know,

3592
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:30,461
graphics,

3593
01:50:30,461 --> 01:50:31,540
these tapestries were,

3594
01:50:31,870 --> 01:50:32,703
um,

3595
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,750
without ever having to say a single word.

3596
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:35,613
And that's,

3597
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:35,890
you know,

3598
01:50:35,890 --> 01:50:39,670
some of the cool things about working
with a real master like dawn Howard is,

3599
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:40,810
he could have told me that.

3600
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:41,231
Yeah,

3601
01:50:41,231 --> 01:50:43,930
they all have their head up
because their hearts forward,

3602
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:47,260
their heads connecting with source
and their hearts leading the way.

3603
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:47,740
Well,

3604
01:50:47,740 --> 01:50:48,910
he doesn't have to say that,

3605
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:49,360
you know,

3606
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:50,380
he can just kind of,

3607
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:51,100
you know,

3608
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:52,090
use the rattles,

3609
01:50:52,091 --> 01:50:53,050
use the feathers.

3610
01:50:53,190 --> 01:50:53,460
You,

3611
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:55,180
you look at it and you just feel it.

3612
01:50:55,270 --> 01:50:56,103
So you don't need

3613
01:50:56,150 --> 01:50:58,610
hold narratative exactly.

3614
01:50:58,611 --> 01:50:59,301
Aeration.

3615
01:50:59,301 --> 01:51:00,134
Of the events

3616
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:01,560
pretty clear what's going on.

3617
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:02,070
Yep.

3618
01:51:02,070 --> 01:51:02,311
You know,

3619
01:51:02,311 --> 01:51:06,300
you just tap in and that same truth
that hit them 4,000 years ago,

3620
01:51:06,301 --> 01:51:06,900
we'll hit you.

3621
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:07,340
Ooh,

3622
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:08,173
that's so crazy.

3623
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:09,660
It was fucking

3624
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:10,720
awesome.

3625
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:11,081
Awesome.

3626
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:11,270
You,

3627
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:13,180
do you believe that you experience,

3628
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:15,790
you co experience other people's trips.

3629
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:19,030
Do you believe that trips
are contained like a,

3630
01:51:19,031 --> 01:51:19,850
that was one of the,

3631
01:51:19,850 --> 01:51:22,900
the ideas that Mckenna had about any,

3632
01:51:22,930 --> 01:51:25,150
any psychedelic that
when you're taking it,

3633
01:51:25,151 --> 01:51:27,850
you're not just imbibing
in this one psychedelic,

3634
01:51:28,030 --> 01:51:31,750
you're actually experiencing all the
trips of all the people who've ever done

3635
01:51:31,751 --> 01:51:32,080
it.

3636
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:36,370
That there's a shared space that
the trips live in and that's,

3637
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:41,440
it's what you're doing is literally or
figuratively connecting to something

3638
01:51:41,570 --> 01:51:42,710
sort of another dimension.

3639
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:46,910
I feel like that cause I feel like there's
a spirit of the plant now I will say

3640
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:49,160
with non plant medicines,

3641
01:51:49,190 --> 01:51:50,150
which I've done a couple of acts,

3642
01:51:50,151 --> 01:51:52,040
he told some of those
stories in the last podcast.

3643
01:51:52,550 --> 01:51:55,430
I did not feel that with non plant
medicines and I haven't had a good

3644
01:51:55,431 --> 01:51:55,881
experience.

3645
01:51:55,881 --> 01:51:58,130
And I know there's a lot
of people like smoking DMT.

3646
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,650
Well that comes from um,

3647
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:02,630
that comes from extracted from the plant.

3648
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:02,850
Yeah.

3649
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:03,830
You can get synthetic,

3650
01:52:03,831 --> 01:52:04,041
you know,

3651
01:52:04,041 --> 01:52:05,480
they do like five men.

3652
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:06,260
Have you ever done that?

3653
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:07,580
I haven't done any synthetic.

3654
01:52:07,610 --> 01:52:11,030
Everything I've done is from
the extracted from Bark,

3655
01:52:11,690 --> 01:52:13,460
so I dunno,

3656
01:52:13,580 --> 01:52:13,821
I mean,

3657
01:52:13,821 --> 01:52:14,031
but,

3658
01:52:14,031 --> 01:52:15,170
but with the plant medicines,

3659
01:52:15,171 --> 01:52:17,540
I feel like you're connecting to your,

3660
01:52:17,541 --> 01:52:22,250
you're jumping in a lake that has been
there and has a resonance and everybody

3661
01:52:22,251 --> 01:52:25,220
else who swam in that lake
and left their stinking water,

3662
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:25,671
you know,

3663
01:52:25,671 --> 01:52:26,181
they're beautiful,

3664
01:52:26,181 --> 01:52:26,511
stink,

3665
01:52:26,511 --> 01:52:27,410
whatever you want to call it.

3666
01:52:27,470 --> 01:52:30,830
You're connected with that whole
experience and it has an intrinsic nature.

3667
01:52:30,830 --> 01:52:30,910
Sure.

3668
01:52:30,910 --> 01:52:31,301
Sorry.

3669
01:52:31,301 --> 01:52:32,470
Here's something to consider too.

3670
01:52:32,471 --> 01:52:35,860
When you bring up this whole idea of
what is synthetic and what is natural,

3671
01:52:35,861 --> 01:52:40,480
and the reality is everything
on earth comes from Earth.

3672
01:52:40,870 --> 01:52:43,240
So it is all natural and a certain sense.

3673
01:52:43,390 --> 01:52:45,800
It has just been manipulated by beings.

3674
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:47,420
The real question becomes,

3675
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:51,350
is that not natural because it seems
like we manipulate everything around us.

3676
01:52:51,650 --> 01:52:51,921
You know,

3677
01:52:51,921 --> 01:52:53,600
when bees make honey,

3678
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:55,190
they're manipulating things.

3679
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:57,170
I mean we manipulate every God damn thing.

3680
01:52:57,171 --> 01:52:58,670
We get a turf and it does it.

3681
01:52:58,730 --> 01:52:59,600
Is it really natural?

3682
01:52:59,601 --> 01:53:00,470
If it be made it,

3683
01:53:00,830 --> 01:53:03,100
it seems like that bead
just sort of fucking,

3684
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:04,183
well,

3685
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:06,390
maybe it's just that that lake,

3686
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:06,671
you know,

3687
01:53:06,671 --> 01:53:10,530
so the Lsd Lake got formed by
Albert Hoffman and whatever,

3688
01:53:10,531 --> 01:53:11,400
the thirties or whatever.

3689
01:53:11,550 --> 01:53:12,210
So it's like,

3690
01:53:12,210 --> 01:53:13,860
it's like 80 years old,

3691
01:53:13,950 --> 01:53:14,370
right?

3692
01:53:14,370 --> 01:53:17,650
So it doesn't have a lot of essence to it.

3693
01:53:17,651 --> 01:53:18,810
It doesn't have a lot of spirit.

3694
01:53:18,811 --> 01:53:23,400
I believe it probably does have a spirit
and maybe in 3000 years that LSD spirit

3695
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:27,450
will be strong as fuck and the communal
experience of all that will be there.

3696
01:53:27,630 --> 01:53:31,200
But when you're doing something that's
grown and been alive and been in

3697
01:53:31,201 --> 01:53:32,034
existence,

3698
01:53:32,130 --> 01:53:36,960
it's had way longer to just kind of
feel and collect the energy of everybody

3699
01:53:36,961 --> 01:53:37,231
else.

3700
01:53:37,231 --> 01:53:38,340
It's been there.

3701
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:38,551
Well,

3702
01:53:38,551 --> 01:53:39,930
that's when it had more of a power.

3703
01:53:40,110 --> 01:53:40,820
That's what it means.

3704
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:43,790
Sense that it would have
these experiences in it.

3705
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:47,540
Because the idea being that when
you're consuming a psychedelic,

3706
01:53:47,541 --> 01:53:48,560
and this is by the way,

3707
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:49,581
if I'm butchering this,

3708
01:53:49,581 --> 01:53:50,414
I'm so sorry,

3709
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:53,000
but when you're consuming a psychedelic,

3710
01:53:53,001 --> 01:53:56,660
the idea is that you are
becoming one with it.

3711
01:53:56,810 --> 01:53:59,210
That during that digestive process,

3712
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:00,710
proceeds knows that I say process.

3713
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:03,330
I sound cooler and
smarter process process.

3714
01:54:03,331 --> 01:54:04,610
I wish I was Canadian process.

3715
01:54:05,010 --> 01:54:05,510
Um,

3716
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:06,680
as you're saying it,

3717
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:08,630
I guess it'd be English
more than Canadian.

3718
01:54:08,990 --> 01:54:09,710
Um,

3719
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:12,320
that this somehow or another,

3720
01:54:12,350 --> 01:54:13,910
when it connects to your bloodstream,

3721
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:16,100
when it passes the blood brain barrier,

3722
01:54:16,101 --> 01:54:18,920
whether it's a silicide
been or whether it's,

3723
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:19,550
you know,

3724
01:54:19,550 --> 01:54:24,550
any of these other psychedelic compounds
that you take in that during that trip

3725
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:29,660
that what's actually happening is you
are changing your frequency and your,

3726
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:30,860
your mind,

3727
01:54:30,861 --> 01:54:31,060
you,

3728
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:34,490
whatever you call your
consciousness goes to another place.

3729
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,860
What happens in the place where it's
at while it's happening is that while

3730
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:39,703
they're all connected,

3731
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:41,990
the idea that you have to
be in another dimension,

3732
01:54:41,991 --> 01:54:43,610
your mind's in another
dimension of your body's here.

3733
01:54:43,611 --> 01:54:44,444
That doesn't make any sense.

3734
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:46,190
It does make sense because they're all,

3735
01:54:46,191 --> 01:54:47,660
it's a big crazy soup.

3736
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:48,050
Yeah.

3737
01:54:48,050 --> 01:54:50,270
But it's a soup that
seems like you can only,

3738
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:55,990
you can only access certain areas of it
when you hit this certain frequency that

3739
01:54:56,031 --> 01:55:01,031
you get by imbibing these plant cocktails
and whether they're synthetic because

3740
01:55:01,671 --> 01:55:05,180
they're based on the plants or
whether it's the actual plant itself.

3741
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:09,320
What you're doing is you're tapping
into that next door neighbor.

3742
01:55:09,710 --> 01:55:11,480
You're just stealing cable from that guy.

3743
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:14,180
You're like using his electricity.

3744
01:55:14,181 --> 01:55:14,361
Like,

3745
01:55:14,361 --> 01:55:15,050
whoa.

3746
01:55:15,050 --> 01:55:15,231
I mean,

3747
01:55:15,231 --> 01:55:16,730
it's almost like that you're,

3748
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:21,760
you go into the next door
neighbor dimension and you
agree and all bets are off.

3749
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:22,640
I think I

3750
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:24,480
kind of look at it like you're a,

3751
01:55:24,481 --> 01:55:26,970
you're a shish Kebab and
you're going through an onion,

3752
01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:31,290
and so all of you and all the
potentials are that whole shish Kebab.

3753
01:55:31,291 --> 01:55:34,710
It's all aligned and infinite
onion of infinite layers.

3754
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:37,470
And so doing these medicines
just move your consciousness,

3755
01:55:37,471 --> 01:55:42,180
which is like a dot on that shish Kebab
and move it up and down through those

3756
01:55:42,181 --> 01:55:43,020
different layers.

3757
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:44,100
And that's,

3758
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,630
and that's really kind
of what you're doing,

3759
01:55:45,631 --> 01:55:46,590
but you're still connected.

3760
01:55:46,591 --> 01:55:47,550
You're still that one,

3761
01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:48,030
you know,

3762
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:51,090
infinite shish Kabob on a
fucking infinite piercing,

3763
01:55:51,091 --> 01:55:52,050
an infinite onion.

3764
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:55,700
Your consciousness is just
kind of sliding up and down.

3765
01:55:55,770 --> 01:55:56,311
Oh my God,

3766
01:55:56,311 --> 01:55:57,144
that is what you're doing.

3767
01:55:58,650 --> 01:56:03,650
That the idea that you can somehow or
another in mid life alter and change,

3768
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:06,570
like that sounds ridiculous to people,

3769
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:10,560
but is it less ridiculous that you could
run into someone and they just lost 80

3770
01:56:10,561 --> 01:56:11,394
pounds?

3771
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:11,671
I mean,

3772
01:56:11,671 --> 01:56:12,750
what happened to that guy?

3773
01:56:12,930 --> 01:56:17,930
If you're telling me that that guy didn't
make a drastic change in the path of

3774
01:56:18,061 --> 01:56:18,894
his life,

3775
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:23,970
whether it's figuratively or whether
it's an actual drastic change,

3776
01:56:23,971 --> 01:56:25,770
like what you're seeing from that guys,

3777
01:56:25,771 --> 01:56:26,280
that he's,

3778
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:28,740
his reality and his future changed.

3779
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:31,050
His reality was he's a fat fuck.

3780
01:56:31,170 --> 01:56:32,220
He eats donuts,

3781
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:33,330
he's gonna die fat,

3782
01:56:33,660 --> 01:56:35,010
and then boom,

3783
01:56:35,250 --> 01:56:37,410
he starts hiking and then boom,

3784
01:56:37,530 --> 01:56:41,460
he starts drinking water every day
and he quits all the soda and boom,

3785
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:43,770
he starts eating fresh
vegetables and then boom,

3786
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:46,410
he started fucking lifting
weights and working out.

3787
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:47,160
He does Jujitsu.

3788
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:48,690
He loses 70 fucking pounds.

3789
01:56:48,691 --> 01:56:49,680
It becomes a blue belt.

3790
01:56:49,950 --> 01:56:50,191
He's,

3791
01:56:50,191 --> 01:56:50,910
you know,

3792
01:56:50,910 --> 01:56:51,211
though,

3793
01:56:51,211 --> 01:56:54,120
that's a different human
like that is a guy.

3794
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:58,560
How would this in the same world and
how many of those little changes that

3795
01:56:58,561 --> 01:56:59,670
happen during the day,

3796
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:04,790
pro and con or this constant
river shifting thing and
the idea that time is this

3797
01:57:05,941 --> 01:57:10,110
linear thing and he got to get to 65 and
you got to get a four o one came back

3798
01:57:10,111 --> 01:57:12,840
and you'll have social security and
you're going to go into a box and life for

3799
01:57:12,841 --> 01:57:17,160
the unconscious robot versus that life
lived on the bleeding fucking edge of

3800
01:57:17,161 --> 01:57:17,910
freewill.

3801
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:20,220
And that was what my
last ceremony was about.

3802
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:22,220
The bleeding edge of freewill,

3803
01:57:22,230 --> 01:57:24,690
the Air Masada bleeding edge of freewill.

3804
01:57:25,310 --> 01:57:25,640
I gotta,

3805
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:27,540
I got a bend that co pis,

3806
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:29,790
that'd be the greatest
name for a punk band ever.

3807
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:33,750
The bleeding edge of free will and then
we could solve the debate is who the

3808
01:57:33,751 --> 01:57:36,420
number one fucking drummer
of all time is Jamie.

3809
01:57:36,930 --> 01:57:38,580
That shit is erupted on Twitter.

3810
01:57:38,581 --> 01:57:42,510
People were apparently very upset
at the choices and drummers,

3811
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,670
people take their number
one drummer of all time.

3812
01:57:44,671 --> 01:57:45,504
Seriously,

3813
01:57:45,690 --> 01:57:45,871
uh,

3814
01:57:45,871 --> 01:57:46,770
for folks asking,

3815
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:50,010
we're probably going to wind up doing
one of those podcasts again that we did

3816
01:57:50,011 --> 01:57:50,580
last night.

3817
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:51,413
The uh,

3818
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:54,840
the fight companion while the
a UFC fights we're going on.

3819
01:57:54,841 --> 01:57:57,920
We got drunk and me Brennan Shop,

3820
01:57:57,940 --> 01:58:02,460
Brian Cowen and Aubrey watch
the fights and just talked.

3821
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:04,680
It was one of the most fun podcasts ever.

3822
01:58:05,430 --> 01:58:06,263
Cause it was,

3823
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:07,260
it was the for,

3824
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:09,600
it was a podcast plus awesome fights.

3825
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:10,530
It was,

3826
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:13,680
it was a combination because it
really did flow like a podcast.

3827
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:15,840
It's like subjects came up,

3828
01:58:15,990 --> 01:58:17,520
we talked shit to each other.

3829
01:58:17,730 --> 01:58:19,500
Brian gave out some disinformation.

3830
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:24,060
It was totally like a regular podcast
and on top of it and on top of it,

3831
01:58:24,061 --> 01:58:25,300
they were awesome.

3832
01:58:25,301 --> 01:58:26,190
The fights going on.

3833
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:26,851
So,

3834
01:58:26,851 --> 01:58:27,240
uh,

3835
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:28,260
to the folks that asked,

3836
01:58:28,261 --> 01:58:28,591
yes,

3837
01:58:28,591 --> 01:58:29,990
we're definitely going to do that again.

3838
01:58:29,991 --> 01:58:31,170
Then I had a great time.

3839
01:58:31,410 --> 01:58:31,771
It was like,

3840
01:58:31,771 --> 01:58:32,430
it was a really,

3841
01:58:32,430 --> 01:58:34,590
it was a fresh thing and it made me think,

3842
01:58:34,591 --> 01:58:34,771
man,

3843
01:58:34,771 --> 01:58:35,460
I might like,

3844
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:37,920
I might like doing that more
than I like doing the UFC.

3845
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:38,760
I fucking,

3846
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:39,600
I don't want to say it,

3847
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:42,160
but it might've been better

3848
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:46,270
because I could talk shit and be
completely free with my language.

3849
01:58:46,650 --> 01:58:48,340
We're talking about the fight podcast.

3850
01:58:48,370 --> 01:58:53,320
Last one was one of the most fun fight
watching events ever because we got to

3851
01:58:53,321 --> 01:58:53,980
just talk,

3852
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:54,191
you know,

3853
01:58:54,191 --> 01:58:54,671
hang out,

3854
01:58:54,671 --> 01:58:55,211
have fun,

3855
01:58:55,211 --> 01:58:55,541
laugh,

3856
01:58:55,541 --> 01:58:56,260
joke,

3857
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:56,561
Brendan,

3858
01:58:56,561 --> 01:58:57,310
shop toes,

3859
01:58:57,310 --> 01:58:59,500
all the various ways in
which he's shit himself.

3860
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:01,840
Do you want to shoot yourself?

3861
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:03,230
No Shit.

3862
01:59:04,450 --> 01:59:05,710
I fucking love that dude.

3863
01:59:05,711 --> 01:59:06,760
He's funny man.

3864
01:59:06,790 --> 01:59:08,590
He said some funny shit.

3865
01:59:09,010 --> 01:59:09,910
He cracks me up.

3866
01:59:10,450 --> 01:59:11,860
It's a nice fucking guy too,

3867
01:59:11,861 --> 01:59:12,250
man.

3868
01:59:12,250 --> 01:59:12,521
It's a,

3869
01:59:12,521 --> 01:59:15,160
it's a real pleasure when you meet
someone and the more you know them,

3870
01:59:15,161 --> 01:59:17,740
the more they constantly surprise
and delight you with what?

3871
01:59:17,741 --> 01:59:20,260
The Java sharp is awesome.

3872
01:59:20,290 --> 01:59:21,580
He's aces in my book.

3873
01:59:21,581 --> 01:59:22,414
He's a funny guy.

3874
01:59:22,690 --> 01:59:24,940
A lot of people give him a hard
time because he's real confident,

3875
01:59:24,941 --> 01:59:25,600
you know?

3876
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:26,351
But guess what?

3877
01:59:26,351 --> 01:59:28,540
He's a goddamn professional
mixed martial arts fighter.

3878
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:30,550
If he wasn't that arrogant and confident,

3879
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:31,720
he would be,

3880
01:59:31,750 --> 01:59:31,960
you know,

3881
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:34,000
I would really be suggesting
he tries something different.

3882
01:59:34,450 --> 01:59:35,440
This is not for you.

3883
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:38,770
You have to be a crazy person to do
that job and he knows it and he's acting

3884
01:59:38,771 --> 01:59:39,760
like a crazy person.

3885
01:59:41,430 --> 01:59:42,010
You know?

3886
01:59:42,010 --> 01:59:44,830
It's just like there's certain versions
of the crazy person that people don't

3887
01:59:44,831 --> 01:59:45,350
like to see.

3888
01:59:45,350 --> 01:59:47,040
They don't see it like to
see the cocky credit first,

3889
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:49,180
but it's the authenticity
of it that makes it real.

3890
01:59:49,181 --> 01:59:49,421
I mean,

3891
01:59:49,421 --> 01:59:51,090
cocky can be an act.

3892
01:59:51,110 --> 01:59:51,910
It can be that.

3893
01:59:51,910 --> 01:59:55,570
I got a big old truck with big old tires
because I have a little tiny dick kind

3894
01:59:55,571 --> 01:59:56,201
of mentality,

3895
01:59:56,201 --> 01:59:56,500
you know?

3896
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:57,400
Is there anyone out there?

3897
01:59:57,401 --> 01:59:59,770
I would think that if you're a
big old truck and big old tires,

3898
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:00,521
girls be like,

3899
02:00:00,521 --> 02:00:00,791
come on,

3900
02:00:00,791 --> 02:00:01,624
let me see that deck.

3901
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:02,913
You know,

3902
02:00:03,380 --> 02:00:04,030
you wanted to pull up.

3903
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:06,700
Call is least attention
to your dick as possible.

3904
02:00:06,850 --> 02:00:10,720
You would want like an old golf of
VW golf if you had a little dirt.

3905
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:12,410
He just would not want to peacock it out.

3906
02:00:12,411 --> 02:00:13,244
Saw strong.

3907
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:16,000
That's just my thing that
the word would be out,

3908
02:00:16,001 --> 02:00:16,541
but I don't know.

3909
02:00:16,541 --> 02:00:16,991
I don't know.

3910
02:00:16,991 --> 02:00:18,550
I've never looked at the deck of a man.

3911
02:00:18,730 --> 02:00:19,990
Big Tires next time.

3912
02:00:20,150 --> 02:00:20,560
Hey,

3913
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:22,180
homework for everybody next time.

3914
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:24,080
Next time I see a dude
with big tires on my,

3915
02:00:24,081 --> 02:00:26,470
come on son with that shut out.

3916
02:00:27,310 --> 02:00:28,300
Let me take a look at it.

3917
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:29,643
What happened?

3918
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:31,180
Alright.

3919
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:32,280
Bleeding edge of freewill.

3920
02:00:32,590 --> 02:00:33,580
It's a great name for a band,

3921
02:00:33,581 --> 02:00:33,910
Blah Blah.

3922
02:00:33,910 --> 02:00:34,510
I like it.

3923
02:00:34,510 --> 02:00:34,971
I like that.

3924
02:00:34,971 --> 02:00:35,860
Anybody wants to take it,

3925
02:00:35,861 --> 02:00:36,400
go ahead and get,

3926
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:38,320
I got no trade name for a band.

3927
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:40,080
So final,

3928
02:00:40,210 --> 02:00:41,110
final ceremony.

3929
02:00:41,111 --> 02:00:41,944
The Air Masada.

3930
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:44,740
And I know I have a vague idea that I'm
going to do something called Vielka,

3931
02:00:44,741 --> 02:00:46,450
but I have no idea that's
going to come in the night.

3932
02:00:46,830 --> 02:00:47,140
Um,

3933
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:47,561
but anyway,

3934
02:00:47,561 --> 02:00:49,240
so we get there and I'm
feeling fucking great.

3935
02:00:49,270 --> 02:00:49,541
You know,

3936
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:51,430
we had the good end of the ceremony that,

3937
02:00:51,510 --> 02:00:51,760
you know,

3938
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:52,810
kind of lead with the heart.

3939
02:00:52,811 --> 02:00:54,130
I ended up sleeping well at night.

3940
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:54,671
It felt great.

3941
02:00:54,671 --> 02:00:55,840
The next day was writing.

3942
02:00:55,841 --> 02:00:56,674
Everything is good.

3943
02:00:57,140 --> 02:00:57,880
Um,

3944
02:00:57,880 --> 02:00:59,230
so we go to their ceremony and,

3945
02:00:59,290 --> 02:00:59,791
and I'm,

3946
02:00:59,791 --> 02:01:02,770
I'm really feeling like 1 million
bucks as opposed to the last time,

3947
02:01:03,010 --> 02:01:03,490
um,

3948
02:01:03,490 --> 02:01:08,490
prior to that and he looks at me and
before he pours anything he gives you like

3949
02:01:08,561 --> 02:01:12,610
a long look and you know I gave that
same big old smile from the first day and

3950
02:01:12,611 --> 02:01:17,180
he gave a huge mile back and he starts
pouring and he just feels that cop to

3951
02:01:17,181 --> 02:01:19,420
that brim till the fucking Brim.

3952
02:01:19,421 --> 02:01:19,750
And I'm like,

3953
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:21,160
oh my God,

3954
02:01:21,350 --> 02:01:24,790
I could at least eight ounces of
this fucking have this much humor.

3955
02:01:25,300 --> 02:01:28,030
And it's funny cause it seems like it
gets harder every time you take it.

3956
02:01:28,031 --> 02:01:29,490
Cause even watching like Donald Bear,

3957
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:31,090
this bunk ochre and Darryl Sharman,

3958
02:01:31,270 --> 02:01:34,270
I mean he chokes it down cause he
does the watch whom are with us.

3959
02:01:34,510 --> 02:01:35,620
He chokes it down like

3960
02:01:38,610 --> 02:01:38,930
you know,

3961
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:40,070
because your body is

3962
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:40,371
like,

3963
02:01:40,371 --> 02:01:41,031
Oh God,

3964
02:01:41,031 --> 02:01:44,660
here we go again on this fucking
crazy rollercoaster into the cosmos.

3965
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:46,003
But anyways,

3966
02:01:46,190 --> 02:01:51,190
I choke it down and right away like
the nausea is not there and I'm just

3967
02:01:51,411 --> 02:01:52,280
starting to feel good.

3968
02:01:52,490 --> 02:01:55,580
Not In that same kind of
uncontrollable way is the first day,

3969
02:01:55,581 --> 02:02:00,581
but just in this really kind of
positive good momentum kind of way.

3970
02:02:01,550 --> 02:02:02,181
And a,

3971
02:02:02,181 --> 02:02:03,014
I had brought up,

3972
02:02:03,170 --> 02:02:06,740
I've started playing this native American
flute and I'm not very good at it so I

3973
02:02:06,741 --> 02:02:09,830
was super self conscious the whole time
about playing it because there's nowhere

3974
02:02:09,831 --> 02:02:12,710
to do it privately and everybody
who would listen and I kind of suck.

3975
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:15,680
I mean I'm okay but it bothers
you just suck at a flute.

3976
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:19,640
Well just to like play it
and have everybody listen.

3977
02:02:19,641 --> 02:02:19,980
I Dunno,

3978
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:20,990
I was self conscious about it,

3979
02:02:20,991 --> 02:02:21,290
you know,

3980
02:02:21,290 --> 02:02:22,400
cause I'm not good I guess.

3981
02:02:22,820 --> 02:02:23,361
But anyways,

3982
02:02:23,361 --> 02:02:26,330
at this medicine I was like I'm
starting this fucking test game off.

3983
02:02:26,331 --> 02:02:29,090
Cause last time I failed like every
test in the heart of the jungle.

3984
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:30,530
On my second ceremony I was like,

3985
02:02:30,531 --> 02:02:32,260
this time I made a vow to myself,

3986
02:02:32,290 --> 02:02:32,511
I'm like,

3987
02:02:32,511 --> 02:02:33,980
I'm a pass every fucking test.

3988
02:02:34,610 --> 02:02:38,090
So we go there and take
the medicine are good,

3989
02:02:38,270 --> 02:02:40,850
we get ready and we're going to go on
a long hike this time instead of a boat

3990
02:02:40,851 --> 02:02:41,450
run.

3991
02:02:41,450 --> 02:02:44,780
So we have some time and I brought the
flute out and I started playing the flute

3992
02:02:44,930 --> 02:02:47,060
and I could tell as I was playing it.

3993
02:02:47,061 --> 02:02:47,361
Yeah,

3994
02:02:47,361 --> 02:02:48,021
I'm not great.

3995
02:02:48,021 --> 02:02:51,020
But people kind of dug it because I was
playing it as authentically and as good

3996
02:02:51,021 --> 02:02:51,950
as I possibly can.

3997
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:56,720
And so that kind of for me started off
this first ceremony and the right way,

3998
02:02:56,721 --> 02:03:00,770
like I made a choice to go grab the flute
and I played it and it just felt good

3999
02:03:00,771 --> 02:03:02,210
to not be worried about that shit anymore.

4000
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:03,510
Are you telling me you're starting a band?

4001
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:06,020
Are you going to be the new Jethro?

4002
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:10,050
JETHRO Tull was right a law.

4003
02:03:10,140 --> 02:03:12,150
I have two instruments
that I can kind of play.

4004
02:03:12,151 --> 02:03:14,730
It's a flute and a Didgeridoo and
they don't go together at all.

4005
02:03:14,731 --> 02:03:15,151
Perfect.

4006
02:03:15,151 --> 02:03:15,984
What are you talking about?

4007
02:03:16,210 --> 02:03:17,730
And just need the right mixture of drugs.

4008
02:03:18,210 --> 02:03:19,770
The right mixture of jugs in the flute.

4009
02:03:19,771 --> 02:03:21,420
That degree do is exactly
what you want to hear,

4010
02:03:21,850 --> 02:03:22,683
but

4011
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:28,453
it's true.

4012
02:03:29,290 --> 02:03:32,910
So the prerequisite for the whole
audience would just be to be blasted on

4013
02:03:32,911 --> 02:03:33,360
something.

4014
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:34,650
Paul revere type,

4015
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:35,440
you know,

4016
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:37,830
one of those real patriotic for faculty.

4017
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:41,940
Those are the only instruments they
had like that kind of a tune and boy,

4018
02:03:41,950 --> 02:03:42,783
you

4019
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:44,850
know,

4020
02:03:44,850 --> 02:03:49,260
we'll just highlight the
absurdity of our dimension.

4021
02:03:49,390 --> 02:03:50,223
Totally.

4022
02:03:50,230 --> 02:03:50,591
Totally.

4023
02:03:50,591 --> 02:03:50,920
All right,

4024
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:51,753
well I'll keep that in mind.

4025
02:03:51,910 --> 02:03:52,330
Yeah.

4026
02:03:52,330 --> 02:03:53,440
So scared of the flu.

4027
02:03:54,250 --> 02:03:55,270
So we start on this,

4028
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:57,250
on this nature walk and um,

4029
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:58,241
you know,

4030
02:03:58,241 --> 02:04:01,510
I kind of get the game that there's
going to be test presented and you pass

4031
02:04:01,511 --> 02:04:01,601
them,

4032
02:04:01,601 --> 02:04:02,201
you feel good,

4033
02:04:02,201 --> 02:04:02,801
you don't pass them,

4034
02:04:02,801 --> 02:04:03,634
you feel like shit.

4035
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:04,990
So we're walking through,

4036
02:04:04,991 --> 02:04:06,640
I'm already not stressed about the bugs.

4037
02:04:06,641 --> 02:04:07,330
I got my,

4038
02:04:07,330 --> 02:04:07,601
you know,

4039
02:04:07,601 --> 02:04:10,570
instead of just big shirt and
all this crap all over me,

4040
02:04:10,571 --> 02:04:11,830
I'm just kind of in a tank top.

4041
02:04:11,831 --> 02:04:13,750
I got bug spray and I'm not
trying to be a fucking hero,

4042
02:04:13,751 --> 02:04:15,910
but I'm way less stressed about it.

4043
02:04:15,911 --> 02:04:18,340
And we're walking along and we have
this native guide along with us.

4044
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:22,870
And then I see this really long black
millipede and then there's all this spin

4045
02:04:22,871 --> 02:04:27,120
hundred spindly legs all luckily
and riding in this weird pattern.

4046
02:04:27,140 --> 02:04:28,540
Normally that would freak me the fuck out.

4047
02:04:29,260 --> 02:04:32,560
So I see it and I pointed out to the guide
and she picks it up and lets it crawl

4048
02:04:32,561 --> 02:04:33,071
on her hand.

4049
02:04:33,071 --> 02:04:33,940
And I think to myself,

4050
02:04:33,970 --> 02:04:34,780
Oh fuck,

4051
02:04:34,780 --> 02:04:35,591
this is a test.

4052
02:04:35,591 --> 02:04:39,340
Like I gotta let this thing
on me to like pass this test.

4053
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:41,940
Do not need to do that.

4054
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:45,390
You need me to go with you next
time you go to the jungle and go,

4055
02:04:45,391 --> 02:04:45,811
hey bro,

4056
02:04:45,811 --> 02:04:50,400
how high are you about to let a fucking
bug that you don't know anything about

4057
02:04:50,401 --> 02:04:52,620
crawling on you cause you think
the universe has a test for you.

4058
02:04:52,860 --> 02:04:54,180
You're in the bunk house.

4059
02:04:54,690 --> 02:04:56,940
The only reason I thought it was
safe is because this guy did it.

4060
02:04:56,941 --> 02:04:57,590
But anyways,

4061
02:04:57,590 --> 02:04:59,860
and that going deep with
the wool and this and

4062
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:03,330
at that point I had to,

4063
02:05:03,331 --> 02:05:04,370
I had to let it crawl on me,

4064
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:06,450
I let it crawl on me.

4065
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:09,470
When you did you ask any questions
about its toxicity or no,

4066
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:11,720
the guy didn't speak
English so she was just

4067
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:14,610
worked out.

4068
02:05:14,610 --> 02:05:15,510
It fucking worked out.

4069
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:19,060
So sounds good there and
I felt good after it.

4070
02:05:19,061 --> 02:05:19,351
I was like,

4071
02:05:19,351 --> 02:05:19,621
okay,

4072
02:05:19,621 --> 02:05:20,820
I conquered that little fear,

4073
02:05:20,821 --> 02:05:21,121
you know?

4074
02:05:21,121 --> 02:05:23,760
And then we had another
chance to eat some cocoa pods.

4075
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:27,780
And last time I passed out in the past
on the Kakapo thoughts cause I was

4076
02:05:27,781 --> 02:05:30,210
worried and I hadn't washed
my hands and blah blah blah.

4077
02:05:30,211 --> 02:05:31,610
I was all worried about this shit dude.

4078
02:05:31,630 --> 02:05:33,900
Do you have like a Howie
Mendell type thing?

4079
02:05:34,530 --> 02:05:35,460
I kind of did.

4080
02:05:35,490 --> 02:05:35,761
Yeah.

4081
02:05:35,761 --> 02:05:36,970
Like that was kind of like the,

4082
02:05:36,971 --> 02:05:39,510
it was me not trust in the mud
is worried about the malaria.

4083
02:05:39,511 --> 02:05:41,430
I was worried about the
mosquitoes was worried about,

4084
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:42,601
so that was it.

4085
02:05:42,601 --> 02:05:43,620
So on this third,

4086
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:45,240
on this third session,

4087
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:46,110
you know,

4088
02:05:46,110 --> 02:05:47,220
the cook cow pod comes,

4089
02:05:47,221 --> 02:05:47,461
I was like,

4090
02:05:47,461 --> 02:05:47,850
all right,

4091
02:05:47,850 --> 02:05:51,360
it's another fucking opportunity to just
not be stressed and eat like all the

4092
02:05:51,361 --> 02:05:51,930
rest of the people.

4093
02:05:51,930 --> 02:05:56,930
So you dig your fingers in his kind of
gooey placenta [inaudible] fruit and then

4094
02:05:57,031 --> 02:05:58,260
pull out this pod.

4095
02:05:58,261 --> 02:05:59,430
It's like kind of like an embryo.

4096
02:05:59,431 --> 02:06:01,770
It's really weird and uh,

4097
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:03,270
plopped it in my mouth and it was great.

4098
02:06:03,271 --> 02:06:04,230
It tasted delicious.

4099
02:06:04,231 --> 02:06:08,100
I could kind of feel a little burst of
energy from the cocoa and I was like,

4100
02:06:08,101 --> 02:06:08,491
all right,

4101
02:06:08,491 --> 02:06:08,820
sweet.

4102
02:06:08,820 --> 02:06:09,990
So I'm off to a good start.

4103
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:11,820
We're headed up to the altar and I,

4104
02:06:11,821 --> 02:06:15,960
and I start to realize that life is just
a series of these choices and you can

4105
02:06:15,961 --> 02:06:19,800
either let you know fears that you've
had prevent you from doing this.

4106
02:06:19,801 --> 02:06:20,710
Like Howie Mendell,

4107
02:06:20,730 --> 02:06:25,440
like constantly living in a world where
he's afraid of all kinds of shit and

4108
02:06:25,441 --> 02:06:28,170
that's making him choose
this thing over this thing.

4109
02:06:28,590 --> 02:06:32,730
Or you can kind of go the other way and
choose not to be afraid of those things.

4110
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:33,100
Yeah.

4111
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:34,530
Recognize when there is danger.

4112
02:06:34,531 --> 02:06:36,690
I'm not saying don't recognize danger,

4113
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:39,030
but to separate the fear from danger,

4114
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:41,520
which will allow you a
broader spectrum of choices,

4115
02:06:41,790 --> 02:06:46,620
which will give you gifts of things like
the ability to eat a cacao pod fresh

4116
02:06:46,621 --> 02:06:48,750
out of the jungle when
you're blasted on what tumor,

4117
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:51,210
which is something I was
afraid of doing last time,

4118
02:06:51,630 --> 02:06:52,920
but I wasn't afraid of this time.

4119
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:54,570
So what were you afraid of?

4120
02:06:54,571 --> 02:06:56,040
Like taking it a parasite or something?

4121
02:06:56,041 --> 02:06:56,370
Yeah,

4122
02:06:56,370 --> 02:06:57,300
something like that.

4123
02:06:57,301 --> 02:06:59,400
Some kind of germs that are on my hand.

4124
02:06:59,401 --> 02:06:59,920
I don't fuck.

4125
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:00,840
Is that really common?

4126
02:07:00,870 --> 02:07:02,400
Does that happen to a
lot of people down there?

4127
02:07:02,430 --> 02:07:03,001
Like what are the,

4128
02:07:03,001 --> 02:07:03,270
uh,

4129
02:07:03,270 --> 02:07:03,511
I mean,

4130
02:07:03,511 --> 02:07:04,321
you hear stories,

4131
02:07:04,321 --> 02:07:07,770
but I don't know what in relation
to how many people go down there,

4132
02:07:07,771 --> 02:07:08,604
those stories,

4133
02:07:08,930 --> 02:07:09,270
you know,

4134
02:07:09,270 --> 02:07:12,450
I don't know the statistics and
obviously there's some risk,

4135
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:16,560
but there's also tons of people who are
going through a bunch of people in our

4136
02:07:16,561 --> 02:07:19,560
group that did it and refined bunch of
people go down there all the time and do

4137
02:07:19,561 --> 02:07:20,071
it and they're fine.

4138
02:07:20,071 --> 02:07:22,140
It's not like if a lot of people
were getting sick from that,

4139
02:07:22,141 --> 02:07:23,310
they'd cut that out of the program.

4140
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:23,461
Yeah,

4141
02:07:23,461 --> 02:07:24,271
that's what I'm saying.

4142
02:07:24,271 --> 02:07:26,460
It's like people worry about
it and the worry about malaria,

4143
02:07:26,461 --> 02:07:27,570
like maybe,

4144
02:07:27,571 --> 02:07:27,841
yeah,

4145
02:07:27,841 --> 02:07:29,550
but do you know how many
fucking people going down there?

4146
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:31,860
There's a lot of God damn people
going down there on a regular,

4147
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:32,641
uh,

4148
02:07:32,641 --> 02:07:33,660
Justin wren.

4149
02:07:33,930 --> 02:07:34,290
Um,

4150
02:07:34,290 --> 02:07:34,651
he,

4151
02:07:34,651 --> 02:07:34,801
uh,

4152
02:07:34,801 --> 02:07:36,130
is a UFC fighter then,

4153
02:07:36,140 --> 02:07:36,580
uh,

4154
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:37,210
went down there.

4155
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:38,470
You guys send them a bunch of stuff.

4156
02:07:39,310 --> 02:07:44,100
He's into Alpha brain and he's the one
who's got that fight for the forgotten

4157
02:07:44,110 --> 02:07:45,820
charity for the people of the Congo.

4158
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:46,841
And,

4159
02:07:46,841 --> 02:07:47,020
uh,

4160
02:07:47,020 --> 02:07:49,420
he got crazy sick down there.

4161
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:52,990
He got some sort of horrible
in the Congo jungle bug.

4162
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:53,853
Yeah.

4163
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:56,800
I mean typhoid fever
or something like that.

4164
02:07:56,801 --> 02:07:58,430
Something nutty like that on gay fever.

4165
02:07:58,470 --> 02:07:59,051
But whatever.

4166
02:07:59,051 --> 02:07:59,350
Yeah,

4167
02:07:59,350 --> 02:07:59,741
it might've been,

4168
02:07:59,741 --> 02:08:00,410
that would have,

4169
02:08:00,410 --> 02:08:00,911
I was like,

4170
02:08:00,911 --> 02:08:01,960
he was on death's door,

4171
02:08:02,020 --> 02:08:02,853
like

4172
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:03,750
really fucked him up.

4173
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:05,850
You gotta be careful in some
places are worse than others.

4174
02:08:05,851 --> 02:08:07,320
Peru is in that kind of,

4175
02:08:07,350 --> 02:08:08,400
that still happens,

4176
02:08:08,401 --> 02:08:09,600
but it's still pretty benign.

4177
02:08:09,601 --> 02:08:10,860
And especially in this area,

4178
02:08:10,970 --> 02:08:15,140
that's a scary thing when you were running
a bug that can kill people like a flu

4179
02:08:15,141 --> 02:08:15,660
that,

4180
02:08:15,660 --> 02:08:16,070
you know,

4181
02:08:16,070 --> 02:08:17,010
it's just so,

4182
02:08:17,090 --> 02:08:19,400
it feels like a flu that's so much
more powerful than anything you've

4183
02:08:19,401 --> 02:08:20,001
experienced before.

4184
02:08:20,001 --> 02:08:20,300
You're like,

4185
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:21,133
Oh shit,

4186
02:08:21,140 --> 02:08:22,580
I might not get out of this one.

4187
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:24,090
That's what I was,

4188
02:08:24,090 --> 02:08:25,320
that's what I was terrified of.

4189
02:08:25,350 --> 02:08:29,160
And that's what was the resistance that
almost prevented me from having what I

4190
02:08:29,161 --> 02:08:30,930
will credit is the
greatest week of my life.

4191
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:31,973
Um,

4192
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:35,300
it almost stopped me from doing it and
obviously it's a week out and I'm healthy

4193
02:08:35,310 --> 02:08:36,120
as fuck.

4194
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:36,721
And you know,

4195
02:08:36,721 --> 02:08:37,540
I made,

4196
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:37,911
you know,

4197
02:08:37,911 --> 02:08:40,230
I assuredly the absolute right choice and,

4198
02:08:40,231 --> 02:08:41,064
and worked out,

4199
02:08:41,310 --> 02:08:41,660
but it is.

4200
02:08:41,660 --> 02:08:42,091
But again,

4201
02:08:42,091 --> 02:08:45,480
so that was kind of the message that you
just have a bunch of these choices and

4202
02:08:45,481 --> 02:08:50,280
accurately assessing danger versus your
fears and everything that you pile on

4203
02:08:50,281 --> 02:08:51,870
top is the key.

4204
02:08:52,350 --> 02:08:54,930
So we're approaching like the place
we're going to do the afternoon,

4205
02:08:55,120 --> 02:08:55,381
you know,

4206
02:08:55,381 --> 02:08:56,071
landing spot,

4207
02:08:56,071 --> 02:08:58,260
which is just kind of sky
deck overlooking the jungle.

4208
02:08:58,740 --> 02:09:02,040
And I wanted to take my shoes
off as I walked up there.

4209
02:09:02,041 --> 02:09:02,940
So I just fucking did it.

4210
02:09:02,941 --> 02:09:03,810
I took my shoes off,

4211
02:09:03,811 --> 02:09:06,000
didn't worry about the
mosquitoes and that felt great.

4212
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,950
Just feeling the grass
and the mud on my feet.

4213
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:08,850
It was a short walk.

4214
02:09:08,851 --> 02:09:11,280
So there wasn't any crazy
shit going on in the,

4215
02:09:11,580 --> 02:09:13,110
in the brush or anything
I had to worry about.

4216
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:16,170
We get up there and um,

4217
02:09:16,230 --> 02:09:18,420
I go to lie down and I'd taken again,

4218
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:19,930
I had taken the most watching,

4219
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:22,740
might taken at any point ever.

4220
02:09:22,741 --> 02:09:26,070
So I'm more blasted than I had been the
whole trip because I got eight ounces

4221
02:09:26,071 --> 02:09:26,904
instead of sick.

4222
02:09:27,450 --> 02:09:31,950
And I go to lie down and I'm pondering
this idea of choice a lot and fears and

4223
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:32,250
you know,

4224
02:09:32,250 --> 02:09:33,990
feeling pretty good because
everything that's happened,

4225
02:09:33,991 --> 02:09:37,870
I was passed these tests and I see this
little ant crawling towards me to am my

4226
02:09:37,871 --> 02:09:38,704
ride inside.

4227
02:09:39,030 --> 02:09:39,750
And I look and I go,

4228
02:09:39,750 --> 02:09:40,201
fuck,

4229
02:09:40,201 --> 02:09:41,130
there's an coming.

4230
02:09:41,250 --> 02:09:43,320
And so I totally broke
my train of thought,

4231
02:09:43,530 --> 02:09:44,520
stood straight up,

4232
02:09:44,910 --> 02:09:47,340
and then I look back at that
end and I just realized,

4233
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:48,330
Holy Shit,

4234
02:09:48,510 --> 02:09:53,510
I just let that little fucking aunt have
the power over me to make me sit up,

4235
02:09:54,150 --> 02:09:58,170
lose my train of consciousness
and completely move on his behalf.

4236
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:00,840
And it wasn't like a deadly
poison and it was just an ant.

4237
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:02,760
And I then I thought to myself,

4238
02:10:02,790 --> 02:10:07,110
how many other of these little things
that are truly ants in our existence,

4239
02:10:07,350 --> 02:10:07,921
fears,

4240
02:10:07,921 --> 02:10:08,530
worries,

4241
02:10:08,530 --> 02:10:10,290
Paranoia's relationships?

4242
02:10:10,291 --> 02:10:13,700
Did you feel crunchy about in
this certain way or crunch?

4243
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:18,150
Like something that's uncomfortable
to you in a situation or that you're

4244
02:10:18,151 --> 02:10:22,020
projecting and you're simulator is worried
about these little things that went

4245
02:10:22,021 --> 02:10:24,480
in reality or no more than these ants,

4246
02:10:24,481 --> 02:10:25,470
which are harmless,

4247
02:10:26,010 --> 02:10:28,050
caused you to make,

4248
02:10:28,110 --> 02:10:31,060
to choose actions that
aren't in your best interest.

4249
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:31,680
You know,

4250
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:32,010
and we,

4251
02:10:32,010 --> 02:10:33,710
because we give power,

4252
02:10:33,860 --> 02:10:36,320
we give them the power
over us to make us move.

4253
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:37,393
They do have it.

4254
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:37,851
Well,

4255
02:10:37,851 --> 02:10:42,851
I think it's what we were discussing
before that it relates to this is that you

4256
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:48,220
truly can't appreciate your freedom unless
you're in some sort of a struggle to

4257
02:10:49,131 --> 02:10:49,964
maintain it.

4258
02:10:50,130 --> 02:10:51,380
It's a very strange thing.

4259
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:52,190
Um,

4260
02:10:52,190 --> 02:10:53,900
and that these,

4261
02:10:54,020 --> 02:10:57,110
these things that you're
saying have this power over us,

4262
02:10:57,111 --> 02:10:58,310
we give them this power.

4263
02:10:58,670 --> 02:11:03,670
They're also causing massive amounts
of self examination and assessments.

4264
02:11:03,950 --> 02:11:06,860
Why there's this conflict
in the first place.

4265
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:07,880
When you're conscious,

4266
02:11:08,270 --> 02:11:12,260
there's lessons to be learned in conflict
and that you realize the futility of

4267
02:11:12,261 --> 02:11:13,094
conflict.

4268
02:11:13,190 --> 02:11:14,990
And I think without those lessons,

4269
02:11:14,991 --> 02:11:18,290
when people are trying to nerf the world
and avoid all the con the conflicts,

4270
02:11:18,650 --> 02:11:19,190
we,

4271
02:11:19,190 --> 02:11:23,930
we lose the actual lessons that are
available in these life experiences.

4272
02:11:23,931 --> 02:11:28,520
And these lessons of understanding
the repercussions of shitty behavior,

4273
02:11:28,790 --> 02:11:32,270
the these understanding what true
violence is really all about.

4274
02:11:32,420 --> 02:11:34,220
Understanding how it can be turned around,

4275
02:11:34,250 --> 02:11:35,030
understanding,

4276
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:38,480
watching guys hug it out after they have
a fist fight for fucking 10 minutes and

4277
02:11:38,481 --> 02:11:39,500
respect each other for it.

4278
02:11:39,650 --> 02:11:41,060
And I'm not saying you should do that,

4279
02:11:41,210 --> 02:11:43,040
but there's a reality of that.

4280
02:11:43,041 --> 02:11:44,000
Them hugging it out,

4281
02:11:44,001 --> 02:11:44,211
they're like,

4282
02:11:44,211 --> 02:11:44,391
okay,

4283
02:11:44,391 --> 02:11:45,530
well on a microcosm,

4284
02:11:45,531 --> 02:11:46,364
this works.

4285
02:11:46,700 --> 02:11:49,100
Like why can't this work
for the whole human race?

4286
02:11:49,101 --> 02:11:50,060
Because if we go to war,

4287
02:11:50,061 --> 02:11:50,960
there's no hugging,

4288
02:11:51,350 --> 02:11:51,651
you know?

4289
02:11:51,651 --> 02:11:54,020
But sometimes after you
Duke it out with each other,

4290
02:11:54,021 --> 02:11:55,520
you realize how ridiculous it is.

4291
02:11:55,550 --> 02:11:57,770
And that's better than war,

4292
02:11:58,070 --> 02:11:58,431
you know?

4293
02:11:58,431 --> 02:12:02,090
And people who would think that that's
savagery or that we don't understand and

4294
02:12:02,091 --> 02:12:05,150
like we'd have to stop all this
horrible shit that's going on.

4295
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:05,360
Yeah,

4296
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:08,180
we should definitely
encourage everyone to be nice.

4297
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:10,220
But along the way,

4298
02:12:10,250 --> 02:12:13,160
the errors are where we're going to learn.

4299
02:12:13,730 --> 02:12:14,570
And that's a,

4300
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:18,320
it's an integral part of
developing human consciousness.

4301
02:12:18,530 --> 02:12:20,090
It's a very important part.

4302
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:23,150
The conflict is there so
that you can learn from it.

4303
02:12:23,330 --> 02:12:24,051
It's not there.

4304
02:12:24,051 --> 02:12:26,900
So that it shapes your life
and defines your future though.

4305
02:12:27,140 --> 02:12:28,700
And that's where people get fucked up.

4306
02:12:28,940 --> 02:12:32,030
That's where bullying is so
horrible because it gives them a,

4307
02:12:32,370 --> 02:12:36,560
an equation that they can't emotionally
solve their left in this deficit that

4308
02:12:36,561 --> 02:12:38,240
they feel it's futile,

4309
02:12:38,330 --> 02:12:39,620
they can't pull out of it.

4310
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:41,540
And then they go into a
funk and it depression.

4311
02:12:41,810 --> 02:12:43,940
And it's because somewhere along the line,

4312
02:12:43,941 --> 02:12:47,240
someone almost in a way you
could say Stoller freedom.

4313
02:12:47,300 --> 02:12:47,660
Yeah,

4314
02:12:47,660 --> 02:12:48,770
stole their happiness.

4315
02:12:48,771 --> 02:12:49,700
They took it from them,

4316
02:12:49,701 --> 02:12:50,990
they took it from them with an act.

4317
02:12:51,410 --> 02:12:52,041
And you know,

4318
02:12:52,041 --> 02:12:56,780
I think we kind of recognize that as human
beings is just why rapists get beaten

4319
02:12:56,781 --> 02:12:57,620
up in prison.

4320
02:12:57,970 --> 02:12:58,310
You know?

4321
02:12:58,310 --> 02:12:58,521
I mean,

4322
02:12:58,521 --> 02:12:58,851
why,

4323
02:12:58,851 --> 02:13:02,690
why do they go after child molesters
in prison with such vicious,

4324
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:03,950
vicious attacks?

4325
02:13:04,190 --> 02:13:05,023
Because their rec,

4326
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:05,480
you

4327
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:06,560
took something sacred.

4328
02:13:06,561 --> 02:13:08,690
But ultimately you have the choice.

4329
02:13:08,691 --> 02:13:09,530
All of these people,

4330
02:13:09,531 --> 02:13:12,650
however difficult it may be
to take that freedom back.

4331
02:13:12,710 --> 02:13:13,310
You know,

4332
02:13:13,310 --> 02:13:13,610
and,

4333
02:13:13,610 --> 02:13:15,020
and whether you can do it,

4334
02:13:15,110 --> 02:13:17,450
maybe you can't do it in action.

4335
02:13:17,451 --> 02:13:21,680
Maybe you're going to be subject to
somebody's doing something bad to you.

4336
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:24,770
But you can always decide and
not saying it's fucking easy.

4337
02:13:24,771 --> 02:13:25,670
Not Saying I can do it,

4338
02:13:25,671 --> 02:13:26,180
whatever.

4339
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:28,700
But you can always decide
how you let that affect you.

4340
02:13:28,820 --> 02:13:33,780
Whether that's simply an impetus of pain
or whether that deeply changes you and

4341
02:13:33,781 --> 02:13:34,614
is suffering.

4342
02:13:34,680 --> 02:13:38,130
And you see that accounts from different
people who've handled POW camps.

4343
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:38,850
You know,

4344
02:13:38,850 --> 02:13:40,560
they're stuck in the fucking POW camp.

4345
02:13:40,561 --> 02:13:41,394
You can't escape.

4346
02:13:41,670 --> 02:13:43,050
And for some people or in,

4347
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:43,351
you know,

4348
02:13:43,351 --> 02:13:44,370
in Auschwitz you see,

4349
02:13:44,371 --> 02:13:45,061
or you know,

4350
02:13:45,061 --> 02:13:47,040
different survivors talking
about different things.

4351
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:48,120
Some of them,

4352
02:13:48,510 --> 02:13:49,320
you know,

4353
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:54,320
it was pure suffering and they took
every single fiber of their humanity from

4354
02:13:54,810 --> 02:13:55,441
these people.

4355
02:13:55,441 --> 02:13:59,790
And some people were able to make a
choice that all they're doing is creating

4356
02:13:59,791 --> 02:14:00,211
pain.

4357
02:14:00,211 --> 02:14:01,650
But I'm going to keep my own,

4358
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:02,311
you know,

4359
02:14:02,311 --> 02:14:06,720
my own sacred autonomy of what my
feelings towards that are going to be.

4360
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:08,160
And at the very end,

4361
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:12,240
that's the ultimate choice that we
always have is maybe we can't control the

4362
02:14:12,241 --> 02:14:13,410
input that's coming in,

4363
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:16,530
but we can control our
attitude towards it.

4364
02:14:16,531 --> 02:14:18,660
And that's the last thing
that nobody can take from us.

4365
02:14:18,740 --> 02:14:20,090
And most importantly,

4366
02:14:20,091 --> 02:14:24,470
we can control our output and our
output is someone else's input.

4367
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:29,920
And that's something that a lot of
people ignore or are not aware of when

4368
02:14:31,971 --> 02:14:35,900
they're doing something that ultimately
winds up being very damaging to

4369
02:14:35,901 --> 02:14:36,740
themselves.

4370
02:14:36,890 --> 02:14:40,850
They're not aware of the fact that
your output is someone else's input.

4371
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:44,270
And if you put something
out that's a negative,

4372
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:47,000
it's not going to come
back a positive ever.

4373
02:14:47,420 --> 02:14:48,290
It's just not,

4374
02:14:48,350 --> 02:14:49,520
it doesn't work that way.

4375
02:14:49,940 --> 02:14:51,200
If you put out a negative,

4376
02:14:51,350 --> 02:14:55,610
a negative that attacks a negative
just creates more negative.

4377
02:14:56,060 --> 02:14:57,500
It's just the only way it works.

4378
02:14:57,620 --> 02:14:58,970
And sometimes it's the only way.

4379
02:14:59,230 --> 02:15:01,580
That's the other problem
with being a human being.

4380
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:06,290
Sometimes you're walking down an alley
and there's a bunch of people that are

4381
02:15:06,291 --> 02:15:09,170
going to fuck with you and there's
nothing you can do about it.

4382
02:15:09,171 --> 02:15:11,090
You can either let them beat you up,

4383
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:12,050
you could fight,

4384
02:15:12,080 --> 02:15:13,040
you could run,

4385
02:15:13,190 --> 02:15:13,520
you could,

4386
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:16,400
but you're going to have to
deal with a real live situation.

4387
02:15:16,610 --> 02:15:18,680
So there's no black or white in this.

4388
02:15:18,681 --> 02:15:21,440
Crazy world is not everything
that happens to you,

4389
02:15:21,441 --> 02:15:23,600
manifested with your
imagination and your intent.

4390
02:15:23,630 --> 02:15:24,200
No,

4391
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:24,861
but a lot.

4392
02:15:24,861 --> 02:15:25,694
Yes.

4393
02:15:25,970 --> 02:15:26,301
You know,

4394
02:15:26,301 --> 02:15:27,081
it's not everything.

4395
02:15:27,081 --> 02:15:27,381
No.

4396
02:15:27,381 --> 02:15:32,381
But why a lot of it is how much work can
you get done in your lifetime to make

4397
02:15:33,021 --> 02:15:37,430
sure that less people experience
bad things in their lifetimes.

4398
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:39,020
That is a real ripple.

4399
02:15:39,170 --> 02:15:42,290
And that ripple effect is happening
right now from someone listening to this

4400
02:15:42,291 --> 02:15:44,000
Garr Ron fucking deed.

4401
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:45,590
I'm listening to your story,

4402
02:15:45,591 --> 02:15:48,800
listening to your depictions coincide
and then with their own instincts and

4403
02:15:48,801 --> 02:15:49,320
feelings,

4404
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:52,610
maybe a few experiences that they've
had and then choosing an ethic,

4405
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:53,390
you know,

4406
02:15:53,390 --> 02:15:58,390
and that that idea and that choice of
choosing an ethic can change the future,

4407
02:15:58,730 --> 02:16:01,070
can change the experiences
that people have.

4408
02:16:01,250 --> 02:16:01,970
You know,

4409
02:16:01,970 --> 02:16:06,560
if you look back on history and you look
back at the horrific things that the

4410
02:16:06,561 --> 02:16:11,060
Romans did and the Spartans did and all
these people did when they were going to

4411
02:16:11,061 --> 02:16:12,440
war with some other people.

4412
02:16:12,590 --> 02:16:17,590
If you look back at just the mounds of
awful stories that we could just go back

4413
02:16:18,171 --> 02:16:23,171
and find out about all the different
slayings that the Mongol Empire took part

4414
02:16:24,321 --> 02:16:26,900
in that the Romans took part in that the,

4415
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:29,000
I mean just over and over and over again.

4416
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:30,550
History of these horrific,

4417
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:33,970
terrifying acts of humanity and,

4418
02:16:35,050 --> 02:16:38,020
and think about what it would be
like if we didn't know about those.

4419
02:16:38,980 --> 02:16:41,050
Think about what if they
happen and we didn't learn.

4420
02:16:41,590 --> 02:16:42,430
Think about what,

4421
02:16:43,180 --> 02:16:43,391
well,

4422
02:16:43,391 --> 02:16:45,880
it's terrible that they have
in it is definitely terrible,

4423
02:16:45,910 --> 02:16:50,380
but that we know that that
can happen ever is important.

4424
02:16:51,520 --> 02:16:56,520
It's important that we know that this
whole thing is just this chaotic scramble

4425
02:16:56,951 --> 02:16:59,170
for recognition of the state of,

4426
02:16:59,240 --> 02:17:00,041
of consciousness.

4427
02:17:00,041 --> 02:17:01,530
We're in this chaotic channel.

4428
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:02,081
What's going on?

4429
02:17:02,081 --> 02:17:02,801
This is my land,

4430
02:17:02,801 --> 02:17:03,610
that's my pussy,

4431
02:17:03,610 --> 02:17:04,570
this is my goal.

4432
02:17:04,630 --> 02:17:05,290
Oh my heart,

4433
02:17:05,290 --> 02:17:05,770
start,

4434
02:17:05,770 --> 02:17:06,280
boom,

4435
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:07,900
and then start all over again.

4436
02:17:08,110 --> 02:17:12,550
And then new bodies and your genes
pass onto another new meat vehicle.

4437
02:17:12,551 --> 02:17:16,060
It's carrying consciousness and it tries
to deal with all the stupid shit that

4438
02:17:16,061 --> 02:17:17,020
you taught it and like,

4439
02:17:17,021 --> 02:17:17,381
oh my God,

4440
02:17:17,381 --> 02:17:20,290
this mother fucker was wrong about
almost everything and now my heart stops.

4441
02:17:20,380 --> 02:17:21,010
Boom.

4442
02:17:21,010 --> 02:17:24,100
And then you hope that you taught your
kids a little something so they can,

4443
02:17:24,130 --> 02:17:26,440
like my dad was semi
retired most of his life,

4444
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:29,890
but he told me when he started getting
older they realize the maze and he saw

4445
02:17:29,891 --> 02:17:30,261
that the,

4446
02:17:30,261 --> 02:17:32,560
the puzzle was ridiculous
because there's no solution.

4447
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:33,850
And in the moment the,

4448
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:34,601
this is the key,

4449
02:17:34,601 --> 02:17:35,890
the key is staying in the moment.

4450
02:17:35,980 --> 02:17:38,770
And then he died and then you
remember that from the jump.

4451
02:17:38,771 --> 02:17:39,910
So you go through life,

4452
02:17:39,911 --> 02:17:41,830
it's like quiet Chang Caine was a,

4453
02:17:41,831 --> 02:17:42,560
you know,

4454
02:17:42,560 --> 02:17:47,320
a modern day cell phone and
you try to figure out your,

4455
02:17:47,321 --> 02:17:48,940
your interaction with
all these people run.

4456
02:17:48,940 --> 02:17:51,490
But that we're a part
of this crazy ripple.

4457
02:17:51,580 --> 02:17:53,410
It just doesn't seem like
it because we're in it.

4458
02:17:53,620 --> 02:17:57,130
It doesn't seem like it because we're a
part of it cause it's just life to us.

4459
02:17:57,310 --> 02:17:57,581
It's,

4460
02:17:57,581 --> 02:17:59,560
you know what happens today
while I get up in the morning,

4461
02:17:59,561 --> 02:18:02,020
I turn on my computer and I find
out what's happening in the world.

4462
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:03,370
Where's the new stories?

4463
02:18:03,371 --> 02:18:03,851
Where's the tea?

4464
02:18:03,851 --> 02:18:04,684
That's what I do.

4465
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:05,211
But what,

4466
02:18:05,211 --> 02:18:05,981
what is that?

4467
02:18:05,981 --> 02:18:06,311
What is,

4468
02:18:06,311 --> 02:18:08,050
what does anything that you do in life,

4469
02:18:08,051 --> 02:18:09,790
what are any of these
patterns that you follow?

4470
02:18:09,791 --> 02:18:10,810
Are there any of these things you do?

4471
02:18:11,170 --> 02:18:13,750
It's just consciousness expressing itself,

4472
02:18:13,751 --> 02:18:18,160
trying to figure out what the fuck is
going on and trying to make and some sort

4473
02:18:18,161 --> 02:18:21,370
of an account of all the things that
are going on around you all the time.

4474
02:18:21,470 --> 02:18:21,680
Yeah.

4475
02:18:21,680 --> 02:18:22,750
Cause there's so many of them.

4476
02:18:23,230 --> 02:18:24,480
And then so these

4477
02:18:24,480 --> 02:18:28,950
things that seem to happen automatically
until you find a point where you

4478
02:18:28,951 --> 02:18:30,870
finally get to that ultimate stillness.

4479
02:18:30,900 --> 02:18:32,220
And you can do that in a float tank.

4480
02:18:32,430 --> 02:18:34,410
You can do that in a medicine journey.

4481
02:18:34,411 --> 02:18:36,480
You can do that in good
meditation or even yoga,

4482
02:18:36,810 --> 02:18:37,141
but to,

4483
02:18:37,141 --> 02:18:40,230
in order to properly chart
your course at any level,

4484
02:18:40,231 --> 02:18:41,790
you have to find that stillness.

4485
02:18:41,970 --> 02:18:46,230
But then the next level beyond that was
right where I'm at here in this story.

4486
02:18:46,530 --> 02:18:49,050
So Don Howard comes over
to me and he starts,

4487
02:18:49,220 --> 02:18:49,440
you know,

4488
02:18:49,440 --> 02:18:49,801
doing it,

4489
02:18:49,801 --> 02:18:50,041
seeing,

4490
02:18:50,041 --> 02:18:54,780
asked me to Neil and he starts using the
feather over my head and I could feel

4491
02:18:54,810 --> 02:18:57,540
like a weird transformation
happening in my body.

4492
02:18:57,541 --> 02:19:01,110
This kind of invincibility that
I started to feel at that moment.

4493
02:19:01,740 --> 02:19:06,740
And it was this strange
kind of feeling of,

4494
02:19:06,751 --> 02:19:10,000
I was kind of crouched over the top of
the jungle and I started to feel like it

4495
02:19:10,030 --> 02:19:11,880
Kinda like a rumble in my throat,

4496
02:19:11,881 --> 02:19:15,900
almost like a growl and I could
feel like my toes start to grip in.

4497
02:19:16,440 --> 02:19:21,120
And it was almost like I was transforming
myself then into this big cat that was

4498
02:19:21,121 --> 02:19:24,540
out looking over the jungle
and had absolutely no fear,

4499
02:19:24,830 --> 02:19:25,081
you know,

4500
02:19:25,081 --> 02:19:25,651
nothing.

4501
02:19:25,651 --> 02:19:27,560
The mosquitoes couldn't hurt me,

4502
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:30,200
my other fears wouldn't bother me.

4503
02:19:30,380 --> 02:19:31,940
Death was no threat,

4504
02:19:32,210 --> 02:19:32,511
you know,

4505
02:19:32,511 --> 02:19:34,490
like nothing at that very moment,

4506
02:19:34,730 --> 02:19:35,240
you know,

4507
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:36,500
could actually harm me.

4508
02:19:36,860 --> 02:19:39,710
And I realized at that
bleeding edge of invincibility,

4509
02:19:39,711 --> 02:19:41,390
at that bleeding edge of fearlessness,

4510
02:19:41,391 --> 02:19:42,470
not that a bullet couldn't kill me,

4511
02:19:42,471 --> 02:19:43,490
I'm not trying to be crazy,

4512
02:19:43,730 --> 02:19:45,680
but how I felt then,

4513
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:46,460
you know,

4514
02:19:46,460 --> 02:19:47,990
was completely without fear.

4515
02:19:47,991 --> 02:19:49,370
For the very first time in my life,

4516
02:19:49,820 --> 02:19:52,130
absolutely nothing scared me.

4517
02:19:52,610 --> 02:19:56,900
And at that point that I realized that
was the only time I've ever had complete

4518
02:19:56,901 --> 02:20:01,901
free will because only at the very edge
of your fearlessness is nothing pushing,

4519
02:20:02,901 --> 02:20:03,710
pulling you,

4520
02:20:03,710 --> 02:20:04,543
prodding you,

4521
02:20:04,670 --> 02:20:04,881
you know,

4522
02:20:04,881 --> 02:20:08,210
you have no attachments to anything cause
you're not afraid of losing anything

4523
02:20:08,480 --> 02:20:10,790
because losing anything wouldn't hurt you.

4524
02:20:11,030 --> 02:20:11,241
You know,

4525
02:20:11,241 --> 02:20:12,770
you're completely fearless at that.

4526
02:20:12,771 --> 02:20:14,330
I was completely fearless at that point.

4527
02:20:15,020 --> 02:20:17,870
And that was the very first
time I had complete free will.

4528
02:20:18,140 --> 02:20:20,840
And that feeling is
something I'll never forget,

4529
02:20:20,870 --> 02:20:21,201
you know?

4530
02:20:21,201 --> 02:20:25,460
And I realized that all of these people
that talk about the determinism of life,

4531
02:20:25,490 --> 02:20:25,701
oh,

4532
02:20:25,701 --> 02:20:26,331
it's genetic.

4533
02:20:26,331 --> 02:20:27,470
So it's environment and it's,

4534
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:28,670
you know,

4535
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:32,750
there's a place that you can get to where
you have absolute choice and maybe you

4536
02:20:32,751 --> 02:20:33,620
can't stay there.

4537
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:35,630
Not saying that I'm like that now.

4538
02:20:35,631 --> 02:20:35,911
I mean,

4539
02:20:35,911 --> 02:20:36,290
uh,

4540
02:20:36,290 --> 02:20:41,060
but I can remember that fucking place
and I can remember being completely 100%

4541
02:20:41,061 --> 02:20:45,500
fearless and knowing that I could choose
anything I wanted in my life and it

4542
02:20:45,501 --> 02:20:47,570
would be my authentic choice.

4543
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:48,471
Not pushed.

4544
02:20:48,471 --> 02:20:50,540
You're prodded by any other factor.

4545
02:20:51,020 --> 02:20:55,070
And that was perhaps the greatest
gift I've ever gotten in my life.

4546
02:20:55,071 --> 02:20:59,030
And one of the reasons why this trip
was maybe the best thing I've ever done.

4547
02:20:59,210 --> 02:21:00,470
That's some deep shits on.

4548
02:21:00,590 --> 02:21:01,010
Yeah,

4549
02:21:01,010 --> 02:21:01,371
I'm all,

4550
02:21:01,371 --> 02:21:02,151
I'm taking it all in.

4551
02:21:02,151 --> 02:21:02,984
Right?

4552
02:21:03,140 --> 02:21:04,070
That's some deep shit.

4553
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:05,650
I want that.

4554
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:07,640
That conversation is very puzzling to me.

4555
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:09,470
And I've heard people,

4556
02:21:10,220 --> 02:21:11,260
some people say that it's,

4557
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:12,140
it's very simple.

4558
02:21:12,141 --> 02:21:12,974
It's very simple.

4559
02:21:12,980 --> 02:21:14,540
Free wills doesn't exist.

4560
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:15,111
It's very simple.

4561
02:21:15,111 --> 02:21:17,120
It can be proven and proven by tests.

4562
02:21:17,650 --> 02:21:18,220
Well

4563
02:21:18,220 --> 02:21:19,990
then how come you decided to go on a diet?

4564
02:21:20,500 --> 02:21:21,370
Like what happened there?

4565
02:21:21,371 --> 02:21:21,491
I,

4566
02:21:21,491 --> 02:21:21,821
you know,

4567
02:21:21,821 --> 02:21:26,410
and I know this is a retarded version
of the actual events and I know that

4568
02:21:26,411 --> 02:21:30,640
they're scientifically proved in
some form or fashion that you,

4569
02:21:30,670 --> 02:21:34,570
your decisions are decided for
you before you ever decide them.

4570
02:21:35,530 --> 02:21:36,363
Uh,

4571
02:21:36,460 --> 02:21:37,293
not buying it.

4572
02:21:38,050 --> 02:21:38,760
I don't know how the fuck,

4573
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:40,590
you know when someone decided it,

4574
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:45,550
part of their brain was lit up or an
impulse and you know that that represents

4575
02:21:45,551 --> 02:21:50,380
consciousness to 100% extent that you
know that that's not the origin of the

4576
02:21:50,381 --> 02:21:51,340
very thought itself,

4577
02:21:51,490 --> 02:21:54,640
that it comes and ripples and affects
different states of the mind at different

4578
02:21:54,641 --> 02:21:55,830
times in the decision.

4579
02:21:56,040 --> 02:21:57,520
Like are you absolutely sure?

4580
02:21:57,670 --> 02:21:59,350
I do not believe that the,

4581
02:21:59,351 --> 02:21:59,651
the,

4582
02:21:59,651 --> 02:22:02,050
the data is like that conclusive yet.

4583
02:22:02,170 --> 02:22:03,700
And from what I experienced,

4584
02:22:03,701 --> 02:22:05,770
I can fucking tell you with assurity,

4585
02:22:05,771 --> 02:22:09,160
I would put anything on the line
that that is fucking nonsense.

4586
02:22:09,190 --> 02:22:09,641
By the way.

4587
02:22:09,641 --> 02:22:10,960
I have no idea what I'm talking about.

4588
02:22:11,050 --> 02:22:13,180
A know nothing about neuroscience.

4589
02:22:13,420 --> 02:22:15,550
So everything I say
saying they six seconds,

4590
02:22:15,551 --> 02:22:17,410
they're saying that
six seconds for choice,

4591
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:18,850
six seconds before a choice,

4592
02:22:18,851 --> 02:22:20,020
something triggers in the brain.

4593
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:21,410
But how is that possible?

4594
02:22:21,411 --> 02:22:23,320
If there's some choices
that you make immediately,

4595
02:22:23,321 --> 02:22:24,400
they're less than six seconds.

4596
02:22:24,401 --> 02:22:25,234
Yeah.

4597
02:22:25,470 --> 02:22:26,130
It doesn't make

4598
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:26,760
any sense.

4599
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:27,150
Shit.

4600
02:22:27,150 --> 02:22:27,983
No.

4601
02:22:28,770 --> 02:22:29,281
What is that?

4602
02:22:29,281 --> 02:22:30,070
Is that freewill?

4603
02:22:30,070 --> 02:22:30,290
Yeah.

4604
02:22:30,290 --> 02:22:32,370
No it's and there's no
free will come on son.

4605
02:22:32,430 --> 02:22:36,150
From what I experienced there is fucking
freewill and robbing people of that.

4606
02:22:36,270 --> 02:22:39,720
Robin is one of the things
that are the most detrimental.

4607
02:22:39,820 --> 02:22:40,900
I think it's a semantic,

4608
02:22:40,901 --> 02:22:41,230
sorry,

4609
02:22:41,230 --> 02:22:46,230
our argument because I think the idea
of is there a completely free will?

4610
02:22:47,110 --> 02:22:49,090
Well then what is it?

4611
02:22:49,091 --> 02:22:50,950
What are you saying when
you're saying freewill?

4612
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:51,341
I mean,

4613
02:22:51,341 --> 02:22:53,410
are you free of emotional baggage?

4614
02:22:53,420 --> 02:22:54,940
Are you free of memory?

4615
02:22:54,941 --> 02:22:57,550
Are you free of genetic memory fears,

4616
02:22:57,790 --> 02:23:00,910
all sorts of phobias that may or may
not have been passed down through your

4617
02:23:00,911 --> 02:23:04,000
fucking DNA and you don't even
know why you're crazy about them.

4618
02:23:04,300 --> 02:23:05,260
Are you free of all that?

4619
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:05,830
No ma'am.

4620
02:23:05,830 --> 02:23:06,663
Not necessarily,

4621
02:23:06,790 --> 02:23:08,290
but can you decide,

4622
02:23:08,291 --> 02:23:08,651
you know what?

4623
02:23:08,651 --> 02:23:09,520
Fuck this man,

4624
02:23:09,521 --> 02:23:10,420
I don't like this shit.

4625
02:23:10,421 --> 02:23:12,010
I need to get my fucking life in order.

4626
02:23:12,100 --> 02:23:13,840
Can you make a choice?

4627
02:23:14,020 --> 02:23:14,810
Write something down.

4628
02:23:14,810 --> 02:23:15,220
Make a choice.

4629
02:23:15,220 --> 02:23:15,850
What is that?

4630
02:23:15,850 --> 02:23:16,601
That's not free will.

4631
02:23:16,601 --> 02:23:17,351
I don't understand it.

4632
02:23:17,351 --> 02:23:18,340
I understand your argument.

4633
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:21,910
I can understand what you're saying
about there's some things going on in the

4634
02:23:21,911 --> 02:23:26,911
brain that determined decisions before
the person believes they decided before

4635
02:23:28,211 --> 02:23:31,660
they actually have consciously
realize they decided,

4636
02:23:31,661 --> 02:23:32,980
but isn't that like what,

4637
02:23:32,981 --> 02:23:34,420
how a decision works?

4638
02:23:34,690 --> 02:23:35,920
I mean I obviously,

4639
02:23:36,160 --> 02:23:37,390
and I keep qualifying this,

4640
02:23:37,391 --> 02:23:38,800
but I am almost retarded,

4641
02:23:39,010 --> 02:23:42,670
but if you're having this
sort of conversation about
anything else other than

4642
02:23:42,671 --> 02:23:43,720
the human mind,

4643
02:23:43,900 --> 02:23:46,420
like if it was about a computer program,

4644
02:23:46,630 --> 02:23:47,710
it'd be pretty traceable.

4645
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:48,850
You'd be able to trace the code.

4646
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:51,250
You'll be able to see where
the sequence takes place,

4647
02:23:51,370 --> 02:23:52,060
where's the,

4648
02:23:52,060 --> 02:23:52,960
where's the variation,

4649
02:23:52,961 --> 02:23:53,681
what's going on,

4650
02:23:53,681 --> 02:23:56,110
where you could watch this
deviation or this path,

4651
02:23:56,530 --> 02:23:57,700
but with a human mind like,

4652
02:23:57,850 --> 02:23:58,451
God damn,

4653
02:23:58,451 --> 02:23:59,360
there's a lot going on.

4654
02:23:59,380 --> 02:24:01,330
It'd be in a person and making decisions,

4655
02:24:01,390 --> 02:24:02,440
changing your mind,

4656
02:24:02,470 --> 02:24:03,400
what's changing your mind?

4657
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:06,550
The thing that these neuroscientists
are failing to recognize is there's,

4658
02:24:06,551 --> 02:24:11,260
there is a human mind and the thing
these neuroscientists are failing to

4659
02:24:11,261 --> 02:24:12,350
recognize that'll be,

4660
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:13,193
that'll be a meme.

4661
02:24:13,570 --> 02:24:14,260
Well,

4662
02:24:14,260 --> 02:24:15,280
I think made me,

4663
02:24:15,281 --> 02:24:15,971
some of them do,

4664
02:24:15,971 --> 02:24:17,680
but I firmly believe and I've been,

4665
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:18,820
I've experienced this,

4666
02:24:18,821 --> 02:24:22,420
that there is the mind and then there's
another thing called consciousness and

4667
02:24:22,421 --> 02:24:23,320
that consciousness,

4668
02:24:23,590 --> 02:24:26,440
it works through the mind and
it's in your connected with it,

4669
02:24:26,620 --> 02:24:31,180
but it isn't just the mind and it's the
consciousness aspect of you where the

4670
02:24:31,181 --> 02:24:32,260
freewill resides.

4671
02:24:32,380 --> 02:24:37,380
So the neurologist neuroscientist may be
able to prove via the mind all of these

4672
02:24:37,421 --> 02:24:38,254
different facts,

4673
02:24:38,410 --> 02:24:40,270
but the consciousness is ineffable.

4674
02:24:40,460 --> 02:24:40,630
I,

4675
02:24:40,630 --> 02:24:41,080
um,

4676
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:42,730
I have a soft subject to test.

4677
02:24:42,850 --> 02:24:44,140
I have a similar take on it,

4678
02:24:44,141 --> 02:24:46,210
but slightly different in that,

4679
02:24:46,270 --> 02:24:46,990
um,

4680
02:24:46,990 --> 02:24:51,520
I do believe that the issue might be in
just labeling it something with these

4681
02:24:51,521 --> 02:24:52,900
feeble human words.

4682
02:24:52,901 --> 02:24:53,440
Sure.

4683
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:56,770
I think that might be the issue in
calling something consciousness at all.

4684
02:24:57,010 --> 02:25:00,730
I think whatever it is that you
experienced in the psychedelic state,

4685
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:05,050
you're not qualified to
describe and you're not
qualified to cast a judgement on

4686
02:25:05,051 --> 02:25:08,350
what revelations that you're a little
puny mind makes when you're over there

4687
02:25:08,620 --> 02:25:09,810
because you're in the EXP,

4688
02:25:09,850 --> 02:25:10,361
you're in the,

4689
02:25:10,361 --> 02:25:10,980
in the,

4690
02:25:10,980 --> 02:25:14,560
the face of something that's
so impossible to believe.

4691
02:25:14,710 --> 02:25:19,660
So impossible for the imagination to
conjure up that it defies all your silly

4692
02:25:19,661 --> 02:25:20,470
little words.

4693
02:25:20,470 --> 02:25:21,820
So when you start saying things like,

4694
02:25:22,030 --> 02:25:22,211
you know,

4695
02:25:22,211 --> 02:25:24,040
we start using in a sense

4696
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:29,040
that we use it to sort of laid down a
scaffolding of ideas so I can understand

4697
02:25:29,381 --> 02:25:30,280
what you're talking about.

4698
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:33,910
But I don't know what that means
and I don't think anybody does.

4699
02:25:33,911 --> 02:25:36,970
That's why someone who's been doing it
for 50 years isn't going to try and tell

4700
02:25:37,070 --> 02:25:37,903
you.

4701
02:25:38,020 --> 02:25:39,100
They just act to show you.

4702
02:25:39,250 --> 02:25:39,401
Yeah,

4703
02:25:39,401 --> 02:25:40,300
they don't need to like,

4704
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:41,830
this is consciousness,

4705
02:25:41,831 --> 02:25:42,940
but this is the soul.

4706
02:25:43,090 --> 02:25:43,923
Hey Man,

4707
02:25:43,930 --> 02:25:45,490
I'm not sure you're right.

4708
02:25:45,570 --> 02:25:45,820
You know,

4709
02:25:45,820 --> 02:25:47,830
I think the whole thing might be together,

4710
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:48,380
you know,

4711
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:50,070
and that we have these ideas of labor.

4712
02:25:50,071 --> 02:25:51,340
This is the human brain.

4713
02:25:51,341 --> 02:25:52,360
And guess what?

4714
02:25:52,361 --> 02:25:54,880
The human brain is
touching the whole thing.

4715
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:58,540
The human brain directly touches
the center of the fucking universe.

4716
02:25:58,750 --> 02:25:59,583
Do you know why?

4717
02:25:59,830 --> 02:26:01,840
Because there's no empty space.

4718
02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:03,160
Even in a vacuum.

4719
02:26:03,161 --> 02:26:04,300
There's stuff out there.

4720
02:26:04,301 --> 02:26:05,530
There's dark matter.

4721
02:26:05,531 --> 02:26:05,920
There's,

4722
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:08,020
there's fucking air on earth.

4723
02:26:08,140 --> 02:26:10,760
There's a direct connection
between some thing,

4724
02:26:10,761 --> 02:26:12,700
some Adam's,

4725
02:26:12,701 --> 02:26:14,010
some objects,

4726
02:26:14,011 --> 02:26:15,130
some physical,

4727
02:26:15,131 --> 02:26:16,090
some gas,

4728
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:17,980
some thing connects,

4729
02:26:18,010 --> 02:26:18,850
everything.

4730
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:22,960
This idea of space is a
really relative concept,

4731
02:26:23,240 --> 02:26:24,460
and if you really look at it,

4732
02:26:24,470 --> 02:26:24,640
no,

4733
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:24,791
no,

4734
02:26:24,791 --> 02:26:24,931
no,

4735
02:26:24,931 --> 02:26:25,051
no,

4736
02:26:25,051 --> 02:26:25,201
no,

4737
02:26:25,201 --> 02:26:25,510
no.

4738
02:26:25,510 --> 02:26:27,280
You're the bottom of the universe,

4739
02:26:27,281 --> 02:26:28,150
which is an ocean.

4740
02:26:28,720 --> 02:26:28,921
The,

4741
02:26:28,921 --> 02:26:29,360
Oh,

4742
02:26:29,360 --> 02:26:30,790
it's an infinite ocean.

4743
02:26:30,820 --> 02:26:32,980
It's the idea that there's all this air.

4744
02:26:33,190 --> 02:26:33,461
No,

4745
02:26:33,461 --> 02:26:33,791
there's just,

4746
02:26:33,791 --> 02:26:35,080
it's just different stuff.

4747
02:26:35,380 --> 02:26:36,910
Like it's still all connected.

4748
02:26:36,940 --> 02:26:39,010
The whole thing is a big soup,

4749
02:26:39,250 --> 02:26:39,910
the whole thing.

4750
02:26:39,910 --> 02:26:41,770
And you don't get away from the big soup,

4751
02:26:42,670 --> 02:26:43,960
the ecstasy of dichotomy.

4752
02:26:43,961 --> 02:26:44,090
Yeah.

4753
02:26:44,090 --> 02:26:44,320
I mean,

4754
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:44,901
this server,

4755
02:26:44,901 --> 02:26:46,630
that means gaps in the
cheese here and there,

4756
02:26:46,631 --> 02:26:48,780
but ultimately it's all connected.

4757
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:49,120
Connect,

4758
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:49,811
spiraled,

4759
02:26:49,811 --> 02:26:50,280
like,

4760
02:26:50,280 --> 02:26:50,620
you know,

4761
02:26:50,620 --> 02:26:50,801
I mean,

4762
02:26:50,801 --> 02:26:51,160
look,

4763
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:53,680
you can look at a fucking
sponge and you could say,

4764
02:26:53,681 --> 02:26:54,610
is that thing connected?

4765
02:26:54,611 --> 02:26:55,444
Well,

4766
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:56,081
I mean,

4767
02:26:56,081 --> 02:26:57,160
so there's a lot of holes in it.

4768
02:26:57,160 --> 02:26:57,280
You know,

4769
02:26:57,280 --> 02:26:57,791
this is a fucking,

4770
02:26:57,791 --> 02:26:58,601
it's connected.

4771
02:26:58,601 --> 02:26:59,970
There's a beginning and an end.

4772
02:26:59,980 --> 02:27:00,311
Shut up.

4773
02:27:00,311 --> 02:27:01,144
Stupid.

4774
02:27:01,660 --> 02:27:02,411
He'd get it wet.

4775
02:27:02,411 --> 02:27:03,400
The whole thing's getting wet.

4776
02:27:03,401 --> 02:27:04,330
It's fucking connected.

4777
02:27:04,331 --> 02:27:04,781
It doesn't matter.

4778
02:27:04,781 --> 02:27:05,614
Your holes are in there.

4779
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:08,870
That's you and the universe.

4780
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:13,870
That's you and the universe
are like I fucking sponge.

4781
02:27:13,871 --> 02:27:15,550
Like you're not getting
away with anything.

4782
02:27:15,790 --> 02:27:16,511
Your brain,

4783
02:27:16,511 --> 02:27:17,410
your consciousness,

4784
02:27:17,411 --> 02:27:18,244
your mind,

4785
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:19,480
they're all the same thing.

4786
02:27:19,930 --> 02:27:21,220
It's all the universe.

4787
02:27:21,460 --> 02:27:26,460
We just have compartmentalized our biology
and these very specific ways in our

4788
02:27:26,891 --> 02:27:28,750
attempt to understand
what the fuck is going on.

4789
02:27:28,900 --> 02:27:30,250
As we wake up at the front,

4790
02:27:30,490 --> 02:27:33,310
we'll have this spaceship
as it hurls into the sky.

4791
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:34,353
Like what is it?

4792
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:34,691
Okay,

4793
02:27:34,691 --> 02:27:35,410
this is the brain.

4794
02:27:35,410 --> 02:27:35,860
Agreed.

4795
02:27:35,860 --> 02:27:36,131
Okay.

4796
02:27:36,131 --> 02:27:36,910
It's all the brain.

4797
02:27:36,910 --> 02:27:40,480
The brain is independent of the spinal
cord and when the spinal cord is severed,

4798
02:27:40,520 --> 02:27:41,890
the brain can no longer communicate.

4799
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:42,490
I'll great.

4800
02:27:42,490 --> 02:27:43,210
Oh Great.

4801
02:27:43,210 --> 02:27:46,170
And we figured out how this
little biological creature works.

4802
02:27:46,171 --> 02:27:46,360
Boom.

4803
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:51,360
While this creature is just a reacting
part of the soup of the universe,

4804
02:27:51,790 --> 02:27:55,720
slowly getting to try to understand
itself during this very brief,

4805
02:27:55,900 --> 02:27:58,360
finite in obscure existence.

4806
02:27:58,361 --> 02:28:02,290
It's a part of the infinity and it's all
just popping off while you're trying to

4807
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:04,300
figure it out as it's happening.

4808
02:28:04,630 --> 02:28:05,261
That's us,

4809
02:28:05,261 --> 02:28:05,710
man.

4810
02:28:05,710 --> 02:28:06,430
Indeed.

4811
02:28:06,430 --> 02:28:07,210
Indeed.

4812
02:28:07,210 --> 02:28:11,800
Well I want to tell the story of the
[inaudible] cause that's the finals is the

4813
02:28:11,801 --> 02:28:12,551
DMT snuffs.

4814
02:28:12,551 --> 02:28:13,810
So we leave the thing,

4815
02:28:13,811 --> 02:28:15,010
the days of the other.

4816
02:28:15,310 --> 02:28:15,610
Yup.

4817
02:28:15,610 --> 02:28:16,810
So this is the same night.

4818
02:28:16,900 --> 02:28:17,950
So this is the same night.

4819
02:28:17,951 --> 02:28:18,940
So I leave the Aleve,

4820
02:28:18,941 --> 02:28:19,421
the temple.

4821
02:28:19,421 --> 02:28:19,730
I,

4822
02:28:19,730 --> 02:28:21,860
I'd felt myself feeling like a big cat

4823
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:23,720
and that feeling of fearlessness,

4824
02:28:23,721 --> 02:28:24,690
bleeding edge of freewill,

4825
02:28:24,710 --> 02:28:25,850
that experience go down.

4826
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:28,640
I'm feeling just fucking
amazing at this point.

4827
02:28:28,641 --> 02:28:28,971
I'm like,

4828
02:28:28,971 --> 02:28:29,211
wow,

4829
02:28:29,211 --> 02:28:30,044
this is awesome,

4830
02:28:30,170 --> 02:28:31,520
but I know we're going
to do the [inaudible].

4831
02:28:31,610 --> 02:28:34,760
And the way Don Howard
described it is he says,

4832
02:28:34,761 --> 02:28:34,950
you know,

4833
02:28:34,950 --> 02:28:36,920
tonight we get a chance to go home.

4834
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:38,960
And he just said it just like that.

4835
02:28:38,961 --> 02:28:39,250
And,

4836
02:28:39,250 --> 02:28:41,180
and he didn't need to
say much more than that,

4837
02:28:41,181 --> 02:28:42,170
but you knew that it was,

4838
02:28:42,370 --> 02:28:42,711
he's like,

4839
02:28:42,711 --> 02:28:43,491
if you do it right,

4840
02:28:43,491 --> 02:28:44,324
you'd go home.

4841
02:28:44,630 --> 02:28:45,201
And I was like,

4842
02:28:45,201 --> 02:28:45,620
whoa.

4843
02:28:45,620 --> 02:28:46,453
All right.

4844
02:28:46,670 --> 02:28:50,340
And at this point I had just such immense
faith in what he was doing that I,

4845
02:28:50,580 --> 02:28:50,901
I was like,

4846
02:28:50,901 --> 02:28:51,141
all right,

4847
02:28:51,141 --> 02:28:52,340
this is going to be pretty significant.

4848
02:28:52,460 --> 02:28:53,630
So walking into the hut,

4849
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:55,520
I put into practice what
I'd learned up there.

4850
02:28:55,700 --> 02:28:56,870
And usually on the way to the hut.

4851
02:28:56,900 --> 02:28:58,280
I was like someone,

4852
02:28:58,340 --> 02:28:58,551
you know,

4853
02:28:58,551 --> 02:29:02,450
scurrying from one Fox holder the other
cause I was worried about mosquitoes and

4854
02:29:02,451 --> 02:29:02,721
I was like,

4855
02:29:02,721 --> 02:29:06,680
I'm going to just walk into this
fucking hot at my pace when I want to.

4856
02:29:06,680 --> 02:29:08,360
I'm not going to let the
mosquitoes bother me.

4857
02:29:08,690 --> 02:29:11,460
And little choices like
that we're already wasted.

4858
02:29:11,510 --> 02:29:13,970
I was putting into practice
this knowledge that I got,

4859
02:29:13,971 --> 02:29:16,130
which is why I love to
watch humor so much.

4860
02:29:16,730 --> 02:29:17,960
So I take my time,

4861
02:29:18,050 --> 02:29:19,010
walk into the hut,

4862
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:20,593
take a seat.

4863
02:29:20,930 --> 02:29:21,763
And uh,

4864
02:29:21,770 --> 02:29:22,940
he brings out the,

4865
02:29:22,970 --> 02:29:23,803
the snuff,

4866
02:29:23,870 --> 02:29:25,580
the snuff tray in the snuff,

4867
02:29:25,810 --> 02:29:26,643
um,

4868
02:29:27,140 --> 02:29:28,280
tube basically.

4869
02:29:28,281 --> 02:29:30,470
But to snuff tube is not
just a normal snuff tube.

4870
02:29:30,770 --> 02:29:32,420
It's a 4,000 year old.

4871
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:32,681
Well,

4872
02:29:32,681 --> 02:29:34,940
it looks like a human metatarsal bone,

4873
02:29:35,180 --> 02:29:38,960
like a bone from the knuckle bone from
your foot that's hollowed down the center

4874
02:29:38,990 --> 02:29:42,430
that the shoving people themselves
had used to snuff the VILC,

4875
02:29:42,431 --> 02:29:42,770
uh,

4876
02:29:42,770 --> 02:29:43,401
some 30,

4877
02:29:43,401 --> 02:29:44,420
500 years ago.

4878
02:29:44,600 --> 02:29:47,480
And the tray itself that held the,

4879
02:29:47,630 --> 02:29:47,901
the,

4880
02:29:47,901 --> 02:29:48,171
uh,

4881
02:29:48,171 --> 02:29:50,780
the [inaudible] was 3,500 years old,

4882
02:29:50,810 --> 02:29:52,550
used for exactly that purpose.

4883
02:29:53,030 --> 02:29:54,590
And he smiles to us and he says,

4884
02:29:54,591 --> 02:29:56,780
now this thing is used,

4885
02:29:56,810 --> 02:29:57,770
it's not new.

4886
02:29:59,090 --> 02:30:02,630
And he just kind of smiles and we chuck
a little bit and still at the very edge

4887
02:30:02,631 --> 02:30:05,000
of doing this most intense DMT experience.

4888
02:30:05,300 --> 02:30:05,541
You know,

4889
02:30:05,541 --> 02:30:09,060
he's got a little chuckle and a laugh
and that was one of the beautiful things

4890
02:30:09,061 --> 02:30:09,710
of this.

4891
02:30:09,710 --> 02:30:10,161
So anyways,

4892
02:30:10,161 --> 02:30:15,020
this guy goes before me and he's kind
of struggling with it and having a

4893
02:30:15,021 --> 02:30:17,090
challenging time and he
finally gets some down.

4894
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:18,830
And then after you do it,

4895
02:30:18,831 --> 02:30:21,560
you're supposed to go to your room
and how do they get it up your nose?

4896
02:30:22,010 --> 02:30:23,240
So you put the,

4897
02:30:23,241 --> 02:30:23,631
so yeah,

4898
02:30:23,631 --> 02:30:24,680
I'll tell him when I'm going.

4899
02:30:24,681 --> 02:30:28,470
So I hop up there and I
look at it and it's the,

4900
02:30:28,490 --> 02:30:29,870
it's hollowed straight down the middle.

4901
02:30:29,871 --> 02:30:31,400
I don't know how they
did this without a drill,

4902
02:30:31,401 --> 02:30:32,234
but it's like this,

4903
02:30:32,620 --> 02:30:33,200
you know,

4904
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:33,531
hall,

4905
02:30:33,531 --> 02:30:34,331
I guess they had something,

4906
02:30:34,331 --> 02:30:35,870
they just twist it
until they went through,

4907
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:37,900
when they start a fire stick.

4908
02:30:38,510 --> 02:30:43,220
So it's like a knuckle bones but as
longer and it's hollowed straight down the

4909
02:30:43,250 --> 02:30:44,240
down the center of it.

4910
02:30:44,390 --> 02:30:46,520
And so you put the knuckle in your nose,

4911
02:30:46,521 --> 02:30:49,850
one knuckle in your nose and then the
other knuckle has been cut off in a

4912
02:30:49,851 --> 02:30:51,950
certain way that lays flat in the tray.

4913
02:30:52,460 --> 02:30:55,610
And then it's this bunch of
brown powder that's all in there.

4914
02:30:55,850 --> 02:31:00,850
And you basically just in one nostril
and then in the other nostril as as hard

4915
02:31:01,791 --> 02:31:02,624
as you can go.

4916
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:03,170
Whoa.

4917
02:31:03,170 --> 02:31:06,190
And so he gets up there and he,

4918
02:31:06,290 --> 02:31:07,310
and he gives it to me.

4919
02:31:07,311 --> 02:31:08,144
I put it in my,

4920
02:31:08,150 --> 02:31:08,391
you know,

4921
02:31:08,391 --> 02:31:09,890
I got a big nose so that helped out.

4922
02:31:10,670 --> 02:31:14,390
So I stick the knuckle in my nose
and I just take a rip in one nozzle,

4923
02:31:14,420 --> 02:31:16,130
take a huge rip and the other nostril.

4924
02:31:16,580 --> 02:31:17,570
And at that point,

4925
02:31:17,571 --> 02:31:19,100
I mean burn like hell,

4926
02:31:19,110 --> 02:31:22,530
but more than that it felt like you ever
watch the old Highlander when he cut

4927
02:31:22,531 --> 02:31:26,430
someone's head off and he is like
absorbing the soul of the vanquished foe.

4928
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:29,220
It was like the most incredible power,

4929
02:31:29,221 --> 02:31:30,150
like coursing through me.

4930
02:31:30,151 --> 02:31:30,984
I was like,

4931
02:31:32,110 --> 02:31:32,640
Whoa,

4932
02:31:32,640 --> 02:31:33,540
like just shaking.

4933
02:31:33,541 --> 02:31:37,520
Like lightening struck me or
w I was really crazy feelings,

4934
02:31:37,530 --> 02:31:38,760
a painful feeling.

4935
02:31:38,790 --> 02:31:41,250
And at the same time it's
burning at the same time.

4936
02:31:41,251 --> 02:31:42,930
Intense DMT trip.

4937
02:31:43,290 --> 02:31:44,101
Well not yet.

4938
02:31:44,101 --> 02:31:46,140
So it didn't kick in the DMT part,

4939
02:31:46,141 --> 02:31:47,820
but just something electric happened.

4940
02:31:47,821 --> 02:31:49,200
Like I just got hit with lightening,

4941
02:31:49,201 --> 02:31:50,310
like my body knew like,

4942
02:31:50,340 --> 02:31:51,173
oh fuck,

4943
02:31:51,360 --> 02:31:53,040
like something crazy is going to happen.

4944
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:57,420
So Don Howard just looks at me and he
knew I got a bunch of it and so he goes,

4945
02:31:57,780 --> 02:32:00,960
you better go to your room and just
kind of said that with a smile.

4946
02:32:00,961 --> 02:32:03,990
And like I take off out of the hut and
I go to the room and everybody else is

4947
02:32:03,991 --> 02:32:04,824
going to go.

4948
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:06,960
So I start lying down in the bed.

4949
02:32:06,961 --> 02:32:07,800
It's completely dark.

4950
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:10,500
I got a blindfold on and um,

4951
02:32:10,710 --> 02:32:11,011
you know,

4952
02:32:11,011 --> 02:32:16,011
the snuff still kind of burning a little
bit and then a pretty familiar DMT

4953
02:32:16,741 --> 02:32:18,060
experience starts to happen.

4954
02:32:18,061 --> 02:32:20,190
That kind of chrysanthemum of energy,

4955
02:32:20,220 --> 02:32:23,340
except it's way fucking
thicker than I've ever seen it.

4956
02:32:23,550 --> 02:32:27,810
I'm used to like seeing it in
above me in this kind of thing.

4957
02:32:27,811 --> 02:32:30,840
But this was completely threw me like,

4958
02:32:30,900 --> 02:32:34,140
it wasn't like I was
looking at it like I was it.

4959
02:32:34,290 --> 02:32:39,290
I was this nexus of energy and lights
and spider web and there was really no

4960
02:32:40,291 --> 02:32:41,910
separation between me and it,

4961
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:43,440
which is an experience
that I've never had.

4962
02:32:43,470 --> 02:32:47,160
I've always kind of known
myself and then this other,

4963
02:32:47,220 --> 02:32:52,220
and I was able to kind of look at
the other as myself this I was like,

4964
02:32:52,320 --> 02:32:53,040
oh fuck,

4965
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:54,660
I am becoming this thing.

4966
02:32:54,870 --> 02:32:59,460
I am not really myself anymore except
occasionally things would happen to my

4967
02:32:59,461 --> 02:33:00,260
body.

4968
02:33:00,260 --> 02:33:00,571
I'd be like,

4969
02:33:00,571 --> 02:33:00,931
okay,

4970
02:33:00,931 --> 02:33:01,920
body is still there,

4971
02:33:01,921 --> 02:33:05,580
but it was in this weird like it was
in another room or something like that.

4972
02:33:06,690 --> 02:33:07,980
So that happens and it,

4973
02:33:08,030 --> 02:33:12,600
and I kind of pass through that
section and then I find myself in this,

4974
02:33:12,660 --> 02:33:12,901
you know,

4975
02:33:12,901 --> 02:33:16,830
all that whole nexus of
light chrysanthemum whatever
that DMT thing is gone.

4976
02:33:16,831 --> 02:33:21,030
And I find myself in this room with a
bunch of different spirits and one is like

4977
02:33:21,031 --> 02:33:25,560
this Harry hippopotamus
looking frogman with a staff.

4978
02:33:26,010 --> 02:33:28,140
And then there's these
other figures in hoods.

4979
02:33:28,350 --> 02:33:31,350
And then there's these figures all
around me and I feel like I'm in this

4980
02:33:31,351 --> 02:33:33,750
neighborhood bar and everybody's
kind of looking at me like,

4981
02:33:33,940 --> 02:33:34,920
the fuck are you doing here?

4982
02:33:35,250 --> 02:33:36,083
You don't belong here.

4983
02:33:36,660 --> 02:33:37,441
So I say,

4984
02:33:37,441 --> 02:33:38,274
I say,

4985
02:33:38,540 --> 02:33:38,761
you know,

4986
02:33:38,761 --> 02:33:39,900
if it's in the greatest good,

4987
02:33:39,901 --> 02:33:41,490
if anybody wants to speak with me,

4988
02:33:41,560 --> 02:33:41,830
you know,

4989
02:33:41,830 --> 02:33:42,663
please do so.

4990
02:33:43,110 --> 02:33:43,770
And all the,

4991
02:33:43,770 --> 02:33:45,690
all the spirits just
kind of look at me like,

4992
02:33:46,230 --> 02:33:46,980
hmm.

4993
02:33:46,980 --> 02:33:47,221
Not,

4994
02:33:47,221 --> 02:33:48,031
not in a mean way,

4995
02:33:48,031 --> 02:33:48,481
but just like,

4996
02:33:48,481 --> 02:33:48,840
man,

4997
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:49,673
I ain't got shit for you.

4998
02:33:50,820 --> 02:33:55,410
So I'm sitting there for a second
and then I say grandma year.

4999
02:33:56,520 --> 02:33:57,353
And uh,

5000
02:33:59,340 --> 02:33:59,811
and uh,

5001
02:33:59,811 --> 02:34:00,644
so,

5002
02:34:00,900 --> 02:34:01,380
um,

5003
02:34:01,380 --> 02:34:01,621
you know,

5004
02:34:01,621 --> 02:34:02,760
I was really close with my grandma.

5005
02:34:02,761 --> 02:34:04,080
She's on my tattoo here.

5006
02:34:04,560 --> 02:34:05,393
And,

5007
02:34:05,490 --> 02:34:05,910
um,

5008
02:34:05,910 --> 02:34:06,631
I asked for,

5009
02:34:06,631 --> 02:34:09,870
I said grandma here and to my left.

5010
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:11,573
Um,

5011
02:34:11,700 --> 02:34:16,700
she started approaching in the most
familiar way that I remember probably from

5012
02:34:17,020 --> 02:34:19,570
when I was 10 or 12 in that kind of form.

5013
02:34:20,020 --> 02:34:22,030
I remember the clothes she
was wearing and her face,

5014
02:34:22,031 --> 02:34:23,050
and now everything was,

5015
02:34:23,620 --> 02:34:24,191
and she said,

5016
02:34:24,191 --> 02:34:24,431
hey,

5017
02:34:24,431 --> 02:34:25,264
Aubrey.

5018
02:34:25,380 --> 02:34:26,500
And in her voice.

5019
02:34:28,090 --> 02:34:29,530
And I held out my hand,

5020
02:34:31,690 --> 02:34:32,523
my left hand,

5021
02:34:33,430 --> 02:34:38,430
and she grabbed a hold of my hand and
I could feel it just like her same

5022
02:34:38,651 --> 02:34:41,860
weathered hand used to be when
I would hold her hand as a kid.

5023
02:34:42,040 --> 02:34:47,040
And we started talking and we
talked for a few minutes and then,

5024
02:34:49,770 --> 02:34:50,530
um,

5025
02:34:50,530 --> 02:34:50,831
you know,

5026
02:34:50,831 --> 02:34:53,350
said we loved each other and I said,

5027
02:34:53,351 --> 02:34:53,681
grandma,

5028
02:34:53,681 --> 02:34:54,514
I got to go now.

5029
02:34:54,790 --> 02:34:55,031
She said,

5030
02:34:55,031 --> 02:34:55,271
yeah,

5031
02:34:55,271 --> 02:34:57,310
I know and I let go.

5032
02:34:58,900 --> 02:34:59,733
And um,

5033
02:35:00,730 --> 02:35:01,630
and she left.

5034
02:35:02,510 --> 02:35:03,343
And um,

5035
02:35:03,430 --> 02:35:06,610
then I started the process
of coming back into my body.

5036
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:09,970
But how real that,

5037
02:35:10,240 --> 02:35:11,380
that moment was,

5038
02:35:11,470 --> 02:35:11,920
you know,

5039
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:12,191
I mean,

5040
02:35:12,191 --> 02:35:15,730
you could say it's all in my mind and
it was a projection of my grandma,

5041
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:17,980
but I could feel her fucking hand.

5042
02:35:18,040 --> 02:35:20,920
I could hear her voice and
I know what she said to me.

5043
02:35:20,980 --> 02:35:25,270
And what doesn't matter what anybody
wants to try and explain that,

5044
02:35:25,271 --> 02:35:25,690
you know,

5045
02:35:25,690 --> 02:35:26,740
that was my grandma.

5046
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:28,173
That was her.

5047
02:35:28,240 --> 02:35:32,110
Well this is a very touchy subject for
people cause people love calling bullshit

5048
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:33,220
on these kinds of stories.

5049
02:35:33,260 --> 02:35:33,750
Yeah.

5050
02:35:33,750 --> 02:35:35,260
But this is what's really important.

5051
02:35:35,870 --> 02:35:40,550
It doesn't matter whether or not it
was a hallucination or whether it was

5052
02:35:40,551 --> 02:35:43,880
actually your grandmother is
the exact same experience.

5053
02:35:44,240 --> 02:35:44,991
It's still is.

5054
02:35:44,991 --> 02:35:49,730
That experience was that is what's really
crazy about a psychedelic is that it

5055
02:35:49,731 --> 02:35:52,280
may be able to bring
your grandmother to you.

5056
02:35:52,281 --> 02:35:54,020
It might really be able to do that.

5057
02:35:54,050 --> 02:35:58,340
Like that might be real if
it might be a hallucination,

5058
02:35:58,341 --> 02:35:59,690
but it's the same experience.

5059
02:35:59,691 --> 02:35:59,991
It is.

5060
02:35:59,991 --> 02:36:04,190
Your grandmother came to you that that's
a really weird thing for people to

5061
02:36:04,191 --> 02:36:05,024
adjust to.

5062
02:36:05,300 --> 02:36:09,020
That the idea that there's more than one
possibility going on here and the ideal

5063
02:36:09,021 --> 02:36:10,280
that you don't have to debunk this.

5064
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:12,560
Like you don't have to debunk
something first of all,

5065
02:36:12,561 --> 02:36:14,120
that you haven't personally experienced,

5066
02:36:14,540 --> 02:36:15,261
and two,

5067
02:36:15,261 --> 02:36:16,370
that it doesn't matter.

5068
02:36:16,610 --> 02:36:18,140
Like the debunking is not important.

5069
02:36:18,290 --> 02:36:23,290
It's very important not to get caught up
in some crazy woo woo like faith healer

5070
02:36:24,530 --> 02:36:25,250
nonsense.

5071
02:36:25,250 --> 02:36:25,461
It's,

5072
02:36:25,461 --> 02:36:25,881
you're right.

5073
02:36:25,881 --> 02:36:26,390
It's very,

5074
02:36:26,390 --> 02:36:29,660
but if you really don't believe him,

5075
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:34,070
take it yourself and until
then shut your mouth.

5076
02:36:34,100 --> 02:36:37,160
I understand you're trying to be all
scientific and everything and I understand

5077
02:36:37,161 --> 02:36:37,520
that.

5078
02:36:37,520 --> 02:36:37,731
You know,

5079
02:36:37,731 --> 02:36:41,180
I take offense with these
pseudo scientific explanations.

5080
02:36:41,181 --> 02:36:41,330
What,

5081
02:36:41,330 --> 02:36:45,410
what can it be easily
explained by modern science,

5082
02:36:45,411 --> 02:36:47,300
the workings of the human mind?

5083
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:48,710
I don't think so.

5084
02:36:48,980 --> 02:36:49,880
I don't think we finished.

5085
02:36:49,881 --> 02:36:54,290
I don't think we've even dipped
our toes into what the fuck.

5086
02:36:54,291 --> 02:36:56,840
Being a conscious entity in the universe.

5087
02:36:56,841 --> 02:36:57,141
Really.

5088
02:36:57,141 --> 02:36:57,501
Truly,

5089
02:36:57,501 --> 02:36:57,950
yes.

5090
02:36:57,950 --> 02:36:59,030
I don't think we have.

5091
02:36:59,500 --> 02:37:00,430
And so for anybody,

5092
02:37:00,431 --> 02:37:00,671
you know,

5093
02:37:00,671 --> 02:37:04,840
I didn't have any of this kind of kind
of unfinished business or anything.

5094
02:37:04,841 --> 02:37:07,300
It was just an amazing
opportunity to connect with her,

5095
02:37:07,330 --> 02:37:07,541
you know?

5096
02:37:07,541 --> 02:37:08,650
But for me,

5097
02:37:08,651 --> 02:37:09,484
the change,

5098
02:37:09,610 --> 02:37:11,350
the truth of that experience,

5099
02:37:11,351 --> 02:37:11,561
you know,

5100
02:37:11,561 --> 02:37:14,950
for someone who did have and not that
this happens to everybody and this is

5101
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:17,240
reproducible and you go
in with this expectation,

5102
02:37:17,390 --> 02:37:21,170
I'm going to do Vielka and talk to my
dead relative who I wanted to say I love

5103
02:37:21,171 --> 02:37:21,770
you too.

5104
02:37:21,770 --> 02:37:22,581
That may happen.

5105
02:37:22,581 --> 02:37:23,091
It may not.

5106
02:37:23,091 --> 02:37:24,530
So don't go with expectations.

5107
02:37:24,531 --> 02:37:26,180
But for me that's,

5108
02:37:26,210 --> 02:37:28,340
this is my experience and this is what,

5109
02:37:28,670 --> 02:37:30,380
what happened to me in this,

5110
02:37:30,381 --> 02:37:31,430
in this vilc of ceremony.

5111
02:37:31,460 --> 02:37:35,030
The idea that that see when
people say is it reproducible?

5112
02:37:35,210 --> 02:37:36,410
Yes and no.

5113
02:37:36,620 --> 02:37:39,680
DMT is reproducibly ridiculous,

5114
02:37:40,130 --> 02:37:43,580
but if you think that the exact
same experiences reproducible,

5115
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:48,760
what you are ignorant of is
the catalog of possible events.

5116
02:37:50,300 --> 02:37:55,300
Stop and think of that that catalog
of possible events is infinite and the

5117
02:37:56,991 --> 02:37:59,330
universe of DMT dimension,

5118
02:37:59,331 --> 02:38:03,950
the DMT experience when you tap into
that would it really truly represents is

5119
02:38:03,951 --> 02:38:08,951
something you had no idea you could ever
even think up if you're just thinking

5120
02:38:09,131 --> 02:38:09,471
it up,

5121
02:38:09,471 --> 02:38:14,330
you had no idea it was there and
it becomes infinitely more complex.

5122
02:38:14,331 --> 02:38:18,680
The more you pay attention to it and
it's never ending and it can change

5123
02:38:18,681 --> 02:38:19,401
constantly.

5124
02:38:19,401 --> 02:38:19,600
And,

5125
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:24,600
and the sameness in my little feeble
attempt at using a human language to

5126
02:38:25,161 --> 02:38:27,860
describe this experience is so useless.

5127
02:38:27,861 --> 02:38:28,694
It's so,

5128
02:38:28,850 --> 02:38:29,810
it's so silly.

5129
02:38:30,290 --> 02:38:35,150
But the point is that along
the way you realize that yeah,

5130
02:38:35,151 --> 02:38:36,710
you could probably reproduce it,

5131
02:38:36,711 --> 02:38:40,100
but it doesn't matter because this is not
the same thing for a 10th of a second.

5132
02:38:40,290 --> 02:38:40,610
Yup.

5133
02:38:40,610 --> 02:38:45,260
Every 10th of a second it's a new
thing and it impossible new thing.

5134
02:38:45,261 --> 02:38:45,590
Like,

5135
02:38:45,590 --> 02:38:45,921
okay,

5136
02:38:45,921 --> 02:38:47,030
now I understand.

5137
02:38:47,031 --> 02:38:49,010
Well there's these colors
and the iseries chat.

5138
02:38:49,070 --> 02:38:49,221
Oh,

5139
02:38:49,221 --> 02:38:50,210
what the fuck is this?

5140
02:38:50,390 --> 02:38:50,541
Oh,

5141
02:38:50,541 --> 02:38:50,961
what is this?

5142
02:38:50,961 --> 02:38:51,920
This is the new thing,

5143
02:38:51,960 --> 02:38:52,220
right?

5144
02:38:52,220 --> 02:38:53,570
This isn't even possible.

5145
02:38:53,571 --> 02:38:54,404
This can't be real.

5146
02:38:54,500 --> 02:38:54,921
Oh my God,

5147
02:38:54,921 --> 02:38:55,910
this is crazier than that.

5148
02:38:56,230 --> 02:38:56,570
This is,

5149
02:38:56,570 --> 02:38:58,700
and it just keeps going
and it never stops.

5150
02:38:58,701 --> 02:39:00,350
It's con you can't catch up.

5151
02:39:00,380 --> 02:39:00,801
You can't,

5152
02:39:00,801 --> 02:39:03,110
you can never cattle catalog at all.

5153
02:39:03,290 --> 02:39:03,861
You can ever say,

5154
02:39:03,861 --> 02:39:08,861
why don't we have got a very clear catalog
of the possible effects of being on

5155
02:39:09,531 --> 02:39:11,110
dime metal trip terrain and Oh,

5156
02:39:11,111 --> 02:39:11,291
I'm,

5157
02:39:11,291 --> 02:39:15,530
or you went to page 54 now this
is on page 54 bitch just doesn't,

5158
02:39:15,670 --> 02:39:18,500
it doesn't end a book and you
don't have it in your head.

5159
02:39:18,620 --> 02:39:20,030
You don't have the database.

5160
02:39:20,060 --> 02:39:20,893
It's you don't have,

5161
02:39:20,900 --> 02:39:21,733
it's like,

5162
02:39:21,770 --> 02:39:22,311
you know,

5163
02:39:22,311 --> 02:39:24,470
it ain't trying to figure
out how satellite works.

5164
02:39:24,500 --> 02:39:25,333
It doesn't matter.

5165
02:39:25,610 --> 02:39:26,443
She's a fucking,

5166
02:39:26,540 --> 02:39:27,373
it's so,

5167
02:39:27,580 --> 02:39:28,850
it's so out of your world.

5168
02:39:29,690 --> 02:39:31,520
If it falls out of the sky
and hits you in the head,

5169
02:39:31,521 --> 02:39:33,440
it's the only time you should
ever worry about it until then.

5170
02:39:33,800 --> 02:39:34,430
Carry on.

5171
02:39:34,430 --> 02:39:34,910
Totally.

5172
02:39:34,910 --> 02:39:35,600
You're not already.

5173
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:36,590
And so the cool part,

5174
02:39:36,591 --> 02:39:36,831
you know,

5175
02:39:36,831 --> 02:39:38,210
with the smoking of the DMT,

5176
02:39:38,211 --> 02:39:39,800
it's the kind of this in and out.

5177
02:39:40,010 --> 02:39:41,390
This was stretched out over,

5178
02:39:41,420 --> 02:39:41,870
you know,

5179
02:39:41,870 --> 02:39:44,720
40 minutes and it was a long
way kind of back from that.

5180
02:39:45,140 --> 02:39:46,580
You could maybe call that the peak.

5181
02:39:46,610 --> 02:39:48,590
A lot of other things
happen and I actually,

5182
02:39:49,160 --> 02:39:52,700
one of the things that I have going on
in the psychedelic experiences as I have

5183
02:39:52,701 --> 02:39:55,070
kind of like a recorder almost,

5184
02:39:55,270 --> 02:39:59,510
it's like a stress of consciousness that
consciousness is another weird word to

5185
02:39:59,511 --> 02:39:59,631
use,

5186
02:39:59,631 --> 02:40:04,631
but a shred of mental capacity that I
keep open to record this and store this

5187
02:40:04,941 --> 02:40:05,481
information.

5188
02:40:05,481 --> 02:40:07,220
One of the reasons why I
can tell these stories,

5189
02:40:07,910 --> 02:40:08,391
remember what,

5190
02:40:08,391 --> 02:40:11,030
as I was coming back from that place,

5191
02:40:11,180 --> 02:40:12,290
I could feel that thing.

5192
02:40:12,291 --> 02:40:15,750
It was like almost like knowing that
these microphones are on or something,

5193
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:17,280
you just have an awareness that it's on.

5194
02:40:17,820 --> 02:40:19,350
And I remember consciously being like,

5195
02:40:19,380 --> 02:40:20,670
I got to shut this off now.

5196
02:40:21,030 --> 02:40:23,790
And so for the first time in any
of these psychedelic experiences,

5197
02:40:23,791 --> 02:40:27,840
there's a good period that I don't even
recall and I couldn't even talk about

5198
02:40:27,841 --> 02:40:28,440
here.

5199
02:40:28,440 --> 02:40:31,320
But what I can recall is as I
was coming back even closer,

5200
02:40:31,580 --> 02:40:32,310
um,

5201
02:40:32,310 --> 02:40:36,060
I could see a lot of these attachments
onto my body is I was kind of from a

5202
02:40:36,061 --> 02:40:36,900
bird's eye view,

5203
02:40:37,530 --> 02:40:38,281
different things,

5204
02:40:38,281 --> 02:40:39,390
different relationships,

5205
02:40:39,391 --> 02:40:43,830
different other things that had know
attachments to this form or attachments to

5206
02:40:43,831 --> 02:40:45,900
this idea or attachments to that.

5207
02:40:46,440 --> 02:40:50,130
And I just was able to just clear them
all away and you're just kind of move

5208
02:40:50,131 --> 02:40:51,990
through with my breath and my hand and,

5209
02:40:52,380 --> 02:40:56,370
and just kind of cut all these little
hooks that were in my body and then just

5210
02:40:56,371 --> 02:41:01,371
found myself coming back in
and just marveling at the
magic of this machine that

5211
02:41:01,681 --> 02:41:02,130
we have,

5212
02:41:02,130 --> 02:41:02,311
you know,

5213
02:41:02,311 --> 02:41:03,930
like hands that could squeeze.

5214
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:04,950
Yeah,

5215
02:41:04,950 --> 02:41:05,700
yeah,

5216
02:41:05,700 --> 02:41:06,533
exactly.

5217
02:41:06,780 --> 02:41:07,510
Exactly.

5218
02:41:07,510 --> 02:41:08,240
She got,

5219
02:41:08,240 --> 02:41:10,410
you got hands in that tongue debt,

5220
02:41:10,470 --> 02:41:11,430
you can move around.

5221
02:41:11,431 --> 02:41:13,350
I remember moving around
like some wiggle toes,

5222
02:41:13,351 --> 02:41:17,420
it wiggle and in that process I
remember I started singing a like a,

5223
02:41:17,470 --> 02:41:18,210
like an eco,

5224
02:41:18,210 --> 02:41:19,290
like a little song like,

5225
02:41:19,530 --> 02:41:19,850
oh no,

5226
02:41:19,850 --> 02:41:20,120
no,

5227
02:41:20,120 --> 02:41:20,570
I'm on,

5228
02:41:20,570 --> 02:41:22,890
I'm a total nonsense gibberish.

5229
02:41:22,891 --> 02:41:26,160
But it just started to come out and I
was singing that as I was getting back

5230
02:41:26,161 --> 02:41:26,994
into my body.

5231
02:41:27,480 --> 02:41:27,871
And,

5232
02:41:27,871 --> 02:41:28,200
uh,

5233
02:41:28,200 --> 02:41:32,730
I remember I was still singing and I
maybe I was seeing a little loud and I saw

5234
02:41:32,731 --> 02:41:37,710
this vision of this woman in this kind
of crystally gown comes up and she smiles

5235
02:41:37,711 --> 02:41:39,960
at me and then puts her
finger to my lips like,

5236
02:41:40,230 --> 02:41:40,461
hey,

5237
02:41:40,461 --> 02:41:40,631
sure,

5238
02:41:40,631 --> 02:41:41,464
sure.

5239
02:41:41,610 --> 02:41:43,020
That's a great way when you're tripping.

5240
02:41:43,070 --> 02:41:43,830
Yeah.

5241
02:41:43,830 --> 02:41:44,281
So,

5242
02:41:44,281 --> 02:41:44,790
uh,

5243
02:41:44,790 --> 02:41:46,050
did you want to talk to her more?

5244
02:41:46,290 --> 02:41:46,651
No,

5245
02:41:46,651 --> 02:41:48,810
she was just there to tell
me to shush cause I was like,

5246
02:41:48,811 --> 02:41:49,141
okay,

5247
02:41:49,141 --> 02:41:49,741
I'll shush now.

5248
02:41:49,741 --> 02:41:50,550
It's always a chick.

5249
02:41:50,550 --> 02:41:51,383
Yeah.

5250
02:41:52,440 --> 02:41:52,680
Yeah.

5251
02:41:52,680 --> 02:41:53,610
It's the Yin and Yang,

5252
02:41:54,160 --> 02:41:54,430
you know,

5253
02:41:54,430 --> 02:41:57,030
either Alfalfa had a fucking
shitty group of friends that he,

5254
02:41:57,031 --> 02:41:57,271
man,

5255
02:41:57,271 --> 02:41:59,160
woman haters club in little rascals.

5256
02:41:59,220 --> 02:42:00,140
It's terrible bullshit.

5257
02:42:00,830 --> 02:42:02,700
You don't want to be in the
Heman woman haters club.

5258
02:42:03,180 --> 02:42:04,020
We could all get along.

5259
02:42:04,510 --> 02:42:07,980
Well they stopped [inaudible]
southern hut got built,

5260
02:42:07,981 --> 02:42:08,360
bitch.

5261
02:42:08,360 --> 02:42:08,850
Yeah,

5262
02:42:08,850 --> 02:42:09,683
I'm excitable.

5263
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:12,091
So yes,

5264
02:42:12,091 --> 02:42:14,670
I get back in my body and then
I walked back into the hut.

5265
02:42:14,700 --> 02:42:18,450
I was one of the first to do the snuffs
was one of the first back and I sat and

5266
02:42:18,451 --> 02:42:21,960
he asked me to sit in his chair
and then look at the alter.

5267
02:42:21,961 --> 02:42:25,560
And I remember just looking at the altar
and just kind of merging with one with

5268
02:42:25,561 --> 02:42:28,320
the center of the altar and
realizing that the core of my center,

5269
02:42:28,350 --> 02:42:28,741
that kind of,

5270
02:42:28,741 --> 02:42:31,890
that principle of nonduality that you
talked about touching every part of the

5271
02:42:31,891 --> 02:42:32,724
universe,

5272
02:42:32,760 --> 02:42:36,210
the core of my being really started
to merge with the core of that.

5273
02:42:36,330 --> 02:42:38,190
They'll none zone in the middle.

5274
02:42:38,370 --> 02:42:42,420
And I just felt unbelievably connected
with the entire universe at that point.

5275
02:42:42,421 --> 02:42:45,330
Realizing that within me
is that same connection is,

5276
02:42:45,650 --> 02:42:46,411
is within that.

5277
02:42:46,411 --> 02:42:47,244
And,

5278
02:42:47,500 --> 02:42:49,170
and then that was pretty much the,

5279
02:42:49,171 --> 02:42:49,320
uh,

5280
02:42:49,320 --> 02:42:50,520
the wrap of the ceremony.

5281
02:42:50,520 --> 02:42:50,791
You know,

5282
02:42:50,791 --> 02:42:51,001
we,

5283
02:42:51,001 --> 02:42:51,300
uh,

5284
02:42:51,300 --> 02:42:54,300
we all got kind of back in
and candles burned out and,

5285
02:42:54,301 --> 02:42:55,020
uh,

5286
02:42:55,020 --> 02:42:55,681
had a feast,

5287
02:42:55,681 --> 02:42:56,910
ate some Cayman,

5288
02:42:56,911 --> 02:42:59,490
some alligator at the end of that night.

5289
02:42:59,550 --> 02:43:01,050
And I think came in,

5290
02:43:01,620 --> 02:43:02,490
he came in as a crocodile,

5291
02:43:02,491 --> 02:43:02,840
right?

5292
02:43:02,840 --> 02:43:05,310
Is it came in and correct the difference
between the way I'll get her taste and

5293
02:43:05,350 --> 02:43:07,080
Kroc came and tastes delicious.

5294
02:43:07,081 --> 02:43:08,430
It's kind of like a tougher chicken.

5295
02:43:08,580 --> 02:43:09,041
But anyway,

5296
02:43:09,041 --> 02:43:11,560
so we finished that off
and go have a feast and uh,

5297
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:13,511
there we go.

5298
02:43:13,511 --> 02:43:13,840
And,

5299
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:16,930
and really the last kind of
words from Don Howard is he's uh,

5300
02:43:17,020 --> 02:43:18,960
you know he told me as I was leaving,

5301
02:43:18,980 --> 02:43:19,361
he says,

5302
02:43:19,361 --> 02:43:19,620
you know,

5303
02:43:19,620 --> 02:43:22,090
is renaissance time and
that's what he believes.

5304
02:43:22,091 --> 02:43:23,500
It's time for a new renaissance,

5305
02:43:23,830 --> 02:43:26,620
spiritual and responsible
consciousness renaissance.

5306
02:43:26,621 --> 02:43:27,401
And he's out there,

5307
02:43:27,401 --> 02:43:29,140
Johnny Appleseed and this motherfucker.

5308
02:43:29,170 --> 02:43:29,470
Yup.

5309
02:43:29,470 --> 02:43:33,070
He's been holding it down for 50 years
waiting for waiting for word to get

5310
02:43:33,071 --> 02:43:33,910
critical mass.

5311
02:43:34,420 --> 02:43:35,260
I think it's out there.

5312
02:43:35,710 --> 02:43:37,020
Do you think its critical mass now?

5313
02:43:37,030 --> 02:43:37,863
It's getting there though.

5314
02:43:38,140 --> 02:43:39,160
What do you experience,

5315
02:43:39,190 --> 02:43:41,500
what's the difference
in your life since uh,

5316
02:43:42,160 --> 02:43:42,461
you know,

5317
02:43:42,461 --> 02:43:45,490
you feel like you've been
exposed to these ideas.

5318
02:43:45,640 --> 02:43:49,180
So now at this point I
have the roadmap back.

5319
02:43:49,210 --> 02:43:50,470
Anytime I get in a,

5320
02:43:50,530 --> 02:43:51,520
in a weird situation,

5321
02:43:51,550 --> 02:43:55,180
I'm not immune to fears and I'm
not immune to worries and concerns,

5322
02:43:55,630 --> 02:43:58,060
but now I can see them and I can choose.

5323
02:43:58,090 --> 02:43:59,560
And I can almost say,

5324
02:43:59,561 --> 02:43:59,951
okay,

5325
02:43:59,951 --> 02:44:01,000
I recognize you,

5326
02:44:01,001 --> 02:44:01,900
I see you coming.

5327
02:44:02,140 --> 02:44:03,760
But I also remember a truth,

5328
02:44:03,761 --> 02:44:08,050
so much deeper that I felt and while
you may pester me for a moment,

5329
02:44:08,410 --> 02:44:11,440
I'm going to find my way back to
that eventually cause I felt it,

5330
02:44:11,441 --> 02:44:11,950
I saw it.

5331
02:44:11,950 --> 02:44:13,090
I chose to be that way.

5332
02:44:13,750 --> 02:44:17,080
And for me because of how
active this whole ceremony was,

5333
02:44:17,530 --> 02:44:20,230
knowing my way back to that
feeling of fearlessness,

5334
02:44:20,270 --> 02:44:24,070
knowing my way back to that connection
with the center of the universe and the

5335
02:44:24,071 --> 02:44:27,220
lessons about reciprocity
and all of these things,

5336
02:44:27,790 --> 02:44:32,200
I just have the fucking roadmap to find
my way out of any kind of maze or worry

5337
02:44:32,201 --> 02:44:34,060
or concern or situation.

5338
02:44:34,390 --> 02:44:35,680
I know there's still going to come up.

5339
02:44:35,830 --> 02:44:37,480
They're still going to
kick my ass occasionally.

5340
02:44:37,510 --> 02:44:37,810
You know,

5341
02:44:37,810 --> 02:44:41,650
resistance is still going to get a foot
hold every now and then and when for an

5342
02:44:41,650 --> 02:44:42,940
hour wind for a day when?

5343
02:44:42,941 --> 02:44:43,421
For a week,

5344
02:44:43,421 --> 02:44:44,254
I don't know,

5345
02:44:44,290 --> 02:44:49,290
but I'll kick its ass eventually because
I found the way and I've seen what is

5346
02:44:49,301 --> 02:44:51,220
capable for me and what I want to be.

5347
02:44:51,460 --> 02:44:52,151
As you get older,

5348
02:44:52,151 --> 02:44:55,780
do you find less and less
battles with that shit and more,

5349
02:44:55,840 --> 02:44:57,400
a little more smooth sailing?

5350
02:44:57,490 --> 02:44:58,170
Absolutely.

5351
02:44:58,170 --> 02:44:59,003
Yeah.

5352
02:44:59,250 --> 02:44:59,461
Yeah,

5353
02:44:59,461 --> 02:45:00,060
I do.

5354
02:45:00,060 --> 02:45:00,590
Um,

5355
02:45:00,590 --> 02:45:05,590
I mean I like everyone experienced
similar moments of a malcontent or similar

5356
02:45:08,401 --> 02:45:10,920
moments of a lack of ambition.

5357
02:45:11,220 --> 02:45:11,491
You know,

5358
02:45:11,491 --> 02:45:13,110
I find a way to fight them back.

5359
02:45:13,590 --> 02:45:14,071
And a,

5360
02:45:14,071 --> 02:45:19,071
I think that one of the big things that
I keep harping on and that we harp on a

5361
02:45:20,551 --> 02:45:23,850
lot at on it is take
care of your meat wagon.

5362
02:45:24,190 --> 02:45:27,900
Fuck it has a big effect
on how your brain works.

5363
02:45:27,930 --> 02:45:29,370
It has a big effect.

5364
02:45:29,780 --> 02:45:33,090
The other day I did a Kettlebell workout,

5365
02:45:33,480 --> 02:45:38,480
I did a chin ups with a weight vest
on and ankle weights and then I did 10

5366
02:45:39,781 --> 02:45:42,360
rounds of the heavy bag while
the fights are going on.

5367
02:45:42,780 --> 02:45:45,540
So I did a renegade rows
with the kettle bells.

5368
02:45:45,750 --> 02:45:48,090
I did a alternating cleans,

5369
02:45:48,091 --> 02:45:53,091
I did clean presses and then I did these
weighted chin ups and then I just had a

5370
02:45:53,371 --> 02:45:55,530
ruthless savage bag workout.

5371
02:45:55,860 --> 02:45:57,030
And after all that shit was done,

5372
02:45:57,240 --> 02:45:58,410
you couldn't bother me.

5373
02:45:58,800 --> 02:45:59,790
It's not possible.

5374
02:45:59,910 --> 02:46:00,810
And anything you would say.

5375
02:46:00,811 --> 02:46:02,520
I would find curious so he could be like,

5376
02:46:02,521 --> 02:46:03,720
you blog a douche bag.

5377
02:46:04,090 --> 02:46:07,260
You can say stuff that totally
mean to me and be like,

5378
02:46:07,740 --> 02:46:09,230
well you got an issue.

5379
02:46:09,290 --> 02:46:10,070
I don't know what it is,

5380
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:11,630
but I'm not really interested.

5381
02:46:11,631 --> 02:46:13,410
I got to go see him like you.

5382
02:46:13,420 --> 02:46:17,090
You have a bank of bullshit in your body
and if you could blow that out in the

5383
02:46:17,091 --> 02:46:17,924
gym,

5384
02:46:17,990 --> 02:46:18,560
man,

5385
02:46:18,560 --> 02:46:18,891
and this,

5386
02:46:18,891 --> 02:46:19,701
that's a lesson.

5387
02:46:19,701 --> 02:46:23,150
If you want to talk about something that
I need to learn over and over and over

5388
02:46:23,151 --> 02:46:23,984
and over again,

5389
02:46:24,020 --> 02:46:25,040
although I know it,

5390
02:46:25,070 --> 02:46:26,450
although I have espoused it,

5391
02:46:26,690 --> 02:46:31,310
I still need to see it in action because
sometimes your ego and your body get a

5392
02:46:31,311 --> 02:46:33,680
little tricky and he'd
take a few days off,

5393
02:46:33,681 --> 02:46:34,041
take two,

5394
02:46:34,041 --> 02:46:34,711
three days off.

5395
02:46:34,711 --> 02:46:35,040
You're like,

5396
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:36,020
I'm fine.

5397
02:46:36,021 --> 02:46:37,250
I don't need to work out.

5398
02:46:37,251 --> 02:46:37,820
I don't need it.

5399
02:46:37,820 --> 02:46:39,230
I'm busy right now.

5400
02:46:39,231 --> 02:46:43,340
I'm handling everything very like you
don't even realize like you're on the

5401
02:46:43,341 --> 02:46:44,174
verge.

5402
02:46:44,270 --> 02:46:49,270
You're on the verge of stepping into
that new or that next sort of vibration

5403
02:46:49,791 --> 02:46:51,710
that a little bit more hostile vibration.

5404
02:46:51,950 --> 02:46:52,940
You can pull that back.

5405
02:46:53,090 --> 02:46:54,410
You could easily pull that back.

5406
02:46:54,770 --> 02:46:55,700
But if you don't do that,

5407
02:46:55,701 --> 02:46:56,570
if you never do that,

5408
02:46:56,571 --> 02:46:58,130
if you never take care of your meat wagon,

5409
02:46:58,400 --> 02:46:59,900
boy you don't know man.

5410
02:46:59,901 --> 02:47:00,734
You don't know there's a,

5411
02:47:00,850 --> 02:47:02,900
I was high as fuck after that workout.

5412
02:47:03,230 --> 02:47:04,040
After that workout was,

5413
02:47:04,040 --> 02:47:06,230
I was high like I was.

5414
02:47:06,320 --> 02:47:11,320
I was floating like it was filled with
endorphins and everything was beautiful.

5415
02:47:11,421 --> 02:47:12,141
I went outside,

5416
02:47:12,141 --> 02:47:13,210
I sat down in the backyard,

5417
02:47:13,220 --> 02:47:14,450
washed when chickens run around,

5418
02:47:14,451 --> 02:47:15,200
and I was like,

5419
02:47:15,200 --> 02:47:16,880
the world was filled with love.

5420
02:47:16,881 --> 02:47:18,440
I might as well been smoking weed.

5421
02:47:18,470 --> 02:47:19,303
I'm serious.

5422
02:47:19,430 --> 02:47:20,480
I was high as fuck.

5423
02:47:20,600 --> 02:47:21,440
Just stretching,

5424
02:47:21,770 --> 02:47:22,370
you know?

5425
02:47:22,370 --> 02:47:22,701
I mean,

5426
02:47:22,701 --> 02:47:27,080
it's gotta be similar to like psychedelic
effects of yoga when you're just

5427
02:47:27,290 --> 02:47:29,330
completely stressed,

5428
02:47:29,570 --> 02:47:30,320
relieved,

5429
02:47:30,320 --> 02:47:32,990
and then stretching out
and just taking in nature.

5430
02:47:32,991 --> 02:47:33,980
It was gorgeous.

5431
02:47:33,981 --> 02:47:34,910
It was beautiful.

5432
02:47:35,180 --> 02:47:39,380
It's just like a drug man and people
who don't exercise that option,

5433
02:47:39,980 --> 02:47:41,240
just do it.

5434
02:47:41,610 --> 02:47:42,443
It's not about,

5435
02:47:42,620 --> 02:47:43,280
it's not,

5436
02:47:43,280 --> 02:47:48,280
a lot of people worry that it's about the
way you look and it's about vanity and

5437
02:47:48,501 --> 02:47:52,910
they don't want to be misconstrued as
being vain or they don't want to compete.

5438
02:47:53,210 --> 02:47:57,260
They don't want to acknowledge the fact
that being physically attractive or

5439
02:47:57,261 --> 02:48:01,460
sexually attractive is beneficial because
then it'll hold weight over them and

5440
02:48:01,461 --> 02:48:04,640
then they'll judge themselves
on not chasing after that.

5441
02:48:04,910 --> 02:48:09,910
So they sort of take pride in being
a fat fuck or joke around about,

5442
02:48:10,210 --> 02:48:10,720
you know,

5443
02:48:10,720 --> 02:48:11,090
you know,

5444
02:48:11,090 --> 02:48:13,610
being lazy and this,

5445
02:48:13,820 --> 02:48:16,040
some of those people are my
favorite human beings on the planet.

5446
02:48:16,070 --> 02:48:20,780
But the reality of it is if you
took better care of your meat wagon,

5447
02:48:20,781 --> 02:48:21,950
need to have a fun ride.

5448
02:48:22,010 --> 02:48:22,650
Fuck yeah,

5449
02:48:22,650 --> 02:48:23,930
just shocks would be better.

5450
02:48:24,170 --> 02:48:25,540
Your system and run smoother.

5451
02:48:25,550 --> 02:48:27,140
You get better miles to the gallon.

5452
02:48:27,170 --> 02:48:29,210
It doesn't fucking break
down the highways much.

5453
02:48:29,510 --> 02:48:31,670
It's a completely different experience.

5454
02:48:31,850 --> 02:48:32,780
Just force yourself

5455
02:48:32,870 --> 02:48:33,980
at the bare minimum.

5456
02:48:33,981 --> 02:48:35,840
Do enough to keep your body out of pain.

5457
02:48:35,870 --> 02:48:37,100
Do some yoga.

5458
02:48:37,440 --> 02:48:38,181
It's not hard.

5459
02:48:38,181 --> 02:48:39,014
I mean it is hard,

5460
02:48:39,110 --> 02:48:41,030
but it's not hard to
find a place to do it.

5461
02:48:41,320 --> 02:48:42,980
It's not hard to find a video online.

5462
02:48:43,340 --> 02:48:44,450
Just fucking just do that,

5463
02:48:44,510 --> 02:48:45,320
try it,

5464
02:48:45,320 --> 02:48:47,360
please get out of pain,

5465
02:48:47,361 --> 02:48:50,570
then get out of fear and then you
have a chance to connect to that.

5466
02:48:50,750 --> 02:48:51,590
They know that other,

5467
02:48:51,591 --> 02:48:52,700
whatever that other is,

5468
02:48:52,701 --> 02:48:55,130
but the first steps you gotta
take care of the base root,

5469
02:48:55,190 --> 02:48:55,580
you know,

5470
02:48:55,580 --> 02:48:56,750
you gotta get your body right.

5471
02:48:56,840 --> 02:48:59,860
Anthony Bordain started doing
Jujitsu at 57 years old.

5472
02:49:00,340 --> 02:49:02,990
His wife and kid got him
into Jiu Jitsu cause his kids

5473
02:49:03,370 --> 02:49:05,300
have and as kids like
really getting into Jujitsu.

5474
02:49:05,660 --> 02:49:06,141
So he's like,

5475
02:49:06,141 --> 02:49:06,980
Holy Shit,

5476
02:49:07,110 --> 02:49:08,580
I guess this kid older than five now,

5477
02:49:08,730 --> 02:49:12,390
but clothes somewhere in that range
is kids really getting into Jiu Jitsu.

5478
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:13,200
And uh,

5479
02:49:13,200 --> 02:49:14,910
his wife is quite a bad ass.

5480
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:16,950
Like she's like really obsessed with it.

5481
02:49:16,951 --> 02:49:19,620
She trains daily and so
now he's fucking training.

5482
02:49:19,800 --> 02:49:21,280
There's all these
pictures of him trainings.

5483
02:49:21,290 --> 02:49:24,270
He's got a stripe on his white
belt is doing arm bars and shit.

5484
02:49:24,271 --> 02:49:25,290
His cardio is improved.

5485
02:49:25,440 --> 02:49:27,260
And Octavio Bordain uh,

5486
02:49:27,261 --> 02:49:28,530
I don't know what the source of it is,

5487
02:49:28,531 --> 02:49:29,080
like where,

5488
02:49:29,080 --> 02:49:30,150
where you can find it online,

5489
02:49:30,151 --> 02:49:30,984
but if you Google it,

5490
02:49:31,170 --> 02:49:33,380
she wrote an article
about Anthony Bordain,

5491
02:49:33,630 --> 02:49:33,990
uh,

5492
02:49:33,990 --> 02:49:36,150
getting into shape and doing Jujitsu.

5493
02:49:36,210 --> 02:49:37,043
And it's,

5494
02:49:37,050 --> 02:49:38,330
it's a fascinating article.

5495
02:49:38,370 --> 02:49:38,701
First of all,

5496
02:49:38,701 --> 02:49:40,110
she's a really fucking good writer.

5497
02:49:40,290 --> 02:49:40,561
I mean,

5498
02:49:40,561 --> 02:49:41,640
I always knew she was smart.

5499
02:49:41,641 --> 02:49:42,540
She is very interesting,

5500
02:49:42,541 --> 02:49:43,980
but I didn't know how good her writing is.

5501
02:49:43,980 --> 02:49:45,000
It's very interesting.

5502
02:49:45,270 --> 02:49:45,811
It's like a,

5503
02:49:45,811 --> 02:49:46,581
I really like it.

5504
02:49:46,581 --> 02:49:47,430
It's a great style.

5505
02:49:47,431 --> 02:49:49,200
It's an enviable style of writing.

5506
02:49:49,201 --> 02:49:49,441
Like,

5507
02:49:49,441 --> 02:49:49,621
like,

5508
02:49:49,621 --> 02:49:49,831
Whoa,

5509
02:49:49,831 --> 02:49:50,970
she's got some skills,

5510
02:49:51,330 --> 02:49:51,601
you know,

5511
02:49:51,601 --> 02:49:53,400
so she's documenting him,

5512
02:49:53,610 --> 02:49:53,791
you know,

5513
02:49:53,791 --> 02:49:55,440
as like a test study,

5514
02:49:55,590 --> 02:49:55,891
you know,

5515
02:49:55,891 --> 02:49:57,130
it's obvious who he is.

5516
02:49:57,131 --> 02:49:57,231
It,

5517
02:49:57,231 --> 02:49:57,390
oh,

5518
02:49:57,390 --> 02:49:57,841
it's obvious,

5519
02:49:57,841 --> 02:50:02,160
but she knows she's talking 57 year old
man was a frequent smoker until he was

5520
02:50:02,161 --> 02:50:03,480
38 and has done,

5521
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:06,820
she names off all the
different drugs and how Wa,

5522
02:50:06,980 --> 02:50:09,360
how little exercise he gets
and all these different things.

5523
02:50:09,720 --> 02:50:11,010
It's really fun if you get a chance,

5524
02:50:11,011 --> 02:50:11,461
check it out.

5525
02:50:11,461 --> 02:50:12,780
But good on Anthony.

5526
02:50:12,781 --> 02:50:13,471
Bordain man.

5527
02:50:13,471 --> 02:50:13,821
Good for you.

5528
02:50:13,821 --> 02:50:14,040
Him.

5529
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:17,200
I love someone who's willing to take
a chance at 57 years old and learn

5530
02:50:17,201 --> 02:50:17,430
something.

5531
02:50:17,430 --> 02:50:17,770
No.

5532
02:50:17,770 --> 02:50:20,500
Exercising is exercising
his right to freewill.

5533
02:50:20,710 --> 02:50:21,190
Yeah.

5534
02:50:21,190 --> 02:50:21,580
Yeah.

5535
02:50:21,580 --> 02:50:23,890
Apparently she doesn't drill with them
cause she says he gets fucking too

5536
02:50:23,891 --> 02:50:24,724
intense.

5537
02:50:25,540 --> 02:50:26,860
He just fucking gets crazy.

5538
02:50:26,861 --> 02:50:27,460
He's trying to,

5539
02:50:27,460 --> 02:50:29,920
you know that guy's got
a little bit of Ptsd.

5540
02:50:29,930 --> 02:50:31,840
We sees fucking shit on his show.

5541
02:50:34,080 --> 02:50:34,780
This little amp

5542
02:50:34,780 --> 02:50:35,613
up man.

5543
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:37,800
Well I'm Bro,

5544
02:50:37,830 --> 02:50:38,663
we ran out of time.

5545
02:50:38,730 --> 02:50:40,380
It's another fucking
awesome podcast though.

5546
02:50:40,740 --> 02:50:41,370
A lot of fun.

5547
02:50:41,370 --> 02:50:41,641
Beautiful.

5548
02:50:41,641 --> 02:50:43,740
Remember that last time you were worried
that we're going to run out of things

5549
02:50:43,741 --> 02:50:44,250
to talk about.

5550
02:50:44,250 --> 02:50:44,341
Yeah.

5551
02:50:44,341 --> 02:50:45,151
That was hilarious.

5552
02:50:45,151 --> 02:50:45,660
That was silly.

5553
02:50:45,660 --> 02:50:46,340
That's funny.

5554
02:50:46,340 --> 02:50:46,480
Did,

5555
02:50:46,480 --> 02:50:46,660
did,

5556
02:50:46,660 --> 02:50:46,960
did,

5557
02:50:46,960 --> 02:50:48,920
did that come up at all in the,

5558
02:50:48,980 --> 02:50:50,160
in the psychedelics?

5559
02:50:50,230 --> 02:50:51,061
It didn't cause I,

5560
02:50:51,061 --> 02:50:52,350
cause I kind of figured that,

5561
02:50:53,100 --> 02:50:56,070
but it would have if I'd have had that
thought of it and like that was a silly

5562
02:50:56,071 --> 02:50:56,311
thought.

5563
02:50:56,311 --> 02:50:57,130
But all those little things,

5564
02:50:57,130 --> 02:50:58,050
those are just ants.

5565
02:50:58,350 --> 02:50:58,921
Those are ants.

5566
02:50:58,921 --> 02:51:01,380
And you can choose to give you power
that you can choose to be like,

5567
02:51:01,381 --> 02:51:02,160
that's a fucking man.

5568
02:51:02,160 --> 02:51:03,540
But like ants,

5569
02:51:03,570 --> 02:51:05,700
you need them or the world's
going to fucking fall apart.

5570
02:51:05,990 --> 02:51:07,800
That's what's really crazy
about the whole thing.

5571
02:51:07,860 --> 02:51:10,290
You really can't eradicate any of it.

5572
02:51:10,350 --> 02:51:11,220
It's impossible.

5573
02:51:11,280 --> 02:51:12,360
We're all going to be humans

5574
02:51:12,640 --> 02:51:16,930
and just enjoy this shit right here.

5575
02:51:16,960 --> 02:51:18,340
Not My deck on that point in my Monday.

5576
02:51:18,610 --> 02:51:20,740
I mean this life is what I'm saying.

5577
02:51:20,741 --> 02:51:23,470
Enjoy what's around you right now,

5578
02:51:23,471 --> 02:51:24,850
what you're experiencing right now.

5579
02:51:24,851 --> 02:51:28,630
And I think that whether
science can determine that free.

5580
02:51:28,631 --> 02:51:31,120
Will's just an illusion
because of your circumstances,

5581
02:51:31,121 --> 02:51:31,781
your genetics,

5582
02:51:31,781 --> 02:51:32,770
your life experiences.

5583
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:33,970
That's all well and good.

5584
02:51:33,971 --> 02:51:38,320
But that's not empowering to whoever's
listening to this and it's actually

5585
02:51:38,321 --> 02:51:39,154
affecting you.

5586
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:42,250
You w whoever that is that,

5587
02:51:42,251 --> 02:51:43,810
here's that me saying you,

5588
02:51:43,990 --> 02:51:46,690
whatever makes you can alter this thing.

5589
02:51:46,840 --> 02:51:47,410
You have it.

5590
02:51:47,410 --> 02:51:47,711
Yeah.

5591
02:51:47,711 --> 02:51:49,330
I don't know why you can alter it.

5592
02:51:49,360 --> 02:51:50,020
I Dunno,

5593
02:51:50,020 --> 02:51:50,560
but,

5594
02:51:50,560 --> 02:51:51,580
but I've done it.

5595
02:51:51,820 --> 02:51:52,630
You can do it.

5596
02:51:52,630 --> 02:51:53,830
There's nothing special about me.

5597
02:51:53,831 --> 02:51:55,390
I'm just a normal human being.

5598
02:51:55,450 --> 02:51:56,261
I can do it.

5599
02:51:56,261 --> 02:51:56,831
You can do it.

5600
02:51:56,831 --> 02:51:57,664
We can all do it.

5601
02:51:57,820 --> 02:52:01,990
And that's what your shaman friend
is Johnny Appleseed into the world.

5602
02:52:02,170 --> 02:52:06,400
And do you know out of a fucking
crazy place in the jungle

5603
02:52:07,030 --> 02:52:08,200
in the middle of nowhere,

5604
02:52:08,630 --> 02:52:09,910
but you have to fly into.

5605
02:52:09,990 --> 02:52:10,823
Yeah,

5606
02:52:11,320 --> 02:52:11,870
indeed.

5607
02:52:11,870 --> 02:52:12,190
Wow.

5608
02:52:12,190 --> 02:52:13,540
Do you want any more information on that?

5609
02:52:13,541 --> 02:52:15,670
I wrote this all up in a 26 page book.

5610
02:52:15,910 --> 02:52:16,121
Oh,

5611
02:52:16,121 --> 02:52:17,620
she booked with articles and stuff.

5612
02:52:17,621 --> 02:52:20,980
It's all on my warrior poet
wrote a 26 page book about that.

5613
02:52:20,981 --> 02:52:23,380
It's like a holy shit.

5614
02:52:23,440 --> 02:52:23,711
Yeah,

5615
02:52:23,711 --> 02:52:25,270
it's a wow.

5616
02:52:25,300 --> 02:52:26,830
The days that I wasn't doing ceremony,

5617
02:52:26,831 --> 02:52:29,350
I was writing about it and
who was filming this for you?

5618
02:52:29,370 --> 02:52:30,130
You hire someone to,

5619
02:52:30,130 --> 02:52:31,180
and then we got a bad ass crew.

5620
02:52:31,181 --> 02:52:32,950
We've got Mitch Schultz from DMT,

5621
02:52:32,951 --> 02:52:33,910
the spirit molecule.

5622
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:34,181
Oh,

5623
02:52:34,181 --> 02:52:34,900
I love Mitch.

5624
02:52:34,900 --> 02:52:37,270
And then we had to have
Mitch on the podcast.

5625
02:52:37,360 --> 02:52:39,590
Donald's shelters is
crazy like wildlife guy.

5626
02:52:39,591 --> 02:52:40,480
I think I talked to you about him.

5627
02:52:40,481 --> 02:52:43,420
He's the saving the rhinos and
done a bunch of shit like that.

5628
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:46,660
And then we had one of Mitch
is main film guys there.

5629
02:52:47,210 --> 02:52:48,400
I would love to talk to one of those,

5630
02:52:48,401 --> 02:52:51,850
saving the rhino guys and see how they
feel about those weird camps that they

5631
02:52:51,851 --> 02:52:52,840
have in Africa.

5632
02:52:53,260 --> 02:52:53,951
Donald will,

5633
02:52:53,951 --> 02:52:55,030
Donald knows all about it.

5634
02:52:55,031 --> 02:52:56,050
He's been there a couple of times.

5635
02:52:56,051 --> 02:53:00,430
You've got some crazy fucking story shot
at by NYPA rifles from the hunters and

5636
02:53:00,850 --> 02:53:01,870
crazy shit going on.

5637
02:53:01,900 --> 02:53:02,050
Yeah,

5638
02:53:02,050 --> 02:53:05,650
I would love to talk to him and get his
perspective that I had Louis Theroux on

5639
02:53:05,651 --> 02:53:09,990
the podcast and he spent a good deal of
time down in one of those camps and it's

5640
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:13,690
one of the most fascinating
documentary said that he put out.

5641
02:53:13,930 --> 02:53:16,290
It was all about this contradictory world,

5642
02:53:16,300 --> 02:53:17,860
these African hunting camps.

5643
02:53:18,100 --> 02:53:19,000
Really fascinating.

5644
02:53:19,001 --> 02:53:20,080
If you get a chance to watch it,

5645
02:53:20,260 --> 02:53:20,741
first of all,

5646
02:53:20,741 --> 02:53:21,341
Louis through,

5647
02:53:21,341 --> 02:53:22,300
if you don't know who he is,

5648
02:53:22,560 --> 02:53:24,100
I'm just Google him.

5649
02:53:24,820 --> 02:53:26,680
I don't want to tell you how to
spell it because I'll fuck it up,

5650
02:53:26,681 --> 02:53:28,180
but figure it out bitch.

5651
02:53:28,480 --> 02:53:32,680
It's a day suggested spelling
[inaudible] spelled Louis and um,

5652
02:53:32,710 --> 02:53:32,920
you know,

5653
02:53:32,920 --> 02:53:36,160
he did some fantastic
documentaries on the um,

5654
02:53:36,720 --> 02:53:38,260
the Westboro Baptist church.

5655
02:53:38,290 --> 02:53:42,190
The God hates fags guy who holds up
those signs at funerals and shit.

5656
02:53:42,670 --> 02:53:44,350
That was incredibly fascinating.

5657
02:53:44,530 --> 02:53:49,480
But this was one of his more fascinating
ones and the contradictory nature of

5658
02:53:49,481 --> 02:53:52,090
these hunting camps is that
because of these hunting camps,

5659
02:53:52,420 --> 02:53:54,400
these animals are more healthy,

5660
02:53:54,401 --> 02:53:56,440
their populations are healthier
than they've ever been,

5661
02:53:57,070 --> 02:54:00,610
but people are hunting them and they're
kind of given inside cages and everybody

5662
02:54:00,611 --> 02:54:02,080
else's people are freaking out.

5663
02:54:02,440 --> 02:54:03,020
And it's a,

5664
02:54:03,020 --> 02:54:03,581
it's a,

5665
02:54:03,581 --> 02:54:05,290
it's a real complex freak out.

5666
02:54:05,410 --> 02:54:06,880
Cause I can see both sides.

5667
02:54:07,300 --> 02:54:11,110
I can see the size of the people that
are running the hunting camp because they

5668
02:54:11,111 --> 02:54:14,200
are in fact making these animals safer,

5669
02:54:14,500 --> 02:54:15,910
giving them a value.

5670
02:54:16,120 --> 02:54:21,120
And then also the money spent is making
sure that their populations will stay

5671
02:54:21,581 --> 02:54:22,600
steady and strong,

5672
02:54:23,170 --> 02:54:24,430
but they're going to be hunted.

5673
02:54:24,460 --> 02:54:24,761
You see?

5674
02:54:24,761 --> 02:54:25,001
That's,

5675
02:54:25,001 --> 02:54:25,840
I do like that's crazy.

5676
02:54:25,841 --> 02:54:26,170
You're,

5677
02:54:26,170 --> 02:54:29,890
you're fencing a man and then dudes are
coming in from out of state with one

5678
02:54:29,980 --> 02:54:32,200
reason to shoot these fucking animals.

5679
02:54:32,400 --> 02:54:34,900
But that's where you get the
money to keep the animals alive.

5680
02:54:34,901 --> 02:54:35,560
Like,

5681
02:54:35,560 --> 02:54:36,730
Ooh,

5682
02:54:36,910 --> 02:54:40,240
that is the universe
in a fucking nutshell.

5683
02:54:40,300 --> 02:54:41,860
Donald grew up in South Africa,

5684
02:54:41,861 --> 02:54:42,730
so when he,

5685
02:54:42,760 --> 02:54:42,970
you know,

5686
02:54:42,970 --> 02:54:43,990
if he comes on or whatever,

5687
02:54:43,991 --> 02:54:45,010
you have a conversation with him.

5688
02:54:45,011 --> 02:54:46,240
He's got a lot of opinions on that.

5689
02:54:46,241 --> 02:54:47,170
I won't steal his thunder,

5690
02:54:47,171 --> 02:54:48,820
but I need to hear them.

5691
02:54:48,850 --> 02:54:49,890
I would love to hear them.

5692
02:54:49,970 --> 02:54:50,180
Yeah,

5693
02:54:50,180 --> 02:54:53,590
so Louis thorough documentary
was God damn incredible.

5694
02:54:54,400 --> 02:54:55,300
I would love to hear,

5695
02:54:55,301 --> 02:54:55,480
uh,

5696
02:54:55,480 --> 02:54:57,010
someone who's trying
to save those animals.

5697
02:54:57,011 --> 02:54:57,600
What it's like.

5698
02:54:57,600 --> 02:55:02,600
It's just if you really pay attention
to a really good documentary on Africa,

5699
02:55:02,860 --> 02:55:04,340
like there's a great BBC

5700
02:55:04,340 --> 02:55:05,570
series called the Congo.

5701
02:55:05,870 --> 02:55:10,700
The diversity of life there is so stunning
that it's almost like you're watching

5702
02:55:10,820 --> 02:55:15,820
something that's a window in a forgotten
time when these animals existed because

5703
02:55:16,221 --> 02:55:17,810
they don't seem like they should exist.

5704
02:55:17,811 --> 02:55:22,811
They seem so fantastic and the almost
mythical of these shoe bill birds,

5705
02:55:24,801 --> 02:55:29,801
he's gigantic Berge this enormous long
beak thing that looks like a giant,

5706
02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:31,040
like,

5707
02:55:31,040 --> 02:55:34,250
like I could knew coming out of its
face and it's like five feet tall.

5708
02:55:34,251 --> 02:55:34,880
It's walked,

5709
02:55:34,880 --> 02:55:36,680
it's prehistoric and there's fish.

5710
02:55:36,681 --> 02:55:41,300
The climb out of the water and walk till
they get to the next pond and dive in.

5711
02:55:41,301 --> 02:55:45,470
There's antelopes that have evolved
the swim underwater and eat fish.

5712
02:55:45,770 --> 02:55:47,210
They have an antelope that eats fish.

5713
02:55:47,211 --> 02:55:47,481
Man,

5714
02:55:47,481 --> 02:55:49,310
it can swim under water a hundred yards.

5715
02:55:49,520 --> 02:55:51,050
And it's in the antelope family.

5716
02:55:51,650 --> 02:55:56,300
There's rhinos and elephants that are
trapped inside this rain forest because

5717
02:55:56,301 --> 02:55:58,760
the grasslands turned to
rain forest and all these,

5718
02:55:58,970 --> 02:56:01,100
these plains animals just got stuck there.

5719
02:56:01,190 --> 02:56:04,730
So you see these herds of
gazelles running through swamps.

5720
02:56:05,030 --> 02:56:06,710
It's madness.

5721
02:56:06,980 --> 02:56:09,470
I mean Africa is fucking incredible.

5722
02:56:09,471 --> 02:56:10,250
And that,

5723
02:56:10,250 --> 02:56:11,570
that somehow or another,

5724
02:56:11,571 --> 02:56:12,890
those animals are in jeopardy,

5725
02:56:12,891 --> 02:56:15,260
that the gorillas that come
down off the mountains,

5726
02:56:15,261 --> 02:56:16,490
you see them walk through these,

5727
02:56:16,640 --> 02:56:19,850
these little dirt roads walk across these
dirt roads and a family and the male

5728
02:56:19,851 --> 02:56:22,010
grills looking out if they're wild.

5729
02:56:22,160 --> 02:56:27,160
He's a wild gorillas today in 2014 like
we have to do something to save those

5730
02:56:28,641 --> 02:56:29,474
fucking things.

5731
02:56:29,600 --> 02:56:33,530
I mean I don't necessarily think it's
keeping them in fences and shoot arrows

5732
02:56:33,531 --> 02:56:34,071
out of me either.

5733
02:56:34,071 --> 02:56:35,500
I mean I think this,

5734
02:56:35,790 --> 02:56:36,650
this is a,

5735
02:56:36,651 --> 02:56:37,670
this is a crazy thing.

5736
02:56:37,671 --> 02:56:40,610
Like you have the most
incredible diversity of life,

5737
02:56:40,820 --> 02:56:42,680
of exotic life in the world,

5738
02:56:42,681 --> 02:56:44,600
all coming from the place where life,

5739
02:56:44,720 --> 02:56:48,230
human life apparently
was originated and the,

5740
02:56:48,240 --> 02:56:51,200
and when people are conscious
they'll want to enjoy those things.

5741
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:54,680
Cause it's part of the fucking magic
of this crazy blue rock that we're on.

5742
02:56:54,681 --> 02:56:55,070
You know,

5743
02:56:55,070 --> 02:56:55,903
it is.

5744
02:56:55,940 --> 02:56:57,830
And as soon as seaworld gets shut down,

5745
02:56:58,070 --> 02:56:59,260
the next thing is zoos.

5746
02:56:59,290 --> 02:57:00,630
You take your kids to the zoo now.

5747
02:57:01,640 --> 02:57:02,500
Now I can.

5748
02:57:02,520 --> 02:57:04,850
I know why you can't and won't
be Susan the future folks.

5749
02:57:05,060 --> 02:57:06,560
We're going to realize how gross that is.

5750
02:57:07,100 --> 02:57:08,570
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,

5751
02:57:08,630 --> 02:57:09,470
this has been fun.

5752
02:57:09,500 --> 02:57:10,333
It's always fun.

5753
02:57:10,370 --> 02:57:10,900
Um,

5754
02:57:10,900 --> 02:57:11,130
we,

5755
02:57:11,130 --> 02:57:13,410
we appreciate very much
all the love that we get.

5756
02:57:13,430 --> 02:57:18,380
A Twitter comedy shows just the
vibe that we're all riding on,

5757
02:57:18,381 --> 02:57:18,681
you know,

5758
02:57:18,681 --> 02:57:20,420
and like we said,

5759
02:57:20,421 --> 02:57:21,770
there's hiccups along the way.

5760
02:57:21,771 --> 02:57:23,690
There's blots of negativity,

5761
02:57:24,050 --> 02:57:26,600
but there's lessons to be learned
and all of those things for me,

5762
02:57:26,601 --> 02:57:27,261
for you,

5763
02:57:27,261 --> 02:57:28,100
for all of us.

5764
02:57:28,430 --> 02:57:28,761
And,

5765
02:57:28,761 --> 02:57:29,061
uh,

5766
02:57:29,061 --> 02:57:31,910
I think one of the most important
things about having these kinds of

5767
02:57:31,911 --> 02:57:32,571
conversations,

5768
02:57:32,571 --> 02:57:35,510
you get to highlight these things and
we all get to think of these things

5769
02:57:35,511 --> 02:57:37,460
together and we all get to
acknowledge that these are,

5770
02:57:37,490 --> 02:57:38,130
you know,

5771
02:57:38,130 --> 02:57:38,340
we,

5772
02:57:38,340 --> 02:57:41,360
we were all experiencing
life in this weird,

5773
02:57:41,450 --> 02:57:42,081
strange,

5774
02:57:42,081 --> 02:57:43,910
figure it out as you go along style,

5775
02:57:44,330 --> 02:57:44,900
you know,

5776
02:57:44,900 --> 02:57:48,410
don't be too harsh on people
bitches get it together.

5777
02:57:48,500 --> 02:57:49,080
I try to be nice,

5778
02:57:49,080 --> 02:57:52,460
be good to your brothers and sisters and
the earth to your brothers and sisters

5779
02:57:52,461 --> 02:57:53,001
and the earth.

5780
02:57:53,001 --> 02:57:53,834
And on that note,

5781
02:57:54,050 --> 02:57:55,370

We got a pod cast filled week,

5787
02:58:10,531 --> 02:58:11,311
ladies and gentlemen,

5788
02:58:11,311 --> 02:58:14,490
including late night episode 500.

5789
02:58:14,520 --> 02:58:19,520
It will take place Tuesday night at 9:00
PM with the Great Doug Stan hope and

5790
02:58:19,861 --> 02:58:21,030
the great Tom Rhodes.

5791
02:58:21,360 --> 02:58:23,520
Oh good googly Mooglie.

5792
02:58:23,700 --> 02:58:28,050
Maybe possibly the greatest drunk podcast
of all will be this Tuesday night,

5793
02:58:28,290 --> 02:58:29,370
and you'd have to look forward to that.

5794
02:58:29,440 --> 02:58:29,850
Alright,

5795
02:58:29,850 --> 02:58:30,683
we love you.

5796
02:58:31,010 --> 02:58:31,980
Take care of big kiss.

5797
02:58:50,400 --> 02:58:51,140
Hey,

5798
02:58:51,140 --> 02:58:52,410
Ooh.
