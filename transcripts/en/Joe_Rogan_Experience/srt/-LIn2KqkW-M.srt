1
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,090
Experience,

2
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,440
ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,160
Maxwell fresh from Australia,

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,870
international man of mystery,

5
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:20,860
world traveler,

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,330
trainer of the stars.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,260
You're out there buddy.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,303
Good Day mate.

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,120
They a they call it stray.

10
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:28,630
Yeah.

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,690
S t r y a stray.

12
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:32,524
I was,

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,180
that was checking out my uh,

14
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,190
my Australian memes,

15
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:36,501
you know,

16
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:37,334
all the uh,

17
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,403
Australian slang,

18
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,493
pretty funny man.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,590
You can go online and Google this stuff.

20
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:43,810
There's some of those things they
have are absolutely hilarious.

21
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,380
So you were telling me before the show
that you just started getting into t h c

22
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,280
a k a

23
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,250
marijuana.

24
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:52,521
You know,

25
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:52,941
it's funny,

26
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:55,760
I'm a child of the 60s and the 70s,

27
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,631
and you know,

28
00:00:56,631 --> 00:01:00,320
that was the huge hippie
era and I was a wrestler.

29
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:02,300
I was like hardcore athlete,

30
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:04,340
wrestled Ncaa Division One.

31
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:05,174
And um,

32
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,050
for me at that time I believed
all the anti propaganda,

33
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,330
you know,

34
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,810
I was a pretty straight laced guy and uh,

35
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:12,590
so you know,

36
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:12,831
oh,

37
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:14,810
it's a gateway drug and Oh my God,

38
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:17,810
you're going to go to hell in
a hand basket and you know,

39
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,120
this stuff will destroy your brain and,

40
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,021
and you know,

41
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:21,261
blah,

42
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:21,441
blah,

43
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:21,830
blah.

44
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,910
You've heard it all of course.

45
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,020
And um,

46
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,853
what was that?

47
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,240
What was that really funny?

48
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:28,890
A anti marijuana movie that
they had back in the madness?

49
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,520
Reefer madness.

50
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,610
I actually,

51
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,400
we had to watch that in health
class when I was in high school.

52
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,181
Yeah.

53
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:38,630
There's part of the school curriculum
back in the 60 [inaudible] so they showed

54
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:38,901
it to you,

55
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:40,080
like is this real?

56
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:40,431
Yeah,

57
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:41,151
like it was real.

58
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:41,931
We all believe that.

59
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:44,030
So remember I was from little,

60
00:01:44,031 --> 00:01:44,630
uh,

61
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,201
Carlisle,

62
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:45,801
Pennsylvania,

63
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:46,440
you know,

64
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,650
got some of me that's like a hick town.

65
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,370
So yeah,

66
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,490
I just recently saw reason,

67
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,450
uh,

68
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,910
just about maybe six months ago.

69
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,691
What happened?

70
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:00,524
What started it off?

71
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,071
You know,

72
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:03,560
I just had so many
friends who were into it.

73
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,870
And it's interesting
because I made observations.

74
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,580
Uh,

75
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,500
I've been in Brazilian Jujitsu now for,

76
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,341
oh my God,

77
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:11,031
since 89.

78
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:11,781
How many years is that?

79
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:12,614
Like,

80
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,880
yeah,

81
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,020
20 something.

82
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,530
Yeah.

83
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:15,920
Okay.

84
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,700
Probably 6.6.

85
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,090
Oh my.

86
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,421
Well,

87
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:23,421
most every BJJ champ that I
know was totally into marijuana.

88
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,690
They give it to use it to relax
because it's such an intense sport,

89
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:27,440
you know?

90
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,711
I mean,

91
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:28,471
if you think about it,

92
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:29,900
it's such an extremist thing.

93
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:30,470
Um,

94
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,011
what do you do?

95
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:33,680
You go out and try to hurt
someone as much as possible,

96
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,480
but joint locks and so forth,

97
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,100
and what were you choke him to sleep.

98
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,413
Right?

99
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,320
Of course that being said,

100
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:43,010
I had way more injuries with the
college wrestling that I ever did with,

101
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,731
with Jujitsu,

102
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:44,780
cause he can always tap.

103
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,560
Right?

104
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,760
But I just noticed that these guys,

105
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:46,911
you know,

106
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:47,780
it's an intense sport,

107
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,000
maybe not as intense as MMA,

108
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:54,950
but it's certainly up there and they
all would light up at night and so forth

109
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,701
and you know,

110
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:56,840
that has her bongs or,

111
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:57,380
you know,

112
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,460
roll up a joint.

113
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,391
And I,

114
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:00,160
I could just never

115
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,851
figure this out.

116
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:02,110
It just would blow my mind.

117
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,950
Right.

118
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,160
And over time I just got
more and more curious.

119
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,420
So,

120
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,150
um,

121
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,600
I had,

122
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,770
I had a lot of friends in Australia
that were really totally into this also.

123
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,173
And uh,

124
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,501
I just decided,

125
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,100
you know what,

126
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,650
maybe I'm missing something here.

127
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,973
You know,

128
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,920
now that I'm in my sixties,

129
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:21,754
you know,

130
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,500
I missed the sixties so I made my
sixties so I'm going to check this out.

131
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:27,550
So I started playing around.

132
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,451
I've got one of those.

133
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:28,750
Um,

134
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,070
what I didn't like was the smoke,

135
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,330
I find it really irritating,

136
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,890
but I tried one of those,

137
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,120
the cost to the vape,

138
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,520
it's like a little square box
with a little straw books.

139
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:37,180
I can,

140
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,680
we take a little kid's juice box,

141
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,943
right?

142
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,590
Adult juice sparks,

143
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,400
they have a bunch of those
now have pens that like,

144
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:46,570
they look like a,

145
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,980
like some sort of a metal cylinder
with like a lip on the end of it.

146
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,813
And you and you,

147
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,970
you pack it with either oil that you
can buy pre prefilled little tubes of,

148
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,410
of hemp oil or THC oil and stick it in
there and it has some sort of an element

149
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:04,180
in there and it heats it up
and you're just breathing.

150
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,800
And vapors is a vaporizer,

151
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,180
a portable vaporizer.

152
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,770
So yeah,

153
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,690
I was just very curious and um,

154
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,461
well I,

155
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:12,081
I mean I,

156
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:12,970
I you,

157
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:14,470
you've been into this for a long time.

158
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,120
Very open about it and I thought,

159
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:16,650
well,

160
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,280
you are really into your health and
your body and you take great care of

161
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:22,114
yourself,

162
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,680
and I figured,

163
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:24,160
you know,

164
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,470
if it's really all that harmful,

165
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,360
Joe wouldn't be doing this.

166
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,540
There's no way that you
would do something like that.

167
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,930
Yeah,

168
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,711
I was with you.

169
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:34,360
I mean before I started smoking pot,

170
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,230
I was in the same boat.

171
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,670
I really thought it was for idiots.

172
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,460
I thought it was for people that
just wanted to escape reality.

173
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:40,294
There were weak,

174
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,380
they couldn't handle it.

175
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,820
They just wanted to get drugged out.

176
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,090
I thought about it the same way
I think about pain pills today.

177
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:46,831
Like I,

178
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:47,260
I've,

179
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,093
I took,

180
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,590
I've had three knee surgeries.

181
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,120
My first major one,

182
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:55,360
my first ACL was a Patella tendon graft,

183
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:55,931
which is kind of,

184
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:58,900
it was particularly painful because
they slice your patella tendon,

185
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,850
they cut a chunk out of your knee cap and
a chunk out of your Shin Bone and then

186
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:06,280
they drill it all in place
and screw it in place.

187
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:09,210
It's good because it's a
native piece of tendon.

188
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:09,861
So it,

189
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:10,071
it,

190
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:10,370
it,

191
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:10,670
it,

192
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:15,130
it hears the body very quickly and there's
very little chance of rejection and

193
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:15,970
it's a very strong,

194
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,231
but uh,

195
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:21,280
it's very painful and they gave me a
prescription for Vicodin or some shit.

196
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,731
I took,

197
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:26,731
one of them won and I remember sitting
on the couch feeling so stupid and foggy

198
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,451
and I said,

199
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:29,800
I am done with this.

200
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,500
My other two surgeries,

201
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:32,830
my,

202
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,990
my other ACL and my
other meniscus surgery,

203
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:35,824
I didn't take anything.

204
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,461
My knee,

205
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,450
my a nose.

206
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,770
When I had my nose fixed,

207
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,480
I had my deviated septum fixed
and my turbinates cutout,

208
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,860
my no stretched out and they
put tubes in and everything.

209
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,760
Nothing.

210
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,630
I didn't take anything,

211
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,703
just pot.

212
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,720
And,

213
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,553
um,

214
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,860
I don't like,

215
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,360
I don't like anything that leaves me like
cloudy and that seems like that's what

216
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:56,740
I thought pot was.

217
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,250
I thought pot was something
that left you stupid or cloudy

218
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,650
and it's really just,

219
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,670
it's the opposite.

220
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,020
It tunes you in.

221
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,913
I was shocked.

222
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,600
I was utterly shocked.

223
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,510
The first thing I noticed
was my vision improved.

224
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,400
I've been near side and most of my life.

225
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,720
And um,

226
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,470
I basically found my eyes
were getting worse each year,

227
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,910
getting stronger prescriptions.

228
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,440
I finally read this book,

229
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:21,940
take off your glasses and see.

230
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,230
And uh,

231
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,920
I just basically threw my glasses
in the trash and started doing ice

232
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,060
strengthening exercises.

233
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:28,870
Kind of neat.

234
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,250
I'm going through that right now myself.

235
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,390
They improved a lot.

236
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,430
There's a lot of different
exercises you can do,

237
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:34,264
but um,

238
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,070
the,

239
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,390
the name of the book is take
off your glasses and say,

240
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:37,930
hmm.

241
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,140
And this guy was a disciple
of the Bates method of,

242
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,500
uh,

243
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,490
I strengthening,

244
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,150
but when I was at the summit of
the breath masters in Moscow,

245
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:47,980
they had a bunch of guys there that,

246
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:48,100
uh,

247
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,270
we're using a breathing and I exercise
and all sorts of stuff for the

248
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:53,110
improvement of vision.

249
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,730
One was a former,

250
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:55,240
uh,

251
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,310
Spetsnaz snipers,

252
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,630
so I guess he knows a thing
or two about vision training.

253
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,400
And he was showing some of
the August just has a seizure.

254
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:01,571
I was,

255
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:01,731
you know,

256
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:02,564
a real simple stuff.

257
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,240
And it was like,

258
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:04,511
wow,

259
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:05,380
this works.

260
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,490
But only to a point.

261
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,060
It got really good to the point
where I can drive during the day.

262
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,940
I still a little reluctant
to drive at night.

263
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,720
I mean,

264
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,553
I could,

265
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,230
but I can't read street signs at night.

266
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,341
During the day.

267
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:20,230
I can actually see signs,

268
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:21,970
uh,

269
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,120
but I'm a little reluctant and the,

270
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:25,720
um,

271
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,740
but I noticed with the,

272
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:28,300
when I would take the THC,

273
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,380
I was using one of those vaporizer things.

274
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,710
It was like my eyes would
start to really clear,

275
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,940
which leads me to believe that it has
something to do with muscular tension.

276
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,130
I noticed that my digestion would
improved and instead of getting foggy,

277
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,460
like I would be on my iPad,

278
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,880
maybe doing an email or something,

279
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,800
it's like somehow my fingers would just
glide over the keys and just magically

280
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:53,050
find the letters way faster.

281
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:56,110
Or at least my perception
of how much faster.

282
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,041
I Dunno.

283
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,930
It was just a very interesting experience.

284
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,480
Well,

285
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,590
one of the things that people use it for
with Jujitsu is not just to relax after

286
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:04,041
training,

287
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:08,000
but before training because it focuses
you in a very tunnel vision sort of a

288
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:08,660
way.

289
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,890
When a eye roll,

290
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,420
when I smoked pot and role,

291
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,820
I feel like I'm better at Jujitsu.

292
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,601
I really do.

293
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:16,420
I feel like more relaxed I feel,

294
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,540
and not just more relaxed.

295
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,370
I feel like I'm more sensitive.

296
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,740
I'm like more in tune
with what's going on.

297
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,551
I'm also,

298
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:24,200
I love stretching on it.

299
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,880
That's one of my favorite things to do.

300
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,380
I love eating one of those things.

301
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,160
Those jumbos I just gave you that say,

302
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:29,840
yeah,

303
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,200
I haven't tried eating it.

304
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,460
That's an all organic edible,

305
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,670
a THC,

306
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:34,911
you know,

307
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:35,680
marijuana,

308
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,070
little cake thing.

309
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,790
And it's all with natural honey
and all natural ingredients.

310
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,450
It's like probably the healthiest of all
these edible ones cause a lot of these

311
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:48,680
edible ones are using processed sugars
and high fructose corn syrup and stuff.

312
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,760
It's not good for you.

313
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:51,440
So this guy who created these,

314
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:52,160
he decided,

315
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,500
you know,

316
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,520
there's gotta be an market for an
organic of these marijuana edibles.

317
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,860
So that's much healthier for your body,

318
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:00,630
but it's a really strong,

319
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:02,670
be careful now going to be very careful.

320
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,040
Um,

321
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,540
uh,

322
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,020
you know,

323
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,920
I have not,

324
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,251
uh,

325
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:07,050
in truth taking it before I've trained,

326
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:09,570
but I read about the guy in Colorado,

327
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:10,710
the triathlete,

328
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,750
he's world class athlete,

329
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:13,920
um,

330
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,230
very elite and he,

331
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:18,240
he's been really advocating taking
it before endurance training.

332
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,390
Somehow it improves a pain threshold.

333
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,741
Your,

334
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:24,330
your tolerance to physical exercise,

335
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:24,541
pain,

336
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,410
not pain,

337
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:25,970
pain,

338
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,250
right?

339
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,280
But like exercise and do discomfort.

340
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,370
It changes the way your body reacts.

341
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,440
It changes the way your body reacts and
any sort of when I work out with it.

342
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:37,620
But if I lift weights with it,

343
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,371
I like,

344
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:41,880
I can feel the fibers or at
least I feel like I'm feeling,

345
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,190
I feel the fibers of my muscles.

346
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,050
I feel I'm very sensitive to it,

347
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,500
which is one of the reasons why I really
enjoyed doing it before I stretch.

348
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,420
And Terence Mckenna,

349
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,460
who is a late,

350
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:54,960
great psychedelic philosopher,

351
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:55,320
he,

352
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,320
it was his contention that yoga itself
was really a how to use cannabis manual

353
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,760
and that the way to optimize your
experience with cannabis was through yoga.

354
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,590
Cause all of those saw dues.

355
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,650
All those guys are just
a hash smoking freaks.

356
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,370
They're all like one that's like the dark
secret of the sod dues he would say is

357
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,730
what they really concentrate on is how
many chillums can you smoke before you

358
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:18,564
pass out?

359
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,051
And they,

360
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:19,261
you know,

361
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:21,030
you're not a man unless you can go deep,

362
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:21,271
deep,

363
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:22,380
deep into the rabbit hole.

364
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,170
And these guys would smoke massive
amounts of Hash and do yoga.

365
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,160
And,

366
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,461
you know,

367
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:29,740
I,

368
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,281
I used to think,

369
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:30,541
oh wow,

370
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,380
that's kind of crazy.

371
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,120
Like I guess they're just having fun and
doing it until the one time I did yoga

372
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:37,860
when I was high and I was like,

373
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:38,694
wow,

374
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,320
this is amazing.

375
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,310
It's like I can relax more
and get deeper into poses.

376
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,090
And also I feel like I feel this,

377
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,480
the resistance,

378
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,643
like a lot of,

379
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,280
uh,

380
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,000
Pavel,

381
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,300
uh,

382
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,860
talks about this as well.

383
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,300
I don't know how to say his last name.

384
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:54,891
How do you say his last,

385
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:59,891
that sewing sat soling who's a one of
the most famous advocates of the Kettle

386
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,050
Bell,

387
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:01,441
he,

388
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:01,680
uh,

389
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,680
talked about stretching being a big part
of what holds you back is a tension,

390
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:07,980
psychological tension,

391
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:09,810
not necessarily even flexibility,

392
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,350
but that you're worried about your
brain sets up that stretch reflex.

393
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:13,990
Yeah.

394
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,750
When you're in an unfamiliar position.

395
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:16,291
So it's,

396
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:16,561
you know,

397
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:17,730
it's saying danger.

398
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:20,900
You're in a different position
than you're used to being in.

399
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,840
For most of us that's sitting
in chairs or most most people,

400
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,530
right?

401
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,070
Yeah.

402
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,850
That's the most,

403
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,150
yeah,

404
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,500
that's the most common position.

405
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:28,920
Right.

406
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,390
And when your head's in between your legs
and you're stretching your hamstrings

407
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:33,661
out,

408
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:33,841
you know,

409
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:33,990
you,

410
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,700
your body is threatened by that.

411
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,300
But was like,

412
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,410
what are you doing there buddy?

413
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,160
Tents it up,

414
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,993
tents it out.

415
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,993
Um,

416
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,290
what he was saying was that
it's all about like breathing,

417
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,680
like resist and then relax.

418
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,793
Resist.

419
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,143
And they were,

420
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,180
but that resist and relax is enhanced.

421
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,130
I don't know how many fold
when you're on marijuana.

422
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:54,491
I mean,

423
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:58,840
it's amazing how deep you
go into stretches and how
good it feels afterwards.

424
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:04,030
Is this weird state your reach when you
do yoga or any type of deep stretching

425
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:05,861
on marijuana?

426
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:06,790
I'm a huge,

427
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:07,660
huge fan of that.

428
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,920
Well that's it.

429
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:10,030
I'm a neophyte man.

430
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,750
Uh,

431
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,830
teach me master.

432
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,220
I,

433
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,780
yeah,

434
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,800
I think it's amazing and never let
it be said to Steve Maxwell doesn't

435
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,061
experiment.

436
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:18,820
And you know,

437
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,420
I,

438
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,920
I really think that one of the secrets
to aging well is to be open minded and

439
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:26,470
just to experiment and learn new things.

440
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:27,430
Try New things.

441
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,300
And Jill,

442
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,520
be such a stick in the mud with,

443
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,020
with your belief systems,

444
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:32,854
you know,

445
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,240
don't get so holier than thou with all,

446
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:37,130
all your beliefs because hey man,

447
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,051
you know,

448
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:38,920
have you think about it?

449
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,930
A lot of really high spiritual adepts,

450
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,630
they all use some type of either,

451
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,111
you know,

452
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:49,111
a hallucinogen or when we talked to last
time and the show about Iowasca and so

453
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:50,780
forth and you know,

454
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,310
the shape and the shamans use
and they're raw mushrooms.

455
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:56,230
And I think as you get older,

456
00:12:56,231 --> 00:13:01,180
I think especially when you
have been around a lot of fools,

457
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,740
you reach a certain point in your life
where you don't want to tolerate any

458
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,410
nonsense and you're just like God,

459
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,420
enough of this nonsense like
what you need is you know,

460
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,270
a nice,

461
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,010
a good diet.

462
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,060
You don't need any supplements.

463
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:14,860
You don't even need any
hooey and your life.

464
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,000
You don't need any BS.

465
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,010
Just get out of bed and go out and do it.

466
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,150
And that,

467
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,980
that sort of mentality serves you well.

468
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,370
But in having that mentality
and meeting all these fools,

469
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,030
sometimes you can kind
of develop prejudices.

470
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,460
You develop these ideas that
aren't necessarily based on data.

471
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,230
It's more based on like sort of just
your perceptions of the people that are

472
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,400
around you.

473
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,830
Like if you see enough
losers that do something,

474
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:39,051
you'd say,

475
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,060
well that's for losers.

476
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,940
He see enough losers that are smoking pot.

477
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:43,151
You think,

478
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:43,261
well,

479
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:45,190
pawn is for losers is obvious.

480
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,700
Like look at all these losers spoken
pot and then you meet like Bj Penn.

481
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:48,881
You're like,

482
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:49,081
wait,

483
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:49,181
wait,

484
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:49,481
hold on.

485
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:50,011
Bj Penn,

486
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:51,310
good high and does Jujitsu.

487
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,173
Like wow,

488
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,051
what's going on there?

489
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:53,361
And then you,

490
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:53,711
you know,

491
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:53,941
you,

492
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:54,121
you,

493
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:58,750
you find out that 90% of the Brazilian
Jujitsu champions are smoking pot and

494
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:00,010
rolling this stuff.

495
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,280
Yeah.

496
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,790
So it's an,

497
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,070
it's a performance enhancer.

498
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:05,470
There was actually an article
recently about ultra marathoners.

499
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,071
Jamie,

500
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:06,821
see if he can pull that up.

501
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:07,211
Cause it was,

502
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,460
I forget what publication it was in,

503
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,670
but it was a big article where people
were really being really shocked at these

504
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:20,020
are the results and these guys that were
ultra marathoners that we're advocating

505
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:21,100
smoking marijuana.

506
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,920
And they were talking about should
this be banned from ultra marathon?

507
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,490
Well I'll outside magazine also a thing
could have been outside of there as soon

508
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,160
as that Fox was right here and there
were a bunch of different things.

509
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:31,750
Yes,

510
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,130
marijuana has benefits,

511
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:34,030
but is it ethical?

512
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:34,241
Yeah.

513
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,074
See this is the thing.

514
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,210
Well people of course it's ethical.

515
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,560
Is Our vitamins ethical?

516
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:39,760
Is Fruit ethical?

517
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,810
Is Caffeine ethical?

518
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,980
It's a God damn plant.

519
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,840
I mean these people are all on caffeine.

520
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,530
By the way.

521
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,990
Here's the dirty secret
about marathon runners ultra.

522
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,850
I have a buddy who is my friend,

523
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:50,830
Cameron Hanes is a fanatical runner.

524
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:52,610
He 10 miles a day,

525
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:53,840
sometimes 15.

526
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,040
He does marathons,

527
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,180
he's done an ultra marathon.

528
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:57,890
I think he's gearing up
for another ultra marathon.

529
00:14:57,891 --> 00:15:02,570
He's a maniac and he's always
hopped up on the caffeine always.

530
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,040
But he has a job,

531
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,960
like a regular job and
he can't touch the pot.

532
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,970
And I've been telling them
about all this and he's like,

533
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:09,890
maybe it was another good
reason why I should quit my job.

534
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,813
Yeah.

535
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:12,920
You know,

536
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,371
it's,

537
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,204
um,

538
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,330
there's another very interesting
thing I've been experimenting with,

539
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:18,260
but for years,

540
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,071
and that's the,

541
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:19,610
uh,

542
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,780
the state of brainwave
meditation where you actually,

543
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,960
your brain produces different
levels of brainwaves.

544
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,530
Your brain oscillates at certain speeds
and different parts of the brain produce

545
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:31,920
different,

546
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,300
you know,

547
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,020
like Alpha,

548
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,800
Beta,

549
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,633
gamma,

550
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,151
Delta,

551
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:35,840
theta.

552
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,860
But they just like the one that's most
closely associated with that sort of

553
00:15:39,861 --> 00:15:41,810
between sleep and wakefulness.

554
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,330
When the subconscious
mind can be programmed.

555
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,171
And,

556
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:45,261
uh,

557
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:46,910
there's a lot of really
good programs out there.

558
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,120
It produces a beat and then your brain
starts to adapt and copied the beat.

559
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,730
And you can slow the brainwave dam.

560
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,840
It's what I did in the plane.

561
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:57,620
I just,

562
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,041
like I said,

563
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:03,041
I flew in from Sydney like 14 hour flight
man and didn't really get that much

564
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:03,920
sleep,

565
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,900
but I did one of those [inaudible]
beats theta brainwave meditation.

566
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,880
Now this you're wearing headphones?

567
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:11,030
I,

568
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,300
yeah,

569
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,541
yeah.

570
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,400
I actually was using a Bose earbuds,

571
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,480
noise cancellations and just sitting
there with my iPhone and just wow.

572
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,383
Zoning.

573
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,560
And you,

574
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,850
when you come out of it,

575
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,220
you feel like you just
had a refreshing sleep.

576
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,451
Really?

577
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:26,751
Yeah.

578
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:27,710
It's very,

579
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,730
very relaxing.

580
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:30,260
Speaking of relaxation.

581
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,270
And so for those folks that are still
a little leery about maybe trying

582
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,320
something like THC,

583
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,780
you can do this with the
theta brainwave meditation.

584
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,110
All of the brainwaves
like have their benefits.

585
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,050
The alphas,

586
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,510
like what we're in right now,

587
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,740
the Alpha and the,

588
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:46,270
uh,

589
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,103
the Beta,

590
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,620
like while we're awake.

591
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,930
GAM is like when you're
in a real deep sleep,

592
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:52,400
like real deep dream,

593
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:53,210
like state,

594
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,710
the theaters like that twilight,

595
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,461
you know,

596
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:56,480
when you're the,

597
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,740
this is when,

598
00:16:57,741 --> 00:16:58,760
when people meditate,

599
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:02,420
they go into a theta brainwave state.

600
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,160
But by listening,

601
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,880
you could meditate like a
monk your first time out man.

602
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,600
Wow.

603
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,040
Yeah.

604
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,880
It doesn't require any special
breathing or postures or anything.

605
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,990
You could just literally sit or lie down
comfortably and he's just going into

606
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:18,824
the zone.

607
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,840
And if you do practice visualization or
if you practice any kind of affirmations

608
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:26,750
or subconscious mind programming,

609
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,250
it's a great time to do it,

610
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:28,730
man.

611
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,530
So you're listening to a program,

612
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:31,930
what is the name of the
program and how do you get,

613
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,440
there's a whole bunch of different ones.

614
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:33,980
You know,

615
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,870
you can go to Amazon or iTunes and just
look for a theta brainwave meditation.

616
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,741
I'd recommend,

617
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:40,940
maybe people just go on,

618
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,270
uh,

619
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,511
you know,

620
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:43,490
just Google it and look at the different,

621
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,620
I mean there's so many different
companies out there now.

622
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,120
You can get cds,

623
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:48,710
you can get a um,

624
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,350
uh,

625
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,550
[inaudible],

626
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,300
uh,

627
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,390
you can get it downloaded.

628
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:52,830
An Rj,

629
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,820
I have it on my iPhone.

630
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:54,780
That's great.

631
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,080
It doesn't programs and
it's really handy for,

632
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,180
for guys like us cause you do your fair
share of travel when you have to adapt

633
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:04,050
to a new time zone.

634
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,780
And it's pretty hard to sleep
in some of these points?

635
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:07,690
Sometimes do.

636
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:07,921
Yeah.

637
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,420
It's hard for me to sleep on planes.

638
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,254
It's also hard for,

639
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:10,621
well,

640
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:10,931
you know,

641
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:11,041
if,

642
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:15,060
if I'm tired I can conk out pretty
much far down on the floor it goes.

643
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:15,391
But,

644
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:15,750
um,

645
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,460
it's hard for me when I have
to do something like three
hours and I know well I

646
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:22,020
can take a nap right now for two hours.

647
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,943
Good luck.

648
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,250
Almost makes you feel worse than
if he didn't take it at all,

649
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,530
which I lie there and I go,

650
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,280
I go to sleep,

651
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:29,821
come on.

652
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:31,140
I usually can't get there.

653
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,760
But you slept the earphones on,

654
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:33,350
but your,

655
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,760
your binary or beat,

656
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:35,660
that's just like a one,

657
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,020
one of the programs.

658
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:37,980
What does it sound like?

659
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,030
Um,

660
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,440
well sometimes they use music.

661
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,390
You can hear like an underlying beat.

662
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:45,150
It's just underneath the
conscious hearing and,

663
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,013
but you can,

664
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,410
you can kind of hear like a little rhythm
going on and sometimes they'll have

665
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:51,060
the beautiful kind of angelic,

666
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,661
you know,

667
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:52,494
music.

668
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:52,890
Uh,

669
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,230
sometimes they just have
like sounds of the ocean,

670
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:55,951
you know,

671
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:56,910
like ocean waves,

672
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,380
incredibly relaxing.

673
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,940
And you just find yourself zoning
and when you finish the program,

674
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:08,300
you really do feel like you had just a
very nice refreshing sleep and you feel

675
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:09,804
quite,

676
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,883
quite excellent.

677
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,890
So they vary in the sounds,

678
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:17,140
but the beat stimulates
the same part of the brain.

679
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,010
There's a couple of different techniques.

680
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:19,740
So one,

681
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,310
uh,

682
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,180
what are the techniques?

683
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:24,180
They have a different
rhythm going in each year.

684
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:24,900
Wow.

685
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,710
So the right and left hemispheres
have to synchronize with each other.

686
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,640
What if you're bipolar?

687
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,560
I don't know man.

688
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,773
Yeah,

689
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,783
man.

690
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,340
You know that I,

691
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,510
I'm sort you out.

692
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,431
Mean I'm not a,

693
00:19:37,431 --> 00:19:38,580
I'm not a brain scientist,

694
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:41,520
but I have been doing this for a
bunch of years with good results,

695
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:45,330
but I don't know if maybe if you have
a mental illness or bipolar sent them,

696
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,380
but they do claim that it
regulates your hormonal levels.

697
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,891
Really.

698
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:50,460
Yeah.

699
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,840
And there's even,

700
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,810
there's a,

701
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,180
even to the point of producing
growth hormone and so forth,

702
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,870
have you ever messed
around with any of those?

703
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,340
Um,

704
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:01,430
uh,

705
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,000
do you know the turbo sonic is,

706
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,300
it uses sound waves through
the base of a platform.

707
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:07,200
You stand on this and it,

708
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,580
and it takes you through a bunch of
different cycles I have and its sound,

709
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:12,420
but you don't hear it.

710
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:12,940
It's like you're,

711
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,940
you're standing on a
stage just getting fucked,

712
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,511
shaking,

713
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:16,310
just getting vibed.

714
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,550
You'll have loved that thing.

715
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:20,910
I have one of those things in my house
and it's supposed to like do all sorts of

716
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:25,911
things as far as stimulate the production
of various hormones and you know,

717
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,121
an aid,

718
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:28,800
healing and circulation.

719
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,900
But it makes you feel great,

720
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,920
but there's not ways you
can just exercise and,

721
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:34,170
and,

722
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,850
and do vibrations and so forth.

723
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:36,121
You know,

724
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:37,530
and trampolines are really good for that,

725
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:37,770
right?

726
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:37,981
Yeah.

727
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:38,400
Yeah.

728
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,120
I mean the Dallas Yogis and the she Kong,

729
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,910
uh,

730
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,450
uh,

731
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,780
practitioners have been doing
similar things with their own bodies.

732
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,480
I mean obviously the platform
makes it much more convenient.

733
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:49,631
Oh,

734
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:50,441
it's 10 minutes.

735
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:52,000
You get on that sucker for
10 minutes and you're like,

736
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,750
hey [inaudible] he goes
through all these different,

737
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,590
like you'll do like 10 seconds at one
and then 10 seconds at another and then

738
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,371
very fast,

739
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:06,730
high frequency and then
low and slow shaking.

740
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:06,881
I'm,

741
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:07,940
or no,

742
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,200
and when it's all reelect,

743
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:09,611
God,

744
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:10,990
I feel so fantastic.

745
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:11,231
Yeah,

746
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:13,600
it's wild that a felted craze,

747
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,141
he was,

748
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:14,351
you know,

749
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:15,430
they have like a,

750
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,570
a bouncing,

751
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:18,730
shaking vibrational kind of thing.

752
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:20,070
And there's a,

753
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,920
uh,

754
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,371
like I said,

755
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:24,370
the Dow Yoga just have a thing
where they do this kind of stuff.

756
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,793
Uh,

757
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,800
when I was in Russia,

758
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:27,160
they,

759
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,660
they,

760
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,660
they had as part of their raw Slavic
Russian Russian health system.

761
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,910
If their mobility stuff,

762
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,710
they would have shaking
and vibrations and,

763
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,250
and all of the stuff that you
just kind of do it yourself.

764
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:42,790
And I read this guy I'm
Alexandra at and he was a,

765
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,160
like a psychiatrist that
treated people with,

766
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,000
uh,

767
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,331
with,

768
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:46,630
uh,

769
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,860
chronic mental problems with
the exercise and so forth.

770
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:54,850
And really he was really big into
shaking and moving the body and all these

771
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:57,670
interesting patterns
and it's very relaxing,

772
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,170
just gets a lot of the tension out.

773
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,131
And I agree with you.

774
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:00,700
I,

775
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,533
I do believe it,

776
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,270
it does help facilitate a recovery.

777
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,580
I think mental problems and relaxation
are so often not connected with each

778
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:10,120
other.

779
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,180
Mental problems and exercise and exertion.

780
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,730
And the fact that a lot of people,

781
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,760
a lot of the tension comes from a not
releasing energy and their body stores up

782
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:24,970
this energy like a battery and then it's
leaking all over the place that it's

783
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:29,110
just like there's short circuiting when
you see people screaming and traffic and

784
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:29,681
you know,

785
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,390
and cutting people off and right.

786
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,430
All this madness that,

787
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,250
I mean it really is like a form of
madness when you see someone screaming at

788
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:38,230
someone that's not even
anywhere near them and traffic,

789
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,510
the stress levels just get so much.

790
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:43,990
And a lot of that goes also back when
we talked about this last time too about

791
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:44,920
your breathing patterns.

792
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,460
Most people and I do seminars all over
the world and we test ourselves to see

793
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:52,150
what type of breather we are.

794
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:52,360
This,

795
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,560
like one of the things we do first and
amongst everybody in the seminar is like

796
00:22:56,561 --> 00:23:00,130
a Co vicular breathe that they're using
the emergency apparatus of the upper

797
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:00,964
neck and chest,

798
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,170
shallow breathing,

799
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:02,770
breathing,

800
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,030
and it's panic braiding.

801
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:08,860
And all those emergency receptors are
in the upper lobes of the lungs and

802
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:12,070
they're not bringing the Otu
down into the lower lobes.

803
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,410
So they're in a chronic panic,

804
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,310
they're in a heightened state of village.

805
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,590
It's all the time.

806
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:18,940
That's exhausting man.

807
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,990
And it does all sorts of weird things
to your hormones and it definitely,

808
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,850
it's hard to be in a good mood and
relaxed when you're in this panic state.

809
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:30,070
Your subconscious mind doesn't know that.

810
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:34,540
There's not like a threat
looming over the horizon.

811
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,690
So everything that happens
is perceived as a threat.

812
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,340
Every little comment,

813
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:39,970
you know,

814
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,410
someone cuts you off in traffic.

815
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,120
People take it so personally cause it's,

816
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,950
it's a threat because they're
all caught up in the chest.

817
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:46,911
And Man,

818
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:47,391
I'm telling you,

819
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:51,470
when you learn to do proper diaphragmatic
breathing and bringing the breath down

820
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,760
to the lower lobes of the lungs,

821
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,950
it's incredibly calming.

822
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,000
You know,

823
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,833
you can do that with.

824
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,931
So what,

825
00:23:57,931 --> 00:24:01,650
what do you recommend if someone is
looking into doing something like that?

826
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:04,080
Is there a book that you recommend
or a program do you have?

827
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:05,830
Yeah,

828
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,663
one of your seminars.

829
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,360
A lot of breath work,

830
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:08,830
you know,

831
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,480
well master Hixon Gracie now,

832
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,380
uh,

833
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:11,620
if,

834
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,260
I mean for years he never
showed us his breathing system.

835
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,520
You know,

836
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,610
he'd be kicking our ass and doing
this kind of weird breathing.

837
00:24:18,611 --> 00:24:21,310
And I used to think as
he making fun of me,

838
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:21,581
you know,

839
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:23,860
that's kind of what this weird
kind of thing he was doing.

840
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,083
Yeah,

841
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,793
exactly.

842
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,490
All hoists,

843
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,160
Hoy,

844
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,440
you know,

845
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,800
they all knew how to do this and they
weren't teaching us blue and purple belts

846
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:35,950
at the time but now he's
spending a lot of time teaching.

847
00:24:35,951 --> 00:24:40,030
I heard that crown also is spending a
lot of time cause I think it's really,

848
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:42,250
really important for combat athletes to,

849
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:42,700
you know,

850
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,290
learn to read the acts and the way
you relax in combat is through breath

851
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,273
manipulation.

852
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,160
But as far as actually being taught,

853
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,480
I haven't seen it that the systemic
guys do a pretty good job with it,

854
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,523
you know?

855
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:56,951
But,

856
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:57,041
uh,

857
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,150
it's funny because,

858
00:24:58,151 --> 00:24:58,391
you know,

859
00:24:58,391 --> 00:25:00,580
I started really getting
into this reading a lot.

860
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:01,660
Um,

861
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:06,580
but I wasn't reading stuff related to
combat as much as mostly yoga stuff.

862
00:25:06,581 --> 00:25:07,210
You know,

863
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,043
where she come.

864
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:08,981
So,

865
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:09,814
uh,

866
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:10,631
yeah,

867
00:25:10,631 --> 00:25:12,190
it's Kinda hard to find the information.

868
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,061
Yeah,

869
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:13,540
it is.

870
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,940
It's hard to find information.

871
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:18,060
It's hard to know like what's
the best program for you?

872
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,040
I guess you have to try
a few different ones,

873
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,110
what you enjoy or what,

874
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,640
what seems to benefit you.

875
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,361
But I think,

876
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:24,780
um,

877
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,381
when you,

878
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:29,040
especially when you're dealing with
martial arts and you're dealing with,

879
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:29,640
uh,

880
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,200
training and,

881
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,500
uh,

882
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,730
especially competing,

883
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,590
you're dealing with extremely stressful
situations where your body's pushed at a

884
00:25:37,591 --> 00:25:39,000
very high pace where,

885
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:39,361
you know,

886
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:42,870
you reached the point of exhaustion
and then you have to continue for,

887
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:43,051
you know,

888
00:25:43,051 --> 00:25:43,321
three,

889
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:44,730
four minutes while you're exhausted.

890
00:25:44,731 --> 00:25:46,950
Everyone who's ever rolled
has experienced that.

891
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:47,461
You know,

892
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:49,440
you're doing maybe a
seven or nine minute role,

893
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:50,311
which,

894
00:25:50,311 --> 00:25:50,550
uh,

895
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,001
means,

896
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:51,300
uh,

897
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,090
grappling sparring for the uninitiated.

898
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,800
And a lot of times a year,

899
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:56,010
two,

900
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,843
three minutes in,

901
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,700
especially if you're rolling with
someone good and you are exhausted,

902
00:25:59,701 --> 00:26:02,940
totally exhausted and you got to figure
out a way to get to a clinch and just,

903
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:06,950
okay,

904
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,160
let's

905
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,160
try to bring your heart rate down and
try to do just enough to defend and keep

906
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:13,114
moving,

907
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,970
but not enough to totally
tax out your muscles.

908
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,600
And also don't let your mind
get into that panic state.

909
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,010
Like the breath is what controls
that because if he can't breathe,

910
00:26:24,011 --> 00:26:25,090
you're gonna Flake.

911
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,421
Yeah.

912
00:26:25,421 --> 00:26:26,081
I remember,

913
00:26:26,081 --> 00:26:26,914
um,

914
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,930
training with a guy who was
like a real athletic guy,

915
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,130
very strong guy,

916
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,060
but he hadn't done Jujitsu before and
so he was really excited to learn it and

917
00:26:37,061 --> 00:26:39,160
just try to get into Jujitsu and you know,

918
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:42,580
he's in their sparring and he
asked me to spar and I'm like,

919
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:42,960
okay,

920
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,410
all right.

921
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:43,831
You know,

922
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:44,160
uh,

923
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,000
how long have you doing it now?

924
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:45,320
He's like,

925
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,490
AH,

926
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,470
a couple of months and this now.

927
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,430
And I'm just getting into it.

928
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,750
I'm just starting to spar.

929
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:49,321
I'm like,

930
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:49,680
all right,

931
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,400
let's go.

932
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,761
And,

933
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:51,180
uh,

934
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,960
so we started,

935
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,900
I remember I got to position,

936
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:57,300
I like mounted him and I could
feel him just full panic.

937
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,920
His body locked up.

938
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,690
And I remember I'd never felt,

939
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,380
because I'm not usually rolling with
someone who's that inexperience,

940
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,320
so to do like a raw white belts,

941
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:09,090
only been doing it for
a short period of time.

942
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,630
He really didn't know what to do and
he was just locked up and I'm like,

943
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,830
just calm down.

944
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:16,720
Just breathe very,

945
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,880
you know,

946
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,170
it's not going to help you.

947
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,640
Like this is definitely going to hurt you.

948
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,360
You're going to,

949
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,740
you're going to get tapped out either way.

950
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,741
But if you,

951
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:24,870
if you breathe in,

952
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,180
you're going to be able to keep going
and you're going to be able to learn.

953
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:27,840
And I'll just,

954
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,071
I'll,

955
00:27:28,071 --> 00:27:28,311
I'll,

956
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:29,430
I'll walk you through shit,

957
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,050
I'll tell you what to what to not do,

958
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:31,884
where to put yourself,

959
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,070
but this can't ever let that happen ever.

960
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,180
Even if you were going to lose,

961
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,991
even if you're,

962
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:37,351
you're,

963
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:38,550
you're going to get tapped out.

964
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,230
Don't ever let yourself freak.

965
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,273
He can't freak.

966
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,930
And in a real emergency,

967
00:27:42,931 --> 00:27:45,630
let's say some type of
straight over vacation where,

968
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:49,950
I mean maybe there's a lot more on the
line than a trophy or a medal or you

969
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:50,340
know,

970
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,380
like your life ego in the class.

971
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:52,550
Yeah.

972
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,430
Like your life.

973
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,420
Um,

974
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:54,751
yeah,

975
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:56,490
no one to breathe and keep calm.

976
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:57,630
It's really,

977
00:27:57,631 --> 00:27:58,051
really,

978
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:58,801
really important.

979
00:27:58,801 --> 00:27:59,431
Very important.

980
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:00,900
Keep your mind clear,

981
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,390
but it takes a lot of practice
and you have to do it.

982
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,210
And there's a lot of really cool
breathing exercises that you can do.

983
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,280
Even just walking,

984
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,300
jogging,

985
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,720
you know,

986
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,520
even with your exercises and so forth,

987
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,380
everyone can lose anyone especially
that's learning and developing.

988
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:19,200
You can lose and you're
probably going to lose,

989
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,060
whether it's in sparring or whether it's
in competition when you come up against

990
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:24,900
someone who's better than you.

991
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:30,110
But there's a big difference between
losing and losing composure and breaking.

992
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,510
You know that that term breaking
when you feel a guy give up.

993
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,860
We've all seen it.

994
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,370
We've seen it in fights and
some guys just don't break.

995
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,110
Like here's a brief example.

996
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,850
Jon Jones doesn't break.

997
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,990
He just doesn't break.

998
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:43,681
You know,

999
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,090
he might take breathers.

1000
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,661
He might,

1001
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:46,494
but he is,

1002
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,333
he is.

1003
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,690
He in his mind,

1004
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,190
he's the greatest of all time.

1005
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,720
He's going to figure out how to beat you.

1006
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:53,190
It's a foregone conclusion.

1007
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,300
He's not going to tap.

1008
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,950
Like when he fought Vitor Belfort,

1009
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:59,730
Vitor Belfort caught him in a beautiful
arm bar from the guard and had his arm

1010
00:28:59,731 --> 00:29:02,640
completely hyperextended ruined his arm.

1011
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:03,430
I mean his arm,

1012
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:06,060
John's arm was fucked up
for like months afterwards.

1013
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,020
He had to take a Gig on the ultimate
fighter and coach for a long time because

1014
00:29:10,021 --> 00:29:11,520
he wasn't able to train and he wasn't,

1015
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:14,970
he was not going to be able to fight
for at least like six months to let that

1016
00:29:14,971 --> 00:29:15,780
arm heal.

1017
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,530
But it didn't matter.

1018
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:16,881
He was,

1019
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:20,130
he was not going to tap like he was gonna
get his arm broken and he was going to

1020
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:20,461
still,

1021
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:22,440
when he was gonna find a way to win,

1022
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:23,460
he is not breaking.

1023
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,600
And then there's other guys,

1024
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,730
the first moment where things go wrong,

1025
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:27,810
you see this look in their eye,

1026
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:28,141
they were like,

1027
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:28,801
oh shit,

1028
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:29,730
it's going wrong.

1029
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,940
They lose composure and like these,

1030
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,540
these doors that you
go into with your mind,

1031
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,090
you get real comfortable
entering these doors.

1032
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:40,830
You get real comfortable entering these,

1033
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,340
these areas of the mind.

1034
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,770
And this can apply to
all aspects of your life,

1035
00:29:44,771 --> 00:29:45,310
I think.

1036
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:45,520
Well,

1037
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,050
like Jack Hurray got,

1038
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,411
you know,

1039
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,140
when he fought a Roger
that perfect example,

1040
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:50,980
perfect example.

1041
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,680
Did he wanted the win took the,

1042
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,810
the damage to the elbow fought
one arm just to eke out the,

1043
00:29:57,811 --> 00:29:59,890
the victory there was now.

1044
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:02,170
But I think for folks who don't
know what we're talking about,

1045
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,161
Hodrick Gracie,

1046
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:05,890
one of the very best black belts
in the world and shock array,

1047
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:07,270
one of the very best
black belts in the world.

1048
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,590
Was it in the Monday owls?

1049
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,420
I think it was the open finals.

1050
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:10,751
Yeah.

1051
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:15,751
It was a huge two world championship
and hydro broke Jocker Rey's arm and Jah

1052
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,600
courageous tuck that sucker
in his belt and kept going.

1053
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,493
Kept going,

1054
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,461
I don't know,

1055
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:22,510
30 or 40 seconds.

1056
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:27,160
So he just basically played outside
edge of the mat because he had points.

1057
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:27,460
Yeah,

1058
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,130
he led them t he let them break
his arm instead of table is crazy.

1059
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,200
Now for your,

1060
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,190
for your listeners out there though,

1061
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:34,780
don't do that.

1062
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,613
Don't do that.

1063
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:40,210
We're talking about hardcore professional
athletes that make their living

1064
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,480
fighting world championships in the lime,

1065
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,613
you know,

1066
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,690
thousands of dollars in the line.

1067
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:47,830
But in class.

1068
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,311
Yeah.

1069
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:48,971
Tom,

1070
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:50,140
one of those guys that like,

1071
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:50,381
Hey,

1072
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:51,280
if you catch me,

1073
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,480
you track me.

1074
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,081
I,

1075
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:53,560
you know,

1076
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,170
fighting out of the
arm walk or a triangle.

1077
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,311
Look,

1078
00:30:57,311 --> 00:30:58,540
the mistake's already been made.

1079
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,280
You got me in the trap.

1080
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,810
I made a mistake.

1081
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,190
I acknowledge it,

1082
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:03,700
you know,

1083
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,260
I mean a fight a little bit.

1084
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:06,011
But you know,

1085
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:06,850
as soon as I feel like,

1086
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,780
ah Nah,

1087
00:31:07,781 --> 00:31:09,260
this is just tap,

1088
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,990
it's just so good about it.

1089
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:12,100
So important to tap.

1090
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,160
The biggest mistakes I've ever
made in training is not tapping,

1091
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,500
especially when you're over 45
and these guys that are want to,

1092
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,421
and that,

1093
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:20,740
that brings up another subject.

1094
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,070
Uh,

1095
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,580
I've been really doing a lot of
work with Jujitsu for a lifetime.

1096
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,340
You know,

1097
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:25,531
I,

1098
00:31:25,531 --> 00:31:25,711
I've,

1099
00:31:25,711 --> 00:31:27,550
I quit the grandsons of Elliot.

1100
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:28,361
Gracie been saying,

1101
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:28,810
you know,

1102
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,900
let's get that video because you have
a beautiful video that you sent me and

1103
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:33,600
let's show what happened to Jack Arrays.

1104
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,181
Obo Too,

1105
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:34,631
by the way,

1106
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:34,900
Jack,

1107
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,230
he had surgery on his elbow and
they pulled these chunks of,

1108
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:38,650
of,

1109
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,640
of bone that were broken off
and cartilage inside his elbow.

1110
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,080
I never heard about the aftermath.

1111
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,250
I knew it was pretty messed up,

1112
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:49,700
but I never heard exactly what
he had to do to repair that.

1113
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:50,010
He did.

1114
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:50,980
It was bad.

1115
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:51,430
Yeah,

1116
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,140
he had it recently repaired,

1117
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,550
had to repaired back then.

1118
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:55,750
But the damage,

1119
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:59,560
all the cartilage and all the stuff
that's broken off inside of his elbow was

1120
00:31:59,561 --> 00:32:01,210
just swimming around in his elbow,

1121
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,830
messing with his at some serious,

1122
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:03,521
oh,

1123
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:04,360
it's so painful.

1124
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:04,541
You know,

1125
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:07,600
you can't extend your arm all the
way while your body builds up,

1126
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,051
you know,

1127
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:12,070
bone and calcification around that
injury and you get those osteophytes and

1128
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,233
before you know it,

1129
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,700
you pretty much lose
range of motion and your,

1130
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,563
your joints,

1131
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,710
the surgery,

1132
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,040
uh,

1133
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,521
images,

1134
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:22,390
he put a online and it was
just like so disgusting.

1135
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,291
Bad News,

1136
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,124
man.

1137
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,170
I do love to avoid surgery.

1138
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,230
Yeah.

1139
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:27,910
Yeah.

1140
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,240
He,

1141
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,000
it was a five hour surgery
just to clean out his elbow.

1142
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,860
Look at this and it's a good
chance a man that was really nasty,

1143
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,031
but you know,

1144
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:39,980
even after the surgery there's a good
chance that never going to be the savvy

1145
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,430
guy.

1146
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,420
Very good chance.

1147
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,260
Very good chance.

1148
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:42,501
I mean,

1149
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:47,030
they're finding out ways now with
stem cells to regenerate cartilage,

1150
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,380
like for the first time ever,

1151
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,970
football players are doing it.

1152
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,780
They're using it on an older folk that
have add bone to bone arthritis for

1153
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:54,240
years.

1154
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,670
It's pretty amazing,

1155
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:56,180
isn't it?

1156
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,560
What?

1157
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,410
We're going to break time.

1158
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,300
We're in a great time.

1159
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,020
If we could just live long enough,

1160
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:00,680
Joe.

1161
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,513
Yeah,

1162
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,790
just get me placing parts for
everything grown from our own bodies,

1163
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:05,120
right?

1164
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,570
Yeah.

1165
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,180
Well it's very possible that
that is going to happen,

1166
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:11,000
but also very possible that they're just
going to be able to regenerate tissue,

1167
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,860
that all your injured tissue,

1168
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,430
all your damaged area,

1169
00:33:14,431 --> 00:33:15,980
so just going to be
able to regenerate them.

1170
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,270
It's going to be like star Trek,

1171
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:17,511
right?

1172
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:21,050
Where they used to take that little thing
and then go over your body and you're

1173
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:21,884
healed now.

1174
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:22,311
Well,

1175
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:23,660
there's a guy in Germany,

1176
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,321
a doctor,

1177
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:25,160
Peter Weller,

1178
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:29,720
who is the same guy who created that
Regena keen process that all the pro

1179
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:30,350
athletes,

1180
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,220
they were flying over to Germany for
doing to do it and now they go to a,

1181
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,640
there's a company called lifespan medicine
that does it in Santa Monica and they

1182
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:38,920
do in Dallas and I,

1183
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,060
I believe they're opening
up other offices as well.

1184
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,920
They take your blood out,

1185
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,540
they spin it in a centrifuge and the
heat it up and the reaction to the heat

1186
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,250
makes your blood produce this
really intense anti inflammatory.

1187
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,800
And I've had it done a lot.

1188
00:33:52,801 --> 00:33:54,890
A lot of people have had
really chronic injuries,

1189
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,990
had it done and it's works miracles.

1190
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:57,381
Well,

1191
00:33:57,381 --> 00:34:01,700
he's developed this full body MRI machine,

1192
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,940
which literally just get some map
of everything going on in your body.

1193
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,230
And once he went and did it,

1194
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,020
he developed this and found
out he had colon cancer.

1195
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:12,980
Well,

1196
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,250
yeah,

1197
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,150
he had no idea.

1198
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,440
A particularly tough,

1199
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,860
aggressive type of colon cancer
and caught it right away.

1200
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:19,160
Hmm.

1201
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,420
Early on went into surgery.

1202
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,200
No it's fine.

1203
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,720
But I mean it's like this
is how amazing it is.

1204
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:27,500
It's so amazing that it actually worked
and benefited the guy who created it.

1205
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:28,941
It's amazing.

1206
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:33,770
Amazing Stash to be the beneficiary of
your own inventions and discoveries,

1207
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:34,250
ma'am.

1208
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:34,641
Well it's,

1209
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:38,570
it's also a reward for
being on the cutting edge of
healing and science for this

1210
00:34:38,571 --> 00:34:40,760
guy and the medical science.

1211
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:41,091
But let's,

1212
00:34:41,091 --> 00:34:44,750
let's play this a video that you have
that you sent us cause it's really cool.

1213
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,831
I really a,

1214
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:48,230
I liked what you do and it's really
exciting to see and I want to talk to you

1215
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:48,501
about it.

1216
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:49,520
So we'll play that real quick.

1217
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:56,290
I've spent almost a lifetime and take
that when you aren't starting as a young

1218
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:57,820
wrestler and once it was 10 years old,

1219
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,410
always is in love with the
whole concept of mescaline.

1220
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,640
You laugh when you're on the ground.

1221
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:03,860
Uh,

1222
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,550
who's just one of the few things I
was good at right from the beginning.

1223
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,480
Jujitsu and surfing and
tropical El Salvador.

1224
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,433
I love it.

1225
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,993
Okay.

1226
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,630
So for folks who will just
listening and not watching,

1227
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:24,631
it's just Steve demonstrating a bunch
of different Jujitsu techniques and uh,

1228
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,110
now mobility training,

1229
00:35:26,111 --> 00:35:26,791
which is a,

1230
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,670
a big part of what you do to
keep healthy and keep your,

1231
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,061
your,

1232
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:34,000
your joints healthy and
protect yourself from injuries.

1233
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:34,834
Right?

1234
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,853
Absolutely.

1235
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,050
I mean,

1236
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,040
if you think about it,

1237
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,050
it's probably the most fun I
got a two guys can have without,

1238
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:42,781
without a woman,

1239
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:43,614
man.

1240
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,190
I mean,

1241
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,490
yeah.

1242
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,670
It's like rolling with your,

1243
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,170
you know,

1244
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,990
like wrestling on their living room
for in your pajamas with your brother,

1245
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:49,260
right?

1246
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,000
It's like,

1247
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,310
yeah.

1248
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,270
Incredibly fun.

1249
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,070
Great mental stimulation.

1250
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,090
It's a fun game.

1251
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,590
Very Fun.

1252
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,090
As long as you can get over
the tapping part w well,

1253
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,060
what we were talking about earlier,

1254
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,680
just it's like no one gets angry when
someone shoots a ball in on them.

1255
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,980
When you play basketball
and there's the dates there,

1256
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:07,650
let's pull those dates back so
he could see what the dates are.

1257
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:11,540
Tell everybody where they are
is in the 22nd and March 28,

1258
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,243
no,

1259
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,710
go ahead.

1260
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,070
I'm sorry.

1261
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,470
It says 28th of November
to the 5th of December,

1262
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,860
and then the 5th of December to the 12th
of December in 2015 so this is a start,

1263
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:28,590
a new tradition that says this is a new
thing that you're starting to do and uh,

1264
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,230
what a great vacation.

1265
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:30,531
You know,

1266
00:36:30,531 --> 00:36:31,460
have some fun.

1267
00:36:31,461 --> 00:36:32,540
Go to El Salvador,

1268
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:33,800
do some surfing.

1269
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,630
You guys have surf lessons,

1270
00:36:35,631 --> 00:36:37,190
you're going to teach Jujitsu.

1271
00:36:37,191 --> 00:36:42,191
Teach different ways of increasing
your joint flexibility and preventing

1272
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,530
injuries and just haven't got just
how to stay with it for a lifetime.

1273
00:36:47,531 --> 00:36:51,590
And like for guys that want to just
stick with what they love doing.

1274
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,480
You wrote an article about it recently?

1275
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:53,721
Well,

1276
00:36:53,721 --> 00:36:53,931
yeah.

1277
00:36:53,931 --> 00:36:55,340
I mean like most guys,

1278
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,590
by the time they hit 40 or they're
not going to be doing that anymore,

1279
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,350
they're going to have to quit
because they're going about it wrong.

1280
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,210
And I was on that path myself.

1281
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,260
I mean,

1282
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,750
when I was in my mid forties I'd
be getting up in the morning.

1283
00:37:05,751 --> 00:37:06,140
It was like,

1284
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,951
oh my God,

1285
00:37:06,951 --> 00:37:09,620
I can barely turn around to
back my car out of the garage.

1286
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,580
And I'm thinking,

1287
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,413
Geez,

1288
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,140
what's what is going to be like in 10
years from now if I'm just in my mid

1289
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:18,590
forties already suffering this pain
and stiffness and inflammation.

1290
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:22,370
So I started really investigating
the different exercises,

1291
00:37:22,371 --> 00:37:22,851
systems,

1292
00:37:22,851 --> 00:37:24,020
mobility systems.

1293
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,490
Of course I've always
been interested in died,

1294
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:26,990
you know,

1295
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,070
experimenting and so forth.

1296
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,240
And uh,

1297
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,660
you know,

1298
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,110
I've been doing this for a long time
and I discovered a lot of really good

1299
00:37:33,111 --> 00:37:33,400
things.

1300
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,090
I like to share with people so that you
can continue to do what you love so we

1301
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:40,940
can all be like master
Elliot Gracie and you know,

1302
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:42,230
95 years old.

1303
00:37:42,231 --> 00:37:43,064
I mean,

1304
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,160
getting on the Mat and
still having fun with it.

1305
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,400
You know,

1306
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:46,671
he was,

1307
00:37:46,671 --> 00:37:48,170
he was fanatical about his diet.

1308
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,790
He was fanatical about his died.

1309
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,301
But you know,

1310
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,650
as you get older you have to be,

1311
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,520
you got to,

1312
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,520
you got to be more and more fanatical as
the old aging process starts to set in.

1313
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,181
When I was young,

1314
00:37:59,181 --> 00:38:01,880
I think I was just less
aware of what was going on.

1315
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:03,410
When I ate bad food.

1316
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,550
I think it was just less aware.

1317
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:05,181
Like I was like,

1318
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:05,331
oh,

1319
00:38:05,331 --> 00:38:05,931
this tastes good.

1320
00:38:05,931 --> 00:38:06,910
What a great cheeseburger,

1321
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,763
tastes awesome.

1322
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,840
But I wasn't really,

1323
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:12,140
I wasn't as conscious
about the actual effects.

1324
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,250
Whereas now I'm pretty aware of
what kind of state my body's in.

1325
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:18,890
Like very frustrating for me if I'm,

1326
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,320
if my mind is an adult place,

1327
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:24,980
like especially if I have to do
interviews early in the morning and I just

1328
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:28,490
haven't quite woken up yet and I'm having
conversations in the words just aren't

1329
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,840
coming out that good.

1330
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,990
They're just clumsy and it's frustrating.

1331
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,871
So I'm,

1332
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:38,871
I'm pretty aware of like when I'm at my
optimum state and I really notice now if

1333
00:38:40,781 --> 00:38:41,740
I eat crappy food,

1334
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,160
I really notice if I,

1335
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:47,470
if I have like something that's like
got a lot of bread in it or something

1336
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:52,450
that's just an unhealthy
deep fried nonsense,

1337
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,290
it just,

1338
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:53,531
well,

1339
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:56,020
it's two guys that do a
lot of traveling and a,

1340
00:38:56,021 --> 00:38:56,410
you're,

1341
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:56,651
you know,

1342
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:59,880
you're doing shows all over
the place besides UFC is,

1343
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,493
uh,

1344
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,940
sometimes it is pretty hard,

1345
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:04,660
you know,

1346
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,350
to find good,

1347
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,183
good stuff.

1348
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:06,671
But,

1349
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:06,791
uh,

1350
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:06,981
what,

1351
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:07,270
uh,

1352
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,770
I always pack my own stuff.

1353
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,240
I always have like a,

1354
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,680
I call it my Hobo bag.

1355
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,660
It's a bag full of stuff.

1356
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:14,111
I go from,

1357
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:14,470
you know,

1358
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,270
a fairies health food stores or whatever,

1359
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:16,840
you know,

1360
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,070
I showed up on,

1361
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,670
you know,

1362
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,030
good,

1363
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,560
really good quality stuff.

1364
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,960
Like what are you packing
the Hobo bag of raw almonds.

1365
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:23,711
I mean,

1366
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:24,650
there's so many Kelly Oh,

1367
00:39:24,651 --> 00:39:25,540
places round now,

1368
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:25,871
you know,

1369
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:26,910
I'm not like a,

1370
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,780
a total fanatic about Paleo,

1371
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:31,030
but they do have some pretty
damn good healthy stuff,

1372
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:31,571
you know,

1373
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:33,420
different bars and,

1374
00:39:33,421 --> 00:39:33,761
and,

1375
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:34,061
and,

1376
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:38,980
and different concoctions that
are already sealed pouches or,

1377
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:39,710
you know,

1378
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,050
different things like that.

1379
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,940
I'll get a whole bunch
of things like that.

1380
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:43,370
Uh,

1381
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,740
I love Carob pods.

1382
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,600
Carob is just like fantastic.

1383
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:50,110
It's like raw carrot
right off the tree and,

1384
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:50,670
um,

1385
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,010
uh,

1386
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:51,843
fresh fruit.

1387
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:52,320
What is the,

1388
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,220
what is a raw carrot bar look like?

1389
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,381
Ah,

1390
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:55,121
it's not a bar.

1391
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:55,780
It's like a,

1392
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,471
it looks like,

1393
00:39:56,471 --> 00:39:57,304
uh,

1394
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:57,910
oh,

1395
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:58,760
what do they call them via,

1396
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,380
say,

1397
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,820
Shia pods or whatever that you see in
the ground sometimes it looks like that.

1398
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,050
Yeah.

1399
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:04,570
Yeah.

1400
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,350
But it's sweet.

1401
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:09,670
You just chew it and spit the seeds
and it's absolutely delicious.

1402
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,570
Good fiber.

1403
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,470
Uh,

1404
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:15,940
it's known as a blood sugar
stabilizer so that you eat this thing,

1405
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:16,810
man.

1406
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,430
You're not hungry for hours.

1407
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:19,510
So when you're on the road,

1408
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:21,970
it's just a good way
to keep yourself from,

1409
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,170
from getting too hungry.

1410
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,550
I don't think I've ever seen it before.

1411
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,653
Um,

1412
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,930
they're very popular.

1413
00:40:26,931 --> 00:40:27,430
It isn't there.

1414
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:27,850
Let's Australia.

1415
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:28,910
I used to get them in a,

1416
00:40:28,911 --> 00:40:29,201
yeah,

1417
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:30,034
that's it.

1418
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:30,780
Wow.

1419
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,200
And very popular in this delicious.

1420
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,070
Yeah.

1421
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:33,401
But,

1422
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:33,611
uh,

1423
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:34,150
when,

1424
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,600
uh,

1425
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,351
when I was living,

1426
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:35,740
um,

1427
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,573
and uh,

1428
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,600
uh,

1429
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,590
Redondo beach area,

1430
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:39,310
uh,

1431
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,770
my girlfriend used to go to
this place called rawsome.

1432
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:44,290
It was like a raw foods place
and they would sell them.

1433
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,261
But my guide,

1434
00:40:45,261 --> 00:40:47,470
they were like a fucking
arm and a leg man.

1435
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,221
These things where like,

1436
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:49,690
so crazy expensive.

1437
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,410
And one day I was in a Marin County,

1438
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,813
um,

1439
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,470
can't remember the little town.

1440
00:40:56,471 --> 00:40:57,304
But anyway,

1441
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,040
this is what backward
in my camper van days.

1442
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,970
I've got to get out and go to this
little coffee shop to get a paper or

1443
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:04,690
whatever.

1444
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,190
And I'm seeing these things in the ground.

1445
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:11,110
And I look up and there's a tree and it
was like hundreds of them just laying

1446
00:41:11,111 --> 00:41:11,291
there,

1447
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:12,124
man.

1448
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,600
I got some plastic baggies,

1449
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,340
you know,

1450
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:15,850
and just,

1451
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,140
you were sure that it was that.

1452
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:17,470
Oh,

1453
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,303
I tasted it.

1454
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:18,970
Oh Wow.

1455
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:19,540
It was like,

1456
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,171
Holy Shit,

1457
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:20,770
this is,

1458
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,810
this is a carrot,

1459
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,520
but it's a carob tree growing right here.

1460
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,890
Pull the [inaudible] image rather,

1461
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:29,170
and Marina County carob tree look like.

1462
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,550
I don't think I've ever,

1463
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,960
I really don't think I've ever seen that.

1464
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,160
Like if I looked at that,

1465
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,240
like that one looks
like a bundle of snakes,

1466
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:36,470
that third picture from the top,

1467
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,330
but it was right there on the right.

1468
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:39,080
It's,

1469
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,501
it's,

1470
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:40,334
uh,

1471
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,080
I,

1472
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,910
I was just utterly shocked because,

1473
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,221
you know,

1474
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:46,670
I had been paying a lot of money for
these damn things and there they were just

1475
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,000
like,

1476
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,760
man,

1477
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,840
I had no idea that they
even grew in California.

1478
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,540
How long does it last once
you get it from the tree?

1479
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:54,291
Does it go bad?

1480
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:54,800
And Ron,

1481
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,060
no,

1482
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,201
no,

1483
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:55,360
no,

1484
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,300
they're like dried.

1485
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:56,750
I mean,

1486
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,680
is there like a dried pod that you
could just keep for a long time?

1487
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,550
Probably years.

1488
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:01,821
Maybe.

1489
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:02,210
I don't know.

1490
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:02,930
Wow.

1491
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,130
I mean they're really tasty.

1492
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,810
It's really nice little sweet.

1493
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:06,770
You know what it's like.

1494
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:07,220
Um,

1495
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:07,730
you know,

1496
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:08,391
white sugar,

1497
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:11,990
white granulated sugar is probably
one of the worst things you can eat.

1498
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,590
Toxic.

1499
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:12,810
Yeah.

1500
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:13,520
Toxic,

1501
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,060
right.

1502
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,160
But sugar cane actually,

1503
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:16,520
you know,

1504
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,670
like from the cane field actually
has a lot of health benefit.

1505
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:20,630
It doesn't really,

1506
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,110
yeah.

1507
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,491
It's,

1508
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:22,131
it's sweet.

1509
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:22,964
It has fiber,

1510
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,200
it has a lot of nutrients,

1511
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,490
minerals and so forth.

1512
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,440
I mean obviously,

1513
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,011
you know,

1514
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:30,530
you don't eat a lot of it
cause it's powerful stuff.

1515
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:30,771
You know,

1516
00:42:30,771 --> 00:42:33,620
it's like one of those
very powerful foods.

1517
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,780
But the carob pods,

1518
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:37,010
it kind of like the same thing.

1519
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:39,950
If you do have a bit of a
sweet tooth or you know,

1520
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:40,560
whatever,

1521
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:40,850
uh,

1522
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,430
it's a fantastic way to,

1523
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,560
to uh,

1524
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,950
sate your sweet tooth and wow.

1525
00:42:45,951 --> 00:42:47,690
The fiber is amazing really.

1526
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,370
I really was not aware at all.

1527
00:42:49,371 --> 00:42:52,100
I always thought of Carob is
like something that you yeah,

1528
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:53,720
like the process stuff like chocolate.

1529
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:54,643
Yeah.

1530
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,090
It's about as bad as chocolate.

1531
00:42:56,091 --> 00:42:57,430
The way they process isn't really.

1532
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,080
Yeah.

1533
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,500
Well,

1534
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:58,881
I mean,

1535
00:42:58,881 --> 00:43:02,110
maybe a little less harsh on your
system because a lot of people have a

1536
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,440
chocolate sensitivities.

1537
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:03,900
You know,

1538
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,830
you always hear about gluten or dairy,

1539
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:07,860
but man,

1540
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,330
a lot of people have a lot
of sensitivity to chocolate.

1541
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,490
It's a lot of,

1542
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,470
a lot of different things out there that
had been overeating for years and years

1543
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:17,810
and years that can give
you food sensitivities.

1544
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:18,111
Well,

1545
00:43:18,111 --> 00:43:19,190
some chocolate's really good,

1546
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:19,371
right?

1547
00:43:19,371 --> 00:43:21,280
Like raw chocolate is very high and,

1548
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:24,020
but some people are very sensitive to the,

1549
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:24,140
uh,

1550
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:24,973
acids.

1551
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,000
Really fourth and chocolate.

1552
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,310
And so there's this Caribbean then is,

1553
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,351
how do you say it?

1554
00:43:29,351 --> 00:43:29,920
Cut Cow,

1555
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,410
cow,

1556
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:30,670
cow,

1557
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:31,503
cow.

1558
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,373
The raw chocolates,

1559
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,940
the raw chocolate and that
stuff is really good for you,

1560
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:35,171
right?

1561
00:43:35,171 --> 00:43:35,930
Yeah,

1562
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:36,560
it can be,

1563
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,240
can be for some people it's like,

1564
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:41,180
it's like it's powerful stuff
and if you overeat anything,

1565
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:43,130
you're going to develop a po potential,

1566
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,143
uh,

1567
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:44,540
uh,

1568
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,373
sensitivity.

1569
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:45,980
Yeah.

1570
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:46,440
Um,

1571
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,273
as I think gluten,

1572
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,270
gluten in itself is not all that bad.

1573
00:43:50,271 --> 00:43:50,930
Right.

1574
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:53,720
But Americans had been
just eating it like crazy,

1575
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:54,290
you know,

1576
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,700
toast in the morning.

1577
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:56,361
Uh,

1578
00:43:56,361 --> 00:43:57,194
you know,

1579
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:57,610
we,

1580
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:57,830
yeah,

1581
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:00,680
it was cereal and then sandwich for lunch,

1582
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:01,603
pasta for dinner,

1583
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,000
dinner rolls and it's just
like they're getting inundated.

1584
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:06,140
Well like God,

1585
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:11,230
you could probably develop
a food sensitivity to
anything if you probably you

1586
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:15,070
could get eggs or chicken sensitivity
or something if you just ate it,

1587
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,233
you know,

1588
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:16,700
three,

1589
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,020
three square meals a day.

1590
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:19,730
I'm pretty certain of that.

1591
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,760
I went for a while more than six months
where I just didn't touch any gluten.

1592
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:25,761
I said,

1593
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:26,600
let me see what happens.

1594
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,770
One thing I lost weight.

1595
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:31,040
I was pretty shocked at
like how easy it was.

1596
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,250
Like my body thinned out,

1597
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:33,410
lost body fat,

1598
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,470
my face got thinner.

1599
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:35,140
Um,

1600
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,170
I carry fat in my face.

1601
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,130
I'm like one of those dudes,

1602
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,233
I carry fat.

1603
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,073
If I get fat,

1604
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,750
love handles and I get it in my face.

1605
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,580
I don't get it in my arms.

1606
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:45,540
I don't get it in my legs,

1607
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:49,960
but I get it my like around my belly
and my sides and I get it at my face and

1608
00:44:49,961 --> 00:44:50,790
all that went wrong.

1609
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,800
My fish shrunk down and my son,

1610
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,161
I was like,

1611
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:53,341
wow,

1612
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:54,174
this is interesting.

1613
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,910
It is interesting how the
fat patterns just shrink up.

1614
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,790
There's three major fat distributions,

1615
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:00,150
right?

1616
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,860
You got your depo fat.

1617
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:06,000
That's like the love handles or with women
and sometimes it's the saddlebags and

1618
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:06,834
the side of the thigh.

1619
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:11,520
Sometimes you'll see a women and the
upper back or the tricep area with guys.

1620
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:13,120
That's usually the La yeah,

1621
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,930
or the belly or the love
handles for most guys,

1622
00:45:15,931 --> 00:45:16,710
you know,

1623
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,940
then you have internal fat.

1624
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:18,990
That's the dangerous stuff.

1625
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,760
They intra abdominal fat,

1626
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:21,570
that gut fat,

1627
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:22,000
that's what,

1628
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,040
that's what can kill you.

1629
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:23,980
Uh,

1630
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,590
then you have subcutaneous fat.

1631
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,200
It's like the smooth
fat underneath the skin,

1632
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,010
like a,

1633
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,090
like an insulation layer.

1634
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:33,300
And then of course they've
identified that Brown fat also,

1635
00:45:33,301 --> 00:45:34,950
it's like a act of fat.

1636
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:36,840
It produces heat in the body.

1637
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:39,060
It's like part of the survival mechanism.

1638
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:43,560
Back when our ancestors had to tolerate
a lot of extremes in temperatures like

1639
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:44,603
cold,

1640
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,810
you have this brown fat,

1641
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,350
it's like an metabolically
active fat and uh,

1642
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:49,651
it's,

1643
00:45:49,651 --> 00:45:50,850
it's kids have it,

1644
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,090
but by the time you were like 12 and
almost disappears because you know,

1645
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:54,751
we have this,

1646
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:55,470
uh,

1647
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:55,980
uh,

1648
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,600
regulated temperatures all the time.

1649
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,730
People don't expose themselves to cold.

1650
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:02,670
They're always bundling up
and the homes are overheated.

1651
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:03,660
But,

1652
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,493
um,

1653
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:05,760
but a lot of people were saying,

1654
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:08,520
now you can actually get that
metabolically active fat.

1655
00:46:08,521 --> 00:46:09,690
The brown fat Sal's gone,

1656
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:14,990
which helps keep you ween and
helps burn the other yellow fat.

1657
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,630
So cold showers,

1658
00:46:18,631 --> 00:46:19,870
cold water treatments,

1659
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,780
exposing yourself to cold,

1660
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,980
a real good thing for develop that and uh,

1661
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:28,200
the brown fat and build
your immune system and you,

1662
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:32,660
you have a much better tolerance to
cold and much less likely to get a

1663
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:34,110
innervated and cold weather.

1664
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:37,500
So you don't have a tendency to come
down with colds or flu and stuff like

1665
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:38,640
really brown fat,

1666
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,270
Brown fat.

1667
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,440
I'd never heard of that before.

1668
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,570
And what is it created by?

1669
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:44,160
Like what it's in your,

1670
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:44,650
uh,

1671
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,590
some of it's in the peritoneal cavity,

1672
00:46:46,591 --> 00:46:48,240
some of it's a up in the neck,

1673
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,720
uh,

1674
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,553
area.

1675
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,453
Uh,

1676
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:51,261
and it's,

1677
00:46:51,261 --> 00:46:55,530
it's just something that nature
provided to help temperature regulation,

1678
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,060
helping tolerate cold.

1679
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,510
So it was that like more common with
Inuits and folks who live in real.

1680
00:47:00,511 --> 00:47:00,751
Yeah,

1681
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:01,320
for sure.

1682
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,910
They have well developed brown fat,

1683
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,360
but you and I could do it too if we just
expose yourself a little bit more to

1684
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:07,194
the cold.

1685
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:11,000
I have you done any cryotherapy if
you've done any of that and not as uh,

1686
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:12,060
as uh,

1687
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,620
like the way it's been used.

1688
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:14,550
How long are you in town for?

1689
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,540
Uh,

1690
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,260
let's see.

1691
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,810
What am I going down to San Diego?

1692
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,170
I'm the keynote speaker for that.

1693
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:20,790
A strength matters summit.

1694
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:25,590
That's a 20th through the
22nd march in San Diego.

1695
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:26,940
17th 16th,

1696
00:47:26,941 --> 00:47:27,491
16th.

1697
00:47:27,491 --> 00:47:29,070
And I gotta take you to this place in La.

1698
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,830
It's called Cryo healthcare.

1699
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:31,721
I got to bring you down.

1700
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:32,500
Love Coal.

1701
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,070
This,

1702
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:33,940
this is insane.

1703
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,590
250 degrees below zero.

1704
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,210
You go into like a meat locker.

1705
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:37,571
I mean,

1706
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:37,910
it is,

1707
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:38,591
is crazy.

1708
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:40,120
You put on a surgical mask,

1709
00:47:40,121 --> 00:47:41,050
you put on ear muffs,

1710
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:46,350
you wear socks that go up to your like
knee high socks and like those rubber

1711
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,120
crocs cause you don't want
to stand on the floor.

1712
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:49,660
Yeah.

1713
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,480
And you were also wearing gloves anywhere.

1714
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:52,150
Underwear,

1715
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,230
very important ladies and gentlemen.

1716
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,520
And you don't want to have
any moisture in your body.

1717
00:47:55,521 --> 00:47:55,680
You know,

1718
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,390
ever want to go there.

1719
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:57,223
Sweaty.

1720
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:58,240
Yeah.

1721
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,410
You go there for three minutes,

1722
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:04,860
three minutes at 250 degrees
below zero and it is cold as fuck.

1723
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:09,670
And all I do is I just concentrate on
staying calm and breathing and I breathed

1724
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:11,530
and I count and that's what I do.

1725
00:48:11,531 --> 00:48:12,364
I go one,

1726
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,390
two,

1727
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:17,740
three and I try to count slower than a
minute so that when they give you a timer

1728
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,570
you have one minute remaining.

1729
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,250
So when I count that minute down,

1730
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,080
I always want to make
sure that I'm not one,

1731
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:23,321
two,

1732
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:23,561
three,

1733
00:48:23,561 --> 00:48:24,394
four bucks.

1734
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:28,030
I'm counting slower than
the actual build up.

1735
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:30,610
Do you like maybe start at 30
seconds and build up each time?

1736
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:32,050
Or I did.

1737
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:33,521
The first time they did it,

1738
00:48:33,521 --> 00:48:34,840
they put me in for two minutes and I said,

1739
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:35,711
and they'd go,

1740
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:36,640
well the first time,

1741
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:37,480
do you want to try it?

1742
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:37,991
You know,

1743
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:39,550
don't go into long,

1744
00:48:39,551 --> 00:48:39,821
blah blah,

1745
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:39,941
blah,

1746
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:40,061
blah,

1747
00:48:40,061 --> 00:48:40,570
blah.

1748
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:40,931
And I go,

1749
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:41,350
okay,

1750
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:41,521
how,

1751
00:48:41,521 --> 00:48:42,910
what's the longest I could do it?

1752
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,200
And they said three minutes.

1753
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:44,651
So I said,

1754
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:44,811
all right,

1755
00:48:44,811 --> 00:48:45,670
well I'll try your two minutes.

1756
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:46,361
I tried two minutes,

1757
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:46,571
I think,

1758
00:48:46,571 --> 00:48:47,800
I think it will last another minute.

1759
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:48,221
I go,

1760
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:49,054
let's try another minute.

1761
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:52,570
So then I went in again and I did three
minutes and now what I do is I do three

1762
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:53,290
minutes,

1763
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:54,100
I take,

1764
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:54,933
um,

1765
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:57,010
maybe five,

1766
00:48:57,011 --> 00:49:00,520
six minutes off and I get on an elliptical
machine and warm up and then I'll go

1767
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:01,930
back in for another three minutes.

1768
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,970
And it's amazing to me.

1769
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:05,260
For years I did the,

1770
00:49:05,261 --> 00:49:05,830
uh,

1771
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:07,240
the dousing.

1772
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,630
It's a nice bath or bucket bit,

1773
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,210
ah,

1774
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,050
ice bucket challenge.

1775
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,190
Well,

1776
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:15,940
it's funny cause I had been doing this
years and years before when I lived in

1777
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:16,480
Philly.

1778
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,290
I had a backyard that was pretty much
secluded with a big wall so I could

1779
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,124
basically,

1780
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:21,461
you know,

1781
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:24,430
strip down naked in my backyard
and my neighbors couldn't see me.

1782
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,020
And in the back corner I had this big
Spec it and I had a five gallon bucket and

1783
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:34,021
the all year long I would go and very
slowly pour a five gallon bucket for

1784
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,810
starting with the admin up over
the head and down the back.

1785
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,520
And the Russians that had taught me
this said that it creates like this

1786
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:47,080
artificial flash fever that is not
quite the same thing with the shower,

1787
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:50,920
which is more prolonged because
you're doubting yourself with a sudden

1788
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,813
immersion.

1789
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,640
It's kind of like plunging
into like a cold lake.

1790
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,953
Uh,

1791
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,680
it's supposedly burns up any
bacteria or germs or whatever,

1792
00:49:59,681 --> 00:50:00,514
and your body.

1793
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:04,140
All I know is that for the
years I did it in Philadelphia,

1794
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,870
15 years when I had,

1795
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,000
when I was a householder,

1796
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,920
I didn't get a cold.

1797
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:09,730
Really.

1798
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:10,860
I did not get a cold.

1799
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,760
People around me would have flu,

1800
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:13,960
they'd be sick.

1801
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:15,850
And I was,

1802
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,060
my immune system was like amazing.

1803
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:19,841
Well,

1804
00:50:19,841 --> 00:50:22,870
the benefits of this cryo therapy as a,

1805
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,280
it's been explained to me.

1806
00:50:24,281 --> 00:50:27,500
And if you go to Cryo health care.com,

1807
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:28,400
I think it is,

1808
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,870
I forget the website,

1809
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:32,300
but the name of the place
in La is cryo healthcare.

1810
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,720
There's a bunch of different
styles of these cryo machines.

1811
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,730
One of them is from the neck down.

1812
00:50:37,731 --> 00:50:41,480
You stand in and your head is outside and
you don't have to put anything on your

1813
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:41,960
face.

1814
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,610
I don't find that one to be as effective.

1815
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,250
It's good.

1816
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,320
Certainly better than nothing.

1817
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:45,980
Um,

1818
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,050
but the one we stepped into,

1819
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:47,893
the meat locker,

1820
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:48,831
God,

1821
00:50:48,831 --> 00:50:49,680
that's a motherfucker.

1822
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,800
They're going to have one of those
down the street and Woodland Hills,

1823
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:52,650
um,

1824
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:53,483
down the road a bit.

1825
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:57,470
They're going to be putting out one
of those within the next month or so.

1826
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:59,780
But that would certainly
stimulate brown fat.

1827
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:00,160
Oh,

1828
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,940
with that thing.

1829
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:01,820
So this is,

1830
00:51:01,821 --> 00:51:02,301
this is the,

1831
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:04,100
see the meat locker one
is the one on the left.

1832
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:04,280
See,

1833
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,270
they have that one.

1834
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,790
That one's fairly common
kind of nationwide.

1835
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,653
That one,

1836
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,560
the one that you see on the left,

1837
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:10,310
the meat locker.

1838
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,700
That's the mother fuck that way,

1839
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:12,080
man.

1840
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,530
Whew.

1841
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,260
I'm going to take you there.

1842
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,870
I say claustrophobic and that way,

1843
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:15,200
right?

1844
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:15,351
No,

1845
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:16,340
it's not claustrophobic.

1846
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,440
You developed the door easy.

1847
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:18,770
Yeah.

1848
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:19,940
The little one just goes to like,

1849
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:21,150
I don't know man.

1850
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:22,310
The little one's easy.

1851
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,480
The little one's so easy.

1852
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:23,931
It's not,

1853
00:51:23,931 --> 00:51:25,490
it's just not the little ones hard.

1854
00:51:25,491 --> 00:51:26,660
If you've never done it before,

1855
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:27,081
you go,

1856
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:27,914
oh Jesus.

1857
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:29,720
But if you've done it,

1858
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:30,410
um,

1859
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:30,711
the,

1860
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:32,270
the big one is like the little one.

1861
00:51:32,271 --> 00:51:33,110
That's that one right there.

1862
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:33,953
You just Kinda,

1863
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:34,910
you climb out of it,

1864
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:35,391
you're fine.

1865
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:35,991
But the uh,

1866
00:51:35,991 --> 00:51:38,180
the big one has this amazing effect.

1867
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:38,811
You get out of there,

1868
00:51:38,811 --> 00:51:40,940
you feel like you could
jump over buildings.

1869
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:41,691
He like,

1870
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:42,524
whoa.

1871
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,480
Once your body,

1872
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,900
like realizes that
you're not going to die,

1873
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,930
no one has dropped you in the top of
the moon and it's on a hundred really,

1874
00:51:50,931 --> 00:51:52,220
250 degrees below zero.

1875
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,520
That's literally the surface of
the moon is 250 degrees below zero.

1876
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:56,330
Yeah.

1877
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:57,163
In the dark.

1878
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:01,460
The moon varies from like 250 degrees
to 250 degrees below zero depending on

1879
00:52:01,461 --> 00:52:04,970
whether or not the sun is hitting you
or whether or not you're in the shade.

1880
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,700
Well that's like how all these
things where even even training,

1881
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,300
right?

1882
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:08,601
You know,

1883
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:09,350
your body,

1884
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:10,850
if training's done properly,

1885
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,460
your body perceives it as
a threat to its survival.

1886
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:19,070
You basically are tapping into your
survival mechanism with these things and

1887
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,450
your body in its wisdom will say,

1888
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:21,284
Hey,

1889
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,240
I'm not quite up to snuff here.

1890
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,660
I better adapt and get
stronger so I don't die.

1891
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:27,410
Yeah.

1892
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:27,741
And that,

1893
00:52:27,741 --> 00:52:29,530
that's training to weight training or,

1894
00:52:29,531 --> 00:52:30,364
or anything,

1895
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:30,801
you know,

1896
00:52:30,801 --> 00:52:30,971
you,

1897
00:52:30,971 --> 00:52:35,971
you have to make it a stimulating enough
and difficult enough to tap into that

1898
00:52:36,351 --> 00:52:39,500
survival mechanism so that if you're not,

1899
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:42,230
you're not getting the
benefit of the training.

1900
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:44,660
Or in this case they cry a therapist.

1901
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,690
So your body like an adaptation response.

1902
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:51,140
Well this is this new system that they're,

1903
00:52:51,141 --> 00:52:52,580
they've developed in Japan.

1904
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:53,750
It's called Kaatsu.

1905
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:54,830
And uh,

1906
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:57,560
I don't know the gentleman's
name of created it,

1907
00:52:57,561 --> 00:52:59,780
but I had a chance to try it
out this weekend in Austin.

1908
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:00,950
And what essentially is,

1909
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:01,784
is like these,

1910
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:06,680
they take these straps and they
constrict the outs like your,

1911
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:07,401
your Bicep,

1912
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:08,570
like right below the,

1913
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:08,661
uh,

1914
00:53:08,661 --> 00:53:09,494
the delts.

1915
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,190
And then you go through
like a 15 minute routine,

1916
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,860
like 15 minutes of you do curls,

1917
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,401
you start off,

1918
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,234
you do pushups,

1919
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,790
you do curls with a
kettle bell to failure.

1920
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:22,250
And all this is while your
blood flow is restricted.

1921
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:27,430
And then you do like a ropes and
you do sets of three for 15 minutes.

1922
00:53:27,631 --> 00:53:28,590
By the end of the 15 minutes,

1923
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,390
you're fucking arms are dead.

1924
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:30,780
I mean,

1925
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:30,930
yeah,

1926
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:34,710
cause you're restricting the blood flow
and then they release it and take it

1927
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,040
off.

1928
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:40,040
And apparently the response that your
body has to the fact that your blood flow

1929
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:40,980
is restricted,

1930
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,870
it triggers all sorts of,

1931
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:45,600
of responses as far as
your growth hormone,

1932
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:46,860
your testosterone,

1933
00:53:46,861 --> 00:53:47,311
all these different,

1934
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:47,481
you be,

1935
00:53:47,481 --> 00:53:51,750
your body starts trying to compensate
for the fact that it doesn't have enough

1936
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:52,584
blood flow.

1937
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:57,650
So it just over ramps everything up and
it's apparently fantastic for healing.

1938
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:00,450
It's fantastic for people
that have injuries.

1939
00:54:00,451 --> 00:54:05,451
Recovery time from injuries reduces
drastically like a Bodie Miller.

1940
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:05,851
The,

1941
00:54:05,851 --> 00:54:06,071
uh,

1942
00:54:06,071 --> 00:54:07,200
the Olympic skier.

1943
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:08,190
Um,

1944
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:08,821
he uh,

1945
00:54:08,821 --> 00:54:13,080
used it to get back in shape
from a surgery like much
quicker than he would have

1946
00:54:13,081 --> 00:54:13,914
without it.

1947
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:14,641
That's just one,

1948
00:54:14,641 --> 00:54:15,030
one,

1949
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,440
one of these new methods,

1950
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,540
much like this cryo thing,

1951
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:21,780
much like many of these other protocols
where they're trying to figure out ways

1952
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:25,950
to kind of trick your body into ramping
up the healing process are ramping up

1953
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:26,250
the,

1954
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,580
so it's used for healing not for,

1955
00:54:27,581 --> 00:54:30,930
is trying to try any person for
both for both was just been curious.

1956
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:34,380
It'd be interesting to see how it compares
to just traditional strength training

1957
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:35,760
as far as you know,

1958
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,710
actual general strain.

1959
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:38,161
Yeah.

1960
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:43,110
And the idea also is that it puts a strong
load on your muscles but not on your

1961
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:46,320
joints because everything you're doing
like say if you're doing like kettle bell

1962
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:47,610
curls to failure.

1963
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:51,150
I was doing it with like a 35
pound kettle bell with two hands.

1964
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,320
That's not a lot of weight.

1965
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:55,530
Now it's not a lot of weight and
just you're just cranking out reps,

1966
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:59,040
but because your biceps
are tied off at the top,

1967
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:03,150
he's just getting that blood crazy pumped
and trapped up and to the ends of the

1968
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:03,660
muscles.

1969
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:03,810
Yeah,

1970
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:04,800
your arms just flows.

1971
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:05,251
We restrict it.

1972
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:05,550
I get,

1973
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:05,731
yeah,

1974
00:55:05,731 --> 00:55:06,420
they grow dry.

1975
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,260
They look giant.

1976
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:08,280
Like your arms are giant.

1977
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:09,540
It's painful,

1978
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,081
it's painful.

1979
00:55:10,081 --> 00:55:14,250
But I just fucked around with it yesterday
for the first time and apparently the

1980
00:55:14,251 --> 00:55:17,100
results are amazing and a ad on it.

1981
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,960
We're starting to look
into this and trying to,

1982
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:19,231
you know,

1983
00:55:19,231 --> 00:55:22,920
see what we could do with it to
bring this to the mainstream,

1984
00:55:22,921 --> 00:55:26,340
but to try to get more athletes
involved doing things like this.

1985
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:27,660
We kind of get these,

1986
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:30,000
you get these results
where you start going,

1987
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:30,241
oh,

1988
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:30,481
okay,

1989
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:32,850
well if you do that and this,

1990
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:37,970
what if you do cryotherapy and this
Kaatsu method and also the breathing also

1991
00:55:38,221 --> 00:55:38,801
that like what are,

1992
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:39,420
what are the,

1993
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:39,761
what's the,

1994
00:55:39,761 --> 00:55:42,180
the difference in the
response to your body?

1995
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:44,280
Like what's the difference
in how quickly you can heal,

1996
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:46,230
how quickly you can get in shape.

1997
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:50,430
And that's a big issue for MMA fighters
is the downtime from injury and then

1998
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:53,220
ramping your body back up to
competition shape afterwards.

1999
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:54,811
You could tell,

2000
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:58,260
I mean anybody who's ever gotten to a
very good fitness level and then got

2001
00:55:58,261 --> 00:55:58,950
injured,

2002
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:02,640
it's so frustrating getting back to
the gym and then trying to get back in

2003
00:56:02,641 --> 00:56:03,180
shape.

2004
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,470
I said a lot of guys never,

2005
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:07,200
never do get back because
it's just such a hard row.

2006
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:07,950
Uh,

2007
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:09,270
such a hard road to,

2008
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,130
to come back on.

2009
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:14,850
It's hard for people to accept
the state that they're in.

2010
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:15,481
You know,

2011
00:56:15,481 --> 00:56:19,200
like especially that's one of
the issues with younger athletes.

2012
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:19,771
You know,

2013
00:56:19,771 --> 00:56:20,431
you're young,

2014
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:21,031
you're 20,

2015
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:22,140
your body heals quick,

2016
00:56:22,141 --> 00:56:23,860
you're just a wild motherfucker and your,

2017
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:27,070
he'd doing anything you want your
rank list and as you get older,

2018
00:56:27,071 --> 00:56:29,290
it's one of the things that I liked
about your article that you wrote.

2019
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,670
You have to be smarter.

2020
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,541
You have to be smarter.

2021
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:34,210
You have to recognize that your
body's going to take longer to heal.

2022
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,620
You can't be reckless with it.

2023
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:38,500
And also you really should probably
shouldn't have been reckless with it when

2024
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:39,334
you were 20.

2025
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:40,090
But you could,

2026
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:41,980
you could get away with
it to a certain extent.

2027
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,150
Now that you're older,

2028
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:44,260
you have to be wiser.

2029
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,040
You know,

2030
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,500
everyone thinks they're bulletproof
and they're going to last forever.

2031
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:47,830
You know,

2032
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:49,210
you just can't even imagine.

2033
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,010
I can remember going to
a wrestling tournament.

2034
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:52,421
It was in York,

2035
00:56:52,421 --> 00:56:53,140
Pennsylvania.

2036
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:53,860
It was like,

2037
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:57,280
I used to do the summer wrestle
freestyle wrestling circuit.

2038
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,380
They used to have tournaments
all over Pennsylvania.

2039
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,950
And I remember meeting a guy that was
like 33 years old and I was just blown

2040
00:57:05,081 --> 00:57:05,914
away.

2041
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,113
My God,

2042
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,790
you're still wrestling you 33 Oh man,

2043
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:10,571
you're my new hero.

2044
00:57:10,571 --> 00:57:11,380
I can't believe it.

2045
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,500
I want to be just like you went.

2046
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,320
And I just couldn't believe.

2047
00:57:14,321 --> 00:57:18,700
I thought this guy was like ancient
in was probably like 19 at the time.

2048
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:22,450
And I could not believe that this guy
was in there wrestling as well as he did

2049
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,673
at 33.

2050
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,001
That's that funny.

2051
00:57:25,001 --> 00:57:25,840
Now you'd kill it.

2052
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:28,480
Do anything to get the
32 year old body man,

2053
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,220
42 year old.

2054
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,093
I was like,

2055
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,460
still fantastic,

2056
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:33,860
you know,

2057
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,720
still feeling great.

2058
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:35,471
But,

2059
00:57:35,471 --> 00:57:35,730
uh,

2060
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:36,041
yeah,

2061
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:36,874
I mean,

2062
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:37,960
as my grandfather said,

2063
00:57:37,961 --> 00:57:39,310
no one gets out of here alive.

2064
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:40,680
You're,

2065
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,513
you know,

2066
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,130
father time will take its toll over time,

2067
00:57:45,131 --> 00:57:46,030
no matter what you're doing,

2068
00:57:46,031 --> 00:57:48,040
no matter how many therapies and so forth,

2069
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:48,940
you know,

2070
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:52,630
but you tried to do your best with what
she got and you do try to preserve your

2071
00:57:52,631 --> 00:57:53,830
youth and your vitality.

2072
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:54,840
But one,

2073
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,320
one of the major problems I see,

2074
00:57:56,321 --> 00:58:01,321
especially an extremist sports
like Jujitsu or MMA or whatever,

2075
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:02,120
uh,

2076
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,190
is the overtraining.

2077
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:07,780
Everyone thinks more is better
and it's not better's better,

2078
00:58:07,781 --> 00:58:08,950
but more is not better.

2079
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,630
That's a huge issue with rustling.

2080
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,530
Oh,

2081
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,310
terrible.

2082
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:17,310
Wrestlers may are notoriously the most
overtrained group of athletes there are,

2083
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:18,430
I think.

2084
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:21,130
But isn't that training
with the overtraining?

2085
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:24,760
Doesn't that develop this insane mental
toughness that wrestlers are known for?

2086
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:25,750
That's part of it.

2087
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,690
The mental toughness is,

2088
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:28,030
is,

2089
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:30,520
is a huge part of it because
that is a hard ass sport.

2090
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,720
Did you happen to see the,

2091
00:58:31,721 --> 00:58:32,290
uh,

2092
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:33,123
the uh,

2093
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:34,663
uh,

2094
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:35,800
Foxcatcher the movie?

2095
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:36,161
Yes,

2096
00:58:36,161 --> 00:58:36,680
I did.

2097
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,091
And that,

2098
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:37,540
uh,

2099
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,340
it wasn't exactly accurate at all.

2100
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:39,880
No.

2101
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,520
Mark Schultz put up actually
a thing on his Facebook page,

2102
00:58:42,521 --> 00:58:43,670
all the accuracies.

2103
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,050
Okay.

2104
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:44,883
That are in that movie.

2105
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,030
And they're pretty substantial.

2106
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:46,870
Pretty substantial.

2107
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:47,081
Yeah.

2108
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:47,290
It's,

2109
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,060
it's really,

2110
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,780
it's actually frustrating and annoying.

2111
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:51,100
The guy's alive.

2112
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:54,040
He's an Olympic gold
medalist world champion,

2113
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:55,240
one of the best wrestlers,

2114
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,380
really pretty much ever,

2115
00:58:56,381 --> 00:58:57,214
ever.

2116
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,000
And they,

2117
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,430
they portrayed him in a
very inaccurate light.

2118
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:01,323
Pretty much so.

2119
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:01,630
Yeah.

2120
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:01,930
I mean,

2121
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:03,490
they made him look like a dumb jock.

2122
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,600
The guy's brilliant.

2123
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,210
The guy was brilliant
and a very articulate,

2124
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:08,044
very smart guy.

2125
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:08,950
And um,

2126
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:13,030
my college wrestling coach
was the junior coach there.

2127
00:59:13,031 --> 00:59:14,470
Foxcatcher rule.

2128
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:15,010
Yeah.

2129
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:15,620
Dale bonds.

2130
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:15,721
Well,

2131
00:59:15,721 --> 00:59:16,990
he's in the college,

2132
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:21,070
so he was a NCAA coaches hall of fame.

2133
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:21,620
Uh,

2134
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,070
so this was

2135
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,660
after you were in college visit?

2136
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,280
After I graduated from college,

2137
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,650
I was still living in Philly and you know,

2138
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:31,490
Dale used to invite me to come on
down and a train now and again.

2139
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:31,911
And I,

2140
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:33,380
I took him up on a couple of times.

2141
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:36,320
Unfortunately it was just a little
bit too far away to be driving,

2142
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:36,831
you know,

2143
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,790
I had a day job.

2144
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,460
Wrestling is one of those sports that,

2145
00:59:39,461 --> 00:59:39,950
uh,

2146
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:42,710
you pretty much have to have your mid
afternoons open cause that's when all the

2147
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:45,680
universities train and
that's when most guys train.

2148
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:47,090
So I was really,

2149
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,050
you know,

2150
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,360
Jones if for some grappling experience,

2151
00:59:50,361 --> 00:59:54,050
but it was really hard working at job
and at that time I was married and it

2152
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:55,520
hauls holder with a family and all that.

2153
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:59,180
But I think you're down a few times and
I got a chance to tour the facility and

2154
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:02,540
it was really impressive
and a headache clinic with,

2155
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:03,020
um,

2156
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,290
well the guy they didn't even mention
was that guy a Valentine Jordan,

2157
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:07,670
the Bulgarian guy.

2158
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,020
That's the guy that,

2159
01:00:09,021 --> 01:00:09,230
uh,

2160
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,063
dupont,

2161
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:10,370
uh,

2162
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:13,430
gave his whole fortune two when he died,

2163
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:14,780
his fortune went to the,

2164
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:15,320
uh,

2165
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,250
this Bulgarian,

2166
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:16,580
uh,

2167
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,200
coach reels that fuck yeah,

2168
01:00:18,201 --> 01:00:18,600
the,

2169
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,730
the family's still fighting it.

2170
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,010
There's still contesting it to this day.

2171
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:23,390
Wow.

2172
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:23,841
Yeah.

2173
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:24,920
He really liked this guy.

2174
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,300
And so I had a,

2175
01:00:26,301 --> 01:00:27,770
I had a couple of clinics with that guy,

2176
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:29,440
one at Drexel and uh,

2177
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:29,811
cause he,

2178
01:00:29,811 --> 01:00:30,021
you know,

2179
01:00:30,021 --> 01:00:34,730
he's making his way around the different
colleges and learned a lot of awesome

2180
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,600
exercises.

2181
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:37,340
And conditioning and wrestling.

2182
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,950
And of course I met the
great day of shoulds,

2183
01:00:39,951 --> 01:00:40,970
had a clinic with him.

2184
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:42,020
It's like wow.

2185
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:46,400
He was definitely one of
America's finest wrestlers ever.

2186
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:50,300
But even more than his physical
skills was as his mental skills.

2187
01:00:50,301 --> 01:00:50,640
He,

2188
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:55,460
he just had an amazing mind and
I was really fortunate to have,

2189
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:56,210
you know,

2190
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:59,390
been able to travel in those type of
circles and get a chance to see it.

2191
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:00,980
But this is after my,

2192
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:01,521
my,

2193
01:01:01,521 --> 01:01:01,820
uh,

2194
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:02,870
college wrestling days.

2195
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:05,210
So I was looking for that
thing to fill the gap,

2196
01:01:05,211 --> 01:01:05,960
you know?

2197
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,110
And that's when I discovered
this Gracie brothers,

2198
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:09,711
you know,

2199
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:10,970
around 1989 man,

2200
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:11,480
it was like,

2201
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,290
Oh shit,

2202
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:13,900
this is what I been walking for a man.

2203
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:16,310
What is it about the Bulgarians?

2204
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,300
A lot of the Russians and you know,

2205
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:22,850
there's a lot of those people from that
part of the world that has such good

2206
01:01:22,851 --> 01:01:23,501
athletes.

2207
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:25,940
There's so many tough people
from that part of the world.

2208
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:26,361
Like,

2209
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:27,170
what is that?

2210
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:27,321
Well,

2211
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:28,040
you know,

2212
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:32,570
a lot of our best fighters come
from the poorer sections of America.

2213
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:33,380
You know,

2214
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,490
kids come up in the projects and you know,

2215
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:37,190
some of these inner city kids,

2216
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:38,533
you know,

2217
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:39,280
look at,

2218
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:39,830
uh,

2219
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:43,670
like in Philly or Detroit or
Mandy gets him tough kids.

2220
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,960
They grew up scrapping and it
builds a mental toughness sometimes,

2221
01:01:47,961 --> 01:01:48,794
you know,

2222
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,380
like a Mike Tyson growing up where,

2223
01:01:51,381 --> 01:01:54,920
where he did and a hell's
kitchen up there in New York.

2224
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:56,660
I mean Brownsville ox or Brownsville.

2225
01:01:56,661 --> 01:01:57,040
Yeah.

2226
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,910
So I mean those guys are just,

2227
01:01:59,180 --> 01:01:59,511
you know,

2228
01:01:59,511 --> 01:01:59,621
they,

2229
01:01:59,621 --> 01:02:01,910
they grow up in a really
tough neighborhood.

2230
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:06,650
It's kind of like dog eat
dog and it produces like a
really tough kind of minded

2231
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,060
person.

2232
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,580
And I think a lot of these
eastern European countries,

2233
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:11,180
you know,

2234
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:13,220
they don't have much and you know,

2235
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:13,451
they,

2236
01:02:13,451 --> 01:02:14,030
they,

2237
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:14,540
they,

2238
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:14,991
they,

2239
01:02:14,991 --> 01:02:15,824
uh,

2240
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,210
they have a lot of time in their hands.

2241
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,980
There's not a lot to do for the kids.

2242
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:19,741
And you know,

2243
01:02:19,741 --> 01:02:20,070
they end

2244
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,000
up like most boys,

2245
01:02:21,001 --> 01:02:21,211
you know,

2246
01:02:21,211 --> 01:02:24,840
getting into trouble and fighting and
doing all this kind of crazy stuff.

2247
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,640
I think that's one of the reasons why,

2248
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:26,940
uh,

2249
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:31,200
this new urban playground gymnastics
kind of stuffed at the guys are doing,

2250
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:33,300
it's become so popular because I mean,

2251
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:33,840
you know,

2252
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,820
that's pretty available.

2253
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:36,720
It's just equipment.

2254
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:39,030
Just sitting there cost
very little to put it in.

2255
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,950
Did we play that video of you there?

2256
01:02:40,951 --> 01:02:44,010
Last time we were here with
the Wa with the bar stars,

2257
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:45,263
that was pretty cool.

2258
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,553
Pretty cool man.

2259
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:49,830
But in eastern Europe that
stuff's really popular,

2260
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:50,280
you know?

2261
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,113
And um,

2262
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,800
so yeah,

2263
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:54,000
they don't have a lot to do.

2264
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:56,300
They don't have the same kind of uh,

2265
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,980
basketball courts that we do and they,

2266
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:01,260
they don't have the
facilities all the times,

2267
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,300
but wrestling is pretty cheap,

2268
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:03,910
man.

2269
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:04,200
You know,

2270
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:04,420
you know,

2271
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,820
it doesn't take a lot of equipment,

2272
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:08,040
anybody just wrestling really.

2273
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,280
There's a lot of boxers right now
that are coming out of the bar,

2274
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,070
the world as well.

2275
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:11,700
Sure.

2276
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,970
I mean a surrogate cove Kovalev
of you have seen him fight before?

2277
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:15,901
I have not.

2278
01:03:15,901 --> 01:03:16,830
I've heard the name,

2279
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:17,251
but I,

2280
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,030
I haven't had the opportunity
to actually see him.

2281
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,420
He's a motherfucker around.

2282
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,170
It can be Bernard Hopkins.

2283
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:25,950
And then he just beat John
Pascale the other night.

2284
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:26,760
And man,

2285
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,593
it's amazing.

2286
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:29,340
It's such amazing good fighter.

2287
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:30,420
The way he moves.

2288
01:03:30,421 --> 01:03:30,601
I mean,

2289
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:32,280
he really makes boxing exciting again.

2290
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,153
He's a killer.

2291
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,620
Just goes for the kill,

2292
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:35,611
like constantly,

2293
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:36,930
but super technical,

2294
01:03:36,931 --> 01:03:38,420
like everything about his movement.

2295
01:03:38,421 --> 01:03:39,340
It's very technical.

2296
01:03:39,341 --> 01:03:43,770
It's foot work is his ditzes distancing
the economy of his movements,

2297
01:03:43,771 --> 01:03:44,880
the way throws punches.

2298
01:03:44,881 --> 01:03:45,990
Just beautiful,

2299
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:46,980
beautiful to watch.

2300
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,990
But there's so many tough guys,

2301
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,250
canonical off skin,

2302
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:51,241
all these tough,

2303
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:54,360
tough guys coming out
of Russia of that area.

2304
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:54,601
You know,

2305
01:03:54,601 --> 01:03:56,790
that part of the world is
so former Soviet Union.

2306
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:57,541
Well,

2307
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:59,520
I've traveled like into Siberia.

2308
01:03:59,521 --> 01:03:59,771
I've,

2309
01:03:59,771 --> 01:04:00,001
I,

2310
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:00,980
I traveled Jill,

2311
01:04:00,981 --> 01:04:01,291
like,

2312
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:01,980
uh,

2313
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:02,813
uh,

2314
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:03,450
you know,

2315
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:04,950
Dan around the Black Sea area.

2316
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,650
I've been to a lot of
the Slavic countries too.

2317
01:04:06,651 --> 01:04:06,870
You know,

2318
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:08,910
Serbia and Slovenia and man,

2319
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:13,911
the gods are huge big strapping guys and
you just don't see the obesity either.

2320
01:04:14,971 --> 01:04:15,804
Man.

2321
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:16,810
They don't have the food,

2322
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:17,580
you know,

2323
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:21,480
they can't afford just to overeat
like we do in America or you know,

2324
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:22,570
and uh,

2325
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,590
the rest of Europe or the UK or whatever.

2326
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:26,370
Uh,

2327
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,210
you see some,

2328
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:27,720
you know,

2329
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,531
some real fatties,

2330
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:28,891
but man,

2331
01:04:28,891 --> 01:04:29,724
when you're there,

2332
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:30,091
wow,

2333
01:04:30,091 --> 01:04:33,990
people are pretty pretty lean and wiring
and stringy and a lot of the younger

2334
01:04:33,991 --> 01:04:36,240
guys are just like specimens.

2335
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:39,180
I don't know whether it's
genetics or it has to be,

2336
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:42,060
I mean you think about the people that
have lived and gotten through those harsh

2337
01:04:42,061 --> 01:04:47,061
climates and tough jobs and just had to
work survival of the fittest and that's,

2338
01:04:47,311 --> 01:04:49,800
those are the people that bread and
those are the people that kept going.

2339
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:54,150
We what you notice also about a lot of
those people from that part of the world

2340
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:54,640
it,

2341
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,760
which is interesting enough was
not just that they're tough,

2342
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,500
but they're very technical.

2343
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,880
There's a lot of really
technical wrestling that
comes out of Russia and a out

2344
01:05:02,881 --> 01:05:04,320
of the former Soviet Union,

2345
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:04,861
that area,

2346
01:05:04,861 --> 01:05:06,060
like those guys,

2347
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,400
those Russian nationals
that went up to Montreal,

2348
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,870
that's a lot of weird.

2349
01:05:09,871 --> 01:05:11,730
George Saint Pierre
learned how to wrestle,

2350
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,930
never wrestled in high school,

2351
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,010
never rested on college,

2352
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,650
but became one of the
best wrestlers in MMA.

2353
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,310
And that's part of the reason why

2354
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:22,090
I remember I wrestled
a bear this in the 70s,

2355
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,700
arrested in the Montreal
open wrestling tournament.

2356
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:25,913
And this is just a,

2357
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:29,440
at that time when the Russians
were making a big influx in,

2358
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:29,771
you know,

2359
01:05:29,771 --> 01:05:34,771
they were starting to charge to a
defect and flee to the Western world,

2360
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,280
the Soviet Union,

2361
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:37,120
it was still existed.

2362
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:42,070
And I remember our wrestled
Victor Silberman in the
finals and got my ass handed

2363
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:42,311
to me,

2364
01:05:42,311 --> 01:05:43,090
man.

2365
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:46,120
And so I was trying to talk to him later
because I was really impressed with

2366
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:46,421
this guy,

2367
01:05:46,421 --> 01:05:48,040
his technique and his
skill and everything.

2368
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:49,020
And uh,

2369
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:49,180
I,

2370
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:52,930
I was utterly shocked when he told me
the only lifted weights once a week.

2371
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,420
He lifted weights four times a month.

2372
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:56,590
And at that,

2373
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:57,850
how is that even possible?

2374
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,940
I thought these Russian guys
like lifted weights every day,

2375
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:01,803
twice a day.

2376
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:02,480
And he says,

2377
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:02,730
no,

2378
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:02,831
no,

2379
01:06:02,831 --> 01:06:02,951
no,

2380
01:06:02,951 --> 01:06:03,190
no.

2381
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:06,700
We practice technical wrestling
is the base of our training.

2382
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:09,670
And then I was utterly shocked.

2383
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:10,750
Um,

2384
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:11,081
I had,

2385
01:06:11,081 --> 01:06:11,280
uh,

2386
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,720
a guy that was trained with
me in Philly for a while.

2387
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,780
It's five times the Ukrainian
national wrestling champion.

2388
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:19,030
You used to be on the national team.

2389
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:23,470
This was back when the Ukraine and Russia
is all part of the Soviet Union and he

2390
01:06:23,471 --> 01:06:24,181
was telling me that,

2391
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:24,760
um,

2392
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:29,080
they would only spar really hardly twice
a week because they found that the live

2393
01:06:29,081 --> 01:06:31,420
wrestling was what was
producing all the injuries.

2394
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,220
But when they would train,

2395
01:06:33,221 --> 01:06:37,180
they would train like real slow motion
and they be gradually built their speed

2396
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:41,080
to the point where they were just going
all out horn and they would just do this

2397
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:43,360
for long periods of time and wow.

2398
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:47,560
It is unbelievably hard workout when
you're shooting high crotch singles,

2399
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:52,830
doubles and so forth at match speed
over and over and over and over.

2400
01:06:53,231 --> 01:06:54,340
It's like Holy Shit.

2401
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,530
And that was their main cardio.

2402
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,810
It takes real discipline
to that discipline,

2403
01:06:58,811 --> 01:06:58,990
man.

2404
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:00,970
Most people that's in Jujitsu as well.

2405
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,840
It's very similar.

2406
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,460
A lot of your sentence want to roll,

2407
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:04,170
just want to roll.

2408
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:05,440
You don't want to go over drills,

2409
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:06,610
but they never get technical.

2410
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,330
That's the problem.

2411
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:08,170
That is the problem.

2412
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:08,750
Yeah.

2413
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:13,450
Drills or where you really learn how to
have those movements become a part of

2414
01:07:13,451 --> 01:07:14,290
your nervous system.

2415
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,070
And then he,

2416
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:16,511
you know,

2417
01:07:16,511 --> 01:07:16,900
and,

2418
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:17,201
and,

2419
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:19,090
and keeping the sparring limited,

2420
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:19,980
uh,

2421
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:20,340
you,

2422
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,920
you don't get your muscles and joints
is stressed and you don't get the

2423
01:07:23,921 --> 01:07:24,580
injuries.

2424
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:25,840
But I was very surprised to hear that,

2425
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:26,531
uh,

2426
01:07:26,531 --> 01:07:26,831
you know,

2427
01:07:26,831 --> 01:07:28,840
cause I had a complete different,

2428
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:29,740
uh,

2429
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:31,580
perception because American wrestling,

2430
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,870
he just basically pounding each other
every time you go into the wrestling room,

2431
01:07:34,871 --> 01:07:35,071
you know,

2432
01:07:35,071 --> 01:07:35,904
it's just,

2433
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:36,923
you know,

2434
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,613
yeah.

2435
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:39,880
That is the problem with,

2436
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:40,890
uh,

2437
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:41,131
do,

2438
01:07:41,131 --> 01:07:44,070
do the American produce amazingly
tough wrestlers of course.

2439
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,770
But the reason I think
why we're not seeing,

2440
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:48,520
uh,

2441
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,650
Americans dominating the
international scene anymore,

2442
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,360
it's like there's no damn money at it,

2443
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:52,870
man.

2444
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:53,230
You know,

2445
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:53,471
you,

2446
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,210
you graduate from college and you know,

2447
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,590
maybe you have a degree or whatever,

2448
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:58,480
but what are you going to do
with your wrestling skills?

2449
01:07:58,630 --> 01:07:59,710
MMA,

2450
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:02,290
the UFC opened up a whole new,

2451
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:03,423
you know,

2452
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:07,600
a whole new door for
former NCAA wrestlers.

2453
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:12,550
Why the hell would he go and go to the
Olympics and make peanuts when you can

2454
01:08:12,551 --> 01:08:14,590
make fairly decent money?

2455
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:15,860
Possibly if you're good,

2456
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:15,980
you

2457
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,220
know,

2458
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:16,941
if you're tough.

2459
01:08:16,941 --> 01:08:17,774
God,

2460
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:18,470
yeah,

2461
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,610
that's what I wanted to know.

2462
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:24,650
Do the Russians have that same issue
with overtraining during the no.

2463
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:24,960
No,

2464
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,210
because they don't spar.

2465
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,073
Uh,

2466
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:27,341
uh,

2467
01:08:27,341 --> 01:08:29,300
as much as the Americans do that,

2468
01:08:29,301 --> 01:08:31,340
they are very careful not
to over train as they,

2469
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:31,700
you know,

2470
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:31,941
they,

2471
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:32,350
they,

2472
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:35,210
they have like blocks where they kind of,

2473
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:35,900
you know,

2474
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:39,080
they kind of amp ramp up the training
as they get near a narrow like world

2475
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:40,580
championships or the Olympics or whatever.

2476
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,560
Some people call it
periodization or whatever,

2477
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:43,280
but they,

2478
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:47,150
they're very careful not to
overtrain and over overdo it.

2479
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:47,511
Well,

2480
01:08:47,511 --> 01:08:47,931
how come?

2481
01:08:47,931 --> 01:08:48,170
Well,

2482
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:50,120
they're known for their
mental toughness as well.

2483
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:51,140
Like why does,

2484
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,230
why don't the American wrestlers
incorporate that into their workouts?

2485
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:55,430
Or have they started to do,

2486
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:56,510
they probably are,

2487
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:56,781
you know,

2488
01:08:56,781 --> 01:08:59,330
I've lost a little bit of touch
with the wrestling community,

2489
01:08:59,331 --> 01:08:59,931
but you know,

2490
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:01,760
our wrestling coaches are fantastic.

2491
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:01,941
You know,

2492
01:09:01,941 --> 01:09:03,010
the smart guy.

2493
01:09:03,011 --> 01:09:06,830
So I'm sure they're taking a hard look
because the Russians have been really

2494
01:09:06,831 --> 01:09:10,130
successful as have the
Iranians as the Turks,

2495
01:09:10,131 --> 01:09:11,090
the Bulgarians,

2496
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:11,630
you know,

2497
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:15,410
all of these countries that perennially
put out like world champions,

2498
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:16,520
Azerbaijan,

2499
01:09:16,521 --> 01:09:17,354
you know,

2500
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:17,690
uh,

2501
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:20,960
the Mongolians are really starting
to dominate a judo and they,

2502
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:21,201
you know,

2503
01:09:21,201 --> 01:09:22,880
they've always been tough
as shit and wrestling.

2504
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:25,700
So I think that,

2505
01:09:25,701 --> 01:09:25,880
uh,

2506
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,200
for sure you can learn a lot from their,

2507
01:09:28,201 --> 01:09:30,680
their basic programs that are
pretty simple programs really.

2508
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:31,431
They're,

2509
01:09:31,431 --> 01:09:31,731
they're,

2510
01:09:31,731 --> 01:09:32,001
they're,

2511
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,820
they don't have a lot of
sophisticated equipment and so forth,

2512
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,280
but what they meant,

2513
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,010
they make up,

2514
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:42,010
they make up for a lack of sophistication
with equipment and facilities and all

2515
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:43,910
that with technique.

2516
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,680
They're real technicians.

2517
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:48,500
That is the most important
part of any martial art.

2518
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:53,270
The most important part is having that
technique down to just a razor sharpness

2519
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:54,370
or razor sharpness.

2520
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:54,591
Man.

2521
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:56,720
You've got to hone those
skills because you know,

2522
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:58,100
a MMA,

2523
01:09:58,101 --> 01:09:58,970
Jiu Jitsu,

2524
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,601
judo,

2525
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:00,260
wrestling,

2526
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,093
it's all technique.

2527
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:04,130
I really wish you'd
watch this past weekend,

2528
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:06,420
this UFC because a man,

2529
01:10:06,421 --> 01:10:07,880
I'm going to have to catch
it on the replay now.

2530
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:11,420
You got to watch Anthony Pettis versus
Hofeld dos Anjos there must have been

2531
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:12,080
hell of a match.

2532
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:12,740
Ooh.

2533
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:17,120
Dos Anjos beat the brakes
off of the Internet yet.

2534
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:18,561
Okay.

2535
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:20,840
How long did they wait to
before they were loaded it up?

2536
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:21,500
I mean,

2537
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,910
what site do you go to to,

2538
01:10:22,911 --> 01:10:23,450
to uh,

2539
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:24,283
fight,

2540
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,071
fight pass.

2541
01:10:25,071 --> 01:10:25,970
UFC fight pass.

2542
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:26,340
Yeah.

2543
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:26,580
It's,

2544
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:26,960
I dunno,

2545
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,100
I don't believe it's up yet.

2546
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:28,451
Okay.

2547
01:10:28,451 --> 01:10:29,120
And I'll check.

2548
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:29,990
I don't think it is.

2549
01:10:29,991 --> 01:10:30,151
I mean,

2550
01:10:30,151 --> 01:10:31,190
you don't know what's on paper view.

2551
01:10:31,191 --> 01:10:32,770
It might be available on fight pass.

2552
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,210
Okay.

2553
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:33,510
Yeah,

2554
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:34,520
I was just curious how long,

2555
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:34,831
but I'll,

2556
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:35,211
I'll go.

2557
01:10:35,211 --> 01:10:36,200
I'll definitely give it a check.

2558
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:38,420
Fipass F has pretty much everything.

2559
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:39,440
Um,

2560
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,820
but I don't know how,

2561
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:44,660
I think they do show some pay per views.

2562
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:46,400
They have live events.

2563
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:46,890
Hey,

2564
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:47,391
why don't you,

2565
01:10:47,391 --> 01:10:48,320
why don't you bring their cup of,

2566
01:10:48,321 --> 01:10:49,550
I'm going to run the
men's room real quick.

2567
01:10:49,551 --> 01:10:50,810
I'll be right back on just one sec.

2568
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,261
Go ahead.

2569
01:10:51,261 --> 01:10:51,891
I'll try to find it.

2570
01:10:51,891 --> 01:10:53,600
We'll see if we could find
some highlights of it.

2571
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:53,871
But,

2572
01:10:53,871 --> 01:10:54,470
uh,

2573
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:58,350
what I'm going to ask Steve about it
after he gets done using the little girl's

2574
01:10:58,351 --> 01:10:59,184
real,

2575
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:00,283
um,

2576
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:00,610
uh,

2577
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:05,000
w w what was incredibly impressive was
not just the skill level the doe Sandra

2578
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:05,391
showed,

2579
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:05,990
but the,

2580
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:09,140
the pace and the fitness and Steve,

2581
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:10,350
uh,

2582
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,420
he doesn't want to toot his own horn,

2583
01:11:11,421 --> 01:11:12,650
saw two towards the other room.

2584
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:13,650
He's like,

2585
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:14,130
he's so

2586
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:14,941
knowledgeable.

2587
01:11:14,941 --> 01:11:19,941
And he got Diego Sanchez and did probably
the best shape of his life when Diego,

2588
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:20,220
uh,

2589
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:25,220
challenged Bj Penn for the belt and Diego
wound up getting beaten pretty badly

2590
01:11:26,191 --> 01:11:29,880
by Bj when PJ was in his prime
BJ's like an all time great.

2591
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,440
And I'm just,

2592
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:31,860
uh,

2593
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,480
one of my all time favorite fighters,

2594
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:37,380
but he was in incredible
shape for this fight as well,

2595
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:40,320
which was always like kind
of his Achilles heel was his,

2596
01:11:40,321 --> 01:11:40,950
uh,

2597
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:41,940
he was so talented,

2598
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:43,320
but he just never really

2599
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:49,140
was able to continue that sort of
strength and conditioning program that got

2600
01:11:49,141 --> 01:11:52,290
them into the shape that he was
when he fought Diego Sanchez.

2601
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,080
And what we were talking about with Steve,

2602
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:56,190
um,

2603
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:58,590
being that the technique is so important,

2604
01:11:58,591 --> 01:11:59,970
it is so incredibly important,

2605
01:11:59,971 --> 01:12:03,750
but MMA is so unbelievably grueling.

2606
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:04,560
Yeah.

2607
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,420
I had a conversation with shale sign
about it who's a former UFC fighter and

2608
01:12:08,421 --> 01:12:10,200
he's fought for the title several times,

2609
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:14,850
a great fighter and also a very open guy,

2610
01:12:14,851 --> 01:12:19,851
very open as far as like
his own limitations and his
strengths and weaknesses.

2611
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:25,380
And he was just talking about how the
time that you spend inside the octagon,

2612
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:30,410
the competing for 25 minutes is
almost impossible to really do.

2613
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,660
It's almost too much time.

2614
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:34,500
Um,

2615
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,770
what I was saying was that
Steve's back what I was saying,

2616
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:42,180
that the amount of time that you spend
in the octagon fighting in a championship

2617
01:12:42,181 --> 01:12:43,710
fight is so insane.

2618
01:12:43,711 --> 01:12:46,370
Like it's almost like you're
sprinting for 25 minutes.

2619
01:12:46,371 --> 01:12:47,130
It's brutal.

2620
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:52,130
And very few people figure out how to
get in the right shape as well as work

2621
01:12:54,031 --> 01:12:54,960
their skills.

2622
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:56,460
And there's that weird

2623
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,260
man because like endurance is a skill,

2624
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:05,300
but then there's also the skill of making
the other guy use up his energy more

2625
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:06,343
than yourself.

2626
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,720
And I mean that.

2627
01:13:08,721 --> 01:13:09,201
Enter the,

2628
01:13:09,201 --> 01:13:09,890
you know,

2629
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:10,190
uh,

2630
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:11,100
controlling and,

2631
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:16,130
and managing your energy system and the
rang and on the mat as such a skill unto

2632
01:13:18,021 --> 01:13:18,854
itself.

2633
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:19,580
I mean,

2634
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,000
not,

2635
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,510
let's just take out the striking skills
and the grappling skills and all that

2636
01:13:23,511 --> 01:13:24,230
stuff.

2637
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:25,820
Just that energy management,

2638
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:27,440
that's huge man.

2639
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:30,150
And a lot of guys don't
pay enough attention to it.

2640
01:13:30,151 --> 01:13:30,391
I think,

2641
01:13:30,391 --> 01:13:30,451
well,

2642
01:13:30,451 --> 01:13:30,960
dealing

2643
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,180
with pressure is a big one.

2644
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:37,470
I remember from my days of competing that
when guys like really aggressive and I

2645
01:13:37,471 --> 01:13:39,060
was backing up a lot
of trying to move away,

2646
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:42,150
I'd get so much more tired
because you're always thinking,

2647
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:42,861
you're thinking,

2648
01:13:42,861 --> 01:13:45,540
you're dealing with this guy
attacking you and you're backing up,

2649
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:47,220
which is kind of an unnatural movement.

2650
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,660
I mean a lot of people run,

2651
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:52,080
but very few people run backwards and
you've got to realize that when you're

2652
01:13:52,081 --> 01:13:53,070
going backwards,

2653
01:13:53,071 --> 01:13:56,460
you're kind of using your muscles
in a different way is different.

2654
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:57,303
Yeah.

2655
01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:02,790
And very few people do like Muhammad Ali's
to run miles backwards because he was

2656
01:14:02,821 --> 01:14:05,040
always backing up and then moving forward,

2657
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:06,210
backing up and moving forward.

2658
01:14:06,211 --> 01:14:08,910
And one of the most beautiful
things about him when you watch him,

2659
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:09,960
like in his prime,

2660
01:14:09,961 --> 01:14:12,940
like the Cleveland Big
Cat Williams days before,

2661
01:14:12,941 --> 01:14:13,060
uh,

2662
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:15,730
they took his title the way because he
didn't want to fight in the Vietnam War.

2663
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:21,090
His footwork and movement was just magical
and his ability to back up and be you

2664
01:14:21,121 --> 01:14:21,221
will,

2665
01:14:21,221 --> 01:14:22,480
you really couldn't catch him.

2666
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,580
He was just backing up and moving forward,

2667
01:14:24,581 --> 01:14:25,780
backing up and moving forward.

2668
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:29,110
And that's something he
had to work at really hard.

2669
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:34,111
But three minutes in a boxing match is
so much different than five minutes with

2670
01:14:34,331 --> 01:14:38,980
wrestling and leg kicks and
elbows and the clench and God,

2671
01:14:38,981 --> 01:14:40,450
it's one of the,

2672
01:14:40,451 --> 01:14:41,070
so I'm,

2673
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:44,140
I'm curious to see what you think after
you watch this fight because one of the

2674
01:14:44,141 --> 01:14:48,340
most impressive things about the fight
as far as dos Anjos performance was his

2675
01:14:48,341 --> 01:14:50,050
cardio was insane.

2676
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:52,720
There's just like something else,

2677
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:53,200
man.

2678
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:53,471
I mean,

2679
01:14:53,471 --> 01:14:56,450
he just attacked from the moment the,

2680
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:57,490
the fight started.

2681
01:14:57,491 --> 01:15:01,090
He just went after us
and just never let up.

2682
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,500
Like literally never went up,

2683
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:02,951
let up.

2684
01:15:02,951 --> 01:15:03,910
It was amazing.

2685
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:05,350
It really was amazing.

2686
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:06,161
Here's a,

2687
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:07,750
here's a maybe a sore point,

2688
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:08,680
uh,

2689
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:12,110
but what do you think about the,

2690
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:13,240
the use of the,

2691
01:15:13,241 --> 01:15:13,660
uh,

2692
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:18,550
performance enhancing like stimulants
took mask fatigue and so forth,

2693
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:18,970
like,

2694
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:21,180
which kinds you can do in another sales,

2695
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:21,750
legal,

2696
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,710
many different ones these days.

2697
01:15:23,711 --> 01:15:24,281
I'm just curious,

2698
01:15:24,281 --> 01:15:25,990
how are they testing for this stuff now?

2699
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:26,891
Uh,

2700
01:15:26,891 --> 01:15:27,281
you know,

2701
01:15:27,281 --> 01:15:27,641
are the,

2702
01:15:27,641 --> 01:15:28,920
are these guys using like,

2703
01:15:28,921 --> 01:15:29,720
uh,

2704
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:30,130
uh,

2705
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:35,130
various stimulants to keep them like
really pretty much hopped up while they're

2706
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:36,490
protesting for everything?

2707
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:36,950
Everything.

2708
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:39,490
So guys are getting popped
for a lot of different stuff.

2709
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,090
Okay.

2710
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:42,870
Hector lumbar discussed this
district strict testing now,

2711
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,800
especially California.

2712
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:47,410
I mean I've given this guy credit
but I give him credit again.

2713
01:15:47,411 --> 01:15:51,280
Andy fosters been the director of the
California State Athletic Commission for a

2714
01:15:51,281 --> 01:15:53,020
few think a couple of years now.

2715
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:54,040
But um,

2716
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,150
he's a former fighter,

2717
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:58,060
longtime martial artist
and he's very smart,

2718
01:15:58,061 --> 01:15:59,220
very diligent about this.

2719
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,053
And I've had some,

2720
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:03,880
I had a conversation with them when
the UFC was in Los Angeles and uh,

2721
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:05,320
one of the things that he said,

2722
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:05,981
he goes,

2723
01:16:05,981 --> 01:16:06,341
first of all,

2724
01:16:06,341 --> 01:16:07,900
we're going to test everybody tonight.

2725
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,580
We're not just testing the,

2726
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:10,810
the guys in the main event.

2727
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:11,980
We're not just testing,

2728
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:12,340
you know,

2729
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:12,511
the,

2730
01:16:12,511 --> 01:16:14,920
the people that are
involved in the paper view,

2731
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,110
we're testing everyone
that competes tonight,

2732
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:18,640
blood and urine.

2733
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:20,140
You're in before the fight,

2734
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:21,520
blood after the fantastic.

2735
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:22,540
It's a beautiful thing.

2736
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:23,230
It's so cute.

2737
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:25,350
I wish they'd do that
for a regular Jujitsu.

2738
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,060
Although it's probably cost prohibitive.

2739
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:28,300
It's very cost prohibitive.

2740
01:16:28,301 --> 01:16:30,100
It's like $40,000.

2741
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:30,461
I mean,

2742
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:31,690
depending on what lab you go to,

2743
01:16:31,691 --> 01:16:34,120
I'm sure the results
vary or the price varies,

2744
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:35,070
but,

2745
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:35,250
well,

2746
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:36,280
at least the place winners,

2747
01:16:36,281 --> 01:16:37,690
you know the first uh,

2748
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:39,220
yeah [inaudible] on the podium.

2749
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,570
He needs to have to be tested,

2750
01:16:40,571 --> 01:16:40,780
man.

2751
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:41,051
Yeah,

2752
01:16:41,051 --> 01:16:41,884
for Jujitsu,

2753
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:44,200
Jujitsu does have a real epidemic in it.

2754
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:44,591
It's a,

2755
01:16:44,591 --> 01:16:45,490
it's a real issue.

2756
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,390
And unfortunately a lot of Jujitsu guys
that have come over to MMA of pissed hot

2757
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:50,343
too.

2758
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:51,310
Um,

2759
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:54,760
what's a good strength is so
it's such a critical factor in,

2760
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:56,300
in forcing positions,

2761
01:16:56,301 --> 01:16:56,510
you know,

2762
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:58,750
I mean the technique
is everything for sure.

2763
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,520
But strength endurance ma'am,

2764
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:01,720
it's God damn huge.

2765
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:02,620
And there's some guys,

2766
01:17:02,621 --> 01:17:03,251
we all know,

2767
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:05,740
some guys you try to hit singles on them,

2768
01:17:05,741 --> 01:17:09,440
you try to like try to do an arm drag
and it's like trying to pull a wall.

2769
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:11,210
You some dude's like,

2770
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:11,991
look at who some are.

2771
01:17:11,991 --> 01:17:13,520
Paul Horace is a perfect example.

2772
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:16,220
That damn dude is so strong.

2773
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,930
He's so ridiculously strong.

2774
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:21,920
You see guys like John Fitch tangled
up with them and John Fetches in elite

2775
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:26,900
wrestler elite took him down and
cranked on his leg in the first round.

2776
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:27,051
I mean,

2777
01:17:27,051 --> 01:17:28,130
John Never got out of the round.

2778
01:17:28,131 --> 01:17:28,940
He just couldn't,

2779
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:29,750
couldn't get out of the round.

2780
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:32,480
All of sudden he's leg locked and just
didn't know what to do and got his,

2781
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:33,950
got his leg hyper extended.

2782
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:35,650
But these um,

2783
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:36,650
uh,

2784
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:37,760
performance enhancing drugs,

2785
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:40,610
they're catching guys for some
of them I've never even heard of.

2786
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:40,881
Oh,

2787
01:17:40,881 --> 01:17:45,290
they're getting so sophisticated and
stuff now there's so many new cocktails

2788
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:50,830
that fall kind of just within
the borders of legality,

2789
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,010
you know.

2790
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:55,850
Well that's what paper always
discovering some new way to hop up or,

2791
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:56,930
you know,

2792
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:57,331
I mean,

2793
01:17:57,331 --> 01:17:58,610
I was just curious about your take,

2794
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,031
you know,

2795
01:17:59,031 --> 01:18:00,470
because you're around
these guys all the time,

2796
01:18:00,471 --> 01:18:00,810
so,

2797
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:01,040
well,

2798
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,280
I think there's a lot of
guys that are taking things,

2799
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:04,820
um,

2800
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:06,560
when they don't think
they're going to get tested,

2801
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:07,101
you know,

2802
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:10,550
when they need to for the training
and just to get through it.

2803
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:10,820
Yeah.

2804
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:13,000
The training and also
to recover from injury.

2805
01:18:13,001 --> 01:18:13,940
So that's a big one.

2806
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,400
And not just injuries that
you know about like surgeries,

2807
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:18,140
but almost everybody is tweaked.

2808
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,830
You got to have a bum knee or your elbow
is bothering you or something's going

2809
01:18:21,831 --> 01:18:22,664
on with your neck.

2810
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:23,540
Everybody.

2811
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:25,410
There's almost no way of avoiding.

2812
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:25,910
No.

2813
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:26,151
Yeah,

2814
01:18:26,151 --> 01:18:26,661
exactly.

2815
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:31,661
You cannot engage in an extremist sport
like MMA and maybe to a lesser extent at

2816
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:38,740
Jujitsu and judo and wrestling at that
competitive level without the tweaks.

2817
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:39,951
Yeah.

2818
01:18:39,951 --> 01:18:41,270
I don't think there's a way impossible.

2819
01:18:41,271 --> 01:18:45,500
You cannot do a combat sport
without paying the price to the,

2820
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,280
to the body,

2821
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:50,090
but I wonder if a protocol
will eventually be a stab.

2822
01:18:50,091 --> 01:18:51,980
I was like the most intelligent protocol,

2823
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:56,590
similar to what you're getting
with these Russians that are there,

2824
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:57,890
that are developing,

2825
01:18:57,990 --> 01:19:02,810
they've developed this
program for wrestling where
they're just doing a lot of

2826
01:19:02,811 --> 01:19:03,740
technical training,

2827
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:05,540
not nearly as much sparring,

2828
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:07,010
but a lot of technique,

2829
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,470
a lot of repetition and drills.

2830
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:14,860
I wonder if that will slowly work its way
into MMA and be established as this is

2831
01:19:16,161 --> 01:19:17,060
the way to do it,

2832
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:18,051
the way they're doing it.

2833
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:18,884
Saying Russia.

2834
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:19,671
Yeah.

2835
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:20,260
Well,

2836
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:20,470
I,

2837
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:23,330
I think he's going to have to
at some point because you know,

2838
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:26,780
the career window for a lot of
these guys right now is like,

2839
01:19:26,781 --> 01:19:27,441
what would you say,

2840
01:19:27,441 --> 01:19:28,790
like two years maybe.

2841
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:29,960
Well,

2842
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:34,960
nine years seems to be the magic number
for everybody that seems like that,

2843
01:19:35,501 --> 01:19:35,691
right?

2844
01:19:35,691 --> 01:19:36,050
Yeah.

2845
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:40,430
But don't you see a lot of these guys
pretty much burning out within about a two

2846
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:40,761
and a half,

2847
01:19:40,761 --> 01:19:41,271
three years?

2848
01:19:41,271 --> 01:19:46,271
It seems like there's a Lotta guys that
flare to the top and then they're gone.

2849
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,301
Yeah.

2850
01:19:47,301 --> 01:19:48,470
There's also the issue with their,

2851
01:19:48,471 --> 01:19:51,170
they're kind of forced to keep
competing on a regular basis.

2852
01:19:51,171 --> 01:19:52,490
Once they become successful,

2853
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,420
especially you break into the top 10 and
you want to keep competing and winning.

2854
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,210
And so you win a big fight and say,

2855
01:19:59,211 --> 01:19:59,571
okay,

2856
01:19:59,571 --> 01:20:01,670
we're with the UFC calls you up on Monday,

2857
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:01,821
Hey,

2858
01:20:01,821 --> 01:20:02,651
we got blah,

2859
01:20:02,651 --> 01:20:02,771
blah,

2860
01:20:02,771 --> 01:20:03,021
blah,

2861
01:20:03,021 --> 01:20:03,854
and four months.

2862
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:04,611
And you're like,

2863
01:20:04,611 --> 01:20:05,150
fuck.

2864
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:05,750
Okay.

2865
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:06,291
And you think,

2866
01:20:06,291 --> 01:20:06,471
you know,

2867
01:20:06,471 --> 01:20:06,741
man,

2868
01:20:06,741 --> 01:20:08,340
I would really love to rest this knee.

2869
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:09,450
I'd really love to,

2870
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:09,881
you know,

2871
01:20:09,881 --> 01:20:10,230
uh,

2872
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:11,730
get some therapy on,

2873
01:20:11,731 --> 01:20:12,121
you know,

2874
01:20:12,121 --> 01:20:13,500
this elbow or whatever,

2875
01:20:13,501 --> 01:20:14,730
whatever issues you have.

2876
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,980
And oftentimes that's not an option.

2877
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:21,480
They have to go right back into training
camp and these injuries become chronic

2878
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:23,640
and it's a brutal way
to make it live in man.

2879
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:25,410
It's a very brutal way to make a living.

2880
01:20:25,411 --> 01:20:26,244
And some guys,

2881
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,780
I don't know how Randy coture did it.

2882
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:28,860
I don't know either.

2883
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:31,830
He got through and it was late
forties would no surgeries.

2884
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:34,100
Of course he was an anomaly.

2885
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:34,790
Me,

2886
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:34,990
uh,

2887
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:35,370
he,

2888
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:36,510
I mean he was like,

2889
01:20:36,511 --> 01:20:37,344
uh,

2890
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,190
I mean one out of thousands and thousands,

2891
01:20:41,191 --> 01:20:41,461
you know,

2892
01:20:41,461 --> 01:20:42,860
you just don't find guys like him.

2893
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:43,411
Yeah.

2894
01:20:43,411 --> 01:20:44,700
I don't know how the hell he did it.

2895
01:20:44,701 --> 01:20:45,060
I mean,

2896
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,650
I really have no idea.

2897
01:20:46,651 --> 01:20:46,801
It's,

2898
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:47,670
it's incredible.

2899
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,290
I wonder if he's suffering now at all.

2900
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:50,280
Do you know him personally?

2901
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:51,510
I do know him personally,

2902
01:20:51,511 --> 01:20:52,380
but he seems fine.

2903
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:52,880
Is He?

2904
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:53,210
Yeah.

2905
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:55,280
Just follow a dementia or anything?

2906
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:56,101
No,

2907
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:57,480
he was just interviewed recently.

2908
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:58,140
Um,

2909
01:20:58,140 --> 01:20:58,561
he,

2910
01:20:58,561 --> 01:20:58,891
uh,

2911
01:20:58,891 --> 01:21:02,850
was walking down the street with a girl
who looked like she was about 20 years

2912
01:21:02,851 --> 01:21:04,920
old and he's got to be about 50.

2913
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:06,900
She looked like,

2914
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:07,600
uh,

2915
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,510
like she just hopped off a porn set,

2916
01:21:09,511 --> 01:21:10,820
put on a tee shirt and uh,

2917
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,070
it's treading down the road,

2918
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:12,923
Captain America.

2919
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:13,801
Wow.

2920
01:21:13,801 --> 01:21:14,161
Man.

2921
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:14,551
As,

2922
01:21:14,551 --> 01:21:15,960
as my Australian friends,

2923
01:21:15,961 --> 01:21:16,291
I say,

2924
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:16,921
good on you,

2925
01:21:16,921 --> 01:21:17,400
mate.

2926
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,300
Good on you mate.

2927
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,010
So,

2928
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:19,540
yeah.

2929
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:20,070
Yeah.

2930
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:20,491
He,

2931
01:21:20,491 --> 01:21:21,120
um,

2932
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:21,421
I mean,

2933
01:21:21,421 --> 01:21:22,080
he seems fine,

2934
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,830
but the point being that they asked
him questions about Laila Ali,

2935
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:26,161
uh,

2936
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:26,401
you know,

2937
01:21:26,401 --> 01:21:27,360
Leila all leaves,

2938
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:27,660
you know,

2939
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:29,730
saying that she wants
to fight Ronda Rousey.

2940
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:34,050
I heard that little flap
a doodle about that stuff.

2941
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:34,490
Yeah.

2942
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:34,890
That's it.

2943
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:35,810
That's just because,

2944
01:21:35,811 --> 01:21:36,240
uh,

2945
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:36,541
you know,

2946
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:36,751
like,

2947
01:21:36,751 --> 01:21:37,350
what am I,

2948
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:38,000
what am I here?

2949
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:38,730
What I was was of course,

2950
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:39,810
the Great Dan Gable,

2951
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,760
like one of the greatest wrestlers,

2952
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:43,800
not just in America,

2953
01:21:43,801 --> 01:21:46,080
but the world has ever produced,

2954
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:46,950
man is a man,

2955
01:21:46,951 --> 01:21:48,030
and he went through the,

2956
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:49,920
the Munich Olympics.

2957
01:21:49,921 --> 01:21:50,701
What year was that?

2958
01:21:50,701 --> 01:21:52,620
There was like 72.

2959
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:54,300
Was it Muni Columbia?

2960
01:21:54,301 --> 01:21:54,751
Was that money?

2961
01:21:54,751 --> 01:21:59,130
Six 76 was where was in Los Angeles to 76.

2962
01:21:59,140 --> 01:21:59,973
Was that 88?

2963
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,013
I don't remember.

2964
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:02,190
It was the Munich Olympics.

2965
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:02,710
It was that,

2966
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:03,770
it was soul right.

2967
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:05,190
Where they had that tragic.

2968
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:06,440
Right,

2969
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:06,711
right,

2970
01:22:06,711 --> 01:22:06,920
right.

2971
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:07,381
But the,

2972
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:07,830
uh,

2973
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:08,663
the terrorists,

2974
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,810
but anyway,

2975
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:11,160
he walked through that tournament.

2976
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:15,150
I'm scored on how is that even
possible at the elite level,

2977
01:22:15,151 --> 01:22:17,730
not to be scored on incredible Jesus.

2978
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:18,833
It's like,

2979
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:19,853
wow,

2980
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,290
I don't think anyone's
ever done it before.

2981
01:22:22,291 --> 01:22:22,951
Since now.

2982
01:22:22,951 --> 01:22:25,860
He was an Uber dedicated
monster honoring God,

2983
01:22:25,861 --> 01:22:26,460
man.

2984
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:27,690
But wow.

2985
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,280
Double hip replacement.

2986
01:22:29,281 --> 01:22:30,750
I don't know whether he's
had knee replacement,

2987
01:22:30,751 --> 01:22:32,430
but I saw a video of the poor guy,

2988
01:22:32,431 --> 01:22:33,210
man.

2989
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:33,481
I mean,

2990
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:34,314
I,

2991
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:35,640
I suppose if you'd ask him,

2992
01:22:35,641 --> 01:22:36,350
was it worth it?

2993
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:36,901
He'd probably say,

2994
01:22:36,901 --> 01:22:37,530
hell yeah,

2995
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:38,341
you mount the Cory.

2996
01:22:38,341 --> 01:22:39,720
But I,

2997
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:40,860
his mind is fine.

2998
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:45,050
It just looks like he's in such
utter pain the way shuffles and,

2999
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,320
and move it around.

3000
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:51,620
He just beat himself to death basically
with those crazy marathon training.

3001
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:55,740
And that's one of the problems
with the other young guys.

3002
01:22:55,741 --> 01:22:58,200
He was the role model for a
lot of us young guys coming up.

3003
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:00,030
And you know,

3004
01:23:00,031 --> 01:23:01,020
that that approach,

3005
01:23:01,021 --> 01:23:02,970
that kamikaze approach to training,

3006
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,770
it really ages the body.

3007
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:05,261
Yeah,

3008
01:23:05,261 --> 01:23:05,861
it really does.

3009
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:07,030
When you're in your 20s,

3010
01:23:07,031 --> 01:23:09,190
you're not seeing the big picture man.

3011
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:09,851
You know,

3012
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:11,290
you gotta live with that body for,

3013
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:11,770
you know,

3014
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:15,160
a good number of years after you
hang up your wrestling shoes.

3015
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:16,091
Yeah.

3016
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:17,800
And I think what you said,

3017
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:18,760
like if you asked him,

3018
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:21,190
he probably would say it
was worth it because he,

3019
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,020
you can't take away history.

3020
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:23,201
I mean,

3021
01:23:23,201 --> 01:23:27,300
that guy has amazing memories of being
one of the greatest wrestlers ever.

3022
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:29,470
But his mind is okay,

3023
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:29,891
at least.

3024
01:23:29,891 --> 01:23:30,071
Yeah.

3025
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:31,570
He's a very intelligent guy,

3026
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:35,440
but it doesn't have dementia or
anything that you've sent in wrestling.

3027
01:23:35,441 --> 01:23:36,274
You're not taking that,

3028
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:36,650
uh,

3029
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:37,031
the,

3030
01:23:37,031 --> 01:23:37,151
uh,

3031
01:23:37,151 --> 01:23:38,020
the brain trauma.

3032
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:38,830
Yeah.

3033
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:41,770
Mark Coleman first ever
UFC heavyweight champion.

3034
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,500
His body is starting to fail him.

3035
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:48,540
He had one hip replacement and
apparently they have to replace it again.

3036
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:51,250
He had a massive infection when they
went in to look at it and he's in the

3037
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:53,380
hospital now and there's a go fund me.

3038
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:53,930
Uh,

3039
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:54,280
I'll,

3040
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:58,240
I'll retweet the link later today after
this podcast is all are for folks who

3041
01:23:58,241 --> 01:23:59,320
want to help out mark.

3042
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:00,041
But,

3043
01:24:00,041 --> 01:24:00,370
uh,

3044
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:00,971
he,

3045
01:24:00,971 --> 01:24:01,804
um,

3046
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:02,410
you know,

3047
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:02,740
his,

3048
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:06,070
his body is just all banged up
from the years of wrestling,

3049
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:07,330
high level wrestler.

3050
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:11,470
And then from there all the
years of competing in MMA,

3051
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:11,861
he's,

3052
01:24:11,861 --> 01:24:13,300
he's getting his hip replaced.

3053
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,060
Two is I believe both of
them need to be replaced.

3054
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:20,080
So that brings us back then full
circle to where we started with the,

3055
01:24:20,081 --> 01:24:20,410
uh,

3056
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:20,681
you know,

3057
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:21,514
just to,

3058
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:22,900
for a lifetime.

3059
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:26,500
I really do believe there is a way that
you can train and have a lot of fun with

3060
01:24:26,501 --> 01:24:27,334
this stuff,

3061
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:29,590
but you got to keep it really light.

3062
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:29,831
You know,

3063
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:30,430
like the,

3064
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:30,791
like,

3065
01:24:30,791 --> 01:24:31,520
uh,

3066
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:32,110
the,

3067
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:34,330
the grandson's Abelia Gracie,

3068
01:24:34,331 --> 01:24:35,410
keep it playful,

3069
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:36,580
keep it fun,

3070
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:39,490
don't be so concerned about points.

3071
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:39,791
I mean,

3072
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:43,320
some guys will bleed from the
eyes not to have the guard pass.

3073
01:24:43,321 --> 01:24:43,661
It's like,

3074
01:24:43,661 --> 01:24:44,110
dude,

3075
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:45,790
it's not even a tournament.

3076
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:48,280
And you're getting cranked
up in your neck and,

3077
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:48,820
and,

3078
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:49,061
and,

3079
01:24:49,061 --> 01:24:49,391
and,

3080
01:24:49,391 --> 01:24:52,360
and you're taking all this abuse for what?

3081
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,040
Right.

3082
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,210
But you got to be passed
and then work on reclaiming,

3083
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:58,600
reclaiming guard and just
get good at the fence.

3084
01:24:58,601 --> 01:24:59,350
Like A,

3085
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:00,820
like a Master Leo,

3086
01:25:00,821 --> 01:25:01,190
you know,

3087
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:03,060
he was a master at defense man.

3088
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:04,510
He couldn't do anything to the old man.

3089
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:06,670
And that's one of the things
in Hixson always preaches.

3090
01:25:06,671 --> 01:25:08,560
Like defense is the most important thing.

3091
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:09,970
Most important thing is defense.

3092
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:10,780
Be Safe,

3093
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:12,170
basically safe and,

3094
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:16,810
and I think he can extend your grappling
career wound to advanced stage.

3095
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:18,940
I think of all the martial arts,

3096
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:23,380
you can pretty much do
Jujitsu and submission.

3097
01:25:23,381 --> 01:25:24,220
Wrestling if you're,

3098
01:25:24,221 --> 01:25:25,054
if you're smart,

3099
01:25:25,570 --> 01:25:26,890
well under advanced age,

3100
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:28,840
unlike a lot of other things.

3101
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:29,021
Well,

3102
01:25:29,021 --> 01:25:32,350
it's ironic that you say that because
Hixon himself is very banged up,

3103
01:25:32,351 --> 01:25:33,820
like really badly banged up.

3104
01:25:33,821 --> 01:25:35,500
He has eight herniated discs.

3105
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:36,221
His,

3106
01:25:36,221 --> 01:25:36,520
uh,

3107
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,080
he's got a lot of muscle atrophy.

3108
01:25:38,081 --> 01:25:38,261
Look,

3109
01:25:38,261 --> 01:25:39,001
if you look at his body,

3110
01:25:39,001 --> 01:25:39,701
he's got a lot of,

3111
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:42,430
a lot of pain and suffering and uh,

3112
01:25:42,431 --> 01:25:45,580
he talked about it pretty openly when it
was on the podcast and then afterwards

3113
01:25:45,581 --> 01:25:46,180
we discussed it.

3114
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:46,780
I mean,

3115
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:50,300
he doesn't look physically anything
like he looked like back when he fought

3116
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:52,083
quite a specimen.

3117
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:52,601
Oh yeah,

3118
01:25:52,601 --> 01:25:52,811
man,

3119
01:25:52,811 --> 01:25:54,730
it was 200 plus pounds.

3120
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,820
Very thick muscled and just flexible.

3121
01:25:57,821 --> 01:25:59,200
And his movement was amazing,

3122
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:04,201
but all those years of getting cranked
and also constantly training constantly

3123
01:26:05,091 --> 01:26:08,510
in their car and being slammed a lot.

3124
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:09,411
Yeah,

3125
01:26:09,411 --> 01:26:10,100
that's,

3126
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:10,491
I mean,

3127
01:26:10,491 --> 01:26:15,320
you can see in some of the old videos
where he's getting smashed down to the

3128
01:26:15,321 --> 01:26:16,154
ground pretty hard.

3129
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:17,600
That Zillow fight.

3130
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:18,000
Yeah.

3131
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,450
It was basically thrown himself
backwards and the top up and,

3132
01:26:20,451 --> 01:26:21,710
but I mean that's a big heavy guy.

3133
01:26:21,711 --> 01:26:23,360
And I mean that wasn't just that.

3134
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,910
It's like you said,

3135
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:27,200
it's the training for that stuff.

3136
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:28,460
Yeah.

3137
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:32,980
It's ironic when you think about him
being one of the masters and one of the

3138
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,690
real originators of that
whole breathing system,

3139
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:35,901
you know,

3140
01:26:35,901 --> 01:26:37,550
he brought that yoga breathing,

3141
01:26:37,551 --> 01:26:39,360
that fire breathing to,

3142
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:39,740
uh,

3143
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:41,240
to the practice of Jujitsu.

3144
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:44,060
And here he's all just really banged up.

3145
01:26:44,061 --> 01:26:45,140
You really can't train anymore.

3146
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:45,411
I mean,

3147
01:26:45,411 --> 01:26:48,470
he kinda like goes over a technique
and I think maybe he does some really,

3148
01:26:48,471 --> 01:26:51,290
really light rolling with
people he knows perhaps.

3149
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:53,720
But when it happens to
everyone eventually,

3150
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:54,470
yeah.

3151
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:56,060
I'm very picky myself now.

3152
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:59,330
I'm in my sixties it's like a
Nixon's 10 years younger than you.

3153
01:26:59,380 --> 01:26:59,820
Yeah.

3154
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:00,653
Yeah.

3155
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,160
And probably the consensus all time.

3156
01:27:04,161 --> 01:27:04,700
Great.

3157
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:05,151
All time.

3158
01:27:05,151 --> 01:27:05,600
Great.

3159
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:05,841
Yeah.

3160
01:27:05,841 --> 01:27:06,800
If you ask people like,

3161
01:27:06,801 --> 01:27:08,810
who's the best Jujitsu and you know,

3162
01:27:08,811 --> 01:27:09,140
he,

3163
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,910
he's a guy that tap Mark Schultz.

3164
01:27:10,911 --> 01:27:13,140
I asked him about that on the podcast a,

3165
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,000
him and Mark Schultz,

3166
01:27:14,001 --> 01:27:17,270
like Mark Schultz had never really rolled
with the Jujitsu black belt before.

3167
01:27:17,271 --> 01:27:19,450
And he said the guy was
incredible grappler,

3168
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:23,930
incredible coppler but Hixon caught him
like in like 30 seconds with a triangle.

3169
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,640
Like you just had no idea what it was.

3170
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:26,061
You know,

3171
01:27:26,061 --> 01:27:28,610
he really didn't know what he
was doing as most wrestlers,

3172
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:31,460
especially at the time.

3173
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:35,030
Most wrestlers now I would
imagine it like six months.

3174
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:35,270
Yeah.

3175
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:35,900
Yeah.

3176
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:36,950
Well being,

3177
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:39,020
one of the things that mark was,

3178
01:27:39,021 --> 01:27:40,950
I'm disqualified for him.

3179
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,800
One of his key matches was he,

3180
01:27:42,801 --> 01:27:42,950
uh,

3181
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:46,310
got a guy in that Komora and used it to,

3182
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:46,970
uh,

3183
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:51,560
used it in a way that's illegal and
wrestling and he would use it all the time

3184
01:27:51,561 --> 01:27:52,341
like that and MMA.

3185
01:27:52,341 --> 01:27:54,200
But he locked it up and
rolled the guy within,

3186
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:55,610
just ripped his shoulder apart.

3187
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:56,480
Ouch.

3188
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,130
I think it was the guy was from Turkey.

3189
01:27:59,240 --> 01:27:59,900
Um,

3190
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:00,141
pull,

3191
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:00,891
pull up the video,

3192
01:28:00,891 --> 01:28:02,240
see Mark Schultz,

3193
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:04,220
disqualified wrestling,

3194
01:28:04,221 --> 01:28:06,050
but it's a classic,

3195
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:07,310
a double risk lock.

3196
01:28:07,311 --> 01:28:08,270
You don't catch wrestling,

3197
01:28:08,271 --> 01:28:09,104
double risk.

3198
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:14,000
And he uses it to flip the guy over and
just destroys his arm in the process.

3199
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:18,780
And he went on to learn a
lot of submission techniques.

3200
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:23,430
The guy was an absolute frightening
animal towards then resonate after he

3201
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:24,460
learned this as emissions.

3202
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:26,270
So physically strong too.

3203
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:30,830
And a lot of the early catches catch can
wrestling submissions were all part of

3204
01:28:30,831 --> 01:28:31,490
it.

3205
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:32,780
I'm reading this fascinating book.

3206
01:28:32,781 --> 01:28:34,040
Let me get the exact title here.

3207
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:34,520
Um,

3208
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:35,353
uh,

3209
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:41,560
right now one of it's the history of
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and this guy did an

3210
01:28:41,931 --> 01:28:43,050
amazing job.

3211
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:44,240
I'm putting this,

3212
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:47,030
putting this thing together.

3213
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:48,291
I don't know,

3214
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:49,124
I don't have it here.

3215
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:50,300
I think it's called a,

3216
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:52,640
so he's a thing.

3217
01:28:52,730 --> 01:28:54,830
He gets the guys trying to get a single,

3218
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:57,410
so he's got his legs in between.

3219
01:28:57,470 --> 01:28:57,950
Um,

3220
01:28:57,950 --> 01:29:00,020
he's got Schultz leg in between his legs.

3221
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,070
Schultes locks up,

3222
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:05,760
double wrist lock and drops and
rows and just destroys his arm.

3223
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:08,790
Just destroys it.

3224
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:09,820
It's really interesting.

3225
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:10,530
[inaudible] I,

3226
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:15,330
I saw Kimora on one is old black
and white pre World War II.

3227
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:19,620
Juno videos do the same exact
take down with the gate.

3228
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:20,190
Oh yeah.

3229
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:25,190
He locked up the Camorra the same exact
way and throw the guy you want me to say

3230
01:29:25,381 --> 01:29:25,950
that one more time?

3231
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:26,790
I love watching that.

3232
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:27,960
It's absolutely brutal,

3233
01:29:27,961 --> 01:29:28,201
wasn't it?

3234
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:28,500
Yeah.

3235
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,820
He was his qualify for that.

3236
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:30,420
Yeah,

3237
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:31,170
I believe so.

3238
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:34,260
I'm pretty sure once I does this crank,

3239
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:38,180
my shoulder's gone to the guy.

3240
01:29:38,181 --> 01:29:40,500
You could just see the guy
that he just collapsed.

3241
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:45,450
And I get how that's a very similar to
when a Frank Mir Brookman the Toros arm.

3242
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,220
Yes.

3243
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:46,800
Yeah.

3244
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,633
I remember that man.

3245
01:29:47,730 --> 01:29:48,390
That was like,

3246
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:52,890
they want to tap and heads got
his arm broken by Sakharova.

3247
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:53,790
Yup.

3248
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:54,061
Yeah.

3249
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:58,330
Sakuraba is almost the same
type of situation where it
was a standing Kimora and

3250
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:02,190
he was trying to throw him and I think
Hanzo resisted by straighten the arm,

3251
01:30:02,191 --> 01:30:03,990
but it was enough torque that it,

3252
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:04,720
uh,

3253
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:05,050
it,

3254
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:05,880
it popped.

3255
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,310
I believe Hanzo had his back and just got
a little relaxed because I think Kenzo

3256
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,310
was winning the fight.

3257
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:12,411
Henzel had soccer,

3258
01:30:12,411 --> 01:30:13,320
rob is back and you know,

3259
01:30:13,321 --> 01:30:13,831
soccer rob,

3260
01:30:13,831 --> 01:30:14,551
when he had his back,

3261
01:30:14,551 --> 01:30:16,770
that's when he would
lock that up and he said,

3262
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,010
uh,

3263
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:18,120
Henzel talked about it recently.

3264
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:20,640
So just really surprised at
how strong Sakharova was.

3265
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:20,791
Oh,

3266
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,020
he's a strong little dude man.

3267
01:30:22,021 --> 01:30:25,560
Cause he had been rolling in are
fighting rather with much larger guys.

3268
01:30:25,561 --> 01:30:30,140
Like he fought Conan and Sylvia and the
first UFC when he fought in Japan and

3269
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,530
was a 98 maybe.

3270
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,550
And he was,

3271
01:30:32,551 --> 01:30:32,821
you know,

3272
01:30:32,821 --> 01:30:36,720
one 90 something and Conan
is like two 50 and a,

3273
01:30:36,721 --> 01:30:37,890
he tapped him with an arm bar,

3274
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:38,461
if you remember that.

3275
01:30:38,461 --> 01:30:41,710
And it was like one of the first times
we ever saw a Brazilian jujitsu black

3276
01:30:41,711 --> 01:30:42,690
belt get tapped.

3277
01:30:42,691 --> 01:30:43,081
We were like,

3278
01:30:43,081 --> 01:30:43,914
whoa.

3279
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,910
That was the introduction
of the world to Sakharova.

3280
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:48,271
Well,

3281
01:30:48,271 --> 01:30:48,481
you know,

3282
01:30:48,481 --> 01:30:48,991
it's funny when,

3283
01:30:48,991 --> 01:30:49,824
as a kid,

3284
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:50,670
uh,

3285
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:53,760
York barbell was like the Mecca
for strange training in those days.

3286
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:55,020
And Bob Hoffman,

3287
01:30:55,021 --> 01:30:57,420
the father of American
weightlifting weight training.

3288
01:30:57,780 --> 01:31:02,780
He had the system called the heavy light
system where you would use heavyweights

3289
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:06,570
one during one session and
then lighter weights the next.

3290
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:08,340
But the letter wastes weren't that light.

3291
01:31:08,370 --> 01:31:09,270
They just felt bike.

3292
01:31:09,271 --> 01:31:13,020
Cause you had used heavyweights before
and sometimes even in the same session,

3293
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:17,670
you would hold a really heavyweight and
then when you go to your normal weight,

3294
01:31:17,671 --> 01:31:19,350
it felt ridiculously light.

3295
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:19,950
Hmm.

3296
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:20,783
Right.

3297
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:22,200
I used to do that in wrestling.

3298
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:26,400
I called up my heavy light system and
I would spar with all the heavyweights,

3299
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:26,941
uh,

3300
01:31:26,941 --> 01:31:27,570
on our team,

3301
01:31:27,570 --> 01:31:28,470
all the big boys.

3302
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:30,900
And then when I went
with God in my own way,

3303
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,550
they felt like toys.

3304
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:33,330
Yeah.

3305
01:31:33,330 --> 01:31:34,020
Makes Sense.

3306
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:34,471
Yeah.

3307
01:31:34,471 --> 01:31:35,580
The heavy light system,

3308
01:31:35,581 --> 01:31:35,971
and I,

3309
01:31:35,971 --> 01:31:36,540
I've,

3310
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:40,740
I've talked to a lot of guys that had
experience wrestling with big guys,

3311
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:41,041
you know,

3312
01:31:41,041 --> 01:31:42,180
in Jujitsu and so forth.

3313
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:45,390
It does truly make guys your own weight.

3314
01:31:45,391 --> 01:31:48,120
Feel like nothing you would,

3315
01:31:48,121 --> 01:31:48,811
I would imagine so.

3316
01:31:48,811 --> 01:31:51,230
But it's also like really
bad on your joints.

3317
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:51,961
You gotta be careful,

3318
01:31:51,961 --> 01:31:52,171
man.

3319
01:31:52,171 --> 01:31:53,130
You got to really,

3320
01:31:53,131 --> 01:31:53,551
really,

3321
01:31:53,551 --> 01:31:54,301
really be careful.

3322
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:54,490
This.

3323
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:56,220
That's a young man's technique.

3324
01:31:56,221 --> 01:31:57,054
It's,

3325
01:31:57,570 --> 01:31:59,880
I would not use the heavy
light system myself,

3326
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:00,490
man.

3327
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:05,100
Have you ever seen that video of the
really old judo master rolling with all of

3328
01:32:05,101 --> 01:32:05,934
the students?

3329
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:08,230
It's a block and black and white,

3330
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:08,800
but yeah,

3331
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:09,820
it's amazing.

3332
01:32:09,821 --> 01:32:10,700
What was that guy's name,

3333
01:32:10,701 --> 01:32:11,090
Matt?

3334
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:12,180
I don't remember Jamie's CV.

3335
01:32:12,181 --> 01:32:12,701
You could find it.

3336
01:32:12,701 --> 01:32:14,800
Old Judo master tools.

3337
01:32:14,801 --> 01:32:15,820
Young students.

3338
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:16,631
I mean he was,

3339
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:17,650
it was black and white.

3340
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:20,150
He had that floating throw the,

3341
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:20,711
what is it called?

3342
01:32:20,711 --> 01:32:22,620
The floating drop or value
dropped throughout man.

3343
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:24,370
He was just like tossing these guys.

3344
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:25,090
Yeah.

3345
01:32:25,090 --> 01:32:26,260
And you could tell,

3346
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:26,591
I mean,

3347
01:32:26,591 --> 01:32:29,650
this was not like some sort
of a kung food demonstration.

3348
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:30,970
I that was like real,

3349
01:32:30,971 --> 01:32:31,511
this is it.

3350
01:32:31,511 --> 01:32:31,751
Yeah.

3351
01:32:31,751 --> 01:32:32,381
This is the guy,

3352
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:33,620
this old dude guys,

3353
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:36,640
good jammies on the ball to me.

3354
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:37,720
But for me,

3355
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:38,110
I mean,

3356
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:39,130
how old was he?

3357
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:39,431
I mean,

3358
01:32:39,431 --> 01:32:41,440
I believe he was in his
sixties at the time.

3359
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:42,820
Does it say it in the,

3360
01:32:42,821 --> 01:32:43,200
uh,

3361
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,370
the description of a Jamie,

3362
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:46,610
see what it says it in that?

3363
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:48,183
No.

3364
01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:49,771
Well,

3365
01:32:49,771 --> 01:32:50,790
he's no spring chicken.

3366
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:51,451
Yeah,

3367
01:32:51,451 --> 01:32:52,890
I believe he was in his sixties.

3368
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:53,281
I mean,

3369
01:32:53,281 --> 01:32:54,031
he's got all his,

3370
01:32:54,031 --> 01:32:54,781
all gray hair,

3371
01:32:54,781 --> 01:32:56,870
but look how relaxed so relaxed,

3372
01:32:56,930 --> 01:32:57,751
so frail.

3373
01:32:57,751 --> 01:32:58,441
That wasn't judo.

3374
01:32:58,441 --> 01:32:59,010
Beautiful.

3375
01:32:59,010 --> 01:32:59,191
Yeah.

3376
01:32:59,191 --> 01:33:00,001
Look how he moves,

3377
01:33:00,001 --> 01:33:00,600
but look,

3378
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:01,770
look how beautiful he say,

3379
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:04,650
how he checks in with the
hip and he's a little guy.

3380
01:33:04,651 --> 01:33:05,610
This guy's huge,

3381
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:07,470
big difference in size.

3382
01:33:07,471 --> 01:33:12,471
Like maybe like 30 or 40% at least we
look at that kind of go on with it.

3383
01:33:12,691 --> 01:33:15,400
He checks him with the hippie just
as enough to have to get throng.

3384
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:15,780
I mean,

3385
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:16,950
it looks like they're dancing.

3386
01:33:16,951 --> 01:33:17,820
It's amazing.

3387
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:18,750
It's a beautiful thing,

3388
01:33:18,751 --> 01:33:19,040
man.

3389
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,400
Every time this guy tries to me,

3390
01:33:20,401 --> 01:33:20,760
they're all,

3391
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:21,820
they're all wearing wipe out.

3392
01:33:21,821 --> 01:33:22,710
So that's was kind of cool.

3393
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:23,360
Yeah,

3394
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:23,610
right.

3395
01:33:23,610 --> 01:33:24,030
No,

3396
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:24,990
there were no belts.

3397
01:33:24,991 --> 01:33:25,351
That was,

3398
01:33:25,351 --> 01:33:27,420
so that was even before there were belt.

3399
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:28,650
Is that the case?

3400
01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:29,281
Look at that.

3401
01:33:29,281 --> 01:33:30,114
Boom.

3402
01:33:30,290 --> 01:33:30,961
It was like,

3403
01:33:30,961 --> 01:33:31,140
well,

3404
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:32,250
during the 60s or whatever,

3405
01:33:32,251 --> 01:33:34,260
they started coming up
with the whole belt system.

3406
01:33:34,410 --> 01:33:36,570
Really during the 60s it was really late.

3407
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:37,261
It was late in the,

3408
01:33:37,261 --> 01:33:37,520
no,

3409
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:37,921
Kybella.

3410
01:33:37,921 --> 01:33:38,250
Yeah.

3411
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,031
So judo,

3412
01:33:39,031 --> 01:33:40,390
all he told me that,

3413
01:33:40,391 --> 01:33:42,240
and in Brazilian Jujitsu
that there was one belt,

3414
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:43,140
Eh,

3415
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:44,460
when you became a,

3416
01:33:44,461 --> 01:33:46,170
after you've trained for five years,

3417
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:50,940
you put on a blue belt and that
signify to the senior student.

3418
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,280
Really one belt.

3419
01:33:53,310 --> 01:33:54,230
But we one belt that's,

3420
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:55,320
and then when the judo,

3421
01:33:55,321 --> 01:33:56,090
uh,

3422
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:56,600
uh,

3423
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,850
started with their belts that she
was Jitsu also around the same time.

3424
01:33:59,851 --> 01:34:02,190
So when did the black belt get introduced?

3425
01:34:02,191 --> 01:34:04,470
And that was when the color
belts were introduced.

3426
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:05,880
I believe it was during the 60s.

3427
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,700
I end up pre world war two.

3428
01:34:08,701 --> 01:34:09,534
There were no belts.

3429
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:10,590
Look how beautiful,

3430
01:34:10,650 --> 01:34:11,840
effortless that throw us,

3431
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:12,630
this gorgeous,

3432
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:13,463
effortless,

3433
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:15,780
this old frail guy,

3434
01:34:15,781 --> 01:34:17,370
just using perfect technique.

3435
01:34:17,371 --> 01:34:18,600
Just so much knowledge,

3436
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:19,330
so much.

3437
01:34:19,330 --> 01:34:19,890
Now look at that.

3438
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:21,210
Look how beautiful that is.

3439
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:24,590
The guy tries to do to him when he did
to him and this kid has going for it.

3440
01:34:24,970 --> 01:34:25,350
I mean,

3441
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:26,250
he's shown respect,

3442
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:27,031
but he's,

3443
01:34:27,031 --> 01:34:28,020
he's trying to throw the,

3444
01:34:28,021 --> 01:34:28,441
Oh man,

3445
01:34:28,441 --> 01:34:29,540
there's no doubt that he was.

3446
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:30,510
Yeah,

3447
01:34:30,510 --> 01:34:32,320
he just knows what he's,

3448
01:34:32,321 --> 01:34:32,611
he's,

3449
01:34:32,611 --> 01:34:32,881
yeah,

3450
01:34:32,881 --> 01:34:33,481
he's not,

3451
01:34:33,481 --> 01:34:33,750
um,

3452
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:35,280
he's not trying to bully him.

3453
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:36,630
He's trying to use technique.

3454
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:37,710
But it look at that.

3455
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:38,730
Oh my goodness.

3456
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:40,953
It's amazing.

3457
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:44,110
I just love watching that.

3458
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:44,770
I love,

3459
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:45,610
love watching that.

3460
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:46,120
And there's,

3461
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:50,710
there's really a difference in this in
comparison to striking arts because you

3462
01:34:50,711 --> 01:34:51,520
know,

3463
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,940
if these guys were kickboxing
after a few leg kicks,

3464
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:57,830
well as long as you know
how to do break falls,

3465
01:34:57,860 --> 01:34:58,280
you

3466
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:58,880
can,

3467
01:34:58,880 --> 01:34:59,481
Oh God,

3468
01:34:59,481 --> 01:35:00,140
that's so beautiful.

3469
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:00,890
Yeah.

3470
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:01,221
But,

3471
01:35:01,221 --> 01:35:02,000
uh,

3472
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,211
yeah,

3473
01:35:02,211 --> 01:35:02,750
there's no,

3474
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:03,051
yeah,

3475
01:35:03,051 --> 01:35:03,440
I mean,

3476
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:07,940
I find that with the grappling arts
you can pretty much keep going for much

3477
01:35:07,941 --> 01:35:08,720
older.

3478
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:11,120
You certainly much older
than sparring with striking.

3479
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:11,931
But you know,

3480
01:35:11,931 --> 01:35:12,970
it's a a sounding,

3481
01:35:12,971 --> 01:35:15,840
but this book I'm reading about the
history of Brazilian Jujitsu and uh,

3482
01:35:15,841 --> 01:35:17,660
they were talking about like the Japanese,

3483
01:35:17,661 --> 01:35:19,130
when they first came to America,

3484
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:21,560
it was the first clash of cultures.

3485
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:23,210
The judo man,

3486
01:35:23,211 --> 01:35:26,480
we're finding that they couldn't stand
up to the American catches catch can

3487
01:35:26,481 --> 01:35:27,314
wrestlers.

3488
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:28,610
The Americans were bigger,

3489
01:35:28,611 --> 01:35:29,181
stronger,

3490
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:30,014
faster,

3491
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:31,093
heavy.

3492
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:33,440
They couldn't take them down
with a lot of this throws,

3493
01:35:33,441 --> 01:35:35,600
a lot of the wrestlers
won't wear the jackets.

3494
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:40,160
That's where the guard
really became developed,

3495
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:43,310
really found that if they
could pull them into the guard,

3496
01:35:43,311 --> 01:35:46,040
they can dispatch them
with farmlogs triangles.

3497
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:50,000
Sometimes he insisted that the wrestlers
wear the jackets in these fights like,

3498
01:35:50,130 --> 01:35:50,840
uh,

3499
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:51,673
like my Ada.

3500
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,500
And then of course they could set
the choke pretty easy on these guys.

3501
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:56,590
Very fascinating book.

3502
01:35:56,591 --> 01:35:56,781
It's,

3503
01:35:56,781 --> 01:35:57,381
it's really fun.

3504
01:35:57,381 --> 01:35:59,400
I bought it off Amazon
and have it on my kindle.

3505
01:35:59,410 --> 01:36:00,800
I'm halfway through it right now.

3506
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:05,180
I'm just to the point now where my
Ada starts teaching Carlos Gracie why?

3507
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:08,570
But the history of the sport
is absolutely fascinating.

3508
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:10,183
That's incredible.

3509
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:13,010
Have you been paying attention
at all to Metamorris?

3510
01:36:13,370 --> 01:36:13,970
Oh yeah.

3511
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:14,360
Well,

3512
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,080
my son Zach,

3513
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:17,840
that was a tough match for him.

3514
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:19,710
He doesn't do no,

3515
01:36:19,711 --> 01:36:20,300
Gee,

3516
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:21,470
that's not his game at all.

3517
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:22,590
He's always only doing it.

3518
01:36:22,591 --> 01:36:22,781
Yeah.

3519
01:36:22,781 --> 01:36:23,000
Yeah.

3520
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:23,660
And I said,

3521
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:24,231
Holy Shit.

3522
01:36:24,231 --> 01:36:26,900
For your first professional
blackbelt match,

3523
01:36:26,901 --> 01:36:27,171
Gary,

3524
01:36:27,171 --> 01:36:28,004
Tony,

3525
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:30,560
could you expect like a hardware guy?

3526
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:30,950
Yeah,

3527
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:32,360
Gary Tournament's coming on this week.

3528
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,333
I really,

3529
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:34,880
I really questioned,

3530
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:35,600
you know,

3531
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:36,050
like,

3532
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:36,681
wow,

3533
01:36:36,681 --> 01:36:37,400
that's,

3534
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:37,881
he just said,

3535
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:38,001
hey,

3536
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:38,630
you know what?

3537
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:40,850
I just wanted a challenge that's
just really want to fight.

3538
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:43,160
That was the top guy and Gary,

3539
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:43,760
Tony,

3540
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:46,010
anytime you talk about
Nogi submission wrestling,

3541
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:49,040
that names up there with the bass man,

3542
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:50,460
did you see his match with Kroll?

3543
01:36:50,461 --> 01:36:51,231
Oh my God.

3544
01:36:51,231 --> 01:36:51,741
Amazing.

3545
01:36:51,741 --> 01:36:53,360
I don't even know how
calm pulled that out man.

3546
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:56,660
He's a man as you serious crime but yeah,

3547
01:36:56,661 --> 01:36:58,850
it's like so yeah,

3548
01:36:59,270 --> 01:37:03,710
so I'm metamorris had dean
lister versus Josh Barnett.

3549
01:37:03,950 --> 01:37:06,560
Josh Barnett of course
representing catch wrestling.

3550
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:11,800
Josh Barnett even came out like an old
catch wrestling bikini bode shorts,

3551
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:13,310
the shoes,

3552
01:37:13,311 --> 01:37:17,920
the shoes and tapped dean lister
with a headlock with that,

3553
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:20,810
that judo headlock from from side control.

3554
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:21,740
All you guys out there,

3555
01:37:21,741 --> 01:37:23,240
you blue belt and purple bots.

3556
01:37:23,241 --> 01:37:26,030
Don't forget to practice
your headlock escape man.

3557
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:27,381
Because you know,

3558
01:37:27,381 --> 01:37:28,460
and Jiu Jitsu training,

3559
01:37:28,461 --> 01:37:29,820
no one uses the head lockers.

3560
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:32,060
It's usually pretty easy to escape from.

3561
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:32,601
Also,

3562
01:37:32,601 --> 01:37:33,890
you give up your back kind of.

3563
01:37:33,891 --> 01:37:34,460
Exactly.

3564
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:37,220
When you get out of a headlock you
were in a pretty crappy position.

3565
01:37:37,221 --> 01:37:38,030
Right?

3566
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:40,100
But if you don't practice it,

3567
01:37:40,101 --> 01:37:40,431
man,

3568
01:37:40,431 --> 01:37:41,570
you can see what happens.

3569
01:37:41,571 --> 01:37:46,571
I mean you get a high level athlete like
Josh Barnett who is ridiculously strong

3570
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:50,750
and he slaps it on you by surprise.

3571
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:55,530
Even a professional like dean and I mean
Dean probably knows a hundred escapes

3572
01:37:55,531 --> 01:37:56,364
from a headlock,

3573
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:57,061
but man,

3574
01:37:57,061 --> 01:37:59,280
he had caught by surprise
get locked up in that thing,

3575
01:37:59,281 --> 01:37:59,970
man.

3576
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:00,241
You know,

3577
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:01,260
that same position.

3578
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:04,890
I was actually giving a seminar for
the United States secret service.

3579
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:06,120
I used to go down,

3580
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:09,330
they were just a 90
minute drive from my gym,

3581
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:10,433
Philadelphia.

3582
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:12,420
And I uh,

3583
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:16,440
I got to know some of these guys through
Pavel and I used to go down and give a

3584
01:38:16,470 --> 01:38:20,430
self defense seminars as well as
conditioning and Ken about seminars.

3585
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,290
So one of the guys was an ex wrestler
who got me in that position that Josh got

3586
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:26,100
dean.

3587
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:27,210
I made a big mistake,

3588
01:38:27,211 --> 01:38:27,840
man.

3589
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:28,381
The guy says,

3590
01:38:28,381 --> 01:38:29,970
well how do you get out of this position?

3591
01:38:29,971 --> 01:38:30,720
You know?

3592
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,790
And so I lay down and I'll
leave them do it to me,

3593
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:38,180
but the Saturday gun crank me with it and
pop both of my ribs and I was crippled

3594
01:38:39,511 --> 01:38:40,344
for eight weeks.

3595
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:41,130
Wow.

3596
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:41,431
Yeah,

3597
01:38:41,431 --> 01:38:43,170
it was pretty jerk thing to do.

3598
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:43,681
Of course,

3599
01:38:43,681 --> 01:38:44,320
you know,

3600
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,980
he would typically a typical
herky jerky type of wrestler.

3601
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:48,840
I was one of those guys
myself at one time,

3602
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:52,290
but I just realized how
dangerous that position is.

3603
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:56,470
That's how Mark Coleman beat Dan Severen
to when the first ever UFC heavyweight

3604
01:38:56,471 --> 01:38:57,880
title at same exact position.

3605
01:38:57,950 --> 01:38:58,620
And I'll tell you,

3606
01:38:58,620 --> 01:38:58,881
man,

3607
01:38:58,881 --> 01:38:59,960
it is a power move,

3608
01:38:59,961 --> 01:39:00,794
but man,

3609
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:02,480
if a guy knows how to do it right,

3610
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:04,400
it freezes your diaphragm.

3611
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:06,290
It can dislocate your ribs,

3612
01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:08,630
it can even cause some spinal damage.

3613
01:39:09,010 --> 01:39:13,070
It's just horrible to be caught in it
and you go into an immediate panic.

3614
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:14,091
But uh,

3615
01:39:14,091 --> 01:39:14,511
yeah,

3616
01:39:14,511 --> 01:39:15,890
you can really get hurt with that.

3617
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:17,450
Not just NEC,

3618
01:39:17,451 --> 01:39:17,690
but

3619
01:39:17,690 --> 01:39:18,410
ribs.

3620
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:19,250
It's a power move,

3621
01:39:19,251 --> 01:39:20,480
but isn't a gating as well.

3622
01:39:20,481 --> 01:39:20,721
I mean,

3623
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:22,130
there's a technique to it,

3624
01:39:22,131 --> 01:39:25,310
but as a technique to it and you certainly
have to have some strength to pull it

3625
01:39:25,311 --> 01:39:25,730
off.

3626
01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:26,020
Yeah.

3627
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:26,910
Well if you're wrestling anymore,

3628
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:27,201
buddy,

3629
01:39:27,201 --> 01:39:28,670
you're on size or a little bit smaller.

3630
01:39:28,671 --> 01:39:29,550
And Josh,

3631
01:39:29,551 --> 01:39:30,384
his case,

3632
01:39:30,410 --> 01:39:31,490
he was bigger than dean.

3633
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:32,151
Hell,

3634
01:39:32,151 --> 01:39:32,661
why not?

3635
01:39:32,661 --> 01:39:33,100
And that

3636
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:35,100
not much bigger than Dean Dean's huge.

3637
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:35,450
Yeah.

3638
01:39:35,450 --> 01:39:36,370
Dean's a pretty big boy.

3639
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:37,810
He's really big now.

3640
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:38,620
I mean,

3641
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:42,580
he's a way thicker than when he was
fighting at two oh five in the UFC.

3642
01:39:42,581 --> 01:39:43,780
I Dunno what he's walking around on,

3643
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:47,030
but he looked to me to be like in
the two forties or two thirties,

3644
01:39:47,050 --> 01:39:47,840
at the very least.

3645
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,660
I went out it,

3646
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:48,910
yeah,

3647
01:39:48,910 --> 01:39:49,750
he's very thick.

3648
01:39:50,110 --> 01:39:50,980
But Josh,

3649
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:52,680
Josh got him in that position.

3650
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:53,411
He couldn't escape,

3651
01:39:53,411 --> 01:39:57,040
which is amazing when you consider
how much experience Dean has.

3652
01:39:57,370 --> 01:39:57,941
And uh,

3653
01:39:57,941 --> 01:40:00,600
I don't think he had been tapped
in competition over decades.

3654
01:40:00,610 --> 01:40:01,840
A hard guy to chat,

3655
01:40:01,841 --> 01:40:02,060
man.

3656
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:03,850
Oh so hard at the skill level,

3657
01:40:03,851 --> 01:40:04,684
his skillset.

3658
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:05,111
But Hey,

3659
01:40:05,111 --> 01:40:06,490
both guys are fantastic.

3660
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:07,630
And you know,

3661
01:40:07,631 --> 01:40:07,870
that's,

3662
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:08,621
that's grappling,

3663
01:40:08,621 --> 01:40:08,920
right?

3664
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:09,970
And any given day,

3665
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:13,360
I love also the different approaches that
Josh has a different approach and you

3666
01:40:13,361 --> 01:40:14,800
see that that different approach,

3667
01:40:14,801 --> 01:40:18,190
that cast wrestling approach can be just
as effective if he gets you in one of

3668
01:40:18,191 --> 01:40:19,024
those positions.

3669
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:20,070
You know,

3670
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:22,150
it might be something
you're not accustomed to,

3671
01:40:22,151 --> 01:40:23,620
so you haven't trained to get out of it.

3672
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:27,620
I remember one of the first pro,

3673
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:28,850
uh,

3674
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:29,690
grappling matches.

3675
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:30,500
It was in,

3676
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,430
maybe you remember this,

3677
01:40:31,431 --> 01:40:32,960
it was like in one of the Carolinas,

3678
01:40:32,961 --> 01:40:34,430
North Carolina or South Carolina.

3679
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:35,031
It was,

3680
01:40:35,031 --> 01:40:36,890
I think it was called
the pro am or something.

3681
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:38,390
There was a guy along goes this,

3682
01:40:38,570 --> 01:40:39,111
oh man,

3683
01:40:39,111 --> 01:40:40,940
back in the nineties maybe?

3684
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:41,803
No,

3685
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:43,490
it was real early,

3686
01:40:43,970 --> 01:40:45,200
like late nineties.

3687
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:50,730
Was this the one where frank shamrock a
wrestle Dan Henderson and they did like

3688
01:40:50,731 --> 01:40:53,140
a paper view thing and
John Perretti was the,

3689
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:54,250
it wasn't

3690
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:55,061
a paper view,

3691
01:40:55,061 --> 01:40:58,210
but they were paying
cash prizes to the guys.

3692
01:40:58,211 --> 01:41:03,211
It was like one of the early attempts to
do submission wrestling as a pro sport.

3693
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:04,150
Okay.

3694
01:41:04,150 --> 01:41:04,983
And uh,

3695
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:07,450
I remember Salo was at the house,

3696
01:41:07,451 --> 01:41:08,960
he was training solid Humira,

3697
01:41:09,010 --> 01:41:09,843
so a bear.

3698
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:13,870
And he was wrestling the supposedly
like the number one catch wrestler.

3699
01:41:13,871 --> 01:41:15,640
He was living down in
North Carolina somewhere.

3700
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:18,700
And I had seen this guy in other
tournaments and I warned him,

3701
01:41:18,701 --> 01:41:18,941
I said,

3702
01:41:18,941 --> 01:41:19,420
hey,

3703
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:23,860
this guy will give up his back
to go for that twisting tow haul.

3704
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:24,521
You know,

3705
01:41:24,521 --> 01:41:25,190
like when you go,

3706
01:41:25,190 --> 01:41:29,620
they loop over the toe hold and kind of
flip upside down and go for your foot.

3707
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:30,461
And I said,

3708
01:41:30,461 --> 01:41:31,300
the guys good with it.

3709
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:33,550
He's really good and wouldn't,

3710
01:41:33,551 --> 01:41:34,030
you know,

3711
01:41:34,030 --> 01:41:37,990
solid takes the back and the
guy does it and pops his ankle.

3712
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:40,270
But Sala won't tap.

3713
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:45,070
He said he would have died before he
tapped it as catch wrestler and then

3714
01:41:45,610 --> 01:41:46,780
because he didn't tap,

3715
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:47,340
you know,

3716
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:47,511
he,

3717
01:41:47,511 --> 01:41:49,000
he choked the guy over the face.

3718
01:41:49,001 --> 01:41:49,211
You know,

3719
01:41:49,211 --> 01:41:50,950
cause the guy was trying to hide the chin,

3720
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:52,780
basically just put the guy out man,

3721
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:57,020
and didn't mangle his ankle
but mangled the angle.

3722
01:41:57,021 --> 01:41:57,854
So he won.

3723
01:41:58,180 --> 01:41:59,020
But Oh my God,

3724
01:41:59,021 --> 01:42:01,450
that thing turned his black
is this microphone man.

3725
01:42:01,451 --> 01:42:04,330
It was like he was in
such pain that surgery.

3726
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:06,250
Now he did it and he's like,

3727
01:42:06,251 --> 01:42:06,550
man,

3728
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:06,821
I'll tell,

3729
01:42:06,821 --> 01:42:09,730
I saw as another one of those guys that
just like one of the toughest dudes I've

3730
01:42:09,731 --> 01:42:10,564
ever met,

3731
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:11,770
him and his brother to Sean's here,

3732
01:42:11,771 --> 01:42:12,730
just like so tough.

3733
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:13,751
But man,

3734
01:42:13,751 --> 01:42:15,280
he limped around and was hurt.

3735
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:17,050
I don't know where the
ankle was ever the same,

3736
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:19,420
but that's one of those deals,

3737
01:42:19,470 --> 01:42:19,870
right,

3738
01:42:19,870 --> 01:42:20,860
with the catch wrestlers.

3739
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:23,620
Gotta Watch those guys
are tricky is o hell,

3740
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,150
I see different things.

3741
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:27,280
He's the feet man.

3742
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:28,241
Yeah,

3743
01:42:28,241 --> 01:42:31,180
it's guys doing different things and
getting really good at those things.

3744
01:42:31,181 --> 01:42:31,450
That's,

3745
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:32,410
that's a big part of it.

3746
01:42:32,411 --> 01:42:35,800
It's like if a guy has a like a a
foot lock or something like that,

3747
01:42:35,801 --> 01:42:37,540
he just has down,

3748
01:42:37,541 --> 01:42:39,970
he just knows how to do it
and that becomes his thing.

3749
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:45,100
I mean some guys just have
certain positions that
you're not really well versed

3750
01:42:45,101 --> 01:42:47,590
in and they go to it over
and over and over again.

3751
01:42:47,591 --> 01:42:51,250
Like Eddie Bravo before he got
famous for doing the twister.

3752
01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:53,680
One of the things I
remember in John Jocks,

3753
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:57,160
Eddie Bravo would do a
told he was a toehold guy.

3754
01:42:57,670 --> 01:43:01,360
He and he would get told on guys all
the time because a lot of people weren't

3755
01:43:01,361 --> 01:43:04,670
good at toeholds so he would dive on
told he was always catching people

3756
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:06,550
that don't know how the defend a man.

3757
01:43:06,551 --> 01:43:07,060
Yeah,

3758
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:09,250
it's a smart move and sometimes moves.

3759
01:43:09,251 --> 01:43:10,031
They're so old,

3760
01:43:10,031 --> 01:43:10,481
they're new.

3761
01:43:10,481 --> 01:43:11,260
You know what I mean?

3762
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:14,920
Like you'll see things go in trends and
then people get good at stopping him and

3763
01:43:14,921 --> 01:43:15,910
they kind of go away.

3764
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,710
And then some older move,

3765
01:43:17,711 --> 01:43:19,660
we'll come back and you see these waves.

3766
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:20,891
It's a,

3767
01:43:20,891 --> 01:43:25,891
it's funny like I was sort of anti bear
and Bolo and some of these [inaudible]

3768
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:28,390
version techniques.

3769
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:30,420
Maybe I'm just jealous cause I,

3770
01:43:30,450 --> 01:43:30,670
you know,

3771
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:33,430
my spine a little bit too
old and stiff to do it,

3772
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:36,370
but the guys who look like they're
having a good time when they do it,

3773
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:37,181
but,

3774
01:43:37,181 --> 01:43:37,570
uh,

3775
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:38,051
I,

3776
01:43:38,051 --> 01:43:38,680
uh,

3777
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:39,910
I was talking to my son and he says,

3778
01:43:39,911 --> 01:43:40,481
well dad,

3779
01:43:40,481 --> 01:43:40,781
he says,

3780
01:43:40,781 --> 01:43:42,430
you can still got to learn that stuff.

3781
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:43,390
He says,

3782
01:43:43,390 --> 01:43:44,890
even if you don't want to use it,

3783
01:43:45,490 --> 01:43:47,080
you got to learn it to say,

3784
01:43:47,081 --> 01:43:48,220
you know how to stop it.

3785
01:43:48,850 --> 01:43:49,181
He says,

3786
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:51,650
because for sure if you don't know
what you're going to get tapped,

3787
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:53,390
you guys going to catch it.

3788
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:53,930
Right.

3789
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:56,630
So you got at least practice it a
little bit to be familiar with it.

3790
01:43:57,110 --> 01:44:02,110
And that being said is in New York City
and as a wrestling with Gianni Grippo

3791
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:03,711
and,

3792
01:44:03,711 --> 01:44:04,370
uh,

3793
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:05,320
Mr [inaudible],

3794
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:06,800
the guys so much fun.

3795
01:44:06,801 --> 01:44:07,730
He's one of more Cielo,

3796
01:44:07,731 --> 01:44:09,350
a black belts.

3797
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:14,450
This kid is so good with that and it was
really fun playing with him with that

3798
01:44:14,451 --> 01:44:14,661
thing,

3799
01:44:14,661 --> 01:44:15,170
man,

3800
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:18,950
he could just flip upside down and roll
and invert and next thing you know the

3801
01:44:18,951 --> 01:44:20,210
little suckers on your bag is like,

3802
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:21,770
how did he do that man?

3803
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:22,881
Yeah.

3804
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:27,350
It's really interesting when guys get
super sharp at one particular technique

3805
01:44:27,351 --> 01:44:29,300
and if you're not aware of
that particular technique,

3806
01:44:29,570 --> 01:44:31,100
it could become really dangerous.

3807
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:31,761
You know?

3808
01:44:31,761 --> 01:44:32,594
Um,

3809
01:44:32,630 --> 01:44:36,950
Braulio a steamer is famous for having
that very bizarre guard as well,

3810
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:41,870
where he'll do those reverse triangles
or inverted triangles and he gets himself

3811
01:44:41,871 --> 01:44:45,110
into a position where for to the
outside observer it looks like,

3812
01:44:45,111 --> 01:44:45,351
wow,

3813
01:44:45,351 --> 01:44:48,770
this guy is on his neck here
and it's weird position.

3814
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:51,460
And then all of a sudden he's got a
triangle on the guy and he's like,

3815
01:44:51,461 --> 01:44:52,101
what happened?

3816
01:44:52,101 --> 01:44:54,560
People just so good at that position.

3817
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:56,450
He's good at all positions,

3818
01:44:56,660 --> 01:44:57,493
positions.

3819
01:44:57,590 --> 01:45:00,950
That one position he's been particularly
successful at because it's such an

3820
01:45:00,951 --> 01:45:02,270
unusual thing to defend.

3821
01:45:02,271 --> 01:45:05,000
Very few people are that scary with it.

3822
01:45:05,410 --> 01:45:09,050
And it's like some people like
criticize certain techniques,

3823
01:45:09,051 --> 01:45:09,320
they go,

3824
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:09,711
ah,

3825
01:45:09,711 --> 01:45:09,981
you know,

3826
01:45:09,981 --> 01:45:10,701
I played around with that,

3827
01:45:10,701 --> 01:45:11,900
but that doesn't work well.

3828
01:45:11,901 --> 01:45:12,201
Okay,

3829
01:45:12,201 --> 01:45:13,160
really well.

3830
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:15,440
What about like head kicks?

3831
01:45:15,441 --> 01:45:16,580
Did you play around with a headcase?

3832
01:45:16,630 --> 01:45:18,100
And he'd say they don't
work because you know,

3833
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:21,770
many times you have to drill a
head kick to get it effective,

3834
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:25,520
but then you get it up to like a point
where like an Anthony Pettis has it or an

3835
01:45:25,521 --> 01:45:30,410
Anderson Silva has it and it becomes a
real dangerous weapon in your arsenal.

3836
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:30,921
Cro,

3837
01:45:30,921 --> 01:45:31,191
cop,

3838
01:45:31,191 --> 01:45:32,024
perfect example,

3839
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:32,511
cro,

3840
01:45:32,511 --> 01:45:35,900
cop drilled that damn head kicked to the
point where he could throw it out like

3841
01:45:35,901 --> 01:45:37,610
another guy could throw a straight punch.

3842
01:45:37,610 --> 01:45:39,410
It's a standard straight punch.

3843
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:42,920
That's how good and fast his
head kick was and still is.

3844
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:44,810
And when you,

3845
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:48,440
you discount a technique simply because
you don't have the proficiency in it,

3846
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:49,660
you could really,

3847
01:45:49,730 --> 01:45:51,870
really get caught because you,

3848
01:45:51,871 --> 01:45:55,940
you really can sort of define the
world and an inaccurate light.

3849
01:45:56,150 --> 01:46:00,500
And then you see a guy like maybe this
bear and Polo Guy or Eddie Bravo with his

3850
01:46:00,501 --> 01:46:01,334
twister,

3851
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:02,571
or you know,

3852
01:46:02,571 --> 01:46:04,690
there's a million different
techniques that you're,

3853
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,590
you're starting to see emerge in MMA.

3854
01:46:06,591 --> 01:46:07,580
That guy's a discarded,

3855
01:46:07,581 --> 01:46:08,840
like the front kick to the face.

3856
01:46:09,110 --> 01:46:10,820
Nobody was worried about
the front kick to the face,

3857
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:11,480
nobody.

3858
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:14,570
And then all of a sudden Anderson
acts out Vituro like when you're like,

3859
01:46:14,571 --> 01:46:15,540
holy Jesus,

3860
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:17,450
no one ever expected,

3861
01:46:17,451 --> 01:46:19,010
but say this is the thing.

3862
01:46:19,011 --> 01:46:20,600
I mean he can't learn everything for sure.

3863
01:46:20,630 --> 01:46:20,871
You know,

3864
01:46:20,871 --> 01:46:22,370
you got to have your certain arsenal,

3865
01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:27,790
but it certainly pays to be familiar with
these positions and at least learn the

3866
01:46:27,801 --> 01:46:30,740
rudimentary basics so you understand it,

3867
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:31,603
what it is,

3868
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:36,560
you can recognize it because recognition
is the first step to protect yourself

3869
01:46:36,561 --> 01:46:37,394
against this stuff.

3870
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:39,830
So even if you never want to use it,

3871
01:46:40,070 --> 01:46:40,400
it,

3872
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:44,780
it pays to at least learn it and be
familiar with it and actually learn it

3873
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:45,740
offensively.

3874
01:46:45,741 --> 01:46:47,630
There's a mistake that exact do,

3875
01:46:47,631 --> 01:46:50,490
especially wrestlers that
are learning Jujitsu,

3876
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:52,860
they decide water's
going to learn defense.

3877
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:54,510
I'm just going to learn Jujitsu defense.

3878
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:57,780
You will never learn correct.

3879
01:46:57,781 --> 01:46:59,370
Jujitsu defense and less.

3880
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:00,930
You learn Jujitsu offense.

3881
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:03,600
If you don't know how to cinch up a choke.

3882
01:47:03,601 --> 01:47:05,340
If you don't know how
to cinch up an arm bar,

3883
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:09,570
you're never going to know exactly
what you can get away with when you're

3884
01:47:09,571 --> 01:47:10,404
defending.

3885
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:11,580
And once you,

3886
01:47:11,581 --> 01:47:14,070
once you get adapt at or offense,

3887
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:17,670
then you'll truly understand defense
cause you'll understand what would I would

3888
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:20,970
be trying to do to me if I was in this
position and how do I stop this guy from

3889
01:47:20,971 --> 01:47:21,750
doing that?

3890
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:22,950
All those little details.

3891
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,420
It's like so,

3892
01:47:24,450 --> 01:47:25,410
so important.

3893
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:25,830
Well,

3894
01:47:25,830 --> 01:47:29,190
so that's one of the most beautiful
things about Jujitsu is there's so many

3895
01:47:29,191 --> 01:47:29,761
techniques.

3896
01:47:29,761 --> 01:47:30,594
It's almost like,

3897
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:30,900
you know,

3898
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:31,710
you seem never ending.

3899
01:47:31,710 --> 01:47:32,101
Yeah.

3900
01:47:32,101 --> 01:47:35,880
And you see certain guys who have a very
small wheelhouse of techniques if they

3901
01:47:35,881 --> 01:47:36,660
utilize,

3902
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:40,260
especially like attacks like Marcella
Garcia was of course one of the best of

3903
01:47:40,261 --> 01:47:41,040
all time.

3904
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:41,880
But he has a very,

3905
01:47:41,881 --> 01:47:42,840
if you look at his,

3906
01:47:42,841 --> 01:47:47,250
if you took all of his Jujitsu matches
that he's won and look at how he won

3907
01:47:47,251 --> 01:47:47,670
them,

3908
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:50,370
it's a very small number
of chokes that he's used.

3909
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:51,840
I mean it's almost all,

3910
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:53,250
I mean I think Ricoh Rodriguez,

3911
01:47:53,251 --> 01:47:54,630
I think he got in with a leg lock.

3912
01:47:54,950 --> 01:47:55,380
Um,

3913
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:56,250
most guys,

3914
01:47:56,251 --> 01:47:59,580
he got Jake shields with
a wrist lock I believe,

3915
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:01,080
and one of those,

3916
01:48:01,081 --> 01:48:01,490
uh,

3917
01:48:01,490 --> 01:48:02,990
and I remember Rico Chaparral,

3918
01:48:02,991 --> 01:48:07,991
he had a professional Jujitsu tournament
thing that he was doing in Los Angeles.

3919
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:13,280
Shakuri competed against Randy coture and
Marcello competed against Jake shields

3920
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:16,050
and I believe he got Jake and Arice lock,

3921
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:16,711
which is,

3922
01:48:16,711 --> 01:48:16,891
you know,

3923
01:48:16,891 --> 01:48:18,570
he's got some crafty shit in there.

3924
01:48:18,620 --> 01:48:19,453
It really crafty,

3925
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:20,580
but most of it,

3926
01:48:20,750 --> 01:48:21,750
Dia Tienes,

3927
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:22,680
north south choke,

3928
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:23,550
rear naked choke.

3929
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:24,660
It's almost all next,

3930
01:48:25,050 --> 01:48:27,030
almost at all attacking the next,

3931
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:27,850
it's,

3932
01:48:27,850 --> 01:48:28,683
it's a,

3933
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:30,810
Jujitsu is such a complex sport.

3934
01:48:30,811 --> 01:48:31,050
It,

3935
01:48:31,050 --> 01:48:32,400
I liken it to a,

3936
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:33,650
like a,

3937
01:48:33,650 --> 01:48:35,550
I like him wrestling and
being a former restaurant,

3938
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:39,960
more like checkers and Jujitsu to chess,

3939
01:48:39,961 --> 01:48:41,400
but not just chest,

3940
01:48:41,401 --> 01:48:42,600
three dimensional chess.

3941
01:48:43,110 --> 01:48:44,880
It really is maybe submission.

3942
01:48:44,881 --> 01:48:48,900
Wrestling would be more like regular
chest and then re Jujitsu with the gate

3943
01:48:48,901 --> 01:48:51,810
with all the different ways
you can manipulate the cloth.

3944
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:53,940
Almost like three dimensional chess.

3945
01:48:53,941 --> 01:48:57,030
It's just such a huge variety of,

3946
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:57,840
of stuff.

3947
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:58,111
Yeah.

3948
01:48:58,111 --> 01:49:00,150
The only problem I have
with the ghee is a,

3949
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:03,650
I think a lot of people get brainwashed
into thinking that you need to learn to

3950
01:49:03,651 --> 01:49:05,430
g to be good at Jujitsu and MMA.

3951
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:09,780
And Eddie Bravo in particular is very
adamant that that is a ridiculous idea.

3952
01:49:10,030 --> 01:49:10,381
He's like,

3953
01:49:10,381 --> 01:49:12,870
that's like saying you have to be
really good at racquetball to be good at

3954
01:49:12,871 --> 01:49:13,440
tennis.

3955
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:13,681
Yeah.

3956
01:49:13,681 --> 01:49:16,950
It's two different sports all
together was just so much to grip.

3957
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:20,820
And you see so many guys that are world
champions or the competed a very high

3958
01:49:20,821 --> 01:49:25,260
level with the g and then they fight an
MMA and everyone's sweaty and they have

3959
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:28,710
gloves on and they can't
grab things and they,

3960
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:30,540
they say specific man,

3961
01:49:30,541 --> 01:49:34,200
you have to develop the specific skills
towards your fighting conditions.

3962
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:35,221
But,

3963
01:49:35,221 --> 01:49:35,970
uh,

3964
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:36,570
you know,

3965
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:39,540
one of the most elegant definitions
of Jujitsu I ever heard,

3966
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:40,823
and it's,

3967
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:42,510
it came from house and crazy.

3968
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,430
It was at a seminar in Atlantic city.

3969
01:49:44,431 --> 01:49:46,380
This is like one of the
early Gracie seminars.

3970
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:47,393
And uh,

3971
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:48,070
this is back

3972
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:50,800
in the day when he never knew what kind
of Wacko was going to walk in through

3973
01:49:50,801 --> 01:49:50,961
there.

3974
01:49:50,961 --> 01:49:54,830
Sometimes you'd even get people that
one of the challenge in the seminars and

3975
01:49:54,831 --> 01:49:55,970
there was this guy that came in,

3976
01:49:55,971 --> 01:49:58,900
I swear to God with flowing robes,

3977
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:01,780
like this kung fu guy
with this big red sash.

3978
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:05,170
And so w right in the
middle of the seminar,

3979
01:50:05,171 --> 01:50:05,740
he interrupts,

3980
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:06,760
well Mr Gracie,

3981
01:50:06,761 --> 01:50:07,594
sir,

3982
01:50:07,690 --> 01:50:08,523
could you,

3983
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,040
could you give me the definition
of your philosophy of Jujitsu?

3984
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:13,691
And we're like,

3985
01:50:13,691 --> 01:50:14,524
oh boy.

3986
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:17,860
Because you know Helson his
English wasn't the most,

3987
01:50:18,010 --> 01:50:19,600
it was hard to understand sometimes,

3988
01:50:19,601 --> 01:50:19,810
you know,

3989
01:50:19,810 --> 01:50:21,490
plus he mixed it with the Hawaiian Slam,

3990
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:23,500
but he says when the fight,

3991
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:25,510
when I know I can win the fight,

3992
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:27,100
I can pretty much,

3993
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:27,700
you know,

3994
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:32,200
be that nice guy and kind and loving
and all that towards other people.

3995
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:32,801
Cause you know,

3996
01:50:32,801 --> 01:50:35,060
I had that confidence with
myself that I know I can,

3997
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:36,130
I can protect myself,

3998
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:38,410
I don't have to be insecure.

3999
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:39,873
So the guy says,

4000
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:40,330
well,

4001
01:50:40,330 --> 01:50:41,800
could you expound on that?

4002
01:50:41,801 --> 01:50:43,960
And of course first we have
to explain what expound means,

4003
01:50:43,961 --> 01:50:44,710
all that.

4004
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:45,370
And we're thinking,

4005
01:50:45,370 --> 01:50:46,180
man,

4006
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:47,230
what's he going to say here?

4007
01:50:48,130 --> 01:50:49,660
And he says,

4008
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:51,573
Jiu Jitsu,

4009
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:53,650
if you do dis,

4010
01:50:54,010 --> 01:50:56,500
I do that and if you do that,

4011
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:58,540
I do this forever.

4012
01:50:59,230 --> 01:50:59,621
And we said,

4013
01:50:59,621 --> 01:51:00,670
Whoa,

4014
01:51:00,850 --> 01:51:02,710
that is some deep shit.

4015
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:04,780
It's getting a three by five cards.

4016
01:51:04,781 --> 01:51:06,880
And I actually had that in my school.

4017
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:08,740
I actually wrote that
and put it on the wall.

4018
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:09,693
If you do this,

4019
01:51:09,730 --> 01:51:10,450
I do that.

4020
01:51:10,450 --> 01:51:11,290
And if you do that,

4021
01:51:11,350 --> 01:51:13,330
I do this for ever.

4022
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:15,040
And it's like wow,

4023
01:51:15,041 --> 01:51:15,401
it does.

4024
01:51:15,401 --> 01:51:16,720
It goes into infinity man.

4025
01:51:16,810 --> 01:51:19,570
Especially when you're constantly
moving one step ahead of the guy.

4026
01:51:19,571 --> 01:51:20,404
Like if you,

4027
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:23,020
I liken it to having a conversation,

4028
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:27,310
like if you have a conversation with
someone who speaks very broken English,

4029
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:29,530
you could really kind of
talk circles around them.

4030
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:30,280
You could just,

4031
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:32,020
if you're an articulate person,

4032
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:34,570
especially of course you can
make them look really silly.

4033
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:35,021
He'd be like,

4034
01:51:35,021 --> 01:51:35,311
what?

4035
01:51:35,311 --> 01:51:36,040
What are you trying to say?

4036
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:36,761
You're trying to say nothing.

4037
01:51:36,761 --> 01:51:38,080
You don't even know how to
talk my language stupid,

4038
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:38,681
you know?

4039
01:51:38,681 --> 01:51:40,400
And you could just
literally do just rattle on,

4040
01:51:40,401 --> 01:51:40,930
attack them.

4041
01:51:40,930 --> 01:51:42,340
I think they call it soft history.

4042
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:44,740
Is Sophos a lawyer?

4043
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:45,411
Well,

4044
01:51:45,411 --> 01:51:46,360
some guys,

4045
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:47,741
you know,

4046
01:51:47,741 --> 01:51:49,150
be aggressive and rude about it,

4047
01:51:49,151 --> 01:51:53,440
but some guys can do that with Jujitsu
where you kind of have to think yourself

4048
01:51:53,441 --> 01:51:56,320
through every step and
you're not kind of aware.

4049
01:51:56,321 --> 01:51:56,531
I mean,

4050
01:51:56,531 --> 01:51:59,560
that's how I always feel when I would
roll with guys who I got a really,

4051
01:51:59,561 --> 01:52:03,250
really high level and it's like I'm
not prepared for all the steps that you

4052
01:52:03,251 --> 01:52:05,350
could take to counter my step.

4053
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:05,831
You know,

4054
01:52:05,831 --> 01:52:08,770
I will do a move and
you will do your mood,

4055
01:52:08,771 --> 01:52:10,080
but you also have all these you,

4056
01:52:10,150 --> 01:52:12,580
you were already
anticipating to counter this.

4057
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:13,361
I've got to do that.

4058
01:52:13,361 --> 01:52:16,510
So I'm going to stop this by putting my
hand on your knee here and putting my

4059
01:52:16,511 --> 01:52:20,320
foot on your hip here and now you're
going to have to try to get out of it.

4060
01:52:20,321 --> 01:52:23,170
But I'm not going to let you get out of
it because I'm already anticipating that

4061
01:52:23,171 --> 01:52:24,310
as I'm already so far.

4062
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:24,670
Yeah,

4063
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:25,441
like Hixon Gracie,

4064
01:52:25,441 --> 01:52:26,620
he always used to say about guys,

4065
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,540
he's not going to be able
to keep up the rhythm,

4066
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:30,820
not gonna be able to keep up the rhythm.

4067
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:32,120
You know that like you're going to,

4068
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:34,030
I do this and you do that.

4069
01:52:34,031 --> 01:52:34,421
I do this,

4070
01:52:34,421 --> 01:52:34,871
you do that.

4071
01:52:34,871 --> 01:52:35,230
I this.

4072
01:52:35,230 --> 01:52:36,250
How long can you keep that up?

4073
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:37,113
How long your teeth that really,

4074
01:52:37,450 --> 01:52:38,170
how long?

4075
01:52:38,170 --> 01:52:40,200
Well it Helton another go into.

4076
01:52:40,270 --> 01:52:40,550
Yeah,

4077
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:44,350
it was amazing because the guy was
pretty profound and is a very simple way.

4078
01:52:44,650 --> 01:52:45,680
The way he had explained things,

4079
01:52:45,681 --> 01:52:46,130
it was

4080
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:47,780
pretty amazing but simple.

4081
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:48,860
Roddy was complainant.

4082
01:52:49,070 --> 01:52:52,880
How easily he was catching him and says,

4083
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:54,073
look,

4084
01:52:54,110 --> 01:52:56,990
I know everything you
know and everything else.

4085
01:52:59,120 --> 01:52:59,600
Cause like,

4086
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:00,500
yeah,

4087
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:01,880
absolutely.

4088
01:53:01,881 --> 01:53:02,960
He says maybe,

4089
01:53:02,990 --> 01:53:07,990
maybe if I got sick or injured and was
in the hospital for like three years and

4090
01:53:08,241 --> 01:53:09,074
did train.

4091
01:53:09,170 --> 01:53:12,380
Maybe if I came back
you might have a chance.

4092
01:53:14,590 --> 01:53:15,330
But it's true.

4093
01:53:15,330 --> 01:53:15,941
It's true.

4094
01:53:15,941 --> 01:53:17,810
I wouldn't it be true to me the
guy's done it is what I mean.

4095
01:53:17,811 --> 01:53:19,900
Ronda Rousey born Warren under Matt.

4096
01:53:20,030 --> 01:53:20,361
Yeah.

4097
01:53:20,361 --> 01:53:23,030
Ron has been saying that
about a female opponents.

4098
01:53:23,031 --> 01:53:23,450
He's like,

4099
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:24,283
she was like,

4100
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:25,070
listen,

4101
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:28,850
what's going on now is I've been doing
this my whole life and these girls are

4102
01:53:28,851 --> 01:53:29,960
just not going to catch up to me.

4103
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:31,250
And that's what you're seeing.

4104
01:53:31,251 --> 01:53:34,580
When we saw that beautiful arm
bar that just landed on Zingano,

4105
01:53:34,790 --> 01:53:35,451
I mean it's in Ghana.

4106
01:53:35,451 --> 01:53:36,140
What tax?

4107
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:36,761
Unbelievable.

4108
01:53:36,761 --> 01:53:40,190
And it tries to throw a Rhonda
addressed winds up on top,

4109
01:53:40,191 --> 01:53:42,080
recognizes the position where the arm is.

4110
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:44,910
I mean I was talking to
George Greer Gel and uh,

4111
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:46,190
about it at the last UFC.

4112
01:53:46,191 --> 01:53:46,551
He's like,

4113
01:53:46,551 --> 01:53:49,040
that's when I bowed down to
Rhonda and that's how he said it.

4114
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:51,230
I mean George is a black
belt as well and he's like,

4115
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:51,651
you know,

4116
01:53:51,651 --> 01:53:52,880
I saw her arm bars.

4117
01:53:52,881 --> 01:53:53,151
I was like,

4118
01:53:53,151 --> 01:53:53,990
yeah she's got a good arm.

4119
01:53:53,991 --> 01:53:56,090
Bars was sometimes she does
things that I don't agree with.

4120
01:53:56,360 --> 01:53:58,790
So it looked like maybe her knees are a
little too wide apart even though she's

4121
01:53:58,791 --> 01:53:59,750
catching these girls.

4122
01:53:59,870 --> 01:54:02,450
Maybe she's catching these girls
cause they're just not that technical.

4123
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:02,871
He goes,

4124
01:54:02,871 --> 01:54:04,640
well when she hit that on barns in Ghana,

4125
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:06,100
14 seconds and he's like,

4126
01:54:06,101 --> 01:54:07,120
look I got a bow down.

4127
01:54:07,820 --> 01:54:08,750
That's some high level,

4128
01:54:08,751 --> 01:54:09,471
high level,

4129
01:54:09,471 --> 01:54:11,190
high level technique man.

4130
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:15,740
The ability to adjust and again that
language that she has in her head,

4131
01:54:15,890 --> 01:54:18,800
she's so articulate with
the language of submissions.

4132
01:54:18,850 --> 01:54:21,080
And in her case armbars you know,

4133
01:54:21,081 --> 01:54:22,210
just so good at arm bar.

4134
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:22,881
What a talent,

4135
01:54:22,881 --> 01:54:23,110
Huh?

4136
01:54:23,110 --> 01:54:25,430
It looks like she has quite
a buddy movie career as well.

4137
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:25,930
She,

4138
01:54:25,930 --> 01:54:26,731
she's not a battle.

4139
01:54:26,731 --> 01:54:31,050
Some gals beautiful aside the
swimsuit issue or whether the man,

4140
01:54:31,051 --> 01:54:34,130
she's good figure a pretty girl.

4141
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:35,353
Toughest Shit.

4142
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:36,650
So very funny.

4143
01:54:36,651 --> 01:54:37,100
Um,

4144
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:40,180
interview where this guy was
talking a little trash and she,

4145
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:41,023
Judith,

4146
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:46,250
she landed Ottoman Poker
Hardwood for oh man,

4147
01:54:46,251 --> 01:54:47,084
did she,

4148
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:49,050
she broke the guy's red.

4149
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:53,990
She judo through him and launched
herself on top off of him.

4150
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:54,620
If I'm,

4151
01:54:54,620 --> 01:54:56,750
she knew exactly what she was to too,

4152
01:54:56,751 --> 01:54:57,440
by the way.

4153
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:58,400
You all right.

4154
01:54:58,401 --> 01:54:59,240
Are you all right?

4155
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:00,350
We got an it guy.

4156
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:02,060
You don't trash talk to?

4157
01:55:02,061 --> 01:55:02,894
Uh,

4158
01:55:03,190 --> 01:55:04,970
you just don't trash by that man.

4159
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:07,010
I think it was kind of
like let it out in advance.

4160
01:55:07,290 --> 01:55:08,090
He think,

4161
01:55:08,090 --> 01:55:08,990
what did he think?

4162
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:11,630
He's wanting to get
attention to make a video.

4163
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:15,920
You put on a gay and a and then
you trash talk to the girl.

4164
01:55:16,300 --> 01:55:16,810
Like,

4165
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:18,200
like you're not going to,

4166
01:55:18,201 --> 01:55:19,034
uh,

4167
01:55:19,390 --> 01:55:20,090
yeah.

4168
01:55:20,090 --> 01:55:20,241
Well,

4169
01:55:20,241 --> 01:55:21,320
people got upset when I said that.

4170
01:55:21,321 --> 01:55:23,730
I think she could beat a lot
of men in her in that way.

4171
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:25,310
I don't know why they would,

4172
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:26,330
well cause they don't know.

4173
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:28,490
I've never rolled with a
girl who is really good.

4174
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:31,310
I made like in a natural world,

4175
01:55:31,311 --> 01:55:36,311
right outline this can sometimes beat
a male line if they're the same size.

4176
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:36,880
Yeah.

4177
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:37,713
I mean you never know.

4178
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:39,030
And if she has cub,

4179
01:55:39,031 --> 01:55:40,290
she'll risk your life to,

4180
01:55:40,550 --> 01:55:42,350
and maybe he could beat her,

4181
01:55:42,351 --> 01:55:44,070
but her incentive

4182
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,050
is way higher than his incentive.

4183
01:55:46,051 --> 01:55:48,360
So he figures it's not worth it.

4184
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:49,740
Well technique is,

4185
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:50,900
as we said before,

4186
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:51,833
is paramount.

4187
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,930
And her technique is so laser sharp.

4188
01:55:55,230 --> 01:55:58,410
If she got in there with a guy who
doesn't have that good a technique,

4189
01:55:58,411 --> 01:55:59,490
just because he's a man,

4190
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:01,450
the physical strength and the inherent,

4191
01:56:01,940 --> 01:56:04,710
the benefits of being a male,

4192
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:09,950
whatever advantages that he may have
aren't necessarily going to counter the

4193
01:56:10,861 --> 01:56:13,410
technique that she has when
they're the same weight.

4194
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:16,350
Now if you're dealing with
a guy like you know she's,

4195
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:18,810
she competes at one 35 okay.

4196
01:56:18,811 --> 01:56:22,500
If you deal with her versus a guy
at one 70 like Johnny Hendricks,

4197
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:24,480
like Jesus of course that's a Mitch match.

4198
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:29,340
Johnny Hendricks is a powerful big strong
man and he most likely would beat her

4199
01:56:29,341 --> 01:56:29,970
up.

4200
01:56:29,970 --> 01:56:34,860
But you're talking about a guy who's her
weight and then even if he's physically

4201
01:56:34,861 --> 01:56:35,341
stronger,

4202
01:56:35,341 --> 01:56:36,570
maybe can hit harder.

4203
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:40,110
But how much of a technical advantage
does she have on the ground?

4204
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:43,470
She can easily catch you in
something in a scramble easily,

4205
01:56:43,471 --> 01:56:43,890
easily.

4206
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:44,131
Well,

4207
01:56:44,131 --> 01:56:44,461
you know,

4208
01:56:44,461 --> 01:56:44,701
two,

4209
01:56:44,701 --> 01:56:44,971
three,

4210
01:56:44,971 --> 01:56:46,350
four steps ahead of you for,

4211
01:56:46,351 --> 01:56:48,030
for older guys like myself,

4212
01:56:48,031 --> 01:56:50,880
actually the women are some
of your best bar partners,

4213
01:56:50,881 --> 01:56:52,200
like the more advanced women,

4214
01:56:52,470 --> 01:56:55,010
they're fun to train with because
they're not going to try to muscle it.

4215
01:56:55,060 --> 01:56:56,190
They don't usually,

4216
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:57,660
it's rare occasionally,

4217
01:56:57,661 --> 01:56:59,370
but usually women won't use power.

4218
01:57:00,030 --> 01:57:01,770
They do think differently than men.

4219
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:06,980
They have a different logic and they
surprise the heck out of you with some of

4220
01:57:07,021 --> 01:57:09,900
their attacks and the way
they put their game together.

4221
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:10,920
It's really fun.

4222
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:13,650
And usually women are pretty flexible,

4223
01:57:13,830 --> 01:57:17,660
so their guards are a nightmare to get
some of these girls with their daily

4224
01:57:17,661 --> 01:57:18,050
havens,

4225
01:57:18,050 --> 01:57:18,710
spider guards,

4226
01:57:18,710 --> 01:57:19,800
like wow.

4227
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:22,080
Controlling those feet are,

4228
01:57:22,170 --> 01:57:23,310
is a nightmare.

4229
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:23,620
Yeah.

4230
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:25,140
And you think about someone's guard.

4231
01:57:25,141 --> 01:57:28,080
Someone's legs have to
carry their body around,

4232
01:57:28,110 --> 01:57:28,291
you know,

4233
01:57:28,291 --> 01:57:33,150
say if they weigh 140 pounds like Rhonda
or one 35 and you know you're carrying

4234
01:57:33,151 --> 01:57:34,440
135 pounds around.

4235
01:57:34,441 --> 01:57:34,981
All by the way,

4236
01:57:34,981 --> 01:57:38,130
she doesn't really weigh one 35
she was one 35 on weighing day.

4237
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:42,240
And then I would imagine she rehydrates
up to around one 50 close to it.

4238
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:42,661
She does.

4239
01:57:42,661 --> 01:57:43,201
She's pretty,

4240
01:57:43,201 --> 01:57:44,910
she cares a lot of muscle in that frame.

4241
01:57:44,911 --> 01:57:45,744
It's just thick.

4242
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:46,480
And she's not,

4243
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:48,150
she's not a skinny girl by any stretch.

4244
01:57:48,210 --> 01:57:48,421
Yeah.

4245
01:57:48,421 --> 01:57:50,670
She's not week by any
stretch of the imagination.

4246
01:57:51,090 --> 01:57:52,110
She's very strong.

4247
01:57:52,111 --> 01:57:56,790
And so you're dealing with someone who
knows how to manipulate their body and

4248
01:57:56,791 --> 01:58:01,110
they have these legs that are carrying
around all of this weight all day long.

4249
01:58:01,111 --> 01:58:03,060
Your legs are amazingly strong.

4250
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:04,380
It's amazing endurance.

4251
01:58:04,530 --> 01:58:05,850
And when you factor that in,

4252
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:10,470
if you've gotten like I remember
doing drills with my friend Felicia,

4253
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:10,961
Felicia.

4254
01:58:10,961 --> 01:58:11,140
Oh,

4255
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:13,200
it's one of John Joc
Machado's black belts.

4256
01:58:13,230 --> 01:58:13,530
Yeah,

4257
01:58:13,530 --> 01:58:16,210
I know Felicia from
the old RKC Kettlebell.

4258
01:58:16,230 --> 01:58:16,491
Yeah.

4259
01:58:16,491 --> 01:58:16,771
Yeah.

4260
01:58:16,771 --> 01:58:17,880
She's a kettlebell wizard.

4261
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:18,990
She loves that.

4262
01:58:18,991 --> 01:58:23,910
But I remember doing drills with her
and you know armbar drills and she locks

4263
01:58:23,911 --> 01:58:25,290
and arm bar up on you man.

4264
01:58:25,291 --> 01:58:26,820
And you're dealing with legs.

4265
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:29,310
Legs are strong man.

4266
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:33,330
Even a small woman has very strong legs.

4267
01:58:33,390 --> 01:58:33,581
Well,

4268
01:58:33,581 --> 01:58:37,170
the difference between male and
female legs is very small percentage.

4269
01:58:37,580 --> 01:58:38,580
You know in studies,

4270
01:58:38,581 --> 01:58:40,470
if they've done a upper body,

4271
01:58:40,930 --> 01:58:41,980
there is a significant

4272
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:42,790
difference.

4273
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:44,260
But where's the train woman?

4274
01:58:44,261 --> 01:58:48,520
She can close that gap
and I'll tell ya for,

4275
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:50,080
for you older guys listening out there,

4276
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:50,291
you know,

4277
01:58:50,291 --> 01:58:53,380
you guys over 40 or if you're
a guy that's been injured,

4278
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:58,240
start seeking the girls out for sparring
partners and you will have a wonderful

4279
01:58:58,241 --> 01:59:00,280
technical spar session.

4280
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:01,960
You also look like a
little bit of a creep.

4281
01:59:02,350 --> 01:59:02,700
Yeah,

4282
01:59:02,700 --> 01:59:03,533
alumnae heads up.

4283
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:06,160
Just don't be afraid to tap.

4284
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:07,751
Yeah,

4285
01:59:07,751 --> 01:59:09,730
that's a big one with
guys tapping to girls.

4286
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:10,451
Oh my God.

4287
01:59:10,451 --> 01:59:13,520
Some guys want to bleed from the eyes
before though tapped her growing up every

4288
01:59:13,550 --> 01:59:14,170
time to a girl.

4289
01:59:14,170 --> 01:59:14,950
Oh hell yeah.

4290
01:59:14,950 --> 01:59:15,610
I haven't.

4291
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:16,260
Ah,

4292
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:16,650
AH,

4293
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:17,483
well

4294
01:59:19,030 --> 01:59:19,571
I didn't say,

4295
01:59:19,571 --> 01:59:20,404
I didn't say what it,

4296
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:21,273
what content

4297
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:24,851
I would though.

4298
01:59:24,851 --> 01:59:25,960
I mean I'm sure Robert could probably,

4299
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:27,401
if I,

4300
01:59:27,401 --> 01:59:29,530
if I get an a bad is I
don't care who it is.

4301
01:59:29,531 --> 01:59:29,830
If it's,

4302
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:31,000
if it's a child,

4303
01:59:31,001 --> 01:59:31,834
I'll tap if,

4304
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:32,180
if,

4305
01:59:32,180 --> 01:59:33,760
if I'm now,

4306
01:59:33,761 --> 01:59:37,000
now I'm to the point where my
days were fighting out of stuff.

4307
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:37,810
If I'm,

4308
01:59:37,810 --> 01:59:38,201
if I,

4309
01:59:38,201 --> 01:59:40,960
if I make the mistake and
I get into submission,

4310
01:59:41,470 --> 01:59:45,250
I have to assume that if it was a
person of equal skill to myself,

4311
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:46,001
um,

4312
01:59:46,001 --> 01:59:46,834
submitted,

4313
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:48,340
he got me in this position.

4314
01:59:49,030 --> 01:59:50,050
Fighting out of it.

4315
01:59:50,051 --> 01:59:53,710
Is it really technique is much
as just strength or whatever,

4316
01:59:53,711 --> 01:59:53,981
you know,

4317
01:59:53,981 --> 01:59:54,580
pain,

4318
01:59:54,580 --> 01:59:54,941
pain,

4319
01:59:54,941 --> 01:59:55,710
tolerance,

4320
01:59:55,710 --> 01:59:56,020
right.

4321
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:57,940
I mean the technical escapes.

4322
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:58,570
Sure.

4323
01:59:58,570 --> 01:59:59,500
But you know,

4324
01:59:59,501 --> 02:00:00,860
like you know what though?

4325
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:02,200
The joint straight.

4326
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,220
Right,

4327
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:03,850
okay.

4328
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:06,290
Especially when it's fully
locked in Zach or focus,

4329
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:09,910
he got me straight toward the chokes set.

4330
02:00:10,630 --> 02:00:13,720
It's just pain tolerance in or whatever.

4331
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:14,830
It's also the,

4332
02:00:14,831 --> 02:00:15,280
the,

4333
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:18,160
the price you pay just
to keep your ego healthy.

4334
02:00:18,370 --> 02:00:19,121
Like physically.

4335
02:00:19,121 --> 02:00:19,661
I remember,

4336
02:00:19,661 --> 02:00:19,901
um,

4337
02:00:19,901 --> 02:00:24,580
my friend Brent got me in a Kimora and
I didn't want to tap and I fought out of

4338
02:00:24,581 --> 02:00:24,970
it,

4339
02:00:24,970 --> 02:00:27,100
but I couldn't do chin ups for months.

4340
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:29,140
I had hobos so jacked,

4341
02:00:29,141 --> 02:00:30,400
I couldn't do chin ups for the long.

4342
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:33,700
And I just remember everyday I would be
at the gym when I was lifting weights

4343
02:00:33,701 --> 02:00:33,940
going,

4344
02:00:33,940 --> 02:00:35,560
why the fuck didn't I just tap?

4345
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:37,330
Because I would be fine right now.

4346
02:00:37,331 --> 02:00:39,160
Like either it was the
same thing happened.

4347
02:00:39,161 --> 02:00:40,240
I've tapped to him before,

4348
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:41,590
he's tapped me before,

4349
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:43,080
but I just would not happen.

4350
02:00:43,090 --> 02:00:43,810
I'm like,

4351
02:00:43,810 --> 02:00:44,081
yeah,

4352
02:00:44,081 --> 02:00:45,610
you're just in that shrine center,

4353
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:48,250
but you got to treat it
like it's basketball.

4354
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:50,230
Someone scores on you in basketball,

4355
02:00:50,231 --> 02:00:51,280
it's not the end of the world.

4356
02:00:51,281 --> 02:00:52,870
You've got the ball and
you go right back in.

4357
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:56,080
Or are you playing softball and you
pop fly out in the outfield or you get

4358
02:00:56,081 --> 02:00:57,220
thrown out at third base.

4359
02:00:57,221 --> 02:00:57,760
So what,

4360
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:58,060
okay.

4361
02:00:58,060 --> 02:00:59,410
You get another chance at bat.

4362
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:00,221
But,

4363
02:01:00,221 --> 02:01:00,700
uh,

4364
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:02,290
a lot of times like,

4365
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:02,921
like you said,

4366
02:01:02,921 --> 02:01:04,240
even though you do fight out of it,

4367
02:01:04,270 --> 02:01:05,350
you are successful.

4368
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:06,790
The injuries already occurred,

4369
02:01:06,850 --> 02:01:10,690
especially with the neck and you
might not even feel it at the time,

4370
02:01:10,691 --> 02:01:11,524
but then it's like,

4371
02:01:11,530 --> 02:01:12,580
oh shit,

4372
02:01:12,581 --> 02:01:14,440
this really hurts man.

4373
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:16,260
I didn't realize it was his damages.

4374
02:01:16,270 --> 02:01:18,670
There was maybe you're a
little bit of adrenalized or,

4375
02:01:19,420 --> 02:01:20,500
that's why I love the,

4376
02:01:20,501 --> 02:01:20,681
uh,

4377
02:01:20,681 --> 02:01:21,970
the saying that the uh,

4378
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,160
like Henna and here on
you keep it playful.

4379
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:24,581
Keep it.

4380
02:01:24,581 --> 02:01:24,880
Boy,

4381
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:26,200
that's a great way.

4382
02:01:26,201 --> 02:01:28,900
It's a great philosophy and
it's a great way to teach,

4383
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:29,381
you know,

4384
02:01:29,381 --> 02:01:32,710
those guys have really done
and the real boss Boston map,

4385
02:01:32,830 --> 02:01:36,460
I met those guys when they were
just like little tiny boys.

4386
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:37,840
They're so enthusiastic too.

4387
02:01:37,841 --> 02:01:38,890
It's very contagious.

4388
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:39,770
Is they are,

4389
02:01:39,770 --> 02:01:41,540
they are very enthusiastic.

4390
02:01:41,570 --> 02:01:44,900
It does Gracie breakdowns that they do
with a go over the techniques that guys

4391
02:01:44,901 --> 02:01:46,520
use and fights to win fights.

4392
02:01:46,521 --> 02:01:46,881
It's like,

4393
02:01:46,881 --> 02:01:47,714
it's very,

4394
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:48,350
it's,

4395
02:01:48,350 --> 02:01:49,670
it really makes you want to train.

4396
02:01:49,671 --> 02:01:50,060
They're great.

4397
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:51,020
They're great assets.

4398
02:01:51,021 --> 02:01:51,651
Do Jujitsu,

4399
02:01:51,651 --> 02:01:52,670
the great ambassadors.

4400
02:01:52,671 --> 02:01:53,504
I think so too.

4401
02:01:53,610 --> 02:01:54,021
I A,

4402
02:01:54,021 --> 02:01:55,880
I love that whole a straight fight.

4403
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:57,920
Things that they do and they show like a,

4404
02:01:58,340 --> 02:02:00,560
the right things that people
do are in the wrong things.

4405
02:02:00,561 --> 02:02:02,030
And then they get some pretty,

4406
02:02:02,031 --> 02:02:02,181
uh,

4407
02:02:02,181 --> 02:02:03,770
intense street fights on there sometimes.

4408
02:02:04,190 --> 02:02:08,660
So you're in town for how long and
you're doing some seminars around here?

4409
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:09,411
Uh,

4410
02:02:09,411 --> 02:02:10,244
I actually,

4411
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:10,641
uh,

4412
02:02:10,641 --> 02:02:12,920
I came here it just to see you and then,

4413
02:02:12,921 --> 02:02:13,161
uh,

4414
02:02:13,161 --> 02:02:14,000
I'm going to be,

4415
02:02:14,001 --> 02:02:14,834
and

4416
02:02:15,890 --> 02:02:17,270
I don't know whether I should
even mention in your show,

4417
02:02:17,271 --> 02:02:19,700
but a love line with that doctor Joe,

4418
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:20,630
why shouldn't you mentioned it?

4419
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:21,380
Oh Man.

4420
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:21,890
You know,

4421
02:02:21,890 --> 02:02:23,450
it's kind of a,

4422
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:26,920
isn't it like a competition
podcast or something?

4423
02:02:26,950 --> 02:02:27,410
Oh,

4424
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:28,243
no,

4425
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:29,840
I don't think about it like that at all,

4426
02:02:29,841 --> 02:02:30,674
ever.

4427
02:02:30,770 --> 02:02:31,310
No,

4428
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:31,641
no,

4429
02:02:31,641 --> 02:02:31,881
no,

4430
02:02:31,881 --> 02:02:32,640
no.

4431
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:33,770
A lot of friends doing that.

4432
02:02:34,370 --> 02:02:36,380
That's how old school radio mentality.

4433
02:02:36,980 --> 02:02:37,690
I never,

4434
02:02:37,690 --> 02:02:38,330
you know,

4435
02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:39,950
I support everything.

4436
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:40,731
So,

4437
02:02:40,731 --> 02:02:41,061
yeah,

4438
02:02:41,061 --> 02:02:41,271
that,

4439
02:02:41,271 --> 02:02:42,104
that was a weird,

4440
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:42,441
weird,

4441
02:02:42,441 --> 02:02:42,830
weird man.

4442
02:02:42,830 --> 02:02:43,210
I,

4443
02:02:43,210 --> 02:02:43,561
I just,

4444
02:02:43,561 --> 02:02:44,690
they just call it out of the blue.

4445
02:02:44,691 --> 02:02:47,480
Apparently the guys been following
some of the anti aging stuff up,

4446
02:02:47,481 --> 02:02:49,490
doing the no touch or drew,

4447
02:02:49,491 --> 02:02:50,660
but the Mike,

4448
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:51,021
yeah,

4449
02:02:51,021 --> 02:02:52,190
the comedian guy that's on there.

4450
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:52,691
Yeah,

4451
02:02:52,691 --> 02:02:52,941
yeah,

4452
02:02:52,941 --> 02:02:53,300
yeah.

4453
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:54,110
That's interesting.

4454
02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:54,231
Oh,

4455
02:02:54,231 --> 02:02:54,800
that's cool.

4456
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:54,981
Yeah,

4457
02:02:54,981 --> 02:02:55,161
no,

4458
02:02:55,161 --> 02:02:56,510
I've never done anything like that before.

4459
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:57,200
That's like,

4460
02:02:57,200 --> 02:02:57,950
Whoa,

4461
02:02:57,950 --> 02:02:58,820
that should be interesting.

4462
02:02:58,920 --> 02:02:59,120
Yeah,

4463
02:02:59,120 --> 02:02:59,600
it'll be fun.

4464
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:00,230
Tell him I said Hi.

4465
02:03:00,230 --> 02:03:01,280
I had no idea.

4466
02:03:01,281 --> 02:03:01,581
You know,

4467
02:03:01,581 --> 02:03:04,220
like what to expect or tell them
that you're getting into pot.

4468
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:05,383
Yeah,

4469
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:06,650
he's actually,

4470
02:03:06,650 --> 02:03:10,640
he's actually come around about pot
human that Sanjay Gupta from CNN,

4471
02:03:10,641 --> 02:03:11,480
they're all coming around.

4472
02:03:11,770 --> 02:03:12,710
I came around,

4473
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:13,340
you know,

4474
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:15,430
it's like now that you're
seeing it legalized,

4475
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:15,861
but yeah,

4476
02:03:15,861 --> 02:03:16,130
I was,

4477
02:03:16,130 --> 02:03:19,190
I was a little concerned because like I
wasn't sure what was it going to be like

4478
02:03:19,191 --> 02:03:23,160
a Howard stern thing where they tried
to make it look like an idiot or no,

4479
02:03:23,210 --> 02:03:23,481
no,

4480
02:03:23,481 --> 02:03:23,811
no,

4481
02:03:23,811 --> 02:03:24,111
no,

4482
02:03:24,111 --> 02:03:25,130
I understand.

4483
02:03:25,130 --> 02:03:25,970
It's actually a pretty,

4484
02:03:25,971 --> 02:03:26,391
a pretty,

4485
02:03:26,391 --> 02:03:27,230
a pretty cool show.

4486
02:03:27,860 --> 02:03:28,221
So,

4487
02:03:28,221 --> 02:03:28,670
um,

4488
02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:30,830
I'll be doing that strength matters.

4489
02:03:30,831 --> 02:03:32,480
Summit in San Diego,

4490
02:03:32,510 --> 02:03:35,390
that's 20th through 22nd March San Diego.

4491
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:37,670
I'm teaching a body weight workshop.

4492
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:39,830
Where can people find all of this stuff?

4493
02:03:39,831 --> 02:03:41,180
Just on my website.

4494
02:03:41,181 --> 02:03:43,700
Maxwell S c.com,

4495
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:44,810
ww dot.

4496
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:49,310
Maxwell Sca for strength
and conditioning.com and
all of the upcoming things.

4497
02:03:49,311 --> 02:03:50,150
And then of course,

4498
02:03:50,151 --> 02:03:52,160
the El Salvador lifestyle,

4499
02:03:52,710 --> 02:03:53,543
uh,

4500
02:03:53,890 --> 02:03:56,390
Jujitsu training camp show you all the,

4501
02:03:56,391 --> 02:03:56,670
uh,

4502
02:03:56,670 --> 02:03:58,340
all my anti aging secrets.

4503
02:03:58,430 --> 02:03:58,881
Nice.

4504
02:03:58,881 --> 02:03:59,510
Hopefully,

4505
02:03:59,510 --> 02:04:00,140
you know,

4506
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:03,400
mobility and conditioning and Jujitsu,

4507
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:06,200
big emphasis on the self
defense aspects of it,

4508
02:04:06,201 --> 02:04:08,910
but also we'll have some
other young guys there,

4509
02:04:08,911 --> 02:04:09,170
uh,

4510
02:04:09,170 --> 02:04:10,490
for competition stuff.

4511
02:04:11,090 --> 02:04:11,511
And then,

4512
02:04:11,511 --> 02:04:12,344
uh,

4513
02:04:12,470 --> 02:04:16,820
I just came out with the five pillar
workout system for kettle bells.

4514
02:04:17,300 --> 02:04:18,510
I have a mood,

4515
02:04:18,950 --> 02:04:20,750
like a movement based exercise.

4516
02:04:21,110 --> 02:04:23,720
I had a one with the body weight.

4517
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:27,440
Now I came out with the Kettlebell
five pillar movement system.

4518
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:31,940
Just release that and I'm going to be
making one with the barbell five pillar.

4519
02:04:32,090 --> 02:04:33,050
So Nice.

4520
02:04:33,051 --> 02:04:33,651
And here we go.

4521
02:04:33,651 --> 02:04:34,401
This is the uh,

4522
02:04:34,401 --> 02:04:37,620
the website here as well as c.com.

4523
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:38,491
And uh,

4524
02:04:38,491 --> 02:04:43,230
you also custom tailor workouts for
your clients through the Internet.

4525
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:44,153
I do.

4526
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:45,750
I discovered a long time ago,

4527
02:04:45,751 --> 02:04:47,310
about 15 years ago that uh,

4528
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:48,473
a lot of people,

4529
02:04:48,930 --> 02:04:51,300
they don't need someone to hand
hold them through workouts.

4530
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:54,180
They had the incentive to train if
they just didn't know what to do.

4531
02:04:54,570 --> 02:04:55,950
So I do die programs,

4532
02:04:55,951 --> 02:04:57,240
fat loss programs for people,

4533
02:04:57,241 --> 02:04:59,880
help them wade through
all that huge information.

4534
02:04:59,890 --> 02:05:01,830
I've had my own personal diet wars with,

4535
02:05:01,831 --> 02:05:06,831
with myself and I pretty much figured
out a way that you can keep lean year

4536
02:05:07,081 --> 02:05:07,680
round.

4537
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:11,010
So I help people with diet fat
loss and you know what to do.

4538
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,530
There's so much bench,

4539
02:05:12,750 --> 02:05:12,850
uh,

4540
02:05:12,850 --> 02:05:14,400
information and misinformation.

4541
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,680
W W how do you put all this together,

4542
02:05:16,681 --> 02:05:17,160
you know,

4543
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:18,000
is difficult.

4544
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:21,570
It's difficult to come up with a time
to do all the research yourself and it's

4545
02:05:21,571 --> 02:05:22,890
all based in calls by the way.

4546
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:25,530
There's so many different
ways to crack the nut,

4547
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:28,050
so many different systems and
they all work more or less.

4548
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:30,690
It just all depends on what
it is that the guy wants.

4549
02:05:30,691 --> 02:05:34,440
So people really need a lot of
help just sorting that stuff out.

4550
02:05:34,441 --> 02:05:35,274
So that's what I do.

4551
02:05:35,610 --> 02:05:37,530
And a extensive questionnaire,

4552
02:05:37,590 --> 02:05:37,890
uh,

4553
02:05:37,890 --> 02:05:40,170
I analyze a photograph for structure,

4554
02:05:40,171 --> 02:05:40,890
you know,

4555
02:05:40,890 --> 02:05:41,190
uh,

4556
02:05:41,190 --> 02:05:42,840
postural stuff and then,

4557
02:05:42,841 --> 02:05:43,170
uh,

4558
02:05:43,170 --> 02:05:47,580
you get a custom workout program and
you send me training logs and I reviewed

4559
02:05:47,581 --> 02:05:52,220
them and sandy information back and do
progressions with people and so forth.

4560
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:53,011
Well,

4561
02:05:53,011 --> 02:05:55,410
I can't recommend you highly enough.

4562
02:05:55,510 --> 02:05:57,750
Thanks all the years
that we've been friends,

4563
02:05:57,751 --> 02:06:01,620
I've just gained a tremendous amount of
information from you and all the times

4564
02:06:01,621 --> 02:06:03,450
we worked out together and
we're working out tomorrow too.

4565
02:06:04,290 --> 02:06:04,920
Damn Joe,

4566
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:05,753
those guns are

4567
02:06:07,170 --> 02:06:08,160
very excited about that.

4568
02:06:08,190 --> 02:06:08,431
Um,

4569
02:06:08,431 --> 02:06:12,150
so anybody who interested in any sort
of a strength and conditioning workout,

4570
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:15,690
if you want to mix it up or we just
want to just tap into the database of

4571
02:06:15,691 --> 02:06:16,201
knowledge,

4572
02:06:16,201 --> 02:06:17,220
that is Steve Maxwell,

4573
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:18,300

4581

4582
02:06:32,430 --> 02:06:32,820
All right.

4583
02:06:32,820 --> 02:06:33,331
Thank you brother.

4584
02:06:33,331 --> 02:06:34,090
Appreciate it man.

4585
02:06:34,090 --> 02:06:35,820
Always a good time to do this more often.

4586
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:37,920
You're a traveling nomad though,

4587
02:06:37,921 --> 02:06:38,191
man.

4588
02:06:38,191 --> 02:06:39,030
You're all over the world.

4589
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:39,560
Thanks.

4590
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:40,590
We got him here for a little bit.

4591
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:41,713
All right folks.

4592
02:06:41,850 --> 02:06:43,320
We'll be back tomorrow.

4593
02:06:43,350 --> 02:06:44,011
Take care.

4594
02:06:44,011 --> 02:06:44,844
Bye Bye.

4595
02:06:45,630 --> 02:06:46,251
Awesome Joe.

4596
02:06:46,251 --> 02:06:46,830
Thanks man.
