Hello Rick,
we'll talk to you when you're surviving

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,630
animal food in plastic and then eat it
and then poop it out and eat it later.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,590
Like I'm take the plastic off and eat
it.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,130
Jesus Christ.
It seems like it could work.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,070
That's a technique I've never thought.
I mean if you're going to be like on

6
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:22,320
your own for five days,
you can eat a bunch of food but wrap it

7
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:24,180
up in plastic and then later poop it
out.

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,130
Then untaken out with.
Then how would you get the nutrients

9
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:28,700
from the food in the first place with
your stomach and a piece of plywood is

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,770
this poop it out.
I don't understand it.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,090
And then you poop it out and like before
you leave for your trip,

12
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:36,390
go to and go get stuffed like Boston
market or something.

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,240
Conversation.
Don't ruin this when you're poorly

14
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:41,370
thought out ideas and they get a bunch
of plastic.

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,470
Don't tell him stop.
Can't,

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,240
can't tell you how to eat his poop.
No,

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,113
no,
no.

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,040
I'm saying like eat like on big meal
before you were about to leave.

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,870
He would eat his own food.
It's called the things called second

20
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:58,290
harvest and then native American maybe
take a bunch of like protein bars,

21
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,700
wrapped them up in plastic,
eat it,

22
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,020
and then poop it out in a couple of
days.

23
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,570
Then unwrap the plastic they need what
kind of shit you really think a fucking

24
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,610
whole protein bar in plastic can make it
through your digestive tract and carry

25
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:14,410
the bars in my backpack and just eat
them three days later,

26
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,880
poorest understanding of the human
digestive tract ever exhibited on a

27
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:19,890
podcast.
I was trying to figure out what you were

28
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:21,330
saying.
I thought you were saying eating poop.

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,270
You're not talking about a little Baggie
of heroin that a drug.

30
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,360
I was thinking like,
we're going to make you survive.

31
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:28,830
You'll.
You'll get another hour's worth of

32
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:31,710
energy from that little heroin bag.
What about Petite Finlaison?

33
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,260
Eight ounces wrapped in plastic.
You're going to die.

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,790
People get diverticulitis because they
get a fucking watermelon seed.

35
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,860
Freaking word diverticulitis,
she says signifies word.

36
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,980
Well,
Brock Lesnar for the UFC got diverted

37
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,710
because I had a serious operation when
they removed 12 inches of his colon.

38
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,350
Found out about it.
I looked into it and I thought it was

39
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:58,320
just because of eating meat,
but Anthony Bourdain and informed me

40
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:01,200
that you can eat a seed,
like you get like a sunflower seeds or

41
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:04,950
something stuck inside your tract,
your digestive tract,

42
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,230
and it starts an abscess and you get
sick.

43
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,070
Yeah,
you could.

44
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,920
You can die from a fucking seed getting
stuck.

45
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:12,450
He's like all kinds of stuff gets stuck
in there,

46
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,600
so it's not necessarily just protein.
There's also contributed to the game is

47
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:21,870
like a Gi track.
Dr. Now you can't eat a petite filet

48
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:24,570
minion should it out in the woods.
That's all I'm saying.

49
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,800
You gotta have to have a better strategy
than ever.

50
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,720
I guess I was thinking survivor island,
like trying to find a way to cheat.

51
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,200
You can't.
You can't carry it in your backpack.

52
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,750
You'll know you're pregnant if you had
enough food for a day,

53
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,790
all the food backed up with your body.
What can a calorie consumption are you

54
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,550
thinking you have to have.
