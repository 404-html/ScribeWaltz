1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,170
Do we have power?

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:07,630
Yes.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,051
Yes,

4
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:08,800
yes.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,401
The machine.

6
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:10,420
Ladies and gentlemen

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,610
on Showtime.

8
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,610
Bert Kreischer,

9
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,450
Douglas Douglas,

10
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:16,631
me,

11
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:17,464
boy.

12
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,740
Doug's dad hope

13
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,640
almost married him in
the early two thousands

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,250
if Marilyn Manson wants to come around,

15
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,113
you can come out.

16
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,430
Bill burrs here.

17
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:30,991
Bill Burton,

18
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:31,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

19
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,680
because I stutter.

20
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,751
Bill Bird,

21
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:38,584
just good

22
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,473
calming.

23
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,590
Wait,

24
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,891
where are you?

25
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:48,691
Silly Diaz.

26
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:52,030
This calming Judge Judy as he's come in.

27
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,920
You told me I started doing.

28
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,590
A lot of people are coming.

29
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,433
We're watching

30
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,280
Greg Fitzsimmons.

31
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,440
Everybody says,

32
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:04,580
Ladies and gentlemen,

33
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,410
Gray's gonna start drinking tonight.

34
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,180
Rogan is there.

35
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,950
It's over

36
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:12,300
Kroger.

37
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,110
Dot.

38
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,580
This is all I have.

39
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,060
All I have is a fake smile
and an opener wrote something.

40
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,231
No,

41
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:22,530
I,

42
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,850
this is a text I sent to
you last week when I was at,

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,120
I thought the worst day
of my life until today.

44
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,680
And I came to town to try to organize
this and I don't know what the fuck,

45
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:38,190
I can't live stream.

46
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:39,024
What does it,

47
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,380
you have a car.

48
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,720
So this is what I sent
to Rogan at the depths

49
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,290
of what I thought was
the worst hangover ever.

50
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,641
We're all adults,

51
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:52,971
folks.

52
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:53,840
This is bullshit.

53
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,320
Even even worrying about this is both

54
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,420
with cotton candy here.

55
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,990
This is what I wrote
to rogue in a week ago.

56
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,900
I get a date right
there and hit that bill.

57
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,060
I wrote a lot of shit.

58
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,063
A little cool.

59
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,310
I'm in a serious panic mode
and really want to bail on it.

60
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,180
Meaning this,

61
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,600
I think it's a great idea,

62
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:22,040
but I have no idea how to
organize it and it's so close.

63
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,590
The comedy store gave us the day
and I don't want to fuck them over,

64
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:27,660
but I don't know how to make this work.

65
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,050
I fucked up and don't know
how to put it together.

66
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,320
I don't want to put all this on you,

67
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,920
but I don't want to be the guy
responsible for an abortion,

68
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,770
but way far only you and a
vague bill burr have committed.

69
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,190
I want to fake a stroke
to get out of ruining.

70
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:49,380
It saved me.

71
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,390
Ps has been a long week.

72
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,263
Rogan,

73
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,363
Rogan,

74
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,850
very succinctly

75
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,690
rights back.

76
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,190
We'll figure it.

77
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,190
Oh fuck man.

78
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:05,024
That's it.

79
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:05,990
I'll handle it.

80
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,740
Don't sweat it.

81
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,521
It's nothing.

82
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,480
We show up.

83
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,380
We drank.

84
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,180
I smoked pot pot.

85
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:12,620
We talk easy.

86
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,100
[inaudible]

87
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,880
fucking Rogan says it's good.

88
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:22,714
It's good.

89
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,970
Made it road on the man show.

90
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,113
Get two guys.

91
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,591
Oh really?

92
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,450
Do you still get hate mail from them?

93
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,080
No.

94
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,880
The writers,

95
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,531
no one's no,

96
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:34,900
but I can say there was a,

97
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,680
there was very little preparation and a,

98
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:40,240
and there was some funny fucking
monologues that were on that show.

99
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,133
We had some fun.

100
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,173
Yeah,

101
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,490
you don't need preparation then
sometimes you do like right now.

102
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,341
Well,

103
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:47,091
I had that.

104
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:47,740
I had that

105
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,191
fill that out.

106
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:49,024
That weird.

107
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,590
I like the Doug always.

108
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,400
I don't want to be the guy
responsible for an abortion,

109
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,680
but he's totally had abortions
that he's paid for her

110
00:03:59,420 --> 00:03:59,961
for Christ.

111
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:00,860
You're bringing it down.

112
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:03,150
Plus when Donald Trump becomes president,

113
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,610
you're a fucking criminal portion.

114
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,370
Draws it at eight for a
plethora of abortions.

115
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,481
By the way,

116
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:16,720
if you thought this was going
to be about the election,

117
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,673
no,

118
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,660
it's the end of the world.

119
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:20,650
Either way.

120
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:20,880
Yeah.

121
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,650
If you guys,

122
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,483
we wouldn't pay here.

123
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,921
I do have to.

124
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:24,940
I have to do this.

125
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,040
Brent Ericson Ericson.

126
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,920
We do have our breaking news guy,

127
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,450
Brent Ericson.

128
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,180
Fantastic comic is actually
having to watch the CNN coverage.

129
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,350
So anything actually does matter.

130
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:43,120
He'll run out and be breaking.

131
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:44,170
He has a laptop.

132
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,260
Yeah,

133
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,350
kind of lyrics and he's watching it.

134
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,593
That's fine.

135
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,910
We can just do four
hours before the shows.

136
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:58,330
I do you have any TV screens?

137
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,980
Are there any laptops?

138
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:01,180
What are we going to do out there?

139
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,150
Very hasty.

140
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,150
Hastily thrown together
yet planned for months.

141
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,690
You texted me about this easily in August,

142
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,733
easily

143
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,511
a year ago.

144
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:17,344
He came up with it.

145
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,083
I realized,

146
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,530
no,

147
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,300
I think everyone doesn't like me.

148
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,860
When you returned my texts,

149
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:25,600
they were scared that girl.

150
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,970
Aw,

151
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,050
that's adorable.

152
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:29,441
Yeah.

153
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:29,780
So,

154
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,613
uh,

155
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,121
yeah,

156
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:31,720
there's uh,

157
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,411
an election.

158
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:35,650
It doesn't matter if you care
about does it Kinda does.

159
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:38,650
What matters the most is
that no matter who wins,

160
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:39,100
we're both,

161
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,720
we're all of us really alike.

162
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,943
Okay.

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,391
I mean,

164
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:45,320
it's not good.

165
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:45,770
No.

166
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,020
If Trump wins when Obama won,

167
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:48,890
didn't you feel like,

168
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:49,281
wow,

169
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:50,300
this is some new shit.

170
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:52,250
A guy couldn't form full sentences,

171
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,600
went to actual schools.

172
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,190
That's very racial,

173
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,770
very articulate

174
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,880
as opposed to George Bush.

175
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:00,714
You fuck.

176
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,710
That's how I look.

177
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,401
We were happy.

178
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:04,620
We're having them look at
this really articulate,

179
00:06:04,621 --> 00:06:06,210
intelligent guy that's reasonable.

180
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,890
What he does on election day.

181
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:09,390
It's your tradition not making this up.

182
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,580
He plays basketball on election day.

183
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,721
Good for him.

184
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:14,010
I heard that on CNN today.

185
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,390
That's why I talk shows
actually have screeners and go,

186
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:17,551
hey,

187
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:18,390
what are you going to say?

188
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:19,224
At what point?

189
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,430
[inaudible] you have an
interesting story about,

190
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,690
you could be like Byron
Allen on that late night show

191
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,151
going to the zoo.

192
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:32,500
Completely different.

193
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,300
Bill Furry like to water ski.

194
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,910
Slowly a bit funny.

195
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:38,950
You brought that up
and here's my anecdote.

196
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:41,110
That fits perfectly right
before the commercial.

197
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,430
Don't forget to segway to
Kreischer with something completely

198
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,921
different.

199
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:49,040
Friday night for Chrysler
in the machine on showtime.

200
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,233
Then 11

201
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,710
respect to the machine.

202
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,230
I get a cut of the Nachos,

203
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:58,580
so get some Nachos.

204
00:06:58,581 --> 00:06:59,414
They're very good.

205
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,850
They squeezed that by hand.

206
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:02,540
That sauce.

207
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,960
I feel about Nachos at the comedy store
the same way I feel about whoever the

208
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:06,561
fuck wins.

209
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:07,394
President.

210
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,363
Alright,

211
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,920
got to do what you gotta do,

212
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:12,490
man.

213
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,750
Press real younger.

214
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,720
If the president really affects your life,

215
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,970
you've made poor choices or you met him.

216
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,650
What if you met that
Guy Jon Stewart thing?

217
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,700
50 years old.

218
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,230
But you see the Jon Stewart thing,

219
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,180
your muscles don't know it.

220
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,410
Jon Stewart,

221
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,700
Jon Stewart,

222
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,030
uh,

223
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,740
did some veterans show and on the veterans
show he read out this tweet exchange

224
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,820
he had with Donald Trump.

225
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,990
It's like in his ass now.

226
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,370
It's fucking hilarious.

227
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,860
And Donald Trump's tweets
him at one 30 in the morning.

228
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:46,520
Little Jon Stewart is a pussy and
we'll be hopeless in a debate with me.

229
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,700
And he's a liar because
he changed his name.

230
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,511
That would go,

231
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,380
that's the best joke.

232
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,100
Cause he goes,

233
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,280
his real name's Jon Stewart or his real
name is John [inaudible] and Burger

234
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:55,730
whatever.

235
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,670
Liebowitz Chin.

236
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,610
And then Jon Stewart wrote back,

237
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,010
John Jay,

238
00:07:59,010 --> 00:07:59,843
that's right.

239
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,960
And Donald Trump's real name is fuck
face bond sticker with by clowns.

240
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,170
Stick mouth.

241
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,350
Fuckface von clowns thinking he doesn't
know why he won't embrace the von

242
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:09,760
clowns.

243
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,910
Pick camp heritage.

244
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,510
And at the end of it,

245
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,900
one 30 in the morning,

246
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,660
Trump tweets him at one 30 in the morning.

247
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,370
Little Jon Stewart is a pussy

248
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,460
and we'd be hopeless in a debate with me.

249
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,350
I wouldn't even

250
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,670
I,

251
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,180
I'm,

252
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,950
I'm going to,

253
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,130
I'll be the dude.

254
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,330
That means he was walking
around talking to himself.

255
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,691
Yes,

256
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:28,821
they,

257
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:29,350
they,

258
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,920
they debriefed him for the next
presidential thing and he goes,

259
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:33,430
all right,

260
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,390
I will see you later.

261
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,140
And he closed the doors walking around
in his gold toed socks and his fucking

262
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:38,974
hotel room.

263
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,760
Fucking noodle took off with
saying I'm a fucking asshole.

264
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,880
He had probably some woman.

265
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:46,540
They're going,

266
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,250
Donald Telco on the Internet

267
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,861
is shit.

268
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:52,240
I'm not taking this shit from him.

269
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,130
Fucking liberal media.

270
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,210
I fucking tweaking this thing out here.

271
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,340
We probably like it all down below.

272
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,950
What's worse is he was really to do that.

273
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,240
Who is doing that?

274
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,780
Is the system following him around?

275
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,640
Tell no che dish.

276
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:08,911
No,

277
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:09,744
don't hit send.

278
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,360
Yeah.

279
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,170
Shay Desk.

280
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,120
Who Buy your pussy?

281
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,080
I'll fuck it on its head.

282
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,993
Don't hit send.

283
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,703
That's Mr. Trump.

284
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,290
That's going to have the red phone.

285
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,000
That's going to have the red phone dude

286
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,590
him and five whatever Vladimir,

287
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,230
whatever that fucking Russian
dude's name is like vitamin.

288
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:30,060
You wait till one time
when his fucking off,

289
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:31,530
he'll call him on the red phone.

290
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,700
Well,

291
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,740
I think we're going to find out if
that guy can really do anything.

292
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,100
Like we never really knew if the president
can actually do anything because they

293
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:45,770
always seem to promise one thing and they
get an officer to a totally different

294
00:09:45,771 --> 00:09:46,220
deal.

295
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,120
Once they're inside,

296
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,680
we're going to find out what this guy,

297
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,540
if he really gets in there,

298
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,920
he's going to start talking shit.

299
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,061
Oh.

300
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:56,250
Like from inside the White House talking
shit about how the government works so

301
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:57,290
they won't do his bidding.

302
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,140
It's going to get really fucking weird.

303
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:00,770
Oh,

304
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,640
you're going to hear that to that,

305
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,060
uh,

306
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,190
that the song by Bachman Turner overdrive,

307
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,630
you ain't seen nothing yet.

308
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,250
She shows you how fragile this
group of people really is.

309
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,340
This weird group of people
that we call America.

310
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,620
We're about to elect a douchebag.

311
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,270
Either wipe verifiable,

312
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,980
but upside Joe is,

313
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,990
we'll probably get to
see an assassination.

314
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,430
Oh,

315
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,060
hey,

316
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:30,331
no,

317
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:30,590

318
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:35,390

319
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,690

What do we got?

324
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,733

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,653

Justin.

331
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,340
Bert Kreischer special Friday night.

332
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,193
Showtime

333
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,900
rejoices wait too fucking high for this.

334
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,960
November 11 and Gary Johnson
is that 3.7% and when

335
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,840

338
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,740
Well the second time you

342
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,660
Gary Johnson.

343
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:29,260
Why?

344
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,180
Cause he follows me on Twitter.

345
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,830
That's reason enough.

346
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:33,843
There you go.

347
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,320
Yes.

348
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,300
Come on ladies.

349
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,110
You tell me.

350
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,943
Stop.

351
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:38,671
Take your whip.

352
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:39,241
My Dick.

353
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,360
Stop voting with your
vagina or vote Jill Stein.

354
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,250
That map looks like somebody hit one
of those avatar people with a truck.

355
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,460
I'm just killing me all the college ways.

356
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,840
How to glue thing.

357
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,560
Bladder of non readers.

358
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,470
You can't turn that towards,

359
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,600
you know,

360
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,380
I want to Greg Fitzsimmons to see this.

361
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:05,681
Greg,

362
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:08,250
you recognize all those were
all best shoe at territory's.

363
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,040
Remember that we had this college agent,

364
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:11,471
great guy,

365
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,600
but he used a book us in the
middle of fucking nowhere.

366
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,840
He'd always call me Billy Scott Bass
calling half a Gig for you in Rhinelander,

367
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:19,984
Wisconsin.

368
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,420
Now they don't have a lot of money,

369
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,060
but I can build around it
and then he won't be stage.

370
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,990
It's at 12 noon in a hallway.

371
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,853
Can you do it?

372
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,650
Always take it.

373
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,311
And then I'd call,

374
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:34,270
I'm going to be yelling at him.

375
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,250
I'm never fucking doing
one of those gigs again.

376
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:36,491
Blah Blah.

377
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:38,560
And you would just fit on the
road sign and this is going.

378
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:38,741
Yeah,

379
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:39,360
you're will.

380
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,193
You're broke.

381
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,440
You're on a futon.

382
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:42,274
Guy Is an age

383
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,181
so sharp.

384
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:43,730
He's a,

385
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,220
he's in Chicago and I call him.

386
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:45,941
He's great dude.

387
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:46,541
I don't want to trash,

388
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:46,691
you know,

389
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:47,261
he's great,

390
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:48,450
but here's how sharp he is.

391
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,170
I called up and I go,

392
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:50,590
uh,

393
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:50,930
I go,

394
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,260
Louie CK needs a college agent.

395
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,011
And this is like,

396
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:55,810
Louie had already had a special ed too,

397
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:56,830
but he wasn't quite there.

398
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:57,520
And he goes,

399
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,750
he's too old.

400
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,610
I call it to this day going,

401
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:01,450
you fucking

402
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,420
and when you send them the map,

403
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,960
he kept getting them gigs in
like South Dakota and Wyoming.

404
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:09,920
He was living in New York.

405
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:12,710
He sent him a map of the United
States and circled Manhattan.

406
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:13,220
He goes,

407
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,180
I lived here.

408
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,380
They could never get us a Gig in New York.

409
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,780
Barry Katz at an all fucking sewn up.

410
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,093
Oh my God,

411
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,590
Christ.

412
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,180
And I got,

413
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,280
I got a Gig in Grand Junction,

414
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:26,240
Colorado.

415
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:26,991
Dude,

416
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:30,920
I remember he had half asleep driving
like 90 in the wrong direction in Colorado

417
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:35,300
trying to make this fucking gig and this
dude and like a Bronco drove right at

418
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:36,740
me with like a little blue light.

419
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,881
Pulls me over.

420
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:39,290
He gets out all he has on his,

421
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,310
the cop shirt,

422
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,550
he's got it like jeans and and no hat and
he walks up and he punches the window.

423
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:48,050
He goes out like yelling at me.

424
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,651
I'm like,

425
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:50,390
is this guy going to fucking shoot me?

426
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,970
So fucking lunatic.

427
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:55,580
And then I had to turn around to
go up to where the fuck Greeley,

428
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,470
where they really a good guy.

429
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,860
They got a fucking a w when
they slaughter pigs and shit,

430
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,170
they actually had bad smell days,

431
00:14:03,171 --> 00:14:05,720
whether you call the
slaughter house and be like,

432
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:06,081
Hey,

433
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:07,100
can you take it easy?

434
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:09,800
A little slow it the smell,

435
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,530
it dries my daughter cry.

436
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,030
Can you do it?

437
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,470
I can build around it.

438
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:18,890
Yeah,

439
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,330
I got you at noon in Wisconsin that night.

440
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,020
North Dakota.

441
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,420
It's a nine hour drive,

442
00:14:26,421 --> 00:14:28,340
but if you leave right after the Gig,

443
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,650
they give you the check beforehand.

444
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:31,484
You can make it,

445
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:32,721
sorry,

446
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:34,480
this is just getting so inside the last,

447
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,420
so just dropping,

448
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,793
dropping,

449
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,330
forcing me into a Gig.

450
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,530
I was going to say,

451
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,050
hang on there talking about these gigs.

452
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:42,460
She's like,

453
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,550
they're the old days.

454
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,950
We just both played a fucking,

455
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:46,771
see how she,

456
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:50,690
two weeks ago she food
restaurant in Fayetteville.

457
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:52,680
Fucking Arkansas sign.

458
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,000
There's a sign next to the
restaurant and it says three dogs.

459
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,940
I got once we,

460
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,110
I did one in Cheyenne,

461
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:03,944
Wyoming.

462
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,790
They had a drive through liquor store
that was connected to a strip club.

463
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,440
So you're looking in and you're
seeing the dances walking around.

464
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,081
The guy says,

465
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:12,621
sly look,

466
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:13,454
and I get for you

467
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,771
for the record.

468
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:17,100
The drive throughs in was

469
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,980
you can get a mixed drink in
Wyoming and a drive through,

470
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,880
but they put a cover on
the drink and put tape.

471
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,010
So

472
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,843
wait,

473
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,540
it's a sealed beverage

474
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:29,571
by the way.

475
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:31,280
There's 30 minutes of me doing this

476
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,520
oyster shack in four weeks ago

477
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,411
with Joe and I.

478
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:46,620
He started out in a club called Nick's
comedy stop that may or may not have been

479
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:51,621
mob run and the back of the club was
prostitutes cause it was in the red light

480
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:52,921
district.

481
00:15:52,921 --> 00:15:57,510
They'd come in out of the coal and cops
shoulder to shoulder watching comedy.

482
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,920
That was a crazy place.

483
00:15:59,130 --> 00:15:59,760
Yeah,

484
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,950
I missed all the good days.

485
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:03,210
It's by the time I got there it
was like the whole boom was over.

486
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,110
Yeah,

487
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,300
I did a Shitty Gig once.

488
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,200
It was a one and done Boston comics.

489
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:08,650
We're never going to
get a word in edgewise.

490
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,880
Remember Lenny Clarke

491
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,990
shout over your sport coat.

492
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,880
[inaudible].

493
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,511
Lenny's brother,

494
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:27,320
Mike Clarke booked me on a ton of gigs
and one of them was in a restaurant and

495
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:28,520
it was a seating area.

496
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,850
It's like the area where people see it
and waited for the name to be called this

497
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:36,530
giant fish place down in the Cape and
your sound system on stage was connected

498
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:36,970
to the,

499
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,690
the closer the wire system course it was
so the PA system and they said they all

500
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:45,350
use this same speaker but they would
override you so you'd be in the middle of

501
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:45,951
doing a joke.

502
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:48,980
Then John 10 party and the table's ready.

503
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:50,610
Johnson too afraid

504
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,370
to go back in again a second time.

505
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,200
It was a one and done.

506
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,840
I did a Gig at a red lobster

507
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,870
like a Sunday night and it was all
these bibs on and shit and we're in the

508
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:09,704
corner.

509
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,660
We just on this little roped off corn,

510
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:12,620
hey fucking fuck,

511
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,910
fuck fucking into this mic.

512
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,370
And he's just looking over like,

513
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:17,140
what is that?

514
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,530
Is that part of the restaurant?

515
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:19,364
It was just like,

516
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,290
no,

517
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,440
you weren't angry waiter and you wanted
to laugh at the person going on in front

518
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:24,591
of you,

519
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:26,590
but like you couldn't get
past the fact of like,

520
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,210
I have to do that in 10
minutes when he's done,

521
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,350
that's going to be me.

522
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:32,330
So you can never totally fucking enjoy it.

523
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,150
But anyways,

524
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,270
Trump has 2002

525
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,870
0.3 and Clinton has 1.8 in Ohio.

526
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,640
Oh my God.

527
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,863
Holy Shit.

528
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,250
He's going to win Ohio.

529
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,020
I was just in Dayton last week.

530
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:49,560
That doesn't help plug help.

531
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,040
That's

532
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,910
a good barometer.

533
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:57,230
This is honestly when I made it in
comedy was when I could turn down Dayton,

534
00:17:58,621 --> 00:17:59,454
Ohio,

535
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,520
Lisa Grigsby.

536
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,610
That's number one.

537
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:02,320
That was my thing.

538
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,180
When I sit down,

539
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,320
fuck you guys.

540
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:04,820
Okay,

541
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,760
I don't wait.

542
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,880
And they papered the room.

543
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,630
Everybody should [inaudible]
status and the paper,

544
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:13,051
the room,

545
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,960
those are like the worst
words you ever want to miss.

546
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,350
Misread my contract.

547
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,630
And I got in the car after
Bob and Tom and I go,

548
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:19,261
how's the week look?

549
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:19,830
And they go,

550
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,090
fucking fantastic.

551
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,560
Were oversold on every show.

552
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:23,160
And I went,

553
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,270
when did I blow up?

554
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,130
And then we got there and they were like,

555
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:26,340
yeah,

556
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:26,941
the paper,

557
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:28,740
the whole room and no
one paid for tickets.

558
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:29,140
And I was like,

559
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,000
motherfucker,

560
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,880
I get 75% of nothing.

561
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,190
Are there comedians,

562
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:34,780
comedians in the house?

563
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,730
If you're here,

564
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,500
that the front room of jokers in Dayton,

565
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:41,800
Dayton,

566
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,040
home of the ultimate Bachelorette party,

567
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,370
which is the death knell of comedy,

568
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,580
but they sell and they
would sell dildo hats.

569
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,433
Oh Shit.

570
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,321
Oh,

571
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:57,610
horse fucking club draws the second you
saw him with the Little Dick Straws.

572
00:18:57,611 --> 00:18:58,840
You just like this fucking show.

573
00:18:58,841 --> 00:18:59,530
It's going to be brutal.

574
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,780
I got to hang in there
for 45 fucking minutes.

575
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,850
You know some people need a sitcom.

576
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,880
I just needed a never have to work
date men had rubber vagina hat.

577
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,480
Imagine the brutal outrage dudes
running around licking fake pussy.

578
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,053
Yeah,

579
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,550
probably look a lot like Donald Trump.

580
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,000
I need a cigarette anyway.

581
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:26,391
Hey,

582
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:27,620
this is how this goes.

583
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,140
We have no fucking idea how this goes,

584
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,060
but we're going to
rotate a bunch of people.

585
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:33,620
You don't have to discuss this.

586
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:34,454
I think they get it,

587
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,760
but I'm bringing someone in and
watching a shit show on to Jim.

588
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,160
Jefferies brought his stupid baby buddies.

589
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,370
I didn't smoke on stage.

590
00:19:47,371 --> 00:19:48,300
You don't bring babies,

591
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:48,550
Jeff.

592
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,383
Jeff Rose.

593
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,553
You know what?

594
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,123
He's not here.

595
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,570
I need to bring my cost in.

596
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,980
He probably wants to say shit,

597
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:05,260
but I gotta have him on stage.

598
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:06,094
Chad Shag.

599
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,563
Yeah,

600
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,041
Garber for me.

601
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:11,874
I'll tell him,

602
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,441
by the way,

603
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:13,951
I will keep,

604
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,784
you want to browse?

605
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:15,350
Oh,

606
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,183
the kids

607
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,420
stays in the picture.

608
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,430
Okay.

609
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,880
I don't think this is the right kind
of air for this child to be British.

610
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,683
Hey Jim.

611
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,130
Jim Jeffery's

612
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:33,701
board kid.

613
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:34,390
Hide the dry.

614
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,390
I was just driving by with my kid and
I popped it in very quickly and he's

615
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:40,270
being,

616
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,230
you can go and sit on my lap.

617
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:42,070
Do I come and sit on my lap?

618
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,010
Don't let the kids touch the booze.

619
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:44,500
Yeah,

620
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,333
it's all right.

621
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,220
This is legal.

622
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,580
These fucking these kid.

623
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,723
Hey,

624
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,890
I think we just violated the new laws.

625
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,880
This is like that Hillary commercial
where they had the little kids watching

626
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:55,714
politics.

627
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,250
Bullshit.

628
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,750
Little kids don't watch politics.

629
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,584
There you go.

630
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,660
It's all about the future.

631
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,110
Oh,

632
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,670
I'm not comfortable with this.

633
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,280
You're not comfortable
with what we're doing.

634
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,310
Trump's Trump's winning New Hampshire.

635
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,310
Hillary's winning Virginia.

636
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,060
Really?

637
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,440
And there's a little kid here

638
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,690
decided it was good idea.

639
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,160
Somebody please take a
photo of this last supper

640
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,400
here.

641
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,180
Here's my phone.

642
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,230
I think this is the lead.

643
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,340
I don't want that on.

644
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,031
Why is it illegal?

645
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:32,930
What's illegal about this?

646
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:35,970
Having a baby on stage while people
are drinking booze and smoking pot.

647
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,063
We're fucking,

648
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,851
what am I crazy?

649
00:21:37,851 --> 00:21:39,390
I would've been good to stay off Mike.

650
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,141
Oh,

651
00:21:42,141 --> 00:21:42,530
they've got,

652
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,300
there's some legality problems.

653
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,293
Ah,

654
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,443
yeah.

655
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:48,850
Hey,

656
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,090
it's Brad Williams up here.

657
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:50,451
Why not?

658
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:51,284
Huh?

659
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,490
We're going to go everyone.

660
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,410
Sorry about that.

661
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:59,110
Sorry for losing the liquor
license comedy store.

662
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,273
Uh,

663
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,260
yeah.

664
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,093
Just try.

665
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,960
How's Australia looking at this point?

666
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,340
This shit.

667
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,173
Sorry.

668
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,480
All right.

669
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,230
We'll see you guys say
about Jim Jefferies.

670
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,103
Lazy Gentlemen.

671
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,123
All right.

672
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,800
Captain questionable judgment.

673
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,740
That was about as comfortable as
putting a condom on at an orgy.

674
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,950
Got It.

675
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,340
That's a good fucking line
line of the night so far.

676
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,430
I think that's totally illegal,

677
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:29,264
right?

678
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:29,661
Thank you.

679
00:22:29,661 --> 00:22:30,890
And have a fucking baby

680
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,960
while people are talking
about eating fake pussies.

681
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,950
Be responsible for that.

682
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,513
I didn't.

683
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,653
We shut up

684
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,540
Jesus fucking Christ.

685
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,041
Awesome Mike.

686
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:49,371
Dude,

687
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:51,250
he's like every contract or every work.

688
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:51,941
Hold on.

689
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:52,790
My kids are calling.

690
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:53,121
Hey,

691
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,070
why don't you guys come down?

692
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,880
Oh Shit that happened.

693
00:22:58,881 --> 00:22:59,411
Thank God.

694
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,760
Before the child came out.

695
00:23:00,761 --> 00:23:01,660
Agreed,

696
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,613
agreed.

697
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:02,921
We all,

698
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:03,770
you all saw it.

699
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:05,501
Jesus.

700
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:05,741
Great.

701
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:05,981
There you go.

702
00:23:05,981 --> 00:23:06,691
So what does it mean?

703
00:23:06,691 --> 00:23:07,511
It definitely did,

704
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,030
but joints right there.

705
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,270
I got to say these pictures.

706
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,370
This is the best picture Donald Trump.

707
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:16,630
Best Picture of Hillary Clinton and
best picture of the other guy I've seen

708
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:17,710
throughout this entire thing.

709
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,020
Donald actually has a nice smile.

710
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:20,890
Hillary looks nice.

711
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:21,724
You know,

712
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,280
cause he always made them
look like fucking lunatics.

713
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,880
Did you guys see the picture of
Donald watching his wife vote?

714
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,380
A lot of trust in that relationship.

715
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,120
That's the same look I give my dog
when he gets too close to my cat.

716
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,950
Okay,

717
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,070
well what are you doing mother fucker?

718
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,913
Leave her alone.

719
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,210
Okay.

720
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:49,421
Oh,

721
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:50,920
I got way too high for this podcast.

722
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,240
You know that thing that
you have to do to dogs.

723
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,560
You have to do that to dogs.

724
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,371
Dogs,

725
00:23:57,371 --> 00:23:58,540
you have to be their best friend,

726
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,160
but you have to love them to death.

727
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:01,210
But every now and then you got to go,

728
00:24:01,211 --> 00:24:02,044
hey bitch,

729
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,851
he hit him.

730
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:04,071
Just go,

731
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:04,940
listen motherfucker.

732
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:06,761
If you don't,

733
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:07,600
the eat your cat,

734
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,050
right?

735
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:08,411
Hey,

736
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:09,244
look who's back.

737
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,600
Update time.

738
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,710
They've called Ohio 18
electoral votes from Ohio.

739
00:24:14,711 --> 00:24:17,020
Go to Donald Trump.

740
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,070
Oh Shit.

741
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,860
Oh Shit.

742
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,283
There you go.

743
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:24,750
Okay,

744
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,670
so I've got to be a few
happy people here tonight.

745
00:24:26,671 --> 00:24:27,504
You know this,

746
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,973
this isn't good.

747
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,170
This isn't a good barometer of America.

748
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,290
Come on Hollywood and sunset.

749
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,610
Yeah.

750
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,930
Can we all agree this
doesn't fucking work.

751
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,993
I mean,

752
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,340
you can't have one guy

753
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,440
wholesale,

754
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:44,750
right?

755
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,680
Hey d,

756
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,070
you can't have one woman.

757
00:24:54,071 --> 00:24:54,731
You can't have one.

758
00:24:54,731 --> 00:24:56,140
Anybody run the whole thing?

759
00:24:56,141 --> 00:24:57,370
It's fucking crazy.

760
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,350
It's some crazy alpha chimp position.

761
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,710
We should have got rid of this
fucking stupid job a long time ago.

762
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,690
It's not how you should ever run anything.

763
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,150
You should never have one fucking person.

764
00:25:07,151 --> 00:25:08,230
Ladies and gentlemen,

765
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,700
the most important.

766
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,553
Burn

767
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,753
me.

768
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,230
You fucked.

769
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,340
I run this bitch.

770
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,100
That's a crazy position.

771
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,010
Nobody should have that
position and most importantly,

772
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,900
nobody should want that fucking position.

773
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:23,941
Yeah,

774
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:27,060
but doesn't the Senate representatives
and it's at the balance there.

775
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:28,080
They keep checks and balances.

776
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:31,950
Vaguely remember that for my history
class and like fifth grade and then they

777
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:32,970
send it to the thing.

778
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:34,050
I'm just a bill.

779
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,621
Yes.

780
00:25:34,621 --> 00:25:37,170
I'm only a bill and it goes to the thing.

781
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:37,800
Right,

782
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,270
and they fucking go around.

783
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,790
Congratulations Bill.

784
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,560
Now you're a law.

785
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,780
That's what keeps them in check.

786
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,633
Yeah.

787
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,700
I think the school schoolhouse rock,

788
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,980
I think we should vote on the Internet.

789
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,260
I think we should vote on
everything on the Internet.

790
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,460
I think everybody should collectively
decide what the fuck we should be doing.

791
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,010
The guy that was driving
me an Uber tonight,

792
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:03,671
I go,

793
00:26:03,671 --> 00:26:04,840
you fall the election and he goes,

794
00:26:04,841 --> 00:26:05,141
yeah,

795
00:26:05,141 --> 00:26:05,740
a little bit.

796
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,280
I said,

797
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,611
I said,

798
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:06,890
really?

799
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:07,121
He goes,

800
00:26:07,121 --> 00:26:07,900
yeah,

801
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,260
when did,

802
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,250
when did those start

803
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,711
today?

804
00:26:13,711 --> 00:26:14,071
And he goes,

805
00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:16,950
how long has it lasts till I go to today?

806
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:18,991
What is it?

807
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:19,920
Here's my question.

808
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,320
Ready lasts for like five fucking days.

809
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,240
It's so complicated.

810
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,320
He said a little bit,

811
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,240
literally meant a little bit.

812
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,530
I want to be that guy,

813
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:29,100
dude,

814
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,680
that's a fucking great guy to beat.

815
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,370
You know it is.

816
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,780
If you're all right with it.

817
00:26:33,781 --> 00:26:35,010
Just like once the election.

818
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:35,670
Well,

819
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,170
I thought how long does it last?

820
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,083
Really?

821
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,313
I thought he was

822
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,010
driving is don't give a shit.

823
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,090
Literally it was like a how so how do
you get set up in to do and being able to

824
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:51,690
vote and I want it when you get a
little driver's license and Mike,

825
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,770
you're driving fucking Luber,

826
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:53,940
you definitely have a driver's license.

827
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,940
And then he goes,

828
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,340
who's,

829
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,360
I probably did that.

830
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:57,751
And I go,

831
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:58,340
yeah,

832
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,850
but he had dark hair and big eyebrows.

833
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,170
So I said the valley.

834
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:01,611
So I go,

835
00:27:01,611 --> 00:27:02,250
so where are you?

836
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:02,641
Where did you,

837
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:03,271
where were you born?

838
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:04,104
And he goes,

839
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,610
if fucking van Nuys.

840
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,310
And I was like,

841
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,120
are you really don't
know anything about this.

842
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:09,361
He's like,

843
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,290
not anything

844
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,723
like,

845
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,760
why do we do it this way?

846
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,653
I gotta tell you something,

847
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:20,381
dude,

848
00:27:20,381 --> 00:27:21,131
if Trump wins,

849
00:27:21,131 --> 00:27:22,860
this is the him just winning the,

850
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,420
the nominee blows away.

851
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:27,010
Anything I've ever seen in sports.

852
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,780
The US beating the Russians.

853
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,270
It's just all pales in comparison.

854
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,670
This is a reality TV show star

855
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,830
who got mad at a breakfast because
Obama trash to him and he's like,

856
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:39,780
well fuck it dude.

857
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,720
He's going to do it

858
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,210
like it or not.

859
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,073
That is some,

860
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,470
you can't talk shit in
the room with that guy.

861
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,240
Yo.

862
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,790
One time this guy stepped
me in the bar to fuck you.

863
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,800
What time the president was
giving me shit and I said,

864
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:57,161
Oh yeah,

865
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:58,390
I'll have you a fucking job.

866
00:27:58,391 --> 00:27:59,970
And two years and I did it

867
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,420
and I did it.

868
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,110
Fucking real man.

869
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,800
Don't like his policies.

870
00:28:11,801 --> 00:28:13,690
But you gotta respect the Jesus.

871
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,221
Hey Bill.

872
00:28:15,221 --> 00:28:18,190
If you want someone to go on stage with
you and just sit on a stool and laugh,

873
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:18,801
I'll do it.

874
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:19,634
Yeah.

875
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,550
So is this

876
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,100
the fate of our nation that
those little gray areas,

877
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,200
those bitches that like
this is always what happens?

878
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,720
Does the red guys do well in the middle?

879
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,120
The blue people do all
right in the beginning,

880
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,020
right?

881
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,900
But the east coast and all of
a sudden they get into the SCC,

882
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:36,230
right.

883
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,460
Going to be swapping some pain.

884
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,830
Then the red guys start coming back.

885
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:42,550
Then,

886
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,160
uh,

887
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,461
then,

888
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:43,581
then,

889
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:44,071
then you get,

890
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:44,910
hey man,

891
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:46,800
you start getting near
the fucking ocean man.

892
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:49,230
And like I live near her notion,

893
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:51,030
therefore I'm smarter man.

894
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,120
That comes around and then
it gets a little more blue.

895
00:28:54,121 --> 00:28:57,750
So this saying over all by a long shot,

896
00:28:57,751 --> 00:28:58,584
ladies and gentlemen,

897
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,840
we shall see.

898
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,443
It's just so,

899
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,830
let's say they shitting on CNN right now.

900
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,880
If you're watching at home,

901
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:06,960
you want to put on CNN,

902
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:08,700
you got to watch the channel
where they're losing.

903
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:09,690
That's the funny shit.

904
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,360
Happiness is not enjoyable.

905
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:13,980
You want to see nervousness.

906
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,510
Beads of sweat.

907
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,050
Blue ties me in high.

908
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,550
Wouldn't you like to take a peek at all
the comics from the UCBS Twitter right

909
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:23,200
now?

910
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,590
Oh,

911
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,423
oh God.

912
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,230
They're fucking over dramatic

913
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,510
Hashtag I'm with her.

914
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,803
Oh Huh.

915
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,140
Hashtag I'm with her.

916
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,993
Do you love anymore?

917
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,110
Anyone can do it.

918
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,210
Can you get Gary Johnson on the phone?

919
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,073
Yeah,

920
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,283
yeah,

921
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,143
right.

922
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,273
Yeah.

923
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,440
10 Times more Twitter followers.

924
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,340
Yeah,

925
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:48,881
but he's not,

926
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:49,301
he's like,

927
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:52,540
he's CNNS bitch now already
got like 9% of the vote.

928
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,010
Just from your Twitter followers.

929
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:54,761
Oh,

930
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:55,450
fuck me.

931
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,283
No,

932
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,450
I'm kidding you about
him being CNNS bitch.

933
00:29:58,451 --> 00:29:59,284
I voted for him,

934
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,863
but uh,

935
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,360
I couldn't get them know Arizona's pink.

936
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,733
Who's busy

937
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,590
sort of a bandaid color.

938
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,520
I don't know what that means.

939
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,900
Is that the whole fucking election?

940
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,970
That's Photoshop my space.

941
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,970
That's what bill [inaudible].

942
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,863
It's all lit.

943
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:18,963
It's lightened up.

944
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:19,271
It was like,

945
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:22,480
what did she look like this back in
the 90s that's like one of those mall

946
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:25,700
portrait photographers in
front of a shitty fake.

947
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,060
That's a fucking great photo.

948
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,080
So does anybody,

949
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,220
what is the numbers here?

950
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:38,221
One 67 for Donald Trump won
2140 to 70 she's 103 away.

951
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,800
Hope but he's kicking her ass.

952
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,551
I know,

953
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:43,001
but it's great.

954
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:43,840
It's Obama was,

955
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:44,800
did he ever call you?

956
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,150
Did he ever check in on
you to make sure you okay.

957
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:49,901
At the end of the day,

958
00:30:49,901 --> 00:30:50,734
it's on you.

959
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,690
Who's packing your lunch tomorrow?

960
00:30:52,691 --> 00:30:53,320
People.

961
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,990
You are who's putting food on the table?

962
00:30:55,991 --> 00:30:56,711
You are all right.

963
00:30:56,711 --> 00:30:58,120
You don't need these fucking people.

964
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,043
Yeah,

965
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,023
it's fine.

966
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:04,951
Having said that,

967
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:05,784
this is amazing.

968
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:06,870
Look at Michigan.

969
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:11,871
He won Michigan 49% she's got 45% this
is going to take the fucking hook and

970
00:31:13,891 --> 00:31:16,140
lateral statue of liberty and a hail Mary.

971
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,093
He's the head.

972
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,750
He's the head by two
points is going to win.

973
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,570
Huh?

974
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,340
Think he's going to win.

975
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:23,730
Yeah.

976
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,800
It's entirely possible.

977
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,520
Or Fuck I told you.

978
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,070
Why don't we get to San
Francisco and all of them,

979
00:31:29,071 --> 00:31:29,641
man.

980
00:31:29,641 --> 00:31:30,600
We'll see what happens.

981
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,450
They saved the Toric Lens for the
end so they didn't build it up

982
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,900
and slide it out right in the beginning.

983
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,270
Are you saying there's a
Goddamn conspiracy son?

984
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,680
The conspiracy is that
we still do it this way.

985
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,260
Why don't we just have
everybody have an opinion?

986
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:49,681
Well,

987
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:51,940
you know we don't have a coach and buggies

988
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,870
across the country.

989
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:55,681
Joe.

990
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:56,580
How many down the road?

991
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,160
Too long to believe that
everyone should happen at Amazon.

992
00:31:59,161 --> 00:31:59,994
One Click,

993
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,950
how come I can't vote like that?

994
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,560
I can buy toilet paper.

995
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:08,010
They deliver it to your house
in a day with one click.

996
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,053
I could bank

997
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,461
your bank.

998
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:11,880
You could just,

999
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,020
you can do whatever you want.

1000
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,080
You can pick up on line.

1001
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,050
I don't give a shit.

1002
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:17,550
Yeah,

1003
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,440
I did it online.

1004
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:21,360
It's crazy money online,

1005
00:32:21,361 --> 00:32:22,410
but you can't handle votes.

1006
00:32:22,411 --> 00:32:23,550
That's ridiculous.

1007
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,200
I bought a car part of it.

1008
00:32:25,201 --> 00:32:25,981
They took out a thing.

1009
00:32:25,981 --> 00:32:28,620
They wanted to take my thumbprint
when I my fingerprints,

1010
00:32:28,621 --> 00:32:29,790
you freak out and I was like,

1011
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:30,030
yeah,

1012
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,863
I'm not doing that.

1013
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:31,501
I go,

1014
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:32,251
why would I do that?

1015
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:32,551
And they go,

1016
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:32,850
well,

1017
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,450
she's just took your notes to protect you
in case somebody comes in and a person

1018
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:37,440
they choose to buy a car.

1019
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:37,891
It's just like,

1020
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:38,310
yeah,

1021
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,900
I want to take my on that

1022
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,710
fucking moron.

1023
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,350
I'm going to get my fingerprint
to a car dealership.

1024
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,060
You guys are the biggest
liars in the world,

1025
00:32:48,061 --> 00:32:49,410
so you can just pick it on some date.

1026
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:50,550
Rape victims forehead.

1027
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,430
Oh No,

1028
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,740
I just want a Chevy cavalier and my name.

1029
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,633
Oh,

1030
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,790
there's no jail time on that.

1031
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:03,300
That's just payments.

1032
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,960
Got to pay for an escort gt.

1033
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,530
Are you one of those guys?

1034
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:15,720
It's free to use a thumb
sensor on your cell phone.

1035
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,400
Do you have like an older cell phone?

1036
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,271
I'm not afraid.

1037
00:33:18,271 --> 00:33:18,571
I'm just,

1038
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:19,404
I just don't do it.

1039
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:21,541
No.

1040
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,860
Two or three skin man.

1041
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:23,680
What's the phone to do?

1042
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:23,860
No,

1043
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,170
I don't use your cloud.

1044
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,380
I dropped my phone in a fucking
toilet and I lost everything.

1045
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,940
I lost all my videos,

1046
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:30,631
all my numbers,

1047
00:33:30,631 --> 00:33:30,871
everything.

1048
00:33:30,871 --> 00:33:32,790
Cause I don't use the fucking
cloud whenever they say,

1049
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:33,541
is it okay if we,

1050
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:33,781
you know,

1051
00:33:33,781 --> 00:33:34,591
see you location?

1052
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:34,831
No,

1053
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:35,370
it isn't.

1054
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,380
When I go to those things and they go,

1055
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:37,711
hey,

1056
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:39,510
you want a little savy saved card?

1057
00:33:39,511 --> 00:33:39,841
I say,

1058
00:33:39,841 --> 00:33:40,200
no,

1059
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,610
I don't fuck off.

1060
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,260
And whenever they ask me questions,

1061
00:33:43,261 --> 00:33:44,730
if I'm in the mood to answer,

1062
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,110
I give them misinformation.

1063
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,000
I go all over the place.

1064
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,130
All over the place.

1065
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,623
You should

1066
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,413
relationship.

1067
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,680
I like deer hunting.

1068
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,730
I just got back from Antarctica.

1069
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,280
Anything just to throw them off the scent.

1070
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,080
What's your mother's maiden name?

1071
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,193
Whoa.

1072
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,430
Barney Miller.

1073
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,263
Big Fan.

1074
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,350
So why would you help him?

1075
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,273
Okay,

1076
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,493
that's a good point.

1077
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,120
It's undeniable

1078
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,953
recoveries.

1079
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,041
No,

1080
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:31,874
I got to quit.

1081
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,580
I have a great Facebook page.

1082
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:34,151
It's so great.

1083
00:34:34,151 --> 00:34:35,710
I almost stood up to tell it to you.

1084
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,081
They fucking,

1085
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:40,690
I go to change my password
because I'm so sick of my,

1086
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,740
you know Kevin,

1087
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:42,640
58 of them.

1088
00:34:42,641 --> 00:34:42,851
Right.

1089
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:43,151
And I'm like,

1090
00:34:43,151 --> 00:34:44,410
when I just pick three,

1091
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,120
it just stick with that.

1092
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:46,461
So I go,

1093
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:46,631
all right,

1094
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:47,321
I'm going to change it.

1095
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:48,670
Then all of a sudden
they send me an email.

1096
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:48,911
They go,

1097
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:49,091
yeah,

1098
00:34:49,091 --> 00:34:52,150
we lock this shit just
in case it is in you.

1099
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,163
But if you want it,

1100
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:56,890
you got to send us a picture of you
and like your fucking task court.

1101
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,031
And it's just like,

1102
00:34:58,031 --> 00:34:58,330
yeah,

1103
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,470
go fuck yourself.

1104
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,700
I'm not doing that.

1105
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,410
So for like a week I couldn't do it.

1106
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,850
And then after like 10 days,

1107
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,950
it was cool to be back on it
again cause it kind of like,

1108
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,120
oh he's not coming back.

1109
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:07,221
We,

1110
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:08,054
we need them,

1111
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,640
we need them.

1112
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,360
So we clicked on revenue and
top 10 were celebrity boob jobs.

1113
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,620
So we make our money.

1114
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,660
How come they needed a 10 days ago,

1115
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:16,841
Joe?

1116
00:35:16,841 --> 00:35:17,980
And all of a sudden
they don't need it now.

1117
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,090
And I'm on Facebook again.

1118
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,090
Why is that

1119
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,020
point as well?

1120
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,400
You're making some great points.

1121
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:22,731
I am.

1122
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:25,640
I'm making tremendous points and
I hear the sarcasm in your voice.

1123
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,503
No,

1124
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,463
no.

1125
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,490
He goes down.

1126
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,220
Oh,

1127
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,620
me smokes a little fucking
weed and all of a sudden I'm,

1128
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,550
I'm the Moron in the rock.

1129
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,930
Oh,

1130
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,511
I haven't said that.

1131
00:35:41,511 --> 00:35:42,950
I still need that shoulder workout.

1132
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,833
You don't telling me about him?

1133
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,110
I worry about the fingerprint thing.

1134
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:48,740
It's weird.

1135
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,190
It's weird.

1136
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,300
You put Gary Johnson,

1137
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:51,650
just one Puerto Rico.

1138
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,023
Okay.

1139
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,520
Powerful.

1140
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,353
Puerto Rico.

1141
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:03,200
Puerto Rico is like one strange child
that you had with your mistress,

1142
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:04,490
so you don't really like to talk about,

1143
00:36:04,491 --> 00:36:05,330
but you give them money.

1144
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,061
They're not really,

1145
00:36:08,061 --> 00:36:10,700
it's more like a beautiful child
that we have hidden the attic.

1146
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,960
Well that's,

1147
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,860
that's probably a better
description you're writing,

1148
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,330
but they're not really a state,

1149
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:17,750
right.

1150
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,320
They both,

1151
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,430
they're a part of the United States.

1152
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,360
People that were enjoying their lives
and then we showed up I think is what

1153
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:24,194
happened,

1154
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,260
but there and shit.

1155
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,700
I don't think they want to be a state.

1156
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,013
No idea.

1157
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:30,590
Good.

1158
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:30,820
Good.

1159
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,140
Yeah.

1160
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,790
Look at Pico,

1161
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,920
but it's one of those weird ones
like Guam where you're like,

1162
00:36:33,921 --> 00:36:34,401
what's going on?

1163
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,234
Aware where,

1164
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,823
who owns this?

1165
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,690
Since you guys or is it us?

1166
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,600
Who is this

1167
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,433
breaking news?

1168
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,880
Doug was Stan hope with breaking news.

1169
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,261
You know,

1170
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:48,300
I know John King's pretty
good at this on CNN,

1171
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:50,550
but he doesn't fucking
bar back at the same time.

1172
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:51,540
I just want to say that

1173
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,140
he probably doesn't get tipped out either,

1174
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:56,520
but on bar back in this fucker,

1175
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,450
uh,

1176
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:02,100
Virginia 13 electoral votes
go to Hillary Clinton.

1177
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,710
That means

1178
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:12,340
let's start one 67 for
Trump won 22 for Clinton.

1179
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,930
Ooh.

1180
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,063
Oh,

1181
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:15,880
sandals.

1182
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,720
States are common,

1183
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:17,554
everybody.

1184
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,670
The bargain sites.

1185
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,541
It's a common,

1186
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,770
this is going to be close.

1187
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:23,771
Hey,

1188
00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:24,161
Rogen,

1189
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:24,994
do you want to be,

1190
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,950
I know it's a bit early,

1191
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:27,730
but,

1192
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:27,971
hey,

1193
00:37:27,971 --> 00:37:28,480
how you doing?

1194
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,313
How are you man?

1195
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:35,800
Should we just bust his balls
now before he takes off?

1196
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:36,783
Who smells

1197
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,210
really?

1198
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:37,350
Oh,

1199
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,380
oh.

1200
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,130
Can I kill you?

1201
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,963
Introduce him.

1202
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:45,010
They all just run ad nauseum and I fucking
love him and he's the only person on

1203
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:48,750
this day that I could call and go.

1204
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,230
He's still more second pathic than I am.

1205
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,810
Chad chank was napping,

1206
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,370
but Marilyn Manson,

1207
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,121
Jay,

1208
00:37:57,121 --> 00:37:58,590
you're fucking stinky ass.

1209
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:00,690
No,

1210
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,523
no,

1211
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,393
you don't have to leave.

1212
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,740
Matt will bring you a mic.

1213
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,150
This show is going so
much better than we had.

1214
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,093
High.

1215
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,350
Go quick.

1216
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,183
We don't need it.

1217
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,130
We were barely talking
about the end of the world.

1218
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,240
He doesn't want to come up,

1219
00:38:20,241 --> 00:38:21,830
but he's sitting right
there and then come on out.

1220
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,740
I'll print the entire crowd

1221
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,693
crowd.

1222
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,490
Yep.

1223
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:33,641
No,

1224
00:38:33,641 --> 00:38:34,630
I'm going to get another Jameson.

1225
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:37,843
No,

1226
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:41,700
clearly is a gentleman that
might be the funniest men alive.

1227
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,200
He's up there is him and Diaz.

1228
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,380
It's in the running of this.

1229
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:45,550
My,

1230
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,130
this has been the hardest.

1231
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:49,720
I've laughed in my life and I,

1232
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:50,370
I been,

1233
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,600
I know people don't like my last hope.

1234
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:55,310
I've been a microwave from my mouth
because I cannot shut the fuck up.

1235
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,041
Love your lab.

1236
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:56,880
What are you talking about?

1237
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,400
It's like my favorite thing about you
and this night couldn't be better.

1238
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:02,790
Where were you when you found out
that Trump was running for president?

1239
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,710
I was doing cocaine with Marilyn Manson.

1240
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,240
What a fucking night.

1241
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,653
Hello?

1242
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,640
I'll let Ridley,

1243
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:19,070
we have another state that is declared
Colorado nine electoral votes.

1244
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,530
Go to Hillary Clinton.

1245
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,090
Oh,

1246
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,350
it's getting hot.

1247
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,760
One 67 for Trump won
31 for Hillary Clinton.

1248
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,740
Wow.

1249
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,370
Look at this whole thing is so bizarre.

1250
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,530
Is anybody like rooting for anybody

1251
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,230
to come back and Christ
you to keep laughing?

1252
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,093
That's all.

1253
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,360
And Joey Diaz,

1254
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,070
but he'll be here eventually.

1255
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,890
What do women want Hillary Clinton to win?

1256
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,680
Okay.

1257
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:47,790
Oh,

1258
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,690
some of you do.

1259
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,583
Some of you do.

1260
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,020
I'm going to watch those
girls very carefully.

1261
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,340
Give a fuck camp.

1262
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:57,950
Here's

1263
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:58,580
weird.

1264
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,430
You opened up smoking a joint up here,

1265
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,170
but Jim Jeffries got bailed
out as you can't have a kid

1266
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,511
near.

1267
00:40:06,511 --> 00:40:08,190
We have a list as a part of the show.

1268
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,910
Nobody knows it joint.

1269
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,490
Can you just fucking ratted me out?

1270
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,990
I never even talked about it earlier.

1271
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,360
The cigarettes get the fuck out.

1272
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,010
No,

1273
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:17,300
you're all right.

1274
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,080
You're allowed to smoke
on stage and California.

1275
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:19,551
No,

1276
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:24,540
but then the smokers see you smoking
and then they want to go outside.

1277
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,211
Oh Hey,

1278
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:25,691
real quick,

1279
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:26,320
real quick,

1280
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,501
what?

1281
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:27,161
I want to interject,

1282
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:29,830
what's going on with
prop 64 is that the is

1283
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,060
is that,

1284
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,320
I think it's kind of halfway sketchy.

1285
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,110
He's calling you.

1286
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:34,943
What'd you there?

1287
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:35,840
Hang that shit up.

1288
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,013
He's a grown man.

1289
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:37,971
He's right there.

1290
00:40:37,971 --> 00:40:38,804
He's a grown man.

1291
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,673
Tell him to come out here.

1292
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,500
How dare they said?

1293
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,420
Come on out here please.

1294
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,733
Calling you.

1295
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:51,830
Fuck with beautiful man guy.

1296
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,180
My sanity today.

1297
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:56,580
Oh,

1298
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,030
now,

1299
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,170
now they're doing
interventions on Madison.

1300
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,780
Bert Kreischer Friday night showtime.

1301
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:07,960
Is it 11:00 PM

1302
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:08,361
no,

1303
00:41:08,361 --> 00:41:11,780
10:00 PM 10:00 PM I keep
saying 1111 oh my God.

1304
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:12,430
Yo.

1305
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,700
I was in such a panic
tonight for other reasons.

1306
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,200
I took an Adderall.

1307
00:41:17,201 --> 00:41:17,471
I go,

1308
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:19,120
I think I took this too late.

1309
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,230
I'm going to walk down.

1310
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:21,850
I'm busting Manson's balls like,

1311
00:41:21,851 --> 00:41:21,941
well,

1312
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:22,750
it's a block away.

1313
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,730
We can just walk like fucking men.

1314
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,751
I'm manning up.

1315
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:30,751
I'm putting on a fake comedy face to do
this shit under extreme circumstances.

1316
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:36,031
You can walk down here and I know he's
going to get on stage and you know it's

1317
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:38,190
going to be on stage.

1318
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,060
You think it's happening.

1319
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,810
I can go on and on and on,

1320
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:48,490
but it's going to be funny because I
thought the dynamic of Manson and Rogan,

1321
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,890
you'd be so treacherous.

1322
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:53,571
It was.

1323
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:53,960
It was.

1324
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,710
It was.

1325
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,020
It was alarmingly like,

1326
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:57,500
uh,

1327
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,970
like almost like a high school reunion.

1328
00:41:58,971 --> 00:41:59,810
Joseph's while somebody goes,

1329
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:00,380
hey man,

1330
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,960
we met one time and it was like the
coolest fucking thing in the world.

1331
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,440
Oh thanks bill.

1332
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,270
Boom.

1333
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,260
You were there.

1334
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,580
Cheers by day.

1335
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:14,190
There's no proof that our pod cast
what Manson at his house with Bingo.

1336
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:16,821
No.

1337
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:18,020
You know what's funny?

1338
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,080
Both you and him said that
and you were so fucked up.

1339
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,711
You don't remember.

1340
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:22,544
I wasn't there.

1341
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,353
Yes.

1342
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:28,811
He's,

1343
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:31,660
he's claimed for 20 minutes
that we've met each other.

1344
00:42:31,661 --> 00:42:32,740
I've never met him.

1345
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,120
Were remember I was right
as I was going to say,

1346
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,200
huge fan.

1347
00:42:38,201 --> 00:42:38,561
He goes,

1348
00:42:38,561 --> 00:42:38,771
yeah,

1349
00:42:38,771 --> 00:42:40,720
I remember that time we
will fucking hanging out.

1350
00:42:40,721 --> 00:42:40,901
I was,

1351
00:42:40,901 --> 00:42:41,120
no,

1352
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,590
no,

1353
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:41,831
no.

1354
00:42:41,831 --> 00:42:42,281
I don't remember.

1355
00:42:42,281 --> 00:42:43,114
I would've remembered that

1356
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:43,410
I'm,

1357
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,300
Nancy was looking it up in his phone,

1358
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,820
but I wasn't there after that.

1359
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,130
I came out when when they save party,

1360
00:42:51,131 --> 00:42:52,650
like a rock star.

1361
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:58,650
He's the only rock star that
really parties to like a rock star,

1362
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,300
so I'm trying to keep up.

1363
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,470
Okay.

1364
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,700
Do Your podcast.

1365
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,631
That's right.

1366
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:04,380
I'm sorry.

1367
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:04,980
Yeah,

1368
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,460
you're right.

1369
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,293
You're right.

1370
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,290
As fucked as I've ever been.

1371
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:11,600
I'm wearing that leisure shoot.

1372
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,290
Remember the leisure suits,

1373
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,170
they all kind of blend together.

1374
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,220
Jackets,

1375
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:19,770
shorts,

1376
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:20,603
matching.

1377
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,840
I Hennigan pulls me out of bed with like
30 minutes sleep bingos in a fucking

1378
00:43:26,701 --> 00:43:27,660
crazy state.

1379
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,160
Air B and B.

1380
00:43:29,161 --> 00:43:30,750
I tell Hennigan,

1381
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:31,950
put the top down.

1382
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,070
We're going to your place
on the fucking sticks.

1383
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,060
You both,

1384
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,710
I can do the valley shit.

1385
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,550
I show up and I was judging
in reeking of booze.

1386
00:43:41,551 --> 00:43:46,551
We were talking about this earlier when
when you feel the heat coming off of you

1387
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:53,370
and you just think that's your imagination
and then you put your sunglasses on

1388
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,780
and they fog up.

1389
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,050
Oh fuck.

1390
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:02,570
And I'm already seriously intimidated by
Bob Burg and I'm doing his podcast and

1391
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:04,950
I show up.

1392
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:06,840
I'm smelling bad.

1393
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,520
The sound went out.

1394
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,470
I didn't know what I was talking about.

1395
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,180
It's far as I remember.

1396
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,410
It went great.

1397
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,860
I remember saying,

1398
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,230
I never realized what a
bundle of nerves you are.

1399
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,870
What are you going to stand
in the mirror and say,

1400
00:44:21,871 --> 00:44:22,470
God damn,

1401
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:23,710
I love you Doug Stam home.

1402
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:27,870
You're a genius comedian and
you're worthy of all your success

1403
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,590
now.

1404
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:34,380
[inaudible].

1405
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,830
The end of that story is
after bill's burrs podcasts,

1406
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:41,140
he came to my house and he came and he

1407
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,460
and Andy Hill was hammered.

1408
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:48,350
I don't remember any of this and he came
early cause he thought birth podcast to

1409
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,340
be three hours and it's an hour.

1410
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,700
And then he comes to my house and my dogs
are sniffing at my door and I'm like,

1411
00:44:53,701 --> 00:44:54,510
what the fuck?

1412
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,343
I opened the door,

1413
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,410
Doug's sitting in one of
my Adirondacks shaking,

1414
00:44:58,411 --> 00:45:00,630
smoking a cigarette and looks at me.

1415
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:01,110
He goes,

1416
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,340
I could use a cocktail.

1417
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:07,580
Yeah,

1418
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:12,080
we did a five hour podcast interrupted
only to have dinner with my children.

1419
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,040
I was one of the best things

1420
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:18,270
my life after I got done with Berg,

1421
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:22,770
I went to his house and I was a new drunk
now and now it's the next night even

1422
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:23,700
though I haven't slept.

1423
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:25,080
It's kind of like a new day.

1424
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,780
I have,

1425
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,890
he's got the kids.

1426
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,530
He's got his own fun house.

1427
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:32,691
Yeah.

1428
00:45:32,691 --> 00:45:33,530
And the garage.

1429
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:33,910
Yeah.

1430
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:34,310
The man,

1431
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:35,840
my man cave that they,

1432
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:37,010
the TV show did that for you,

1433
00:45:37,011 --> 00:45:37,191
right?

1434
00:45:37,191 --> 00:45:37,271
Yeah.

1435
00:45:37,271 --> 00:45:37,521
Yeah,

1436
00:45:37,521 --> 00:45:38,180
man caves.

1437
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,013
That's why I called him.

1438
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,910
If I walked into a locker room,

1439
00:45:42,911 --> 00:45:44,180
it was all black guys and they were like,

1440
00:45:44,181 --> 00:45:45,014
look at that cock.

1441
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,460
I call my digger cock all the time.

1442
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:47,751
So yeah,

1443
00:45:47,751 --> 00:45:48,170
it was a man.

1444
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,100
The man caves did it.

1445
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,570
It's the best thing that
ever happened to me.

1446
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,051
Well,

1447
00:45:51,051 --> 00:45:53,000
how do those two sentences connect?

1448
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:53,863
I Dunno.

1449
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:54,703
I Dunno.

1450
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,260
I know I'm not alone here.

1451
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:57,591
Right?

1452
00:45:57,591 --> 00:45:58,221
I'm high,

1453
00:45:58,221 --> 00:45:59,240
but I'm not retarded.

1454
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:02,971
I don't like this.

1455
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,860
Sometimes you just got to nod with birth.

1456
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,440
It's weird how quickly he
turns it to black cock.

1457
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:10,831
You know,

1458
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:12,630
like no matter what the topic is,

1459
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,570
so it's finding the house threatening.

1460
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,063
Oh,

1461
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,210
fear is funny.

1462
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,500
It's always been funny.

1463
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,720
Fucking always wobbling.

1464
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:22,810
Joe.

1465
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:23,643
Speaking of beer,

1466
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:24,730
rule of Holy Shit.

1467
00:46:24,731 --> 00:46:25,241
Is he going to win?

1468
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,790
Pennsylvania know we're
out of the ass is funny.

1469
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,290
That's the first rule of comedy.

1470
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:30,124
Yeah.

1471
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:31,893
Back in the day.

1472
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:32,953
Oh,

1473
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:33,880
this is a scary,

1474
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:36,700
it's Pennsylvania's looking mostly red.

1475
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,770
We got to get Donald Trump on mushrooms.

1476
00:46:38,771 --> 00:46:40,500
We can turn this bitch around.

1477
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:41,334
Yeah,

1478
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,340
we did turn this bitch around.

1479
00:46:43,341 --> 00:46:45,800
Pennsylvania has not been called,

1480
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:47,990
but it is right now.

1481
00:46:47,991 --> 00:46:49,520
49% Clinton,

1482
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:53,200
47% Trump outside of a child molester.

1483
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:55,100
A murder is not irredeemable.

1484
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:55,850
Right?

1485
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:56,750
This is certain Polina,

1486
00:46:56,751 --> 00:46:57,584
bring them back.

1487
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:03,350
Just six six to 10 dried
grams in an isolation tank.

1488
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,243
Donald,

1489
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:06,711
we don't,

1490
00:47:06,711 --> 00:47:07,940
we don't ask a lot of you,

1491
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:09,560
but we asked this one journey

1492
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:12,890
show on my phone.

1493
00:47:12,891 --> 00:47:14,420
I'm just seeing what man's instruct.

1494
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:18,950
Any fucking idea how awesome that
would be if we get Donald Trump trippin

1495
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,360
where are you?

1496
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:20,831
Feed Go.

1497
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,300
I'm so sorry,

1498
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,113
but look,

1499
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,260
now we can fix it.

1500
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,350
We can all fix it together.

1501
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:29,990
We're

1502
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:31,180
us now.

1503
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,010
Not then.

1504
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:36,190
Have you given up?

1505
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,261
No,

1506
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:40,240
I haven't given up a
view like this is fun.

1507
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:40,961
People are fun.

1508
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:41,794
I love people.

1509
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,820
Life is awesome.

1510
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:43,990
Even if the things bullshit,

1511
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,853
I voted.

1512
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:45,940
It's probably bullshit.

1513
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,450
This will be the first time
I didn't vote for the winner.

1514
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,033
Oh yeah.

1515
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,660
I voted for the winter every time.

1516
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:52,410
That's right.

1517
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:53,370
Bush twice

1518
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:56,730
money on board once.

1519
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:57,970
I don't know how many times he did it.

1520
00:47:58,570 --> 00:47:58,870
Well,

1521
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,370
if you'd have really voted for the winter,

1522
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:02,290
you would have voted
for Gore the first time.

1523
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:03,981
No,

1524
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:04,770
I take that back.

1525
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:05,550
I take that back.

1526
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,850
That's the only time I didn't
vote and I was on a TV show,

1527
00:48:08,851 --> 00:48:09,684
the x show,

1528
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,640
and I said out loud on this TV.

1529
00:48:11,641 --> 00:48:12,031
I was like,

1530
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,990
my vote doesn't count.

1531
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:13,883
I'm not voting.

1532
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:15,750
Everyone don't vote besides,

1533
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,080
it's a right in vote from
Florida and literally

1534
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:21,720
actually counted,

1535
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,540
but not in bed by 86 or something.

1536
00:48:24,541 --> 00:48:25,374
But

1537
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,070
you ruined the future that is now

1538
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,290
Al Gore won by a half a million
votes in the popular vote.

1539
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,730
That's how you know the system's broken.

1540
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,770
That's how a lot of fucking people,

1541
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:40,320
a half a million people die in a fire.

1542
00:48:40,321 --> 00:48:43,940
And it's the worst tragedy
in American history people.

1543
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:45,343
Yeah.

1544
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:46,603
You know what I'm saying?

1545
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,240
But at half a million,

1546
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:53,040
that's a lot of fucking human beings
chose him over Bush and our system's so

1547
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:57,360
fucked up that it doesn't recognize that
discrepancy that somehow or another,

1548
00:48:57,361 --> 00:49:01,620
your patch of dirt is more significant
than you as an individual and us as a

1549
00:49:01,621 --> 00:49:03,000
collective that can share ideas.

1550
00:49:03,001 --> 00:49:05,760
It's more important to have fucking
electoral college bill burr.

1551
00:49:05,761 --> 00:49:06,600
You're witty retort.

1552
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,880
I don't know.

1553
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,310
I understand what you're saying.

1554
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,421
I agree.

1555
00:49:15,421 --> 00:49:16,254
I agree with that.

1556
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,640
I agree with that.

1557
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,110
They day,

1558
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,740
I don't like how the
coast looked down on the,

1559
00:49:19,741 --> 00:49:20,461
on the Midwest.

1560
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:21,061
Ridiculous.

1561
00:49:21,061 --> 00:49:21,841
They're morons.

1562
00:49:21,841 --> 00:49:23,010
They grow our food supply.

1563
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:26,460
They're not dumb and they have the
internet now go to trader Joe's.

1564
00:49:26,461 --> 00:49:26,731
What do you,

1565
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:27,011
what do you,

1566
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:29,060
what do you think that
food comes from exactly?

1567
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:29,923
Huh?

1568
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,410
Comes from Joe Sixpack,

1569
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:31,921
California.

1570
00:49:31,921 --> 00:49:34,500
What's his fucking pants
on one leg at a time,

1571
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:35,380
right?

1572
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,070
Yes.

1573
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,020
Truck who keep with this and drivers.

1574
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:42,970
The drunk driver food mostly comes from
Jose six pack if we're talking about

1575
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:44,423
shit.

1576
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:45,903
That's true.

1577
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,043
That's true.

1578
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:47,351
Oh,

1579
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,270
it isn't love slide.

1580
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,840
We got ourselves a liberal

1581
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:53,643
here

1582
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,640
with the barest meant
for your political views.

1583
00:49:59,670 --> 00:49:59,941
I see.

1584
00:49:59,941 --> 00:50:02,310
More blood and less avatar blue dude.

1585
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,000
That's good.

1586
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,520
You got to have the blue right.

1587
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:06,730
What was the hood is at Rhode Island.

1588
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,110
That's Milwaukee County.

1589
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:10,100
Milwaukee County ever Lee,

1590
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:10,571
the county.

1591
00:50:10,571 --> 00:50:11,081
Milwaukee.

1592
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:12,670
Great River Lake.

1593
00:50:12,671 --> 00:50:13,780
Front property by the way.

1594
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:15,551
Tremendous dude.

1595
00:50:15,551 --> 00:50:15,940
You wait,

1596
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,880
you wait till the fucking global warming
or keep one in the golden age of it

1597
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:19,331
right now.

1598
00:50:19,331 --> 00:50:19,720
If you're going to,

1599
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,310
everyone's going to want
to live in Milwaukee,

1600
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:22,323
Wisconsin,

1601
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:23,643
live on a load.

1602
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:24,730
Remember Silver Lake?

1603
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:25,564
Where did that go?

1604
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:29,670
We put it up for a while.

1605
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:30,730
Crazy rent to me.

1606
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,411
We put it out of the,

1607
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:32,350
and it's a crazy,

1608
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:33,813
it's not there.

1609
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,120
I'm always call crazy.

1610
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,450
I said the fucking NBA was fixed
every law and order your fucking mind.

1611
00:50:41,451 --> 00:50:42,450
They get a mobbed up rep.

1612
00:50:42,451 --> 00:50:42,921
It was a lot.

1613
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:43,754
It's just one.

1614
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:46,823
Just one.

1615
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:50,730
I said Kennedy got shot.

1616
00:50:50,731 --> 00:50:51,101
I know.

1617
00:50:51,101 --> 00:50:53,010
It's just one guy my whole life.

1618
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,460
Lee Harvey Oswald Guy.

1619
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,850
Do you think Lee Harvey Oswald acted
alone or you think it was a conspiracy?

1620
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:02,901
I don't fight.

1621
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:03,170
I don't.

1622
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:03,471
I can't.

1623
00:51:03,471 --> 00:51:04,730
There's too much shit to read.

1624
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,150
This is what this is so long ago,

1625
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:08,870
Bill,

1626
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,630
too many people with have their
eyebrows up when they talk about it.

1627
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:12,230
It just makes me okay.

1628
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,063
Comfortable

1629
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,090
to want to fucking just sit
here and tell me what you think.

1630
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:20,630
You know,

1631
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:24,290
I'll listen to a fun when you get into
that like hamster emerging energy,

1632
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:26,030
like you're running on a wheel.

1633
00:51:26,031 --> 00:51:26,960
I don't want to be around you.

1634
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,330
It's an amazing picture of Hillary.

1635
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:30,380
Couldn't I swear to God?

1636
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,050
I would actually accept a hug from her.

1637
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,810
Fucking hilarious.

1638
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:36,644
If she just had that

1639
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,510
oh seven hours ago,

1640
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:39,250
I wouldn't vote for it.

1641
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,130
Now I'm looking at it like I want,

1642
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:41,270
I want to make me some cookies.

1643
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:44,690
Should it be for a second?

1644
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,670
Donald Trump tire salesman that had the
heart attack and everybody's fucking

1645
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:50,330
upset.

1646
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:51,650
He was great with the community.

1647
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:53,920
They crushed it with the A

1648
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:57,650
to wolf blitzer is not from this planet.

1649
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,633
He doesn't.

1650
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,100
He does not look like anybody.

1651
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:01,923
Wolf,

1652
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,090
the cute little car that
could around the corner.

1653
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,910
One 94 Clinton won 71 for Trump.

1654
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,111
Well,

1655
00:52:08,111 --> 00:52:08,501
what else?

1656
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:09,440
You got California?

1657
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,130
Yeah.

1658
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:10,963
Oh,

1659
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:14,820
she's a head now.

1660
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,200
It's a crazy little cartoon race.

1661
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:25,990
Come to Bergen stocks
will be all 23 skidoo.

1662
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:32,721
Oh,

1663
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:33,351
here we go.

1664
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:34,640
The old razzle dazzle play.

1665
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:37,430
We got Oregon and fucking
does Alaska matter.

1666
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:38,323
Jesus Christ,

1667
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:39,650
those poor fuckers.

1668
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,330
By the time they cast their vote,

1669
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:45,350
they get done having their
fucking grizzly bear.

1670
00:52:45,351 --> 00:52:49,220
Fucking bill tails worked up there.

1671
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:49,700
Yeah,

1672
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,533
this fucking

1673
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,473
girl

1674
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:56,750
is.

1675
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:57,890
We still work there.

1676
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,300
I booked up there.

1677
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,370
Fucking here's dude.

1678
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:05,060
That fucking comedy Condo
was what was an abomination?

1679
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,140
That fucking bed,

1680
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,240
that fucking bed for the audience.

1681
00:53:08,241 --> 00:53:08,691
Duct stand.

1682
00:53:08,691 --> 00:53:09,830
Hope that fucking beds.

1683
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:14,840
The only guy that ever got a
hotel there because he was so bad.

1684
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:15,520
No,

1685
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,930
we're afraid the floorboard wrong.

1686
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:18,890
Wrong,

1687
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,600
wrong was so weak.

1688
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,060
They were afraid he'd
go through Donald Trump.

1689
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:23,953
Wrong,

1690
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:26,490
right,

1691
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:27,323
wrong.

1692
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:28,740
My wig coming off.

1693
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:30,893
Hang on.

1694
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:35,100
The fucking bed was already broken dude.

1695
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,533
It was fucking,

1696
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,210
no,

1697
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:38,680
it was enhanced jelly.

1698
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,420
This is the guy that
actually booked you there.

1699
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,850
It was the worst ever match.

1700
00:53:46,851 --> 00:53:47,800
The bed was fucking

1701
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:50,110
broken and I just looked at it going like,

1702
00:53:50,111 --> 00:53:50,411
fuck,

1703
00:53:50,411 --> 00:53:52,210
I guess this is paying your comic dues.

1704
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,620
And I got into this block.

1705
00:53:53,621 --> 00:53:54,700
You had to make it yours.

1706
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:55,810
It was disgusting.

1707
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:57,100
The gig was great,

1708
00:53:57,101 --> 00:54:00,310
but the fucking comedy Connor was horrible
and Ralphie may taught me a lesson

1709
00:54:00,311 --> 00:54:01,330
cause I went down and laugh factory.

1710
00:54:01,331 --> 00:54:01,531
I said,

1711
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:01,591
yeah,

1712
00:54:01,591 --> 00:54:03,220
I just did Chilkoot Charlie's right.

1713
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:03,791
And he goes,

1714
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:04,061
Oh yeah,

1715
00:54:04,061 --> 00:54:04,661
I did that kick.

1716
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:05,051
I go do it.

1717
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:06,520
How about that fucking comedy Condo?

1718
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:07,331
How was that fucked up?

1719
00:54:07,331 --> 00:54:07,571
He goes,

1720
00:54:07,571 --> 00:54:07,751
dude,

1721
00:54:07,751 --> 00:54:08,584
I didn't stay there.

1722
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:10,330
I told him to get me a
hotel and I was like,

1723
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:11,463
you could do that.

1724
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,690
You can say I'm not
fucking standard out here

1725
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,040
to vouch for me.

1726
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:21,470
They were so afraid to tell you something
you that they wouldn't tell Ralphie

1727
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,380
that they would just,

1728
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:23,550
the bed was broken.

1729
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:24,690
The bed was already broken.

1730
00:54:24,691 --> 00:54:27,510
Course it was not because
of Ralphie lawsuits,

1731
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,380
because they know what did
Ralphie break that bed?

1732
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,100
All these years I've been mad at Alaska.

1733
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:37,550
We do a thousand horrors
and fucking thousand horse.

1734
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,050
Just people.

1735
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,530
I'm just saying that
bed was fucked up quick.

1736
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,460
Corey actually prop acted.

1737
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:53,820
I brought a bar of soap from the band
house and chill to Charlie's on stage

1738
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:59,790
because it had black mold on an
anti bacterial product and I go,

1739
00:55:01,271 --> 00:55:04,120
you guys think I'm kidding
about how bad this is?

1740
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:05,530
They have mold.

1741
00:55:05,531 --> 00:55:07,500
You didn't tell me that when
you booked me on the Gig

1742
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,230
did ya?

1743
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:09,370
I thought it was funny.

1744
00:55:09,371 --> 00:55:10,061
I still do.

1745
00:55:10,061 --> 00:55:11,200
That's what being quite sure.

1746
00:55:11,201 --> 00:55:13,840
Still Worth Oyster shacks in Fayetteville,

1747
00:55:13,841 --> 00:55:14,330
Arkansas.

1748
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:17,690
I did Chilkoot Charlie's and all
I will say is that the bartender,

1749
00:55:17,691 --> 00:55:18,740
who's your good friend?

1750
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,700
Uh,

1751
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,451
the owns a place.

1752
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:21,180
What's his name?

1753
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:21,730
Joe Ran?

1754
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:21,910
No,

1755
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:22,490
the Becker.

1756
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:23,323
Becker.

1757
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,790
Becker just didn't laugh at me once,

1758
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:30,290
but just kept nodding and smiling and
sending shots to the stage and I got so

1759
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:31,160
blackout drunk.

1760
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:34,970
He was like time to go to the bus company
and it's a strip club where if you

1761
00:55:34,971 --> 00:55:35,391
like,

1762
00:55:35,391 --> 00:55:38,270
they will put your Dick in
their mouth through your genes.

1763
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,020
I didn't do it

1764
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,720
but I'm on man.

1765
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:48,450
Rumor has it,

1766
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,040
it feels just like it.

1767
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,030
Rogan had you,

1768
00:55:55,031 --> 00:55:55,830
you had to shoot

1769
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:56,820
pants idea.

1770
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:57,150
No,

1771
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,170
that wasn't even mine.

1772
00:55:58,171 --> 00:55:59,220
It was a friend of mine actually.

1773
00:55:59,221 --> 00:55:59,700
Did it.

1774
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,510
He would take,

1775
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,640
you know those plastic Nike Pants.

1776
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:03,870
Remember the nine days,

1777
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:04,740
those pants?

1778
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:04,920
No,

1779
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,920
there were like workout pants for some
reason we thought it'd be a good idea.

1780
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:08,431
We did.

1781
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:12,400
And we're like thin nylon workout pants
and the nineties remember who you are.

1782
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,800
Well that's how I know Joe.

1783
00:56:14,801 --> 00:56:15,634
Well this,

1784
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,900
we all wore those.

1785
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:18,681
So this dude,

1786
00:56:18,681 --> 00:56:23,681
I know he took sandpaper to the
crotch shot of these things.

1787
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:28,150
Just he got us to where he could see
how many fingers he had up in front of a

1788
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:31,120
light and then then he
shaved his cock and balls,

1789
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,320
looped it all up,

1790
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:33,910
no underwear,

1791
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:35,140
put these things,

1792
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:39,250
got lap dances and so I'm there.

1793
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:41,590
And then he created you?

1794
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:42,913
He told me.

1795
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:45,500
Okay.

1796
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,760
He used to call it shooting.

1797
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:48,620
What do you call it?

1798
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,330
Shooting.

1799
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:51,530
Cause she naked women sit on your lap.

1800
00:56:51,531 --> 00:56:53,210
He just squirt in his
pants and it was like,

1801
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:53,600
all right,

1802
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,433
I'm good.

1803
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,410
It's us.

1804
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:57,580
It's a loophole.

1805
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,790
These are the smart guy.

1806
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,620
He didn't hurt anybody.

1807
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,860
It was an even exchange of money.

1808
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:07,090
There was a lot going on.

1809
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:09,140
We used to

1810
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:09,920
Tampa,

1811
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,230
we'd wear 'em bros.

1812
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,430
What's an Umbro?

1813
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,011
Amoebae,

1814
00:57:13,011 --> 00:57:14,230
Roser soccer shorts,

1815
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,880
those real thin soccer shorts.

1816
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,510
Oh,

1817
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:17,321
18th birthday.

1818
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:18,580
We're like gentlemen umbrellas.

1819
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:19,414
We don't pull it up

1820
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:22,840
and go a Mazda penis and just be like,

1821
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:24,790
just try to take my pants
off with your pussy.

1822
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:25,624
Here we go.

1823
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,220
And they just grind on.

1824
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:28,240
You look at her and you're like,

1825
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,153
oh yeah,

1826
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,280
it's not over,

1827
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:31,114
but I'm done.

1828
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,573
Huh?

1829
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:38,080
It's a weird salamander rolling down your
leg or you imagine if there was clubs,

1830
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:41,800
imagine it was clubs like that where
women could go and men would just climb on

1831
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:42,580
top of him,

1832
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,010
fucking squeeze on them and

1833
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:45,890
Ooh.

1834
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:46,720
Oh,

1835
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,553
oh

1836
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:49,711
my wife.

1837
00:57:49,711 --> 00:57:50,800
My wife went to the w.

1838
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,270
It was,

1839
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:51,720
it was,

1840
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:51,901
oh,

1841
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:52,800
I should not say this.

1842
00:57:52,801 --> 00:57:53,281
I'm going to say it.

1843
00:57:53,281 --> 00:57:53,920
Fuck it.

1844
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,753
It was,

1845
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:56,910
it was Christina push excuse,

1846
00:57:56,911 --> 00:57:57,870
Bachelorette party.

1847
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:58,141
No,

1848
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:58,974
you did it.

1849
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,540
I should not have said that.

1850
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,940
I should stop this story now.

1851
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,330
The Australian snakes don't.

1852
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:08,951
I don't give a fuck.

1853
00:58:08,951 --> 00:58:12,490
I'm sure she's honest with Tommy and
so they got a male stripper and my wife

1854
00:58:12,491 --> 00:58:13,510
called up and she goes,

1855
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,350
hey,

1856
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:15,310
they have a male stripper.

1857
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,290
Should I get a lap dance in my head,

1858
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:17,800
I'm like,

1859
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,041
oh,

1860
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:19,960
should we have been clearing
this with each other?

1861
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,080
I know what a mail lap down.

1862
00:58:27,081 --> 00:58:28,820
I've seen it all like show like showtime,

1863
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:29,240
you know,

1864
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:29,601
or whatever.

1865
00:58:29,601 --> 00:58:30,140
HBO,

1866
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,990
there's male lap dances and I
know my wife's not into that shit.

1867
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:34,161
I go definitely,

1868
00:58:34,161 --> 00:58:35,320
definitely get a lap dance.

1869
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,520
She calls back traumatized.

1870
00:58:37,521 --> 00:58:38,090
She's like,

1871
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,940
he basically painted
my face with his cock.

1872
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,613
Apparently.

1873
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:43,820
Another,

1874
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,080
another person that,

1875
00:58:45,081 --> 00:58:45,741
I won't name their name,

1876
00:58:45,741 --> 00:58:46,531
but this Guy Chris,

1877
00:58:46,531 --> 00:58:47,361
he didn't not get a lap dance,

1878
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:48,800
but he would just dip male strippers.

1879
00:58:48,801 --> 00:58:50,030
Just smack 'em like this,

1880
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,430
that with a rod deck.

1881
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:54,690
That's what a fucking mail lap dances.

1882
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,360
It's like,

1883
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,193
fuck off.

1884
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,420
That was his stage name.

1885
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,260
That's his number one hit songs.

1886
00:59:01,261 --> 00:59:02,094
His website

1887
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:05,671
with a Rod,

1888
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:06,800
Dick Dope or ignite.

1889
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,100
You're,

1890
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,530
you're saying he's saying
an actual dicta face like,

1891
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:11,610
I dunno if they got negative,

1892
00:59:11,611 --> 00:59:12,230
but they have those,

1893
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:15,600
those drop on North
Carolina 15 electoral votes.

1894
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:16,610
Back to the,

1895
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:17,450
the storyline

1896
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:20,790
I used to work out with this,

1897
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:22,250
who used to wear,

1898
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,550
he had like elephant.

1899
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:23,871
He was,

1900
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:24,000
uh,

1901
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,260
he was a male stripper and he had
elephant underwear where there's like the

1902
00:59:27,261 --> 00:59:27,540
ears,

1903
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:28,020
the elephant.

1904
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,150
That truck was Dick.

1905
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:29,460
Yeah.

1906
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,210
It would go into like this little thing.

1907
00:59:31,211 --> 00:59:32,420
It was like a panty hose.

1908
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,800
Those underwears have a,

1909
00:59:37,801 --> 00:59:38,490
um,

1910
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:41,820
they have like a cock ring in them so
that your balls and Dick are in the front

1911
00:59:41,821 --> 00:59:42,330
of it.

1912
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:43,830
It's actually great presentation.

1913
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:46,463
What's that?

1914
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,420
I know I was a male stripper for a day on,

1915
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:48,870
on my,

1916
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:52,350
one of my TV shows at as
Gay Strip club and uh,

1917
00:59:52,351 --> 00:59:52,920
and it,

1918
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,850
you look much better than
you normally do cause you,

1919
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:56,880
you're all your shits up front.

1920
00:59:56,881 --> 00:59:57,870
Like it's selling a car.

1921
00:59:58,380 --> 00:59:58,861
And so,

1922
00:59:58,861 --> 00:59:59,090
uh,

1923
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,410
it's like a pushup bra fee.

1924
01:00:00,411 --> 01:00:00,930
A job.

1925
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:01,171
Yeah,

1926
01:00:01,171 --> 01:00:01,651
exactly.

1927
01:00:01,651 --> 01:00:02,550
Exactly what it's like

1928
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:04,510
pushup Bra for your time.

1929
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:09,190
I deejayed one of those
fucking Bachelorette parties
one time and a guy came out

1930
01:00:09,191 --> 01:00:14,020
and the chick pulled his pants down and
he had fucking rubber band around his

1931
01:00:14,021 --> 01:00:14,920
cock and balls,

1932
01:00:14,921 --> 01:00:18,610
like a poor man's cock ring full on.

1933
01:00:18,611 --> 01:00:19,190
And he,

1934
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,023
he went,

1935
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,060
he went fucking crazy.

1936
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:22,841
He was like,

1937
01:00:22,841 --> 01:00:23,621
fuck you,

1938
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:24,700
you don't touch me.

1939
01:00:24,701 --> 01:00:29,230
And he went nuts because he just had
small package with rubber bands like just

1940
01:00:29,231 --> 01:00:29,681
paper.

1941
01:00:29,681 --> 01:00:30,880
I call them paper route.

1942
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,220
He'll be there one day.

1943
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:36,873
Oh,

1944
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:37,803
I read a horrible

1945
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:41,660
and how a guy cut his own dick off
online because it's just falls off in his

1946
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:42,171
dick off.

1947
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:46,160
And the way he did it was first
he killed it by tying it off.

1948
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:47,340
So he,

1949
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:50,240
he he documented it was the early,

1950
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:50,241
early days.

1951
01:00:50,241 --> 01:00:51,950
The Internet when we
were just starting to go,

1952
01:00:51,951 --> 01:00:56,951
what the fuck I get in the the like the
late nineties early two thousands there

1953
01:00:58,101 --> 01:00:59,660
was a website called [inaudible].

1954
01:00:59,661 --> 01:01:01,010
It's like body modification,

1955
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:02,120
extreme Mary,

1956
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:02,960
you guys remember that time,

1957
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:08,080
applause break and a shelf
applause break like bring it back.

1958
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:11,920
Youth organization called friends

1959
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:16,520
when the guy ran the site
was dead is dead now,

1960
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:18,560
but he was into like really crazy shit.

1961
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:20,600
Like yeah,

1962
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,880
online friends who he sent me his book.

1963
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:24,620
We used to send emails back and forth.

1964
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:25,820
He's a very smart guy.

1965
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:26,480
First email,

1966
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,500
first of all is because
he site where people like,

1967
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:33,320
yeah themselves up and cut
their dicks apart or whatever.

1968
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:34,323
Yeah.

1969
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,070
Like fifth for cares shits,

1970
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,450
friendships start well because I was,

1971
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:39,500
I wrote a blog,

1972
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:40,693
I wrote a blog,

1973
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,450
I wrote a blog and I was mocking something
that someone did that was ridiculous.

1974
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:48,440
Like some guy who grew his fingernails
or the longest in the world and he lost

1975
01:01:48,441 --> 01:01:50,060
control of his left arm.

1976
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:54,290
Like his nerves died in his left arm
because he has these fingernails that are

1977
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:56,660
like seven feet long
and he never cuts them.

1978
01:01:56,661 --> 01:02:00,650
And I wrote this whole thing about it
and this guy emailed me back about body

1979
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:02,000
modification and it was like,

1980
01:02:02,001 --> 01:02:04,010
he's really intelligent
response just to let you know,

1981
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,120
this is why people do weird shit.

1982
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,130
Like this is the psychological
components of it.

1983
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,160
I wrote a website,

1984
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:09,610
they want to be a sponsor on your potty.

1985
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:09,831
No,

1986
01:02:09,831 --> 01:02:09,981
no,

1987
01:02:09,981 --> 01:02:11,090
I had no podcast.

1988
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:13,070
This was 1997

1989
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:15,523
so anyway,

1990
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:15,681
he,

1991
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:19,680
the guys gives me a free password to his
site so I could see what's going on and

1992
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:22,620
I just check out all these people that
are having these weird fucking bolts

1993
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:26,280
screwed into the top of their head and
cut in their ears and split and their

1994
01:02:26,281 --> 01:02:30,530
tongues and doing all this freaky shit
and I go down the rabbit hole as you do,

1995
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:34,860
you keep clicking links and I found this
one dude who decided he didn't want his

1996
01:02:34,861 --> 01:02:35,850
dick in his balls anymore.

1997
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:39,660
He had some weird relationship with his
boyfriend was boyfriends like that Dick

1998
01:02:39,661 --> 01:02:40,351
is useless.

1999
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:41,310
You're going to cut it off.

2000
01:02:41,311 --> 01:02:41,641
He's like,

2001
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:41,881
yes,

2002
01:02:41,881 --> 01:02:42,600
master,

2003
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:47,600
and he's this guy ties rubber bands around
his dick until there's no circulation

2004
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:49,800
in his dick and balls.

2005
01:02:49,801 --> 01:02:51,150
It all goes black.

2006
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:56,540
He photographs it and
takes a documented blog,

2007
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,060
needs a rubber band and not
have circulation in their penis.

2008
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,480
I think it's a different,

2009
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:07,620
it's a cell death.

2010
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,470
It's type of constriction
we're dealing with.

2011
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:12,720
It's not as simple as a,

2012
01:03:12,721 --> 01:03:13,950
your dick doesn't get hard.

2013
01:03:13,951 --> 01:03:16,410
It's like as much more
complicated shit going on,

2014
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,420
please necrosis.

2015
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:19,590
Anyway,

2016
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:24,480
the dude documented cutting off his own
cock and balls and like photos of the

2017
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:25,363
video out.

2018
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:26,301
No,

2019
01:03:26,301 --> 01:03:27,111
there was no video.

2020
01:03:27,111 --> 01:03:27,710
It was a vote.

2021
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:30,950
It was photographs waiting for the
first communication where you go,

2022
01:03:30,951 --> 01:03:31,330
hey,

2023

2025
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,180
No,

2026
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:37,340
it was the guy who cut his balls off.

2027
01:03:37,341 --> 01:03:40,850
A number of similarities between
comedy and body modification.

2028
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:44,090
We ought to get together
for a Latte at some point.

2029
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:51,500
They don't believe in counting all
my comedy suppose elastic band.

2030
01:03:51,501 --> 01:03:51,861
This guy,

2031
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,150

2032

2033
01:03:57,171 --> 01:03:58,004

2038
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:05,360
Thank you very much.

You're right.

2046

See,

2047
01:04:12,201 --> 01:04:13,034
I'm not lying.

2048
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:15,530
You guys think I'm fucking lion.

2049
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,890
It's okay.

2050
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,250

You're wearing flip flops.

2061
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:33,950
This is disgusting.

2062

child and you're yelling out instructions

2066
01:04:43,971 --> 01:04:44,940
if the kid relaxed.

2067
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:47,000

2075
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:00,933

2080
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:04,571
right?

2081
01:05:04,571 --> 01:05:06,220
It's just like some all comic con.

2082
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:09,690
This story.

2083
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,240
It's about a guy.

2084
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,180
Does anybody know one the names decided
to turn his Dick in one of those

2085
01:05:13,181 --> 01:05:13,991
ballpark Franks.

2086
01:05:13,991 --> 01:05:16,240
He left on this hot
dog thing for too long.

2087
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,553
Guy Hated

2088
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:23,800
his side circus and all
that fucking shit for care.

2089
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,900
He had just hang himself and trees
with fucking giant hooks from his tit.

2090
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:28,680
Everything.

2091
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:28,990
Cars.

2092
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:30,550
He sure figure it out.

2093
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:32,050
They don't have to do
that to get attention.

2094
01:05:32,051 --> 01:05:32,920
There's other methods.

2095
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,600
You can be a housewife.

2096
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:37,041
What's that?

2097
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:37,611
Gg Allen.

2098
01:05:37,611 --> 01:05:37,761

2099
01:05:37,761 --> 01:05:38,720
he's still sharp people.

2100
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:40,903
That's unique.

2101
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:42,883
I mean,

2102
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:43,430
look,

2103
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:44,660
you can say you don't like it.

2104
01:05:44,661 --> 01:05:45,311
You don't want to see it,

2105
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:47,930
but it's not a lot of people doing it
and you should probably watch it once,

2106
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,520
right?

2107
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,420
It is a show.

2108
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:51,950
We're guy throws shit dog.

2109
01:05:51,951 --> 01:05:52,491
Stand up.

2110
01:05:52,491 --> 01:05:55,190
Get out of here and tell a
story about extreme Elvis.

2111
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:55,961
Hey,

2112
01:05:55,961 --> 01:05:56,450
do you have a,

2113
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:58,540
do you ever feel like
the shit you shouldn't,

2114
01:05:58,610 --> 01:05:59,470
I look at like,

2115
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:03,460
I look at your soul like it's pixelated
and every time you watched some shit

2116
01:06:03,461 --> 01:06:03,851
like that,

2117
01:06:03,851 --> 01:06:05,290
a couple of cubes float away.

2118
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:11,260
I like the next day like a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

2119
01:06:11,441 --> 01:06:13,210
Justice just doesn't taste as well.

2120
01:06:13,211 --> 01:06:14,500
Like there's just certain shit.

2121
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:16,420
You got to draw a line.

2122
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:16,811
Okay.

2123
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:17,800
We're all adults.

2124
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:19,240
I'm not saying where the line is.

2125
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:21,910

01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:37,801

You got Nevada and all of

01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:51,763
She's up.

2177
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,260
She's a head writer at
walls already built.

2178
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:56,870
You guys don't understand
how you been hanging out with

2179
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:57,671
Oregon.

2180
01:07:57,671 --> 01:07:58,810
Goes to Hillary.

2181
01:07:58,811 --> 01:08:00,010
Hey man,

2182
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:06,410
we wear sandals as hang out in
Coos Bay and watched the seals.

2183
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,713
Man,

2184
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:09,520
here it comes.

2185
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:10,570
Here it comes.

2186
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:13,610
Let's get some locally brewed
beer in some local oysters.

2187
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:14,713
Yeah,

2188
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,340
but Nebraska

2189
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,190
just went to church.

2190
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:19,170
You were serious shoes there.

2191
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:19,731
All right,

2192
01:08:19,731 --> 01:08:21,320
everybody I breaking news.

2193
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,593
There's a gentleman

2194
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:26,711
in California.

2195
01:08:26,711 --> 01:08:29,890
Voters have passed the ballot
measure legalizing recreational

2196
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:30,783
marijuana.

2197
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,113
Dammit.

2198
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:50,940
Can we go see what matters?

2199
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,640
Not Your leader?

2200
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:55,793
Yeah,

2201
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:57,570
hold on.

2202
01:08:57,570 --> 01:08:58,403
It's right.

2203
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:01,960
You might as well hit it now,

2204
01:09:01,961 --> 01:09:02,794
Bill.

2205
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,633
Sure.

2206
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:10,670
Hello,

2207
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:11,960
ladies and gentlemen,

2208
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:13,300
but finally a dolt.

2209
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:14,380
Oh my God.

2210
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,770
We're finally a dose

2211
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,340
as much as this

2212
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:21,680
fucking world.

2213
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,430
Your life happened tonight.

2214
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:27,200
Hold on.

2215
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,070
What about the mandatory condoms in porn?

2216
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,070
You can you look that up?

2217
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:32,830
That's nonsense.

2218
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:34,110
I want to see what that is.

2219
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:34,730
We got it.

2220
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:35,840
They took our jobs.

2221
01:09:35,841 --> 01:09:37,250
We've got to keep those jobs.

2222
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:40,670
We got to keep those
jobs here in the valley.

2223
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:42,290
All right.

2224
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:43,060
Yeah.

2225
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:43,300
Well,

2226
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,780
to start it in the valley,

2227
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:45,620
it stays here.

2228
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:51,980
I changed my wife's mind on the condom
ballad in line with people behind us in

2229
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:53,230
front of us.

2230
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:54,280
She was on voting yes on this.

2231
01:09:54,281 --> 01:09:54,411
I go,

2232
01:09:54,411 --> 01:09:54,581
no,

2233
01:09:54,581 --> 01:09:54,671
no,

2234
01:09:54,671 --> 01:09:55,090
no.

2235
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:55,923
It's a no.

2236
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:59,140
That means that all our porn stars have
to go to Arizona to find porns that I'll

2237
01:09:59,141 --> 01:09:59,860
watch.

2238
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:00,693
She was like,

2239
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:00,971
why?

2240
01:10:00,971 --> 01:10:02,230
When you watch one with a condom on?

2241
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:03,064
Doesn't that I go,

2242
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:04,600
it's fucking not you.

2243
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:05,411
It turns you off.

2244
01:10:05,411 --> 01:10:06,040
Trust me.

2245
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:06,873
Yeah,

2246
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:09,370
it is a porn is a fantasy.

2247
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,220
Yeah.

2248
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:13,270
Nowhere in the fantasies
and then I put a condom on.

2249
01:10:13,271 --> 01:10:14,260
I was reasonable.

2250
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:15,420
That's why we want,

2251
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,890
it just doesn't quite
feel as good as it should.

2252
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,700
Like I'm losing it
because I drank too much.

2253
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:23,920
It's like super heroes.

2254
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:25,060
They're like superheroes.

2255
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:30,360
They do stuff we can't do our superhero.

2256
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,300
Duncan Trussell.

2257
01:10:31,301 --> 01:10:32,470
I'm going to just say what he said,

2258
01:10:32,471 --> 01:10:33,490
cause it was really hilarious.

2259
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:34,720
Duncan Trussell said,

2260
01:10:34,721 --> 01:10:38,170
well if they should pass laws should
be that men can't talk and pornos.

2261
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,473
Yeah,

2262
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,720
hit the mute button.

2263
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:49,210
How many times do you hit the mute button?

2264
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:51,460
I also say no.

2265
01:10:51,461 --> 01:10:52,900
Reversing nut shot,

2266
01:10:52,901 --> 01:10:53,171
man.

2267
01:10:53,171 --> 01:10:54,160
Too much nuts.

2268
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:55,451
Oh,

2269
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:56,310
for fuck sakes.

2270
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:57,510
Yeah.

2271
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:58,343
Right

2272
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,380
to complain about with
your white privilege.

2273
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:05,590
That's what you choose.

2274
01:11:05,591 --> 01:11:06,670
Too much nuts,

2275
01:11:06,671 --> 01:11:07,060
Joe.

2276
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:08,680
First World problem,

2277
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:10,000
Dude.

2278
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,550
I used to jerk off back in the days
when men didn't shave their assholes.

2279
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:15,541
Okay,

2280
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:17,790
you watch a porno and
they'd show that back shot.

2281
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:21,390
Especially if you were in a hotel room
in the Er in the 90s they weren't allowed

2282
01:11:21,391 --> 01:11:22,440
to show penetration.

2283
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:23,220
You could even,

2284
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:24,780
you couldn't even show genitalia.

2285
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,061
Get him,

2286
01:11:25,061 --> 01:11:25,530
shoot.

2287
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:26,730
You showed people fucking,

2288
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:27,900
you knew there were fucking,

2289
01:11:27,901 --> 01:11:30,390
but you can never actually see
it going in and they showed,

2290
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:30,830
yeah.

2291
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:33,580
Hicks had a whole bit
about the heroes and ass.

2292
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:35,620
There's a lot of rubbing
member that it'd be like,

2293
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:36,140
oh,

2294
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:37,060
remember that Hick Smith?

2295
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,270
Do you remember the Hitch Smith?

2296
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:39,050
No.

2297
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:44,050
Michigan is 47.9 to 47.0

2298
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:47,583
Trump.

2299
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:48,881
Oh,

2300
01:11:48,881 --> 01:11:49,870
the suspense.

2301
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:50,880
I enjoyed it.

2302
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,060
I enjoyed the suspense.

2303
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:52,560
You will,

2304
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,260
not every word.

2305
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:55,990
That's fucking Ted
Nugent land a course man.

2306
01:11:55,991 --> 01:11:57,140
Did you see him on there?

2307
01:11:57,470 --> 01:11:59,050
He's a motherfucker with an Arrow man.

2308
01:11:59,300 --> 01:11:59,710
Right

2309
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:00,190
technique.

2310
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:04,330
I mean it only winning by 0.9%
it's not some crazy blowout.

2311
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,340
There's like 47% people.

2312
01:12:06,341 --> 01:12:06,641
I'm like,

2313
01:12:06,641 --> 01:12:07,380
I don't know.

2314
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:07,780
You know?

2315
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:07,991
Oh,

2316
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:12,340
47.1 now she's the 1.8 shit.

2317
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:13,503
But

2318
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:13,970
uh,

2319
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:15,320
this next comic,

2320
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:15,771
oh,

2321
01:12:15,771 --> 01:12:20,771
Jesus just had a Twitter poll of who
should be bumped from this panel so he can

2322
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:27,551
talk and resoundingly they'd
picked whoever needs to piss or

2323
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:30,053
have a cigarette.

2324
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:34,590
No.

2325
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:35,870
What do you think I was picking on?

2326
01:12:35,871 --> 01:12:36,704
You

2327
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:38,563
know I,

2328
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:40,490
Brendan Walsh.

2329
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:42,003
Oh,

2330
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:43,003
Yay.

2331
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:44,930
[inaudible]

2332
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:46,280
Trump.

2333
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:46,840
Trump.

2334
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:47,351
Trump.

2335
01:12:47,351 --> 01:12:48,184
Trump.

2336
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:50,530
I love your elbow patches.

2337
01:12:50,531 --> 01:12:51,040
Thanks man.

2338
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,240
I bought it downtown.

2339
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:53,120
Sweet.

2340
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:53,953
Yeah.

2341
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:58,580
A hundred bucks suits
downtown baby Brendan Walsh.

2342
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,700
Ladies and gentlemen can't
tell the difference either.

2343
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:04,450
You cannot tell the difference between
a hundred dollars suit and $1,000 to

2344
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:04,790
tell.

2345
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:05,141
Again,

2346
01:13:05,141 --> 01:13:06,700
I'd never owned $1,000 suit,

2347
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:08,283
but you've seen him.

2348
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,131
I've seen him.

2349
01:13:09,131 --> 01:13:09,281
Hey,

2350
01:13:09,281 --> 01:13:09,701
you go.

2351
01:13:09,701 --> 01:13:11,710
Do you watch prosecuting attorneys?

2352
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:12,251
Actually,

2353
01:13:12,251 --> 01:13:12,840
it's the,

2354
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,970
the defense attorneys are the ones
with the fucking expensive suits.

2355
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,320
See The da down at the
store buying $100 suit.

2356
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:24,900
What's your predictions?

2357
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:26,701
It's fucking,

2358
01:13:26,701 --> 01:13:27,091
I mean,

2359
01:13:27,091 --> 01:13:28,500
I'm all for comedy,

2360
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:33,170
but this is too funny the way it's going.

2361
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,221
It's so funny.

2362
01:13:34,221 --> 01:13:34,940
It's scary.

2363
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:36,650
This is fucking riveting.

2364
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,513
This is one of the,

2365
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:38,583
this is tremendous.

2366
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:41,110
Amazing is that on top of all the drama,

2367
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:43,810
everybody in California just
got really fucking high.

2368
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:48,070
They're all stone and
watching it right now,

2369
01:13:48,071 --> 01:13:49,210
like this is it.

2370
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:49,721
Finally.

2371
01:13:49,721 --> 01:13:52,480
We don't have to feel like we're fucking
criminals for doing something that

2372
01:13:52,481 --> 01:13:53,500
doesn't even hurt you.

2373
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,170
It's so stupid.

2374
01:13:57,810 --> 01:14:01,320
That leads to heroin and
fucking other things.

2375
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,160
Best Gateway drug for me is alcohol.

2376
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:09,000
I wonder if they're going to smoke weed
in pornos while not wearing condoms.

2377
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:12,100
I Dunno if the condom thing has passed has

2378
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:12,281
it,

2379
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:12,800
but that's,

2380
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,633
that's a good joke.

2381
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,870
Is it weird if on the condom
thing I wrote in Gary Johnson

2382
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,650
didn't really get an answer there.

2383
01:14:26,651 --> 01:14:30,640
I guess instead of
instead of using condoms,

2384
01:14:30,641 --> 01:14:32,110
you have to use Johnson weld.

2385
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:35,380
It sounds like some kind of
Dick Repair Kit doesn't it?

2386
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:43,760
Five seconds after what happened?

2387
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:46,870
Who did you drop the trap?

2388
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:47,620
Oh,

2389
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:48,490
how dare you there.

2390
01:14:48,491 --> 01:14:48,881
I got it.

2391
01:14:48,881 --> 01:14:49,271
I got it.

2392
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:49,571
I got it.

2393
01:14:49,571 --> 01:14:49,931
I got it.

2394
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:50,321
I got it.

2395
01:14:50,321 --> 01:14:51,010
I got it.

2396
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:51,350
Mark,

2397
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:51,680
Bert,

2398
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:52,040
Bert,

2399
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:52,873
Bert.

2400
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:54,641
All right.

2401
01:14:54,641 --> 01:14:55,480
Just to recap.

2402
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:58,990
One 97 to one 87 Hillary,

2403
01:14:59,110 --> 01:14:59,943
Florida,

2404
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:00,641
Michigan,

2405
01:15:00,641 --> 01:15:01,241
New Hampshire,

2406
01:15:01,241 --> 01:15:01,871
Pennsylvania,

2407
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:02,531
Wisconsin.

2408
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:05,830
Too early to call and other than that,

2409
01:15:05,831 --> 01:15:07,150
everything else is mustard color.

2410
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,170
I feel like this was frozen.

2411
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:12,601
Yeah,

2412
01:15:12,601 --> 01:15:13,434
this is frozen.

2413
01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:14,363
Frozen.

2414
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:19,000
Okay.

2415
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,690
Hey guys,

2416
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,970
they're really committed to
that mannequin challenge.

2417
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,530
It's been frozen for three hours.

2418
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:24,521
I was like,

2419
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:27,060
Wolf Blitzer is really
thinking about this point.

2420
01:15:27,061 --> 01:15:27,330
Huh?

2421
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:28,163
True.

2422
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,450
I said the funniest thing nobody got.

2423
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:32,911
How do you,

2424
01:15:32,911 --> 01:15:33,744
how do you,

2425
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:35,010
how do you reset this?

2426
01:15:35,011 --> 01:15:35,844
So you go like this?

2427
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:36,710
Yeah,

2428
01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:37,543
that's it.

2429
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,900
You're blowing your thought.

2430
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:40,140
Well,

2431
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,580
there's no fucking mouse.

2432
01:15:41,581 --> 01:15:42,840
There's nothing on this thing.

2433
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:45,380
It's fucking sufficient.

2434
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:47,100
Hi,

2435
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,240
Trump won Florida.

2436
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,670
Trump won New Hampshire.

2437
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:51,780
You got Florida.

2438
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:52,943
What does it say?

2439
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:55,200
What's the score man?

2440
01:15:55,440 --> 01:16:00,350
Two 16 to one 97 Trump two
61 97 Brandon [inaudible].

2441
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:03,810
He's got a kickoff to Hillary and
to his fucking old Washington.

2442
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:04,810
Brendan Walsh.

2443
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,180
I know you kind of a prankster,

2444
01:16:06,181 --> 01:16:07,650
but you're also a very smart guy.

2445
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:08,280
Yeah.

2446
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,113
Like

2447
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:11,583
I know you did.

2448
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:15,570
Would you be happier
if one of these people,

2449
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,340
one and we were,

2450
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:17,100
is this,

2451
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:17,581
I mean,

2452
01:16:17,581 --> 01:16:18,090
you know,

2453
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:18,601
this is,

2454
01:16:18,601 --> 01:16:21,600
this is shattering my world
because I'm such a conspiracy nut.

2455
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:23,850
I just thought like they got fucking,

2456
01:16:23,851 --> 01:16:24,660
I was like,

2457
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:24,781
well,

2458
01:16:24,781 --> 01:16:26,100
they want Hillary to be president,

2459
01:16:26,101 --> 01:16:29,100
so they got the craziest fucking monster
to run against her and now my whole

2460
01:16:29,101 --> 01:16:33,900
world's being shattered because it looked
like I've been wrong all these years,

2461
01:16:33,901 --> 01:16:34,291
that it's,

2462
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:36,660
the elections aren't fucking
rig from top to bottom.

2463
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:38,123
I think they,

2464
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:40,170
they rig it to a certain extent,

2465
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:42,840
but there's only so much they could
do without being really obvious.

2466
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:44,520
Mean you can have.

2467
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:45,230
Yeah,

2468
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:47,190
because there's a bunch of
people that want to run it all.

2469
01:16:47,191 --> 01:16:47,880
They just can't get up,

2470
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:48,331
get all,

2471
01:16:48,331 --> 01:16:49,290
get on the same page.

2472
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,680
Trumps the one that said it was rigged
and now he's about to win this shit.

2473
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:53,710
I know.

2474
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:54,543
That's amazing.

2475
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:59,130
But he kind of proved it was along the
way along with wikileaks exposing what

2476
01:16:59,131 --> 01:16:59,641
they did,

2477
01:16:59,641 --> 01:17:02,340
trying to do the forced
Bernie Sanders out.

2478
01:17:02,341 --> 01:17:02,760
Yeah.

2479
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:07,760
Like they actively conspired in their
own party to keep this guy from winning.

2480
01:17:07,771 --> 01:17:08,100
Like they,

2481
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:08,401
they're like,

2482
01:17:08,401 --> 01:17:09,050
fuck that dude.

2483
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:10,520
I got to say all you pussies

2484
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,550
who kept voting for Hillary
should have gone with Bernie,

2485
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:14,780
should have gone party pussies.

2486
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:16,640
Sarah Silverman was right.

2487
01:17:16,641 --> 01:17:17,720
That shit when they were like,

2488
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:17,901
no,

2489
01:17:17,901 --> 01:17:19,370
if you actually believed in her,

2490
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,410
fine,

2491
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:21,243
but I just eat food.

2492
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:23,180
But those people who were just like this,

2493
01:17:23,181 --> 01:17:24,800
no way this guy can win.

2494
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:28,610
So you're going to vote for someone who
goes to those Bilderberg meetings when

2495
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,090
they,

2496
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:31,760
when they dress up like facets
and they fuck each other.

2497
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:32,823
Yeah.

2498
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,340
That's your fucking hope.

2499
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:35,570
I got it.

2500
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:35,951
Be Honest.

2501
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:37,750
Is One clear way that I'm sexist.

2502
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,390
I don't mind if someone
calls it due to Dick,

2503
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,300
but like when you talk
about a pussy in a bad way,

2504
01:17:43,301 --> 01:17:43,940
like ah,

2505
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:44,591
to pussy,

2506
01:17:44,591 --> 01:17:45,400
look what,

2507
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:49,150
what is it about that that's
less Kona due to pussy?

2508
01:17:49,530 --> 01:17:49,840
Well,

2509
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,651
anybody a pussy,

2510
01:17:50,651 --> 01:17:51,484
like pussies.

2511
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:52,950
Pretty good.

2512
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:53,310
Pretty good.

2513
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:54,143
Thanks.

2514
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:55,651
But if,

2515
01:17:55,651 --> 01:17:56,000
uh,

2516
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:56,480
if someone

2517
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,950
says that guys up in Massachusetts,

2518
01:17:57,970 --> 01:17:59,470
you understand the terminology.

2519
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:00,110
I do.

2520
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:01,000
I understand it.

2521
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,060
Are you trying to sick feminists on me?

2522
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:05,460
That's not what I'm doing.

2523
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:08,590
Joe Rogan tells Bill Burr Cassie,

2524
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:09,630
how did it actually,

2525
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:13,290
this may surprise you.

2526
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:20,720
Here's why Bill Baer is wrong@salon.com

2527
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:23,883
Tony edge lift.

2528
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:27,830
Donald Trump's about to be
living in government housing.

2529
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:31,240
Oh Shit,

2530
01:18:31,241 --> 01:18:32,074
Tony.

2531
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:36,370
It's just the fact we're going to
have a gold plated White House soon,

2532
01:18:36,371 --> 01:18:37,204
son.

2533
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:41,210
Okay.

2534
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:43,250
How many times does that
motherfucker going to golf?

2535
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:44,913
Okay.

2536
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:49,440
This is what's really fucked up about
this whole thing is this fucking country

2537
01:18:49,441 --> 01:18:52,920
right now is painted so goddamn
red and Hillary still in it.

2538
01:18:52,921 --> 01:18:54,330
Somehow like this is fucking,

2539
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,550
that's like when a team
has like nine turnovers,

2540
01:18:56,551 --> 01:18:58,200
but somehow there's still fucking losing.

2541
01:18:59,210 --> 01:18:59,461
It's like,

2542
01:18:59,461 --> 01:19:00,480
how was that possible?

2543
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:02,281
I'm sorry.

2544
01:19:02,281 --> 01:19:03,150
Let me get to this crowd.

2545
01:19:03,151 --> 01:19:04,020
It's like when someone starts,

2546
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,010
is that Dick up?

2547
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:07,321
Listen,

2548
01:19:07,321 --> 01:19:08,010
ladies and gentlemen,

2549
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:09,150
can't worry about a little joint.

2550
01:19:09,151 --> 01:19:09,601
It's free.

2551
01:19:09,601 --> 01:19:09,931
It's we,

2552
01:19:09,931 --> 01:19:10,480
it's we.

2553
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,400
Now we're good here.

2554
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:13,201
It's legal.

2555
01:19:13,201 --> 01:19:15,510
It's like you drop knowledge on,

2556
01:19:15,511 --> 01:19:17,010
I got on me fucking crazy.

2557
01:19:17,011 --> 01:19:17,844
Come on.

2558
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:19,020
I wrote,

2559
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:19,853
I wrote [inaudible].

2560
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:20,910
Ladies and gentlemen,

2561
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,800
we're here for the long haul.

2562
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:26,030
This thing's going down right now.

2563
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:26,933
Malik coming up,

2564
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:28,051
whatever it means.

2565
01:19:28,051 --> 01:19:30,870
Dropping the joint is like a
hundred Mike drops at once.

2566
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:32,700
It's a cool new thing since pot's been,

2567
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,750
oh,

2568
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:36,930
okay.

2569
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:38,040
This is how it started.

2570
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:40,200
Joint drops on the main rooms.

2571
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,820
They just think I'm going to buy a hummer.

2572
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:43,951
Trump lands,

2573
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:45,050
I'm buying a fucking Hummer on.

2574
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:46,470
I'll put those blue neon lights

2575
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,540
and it's like he knew he
could be like a vampire.

2576
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:51,171
Familiar.

2577
01:19:51,171 --> 01:19:52,400
You can live amongst them.

2578
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:55,070
I'm just going to blend in,

2579
01:19:55,071 --> 01:19:55,431
man.

2580
01:19:55,431 --> 01:19:56,510
I'm going to blend in.

2581
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,640
I'm gonna Start Wearing tank tops again.

2582
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:03,200
Fuck Trump's in the house.

2583
01:20:03,201 --> 01:20:03,840
What's up?

2584
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:07,850
No assholes on top of this fucker.

2585
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:14,520
He's looking right now like
Pennsylvania is going to be the decider.

2586
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:15,780
Jesus.

2587
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,880
Those people were doomed.

2588
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:18,680
Payway dot.

2589
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,471
Clinton's cleanse,

2590
01:20:19,471 --> 01:20:20,304
not doing it.

2591
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:22,441
Hold on.

2592
01:20:22,441 --> 01:20:23,230
Hold on.

2593
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:26,000
Landed bear in 1700 and the fucking dumb.

2594
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:26,850
He stayed.

2595
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:28,850
Okay.

2596
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:30,080
They're decided in our faith.

2597
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:31,490
Why are you still there,

2598
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,550
mother fucker?

2599
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:37,550
You know about Oregon still?

2600
01:20:37,551 --> 01:20:40,130
One 97 187 hey,

2601
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:43,960
could either of you guys explain what
you mean when you say Phyllis Delphia is

2602
01:20:43,970 --> 01:20:45,010

2603
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:47,420
Delphia I am so fucked up.

2604
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,450
Does anybody know how
many states there are?

2605
01:20:50,451 --> 01:20:51,284
Seriously,

2606
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:52,340
guys?

2607
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:54,800
Pretty sure Brooke Chrysler thinks
that Phyllis Diller is about

2608
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:55,923
the election.

2609
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:06,053
Oh,

2610
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:07,553
Bill is?

2611
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:11,900
Yeah.

2612
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,490
Violated their minor league

2613
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:17,830
here.

2614
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:19,070
Here's some non condoms.

2615
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:20,413
Oh,

2616
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:25,920
that was amazing.

2617
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:28,531
Hey,

2618
01:21:28,531 --> 01:21:29,760
throw that joined back.

2619
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,720
You wasted so much weed that they're
about to legalize weed right now.

2620
01:21:35,721 --> 01:21:37,070
They got mad at you.

2621
01:21:37,071 --> 01:21:37,570
Just Hey,

2622
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:39,440

2623
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:42,150
Hey,

2624
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:42,541
shut up.

2625
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:43,374
Shut up.

2626
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:47,780
Oh Shit.

2627
01:21:47,781 --> 01:21:50,720
This just in Canada is building
a wall across the u s border.

2628
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,340
They're armed guards protecting

2629
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:59,340
their country from assholes
moving their Tripoli hates,

2630
01:21:59,610 --> 01:21:59,800

2631
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:00,633
Hinchcliffe.

2632
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:01,863
I'm not,

2633
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,610
I don't know the whole scene.

2634
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:04,481
Who was Sam?

2635
01:22:04,481 --> 01:22:05,314
Truthfully?

2636
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:08,200
Tony Hinchcliffe so much.

2637
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:08,501
I know.

2638
01:22:08,501 --> 01:22:08,950
I'm just,

2639
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:09,910
I'm making up bullshit.

2640
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:12,580
Trying to bring high
right now Tripoli out.

2641
01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:12,781
Oh,

2642
01:22:12,781 --> 01:22:13,614
okay.

2643
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:15,250
So I fucking threw you out.

2644
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:16,533
I know.

2645
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:17,860
I'm going to throw them out.

2646
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,590
I can throw you out Sam Aaa Aaa.

2647
01:22:20,591 --> 01:22:21,424
Get out of here.

2648
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:22,523
Oh.

2649
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:23,841
Oh,

2650
01:22:23,841 --> 01:22:24,920
he's not even listening.

2651
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:26,481
Sit back down.

2652
01:22:26,481 --> 01:22:27,610
Doug doesn't even have snap chat.

2653
01:22:27,611 --> 01:22:28,251
Billy's phone number.

2654
01:22:28,251 --> 01:22:29,084
This is a prank.

2655
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:30,591
Brendan,

2656
01:22:30,591 --> 01:22:31,430
are you behind this?

2657
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:31,720
Yeah,

2658
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:32,553
behind everything.

2659
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:33,680
It wasn't like you're correct.

2660
01:22:33,681 --> 01:22:34,440
Posture.

2661
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:34,760
Aye.

2662
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:35,060
Aye.

2663
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:35,893
Aye.

2664
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:36,200
Aye.

2665
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,033
Aye.

2666
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:39,280
Hype myself up and I said

2667
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,320
Sam Tripoli.

2668
01:22:42,321 --> 01:22:42,870
There you go.

2669
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:47,840
Typically he hates Tony Hinchcliffe
so badly we were over here.

2670
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:48,540
Oh wait.

2671
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,270
Oh you're,

2672
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:50,330
I thought he was quite happy.

2673
01:22:50,331 --> 01:22:50,991
Election Day,

2674
01:22:50,991 --> 01:22:51,501
everybody.

2675
01:22:51,501 --> 01:22:52,610
Happy Election Day.

2676
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:55,390
Sam Tripoli.

2677
01:22:55,520 --> 01:23:00,220
I had my wash set to the wrong time and
I go an hour and a half from here after

2678
01:23:00,221 --> 01:23:00,471
this.

2679
01:23:00,471 --> 01:23:01,304
So from here?

2680
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:02,030
No,

2681
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:03,630
it's two and a half more hours.

2682
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:04,341
Condom loss.

2683
01:23:04,341 --> 01:23:04,611
Pat.

2684
01:23:04,611 --> 01:23:05,444
What happened that

2685
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:08,860
that's what Sam Shipley's
concerned very much.

2686
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:12,970
We've lost and condom la doing this
and we doing this like we're a bunch of

2687
01:23:12,971 --> 01:23:14,050
fucking baby.

2688
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:16,450
It didn't pass.

2689
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:20,320
Then they got to put the weed
on their dicks in pornos now.

2690
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:20,921
What's that?

2691
01:23:20,921 --> 01:23:21,220
What?

2692
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:21,881
They've got a roll there.

2693
01:23:21,881 --> 01:23:23,980
Dixon weed before they fucking pornos.

2694
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:26,460
You can smoke the Dick.

2695
01:23:27,490 --> 01:23:32,490
You got to smoke your own Dick Wolf
Blitzer looks like Colonel Sanders.

2696
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:37,660
I like a funeral because
he's wearing the darker suit.

2697
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:39,790
Like if you went for a week,

2698
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:42,700
like if the Birkin guy died
and just out of respect,

2699
01:23:42,701 --> 01:23:44,140
he fucking showed up.

2700
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,210
That would be like the Sudi v wearing,

2701
01:23:46,211 --> 01:23:47,400
but he's got like the fucking,

2702
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:48,310
the white shit going.

2703
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:52,000
You guys could see this laptop.

2704
01:23:52,001 --> 01:23:53,730
You know that I was fucking dead on point.

2705
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:55,450
Good point.

2706
01:23:55,450 --> 01:23:56,290
Have you ever heard this?

2707
01:23:56,460 --> 01:24:01,460
Found yourself having that
guilty moment where you go,

2708
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:02,111
hey,

2709
01:24:02,111 --> 01:24:02,944
Trump's right,

2710
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:05,623
we're good

2711
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:09,100
to 68 Clinton.

2712
01:24:09,101 --> 01:24:11,720
What the fuck can't be this close?

2713
01:24:11,730 --> 01:24:16,300
Donald Trump definitely as a boma
to 69 to 68 you need to 70 to win.

2714
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:17,530
Get the fuck Outta here.

2715
01:24:17,531 --> 01:24:20,050
69 that's what it says.

2716
01:24:20,051 --> 01:24:20,950
It can't be real.

2717
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:23,470
What is Rhode Island left?

2718
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,660
That doesn't make any sense.

2719
01:24:25,661 --> 01:24:26,830
That can't be a real score.

2720
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:31,240
Remember when we thought
this is going to be a joke?

2721
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:32,583
Oh Alaska.

2722
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,513
Save us

2723
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,480
both to Alaska.

2724
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,210
My apologies.

2725
01:24:40,211 --> 01:24:40,981
The chill coot,

2726
01:24:40,981 --> 01:24:45,981
Charlies and all those for trappers up
there and everybody running from the law.

2727
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:48,460
Holy Shit.

2728
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:54,230
Sam,

2729
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:55,370
triple your thoughts.

2730
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:57,760
I'm blown away by this.

2731
01:24:58,010 --> 01:24:59,420
How retarded we are.

2732
01:24:59,421 --> 01:25:00,254
Huh?

2733
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:02,780
Thanks.

2734
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:07,780
[inaudible] this is I can I would
you gotta be red state by State?

2735
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:12,460
What's a bigger uh,

2736
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,380
buster Douglas.

2737
01:25:14,381 --> 01:25:15,310
Mike Tyson.

2738
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,630
Donald Trump said,

2739
01:25:16,631 --> 01:25:20,170
ever one Florida was in Vegas for 29.

2740
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,160
How do you fuck you?

2741
01:25:21,161 --> 01:25:25,600
You fucking morons in
Florida have 29 electoral

2742
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:26,523
folks.

2743
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:29,330
This is when I go again.

2744
01:25:30,670 --> 01:25:31,990
I like Miami.

2745
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:33,903
I liked Miami.

2746
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,600
Tampa dude.

2747
01:25:35,601 --> 01:25:37,570
Get the fuck the pauper.

2748
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:42,700
Ybor city through the upper three quarters
back of that fucking pickup truck.

2749
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:47,920
He boards cause I think Florida's
any more fucked up than other states.

2750
01:25:47,921 --> 01:25:51,100
They just don't get the shit cause
they've got a couple of water parks and

2751
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:53,500
Disneyland and everybody
gets all fucking desal.

2752
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:53,861

01:25:53,861 --> 01:25:54,560
This is a what?

2754
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,510
An amazing place.

2755
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,650
More fucked up than other
state of Florida people here.

2756
01:25:58,651 --> 01:25:59,484
Evidently.

2757
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:00,510
No,

2758
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:02,320
Florida is more fucked up.

2759
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:02,840
Oh wait,

2760
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:03,673

2761
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,620

2762
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,790
I don't know what the fuck this shown is.

2763
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:08,320
Sorry guys.

2764
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:08,631
Sorry.

2765
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:09,710
I know I got y'all excite.

2766
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:12,973
Hey,

2768
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:16,011
Yeah,

2769
01:26:16,011 --> 01:26:18,830
that was Nacodoches credibility.

2770
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,000
What's left?

2771
01:26:24,490 --> 01:26:25,390
There's pills.

2772
01:26:25,391 --> 01:26:26,224
There's,

2773
01:26:27,210 --> 01:26:30,220
there's getting a vein in the bathtub.

2774
01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:31,450
They should've started,

2775
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:32,081
dude.

2776
01:26:32,081 --> 01:26:32,861
Hillary should have ran.

2777
01:26:32,861 --> 01:26:33,820
If they build a wall,

2778
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:35,140
that means no cocaine.

2779
01:26:35,141 --> 01:26:37,570
I bet you everybody would have
voted for Hillary Clinton,

2780
01:26:37,571 --> 01:26:38,240
ma'am.

2781
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,690
You said no more blow insane dude.

2782
01:26:40,691 --> 01:26:41,730
This is the one that I'm speaking of.

2783
01:26:41,731 --> 01:26:41,981
Blow.

2784
01:26:41,981 --> 01:26:46,510
I ran fucking Manson Outta here by trying
to get them on stage and he's a grown

2785
01:26:46,511 --> 01:26:47,060

2786
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,270
but we have Adderall
six feet away from you.

2787
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:51,610
No,

2788
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:51,870
no.

2789
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:53,700
He doesn't want to go on stage.

2790
01:26:53,701 --> 01:26:55,090
I don't care how much coke do you know?

2791
01:26:55,091 --> 01:26:56,950
You don't call me if you're
six feet away from me.

2792
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:00,740
An important,

2793
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:02,500
this is not like a structured thing is no.

2794
01:27:02,501 --> 01:27:03,334
Pas here

2795
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:06,430
said,

2796
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:07,481
listen,

2797
01:27:07,481 --> 01:27:10,750
the guy pulled me out of the bad
spot today and I was at Dick,

2798
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:12,750
but yeah,

2799
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:12,961
yeah,

2800
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:13,330
yeah.

2801
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:14,141
He's still here.

2802
01:27:14,141 --> 01:27:15,220
He's a weird dude.

2803
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:16,463
That's all right man.

2804
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:22,200
I was supposed to tell you people that
this show goes on for a long fucking

2805
01:27:23,231 --> 01:27:24,064
time,

2806
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:26,593
so

2807
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,450
there is no structure.

2808
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,640
It's just going to get weirder.

2809
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:36,080
I'm on autopilot with the
fakest smile you'll ever see.

2810
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,880
So if you have to Piss,

2811
01:27:37,881 --> 01:27:38,671
get drink,

2812
01:27:38,671 --> 01:27:39,830
smoke a cigarette,

2813
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,000
beat your kids,

2814
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:45,050
go take care of Jim
Jefferies kid in the car.

2815
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:45,884
Whatever you have to do,

2816
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,420
just come in and out.

2817
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:49,670
We're going to have
comics coming in and out.

2818
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:50,581
So yeah,

2819
01:27:50,581 --> 01:27:50,721
the,

2820
01:27:50,721 --> 01:27:51,110
okay.

2821
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:53,240
Now back to the show.

2822
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:54,980
Brendan Walsh,

2823
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:56,023
Florida.

2824
01:27:57,070 --> 01:27:58,070
It is weirder.

2825
01:27:58,190 --> 01:27:59,270
Is that it's not weird.

2826
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:00,190
Yes it is.

2827
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:01,170
They'll police man.

2828
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,150
It cooks their brains.

2829
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:04,640
I tried to take a shit
in a hot tub in Florida.

2830
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:09,460
Saint Motel stopped you,

2831
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:10,753
Shelley.

2832
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,860
Shelley made me stop.

2833
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:16,550
I almost took Shelley's zero off with
a banana too and I was talking to my

2834
01:28:16,551 --> 01:28:18,080

Standing up

2844
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:32,150
Oh that ain't shit.

2845
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:36,770
Third Berg Quisha pissed on his
father in law's kitchen table.

2846
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:38,570
So drunk

2847
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:39,520
that he was in the toilet

2848
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:46,330
is so great.

2849
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:48,131
Hey,

2850
01:28:48,131 --> 01:28:49,090

2851
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:49,924
Okay.

2852
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:53,260
Not only on their dining room table,

2853
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,430
but when he caught me,

2854
01:28:54,431 --> 01:28:54,611
I,

2855
01:28:54,611 --> 01:28:55,690
David blamed it.

2856
01:28:57,180 --> 01:29:02,010
David played it and I laid under the
table cloth in my pissed and went

2857
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:02,970
back to sleep.

2858
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:07,600
That's what's up

2859
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:10,860
and he's wearing flip flops.

2860
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:11,770
I told that story,

2861
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:13,460
Bro.

2862
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:14,293
Man,

2863
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:15,363
I don't lecture.

2864
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:16,283
Yeah,

2865
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,610
feet does have jeans and flip flops.

2866
01:29:18,611 --> 01:29:21,280
Why not fucking socks match my outfit.

2867
01:29:21,281 --> 01:29:22,510
Weed's legal now I'm happy.

2868
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:23,201
You're a pioneer.

2869
01:29:23,201 --> 01:29:24,520
You're a pioneer in footwear.

2870
01:29:25,330 --> 01:29:26,860
I left my fanny pack in the car.

2871
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:27,880
I was too high before I got.

2872
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:30,010
Jesus is not the time.

2873
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:31,570
It's not the time for the fanny pack.

2874
01:29:31,571 --> 01:29:32,620
It's going to get in the way.

2875
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:33,940
Fanny pack.

2876
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:35,410
I'll tell I'm going to tell a story.

2877
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:36,310
We're fucking,

2878
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:37,030
you know.

2879
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:38,650
I knew when you said I
can't tell this story.

2880
01:29:38,651 --> 01:29:39,250
You were going to tell it.

2881
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:39,610
Just tell.

2882
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:40,900
I have to tell a story.

2883
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:43,990
Shit's bad at home.

2884
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:49,200
But when the EMT or taken
her my girlfriend out,

2885
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:53,950
you got to tell the story because
my girlfriend had his seizure,

2886
01:29:53,951 --> 01:29:54,910
fell back,

2887
01:29:54,911 --> 01:29:56,230
fractured her skull.

2888
01:29:56,231 --> 01:30:01,231
She's still not responsive to see my ex
girlfriend cry if my ex girlfriend used

2889
01:30:01,871 --> 01:30:03,400
to have seizures like that all the time.

2890
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:04,601
Well,

2891
01:30:04,601 --> 01:30:05,420
I know.

2892
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:05,620
Good.

2893
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:07,180
It kept burning late dinner.

2894
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:13,160
Oh man,

2895
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:14,630
went for it.

2896
01:30:16,170 --> 01:30:17,470
Y'All know where you're going with this.

2897
01:30:17,471 --> 01:30:21,030
You guys don't hang around
with you're fucked comedians.

2898
01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:22,650
Your life sucks.

2899
01:30:22,651 --> 01:30:24,330
That's why you paid money to be here.

2900
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:29,510
That's the only way I get through life
is cause I have the best fucking comic

2901
01:30:29,611 --> 01:30:30,840
friends that can bust my balls.

2902
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:31,620
So.

2903
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:32,610
So bingo.

2904
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:34,860
I know it's cocaine related.

2905
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:36,420
It's her 40th birthday.

2906
01:30:36,421 --> 01:30:39,420
The whole family is there in Biz B.

2907
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:41,940
She has a seizure fractures or skull.

2908
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:43,290
They're taking her out,

2909
01:30:43,291 --> 01:30:45,000
the mts there holding her head.

2910
01:30:45,001 --> 01:30:47,580
I'm just just puking busting balls.

2911
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:48,720
Crack a joke.

2912
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:49,410
Joke,

2913
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:50,070
joke.

2914
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,230
Oh the pool of blood is getting bigger.

2915
01:30:52,231 --> 01:30:52,471
I go,

2916
01:30:52,471 --> 01:30:53,520
don't clean that up.

2917
01:30:53,970 --> 01:30:55,830
I need a good picture in daylight.

2918
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:59,370
And then my dog start
licking up the blood.

2919
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:02,440
So cleaning up line,

2920
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:06,650
but it hovered it cause I needed
to get a picture cause it was this,

2921
01:31:06,690 --> 01:31:08,610
this is not the first time it's happened.

2922
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:13,350
So I don't really think it's
going to end up like it is now.

2923
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:14,461
Fuck her.

2924
01:31:14,461 --> 01:31:16,920
She knows better than to do that much PLO.

2925
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,010
So I'm cracking wise.

2926
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,400
I don't even know if I remember my story.

2927
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:24,273
Yeah.

2928
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:26,990
What was I going to not tell?

2929
01:31:27,170 --> 01:31:28,670
Oh the fanny pack.

2930
01:31:30,430 --> 01:31:31,940
So here's what happens.

2931
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:34,740
The sisters,

2932
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:35,761
Bingo,

2933
01:31:35,761 --> 01:31:39,420
sister Bongo and Bengo I call them.

2934
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:42,390
They're like go,

2935
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:43,230
who knows what to do?

2936
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:43,830
I go,

2937
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:48,240
someone go down with everyone's calling
nine one one go down and make sure

2938
01:31:48,241 --> 01:31:50,910
there's no coke residue or wherever.

2939
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:55,830
I know she's doing coke and
then I see her fanny pack,

2940
01:31:55,831 --> 01:31:57,450
which he's very attached to.

2941
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:59,860
She's trying to bring the fanny back.

2942
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:01,143
It's not working.

2943
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:02,291
But I go,

2944
01:32:02,291 --> 01:32:02,680
Hey,

2945
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:03,340
uh,

2946
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:04,600
take her fanny pack.

2947
01:32:04,601 --> 01:32:07,750
Cause when she wakes up
she's going to freak out.

2948
01:32:07,751 --> 01:32:08,830
Where's my fanny pack?

2949
01:32:08,831 --> 01:32:13,490
It's a mental thing and they
wouldn't have blow in there.

2950
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:13,930
I go,

2951
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:15,160
she's not that dumb.

2952
01:32:15,690 --> 01:32:16,780
Oh yes she are

2953
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:19,470
the sisters.

2954
01:32:19,650 --> 01:32:20,520
Clean Cut.

2955
01:32:20,670 --> 01:32:23,760
All American sisters go to the Er.

2956
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:24,601
I'm like fucking,

2957
01:32:24,601 --> 01:32:28,140
I'm the host of the party
now you go to the Er,

2958
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:33,260
they find the blow and it's a shitload
of Blo Manson would have stayed.

2959
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:43,450
So the sister smuggles it
is the eight blocks away,

2960
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:46,510
but smuggles it like locked up abroad.

2961
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:48,423
Hello?

2962
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:50,800
I was trying to find her insurance

2963
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:54,963
and I,

2964
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:56,230
Holy Shit.

2965
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:57,873
And then

2966
01:32:59,110 --> 01:33:01,210
we started doing her blow.

2967
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:04,480
Stay awake,

2968
01:33:05,970 --> 01:33:07,360
find out the condition.

2969
01:33:07,361 --> 01:33:10,600
She said she knows better than to do this.

2970
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,930
She has a problem with this.

2971
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:16,750
Anyone called yet

2972
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:21,460
family that's snorts
together stays together.

2973
01:33:25,910 --> 01:33:27,020
Did I make this weird?

2974
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:29,400
Is that the national?

2975
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:30,243

2976
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:34,743

Within two points.

2983
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:49,280
I thought that was a
projection or something.

2984
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:50,780
Well,

2985
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:51,260

2986
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:51,980

tweeting against you for the past.

2998
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:17,630

01:34:35,201 --> 01:34:37,330

3011
01:34:40,001 --> 01:34:40,420
it's like,

3012
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:40,871
ah,

3013
01:34:40,871 --> 01:34:42,100
this doesn't work.

3014
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:44,650
There's a couple of Canada.

3015
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,150
Have you guys been to Canada?

3016
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:48,400
I know Michael More hyped it up.

3017
01:34:48,490 --> 01:34:49,323
Okay.

3018
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:54,870
I know we hyped it up like nobody hates
anybody and there's no racism up there.

3019
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:56,200
They human beings,

3020
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:58,400
they're incredibly just like us.

3021
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:02,210
So if you wanted a little
colder to great place to go,

3022
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:03,440
but other than that,

3023
01:35:03,441 --> 01:35:04,460
that just like us,

3024
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:05,750
the coaches are smart,

3025
01:35:05,751 --> 01:35:06,261
justice,

3026
01:35:06,261 --> 01:35:06,680
dumb.

3027
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:07,580
God bless them.

3028
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:09,260
It's not a solution,

3029
01:35:09,261 --> 01:35:09,441
man.

3030
01:35:09,441 --> 01:35:09,771
Come on.

3031
01:35:09,771 --> 01:35:11,660
You're going to go up
there and watched the CFL.

3032
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:12,830
The Fuck Outta here.

3033
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:24,020
I was trying to talk to you earlier when
you were fucking with Rogan about the

3034
01:35:24,021 --> 01:35:29,021
conspiracy theories because a
million years ago it was Viet VHS.

3035
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:31,850
Rogan was showing a no,

3036
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:33,350
we faked the moon landing.

3037
01:35:33,351 --> 01:35:34,101
You get a watch.

3038
01:35:34,101 --> 01:35:35,720
This double VA

3039
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:36,823
totally was.

3040
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,120
Behold a pale horse.

3041
01:35:39,390 --> 01:35:40,650
You're being lied to.

3042
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:42,213
I never

3043
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:44,170
came from,

3044
01:35:44,170 --> 01:35:45,450
what are you thinking?

3045
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:47,713
Oh No,

3046
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,750
I don't blame my own

3047
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:51,590
later in years,

3048
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:52,670
but it was him.

3049
01:35:52,671 --> 01:35:57,030
That was the first conspiracy guy about
the moon landing and he's [inaudible]

3050
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:58,730
grow as he is now.

3051
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:03,350
So you just shut up and you watch
four hours of VHS and you go,

3052
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:04,820
oh fuck yeah.

3053
01:36:04,821 --> 01:36:06,220
It sounds like it was faked.

3054
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:11,660
And then you can go now Google is brand
new and you go debunk and he's here all

3055
01:36:11,661 --> 01:36:14,840
the shit that why that was wrong.

3056
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:15,703
And then you go,

3057
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:19,340
I don't care if we ever landed on them.

3058
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,593
My question,

3059
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:24,210
why does it Nasa just take a picture of
the car that they left up there and be

3060
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:24,600
like,

3061
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:25,140
boom,

3062
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:26,070
drop the mic.

3063
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:27,113
It's over.

3064
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:27,661
They take them,

3065
01:36:27,661 --> 01:36:28,680
get them started.

3066
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:29,760
Well then there you go.

3067
01:36:31,050 --> 01:36:32,010
Why does it the government,

3068
01:36:32,011 --> 01:36:34,470
you know a video of that
plane hitting the Pentagon.

3069
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:37,620
Oh,

3070
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:42,420
it's a lot of cameras on the place.

3071
01:36:42,421 --> 01:36:45,900
Let's just show them where this took
a big left turn that's took a big left

3072
01:36:45,901 --> 01:36:46,734
turn.

3073
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:50,000
I went safe fucker with the mood

3074
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,250
that gets people rational.

3075
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:58,030
Bill had the fucking ball over the goal
line yesterday was Sunday whenever,

3076
01:36:58,031 --> 01:37:01,450
I don't know what data is and
they should have beat the chiefs.

3077
01:37:01,870 --> 01:37:02,590
So the,

3078
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:03,423
yeah.

3079
01:37:06,310 --> 01:37:10,690
Jaguars was you in the Jags
[inaudible] Jackson Jaguars pan?

3080
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:11,141
No,

3081
01:37:11,141 --> 01:37:14,600
I was just watching acted like who cared?

3082
01:37:14,610 --> 01:37:18,670
Another fucking dude messed up his
knees and he laid on the fucking ground,

3083
01:37:18,671 --> 01:37:19,011
the train.

3084
01:37:19,011 --> 01:37:20,770
It came out and they had
to take him out for a play.

3085
01:37:20,771 --> 01:37:24,650
I enjoyed that cause he wasn't fucking
way he was rolling around in the theater.

3086
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,640
Now it has a smell.

3087
01:37:26,650 --> 01:37:30,420
This the field goal kicker for
the buffalo bills chairman.

3088
01:37:30,421 --> 01:37:33,070
The Way Carpenter was rolling
around and laying on the ground.

3089
01:37:33,071 --> 01:37:34,210
He thought he was really fucking hurt.

3090
01:37:34,211 --> 01:37:35,940
Then all of a sudden he
lines up for 50 yard field.

3091
01:37:35,941 --> 01:37:36,970
Would the fucking do was fine.

3092
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:38,143
He was fine.

3093
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,550
That game was a push.

3094
01:37:39,551 --> 01:37:40,690
Anybody betting at home?

3095
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:43,750
I bet on the fucking bills plus thick.

3096
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:44,201
Hey.

3097
01:37:44,201 --> 01:37:46,680
Oh I want sponsorship from bed online.

3098

3102
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:48,950
Do,

3103
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:50,130
this might be an question.

3104
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:51,970
How close are we now?

3105
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:53,020
I just did you,

3106
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:54,820
do you ever do line and then
I'll ask the guy in the,

3107
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,033
he was,

3108
01:37:57,900 --> 01:38:01,200
we're going to have people are moving.

3109
01:38:01,201 --> 01:38:01,951
There's moves there.

3110
01:38:01,951 --> 01:38:02,920
Looks Kinda happy.

3111
01:38:02,921 --> 01:38:03,930
Is that Wolf Blitzer?

3112
01:38:03,931 --> 01:38:04,520
Cause it's not.

3113
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:05,353
It's,

3114
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:08,070
it's another white guy
was salt and pepper hair.

3115
01:38:08,130 --> 01:38:08,963
I know.

3116
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:09,960
I liked that guy.

3117
01:38:10,990 --> 01:38:11,640
I don't,

3118
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:12,850
not Anderson Cooper.

3119
01:38:12,851 --> 01:38:13,870
He's a giant gala.

3120
01:38:13,871 --> 01:38:15,040
We've legalized weed.

3121
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:15,850
What's the next,

3122
01:38:15,850 --> 01:38:16,140
what's,

3123
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:17,220
what's the next level drug?

3124
01:38:17,221 --> 01:38:20,730
You go to the dressing and the about
cigarettes texting in the back.

3125
01:38:20,731 --> 01:38:21,421
I could see you.

3126
01:38:21,421 --> 01:38:22,630
Your face is lit up like it.

3127
01:38:22,631 --> 01:38:23,550
Tell him to go story.

3128
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:24,473
Go ahead.

3129
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:31,020
I love Texas in the dark.

3130
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:32,940
He was a dark and stormy night.

3131
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:39,150
We were at the comedy store.

3132
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:41,120
It's allegedly haunted.

3133
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:45,930
You see this is all just
fucking backlash for the cubs.

3134
01:38:45,931 --> 01:38:46,141
You know,

3135
01:38:46,141 --> 01:38:47,700
if the cubs lost troubled a lot.

3136
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:49,050
Ah,

3137
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:52,470
that goes to the hubs
is it doesn't matter.

3138
01:38:52,471 --> 01:38:54,010
It will make it a fucking come back.

3139
01:38:55,070 --> 01:38:57,360
Woo Doug.

3140
01:38:57,450 --> 01:39:00,010
It Trussell just kind of get a look guilty

3141
01:39:02,410 --> 01:39:02,651
duck.

3142
01:39:02,651 --> 01:39:06,250
When they took the fucking general lead
and they took that rebel flag off the

3143
01:39:06,251 --> 01:39:07,150
top of that bitch.

3144
01:39:07,330 --> 01:39:08,081
That's what people had.

3145
01:39:08,081 --> 01:39:09,860
Enough brought up nation,

3146
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:11,550
a lot of red on that map.

3147
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:12,740
That and Caitlyn Jenner,

3148
01:39:12,741 --> 01:39:13,900
there's a storm.

3149
01:39:14,690 --> 01:39:16,480
A Duncan Trussell just texted me,

3150
01:39:16,481 --> 01:39:17,680
make America great again.

3151
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:20,410
He couldn't be here in person.

3152
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:21,353
Him,

3153
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:22,421
man to man.

3154
01:39:22,421 --> 01:39:23,254
Fuck it.

3155
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:25,350
Hey,

3156
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:26,760
is anyone in the shoot?

3157
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:27,151
Dude,

3158
01:39:27,151 --> 01:39:27,870
Trump won.

3159
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:29,640
Trump is one 23 states.

3160
01:39:29,641 --> 01:39:30,930
He could still lose the election.

3161
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:31,631
Tell you what.

3162
01:39:31,631 --> 01:39:33,070
I was in big Tony Soprano fan.

3163
01:39:33,071 --> 01:39:34,150
I knew he was a murderer.

3164
01:39:36,190 --> 01:39:37,310
I love that dude.

3165
01:39:37,311 --> 01:39:37,990
I was looking at,

3166
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:38,741
come on Tony.

3167
01:39:38,741 --> 01:39:41,110
Pull herself together at your best.

3168
01:39:41,111 --> 01:39:42,070
You're really cool guy.

3169
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:44,041
She's one,

3170
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:44,401
one,

3171
01:39:44,401 --> 01:39:44,791
two,

3172
01:39:44,791 --> 01:39:45,241
three,

3173
01:39:45,241 --> 01:39:45,541
four,

3174
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:46,141
five,

3175
01:39:46,141 --> 01:39:46,531
six,

3176
01:39:46,531 --> 01:39:47,250
seven,

3177
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:47,870
eight

3178
01:39:47,870 --> 01:39:49,400
to that kid wouldn't shut the fuck up.

3179
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:50,673
Huh?

3180
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:54,860
Eight states to 23 and he's only
up by like fucking 10 points.

3181
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:57,560
I can't wrap my head around
this fucking election stuff.

3182
01:39:57,860 --> 01:39:58,820
Did a lot of great shit.

3183
01:39:58,821 --> 01:39:59,840
Plus he was a rapist.

3184
01:40:01,310 --> 01:40:02,790
Maybe got a separate,

3185
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,240
you gotta separate the two.

3186
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:08,340
Donald Trump could pull it together.

3187
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:12,660
It'll be like what a man
does on his own time.

3188
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:17,700
Yes is no reflection of
his artistic contributions.

3189
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:20,160
This man made a great cartoon,

3190
01:40:20,161 --> 01:40:22,590
a single camera shoot and sitcoms.

3191
01:40:22,591 --> 01:40:23,740
He ran the home.

3192
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:26,510
They're laughing and crying and cut.

3193
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:31,970
That's another story for the people
that are only engaging in audio brick

3194
01:40:32,431 --> 01:40:32,790
Christ.

3195
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:33,623
Everyone laughs

3196
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:37,360
and all I saw was plumber,

3197
01:40:38,850 --> 01:40:41,320
plumber crack her.

3198
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,350
It says the fucking amazing

3199
01:40:47,930 --> 01:40:49,490
make chicken strips great again.

3200
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:51,713
What is he eating?

3201
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,060
America is going to be great again.

3202
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:58,090
We're going to go back to horse rides
and we're gonna make our own food because

3203
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:02,140
there'll be no more grid after the war.

3204
01:41:02,141 --> 01:41:04,600
We kind of pieced it
together as good as we could.

3205
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:06,460
It turns out all the smart people.

3206
01:41:06,461 --> 01:41:07,480
Dot first

3207
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:10,990
maybe this is just a Nathan for you bit.

3208
01:41:11,030 --> 01:41:12,090
We're going to make it back

3209
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:15,380
into the fucking,

3210
01:41:15,381 --> 01:41:15,950
uh,

3211
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:16,783
CNN.

3212
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,790
We're all going to be
fly fishing for dinner.

3213
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:23,010
We're going to be skinny as fuck like
people from the civil war days and the

3214
01:41:23,011 --> 01:41:25,900
average dude weighed 125
pounds during the civil war.

3215
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:26,830
How about them apples?

3216
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:27,260
Wait,

3217
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:29,710
are we going to be cooking
venison on a freeway?

3218
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:30,553
Cause any

3219
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:36,160
tiny Monte people that can barely get
by mountain lions running through the

3220
01:41:36,381 --> 01:41:36,861
streets.

3221
01:41:36,861 --> 01:41:37,880
Is that what you want,

3222
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:40,671
by the way?

3223
01:41:40,671 --> 01:41:41,570
Do the elk spend?

3224
01:41:41,571 --> 01:41:42,170
Delicious.

3225
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:42,880
Thank you.

3226
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:43,020
No,

3227
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:43,700
you like it.

3228
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:48,140
I made this American chopped suey with
it and my wife gave a fucking bad review

3229
01:41:48,141 --> 01:41:50,630
before anybody even tasted
it and everybody just said,

3230
01:41:50,631 --> 01:41:51,400
fuck it like that.

3231
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:51,711
She goes,

3232
01:41:51,711 --> 01:41:53,000
it looks like hamburger helper.

3233
01:41:53,870 --> 01:41:55,460
I've been showering it for like four days.

3234
01:41:55,461 --> 01:41:57,740
Like I had a respect for that
fucking health that you shot.

3235
01:41:57,741 --> 01:41:59,000
It's like I'm eating all this shit.

3236
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:00,850
I don't care if it's fucking bed.

3237
01:42:01,310 --> 01:42:02,600
Does it make you more aggressive?

3238
01:42:02,930 --> 01:42:03,470
What?

3239
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:04,303
No,

3240
01:42:05,310 --> 01:42:05,630
no,

3241
01:42:05,630 --> 01:42:06,051
Joe,

3242
01:42:06,051 --> 01:42:06,960
you're fucking loaded.

3243
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:07,833
Tick.

3244
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:11,660
Okay.

3245
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:13,220
Somebody gets in my face.

3246
01:42:13,221 --> 01:42:15,880
That might cause me to get more lunatic.

3247
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:17,310
Ate a little bit of protein.

3248
01:42:18,810 --> 01:42:22,020
You had to beat the fuck out of people
for like three decades before you could

3249
01:42:22,021 --> 01:42:22,854
like chill,

3250
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,180
smoke a little weed,

3251
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:26,430
put on your little rascals hat.

3252
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:27,653
It's fucking chill.

3253
01:42:33,710 --> 01:42:34,980
I love him to death.

3254
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:41,400
This guy is the most testosterone
fucking fill dude I've ever met.

3255
01:42:41,981 --> 01:42:42,814
That's why I love him.

3256
01:42:42,850 --> 01:42:43,683
I love him.

3257
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:47,110
He's like every guy in men
Boston fucking welded together.

3258
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:47,953
He's crazy.

3259
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,730
Will haunt me for the rest of my,

3260
01:42:53,890 --> 01:42:54,470
no,

3261
01:42:54,470 --> 01:42:54,840
no.

3262
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,530
Put this on Russian.

3263
01:42:58,090 --> 01:42:59,320
He's crushing that hat.

3264
01:42:59,321 --> 01:42:59,681
Come on.

3265
01:42:59,681 --> 01:43:00,341
You know where he is.

3266
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:01,030
You're killing it.

3267
01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:01,863
I love it.

3268
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:02,883
I love it.

3269
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:04,360
You don't have to balance it out.

3270
01:43:04,361 --> 01:43:05,194
I like it.

3271
01:43:07,450 --> 01:43:08,380
I'm laughing at me too.

3272
01:43:08,381 --> 01:43:09,550
I'll never put this thing on again.

3273
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:10,121
No,

3274
01:43:10,121 --> 01:43:10,901
you shut up dude.

3275
01:43:10,901 --> 01:43:12,460
I'm going to stick it in the fireplace.

3276
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,500
You shouldn't know
you're killing it though.

3277
01:43:14,650 --> 01:43:17,080
We'll keep it on for when the
papers come out in the morning.

3278
01:43:17,081 --> 01:43:18,040
Extra extra.

3279
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:19,210
Read all about it.

3280
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:24,420
Charlie.

3281
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:24,850
Finally,

3282
01:43:24,850 --> 01:43:26,230
Bill's a fucking bed.

3283
01:43:34,910 --> 01:43:35,743
This is,

3284
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:37,070
what do we do now,

3285
01:43:37,071 --> 01:43:37,904
folks?

3286
01:43:38,930 --> 01:43:43,930
Have you ever had someone like make fun
of you to a point where it affected the

3287
01:43:45,951 --> 01:43:46,880
rest of your life?

3288
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:53,220
Teresa Neal.

3289
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:56,170
Every fucking two days when you saw

3290
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:02,750
these feel best friend named Tom Segura,

3291
01:44:03,170 --> 01:44:05,180
when Patrice passed away.

3292
01:44:05,290 --> 01:44:05,800
Ah,

3293
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:06,431
Tommy,

3294
01:44:06,431 --> 01:44:06,940
Tommy.

3295
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:08,290
When Patrice died,

3296
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,280
I didn't know him well,

3297
01:44:09,281 --> 01:44:10,750
but there was part of me that went.

3298
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:14,830
It was isis is no longer a threat
because he was so terrifying.

3299
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:19,180
I never got on his badge
on the funniest I ever met,

3300
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:21,490
but I was so scared.

3301
01:44:21,491 --> 01:44:24,080
I'll tell you how bad he gets this close.

3302
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:28,930
He turned the biggest loud mouth comedians
into fucking audience members and he

3303
01:44:28,931 --> 01:44:29,800
would be out on the street.

3304
01:44:29,801 --> 01:44:33,070
I'm selling one night he fucked with
some transvestite and they went back and

3305
01:44:33,071 --> 01:44:34,390
forth giving each other shit.

3306
01:44:34,391 --> 01:44:35,080
It was fucking,

3307
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:37,000
she got a good one and she said to him,

3308
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:37,781
she goes,

3309
01:44:37,781 --> 01:44:39,760
you got so many spaces between your teeth,

3310
01:44:39,761 --> 01:44:41,140
it looks like your tongue's in jail.

3311
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:45,270
We were all fucking flipping
out and it's a thing.

3312
01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:47,040
He started on the panel,

3313
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:49,010
weathered that storm.

3314
01:44:49,011 --> 01:44:49,970
He laid on the ropes.

3315
01:44:49,971 --> 01:44:54,170
Like Ali knew that she just had stopped
jokes cause he looked at me and he shook

3316
01:44:54,171 --> 01:44:54,690
it off going,

3317
01:44:54,690 --> 01:44:56,210
that's just fucking stock shit.

3318
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:57,201
Like he had heard it,

3319
01:44:57,201 --> 01:44:58,011
but I was so white.

3320
01:44:58,011 --> 01:44:58,520
I was like,

3321
01:44:58,520 --> 01:44:58,731
Ooh,

3322
01:44:58,731 --> 01:45:00,110
that's brand new to me.

3323
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:01,280
That's hilarious.

3324
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:03,980
And he sees this light
manner than a thousand times.

3325
01:45:03,981 --> 01:45:05,300
And when she ran out of the shit,

3326
01:45:05,301 --> 01:45:05,720
dude,

3327
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:08,000
he fucking destroyed her
and she had a walk off man.

3328
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:08,541
It was fucking,

3329
01:45:08,541 --> 01:45:08,990
it was,

3330
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:09,590
it was.

3331
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:10,371
It was unreal.

3332
01:45:10,371 --> 01:45:10,581
Dude.

3333
01:45:10,581 --> 01:45:11,760
I'm as literally as Jeff Ross,

3334
01:45:11,761 --> 01:45:12,050
me,

3335
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:12,381
David,

3336
01:45:12,381 --> 01:45:15,740
tell Bobby Kelly some of the
biggest fucking comics ever.

3337
01:45:15,741 --> 01:45:17,000
We just sat there and watched it with one.

3338
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:17,990
If you ever see,

3339
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:18,823
you ever see that?

3340
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:20,743
That that,

3341
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:25,250
that biggie video of went before he
was famous when he was freestyle and he

3342
01:45:25,251 --> 01:45:26,840
trashed that dude stooped.

3343
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:28,760
It was the comedy version of that dude.

3344
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:29,091
No,

3345
01:45:29,091 --> 01:45:30,290
not even exaggerating.

3346
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:31,460
It was fucking unbelievable.

3347
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:31,960
Go ahead.

3348
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:32,190
All right,

3349
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:33,320
well first of all,

3350
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:35,610
you have a story about some time,

3351
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:40,100
but that's another who's the
scariest comic is a good question,

3352
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:44,180
but tell your story about when you get
insulted that it stayed with you for

3353
01:45:44,181 --> 01:45:45,014
life.

3354
01:45:46,130 --> 01:45:47,150
You jumped up.

3355
01:45:47,470 --> 01:45:48,950
You're going to get a story.

3356
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:50,273
I get a,

3357
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:51,920
I'm to opt out of this voting.

3358
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:54,200
All right then I'm bringing in Hay.

3359
01:45:56,170 --> 01:45:57,003
We need some,

3360
01:45:57,230 --> 01:45:58,760
we need some beaver in here.

3361
01:45:58,850 --> 01:46:01,190
Ellen Earth Kerrigan.

3362
01:46:01,191 --> 01:46:02,570
Fucking take over for me.

3363
01:46:02,571 --> 01:46:03,650
I need a cigarette.

3364
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:07,330
I need to flush my own head
down a toilet Kerrigan.

3365
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:07,671
No,

3366
01:46:07,671 --> 01:46:08,450
you're right here.

3367
01:46:08,450 --> 01:46:09,500
You're taking my spot.

3368
01:46:10,510 --> 01:46:11,540
You're right here.

3369
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:12,433
I'll hold it.

3370
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:13,293
Oh Shit.

3371
01:46:15,370 --> 01:46:16,203
Oh Shit.

3372
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:16,921
What's up?

3373
01:46:16,921 --> 01:46:17,754
My little friend

3374
01:46:19,090 --> 01:46:23,360
plus hilarious comedian plus
waitress at the comedy store.

3375
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:24,420
Who needs it?

3376
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:24,810
No,

3377
01:46:24,810 --> 01:46:25,643
Eleanor.

3378
01:46:26,730 --> 01:46:27,061
Eleanor.

3379
01:46:27,061 --> 01:46:27,270
When?

3380
01:46:27,270 --> 01:46:27,571
When?

3381
01:46:27,571 --> 01:46:29,010
When I first started working here,

3382
01:46:29,130 --> 01:46:30,260
I would always go to her when,

3383
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,530
when new people would come into town,

3384
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:32,850
if I hadn't seen him,

3385
01:46:32,851 --> 01:46:33,210
I go,

3386
01:46:33,210 --> 01:46:34,160
I heard that guy's really funny.

3387
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:35,013
She would go,

3388
01:46:37,110 --> 01:46:37,943
she would let me know.

3389
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:39,013
It's true.

3390
01:46:39,030 --> 01:46:39,863
What's a matter of right?

3391
01:46:40,070 --> 01:46:42,380
Because this thing keeps
freezing on key shit.

3392
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:43,250
Oh Shit.

3393
01:46:43,251 --> 01:46:46,040
This laptop that doesn't have
a fucking mouse or anything,

3394
01:46:46,041 --> 01:46:46,910
you can click on.

3395
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:50,160
It's like watching porn and
it freezes on the dude's face.

3396
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:54,450
Yeah.

3397
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:58,220
Oh my God.

3398
01:46:58,221 --> 01:46:59,054
This is,

3399
01:46:59,150 --> 01:46:59,983
yeah.

3400
01:47:00,070 --> 01:47:01,240
This is a fucking now,

3401
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:02,180
but are you scared?

3402
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:03,493
A little bit.

3403
01:47:04,010 --> 01:47:05,420
What are you scared about most?

3404
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:06,613
Ah,

3405
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,070
you grabbing pussy grabbing.

3406
01:47:10,071 --> 01:47:10,904
That's fine with me.

3407
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:12,073
Uh,

3408
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:15,620
I prefer that more of an Ain as grabber.

3409
01:47:15,650 --> 01:47:15,831
Oh,

3410
01:47:15,831 --> 01:47:16,664
thanks.

3411
01:47:17,630 --> 01:47:18,920
Got that wrestling background.

3412
01:47:19,270 --> 01:47:20,200
You don't have to describe it.

3413
01:47:20,210 --> 01:47:21,011
They're going to ping you.

3414
01:47:21,011 --> 01:47:22,530
You're just give me all fucking fish.

3415
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:25,320
Fish,

3416
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:26,153
hook,

3417
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:28,560
reach around fishing.

3418
01:47:32,770 --> 01:47:33,710
Fucking coolest.

3419
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:35,360
There's in the business.

3420
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:37,580
I'm not doing bleeding.

3421
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:38,391
Nevada.

3422
01:47:38,391 --> 01:47:40,010
She's leading Pennsylvania.

3423
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:40,933
I'll thank God,

3424
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:42,131
dude.

3425
01:47:42,131 --> 01:47:44,410
This is coming down to the fucking why.

3426
01:47:44,411 --> 01:47:44,930
Yeah.

3427
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:45,763
How do

3428
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:48,933

3429
01:47:49,870 --> 01:47:52,850

3430
01:47:52,851 --> 01:47:55,160
no vaginal stick it in her ass.

3431
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:56,270
He's fucking,

3432
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:57,860
he's killing it.

3433
01:47:57,861 --> 01:48:02,120
Hillary is 52 to 21 and
some other mother fuckers.

3434
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:03,290
Maybe that was just a county.

3435
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:04,660
I get excited.

3436
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:06,650
I get excited about things.

3437
01:48:06,770 --> 01:48:08,450
I see numbers and I flipped by

3438
01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:13,770
great commentating on Al Capone's vault.

3439
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:15,860
You guys like 10 times and I apologize.

3440
01:48:16,070 --> 01:48:17,380
I'm trying to do my best.

3441
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:18,223
I'm going to go with this.

3442
01:48:18,260 --> 01:48:20,090
I'm not cool with this technology shit.

3443
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:21,290
We're about to open it up.

3444
01:48:21,350 --> 01:48:22,183
Nothing.

3445
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:23,163
Nothing.

3446
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:24,011
All right.

3447
01:48:24,011 --> 01:48:24,401
Michigan,

3448
01:48:24,401 --> 01:48:24,851
New Hampshire,

3449
01:48:24,851 --> 01:48:25,391
Pennsylvania,

3450
01:48:25,391 --> 01:48:25,960
Wisconsin.

3451
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:26,860
Too early to call.

3452
01:48:27,490 --> 01:48:29,050
As much as I've been
fucking you guys over.

3453
01:48:29,051 --> 01:48:30,100
If you really gave a shit,

3454
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:31,180
you wouldn't be here.

3455
01:48:34,670 --> 01:48:36,560
How do you think like
fucking do caucus there?

3456
01:48:36,561 --> 01:48:38,020
Walter Mondale feels

3457
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:40,610
got blown out.

3458
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:41,933
Gary Hart.

3459
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:42,341
Yeah,

3460
01:48:42,341 --> 01:48:43,174
exactly.

3461
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:45,320
She sucked my Dick.

3462
01:48:45,321 --> 01:48:46,340
Go Fuck Yourself.

3463
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:47,810
It was great on the bow.

3464
01:48:47,930 --> 01:48:48,763
Anyway.

3465
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:51,831
I don't,

3466
01:48:51,831 --> 01:48:53,250
I don't know if I'm scared though.

3467
01:48:53,251 --> 01:48:53,481
Joe,

3468
01:48:53,481 --> 01:48:54,000
like you said,

3469
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:54,321
you said,

3470
01:48:54,321 --> 01:48:55,340
what am I scared of?

3471
01:48:55,341 --> 01:48:58,700
I mean maybe just just the Donald
Trump is such a fucking loose cannon,

3472
01:48:58,701 --> 01:49:00,800
but that could work for us.

3473
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:01,693
No

3474
01:49:01,870 --> 01:49:02,250
comments.

3475
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:02,630
Oh,

3476
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:03,140
I see.

3477
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:03,973
Comedy wise.

3478
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:04,833
I like glass

3479
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:08,280
ineffective way to run a bunch of
people that you don't even know.

3480
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:10,080
True.

3481
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:10,291
Hey,

3482
01:49:10,291 --> 01:49:11,820
I'm looking to fucking buy a house.

3483
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:14,330
Maybe prices will fucking go down.

3484
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,570
What's everybody leaves the fucking day.

3485
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:18,690
So that's a bright side.

3486
01:49:18,790 --> 01:49:21,150
Once we'll be able to afford
a house in silver lake.

3487
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:23,341
All right,

Dye harder.

3491
01:49:32,341 --> 01:49:35,180
You gotta give him a respect
diehard in the corner.

3492
01:49:35,190 --> 01:49:35,521
Come on.

3493
01:49:35,521 --> 01:49:37,050
Trump supporter in Hollywood.

01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:40,660

Oh Dude is nine o'clock Pacific time.

3497
01:49:51,891 --> 01:49:54,170
New Hampshire is still too close to call.

3498
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:55,670
It's fucking crazy.

3499
01:49:55,671 --> 01:49:56,510
It's midnight out there.

3500
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:57,770
Only 13 people up there.

3501
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:58,171
Fuck.

3502
01:49:58,171 --> 01:49:59,840
Are they talking about

3503
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:03,550

3504
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:04,180
Nah.

3505
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:05,570
Who has the answers?

3506
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:06,560
Kyle country.

3507
01:50:06,561 --> 01:50:07,660
That's God's country.

3508
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:09,580
It's fucking beautiful.

3509
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:10,893
Vermont.

3510
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:16,090
All those trees and people are addicted
to heroin back out there and the

3511
01:50:16,091 --> 01:50:16,924
florist.

3512
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:20,530
Do we have a lot of Trump supporters?

3513
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:21,760
I'm kidding.

3514
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:22,870
It's frozen again.

3515
01:50:22,871 --> 01:50:23,621
This fucking thing.

3516
01:50:23,621 --> 01:50:24,850
You got to bring it down.

3517
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:25,140
Okay,

3518
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:26,230
so then you bring it back up.

3519
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:30,033
I don't think he's shy.

3520
01:50:30,270 --> 01:50:30,481
Did I?

3521
01:50:30,481 --> 01:50:31,314
Lost it?

3522
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,273
Some magnet.

3523
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:33,301
Bill Baer.

3524
01:50:33,301 --> 01:50:34,590
Worst Ipod,

3525
01:50:36,090 --> 01:50:40,800
shitty juggler ever brought
it down at broad peck up.

3526
01:50:40,801 --> 01:50:41,634
That works at home.

3527
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:43,501
Dean del Rey.

3528
01:50:43,501 --> 01:50:44,470
Where's the bill burr?

3529
01:50:52,010 --> 01:50:53,270
Is Anybody?

3530
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:54,840
I don't know.

3531
01:50:58,680 --> 01:50:59,513
Jamie.

3532
01:50:59,810 --> 01:51:00,740
Ridiculous.

3533
01:51:00,860 --> 01:51:01,693
One old.

3534
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:04,480
That's where it's going.

3535
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:09,250
This is the closest I'll ever
beat it being my Goldberg.

3536
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,190
You're correct Joe.

3537
01:51:10,210 --> 01:51:12,030
They what they need to do is posture up

3538
01:51:12,090 --> 01:51:13,670
right now with the IPAC.

3539
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:16,870
You're absolutely
correct and we didn't pay

3540
01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:23,570
bearing round trying to fix the
IPAD and they are in big trouble.

3541
01:51:25,471 --> 01:51:27,850
Bulk of up reputations on the line.

3542
01:51:28,470 --> 01:51:30,090
They don't know how to bend up the thing

3543
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:33,300
to this fucking thing.

3544
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:35,300
They threw the iPad back.

3545
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:36,460
Let's just go with the pat.

3546
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:40,020
Kevin Durant is all golden state.

3547
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:41,520
Are you buying or selling?

3548
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:44,160
That's what you get
with your non committal.

3549
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:46,680
That fucking piece of shit
is neither a keyboard.

3550
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:49,680
And if you are both,

3551
01:51:49,681 --> 01:51:50,514
you do not exist.

3552
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:50,921
Yes.

3553
01:51:50,921 --> 01:51:54,450
This represents the transgender
bathrooms that we lead in this

3554
01:51:54,530 --> 01:51:55,363
fuck

3555
01:51:56,860 --> 01:52:01,340
that represents 71 at
Santa decried on the fence.

3556
01:52:01,430 --> 01:52:02,540
No fairness.

3557
01:52:02,650 --> 01:52:02,930
Oh,

3558
01:52:02,930 --> 01:52:03,763
thank you.

3559
01:52:04,370 --> 01:52:05,360
We could still use your health.

3560
01:52:07,550 --> 01:52:08,690
How do you make it stand up?

3561
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:09,281
You don't.

3562
01:52:09,281 --> 01:52:10,520
You hold it like a man.

3563
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:11,703
I got it.

3564
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:13,640
You hold it like a man.

3565
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:15,070
Dean,

3566
01:52:15,070 --> 01:52:15,980
Dean del Rey.

3567
01:52:16,100 --> 01:52:16,640
Stop.

3568
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,830
You guys should choose
fucking stupid for that thing.

3569
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:24,980
That doesn't make any sense.

3570
01:52:24,981 --> 01:52:25,814
Does that make sense?

3571
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:28,910
Does it no flipping around.

3572
01:52:28,970 --> 01:52:29,691
Oh Shit.

3573
01:52:29,691 --> 01:52:30,600
Trump won.

3574
01:52:30,740 --> 01:52:32,570
Oh kidding.

3575
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:45,860
Oh the air got sucked of the room

3576
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:48,450
mixed up when I had mother
fucker in the corner.

3577
01:52:48,451 --> 01:52:49,161
I got you.

3578
01:52:49,161 --> 01:52:49,994
I got you.

3579
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:53,023
Huh?

3580
01:52:54,210 --> 01:52:54,670
Bill Baer.

3581
01:52:54,670 --> 01:52:55,560
Ladies and gentlemen.

3582
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:00,153
Huh?

3583
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:04,140
Gimme that shit bitch.

3584
01:53:04,150 --> 01:53:06,720
You guys on a Caltrans.

3585
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:08,640
God Damn my pad.

3586
01:53:08,641 --> 01:53:10,430
If you let it fly away,

3587
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:11,221
put the mic.

3588
01:53:11,221 --> 01:53:12,054
Stand behind it.

3589
01:53:14,010 --> 01:53:15,960
Any other document in front of you?

3590
01:53:16,170 --> 01:53:18,130
Don't do it to

3591
01:53:21,530 --> 01:53:23,650
kill the mic.

3592
01:53:23,651 --> 01:53:24,484
Stand helper.

3593
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:29,340
There were some who feels
like they're invested in this.

3594
01:53:29,490 --> 01:53:30,960
Did people feel invested in this?

3595
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:31,831
But Dude,

3596
01:53:31,831 --> 01:53:32,280
I'm a job.

3597
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:34,580
This is like one of the great
games I've ever watched.

3598
01:53:34,581 --> 01:53:35,101
Some sports.

3599
01:53:35,101 --> 01:53:36,360
This is fucking incredible.

3600
01:53:36,540 --> 01:53:39,600
Two 32 two oh nine with
fucking 10 minutes to go.

3601
01:53:40,950 --> 01:53:43,290
Donald Trump kicking
off the Hillary Clinton.

3602
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:44,240
Can I ask you?

3603
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:45,073
You Take it,

3604
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:50,233
Huh?

3605
01:53:53,910 --> 01:53:54,521
That's true.

3606
01:53:54,521 --> 01:53:58,610
What's your favorite rep before today?

3607
01:53:58,690 --> 01:53:59,523
Shoes.

3608
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:00,873
Wow.

3609
01:54:00,940 --> 01:54:01,750
Wow.

3610
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:02,351
You could have gotten,

3611
01:54:02,351 --> 01:54:03,071
if you went to Vegas,

3612
01:54:03,071 --> 01:54:03,904
you bet a buck.

3613
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:06,430
You would've won $10 everybody.

3614
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:10,420
He'll go on and Mcdonald's gets
you 10 of those dollar meals.

3615
01:54:10,590 --> 01:54:15,590
I walked down the street with the
little burger king hat on Mcdonald's,

3616
01:54:15,851 --> 01:54:18,310
Burger King or whatever you want to win.

3617
01:54:19,710 --> 01:54:24,700
I am such a cunt that
when Hillary's winning,

3618
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:26,020
I want Trump to win.

3619
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:26,790
Well,

3620
01:54:26,790 --> 01:54:27,790
Trump is winning

3621
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:32,950
because I live in La.

3622
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:35,590
I like saying Trump shit
just to annoy people.

3623
01:54:35,591 --> 01:54:37,120
But if I lived in Kentucky,

3624
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:38,441
I would be gone.

3625
01:54:38,441 --> 01:54:40,180
I would be going like Hillary,

3626
01:54:40,181 --> 01:54:40,661
man.

3627
01:54:40,661 --> 01:54:41,201
I would just,

3628
01:54:41,201 --> 01:54:43,240
I just like annoying people.

3629
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:44,860
That's what it really comes down to.

3630
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:45,821
Like,

3631
01:54:45,821 --> 01:54:46,630
you know,

3632
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:49,060
as much as people think I'm a misogynist,

3633
01:54:49,090 --> 01:54:54,090
I agree with 90% of the shit feminists
say until it comes out of a woman's mouth

3634
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:56,453
arguing,

3635
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:57,753
dare you,

3636
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:01,300
because that's who I am.

3637
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:06,550
That's who I am and I understand that
and I don't try to steer away from it.

3638
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:09,540
The machine per Chrysler show.

3639
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:11,230
Friday night,

3640
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:14,950
10:00 PM 11,

3641
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:15,880
right?

3642
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:17,210
10:00 PM on showtime.

3643
01:55:17,211 --> 01:55:18,170
It's called the machine.

3644
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:19,350
What did you live in the mountains?

3645
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:20,761
What could he get?

3646
01:55:20,761 --> 01:55:22,050
11:00 PM 11.

3647
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:22,430
Uh,

3648
01:55:22,430 --> 01:55:23,011
I asked him,

3649
01:55:23,011 --> 01:55:23,281
I said,

3650
01:55:23,281 --> 01:55:24,780
why don't we go to 11 1111?

3651
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:28,500
Well you want to lose a million viewers
and we can do that or we can do it at

3652
01:55:28,501 --> 01:55:29,370
10:00 PM and I was like,

3653
01:55:29,371 --> 01:55:29,491
oh,

3654
01:55:29,491 --> 01:55:30,324
let's do it at 10:00 PM

3655
01:55:30,490 --> 01:55:31,323
that's good.

3656
01:55:33,850 --> 01:55:34,690
Where are we at bill?

3657
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:35,690
Uh,

3658
01:55:35,690 --> 01:55:38,230
we're at two 32 two oh nine Donald Trump.

3659
01:55:38,231 --> 01:55:43,231
But there's still some sandals to 38
update too is better than connected to the

3660
01:55:48,451 --> 01:55:49,140
keyboard.

3661
01:55:49,140 --> 01:55:49,770
Yeah.

3662
01:55:49,770 --> 01:55:52,850
Two 44 two who's who's the Trump?

3663
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:55,470
Oh Two oh nine.

3664
01:55:55,590 --> 01:55:56,371
Oh my God.

3665
01:55:56,371 --> 01:55:59,190
A reality TV show star is pulling ahead.

3666
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:01,950
Only the wife of a president.

3667
01:56:01,951 --> 01:56:02,370
You know,

3668
01:56:02,370 --> 01:56:04,830
he should have chose Dat
Phan as his running mate,

3669
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:05,910
but you're ready to pick up on it.

3670
01:56:05,911 --> 01:56:06,744
The only thing good about

3671
01:56:08,430 --> 01:56:09,900
MILF porn is going to take off.

3672
01:56:09,901 --> 01:56:13,310
Like first lady porn is just
going to skyrocket your point.

3673
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:15,360
First Lady Porn.

3674
01:56:15,990 --> 01:56:16,341
Hey,

3675
01:56:16,341 --> 01:56:18,390
we'll be starting the actual Hillary wins.

3676
01:56:18,391 --> 01:56:21,360
And bill gets back into the
like sort of the office,

3677
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:25,890
but he doesn't have the responsibility
having to take calls and all of that

3678
01:56:25,891 --> 01:56:26,191
shit.

3679
01:56:26,191 --> 01:56:29,340
Like how much pussy is
this guy going to get?

3680
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:31,440
Like this is what's amazing about Hillary.

3681
01:56:31,590 --> 01:56:35,880
She did the exact same thing Al Gore did
was she just completely shut that guy

3682
01:56:35,881 --> 01:56:36,510
out of his,

3683
01:56:36,510 --> 01:56:38,880
out of a fucking campaign
because he's such a,

3684
01:56:38,881 --> 01:56:39,600
you know,

3685
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:43,470
you start sticking cigars
and you know people's twats.

3686
01:56:43,471 --> 01:56:45,360
I mean people got to take a step back.

3687
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:50,430
I think will's going to play it straight
up all first ladies going to do the

3688
01:56:50,431 --> 01:56:51,264
dishes,

3689
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:52,411
you know what I mean?

3690
01:56:52,411 --> 01:56:53,430
Just a little laundry,

3691
01:56:53,431 --> 01:56:54,390
shit like that.

3692
01:56:55,310 --> 01:56:56,200
Somebody still,

3693
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,380
somebody called it the
first gentleman today.

3694
01:56:58,381 --> 01:56:59,214
Did you see that?

3695
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:01,080
The guys the furthest from a gentleman,

3696
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:03,330
you know what I love about him?

3697
01:57:04,110 --> 01:57:05,070
I'm not judging him,

3698
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:07,940
but when Trump called him off
for being a pussy hound too,

3699
01:57:07,941 --> 01:57:09,960
and he had the fucking balls
to sit there with that,

3700
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:12,030
that fucking angry look on his face,

3701
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:13,170
he should've just been like,

3702
01:57:13,171 --> 01:57:13,681
hey,

3703
01:57:13,681 --> 01:57:14,310
you got me.

3704
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:15,143
You got it.

3705
01:57:16,150 --> 01:57:16,983
I love it.

3706
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:18,460
I Love Hillary.

3707
01:57:18,461 --> 01:57:18,920
But

3708
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:20,030
love Pussy.

3709
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:22,760
I Love Hillary enough
to stay with their by.

3710
01:57:22,761 --> 01:57:23,720
You know the fucking,

3711
01:57:23,721 --> 01:57:25,940
if you know that,

3712
01:57:26,450 --> 01:57:28,220
that Sweet Paula Jones Pussy

3713
01:57:30,450 --> 01:57:32,000
with round walls,

3714
01:57:32,270 --> 01:57:33,650
what am I supposed to do?

3715
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:37,520
I've got a nice humor door with some
of the Cubans that Kennedy bought right

3716
01:57:37,521 --> 01:57:38,690
before the embargo.

3717
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:41,450
What am I supposed to do?

3718
01:57:41,451 --> 01:57:44,510
What is any person supposed
to do in that situation?

3719
01:57:44,660 --> 01:57:49,660
That's what I ask you as we wait for
the final decision on Pennsylvania.

3720
01:57:50,030 --> 01:57:50,863
It is riveting.

3721
01:57:52,070 --> 01:57:52,903
You're alive,

3722
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,233
Bill.

3723
01:57:54,470 --> 01:57:55,790
Best in Sarasota.

3724
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,170
How high are you right now?

3725
01:57:57,390 --> 01:57:58,340
I heads he took one hit.

3726
01:57:58,341 --> 01:57:59,150
It's this Jamison.

3727
01:57:59,150 --> 01:58:00,350
Give credit where credit is due.

3728
01:58:03,650 --> 01:58:04,483
I think it's both.

3729
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:04,870
No,

3730
01:58:04,870 --> 01:58:05,051
no,

3731
01:58:05,051 --> 01:58:05,500
no.

3732
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:05,981
You weed.

3733
01:58:05,981 --> 01:58:08,920
Guys always want to take
credit for fucking this.

3734
01:58:08,921 --> 01:58:09,521
Hey Man.

3735
01:58:09,521 --> 01:58:10,660
Where'd that thinking come from,

3736
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:12,683
Jamison.

3737
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:13,553
All right.

3738
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:17,820
I'm a big fan of alcohol.

3739
01:58:17,860 --> 01:58:18,693
I agree.

3740
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:20,210
You spend time.

3741
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:20,991
Hey Joe.

3742
01:58:20,991 --> 01:58:21,620
You know what?

3743
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:23,690
I'm a big fan of you and
that's the pot speaking,

3744
01:58:24,380 --> 01:58:25,213
right?

3745
01:58:28,790 --> 01:58:29,091
By the way,

3746
01:58:29,091 --> 01:58:31,400
that is a moment that
we'll lose podcast ever.

3747
01:58:31,430 --> 01:58:32,270
I'm am such a good thing.

3748
01:58:32,271 --> 01:58:33,680
Should be on MSNBC.

3749
01:58:33,681 --> 01:58:36,060
This is fucking how the
news should have delivered.

3750
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:37,550
Let's just say one thing.

3751
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:42,340
It is Donald Trump projected to
when I was six electoral votes

3752
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,980
dead.

3753
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:45,230
No shafted.

3754
01:58:46,270 --> 01:58:47,110
I loved Iowa,

3755
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:48,040
but they loved guns.

3756
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:48,371
They're like,

3757
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:48,881
listen bitch,

3758
01:58:48,881 --> 01:58:50,380
we got important decisions to make.

3759
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:53,530
Number one is we live in the
middle of fucking nowhere.

3760
01:58:53,830 --> 01:58:54,760
We need guns.

3761
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:55,740
It's

3762
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:57,390
38 two oh nine

3763
01:58:57,500 --> 01:59:00,290
Trump iPhone,

3764
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:05,780
iPhone two 34 on t
mobile bitch to 44 yeah,

3765
01:59:06,020 --> 01:59:07,130
fine bro.

3766
01:59:07,230 --> 01:59:09,660
I know we're running out
of San Diego state here.

3767
01:59:09,661 --> 01:59:10,710
This doesn't look good,

3768
01:59:10,711 --> 01:59:11,544
man.

3769
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:21,150
Two 44 where's Waldo says
it's two 44 over here.

3770
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:22,840
What are you going,

3771
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:24,010
you got that new sprint.

3772
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,941
Is that what you got to say?

3773
01:59:24,941 --> 01:59:28,540
That I've always been for Trump and I'm
really excited about Trump and we need

3774
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:32,380
and when he looks back and watches this
big podcasts that happened that I was

3775
01:59:32,381 --> 01:59:35,460
always for you Donald L.

3776
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:35,580
Dot.

3777
01:59:35,580 --> 01:59:36,490
Cleansing.

3778
01:59:36,590 --> 01:59:40,900
I'm going to be one of your top spokesman
claiming it now that have all these

3779
01:59:40,901 --> 01:59:42,850
guys and they're all
making jokes against you.

3780
01:59:42,851 --> 01:59:44,160
I was on your slide body,

3781
01:59:45,090 --> 01:59:47,380
Tony Hinch stuffs like
the Nazi and the strain.

3782
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:49,041
I just want,

3783
01:59:49,041 --> 01:59:49,940
I just want to stay,

3784
01:59:49,941 --> 01:59:51,470
whatever the fuck this guy's doing.

3785
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:53,600
People are going to move
to Canada and Mexico,

3786
01:59:53,601 --> 01:59:55,000
but he's about to new there.

3787
01:59:55,010 --> 01:59:55,960
So that shit though.

3788
01:59:56,830 --> 01:59:59,600
I mean he's hitting the
red button like a fucking,

3789
01:59:59,601 --> 02:00:01,470
I don't know what Benjamin buttons.

3790
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:03,020
It's all gonna be fine.

3791
02:00:03,230 --> 02:00:04,220
It's all gonna be fine.

3792
02:00:04,221 --> 02:00:05,280
Everybody fuck way out.

3793
02:00:05,281 --> 02:00:06,200
We're all cool.

3794
02:00:06,201 --> 02:00:06,690
We're good.

3795
02:00:06,690 --> 02:00:06,841
Well,

3796
02:00:06,841 --> 02:00:08,490
he's going to quit in two years.

3797
02:00:08,491 --> 02:00:09,750
The I fucked this job.

3798
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:14,550
It's going to be the first guy will
be great and then it's vice president.

3799
02:00:14,551 --> 02:00:14,941
I'll be like,

3800
02:00:14,941 --> 02:00:15,900
you asshole

3801
02:00:16,990 --> 02:00:17,231
dude.

3802
02:00:17,231 --> 02:00:18,430
He'll quit over Twitter.

3803
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:19,080
Yeah.

3804
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:19,913
Yeah.

3805
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:22,450
All you gotta do is just
keep giving him shit.

3806
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:25,170
You won't even pay attention
to the foreign policy.

3807
02:00:25,171 --> 02:00:27,370
You'd be too busy tweeting
at fucking John Stewart.

3808
02:00:29,230 --> 02:00:30,520
Here's my new prediction.

3809
02:00:30,550 --> 02:00:31,750
In the next three months,

3810
02:00:32,020 --> 02:00:34,930
Donald Trump sells the white house.

3811
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:36,620
Yeah.

3812
02:00:36,620 --> 02:00:38,680
Just the fucking crazy billionaire.

3813
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:40,590
Who Isa Fuck I say he,

3814
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:42,310
he loads his name to it.

3815
02:00:42,311 --> 02:00:42,491
What?

3816
02:00:42,491 --> 02:00:43,270
That White House?

3817
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:44,103
Yeah.

3818
02:00:44,150 --> 02:00:45,120
He puts his name on it.

3819
02:00:45,121 --> 02:00:46,170
Like those shitty house.

3820
02:00:46,980 --> 02:00:47,190
Hi,

3821
02:00:47,190 --> 02:00:48,900
are you living in a shitty reality show?

3822
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:55,850
He's actually going to shoot
his new show in the White House.

3823
02:00:58,570 --> 02:01:00,710
Secretary of state apprentice style.

3824
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:01,573
Exactly.

3825
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:02,300
Exactly.

3826
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:03,830
Good foreign policy.

3827
02:01:03,950 --> 02:01:07,430
Moroso you get Pennsylvania

3828
02:01:10,670 --> 02:01:12,830
now we're waiting.

3829
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:13,431
This is,

3830
02:01:13,431 --> 02:01:14,230
this is the thing.

3831
02:01:14,230 --> 02:01:15,063
I was huge.

3832
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:20,240
Clinton is at 48.2%

3833
02:01:20,450 --> 02:01:23,420
to 45% she needs to shit.

3834
02:01:23,630 --> 02:01:24,500
If Trump takes,

3835
02:01:24,501 --> 02:01:25,870
this dude is fucking

3836
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,590
like Michael Corleone.

3837
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:31,120
Godfather to

3838
02:01:33,670 --> 02:01:36,250
a lot of Catholics in Pennsylvania.

3839
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:38,713
Yeah.

3840
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:40,460
Lot of Catholics in Pennsylvania.

3841
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:42,020
That's Trump territory right there.

3842
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:46,490
What's crazy is that people in other
countries are watching this 50 50 race.

3843
02:01:46,491 --> 02:01:49,160
Then they're watching it happen just
like we are and they're all like,

3844
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:49,680
oh,

3845
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:51,850
not so United after all

3846
02:01:54,710 --> 02:01:56,410
because we do it like many states,

3847
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:57,450
like fucking idiots.

3848
02:01:57,470 --> 02:02:01,000
That should just be straight
up popular vote bitches.

3849
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:04,190
It's split up.

3850
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:07,820
The map is redder than his face right now.

3851
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:09,320
Look at that.

3852
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:10,670
It's just the all red.

3853
02:02:10,780 --> 02:02:11,740
I got a question.

3854
02:02:11,770 --> 02:02:14,500
Is it about time that we dissolve dates?

3855
02:02:15,220 --> 02:02:15,730
Yeah.

3856
02:02:15,730 --> 02:02:16,810
Why isn't it when

3857
02:02:19,710 --> 02:02:20,543
you,

3858
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:25,090
when you take Pi entering
Colorado come a criminal,

3859
02:02:29,050 --> 02:02:30,180
why do we need states?

3860
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:32,320
States are like

3861
02:02:32,370 --> 02:02:35,730
this glorified boundaries
in between lines of dirt.

3862
02:02:35,731 --> 02:02:38,010
We arbitrarily draw and decide,

3863
02:02:38,011 --> 02:02:38,690
well,

3864
02:02:38,690 --> 02:02:40,620
we're used to ride with feathers.

3865
02:02:40,810 --> 02:02:43,530
They just thought this was Wyoming.

3866
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:49,200
I can't go there with my fucking gay
porn and people would get mad at me.

3867
02:02:50,160 --> 02:02:51,630
Throw me in a fucking prison.

3868
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:52,650
That's ridiculous,

3869
02:02:52,651 --> 02:02:53,250
right?

3870
02:02:53,250 --> 02:02:54,310
It is ridiculous,

3871
02:02:54,330 --> 02:02:54,911
but it's great.

3872
02:02:54,911 --> 02:02:55,980
It's a great feeling up.

3873
02:02:55,981 --> 02:02:58,710
Your progress as you
drive across the country.

3874
02:03:01,010 --> 02:03:01,590
America,

3875
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:04,210
you need them really good point markers.

3876
02:03:04,260 --> 02:03:07,440
We retained the name and
we just abandoned the idea.

3877
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:12,980
We can't all decide collectively
without electoral colleges,

3878
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:14,850
without senators and representative.

3879
02:03:14,851 --> 02:03:15,960
We don't need representatives.

3880
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:17,190
We don't ride horses.

3881
02:03:17,370 --> 02:03:18,203
We have

3882
02:03:18,890 --> 02:03:19,880
dare you pull me.

3883
02:03:19,881 --> 02:03:20,714
I'm

3884
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:23,390
talking off the top of my head.

3885
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:25,220
Barely know what the fuck I'm saying.

3886
02:03:29,470 --> 02:03:29,660
Hey,

3887
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:31,320
when are you going to
take a guy at the bar?

3888
02:03:31,321 --> 02:03:32,060
The button.

3889
02:03:32,060 --> 02:03:33,090
I don't even know you bro.

3890
02:03:34,870 --> 02:03:37,810
When are you going to take
me a wild boar hunting?

3891
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:38,650
I want to go to that.

3892
02:03:38,650 --> 02:03:39,341
We're going to do it in this,

3893
02:03:39,341 --> 02:03:40,174
Greg.

3894
02:03:41,190 --> 02:03:41,770
Well,

3895
02:03:41,770 --> 02:03:42,040
what?

3896
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:44,670
We're going to do a control.

3897
02:03:44,690 --> 02:03:46,090
Fucking blow his brains out.

3898
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:47,560
I don't like the noise.

3899
02:03:47,561 --> 02:03:49,720
They make a difficult shot.

3900
02:03:49,900 --> 02:03:50,860
What about this job?

3901
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:53,890
What if we divvy it up into
50 different countries?

3902
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:55,420
No,

3903
02:03:55,420 --> 02:03:56,253
no.

3904
02:03:56,980 --> 02:03:58,030
The United States.

3905
02:03:58,031 --> 02:03:58,780
You don't want to do that.

3906
02:03:58,780 --> 02:03:59,380
A designer.

3907
02:03:59,380 --> 02:04:00,340
Why would you do that?

3908
02:04:00,730 --> 02:04:02,710
Cause then you'd stay away
from certain countries,

3909
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:04,860
but you're all be vulnerable.

3910
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:08,650
They can pick you off where we can all
fucking go to war and he's 50 dude,

3911
02:04:08,690 --> 02:04:09,311
that's a don't,

3912
02:04:09,311 --> 02:04:10,810
don't give Trump any ideas.

3913
02:04:10,870 --> 02:04:11,620
Does that for me?

3914
02:04:11,620 --> 02:04:11,771
Oh,

3915
02:04:11,771 --> 02:04:14,590
problem is then listen.

3916
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:15,060
Good.

3917
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:17,890
The problem with that is that
Texas run the fucking country.

3918
02:04:18,940 --> 02:04:19,361
If we,

3919
02:04:19,361 --> 02:04:21,400
if we had a war of the countries,

3920
02:04:23,990 --> 02:04:26,450
take a hit off tigers,

3921
02:04:27,290 --> 02:04:28,540
they have nuclear weapons.

3922
02:04:29,610 --> 02:04:30,820
But if you're a Germaphobe,

3923
02:04:32,410 --> 02:04:33,910
I heard your herpes bit

3924
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:37,960
[inaudible] I got a

3925
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:39,020
great herpes story.

3926
02:04:39,021 --> 02:04:39,854
Went rogue it buddy

3927
02:04:42,130 --> 02:04:42,963
my first.

3928
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:47,380
I have the good herpes on my Dick.

3929
02:04:47,780 --> 02:04:48,613
Oh,

3930
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:51,160
has the unfortunate lip Herbie here.

3931
02:04:51,161 --> 02:04:52,780
And again I come back,

3932
02:04:52,781 --> 02:04:53,860
Dan Sores,

3933
02:04:55,690 --> 02:04:57,270
cold sores on your morals.

3934
02:04:57,590 --> 02:04:58,260
They don't go,

3935
02:04:58,260 --> 02:04:58,960
Ooh,

3936
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:01,510
is it chilly where you're
from and your Dick,

3937
02:05:02,980 --> 02:05:03,940
so Rogan,

3938
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:05,003
this is,

3939
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:06,700
I can just thank you dean.

3940
02:05:07,460 --> 02:05:08,470
Thanks so Rogan.

3941
02:05:08,471 --> 02:05:09,670
We're doing the man show.

3942
02:05:09,671 --> 02:05:10,510
This is before.

3943
02:05:10,511 --> 02:05:14,020
I've just like once I said I have herpes,

3944
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:16,450
almost every one of my friends he goes,

3945
02:05:16,570 --> 02:05:18,160
oh fuck I have herpes too

3946
02:05:19,910 --> 02:05:20,741
because we fucked.

3947
02:05:20,741 --> 02:05:25,741
They say like one out of five
that's including everybody
like your grandparents.

3948
02:05:26,980 --> 02:05:28,780
So if you're fucking,

3949
02:05:29,110 --> 02:05:30,220
it's like one out of two.

3950
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:37,200
So Rogan gets a cold sore on his
lip and I had just gotten val trex

3951
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:41,380
and we have to film the next day's a fuck.

3952
02:05:41,381 --> 02:05:45,190
I wish I had Valtrex cause I'm
getting a cold sore and I had it,

3953
02:05:45,490 --> 02:05:48,260
but I didn't want to
admit that I had heard.

3954
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:54,020
So I made him tape with a lot of
gunky makeup on his fucking face.

3955
02:05:57,530 --> 02:05:58,400
Sorry Joe.

3956
02:06:00,020 --> 02:06:01,400
How dare you Doug.

3957
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:02,121
Hey Bill.

3958
02:06:02,121 --> 02:06:04,940
Do you mind if I drink with my cock?

3959
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:05,331
No.

3960
02:06:05,331 --> 02:06:05,690
Why don't,

3961
02:06:05,690 --> 02:06:08,840
why don't you just pour it into
a glass like a goddamn gentleman

3962
02:06:08,890 --> 02:06:09,723
charts.

3963
02:06:10,750 --> 02:06:11,531
I don't know what happened,

3964
02:06:11,531 --> 02:06:13,370
but I was a little baby
when I realized it.

3965
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:19,450
I'd get these little sores on my lip
and I knew that one day one of my best

3966
02:06:19,451 --> 02:06:22,630
friends would shame me for these stores,

3967
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:25,210
these stores that I had no all over.

3968
02:06:25,211 --> 02:06:26,560
I was born with these tours.

3969
02:06:26,561 --> 02:06:28,440
I had him since I was a tiny little boy.

3970
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:29,470
Nervous and scared,

3971
02:06:29,560 --> 02:06:30,393
low back

3972
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:33,730
future.

3973
02:06:33,730 --> 02:06:38,730
But this guy getting coked up and bang
and hookers fucking driving on Greyhound

3974
02:06:39,731 --> 02:06:40,960
buses across the country.

3975
02:06:40,961 --> 02:06:42,280
Fucking everybody in the ass.

3976
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:46,300
This guy got herpes to maybe
different kinds of herpes.

3977
02:06:46,301 --> 02:06:47,020
What do you think?

3978
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:47,770
Huh?

3979
02:06:47,770 --> 02:06:48,850
Maybe the little baby.

3980
02:06:48,851 --> 02:06:53,020
The little kid should have got to decide
whether or not like I woke up one day.

3981
02:06:53,021 --> 02:06:53,651
I had cold sores.

3982
02:06:53,651 --> 02:06:54,730
I didn't fuck anybody.

3983
02:06:55,570 --> 02:06:56,410
Cold Sores.

3984
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:57,670
No coke,

3985
02:06:57,670 --> 02:06:58,900
no Adderall,

3986
02:06:58,960 --> 02:06:59,711
no mushrooms,

3987
02:06:59,711 --> 02:07:00,790
no bad decisions.

3988
02:07:00,940 --> 02:07:02,410
That's so boring.

3989
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:03,273
The fuck is this.

3990
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:05,660
Fuck this Doug.

3991
02:07:05,670 --> 02:07:06,191
Stan hope.

3992
02:07:06,191 --> 02:07:07,270
One of my best friends

3993
02:07:08,890 --> 02:07:09,723
sit on my lap.

3994
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:10,501
Geez Joe.

3995
02:07:10,501 --> 02:07:12,630
You don't have to be such a sore loser.

3996
02:07:23,140 --> 02:07:23,381
No,

3997
02:07:23,381 --> 02:07:23,681
Doug,

3998
02:07:23,681 --> 02:07:24,540
for a long time,

3999
02:07:24,580 --> 02:07:26,500
if you starts to shake it off his legs,

4000
02:07:26,501 --> 02:07:26,920
he's got,

4001
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:28,570
he's going to not tell
you that he's injured.

4002
02:07:29,850 --> 02:07:30,683
Not Good.

4003
02:07:30,740 --> 02:07:31,660
You're gonna choke his legs out.

4004
02:07:32,620 --> 02:07:33,453
Anyway,

4005
02:07:39,270 --> 02:07:39,780
Tony,

4006
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:41,160
give us your thoughts on the war.

4007
02:07:41,970 --> 02:07:42,510
Uh,

4008
02:07:42,510 --> 02:07:43,530
you mean though?

4009
02:07:43,590 --> 02:07:48,060
What does the civil war to
starting tomorrow out in reality,

4010
02:07:48,061 --> 02:07:51,750
tomorrow's civil war to
the battle of America.

4011
02:07:51,930 --> 02:07:52,561
This sequel.

4012
02:07:52,561 --> 02:07:53,970
You never thought you'd see again,

4013
02:07:59,220 --> 02:08:00,053
Huh?

4014
02:08:00,180 --> 02:08:00,421
No,

4015
02:08:00,421 --> 02:08:01,380
I'm just watching this.

4016
02:08:01,381 --> 02:08:03,240
They're projecting all these states.

4017
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:04,980
Oh my God.

4018
02:08:04,980 --> 02:08:09,980
Trump 40 Pennsylvania's 48.2 to 48.22%
of the vote is in and they just did like

4019
02:08:16,291 --> 02:08:20,160
four other states and they will
project and Trump winning those what?

4020
02:08:20,161 --> 02:08:25,161
Nevada mo to Hillary's up
49.3 44.8 Hillary Clinton.

4021
02:08:29,820 --> 02:08:30,530
Okay.

4022
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:34,450
Minnesota 48.9 to 48.3 yeah.

4023
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:36,673
Hillary Clinton.

4024
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:39,591
The tensions.

4025
02:08:39,591 --> 02:08:40,424
Kellen Ya,

4026
02:08:43,130 --> 02:08:44,630
what's the total dose?

4027
02:08:44,900 --> 02:08:45,780
I'm going to just whatever.

4028
02:08:45,830 --> 02:08:48,560
That guy in the corner said
he's got the feet for Chrysler.

4029
02:08:48,561 --> 02:08:49,394
What's up?

4030
02:08:50,060 --> 02:08:50,380
Oh,

4031
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:54,050
I should be noted that yesterday my dad
pulled all of his money out of the stock

4032
02:08:54,051 --> 02:08:59,051
market and right now the stock market
has halted because it's dropped so low.

4033
02:09:00,290 --> 02:09:00,501
No,

4034
02:09:00,501 --> 02:09:02,090
it's supposed to already be closed.

4035
02:09:02,620 --> 02:09:02,950
How?

4036
02:09:02,950 --> 02:09:04,190
How was it halted,

4037
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:04,611
Bill?

4038
02:09:04,611 --> 02:09:06,320
You don't know when they're
going to listen to this.

4039
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:08,360
Asian markets.

4040
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:09,440
It's Asia markets.

4041
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:12,600
I know a lot of stuff they'll stop by.

4042
02:09:12,601 --> 02:09:14,210
Bad guys just said in the audience.

4043
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:17,300
Sunset Strip come in the same score

4044
02:09:19,550 --> 02:09:20,660
off at one day.

4045
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:25,790
Do you realize the fucking people when
when like someone gets elected or not get

4046
02:09:25,791 --> 02:09:26,181
selected,

4047
02:09:26,181 --> 02:09:27,470
the people that move that money,

4048
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:29,060
it's not guys like you or me.

4049
02:09:29,090 --> 02:09:31,850
They always go like
stockholders freaked out.

4050
02:09:31,851 --> 02:09:32,160
It's no,

4051
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:34,770
it's a fucking Bilderberg cunts that can,

4052
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:36,350
that can pull the whole thing up.

4053
02:09:36,410 --> 02:09:37,011
Oh yeah.

4054
02:09:37,011 --> 02:09:38,420
Cause I saw it on a website.

4055
02:09:40,590 --> 02:09:41,423
Okay.

4056
02:09:41,730 --> 02:09:42,200
Michigan,

4057
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:42,870
New Hampshire,

4058
02:09:42,870 --> 02:09:43,641
Pennsylvania,

4059
02:09:43,641 --> 02:09:44,361
Wisconsin.

4060
02:09:44,361 --> 02:09:48,260
Still too early to call too early to call.

4061
02:09:48,290 --> 02:09:51,170
It's not comb over til the fat lady sings.

4062
02:09:52,730 --> 02:09:54,170
You know who had the best take on that?

4063
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:55,850
I just thought of it right then.

4064
02:09:55,851 --> 02:09:56,950
Don't look at me like that bill.

4065
02:09:56,970 --> 02:09:57,610
He'll do better.

4066
02:09:57,610 --> 02:09:59,240
We need to look what you
didn't know what's going on.

4067
02:09:59,241 --> 02:09:59,601
Tony,

4068
02:09:59,601 --> 02:10:00,980
I loved you until that moment.

4069
02:10:01,010 --> 02:10:02,060
Neil degrasse Tyson,

4070
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:04,041
Arizona,

4071
02:10:04,041 --> 02:10:04,874
Utah,

4072
02:10:05,090 --> 02:10:05,900
Nevada,

4073
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:06,740
Minnesota,

4074
02:10:06,741 --> 02:10:07,730
Wisconsin.

4075
02:10:08,270 --> 02:10:10,020
Get your fucking head on [inaudible],

4076
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:11,090
Michigan.

4077
02:10:11,090 --> 02:10:12,190
Those are all mustard.

4078
02:10:12,510 --> 02:10:16,780
How drunk Pennsylvania to it and be like
nine of these things were Hampshire,

4079
02:10:16,810 --> 02:10:17,450
Michigan.

4080
02:10:17,450 --> 02:10:19,790
It was no secret we were going to
come out here and get fucked up.

4081
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:21,770
That was the mission of this.

4082
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:23,820
No secret Uber.

4083
02:10:23,960 --> 02:10:24,890
It's no reason to pry.

4084
02:10:24,891 --> 02:10:25,730
I'm fucking walk.

4085
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:26,690
I'm staying down the street.

4086
02:10:26,691 --> 02:10:27,524
I'm walking

4087
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:31,400
occasionally I'll fucking,

4088
02:10:31,580 --> 02:10:32,540
I'll roll the dice.

4089
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:34,250
You know I've been there.

4090
02:10:34,370 --> 02:10:35,121
You get in there,

4091
02:10:35,121 --> 02:10:36,740
you want a little excitement in your life.

4092
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:41,240
How about everything I ever worked
for gets pushed onto the table.

4093
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:42,433
What happens?

4094
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:43,603
Ah,

4095
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:46,210

4096
02:10:47,290 --> 02:10:49,450
I want a Taco.

4097
02:10:50,990 --> 02:10:51,830
It's like the shit.

4098
02:10:51,831 --> 02:10:53,090
Your pants of life.

4099
02:10:53,450 --> 02:10:54,670
He's just fucking rolling.

4100
02:10:55,140 --> 02:10:56,430
Be with me on this.

4101
02:11:00,060 --> 02:11:04,260
When you listen to someone just
to hear what you want them to say.

4102
02:11:05,490 --> 02:11:07,920
The podcast you did with bird.

4103
02:11:08,070 --> 02:11:08,880
Oh,

4104
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:10,380
there's the three hours.

4105
02:11:10,470 --> 02:11:10,860
Yeah,

4106
02:11:10,860 --> 02:11:14,890
and Segura and at some
point he'll Burchette.

4107
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:15,571
You know what?

4108
02:11:15,571 --> 02:11:15,961
Fuck it.

4109
02:11:15,961 --> 02:11:17,280
I'm drinking for the rest of my life.

4110
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:19,320
I need a heater.

4111
02:11:19,980 --> 02:11:23,730
But I remember old podcast where you go,

4112
02:11:23,890 --> 02:11:24,050
yeah,

4113
02:11:24,050 --> 02:11:26,280
I'm not going to drank for like 43 days.

4114
02:11:27,030 --> 02:11:28,110
Just good for your liver.

4115
02:11:28,620 --> 02:11:29,610
I'm still sober.

4116
02:11:29,611 --> 02:11:29,910
And I'm like,

4117
02:11:29,910 --> 02:11:30,240
Ooh,

4118
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:31,073
that's bad.

4119
02:11:32,490 --> 02:11:34,380
He said that on your podcast.

4120
02:11:34,640 --> 02:11:35,220
He goes,

4121
02:11:35,220 --> 02:11:35,730
fuck it.

4122
02:11:35,730 --> 02:11:36,810
I'm dragging it forever.

4123
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:38,010
I'm going to drink till I die.

4124
02:11:38,011 --> 02:11:38,490
Fuck it.

4125
02:11:38,490 --> 02:11:38,791
I go,

4126
02:11:38,791 --> 02:11:40,590
I'm never listening to bill burr again.

4127
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:42,200
Cause I heard what I want to hear.

4128
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:48,223
My,

4129
02:11:49,430 --> 02:11:51,500
I have nothing to do for
the rest of the night.

4130
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:53,960
I am walkable distance away from my bed.

4131
02:11:54,230 --> 02:11:56,510
There's no reason to be sober.

4132
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:02,510
That's why I drink on the road
the best part of the podcast,

4133
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:04,100
the very end we've done,

4134
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:05,760
we've only got a three hour podcasts,

4135
02:12:05,761 --> 02:12:06,920
totally sober and bill goes,

4136
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:10,250
I could use a heater and so girl goes,

4137
02:12:10,251 --> 02:12:10,431
what?

4138
02:12:10,431 --> 02:12:10,731
And he goes,

4139
02:12:10,731 --> 02:12:12,580
come to make the drive interesting home.

4140
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:15,710
Gotcha.

4141
02:12:15,710 --> 02:12:20,710
When I learned what a heater was and I
had a corner room in the green room last

4142
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:22,603
week and go,

4143
02:12:22,670 --> 02:12:23,451
hey the heater,

4144
02:12:23,451 --> 02:12:25,640
I thought that was a
cigar but that's a shot.

4145
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:28,100
I was a fucking complete fanboy.

4146
02:12:28,590 --> 02:12:29,870
Listened to your podcast,

4147
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:33,110
poked you a chill coot Charlie's

4148
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:36,440
put a heater.

4149
02:12:36,441 --> 02:12:37,760
Is that a thing or a thing?

4150
02:12:38,250 --> 02:12:38,990
Oh,

4151
02:12:38,990 --> 02:12:39,823
what's a heater?

4152
02:12:40,110 --> 02:12:41,540
One of my all time favorite people.

4153
02:12:42,140 --> 02:12:46,920
Tell me about that really drives me crazy.

4154
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:51,970
You somehow or another this
guy like a filter for love.

4155
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:53,110

4156
02:12:53,110 --> 02:12:54,700
he like denies it.

4157
02:12:56,870 --> 02:12:59,150
He gets his point where he just does it.

4158
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:01,540
Like it keeps him honest as a comic.

4159
02:13:02,150 --> 02:13:04,870
He wants to pretend that people don't
love and we'll people love the fuck out of

4160
02:13:04,871 --> 02:13:05,590
them.

4161
02:13:05,590 --> 02:13:07,570
Every now and then we
got to go with all dude.

4162
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:08,733

cabin you guys as friends.

4168
02:13:24,771 --> 02:13:25,970
I love the fuck out of you.

4169
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:26,900
All right,

4170
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:27,621
Dean del Ray.

4171
02:13:27,621 --> 02:13:28,820
I love the fuck out of you.

4172
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:32,180
One of my favorites to sit

4173
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:33,330
on all of this hat.

4174
02:13:35,730 --> 02:13:36,570
He's crying,

4175
02:13:36,571 --> 02:13:37,270
he's crying.

4176
02:13:37,270 --> 02:13:38,430
No one's hugging him right now.

4177
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:40,021
Super Cool.

4178
02:13:40,021 --> 02:13:40,854
I love that dude.

4179
02:13:41,090 --> 02:13:41,923
I know

4180
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,370
he's at a Donald Trump route.

4181
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:44,280
Every one of these,

4182
02:13:46,890 --> 02:13:48,100
every one of these states,

4183
02:13:48,101 --> 02:13:48,271
it's,

4184
02:13:48,271 --> 02:13:49,180
I'm telling you to do what it's say.

4185
02:13:49,530 --> 02:13:51,510
It's within like fucking 2000 votes.

4186
02:13:51,540 --> 02:13:52,180
I'm crazy.

4187
02:13:52,180 --> 02:13:55,260
I'm going to start a new show
on CBS to Michigan's mushrooms.

4188
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:58,170
1.7 4 million births,

4189
02:13:58,171 --> 02:14:00,300
1.71 9 million.

4190
02:14:00,330 --> 02:14:03,570
We're going to start with
the yoga class was constant.

4191
02:14:03,571 --> 02:14:06,090
1.2 verse 1.1

4192
02:14:06,210 --> 02:14:06,640
shoot.

4193
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:07,473
I'm going to get it wrong.

4194
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:09,250
This is fucking meditate.

4195
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:11,260
This one show one quick show.

4196
02:14:11,261 --> 02:14:11,711
Donald.

4197
02:14:11,711 --> 02:14:12,370
No big deal.

4198
02:14:12,370 --> 02:14:15,000
12 episodes round.

4199
02:14:15,001 --> 02:14:16,210
Six episodes in.

4200
02:14:16,450 --> 02:14:16,991
Hold on.

4201
02:14:16,991 --> 02:14:17,824
Hold on.

4202
02:14:18,130 --> 02:14:19,480
Doug's pulling the Burt right now.

4203
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:20,353
Joe.

4204
02:14:22,890 --> 02:14:24,340
Great chicken tenders.

4205
02:14:25,900 --> 02:14:26,733
I really,

4206
02:14:28,930 --> 02:14:29,620
oh,

4207
02:14:29,620 --> 02:14:30,340
oh.

4208
02:14:30,340 --> 02:14:32,140
Once people have some fucking vegetables.

4209
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:33,750
Oh shit

4210
02:14:37,430 --> 02:14:37,950
ways.

4211
02:14:37,950 --> 02:14:38,783
Gentlemen,

4212
02:14:41,660 --> 02:14:42,590
let's take your mind.

4213
02:14:44,620 --> 02:14:45,400
How are you?

4214
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:47,320
I'm wearing my never tap out shirt.

4215
02:14:47,860 --> 02:14:51,670
Super important with Hillary and
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and flotus on it.

4216
02:14:52,630 --> 02:14:53,051
Oh Wow.

4217
02:14:53,051 --> 02:14:55,000
Your vote counted for nothing today.

4218
02:14:55,680 --> 02:14:56,513
Oh,

4219
02:14:56,620 --> 02:14:57,453
first lady.

4220
02:14:57,700 --> 02:14:57,911
Oh,

4221
02:14:57,911 --> 02:15:00,550
first lady flotus.

4222
02:15:00,610 --> 02:15:02,560
Was I supposed to know that float?

4223
02:15:03,940 --> 02:15:06,250
That's what Trump's going to
call his haircut tomorrow.

4224
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:10,790
Give me a very interesting subject group.

4225
02:15:11,230 --> 02:15:12,063
Lotus.

4226
02:15:12,980 --> 02:15:13,390
Lotus,

4227
02:15:13,390 --> 02:15:14,050
right?

4228
02:15:14,050 --> 02:15:14,451
Yeah.

4229
02:15:14,451 --> 02:15:17,650
Do you know what flotus and did
you immediately recognize it?

4230
02:15:17,790 --> 02:15:20,020
Did you know what I'm saying?

4231
02:15:20,230 --> 02:15:20,820
Let's do that.

4232
02:15:20,820 --> 02:15:24,160
You say that still wants to
engage in romantic relationships.

4233
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:29,650
Flotus and potency.

4234
02:15:29,670 --> 02:15:30,940
This is all important.

4235
02:15:31,290 --> 02:15:31,990
Hello?

4236
02:15:31,990 --> 02:15:33,050
You recognize photos?

4237
02:15:33,130 --> 02:15:33,963
Yes.

4238
02:15:34,830 --> 02:15:35,370
Yeah,

4239
02:15:35,370 --> 02:15:35,590
I know.

4240
02:15:35,590 --> 02:15:36,730
When he comes to see,

4241
02:15:37,030 --> 02:15:37,450
oh,

4242
02:15:37,450 --> 02:15:39,550
where's the Joe Rogan's wife?

4243
02:15:39,610 --> 02:15:42,400
I paid for Rogan know if
you're the fucking wife.

4244
02:15:42,690 --> 02:15:45,790
Just that's what he's saying is it's
a weird gig to be the first lady

4245
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:48,581
until Joe,

4246
02:15:48,581 --> 02:15:49,600
but I'm going on chill.

4247
02:15:49,870 --> 02:15:53,530
That's till fucking
wife of the guy matter.

4248
02:15:53,620 --> 02:15:54,453
Exactly.

4249
02:15:55,100 --> 02:15:58,030
That's that Michelle Obama for president.

4250
02:15:58,031 --> 02:15:58,864
Fuck it.

4251
02:16:02,620 --> 02:16:06,910
Are you saying he's saying the president?

4252
02:16:07,420 --> 02:16:08,350
Oh,

4253
02:16:08,730 --> 02:16:09,101
they know.

4254
02:16:09,101 --> 02:16:10,150
Why isn't the president

4255
02:16:12,130 --> 02:16:13,950
never heard either one of their policies?

4256
02:16:13,951 --> 02:16:15,750
Just what color is their blouse?

4257
02:16:16,930 --> 02:16:20,250
Are you saying that the wife of
the president of the United States?

4258
02:16:20,251 --> 02:16:21,084
Doesn't matter.

4259
02:16:21,780 --> 02:16:23,430
I'm saying that Michelle Obama,

4260
02:16:23,431 --> 02:16:25,290
the current wife should run for president.

4261
02:16:25,291 --> 02:16:25,560
No.

4262
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:26,580
Absolutely.

4263
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:28,290
Why?

4264
02:16:28,290 --> 02:16:29,810
Because she danced Allen.

4265
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:33,033
Oh,

4266
02:16:34,830 --> 02:16:39,390
the wife of the president versus the
actually running the country is so fucking

4267
02:16:39,391 --> 02:16:41,160
different fucking break

4268
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:43,733
dude.

4269
02:16:43,740 --> 02:16:46,170
And you're out there
crushing it and arenas you.

4270
02:16:46,260 --> 02:16:48,750
Your husband should then
go do is fucking stand up.

4271
02:16:49,140 --> 02:16:51,210
Cause he hollered a notebook.

4272
02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:52,390
It's not different.

4273
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:58,400
This whole fucking thing with these
first ladies fucking low picking a damn

4274
02:16:58,401 --> 02:17:03,401
cause and all of a sudden my
presidential is fucking ridiculous.

4275
02:17:03,811 --> 02:17:05,100
It's not ridiculous.

4276
02:17:06,810 --> 02:17:11,040
Ridiculous was women have an opinion
and we talk in your ear all the time.

4277
02:17:11,050 --> 02:17:14,220
Are you telling me that when you designed
your house it was all your decision

4278
02:17:14,221 --> 02:17:15,054
has nothing.

4279
02:17:16,450 --> 02:17:19,980
It has nothing to do with signing that
you can go onto or wherever the fuck you

4280
02:17:19,981 --> 02:17:20,900
want and your wife is like

4281
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:26,550
what it has to do with is
actually doing the job,

4282
02:17:28,140 --> 02:17:28,973
doing the job.

4283
02:17:29,390 --> 02:17:30,840
There was a nurse I hung.

4284
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:33,510
I was just like him out.

4285
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:33,931
I was,

4286
02:17:33,931 --> 02:17:36,480
my mother was a nurse at home with
her from my whole fucking life.

4287
02:17:36,810 --> 02:17:37,320
Okay.

4288
02:17:37,320 --> 02:17:39,150
If someone came into the ICU unit,

4289
02:17:39,151 --> 02:17:40,260
I didn't know what the fuck to do.

4290
02:17:40,380 --> 02:17:43,470
Well that's because you are fucking
around with her with scrubs.

4291
02:17:44,580 --> 02:17:46,650
You're not trained as a nurse.

4292
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:50,040
Barack Obama is a lawyer
and so is Michelle.

4293
02:17:50,070 --> 02:17:51,150
That's not a politician,

4294
02:17:51,180 --> 02:17:54,360
but it doesn't matter like he wasn't
a politician when he got elected.

4295
02:17:54,361 --> 02:17:55,230
That was the whole thing.

4296
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:55,630
No,

4297
02:17:55,630 --> 02:17:55,900
no,

4298
02:17:55,900 --> 02:17:56,733
no.

4299
02:17:59,010 --> 02:18:02,490
You're talking about going from never
being a politician to the highest fucking

4300
02:18:02,491 --> 02:18:03,150
office ever.

4301
02:18:03,150 --> 02:18:04,950
Exactly what Trump is doing.

4302
02:18:06,010 --> 02:18:09,300
Exactly what form you fucking lunatic.

4303
02:18:11,910 --> 02:18:13,890
That is sexist shit right there.

4304
02:18:13,891 --> 02:18:17,020
I didn't say I didn't stay there.

4305
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:20,410
That is the bullshit.

4306
02:18:20,460 --> 02:18:21,293
That is

4307
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:24,413
bullshit.

4308
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:28,040
I was a white knight and I was
trying to fuck Stair Tiana.

4309
02:18:28,041 --> 02:18:29,420
I'd be yelling at you right now.

4310
02:18:29,421 --> 02:18:29,661
Bill.

4311
02:18:29,661 --> 02:18:30,494
Burn.

4312
02:18:32,290 --> 02:18:35,240
It's fucking bullshit.

4313
02:18:35,330 --> 02:18:36,650
I'll wait till you're done.

4314
02:18:36,830 --> 02:18:38,080
If you do think,

4315
02:18:38,081 --> 02:18:38,571
oh cool.

4316
02:18:38,571 --> 02:18:39,560
Who is that billionaire

4317
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:45,620
[inaudible] do you think

4318
02:18:52,160 --> 02:18:52,993
time

4319
02:18:54,390 --> 02:18:55,830
he took his shirt off.

4320
02:18:57,990 --> 02:18:59,490
We reacted to it.

4321
02:19:02,590 --> 02:19:03,730
Who's that fucking dope?

4322
02:19:04,270 --> 02:19:05,650
Who fucked up New York City?

4323
02:19:05,651 --> 02:19:06,910
Just cause he had $1 billion.

4324
02:19:06,911 --> 02:19:07,990
He was never an office.

4325
02:19:07,991 --> 02:19:08,620
Do you think that?

4326
02:19:08,620 --> 02:19:09,130
Yeah,

4327
02:19:09,130 --> 02:19:13,120
that fucking guy jerk off total fucking
shirt off and he's got his desk.

4328
02:19:13,330 --> 02:19:14,150
So there you go.

4329
02:19:14,150 --> 02:19:15,850
Mrs Bloom back.

4330
02:19:19,390 --> 02:19:21,090
Well it doesn't,

4331
02:19:21,550 --> 02:19:21,701
no,

4332
02:19:21,701 --> 02:19:22,690
I'm saying that guy,

4333
02:19:22,990 --> 02:19:27,890
that guy was a jerk off and he actually
transcended the state constitution and

4334
02:19:27,891 --> 02:19:28,221
was like,

4335
02:19:28,221 --> 02:19:28,641
fuck it.

4336
02:19:28,641 --> 02:19:28,911
I'm not.

4337
02:19:28,911 --> 02:19:31,790
Then being in the fucking
guy here and continued on.

4338
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:32,810
That was bullshit.

4339
02:19:33,050 --> 02:19:33,883
And this is the thing.

4340
02:19:33,950 --> 02:19:37,910
If you fucking do the thing about all of
this shit is if you criticize Hillary,

4341
02:19:37,911 --> 02:19:39,380
it means automatically you're a sexist.

4342
02:19:39,410 --> 02:19:40,520
I didn't say that.

4343
02:19:40,521 --> 02:19:43,790
I just said that the first
lady voted for Trump.

4344
02:19:45,070 --> 02:19:46,400
If Hillary was really

4345
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:50,030
no words in my mouth,

4346
02:19:50,031 --> 02:19:51,200
that's not what I said.

4347
02:19:51,480 --> 02:19:53,270
I'm putting what you said.

4348
02:19:53,480 --> 02:19:58,130
You said that someone with no experience
can't take on the highest office of the

4349
02:19:58,131 --> 02:19:58,520
world.

4350
02:19:58,520 --> 02:19:59,480
And I said,

4351
02:19:59,750 --> 02:20:01,670
but Trump just did that.

4352
02:20:01,910 --> 02:20:03,140
That's all I said.

4353
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:07,820
Trump has had no experience and he's
going to take over in the orbit.

4354
02:20:07,821 --> 02:20:09,530
That's all I was the point I was making.

4355
02:20:09,531 --> 02:20:10,364
I was not saying,

4356
02:20:11,300 --> 02:20:12,920
I don't understand what your point is.

4357
02:20:13,990 --> 02:20:18,680
Why is Hillary is no different
than a reality TV show stars,

4358
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:19,211
ladies.

4359
02:20:19,211 --> 02:20:20,100
That's like what your point.

4360
02:20:20,110 --> 02:20:22,150
You said the first lady right now,

4361
02:20:22,310 --> 02:20:25,940
Michelle Obama could never be president
because you can't go from a no

4362
02:20:25,941 --> 02:20:28,540
experience to running the
biggest office in the world.

4363
02:20:28,550 --> 02:20:31,910
I said I disagree because
that's why 100% never said that.

4364
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:32,241
I,

4365
02:20:32,241 --> 02:20:35,720
that's what I thought
you said June 1st I mean

4366
02:20:39,750 --> 02:20:40,640
once you inferred.

4367
02:20:41,570 --> 02:20:42,410
I don't think so.

4368
02:20:42,411 --> 02:20:43,244
I'm,

4369
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:44,630
I'm almost positive.

4370
02:20:44,631 --> 02:20:48,110
I just reacted to what you
said so we can rewind it,

4371
02:20:48,111 --> 02:20:48,771
but if you did it,

4372
02:20:48,771 --> 02:20:49,950
you did it.

4373
02:20:52,840 --> 02:20:54,980
So you have a Twitter handle.

4374
02:20:54,981 --> 02:20:55,670
Hold on,

4375
02:20:55,670 --> 02:20:56,503
hold on.

4376
02:20:56,720 --> 02:20:58,790
We got voted and like
she would have to run.

4377
02:21:00,410 --> 02:21:01,790
I never said any of that.

4378
02:21:01,850 --> 02:21:05,040
All I said was the first
lady has experienced

4379
02:21:05,310 --> 02:21:05,590
fence.

4380
02:21:05,590 --> 02:21:06,423
Oh good.

4381
02:21:09,220 --> 02:21:12,730
How long were you said was
you guys to be in dispute?

4382
02:21:12,731 --> 02:21:13,410
You're both.

4383
02:21:13,410 --> 02:21:13,771
We're not.

4384
02:21:13,771 --> 02:21:16,070
We're just disagreeing guys.

4385
02:21:16,270 --> 02:21:17,940
The point that I'm making,

4386
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:21,930
if you're married to someone
not in the field that you're in,

4387
02:21:22,230 --> 02:21:24,660
does not make you
qualified to do that job.

4388
02:21:24,750 --> 02:21:25,650
That's all I just said.

4389
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:28,420
If you're married to a,

4390
02:21:28,980 --> 02:21:31,890
to a guy who built houses
and you don't build houses,

4391
02:21:32,190 --> 02:21:35,490
that doesn't mean that I want to live in
something that you just fucking built.

4392
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:36,271
That's all I'm saying.

4393
02:21:36,271 --> 02:21:36,450
You know,

4394
02:21:36,450 --> 02:21:38,100
you make some good points there.

4395
02:21:38,620 --> 02:21:38,890
Yeah.

4396
02:21:38,890 --> 02:21:39,180
Kind of.

4397
02:21:39,180 --> 02:21:40,013
You'd like to say,

4398
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:40,321
oh,

4399
02:21:40,321 --> 02:21:40,580
Whoa,

4400
02:21:40,580 --> 02:21:41,413
Whoa,

4401
02:21:42,300 --> 02:21:42,691
Sarah.

4402
02:21:42,691 --> 02:21:44,040
Tiana would also like to speak.

4403
02:21:44,660 --> 02:21:44,781
Well,

4404
02:21:44,781 --> 02:21:45,980
I'm just saying that like,

4405
02:21:46,010 --> 02:21:51,010
of course you're saying that if she is
Jesse because you're married to somebody

4406
02:21:51,860 --> 02:21:52,880
with a job.

4407
02:21:57,230 --> 02:21:57,710
I feel,

4408
02:21:57,710 --> 02:21:58,570
I feel like,

4409
02:22:00,840 --> 02:22:02,090
I feel like I'm listening to somebody.

4410
02:22:02,091 --> 02:22:05,360
Talk about where the Cleveland Indians
were the best team in baseball last year.

4411
02:22:06,030 --> 02:22:07,130
I mean it's already pretty much,

4412
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:07,830
no,

4413
02:22:07,830 --> 02:22:08,070
no.

4414
02:22:08,070 --> 02:22:12,090
This is where Bob Backlund was better
than red is super fly snuck up.

4415
02:22:12,310 --> 02:22:12,800
Wow.

4416
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:12,970
No,

4417
02:22:12,970 --> 02:22:14,920
this is where I paid regular friends.

4418
02:22:16,210 --> 02:22:17,800
Everybody knows is Bob Backlund cliff.

4419
02:22:17,900 --> 02:22:22,500
It's a not two teams is
not team ps and team.

4420
02:22:22,501 --> 02:22:24,960
Vagina and he can't stay you jail.

4421
02:22:25,090 --> 02:22:25,923
Okay.

4422
02:22:25,950 --> 02:22:26,783
Yeah.

4423
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:34,800
I was trying to transcend this fucking
horse shit of what is your genitalia?

4424
02:22:34,860 --> 02:22:36,360
This is therefore what you think.

4425
02:22:36,480 --> 02:22:37,840
That's all I was trying to try and set.

4426
02:22:37,860 --> 02:22:38,060
Okay.

4427
02:22:38,060 --> 02:22:40,970
Brought up a good point that we do.

4428
02:22:40,971 --> 02:22:42,890
If you don't know how to do the job,

4429
02:22:44,030 --> 02:22:45,590
why do we have democracy?

4430
02:22:46,070 --> 02:22:47,000
Why are we voting?

4431
02:22:47,390 --> 02:22:49,670
We're fucking all dumb on this panel.

4432
02:22:51,270 --> 02:22:52,103
No,

4433
02:22:53,250 --> 02:22:54,590
the paid to be here,

4434
02:22:56,180 --> 02:22:57,500
so not true.

4435
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,560
Wait fucking smarter than me.

4436
02:23:02,561 --> 02:23:03,610
Looking at me right now.

4437
02:23:03,620 --> 02:23:04,750
Going all right.

4438
02:23:07,480 --> 02:23:07,950
I,

4439
02:23:07,950 --> 02:23:08,350
for one,

4440
02:23:08,350 --> 02:23:10,670
when I say we're totally qualified
to be talking about this,

4441
02:23:12,740 --> 02:23:13,670
I think we're good.

4442
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,520
I don't know why anyone
would question the opinions.

4443
02:23:17,220 --> 02:23:18,610
This real quick,

4444
02:23:18,820 --> 02:23:19,480
Doug,

4445
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:21,190
you're a victim of your own scouts.

4446
02:23:21,191 --> 02:23:21,730
Hey,

4447
02:23:21,730 --> 02:23:22,451
you're beautiful.

4448
02:23:22,451 --> 02:23:25,360
You are my favorite people that's
ever walked the face of the planet.

4449
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:27,030
You're up there with king is Tom Neighbor,

4450
02:23:27,031 --> 02:23:27,801
Abraham Lincoln's,

4451
02:23:27,801 --> 02:23:29,020
so settle the fuck down.

4452
02:23:30,630 --> 02:23:31,810
Are you calling me a mud?

4453
02:23:31,811 --> 02:23:32,644
Race

4454
02:23:35,420 --> 02:23:36,253
trains

4455
02:23:39,410 --> 02:23:40,910
the fucking step people.

4456
02:23:40,940 --> 02:23:43,340
People lives in this depth
and lived in felt tense.

4457
02:23:43,610 --> 02:23:47,750
My point was that democracy is
flawed in that idiots can vote.

4458
02:23:48,220 --> 02:23:51,320
We're saying they can run to what they do.

4459
02:23:51,350 --> 02:23:52,400
They know what they do,

4460
02:23:52,550 --> 02:23:53,570
but we vote for that.

4461
02:23:53,571 --> 02:23:53,930
Right.

4462
02:23:53,930 --> 02:23:54,860
Honest question.

4463
02:23:55,130 --> 02:23:56,030
What's the solution?

4464
02:23:56,060 --> 02:23:56,211
Well,

4465
02:23:56,211 --> 02:23:57,980
that's dumb before I called you dumb,

4466
02:23:59,210 --> 02:23:59,780
dumb.

4467
02:23:59,780 --> 02:24:00,350
Really?

4468
02:24:00,350 --> 02:24:02,470
There's no way I barely
can keep putting that.

4469
02:24:02,480 --> 02:24:04,310
Paying attention to
what the fuck I'm doing.

4470
02:24:04,490 --> 02:24:05,340
I don't know what you do.

4471
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:07,640
You know what I think the solution is?

4472
02:24:07,670 --> 02:24:12,110
We just have to wait for idiots to die
and we have to hope that like smarter

4473
02:24:12,111 --> 02:24:13,370
people keep getting born.

4474
02:24:14,250 --> 02:24:15,700
That's true.

4475
02:24:15,740 --> 02:24:18,500
That's why the Duggar's
need to be executed.

4476
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:21,140
We're not going anywhere else there.

4477
02:24:21,141 --> 02:24:22,490
I just had two daughters.

4478
02:24:24,150 --> 02:24:25,880
You're part of the problem.

4479
02:24:26,470 --> 02:24:26,991
It's narrow.

4480
02:24:26,991 --> 02:24:27,820
Tiana

4481
02:24:27,820 --> 02:24:29,350
necessarily disagree with you,

4482
02:24:29,351 --> 02:24:32,350
but I think even those people that
just a victim of circumstance.

4483
02:24:32,410 --> 02:24:32,680
Shit.

4484
02:24:32,680 --> 02:24:33,970
Hillary won Nevada.

4485
02:24:40,090 --> 02:24:41,380
What were the odds on that?

4486
02:24:41,381 --> 02:24:45,190
Two 38 to 15 going into
the fourth quarter.

4487
02:24:47,260 --> 02:24:49,660
Hillary's so excited
with it had passed out.

4488
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:53,000
Trump has [inaudible] ma'am.

4489
02:24:53,610 --> 02:24:54,443
Yeah.

4490
02:24:54,960 --> 02:24:56,710
There's no waiting for Pennsylvania.

4491
02:24:57,610 --> 02:24:59,020
They have a called Wisconsin yet,

4492
02:24:59,021 --> 02:24:59,854
right?

4493
02:25:00,340 --> 02:25:01,540
They haven't called Wisconsin.

4494
02:25:01,541 --> 02:25:01,720
They have,

4495
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:02,660
but it's not looking at that.

4496
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:03,760
We call Pennsylvania.

4497
02:25:04,360 --> 02:25:06,190
Here's what she asked again.

4498
02:25:06,430 --> 02:25:07,660
What are their options?

4499
02:25:07,661 --> 02:25:08,441
Is it easy?

4500
02:25:08,441 --> 02:25:09,540
She has to get Wisconsin.

4501
02:25:10,540 --> 02:25:13,420
If she gets like the
mustard colored sticks.

4502
02:25:13,480 --> 02:25:14,860
You know what's really scary,

4503
02:25:16,090 --> 02:25:16,923
Michigan?

4504
02:25:17,230 --> 02:25:18,310
I don't know what's going on,

4505
02:25:18,311 --> 02:25:18,491
dude.

4506
02:25:18,491 --> 02:25:20,290
I didn't know I was going to
be in front of the computer.

4507
02:25:20,291 --> 02:25:20,451
No,

4508
02:25:20,451 --> 02:25:20,610
no.

4509
02:25:20,610 --> 02:25:23,800
We already know that we are
a little children got older.

4510
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:24,370
Yeah.

4511
02:25:24,370 --> 02:25:24,940
Yeah.

4512
02:25:24,940 --> 02:25:27,040
And this is what this
fucking system is based on.

4513
02:25:27,041 --> 02:25:29,620
Little children that got older
back when they used to ride horses.

4514
02:25:30,310 --> 02:25:31,400
That's so Meta.

4515
02:25:31,610 --> 02:25:33,310
It's real head Israel.

4516
02:25:33,330 --> 02:25:33,571
No,

4517
02:25:33,571 --> 02:25:34,261
I love it.

4518
02:25:34,261 --> 02:25:35,130
You're so right.

4519
02:25:35,160 --> 02:25:36,270
I never rode a horse

4520
02:25:36,630 --> 02:25:37,620
to this whole fucking thing.

4521
02:25:37,621 --> 02:25:39,690
Like there's a long history
of the United States.

4522
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:41,790
People lived to be a hundred years.

4523
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:45,780
The United States was founded
in 1776 that's three people ago.

4524
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:48,720
Okay.

4525
02:25:48,720 --> 02:25:48,990
Three.

4526
02:25:48,990 --> 02:25:52,200
Pete started this fucking
thing that's kind of trippy.

4527
02:25:52,440 --> 02:25:52,951
Joe Rogan,

4528
02:25:52,951 --> 02:25:53,910
I have breaking news.

4529
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:57,360
Ladies and gentlemen from
my home state of Florida,

4530
02:25:57,361 --> 02:25:58,440
amendment number two,

4531
02:25:58,710 --> 02:26:00,210
medical marijuana has passed.

4532
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:01,400
Oh,

4533
02:26:04,190 --> 02:26:06,490
and ladies and gentlemen of Joe Rogan,

4534
02:26:09,940 --> 02:26:13,120
Joe Rogan is also passed in
the state of Massachusetts.

4535
02:26:20,050 --> 02:26:22,590
The problem with that is if
people get high in Massachusetts,

4536
02:26:22,591 --> 02:26:23,101
they realize,

4537
02:26:23,101 --> 02:26:23,431
listen,

4538
02:26:23,431 --> 02:26:24,840
there's a place I can go in January.

4539
02:26:24,841 --> 02:26:26,430
What's it's not nearly as fucking cool.

4540
02:26:28,910 --> 02:26:29,121
Wait,

4541
02:26:29,121 --> 02:26:30,170
we have more breaking news.

4542
02:26:30,171 --> 02:26:33,650
Hillary just announce the start
of her new reality show tomorrow.

4543
02:26:34,220 --> 02:26:36,140
Starts Taping tomorrow immediately.

4544
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:37,131
What's the name of it?

4545
02:26:37,131 --> 02:26:37,964
Tony,

4546
02:26:40,820 --> 02:26:42,400
you quick mother fucker now

4547
02:26:45,740 --> 02:26:47,840
Tony Secretary of steaks.

4548
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:51,673
Yeah.

4549
02:26:53,980 --> 02:26:57,220
Wait and also the secret service
just tweeted for the first time ever.

4550
02:26:57,221 --> 02:26:58,054
They just said

4551
02:26:59,890 --> 02:27:00,700
that's it.

4552
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:01,870
That's all they said.

4553
02:27:04,630 --> 02:27:05,530
They just said laws.

4554
02:27:05,531 --> 02:27:06,490
They're in for a party.

4555
02:27:06,491 --> 02:27:07,330
Those guys,

4556
02:27:09,530 --> 02:27:11,110
it looks like the secret's out.

4557
02:27:11,990 --> 02:27:13,420
Somebody is tweeting.

4558
02:27:15,030 --> 02:27:17,500
Trumps going to be taking pictures
of the guys like in the hallway.

4559
02:27:17,501 --> 02:27:18,430
This guy's a creep.

4560
02:27:20,680 --> 02:27:21,850
We're showing ideas.

4561
02:27:22,310 --> 02:27:22,940
Yup.

4562
02:27:22,940 --> 02:27:25,550
Joey Diaz is a man of many mysteries.

4563
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:26,833
You never know.

4564
02:27:27,370 --> 02:27:27,890
Josie Diaz.

4565
02:27:27,890 --> 02:27:28,341
We'll be here.

4566
02:27:28,341 --> 02:27:30,020
We're going to 11 motherfuckers.

4567
02:27:30,021 --> 02:27:31,400
It's only nine 30 right now.

4568
02:27:31,540 --> 02:27:32,373
Ooh,

4569
02:27:32,740 --> 02:27:35,440
I thought he was there cause
I saw him on periscope.

4570
02:27:36,100 --> 02:27:39,010
You guys know that the only reason why
you had to pay monies because Doug,

4571
02:27:39,090 --> 02:27:40,750
Stan hope this motherfucker.

4572
02:27:41,410 --> 02:27:43,720
I was like what to do with the money.

4573
02:27:44,680 --> 02:27:46,180
We've talked about this earlier,

4574
02:27:47,030 --> 02:27:48,060
talked about this.

4575
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:49,313
Yes.

4576
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:52,473
Ladies and Gentlemen,

4577
02:27:52,640 --> 02:27:53,970
Ladies and gentlemen,

4578
02:27:55,420 --> 02:27:56,031
Morgan Murphy,

4579
02:27:56,031 --> 02:27:56,960
perhaps you should be.

4580
02:27:56,961 --> 02:27:58,610
It could be as the main site.

4581
02:27:58,820 --> 02:28:01,280
We're thinking about
a charitable donation.

4582
02:28:01,850 --> 02:28:02,730
All the money that we're,

4583
02:28:02,760 --> 02:28:03,500
we're,

4584
02:28:03,500 --> 02:28:04,810
we're not taking money from it.

4585
02:28:06,530 --> 02:28:06,861
Okay,

4586
02:28:06,861 --> 02:28:07,694
good.

4587
02:28:07,730 --> 02:28:09,400
Hope I or all the guests

4588
02:28:11,630 --> 02:28:12,530
you would be with me.

4589
02:28:12,531 --> 02:28:16,870
We're not going to give this to a fucking
charity that's going to get 90% to pay

4590
02:28:16,871 --> 02:28:18,450
a z o and make dijour.

4591
02:28:18,470 --> 02:28:19,221
It's absolutely,

4592
02:28:19,221 --> 02:28:22,190
absolutely we have to figure
out to do with the money

4593
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:23,023
and we'll go with that.

4594
02:28:23,210 --> 02:28:24,560
But we're not taking a dime.

4595
02:28:24,770 --> 02:28:24,981
No.

4596
02:28:24,981 --> 02:28:26,180
We'll find something weird again.

4597
02:28:26,190 --> 02:28:26,580
A Kona.

4598
02:28:26,580 --> 02:28:27,610
Keep it here.

4599
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:29,150
We give it to the surplus card.

4600
02:28:32,930 --> 02:28:33,920
Oh my God.

4601
02:28:34,100 --> 02:28:37,700
Why don't you just sponsor people
who want to move from this country?

4602
02:28:38,150 --> 02:28:40,920
Why don't you sponsor people's
trips out of the advocate?

4603
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:42,620
That's the smartest move.

4604
02:28:43,510 --> 02:28:44,480
Cause honestly,

4605
02:28:44,481 --> 02:28:44,960
when it,

4606
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:47,330
the hardest thing is finding
someone to help you move.

4607
02:28:47,740 --> 02:28:48,850
We found one bit,

4608
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:49,400
I'm sorry.

4609
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:49,580
No,

4610
02:28:49,580 --> 02:28:49,980
it's fine.

4611
02:28:49,980 --> 02:28:50,813
Yeah.

4612
02:28:51,490 --> 02:28:52,640
There's a microphone there,

4613
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:53,260
so,

4614
02:28:53,260 --> 02:28:54,710
and you'll get selected.

4615
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:56,030
Yeah.

4616
02:28:56,030 --> 02:28:56,590
Okay.

4617
02:28:56,590 --> 02:28:57,141
We're going to pay.

4618
02:28:57,141 --> 02:28:57,500
Yeah.

4619
02:28:57,500 --> 02:28:58,550
Pay for them to leave.

4620
02:28:59,640 --> 02:28:59,960
Yeah,

4621
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:00,600
I like that.

4622
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:01,433
Yeah.

4623
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:02,720
It's a really good concept.

4624
02:29:02,721 --> 02:29:03,020
Yeah.

4625
02:29:03,020 --> 02:29:03,853
There you go.

4626
02:29:04,360 --> 02:29:05,193
Right.

4627
02:29:06,100 --> 02:29:07,350
His money.

4628
02:29:07,351 --> 02:29:08,041
Where his mouth,

4629
02:29:08,041 --> 02:29:08,640
I dunno.

4630
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:09,301
Sarah Tiana.

4631
02:29:09,301 --> 02:29:10,650
Do you lean right or lean left?

4632
02:29:10,670 --> 02:29:11,940
Do you seem like a chick with a gun?

4633
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:12,721
Uh,

4634
02:29:12,721 --> 02:29:12,991
no.

4635
02:29:12,991 --> 02:29:13,201
No.

4636
02:29:13,201 --> 02:29:14,700
I'm terrified of guns.

4637
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:16,171
I am.

4638
02:29:16,171 --> 02:29:16,920
Yeah.

4639
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:17,161
Yeah,

4640
02:29:17,161 --> 02:29:17,580
yeah.

4641
02:29:17,580 --> 02:29:18,301
I don't understand.

4642
02:29:18,301 --> 02:29:20,520
Like my brother in law has a
bunch of them and I'm always like,

4643
02:29:20,521 --> 02:29:21,181
why do you need them?

4644
02:29:21,181 --> 02:29:21,421
He's like,

4645
02:29:21,421 --> 02:29:22,500
I'll go to protect this house.

4646
02:29:22,501 --> 02:29:22,771
I'm like,

4647
02:29:22,771 --> 02:29:24,330
but nobody wants her DVD player.

4648
02:29:24,390 --> 02:29:24,901
You know what I mean?

4649
02:29:24,901 --> 02:29:25,051
Like,

4650
02:29:25,051 --> 02:29:25,884
I don't know.

4651
02:29:26,070 --> 02:29:26,940
I don't understand,

4652
02:29:28,140 --> 02:29:29,340
but I also don't understand,

4653
02:29:29,341 --> 02:29:32,700
like I don't mind the shotgun because my
dad had a shotgun when we growing up we

4654
02:29:32,701 --> 02:29:33,271
ate the food.

4655
02:29:33,271 --> 02:29:34,320
He killed that one time,

4656
02:29:34,350 --> 02:29:34,651
you know?

4657
02:29:34,651 --> 02:29:35,850
So it was fun.

4658
02:29:36,750 --> 02:29:38,670
But I don't like semiautomatic weapons.

4659
02:29:38,671 --> 02:29:39,600
I think they're weird.

4660
02:29:41,010 --> 02:29:43,210
There should be limitations
on how symptoms.

4661
02:29:44,550 --> 02:29:44,761
Yeah,

4662
02:29:44,761 --> 02:29:45,594
because I feel like,

4663
02:29:46,350 --> 02:29:49,740
don't you feel like the same person that
buzzes semiautomatic weapon is the same

4664
02:29:49,741 --> 02:29:51,660
person that buys a Ferrari jacket?

4665
02:29:54,470 --> 02:29:55,240
It's a fair,

4666
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:56,001
it's a fair question.

4667
02:29:56,001 --> 02:29:56,570
Like you're like,

4668
02:29:56,570 --> 02:29:57,291
I don't know.

4669
02:29:57,291 --> 02:29:59,350
That seems excessive in early man.

4670
02:29:59,490 --> 02:30:01,400
When I was listening to
that on Netflix and I go,

4671
02:30:04,220 --> 02:30:05,053

4675
02:30:09,770 --> 02:30:11,540
the answer is.

4676
02:30:11,710 --> 02:30:13,480
Who were for Ryan racing shoes.

4677
02:30:14,890 --> 02:30:15,450
Shoes,

4678
02:30:15,450 --> 02:30:16,230
wrestling shoes.

4679
02:30:16,230 --> 02:30:18,400
Everybody has smoke with the coffee bean.

4680
02:30:18,401 --> 02:30:22,290
They're all over drivers and they all
have Ferrari shoes and I fucking love it.

4681
02:30:22,830 --> 02:30:23,670
I love it.

4682
02:30:23,730 --> 02:30:25,440
What kind of cigarettes do they smoke?

4683
02:30:25,441 --> 02:30:25,861
I'm always,

4684
02:30:25,861 --> 02:30:26,890
I don't know what they smell.

4685
02:30:26,891 --> 02:30:27,990
It's like a brand that you're like,

4686
02:30:27,991 --> 02:30:29,320
where did you buy that brochure?

4687
02:30:29,370 --> 02:30:30,203
A tree

4688
02:30:30,510 --> 02:30:30,991
bill burr.

4689
02:30:30,991 --> 02:30:31,681
Fun Fact.

4690
02:30:31,681 --> 02:30:33,980
Morgan Murphy fucking
fantastic boxing fan.

4691
02:30:35,190 --> 02:30:36,023
Yeah.

4692
02:30:36,280 --> 02:30:37,980
She always has to fight nights over.

4693
02:30:38,370 --> 02:30:42,490
I'm like five years deep into
Golovkin and people are now getting,

4694
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:43,110
I'm sorry,

4695
02:30:43,110 --> 02:30:43,361
you know,

4696
02:30:43,361 --> 02:30:43,870
it's fine.

4697
02:30:43,870 --> 02:30:44,471
But I like,

4698
02:30:44,471 --> 02:30:44,621
I,

4699
02:30:44,621 --> 02:30:45,820
that's what I feel like now.

4700
02:30:45,821 --> 02:30:47,950
I feel like I was like
nine years deep into,

4701
02:30:47,951 --> 02:30:49,900
into a pack out and like,

4702
02:30:49,901 --> 02:30:50,960
then he got bit like it's,

4703
02:30:51,430 --> 02:30:51,761
I don't know,

4704
02:30:51,761 --> 02:30:53,950
I just find out about things
sooner than other people.

4705
02:30:53,951 --> 02:30:54,730
It makes me better.

4706
02:30:54,730 --> 02:30:55,563
Well you know about

4707
02:30:57,790 --> 02:30:59,710
what you know about old shit too,

4708
02:30:59,711 --> 02:31:01,870
you know a little bit like you know,

4709
02:31:01,990 --> 02:31:03,970
I dunno like basic shit.

4710
02:31:05,080 --> 02:31:05,913
Full House.

4711
02:31:05,950 --> 02:31:07,870
You and I had a
conversation about the ram.

4712
02:31:08,290 --> 02:31:09,040
Yeah.

4713
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:09,341
Yeah.

4714
02:31:09,341 --> 02:31:11,560
We had a long Durang conversation.

4715
02:31:13,330 --> 02:31:14,560
I used to fly out.

4716
02:31:14,620 --> 02:31:15,070
I would,

4717
02:31:15,070 --> 02:31:18,670
I would do overnight from work
and I would fly out to see glove.

4718
02:31:18,700 --> 02:31:23,570
I saw Golovkin fight like a Fox
sports for like 2:00 AM fight.

4719
02:31:23,570 --> 02:31:24,091
And I was like,

4720
02:31:24,091 --> 02:31:24,901
who's this guy?

4721
02:31:24,901 --> 02:31:27,810
And I went to every American fight
he had until he was like famous.

4722
02:31:27,811 --> 02:31:29,040
Now I can't afford to go anymore,

4723
02:31:29,041 --> 02:31:30,380
but I would fly out overnight.

4724
02:31:30,570 --> 02:31:34,220
I bumped into La Wanda Sykes on a plane
and we were both like lesbians going to,

4725
02:31:34,230 --> 02:31:34,560
uh,

4726
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:35,251
I'm not lesbian,

4727
02:31:35,251 --> 02:31:39,090
but I it seem like I am based on
every pay based on everything.

4728
02:31:39,091 --> 02:31:42,420
I like saying do I seem
like I'm a lesbian but it's,

4729
02:31:42,490 --> 02:31:42,931
it's a for,

4730
02:31:42,931 --> 02:31:43,860
everybody thinks that too.

4731
02:31:43,861 --> 02:31:45,680
Cause we look good and
blazers and they're like,

4732
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:46,890
oh sorry.

4733
02:31:46,950 --> 02:31:47,520
Yeah,

4734
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:49,330
I'm sorry I have a house.

4735
02:31:50,690 --> 02:31:51,110
Sing it.

4736
02:31:51,110 --> 02:31:54,740
I'll be there in a way because
you're like serious fucking assholes.

4737
02:31:54,750 --> 02:31:54,861
It.

4738
02:31:54,861 --> 02:31:56,980
You keep saying all these
states are too close to call,

4739
02:31:56,981 --> 02:31:57,814
so I call them.

4740
02:31:59,500 --> 02:32:04,500
They're spent two 38 50 it's
like a fucking hour isn't it?

4741
02:32:04,911 --> 02:32:07,130
It's too late to call
them like Pennsylvania.

4742
02:32:07,131 --> 02:32:07,660
I don't understand.

4743
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:08,570
It's too late to call.

4744
02:32:08,571 --> 02:32:09,440
You sound like my mom.

4745
02:32:10,450 --> 02:32:10,940
It's like,

4746
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:11,690
it's like fun.

4747
02:32:11,690 --> 02:32:12,650
No one in the morning,

4748
02:32:15,250 --> 02:32:16,100
one of the junkies.

4749
02:32:16,101 --> 02:32:19,760
What do you think Hillary and
and Trump are doing right now?

4750
02:32:20,340 --> 02:32:21,173
What?

4751
02:32:21,350 --> 02:32:23,630
What do you think Hillary and
Trump are doing right now?

4752
02:32:24,050 --> 02:32:24,883
Each Other?

4753
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:26,090
No.

4754
02:32:26,090 --> 02:32:29,440
[inaudible] 69 that's
the only way triplets.

4755
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:30,790
Somebody suck his dick that way.

4756
02:32:30,791 --> 02:32:31,810
They don't look at his head.

4757
02:32:34,330 --> 02:32:35,320
I don't think Trump is,

4758
02:32:37,350 --> 02:32:39,300
Trump is in like jerking off to celebrate.

4759
02:32:39,301 --> 02:32:42,810
He's jerking off to relax cause he's
completely freaked out right now that any

4760
02:32:42,811 --> 02:32:43,740
of this is happening.

4761
02:32:43,741 --> 02:32:44,730
I don't think he,

4762
02:32:44,820 --> 02:32:45,653
I don't think he,

4763
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:47,190
I don't know if he wanted it.

4764
02:32:47,191 --> 02:32:47,970
I don't know if he's,

4765
02:32:47,970 --> 02:32:49,750
that's what you say.

4766
02:32:50,050 --> 02:32:54,010
All of a sudden you're living in Brentwood
and you're back walls made out of

4767
02:32:54,011 --> 02:32:59,011
glass and you drive a Ferrari and the
guy at the fucking local coffee bean gets

4768
02:33:01,001 --> 02:33:01,900
a coke today.

4769
02:33:02,050 --> 02:33:03,040
My trainers,

4770
02:33:04,050 --> 02:33:04,883
no,

4771
02:33:04,930 --> 02:33:07,090
you're a producer.

4772
02:33:08,110 --> 02:33:10,920
Producer works on movies
and ain't going nowhere.

4773
02:33:10,930 --> 02:33:14,980
So you constantly deal with desperate
people and you're giving them coke and

4774
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:16,340
driving around in a Ferrari.

4775
02:33:16,350 --> 02:33:17,350
So your fucking house,

4776
02:33:17,351 --> 02:33:18,640
the glass windows.

4777
02:33:18,641 --> 02:33:20,500
Just because I think positively.

4778
02:33:20,501 --> 02:33:21,760
It doesn't make me sell out.

4779
02:33:22,060 --> 02:33:22,750
Yes.

4780
02:33:22,750 --> 02:33:23,340
What happens?

4781
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:25,890
I said just because I think
positively it does make me a sell out.

4782
02:33:25,891 --> 02:33:28,380
I thought I thought he
liked was fucking around.

4783
02:33:29,470 --> 02:33:29,771
Yeah,

4784
02:33:29,771 --> 02:33:30,041
right.

4785
02:33:30,041 --> 02:33:31,740
You didn't think he was fucking
around in the beginning.

4786
02:33:32,440 --> 02:33:34,630
Trump like just throwing his name.

4787
02:33:35,020 --> 02:33:36,340
Real conversation.

4788
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:42,100
We have to affect the guy
doesn't really have a plan.

4789
02:33:42,580 --> 02:33:44,170
He's having to make this fucking great.

4790
02:33:44,171 --> 02:33:45,040
Why are you gonna do that?

4791
02:33:45,041 --> 02:33:45,250
Oh,

4792
02:33:45,250 --> 02:33:46,083
you'll see.

4793
02:33:47,060 --> 02:33:50,710
It doesn't really sound like
a plan after giving an answer.

4794
02:33:51,190 --> 02:33:51,751
It's time out.

4795
02:33:51,751 --> 02:33:52,990
We just kept riding it.

4796
02:33:54,370 --> 02:33:55,630
It's fucking astounding.

4797
02:33:55,631 --> 02:33:57,650
It's the most amazing thing
I've ever fucking seen.

4798
02:33:57,820 --> 02:33:58,420
We're here.

4799
02:33:58,420 --> 02:33:59,380
We're here losing.

4800
02:33:59,390 --> 02:34:00,223
Yeah.

4801
02:34:01,020 --> 02:34:03,670
T and I still blame him
for ruining my life.

4802
02:34:03,880 --> 02:34:04,830
You were good.

4803
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:06,220
You did a good job.

4804
02:34:07,090 --> 02:34:08,380
You did a good job.

4805
02:34:08,381 --> 02:34:09,570
So you know what?

4806
02:34:09,640 --> 02:34:10,910
Do we have a precedent?

4807
02:34:11,560 --> 02:34:12,940
You did guys.

4808
02:34:12,941 --> 02:34:16,720
Guys calm down here after the
who did what announcement.

4809
02:34:16,721 --> 02:34:19,570
I got know who's on what
before I keep talking.

4810
02:34:19,660 --> 02:34:20,500
I don't even remember.

4811
02:34:20,501 --> 02:34:21,910
Brendon was leaving

4812
02:34:23,550 --> 02:34:25,260
God damn magician to me.

4813
02:34:25,261 --> 02:34:25,571
I'm like,

4814
02:34:25,571 --> 02:34:28,180
where's better less went to him.

4815
02:34:28,960 --> 02:34:30,420
I went to him to

4816
02:34:35,980 --> 02:34:36,870
fucking IPAD,

4817
02:34:36,890 --> 02:34:38,080
put it down on a table.

4818
02:34:38,910 --> 02:34:40,060
The fucking scream.

4819
02:34:42,550 --> 02:34:45,340
They got a black guy or
white guy with white hair.

4820
02:34:45,341 --> 02:34:46,510
Jesus Christ.

4821
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:48,960
Diversity in the house.

4822
02:34:48,980 --> 02:34:49,850
Good resident.

4823
02:34:49,860 --> 02:34:52,650
His hair's gonna change presidents.

4824
02:34:52,690 --> 02:34:53,620
Harris Change.

4825
02:34:54,210 --> 02:34:55,043
He'll take you.

4826
02:34:56,210 --> 02:34:57,520
The emails had to do with this.

4827
02:34:57,550 --> 02:34:58,810
How much you think the emails

4828
02:34:58,950 --> 02:35:00,840
I have affected this election.

4829
02:35:00,930 --> 02:35:01,171
No,

4830
02:35:01,171 --> 02:35:01,351
no,

4831
02:35:01,351 --> 02:35:01,531
no,

4832
02:35:01,531 --> 02:35:01,741
no.

4833
02:35:01,741 --> 02:35:02,610
I'm going to jump into this.

4834
02:35:02,850 --> 02:35:03,300
It's fun.

4835
02:35:03,300 --> 02:35:04,110
It's liberals.

4836
02:35:04,110 --> 02:35:05,310
Liberals have ruined this.

4837
02:35:05,610 --> 02:35:07,260
They are the ones that fuck this up.

4838
02:35:07,440 --> 02:35:08,041
Oh they made,

4839
02:35:08,041 --> 02:35:08,640
they made,

4840
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:12,450
they made these sherbet of farmers feel
like they didn't have a voice and then

4841
02:35:12,451 --> 02:35:14,940
all of a sudden they rose
back up and they were like,

4842
02:35:14,941 --> 02:35:18,470
fuck you with your hand crafted
shoes from Brooklyn and,

4843
02:35:18,471 --> 02:35:18,741
and,

4844
02:35:18,741 --> 02:35:20,070
and that is what I'm telling you.

4845
02:35:20,130 --> 02:35:22,830
I'm saying this from friends
from Florida who voted for Trump.

4846
02:35:23,190 --> 02:35:24,450
They just feel like
they don't have a voice.

4847
02:35:24,451 --> 02:35:28,380
You get in trouble if you say something
a little racist or a little sexist and

4848
02:35:28,381 --> 02:35:29,580
that and that man serious.

4849
02:35:29,670 --> 02:35:30,560
If you're a regular person,

4850
02:35:30,580 --> 02:35:31,380
you get fired.

4851
02:35:31,380 --> 02:35:32,041
And that is what,

4852
02:35:32,041 --> 02:35:32,874
fuck this up.

4853
02:35:32,910 --> 02:35:34,110
If liberals is just being cool,

4854
02:35:34,111 --> 02:35:34,950
like just be like,

4855
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:35,401
all right,

4856
02:35:35,401 --> 02:35:35,671
cool.

4857
02:35:35,671 --> 02:35:36,750
We'll just won't say the n word.

4858
02:35:36,890 --> 02:35:37,770
Like then we'd all

4859
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:43,080
correct.

4860
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:44,240
This is the new McCarthy.

4861
02:35:44,390 --> 02:35:44,691
Is it?

4862
02:35:44,691 --> 02:35:47,320
Okay Doug,

4863
02:35:47,330 --> 02:35:47,871
stand out.

4864
02:35:47,871 --> 02:35:48,770
Who are they?

4865
02:35:48,771 --> 02:35:49,604
Burn you.

4866
02:35:49,850 --> 02:35:51,140
You talk about them.

4867
02:35:51,141 --> 02:35:53,450
But we're fed this shit from the media.

4868
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:54,050
Yeah.

4869
02:35:54,050 --> 02:35:55,790
Act like the gifts,

4870
02:35:55,791 --> 02:35:57,230
not our social circle.

4871
02:35:57,290 --> 02:35:57,541
No.

4872
02:35:57,541 --> 02:36:01,310
See your friends were upset that they
couldn't be racist or sexist and they felt

4873
02:36:01,311 --> 02:36:02,880
like they didn't have a voice to it.

4874
02:36:02,890 --> 02:36:07,890
If you voted for a reality TV show star
to be the leader of the free world.

4875
02:36:08,361 --> 02:36:09,410
Super Sad.

4876
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:15,080
Don't you guys all wish that Anderson
Cooper was laying his head in John King's

4877
02:36:15,081 --> 02:36:16,550
lap on CNN right now?

4878
02:36:18,050 --> 02:36:21,200
I wish this is true political
analysis right here.

4879
02:36:21,380 --> 02:36:23,420
I wish I knew who the fuck John King was.

4880
02:36:23,421 --> 02:36:24,380
I would laugh at that.

4881
02:36:25,490 --> 02:36:26,241
I had a bag.

4882
02:36:26,241 --> 02:36:26,981
Oh yeah.

4883
02:36:26,981 --> 02:36:27,231
Yeah,

4884
02:36:27,231 --> 02:36:28,670
that'd be fucking hilarious.

4885
02:36:28,671 --> 02:36:29,504
Google,

4886
02:36:30,580 --> 02:36:31,070
if you,

4887
02:36:31,070 --> 02:36:33,860
if you look at was talking sandy hair,

4888
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:34,410
hair

4889
02:36:34,410 --> 02:36:35,250
guy earlier.

4890
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:36,900
We're burst on the fucking,

4891
02:36:37,160 --> 02:36:38,430
he's got the shit going on.

4892
02:36:38,850 --> 02:36:40,260
He'll show you John King.

4893
02:36:40,850 --> 02:36:41,031
No,

4894
02:36:41,031 --> 02:36:42,080
this thing is like magic.

4895
02:36:42,081 --> 02:36:42,591
It's like that.

4896
02:36:42,591 --> 02:36:44,660
The screen is not
connected to the keyboard,

4897
02:36:44,661 --> 02:36:45,494
but it all works.

4898
02:36:45,590 --> 02:36:47,980
You say anything?

4899
02:36:48,590 --> 02:36:50,800
I don't get like kind of fuck like that.

4900
02:36:50,810 --> 02:36:51,680
I can do that.

4901
02:36:51,710 --> 02:36:52,700
Like how does that work?

4902
02:36:52,701 --> 02:36:53,540
Hey guys,

4903
02:36:53,541 --> 02:36:54,950
we don't have headphones on,

4904
02:36:54,951 --> 02:36:56,240
so if we talk over each other,

4905
02:36:56,241 --> 02:36:57,180
do you guys talk over each other?

4906
02:36:57,181 --> 02:36:59,330
That's going to be a disaster
for it would been a great point.

4907
02:36:59,331 --> 02:37:00,164
Three hours ago.

4908
02:37:01,640 --> 02:37:02,550
I'm sorry.

4909
02:37:09,340 --> 02:37:10,173
Oh,

4910
02:37:10,290 --> 02:37:10,930
okay.

4911
02:37:10,930 --> 02:37:11,221
All right.

4912
02:37:11,221 --> 02:37:13,040
We give all the money to bill burns.

4913
02:37:13,060 --> 02:37:13,351
Come on,

4914
02:37:13,351 --> 02:37:13,760
man.

4915
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:14,593
He's got gotta meet.

4916
02:37:15,290 --> 02:37:15,980
Bilberry is going

4917
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:18,230
to give it to some awesome
charities and smart guy.

4918
02:37:18,380 --> 02:37:19,101
How funny is it?

4919
02:37:19,101 --> 02:37:22,580
There's a blonde lady next to the
blackest guy that's ever been on TV in the

4920
02:37:22,581 --> 02:37:25,880
last 10 years and then next to
each other talking about the news.

4921
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:27,720
It looks like a health insurance best.

4922
02:37:27,721 --> 02:37:29,510
That guy lower cage from Netflix.

4923
02:37:30,710 --> 02:37:32,210
I was out there kicking ass.

4924
02:37:32,360 --> 02:37:33,193
He's a fucking,

4925
02:37:33,330 --> 02:37:35,210
you look at him as the God damn barbarian.

4926
02:37:35,211 --> 02:37:36,890
That guy is built like a fucking savage,

4927
02:37:37,650 --> 02:37:38,251
Michigan,

4928
02:37:38,251 --> 02:37:38,881
New Hampshire,

4929
02:37:38,881 --> 02:37:39,601
Pennsylvania,

4930
02:37:39,601 --> 02:37:40,351
Wisconsin.

4931
02:37:40,351 --> 02:37:42,750
Still too close to call.

4932
02:37:42,930 --> 02:37:45,060
I feel like we're having
so much fun in here,

4933
02:37:45,260 --> 02:37:46,093
but outside,

4934
02:37:46,170 --> 02:37:47,110
close to cough.

4935
02:37:47,900 --> 02:37:49,710
Just fucking

4936
02:37:54,350 --> 02:37:56,090
eating through people at the mall.

4937
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:02,750
I just came from outside.

4938
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:08,410
I left the 12 just terrified people
at my house to come here tonight.

4939
02:38:08,420 --> 02:38:09,440
You're just at your house.

4940
02:38:09,490 --> 02:38:10,550
They're at my house.

4941
02:38:12,050 --> 02:38:14,480
Interior like people are having tears.

4942
02:38:15,780 --> 02:38:16,160
Honestly,

4943
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:18,680
somebody who's crying on my deck
tonight thinking they were going to

4944
02:38:20,110 --> 02:38:20,540
God.

4945
02:38:20,540 --> 02:38:21,231
You know what I mean?

4946
02:38:21,231 --> 02:38:22,400
You didn't win an election.

4947
02:38:22,401 --> 02:38:23,870
You're going to start fucking crying.

4948
02:38:24,200 --> 02:38:24,651
Go Rake.

4949
02:38:24,651 --> 02:38:25,484
You fucking leaves.

4950
02:38:25,710 --> 02:38:27,690
Nice people who have Obamacare.

4951
02:38:30,150 --> 02:38:31,520
Who's the fucking clouds.

4952
02:38:33,870 --> 02:38:34,800
Chrysler gets up.

4953
02:38:34,830 --> 02:38:35,250
Seriously.

4954
02:38:35,250 --> 02:38:36,230
Liberals need to toughen.

4955
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:36,340
I,

4956
02:38:36,340 --> 02:38:36,691
I mean,

4957
02:38:36,691 --> 02:38:37,950
I lean left and we left.

4958
02:38:38,900 --> 02:38:39,733
They're

4959
02:38:41,130 --> 02:38:41,640
right now.

4960
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:45,180
He just wants with the tambourine,

4961
02:38:45,181 --> 02:38:46,014
this is like,

4962
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:48,121
I know,

4963
02:38:48,121 --> 02:38:48,600
but it's not,

4964
02:38:48,600 --> 02:38:51,510
it's not the voice like it
matters a little bit more.

4965
02:38:51,570 --> 02:38:54,120
If you lose that takes up
and you're going to be fine.

4966
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:55,073
No.

4967
02:38:55,380 --> 02:38:55,780
Yes,

4968
02:38:55,780 --> 02:38:56,510
you're right.

4969
02:38:56,510 --> 02:38:58,320
You're going to be fine.

4970
02:38:58,330 --> 02:38:59,163
Yeah,

4971
02:39:00,510 --> 02:39:01,260
thank done.

4972
02:39:01,260 --> 02:39:01,561
No,

4973
02:39:01,561 --> 02:39:04,920
it's such a disease to think that my,

4974
02:39:04,980 --> 02:39:06,660
the person had on a blue shirt,

4975
02:39:06,690 --> 02:39:08,440
now my life's going to be better then,

4976
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:08,881
I don't know.

4977
02:39:08,881 --> 02:39:11,010
Red fucking bow or whatever.

4978
02:39:11,070 --> 02:39:12,810
Whatever the fuck the
checks put in their hair,

4979
02:39:13,110 --> 02:39:14,070
they're going to fucking win.

4980
02:39:14,071 --> 02:39:14,340
Yeah.

4981
02:39:14,340 --> 02:39:14,750
Just,

4982
02:39:14,750 --> 02:39:15,600
you're going to be fine.

4983
02:39:16,050 --> 02:39:17,820
You make your own opportunity.

4984
02:39:18,310 --> 02:39:21,690
You pull yourself up by
your own fucking bootstraps.

4985
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:22,381
The end of the day,

4986
02:39:22,381 --> 02:39:23,780
you don't worry American Belton.

4987
02:39:23,850 --> 02:39:24,170
Right.

4988
02:39:24,170 --> 02:39:25,310
But we're all given.

4989
02:39:25,700 --> 02:39:27,730
Some people had given like a one,

4990
02:39:27,770 --> 02:39:28,603
three,

4991
02:39:28,830 --> 02:39:30,590
another dude gets to aces.

4992
02:39:30,620 --> 02:39:31,250
Right?

4993
02:39:31,250 --> 02:39:32,083
We get lucky.

4994
02:39:32,150 --> 02:39:32,980
We all do.

4995
02:39:32,980 --> 02:39:36,000
The guy with two aces doesn't give
a shit and he's never gone to.

4996
02:39:36,250 --> 02:39:40,240
And when you're an adult and you realize
that and you play the one in the three

4997
02:39:40,450 --> 02:39:41,440
and do what the fuck this,

4998
02:39:41,500 --> 02:39:42,010
that's you.

4999
02:39:42,010 --> 02:39:43,030
That's your best bet.

5000
02:39:43,870 --> 02:39:47,980
To try to get someone with two
fucking asis to give a fuck.

5001
02:39:48,370 --> 02:39:53,020
Is this the desk basically a trust fund
kid to get them to give a shit about

5002
02:39:53,021 --> 02:39:55,600
anybody below someone
who just owns a Chili's,

5003
02:39:55,601 --> 02:39:57,130
forget about the people who work there.

5004
02:39:57,400 --> 02:39:58,630
It's fucking impossible.

5005
02:39:58,830 --> 02:39:59,820
Most likely,

5006
02:40:00,210 --> 02:40:01,200
most likely,

5007
02:40:01,710 --> 02:40:04,410
depending upon how they're
raised by their parents.

5008
02:40:04,650 --> 02:40:07,800
If they get really lucky and
they find a conscientious parent,

5009
02:40:08,060 --> 02:40:09,750
it tries to explain to them things,

5010
02:40:09,900 --> 02:40:12,300
they'll get a more nuanced
perspective of life,

5011
02:40:12,570 --> 02:40:15,360
but they're never to have the same
perspective as a guy like Mike Tyson.

5012
02:40:15,361 --> 02:40:19,770
He grows up in a horrible neighborhood
and learns how to just be the best of the

5013
02:40:19,771 --> 02:40:24,771
best with a fury that you cannot stop
and that is only awarded to people that

5014
02:40:25,381 --> 02:40:26,214
are suppressed.

5015
02:40:26,370 --> 02:40:29,790
There's this weird thing that happens
with human beings when we're suppressed.

5016
02:40:29,940 --> 02:40:32,760
When added that emerges is very bizarre.

5017
02:40:32,910 --> 02:40:33,601
Intense,

5018
02:40:33,601 --> 02:40:38,601
like almost Super Nova type energy that
you see from people like Eddie Murphy or

5019
02:40:38,761 --> 02:40:40,830
Richard Pryor or Chris Rock.

5020
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:41,880
There's a lot of them.

5021
02:40:41,970 --> 02:40:42,803
Right?

5022
02:40:43,100 --> 02:40:45,010
I'll Trump Greg Fitzsimmons

5023
02:40:47,890 --> 02:40:48,520
sorry,

5024
02:40:48,520 --> 02:40:49,480
bring away to the Joe.

5025
02:40:49,540 --> 02:40:50,670
You guys just weren't there.

5026
02:40:50,680 --> 02:40:51,090
Sorry.

5027
02:40:51,090 --> 02:40:51,940
Can I say that?

5028
02:40:52,220 --> 02:40:52,620
Uh,

5029
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:54,330
have you heard that study about like,

5030
02:40:54,360 --> 02:40:56,790
you know how they tried to
figure out like if everybody eat,

5031
02:40:56,820 --> 02:40:59,700
they always say like anybody can
be president of the United States,

5032
02:40:59,701 --> 02:40:59,971
right?

5033
02:40:59,971 --> 02:41:00,691
Like anybody,

5034
02:41:00,691 --> 02:41:03,810
everybody in America has
the same opportunities.

5035
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:08,760
But what they've found is that some people
have one opportunity and other people

5036
02:41:08,761 --> 02:41:12,210
have many opportunities
and that's the difference.

5037
02:41:12,630 --> 02:41:14,380
So are you saying the world is unfair?

5038
02:41:21,870 --> 02:41:22,051
No,

5039
02:41:22,051 --> 02:41:24,960
but you're saying you're saying

5040
02:41:32,610 --> 02:41:33,900
100% agree with you.

5041
02:41:34,500 --> 02:41:35,333
The world is

5042
02:41:35,550 --> 02:41:35,881
fair,

5043
02:41:35,881 --> 02:41:40,200
but what you're expecting is people have
the advantage to take the time to have

5044
02:41:40,201 --> 02:41:40,350
the,

5045
02:41:40,350 --> 02:41:40,641
the,

5046
02:41:40,641 --> 02:41:40,911
the,

5047
02:41:40,911 --> 02:41:42,720
the maturity to give a shit.

5048
02:41:42,721 --> 02:41:43,710
They're not going to do it.

5049
02:41:43,711 --> 02:41:44,760
That's not what I'm expecting.

5050
02:41:45,100 --> 02:41:50,100
That we have not been connected
since the second you said 50% of it.

5051
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:51,780
I'll take 49

5052
02:41:53,430 --> 02:41:54,263
great example.

5053
02:41:54,730 --> 02:41:55,501
The Oscars.

5054
02:41:55,501 --> 02:41:56,610
Watch the Oscars right?

5055
02:41:56,611 --> 02:41:58,530
They're always talking about
more and more diversity,

5056
02:41:58,590 --> 02:42:02,400
but it never changes because you're
asking for somebody to give up their

5057
02:42:02,401 --> 02:42:06,450
nomination or their seat in the fucking
show and they're never going to fucking

5058
02:42:06,451 --> 02:42:10,350
do it because they're cool change for
everybody else as long as they get there

5059
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:11,550
and that's why I won't fucking,

5060
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:14,010
it's very hard to get anybody changed.

5061
02:42:14,011 --> 02:42:15,200
Could you ask him the sacrifice

5062
02:42:15,300 --> 02:42:16,310
because they're selfish.

5063
02:42:16,610 --> 02:42:17,443
It's good.

5064
02:42:17,680 --> 02:42:18,600
It's good to teach.

5065
02:42:18,601 --> 02:42:20,880
Somebody has on a yellow dress on CNN.

5066
02:42:21,860 --> 02:42:22,693
Beautiful.

5067
02:42:22,710 --> 02:42:25,740
Don't you guys think that famine thinking

5068
02:42:26,750 --> 02:42:28,220
because there's a limited,

5069
02:42:28,460 --> 02:42:32,450
there's a limited ability to communicate
with people you didn't know just

5070
02:42:32,451 --> 02:42:33,070
recently.

5071
02:42:33,070 --> 02:42:33,221
Hey,

5072
02:42:33,221 --> 02:42:35,230
what is some 20 years ago?

5073
02:42:35,560 --> 02:42:36,880
What is some gum like?

5074
02:42:36,881 --> 02:42:39,430
The flavor lasts for fucking
ever and then other gum,

5075
02:42:40,750 --> 02:42:42,580
it's like it's gone in a minute.

5076
02:42:43,900 --> 02:42:44,321
It's like,

5077
02:42:44,321 --> 02:42:46,240
it's like the boy band a gum like,

5078
02:42:46,270 --> 02:42:46,841
oh my God,

5079
02:42:46,841 --> 02:42:47,860
this is fucking amazing.

5080
02:42:47,861 --> 02:42:48,694
And then is,

5081
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:53,450
how do you feel about that
gum gum gum squirt comes,

5082
02:42:53,500 --> 02:42:54,670
it's not that it's sports,

5083
02:42:54,671 --> 02:42:55,481
the freaks me out.

5084
02:42:55,481 --> 02:42:56,540
It's just not,

5085
02:42:56,560 --> 02:42:57,490
it doesn't taste good.

5086
02:42:57,491 --> 02:42:58,324
Powerful.

5087
02:42:58,600 --> 02:43:00,300
It's like mouthwash and the gum.

5088
02:43:02,240 --> 02:43:03,450
Tell us about your experience

5089
02:43:04,870 --> 02:43:08,430
work because at the
beginning it's just so good,

5090
02:43:08,590 --> 02:43:09,030
you know,

5091
02:43:09,030 --> 02:43:10,860
and then it just kind of
wears off and you're like,

5092
02:43:10,870 --> 02:43:11,200
well,

5093
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:11,980
I just need to buy

5094
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:12,813
more gum.

5095
02:43:14,710 --> 02:43:15,380
Are you all right?

5096
02:43:15,380 --> 02:43:19,390
You're getting New Hampshire
[inaudible] still too close to call.

5097
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:22,180
You make tanker holaps though.

5098
02:43:22,181 --> 02:43:23,230
You're killing right now.

5099
02:43:26,370 --> 02:43:29,690
I stance as a crowd and as
we got a score in the back

5100
02:43:31,790 --> 02:43:34,560
2021 yeah.

5101
02:43:36,560 --> 02:43:37,460
I don't know what that means,

5102
02:43:37,461 --> 02:43:38,720
but I'll take it for some reason.

5103
02:43:38,721 --> 02:43:40,760
That was a Bruins Tampa Bay score to me.

5104
02:43:41,330 --> 02:43:44,690
I thought you said stamp zoos have some
crazy fucking score going on in the

5105
02:43:44,691 --> 02:43:45,050
back.

5106
02:43:45,050 --> 02:43:45,883
That's okay too.

5107
02:43:45,970 --> 02:43:46,611
Iphone guy.

5108
02:43:46,611 --> 02:43:47,091
What do you got?

5109
02:43:47,091 --> 02:43:49,220
I still got to 38 to 15 what do you got?

5110
02:43:51,230 --> 02:43:51,900
Hello?

5111
02:43:51,900 --> 02:43:52,733
Trump.

5112
02:43:52,910 --> 02:43:53,290
Oh,

5113
02:43:53,290 --> 02:43:53,860
come on.

5114
02:43:53,860 --> 02:43:54,693
Whoa.

5115
02:43:55,280 --> 02:43:57,270
Then one of the fucking pillar,

5116
02:43:58,110 --> 02:43:59,920
the red pillar in the corner.

5117
02:43:59,921 --> 02:44:00,754
Loving it.

5118
02:44:02,830 --> 02:44:04,300
He's going to make his life,

5119
02:44:04,301 --> 02:44:05,134
Craig.

5120
02:44:05,590 --> 02:44:05,861
Oh,

5121
02:44:05,861 --> 02:44:06,850
bullshit aside.

5122
02:44:07,030 --> 02:44:09,940
I'll fill all Donald Trump's
going to call you tomorrow.

5123
02:44:13,130 --> 02:44:14,660
How weird does this feel?

5124
02:44:16,880 --> 02:44:16,980
Hey,

5125
02:44:16,980 --> 02:44:19,810
you got to admit this
motherfucker in the corner.

5126
02:44:20,050 --> 02:44:21,760
Nobody thought it was
going to be this close.

5127
02:44:21,761 --> 02:44:22,590
This is insane.

5128
02:44:22,590 --> 02:44:25,590
Who says it's awesome for real dude,

5129
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:27,790
my friend?

5130
02:44:27,790 --> 02:44:28,001
No,

5131
02:44:28,001 --> 02:44:28,330
judge,

5132
02:44:28,330 --> 02:44:29,300
this is what you have to think.

5133
02:44:29,860 --> 02:44:33,050
Bill Burns is the guy right
there is said is this,

5134
02:44:35,560 --> 02:44:36,101
I'm not going to,

5135
02:44:36,101 --> 02:44:36,730
I'm at camp.

5136
02:44:36,730 --> 02:44:38,080
I can't say to these people,

5137
02:44:38,380 --> 02:44:39,640
Shit that might happen.

5138
02:44:39,820 --> 02:44:40,653
Hold on.

5139
02:44:40,900 --> 02:44:42,400
I want to hear this dude talk.

5140
02:44:43,180 --> 02:44:44,013
What?

5141
02:44:45,500 --> 02:44:46,780
It's like a town hall.

5142
02:44:49,050 --> 02:44:49,600
Yeah,

5143
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:50,080
family.

5144
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:52,040
Just like a ton town hall,

5145
02:44:52,041 --> 02:44:53,480
but nobody knows the issues.

5146
02:44:54,980 --> 02:44:56,480
So it's a town hall.

5147
02:44:57,180 --> 02:44:58,160
Call it today.

5148
02:44:58,720 --> 02:44:59,780
You want to go to the booth.

5149
02:44:59,930 --> 02:45:01,990
If you stick your card in each tank,

5150
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:05,510
going over all the different things
that you agree with or don't agree with,

5151
02:45:05,511 --> 02:45:06,200
you go,

5152
02:45:06,200 --> 02:45:06,621
ah,

5153
02:45:06,621 --> 02:45:08,300
I should have fucking
probably studied this.

5154
02:45:10,580 --> 02:45:10,971
Hey Dude,

5155
02:45:10,971 --> 02:45:11,781
look at all this shit.

5156
02:45:11,781 --> 02:45:12,320
I was like,

5157
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:12,920
um,

5158
02:45:12,920 --> 02:45:13,400
schools.

5159
02:45:13,400 --> 02:45:13,641
Well,

5160
02:45:13,641 --> 02:45:14,474
how much do,

5161
02:45:14,720 --> 02:45:14,871
well,

5162
02:45:14,871 --> 02:45:17,830
how much do they need
when they ask it for?

5163
02:45:17,831 --> 02:45:19,400
I don't know how the
fuck the parameters are.

5164
02:45:19,430 --> 02:45:20,263
Okay.

5165
02:45:20,330 --> 02:45:21,420
Did you guys already know?

5166
02:45:21,620 --> 02:45:23,330
But how'd they get on death row?

5167
02:45:23,670 --> 02:45:24,530
The fuck they do.

5168
02:45:24,531 --> 02:45:24,891
I don't know.

5169
02:45:24,891 --> 02:45:25,670
These dudes,

5170
02:45:25,670 --> 02:45:27,620
you know something if you
actually researched it,

5171
02:45:27,621 --> 02:45:29,840
it's still just as cause confusing.

5172
02:45:29,870 --> 02:45:31,760
I'm sure cause I looked at all,

5173
02:45:31,761 --> 02:45:32,630
I had all my shy,

5174
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:33,500
my cheat sheet.

5175
02:45:33,501 --> 02:45:38,360
I was in and out in 30 seconds but like
every fucking amendment was just like,

5176
02:45:38,420 --> 02:45:43,420
hey this is a man men to make sure the
sun doesn't burn out and then we need the

5177
02:45:44,121 --> 02:45:45,310
sun to heat the earth.

5178
02:45:45,340 --> 02:45:45,711
You're like,

5179
02:45:45,711 --> 02:45:45,951
yeah,

5180
02:45:45,951 --> 02:45:46,671
I'm for this.

5181
02:45:46,671 --> 02:45:48,110
And then the next thing
would be the argument.

5182
02:45:48,111 --> 02:45:48,800
It can be like,

5183
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:52,010
actually this doesn't prevent
the sun from burning out.

5184
02:45:52,011 --> 02:45:53,480
It's the exact opposite.

5185
02:45:53,690 --> 02:45:57,230
This is pouring water on the sun and by
the end of it you're just like I don't,

5186
02:45:57,231 --> 02:45:58,370
I don't know who do I believe.

5187
02:45:58,640 --> 02:46:01,580
And then you just look
at who was Ford Nra,

5188
02:46:01,610 --> 02:46:02,870
Ed Begley Jr.

5189
02:46:03,110 --> 02:46:04,540
It was all over the same day.

5190
02:46:04,680 --> 02:46:06,410
I knew like who agrees with this?

5191
02:46:06,620 --> 02:46:08,030
Who does this disagree with?

5192
02:46:08,031 --> 02:46:08,990
And that's what you went with.

5193
02:46:09,890 --> 02:46:10,040
That

5194
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:10,873
was it.

5195
02:46:11,630 --> 02:46:13,340
But I hate all my shit lined up.

5196
02:46:13,360 --> 02:46:16,340
I was looking at all the answers to the
test and I would just flip the page.

5197
02:46:17,180 --> 02:46:17,601
Two Up,

5198
02:46:17,601 --> 02:46:18,321
two down,

5199
02:46:18,321 --> 02:46:19,070
one up,

5200
02:46:19,070 --> 02:46:19,401
Bam,

5201
02:46:19,401 --> 02:46:19,700
Bam,

5202
02:46:19,700 --> 02:46:19,881
Bam,

5203
02:46:19,881 --> 02:46:20,031
Bam,

5204
02:46:20,031 --> 02:46:20,864
Bam.

5205
02:46:21,170 --> 02:46:22,003
Right?

5206
02:46:22,190 --> 02:46:23,840
Just want to go to the airport.

5207
02:46:24,020 --> 02:46:25,880
I'm ready to go right
through the security line.

5208
02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:28,860
You guys have a lot of people telling
you this federation for the person behind

5209
02:46:28,900 --> 02:46:29,300
check.

5210
02:46:29,300 --> 02:46:31,280
Were you with a lot of
people with their kids?

5211
02:46:31,430 --> 02:46:31,760
Oh,

5212
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:32,011
sorry.

5213
02:46:32,011 --> 02:46:34,250
Or You with a lot of people
with their kids voting today.

5214
02:46:34,420 --> 02:46:39,100
There was a little girl who liked
over explained like how the vote,

5215
02:46:39,270 --> 02:46:42,890
how many people were drinking soda
chips in it were volunteering.

5216
02:46:43,070 --> 02:46:43,461
Oh really?

5217
02:46:43,461 --> 02:46:48,020
Like this is some weird poisoning we're
watching and it's a delicious poison.

5218
02:46:48,930 --> 02:46:49,190
Right?

5219
02:46:49,190 --> 02:46:51,220
Did people behind me were dragging a,

5220
02:46:51,230 --> 02:46:55,670
the people behind me were drinking like
a homemade smoothies and cups with like

5221
02:46:55,671 --> 02:46:57,280
glass straws and I was like,

5222
02:46:57,310 --> 02:46:57,461
oh,

5223
02:46:57,461 --> 02:46:58,180
this isn't,

5224
02:46:58,180 --> 02:47:00,610
we're not going the way my line is.

5225
02:47:00,950 --> 02:47:01,783
It's like

5226
02:47:03,640 --> 02:47:04,473
I brought my,

5227
02:47:05,930 --> 02:47:06,171
wait,

5228
02:47:06,171 --> 02:47:08,510
can I ask a question for
those who voted in la?

5229
02:47:08,680 --> 02:47:08,910
Yeah.

5230
02:47:08,910 --> 02:47:12,770
Were you guys like like 90%
yeses with like five nos?

5231
02:47:15,070 --> 02:47:15,320
No,

5232
02:47:15,320 --> 02:47:17,020
I had a lot of no's.

5233
02:47:17,110 --> 02:47:20,410
I had no nose leave then what
do you mean no for nothing?

5234
02:47:20,411 --> 02:47:24,700
I figured and then and then when you
picked your judges and third question is

5235
02:47:24,701 --> 02:47:25,930
actual human beings.

5236
02:47:25,931 --> 02:47:27,290
You can't just yes and no.

5237
02:47:27,400 --> 02:47:27,580
No,

5238
02:47:27,580 --> 02:47:27,701
no,

5239
02:47:27,701 --> 02:47:27,970
no,

5240
02:47:27,970 --> 02:47:28,181
no.

5241
02:47:28,181 --> 02:47:31,930
I mean I'm just saying it like for all
the things I voted no with the condoms

5242
02:47:32,440 --> 02:47:35,380
and then yes and no the condoms.

5243
02:47:35,381 --> 02:47:38,380
But like I was predominantly
know what the tobacco tax,

5244
02:47:38,530 --> 02:47:39,010
right?

5245
02:47:39,010 --> 02:47:39,720
No,

5246
02:47:39,720 --> 02:47:39,901
no,

5247
02:47:39,901 --> 02:47:40,021
no,

5248
02:47:40,021 --> 02:47:40,121
no.

5249
02:47:40,121 --> 02:47:40,954
I bought a dance with them.

5250
02:47:43,370 --> 02:47:44,000
I bought it.

5251
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:44,833
Yes.

5252
02:47:47,980 --> 02:47:48,813
I'm a,

5253
02:47:49,100 --> 02:47:49,461
I'm a,

5254
02:47:49,461 --> 02:47:50,294
I'm a heavy,

5255
02:47:50,770 --> 02:47:53,150
I'll say I'm a heavy smoker.

5256
02:47:53,151 --> 02:47:54,820
I voted yes on the tobacco town.

5257
02:47:54,830 --> 02:47:59,510
Was another one about building up the
schools and it was presented by the

5258
02:47:59,511 --> 02:48:01,300
builders and like those crooked flux.

5259
02:48:01,320 --> 02:48:01,610
Yeah.

5260
02:48:01,610 --> 02:48:02,443
Fuck them.

5261
02:48:02,930 --> 02:48:03,630
Morgan one.

5262
02:48:03,630 --> 02:48:04,430
Yeah.

5263
02:48:04,430 --> 02:48:04,851
I said,

5264
02:48:04,851 --> 02:48:05,631
I am a,

5265
02:48:05,631 --> 02:48:05,991
I'm a,

5266
02:48:05,991 --> 02:48:07,220
I'm a heavy smoker.

5267
02:48:07,221 --> 02:48:09,110
I voted yes on the tobacco tax.

5268
02:48:09,230 --> 02:48:10,310
Whoa.

5269
02:48:10,370 --> 02:48:11,203
I did.

5270
02:48:13,390 --> 02:48:14,000
No,

5271
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:17,840
I think more money should go to research
the shit that I'm doing to myself as

5272
02:48:17,841 --> 02:48:18,471
I'm smoking.

5273
02:48:18,471 --> 02:48:19,580
Like that's how I feel.

5274
02:48:19,581 --> 02:48:20,061
I do.

5275
02:48:20,061 --> 02:48:23,300
I feel like I would like to get older and
find out I have something they already

5276
02:48:23,301 --> 02:48:23,840
cured.

5277
02:48:23,840 --> 02:48:24,411
Honestly.

5278
02:48:24,411 --> 02:48:25,244
Energy,

5279
02:48:25,370 --> 02:48:27,500
drinks and cigarettes
of stunted my growth.

5280
02:48:27,501 --> 02:48:28,334
I feel great.

5281
02:48:29,540 --> 02:48:30,980
I voted for the Armenian.

5282
02:48:31,880 --> 02:48:33,220
Oh Hey,

5283
02:48:33,260 --> 02:48:35,090
he's got to go to billboard on Virgil.

5284
02:48:35,210 --> 02:48:36,043
I like him.

5285
02:48:36,110 --> 02:48:38,980
You guys all the no on the condoms thing.

5286
02:48:39,110 --> 02:48:39,530
Yeah.

5287
02:48:39,530 --> 02:48:40,460
No condoms.

5288
02:48:40,550 --> 02:48:41,180
No ICAD.

5289
02:48:41,180 --> 02:48:41,750
Debs.

5290
02:48:41,750 --> 02:48:42,583
What'd you vote?

5291
02:48:42,650 --> 02:48:43,730
I voted yes.

5292
02:48:44,340 --> 02:48:45,220
Ooh,

5293
02:48:50,010 --> 02:48:50,843
love it.

5294
02:48:52,910 --> 02:48:54,870
Well because I think uh,

5295
02:48:55,250 --> 02:48:57,730
porn is ruining men and I think that if,

5296
02:48:57,760 --> 02:48:58,040
if,

5297
02:48:58,040 --> 02:48:58,873
if,

5298
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:04,740
no,

5299
02:49:04,740 --> 02:49:07,110
she's and how she's right.

5300
02:49:08,820 --> 02:49:09,211
I get it.

5301
02:49:09,211 --> 02:49:10,044
Cause I voted,

5302
02:49:10,050 --> 02:49:10,883
I voted,

5303
02:49:12,100 --> 02:49:12,933
I'm sorry.

5304
02:49:12,940 --> 02:49:17,940
I think that the one thing that porn is
doing is like not making men like go out

5305
02:49:20,681 --> 02:49:23,500
and try to be like fucking
like pickup chicks.

5306
02:49:23,680 --> 02:49:27,550
And I feel like if they stopped watching
porn and tried to be resourceful,

5307
02:49:27,551 --> 02:49:28,480
that would be fucking

5308
02:49:34,540 --> 02:49:35,280
pornography.

5309
02:49:35,280 --> 02:49:38,070
No Man to try their thing.

5310
02:49:38,450 --> 02:49:39,750
She wants to get hit on.

5311
02:49:39,960 --> 02:49:40,531
I thought it was,

5312
02:49:40,531 --> 02:49:41,364
she cared about.

5313
02:49:43,320 --> 02:49:43,621
No,

5314
02:49:43,621 --> 02:49:44,454
that's not it.

5315
02:49:47,670 --> 02:49:49,890
Millennials are having less
sex than their parents.

5316
02:49:49,891 --> 02:49:51,390
Like guys don't want to go out and

5317
02:49:57,580 --> 02:49:58,430
just start a curious,

5318
02:49:59,280 --> 02:50:00,600
just out of curiosity,

5319
02:50:00,690 --> 02:50:05,690
how could they possibly know
if millennials are having
less sex than their past?

5320
02:50:06,780 --> 02:50:08,970
How do you know they do research?

5321
02:50:10,650 --> 02:50:11,483
How

5322
02:50:18,860 --> 02:50:21,900
to times you've been on the
fucking mall and somebody goes,

5323
02:50:22,140 --> 02:50:23,170
can you stop right now?

5324
02:50:23,171 --> 02:50:24,150
I want to take this survey.

5325
02:50:24,210 --> 02:50:25,350
Anybody intelligent?

5326
02:50:26,060 --> 02:50:27,460
I got shit to do.

5327
02:50:27,461 --> 02:50:28,294
Slice.

5328
02:50:28,350 --> 02:50:31,260
I can tell you I voted.

5329
02:50:32,330 --> 02:50:37,330
I think like just young kids are just
not interested in video games and Netflix

5330
02:50:38,451 --> 02:50:42,350
and porn and like why would they want
to go out and fucking meet women?

5331
02:50:42,570 --> 02:50:43,560
I voted no.

5332
02:50:43,890 --> 02:50:45,600
I'm not saying they need to meet me,

5333
02:50:47,510 --> 02:50:50,940
meet me spitting in each other's mouths

5334
02:50:52,660 --> 02:50:55,750
with the women in his life
and he wants just release.

5335
02:50:56,370 --> 02:50:57,330
I'm fine with that.

5336
02:50:58,910 --> 02:50:59,880
His testicles

5337
02:51:02,820 --> 02:51:04,530
influencing my decision.

5338
02:51:04,630 --> 02:51:05,463
Are you released

5339
02:51:07,800 --> 02:51:09,230
and it helps to man.

5340
02:51:09,240 --> 02:51:12,090
Sometimes if you watch other people,

5341
02:51:12,091 --> 02:51:12,924
fuck,

5342
02:51:13,730 --> 02:51:14,990
I understand that,

5343
02:51:14,991 --> 02:51:16,800
but I think every patient,

5344
02:51:21,470 --> 02:51:24,440
everything in excess including
washing your fucking hands,

5345
02:51:24,450 --> 02:51:27,710
you've got no still too close to call
people's 10 times a day you need a hug.

5346
02:51:27,770 --> 02:51:27,920
Well,

5347
02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:32,920
I just think Elvis sudden it makes the
porn straight like what they're doing

5348
02:51:34,230 --> 02:51:35,000
going on.

5349
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:40,000
It was pushes it further underground
and makes it more dangerous so the girls

5350
02:51:40,191 --> 02:51:42,260
have to have sex in worse places.

5351
02:51:42,290 --> 02:51:42,771
That's all.

5352
02:51:42,771 --> 02:51:44,540
Does he ever go get rid of

5353
02:51:47,470 --> 02:51:48,760
your freedom of speech?

5354
02:51:48,761 --> 02:51:49,840
L Know your thoughts?

5355
02:51:50,080 --> 02:51:50,890
I'm trying.

5356
02:51:50,890 --> 02:51:53,360
I'm trying to yell,

5357
02:51:53,370 --> 02:51:53,770
but no,

5358
02:51:53,770 --> 02:51:54,020
I'm,

5359
02:51:54,020 --> 02:51:55,900
I'm against it.

5360
02:51:55,930 --> 02:51:56,820
I'm sorry Sarah.

5361
02:51:56,830 --> 02:51:59,330
I don't mean I'm not afraid.

5362
02:52:02,060 --> 02:52:03,510
Let's go dirtier.

5363
02:52:04,110 --> 02:52:06,470
Let's go fucking release

5364
02:52:06,470 --> 02:52:07,540
it to Joe

5365
02:52:09,480 --> 02:52:10,301
and after it's done,

5366
02:52:10,301 --> 02:52:11,134
you go.

5367
02:52:11,380 --> 02:52:11,741
All right.

5368
02:52:11,741 --> 02:52:12,530
Whatever.

5369
02:52:12,530 --> 02:52:13,251
Alaska,

5370
02:52:13,251 --> 02:52:14,790
it's still too early to call.

5371
02:52:14,791 --> 02:52:15,150
No,

5372
02:52:15,150 --> 02:52:15,983
I don't give a fuck.

5373
02:52:16,990 --> 02:52:18,330
I'm talking about making pizza.

5374
02:52:18,420 --> 02:52:18,600
Well,

5375
02:52:18,600 --> 02:52:19,433
I'll get him.

5376
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:23,490
Let us meet you.

5377
02:52:23,490 --> 02:52:24,323
Absolutely.

5378
02:52:27,180 --> 02:52:28,013
Ellen,

5379
02:52:29,690 --> 02:52:33,100
do you watch porn stare or
are you going to watch boring?

5380
02:52:34,570 --> 02:52:35,970
He doesn't watch porn anymore.

5381
02:52:36,080 --> 02:52:36,341
See,

5382
02:52:36,341 --> 02:52:37,031
I have a theory.

5383
02:52:37,031 --> 02:52:41,290
It's the people that feel the one condoms
in porn or like people that say they

5384
02:52:41,291 --> 02:52:41,921
hate Kanya.

5385
02:52:41,921 --> 02:52:43,210
You just don't watch porn.

5386
02:52:43,211 --> 02:52:44,650
You just don't listen to rap.

5387
02:52:45,650 --> 02:52:46,810
If you wasn't a wrap,

5388
02:52:46,811 --> 02:52:47,860
then you love con.

5389
02:52:47,870 --> 02:52:50,410
Everybody wants to hate on
Kanye and hate on condoms.

5390
02:52:50,411 --> 02:52:51,370
They're very close.

5391
02:52:52,010 --> 02:52:54,260
No Tony Hitch

5392
02:52:54,260 --> 02:52:55,150
to if I've got a theory,

5393
02:52:55,151 --> 02:52:58,120
I think a person can only watch so many
people fucking this whole lifetime and I

5394
02:52:58,121 --> 02:53:00,760
think Sarah overdosed long time ago.

5395
02:53:00,990 --> 02:53:01,291
Yeah,

5396
02:53:01,291 --> 02:53:01,970
Sarah's been,

5397
02:53:01,970 --> 02:53:03,730
Sarah has been like over protective.

5398
02:53:03,750 --> 02:53:06,420
She says like two condoms
on her entire life.

5399
02:53:06,530 --> 02:53:11,210
She specialized in black dudes wear
timberlands like jump out of helicopters

5400
02:53:12,970 --> 02:53:16,400
in this girls and they're run into the
snow and they tripped and the pants fall

5401
02:53:16,401 --> 02:53:17,100
down.

5402
02:53:17,100 --> 02:53:18,780
The only magnum I want to see,

5403
02:53:18,781 --> 02:53:22,170
the only magnum I want to see
in a porno is a big black guy.

5404
02:53:22,171 --> 02:53:26,000
Fucking a dirty white trash
white girl named magnum.

5405
02:53:29,010 --> 02:53:29,700
I Dunno.

5406
02:53:29,700 --> 02:53:31,500
I mean all I know,

5407
02:53:33,400 --> 02:53:37,300
all I know is my experience with
it and that and my experience

5408
02:53:37,370 --> 02:53:38,011
shopping them out.

5409
02:53:38,011 --> 02:53:38,844
I'm going to be honest,

5410
02:53:40,080 --> 02:53:41,490
Tony fucked it up.

5411
02:53:42,580 --> 02:53:43,900
You guys can all hate me.

5412
02:53:43,901 --> 02:53:44,734
It's just like,

5413
02:53:45,530 --> 02:53:46,363
oh,

5414
02:53:47,800 --> 02:53:49,030
nobody hates you.

5415
02:53:50,810 --> 02:53:52,940
I'm not backing down from my position.

5416
02:53:52,941 --> 02:53:57,230
I just think that there's too much porn
out there and it's making guys thing

5417
02:53:57,350 --> 02:54:01,490
that women want to do those positions
and every time I'm with a new guy,

5418
02:54:02,830 --> 02:54:03,540
the new guy in my,

5419
02:54:03,540 --> 02:54:04,280
what are you doing?

5420
02:54:04,280 --> 02:54:09,160
The romantic comedies where guys
run through airports and fuck it,

5421
02:54:12,150 --> 02:54:17,150
I'm going to take the next several shades
of gray was the biggest selling book

5422
02:54:17,691 --> 02:54:19,790
in the history of fucking human beings.

5423
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:21,380
Okay.

5424
02:54:21,380 --> 02:54:24,380
It brought back were
we're running down a row.

5425
02:54:24,680 --> 02:54:25,513
Yes.

5426
02:54:27,420 --> 02:54:28,253
Crazy,

5427
02:54:28,370 --> 02:54:33,220
crazy bitches across the globe when
asking random dudes and spit them out,

5428
02:54:33,470 --> 02:54:35,510
do you understand what the fuck happened?

5429
02:54:35,990 --> 02:54:38,630
One person wrote a crazy book to cracked.

5430
02:54:40,760 --> 02:54:41,840
That's so true.

5431
02:54:41,841 --> 02:54:44,090
It's like we got to keep that door shut.

5432
02:54:47,060 --> 02:54:48,510
The lady that's all that.

5433
02:54:48,511 --> 02:54:53,511
I just think that it's more interesting
to not try to push me in certain

5434
02:54:54,770 --> 02:54:56,740
positions that I can do anymore.

5435
02:54:57,410 --> 02:54:58,640
I think a really good point.

5436
02:54:59,320 --> 02:54:59,510
Yeah.

5437
02:54:59,510 --> 02:55:04,510
I just think it gives men a negative
imagery and a false of what a woman's body

5438
02:55:04,911 --> 02:55:09,260
is like and instead of paying attention
to what I need and what I want porn and

5439
02:55:09,261 --> 02:55:12,650
then you can't get off and then they can't
get off because they're just thinking

5440
02:55:12,651 --> 02:55:13,660
about Sa.

5441
02:55:13,970 --> 02:55:16,190
They can't in your circumstance,

5442
02:55:16,191 --> 02:55:17,480
but that's what part is.

5443
02:55:17,850 --> 02:55:20,450
I'm just telling you it's all I can
think that's what porn is though.

5444
02:55:20,480 --> 02:55:21,950
Porn is a false imagery.

5445
02:55:21,951 --> 02:55:22,580
It's just something.

5446
02:55:22,580 --> 02:55:22,760
Yeah.

5447
02:55:22,760 --> 02:55:23,930
Just like Sam said,

5448
02:55:23,931 --> 02:55:25,000
it's a romantic comedy.

5449
02:55:25,010 --> 02:55:25,371
It's a,

5450
02:55:25,371 --> 02:55:25,740
it's the,

5451
02:55:25,740 --> 02:55:26,630
why not do it.

5452
02:55:26,720 --> 02:55:27,860
Oh Jesus.

5453
02:55:28,090 --> 02:55:28,630
Yeah.

5454
02:55:28,630 --> 02:55:28,790
For,

5455
02:55:28,790 --> 02:55:29,623
for,

5456
02:55:30,010 --> 02:55:30,701
come on guys.

5457
02:55:30,701 --> 02:55:31,810
Let's get off of this.

5458
02:55:33,330 --> 02:55:34,480
Let's just get off.

5459
02:55:38,910 --> 02:55:40,310
I just want to be honest with you people.

5460
02:55:40,330 --> 02:55:43,140
This might be the greatest
thing I've ever been a part of

5461
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:47,953
my,

5462
02:55:48,790 --> 02:55:50,070
put this thing together.

5463
02:55:54,060 --> 02:55:54,631
Come on,

5464
02:55:54,631 --> 02:55:55,464
sit down.

5465
02:55:55,490 --> 02:55:56,323
Sit down.

5466
02:55:57,930 --> 02:55:59,190
What are you trying to do?

5467
02:55:59,730 --> 02:56:00,650
Come sit with us.

5468
02:56:01,090 --> 02:56:01,531
All right.

5469
02:56:01,531 --> 02:56:01,970
I Dunno.

5470
02:56:01,970 --> 02:56:04,590
I Dunno what the fuck is going
on in the country right now,

5471
02:56:04,591 --> 02:56:06,540
but it's still to answer her fucking,

5472
02:56:07,420 --> 02:56:10,140
it's two 38 to 15

5473
02:56:11,920 --> 02:56:12,940
to 15 yup.

5474
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:13,411
That's,

5475
02:56:13,411 --> 02:56:14,130
it's still that.

5476
02:56:14,130 --> 02:56:14,840
What are you doing?

5477
02:56:14,840 --> 02:56:15,673
You can't,

5478
02:56:17,650 --> 02:56:17,801
no,

5479
02:56:17,801 --> 02:56:17,920
no,

5480
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:18,101
no.

5481
02:56:18,101 --> 02:56:18,940
He's not calling anybody.

5482
02:56:19,460 --> 02:56:21,580
This will be a good time
for like a raffle or

5483
02:56:23,500 --> 02:56:24,161
auction off.

5484
02:56:24,161 --> 02:56:24,821
Do you guys,

5485
02:56:24,821 --> 02:56:25,654
what do we got?

5486
02:56:26,770 --> 02:56:27,491
I would like to,

5487
02:56:27,491 --> 02:56:29,920
I would like to say as
an open minded mail,

5488
02:56:30,040 --> 02:56:33,640
I enjoy the discussion with Sarah and I
find it interesting to see a different

5489
02:56:33,641 --> 02:56:35,950
perspective and that's
what this election's about.

5490
02:56:36,040 --> 02:56:36,873
Cause guess what?

5491
02:56:36,910 --> 02:56:40,260
We're all going to internment camps when
he fucking finds out who we voted for.

5492
02:56:41,680 --> 02:56:42,890
Trump's bring him back in turn.

5493
02:56:42,950 --> 02:56:43,840
Mccafe motherfuckers.

5494
02:56:43,850 --> 02:56:44,320
Yeah,

5495
02:56:44,320 --> 02:56:45,041
it's great.

5496
02:56:45,041 --> 02:56:46,240
We live in a democracy.

5497
02:56:46,241 --> 02:56:49,080
Some people want condoms in
porn and some people want

5498
02:56:54,930 --> 02:56:55,763
this.

5499
02:56:56,130 --> 02:56:58,350
We're two grown men.

5500
02:56:59,220 --> 02:57:01,680
Can we vote for whatever
just happened to be illegal.

5501
02:57:06,890 --> 02:57:09,050
That just took the sting
off of whoever wins.

5502
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:10,273
Yes.

5503
02:57:14,080 --> 02:57:14,700
No,

5504
02:57:14,700 --> 02:57:15,533
this thing,

5505
02:57:17,940 --> 02:57:19,220
nobody's Java.

5506
02:57:22,360 --> 02:57:23,193
MMM.

5507
02:57:24,230 --> 02:57:27,350
Have to leave to go next
door and tell jokes.

5508
02:57:27,710 --> 02:57:28,670
Going to have the room.

5509
02:57:28,810 --> 02:57:29,643
Okay.

5510
02:57:30,380 --> 02:57:31,213
All right.

5511
02:57:32,280 --> 02:57:34,050
His mother fuckers going to run on.

5512
02:57:34,370 --> 02:57:35,040
We're not done.

5513
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:35,450
I know.

5514
02:57:35,450 --> 02:57:36,560
At least get Doug back

5515
02:57:38,570 --> 02:57:39,560
the night is young.

5516
02:57:46,890 --> 02:57:50,040
Hey Russell Peters making
American great again.

5517
02:57:51,140 --> 02:57:56,140
She's Canada and Saudi Arabia
and making sure ran great again.

5518
02:57:57,860 --> 02:57:59,640
This is all still making
the Philippines great.

5519
02:57:59,641 --> 02:58:00,540
I guess Peter,

5520
02:58:00,541 --> 02:58:01,140
sorry.

5521
02:58:01,140 --> 02:58:01,591
He told me.

5522
02:58:01,591 --> 02:58:02,640
Russell Simmons.

5523
02:58:04,820 --> 02:58:06,590
Good to ask.

5524
02:58:07,820 --> 02:58:10,610
Ladies and gentlemen to the
ambassador of the world.

5525
02:58:10,611 --> 02:58:11,570
Russell Peters.

5526
02:58:19,380 --> 02:58:19,980
Joe.

5527
02:58:19,980 --> 02:58:20,161
No,

5528
02:58:20,161 --> 02:58:20,311
no.

5529
02:58:20,311 --> 02:58:20,971
He's coming back.

5530
02:58:20,971 --> 02:58:21,210
He's,

5531
02:58:21,210 --> 02:58:21,790
he's going to go,

5532
02:58:21,790 --> 02:58:22,623
dude.

5533
02:58:23,560 --> 02:58:24,330
All right.

5534
02:58:24,330 --> 02:58:25,163
I really,

5535
02:58:25,230 --> 02:58:26,063
what's going on?

5536
02:58:26,370 --> 02:58:26,580
Never.

5537
02:58:26,580 --> 02:58:27,121
Michigan,

5538
02:58:27,121 --> 02:58:28,460
New Hampshire settlement.

5539
02:58:28,550 --> 02:58:29,211
Pennsylvania.

5540
02:58:29,211 --> 02:58:31,220
Wisconsin is still too close to call.

5541
02:58:31,400 --> 02:58:35,840
I'm so sick of fucking saying
that you had how New Hampshire.

5542
02:58:35,841 --> 02:58:38,180
It's like fucking one 10 in the morning.

5543
02:58:38,600 --> 02:58:39,140
These guys,

5544
02:58:39,140 --> 02:58:40,670
these guys are in these guys,

5545
02:58:40,671 --> 02:58:41,031
by the way,

5546
02:58:41,031 --> 02:58:42,830
on CNN are in great shape.

5547
02:58:42,831 --> 02:58:43,041
I'm like,

5548
02:58:43,041 --> 02:58:44,870
what is this teen Wolf Blitzer?

5549
02:58:44,990 --> 02:58:46,340
Bill who got Michigan,

5550
02:58:46,550 --> 02:58:47,480
who got Michigan.

5551
02:58:48,170 --> 02:58:48,880
You shoe her.

5552
02:58:48,880 --> 02:58:49,713
Anyone?

5553
02:58:50,460 --> 02:58:51,830
We don't know what it is right now.

5554
02:58:52,330 --> 02:58:53,690
I don't know who got Michigan.

5555
02:58:55,280 --> 02:58:55,440
No,

5556
02:58:55,440 --> 02:58:55,621
no.

5557
02:58:55,621 --> 02:58:56,454
It's all

5558
02:58:57,510 --> 02:58:58,440
rock up Michigan.

5559
02:59:00,040 --> 02:59:00,873
Doug,

5560
02:59:01,050 --> 02:59:01,883
sit right here.

5561
02:59:02,380 --> 02:59:02,940
Lean Sarah.

5562
02:59:02,940 --> 02:59:04,290
Good a talk on the same one.

5563
02:59:06,170 --> 02:59:08,630
You guys look like a couple
that wore the same outfit.

5564
02:59:08,660 --> 02:59:09,493
That's what that looks like.

5565
02:59:09,620 --> 02:59:09,930
Hey.

5566
02:59:09,930 --> 02:59:11,240
Hey Russell in Canada.

5567
02:59:11,241 --> 02:59:11,660
How you,

5568
02:59:11,660 --> 02:59:13,940
how do you pick your group of
elders that run your country?

5569
02:59:13,980 --> 02:59:14,813
Um,

5570
02:59:15,340 --> 02:59:18,680
a democratically big go.

5571
02:59:18,790 --> 02:59:20,510
We don't have fucking teams over there.

5572
02:59:20,511 --> 02:59:21,191
There's no like,

5573
02:59:21,191 --> 02:59:21,471
oh,

5574
02:59:21,471 --> 02:59:22,190
wear this.

5575
02:59:22,190 --> 02:59:22,761
You're that.

5576
02:59:22,761 --> 02:59:23,421
It's just like,

5577
02:59:23,421 --> 02:59:23,601
hey,

5578
02:59:23,601 --> 02:59:24,830
that seems like the right guy.

5579
02:59:25,670 --> 02:59:30,080
Why do you guys always try to act
like Canada is like devoid of racism?

5580
02:59:30,140 --> 02:59:30,450
Oh No,

5581
02:59:30,450 --> 02:59:33,650
it's really then just with the whole,

5582
02:59:33,651 --> 02:59:36,050
we just go to pick the guy
who's writing what we do.

5583
02:59:36,260 --> 02:59:37,480
I know we all have paper.

5584
02:59:38,230 --> 02:59:39,063
Sorry

5585
02:59:41,700 --> 02:59:42,533
Christ.

5586
02:59:43,530 --> 02:59:45,480
You guys are fucking
the same animals we are.

5587
02:59:45,800 --> 02:59:47,250
It's like cubs fans.

5588
02:59:47,430 --> 02:59:48,900
The way they try to make them seem like,

5589
02:59:48,901 --> 02:59:49,471
oh yeah,

5590
02:59:49,471 --> 02:59:49,711
you know,

5591
02:59:49,711 --> 02:59:51,960
let's play two and who knows
if we're going to fucking win.

5592
02:59:52,170 --> 02:59:55,380
And then Steve Bartman goes to
catch that fucking ball height.

5593
02:59:55,440 --> 02:59:56,041
Is that his name?

5594
02:59:56,041 --> 02:59:56,520
Bartman,

5595
02:59:56,520 --> 02:59:57,270
whatever.

5596
02:59:57,270 --> 02:59:58,710
They fucking ruined his life.

5597
02:59:59,100 --> 03:00:02,370
They're the same animals that vote for
the red sox to Phillies in the Yankees.

5598
03:00:02,371 --> 03:00:03,204
Go Fuck Yourself.

5599
03:00:07,340 --> 03:00:08,280
Let's getting political.

5600
03:00:08,310 --> 03:00:09,300
What have a lot of people,

5601
03:00:09,301 --> 03:00:11,730
why are there to really
hold for Russell Simmons?

5602
03:00:14,020 --> 03:00:14,750
I love it.

5603
03:00:14,750 --> 03:00:15,583
Canada.

5604
03:00:16,480 --> 03:00:17,540
I have a great time up there.

5605
03:00:17,930 --> 03:00:19,670
You know Hitler's cars in Ottawa.

5606
03:00:19,820 --> 03:00:20,653
If you ever want to see

5607
03:00:22,070 --> 03:00:23,540
his parade car,

5608
03:00:23,541 --> 03:00:24,860
the one where he could fucking stand.

5609
03:00:24,861 --> 03:00:25,461
It was so weird.

5610
03:00:25,461 --> 03:00:26,900
It was like a bulletproof car,

5611
03:00:27,110 --> 03:00:31,790
but it also was a convertible cause he
was afraid someone's going to shoot him.

5612
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,040
But he also knew if he
came out in a great whip,

5613
03:00:34,370 --> 03:00:38,390
like you'd get all that extra
fucking pussy afterwards.

5614
03:00:38,391 --> 03:00:38,900
Yeah.

5615
03:00:38,900 --> 03:00:41,240
He liked cars and he was in a woman.

5616
03:00:42,690 --> 03:00:44,180
Does that doesn't mean you,

5617
03:00:44,540 --> 03:00:44,811
you,

5618
03:00:44,811 --> 03:00:45,051
your,

5619
03:00:45,051 --> 03:00:45,561
your pro.

5620
03:00:45,561 --> 03:00:48,620
What he did the way you
guys just pulled back.

5621
03:00:48,621 --> 03:00:51,910
I'm just saying that one of the,

5622
03:00:52,190 --> 03:00:55,310
one of the biggest monsters
of all time when he was alive,

5623
03:00:55,311 --> 03:00:57,170
cars existed and he bought one

5624
03:01:00,810 --> 03:01:02,380
and if you want to go look at it,

5625
03:01:02,381 --> 03:01:02,801
you're like,

5626
03:01:02,801 --> 03:01:03,370
wow.

5627
03:01:03,370 --> 03:01:07,060
One of the most evil dudes
ever there was sat right there.

5628
03:01:07,061 --> 03:01:11,800
All the original leather seats folded up
and he could fucking wave to people or

5629
03:01:11,801 --> 03:01:12,730
whatever the fuck it is.

5630
03:01:12,731 --> 03:01:13,780
He deal in Vegas.

5631
03:01:13,781 --> 03:01:18,490
There was a casino owned by a guy that
loved Hitler and he had all the cards in

5632
03:01:18,491 --> 03:01:21,810
the back and he tried to make uh,

5633
03:01:22,340 --> 03:01:22,710
uh,

5634
03:01:22,710 --> 03:01:23,710
four 20 and two,

5635
03:01:23,711 --> 03:01:26,490
a Hitler birthday party at his function.

5636
03:01:26,770 --> 03:01:31,170
His casino and they threatened to
take away is his absolutely license,

5637
03:01:31,390 --> 03:01:32,980
but he had all the cars in the back.

5638
03:01:33,700 --> 03:01:37,180
There's another hit look car
down in fucking Long Beach,

5639
03:01:37,930 --> 03:01:40,000
right outside at John Wayne Airport,

5640
03:01:40,470 --> 03:01:41,260
tuning in.

5641
03:01:41,260 --> 03:01:45,210
Welcome to the brand new Hitler car
podcast live from the comedy store.

5642
03:01:50,990 --> 03:01:54,310
There's some Mercedes that
they have who was chairman,

5643
03:01:54,400 --> 03:01:54,921

5644
03:01:54,921 --> 03:01:55,390

5645
03:01:55,390 --> 03:01:57,070

5647
03:02:00,461 --> 03:02:01,294
I'm drunk.

5648
03:02:04,690 --> 03:02:05,800
That's why we're here.

5649
03:02:06,100 --> 03:02:08,530
What kind of casino
games were at the Hitler?

5650
03:02:08,531 --> 03:02:09,364
Because Tina,

5651
03:02:09,770 --> 03:02:11,370

5652
03:02:11,450 --> 03:02:13,810
You like to put it on black or Bjork?

5653
03:02:17,060 --> 03:02:18,770
I should leave right fucking now,

5654
03:02:20,690 --> 03:02:21,170
man.

5655
03:02:21,170 --> 03:02:22,100
That was amazing.

5656
03:02:22,101 --> 03:02:22,934
Shirts.

5657
03:02:23,560 --> 03:02:24,680
Shirts off to you.

5658
03:02:25,960 --> 03:02:26,720
Great.

5659
03:02:26,720 --> 03:02:29,030
Spliff Hinchcliffe Europe again,

5660
03:02:29,031 --> 03:02:29,930
New Hampshire.

5661
03:02:30,030 --> 03:02:35,030
Pennsylvania was constant still for
whatever fucking reason too close to call.

5662
03:02:35,391 --> 03:02:39,890
What the fuck man in the corner does she
have to win all those to have a chance.

5663
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:40,521
Hey Bill,

5664
03:02:40,521 --> 03:02:41,354
you have to go.

5665
03:02:41,360 --> 03:02:42,193
It's to

5666
03:02:45,190 --> 03:02:47,600
Pennsylvania is a big one.

5667
03:02:48,140 --> 03:02:49,100
He doesn't listen to me.

5668
03:02:49,520 --> 03:02:50,353
You're

5669
03:02:51,620 --> 03:02:53,210
so just lie.

5670
03:02:53,850 --> 03:02:55,550
Just already good.

5671
03:02:55,670 --> 03:02:56,720
I said Trump won.

5672
03:02:56,721 --> 03:02:59,240
They fall down fucker with Google back.

5673
03:02:59,241 --> 03:03:00,890
There's fact checking us.

5674
03:03:01,070 --> 03:03:01,340
Hey,

5675
03:03:01,340 --> 03:03:02,810
this just in south park.

5676
03:03:02,811 --> 03:03:05,180
Just one Colorado solidarity.

5677
03:03:07,450 --> 03:03:07,790
All right.

5678
03:03:07,790 --> 03:03:08,800
Now back to uh,

5679
03:03:08,870 --> 03:03:09,703
Hinchcliffe.

5680
03:03:09,980 --> 03:03:10,640
Now you're,

5681
03:03:10,640 --> 03:03:10,911

5682
03:03:10,911 --> 03:03:11,550

5683
03:03:11,550 --> 03:03:12,020
uh,

5684
03:03:12,020 --> 03:03:14,270
a gay man at your tone.

5685
03:03:17,810 --> 03:03:22,340
You're sitting next to dad dress like
the $6 million man without the muscles.

5686
03:03:25,810 --> 03:03:29,440
It's Kinda like that to
show you my tax returns.

5687
03:03:29,441 --> 03:03:30,191
6 million.

5688
03:03:30,191 --> 03:03:31,024
Come on.

5689
03:03:31,690 --> 03:03:33,070
It's a Trump reference.

5690
03:03:33,071 --> 03:03:33,311
All right.

5691
03:03:33,311 --> 03:03:34,144
Fuck you guys.

5692
03:03:34,200 --> 03:03:34,630
Hey.

5693
03:03:34,630 --> 03:03:35,081
Hey Tony.

5694
03:03:35,081 --> 03:03:36,040
That was as good as mine.

5695
03:03:38,150 --> 03:03:39,820
That's not a good insult when you're like,

5696
03:03:39,821 --> 03:03:40,001
hey,

5697
03:03:40,001 --> 03:03:41,050
that was me earlier.

5698
03:03:41,051 --> 03:03:41,411
Come on.

5699
03:03:41,411 --> 03:03:42,070
Raffle.

5700
03:03:42,070 --> 03:03:42,903
Jesus.

5701
03:03:43,870 --> 03:03:44,703
Jesus.

5702
03:03:45,930 --> 03:03:46,211
Oh No,

5703
03:03:46,211 --> 03:03:51,211
I was going to say Pennsylvania's
48.7 to 47.8 for Trump.

5704
03:03:53,980 --> 03:03:58,980
Clinton is winning New
Hampshire 47.5 to 47.4 and up,

5705
03:04:00,221 --> 03:04:01,460
up by a content.

5706
03:04:02,750 --> 03:04:03,920
Got there.

5707
03:04:04,610 --> 03:04:06,560
We'll get to say that
again once he's president.

5708
03:04:09,580 --> 03:04:11,530
Do you think this is the happiest?

5709
03:04:11,620 --> 03:04:14,220
Scott Mayo has been in like 40 years.

5710
03:04:14,370 --> 03:04:15,720
He's definitely in charge,

5711
03:04:16,070 --> 03:04:16,960
man charge right now.

5712
03:04:17,010 --> 03:04:18,600
Scott bail takes way too much shit.

5713
03:04:18,601 --> 03:04:19,830
He's the fucking man.

5714
03:04:20,430 --> 03:04:23,330
He fucking handle p
handle being a child star.

5715
03:04:23,331 --> 03:04:24,810
We're running in the Charles and Charles.

5716
03:04:24,811 --> 03:04:28,680
He fuck some of the hottest ass out here
and he has political views that don't

5717
03:04:28,681 --> 03:04:29,990
agree with Hollywood couple of ways.

5718
03:04:30,870 --> 03:04:34,830
He's a foot Malveaux Hillary just I know
people that do the fucking New York guy

5719
03:04:35,070 --> 03:04:35,903
I like,

5720
03:04:36,830 --> 03:04:38,580
and I'm not saying I agree
with all of his politics,

5721
03:04:38,581 --> 03:04:38,871
but come on.

5722
03:04:38,871 --> 03:04:39,704
Is that Sydney is,

5723
03:04:39,740 --> 03:04:40,960
that's a funny joke.

5724
03:04:42,710 --> 03:04:44,060
I wasn't saying that,

5725
03:04:44,300 --> 03:04:47,840
but I honestly do think that he's
probably really excited right now and it's

5726
03:04:47,841 --> 03:04:49,010
probably the best day of his life.

5727
03:04:49,011 --> 03:04:50,300
And Los Cocktails.

5728
03:04:50,540 --> 03:04:51,110
Oh,

5729
03:04:51,110 --> 03:04:52,940
I think that people's a cocktail.

5730
03:04:53,150 --> 03:04:57,010
It's like everyone that used to be thought
we were all just fucking around more

5731
03:04:57,200 --> 03:04:58,040
is for Trump.

5732
03:04:58,430 --> 03:05:01,570
Like people who used to have a
career and don't anymore for doors.

5733
03:05:01,720 --> 03:05:03,230
Both Dwyer have a life.

5734
03:05:03,530 --> 03:05:04,760
I don't need more protection around it.

5735
03:05:04,761 --> 03:05:06,600
It's like if you used to have
something you don't anymore,

5736
03:05:06,620 --> 03:05:08,900
you're for Trump because
you think it's fucking,

5737
03:05:08,901 --> 03:05:10,450
I dunno the Jews' fault or something.

5738
03:05:10,730 --> 03:05:11,001
No,

5739
03:05:11,001 --> 03:05:11,181
no,

5740
03:05:11,181 --> 03:05:11,361
no,

5741
03:05:11,361 --> 03:05:11,930
no.

5742
03:05:11,930 --> 03:05:14,890
Just some of us would like to go
back to 1950 and Zooey was like,

5743
03:05:20,800 --> 03:05:21,840
Murphy was

5744
03:05:23,430 --> 03:05:24,010
arrested.

5745
03:05:24,010 --> 03:05:24,701
Socks on.

5746
03:05:24,701 --> 03:05:25,480
Huh?

5747
03:05:25,480 --> 03:05:26,920
That's Bono bull right there.

5748
03:05:26,921 --> 03:05:27,754
Huh?

5749
03:05:28,510 --> 03:05:30,650
I have a lot of shit.

5750
03:05:32,690 --> 03:05:33,523
Murphy's.

5751
03:05:35,230 --> 03:05:35,771
I don't,

5752
03:05:35,771 --> 03:05:40,771
I'm trying to do we say that as a joke
until give then you don't say it on a

5753
03:05:43,750 --> 03:05:44,800
night where you go.

5754
03:05:44,801 --> 03:05:45,041
No,

5755
03:05:45,041 --> 03:05:45,874
I'm kidding honey.

5756
03:05:46,150 --> 03:05:46,983
She's on the phone.

5757
03:05:48,260 --> 03:05:48,680
I'm trying,

5758
03:05:48,680 --> 03:05:49,513
I'm trying.

5759
03:05:51,770 --> 03:05:52,603
I have a lot of

5760
03:05:58,720 --> 03:05:59,553
the

5761
03:06:01,470 --> 03:06:02,680
long way around it

5762
03:06:04,790 --> 03:06:05,241
and by the way,

5763
03:06:05,241 --> 03:06:06,380
I'll throw my hat in that pool.

5764
03:06:06,381 --> 03:06:07,970
I have a crush on Morgan Murphy also.

5765
03:06:09,550 --> 03:06:10,410
Everybody's right.

5766
03:06:10,430 --> 03:06:12,410
Morgan Morgan Murphy.

5767
03:06:12,620 --> 03:06:13,850
She's incredibly smart,

5768
03:06:13,851 --> 03:06:14,684
great writer.

5769
03:06:14,750 --> 03:06:15,583
And um,

5770
03:06:15,880 --> 03:06:16,490
uh,

5771
03:06:16,490 --> 03:06:16,901
I listened.

5772
03:06:16,901 --> 03:06:19,910
This is going to be sound
saxes she has an amazing ass.

5773
03:06:19,940 --> 03:06:21,020
She's a great writer.

5774
03:06:21,230 --> 03:06:24,920
What an amazing ass and I just got
to put that out with all respect.

5775
03:06:25,070 --> 03:06:28,520
She's America's comedian and I'm not
just saying that because she's all red in

5776
03:06:28,521 --> 03:06:29,420
the middle as well.

5777
03:06:30,980 --> 03:06:31,341
Wow.

5778
03:06:31,341 --> 03:06:32,120
Come on.

5779
03:06:32,120 --> 03:06:32,361
Are We?

5780
03:06:32,361 --> 03:06:33,194
That

5781
03:06:34,930 --> 03:06:35,900
was a joke.

5782
03:06:36,110 --> 03:06:37,700
That was your bleeding asshole Tony.

5783
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:44,510
When Tony like you had aids 14 years ago.

5784
03:06:46,190 --> 03:06:48,520
I actually was cool.

5785
03:06:49,090 --> 03:06:51,030
Actually did when it was cool and he

5786
03:06:52,530 --> 03:06:57,530
was only on is Tony Aids and the old
school way and kindergarten in the bum and

5787
03:06:59,371 --> 03:07:00,204
the bum.

5788
03:07:03,240 --> 03:07:07,830
Why do you have to come and spread
that kind of filthy or Peter Morgan?

5789
03:07:09,880 --> 03:07:11,080
I was talking to my socks.

5790
03:07:11,110 --> 03:07:11,501
I like my,

5791
03:07:11,501 --> 03:07:14,590

basketball where my staff socks.

5792
03:07:14,920 --> 03:07:16,360
I got bill their beer tonight.

5793
03:07:16,361 --> 03:07:18,940
Who Do I have a Isaiah?

5794
03:07:19,390 --> 03:07:20,080
Isaiah.

5795
03:07:20,080 --> 03:07:20,291
Oh,

5796
03:07:20,291 --> 03:07:22,180
one time my housekeeper teamed up,

5797
03:07:22,330 --> 03:07:22,781
put a,

5798
03:07:22,781 --> 03:07:23,210
uh,

5799
03:07:23,210 --> 03:07:23,920
uh,

5800
03:07:23,920 --> 03:07:24,790
I have a housekeeper,

5801
03:07:25,310 --> 03:07:26,590
but what time she put a,

5802
03:07:26,591 --> 03:07:26,830

5803
03:07:26,830 --> 03:07:28,810
she put it Damian Lillard with a,

5804
03:07:29,050 --> 03:07:31,510
with a Drexler and I
thought she was racist.

5805
03:07:33,340 --> 03:07:34,173
You guys have this,

5806
03:07:34,190 --> 03:07:35,023
nevermind.

5807
03:07:36,250 --> 03:07:37,170
You guys have housekeeper.

5808
03:07:37,240 --> 03:07:37,810
Nevermind.

5809
03:07:37,810 --> 03:07:39,210
I shouldn't start talking about,

5810
03:07:39,220 --> 03:07:39,450

5811
03:07:39,450 --> 03:07:42,150

thing into the toilet.

5812
03:07:42,570 --> 03:07:46,350
I really fucking bud wiring my in my head.

5813
03:07:47,530 --> 03:07:52,440
But Dwyer from Pennsylvania
who coincidentally is
deciding the election here.

5814
03:07:53,220 --> 03:07:53,551
Well,

5815
03:07:53,551 --> 03:07:55,110
let's see what his vote is.

5816
03:07:55,470 --> 03:07:56,340
Nice shot,

5817
03:07:56,341 --> 03:07:57,174
man.

5818
03:08:00,420 --> 03:08:02,360
It's pretty much down to Pennsylvania.

5819
03:08:02,361 --> 03:08:02,720
Wow.

5820
03:08:02,720 --> 03:08:03,553
Where are we at?

5821
03:08:03,580 --> 03:08:06,420
The land of Sand Dusky is
deciding this election.

5822
03:08:06,800 --> 03:08:07,171
All right,

5823
03:08:07,171 --> 03:08:07,780
beautiful.

5824
03:08:07,780 --> 03:08:09,780
Here was my question originally.

5825
03:08:10,560 --> 03:08:15,250
I'm sitting with this fat dude and then
the I thought I should go shirtless

5826
03:08:15,260 --> 03:08:15,490
school.

5827
03:08:15,490 --> 03:08:17,130
He's not of fat,

5828
03:08:17,160 --> 03:08:17,993
but he's

5829
03:08:18,780 --> 03:08:22,740
but I.

5830
03:08:22,740 --> 03:08:22,830
Dot.

5831
03:08:22,830 --> 03:08:27,830
I'm too insecure at 143 pounds cause
it can't eat solid food recently,

5832
03:08:30,500 --> 03:08:35,500
but I'm still too insecure to
take off my shirt even beside him.

5833
03:08:36,350 --> 03:08:37,760
Take it off.

5834
03:08:37,940 --> 03:08:38,241
Oh No,

5835
03:08:38,241 --> 03:08:39,074
no.

5836
03:08:39,750 --> 03:08:40,110
Okay.

5837
03:08:40,110 --> 03:08:41,150
Kid Off.

5838
03:08:41,420 --> 03:08:42,253
Take

5839
03:08:43,690 --> 03:08:44,420
off.

5840
03:08:44,420 --> 03:08:45,560
Take it off.

5841
03:08:45,830 --> 03:08:49,040
I have tid herpes and it makes
me feel really creeped out.

5842
03:08:49,820 --> 03:08:50,490
What's going on.

5843
03:08:50,490 --> 03:08:51,680
Bill bill

5844
03:08:54,240 --> 03:08:59,030
is a leading handily in Wisconsin
even though it was too close to call.

5845
03:08:59,031 --> 03:09:03,260
He's up 49% to 45.8 at Pennsylvania.

5846
03:09:03,530 --> 03:09:05,210
Trump moved ahead.

5847
03:09:05,211 --> 03:09:10,211
48.7 it's 47.71 man in the corner
down on the night of his life.

5848
03:09:10,880 --> 03:09:14,420
I'm pretty sure that's Donald Trump by
the one man in Hollywood here tonight.

5849
03:09:14,900 --> 03:09:16,070
Bill New Hampshire,

5850
03:09:16,071 --> 03:09:20,260
47.5 Clinton 47.4 dude,

5851
03:09:20,280 --> 03:09:24,330
this is like woo too close
to the car bill with Irma.

5852
03:09:24,370 --> 03:09:27,770
Coming to then I think a lot of
liberals going to bed early though.

5853
03:09:28,460 --> 03:09:29,570
They go to bed early.

5854
03:09:29,660 --> 03:09:30,493
Dog Day.

5855
03:09:30,550 --> 03:09:30,840
Yeah.

5856
03:09:30,840 --> 03:09:33,360
So you have all the ducks in a
row and then they wake up late.

5857
03:09:33,361 --> 03:09:34,940
You're caring about other people.

5858
03:09:35,060 --> 03:09:38,480
I'm worried how late this is
that like the red go to bed late.

5859
03:09:38,490 --> 03:09:39,300
I

5860
03:09:39,300 --> 03:09:42,870
interrupted you right now cause I remember
as a young comic sometimes you'd try

5861
03:09:42,871 --> 03:09:45,330
to get pussy onstage or like,

5862
03:09:45,331 --> 03:09:45,631
hey,

5863
03:09:45,631 --> 03:09:46,590
who's go weed?

5864
03:09:46,610 --> 03:09:47,730
I want the drugs.

5865
03:09:48,090 --> 03:09:51,630
I really need to bucking gum
cause I can smell my own breath.

5866
03:09:52,320 --> 03:09:54,070
I could smell own stink.

5867
03:09:54,240 --> 03:09:55,540
Oh where I live,

5868
03:09:55,541 --> 03:09:57,790
front guy in the front row was gum gum.

5869
03:09:57,910 --> 03:09:59,050
It's fruit flavored dude.

5870
03:09:59,051 --> 03:10:00,850
What is technical and gum?

5871
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:01,833
That guy's good.

5872
03:10:01,900 --> 03:10:02,540
Right?

5873
03:10:02,540 --> 03:10:04,240
If you're going to try
to kill him with it,

5874
03:10:04,241 --> 03:10:04,960
that'd be great.

5875
03:10:04,960 --> 03:10:06,300
Eric is killing it tonight,

5876
03:10:06,301 --> 03:10:06,580
but I don't,

5877
03:10:06,580 --> 03:10:07,810
we never going to say another word.

5878
03:10:09,600 --> 03:10:10,433
Yeah.

5879
03:10:10,480 --> 03:10:11,313
Is that what you want?

5880
03:10:12,070 --> 03:10:14,080
Did you want orange amid?

5881
03:10:15,130 --> 03:10:15,850
Yeah,

5882
03:10:15,850 --> 03:10:17,890
it smells like you sucked
off the side of the freeway.

5883
03:10:17,891 --> 03:10:19,240
Adderall is a problem.

5884
03:10:19,440 --> 03:10:21,770
I got orange gum.

5885
03:10:22,850 --> 03:10:25,430
Looks like we've got ourselves
in a sticky situation.

5886
03:10:30,730 --> 03:10:31,563
Everyone.

5887
03:10:36,290 --> 03:10:38,580
We're never to just leave
to trying to get it.

5888
03:10:38,610 --> 03:10:38,821
No.

5889
03:10:38,821 --> 03:10:39,211
Burrs.

5890
03:10:39,211 --> 03:10:40,730
The only guy that stayed here

5891
03:10:41,060 --> 03:10:42,910
every second of this podcast.

5892
03:10:42,920 --> 03:10:43,753
Goddamn right.

5893
03:10:44,580 --> 03:10:45,413
Yeah.

5894
03:10:46,680 --> 03:10:47,361
What are the boats,

5895
03:10:47,361 --> 03:10:48,194
the pork

5896
03:10:50,870 --> 03:10:53,630
two 44 to 15 for fucking an hour.

5897
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:55,940
44 to 54 an hour.

5898
03:10:56,050 --> 03:10:58,360
You're just trying to figure out
a way to get her from the Lexus

5899
03:10:58,640 --> 03:11:02,210
piece of shit froze
again till early to call.

5900
03:11:02,220 --> 03:11:02,411
Hey,

5901
03:11:02,411 --> 03:11:02,870
fuck that.

5902
03:11:02,870 --> 03:11:05,330
How about this whole God damn time.

5903
03:11:05,480 --> 03:11:05,841
Come on.

5904
03:11:05,841 --> 03:11:07,040
You guys been hanging in there,

5905
03:11:07,730 --> 03:11:08,600
hanging in there.

5906
03:11:09,710 --> 03:11:09,981
Oh,

5907
03:11:09,981 --> 03:11:10,814
they're dying.

5908
03:11:11,580 --> 03:11:12,230
Gaul.

5909
03:11:12,230 --> 03:11:14,810
I purposely told Chad Shank,

5910
03:11:15,290 --> 03:11:16,120
listen,

5911
03:11:16,120 --> 03:11:17,450
fuck the audience.

5912
03:11:17,451 --> 03:11:18,021
We're going to do.

5913
03:11:18,021 --> 03:11:18,854
This.

5914
03:11:19,040 --> 03:11:21,560
Rogan was legitimately concerned.

5915
03:11:21,740 --> 03:11:21,951
Well,

5916
03:11:21,951 --> 03:11:23,080
we're going to overtalk.

5917
03:11:23,090 --> 03:11:26,180
Everyone's going to go for the
punchline if we do a live thing,

5918
03:11:27,170 --> 03:11:28,003
but no.

5919
03:11:29,120 --> 03:11:29,953
Yeah,

5920
03:11:30,220 --> 03:11:33,770
he basically said exactly what was
going to happen was going to happen.

5921
03:11:33,800 --> 03:11:34,633
Oh

5922
03:11:35,270 --> 03:11:35,450
wait,

5923
03:11:35,450 --> 03:11:35,580
wait,

5924
03:11:35,580 --> 03:11:35,791
wait.

5925
03:11:35,791 --> 03:11:37,740
Did you guys think this
was going to happen?

5926
03:11:37,741 --> 03:11:40,500
Do you guys think this was going to be
the result or did you think you'd be like

5927
03:11:40,501 --> 03:11:42,000
kind of half celebrated,

5928
03:11:42,001 --> 03:11:42,541
half going,

5929
03:11:42,541 --> 03:11:42,811
okay,

5930
03:11:42,811 --> 03:11:43,561
it'll be fine,

5931
03:11:43,561 --> 03:11:45,000
but we can make fun of what's going on.

5932
03:11:45,001 --> 03:11:45,880
But now it's a fucking,

5933
03:11:45,881 --> 03:11:46,380
yeah,

5934
03:11:46,380 --> 03:11:46,621
no,

5935
03:11:46,621 --> 03:11:46,801
no.

5936
03:11:46,801 --> 03:11:50,370
The what part of the reason Doug wanted
to cancel it because he figured Hilary

5937
03:11:50,371 --> 03:11:51,204
was gonna win.

5938
03:11:51,420 --> 03:11:51,871
And he was like,

5939
03:11:51,871 --> 03:11:52,060
yeah,

5940
03:11:52,060 --> 03:11:52,870
fuck it.

5941
03:11:52,870 --> 03:11:53,170
No,

5942
03:11:53,170 --> 03:11:57,860
that was the excuse I gave Rogan when
I was begging him to make me get,

5943
03:11:58,230 --> 03:11:59,940
please don't make me do this.

5944
03:12:00,720 --> 03:12:02,280
And then my life got worse.

5945
03:12:02,340 --> 03:12:02,411
Oh,

5946
03:12:02,411 --> 03:12:03,091
I gotta be honest with you.

5947
03:12:03,091 --> 03:12:04,650
I thought if we were starting at seven,

5948
03:12:04,651 --> 03:12:05,670
I thought it was going to be over.

5949
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:08,940
I just thought everyone was going to vote
for Hillary because she was more than

5950
03:12:08,941 --> 03:12:09,391
made guy.

5951
03:12:09,391 --> 03:12:10,590
He was a reality show star.

5952
03:12:10,920 --> 03:12:12,450
And then I was like
halfway through I was like,

5953
03:12:12,451 --> 03:12:13,200
Oh shit,

5954
03:12:13,200 --> 03:12:14,640
this is going to be a good podcast.

5955
03:12:14,641 --> 03:12:15,474
It's still going.

5956
03:12:15,600 --> 03:12:17,850
And then somewhere halfway
through that I was like,

5957
03:12:17,851 --> 03:12:18,481
oh my God,

5958
03:12:18,481 --> 03:12:19,680
this guy might be president.

5959
03:12:21,090 --> 03:12:22,460
This is fucking terrifying.

5960
03:12:22,780 --> 03:12:24,940
You and I know you knew it was hilarious.

5961
03:12:24,941 --> 03:12:28,410
Still about 6:59 PM and
ever since then I'm like,

5962
03:12:28,411 --> 03:12:29,121
wait a minute,

5963
03:12:29,121 --> 03:12:29,954
this is,

5964
03:12:30,120 --> 03:12:31,470
this is fucking crazy.

5965
03:12:32,150 --> 03:12:32,330
Hey,

5966
03:12:32,330 --> 03:12:34,350
it's Sophie the waitress around here.

5967
03:12:34,351 --> 03:12:35,340
Cause she come to the stage,

5968
03:12:35,670 --> 03:12:36,503
the stage,

5969
03:12:36,570 --> 03:12:41,250
well actually let's
stop the podcast or no,

5970
03:12:41,251 --> 03:12:41,461
no,

5971
03:12:41,461 --> 03:12:43,590
I'm going to tell Sophie
comes to the stage.

5972
03:12:44,400 --> 03:12:45,930
This seems very importantly,

5973
03:12:46,740 --> 03:12:47,431
oh no,

5974
03:12:47,431 --> 03:12:48,720
it's Sophie related.

5975
03:12:50,950 --> 03:12:52,070
I think under Trump

5976
03:12:52,080 --> 03:12:54,510
you can just guess any woman to
get you a drink and they have,

5977
03:12:57,060 --> 03:12:58,040
that's the new rule.

5978
03:12:59,120 --> 03:13:01,310
I don't get these guys offended
by the grabbing and the post.

5979
03:13:01,311 --> 03:13:02,144
These stuff.

5980
03:13:02,280 --> 03:13:03,001
What are they picking up?

5981
03:13:03,001 --> 03:13:04,260
Bowling balls with two hands.

5982
03:13:05,040 --> 03:13:06,540
Fucking business.

5983
03:13:06,680 --> 03:13:08,900
You do jokes and just jabber,

5984
03:13:09,850 --> 03:13:10,683
but did you

5985
03:13:12,370 --> 03:13:12,731
get it?

5986
03:13:12,731 --> 03:13:13,241
It's not,

5987
03:13:13,241 --> 03:13:13,960
it's not an,

5988
03:13:13,960 --> 03:13:14,351
I don't,

5989
03:13:14,351 --> 03:13:14,951
I feel like,

5990
03:13:14,951 --> 03:13:15,700
I feel like,

5991
03:13:15,700 --> 03:13:16,533
oh hi.

5992
03:13:17,220 --> 03:13:18,053
Can you just talk?

5993
03:13:18,700 --> 03:13:20,450
I heard though that a lot of the Poles,

5994
03:13:20,600 --> 03:13:23,260
like we all thought that it
wasn't those on that other phone.

5995
03:13:25,060 --> 03:13:25,801
Phone is Morgan.

5996
03:13:25,801 --> 03:13:26,634
What were you gonna say?

5997
03:13:26,780 --> 03:13:27,020
No,

5998
03:13:27,020 --> 03:13:27,690
I think it's,

5999
03:13:27,690 --> 03:13:28,220
it's,

6000
03:13:28,220 --> 03:13:30,020
I feel like there was a,

6001
03:13:30,030 --> 03:13:30,620
a,

6002
03:13:30,620 --> 03:13:35,620
a national besides Judaism and sexism
that exists and I'm very upset about it.

6003
03:13:38,510 --> 03:13:39,343
Hang on,

6004
03:13:39,650 --> 03:13:41,210
let me put bill burrs,

6005
03:13:41,211 --> 03:13:42,710
golf ball on his feet.

6006
03:13:43,130 --> 03:13:43,963
Please.

6007
03:13:44,750 --> 03:13:45,111
Ready?

6008
03:13:45,111 --> 03:13:47,450
I'm ready to fucking talk

6009
03:13:51,310 --> 03:13:52,143
to

6010
03:13:53,180 --> 03:13:56,150
two felonies she got accused
of that somehow disappeared.

6011
03:13:56,300 --> 03:13:57,440
But if I had one of those,

6012
03:13:57,441 --> 03:13:59,360
I'd be hanging out with snowed in Russia.

6013
03:14:01,990 --> 03:14:02,823
Morgan,

6014
03:14:02,990 --> 03:14:03,410
you know,

6015
03:14:03,410 --> 03:14:06,710
I have to be honest with you that the
Democrats did pick the wrong person

6016
03:14:06,711 --> 03:14:08,450
because they've done so much shit.

6017
03:14:08,900 --> 03:14:09,591
They really are.

6018
03:14:09,591 --> 03:14:10,910
The Democrats Bushes.

6019
03:14:11,090 --> 03:14:12,530
They've done so much fucking shit.

6020
03:14:12,531 --> 03:14:13,880
They had a lot of fucking emoney.

6021
03:14:13,930 --> 03:14:14,540
Anime say,

6022
03:14:14,540 --> 03:14:15,500
Hey,

6023
03:14:15,590 --> 03:14:17,630
not you're saying the Republicans
pick the right person,

6024
03:14:17,631 --> 03:14:18,650
which is one of the most,

6025
03:14:18,680 --> 03:14:19,700
that's not what I'm saying.

6026
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:21,160
You're putting those words in my mouth.

6027
03:14:21,890 --> 03:14:22,970
Well then stop doing that.

6028
03:14:23,900 --> 03:14:24,733
Hey listen,

6029
03:14:24,860 --> 03:14:26,390
you guys get heated.

6030
03:14:26,420 --> 03:14:29,480
If at any point it gets a little
too touchy for the people.

6031
03:14:29,660 --> 03:14:31,540
I'll go with licking his tit.

6032
03:14:31,710 --> 03:14:32,150
Yeah,

6033
03:14:32,150 --> 03:14:33,390
and we'll just get her damage.

6034
03:14:33,430 --> 03:14:34,263
Laughs.

6035
03:14:35,240 --> 03:14:37,400
I can't have an argument
because I'm not that smart.

6036
03:14:37,401 --> 03:14:38,390
I'm just sad

6037
03:14:40,380 --> 03:14:41,213
you're saying what?

6038
03:14:41,280 --> 03:14:42,113
Go ahead.

6039
03:14:42,800 --> 03:14:43,020
No,

6040
03:14:43,020 --> 03:14:44,820
make a salient point.

6041
03:14:44,850 --> 03:14:46,290
If it gets uncomfortable.

6042
03:14:46,590 --> 03:14:47,460
It's right here.

6043
03:14:47,550 --> 03:14:48,530
I think he's been Borgen.

6044
03:14:48,531 --> 03:14:49,364
I think

6045
03:14:49,690 --> 03:14:51,820
make a good point and they're
going to watch this again.

6046
03:14:53,220 --> 03:14:55,600
Here it comes to qualified
person and you go,

6047
03:14:55,601 --> 03:14:55,841
okay,

6048
03:14:55,841 --> 03:14:56,790
why didn't she make it go?

6049
03:14:56,800 --> 03:14:59,090
There's clearly people in
this country who are raises,

6050
03:14:59,140 --> 03:15:01,210
who are misogynistic or homophobic,

6051
03:15:01,230 --> 03:15:02,860
who are Zena phobic?

6052
03:15:02,890 --> 03:15:04,690
How can you just blow off all of those?

6053
03:15:04,691 --> 03:15:07,060
Like like how many felonies
do you have to be accused of

6054
03:15:08,590 --> 03:15:09,760
things as well?

6055
03:15:09,761 --> 03:15:11,140
I'm not saying he's a good guy.

6056
03:15:11,300 --> 03:15:11,520
Well,

6057
03:15:11,520 --> 03:15:14,740
I'm just saying that you can't literally
just say the reason why you're not

6058
03:15:14,741 --> 03:15:19,300
voting for Clinton is because you're
a misogynist is actually sexist shit.

6059
03:15:19,450 --> 03:15:21,050
She's almost people who voted for him.

6060
03:15:22,250 --> 03:15:23,083
It is.

6061
03:15:23,360 --> 03:15:24,410
It's like you're saying.

6062
03:15:25,250 --> 03:15:25,501
Yeah,

6063
03:15:25,501 --> 03:15:25,870
it's okay.

6064
03:15:25,870 --> 03:15:26,021
No,

6065
03:15:26,021 --> 03:15:29,200
I don't believe that all the people voted
for Trump are smart enough to assess

6066
03:15:29,201 --> 03:15:30,520
every wrong doing that.

6067
03:15:30,521 --> 03:15:31,990
They think Clinton that I did.

6068
03:15:31,991 --> 03:15:32,770
I think that they,

6069
03:15:32,770 --> 03:15:34,360
I think that's cause you live out here.

6070
03:15:34,630 --> 03:15:35,051
Sure.

6071
03:15:35,051 --> 03:15:38,650
I live in a bubble because you live out
here and you think everybody who doesn't

6072
03:15:38,651 --> 03:15:41,320
live near an ocean is a dope bill bill.

6073
03:15:41,410 --> 03:15:42,011
Oh Shit.

6074
03:15:42,011 --> 03:15:42,041
Yeah.

6075
03:15:42,041 --> 03:15:42,500
Walsh

6076
03:15:42,500 --> 03:15:43,151
is drawn away.

6077
03:15:43,151 --> 03:15:43,984
By the way.

6078
03:15:44,240 --> 03:15:47,980
Would it be to be in the
middle of a breakup and have
bill burr walk in the door

6079
03:15:47,981 --> 03:15:48,460
and go,

6080
03:15:48,460 --> 03:15:49,293
I'll take it from,

6081
03:15:53,670 --> 03:15:53,911
no,

6082
03:15:53,911 --> 03:15:58,911
I'm just saying that people out here have
a fucking Tennessee to call 90% of the

6083
03:16:00,421 --> 03:16:04,350
state's flyover states and think that
there were a bunch of fucking morons and

6084
03:16:04,351 --> 03:16:08,070
then have the nerve to fucking trash Fox
News where you guys are the exact same

6085
03:16:08,071 --> 03:16:10,310
fucking people all the way to
the left and it's annoying.

6086
03:16:10,350 --> 03:16:11,550
Absolutely is annoying.

6087
03:16:12,270 --> 03:16:12,781
It's annoying.

6088
03:16:12,781 --> 03:16:13,561
He's got you there.

6089
03:16:13,561 --> 03:16:17,070
It's a total fucking understand
the reason behind him.

6090
03:16:17,100 --> 03:16:19,390
But you're literally saying that
the reason why she's not winning,

6091
03:16:19,391 --> 03:16:19,621
he says,

6092
03:16:19,621 --> 03:16:23,070
because people are sexist
and you're ignoring all of
this other shit and they're

6093
03:16:23,071 --> 03:16:28,071
racist and there beside you this take
and they're homophobic and they're 100%

6094
03:16:29,420 --> 03:16:29,830
that's it.

6095
03:16:29,830 --> 03:16:31,020
I think that said,

6096
03:16:31,040 --> 03:16:31,660
Lily.

6097
03:16:31,660 --> 03:16:33,000
Say you're telling me,

6098
03:16:33,180 --> 03:16:36,090
you're telling me the full
Obama ran against Trump.

6099
03:16:36,091 --> 03:16:38,070
This would even been a fucking race.

6100
03:16:38,160 --> 03:16:38,850
No.

6101
03:16:38,850 --> 03:16:39,230
Well,

6102
03:16:39,230 --> 03:16:41,220
I write faster than the

6103
03:16:43,950 --> 03:16:45,810
Obama was squeaky fucking clean.

6104
03:16:47,040 --> 03:16:49,620
Moderator has a question for Bill Berg.

6105
03:16:52,890 --> 03:16:53,520
Morgan,

6106
03:16:53,520 --> 03:16:58,520
what about all the stuff that Bill Clinton
was accused of that you know all the

6107
03:17:00,870 --> 03:17:01,020
Lolita Express,

6108
03:17:01,020 --> 03:17:05,490
all the women that came out are
Hillary basically fucking shaming them.

6109
03:17:05,491 --> 03:17:08,250
Like why is that not an issue to that?

6110
03:17:08,251 --> 03:17:09,960
The person who was like,

6111
03:17:09,961 --> 03:17:12,270
everything that's a Trump is accused of,

6112
03:17:12,600 --> 03:17:14,490
no one cares cares.

6113
03:17:14,580 --> 03:17:17,090
Bill Clinton paid one
question and you know,

6114
03:17:17,091 --> 03:17:18,060
official office,

6115
03:17:18,061 --> 03:17:19,140
it's the same thing.

6116
03:17:19,141 --> 03:17:21,870
I don't want to say why
we compartmentalize it.

6117
03:17:22,250 --> 03:17:23,300
W W gymnasts.

6118
03:17:23,610 --> 03:17:24,443
I respect you.

6119
03:17:24,540 --> 03:17:26,520
I just walked from his actual words.

6120
03:17:26,521 --> 03:17:28,140
I'll just give you just one question.

6121
03:17:28,410 --> 03:17:29,120
Okay.

6122
03:17:29,120 --> 03:17:30,280
This city rapists.

6123
03:17:30,300 --> 03:17:33,650
I can't vote for somebody who's
calling like an entire gender pigs.

6124
03:17:33,860 --> 03:17:34,730
I'm not going to do it.

6125
03:17:35,680 --> 03:17:37,390
Why are you voting for someone?

6126
03:17:37,391 --> 03:17:38,650
Why do you need a leader?

6127
03:17:39,330 --> 03:17:39,611
All right.

6128
03:17:39,611 --> 03:17:44,611
Just one question and I'm asking bill
because I want your opinion bill.

6129
03:17:46,180 --> 03:17:47,013
What?

6130
03:17:48,100 --> 03:17:52,980
I hate both of the massage and the
racist fucking hate both of them tired.

6131
03:17:52,980 --> 03:17:55,390
This is like the first
week of American idol.

6132
03:17:55,510 --> 03:17:56,590
Fuck no,

6133
03:17:56,591 --> 03:17:57,700
I hate Trump.

6134
03:17:57,701 --> 03:17:59,260
There's no doubt that Trump's an asshole,

6135
03:17:59,261 --> 03:18:03,460
but I'm wondering really applies what
Bill Clinton just seemed like nothing when

6136
03:18:03,461 --> 03:18:08,461
Trump just to get fused of something
that the charges were dropped and then we

6137
03:18:09,491 --> 03:18:13,990
found out that the Gloria alternate paid
off these bitches that come forward and

6138
03:18:13,991 --> 03:18:15,610
say all this shit and you're like,

6139
03:18:15,611 --> 03:18:16,444
fuck man,

6140
03:18:16,510 --> 03:18:17,710
this is some weird shit.

6141
03:18:17,740 --> 03:18:21,820
But yet there is actual proof that
are not going to Bill Clinton got on a

6142
03:18:21,821 --> 03:18:24,550
fucking flight and when fuck teenagers.

6143
03:18:24,580 --> 03:18:24,971
You know what?

6144
03:18:24,971 --> 03:18:25,750
It's just like,

6145
03:18:25,750 --> 03:18:26,430
why do we,

6146
03:18:26,430 --> 03:18:27,520
I love you.

6147
03:18:27,521 --> 03:18:28,420
I'm not being nasty,

6148
03:18:28,430 --> 03:18:29,263
but why do we,

6149
03:18:29,940 --> 03:18:31,810
is anybody watching Westworld?

6150
03:18:32,850 --> 03:18:34,780
How great a fucking show is sad.

6151
03:18:34,781 --> 03:18:35,460
Huh?

6152
03:18:35,460 --> 03:18:36,700
Suck in your test.

6153
03:18:37,460 --> 03:18:40,360
Atlanta has a great TV out there.

6154
03:18:40,361 --> 03:18:44,260
Everybody understand why we're
talking about Dell Clinton?

6155
03:18:44,280 --> 03:18:46,140
It's got to cool it off
every once in a while.

6156
03:18:46,150 --> 03:18:47,590
We talking about Clinton.

6157
03:18:47,591 --> 03:18:47,771
Yeah.

6158
03:18:47,771 --> 03:18:48,100
Why

6159
03:18:48,100 --> 03:18:49,030
are we talking about?

6160
03:18:49,031 --> 03:18:50,500
Because she co's signed,

6161
03:18:50,510 --> 03:18:51,500
done all of them.

6162
03:18:54,220 --> 03:18:55,810
The plumber crack is the most

6163
03:18:56,030 --> 03:18:57,320
Durbin parts of the whole thing.

6164
03:18:57,440 --> 03:18:58,273
Listen,

6165
03:18:59,170 --> 03:19:00,003
be here.

6166
03:19:00,110 --> 03:19:01,880
We shouldn't even be at this place.

6167
03:19:02,270 --> 03:19:02,681
Fuck him.

6168
03:19:02,681 --> 03:19:04,710
Bernie Sanders should have fucking him

6169
03:19:05,530 --> 03:19:09,110
and they the fuck out of
bed and they put her up.

6170
03:19:09,350 --> 03:19:10,880
This would even be close.

6171
03:19:11,120 --> 03:19:14,240
This will be an all math man.

6172
03:19:15,170 --> 03:19:16,350
You fucking fast.

6173
03:19:16,351 --> 03:19:17,390
I don't know about that too.

6174
03:19:17,720 --> 03:19:19,250
It would've been mostly blue map.

6175
03:19:19,480 --> 03:19:21,860
Who would fucking tell him Sam,

6176
03:19:22,110 --> 03:19:23,300
who's gonna kill him?

6177
03:19:23,301 --> 03:19:23,510
Dude.

6178
03:19:23,510 --> 03:19:24,140
Dude,

6179
03:19:24,140 --> 03:19:26,270
you're saying this in Los Angeles.

6180
03:19:26,840 --> 03:19:28,760
Nobody say this same argument,

6181
03:19:29,190 --> 03:19:29,730
but dude,

6182
03:19:29,730 --> 03:19:30,563
no,

6183
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:32,833
because

6184
03:19:32,940 --> 03:19:37,230
the emails when they come
out at the to destroy them,

6185
03:19:37,450 --> 03:19:40,870
it was all about this fucking emails
and all this shit and it's just all this

6186
03:19:40,871 --> 03:19:42,250
dirt that came out at guys.

6187
03:19:42,251 --> 03:19:42,610
Guys,

6188
03:19:42,610 --> 03:19:43,443
you know something.

6189
03:19:43,510 --> 03:19:45,070
We have no control over the all of this.

6190
03:19:45,370 --> 03:19:46,670
Let's just stop yelling at hold on.

6191
03:19:46,671 --> 03:19:47,491
His bill per telling.

6192
03:19:47,491 --> 03:19:48,460
Everybody to calm down.

6193
03:19:48,461 --> 03:19:49,271
Is that what just happened?

6194
03:19:49,271 --> 03:19:49,440
Right?

6195
03:19:49,440 --> 03:19:49,541
You,

6196
03:19:49,541 --> 03:19:51,590
we do have control over your

6197
03:19:53,320 --> 03:19:53,561
time.

6198
03:19:53,561 --> 03:19:54,480
Say Yell sometimes.

6199
03:19:54,490 --> 03:19:56,860
Love Morgan Murphy have control over it.

6200
03:19:57,130 --> 03:20:02,130
I just had vote and it's
for bill as the moderator.

6201
03:20:04,350 --> 03:20:05,183
Quiet.

6202
03:20:05,790 --> 03:20:08,190
Do you ever watching the screen
for like fucking two hours?

6203
03:20:08,191 --> 03:20:10,770
It's still two 44 to 50 Joe.

6204
03:20:10,800 --> 03:20:13,290
Want to call it still people
moving around so I know,

6205
03:20:13,291 --> 03:20:13,531
hey,

6206
03:20:13,531 --> 03:20:14,670
my questions.

6207
03:20:14,790 --> 03:20:16,180
I'd love to hear Doug's squash.

6208
03:20:16,181 --> 03:20:17,320
Really have a question.

6209
03:20:17,360 --> 03:20:18,180
Is your question?

6210
03:20:18,180 --> 03:20:19,890
I want to hear your answer.

6211
03:20:22,080 --> 03:20:23,280
It started with David,

6212
03:20:23,281 --> 03:20:24,960
massage mini and the racism.

6213
03:20:25,080 --> 03:20:29,340
What if you just dislike somebody

6214
03:20:31,230 --> 03:20:32,220
further race?

6215
03:20:33,430 --> 03:20:34,200
Okay,

6216
03:20:34,200 --> 03:20:39,200
let's say do stay with me for a minute.

6217
03:20:40,110 --> 03:20:41,400
I stutter a lot.

6218
03:20:41,580 --> 03:20:43,410
This is an honest question.

6219
03:20:43,710 --> 03:20:44,490
If you hate,

6220
03:20:44,490 --> 03:20:48,030
there's people that I dislike
looking at a breakfast,

6221
03:20:48,240 --> 03:20:49,073
right?

6222
03:20:50,700 --> 03:20:52,320
You don't say it out loud,

6223
03:20:52,650 --> 03:20:57,650
but you know in your heart
like feed that thing at home,

6224
03:21:01,500 --> 03:21:03,330
but whatever it is going on,

6225
03:21:03,331 --> 03:21:03,431
right.

6226
03:21:03,431 --> 03:21:06,540
You know that there's
someone that you really,

6227
03:21:06,750 --> 03:21:09,930
a lot of people that Scotsman,

6228
03:21:11,070 --> 03:21:12,090
I'm going to out him,

6229
03:21:12,091 --> 03:21:13,320
he's a faddish.

6230
03:21:13,620 --> 03:21:18,240
He's disgusted by fat
people and dangly jewelry.

6231
03:21:18,660 --> 03:21:23,160
He can't look at someone with
dangly jewelry at breakfast.

6232
03:21:23,370 --> 03:21:25,710
What if you know that you fucking,

6233
03:21:25,740 --> 03:21:26,573
hey,

6234
03:21:26,940 --> 03:21:31,940
nothing portional but you do like at
what point is that whole political

6235
03:21:32,671 --> 03:21:34,260
correctness going to come back to?

6236
03:21:34,650 --> 03:21:34,831
Well,

6237
03:21:34,831 --> 03:21:37,290
you can't hate people you hate,

6238
03:21:37,980 --> 03:21:39,510
you can't hate dicks.

6239
03:21:39,690 --> 03:21:40,830
You just have to rehab.

6240
03:21:40,831 --> 03:21:42,120
To have a reason to hate people.

6241
03:21:43,290 --> 03:21:44,160
What's your reason?

6242
03:21:44,650 --> 03:21:46,160
I was bill burr.

6243
03:21:46,220 --> 03:21:47,053
You're not

6244
03:21:47,410 --> 03:21:48,243
modeling.

6245
03:21:56,190 --> 03:21:57,930
I wish you dude,

6246
03:21:57,990 --> 03:21:59,580
you're build is perfect.

6247
03:21:59,620 --> 03:22:00,570
Can I just say that?

6248
03:22:00,750 --> 03:22:02,910
It's a perfect for what you,

6249
03:22:02,970 --> 03:22:04,740
this is perfect.

6250
03:22:05,130 --> 03:22:08,410
I dream of being like this shirt.

6251
03:22:08,570 --> 03:22:09,630
Babies aren't shit.

6252
03:22:11,430 --> 03:22:12,540
He's fun size.

6253
03:22:13,080 --> 03:22:13,770
He's,

6254
03:22:13,770 --> 03:22:14,521
he's fun sites.

6255
03:22:14,521 --> 03:22:14,941
He's like,

6256
03:22:14,941 --> 03:22:18,000
if he's like winter carnival
and you could just hug it.

6257
03:22:20,850 --> 03:22:21,960
What I think Doug was saying,

6258
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:24,240
she was a very lucky
boy killing his podcast.

6259
03:22:24,450 --> 03:22:25,283
Is it spent?

6260
03:22:25,410 --> 03:22:28,620
It's been two 44 to two 15
for like three fucking hours.

6261
03:22:28,621 --> 03:22:32,460
It's just like they just trying to come
up with a way to call this close to

6262
03:22:32,461 --> 03:22:33,294
call.

6263
03:22:34,560 --> 03:22:36,190
This is not a podcast.

6264
03:22:39,360 --> 03:22:39,510
Yeah.

6265
03:22:39,510 --> 03:22:40,680
Every feed is different.

6266
03:22:40,681 --> 03:22:42,930
That's what's so confusing.

6267
03:22:42,970 --> 03:22:44,100
It's like MSNBC.

6268
03:22:44,101 --> 03:22:46,020
Everybody has different numbers.

6269
03:22:47,450 --> 03:22:48,283
All right.

6270
03:22:48,720 --> 03:22:49,620
We got a new logo,

6271
03:22:49,830 --> 03:22:51,950
a new level of a dude.

6272
03:22:51,951 --> 03:22:53,700
Who the fuck is this lunatic right here?

6273
03:22:53,780 --> 03:22:56,140
The file can.

6274
03:22:56,180 --> 03:22:57,440
They can't tell him right there going,

6275
03:22:57,441 --> 03:22:59,040
it looks for Jeffrey Lord.

6276
03:22:59,520 --> 03:23:00,360
It looks crazy.

6277
03:23:00,940 --> 03:23:01,773
I wonder.

6278
03:23:02,310 --> 03:23:02,550
No,

6279
03:23:02,550 --> 03:23:05,530
CNN and there where they were like
a predicting what was gonna happen.

6280
03:23:05,560 --> 03:23:08,730
They set up New Hampshire gets this and
have to cause this that Trump could win

6281
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:12,330
and there was clearly a panel of people
and they were miked and you just heard

6282
03:23:12,331 --> 03:23:13,164
somebody go,

6283
03:23:13,410 --> 03:23:14,490
Jeez,

6284
03:23:15,540 --> 03:23:16,650
like you don't know who it was,

6285
03:23:16,651 --> 03:23:18,840
but somebody reacted harshly.

6286
03:23:18,950 --> 03:23:20,360
They're freaking out.

6287
03:23:21,200 --> 03:23:22,820
They still haven't called Michigan.

6288
03:23:24,330 --> 03:23:26,040
It's exactly,

6289
03:23:26,180 --> 03:23:28,850
I think at this one I feel like we
ought to start taking questions from the

6290
03:23:28,851 --> 03:23:29,684
crowd.

6291
03:23:30,350 --> 03:23:33,560
We've been babbling for fucking
four hours here from the crowd.

6292
03:23:33,561 --> 03:23:35,200
I'll take a question question.

6293
03:23:35,220 --> 03:23:36,380
The guy who's killing it,

6294
03:23:37,010 --> 03:23:37,843
killing it.

6295
03:23:38,780 --> 03:23:39,650
What's the Condo?

6296
03:23:39,651 --> 03:23:41,150
Oregon has a great ass.

6297
03:23:41,180 --> 03:23:42,013
What's a condom?

6298
03:23:43,260 --> 03:23:44,480
That's a great question.

6299
03:23:44,750 --> 03:23:45,700
What's a condom?

6300
03:23:45,800 --> 03:23:47,150
That is a boner killer.

6301
03:23:48,050 --> 03:23:49,460
It's a prophylactic depth.

6302
03:23:50,690 --> 03:23:53,450
Protects down to the end
of your chef for diseases,

6303
03:23:53,451 --> 03:23:57,200
but your balls are left hanging
out to dry like the bay of pigs.

6304
03:23:58,910 --> 03:24:00,010
Your boss were out there like

6305
03:24:02,160 --> 03:24:03,970
your balls are out there like security.

6306
03:24:03,980 --> 03:24:05,060
You fucking serious.

6307
03:24:05,450 --> 03:24:06,840
I would make my automate.

6308
03:24:07,160 --> 03:24:09,140
Can we just like put on the ballot?

6309
03:24:09,141 --> 03:24:11,030
Any rules for porn that we want to make?

6310
03:24:11,031 --> 03:24:14,690
Like you can't call someone daddy if
they're only like 10 years older than you,

6311
03:24:14,691 --> 03:24:15,650
like that kind of shit.

6312
03:24:15,860 --> 03:24:20,120
I respect that you can't have mills porn
that's under 35 is what I think that

6313
03:24:20,121 --> 03:24:20,820
should be one of them.

6314
03:24:20,820 --> 03:24:25,070
Anybody over the age should or porn that
silver 35 anybody who is in your uncle

6315
03:24:25,071 --> 03:24:26,720
that wants you to call them by the name?

6316
03:24:26,721 --> 03:24:30,770
I'll call that guy in prison the
way I've totally seen just them.

6317
03:24:31,480 --> 03:24:32,510
That should be illegal.

6318
03:24:32,810 --> 03:24:33,643
A short game.

6319
03:24:34,830 --> 03:24:35,340
Yeah.

6320
03:24:35,340 --> 03:24:35,810
Yeah.

6321
03:24:35,810 --> 03:24:36,471
You guys got to go,

6322
03:24:36,471 --> 03:24:36,940

6323
03:24:36,940 --> 03:24:38,620
I brought one other question.

6324
03:24:38,630 --> 03:24:39,101
Sorry guys.

6325
03:24:39,101 --> 03:24:40,250
So we're doing the best we can here.

6326
03:24:40,251 --> 03:24:41,690
I know I was going to
take this fucking long.

6327
03:24:41,691 --> 03:24:43,040
It's almost 10 30 here.

6328
03:24:43,380 --> 03:24:44,250
Any other questions?

6329
03:24:46,060 --> 03:24:47,490
I've got a question.

6330
03:24:47,770 --> 03:24:48,850
Xanax was down front.

6331
03:24:48,851 --> 03:24:49,270
Down Front.

6332
03:24:49,270 --> 03:24:49,631
You sir,

6333
03:24:49,631 --> 03:24:50,860
next to the one with the purple hair?

6334
03:24:50,890 --> 03:24:51,041
No.

6335
03:24:51,041 --> 03:24:52,180
How about that guy right there?

6336
03:24:52,181 --> 03:24:54,490
He looks like he's working
with some kind of like

6337
03:24:56,800 --> 03:24:58,570
the man raised his hand.

6338
03:24:58,870 --> 03:24:59,703
Tripoli.

6339
03:25:00,280 --> 03:25:00,761
Yeah.

6340
03:25:00,761 --> 03:25:01,950
You're recording

6341
03:25:04,800 --> 03:25:06,160
the crowds drunker than us?

6342
03:25:07,090 --> 03:25:08,220
Yes.

6343
03:25:09,550 --> 03:25:10,510
Do you have a question?

6344
03:25:10,630 --> 03:25:11,590
A nice question.

6345
03:25:13,120 --> 03:25:13,953
I just wanted to know.

6346
03:25:15,050 --> 03:25:15,651
Hey Joe,

6347
03:25:15,651 --> 03:25:17,140
take one with the women's Mikes.

6348
03:25:21,070 --> 03:25:21,401
Okay.

6349
03:25:21,401 --> 03:25:22,240
What's your question?

6350
03:25:22,241 --> 03:25:22,921
You're sure now?

6351
03:25:22,921 --> 03:25:23,410
All right.

6352
03:25:23,410 --> 03:25:23,800
Uh,

6353
03:25:23,800 --> 03:25:24,221
Morgan,

6354
03:25:24,221 --> 03:25:25,420
can I drink with you later?

6355
03:25:25,421 --> 03:25:25,711
Can we,

6356
03:25:25,711 --> 03:25:26,600
we have a drink with you

6357
03:25:28,900 --> 03:25:29,860
political free

6358
03:25:33,940 --> 03:25:35,760
on the apocalypse night.

6359
03:25:35,780 --> 03:25:36,613
That's,

6360
03:25:36,790 --> 03:25:37,980
this is exciting.

6361
03:25:39,350 --> 03:25:39,481
Hey,

6362
03:25:39,481 --> 03:25:40,740
let's stop doing crowd work.

6363
03:25:40,741 --> 03:25:41,790
Let's go back to us.

6364
03:25:42,210 --> 03:25:42,961
Sorry guys.

6365
03:25:42,961 --> 03:25:45,450
He fucked it up for all of
you all have a drink with you?

6366
03:25:45,570 --> 03:25:46,050
Nope.

6367
03:25:46,050 --> 03:25:46,351
Nope,

6368
03:25:46,351 --> 03:25:46,591
nope,

6369
03:25:46,591 --> 03:25:46,891
nope,

6370
03:25:46,891 --> 03:25:47,161
nope,

6371
03:25:47,161 --> 03:25:47,580
nope.

6372
03:25:47,580 --> 03:25:47,881
Nope.

6373
03:25:47,881 --> 03:25:50,910
I don't trust anybody after
this fucking fuck nuts.

6374
03:25:52,750 --> 03:25:53,220
Okay.

6375
03:25:53,220 --> 03:25:57,420
You get an opportunity to represent the
people and you come in and check off on

6376
03:25:57,421 --> 03:25:59,450
your ballot almost.

6377
03:26:00,090 --> 03:26:01,950
I don't give a fuck about is great babe.

6378
03:26:01,951 --> 03:26:04,910
Girlfriend fucking go back to us.

6379
03:26:04,950 --> 03:26:05,990
She's got a choker

6380
03:26:08,220 --> 03:26:09,090
and choke him.

6381
03:26:10,080 --> 03:26:11,640
I just got here.

6382
03:26:12,150 --> 03:26:13,020
Who has a question?

6383
03:26:13,510 --> 03:26:15,070
Are we cool with president Trump?

6384
03:26:15,120 --> 03:26:15,670
What do we do?

6385
03:26:15,670 --> 03:26:17,520
So you should be deported if Trump wins.

6386
03:26:18,310 --> 03:26:18,581
Joe.

6387
03:26:18,581 --> 03:26:19,110
Joe.

6388
03:26:19,110 --> 03:26:19,561
Yes.

6389
03:26:19,561 --> 03:26:21,490
Are they saying they called it?

6390
03:26:21,950 --> 03:26:22,380
Oh No,

6391
03:26:22,380 --> 03:26:22,610
no.

6392
03:26:22,610 --> 03:26:27,610
Still two 46 to 15 bill says too close
to crying yet is the one that's the one

6393
03:26:28,390 --> 03:26:29,081
that's the clip.

6394
03:26:29,081 --> 03:26:30,760
The red wire or the black wire.

6395
03:26:31,840 --> 03:26:34,060
This is the moment and a Tom cruise movie.

6396
03:26:34,690 --> 03:26:37,030
We all salute to the scientologist,

6397
03:26:37,780 --> 03:26:38,613
you know,

6398
03:26:39,130 --> 03:26:39,461
by the way,

6399
03:26:39,461 --> 03:26:43,210
how the fuck do you commit to a religion
that was created by an old red head

6400
03:26:43,211 --> 03:26:45,200
with crooked teeth in a broken down bone?

6401
03:26:45,540 --> 03:26:46,270
You know,

6402
03:26:46,270 --> 03:26:47,110
your teeth are fine.

6403
03:26:48,250 --> 03:26:49,083
Um,

6404
03:26:50,510 --> 03:26:52,420
parents used to live in Pennsylvania,

6405
03:26:52,720 --> 03:26:57,280
but the idea of Pennsylvania decided
in the fucking fate of the country

6406
03:26:57,460 --> 03:27:02,020
highlights how crazy this fucking
thing in Florida with Amish people,

6407
03:27:03,530 --> 03:27:06,120
sixers the super Steelers Phillies,

6408
03:27:06,710 --> 03:27:08,260
penguins burgs awesome.

6409
03:27:08,410 --> 03:27:12,430
But they're surrounded by a bunch of
people that are just fucking hanging out.

6410
03:27:12,460 --> 03:27:13,293
I love Pittsburgh,

6411
03:27:13,660 --> 03:27:14,493
Pennsylvania.

6412
03:27:14,740 --> 03:27:16,510
Fucking college right in
the middle of the state.

6413
03:27:20,160 --> 03:27:21,200
Earl Skagel,

6414
03:27:21,460 --> 03:27:22,293
I love you.

6415
03:27:24,800 --> 03:27:26,200
Only send us,

6416
03:27:26,210 --> 03:27:27,560
you were alive to vote,

6417
03:27:27,561 --> 03:27:28,394
right?

6418
03:27:28,590 --> 03:27:29,423
He's alive.

6419
03:27:29,760 --> 03:27:30,593
He's not alive.

6420
03:27:33,220 --> 03:27:34,053
The coach,

6421
03:27:34,240 --> 03:27:35,073
he said,

6422
03:27:35,130 --> 03:27:36,070
you call it prison.

6423
03:27:36,071 --> 03:27:36,910
He calls it heaven.

6424
03:27:38,650 --> 03:27:40,040
Can I get more whiskey here?

6425
03:27:40,050 --> 03:27:40,890
We're going to Joe Paterno.

6426
03:27:43,030 --> 03:27:43,391
Yeah.

6427
03:27:43,391 --> 03:27:45,340
That's why we don't want
you guys to be president.

6428
03:27:50,420 --> 03:27:51,340
Learn the pens,

6429
03:27:51,420 --> 03:27:52,710
paid named coach,

6430
03:27:52,860 --> 03:27:54,210
and then we'll fucking elect you.

6431
03:27:57,640 --> 03:27:58,470
Hey listen,

6432
03:27:58,470 --> 03:27:59,303
I knew what they were getting.

6433
03:27:59,710 --> 03:28:04,710
Just send me a text that says the New
York Times says Trump has a 91% chance of

6434
03:28:06,151 --> 03:28:06,984
winning.

6435
03:28:07,270 --> 03:28:08,360
Whoa.

6436
03:28:08,420 --> 03:28:08,961
However,

6437
03:28:08,961 --> 03:28:10,940
Trump owns the New York Times.

6438
03:28:13,790 --> 03:28:14,130
Hey,

6439
03:28:14,130 --> 03:28:14,630
Rogen,

6440
03:28:14,630 --> 03:28:15,463
have you heard of that?

6441
03:28:15,650 --> 03:28:18,290
Trump talks about getting
rid of the Federal Reserve.

6442
03:28:18,291 --> 03:28:19,190
What do you think about that?

6443
03:28:19,200 --> 03:28:20,033
It's a good move.

6444
03:28:21,930 --> 03:28:22,980
It's a good move.

6445
03:28:23,280 --> 03:28:24,840
Plus Stop the chem trails

6446
03:28:27,770 --> 03:28:27,950
would,

6447
03:28:27,950 --> 03:28:29,170
if he tries to do that,

6448
03:28:29,171 --> 03:28:33,850
they're going to bring out that fucking
63 convertible fucking the Lincoln

6449
03:28:33,851 --> 03:28:36,280
continental down through Dallas.

6450
03:28:36,281 --> 03:28:37,480
Drive him around town.

6451
03:28:37,590 --> 03:28:38,110
Yeah.

6452
03:28:38,110 --> 03:28:38,291
Hey,

6453
03:28:38,291 --> 03:28:39,280
here's a bookstore.

6454
03:28:39,600 --> 03:28:40,433
Yeah,

6455
03:28:40,670 --> 03:28:42,440
nice slow fucking left heart.

6456
03:28:43,150 --> 03:28:44,410
Have you ever taken that drive?

6457
03:28:44,411 --> 03:28:45,820
You haven't gone through that area.

6458
03:28:46,210 --> 03:28:47,410
I've gone to it,

6459
03:28:47,590 --> 03:28:52,060
which is what amazes me about Dallas
where if you guys had never been to Dallas

6460
03:28:52,120 --> 03:28:53,170
with John F.

6461
03:28:53,170 --> 03:28:54,070
Kennedy got assassinated.

6462
03:28:54,100 --> 03:28:55,540
They didn't mess with any of that.

6463
03:28:55,570 --> 03:29:00,220
It looks exactly like it did when it
happened and out here how they just don't

6464
03:29:00,221 --> 03:29:01,090
give a fuck.

6465
03:29:01,870 --> 03:29:05,410
Like Rob Robert Kennedy got killed
right down there and we'll show at the

6466
03:29:05,411 --> 03:29:06,400
ambassador hotel.

6467
03:29:06,580 --> 03:29:08,230
They just plowed that shit over,

6468
03:29:08,800 --> 03:29:10,450
turned it into a fucking school.

6469
03:29:10,451 --> 03:29:11,980
There's a little plaque on the ground.

6470
03:29:11,981 --> 03:29:12,431
Yay.

6471
03:29:12,431 --> 03:29:13,780
Died somewhere over here.

6472
03:29:14,380 --> 03:29:15,670
There's a little swing set.

6473
03:29:15,700 --> 03:29:16,990
They just don't give a shit out here.

6474
03:29:16,991 --> 03:29:18,220
That's a rose family.

6475
03:29:18,290 --> 03:29:18,730
Well,

6476
03:29:18,730 --> 03:29:19,563
Huh?

6477
03:29:20,350 --> 03:29:20,700
Yeah.

6478
03:29:20,700 --> 03:29:21,820
Earl's Tom Cole.

6479
03:29:22,090 --> 03:29:23,560
My Ann was Ethel Kennedy.

6480
03:29:23,561 --> 03:29:25,120
I don't like this topic right now.

6481
03:29:25,310 --> 03:29:28,060
Trump is to 64 nice headshots though.

6482
03:29:28,061 --> 03:29:32,140
Trump has two 64 before to two
15 trucks got Pennsylvania.

6483
03:29:32,260 --> 03:29:33,093
Oh,

6484
03:29:34,420 --> 03:29:35,253
right.

6485
03:29:36,580 --> 03:29:37,413
It's over.

6486
03:29:38,040 --> 03:29:38,641
Wow.

6487
03:29:38,641 --> 03:29:39,560
This is so

6488
03:29:41,180 --> 03:29:42,030
the winter.

6489
03:29:42,031 --> 03:29:42,551
Every night,

6490
03:29:42,551 --> 03:29:43,384
everybody,

6491
03:29:44,190 --> 03:29:44,671
folks,

6492
03:29:44,671 --> 03:29:45,390

6493
03:29:45,390 --> 03:29:47,270
he's going to make your life great again,

6494
03:29:47,271 --> 03:29:48,104
sir.

6495
03:29:48,480 --> 03:29:50,040
He's going to make it great again.

6496
03:29:51,100 --> 03:29:51,610
Fuck you.

6497
03:29:51,610 --> 03:29:56,610
Hold all calls till that man calls
you and makes your life great again.

6498
03:29:57,320 --> 03:29:58,530
Some fucking Philly.

6499
03:30:01,580 --> 03:30:01,730
Oh,

6500
03:30:01,730 --> 03:30:02,061
sorry.

6501
03:30:02,061 --> 03:30:02,440
Wrong.

6502
03:30:02,440 --> 03:30:03,280
This is good.

6503
03:30:03,550 --> 03:30:04,181
This is good.

6504
03:30:04,181 --> 03:30:05,320
Like a crazy girlfriend.

6505
03:30:05,321 --> 03:30:06,590
It gives great blow jobs,

6506
03:30:06,591 --> 03:30:08,050
but eventually she leaves you.

6507
03:30:08,290 --> 03:30:08,951
This is good.

6508
03:30:08,951 --> 03:30:10,060
You feel terrible,

6509
03:30:10,200 --> 03:30:12,250
but there's a growth period
that comes after that,

6510
03:30:12,390 --> 03:30:16,810
but you reassess your whole existence and
try to figure out why the fuck are you

6511
03:30:16,811 --> 03:30:17,510
here?

6512
03:30:17,510 --> 03:30:21,490
Why is the man with a cotton candy
here have his hand on the red phone?

6513
03:30:21,700 --> 03:30:22,930
What is happening?

6514
03:30:23,140 --> 03:30:24,460
What have we done?

6515
03:30:24,610 --> 03:30:25,540
What mistakes?

6516
03:30:25,541 --> 03:30:26,350
If we may,

6517
03:30:26,350 --> 03:30:28,570
let's we examine our existence.

6518
03:30:28,571 --> 03:30:29,290
This,

6519
03:30:29,290 --> 03:30:32,020
this is what this opportunity provides us.

6520
03:30:32,021 --> 03:30:32,870
Lazy Gentleman.

6521
03:30:33,300 --> 03:30:35,860
He provides us a moment of harkening.

6522
03:30:35,861 --> 03:30:40,861
I'm often of listening and thinking
and centering hadn't money doesn't mean

6523
03:30:41,451 --> 03:30:44,150
anything anymore because a
man with the orange skin,

6524
03:30:44,151 --> 03:30:44,481
sorry,

6525
03:30:44,481 --> 03:30:46,310
I'm fucking nuclear war.

6526
03:30:47,240 --> 03:30:48,073
Fuck yeah.

6527
03:30:48,110 --> 03:30:50,090
We all like to pile on the walking dead.

6528
03:30:50,210 --> 03:30:51,680
That's what I got to get into.

6529
03:30:53,040 --> 03:30:54,560
Why you get mad?

6530
03:30:54,570 --> 03:30:55,403
She still

6531
03:30:57,440 --> 03:30:58,273
sorry about that.

6532
03:30:58,870 --> 03:30:59,860
That's B two B,

6533
03:30:59,990 --> 03:31:02,960
some motivational video
on youtube very soon.

6534
03:31:03,710 --> 03:31:03,951
Yeah.

6535
03:31:03,951 --> 03:31:05,060
Man That was walking dead.

6536
03:31:05,061 --> 03:31:05,900
People are pussies.

6537
03:31:05,901 --> 03:31:07,070
I'm tired of that show.

6538
03:31:08,660 --> 03:31:12,010
Kill those fucking pumped gas
zombies and get it over with what?

6539
03:31:12,040 --> 03:31:13,310
He's going to fucking win.

6540
03:31:13,311 --> 03:31:14,300
This is unbelievable.

6541
03:31:16,260 --> 03:31:18,080
Super Bowl three.

6542
03:31:19,250 --> 03:31:20,690
This is like the USP,

6543
03:31:20,760 --> 03:31:21,710
the Russians.

6544
03:31:22,040 --> 03:31:25,970
This is like your brassica beaten you
fucking Miami when they came up with the

6545
03:31:25,971 --> 03:31:26,751
camouflage.

6546
03:31:26,751 --> 03:31:27,584
This is fucking,

6547
03:31:27,890 --> 03:31:29,750
it's like the Patriots beat the rams.

6548
03:31:29,751 --> 03:31:31,130
The greatest show on turf

6549
03:31:32,970 --> 03:31:33,640
questionably.

6550
03:31:33,640 --> 03:31:34,670
Yours is good.

6551
03:31:34,730 --> 03:31:35,563
Is this good?

6552
03:31:35,940 --> 03:31:37,040
Um,

6553
03:31:37,070 --> 03:31:38,630
I don't think so.

6554
03:31:41,660 --> 03:31:43,280
If he didn't so relate.

6555
03:31:43,340 --> 03:31:43,970
Honestly,

6556
03:31:43,970 --> 03:31:44,570
to be honest with you,

6557
03:31:44,570 --> 03:31:45,141
he didn't sell,

6558
03:31:45,141 --> 03:31:48,650
relate to so many like
overtly racist people,

6559
03:31:48,890 --> 03:31:49,970
to be honest with you.

6560
03:31:50,030 --> 03:31:53,060
And like that level of ugliness.

6561
03:31:53,180 --> 03:31:55,310
If he didn't relate to Alaska,

6562
03:31:55,311 --> 03:31:56,330
he got Alaska.

6563
03:31:56,670 --> 03:31:57,503
Uh,

6564
03:32:02,370 --> 03:32:07,370
they give him three to 47 to
58 he needs to 70 with the APP.

6565
03:32:10,730 --> 03:32:12,690
I totally blows me away.

6566
03:32:13,460 --> 03:32:15,770
She's a 55 away.

6567
03:32:16,730 --> 03:32:17,900
Oh my God.

6568
03:32:19,400 --> 03:32:22,840
You mean to tell me the
deadliest voted for Hilary?

6569
03:32:22,841 --> 03:32:23,674
Believable?

6570
03:32:23,950 --> 03:32:25,040
Unfathomable.

6571
03:32:26,750 --> 03:32:28,580
I don't know if this is the least loss.

6572
03:32:28,581 --> 03:32:29,001
Seven.

6573
03:32:29,001 --> 03:32:29,834
Nothing.

6574
03:32:30,080 --> 03:32:31,610
I mean it's kind of funny.

6575
03:32:31,860 --> 03:32:33,540
He's 48% of her,

6576
03:32:33,541 --> 03:32:35,190
46% of the Michigan.

6577
03:32:35,191 --> 03:32:36,390
It's over bitches.

6578
03:32:36,660 --> 03:32:37,160
Robbie,

6579
03:32:37,160 --> 03:32:37,993
Robbie,

6580
03:32:39,300 --> 03:32:43,010
concen happy last year everybody by 3.1

6581
03:32:43,140 --> 03:32:43,750

6582
03:32:43,750 --> 03:32:44,580
Bam,

6583
03:32:44,580 --> 03:32:45,413
Bam,

6584
03:32:46,260 --> 03:32:47,093
Bam,

6585
03:32:49,000 --> 03:32:49,833
fine.

6586
03:32:50,820 --> 03:32:51,210
Alright.

6587
03:32:51,210 --> 03:32:53,790
Don't pull your money
out of the stock market.

6588
03:32:54,090 --> 03:32:55,410
Everything's going to be fine.

6589
03:32:55,411 --> 03:32:57,660
It's the guy with an
orange wig with the tie.

6590
03:32:58,320 --> 03:32:59,370
Everything is fine.

6591
03:32:59,400 --> 03:33:00,180
All right.

6592
03:33:00,180 --> 03:33:01,020
Doug stayed home.

6593
03:33:01,070 --> 03:33:02,610
Has a special announcement.

6594
03:33:02,910 --> 03:33:03,720
Well,

6595
03:33:03,720 --> 03:33:08,720
I figured out how to have the phone put
the Bingos head while she's in a coma,

6596
03:33:11,990 --> 03:33:15,300
so she's been listening
for the last thing.

6597
03:33:16,860 --> 03:33:17,693
Hold on a second.

6598
03:33:17,880 --> 03:33:18,151
Hey,

6599
03:33:18,151 --> 03:33:19,050
you guys got to,

6600
03:33:19,220 --> 03:33:20,730
you got to stop that song.

6601
03:33:20,731 --> 03:33:21,720
Whoever's think Megan,

6602
03:33:21,721 --> 03:33:24,600
that song played because that'll
get us pulled up a youtube.

6603
03:33:25,950 --> 03:33:26,191
Oh,

6604
03:33:26,191 --> 03:33:26,970
don't do that anymore,

6605
03:33:26,970 --> 03:33:27,803
dude.

6606
03:33:28,050 --> 03:33:28,883
Come on.

6607
03:33:33,980 --> 03:33:37,310
Bingo has been listening
for 34 minutes in a coma.

6608
03:33:37,860 --> 03:33:38,100
There's

6609
03:33:38,100 --> 03:33:39,510
a phone against her hand,

6610
03:33:39,920 --> 03:33:44,920
but if bill burr is right that Trump
is president and I'm just going to say

6611
03:33:46,440 --> 03:33:47,273
Bingo,

6612
03:33:47,430 --> 03:33:48,870
go towards the light.

6613
03:33:56,470 --> 03:33:57,760
It's so interesting.

6614
03:33:58,240 --> 03:33:59,021
It really is.

6615
03:33:59,021 --> 03:34:00,190
It's really interesting.

6616
03:34:01,330 --> 03:34:01,720
I mean,

6617
03:34:01,720 --> 03:34:03,820
what the fuck have we
gotten ourselves into

6618
03:34:05,940 --> 03:34:06,361
ma'am?

6619
03:34:06,361 --> 03:34:10,920
You with the fake cat ears
whenever you got going on,

6620
03:34:10,980 --> 03:34:11,813
ma'am.

6621
03:34:12,030 --> 03:34:12,760
Question.

6622
03:34:12,760 --> 03:34:13,350
Okay.

6623
03:34:13,350 --> 03:34:14,380
Can you take it from me?

6624
03:34:14,430 --> 03:34:15,263
We'd hear you better,

6625
03:34:16,750 --> 03:34:17,200
Bert.

6626
03:34:17,200 --> 03:34:18,033
Kreischer

6627
03:34:21,860 --> 03:34:22,180
too.

6628
03:34:22,180 --> 03:34:23,110
It's very loud.

6629
03:34:29,710 --> 03:34:30,251
I like it.

6630
03:34:30,251 --> 03:34:31,084
When you said,

6631
03:34:31,350 --> 03:34:31,690
uh,

6632
03:34:31,690 --> 03:34:36,690
when people are elected and
maybe this maybe talk to

6633
03:34:38,750 --> 03:34:39,590
fucking behave,

6634
03:34:40,000 --> 03:34:42,250
how do you feel that that truck

6635
03:34:42,820 --> 03:34:44,980
go back to the Mad Max?

6636
03:34:47,230 --> 03:34:48,630
All of a sudden I'm Jenny.

6637
03:34:51,160 --> 03:34:52,630
I'm answering questions from the crowd.

6638
03:34:52,631 --> 03:34:53,350
I don't know.

6639
03:34:53,350 --> 03:34:53,950
You know,

6640
03:34:53,950 --> 03:34:54,210
we,

6641
03:34:54,210 --> 03:34:54,971
we never know.

6642
03:34:54,971 --> 03:34:57,520
It's never happened before
and it's like that's,

6643
03:34:57,550 --> 03:34:58,780
that's our big romance.

6644
03:34:58,781 --> 03:34:59,201
It's like,

6645
03:34:59,201 --> 03:35:00,760
like in a pretty woman,

6646
03:35:01,690 --> 03:35:03,280
the hooker with a heart of gold,

6647
03:35:03,430 --> 03:35:04,060
hope,

6648
03:35:04,060 --> 03:35:04,421
hope.

6649
03:35:04,421 --> 03:35:08,770
Some rich businessman comes and rescues
or we hope that some person pretends to

6650
03:35:08,771 --> 03:35:10,960
be someone other than
what they really are.

6651
03:35:11,200 --> 03:35:12,250
Then it gets into office.

6652
03:35:12,251 --> 03:35:13,360
Then once they get in there,

6653
03:35:13,420 --> 03:35:14,253
they show us.

6654
03:35:14,320 --> 03:35:19,150
They really have purely
altruistic intentions and
they want to take care of us,

6655
03:35:19,390 --> 03:35:21,220
but we've never found anybody like that.

6656
03:35:22,390 --> 03:35:22,930
You know?

6657
03:35:22,930 --> 03:35:23,741
They get inside.

6658
03:35:23,741 --> 03:35:25,090
They just want to get their dick sucked.

6659
03:35:25,960 --> 03:35:26,890
Paula,

6660
03:35:28,390 --> 03:35:29,223
where's that happened?

6661
03:35:29,730 --> 03:35:32,070
Did you do to take care of
your wait staff thing yet?

6662
03:35:32,280 --> 03:35:33,090
No,

6663
03:35:33,090 --> 03:35:35,280
we should do birthdays.

6664
03:35:36,420 --> 03:35:37,680
We have 15 more minutes,

6665
03:35:37,681 --> 03:35:37,891
man.

6666
03:35:37,891 --> 03:35:38,100
I think.

6667
03:35:38,100 --> 03:35:39,480
What are we selling?

6668
03:35:39,481 --> 03:35:40,050
Merch?

6669
03:35:40,050 --> 03:35:41,580
Why did we think this wasn't going to,

6670
03:35:41,590 --> 03:35:42,151
oh my God.

6671
03:35:42,151 --> 03:35:47,151
The Republicans have won the
Senate to 48 to 46 in the Senate.

6672
03:35:47,310 --> 03:35:48,240
Holy Shit.

6673
03:35:48,270 --> 03:35:49,350
This is crazy.

6674
03:35:49,920 --> 03:35:51,960
We're fucking 50 we're almost

6675
03:35:54,040 --> 03:35:54,480
never,

6676
03:35:54,480 --> 03:35:56,980
who gives a shit why we
thought this was going to be

6677
03:36:00,060 --> 03:36:01,800
350 people here that paid money.

6678
03:36:01,830 --> 03:36:02,101
I know,

6679
03:36:02,101 --> 03:36:02,771
but fuck it.

6680
03:36:02,771 --> 03:36:03,820
Hopefully we can burn.

6681
03:36:03,980 --> 03:36:05,020
It was going to be closing.

6682
03:36:05,040 --> 03:36:06,150
That's fascinating.

6683
03:36:06,151 --> 03:36:06,984
Like,

6684
03:36:07,050 --> 03:36:07,561
Hey guys,

6685
03:36:07,561 --> 03:36:09,050
let's Sarah get her opinions enrolled.

6686
03:36:09,060 --> 03:36:09,893
They count

6687
03:36:12,960 --> 03:36:14,510
what's Trump becomes president.

6688
03:36:14,750 --> 03:36:16,130
We're going to zip that shot.

6689
03:36:17,390 --> 03:36:19,910
Oh my God,

6690
03:36:20,510 --> 03:36:21,110
Sarah.

6691
03:36:21,110 --> 03:36:22,730
Easily a six and a half.

6692
03:36:24,500 --> 03:36:25,550
I'll take it.

6693
03:36:26,120 --> 03:36:26,953
I'll give her a six.

6694
03:36:27,010 --> 03:36:27,540
You don't want him,

6695
03:36:27,540 --> 03:36:29,000
you get caught up living out here.

6696
03:36:29,001 --> 03:36:29,561
You think of you,

6697
03:36:29,561 --> 03:36:31,400
the whole country thinks
the way you think out here,

6698
03:36:33,920 --> 03:36:34,940
ladies and gentlemen.

6699
03:36:35,020 --> 03:36:36,370
So lopsided.

6700
03:36:36,400 --> 03:36:41,400
And then I heard today that a lot of
people like it when people were pulling,

6701
03:36:41,860 --> 03:36:43,180
like a lot of people said,

6702
03:36:43,240 --> 03:36:43,391
oh,

6703
03:36:43,391 --> 03:36:44,470
I'm not voting for Trump.

6704
03:36:44,471 --> 03:36:47,890
And then they did because
they were apparently too
embarrassed to say that they

6705
03:36:47,891 --> 03:36:49,540
were so liberal lie.

6706
03:36:49,600 --> 03:36:49,870
Right.

6707
03:36:49,870 --> 03:36:50,530
Well I don't know.

6708
03:36:50,530 --> 03:36:51,341
That's what I'm saying.

6709
03:36:51,341 --> 03:36:54,550
Like I know to say you go on social media,

6710
03:36:54,551 --> 03:36:56,470
it's all a fucking oversharing.

6711
03:36:56,830 --> 03:36:58,060
People won't shut the voices.

6712
03:36:58,270 --> 03:37:01,610
Most important podcast
of your life asking,

6713
03:37:02,670 --> 03:37:06,040
I'm on more opinion who
are in this business,

6714
03:37:06,041 --> 03:37:08,770
live in New York or la and
that's what they were around.

6715
03:37:08,771 --> 03:37:10,540
And I think that that's
America and it isn't.

6716
03:37:10,570 --> 03:37:13,870
They need to go on the road and start
telling jokes and I'll meet other people.

6717
03:37:13,930 --> 03:37:14,531
But don't do that.

6718
03:37:14,531 --> 03:37:14,740
I'm like,

6719
03:37:14,740 --> 03:37:19,690
I'm not direct polls were in
Ohio and Florida and Miss Sarah,

6720
03:37:19,770 --> 03:37:23,590
if I held you ever walk by
anybody taken a poll and they go,

6721
03:37:23,591 --> 03:37:23,771
Hey,

6722
03:37:23,771 --> 03:37:25,090
can I stop you for a second?

6723
03:37:25,091 --> 03:37:25,391
It's like,

6724
03:37:25,391 --> 03:37:25,661
no,

6725
03:37:25,661 --> 03:37:26,620
I got shit to dope.

6726
03:37:26,621 --> 03:37:27,520
Go Fuck Yourself.

6727
03:37:27,990 --> 03:37:28,930
They talk to,

6728
03:37:28,990 --> 03:37:30,160
I get those phone calls.

6729
03:37:31,170 --> 03:37:32,200
I get the phone calls.

6730
03:37:32,201 --> 03:37:34,990
I don't answer it but do not call

6731
03:37:35,420 --> 03:37:36,051
occasionally.

6732
03:37:36,051 --> 03:37:37,160
Let's let Burt tart.

6733
03:37:37,220 --> 03:37:39,590
If you did a poll in this
room and you're like,

6734
03:37:39,620 --> 03:37:40,460
and they're walking on the street,

6735
03:37:40,461 --> 03:37:40,671
you're like,

6736
03:37:40,671 --> 03:37:40,851
hey,

6737
03:37:40,851 --> 03:37:41,810
have you ever said the n word?

6738
03:37:41,930 --> 03:37:42,471
Everyone be like,

6739
03:37:42,471 --> 03:37:42,801
no,

6740
03:37:42,801 --> 03:37:43,610
never,

6741
03:37:43,610 --> 03:37:45,140
but that's not fucking true.

6742
03:37:46,010 --> 03:37:47,350
There's people out there that uh,

6743
03:37:47,360 --> 03:37:51,320
will be voting for Trump because they
feel disenfranchised by the system,

6744
03:37:51,500 --> 03:37:54,800
but don't want to share it and get into
an argument with some fucking random

6745
03:37:54,801 --> 03:37:56,940
liberal in the by the water cooler.

6746
03:38:00,960 --> 03:38:01,793
That was Doug.

6747
03:38:04,280 --> 03:38:05,980
I agree with you

6748
03:38:11,280 --> 03:38:12,150
listening folks.

6749
03:38:12,320 --> 03:38:13,153
This is,

6750
03:38:13,260 --> 03:38:16,320
this is is fucked up
for us as it is for you.

6751
03:38:16,860 --> 03:38:18,600
How dare you say that word or

6752
03:38:20,260 --> 03:38:22,440
legally you can stay
it now as of midnight.

6753
03:38:24,360 --> 03:38:25,193
What time is

6754
03:38:25,940 --> 03:38:26,121
one?

6755
03:38:26,121 --> 03:38:26,751
Is My phone is,

6756
03:38:26,751 --> 03:38:28,900
my point is it's the,

6757
03:38:28,901 --> 03:38:31,700
there are disenfranchised people.

6758
03:38:32,700 --> 03:38:33,860
Why they called it?

6759
03:38:34,820 --> 03:38:35,653
What?

6760
03:38:36,590 --> 03:38:37,430
Another person,

6761
03:38:37,520 --> 03:38:38,630
Trump is the president.

6762
03:38:39,640 --> 03:38:40,720
Adrian Peterson

6763
03:38:42,370 --> 03:38:46,150
have a black guy call
a collection election.

6764
03:38:47,100 --> 03:38:52,100
Trump is the president comes
the president as we know it.

6765
03:38:53,460 --> 03:38:54,293
Yay.

6766
03:38:55,940 --> 03:38:56,711
They're legit.

6767
03:38:56,711 --> 03:38:57,544
Called it.

6768
03:38:58,150 --> 03:38:58,751
I don't know.

6769
03:38:58,751 --> 03:39:01,250
They did not call it yellow bird.

6770
03:39:01,260 --> 03:39:02,510
Naughty crasher.

6771
03:39:02,710 --> 03:39:03,970
You have no shirt on.

6772
03:39:03,971 --> 03:39:04,804
You motherfucker.

6773
03:39:04,810 --> 03:39:05,950
How dare you.

6774
03:39:05,951 --> 03:39:08,140
Maybe I shouldn't be arguing politics.

6775
03:39:12,420 --> 03:39:13,600
He's six away.

6776
03:39:15,160 --> 03:39:15,910
What?

6777
03:39:15,910 --> 03:39:17,260
What is undecided?

6778
03:39:17,950 --> 03:39:19,300
What is undecided?

6779
03:39:20,400 --> 03:39:21,233
Or

6780
03:39:22,510 --> 03:39:23,980
are they telling you that on Grindr,

6781
03:39:25,000 --> 03:39:27,360
but he'll never win any of those states.

6782
03:39:27,420 --> 03:39:29,210
Is that Carlito Alaska,

6783
03:39:29,410 --> 03:39:30,071
Alaska,

6784
03:39:30,071 --> 03:39:31,790
Arizona and Michigan are done.

6785
03:39:33,030 --> 03:39:33,863
It's tough.

6786
03:39:35,510 --> 03:39:35,910
Well,

6787
03:39:35,910 --> 03:39:37,160
I mean in front of 400 people,

6788
03:39:37,540 --> 03:39:38,000
truthfully,

6789
03:39:38,000 --> 03:39:38,660
but I heard,

6790
03:39:38,660 --> 03:39:39,493
I appreciate it.

6791
03:39:39,870 --> 03:39:41,220
Shibley had a great line.

6792
03:39:41,221 --> 03:39:42,054
We missed it.

6793
03:39:45,800 --> 03:39:46,633
Where are you

6794
03:39:47,940 --> 03:39:50,580
talking about Bingo right now will,

6795
03:39:52,190 --> 03:39:53,023
ah,

6796
03:39:55,480 --> 03:39:56,950
since no one's clicking the microphone,

6797
03:39:56,951 --> 03:40:01,630
I'll tell you that my showtime special
airs November 11th At 10:00 PM seriously,

6798
03:40:01,631 --> 03:40:02,464
folks,

6799
03:40:02,950 --> 03:40:06,250
how great is the fucking comedy
touring the God damn election night.

6800
03:40:06,251 --> 03:40:07,084
Huh?

6801
03:40:11,940 --> 03:40:13,530
Quick get a Po cave.

6802
03:40:13,870 --> 03:40:15,870
We're gonna be okay.

6803
03:40:16,440 --> 03:40:16,980
I know.

6804
03:40:16,980 --> 03:40:18,690
Feels fucking crazy.

6805
03:40:20,010 --> 03:40:20,611
Hey guys,

6806
03:40:20,611 --> 03:40:22,280
take care of your cocktail waitresses.

6807
03:40:22,290 --> 03:40:23,123
Seriously.

6808
03:40:23,280 --> 03:40:25,740
There are doing this to hooking up,

6809
03:40:25,741 --> 03:40:26,610
so take care of them.

6810
03:40:28,590 --> 03:40:29,790
They're about to be deported.

6811
03:40:37,670 --> 03:40:38,840
That girl from Tinder here.

6812
03:40:38,841 --> 03:40:39,674
Yeah.

6813
03:40:41,430 --> 03:40:42,263
There's just like,

6814
03:40:44,540 --> 03:40:47,240
does anybody feel bad
if Trump wins are good?

6815
03:40:47,241 --> 03:40:48,680
If Hillary wins are good,

6816
03:40:48,681 --> 03:40:50,150
if Trump wins are good,

6817
03:40:50,170 --> 03:40:51,950
if I don't know,

6818
03:40:51,951 --> 03:40:53,960
we need to see what the
fuck is going to do first.

6819
03:40:54,320 --> 03:40:57,050
It aids kind of like
the WME buying the UFC.

6820
03:40:58,310 --> 03:41:00,200
We don't know what the
fuck is going to happen.

6821
03:41:01,360 --> 03:41:04,520
You have no idea how
exactly right you are.

6822
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:07,850
Doesn't matter if you
don't watch the sport.

6823
03:41:07,870 --> 03:41:08,703
Yeah,

6824
03:41:08,930 --> 03:41:12,900
it's really going to come
from in is like pray you,

6825
03:41:12,920 --> 03:41:17,060
you avoid things that might bite you
or have herpes on their Dicker Lips.

6826
03:41:18,630 --> 03:41:19,160
You just,

6827
03:41:19,160 --> 03:41:19,760
yeah.

6828
03:41:19,760 --> 03:41:20,331
Government.

6829
03:41:20,331 --> 03:41:21,164
Fuck them.

6830
03:41:21,500 --> 03:41:22,220
You don't need,

6831
03:41:22,220 --> 03:41:23,053
all right.

6832
03:41:23,360 --> 03:41:24,193
What's up buddy?

6833
03:41:24,650 --> 03:41:28,940
Make me smoke DMT fucking 12 years
ago and I've never been right since.

6834
03:41:29,360 --> 03:41:30,590
You're good dude.

6835
03:41:30,591 --> 03:41:31,460
You're fine.

6836
03:41:32,610 --> 03:41:34,940
Steve is smuggled little
this a little bit more,

6837
03:41:36,880 --> 03:41:38,780
but this is supposed to be a joke.

6838
03:41:38,960 --> 03:41:39,591
The end of the world.

6839
03:41:39,591 --> 03:41:40,424
Who gives a fuck?

6840
03:41:40,580 --> 03:41:42,620
We did this with the Mayan calendar.

6841
03:41:42,640 --> 03:41:42,890
Yeah,

6842
03:41:42,890 --> 03:41:43,370
yeah,

6843
03:41:43,370 --> 03:41:44,203
the world.

6844
03:41:45,500 --> 03:41:50,500
We weren't really upset
about the Czech Republic.

6845
03:41:57,500 --> 03:41:58,030
Peters,

6846
03:41:58,030 --> 03:41:58,860
you mother fucker.

6847
03:41:58,860 --> 03:42:00,140
Doug Stanhope going on tilt.

6848
03:42:01,700 --> 03:42:02,710
It's okay folks.

6849
03:42:03,140 --> 03:42:06,980
I watched a youtube video today where
these two guys got into a fight and they

6850
03:42:06,981 --> 03:42:07,970
went to the ground,

6851
03:42:08,000 --> 03:42:09,080
little ground and pound,

6852
03:42:09,440 --> 03:42:10,700
and it turned out halfway through.

6853
03:42:10,701 --> 03:42:15,590
One of the dudes had a fake leg and it
came off and the other dude was losing

6854
03:42:15,591 --> 03:42:19,130
and then the fucking dude picked up the
fake leg and he started beating the guy

6855
03:42:19,131 --> 03:42:19,964
with it.

6856
03:42:21,260 --> 03:42:22,640
Like I can zone ass.

6857
03:42:23,060 --> 03:42:24,320
It was fucking a,

6858
03:42:24,321 --> 03:42:24,651
yeah,

6859
03:42:24,651 --> 03:42:25,330
it was all like,

6860
03:42:25,330 --> 03:42:27,230
I was thinking like if
I was that Kid's dad,

6861
03:42:27,231 --> 03:42:27,711
I would have been like,

6862
03:42:27,711 --> 03:42:28,310
dude,

6863
03:42:28,310 --> 03:42:29,240
you lost the fight.

6864
03:42:29,810 --> 03:42:32,490
Give him his prosthetic back and just,

6865
03:42:32,491 --> 03:42:33,324
you know,

6866
03:42:33,390 --> 03:42:34,223
go to the gym.

6867
03:42:34,850 --> 03:42:35,661
I disagree.

6868
03:42:35,661 --> 03:42:36,500
As an analyst,

6869
03:42:36,501 --> 03:42:36,771
I say,

6870
03:42:36,771 --> 03:42:38,450
you got to use what's in front of you.

6871
03:42:39,890 --> 03:42:40,970
If it's okay,

6872
03:42:41,240 --> 03:42:43,550
if that guy's beating your
ass and he's got a fake leg,

6873
03:42:43,551 --> 03:42:45,710
kicked that motherfucker
to the side and go,

6874
03:42:45,711 --> 03:42:47,240
what's up now hop along.

6875
03:42:47,241 --> 03:42:47,841
But he didn't.

6876
03:42:47,841 --> 03:42:48,320
He didn't,

6877
03:42:48,320 --> 03:42:49,460
he didn't initiate it.

6878
03:42:49,550 --> 03:42:50,131
It doesn't matter.

6879
03:42:50,131 --> 03:42:51,200
He was in his house.

6880
03:42:51,380 --> 03:42:52,430
The dude was calling them.

6881
03:42:52,431 --> 03:42:55,100
I'll know what kind of
relationship the guy reminded.

6882
03:42:55,101 --> 03:42:56,360
I call the passive aggressive

6883
03:42:56,460 --> 03:42:57,630
piece of shit for years.

6884
03:42:57,660 --> 03:42:57,841
Well,

6885
03:42:57,841 --> 03:43:02,130
I would just say that I saw the video
and I'm just judging from what the fuck I

6886
03:43:02,131 --> 03:43:02,520
saw it.

6887
03:43:02,520 --> 03:43:02,851
Come on,

6888
03:43:02,851 --> 03:43:03,001
man.

6889
03:43:03,001 --> 03:43:05,220
You gotta you gotta draw the line of
beating somebody with their own fake.

6890
03:43:05,590 --> 03:43:07,130
Unless that guy's a piece of shit.

6891
03:43:07,890 --> 03:43:08,460
Eat Shit.

6892
03:43:08,460 --> 03:43:11,780
It just lost his leg last week and
he's still a client who started it.

6893
03:43:12,090 --> 03:43:12,923
The trauma,

6894
03:43:12,940 --> 03:43:14,770
it looked like the other
kid was the aggressor.

6895
03:43:14,771 --> 03:43:15,091
I try.

6896
03:43:15,091 --> 03:43:16,480
I'm not the one with the bad leg.

6897
03:43:16,930 --> 03:43:17,111
Look,

6898
03:43:17,111 --> 03:43:20,020
I'm just saying the guy's fucking
leg fell off and he beat him with it.

6899
03:43:20,800 --> 03:43:21,820
Click off the election.

6900
03:43:21,821 --> 03:43:22,870
Let's pull up that video.

6901
03:43:22,910 --> 03:43:27,910
Then the guy that won his three legs
Shucker I'll take that video and I'll see

6902
03:43:28,421 --> 03:43:31,090
you and I'll fucking push up.

6903
03:43:31,091 --> 03:43:33,090
One duty got fucked to death by horse.

6904
03:43:33,650 --> 03:43:38,590
I've never seen drunk opie and Anthony
show come to him and they told you to

6905
03:43:38,591 --> 03:43:39,161
take it down.

6906
03:43:39,161 --> 03:43:40,160
X percent of my shows.

6907
03:43:41,170 --> 03:43:44,470
Rogan made me watch that after
the fake moon landing thing.

6908
03:43:44,550 --> 03:43:45,300
Then it was,

6909
03:43:45,300 --> 03:43:45,451
hey,

6910
03:43:45,451 --> 03:43:46,380
they're dropping the checks.

6911
03:43:46,381 --> 03:43:48,040
Is anybody having an
official announcement?

6912
03:43:48,041 --> 03:43:49,890
Because God knows this
fucking half of video,

6913
03:43:49,891 --> 03:43:51,420
half a keyboard

6914
03:43:51,450 --> 03:43:52,990
doesn't it seems like it's over.

6915
03:43:53,050 --> 03:43:53,883
Is it over?

6916
03:43:54,940 --> 03:43:55,840
I mean they're running it.

6917
03:43:55,841 --> 03:43:57,030
They'll burn the funding.

6918
03:43:57,070 --> 03:44:00,790
Only iron man here stayed
here the entire time.

6919
03:44:01,660 --> 03:44:02,493
Sarah,

6920
03:44:02,680 --> 03:44:03,401
real quick though,

6921
03:44:03,401 --> 03:44:04,510
looks like points.

6922
03:44:04,840 --> 03:44:06,610
No condoms in porn is going to win.

6923
03:44:06,670 --> 03:44:07,503
So uh,

6924
03:44:08,950 --> 03:44:09,840
whoa.

6925
03:44:10,390 --> 03:44:11,223
Hillary Clinton.

6926
03:44:11,560 --> 03:44:13,110
It's up in Michigan.

6927
03:44:13,140 --> 03:44:13,321
No,

6928
03:44:13,321 --> 03:44:13,440
no.

6929
03:44:13,440 --> 03:44:13,951
She's down.

6930
03:44:13,951 --> 03:44:14,784
Sorry.

6931
03:44:14,910 --> 03:44:15,743
Sorry.

6932
03:44:16,950 --> 03:44:21,060
48.2 to 46.6 I thought this is so crazy.

6933
03:44:21,420 --> 03:44:22,770
So crazy.

6934
03:44:22,980 --> 03:44:23,813
He Won.

6935
03:44:24,180 --> 03:44:28,530
He fucking won a reality TV show.

6936
03:44:28,531 --> 03:44:33,531
Star is now the leader I one of the most
powerful countries in the free world.

6937
03:44:36,300 --> 03:44:38,400
One one or the

6938
03:44:39,950 --> 03:44:40,783
fuck.

6939
03:44:40,930 --> 03:44:42,090
Fuck Dude.

6940
03:44:42,091 --> 03:44:42,930
We got robots.

6941
03:44:42,960 --> 03:44:44,100
Can you do me one favor?

6942
03:44:44,101 --> 03:44:44,880
Bill,

6943
03:44:44,880 --> 03:44:49,530
can you see if Joan Hanchin
toady kind of kicked her ass?

6944
03:44:49,590 --> 03:44:51,260
Is that really we?

6945
03:44:52,480 --> 03:44:53,313
Hey,

6946
03:44:55,740 --> 03:44:56,573
what's that?

6947
03:44:58,050 --> 03:44:58,531
Yeah,

6948
03:44:58,531 --> 03:44:59,490
it looks unlike Trump.

6949
03:44:59,491 --> 03:45:00,600
Kind of kicked her ass.

6950
03:45:03,190 --> 03:45:04,570
It's pretty fucking weird.

6951
03:45:05,110 --> 03:45:05,943
What's that?

6952
03:45:07,630 --> 03:45:10,300
It's two 64 to two 15 right now.

6953
03:45:10,390 --> 03:45:11,051
Is this bill.

6954
03:45:11,051 --> 03:45:12,190
We are an old Trump.

6955
03:45:13,810 --> 03:45:15,340
This is weird corner.

6956
03:45:15,670 --> 03:45:19,660
I feel like the me down because Trump won.

6957
03:45:21,940 --> 03:45:23,800
The crowd went weird on us.

6958
03:45:25,440 --> 03:45:26,273
It's not time.

6959
03:45:27,890 --> 03:45:28,401
It's really,

6960
03:45:28,401 --> 03:45:29,710
they just dropped checks.

6961
03:45:29,740 --> 03:45:30,200
Nothing.

6962
03:45:30,200 --> 03:45:30,860
Stop.

6963
03:45:30,860 --> 03:45:31,160
Nothing.

6964
03:45:31,160 --> 03:45:32,440
You realize a trek.

6965
03:45:32,990 --> 03:45:34,450
I had a paid to listen.

6966
03:45:34,480 --> 03:45:35,151
These fucking,

6967
03:45:35,151 --> 03:45:35,771
you're the worst.

6968
03:45:35,771 --> 03:45:37,490
She just finally snatch that joint.

6969
03:45:37,520 --> 03:45:41,690
I think Donald Trump just nominated
judge Judy as the Supreme Court.

6970
03:45:43,710 --> 03:45:45,480
It's Dr. Ross is the sergeant general.

6971
03:45:46,530 --> 03:45:46,771
Hey,

6972
03:45:46,771 --> 03:45:50,520
at least we'll all remember where we
were when America voted for it's own.

6973
03:45:50,521 --> 03:45:51,354
Nine 11

6974
03:45:54,720 --> 03:45:56,580
nine 11 three countries.

6975
03:45:56,850 --> 03:45:57,870
This is what God wants.

6976
03:46:00,390 --> 03:46:02,580
Payment joke about a
woman being president.

6977
03:46:02,720 --> 03:46:03,553
Yeah.

6978
03:46:03,980 --> 03:46:04,290
Brad,

6979
03:46:04,290 --> 03:46:08,220
do your joke about how I
bet 70 operators audience.

6980
03:46:09,090 --> 03:46:09,810
Hey,

6981
03:46:09,810 --> 03:46:11,910
how many of you guys are going
to hang in till the final?

6982
03:46:12,930 --> 03:46:14,000
You're going to hang in there.

6983
03:46:14,001 --> 03:46:14,400
All right.

6984
03:46:14,400 --> 03:46:15,231
I know your pain,

6985
03:46:15,231 --> 03:46:16,260
your checks and shit.

6986
03:46:16,410 --> 03:46:21,410
So we appreciate you guys staying for
the four hours of this fucking whatever

6987
03:46:21,931 --> 03:46:22,764
this is.

6988
03:46:23,130 --> 03:46:23,251
Well,

6989
03:46:23,251 --> 03:46:23,761
here's a joke.

6990
03:46:23,761 --> 03:46:24,051
You got it.

6991
03:46:24,051 --> 03:46:25,140
You guys are here for this.

6992
03:46:25,280 --> 03:46:26,600
So as a joke,

6993
03:46:26,630 --> 03:46:29,150
so reality started a criminal president.

6994
03:46:30,530 --> 03:46:31,340
Why would you,

6995
03:46:31,340 --> 03:46:32,570
why would you be doing joke?

6996
03:46:33,440 --> 03:46:37,580
Said the tread is not a time for jokes.

6997
03:46:38,050 --> 03:46:38,883
Trump.

6998
03:46:39,940 --> 03:46:41,430
You're saying you,

6999
03:46:41,550 --> 03:46:43,940
you guys are disappointed,

7000
03:46:44,420 --> 03:46:45,253
right?

7001
03:46:46,810 --> 03:46:47,090
No,

7002
03:46:47,090 --> 03:46:47,271
no,

7003
03:46:47,271 --> 03:46:47,511
no.

7004
03:46:47,511 --> 03:46:48,344
I feel it.

7005
03:46:48,470 --> 03:46:50,930
I feel it like reluctantly.

7006
03:46:51,200 --> 03:46:53,630
A lot of us in here wanted Hillary to win,

7007
03:46:53,660 --> 03:46:54,170
right?

7008
03:46:54,170 --> 03:46:55,003
Yeah.

7009
03:46:55,970 --> 03:46:56,990
I kind of did.

7010
03:46:57,530 --> 03:46:59,240
I voted for Gary Johnson.

7011
03:46:59,241 --> 03:47:01,070
I know Hillary's full of shit,

7012
03:47:01,370 --> 03:47:05,540
but I kind of wanted her to win
just to fucking balanced all out.

7013
03:47:08,600 --> 03:47:09,433
Good points there.

7014
03:47:10,420 --> 03:47:10,980
Marijuana.

7015
03:47:10,980 --> 03:47:11,750
Greg goes,

7016
03:47:11,750 --> 03:47:12,830
I want to get high too.

7017
03:47:14,220 --> 03:47:15,570
For those of you listening at home,

7018
03:47:15,571 --> 03:47:15,960
this is,

7019
03:47:15,960 --> 03:47:16,350
yes,

7020
03:47:16,350 --> 03:47:17,670
it is indeed unraveling,

7021
03:47:20,310 --> 03:47:23,560
but he is not that in fact,

7022
03:47:23,561 --> 03:47:26,050
reflecting the world that we live in.

7023
03:47:26,440 --> 03:47:29,320
Are we not unraveling collectively

7024
03:47:30,530 --> 03:47:32,390
fucking reality show in this room.

7025
03:47:32,570 --> 03:47:33,403
Yeah.

7026
03:47:37,570 --> 03:47:38,410
Maybe the next,

7027
03:47:38,470 --> 03:47:39,303
maybe the

7028
03:47:39,590 --> 03:47:39,930
person.

7029
03:47:39,930 --> 03:47:40,790
It comes from a real,

7030
03:47:40,791 --> 03:47:41,030
what?

7031
03:47:41,030 --> 03:47:41,950
Real housewife shop.

7032
03:47:43,210 --> 03:47:46,400
This lady in front of you with a
purple hair is reconsidering her entire

7033
03:47:46,401 --> 03:47:47,060
existence.

7034
03:47:47,060 --> 03:47:48,200
Like what the fuck?

7035
03:47:49,560 --> 03:47:50,240
What?

7036
03:47:50,240 --> 03:47:51,770
What got me here?

7037
03:47:51,890 --> 03:47:53,390
What are we doing?

7038
03:47:53,450 --> 03:47:55,400
Why is this happening?

7039
03:47:55,580 --> 03:47:58,760
What is the formula for happiness?

7040
03:47:59,220 --> 03:48:02,720
Darnay he came through.

7041
03:48:02,900 --> 03:48:03,471
Who roof,

7042
03:48:03,471 --> 03:48:04,030
ma'am.

7043
03:48:04,030 --> 03:48:04,361
Ma'Am,

7044
03:48:04,361 --> 03:48:05,720
you are committed to those words.

7045
03:48:05,721 --> 03:48:06,554
What are they?

7046
03:48:09,530 --> 03:48:10,190
Hold on,

7047
03:48:10,190 --> 03:48:10,671
sir.

7048
03:48:10,671 --> 03:48:11,504
Don't be rude

7049
03:48:11,790 --> 03:48:12,623
ma'am.

7050
03:48:17,460 --> 03:48:18,293
Christ.

7051
03:48:18,870 --> 03:48:19,141
Fuck.

7052
03:48:19,141 --> 03:48:21,130
Let Chelsea Clinton in this bitch.

7053
03:48:21,460 --> 03:48:22,830
Oh my God,

7054
03:48:22,831 --> 03:48:23,664
I hate her.

7055
03:48:25,980 --> 03:48:27,360
Is there a drug sniffing dog here,

7056
03:48:27,361 --> 03:48:27,530
right,

7057
03:48:27,530 --> 03:48:28,363
Tony?

7058
03:48:30,560 --> 03:48:33,910
Tony Hinchcliffe isn't
salty and very salty like a,

7059
03:48:33,920 --> 03:48:37,760
like a long choice abrasive
to the ladies especially.

7060
03:48:37,990 --> 03:48:38,823
Yeah,

7061
03:48:39,800 --> 03:48:41,990
like a deadly as cash type of dude.

7062
03:48:44,590 --> 03:48:46,100
Something that's happening here.

7063
03:48:46,190 --> 03:48:47,900
Russell Peters.

7064
03:48:48,900 --> 03:48:49,733
Let's just,

7065
03:48:49,960 --> 03:48:51,710
let's eat some silence.

7066
03:48:52,580 --> 03:48:54,050
Everyone's already tense.

7067
03:48:54,080 --> 03:48:55,880
Let's just make it a little bit worse.

7068
03:48:56,000 --> 03:48:57,620
All of our expectations,

7069
03:48:57,800 --> 03:49:00,350
it's 11 o'clock folks have,

7070
03:49:00,740 --> 03:49:03,200
winning is worse than the
worst heckler where we,

7071
03:49:03,201 --> 03:49:04,370
I don't know how to deal with this.

7072
03:49:04,371 --> 03:49:05,870
This is not how the thing ends.

7073
03:49:06,320 --> 03:49:07,790
I didn't know how it goes.

7074
03:49:07,880 --> 03:49:09,800
We're going to rotate people in and out.

7075
03:49:10,040 --> 03:49:10,600
We get,

7076
03:49:10,600 --> 03:49:11,180
honestly,

7077
03:49:11,180 --> 03:49:12,980
if Trump doesn't win in my head,

7078
03:49:13,220 --> 03:49:15,170
but honestly as a culture,

7079
03:49:15,171 --> 03:49:17,450
it's one of the best things
that could've happened to us.

7080
03:49:17,720 --> 03:49:19,910
Not because he's a good president,

7081
03:49:20,030 --> 03:49:20,910
but we can't.

7082
03:49:20,960 --> 03:49:23,450
We have to revamp this
fucking goofy system.

7083
03:49:23,860 --> 03:49:25,120
We can't keep doing this.

7084
03:49:26,650 --> 03:49:31,650
We can't keep pretending that every
fucking day of our life has to depend on

7085
03:49:32,951 --> 03:49:35,560
four year increments of dictators.

7086
03:49:35,710 --> 03:49:36,640
That's crazy.

7087
03:49:37,030 --> 03:49:37,660
It's crazy.

7088
03:49:37,660 --> 03:49:38,460
For years.

7089
03:49:38,460 --> 03:49:41,440
People that have relationships with
people that make billions of dollars to

7090
03:49:41,710 --> 03:49:43,330
contribute to the campaign funds.

7091
03:49:43,450 --> 03:49:44,380
It's nonsense.

7092
03:49:45,890 --> 03:49:47,300
Favorite TV car.

7093
03:49:48,230 --> 03:49:49,570
I like any show

7094
03:49:52,340 --> 03:49:54,260
fucking rebel flag back on.

7095
03:49:54,320 --> 03:49:55,480
I got an ATV.

7096
03:49:55,490 --> 03:49:56,960
The Rockford files,

7097
03:49:57,560 --> 03:49:58,580
James Garner,

7098
03:49:58,581 --> 03:50:00,020
that fucking Firebird.

7099
03:50:00,021 --> 03:50:02,990
The fact he didn't have the
Trans am he lived on the wind.

7100
03:50:03,020 --> 03:50:05,450
He lived in a fucking
trailer down on the beach,

7101
03:50:05,810 --> 03:50:06,201
you know,

7102
03:50:06,201 --> 03:50:07,940
but his car is still had a ball.

7103
03:50:08,600 --> 03:50:10,070
He hit the button down shirt.

7104
03:50:10,071 --> 03:50:10,780
He was still fat.

7105
03:50:10,780 --> 03:50:12,830
He tucked it in and he
still had it going on.

7106
03:50:13,450 --> 03:50:16,370
I still got some ass around my age.

7107
03:50:16,490 --> 03:50:21,020
I'll do you one better magnum Pi who
was beautiful and handsome and he drove

7108
03:50:21,021 --> 03:50:23,450
Ferrari three rarely guy lane.

7109
03:50:23,540 --> 03:50:25,520
He rarely got laid and we did.

7110
03:50:25,521 --> 03:50:30,350
It was special like is this get all
about TC and the hell magnum Pi and this

7111
03:50:30,351 --> 03:50:31,970
woman going to become soulmate.

7112
03:50:33,350 --> 03:50:35,660
We're just going to go next pomo.

7113
03:50:35,661 --> 03:50:36,140
I'm going.

7114
03:50:36,140 --> 03:50:36,621
Jan.

7115
03:50:36,621 --> 03:50:39,860
Michael ventured in his
hay day before even though

7116
03:50:43,440 --> 03:50:47,410
Jan Michael Vincent Changer
island on banana split,

7117
03:50:50,410 --> 03:50:53,500
the mechanic would Charles Bronson suck.

7118
03:50:53,530 --> 03:50:54,450
Charles Bronson's.

7119
03:50:54,460 --> 03:50:58,200
Dick like to Harry implied
all there was implied.

7120
03:50:58,420 --> 03:51:00,580
I'll leave the cleaning all the time now.

7121
03:51:00,790 --> 03:51:01,400
Oh yeah.

7122
03:51:01,400 --> 03:51:02,890
Dirty Mary crazy.

7123
03:51:02,891 --> 03:51:03,724
Larry.

7124
03:51:04,360 --> 03:51:05,370
Maybe that car.

7125
03:51:05,680 --> 03:51:06,910
Mr Belvedere.

7126
03:51:06,940 --> 03:51:09,280
I want the lotus from
the spy who loved me.

7127
03:51:09,610 --> 03:51:09,970
Oh,

7128
03:51:09,970 --> 03:51:11,030
it was for submarine.

7129
03:51:12,050 --> 03:51:13,040
This is that.

7130
03:51:13,050 --> 03:51:14,100
We deal with predeceases.

7131
03:51:17,110 --> 03:51:21,820
You stop talking about cars to go fast
in a straight line and can't take a term

7132
03:51:21,821 --> 03:51:23,380
without sending into the forest.

7133
03:51:23,381 --> 03:51:26,010
He started talking about
Mr October Jackson,

7134
03:51:26,011 --> 03:51:26,940
New York Yankees,

7135
03:51:26,941 --> 03:51:27,271
folks.

7136
03:51:27,271 --> 03:51:28,104
1970

7137
03:51:28,180 --> 03:51:29,320
what if we had our own

7138
03:51:32,000 --> 03:51:32,370
g,

7139
03:51:32,370 --> 03:51:34,810
t o never that one.

7140
03:51:35,250 --> 03:51:35,360
Oh,

7141
03:51:35,360 --> 03:51:37,600
that judge was the judge.

7142
03:51:37,970 --> 03:51:38,771
Black top head.

7143
03:51:38,771 --> 03:51:40,980
The guy fired a few rain.

7144
03:51:40,990 --> 03:51:41,823
What's his name?

7145
03:51:43,240 --> 03:51:44,170
Dennis Wilson.

7146
03:51:44,470 --> 03:51:45,800
Right before he drowned there,

7147
03:51:45,810 --> 03:51:49,120
that part of Chevy to test it.

7148
03:51:49,440 --> 03:51:49,981
Hey guys,

7149
03:51:49,981 --> 03:51:51,030
let's talk all this stuff.

7150
03:51:51,750 --> 03:51:52,171
Hold on,

7151
03:51:52,171 --> 03:51:52,690
bear Chrysler.

7152
03:51:52,690 --> 03:51:53,371
We've lost guys,

7153
03:51:53,371 --> 03:51:53,581
guys,

7154
03:51:53,581 --> 03:51:53,791
guys,

7155
03:51:53,791 --> 03:51:54,031
guys.

7156
03:51:54,031 --> 03:51:54,864
Guys,

7157
03:51:54,960 --> 03:51:57,240
I want to know is Trump our president?

7158
03:51:57,420 --> 03:51:58,253
Yeah.

7159
03:51:59,410 --> 03:52:00,171
Who Says No?

7160
03:52:00,171 --> 03:52:03,350
I had a bunch a latte.

7161
03:52:03,400 --> 03:52:04,720
Tricking liberals.

7162
03:52:06,730 --> 03:52:07,563
Ah,

7163
03:52:11,020 --> 03:52:14,510
Brian's saying we're going to
call this election right now.

7164
03:52:15,260 --> 03:52:18,470
The winner of the election
is Mister Bill Burr

7165
03:52:19,300 --> 03:52:22,480
for carrying the heaviest
lumber of this night.

7166
03:52:23,680 --> 03:52:26,710
Joe Rogan propping me up.

7167
03:52:29,050 --> 03:52:31,570
My running mate partner in crime.

7168
03:52:32,670 --> 03:52:33,790
I'd say Nice Shit.

7169
03:52:34,810 --> 03:52:36,410
Nobody tells the vice president.

7170
03:52:36,411 --> 03:52:37,720
It's a good position to be in.

7171
03:52:37,721 --> 03:52:41,740
I'm happy to support Mr.
Burn 2020 when a rock.

7172
03:52:41,741 --> 03:52:42,281
This bitch,

7173
03:52:42,281 --> 03:52:44,080
we're barely gonna put in any effort.

7174
03:52:44,200 --> 03:52:46,090
We depend entirely on new people.

7175
03:52:46,180 --> 03:52:47,610
Kanye 2020

7176
03:52:50,550 --> 03:52:51,840

7177
03:52:51,841 --> 03:52:52,674
Well cool.

7178
03:52:53,910 --> 03:52:55,500
We're all together in this freak show.

7179
03:52:55,710 --> 03:53:00,450
Did Joan Hanson when Lord to
his beat for city council.

7180
03:53:01,260 --> 03:53:02,280

7181
03:53:02,281 --> 03:53:03,114

7183
03:53:07,930 --> 03:53:08,300
Awesome.

7184
03:53:08,300 --> 03:53:11,390
At a certain point in time we have
to wonder about your judgment.

7185
03:53:13,410 --> 03:53:15,100
Why you're still here.

7186
03:53:17,160 --> 03:53:17,620
Come on.

7187
03:53:17,620 --> 03:53:18,700
Don't chastise him.

7188
03:53:18,701 --> 03:53:19,830
They didn't want to watch it.

7189
03:53:22,720 --> 03:53:23,140
Oh,

7190
03:53:23,140 --> 03:53:28,140

7192
03:53:29,710 --> 03:53:30,543

7195
03:53:32,141 --> 03:53:32,974
We'll get through it.

7196
03:53:33,760 --> 03:53:35,800
There'll be sandwiches for everybody.

7197
03:53:35,950 --> 03:53:37,240
This is better folks.

7198
03:53:37,510 --> 03:53:38,620
Get home sales guys.
