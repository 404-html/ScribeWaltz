1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,440
I'll just add,

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,273
just dropped.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,460
I just dropped something on
the keyboard and hit right.

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,780
Oh well it's perfect timing
ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,140
That's the story of this fucking show
where we're never exactly right with

6
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:11,974
anything.

7
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,790
It's always a mess,

8
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,110
but at least my phone's off.

9
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,500
I think the Joe Rogan experience podcast
is brought to you by onnit.com uh,

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,150
if you go to o n n I t and
use the code name Rogan,

11
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:25,030
you will save 10% off
any of the supplements.

12
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,170
And uh,

13
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:26,771
that includes,

14
00:00:26,771 --> 00:00:26,980
uh,

15
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,813
hemp force,

16
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,740
the delicious hemp protein supplement
that we actually have to get from Canada.

17
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:33,574
Ladies and gentlemen,

18
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,620
this is how goof we are as human beings.

19
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,230
Hemp is legal to own in this country.

20
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,060
It's legal to sell,

21
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,380
it's legal to buy,

22
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,580
but you can't grow it.

23
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,690
You can't grow it.

24
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:44,321
You have to grow.

25
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:44,891
And in Canada,

26
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:49,210
it's one of the dumbest fucking things
about this country that this amazing

27
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:51,400
plant is a illegal,

28
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:52,870
and it's not even psychoactive.

29
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,220
That's the other thing
you have to consider.

30
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:54,491
It's,

31
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:54,910
it's this,

32
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,140
just a textile and just
a food and just apply.

33
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,190
You can't get high from it.

34
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:00,701
There's very,

35
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:02,230
very little THC in hemp,

36
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,770
but the fact that it's illegal is one of
the dumbest things about agriculture in

37
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:09,551
this country.

38
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:13,420
It's so ridiculous because
it's a very worthwhile plant.

39
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,760
It's an excellent source of protein and
we combine it with raw cocoa and Maka

40
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:20,290
and it's fucking delicious.

41
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:24,150
It is seriously one of the best tasting
protein powders you can ever get because

42
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,810
it's sweetened with Stevia.

43
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,060
So it only has one gram of sugar.

44
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,620
So it's not poison you,

45
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:32,950
it doesn't make you feel sick and
it's really easily digestible.

46
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:34,180
It's fucking fantastic.

47
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,900
We also started selling recently,

48
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:37,810
we started selling a lot
of fitness equipment.

49
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,010
We have kettlebells,

50
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,570
battle ropes,

51
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,610
shit that makes you manly.

52
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,670
It's all like serious workout shit.

53
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:46,660
The uh,

54
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,890
the type of a full body workouts that
you see like UFC guys doing in the,

55
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,210
those countdown shows,

56
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,291
like that's a,

57
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,940
that's what kettlebell
workouts are all about.

58
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:56,500
That's what battle ropes are all about.

59
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:58,480
And I've been doing a lot
of battle rope Steph lately,

60
00:01:58,481 --> 00:01:59,260
Brian.

61
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,093
Yeah.

62
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,840
Sounds awesome.

63
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,853
Um,

64
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,083
go neighborhoods

65
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,460
save 10% off supplements.

66
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,780
The end with that.

67
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,210
We met all those on guys by the way in
Austin and was the full time that we got

68
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:14,380
to meet the whole entire staff and what
an amazing group of fucking employees,

69
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,120
Mans

70
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,953
awesome humans.

71
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,220
It was beautiful there.

72
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:17,790
The set,

73
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,810
it's just like Aubrey.

74
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,381
It's like,

75
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:20,100
you know what?

76
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,990
The dude is so positive and he's so,

77
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,060
he's so healthy like to talk to.

78
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,140
He sold there and present and then he
just surrounds himself with likeminded

79
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:28,511
people.

80
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:28,950
He just,

81
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,830
it was weird seeing it.

82
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,620
The faces behind the company,

83
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,930
it's a company you never get to see.

84
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:35,470
The employees totally see that.

85
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:35,530
The

86
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,370
trickle down man,

87
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:37,720
when you have a cool dad,

88
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,980
you know you have cool kids.

89
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:40,150
When you have a cool boss,

90
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,130
you have cool employees like that.

91
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:46,090
A guy can figure that out and how to
assemble such an awesome group of people

92
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:46,481
like that.

93
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:48,010
I don't know why I use that data analogy.

94
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,360
I think Bobby's Daddy,

95
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,263
he's still daddy.

96
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,250
Anyway,

97
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,260
Jesus Christ is going to be a long day.

98
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,280
We're also brought to
you by kerosene games.

99
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,990
This is the newest sponsor.

100
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,480
We're very excited about this because
it's a game company that is making,

101
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:02,960
uh,

102
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,610
they're making games
for directly for IPADS,

103
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,470
the directly for,

104
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,543
um,

105
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,710
I iPads and iPhones,

106
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,460
so it's not like they're porting
other games over to these,

107
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,500
to these platforms.

108
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:18,920
They're,

109
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,330
they're making them for tablets and
smartphones and the visuals are fucking

110
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:24,380
fantastic.

111
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,990
And their first game
is called blade runner.

112
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:27,981
And you know,

113
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:29,450
it's typical shit.

114
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:34,451
You play some crazy dude who's a bionic
cowboy and you're returning home from

115
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,420
years at war.

116
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,620
It's fun shit.

117
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,251
And the,

118
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:40,610
the residents have turned evil
and corrupted by dark magic.

119
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,440
It's all really stunning visuals and the,

120
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:47,390
the people who are behind kerosene games,

121
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:50,240
this young company and they
just seem cool as fuck.

122
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,490
They became connected to us through
Brian's friend Ryan Ryan Kelly.

123
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,690
She hooked him up with it and uh,

124
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,940
we liked the way they think.

125
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:00,230
We like what they're trying to do.

126
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,101
And a,

127
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:01,880
and Brian,

128
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,870
you've played the game.

129
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,290
Yeah,

130
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:03,681
yeah,

131
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:04,630
I've actually been playing it.

132
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:07,190
It was my first time
ever doing a Beta test,

133
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,750
like for the IPAD,

134
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:09,351
which is weird.

135
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:12,110
You have to put it in like this code and
you download like this thing that you

136
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:13,460
can't get in the APP store.

137
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,770
So it was a really fucking
interesting for me,

138
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:16,280
uh,

139
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:16,881
doing that.

140
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,331
And so yeah,

141
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:18,350
I've been playing with it for,

142
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:18,741
I don't know,

143
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:19,760
maybe three months.

144
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:22,460
I've gone through a lot of
builds of it and shit like that.

145
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:22,681
It's,

146
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:23,540
it's a fun game.

147
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,640
It's really awesome to see the,

148
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,590
how powerful the uh,

149
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,180
that iPhone is.

150
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:29,601
You know,

151
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:31,580
the iPhone is really fucking powerful.

152
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,510
Yeah.

153
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,580
What I'm trying to do even as a computer.

154
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:35,070
Yeah.

155
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,450
Yeah.

156
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,050
Like the,

157
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:36,230
the,

158
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,950
for gaming,

159
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,151
it's,

160
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,420
it's pretty interesting.

161
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,860
Interesting to see how,

162
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,850
uh,

163
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,480
like the Nintendo game boy used to be
the biggest thing Nintendo is hurting

164
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:48,620
right now because of the iPad and tablets
and stuff like that because they are

165
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,210
now the,

166
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,890
the best game boy and
intend to refuses to,

167
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,810
to go on any of these androids and
released like their old classics and stuff

168
00:04:56,811 --> 00:05:00,260
like that in the iPad because they
know once they start doing that,

169
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:01,160
they're killing themselves.

170
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,660
They're shooting themselves in the foot,

171
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,470
you know,

172
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,020
and their latest a Nintendo,

173
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,940
we has the controller
that has a tablet on it,

174
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:08,271
you know,

175
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:09,230
so it's like a tablet.

176
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:10,610
So they're trying to slowly like,

177
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:10,791
hey,

178
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:10,941
no,

179
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:12,380
we got tablet type stuff.

180
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:12,591
Yeah,

181
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:13,311
they're fucked.

182
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:13,731
But yeah,

183
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:14,331
really fun.

184
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:16,280
This game is a perfect example of why man,

185
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:17,120
this company,

186
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,530
like I,

187
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,040
I'm not sure how many
people are in this company,

188
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,920
but this game is awesome and,

189
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,280
and you can get it right now.

190
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,030
I think I just,

191
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,080
I just purchased it,

192
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,010
uh,

193
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,410
because I have been playing on
the Betas and stuff like that,

194
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,110
but it's on the iPad store
right now and you can,

195
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:30,470
uh,

196
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,040
I think it's like a 299
or something like that or

197
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,480
there must be a way,

198
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,340
I bet they'll probably invented soon to
make it so that you can link up your TVs

199
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,061
with your,

200
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:40,770
your iPads.

201
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,441
Can you do that?

202
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,050
Can you play like on a big screen TV,

203
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,010
uh,

204
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,670
send it?

205
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,971
Well,

206
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:46,360
yeah.

207
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,740
I mean you can actually,

208
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,930
the apple TV,

209
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,600
yes,

210
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:49,961
yes.

211
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:50,794
With Apple TV.

212
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:51,731
Does it work?

213
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:52,564
Does it look good?

214
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:52,991
Uh,

215
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:53,381
yeah,

216
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:56,380
it's awesome because these new
iPods and stuff like that or 10,

217
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:56,621
you know,

218
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:57,120
they have,

219
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,050
you can watch HD videos.

220
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,660
I think that like those consoles,

221
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,950
like the Xbox there.

222
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,400
Fuck.

223
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,430
Then because the input
that you get from pads,

224
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:07,264
from tablets,

225
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,661
this,

226
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:08,560
it's the best input,

227
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,970
the touching input,

228
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,010
the ability to control things like that.

229
00:06:12,011 --> 00:06:13,090
Like every those buttons,

230
00:06:13,091 --> 00:06:14,230
seam of SAR can.

231
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,540
Okay.

232
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,260
We have to the trailer right now that the
viewers are watching for this game on.

233
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,820
Here's kerosene games right here,

234
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:21,380
but we can't even show Kara,

235
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,540
do you want me to look at it real quick?

236
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,351
Check out.

237
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:27,730
This is an iPad came.

238
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:30,190
This is like something that
you would only see like,

239
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,070
like this looks like an Xbox game.

240
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,680
This looks like a ps three
game and this is on your iPad

241
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,350
on Ustream.

242
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,183
It looks like shit.

243
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,393
Wow.

244
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,691
Yeah,

245
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:10,980
so it's a,

246
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,960
it's one of those games that were like,

247
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,380
when somebody attacks you,

248
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,910
use your finger to swipe them and
to attack them and stuff like that.

249
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,500
I've been playing with it for a while.

250
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:20,190
It's great.

251
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,090
I highly recommend it,

252
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:23,820
especially for the price
when you're thinking of it
like an Xbox game that looks

253
00:07:23,821 --> 00:07:24,654
like this.

254
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,250
X box games or $59.

255
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,990
This is like two 99 I believe.

256
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,220
So check it out on the iTunes store.

257
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,340
It,

258
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,710
I'm not sure if it's on android or not.

259
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,650
I think it might be actually uh,

260
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,260
yeah.

261
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,810
I don't know if it's on
the coming soon to Android,

262
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,653
but yeah,

263
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,940
in the APP store right now.

264
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,451
Yeah.

265
00:07:39,451 --> 00:07:41,130
And it's called the blade slinger.

266
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:41,770
Late slinger.

267
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,480
It's only two 99 and uh,

268
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,240
it looks a lot cooler
than it does on Ustream.

269
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:46,050
Unfortunately.

270
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,460
Our Internet sucks the fat one,

271
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:48,180
so we're,

272
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,300
we're stuck in this terrible position
where we're grainy right now too.

273
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,600
Yeah,

274
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:52,831
yeah.

275
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,820
We're granting is fuck.

276
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,793
Well,

277
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,050
I'm trying something different
just so we could have,

278
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,040
this might work.

279
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,650
I'm a screen capturing
my computer right now,

280
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:04,230
so I might be able to have a video,

281
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:05,400
a better quality video.

282
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,761
Really.

283
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:06,031
Yeah.

284
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:07,650
So I'm trying to do some slick,

285
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:08,011
hacky,

286
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:08,844
stupid shit.

287
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,290
Hmm.

288
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:09,890
Okay.

289
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,910
Good luck with that shit.

290
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,730
Last last spots are,

291
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:16,790
I promise we're also
brought to you by ting.

292
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,460
This is the longest sponsor
day we've ever had folks.

293
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:20,270
You know why?

294
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,200
Cause I'm a whore.

295
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,700
That's why they are sad.

296
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,680
A Tang is a mobile company that
we have been doing business with,

297
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,180
uh,

298
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,750
for,

299
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,750
for several months now.

300
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:30,680
And we really like them.

301
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,940
We really liked what they're doing.

302
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,960
They um,

303
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,520
they have,

304
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:33,671
uh,

305
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:38,060
a company that uses a sprint backbone
and so you're getting like a major,

306
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,331
you know,

307
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:38,781
Internet,

308
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:39,740
cellular provider,

309
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,650
but you don't have the
same sort of contracts.

310
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,300
You can cancel anytime you want.

311
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,790
You,

312
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,130
um,

313
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,421
they,

314
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:50,540
they refund you on your next
bill if you don't use minutes.

315
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,850
I mean they give you,

316
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,061
they,

317
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:53,960
they like literally chop your,

318
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,630
your rate on the next
bill if you don't use,

319
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,330
like I say,

320
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,590
if you use less than you're
allotted amount of minutes,

321
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,040
they're like a very fair
and very ethical company.

322
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,360
And the,

323
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,020
um,

324
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,240
the idea behind them I
think is really cool.

325
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:12,550
It's like you can make money,

326
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,130
you just don't have to be
super fucking greeting.

327
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,060
And they have really nice
high level android phones,

328
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,130
including the Samsung Galaxy s
three which I have and it's awesome.

329
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,300
It's fucking beautiful.

330
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,890
Um,

331
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,070
I,

332
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,650
I,

333
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,910
they're sending me when supposedly,

334
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:29,740
supposedly what the fuck it's been weeks.

335
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:31,240
I think they're sending it by mail.

336
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,710
I think they put it on a donkey.

337
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,370
Yeah.

338
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,480
Mexican male or something?

339
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,433
No.

340
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,350
Like I like this male is like ridiculous.

341
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,610
Like,

342
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,550
like the cheapest though.

343
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:41,880
The USBS has a,

344
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,920
I don't think that's possible
because someone must have fucked up.

345
00:09:44,921 --> 00:09:45,754
They forgot to send it.

346
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,240
They traded,

347
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
they contacted me,

348
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,140
said that they wanted to send you
one and they even got your address.

349
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:50,974
I sent it to them.

350
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,330
Everything was confirmed.

351
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,110
Ting.

352
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,920
What the fuck?

353
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,920
I never has their new galaxy
s three go to rogan.ting.com.

354
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:00,781
Oh,

355
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:01,614
it's,

356
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,113
is that it?

357
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,343
Yes.

358
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,270
Okay.

359
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,840
It was something different
at one point in time,

360
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:12,020
go to [inaudible] dot com and you can
get a $50 credit to get started on one of

361
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:13,920
their super sweet,

362
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,251
big,

363
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:14,670
fat,

364
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,680
juicy android phones.

365
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,460
And again,

366
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,540
there's no contracts.

367
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:18,960
You can,

368
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,710
you can share minutes with
a friend or a loved one.

369
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,380
And uh,

370
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:23,871
just a,

371
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,550
a cool company doing business
with an excellent service.

372
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:26,731
You know,

373
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:26,941
they,

374
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:27,360
they uh,

375
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,610
they use the same service at sprint uses.

376
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,511
All right.

377
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:31,320
That's it.

378
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,180
That's the end of our podcast commercials.

379
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:33,720
Brian.

380
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,051
Oh,

381
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:34,770
Yay.

382
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,370
Kara.

383
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,370
Santa Maria is all up in this bitch and
she's ready to drop bombs on your mom's.

384
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,650
Fuck Carla experience.

385
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,913
Try my day.

386
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,570
Joe Rogan podcast my night.

387
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,970
Thank you very much for
coming on the podcast.

388
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,900
Really appreciate it.

389
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,400
Thanks for having me and bringing coffee.

390
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,360
Yeah.

391
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,020
Uh,

392
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,950
if you want some that's right.

393
00:10:57,951 --> 00:10:59,120
They're calling your name.

394
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,990
It's tempting you.

395
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,330
I've had a bit too much
caffeine already today.

396
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:03,164
I think so.

397
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:03,740
All right.

398
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,490
Take a breather.

399
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:04,650
Oh,

400
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:04,971
have you?

401
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:07,130
How many times a day
do you allow yourself?

402
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:07,760
Caffeine?

403
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,593
Yeah,

404
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,530
twice a day.

405
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,800
I won't let myself any more than two.

406
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:13,634
I'm a junkie.

407
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,450
That's how I feel.

408
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,280
I feel like if you're having
like three cups of coffee,

409
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:17,480
four cups of coffee a day,

410
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,190
probably think I'm a real junkie too.

411
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:20,270
Cause I don't drink coffee much.

412
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,530
I drink like Coca Cola.

413
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,200
Is that worse for you?

414
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,700
Because of the sugar?

415
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,450
It's so much work,

416
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,280
but it has way less caffeine in it.

417
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:29,210
It's not even the sugar.

418
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:29,451
Right?

419
00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:30,380
It's that corn syrup,

420
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,590
corn syrup,

421
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,230
but it has a lot less caffeine.

422
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:35,570
So why is it so delicious?

423
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:36,803
I love it.

424
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,580
Terrible for your brain.

425
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,830
So delicious.

426
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:41,660
All fizzy and your throat so good.

427
00:11:41,661 --> 00:11:44,700
Especially if you have like a
meatball sub or something like that.

428
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,131
Oh my God,

429
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:47,930
Amit Paul solving a cold coke.

430
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,770
Oof.

431
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,570
It's like just don't drink them every day.

432
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,433
Yeah.

433
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Every now and again you can get with what

434
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,330
my advice,

435
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:55,661
you know,

436
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:59,260
I have to say it's my vice because when
I quit I quit smoking cigarettes last

437
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,810
year I quit smoking weed
like a few years ago.

438
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,411
I haven't,

439
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:03,244
I don't drink.

440
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,030
Wow.

441
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,380
And so it's like,

442
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,120
do you do when you go off the rails?

443
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:09,940
Just coke some three or four.

444
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,131
I just,

445
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,300
I just yell a lot,

446
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:12,491
I guess.

447
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:12,841
I don't know.

448
00:12:12,841 --> 00:12:13,051
I don't,

449
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:15,330
I don't really go off
the rails in that way.

450
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,440
No vendors for me.

451
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,550
I was in the jungle of of Mexico
on the way to a Cheech and EATSA.

452
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,940
I saw a big banner for coke on the wall.

453
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,640
There's this big poster
in the jungle coal.

454
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,150
Oh yeah.

455
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,280
It's like this jungle store.

456
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,910
I mean,

457
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,650
I'm telling you it's the Yucatan.

458
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:38,420
It's like where the Mayan ruins
are even deepen their coca cola.

459
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:38,981
It's ever,

460
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:42,370
I mean it is one thing you could travel
anywhere and know that you'll get a nice

461
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:43,730
cold coca cola.

462
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,860
Well sometimes it's not cold,

463
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:45,340
but

464
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,280
who would have ever
predicted that sugary water?

465
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,580
Right?

466
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,860
It'd be such a massive hit with humans.

467
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,100
I mean that is the craziest
fucking business ever.

468
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,200
We did 11 it's like anyone can do that.

469
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,370
Like what they're doing.

470
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,091
It seems like.

471
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:01,540
Why would that even be specific to
like one company while you're doing it?

472
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,111
Good.

473
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:03,910
Like I went to the store
and not to the store.

474
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:07,210
I went to have brunch with a friend the
other day and I asked for a coke and the

475
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:08,710
guy brought me a glass.

476
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,400
Yeah.

477
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,851
And I was like,

478
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:11,530
this coke is so gross.

479
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:12,730
What is wrong with it?

480
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:15,670
And like he got me another one
and then finally I was like,

481
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:16,181
I don't know,

482
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:16,841
I don't like it.

483
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:17,561
You have to take it back.

484
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:17,921
And he was like,

485
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:18,790
well it's Pepsi.

486
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,151
And I was like,

487
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:20,170
when I ask you for a coke,

488
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:21,370
don't bring me a Pepsi.

489
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:21,850
Wow.

490
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,360
Is it kind of sweat it kind
of still have the Cola Pepsi,

491
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:26,110
you fraud,

492
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,943
it's not as good.

493
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:27,803
Yeah.

494
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,730
I don't think Pepsi is
allowed to use cocaine.

495
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,770
I don't think coke is any more.

496
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:33,820
I know they do.

497
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,560
Well they don't.

498
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:38,410
They use the leaves and they
extract the flavor from there.

499
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:43,411
One of the biggest providers of cocaine
to some medical facility that uses it

500
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:45,820
for medical cocaine.

501
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,730
That's so funny.

502
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,010
Extraction plants like the extraction
plants and they take the whatever the

503
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:55,060
flavonoids that gives it this
particular coca cola flavor.

504
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,000
I bet it's just a little bit of cocaine.

505
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,840
That's probably what gives you the burn
to not enough test positive but enough

506
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,340
for your brain and know something's there.

507
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,010
Well and can we,

508
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,560
can we talk about how fucked up
that is by the way that like,

509
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:06,921
you know,

510
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:07,331
we,

511
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:10,040
I all the time I came from
the neuroscience world,

512
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:15,070
so many labs do cocaine research but
they can't do marijuana research because

513
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:20,171
it's schedule one like it makes no sense
to me that cocaine is viewed as having

514
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:21,590
medicinal purposes.

515
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,830
But things like ecstasy and marijuana and
acid don't have any medicinal purposes

516
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,284
whatsoever.

517
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,001
Yeah.

518
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:33,580
But like very few labs can
do research with those drugs.

519
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,750
It's a weird position in 2012 because the,

520
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,450
the propaganda that led to that position,

521
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,850
it's not really arguable anymore.

522
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:43,780
It's too silly.

523
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:46,090
Like if you look at the
actual facts of it and you go,

524
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:46,780
come on,

525
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,470
you guys are your,

526
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,470
this is archaic and then you realize
that it's not really about as much as it

527
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,540
the legality of these things and the
moving them into position for legality,

528
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,040
it's that that eliminates a huge business.

529
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,260
The business of keeping it illegal
police officers and like gigantic private

530
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:15,761
prisons and this pharmaceutical companies
alone would lose millions and millions

531
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,360
of dollars every year.

532
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,751
That's true.

533
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,330
A lot of people make money off of
the fact that marijuana is not legal.

534
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:20,601
Well,

535
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:22,010
at least federally still.

536
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,960
But I wonder why it is that cocaine is
not classified as a schedule one drug.

537
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,570
Who wants,

538
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,790
because they believe it has a medical
uses medical who gets prescribed cocaine?

539
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,470
I don't know.

540
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,303
Nobody does.

541
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,500
I don't know.

542
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:34,930
I mean,

543
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,960
they use it for,

544
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,560
they use it in lab research all the
time to study of reward pathways,

545
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:40,910
to study dopamine pathways.

546
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:44,990
And it's interesting because I think in
like in every day kind of layman common

547
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:45,471
parlance,

548
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:46,820
you'll hear people say all the time,

549
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,181
oh,

550
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:48,680
that's so similar to cocaine.

551
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,861
Oh,

552
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,120
that's so similar to cocaine.

553
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:50,540
You know,

554
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,400
when you fall in love and
then you have a breakup,

555
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:54,150
the withdrawal symptoms
are much like cocaine.

556
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,310
It looks like that in the brain.

557
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:55,791
Well,

558
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:56,900
why do you think we know that?

559
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:59,960
It's because we use cocaine
to study everything.

560
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,260
Like cocaine is such a model
kind of molecule that's
used in the laboratory with

561
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,680
laboratory animals.

562
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,690
Every lab does coke research.

563
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,793
Wow,

564
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,810
that's crazy.

565
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:12,011
It's,

566
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:12,741
it's a really,

567
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:14,600
really easy way to study kind of,

568
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:14,841
um,

569
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,440
reward pathways in the brain show,

570
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,121
as you said,

571
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:18,020
a couple of scripts,

572
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,261
uh,

573
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:19,460
for cocaine prescriptions.

574
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,353
No way

575
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,361
inside joke,

576
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:23,870
I guess.

577
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,020
Yeah.

578
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,030
Got me the fuck

579
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,400
Josie.

580
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,150
What?

581
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,941
I really believe you.

582
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:30,070
Yeah.

583
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:30,910
For half a second.

584
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:31,460
Like what?

585
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,293
No,

586
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,670
it is,

587
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,911
it's,

588
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:34,091
well,

589
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,490
it's kind of crazy that you
can get them for marijuana.

590
00:16:36,491 --> 00:16:38,710
Marijuana is in such a
weird position right now.

591
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,820
I think there's like 18 different cities
or states rather than have made it

592
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,500
legal medically now

593
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,371
in Colorado,

594
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,860
made it legal recreation and we're
just just like a big fuck you to the

595
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,680
Washington state did as well.

596
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,300
Yeah.

597
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:51,820
Yeah.

598
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,061
Well,

599
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:52,331
it's,

600
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:52,841
it's just,

601
00:16:52,841 --> 00:16:53,340
uh,

602
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,600
it's only a matter of time like
that the scales are tipping.

603
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:55,901
I mean,

604
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:56,101
and,

605
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:57,310
and Obama is,

606
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,620
doesn't have another term in front of him.

607
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,780
Hopefully he won't do what Clinton did,

608
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:04,180
which was after he got
voted out of office.

609
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:04,580
Oh,

610
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:04,901
you know,

611
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:06,520
I really think maybe it should be legal.

612
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:06,760
It's like,

613
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,031
oh,

614
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:11,110
maybe if you had a position of power
where you could do something about that

615
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,890
zap position is extremely costly,

616
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,770
I think to take that
position as a politician,

617
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,130
the only thing he gets from you for you
is the love of your constituents because

618
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:23,790
you're being honest.

619
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,140
That's the only thing it gets for you.

620
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,080
But what if Obama decides to
never go back to the Senate?

621
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,390
What if he decides to go
back to working for the,

622
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:30,631
you know,

623
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:31,411
as a public servant,

624
00:17:31,411 --> 00:17:32,460
as a community organizer,

625
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:33,450
what does he have to lose?

626
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,380
Really?

627
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:34,641
Yeah.

628
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:34,890
What?

629
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,180
He doesn't have anything to lose.

630
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,570
So I want to see him like effect some
real change here in the second term,

631
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:39,770
I'm,

632
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,020
I'm,

633
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,710
I'm,

634
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,820
I would love to see that too,

635
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:42,451
but I just,

636
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:44,310
I know I'm a bit
disillusioned about it too,

637
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:44,850
but

638
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,450
they don't,

639
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,280
they don't ever seem
to be able to do that.

640
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,930
Even a guy like Obama,

641
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,531
just,

642
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:54,360
it was the perfect guy for if you wanted
to have a guy move into a position of

643
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:55,320
power like that,

644
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,440
that you thought would be
like a completely new face.

645
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,590
A guy who was born a
biracial of a single mother,

646
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,860
the whole deal came up,

647
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:05,251
poor,

648
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,061
worked hard,

649
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:07,230
it's very articulate,

650
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,900
didn't really have
anything wrong with them.

651
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,090
It's like a really bright guy,

652
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,020
a a lawyer.

653
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:13,854
Brilliant,

654
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,970
great speaker.

655
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:15,804
Perfect.

656
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,150
This guy's going to get used
to smoke while a lot of pot,

657
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,620
this guy's going to get an office,

658
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:21,330
she's going to sell
everybody the fuck down.

659
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,750
Yeah.

660
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,510
But then it gets in and it's like it,

661
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,770
it's almost like it's a job where
you don't get a chance to say what,

662
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,080
what really happened?

663
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:31,481
Yeah.

664
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:31,930
I mean it's,

665
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,920
it's probably really hard for us kind of
on the outside to know almost how much,

666
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,420
how,

667
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,190
how little power somebody actually
gets once they're elected in.

668
00:18:39,191 --> 00:18:39,331
And,

669
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:40,164
and I mean,

670
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,930
obviously I think that we need to be
putting the pressure on Obama hardcore at

671
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:46,390
this point because I think that
he's made a lot of fucking mistakes.

672
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,400
And I think that he needs to
clean up a lot of messages,

673
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:50,080
especially with like civil rights abuses,

674
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:51,100
especially with a lot of the,

675
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,143
I mean,

676
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,430
well I won't say what I'm thinking.

677
00:18:54,431 --> 00:18:54,641
Yeah,

678
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:55,121
exactly.

679
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:57,190
Civil liberties and I won't
say what I was about to say,

680
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:57,700
but um,

681
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,930
why not getting crazy?

682
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,570
I was about to go crazy,

683
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:02,230
so I'm going to dial it back a little.

684
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,220
But um,

685
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,791
but yeah,

686
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,460
I mean I think that at this
point it's kind of our job as,

687
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,830
as his constituency to
really put the heat on him.

688
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,410
I just don't know if there's
a really a president.

689
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,150
I don't know if it's real.

690
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,770
I don't know what I'm saying.

691
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,140
I have a feeling that that guy is

692
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,140
just working.

693
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,363
He's just,

694
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,120
I just think it's all so hard.

695
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,190
There's just too much money.

696
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:25,060
I think that's what it is.

697
00:19:25,061 --> 00:19:26,320
There's just too much,

698
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:28,600
much too long and they don't
want to stop making it.

699
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:28,930
Yeah.

700
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,950
Even though it's a logical,

701
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:31,180
and everybody knows the logical,

702
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:31,601
they'll still like,

703
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:33,430
we've got to go to war with
Iran and everybody's like,

704
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:35,170
what the fuck are you talking about?

705
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,650
Nobody wants to do it except the people
that can make a fuck load of money.

706
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:39,331
I think we're going to do it.

707
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:40,040
I don't think we're going to do,

708
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,990
I don't think we're going to do it.

709
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,260
No.

710
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,250
But I think that it would absolutely be
something that I wouldn't have to worry

711
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,750
about if Dick Cheney was in office.

712
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,000
I think you'd have to really
worried about us doing that.

713
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,950
Imagine a Pailin was an office.

714
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,600
I don't think they would let her talk.

715
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,960
I think they would figure
out a way to stop that shit.

716
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,410
Yeah.

717
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,640
They would figure out a way.

718
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,631
That one,

719
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:01,840
I think dial her down to
a reading shit off a tower

720
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,450
prompter.

721
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:02,571
Oh,

722
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:03,261
I just got a tweet.

723
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:04,790
Cocaine is used an eye surgery.

724
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,421
Oh yeah.

725
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:06,290
Cause it's an anesthetic.

726
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,190
Yeah.

727
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,860
Apparently there's a bunch of
different medical uses for dammit.

728
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,040
Shoving pencils in my eyes right now.

729
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,000
I've never done coke,

730
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:16,330
but I did do Lidocaine.

731
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:16,820
Yeah.

732
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,560
Um,

733
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,280
did have lighting.

734
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,250
I didn't do it like,

735
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:19,731
hey dude,

736
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:20,564
it's crazy.

737
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,840
But I had some in my body
because of the doctor.

738
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:24,820
I had my nose

739
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,611
start headed,

740
00:20:25,611 --> 00:20:26,060
uh,

741
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,870
opened up.

742
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,590
I had a deviated Septum and they
spray this lidocaine up there,

743
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,720
which numbs the inside,

744
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,270
you know,

745
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,103
and it's,

746
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,320
it's makes you feel fucking terrible,

747
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,610
whatever it is.

748
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,530
Like he just gets in your
system and you're just like,

749
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:39,901
oh.

750
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:40,790
And apparently,

751
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,780
um,

752
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,500
people have died from putting
that shit on their legs.

753
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,620
Like people have had like girls that
wanted to get like their legs lasered.

754
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,851
Oh God,

755
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,830
that shit all over their
legs then wrap it up,

756
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:57,970
but Saran wrap and you overdose on this
line of Cain Shit and you can actually

757
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:00,790
die from it or not.

758
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,900
Maybe I should Snopes that Alba now,

759
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:05,171
but,

760
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:05,530
uh,

761
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:05,730
it,

762
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:06,010
it,

763
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,560
I remember thinking how disgusting it was,

764
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:10,270
but it does numb the shit out of you,

765
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,200
which I guess,

766
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,440
uh,

767
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,070
apparently so does coke
does it Brian Coke.

768
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,870
Yeah.

769
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,703
Uh,

770
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,090
it makes,

771
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,290
it just makes me talk a lot.

772
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,970
I don't remember it numbing me though.

773
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:22,480
Cut.

774
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:22,990
Well,

775
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,823
I mean,

776
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,300
you can use it in your mouth.

777
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,340
Rubbing on your,

778
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:27,611
you know,

779
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:28,091
I saw,

780
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:32,800
have you seen Harold and
Kumar go to a Christmas one?

781
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:33,803
Oh,

782
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,760
there's a baby in it that's
doing cocaine and stuff.

783
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:39,580
And giving itself numbers and I
know how much you're like babies,

784
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:40,090
Joe,

785
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,200
I highly recommend that movie.

786
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:41,810
It's uh,

787
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:41,930
you're,

788
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,910
you're not a fan of babies.

789
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,091
Oh,

790
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:43,660
I love baby.

791
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,670
You love baby baby on coke.

792
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,160
If you like baby babies on
cocaine and doing ecstasy,

793
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:49,600
there's babies smoking weed,

794
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:50,434
doing ecstasy.

795
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,270
It's,

796
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,550
yeah,

797
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,590
it's the greatest thing in the
road that maybe he's hilarious.

798
00:21:53,591 --> 00:21:54,520
See it in three d though.

799
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,011
Um,

800
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:58,490
apparently a lot of cane definitely kills
people and in fact that guy was using

801
00:21:58,491 --> 00:21:59,181
it to a,

802
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:01,070
who was a murderer who used lidocaine.

803
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,070
He was injecting it into elderly patients.

804
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,413
Why?

805
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,170
To Kill Them.

806
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,420
Why did he want to murder
a bunch of elderly people?

807
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,490
I don't know.

808
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,330
It's like they're,

809
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,530
that that happens sometimes with nurses.

810
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,730
There's something really
weird that happens with nurses
or they resent their job

811
00:22:16,731 --> 00:22:17,211
or whatever.

812
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,290
Take it out on the people.

813
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,910
It's not just that I think,

814
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,833
I think,

815
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,800
I think there's a w for a lot
of people dealing with trauma.

816
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,250
Yeah.

817
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,900
Regular basis over and over again can
give you some really twisted ideas about

818
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:30,560
life.

819
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,120
Watching so many people's lives.

820
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:34,580
Past is just totally my speculation,

821
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:39,320
but I would think that if you were fucked
up to begin with and you got into that

822
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:40,190
line of work,

823
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,960
the combination of the two,

824
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,831
like I had,

825
00:22:42,831 --> 00:22:44,310
I had a friend who's,

826
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:49,330
he's an ophthalmologist and he did his
residency in Miami and it was during the

827
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:51,560
cocaine war days and he,

828
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,160
he's,

829
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,900
he would just come to me and just tell
me the shit that he saw and you would

830
00:22:56,901 --> 00:22:58,250
just have to shake your head.

831
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,760
Like just people just
torn to bits blown apart,

832
00:23:01,761 --> 00:23:06,380
stamped to death and he saw that
shit day after day sensitized to it.

833
00:23:06,381 --> 00:23:07,071
I'm sure.

834
00:23:07,071 --> 00:23:07,311
I mean,

835
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:08,144
how do you not?

836
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:13,150
And you want to have some power or some
excitement in your life so you're doing

837
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:17,810
something that you know is wrong but
you can't help yourself because it's a

838
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:20,900
thrill to see if he could pull
it off and they wind up doing,

839
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:23,180
it was like 2030 people
until they get Boston.

840
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,243
It's a sad,

841
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,220
there's been a bunch of cases like that.

842
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:26,691
All right.

843
00:23:26,691 --> 00:23:28,250
This has been like a bummer conversation.

844
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,550
Yes.

845
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,000
This is kind of bumming me out.

846
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:32,800
Yeah,

847
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,120
it's,

848
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,390
we went from cocaine,

849
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:35,380
medical use of cocaine.

850
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,550
So like murdering old people.

851
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:36,761
Well,

852
00:23:36,761 --> 00:23:36,861
like,

853
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:37,261
I don't know,

854
00:23:37,261 --> 00:23:40,140
I don't want to turn her in a
nursing home and it's really sad.

855
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:41,150
Very

856
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,560
sensitive obviously because you,

857
00:23:42,561 --> 00:23:43,394
um,

858
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,570
you said that you can't watch,

859
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:44,990
uh,

860
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,730
like MMA until you know the results.

861
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,080
I mean,

862
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,861
I have before,

863
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,540
it's definitely harder if
you know the person fighting.

864
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,050
Of course.

865
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,350
Right.

866
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,410
You're friends with Kang leads.

867
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:52,591
Yeah.

868
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:52,761
I'm,

869
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:53,231
I mean I'm,

870
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,080
I'm close to Kang Lee.

871
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:56,840
He is like best friends with somebody
who's really important in my life.

872
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:59,120
So I've gotten to be close to
him over about the last year.

873
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,080
Um,

874
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,580
and his last fight in China,

875
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:03,260
obviously I couldn't watch it live anyway.

876
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:03,950
Yeah.

877
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,880
But I kind of waited until I knew what
happened and then was really excited to

878
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:08,421
watch it,

879
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:09,920
but I don't want to see him get hurt.

880
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:10,561
Yeah.

881
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:11,580
He's a great guy.

882
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,750
He's a great guy.

883
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:13,260
Like he's,

884
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,550
he's got a great character.

885
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:15,050
That guy,

886
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,010
he's like so sweet.

887
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:16,844
He's amazing.

888
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,870
He's tough.

889
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,330
I mean,

890
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:18,920
a Burrito,

891
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,820
but you don't really,

892
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:20,660
you wouldn't know it.

893
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,601
Well,

894
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:22,010
you know,

895
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,330
which just my going in on the side.

896
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:23,480
Yeah.

897
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,820
Act like a tough guy.

898
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,160
No,

899
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,210
he's tough as fuck.

900
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:27,290
And he's 40 years old.

901
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,100
40,

902
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,460
you know,

903
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,930
like doing movies still and shit.

904
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,580
Yeah.

905
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,630
Well and he's kicking ass,

906
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,721
which is pretty crazy.

907
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:32,830
Yeah.

908
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,100
Yeah.

909
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,980
That's amazing.

910
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,600
I bet him mean he's doing both.

911
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:36,434
Like he's like,

912
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,293
he's,

913
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,420
I mean he's still pretty new in m and,

914
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,273
and um,

915
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,310
in UFC isn't he?

916
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:42,521
I mean,

917
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:43,720
he was a strike force for many years.

918
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,310
Yes.

919
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:44,551
Yeah.

920
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:45,810
He's only had a couple of fights.

921
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:48,630
He's had three fights in the
UFC now and I won his last two.

922
00:24:48,631 --> 00:24:48,760
Right.

923
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,080
Yeah.

924
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,501
Awesome.

925
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:50,250
And he looks great.

926
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:50,430
Yeah.

927
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,490
I mean that the rich Franklin
fight was incredibly ridiculous.

928
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,630
I know it was one of the,

929
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,640
one of the best one punch knock outs ever.

930
00:24:56,641 --> 00:24:58,380
And to do it to a guy like Franklin,

931
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,880
it's really impressive.

932
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,000
I wonder if it's fun.

933
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,410
A lot of people from like huge,

934
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:03,370
huge MMA fans.

935
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:04,204
I wonder,

936
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,800
is it more exciting or kind of a let
down when there's a knockout like in the

937
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:09,634
first row?

938
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,500
Um,

939
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,160
it's,

940
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,550
well,

941
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,000
you would,

942
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,050
you'd like to see a longer fight and
then knock out if you want to see like,

943
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:17,341
you know,

944
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:19,380
some people love to see just mastery.

945
00:25:19,381 --> 00:25:23,130
Some people love to see a guy like
Anderson Silva just run someone over.

946
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,030
And some people like to see like
a Frankie Edgar Gray Maynard war.

947
00:25:27,031 --> 00:25:28,260
Like everybody has their own,

948
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:30,390
like how they like to see fights play out.

949
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,270
Some people like to see someone
win and not get hurt at all.

950
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,060
But that's kind of a crazy
thing when Anderson Silva,

951
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,400
Anderson Silva does almost every fight.

952
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,320
I would prefer to see.

953
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:39,430
I,

954
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,930
yeah,

955
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,340
he wins and he never even gets hurt.

956
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:43,350
He fucks everybody up and it never even,

957
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,011
I mean,

958
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:47,220
he's the most ridiculous
example of a guy who wins,

959
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:50,250
like in spectacular fashion
and doesn't even get hit.

960
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,101
I just,

961
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:51,371
you know,

962
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:51,701
I think,

963
00:25:51,701 --> 00:25:53,350
I think part of it for me is that,

964
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:53,561
you know,

965
00:25:53,561 --> 00:25:53,741
when,

966
00:25:53,741 --> 00:25:54,251
when it's somebody,

967
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:54,731
you know,

968
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:56,620
it's hard to see somebody take a punch.

969
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,540
It's hard to see somebody
break a bone or whatever.

970
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,950
But also I think because of my background
in the field that I come from and

971
00:26:02,951 --> 00:26:05,950
studying neurobiology and working
with people with brain injury,

972
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,570
when I watched these fights,

973
00:26:07,571 --> 00:26:09,550
that's all I can think
about the whole time.

974
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:09,850
It's like,

975
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:10,211
oh,

976
00:26:10,211 --> 00:26:10,840
concussion,

977
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,620
oh God.

978
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,210
Twisted head in motion injury.

979
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:13,631
You know,

980
00:26:13,631 --> 00:26:17,770
and I'm just so nervous for the fighters
cause it's just let's go in this ring

981
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,220
and get some brain injury.

982
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,143
Jason Smith,

983
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,133
someone's out there.

984
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,083
Oh,

985
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,050
I forgot to lock the front door.

986
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,490
Somebody here to see us.

987
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:26,900
No,

988
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,730
no.

989
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,710
Some random dude.

990
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,190
Ah,

991
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,023
um,

992
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,600
the,

993
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,020
uh,

994
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,490
the,

995
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:31,800
the,

996
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,800
the real issue isn't even
just the fights themselves,

997
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,370
it's getting prepared for the fights.

998
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:36,991
You know,

999
00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:37,291
the,

1000
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:37,620
uh,

1001
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,620
the subconcussive trauma that you get
over and over and over again really piles

1002
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,950
itself on even a little thug.

1003
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,500
Yeah,

1004
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,041
it's rough.

1005
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:46,171
I,

1006
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:46,941
I did a piece,

1007
00:26:46,941 --> 00:26:47,420
um,

1008
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,231
for my column,

1009
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,800
I do a video series that Huffington post
called talk nerdy to me every week I do

1010
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:52,430
a video.

1011
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:52,850
Um,

1012
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,290
and one of the pieces really,

1013
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:58,580
really early on that I did was about kind
of this concussive injury more in like

1014
00:26:58,581 --> 00:26:59,990
football players and boxers.

1015
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,740
Um,

1016
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,970
and the,

1017
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,430
how it mimics als symptoms,

1018
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:05,001
you know how it,

1019
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:07,550
it starts to look like Lou
Gehrig's disease after a while.

1020
00:27:07,551 --> 00:27:09,830
And even though they think it's
kind of a separate disorder,

1021
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,350
it has the same outcome,

1022
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,850
which is so scary.

1023
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,501
Yeah,

1024
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:14,800
it's,

1025
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,320
it's a,

1026
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,770
it's a very scary guys have
to know when to get out there.

1027
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:17,990
Really.

1028
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,360
Do,

1029
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,090
you got to know when they get out and
you have to get medical examinations and

1030
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,830
stay up to date on all your,

1031
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,670
you know,

1032
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,000
all,

1033
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,930
all your checkups and neurological
checkups and stuff like that because it's,

1034
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,840
it's,

1035
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,360
it's a,

1036
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,200
it's a big gamble.

1037
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,440
Yeah.

1038
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,580
And that's why it's so exciting.

1039
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,630
It's so exciting.

1040
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,160
Nobody knows how much is on the line

1041
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,850
and that's why nobody
wants to see huge changes.

1042
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:40,200
Like in the NFL for example,

1043
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:43,200
I actually got to be kind of Internet
friends with Steve Gleason after I did

1044
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:43,771
that piece.

1045
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:47,280
It was an ex NFL player who actually
suffers from these injuries now.

1046
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:50,370
And he's got a foundation where he
really tries to educate people about it.

1047
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:51,390
So we kind of tweet a lot,

1048
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,570
but that's why I don't think you'll
ever see football players going back to

1049
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:55,920
wearing leather helmets for example,

1050
00:27:55,921 --> 00:28:00,240
which would completely cut down on
concussive head injury is because people

1051
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:01,150
wouldn't be charging with their head.

1052
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:01,530
Yeah,

1053
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,720
so hard for people to wrap
their heads around that.

1054
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:06,240
The idea less padding
would actually be safer.

1055
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:06,680
Exactly.

1056
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,530
That's the argument.

1057
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:09,690
Also for the UFC gloves you,

1058
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:09,871
you,

1059
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:10,200
you,

1060
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,140
you can't hit a guy as
many times you will eat.

1061
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,003
You can't find them.

1062
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,960
You'll break your hand and
hit him in certain spots.

1063
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,900
It's one of the reasons why actually
bare knuckle fighting is probably the

1064
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:19,920
safest way to do it.

1065
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,530
It just looks so barbaric.

1066
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,373
Tip does,

1067
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,310
when you tighten up your fist and rapid,

1068
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,930
you actually make it a better weapon.

1069
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,100
You make it so it doesn't break as easily,

1070
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,420
so you have to be less judicious
with where you know we're,

1071
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:34,440
we're less accurate.

1072
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:37,330
You can punch people in the arms
and not hurt your hands as well.

1073
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:37,710
Yeah.

1074
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,540
I always put my thumb in
the middle of of this.

1075
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,800
That's just where my rings.

1076
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,910
Just crazy gangster goth rings,

1077
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,920
dragons and Shit.

1078
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,110
Yeah.

1079
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,380
I think the human body's
not really designed for it,

1080
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,620
but it's the best way to
test the human character.

1081
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,410
That's why it's so like
exciting viscerally.

1082
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,191
You know,

1083
00:28:59,191 --> 00:29:00,870
like when you see a guy fight,

1084
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,570
like you know everything about him,

1085
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,141
you know,

1086
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:05,970
you know what he's capable of,

1087
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:06,481
you know,

1088
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:10,980
like you know that when you see
someone like do something that's really

1089
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:13,320
spectacular in an MMA fight,

1090
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,560
the difficulty of doing that and pulling
that off on another train killer when

1091
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:20,610
you watch like an Anderson Silva fight,

1092
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,690
the spectacular nature that
he goes about doing that.

1093
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,900
To me it's like the most exciting artwork
because I know how much is on the line

1094
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:33,690
in order to create this performance.

1095
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,800
But when he does it,

1096
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:37,410
it's literally like a work of art.

1097
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,750
Like I look at it the same
way someone would look at it.

1098
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:40,980
Incredible sculpture.

1099
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,581
Unfortunately,

1100
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:42,060
I don't think

1101
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,210
that everybody looks at it that way and
I think that it does just kind of have

1102
00:29:45,211 --> 00:29:47,280
this like Roman Coliseum,

1103
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:47,851
you know,

1104
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:48,571
draw to it,

1105
00:29:48,571 --> 00:29:49,051
which is just,

1106
00:29:49,051 --> 00:29:51,120
I want to see two people
fuck each other up.

1107
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,240
I want to get my aggressions out
by watching somebody else do that.

1108
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:59,370
I blame that on a lack of understanding
of a martial arts and I think that the,

1109
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,400
the way to fix that would be to teach
it to everybody from the time they're

1110
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,234
little kids.

1111
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,290
And I think that should be a
curriculum in school for boys.

1112
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,100
Well,

1113
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,920
absolutely.

1114
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,753
Yeah.

1115
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:15,290
You can do martial arts without getting
a head injury when you're young.

1116
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:15,501
You know,

1117
00:30:15,501 --> 00:30:18,830
you don't have to actually take a hit
because boys are angry and that's true.

1118
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,870
Girls usually aren't that
random bitches though.

1119
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:21,704
When they're young,

1120
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,010
they're angry in different ways.

1121
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:24,050
I'm more like chatty,

1122
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:24,884
angry,

1123
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,180
unless some girls are aggressive,

1124
00:30:26,181 --> 00:30:26,541
angry.

1125
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:29,870
It's like those black chicks on Worldstar
hip hop.com I've never seen that.

1126
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,090
You never know.

1127
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,743
Are they aggressive?

1128
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,180
Pull one up and watched some
girl get the fuck out of her.

1129
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,880
That's impossible.

1130
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,010
We might crash the Internet.

1131
00:30:40,011 --> 00:30:40,844
Listen,

1132
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:41,690
I think.

1133
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,523
I can imagine.

1134
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,433
You can imagine.

1135
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,730
You can imagine one of them.

1136
00:30:46,731 --> 00:30:51,320
You can't imagine the fucking beating
she puts on this girl and the speed and

1137
00:30:51,321 --> 00:30:52,154
when she does it,

1138
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,900
it's so terrible and smiling now.

1139
00:30:53,901 --> 00:30:55,190
But if you actually show it to me,

1140
00:30:55,191 --> 00:30:58,410
it's going to be really
depressing what we want.

1141
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,830
We don't have to live
this poor girl's misery.

1142
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:04,730
But apparently some girl was talking shit
and so this girl came over her house.

1143
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,260
She pulls her out of her house.

1144
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,610
I mean within seconds
she's hit her 2030 times.

1145
00:31:10,611 --> 00:31:11,444
Just

1146
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,560
then you're over and over and over.

1147
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,160
Grabs her by her hair drags or
down the stairs and then says,

1148
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:19,090
talk about dad.

1149
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:19,924
Whoa.

1150
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,790
It was a fight.

1151
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:25,421
I can't,

1152
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:28,030
that's hard for me to
empathize the way you look.

1153
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:30,580
I haven't been in one since
I was a young boy myself,

1154
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,710
but the,

1155
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:36,460
the knowing how to fight with
protector from all that shit,

1156
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,020
it wouldn't have happened.

1157
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,310
She would have clinched,

1158
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,900
ticking that girl down.

1159
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:41,930
Headbutted her,

1160
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,430
got her a Chubb put her out.

1161
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,360
But if she knew how to defend herself,

1162
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,880
she was attacked and she didn't
know how to defend herself with him.

1163
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:50,320
That's why it was such a vicious beat.

1164
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:50,981
I think there's this,

1165
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:53,260
there's a switch in some
people's minds where,

1166
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:57,100
where being on the defensive
feels like being on the offensive,

1167
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,201
you know,

1168
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:00,610
kind of as a thought experiment.

1169
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:00,771
You know,

1170
00:32:00,771 --> 00:32:01,720
I'm very anti gun,

1171
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,380
right?

1172
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,820
Like I don't want to own a gun.

1173
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,120
I don't want to see a gun.

1174
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:06,100
I don't want to be near a gun.

1175
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,211
And people always say,

1176
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:07,571
yeah,

1177
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:09,070
but what happens if somebody,

1178
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,371
you know,

1179
00:32:09,371 --> 00:32:11,320
there's a home invasion armed,

1180
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:11,951
what would you do?

1181
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:12,640
And it's like,

1182
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,390
I dunno.

1183
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:13,961
I mean,

1184
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:14,980
I know it sounds crazy,

1185
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:19,180
but I might rather get shot than to
have to kill somebody to take somebody's

1186
00:32:19,181 --> 00:32:19,511
life.

1187
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:20,650
Like I just don't think I could do it.

1188
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,210
I don't think I could do it.

1189
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,770
And I wonder if other people feel,

1190
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:23,981
I mean,

1191
00:32:23,981 --> 00:32:24,560
most people have,

1192
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,031
oh yeah,

1193
00:32:25,031 --> 00:32:25,660
fuck that.

1194
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,770
I'm going to kill that guy before,

1195
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:27,011
you know.

1196
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,500
But I wonder if you're
actually faced with that,

1197
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,230
if you,

1198
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:30,910
if you would,

1199
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,760
if you would want to.

1200
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,960
That kind of survival instinct kicks in.

1201
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,640
I think as humans we've kind of evolved.

1202
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:38,900
We,

1203
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,190
we've bred out

1204
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,160
a lot of the survival instincts
that our ancestors had.

1205
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,701
You know,

1206
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:44,210
I,

1207
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,860
we do fight to stay alive,

1208
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:46,940
but for example,

1209
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:49,370
if you look at the way
little kids grow up,

1210
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,390
little kids need their parents for
years and years and years and years.

1211
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,950
Like not until they're probably

1212
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,820
in there maybe like just before they're
10 11 could they even maybe survive on

1213
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:02,241
the streets?

1214
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:02,751
And even then,

1215
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:03,590
that would be tough,

1216
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:03,951
you know?

1217
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:05,000
But definitely a four year old,

1218
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:07,640
a five year old could never figure out
how to feed themselves to take care of

1219
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:08,180
themselves.

1220
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,010
Whereas if you look in the animal kingdom,

1221
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,560
it's within months that
most animals are weaned.

1222
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,160
We just,

1223
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,990
we weave in order to,

1224
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:18,620
I think have these more complex thoughts
and these more complex abilities.

1225
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,401
As humans,

1226
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:21,980
we have language and we have art and
we have music and we have philosophy.

1227
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,430
We're not so good at the
survival stuff anymore.

1228
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,240
And I dunno,

1229
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,631
I just,

1230
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:28,670
I don't feel that drive in me.

1231
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,970
And I think that if faced with death
or what I would consider to be murder,

1232
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:35,630
even if it was in self defense,

1233
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:36,464
I dunno.

1234
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,640
Well that's a tough decision

1235
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,900
either you and your own
individual point of view,

1236
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:45,901
which is extreme and well thought out
or I don't think that's represented.

1237
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,000
It might.

1238
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,340
Yeah,

1239
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,173
it's probably,

1240
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,223
it's probably not.

1241
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,030
I wonder how many girls
would say the same thing.

1242
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:52,790
It's pretty rare.

1243
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,350
I think so.

1244
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:53,740
Yeah.

1245
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,500
I think you're,

1246
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:54,780
you're,

1247
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,240
you're,

1248
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,900
I don't think that's your position
has represented by most people.

1249
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,620
Maybe not.

1250
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,390
Most people will like tell you about like,

1251
00:34:01,391 --> 00:34:01,731
fuck that.

1252
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:02,564
I'm going to kill that guy.

1253
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,050
Incredible things they've
done to stay alive.

1254
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,430
Yeah,

1255
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:05,671
no,

1256
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:06,181
that's true.

1257
00:34:06,181 --> 00:34:08,910
And I bet you you do have that
instinct that really does kick in.

1258
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:09,420
Like,

1259
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:09,721
you know,

1260
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:11,640
I'm the guy who cut off his own arm,

1261
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:11,971
you know,

1262
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:13,500
from 127 thank you.

1263
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:14,040
Would too.

1264
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,490
I might,

1265
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,323
I might cut off.

1266
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,543
You're,

1267
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,133
I think you're,

1268
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,090
the way you're looking at it is looking
at it in the way of a person who just

1269
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:25,880
does not have it in them to harm a person.

1270
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,230
You don't have it in there.

1271
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:27,891
I might not,

1272
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:28,310
I don't know.

1273
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:33,310
But you have to take into consideration
that human beings are so fucking complex

1274
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:39,970
that sometimes one of us goes off the
rails into the woods and needs to be put

1275
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:40,670
down.

1276
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,091
And you know what?

1277
00:34:41,091 --> 00:34:41,924
I'm not a mother.

1278
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,340
I wonder if I had a child,

1279
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:43,581
if,

1280
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,390
if that whole idea would change because
all of a sudden if I'm not protecting

1281
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:47,751
myself,

1282
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:48,560
but I'm protecting,

1283
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,100
you know,

1284
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,380
my,

1285
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,121
my child,

1286
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,490
that all of a sudden I'd become like
this crazy bitch and I would defend

1287
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:53,360
anything to the desk.

1288
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,320
Be Protecting the fact that your child
would be horrified if you weren't around.

1289
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,100
That's true.

1290
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,490
Yeah.

1291
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,180
That's something that you think
of when you were growing up.

1292
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,340
Um,

1293
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:01,911
yeah.

1294
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:03,170
You would fight to the death.

1295
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,980
Do you have kids?

1296
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,370
Yes,

1297
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,040
you do.

1298
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,873
And you have that like,

1299
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,021
oh,

1300
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,490
the tents instinct to protect them.

1301
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:07,821
Oh,

1302
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:08,571
it's crazy.

1303
00:35:08,571 --> 00:35:09,650
It's a crazy instinct.

1304
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:10,670
Do you love them so much?

1305
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:10,931
I mean it's,

1306
00:35:10,931 --> 00:35:12,380
it's really hard to understand.

1307
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,810
Yeah.

1308
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,330
I just thought I understood
it because of dogs relative.

1309
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:15,490
Yeah.

1310
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:15,641
Yeah.

1311
00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:16,720
I've got a dog who I love,

1312
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:17,210
but like,

1313
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,043
Eh,

1314
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:19,850
can I,

1315
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,320
I'm like on a drug when I
play with my two year old,

1316
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,190
it's like a drug.

1317
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:23,790
Yeah.

1318
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:24,000
No.

1319
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,620
And my four year old
is like a little human.

1320
00:35:25,621 --> 00:35:28,570
We have like little conversations
about things about life.

1321
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,150
We talk about stars.

1322
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:30,451
Yeah.

1323
00:35:30,451 --> 00:35:32,430
And they're still like the
sooner the inner science,

1324
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,140
the four year old is into everything.

1325
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:34,350
Yeah.

1326
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:34,660
She's,

1327
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,450
she's really,

1328
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,610
I feel like little kids
are little scientists.

1329
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,940
That's the coolest thing about them is
that they have just this kind of natural

1330
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:46,110
instinct to think scientifically about
the world and they want answers to

1331
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:46,621
everything.

1332
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:49,080
They just explore everything and
they're not satisfied either.

1333
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:51,180
If you give them an answer
that does not satisfy them,

1334
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:51,720
they'll be like,

1335
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,553
not good enough.

1336
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,393
But why

1337
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,221
I have,

1338
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:58,000
I've had the boat why conversation like
over and over and over again as to why

1339
00:35:58,001 --> 00:36:01,840
people live in cities and why some
people don't live like we were driving.

1340
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:02,860
To the mountains like,

1341
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,041
well,

1342
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:05,950
why are these people living
in the place like this?

1343
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,480
How come they don't want
to live in the city?

1344
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,230
You know,

1345
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,160
I want to live in the city.

1346
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:10,480
Well,

1347
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,760
they're trying to figure out like
where is there a good place to live?

1348
00:36:12,761 --> 00:36:14,170
Like the four year olds are going like,

1349
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:15,004
is this this thing?

1350
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,070
Where's the spot to live?

1351
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,323
It's like,

1352
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:17,621
she's like,

1353
00:36:17,621 --> 00:36:21,670
it seems like you can live it a lot of
fucking pot and seeing like a four year

1354
00:36:21,671 --> 00:36:22,990
old put that together.

1355
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,011
It's a,

1356
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:24,760
it's a,

1357
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,870
it's a mind fuck

1358
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:27,600
and you're absolutely right.

1359
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:29,990
That was a brilliant way of putting it
in that they're like little scientists

1360
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:30,981
because they have to be,

1361
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:35,510
they're trying to piece together
their view of the world from scratch,

1362
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,720
you know?

1363
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,230
Yeah.

1364
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,310
Can you imagine going back,

1365
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:39,220
I feel that like have you,

1366
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,320
have you ever done acid?

1367
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:40,801
No,

1368
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:41,130
I've never,

1369
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:41,963
nobody in the room.

1370
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,690
I used to sell bibles of it.

1371
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:51,090
I think that that's the draw for some
people when they do psychedelics.

1372
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:53,350
But I would say specifically LSD as,

1373
00:36:53,351 --> 00:36:57,360
as compared to other psychedelics because
one of the central features that I

1374
00:36:57,361 --> 00:36:58,021
always found,

1375
00:36:58,021 --> 00:37:00,780
and I haven't done anything like
that since late high school,

1376
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:01,381
early college,

1377
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:04,920
but one of the central features
that I always found was that you,

1378
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,630
everything's kind of new again,

1379
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,660
like you don't really understand
why things are the way they are.

1380
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,180
Like you'll find yourself staring at
your hand for 20 minutes going like,

1381
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:14,790
I have fingers and they
move and I can grab things.

1382
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,230
Holy Shit.

1383
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,130
And um,

1384
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:17,731
and yeah,

1385
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:21,780
I remember one time a friend driving
somewhere far away with a bunch of,

1386
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,250
were all on acid and it was like,

1387
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:23,730
we have to,

1388
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,660
we had to get gas.

1389
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,910
And it was like the weirdest
thing because money,

1390
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,250
these pieces of paper have value.

1391
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:31,590
Like it was very confusing to everybody,

1392
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,251
but it was,

1393
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:32,940
it was such an,

1394
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,060
it's always such an
interesting experience to,

1395
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:35,640
you know,

1396
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,970
everything's so new and you have to
piece it together and make sense of the

1397
00:37:38,971 --> 00:37:39,541
world around you.

1398
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:43,080
And of course you have epiphany after
it just constantly epiphany's like you

1399
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:45,540
just think that you're the most brilliant
person in the world because you're

1400
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:50,150
figuring everything out and you document
it and you sober up the next day and

1401
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,180
you're shitting herself.

1402
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:53,280
Crying could be,

1403
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:53,910
but I've never had,

1404
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,410
I've never had one of those terms.

1405
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,360
[inaudible] Columbus,

1406
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:57,841
Ohio,

1407
00:37:57,841 --> 00:37:58,674
the worst,

1408
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,310
the worst trip that I had was a
really long trip and it was just,

1409
00:38:02,311 --> 00:38:07,050
I was grimy and I was just over it and
I was trying to sober up cause I had to

1410
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,580
work the next day and I hadn't slept.

1411
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,850
And when I was younger I used to
dye my hair a lot of crazy colors.

1412
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:13,410
I kept it really short and dyed it a lot.

1413
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,900
It's a little like punk
rocker raver chick.

1414
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,230
And I remember taking a shower cause I
thought it would sober me up and my hair

1415
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:20,370
was like blood red.

1416
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,120
And so I took the shower and wash my
hair and just all this red shit was going

1417
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:26,310
down the drain and it
really flipped me out.

1418
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:29,970
But it was so late in the trip
that I worked my way through it.

1419
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,710
I've never had a scary
like shitting myself trim.

1420
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,190
That sounds awful.

1421
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:35,671
Yeah.

1422
00:38:35,671 --> 00:38:36,360
I knew

1423
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,770
a couple people that had lost a fucking
minds on drugs when I was a kid,

1424
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:45,150
so I was really hesitant
until I was in my thirties.

1425
00:38:45,151 --> 00:38:46,410
I never even smoked pot.

1426
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,750
I had a friend who,

1427
00:38:48,751 --> 00:38:48,960
uh,

1428
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,960
was in my neighborhood who sold coke
and I've watched him go from this like

1429
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,200
carefree,

1430
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:55,801
fun,

1431
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:56,581
loving guys.

1432
00:38:56,581 --> 00:38:57,391
Always fun to be around.

1433
00:38:57,391 --> 00:38:58,200
Yeah.

1434
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,370
To being this withered away.

1435
00:38:59,371 --> 00:38:59,880
Weird.

1436
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,020
Well,

1437
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,181
yeah,

1438
00:39:00,181 --> 00:39:02,160
those are two very different drugs.

1439
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,850
She's hiding in his attic
and doing coke all the time.

1440
00:39:05,851 --> 00:39:06,684
It's like girls,

1441
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,151
I mean,

1442
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:07,551
coke is,

1443
00:39:07,551 --> 00:39:08,430
is similar.

1444
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:08,941
It's weaker,

1445
00:39:08,941 --> 00:39:10,620
but it's similar to math and you see,

1446
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:10,831
I mean,

1447
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:13,560
math is like the most disgusting
compound on the planet.

1448
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:13,831
I mean,

1449
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:15,660
it fucks people's lives up.

1450
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,523
What do you wait

1451
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,340
gun this m d p v stuff
that McAfee was accused.

1452
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,800
I don't really know anything
about it to be honest.

1453
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:25,780
I haven't taken the
time to really study it.

1454
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:28,420
I mean it sounds kind of nuts but that's,

1455
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:28,900
you know,

1456
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:33,370
that's what people do is they find the
newest compound and because a lot of

1457
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,930
times you can get things more readily
you their legal until kind of the feds

1458
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:40,270
catch on to it and they
have to start outlining it.

1459
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,323
When I was growing up,

1460
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,870
we used to do um,

1461
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:47,380
uh DXM all the time dextromethorphan
cause you could get it in,

1462
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:51,070
in over the counter cough
medicine and it was like weed,

1463
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:51,820
ketamine,

1464
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,560
Robo Turban,

1465
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,560
robot tripping or we would take chorus
sit in which were the little red pills,

1466
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,700
little red devils and yeah,

1467
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,650
I mean and and it's a
dissociative anesthetic.

1468
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:01,330
It like no totally fucks you up.

1469
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,580
You take it annually or did
you take it through your mouth?

1470
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,840
We took it orally.

1471
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:09,400
We prefer her to just shut them up and
cause they would dissolve in your ass.

1472
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:09,701
Yeah.

1473
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:10,090
That's,

1474
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:10,960
that sounds like a boy.

1475
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,130
How many of your girlfriends
did that with you and

1476
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,873
believe that?

1477
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,880
I believe that don't get to put like
tampons soaked and vodka like that's

1478
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,890
gotten really sick from that.

1479
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,120
I try.

1480
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,960
It's a bit drunk.

1481
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:26,321
Pussy.

1482
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:27,154
Can you imagine?

1483
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,790
Uh,

1484
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,510
that's really,

1485
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,530
that's the real term.

1486
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:30,101
Drunk Pussy,

1487
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:30,641
that's what they call it.

1488
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:31,474
But boys,

1489
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,320
they have to do it in their ass strongly.

1490
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,670
The tech knows what I
do tampons with Tampa.

1491
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,490
Well that it's,

1492
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,840
it's probably smoke tampon.

1493
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,070
It makes the most sense.

1494
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:40,690
I mean yeah to be honest.

1495
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,490
But just do girls do it in their
ass or do they do in their vagina?

1496
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,040
No,

1497
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,280
it sounds like it would burn.

1498
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,480
I think they're doing in their vagina.

1499
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:46,900
You're right.

1500
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,090
Yeah.

1501
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:47,651
She'll make no,

1502
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:48,200
she's got one.

1503
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,940
I've got one of the day.

1504
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,780
It sounds like it would burn.

1505
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:53,370
It would probably be burned on the other
thing that probably just all around the

1506
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:53,751
store.

1507
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:58,510
And why would you put vodka in your be
cause I get your drinks so much that you

1508
00:40:58,511 --> 00:40:59,240
can't get drunk.

1509
00:40:59,240 --> 00:40:59,960
Dude.

1510
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,970
You know how fucking

1511
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,730
crazy do you have to be
to be like you know what?

1512
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:04,481
Fuck shots.

1513
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:05,314
It's got to go on by.

1514
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:05,780
Yeah,

1515
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,260
I know.

1516
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:06,820
I know.

1517
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,990
You will get great if man,

1518
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:10,870
how the fuck,

1519
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,000
how like self destructive
do you have to be?

1520
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,220
I know what you have to be young and dumb,

1521
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,630
but why in your ass?

1522
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,483
I don't,

1523
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:18,951
I never,

1524
00:41:18,951 --> 00:41:20,450
I never put any drugs up my ass,

1525
00:41:20,451 --> 00:41:22,790
but I do remember like snorting a,

1526
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,301
you know,

1527
00:41:23,301 --> 00:41:24,480
an ecstasy tablet.

1528
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:25,760
Like why did I need to start it?

1529
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,530
Why couldn't I just swallow?

1530
00:41:27,531 --> 00:41:28,720
It was again,

1531
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,170
I wasn't going to hit me fast enough.

1532
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:31,521
You know?

1533
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:32,960
It's like we do stupid shit when,

1534
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:33,370
yeah,

1535
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:33,630
sure.

1536
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,200
Snorting

1537
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:34,950
Adderall.

1538
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,770
That's another thing.

1539
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,700
I remember going to this party and all
the girls were snorting Adderall because

1540
00:41:38,701 --> 00:41:39,700
they couldn't get coke and,

1541
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:39,920
okay.

1542
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,431
Wow.

1543
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,181
That's so crazy.

1544
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:41,811
What did they do,

1545
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:43,470
like clean the house and do her homework.

1546
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,980
Bad idea at a party.

1547
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,170
I've never done that.

1548
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:47,760
Are All either.

1549
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,310
Right.

1550
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:48,911
My friend,

1551
00:41:48,911 --> 00:41:53,590
the late great Robert Schimmel told me
that he took one accidentally once and

1552
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:56,050
Robert had a health conditions,

1553
00:41:56,051 --> 00:41:56,300
you know,

1554
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,840
he had cancer for awhile.

1555
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:58,683
Yeah.

1556
00:41:58,770 --> 00:41:59,170
Um,

1557
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,003
and so,

1558
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:00,220
you know,

1559
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,380
he didn't know if this is like
dangerous for him to take.

1560
00:42:02,381 --> 00:42:05,170
So he calls his doctor
and his doctor said,

1561
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:05,711
listen,

1562
00:42:05,711 --> 00:42:06,131
it's just,

1563
00:42:06,131 --> 00:42:06,850
you took it,

1564
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,840
you're going to be fine.

1565
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:10,030
But you know you're on a
ride for the next 12 hours.

1566
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:10,420
Yeah,

1567
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:10,871
and he goes,

1568
00:42:10,871 --> 00:42:12,010
I got so much.

1569
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:12,900
Oh,

1570
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,150
okay.

1571
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:13,581
I was like,

1572
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:15,170
I cleaned my office,

1573
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:16,820
I organize my notes.

1574
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:19,430
I was putting them into
folders and categories.

1575
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,830
It's like subtle meth behavior.

1576
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:22,160
Yeah,

1577
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,971
it really is.

1578
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:23,481
And that's the thing.

1579
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:25,130
These kids take it every day.

1580
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,300
They take it every day.

1581
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:28,880
They're on low levels of math every day.

1582
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:29,840
Oh my God.

1583
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,010
It's perfectly legal.

1584
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:34,070
And their parents tell them to though
you behave much better when you're on

1585
00:42:34,071 --> 00:42:34,311
this,

1586
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:34,731
you know?

1587
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:35,570
And I mean,

1588
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:36,110
it's nuts.

1589
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,370
I've never been one,

1590
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:37,761
you know,

1591
00:42:37,761 --> 00:42:38,271
like I said,

1592
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:39,200
I haven't done drugs in many,

1593
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:39,651
many years,

1594
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:40,670
but when I did do drugs,

1595
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:43,250
I wa I was much more
into downers than uppers.

1596
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:46,280
Like uppers make made me jittery.

1597
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:47,780
That made me feel like
shit and I couldn't sleep,

1598
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,650
which I hated.

1599
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,450
I love drugs that you could
just follow us expression.

1600
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,230
Okay.

1601
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:51,680
I have,

1602
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,401
I have done,

1603
00:42:52,401 --> 00:42:53,270
ketamine was correct.

1604
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,010
I did not like it.

1605
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:55,590
I hate it.

1606
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:55,690
Yeah,

1607
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:56,510
I snorted it.

1608
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,190
I did not like it at all.

1609
00:42:58,191 --> 00:42:59,420
I felt so sick.

1610
00:42:59,480 --> 00:42:59,931
I was in,

1611
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:01,460
I went into a hole for a little bit.

1612
00:43:01,461 --> 00:43:02,450
I felt so sick.

1613
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,600
I was lying on my bed with a friend
of mine and we were just like,

1614
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,290
we had our,

1615
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,880
like we were touching kind of,

1616
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,160
but it would be like if you move,

1617
00:43:10,161 --> 00:43:11,330
I'm gonna throw up and if I move,

1618
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:12,590
you're gonna throw up and you just,

1619
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:13,650
you sit there and you flow.

1620
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:17,240
I remember floating around my apartment
kind of listening to other people's

1621
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:18,170
conversations.

1622
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,670
Did it seem like everything was like slow?

1623
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,640
Like I tried to walk
upstairs and it was like,

1624
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:23,660
and it was,

1625
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,261
it was horrible.

1626
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:25,160
I just remember thinking like,

1627
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:26,240
this is not fun.

1628
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:26,900
Like what?

1629
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,130
But all of my friends who did it,

1630
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:29,150
they used to do it.

1631
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,331
You know?

1632
00:43:29,331 --> 00:43:32,630
I only tried it the one time and they
did just as much as I did and they were

1633
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:33,620
just totally normal.

1634
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:34,091
I mean that,

1635
00:43:34,091 --> 00:43:34,311
you know,

1636
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,380
you build up a tolerance,

1637
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,770
they're just walking around like,

1638
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,251
man,

1639
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:38,520
it's fun to be on Ketamine.

1640
00:43:38,521 --> 00:43:38,830
Yeah.

1641
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,290
Uh,

1642
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,610
it becomes addictive.

1643
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,150
Yeah.

1644
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,580
And I'm glad that I hated it then.

1645
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:43,890
Yeah.

1646
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:47,690
I knew one guy who lost his life to
it and it was going up was an MMA guy.

1647
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:48,710
Um,

1648
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,100
he is somehow or another got addicted
to it when I can see that too because it

1649
00:43:52,101 --> 00:43:53,000
really numbs the pain.

1650
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,850
Like I think that's why people like you
don't feel anything when you're on it.

1651
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,240
But there's the issue though
for me was that I'd like,

1652
00:43:59,241 --> 00:44:02,480
there's other guys that have taken
it recreationally and had these crazy

1653
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:03,500
experiences on it,

1654
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:07,730
but I think they do it intramuscularly
so they can do like a much lower dose

1655
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:08,121
probably.

1656
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:08,920
I don't know.

1657
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,753
It's a lower

1658
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,420
because if you take too much ketamine,

1659
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:12,320
you can't move.

1660
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,960
It paralyzes.

1661
00:44:13,961 --> 00:44:14,070
Yeah.

1662
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:14,330
Yeah.

1663
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,310
Lily used to take judge John Lilly,

1664
00:44:16,311 --> 00:44:17,144
the um,

1665
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:17,551
the,

1666
00:44:17,551 --> 00:44:19,160
the guy who invented the isolation tank,

1667
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,380
he used to take it and go into the tank.

1668
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:24,080
I could see that because then you
wouldn't be able to feel anything,

1669
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:24,420
right?

1670
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:24,830
Yeah.

1671
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:25,341
Oh God,

1672
00:44:25,341 --> 00:44:27,780
that sounds Todd warming.

1673
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,940
Tom McCormick mix.

1674
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,300
First

1675
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,200
trip in the tank.

1676
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:30,741
He,

1677
00:44:30,741 --> 00:44:31,140
he,

1678
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,040
he took a trip

1679
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,030
and Lily's tank,

1680
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,230
lily put them in the
tank and then Lily said,

1681
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,600
you do you want ketamine with this?

1682
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,561
And it was like,

1683
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:37,831
well,

1684
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:38,191
fuck it.

1685
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:39,090
I gotta say yes.

1686
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,220
John Lilly asked me if
I want to do ketamine.

1687
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:41,431
He goes,

1688
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:41,791
all right,

1689
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:42,480
here you go.

1690
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,110
Boom.

1691
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,970
He stabs him in the leg with it,

1692
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:49,710
hits the plunger and sends him to
the fucking darkest of the universe,

1693
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:54,450
will only get an isolation tank
the first time ever doing ketamine.

1694
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:54,700
Okay.

1695
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:55,000
Jimmy,

1696
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,330
if he also have a
dolphin fucking tank too,

1697
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:58,071
that you fucked off,

1698
00:44:58,071 --> 00:44:58,470
isn't it?

1699
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:58,770
No,

1700
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,050
no,

1701
00:44:59,050 --> 00:44:59,201
no,

1702
00:44:59,201 --> 00:44:59,440
no,

1703
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,631
no,

1704
00:44:59,631 --> 00:44:59,741
no,

1705
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:00,231
no.

1706
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:01,040
Lily did not

1707
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:01,750
fucked off.

1708
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,800
But what he did do that was,

1709
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:03,231
that's what it is.

1710
00:45:03,231 --> 00:45:04,520
Private diary said no,

1711
00:45:04,521 --> 00:45:04,701
no,

1712
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:04,911
no,

1713
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:05,121
no,

1714
00:45:05,121 --> 00:45:05,361
no.

1715
00:45:05,361 --> 00:45:05,990
Brian,

1716
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,160
you're so confused.

1717
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:08,270
You don't know the real history.

1718
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,000
What is happening right now?

1719
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,020
Info wars.com ladies and gentlemen,

1720
00:45:12,021 --> 00:45:12,854
that's what's happening.

1721
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:14,631
No,

1722
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:15,290
but what he,

1723
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:16,041
he was,

1724
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:16,220
uh,

1725
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:19,460
the reason why Brian saying that he did
do a lot of experience with dolphins.

1726
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:23,630
He actually was a pioneer maybe
with tree species communication.

1727
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,440
He was like trying to figure out dolphin
languages and stuff and the way he was

1728
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:29,900
doing it was on acid for real.

1729
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:30,620
Okay.

1730
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:34,580
And with isolation tanks and at one point
like you put an isolation tank right

1731
00:45:34,581 --> 00:45:36,950
next to a dolphin tank was
trying to communicate with them.

1732
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:37,561
Yeah.

1733
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:37,760
It's,

1734
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,990
it's pretty funny how like this,

1735
00:45:38,991 --> 00:45:43,190
this is the definition of bad science
right here is like all of these

1736
00:45:43,191 --> 00:45:44,600
experiments on acid,

1737
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:45,730
every card,

1738
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:48,030
my findings and tell people I talked to

1739
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,633
that,

1740
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,880
it's like we'd have,

1741
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:52,420
Nah,

1742
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:52,931
we can't,

1743
00:45:52,931 --> 00:45:53,440
like we,

1744
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,130
there's not an app where you can go
to the zoo and talk to the doctor.

1745
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:56,601
No,

1746
00:45:56,601 --> 00:45:57,321
exactly.

1747
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:57,591
Yeah.

1748
00:45:57,591 --> 00:45:58,610
We don't really know what the fuck,

1749
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,910
how do we know his research is valid?

1750
00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:02,361
And he's like,

1751
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:02,661
well,

1752
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:02,931
you know,

1753
00:46:02,931 --> 00:46:04,370
three chirps means he's happy.

1754
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:05,361
Exactly.

1755
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:05,481
And,

1756
00:46:05,481 --> 00:46:08,420
and definitely not reliable because I'm
sure nobody else has been able to repeat

1757
00:46:08,421 --> 00:46:09,254
those studies.

1758
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:09,540
Well,

1759
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,750
Dolphin noises are real weird one for us.

1760
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,400
There's so alien,

1761
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,520
like the sound is so alien and bizarre
and for us to even wrap our head around

1762
00:46:19,101 --> 00:46:20,660
the fact that that it's a language,

1763
00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:22,250
like it's not a language.

1764
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:23,560
Yeah.

1765
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,500
Rest of way,

1766
00:46:24,501 --> 00:46:24,831
the way,

1767
00:46:24,831 --> 00:46:25,041
you know,

1768
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:25,201
the,

1769
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:25,381
the,

1770
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:25,641
the,

1771
00:46:25,641 --> 00:46:27,290
the English language is structured or,

1772
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,730
or the sounds that we,

1773
00:46:28,731 --> 00:46:30,110
we make with our NOI,

1774
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,000
with our mouths.

1775
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,170
Yep.

1776
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:33,900
But they're communicating and
they're also doing echo location,

1777
00:46:33,901 --> 00:46:34,141
you know,

1778
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:34,831
which is really cool.

1779
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:35,310
And it's,

1780
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:39,420
I think it's so cool when
you see a dolphin or a bat
doing echolocation so that

1781
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,470
they can get around.

1782
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,880
It's really interesting to think about
the fact that some humans who are,

1783
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,751
who have been blind,

1784
00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:46,500
it typically congenitally blind.

1785
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:47,850
I'm blind from birth,

1786
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,260
can actually do that.

1787
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:54,150
Echolocation there's some great youtube
videos of one kid who could skateboard.

1788
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,290
I mean he could do everything.

1789
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,910
He actually since then passed away,

1790
00:46:56,911 --> 00:46:58,050
I think he had a stroke.

1791
00:46:58,051 --> 00:47:02,220
But I mean he was a fascinating person
because he had just such evolved

1792
00:47:02,221 --> 00:47:03,390
echolocation skills.

1793
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:05,220
He would just click and he could hear,

1794
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:06,690
he could just sense them,

1795
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,370
I should say sense not even here.

1796
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:08,590
Yeah.

1797
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:10,800
Cause there's probably so much
more heightened than just hearing.

1798
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,910
Just sense them bouncing back to him
constantly and nowhere he was in space

1799
00:47:14,911 --> 00:47:15,190
from,

1800
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:15,710
it's,

1801
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:16,070
it's,

1802
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:16,500
it's,

1803
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,300
it's so fascinating how there are,

1804
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:19,020
you know,

1805
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:23,250
perceptual things that we
probably completely take
for granted because we have

1806
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:25,170
eyes or because we have ears,

1807
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,190
that organisms that are much kind of
behind us on the evolutionary timescale

1808
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,100
can utilize that are just probably,

1809
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:33,460
you know,

1810
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,080
kind of latent in us.

1811
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:38,080
And if for some reason we
lose some sort of ability,

1812
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,063
we could,

1813
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:39,640
you know,

1814
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,470
develop something like echo location and,

1815
00:47:42,471 --> 00:47:44,020
and use it to our advantage.

1816
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,630
Just most people would never
think to do it because we can see.

1817
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:47,590
So we don't need to.

1818
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,520
And seeing is a much more advanced
way to navigate your surroundings.

1819
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,590
We should tape a bunch of
bats to some dolphins guy.

1820
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:01,760
Fuck the bats first where it had the
basket in this context because they,

1821
00:48:02,951 --> 00:48:03,251
yeah,

1822
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:05,320
they use the echo location.

1823
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:10,350
But I'm speaking of like reluctant often
going back to drugs when you said that

1824
00:48:11,051 --> 00:48:13,060
this guy like ketamine for the first time,

1825
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:13,811
the isolation tank,

1826
00:48:13,811 --> 00:48:14,980
the first time I ever did,

1827
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,830
um,

1828
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,050
GHB.

1829
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,440
Has Anybody here ever done she HV yes.

1830
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,990
The first time I ever did we actually
we were doing lactone like a friend of

1831
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:23,561
ours made it.

1832
00:48:23,561 --> 00:48:24,251
So it was like,

1833
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:25,720
I think the precursor did Ghb,

1834
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:29,710
but the first time I ever
tried it I was also on ecstasy

1835
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:36,010
and I was at my friend's apartment
and a hell of a fucking party.

1836
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:36,520
I do,

1837
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,690
but I really wasn't.

1838
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:40,540
I've just had some crazy
experiences here in California.

1839
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,383
Grew up in Texas.

1840
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:42,760
Yeah.

1841
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,630
What is there to do in tech?

1842
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,210
Like a suburb of Dallas called Plano.

1843
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:54,070
And I remember a friend of my being in
a friend's apartment doing acts and then

1844
00:48:54,071 --> 00:48:56,550
trying GHB and um,

1845
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:57,900
and just sitting there like,

1846
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:58,170
I mean,

1847
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,490
I was trash out of my mind
and we're all sitting there.

1848
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:01,151
It's really quiet.

1849
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:03,190
And then they started playing as the
first time I'd ever heard the band.

1850
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:04,090
Mr Bungle.

1851
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,501
I love,

1852
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:06,334
I love my patents,

1853
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,573
but um,

1854
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,050
but it like,

1855
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,000
it was the weirdest experience of my,

1856
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,720
if you've never listened to Mr Bungle,

1857
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:16,390
like imagine listening to
Mr Bungle on like heavy,

1858
00:49:16,391 --> 00:49:18,850
heavy doses of ecstacy and Ghb.

1859
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,400
Mr Bunk.

1860
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:26,783
Love.

1861
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,533
Mr [inaudible].

1862
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,640
He also did a,

1863
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:55,160
I got a

1864
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,320
tweet yesterday that was
like directed to both of us.

1865
00:50:02,321 --> 00:50:03,154
It was like Joe

1866
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,870
because I was pretty outspoken about

1867
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,413
mixing them up

1868
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,960
a bill that they were trying to pass our
proposition or proposition that they're

1869
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:31,190
trying to pass as the labeling
initiative for Gmos in California.

1870
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:33,980
And I voted against the labeling
initiative and all of my liberal,

1871
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:34,300
cause I'm,

1872
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,720
I'm super liberal.

1873
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:35,990
I'm,

1874
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,321
you know,

1875
00:50:36,321 --> 00:50:37,400
I'm not even a democrat.

1876
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:40,220
I would call myself just
a progressive independent.

1877
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:44,460
And the funny thing is though that I
find like on my column on Huffpost,

1878
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,470
I write about science.

1879
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:46,550
Fundamentally.

1880
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,050
I am pro science.

1881
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:50,540
I'm pro reason I'm anti religion.

1882
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,100
I'm a strong atheist.

1883
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:53,070
It's tied into my,

1884
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:58,100
my views with science and my views
about some of these things like animal

1885
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:01,490
research or like genetically
modified organisms.

1886
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,970
They are informed by my studies
of the scientific literature.

1887
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:08,510
They're not informed by my
party affiliation or you know,

1888
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:09,051
by my,

1889
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:09,360
um,

1890
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,280
my political views.

1891
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:12,110
So that's where sometimes,

1892
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:12,500
you know,

1893
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,360
generally I think scientific thinkers and,

1894
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,760
and left wingers are in the same camps.

1895
00:51:16,761 --> 00:51:18,920
But once in awhile I think
you have these leftwing,

1896
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,700
anti-science views or pseudoscience views
that that come up against each other.

1897
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:23,683
So I'm very,

1898
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,610
and you believe that genetically
modified food is that

1899
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,160
I think that genetically
modified organisms are
extremely important and I think

1900
00:51:30,161 --> 00:51:33,160
that we probably don't realize
how much of them we already eat.

1901
00:51:33,161 --> 00:51:35,890
Like 70% of the food on the shelves
in the grocery store is genetically

1902
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:36,700
modified.

1903
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,920
And I'm not against labeling our food.

1904
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:39,783
Don't get me wrong.

1905
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,800
When I voted against
the labeling initiative,

1906
00:51:41,801 --> 00:51:45,130
I wasn't voting against
putting a label on food.

1907
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:48,280
I was voting against the way that
the voting initiative or the labeling

1908
00:51:48,281 --> 00:51:49,570
initiative was presented.

1909
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,760
I don't think that it should
be a local initiative.

1910
00:51:51,761 --> 00:51:55,360
I think that it should be a federal
initiative and I think that it's arbitrary

1911
00:51:55,361 --> 00:52:00,361
to choose GMO as the thing that we're
gonna all suffer from if we don't label it

1912
00:52:01,211 --> 00:52:02,044
on our food.

1913
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,950
What do you believe is the,

1914
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:08,090
what's most important about
genetically modifying foods?

1915
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:09,390
Why is it so important?

1916
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:09,771
Why?

1917
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:10,850
What is the misconception?

1918
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:11,450
Cause my,

1919
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:14,750
my conception of it has always
been my perception of it.

1920
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:19,120
Rather reading articles that a lot of
people are concerned with the longterm

1921
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:23,930
consequences of eating certain foods that
have been significantly changed to the

1922
00:52:23,931 --> 00:52:26,450
point where they can resist pesticides.

1923
00:52:26,451 --> 00:52:31,451
They have all these strange a antibiotic
properties and they worry about the

1924
00:52:31,911 --> 00:52:35,780
long term consequences of
consuming these unnatural foods.

1925
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:36,741
Okay.

1926
00:52:36,741 --> 00:52:37,011
So,

1927
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:40,190
so I think two points that I can
make it in direct response to that.

1928
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:43,520
I think it's fair to say that they're
worried about long term consequences

1929
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,570
because they haven't been around long
enough to see those consequences.

1930
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,490
But so far every legitimate lab
experiment that has been done has shown no

1931
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:53,630
deleterious effects.

1932
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,240
The big rat study with
the tumors has been,

1933
00:52:56,241 --> 00:52:57,074
you know,

1934
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:57,810
completely debunked.

1935
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:58,643
Like there's just,

1936
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:00,510
it's just bad science.

1937
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:00,711
Well,

1938
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:00,951
no,

1939
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:01,220
it's,

1940
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:05,030
it was bad science because the truth is
the types of rats that they were doing

1941
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:07,280
the study on 10 bitch ass routes,

1942
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:08,780
they tend to get tumors anyway.

1943
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:12,680
And so they weren't really doing a good
job of comparing the controls to the

1944
00:53:12,681 --> 00:53:15,110
experimental model there.

1945
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:15,830
But so,

1946
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,870
so his lab animals,

1947
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:18,801
no,

1948
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:19,071
no,

1949
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:20,300
there's no evidence.

1950
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:20,631
I mean,

1951
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:22,420
just good evidence.

1952
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,350
Everybody's freaking out
because they're going well,

1953
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,070
it dangerous,

1954
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:27,120
so it could be dangerous.

1955
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,580
And so that that first
of all makes me worried.

1956
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,414
And then also I think,

1957
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,161
I think it's the,

1958
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:32,970
the lexicon that we use,

1959
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,820
it's this natural versus unnatural.

1960
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:40,530
There's kind of like whole foods is better
because it's all natural and just the

1961
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:43,440
word natural is like
hilarious to me because

1962
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,721
organisms,

1963
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:46,501
especially plants,

1964
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:48,990
mostly what we're talking about here
at plants like fruits and vegetables,

1965
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:53,760
they have been genetically modifying
them selves for hundreds of thousands of

1966
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:54,594
years.

1967
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:58,020
They swap jeans all the time.

1968
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:00,420
And then once agriculture began,

1969
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:04,890
we started genetically modifying all of
these organisms by doing crossbreeding.

1970
00:54:04,891 --> 00:54:05,600
We would take,

1971
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,120
you know,

1972
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,090
the healthiest looking tomatoes and read
it only with the other really healthy

1973
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:09,721
looking tomatoes.

1974
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:13,110
And what we were really
doing is solidifying that
certain genes we're going to

1975
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:15,570
be passed down and other genes
we're going to be weeded out.

1976
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,400
Now what we do is we,

1977
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,920
we put individual genes into the plant.

1978
00:54:19,921 --> 00:54:24,210
So whereas we used to swap something like
50,000 genes without even knowing the

1979
00:54:24,211 --> 00:54:26,040
specifics of what we were changing.

1980
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:28,320
Now that we can do it with
biotechnology in the lab,

1981
00:54:28,321 --> 00:54:32,430
we can swap out one or two genes and
somehow that's more frightening to the

1982
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:33,360
general public.

1983
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:38,070
Then 50,000 genes being swapped and
so that's the part that I don't really

1984
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:39,300
understand people's arguing.

1985
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:40,540
So when you're coming at it,

1986
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:41,171
you're coming at it,

1987
00:54:41,171 --> 00:54:45,340
you think from a position of science
where you say the evidence against it is

1988
00:54:45,341 --> 00:54:45,851
really,

1989
00:54:45,851 --> 00:54:47,680
most of it's just confused.

1990
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,053
I think that it's a lot.

1991
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,040
There's a lot of
fearmongering first of all,

1992
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:54,100
and the truth is if you don't want
to eat GMOs because you're not sure,

1993
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,260
you don't have to trust me.

1994
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:59,830
The companies that don't use genetically
modified organisms and their food

1995
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,780
already labeled their packages as such
because they use it as a marketing ploy,

1996
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:03,840
right?

1997
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,380
They're not going to
miss out on that chance.

1998
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:10,270
So for us to have to mandate a label that
says this is genetically modified food

1999
00:55:10,271 --> 00:55:13,660
is really going to come across to
the regular consumer as warning.

2000
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,370
This is genetically modified food.

2001
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,050
When there's no reason to warn people.

2002
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:20,350
The FDA's job is to warn people
if there's a potential risk,

2003
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,510
there's no risk of eating GMOs.

2004
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:25,180
And all the evidence so far says
that they're perfectly healthy.

2005
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,310
What about the,

2006
00:55:26,311 --> 00:55:28,520
the Chinese studies that show that a,

2007
00:55:28,521 --> 00:55:30,980
it's not just vitamins
and protein that some,

2008
00:55:30,981 --> 00:55:31,340
uh,

2009
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:36,340
Gmos are providing to the body but
your body is absorbing micro RNA.

2010
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:37,680
I Dunno,

2011
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,161
I'd be interested.

2012
00:55:38,161 --> 00:55:39,060
I haven't read those studies.

2013
00:55:39,061 --> 00:55:39,990
I'd be interested to see it,

2014
00:55:39,991 --> 00:55:43,830
but I would also be interested to
see if non GMOs are also doing that.

2015
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:44,451
Yeah,

2016
00:55:44,451 --> 00:55:45,081
that's a good point.

2017
00:55:45,081 --> 00:55:45,890
Yeah,

2018
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:46,723
that's a good point.

2019
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:47,440
Yeah.

2020
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:47,861
I mean it's,

2021
00:55:47,861 --> 00:55:48,161
you know,

2022
00:55:48,161 --> 00:55:48,370
it's,

2023
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,580
it's a tough situation
and the truth is that um,

2024
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:52,540
scientists aren't monolithic on this.

2025
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:53,800
Not all scientists agree.

2026
00:55:53,801 --> 00:55:55,390
Many scientists voted to label,

2027
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,290
but isn't the real issue that if there
is something wrong and especially in the

2028
00:55:59,291 --> 00:55:59,771
future,

2029
00:55:59,771 --> 00:56:00,370
if it's well,

2030
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:01,203
you know,

2031
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:05,230
shortens people's lifespans
some ways causes some problem,

2032
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,980
it's going to be really hard to
stop once it's already in place

2033
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:09,220
it,

2034
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,510
but it already is in place.

2035
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,260
That's the thing.

2036
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:11,501
I mean,

2037
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,480
it's not like not labeling it now,

2038
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:14,830
it's going to make it be more in place.

2039
00:56:14,831 --> 00:56:17,590
We're already eating 70% of our food
is already genetically modified.

2040
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:19,940
And you don't think there's any danger?

2041
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,550
I'm not concerned about it.

2042
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:22,443
I'm really not.

2043
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:24,820
And you what the truth is in essence,

2044
00:56:24,821 --> 00:56:25,511
it helps people in.

2045
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:29,230
Sometimes I worry if these kinds of
conversations that I would be having,

2046
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:30,070
like when I would do,

2047
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:30,520
um,

2048
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,350
appearances on the
young Turks for example,

2049
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:33,790
which I think is a really
great network and I,

2050
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:34,201
I'll,

2051
00:56:34,201 --> 00:56:36,760
I'll sit on with them a lot just
to kind of talk science with them.

2052
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,260
But there's a very strong liberal view
on the shows and so a lot of the people

2053
00:56:41,261 --> 00:56:43,210
will write in and they'll
ask about these things.

2054
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:44,800
And I think that sometimes,

2055
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,480
I know it might sound
a little bit offensive,

2056
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:48,460
but it's kind of like
a first world problem.

2057
00:56:48,461 --> 00:56:52,450
Like it's kind of like a 1% or problem
to be worrying about eating these

2058
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,830
genetically modified organisms.

2059
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,180
The reason that,

2060
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,043
um,

2061
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:57,370
farmers,

2062
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:59,140
the reason that biotechnologists in,

2063
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:03,730
in these university laboratories are
doing genetic modification is so that we

2064
00:57:03,731 --> 00:57:08,710
could feed more people
safely and healthily so that
people who don't have access

2065
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,020
to a lot of nutritious food can eat,

2066
00:57:11,021 --> 00:57:11,621
for example,

2067
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:14,440
golden rice that gives them certain
vitamins that they wouldn't have been able

2068
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:16,060
to get if they were
just eating white rice.

2069
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,600
It's so that these foods can have a
longer shelf life so that they last longer

2070
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:21,250
so that more people can consume them.

2071
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:24,640
But we're looking at it through American
eyes from an American perspective where

2072
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,200
we constantly waste food,

2073
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,600
where we have so much
money that we can eat.

2074
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,340
You know,

2075
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:29,570
we,

2076
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:33,070
we try to make our food as
clean as possible and I mean,

2077
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,150
that's fair.

2078
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:38,140
And I'm not shitting on people
who want to eat pure organic food,

2079
00:57:38,141 --> 00:57:41,290
but I don't like the holier than thou
attitude that somehow they're healthier

2080
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,140
because they do it because there's
no evidence to support that.

2081
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:45,730
That's my stance.

2082
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,340
Well,

2083
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:46,760
you know,

2084
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,160
it seems like you've thought this
through a lot more than I have.

2085
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:50,930
Um,

2086
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:51,371
my,

2087
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:51,770
uh,

2088
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:52,640
my views on it,

2089
00:57:52,641 --> 00:57:53,510
I've always been,

2090
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:54,470
uh,

2091
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:57,320
that if you look under
genetically modified foods,

2092
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:58,170
uh,

2093
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:58,970
look online,

2094
00:57:58,970 --> 00:57:59,691
the majority,

2095
00:57:59,691 --> 00:58:03,020
the vast majority of
the articles about it,

2096
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:04,220
our danger articles.

2097
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:07,940
So you feel like that's all just
scare mongering and just trying to,

2098
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,100
I think a lot of it is,

2099
00:58:09,101 --> 00:58:09,551
and you know,

2100
00:58:09,551 --> 00:58:10,810
I think that also there's this,

2101
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:12,280
this idea that well,

2102
00:58:12,281 --> 00:58:13,690
if Monsanto is in on it,

2103
00:58:13,691 --> 00:58:14,441
it must be evil.

2104
00:58:14,441 --> 00:58:16,480
And I get that because
Monsanto is an evil,

2105
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:17,291
evil company.

2106
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:21,460
But I also think that we need to separate
in our minds the difference between

2107
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:26,470
bad business practices and
greedy capitalistic practices
and the basic science

2108
00:58:26,471 --> 00:58:27,281
that goes into it.

2109
00:58:27,281 --> 00:58:27,760
And it's,

2110
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,930
I know it's hard to do,

2111
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:30,340
it's hard to separate those things,

2112
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,390
but just because I voted no and,

2113
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:34,870
and Monsanto voted no,

2114
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,540
doesn't mean that I'm in bed
with Monsanto for example.

2115
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,840
But I do see it seems like
an easy thing to do to go,

2116
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:41,231
oh,

2117
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:42,160
Monsanto's for this.

2118
00:58:42,161 --> 00:58:43,690
Well then I'm automatically against it,

2119
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,321
you know?

2120
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:44,681
I mean,

2121
00:58:44,681 --> 00:58:45,820
it makes sense to me,

2122
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:46,683
honestly,

2123
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:48,310
of all the other arguments.

2124
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,230
That's the argument that
I appreciate the most.

2125
00:58:50,231 --> 00:58:50,771
Like when people go,

2126
00:58:50,771 --> 00:58:52,870
I voted for it because Fuck Monsanto.

2127
00:58:52,871 --> 00:58:53,110
I'm like,

2128
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:53,260
man,

2129
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:53,471
okay,

2130
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:54,304
I'll give you that.

2131
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:57,650
If anybody needs to do
mushrooms and look at the life,

2132
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,090
it's the people that run Monsanto.

2133
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,473
I agree.

2134
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,360
The suicides that are connected
to them just in India alone.

2135
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,493
It's terrifying.

2136
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,330
It's that hundreds of thousands
of people who couldn't pay off.

2137
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:11,420
There's their seeds.

2138
00:59:11,421 --> 00:59:13,070
Couldn't afford to run their farm.

2139
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:13,301
Yeah,

2140
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:13,901
it's disgusting.

2141
00:59:13,901 --> 00:59:14,111
I mean,

2142
00:59:14,111 --> 00:59:15,610
and talk about like a civil liberties,

2143
00:59:15,611 --> 00:59:16,990
a human rights issue right there.

2144
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:17,853
Yeah.

2145
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,313
It is crazy

2146
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:20,973
number like the,

2147
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,040
I'll just pull

2148
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,470
it up right now and be in suicides
due to Monsanto cause it's true.

2149
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:24,951
It's fucking,

2150
00:59:24,951 --> 00:59:25,280
yeah.

2151
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,490
And it's so sad because I
feel like so many hardworking,

2152
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:28,851
you know,

2153
00:59:28,851 --> 00:59:32,150
university scientists who don't get a
dime from companies like Monsanto are

2154
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:37,151
working really hard to manipulate these
organisms for the reason of helping

2155
00:59:37,551 --> 00:59:38,001
people,

2156
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:38,241
you know,

2157
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,390
in order to feed more people
that are going hungry and for,

2158
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,990
for some of that research
to become bastardized.

2159
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:44,420
Um,

2160
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:48,230
once this huge company can kind of put
restrictions on people's ability to get

2161
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:50,720
food or grow food and
their own indigenous,

2162
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:51,171
you know,

2163
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,880
in their end the farms in their backyards,

2164
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:53,320
it's just,

2165
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,050
that's so sick and you know what,

2166
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,240
instead of doing this,

2167
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:00,800
if they just provided them a bit,

2168
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:03,360
a more reasonable rate,

2169
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:03,770
uh,

2170
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:06,810
in a more reasonable way and
worked with these farmers,

2171
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:10,620
they would continue to get
a certain amount of money
from them instead of raping

2172
01:00:10,621 --> 01:00:10,940
this,

2173
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:11,940
like taking it off.

2174
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:13,200
They could have a,

2175
01:00:13,201 --> 01:00:17,520
a nice business with these people and
continue to profit and everybody do well,

2176
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:22,670
but they have connected 200,000 suicides
in India throughout the past decade to

2177
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,633
Monsanto.

2178
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:25,783
That's so,

2179
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,800
that's so fucked up.

2180
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,080
Crazy so far.

2181
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,810
I mean it's also 200,000
people if you think about it,

2182
01:00:30,811 --> 01:00:32,880
who are no longer working and making money

2183
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:36,460
and these are 200,000 people
who are probably very poor
and probably could never

2184
01:00:36,461 --> 01:00:39,520
raise enough money to live you a
legitimate lawsuit against this company.

2185
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:40,661
And I mean it's,

2186
01:00:40,661 --> 01:00:41,201
it's just,

2187
01:00:41,201 --> 01:00:43,240
it's mortifying and it's
the same thing that we see,

2188
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:45,100
I feel like with big Pharma,

2189
01:00:45,101 --> 01:00:47,350
and this is another big problem where,

2190
01:00:47,351 --> 01:00:47,980
um,

2191
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:51,400
people will lump in biomedical research,

2192
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:55,990
the lump in research on drug
efficacy with big Pharma.

2193
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:56,681
And there are,

2194
01:00:56,681 --> 01:00:57,341
don't get me wrong,

2195
01:00:57,341 --> 01:00:58,810
there are a lot of connections there.

2196
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,230
And,

2197
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:00,220
but what's wrong,

2198
01:01:00,221 --> 01:01:03,130
I think with the way that drugs
are prescribed in this country,

2199
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:07,060
what's wrong with the amount of kind of
danger linked to drugs in this country

2200
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,630
has little to do with the fact that
drugs are being developed that can help

2201
01:01:10,631 --> 01:01:10,931
people.

2202
01:01:10,931 --> 01:01:13,510
And it has everything to do with
how these drugs are being marketed.

2203
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,440
We're the only developed country in the
world where we can have commercials for

2204
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:22,300
pharmaceuticals on television because
we shouldn't be asking our doctor,

2205
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:23,710
if so and so is right for us.

2206
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:26,530
Our doctors should be telling
us what we should be taking.

2207
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:26,860
Right.

2208
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:27,190
You know,

2209
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:30,820
we should and we should have the ability
to take generics of things if we want

2210
01:01:30,821 --> 01:01:31,420
to.

2211
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:31,631
We,

2212
01:01:31,631 --> 01:01:32,110
you know,

2213
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:33,940
drug should be affordable for people.

2214
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:34,511
I mean I'm,

2215
01:01:34,511 --> 01:01:36,130
I'm for universal health care.

2216
01:01:36,131 --> 01:01:38,170
I definitely think that that would
change a lot of these problems.

2217
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:39,161
But again,

2218
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:41,560
I think that a lot of
liberal thinkers who,

2219
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:41,890
they,

2220
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:44,770
they end up throwing the baby out with
the bath water and they throw the science

2221
01:01:44,771 --> 01:01:45,460
out with the,

2222
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,380
with the terrible company practices.

2223
01:01:47,381 --> 01:01:47,651
And,

2224
01:01:47,651 --> 01:01:51,460
and that is kind of sad to me because I
think the fundamental science is being

2225
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:55,180
done to develop drugs that
actually help people is amazing.

2226
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:59,570
It's crazy that they tell you what
would be wrong with you if you need the

2227
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:00,070
stuff.

2228
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:00,310
Yeah.

2229
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:00,990
And then you go to,

2230
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:01,581
you talked to like,

2231
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:01,911
dude,

2232
01:02:01,911 --> 01:02:03,650
I got that same problem.

2233
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:03,870
Yeah.

2234
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:05,630
I'm thinking I need this stuff.

2235
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:06,590
Like they,

2236
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:10,820
it's so unfair because all those people
in those commercials have got their shit

2237
01:02:10,821 --> 01:02:11,091
together.

2238
01:02:11,091 --> 01:02:12,080
They're holding hands,

2239
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:16,070
they're walking together on the
beach and everybody's smiling.

2240
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:16,340
I mean,

2241
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,820
I saw a commercial the other day for it,

2242
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:18,200
for a drug

2243
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,630
for CLPD medicine.

2244
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,630
Copt is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.

2245
01:02:22,631 --> 01:02:25,120
That's bronchitis and emphysema combined.

2246
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:26,163
And the woman's like,

2247
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:28,240
now that I take my medicine,

2248
01:02:28,241 --> 01:02:29,021
I can do every,

2249
01:02:29,021 --> 01:02:29,351
and I'm like,

2250
01:02:29,351 --> 01:02:29,710
no,

2251
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:32,200
that woman would hardly be
able to get off the couch.

2252
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:34,450
Even if you're medicated for CLPD,

2253
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:35,980
your life is really tough.

2254
01:02:35,981 --> 01:02:37,090
You can't breathe,

2255
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,890
you cannot breathe.

2256
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,440
And this chick was just running around.

2257
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:41,021
She's just like,

2258
01:02:41,021 --> 01:02:43,630
I'm fine now that I take
my inhaler or whatever.

2259
01:02:43,631 --> 01:02:44,464
And it's like,

2260
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,590
people know if you have CLPD,

2261
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,160
you know what your options are,

2262
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:51,400
you're suffering and you've talked
to your doctor about how to fix this,

2263
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:51,701
you know.

2264
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:55,570
And so to have all of that information
readily available by your physician,

2265
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:56,560
I think is important.

2266
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,450
But to advertise it on television,

2267
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,070
how did they make them through?

2268
01:03:00,071 --> 01:03:02,680
How did that become a
reality in modern America?

2269
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:05,620
Lobbies in Congress.

2270
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:06,760
Yeah.

2271
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:07,840
It's really incredible.

2272
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,280
Some of the shit that's legal.

2273
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:10,000
I know.

2274
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,110
It's really strange.

2275
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:11,350
It's,

2276
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,130
it's,

2277
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:13,000
it's like depressing.

2278
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:14,230
It's really depressing.

2279
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:15,183
It just,

2280
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:20,720
in this day and age we have the w with
the access to information that we have.

2281
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:21,571
The,

2282
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:25,360
the culture hasn't really caught
up to what everyone knows.

2283
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:25,690
Yeah.

2284
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:27,970
So the reality of what
everyone knows about,

2285
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:28,450
you know,

2286
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:29,920
the insanity of the,

2287
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:32,050
the economy and how it's all structured.

2288
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,630
The reality of drug laws,

2289
01:03:34,631 --> 01:03:39,280
the reality of law enforcement and the
reality of like ever increasing civil

2290
01:03:39,281 --> 01:03:42,640
liberties violations where
people have to fight for what,

2291
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:43,121
you know,

2292
01:03:43,121 --> 01:03:46,510
used to be what we consider it
a part of being an American.

2293
01:03:46,511 --> 01:03:46,880
Yeah.

2294
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:47,380
Uh,

2295
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:49,600
proud to be an American because
at least I know I'm free.

2296
01:03:49,601 --> 01:03:50,470
You're supposed to be free.

2297
01:03:50,471 --> 01:03:53,500
This is not supposed to be a place
where someone's looking at every fucking

2298
01:03:53,501 --> 01:03:56,820
email you send and listening to
every phone call you make this,

2299
01:03:56,821 --> 01:03:58,150
it's not supposed to be that.

2300
01:03:58,190 --> 01:03:59,480
And even outside of America.

2301
01:03:59,481 --> 01:03:59,661
I mean,

2302
01:03:59,661 --> 01:03:59,871
that's,

2303
01:03:59,871 --> 01:04:03,410
I think a really sad part of the civil
liberties violations is like looking at

2304
01:04:03,411 --> 01:04:07,400
just the sheer amount of like bombings
and drone strikes we'll replace with

2305
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:09,680
innocent deaths just across the board.

2306
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:10,390
Um,

2307
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:13,360
and to see us do the same type of tactics,

2308
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,980
even in a lesser form.

2309
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:18,400
Then we're seeing that we're seeing
dictators doing other countries like Egypt

2310
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:21,670
where the people are riding in the streets
because this guy has turned himself

2311
01:04:21,671 --> 01:04:22,504
into a dictator.

2312
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:22,870
Yup.

2313
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:23,141
We're,

2314
01:04:23,141 --> 01:04:27,820
we're seeing those incremental steps
right behind the cover of darkness.

2315
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:32,650
You feel do certain bills over
at least so on New Year's Eve.

2316
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:33,860
So everybody has to go back

2317
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:34,760
and it's our guy.

2318
01:04:34,761 --> 01:04:35,870
It's not Dick Cheney.

2319
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:36,351
You know what I mean?

2320
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,011
That's our guy.

2321
01:04:37,011 --> 01:04:38,180
He couldn't be doing that.

2322
01:04:38,181 --> 01:04:38,361
Well,

2323
01:04:38,361 --> 01:04:39,920
they're not publicizing
that he's doing that,

2324
01:04:39,921 --> 01:04:40,754
but they are.

2325
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:41,571
I mean,

2326
01:04:41,571 --> 01:04:41,751
it's,

2327
01:04:41,751 --> 01:04:42,081
it's,

2328
01:04:42,081 --> 01:04:42,381
it's,

2329
01:04:42,381 --> 01:04:42,921
it's rough.

2330
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:43,251
But I,

2331
01:04:43,251 --> 01:04:43,700
you know,

2332
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,830
restraint Obama has taken,

2333
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:46,340
uh,

2334
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,910
taken a lot of this Patriot Act shit
that Bush put into play and just amped it

2335
01:04:49,911 --> 01:04:50,130
up.

2336
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:52,890
So the drownings amped up the dronies,

2337
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,270
the warrantless wiretapping and you know,

2338
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:00,480
the idea that they could detain
American civilians with no recourse.

2339
01:05:00,721 --> 01:05:02,070
You can't get a lawyer.

2340
01:05:02,071 --> 01:05:03,900
You can't talk to anybody about it.

2341
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,640
They don't have to let
anybody know where you are.

2342
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:08,070
They don't have to inform your
family that they can just take you.

2343
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:09,783
That's insane.

2344
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:10,290
You know,

2345
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:11,850
we do have the internet at our fingertips.

2346
01:05:11,851 --> 01:05:15,060
I have my iPad right here and I've got
my iPhone and I'm looking at Twitter and

2347
01:05:15,061 --> 01:05:16,680
I can constantly access anything I want,

2348
01:05:16,681 --> 01:05:21,681
but it's as easy to read an article on
politico as it is to go to like lol cats.

2349
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:22,870
You know what I mean?

2350
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:24,880
And exactly.

2351
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,950
And so I think that,

2352
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:27,311
yeah.

2353
01:05:27,311 --> 01:05:29,190
Was that like a lame
out of date reference?

2354
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:34,191
Do people still go to like [inaudible]
this shit at one point in time,

2355
01:05:37,471 --> 01:05:38,920
remember everybody was like,

2356
01:05:38,921 --> 01:05:39,341
Oh my God,

2357
01:05:39,341 --> 01:05:40,180
this is so cute.

2358
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:41,050
This is so cute.

2359
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,610
But terrible resolution.

2360
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:43,903
I'd rather,

2361
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:47,440
I mean sometimes I would rather watch
a bad lip reading than an actual,

2362
01:05:47,441 --> 01:05:47,681
you know,

2363
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:49,960
presidential debate or
something on Youtube.

2364
01:05:49,961 --> 01:05:50,570
So

2365
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:54,710
get offended as an intelligent person
when you hear politicians talk in that

2366
01:05:54,711 --> 01:05:56,210
political bullshit way.

2367
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:56,731
Oh hell yeah.

2368
01:05:56,731 --> 01:05:57,900
You should wait until,

2369
01:05:57,901 --> 01:05:59,140
I just want to tell everybody at,

2370
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:03,450
please log on on Monday to huff post
science because I'm releasing a new video

2371
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:06,630
where I just like rail into Marco Rubio.

2372
01:06:06,631 --> 01:06:11,631
I rail into Marco Rubio is the senator
from Florida who was interviewed by Gq

2373
01:06:13,501 --> 01:06:16,950
recently and just kind of hemmed and
hawed when they asked him how old is the

2374
01:06:16,951 --> 01:06:17,670
earth?

2375
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:20,040
And instead of saying up
front 4.5 billion years,

2376
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:20,521
he said,

2377
01:06:20,521 --> 01:06:21,354
Whoa,

2378
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,250
I'm not a scientist.

2379
01:06:23,251 --> 01:06:25,140
And I can't really say,

2380
01:06:25,141 --> 01:06:28,160
and there's a lot of debate
with theologians and stuff.

2381
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:31,240
Well there is a lot of debate
between theologians and scientists.

2382
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:32,920
Yeah,

2383
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:33,754
that is true.

2384
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:37,790
There's a lot of debate
between why knows and cops

2385
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:40,523
also true

2386
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:43,103
this bridge.

2387
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:46,161
And it's not just that,

2388
01:06:46,161 --> 01:06:46,540
you know,

2389
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:50,300
I ran into some of the guys that
recently got voted out of office.

2390
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,640
I'm like Walsh and Akin,

2391
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:54,530
I talk about super political,

2392
01:06:54,531 --> 01:06:55,011
your phone,

2393
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:55,844
all this nonsense,

2394
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:59,920
especially when when
science comes into this,

2395
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:05,120
this Guy Brown who sits on the fucking
house science committee and he thinks

2396
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:05,680
that,

2397
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,080
um,

2398
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:06,920
evolution,

2399
01:07:06,921 --> 01:07:11,450
embryology and all this nonsense about
the Big Bang theory are lies from the pit

2400
01:07:11,451 --> 01:07:15,830
of hell is what he said publicly
in front of a wall of deer heads,

2401
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:16,664
by the way.

2402
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:17,440
Um,

2403
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,010
I mean it's,

2404
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:19,670
it's mortifying that these people,

2405
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,050
there are so many global warming deniers,

2406
01:07:24,051 --> 01:07:25,910
evolution deniers who were sitting on the,

2407
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:30,080
on the House Committee for Science Space
and technology and these people have

2408
01:07:30,081 --> 01:07:33,170
jurisdiction over the National
Science Foundation over NASA,

2409
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:33,921
over,

2410
01:07:33,921 --> 01:07:34,460
um,

2411
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:35,860
uh,

2412
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,090
the US agricultural service.

2413
01:07:38,091 --> 01:07:38,331
I mean,

2414
01:07:38,331 --> 01:07:43,331
it's so scary and they're all just
fucking Republican Texan oil money,

2415
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:43,910
you know,

2416
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:45,800
lobbies are lining their pockets.

2417
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:47,060
It's so scary.

2418
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,070
Are we going to have this conversation?

2419
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:53,840
I was a little nervous about this
because I saw some tweets coming in.

2420
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:54,801
Well,

2421
01:07:54,801 --> 01:07:55,590
you know,

2422
01:07:55,590 --> 01:08:00,420
it's a fascinating thing because for
whatever reason it's become this sort of

2423
01:08:00,421 --> 01:08:03,310
right wing talking points and it's,

2424
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:06,990
it's like something that people get
like real reactionary with and they get

2425
01:08:06,991 --> 01:08:07,680
real,

2426
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,090
they have like a built in,

2427
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:09,450
uh,

2428
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:10,200
instead of reactionary.

2429
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,870
They have a built built
in answer and you know,

2430
01:08:12,871 --> 01:08:14,760
someone brings up what
about global warming?

2431
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,070
It's a cycle to

2432
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,470
natural cycle happens all the time.

2433
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:21,440
And these guys are called pseudo science,

2434
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:26,650
but it's this weird aggressive like
right when then because it's become so

2435
01:08:27,591 --> 01:08:28,221
politicized.

2436
01:08:28,221 --> 01:08:32,120
So like 99.9% of scientists agree that
the earth is getting warmer and that

2437
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:34,920
human carbon emissions are a highly
contributing to this right now.

2438
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:36,920
How the fuck does that an emotional issue?

2439
01:08:36,921 --> 01:08:37,360
Like what?

2440
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,193
What is,

2441
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,213
what is that?

2442
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:44,720
It's so funny how many of these you
start to see these people flip flopping

2443
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:48,230
lately because they can't hold
on to this kind of archaic,

2444
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,430
you know,

2445
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:52,760
just embed it seeped in
such intense religion.

2446
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:54,290
They can't hold onto these views anymore.

2447
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:58,460
We saw Pat Robertson the other day
on the 700 club like Pat Robertson,

2448
01:08:58,461 --> 01:08:59,330
the televangelist,

2449
01:08:59,331 --> 01:09:02,810
the old guy going on about like
a woman wrote in and she said,

2450
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:06,260
I'm nervous because my kids asked me
about dinosaurs and I don't know how to

2451
01:09:06,261 --> 01:09:08,900
tell them to make it legit with the Bible.

2452
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:11,060
And I really want them to be
with me in the Kingdom of Heaven.

2453
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:15,380
And Pat Robertson's all this business
about the earth being 6,000 years old is

2454
01:09:15,381 --> 01:09:16,520
crazy talk.

2455
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,280
All the science says that it's old.

2456
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:21,020
We know it's 4.5 billion years old.

2457
01:09:21,021 --> 01:09:22,880
We have radio carbon dating man.

2458
01:09:22,881 --> 01:09:24,230
Never lived with dinosaurs.

2459
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:25,890
We have frozen dinosaur.

2460
01:09:25,891 --> 01:09:30,891
He said we have frozen dinosaur carcasses
and the Dakotas and thank God for Pat

2461
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:34,253
Roberts.

2462
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:38,990
I just thank God for path in which I do
not believe for Pat Robertson because

2463
01:09:38,991 --> 01:09:39,171
he's,

2464
01:09:39,171 --> 01:09:42,380
I mean granted he's still a total piece
of work and he said earlier this year

2465
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:46,250
that atheist are trying to steal
Christmas and I'm very concerned,

2466
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:47,721
hey,

2467
01:09:47,721 --> 01:09:49,100
don't take Christmas away from me.

2468
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,810
Christmas was for the Pagans first.

2469
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:51,890
So fuck all y'all

2470
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:59,580
a fire circle.

2471
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:04,400
That sounds like fun.

2472
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:07,283
But

2473
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,640
I will say that I am still happy.

2474
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:13,450
Then Pat Robertson came out

2475
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:20,580
more bizarre than the global warming one.

2476
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:23,800
It's an aggressive one.

2477
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:27,620
Natural Cycle.

2478
01:10:27,621 --> 01:10:29,030
They've got ice core samples.

2479
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,070
It's like that typical,

2480
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,353
typical,

2481
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:36,613
that

2482
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:44,150
weird conservative talk show
radio guy voice solution.

2483
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:54,330
Well we just need to allow kids to
learn all the different options and they

2484
01:10:54,331 --> 01:10:56,040
tried to go about it
kind of in a smarter way

2485
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,120
in this video on Monday.

2486
01:11:00,121 --> 01:11:03,910
And I basically talk about why creationist

2487
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:09,050
and then I take you back all the
way to the beginning of time,

2488
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:12,860
6,000 years ago and
there's like whole fucking

2489
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,400
all over the globe.

2490
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:15,641
You know,

2491
01:11:15,641 --> 01:11:20,110
like humans have been evolving for
hundreds of thousands of years and there's

2492
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:23,290
beautiful pottery and boats and plows.

2493
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:24,160
There's agriculture.

2494
01:11:24,161 --> 01:11:29,161
People are doing math already fishing
that anybody could believe that the earth

2495
01:11:29,831 --> 01:11:31,000
is only 6,000 years old.

2496
01:11:31,001 --> 01:11:32,560
It's just a huge block.

2497
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,161
That's what it is.

2498
01:11:33,161 --> 01:11:34,630
It's like it's cognitive dissonance.

2499
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:39,430
They know it has to be older
because they've been to a
museum and they've read a

2500
01:11:39,431 --> 01:11:40,264
textbook,

2501
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:41,253
but they have to,

2502
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:42,550
they feel guilty.

2503
01:11:42,551 --> 01:11:45,370
There's this guilt that's built
into their faith that says,

2504
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:47,260
I don't know if I don't believe this,

2505
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:49,870
I might not end up in heaven
and God is going to punish me.

2506
01:11:49,871 --> 01:11:50,800
And I know it's difficult,

2507
01:11:50,801 --> 01:11:54,160
but he's just testing my faith and it's
so sad that they're locked into that.

2508
01:11:54,161 --> 01:11:57,340
It's so sad that these religions can't
be more flexible and more progressive.

2509
01:11:57,490 --> 01:12:01,450
I wouldn't be so anti religion if I saw
more progressive religion out there.

2510
01:12:01,451 --> 01:12:02,950
I have friends that are in progressive,

2511
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:03,784
um,

2512
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,160
Christian denominations
and I respect that.

2513
01:12:06,161 --> 01:12:09,220
I mean I think it's bullshit and I can't
believe they believe what they believe,

2514
01:12:09,221 --> 01:12:10,054
but I'm not going to,

2515
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:10,451
you know,

2516
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:11,320
say that they shouldn't.

2517
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:15,850
I think religions are a type of
operating system for a human being.

2518
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:20,940
And I think that a lot of people need
some set of rules and regulations and

2519
01:12:21,191 --> 01:12:23,710
something to look forward to
when it all ends and something,

2520
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:24,281
you know,

2521
01:12:24,281 --> 01:12:25,790
the idea of the,

2522
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:26,450
the,

2523
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:26,720
the,

2524
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:31,720
the vast just expanse of the universe
and the insignificant aspect of your life

2525
01:12:32,951 --> 01:12:35,980
in relationship to everything you see
in relation to everything you see in the

2526
01:12:35,981 --> 01:12:36,814
cosmos.

2527
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,430
I think that fucks with people's doors.

2528
01:12:39,431 --> 01:12:40,510
Of course it does.

2529
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,430
And I think that the real problem with,

2530
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:43,870
with religions,

2531
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:47,760
especially like real fundamentalist
religions that are like really strict and

2532
01:12:47,761 --> 01:12:48,590
said they,

2533
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:49,300
they,

2534
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:53,920
they stop your thinking and
cornered in this trap and you,

2535
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:54,341
you,

2536
01:12:54,341 --> 01:12:58,360
this operating system that
you're operating under has
this very limited range.

2537
01:12:58,361 --> 01:13:02,320
And if it doesn't fall in
this very limited range,

2538
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:03,910
you really can't,

2539
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:04,780
rationally,

2540
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:05,613
you can't accept it.

2541
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,760
Those boundaries at all.

2542
01:13:07,761 --> 01:13:09,380
And everybody else's outside looking in,

2543
01:13:09,381 --> 01:13:09,801
going like,

2544
01:13:09,801 --> 01:13:10,880
come out here with us.

2545
01:13:10,881 --> 01:13:11,040
Like,

2546
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,850
so you don't grow air is a
little cleaner and it is.

2547
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:14,370
Yeah,

2548
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:18,150
but there's aspects of religion
and there's aspects of worship.

2549
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:22,860
Even there's aspects of just worshiping
the and having an appreciation for life

2550
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:23,870
itself and then the,

2551
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:26,900
the incredible wonder of,

2552
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:30,750
of this existence and that
alone should be worshiped.

2553
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,190
Even if you call it,

2554
01:13:32,191 --> 01:13:33,270
you want to call it God,

2555
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,380
you want to call love,

2556
01:13:34,381 --> 01:13:35,490
you want to call it appreciation,

2557
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:36,450
call it something.

2558
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,401
But the,

2559
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:37,830
the,

2560
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,320
the wrong aspects of it,

2561
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:46,160
they're almost like they're something
that inhibits you from getting the best

2562
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:49,224
out of life.

2563
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,300
The wrong aspects keep,

2564
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:54,270
it's almost like it has
all this love to it.

2565
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:58,950
Treat your brother as if it's you and
live your life and harmony and do good and

2566
01:13:58,951 --> 01:13:59,611
to others.

2567
01:13:59,611 --> 01:14:00,500
And you know,

2568
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:05,190
use these laws because they're
designed to make harmony amongst men.

2569
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:08,590
But then the crazy shit like the,

2570
01:14:08,591 --> 01:14:09,240
that we,

2571
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,070
at some point in time someone
has to rewrite everything

2572
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:15,010
they do and we have some group
roll out all this stuff and say,

2573
01:14:15,011 --> 01:14:16,450
these are all just crazy stories,

2574
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,460
but this is what we've learned about life.

2575
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,070
This is what we've learned in
add science to the equation.

2576
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:24,460
This is what we actually know
about the nature of reality.

2577
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:26,620
Here's some confusing aspects of it.

2578
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:29,290
Here's some things that we're
working on trying to find answers to,

2579
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:31,790
but this is what we actually know our way.

2580
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:32,531
Exactly.

2581
01:14:32,531 --> 01:14:35,170
It doesn't preclude the idea of worship.

2582
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:35,611
No.

2583
01:14:35,611 --> 01:14:36,444
And you know what?

2584
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:42,540
I don't think that a science and
religion are fundamentally incompatible.

2585
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,990
I do think that science and fundamentalism
are anytime that you get to the

2586
01:14:45,991 --> 01:14:47,310
fundamentals of any sort of,

2587
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:47,970
uh,

2588
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:48,930
religious mindset,

2589
01:14:48,931 --> 01:14:49,141
yes.

2590
01:14:49,141 --> 01:14:52,620
That is incompatible with
really strict ideologies.

2591
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:53,820
Anytime it's very dangerous,

2592
01:14:53,821 --> 01:14:54,750
even patriotism,

2593
01:14:54,751 --> 01:14:55,171
it's very,

2594
01:14:55,171 --> 01:14:55,950
very dangerous.

2595
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,570
I personally am an atheist.

2596
01:14:57,571 --> 01:15:00,300
I personally chose to kind of throw
the baby out with the bathwater on that

2597
01:15:00,301 --> 01:15:03,930
because I don't see anything redeeming
in religion that I can't find outside of

2598
01:15:03,931 --> 01:15:04,650
religion.

2599
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:07,170
So I don't believe in
anything supernatural.

2600
01:15:07,171 --> 01:15:08,640
I don't believe in God.

2601
01:15:08,641 --> 01:15:10,050
I don't believe in ghosts.

2602
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:11,510
And Yeah.

2603
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:13,900
Have you watched [inaudible] watch?

2604
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:16,633
Um,

2605
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:17,300
uh,

2606
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,081
no.

2607
01:15:18,081 --> 01:15:18,880
I have no edge.

2608
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,180
It goes tending states.

2609
01:15:20,181 --> 01:15:21,950
They claim to have serious evidence.

2610
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:22,813
I'm sure.

2611
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:24,670
James.

2612
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:24,950
Hey,

2613
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:27,440
how dare you got one of
those guys on the show.

2614
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:27,771
Yeah.

2615
01:15:27,771 --> 01:15:28,604
Watch out.

2616
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:30,281
Do you notice,

2617
01:15:30,281 --> 01:15:30,421
I,

2618
01:15:30,421 --> 01:15:34,470
I've noticed that you've had my friend
Jason Silva on the show before and Jason

2619
01:15:34,471 --> 01:15:35,280
has this.

2620
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:35,880
Yeah,

2621
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,210
yeah,

2622
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:36,511
yeah.

2623
01:15:36,511 --> 01:15:39,960
And he has a gift for
that kind of spiritual,

2624
01:15:39,961 --> 01:15:44,250
almost a warship like wonder of
the natural world of the cosmos.

2625
01:15:44,251 --> 01:15:45,930
That is not a religious thing at all,

2626
01:15:45,931 --> 01:15:48,180
but it gives you that feeling
that you get from religion.

2627
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:52,260
I actually have a quote on my
tattooed on my ribs down my left side.

2628
01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:56,340
That's a quote from Carl Sagan that
says we are away for the cosmos to know

2629
01:15:56,341 --> 01:15:57,174
itself.

2630
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:01,470
And it's really powerful to me because
it almost gives me that feedback that a

2631
01:16:01,471 --> 01:16:02,940
lot of people get from religion,

2632
01:16:02,941 --> 01:16:04,470
but I don't need to get it from religion.

2633
01:16:04,471 --> 01:16:06,240
I get it from kind of the
wonder of the universe.

2634
01:16:06,241 --> 01:16:09,720
So if you really think about what he's
saying is that the universe is not

2635
01:16:09,721 --> 01:16:13,410
conscious and there is no great
conscious organizer out there,

2636
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,980
so the universe can't really reflect
on itself because it can't think,

2637
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:20,250
but we as human beings are
made of the stuff of stars.

2638
01:16:20,251 --> 01:16:25,251
All of the molecules in our bodies are
traceable to molecular phenomena that was

2639
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:27,720
exploded in the furnace of a star.

2640
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:32,610
So because we are made of the stuff of
stars and because our molecules organized

2641
01:16:32,611 --> 01:16:36,210
in such a way to make us higher
thinking cognitive beings and we can to

2642
01:16:36,211 --> 01:16:40,440
contemplate our place in the
vast expanses of the universe,

2643
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:43,940
we are away for the universe to know
itself for the cosmos to know it.

2644
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:48,050
Carl Sagan was high as he probably was too

2645
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:55,010
love that you used to love to smoke
pot and just stare at the stars.

2646
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:56,381
He probably had to,

2647
01:16:56,381 --> 01:16:57,070
and that's the thing.

2648
01:16:57,070 --> 01:17:02,070
He was a a working scientist who made so
many discoveries and who contributed so

2649
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,360
much to man's understanding of science.

2650
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:06,850
He was using a drug that wasn't,

2651
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,220
it wasn't like he was on acid and
claiming have all of these huge expanded

2652
01:17:11,221 --> 01:17:12,390
consciousness experiences.

2653
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:15,240
He was using a drug that
hardly fucks you up.

2654
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:16,340
Like to be honest,

2655
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:16,500
it,

2656
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,281
it hardly,

2657
01:17:17,281 --> 01:17:21,960
it alters your consciousness so slightly
that he could still work and he could

2658
01:17:21,961 --> 01:17:23,940
still make these incredible discoveries,

2659
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:28,560
but he could also find the emotional
valance and like the poetry in the cosmos

2660
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:29,100
and then,

2661
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:32,790
and then tell it to us in such a way
that I think that he inspired an entire

2662
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:36,330
generation of thinkers to grow up to
become scientists or at least to be

2663
01:17:36,331 --> 01:17:38,460
scientifically literate and appreciate,

2664
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:39,150
um,

2665
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:39,420
what,

2666
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:40,650
what nature can tell us.

2667
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:45,320
And he was very open about his
appreciation for cannabis and that whole,

2668
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:45,910
uh,

2669
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:46,470
that,

2670
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:48,060
that whole quest for information.

2671
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:48,630
Yeah.

2672
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:49,830
He was a fascinating,

2673
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,060
fascinating guys.

2674
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:52,920
I love the fact that it was a pot head.

2675
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:53,201
Yeah.

2676
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:56,050
You were just talking about getting
high and watching Cosmos right before we

2677
01:17:56,051 --> 01:17:57,100
started recording.

2678
01:17:57,670 --> 01:18:01,330
And Are you excited about the new cosmos
that I'm Seth macfarlane is producing

2679
01:18:01,331 --> 01:18:06,280
with Carl Sagan widow Andrew Yun and
they are going to be producing a new

2680
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:08,620
version for Fox hosted
by Neil degrasse Tyson.

2681
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:10,060
Be Awesome.

2682
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:10,893
I know,

2683
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:11,381
I know.

2684
01:18:11,381 --> 01:18:12,214
So exciting.

2685
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:14,510
Yeah,

2686
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:17,780
those are some of my most
humble moments ever is.

2687
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:18,320
Um,

2688
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:18,940
I,

2689
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:20,570
I got ahold of,

2690
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:22,220
I don't remember which,

2691
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,540
which series it was,

2692
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:28,750
but it was this a 14 DVD series on the
universe and it was one after another,

2693
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,060
just mind blowing and credible thing.

2694
01:18:32,061 --> 01:18:34,580
I had just gotten this up
projection thing and my house.

2695
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:36,650
So it was like the sound was cool.

2696
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:37,640
The image was crazy.

2697
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:40,640
And for fucking days I
never left that room.

2698
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:46,240
I was just watching these fucking
terrifying documentaries on Supernova.

2699
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:52,240
The possibility of a hyper Nova exploding
near us would just eliminate life on

2700
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:54,590
earth instantaneously.

2701
01:18:54,591 --> 01:18:58,610
And the fact they found out that going
on every day all over the universe,

2702
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:01,340
they first thought there
was like an alien war.

2703
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:05,480
The first thought that there was
a fucking alien war out in space.

2704
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:09,110
They were detecting all these explosions
and they thought that like Martians

2705
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:09,944
were shooting at me.

2706
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:10,310
Yeah,

2707
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:10,631
well,

2708
01:19:10,631 --> 01:19:10,961
you know,

2709
01:19:10,961 --> 01:19:11,350
you got,

2710
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:13,060
you got to explore all
options as scientists.

2711
01:19:13,061 --> 01:19:15,490
And this is something that
I do everyday in my job.

2712
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,690
It's mind blowing.

2713
01:19:16,691 --> 01:19:17,350
Like just,

2714
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:20,350
just yesterday I did a
Skype interview with um,

2715
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:25,380
with a scientist in Washington who wrote
this paper basically that show some

2716
01:19:26,141 --> 01:19:26,974
evidence.

2717
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,690
They're not claiming that we are,

2718
01:19:28,691 --> 01:19:33,160
but they're saying it's not completely
crazy to assume that we might be a

2719
01:19:33,161 --> 01:19:34,180
simulation.

2720
01:19:34,410 --> 01:19:34,840
Yes.

2721
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:35,080
Yeah.

2722
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:39,460
We've talked about that like a hundred
times and there's legitimate evidence

2723
01:19:39,461 --> 01:19:44,461
there that if we can simulate
the fundamental workings
of our own universe right

2724
01:19:45,011 --> 01:19:45,161
now,

2725
01:19:45,161 --> 01:19:46,930
we can only do it on a femto meter scale.

2726
01:19:46,931 --> 01:19:51,070
So we can basically simulate the
inner workings inside of a nucleus.

2727
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:52,150
We can't go any bigger,

2728
01:19:52,151 --> 01:19:55,570
but if we can simulate that and
eventually we get to a point where we can

2729
01:19:55,571 --> 01:19:58,450
simulate more and more and
more of kind of living,

2730
01:19:58,451 --> 01:20:00,190
breathing quantum space.

2731
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:03,580
Who's to say that we
ourselves aren't a simulation.

2732
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:07,830
I just told Joe the other day how I've
been living my life as if we are a

2733
01:20:07,831 --> 01:20:08,664
simulation

2734
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,230
and if you look at it that way,

2735
01:20:10,231 --> 01:20:11,610
it really freaks you out.

2736
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,640
And I have this new thing where every
time I talked about the simulation,

2737
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:16,860
I see an Asian come
come around the corner.

2738
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:17,421
So good.

2739
01:20:17,421 --> 01:20:18,960
The body guards of the simulation,

2740
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:19,771
trust me,

2741
01:20:19,771 --> 01:20:20,521
think of it that way.

2742
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:21,360
Like it will freak you out.

2743
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,910
One of those jacks in your pocket.

2744
01:20:23,911 --> 01:20:24,181
All of them.

2745
01:20:24,181 --> 01:20:24,410
No.

2746
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:24,751
I'm like,

2747
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:25,140
no.

2748
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:26,460
We've been talking about it

2749
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:29,900
for several years now for whatever reason,

2750
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:30,560
but live.

2751
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,950
But now start living it though.

2752
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:33,680
Like live your life
like it just for a week.

2753
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:35,230
Everything is assimilation.

2754
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:35,920
That's the,

2755
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:36,361
that's what I am.

2756
01:20:36,361 --> 01:20:36,881
I exist.

2757
01:20:36,881 --> 01:20:40,240
How do you even live your life that way
freaks you out because then all of a

2758
01:20:40,241 --> 01:20:43,210
sudden it's like an addict
lived his life story in a story,

2759
01:20:43,211 --> 01:20:44,460
in a story situation.

2760
01:20:44,461 --> 01:20:46,180
Like he's done a game of final fantasy.

2761
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:46,910
Okay.

2762
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:47,120
That,

2763
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:47,740
that,

2764
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:48,573
that's what he's doing.

2765
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,050
I just remember him bublé Kersey again.

2766
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:54,200
Oh Blake curse the Lakers.

2767
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:55,770
That never worked.

2768
01:20:57,370 --> 01:20:57,921
How it worked.

2769
01:20:57,921 --> 01:20:58,710
Joe didn't work,

2770
01:20:58,710 --> 01:20:59,730
you were just dried.

2771
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:04,000
But those Twitter people who
tried to Bublé it lay denial,

2772
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:04,890
that shit doesn't work.

2773
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:05,460
Uh,

2774
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:05,851
I never,

2775
01:21:05,851 --> 01:21:06,571
I never heard.

2776
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:10,230
I'm Todd have to listen on the tosh show
the other day you were on that you're

2777
01:21:10,231 --> 01:21:10,810
on Tosh.

2778
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:11,050
Dot.

2779
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:13,070
Online was talking about to play,

2780
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,040
not it should.

2781
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,450
Anybody else wanted to watch me?

2782
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:18,600
Does that mean Michael [inaudible] he's
going to pop up no life all the time.

2783
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:18,970
No,

2784
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:19,650
no.

2785
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,101
First of all,

2786
01:21:20,101 --> 01:21:20,671
the curse is this.

2787
01:21:20,671 --> 01:21:20,971
Fuck.

2788
01:21:20,971 --> 01:21:21,870
We'll talk about Michael.

2789
01:21:21,871 --> 01:21:26,130
Bill Blake for the next four days
asking me if I'd been bublé cars.

2790
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:26,650
Didn't know.

2791
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:27,061
Amanda,

2792
01:21:27,061 --> 01:21:27,320
your,

2793
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,153
Your Games,

2794
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:29,250
you've play Chris.

2795
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,380
Awesome dear.

2796
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:32,940
For the next 30 days,

2797
01:21:32,941 --> 01:21:35,660
you're going to be laid out
of your mind because I get,

2798
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:37,260
do I get to leave here?

2799
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:37,680
Right?

2800
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,570
And then I never have to see.

2801
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:39,553
I know

2802
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:44,400
on Twitter you got to do us bublé updates,

2803
01:21:44,401 --> 01:21:45,850
but I bet you'll be blue blade out.

2804
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:47,810
Frothy bublé all over.

2805
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,653
Yeah.

2806
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:51,110
Is He's being an asshole right now.

2807
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:51,831
He's sick.

2808
01:21:51,831 --> 01:21:52,570
And those people on,

2809
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:55,170
you know it is Christmas time
and he does have a new album out,

2810
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:58,190
which means I'm going to start fucking
hearing those songs everywhere I go.

2811
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,310
I've never heard a single Michael Booboo.

2812
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,110
So you have,

2813
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:02,370
you just don't know.

2814
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,260
I don't have that gene.

2815
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:07,140
Everything's in the background
until your attention is drawn to it.

2816
01:22:07,141 --> 01:22:08,310
And then that's all you'll see in here.

2817
01:22:08,311 --> 01:22:09,750
I'm missing that part in the brain.

2818
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:11,020
The simulation product,

2819
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:12,540
the brain is replaced with hate.

2820
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:13,950
No hate for what?

2821
01:22:13,951 --> 01:22:14,730
For whatever.

2822
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:16,230
For whatever fucking something bad.

2823
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:17,573
Anything bad.

2824
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:18,530
I don't,

2825
01:22:18,530 --> 01:22:19,341
I can't listen to it.

2826
01:22:19,341 --> 01:22:20,101
It doesn't work.

2827
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:22,710
It's like a dog whistle
and then I don't hear it.

2828
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:26,920
And the acid bird that you hear
chirping in the morning at 5:00 AM,

2829
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:28,840
those are software updates to the,

2830
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,040
to the whole simulation.

2831
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,360
This is yours.

2832
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:32,210
So Malaysia,

2833
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:33,970
fuck your simulation to hear that.

2834
01:22:33,971 --> 01:22:35,260
Way Different than ours.

2835
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:36,400
Hmm.

2836
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:36,980
But this,

2837
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:41,020
what's fascinating about the simulation
theory is these guys that are talking

2838
01:22:41,021 --> 01:22:45,860
about that self correcting computer code
that they've found in the computations

2839
01:22:45,861 --> 01:22:46,694
of string theory.

2840
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:47,170
Okay.

2841
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:47,501
It's a,

2842
01:22:47,501 --> 01:22:48,250
it's a,

2843
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:53,250
it's discovered in 1940 by this
guy named Claude Claude Shannon,

2844
01:22:54,161 --> 01:22:57,630
and they've discovered these
exact same self correct.

2845
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:01,120
And Computer Code in bedded in
the equations of string theory.

2846
01:23:01,121 --> 01:23:02,200
I don't understand that.

2847
01:23:02,290 --> 01:23:03,040
I don't really either,

2848
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,491
to be honest.

2849
01:23:03,491 --> 01:23:03,851
I just,

2850
01:23:03,851 --> 01:23:06,040
I just interviewed a
string who was in town from

2851
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,150
the University of Paris.

2852
01:23:07,151 --> 01:23:10,990
I interviewed him on Monday and just kind
of tried to get a good primer on what

2853
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:11,890
string theory is,

2854
01:23:11,891 --> 01:23:13,150
what it sets out to do.

2855
01:23:13,151 --> 01:23:16,330
And I'm going to be doing
writing a video on that soon.

2856
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:16,780
So,

2857
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:20,710
so hopefully I'll be able to kind of
offer a good fundamental primer on string

2858
01:23:20,711 --> 01:23:21,550
theory to my,

2859
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:22,623
to my viewers.

2860
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:26,580
But I don't really understand this thing
with the code because the string theory

2861
01:23:26,581 --> 01:23:27,101
is right.

2862
01:23:27,101 --> 01:23:28,510
Their own mathematics.

2863
01:23:28,511 --> 01:23:28,811
I mean,

2864
01:23:28,811 --> 01:23:29,410
that's,

2865
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:30,070
that's,

2866
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:33,790
that's what a lot of this
kind of theoretical cosmology,

2867
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:36,190
this quantum level cosmology is about.

2868
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,400
A lot of times these aren't things
that are really experimentally testable

2869
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:39,761
there.

2870
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:40,620
Things where,

2871
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:41,080
um,

2872
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:45,280
these physicists are trying to map
out or trying to understand the basic

2873
01:23:45,281 --> 01:23:46,001
particles,

2874
01:23:46,001 --> 01:23:47,170
the basic waves,

2875
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:47,670
um,

2876
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:48,070
that,

2877
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:51,370
that make up the universe and how do
they interact with each other using the

2878
01:23:51,371 --> 01:23:51,971
strong force,

2879
01:23:51,971 --> 01:23:52,810
the weak force.

2880
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:53,260
Um,

2881
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:54,910
how does gravity come into play with this,

2882
01:23:54,911 --> 01:23:57,820
which is a huge problem for them right
now so that they can get this unified

2883
01:23:57,821 --> 01:23:58,330
theory.

2884
01:23:58,330 --> 01:24:00,070
Most of it right now is just math.

2885
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:00,971
Like to be honest,

2886
01:24:00,971 --> 01:24:01,180
it's,

2887
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:01,511
it's all,

2888
01:24:01,511 --> 01:24:04,630
whether or not the math works
in these different scenarios,

2889
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:06,040
but they're writing the math,

2890
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:06,341
you know,

2891
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:06,521
they're,

2892
01:24:06,521 --> 01:24:09,070
they're trying to learn about these
things and they're trying to document them

2893
01:24:09,071 --> 01:24:11,110
and then figure out how
to make the math work.

2894
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,490
Once they do that,

2895
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:16,150
the difficulty comes in experimenting
with them because these are such small

2896
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:19,570
particles that occur at such high
energies that you can really only get them

2897
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:20,321
like in a,

2898
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:22,540
in a particle accelerator like at cern.

2899
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:23,470
Or You could find them,

2900
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:23,890
you know,

2901
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:24,221
in,

2902
01:24:24,221 --> 01:24:25,690
in a black hole for example.

2903
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:27,460
But we can't study a black hole directly.

2904
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:28,870
So in string theory,

2905
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:32,080
this shit is so small that you can't
even get these things out of a particle

2906
01:24:32,081 --> 01:24:32,914
accelerator.

2907
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:33,880
So at this point,

2908
01:24:33,881 --> 01:24:36,880
the only way that they can study string
theory is by looking at the cosmic

2909
01:24:36,881 --> 01:24:38,590
microwave background radiation,

2910
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:42,010
which is the radiation that
was put off from the big bang.

2911
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:45,640
And it's always around us in
the background and they've
been able to kind of map

2912
01:24:45,641 --> 01:24:49,270
at signature and they can
look for basically evidence,

2913
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:50,560
much later evidence,

2914
01:24:50,561 --> 01:24:50,920
you know,

2915
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,450
13 billion years later,

2916
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:53,830
almost 14 billion years later,

2917
01:24:53,831 --> 01:24:57,190
evidence of what happened in the big bang
where these tiny particles would have

2918
01:24:57,191 --> 01:24:57,790
come from.

2919
01:24:57,790 --> 01:24:58,630
That's incredible.

2920
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,230
It's crazy.

2921
01:24:59,230 --> 01:24:59,981
I mean it's kind of like,

2922
01:24:59,981 --> 01:25:01,240
what the fuck did I even just say?

2923
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:04,430
I'm not really sure that I
understand what I just said,

2924
01:25:04,431 --> 01:25:06,890
but I muscled through a real mind blower.

2925
01:25:06,891 --> 01:25:09,900
There's going to be so many people
pausing and googling during this pocket.

2926
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:14,600
That's not what they're going
to be good when you fuck.

2927
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:16,390
That's hilarious Brian.

2928
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,470
And so many good things happened

2929
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:19,371
this weekend.

2930
01:25:19,371 --> 01:25:20,240
Science too.

2931
01:25:20,241 --> 01:25:20,930
Like I have,

2932
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:21,650
um,

2933
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:23,130
I had this great thing that I,

2934
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:25,340
it's been floating around Facebook,

2935
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:25,760
um,

2936
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,070
from I fucking love
sciences Facebook page.

2937
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:28,671
If you don't follow,

2938
01:25:28,671 --> 01:25:29,504
I fucking love it.

2939
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,410
Do you mind if I ask a
question before you yeah,

2940
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:32,170
sure.

2941
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:34,870
When when these scientists write the code,

2942
01:25:34,871 --> 01:25:35,410
like when,

2943
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:37,510
when you see those
documentaries or those shows,

2944
01:25:37,511 --> 01:25:39,820
whenever they have guys talking about
string theory and they're sitting there

2945
01:25:39,821 --> 01:25:41,290
with a yellow legal pad.

2946
01:25:41,291 --> 01:25:41,720
Yeah.

2947
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,000
Scribbling furiously.

2948
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:43,330
Yep.

2949
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:44,380
What the fuck are they doing?

2950
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:44,840
Yeah,

2951
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:45,480
it's,

2952
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,000
that's,

2953
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,010
I don't know what did it,

2954
01:25:48,030 --> 01:25:48,880
what are they saying?

2955
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:51,010
So they're looking basically at,

2956
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,840
at the math of the,

2957
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:53,150
they're,

2958
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:57,100
they're trying to look at the universe
and they're trying to describe it in the

2959
01:25:57,101 --> 01:25:59,020
only language that we
can describe those very,

2960
01:25:59,021 --> 01:25:59,920
very small things then,

2961
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:00,910
which is math.

2962
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:02,260
So they're looking at all of these,

2963
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:07,290
basically these forces that help
particle a interact with particle B,

2964
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,233
maybe there's like a,

2965
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:08,691
you know,

2966
01:26:08,691 --> 01:26:10,070
a glue on in between.

2967
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:13,130
They're trying to look at the
electromagnetic forces between them.

2968
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:18,220
They're trying to see basically all
of the quantum fluctuations of this,

2969
01:26:19,161 --> 01:26:23,600
of this soup of particles that make up
all the things that you see right now,

2970
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:26,660
and they could be in any given place.

2971
01:26:26,661 --> 01:26:29,900
It's very difficult to know exactly how
fast they're moving or where they are.

2972
01:26:29,901 --> 01:26:32,480
So they have to kind
of look at a range of,

2973
01:26:32,481 --> 01:26:37,481
of states of these particles and they're
trying to work out all of the math to

2974
01:26:37,701 --> 01:26:41,090
be able to get a whole spectrum of how
these particles interact with each other.

2975
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:44,210
And once they have a really
solid understanding of how
these particles interact

2976
01:26:44,211 --> 01:26:44,870
with each other,

2977
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:48,800
then we can start to really understand
why an atom looks like an atom and how

2978
01:26:48,801 --> 01:26:52,400
that Adam combines with that Adam to
make a molecule of something and then how

2979
01:26:52,401 --> 01:26:53,420
all those molecules coming.

2980
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:55,730
We're pretty good at
knowing from the top down.

2981
01:26:55,731 --> 01:26:56,240
You know,

2982
01:26:56,240 --> 01:27:00,500
we can look at very big things like
universes and subdivide into galaxies and

2983
01:27:00,501 --> 01:27:01,970
subdivide into solar systems.

2984
01:27:01,971 --> 01:27:04,910
And then we can even look at earth and
look at all of the life that's on earth

2985
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:06,800
within our own bodies.

2986
01:27:06,801 --> 01:27:08,300
We can look at our organ systems,

2987
01:27:08,301 --> 01:27:10,070
we can look at us at the cellular level,

2988
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:12,920
we can even break down a sale and
look at it at the molecular level.

2989
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:15,650
But once you get smaller than an atom,

2990
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,660
things start acting fucking weird.

2991
01:27:17,661 --> 01:27:21,320
And there's a whole new set of laws
that governs the quantum world.

2992
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:23,540
Superpositions the freakiest one.

2993
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:23,811
Yeah.

2994
01:27:23,811 --> 01:27:24,830
It's like anything about,

2995
01:27:24,831 --> 01:27:25,041
you know,

2996
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:27,200
because it's so hard to
measure these things,

2997
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:27,330
it's,

2998
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:32,060
it's really difficult to measure their
speed and their position at the same time

2999
01:27:32,061 --> 01:27:35,210
because they're moving and they're
moving really fucking fast and they,

3000
01:27:35,211 --> 01:27:35,810
they,

3001
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:38,570
their properties change depending
on what position they're in.

3002
01:27:38,571 --> 01:27:40,250
And so once you get down to these really,

3003
01:27:40,251 --> 01:27:40,941
really small,

3004
01:27:40,941 --> 01:27:41,241
small,

3005
01:27:41,241 --> 01:27:43,790
small but very high energy
levels of the world,

3006
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:44,431
then you,

3007
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:46,920
you start to see different
theories that try to describe them.

3008
01:27:46,921 --> 01:27:48,620
And string theory is only
one of those theories.

3009
01:27:48,621 --> 01:27:50,690
It's actually one of the more kind of,

3010
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:51,110
um,

3011
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:51,950
bizarre theories.

3012
01:27:51,951 --> 01:27:53,670
A lot of people aren't
string theorists in,

3013
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:55,430
in theoretical cosmology,

3014
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:59,570
but string theory is one of the most
promising theories that tries to combine

3015
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:02,900
this kind of Newtonian and
an Einsteinian view together.

3016
01:28:02,901 --> 01:28:07,901
So this quantum molecular view and also
having a quantum theory of gravity,

3017
01:28:08,121 --> 01:28:11,390
which gravity still doesn't really operate
the same way that most people think

3018
01:28:11,391 --> 01:28:13,130
that quantum mechanics operates.

3019
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:18,110
So a big problem that quantum physicists
have is trying to figure out how to fit

3020
01:28:18,111 --> 01:28:21,770
Newtonian gravity into the equation so
that they can get a grand unified theory

3021
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:22,663
of everything.

3022
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:23,260
Um,

3023
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:25,460
and right now gravity
doesn't really seem to fit.

3024
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,890
Now when they measure particles
that are in super position,

3025
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:32,310
meaning they're in motion
and still at the same time,

3026
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:32,940
how,

3027
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:33,930
what the fuck is that?

3028
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:35,573
What does that mean?

3029
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:35,950
I don't

3030
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:38,740
think it necessarily means that they're
in motion and still at the same time,

3031
01:28:38,741 --> 01:28:42,010
I think what it means is that
they can only measure them.

3032
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:42,731
It's,

3033
01:28:42,731 --> 01:28:43,001
you know,

3034
01:28:43,001 --> 01:28:44,170
a lot of times it's one of the,

3035
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:47,470
becomes one of these questions where
like if a tree falls in the forest,

3036
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:48,850
does it still make a sound?

3037
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:53,590
If we as an observer are trying
to understand the molecular world,

3038
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:54,210
the middle,

3039
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:55,690
just by observing it,

3040
01:28:55,691 --> 01:28:56,140
by the,

3041
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:56,951
because we're having,

3042
01:28:56,951 --> 01:28:58,060
we can't just look at it,

3043
01:28:58,090 --> 01:28:59,170
it's too fucking small.

3044
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:01,060
So we have to come up
with all these crazy rigs,

3045
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:05,790
be able to see things and just buy all
of the technology that we need to use to

3046
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:06,211
see it.

3047
01:29:06,211 --> 01:29:07,440
We are affecting it.

3048
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:11,250
So it's really impossible to see things
in their native state when they're the

3049
01:29:11,251 --> 01:29:13,500
small without actually
affecting those things.

3050
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:13,870
Hm.

3051
01:29:13,870 --> 01:29:15,130
And now how does that work?

3052
01:29:15,610 --> 01:29:17,380
Because that's the other thing like,

3053
01:29:17,381 --> 01:29:17,800
um,

3054
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,290
about the,

3055
01:29:19,630 --> 01:29:24,630
the idea of the observer
and quantum mechanics is my
friend Jay d shout out to j

3056
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:29,170
d he's a physicist.

3057
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:29,831
He,

3058
01:29:29,831 --> 01:29:30,664
uh,

3059
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:35,790
he related to me that the real issue
is in measuring it and that when you

3060
01:29:36,341 --> 01:29:37,001
measure it,

3061
01:29:37,001 --> 01:29:38,140
that's the observer.

3062
01:29:38,141 --> 01:29:41,860
And it's not necessarily that you are
looking at something or that human

3063
01:29:41,861 --> 01:29:43,120
intention or visual,

3064
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:43,661
you know,

3065
01:29:43,661 --> 01:29:43,880
the,

3066
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:44,100
your,

3067
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,200
your visual Cortex,

3068
01:29:45,201 --> 01:29:46,750
this is tuned in on something.

3069
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:46,930
Yeah.

3070
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:47,950
It's just the measuring,

3071
01:29:47,951 --> 01:29:49,720
the act of measuring itself changes.

3072
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:50,210
Yeah.

3073
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:52,530
Because it's not like we're
not talking about big things.

3074
01:29:52,531 --> 01:29:55,670
So like I could look at this
water bottle and I could,

3075
01:29:55,671 --> 01:29:55,911
you know,

3076
01:29:55,911 --> 01:29:56,930
make judgements about it.

3077
01:29:56,931 --> 01:29:59,750
I could hold a ruler up next to
it and make judgements about it.

3078
01:30:00,050 --> 01:30:00,500
I,

3079
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:04,340
it's so large that the tools that I use
to measure it don't interact with its

3080
01:30:04,341 --> 01:30:05,360
intrinsic properties.

3081
01:30:05,361 --> 01:30:06,710
But once you get down
to things that are very,

3082
01:30:06,711 --> 01:30:09,950
very small and you could
no longer use a microscope,

3083
01:30:09,951 --> 01:30:10,581
for example,

3084
01:30:10,581 --> 01:30:11,210
to see it,

3085
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:14,060
and you have to get down to more
creative ways to measure it,

3086
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:17,570
all of a sudden the creative ways that
you measure it actually process it as,

3087
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,470
as they measure it.

3088
01:30:18,471 --> 01:30:19,310
And so they're,

3089
01:30:19,311 --> 01:30:22,220
they're interacting with it and
they're changing its position,

3090
01:30:22,221 --> 01:30:22,881
for example.

3091
01:30:22,881 --> 01:30:27,020
Or they're changing the way that it acts
because the only way to really see it,

3092
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,030
it's to see it downstream
of something else.

3093
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:30,470
When he said that to me,

3094
01:30:30,471 --> 01:30:35,471
I actually got upset because there's
been so much malarkey that I've read and

3095
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:42,131
seen online about the idea of the
observer changing the results that I felt

3096
01:30:42,651 --> 01:30:42,801
like,

3097
01:30:42,801 --> 01:30:44,930
why did everybody have
to turn into Voodoo?

3098
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:45,420
Oh,

3099
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:46,830
I love that you just said that.

3100
01:30:46,831 --> 01:30:47,161
I did.

3101
01:30:47,161 --> 01:30:49,530
I did an interview with
Brian Greene who's,

3102
01:30:49,531 --> 01:30:49,721
you know,

3103
01:30:49,721 --> 01:30:53,160
a pretty renowned physicist and I ended
up doing splitting it into two parts.

3104
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:55,620
One was about black holes and one
was about the multiverse theory,

3105
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:59,340
but one segment that we talked about in
between that I couldn't really work into

3106
01:30:59,341 --> 01:31:00,174
a story.

3107
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:02,940
It bums me out because it's such
great footage because I asked him,

3108
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:04,380
how do you feel about movies?

3109
01:31:04,381 --> 01:31:05,700
Like what the bleep do we know?

3110
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:09,210
How do you feel about it when people try
to take what you understand about the

3111
01:31:09,211 --> 01:31:14,211
quantum world and what you understand
about the cosmos and apply it to like Woo

3112
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,360
pseudoscience and say,

3113
01:31:15,361 --> 01:31:15,511
oh,

3114
01:31:15,511 --> 01:31:19,170
but our thoughts are quantum and now
all of a sudden we can use quantum

3115
01:31:19,171 --> 01:31:23,400
mechanics to describe how we think and
how our thoughts live outside of our

3116
01:31:23,401 --> 01:31:24,840
bodies and all this bullshit.

3117
01:31:24,841 --> 01:31:29,841
And I mean he was very explicit that
no person who studies this stuff,

3118
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:35,190
who's dedicated their lives
to understanding this would
ever try to apply it to

3119
01:31:35,191 --> 01:31:39,090
a region of understanding where
the math doesn't make sense.

3120
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:42,750
And so all of the people who are
trying to shill quantum mechanics as an

3121
01:31:42,751 --> 01:31:47,430
explanation for thought or behavior
or love or any of these woo things,

3122
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:49,560
none of them are fucking physicists.

3123
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,990
That should probably tell us something.

3124
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:53,680
The whole thing was that ramp,

3125
01:31:53,681 --> 01:31:56,110
the lady who's a she channels.

3126
01:31:56,170 --> 01:31:57,003
Yeah.

3127
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:57,721
All right there.

3128
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:00,040
It's not even telling
what the fuck is going on.

3129
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:01,240
They're just having her talk.

3130
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:02,141
But they're not telling you,

3131
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:02,351
oh no,

3132
01:32:02,351 --> 01:32:02,500
no,

3133
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:02,611
no,

3134
01:32:02,611 --> 01:32:02,890
no.

3135
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:03,790
She's channeling.

3136
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:05,860
She's channeling some fucking alien.

3137
01:32:05,861 --> 01:32:08,410
So many of the people in that
movie were misrepresented.

3138
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:08,801
I mean,

3139
01:32:08,801 --> 01:32:12,100
so many people where they would take
like three hours of footage from an

3140
01:32:12,101 --> 01:32:15,520
interview and then cut it up in such
a way that it Kinda sorta sounds like

3141
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:16,540
they're making their point.

3142
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:18,310
I did an episode of Larry King.

3143
01:32:18,311 --> 01:32:20,710
It was one of the first things I
ever did when I started doing science

3144
01:32:20,711 --> 01:32:24,010
communication and being more on air
when I was getting out of the university

3145
01:32:24,190 --> 01:32:26,020
system and doing what I do now.

3146
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:28,510
And the episode was
all about neuroscience.

3147
01:32:28,511 --> 01:32:33,160
And one of the things that I said on it
was some people would say that the mind

3148
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:36,070
is an entity outside
of the brain that can,

3149
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:36,660
you know,

3150
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:37,210
um,

3151
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:38,350
put forces on the brain.

3152
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:41,590
But we know as modern neuroscientists
that mind and brain are the same thing.

3153
01:32:41,591 --> 01:32:43,060
They're just two sides of the same coin.

3154
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:45,580
And how did they run the Promo for that?

3155
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:50,220
The mind is an entity outside
of the brain that can affect,

3156
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:50,610
you know,

3157
01:32:50,610 --> 01:32:52,990
they just completely
took it out of context.

3158
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:53,630
They went,

3159
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:54,310
whew.

3160
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:58,360
I mean luckily inside of the episode
they showed it in full so they could see

3161
01:32:58,361 --> 01:32:58,931
what I was saying.

3162
01:32:58,931 --> 01:33:00,100
But how easy is it?

3163
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:01,420
And as scientist,

3164
01:33:01,421 --> 01:33:04,990
you can't be worrying about that when
you're trying to explain something.

3165
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,900
You just want to explain it and
hope that they don't bastardize it.

3166
01:33:08,110 --> 01:33:10,630
The problem is the people who are
making these things have an agenda

3167
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:11,520
under the,

3168
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:11,970
um,

3169
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:15,390
the idea of consciousness or thought
being outside of the brain is a very

3170
01:33:15,391 --> 01:33:16,440
fascinating idea.

3171
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:19,950
The idea that the brain is actually
just an antenna that tunes it all in.

3172
01:33:19,951 --> 01:33:22,800
And that's why when different
areas of it get damaged,

3173
01:33:22,801 --> 01:33:25,710
that's areas that are designed
to tune in to whatever,

3174
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:27,570
whatever is out there.

3175
01:33:27,571 --> 01:33:32,571
The idea of the Akashic records and the
idea that like knowledge and so much of

3176
01:33:33,301 --> 01:33:37,890
what makes us human beings is actually
like virtually retrievable from the air.

3177
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:38,311
Well,

3178
01:33:38,311 --> 01:33:40,980
I think that there's a way to look
at that without being woo woo,

3179
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:42,780
like I don't think it's
physically in the air,

3180
01:33:42,781 --> 01:33:47,781
but there there is obviously this
idea that thoughts and ideas,

3181
01:33:47,910 --> 01:33:49,380
once we put them into language,

3182
01:33:49,381 --> 01:33:51,120
once we write them down on paper,

3183
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:53,730
they do exist outside of us at this point.

3184
01:33:53,731 --> 01:33:56,700
Somebody else can appreciate them
and they can live well past us,

3185
01:33:56,701 --> 01:34:00,390
but I still think that all of
that knowledge was conceptualized,

3186
01:34:00,391 --> 01:34:01,350
synthesized,

3187
01:34:01,351 --> 01:34:01,981
remembered,

3188
01:34:01,981 --> 01:34:02,761
retrieved,

3189
01:34:02,761 --> 01:34:04,740
whatever by a physical organ,

3190
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:09,920
which is our brain and that thought
is fundamentally a function of brain

3191
01:34:10,651 --> 01:34:11,310
activity.

3192
01:34:11,310 --> 01:34:11,761
Like I'm,

3193
01:34:11,761 --> 01:34:15,240
I'm a really hardcore materialist when
when it comes to that kind of stuff.

3194
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,890
What is consciousness though?

3195
01:34:16,891 --> 01:34:18,060
That's what's really fascinating.

3196
01:34:18,061 --> 01:34:21,240
It's like what the fuck is that
Beautiful Oregon tuning in?

3197
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:22,231
You know what is,

3198
01:34:22,231 --> 01:34:22,890
when you're,

3199
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:25,200
when you're at your hype level,

3200
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:25,800
when you're,

3201
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:26,220
you're,

3202
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:30,360
you're locked on to some crazy explanation
and you're very passionate and like

3203
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,810
what is that that's
coming through that brain?

3204
01:34:34,130 --> 01:34:34,963
I don't,

3205
01:34:35,190 --> 01:34:36,360
it's not coming through the brain.

3206
01:34:36,361 --> 01:34:37,740
It's being created by the brain.

3207
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:38,431
And to me it's,

3208
01:34:38,431 --> 01:34:39,600
it's the same thing as saying like,

3209
01:34:39,601 --> 01:34:42,900
what is it when an athlete is that peak
performance and their heart is working

3210
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:45,150
the best way that it can possibly work.

3211
01:34:45,151 --> 01:34:48,060
The problem is the brain is
so much more complicated.

3212
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:51,030
There's so much more metabolism
happening in the brain,

3213
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:56,240
and there's so many individual neurons
that have so many connections between

3214
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:57,560
them.

3215
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,540
And there's so many
different kind of options,

3216
01:34:59,541 --> 01:35:03,830
kind of permutations and combinations of
ways that these neurons can communicate

3217
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:08,831
with one another that thought that
consciousness somehow arises from all of

3218
01:35:09,981 --> 01:35:10,791
those connections.

3219
01:35:10,791 --> 01:35:11,361
But that's the,

3220
01:35:11,361 --> 01:35:13,280
that's the holy grail of neuroscience.

3221
01:35:13,281 --> 01:35:14,600
And this is what I love.

3222
01:35:14,601 --> 01:35:16,070
This is my background is neuroscience.

3223
01:35:16,071 --> 01:35:16,904
And so when I do,

3224
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:17,300
um,

3225
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:19,790
all of my science reporting and
all of my science commenting,

3226
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:22,910
all the space stuff and
all of the physics stuff,

3227
01:35:22,911 --> 01:35:24,050
I'm not as good at,

3228
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:24,261
you know,

3229
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:25,730
I have to learn it as I go.

3230
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:26,390
Um,

3231
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:28,560
which kind of I think helps me
when I communicate it because I,

3232
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:28,940
I,

3233
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:30,740
I get where people are coming
from when they're like,

3234
01:35:30,741 --> 01:35:32,030
I don't fucking understand this at all.

3235
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:34,310
The neuroscience stuff is
like my bread and butter.

3236
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:35,210
That's what I love.

3237
01:35:35,211 --> 01:35:37,400
And that is the holy grail of neuroscience

3238
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:39,470
pro type dudes.

3239
01:35:39,471 --> 01:35:40,520
Talk about consciousness.

3240
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:43,040
My eyes rolling like Deepak Chopra.

3241
01:35:43,041 --> 01:35:43,401
I just,

3242
01:35:43,401 --> 01:35:46,160
it's really hard for me to not
just discount everything he says.

3243
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:46,881
Really.

3244
01:35:46,881 --> 01:35:47,714
I reason,

3245
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:48,291
I mean,

3246
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:49,620
I know that there's true therapist.

3247
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:50,001
He is,

3248
01:35:50,001 --> 01:35:50,990
he's a whoop peddler

3249
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:55,603
Chopra,

3250
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:56,390
um,

3251
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:57,110
uh,

3252
01:35:57,110 --> 01:35:57,561
Eckhart.

3253
01:35:57,561 --> 01:35:58,394
Totally.

3254
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:01,900
Tony Robbins is that his name is,

3255
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:02,840
loves a cart.

3256
01:36:02,841 --> 01:36:03,231
Totally.

3257
01:36:03,231 --> 01:36:07,490
He's totally is probably the
least hook story of all of them,

3258
01:36:07,491 --> 01:36:08,324
but he's still

3259
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:08,581
well,

3260
01:36:08,581 --> 01:36:08,831
what,

3261
01:36:08,831 --> 01:36:12,780
what do you think is huck story about
providing motivation to people and giving

3262
01:36:12,781 --> 01:36:13,640
people sort of a,

3263
01:36:13,641 --> 01:36:16,170
a framework to work on as far as,

3264
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:16,770
uh,

3265
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:19,650
living in the now and
taking charge of their life,

3266
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:22,900
especially if it's something
that someone like Eckhart Tolle,

3267
01:36:22,901 --> 01:36:23,360
a,

3268
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:23,640
uh,

3269
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:24,600
had personal

3270
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,430
just so compare somebody like a cart.

3271
01:36:26,431 --> 01:36:27,440
Totally goofy.

3272
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:29,490
Robin's compare and Eckhart totally.

3273
01:36:29,491 --> 01:36:31,020
Or an Anthony Robbins to,

3274
01:36:31,021 --> 01:36:31,741
for example,

3275
01:36:31,741 --> 01:36:32,550
somebody like,

3276
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:33,383
um,

3277
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:33,870
um,

3278
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:33,991
oh,

3279
01:36:33,991 --> 01:36:34,651
what's his name?

3280
01:36:34,651 --> 01:36:35,580
I was able to,

3281
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:36,390
God,

3282
01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:37,223
no,

3283
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:38,560
I was able to interview uh,

3284
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:39,010
this,

3285
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:44,010
this really interesting guy who has a phd
in molecular genetics and then move to

3286
01:36:44,521 --> 01:36:46,440
the Himalayas to become a Buddhist monk.

3287
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:47,250
Um,

3288
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:50,400
his name is Matthieu Ricard and he's,

3289
01:36:50,490 --> 01:36:55,490
he's a French Buddhist monk and he talks
about mindfulness meditation and he

3290
01:36:55,981 --> 01:36:59,700
talks about the neuroscience of the
things that the Tibetans are doing right

3291
01:36:59,701 --> 01:37:00,534
now,

3292
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,760
but he's not trying to
make money off of it.

3293
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:06,630
And I think that is a fundamental
kind of red flag for me.

3294
01:37:06,631 --> 01:37:08,790
I'm not saying just because
somebody is trying to make money,

3295
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:10,590
they are selling snake oil.

3296
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:11,430
Right?

3297
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:11,971
First of all,

3298
01:37:11,971 --> 01:37:13,880
what's the motivation that,

3299
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:15,870
that that has to be the first red flag.

3300
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:16,770
And then you go into,

3301
01:37:16,771 --> 01:37:19,320
what is it that they're
saying if they're talking,

3302
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:24,560
if they're trying to use science and
they're trying to kind of go in and pick

3303
01:37:25,261 --> 01:37:28,260
and choose the science that tells the
story the right way and then they're

3304
01:37:28,261 --> 01:37:31,920
making these really broad
a leaps from that science.

3305
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:33,570
It makes me nervous.

3306
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:34,321
So it's,

3307
01:37:34,321 --> 01:37:36,780
it's one thing if you've got like a
motivational speaker who's just like,

3308
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:40,380
I know this about the world and
I'm not basing it on anything,

3309
01:37:40,381 --> 01:37:41,270
but if you like me,

3310
01:37:41,290 --> 01:37:42,001
come follow me.

3311
01:37:42,001 --> 01:37:42,301
And it's like,

3312
01:37:42,301 --> 01:37:42,481
yeah,

3313
01:37:42,481 --> 01:37:43,081
that's fine.

3314
01:37:43,081 --> 01:37:43,351
I mean,

3315
01:37:43,351 --> 01:37:43,801
what is that?

3316
01:37:43,801 --> 01:37:44,910
That's like culty behavior,

3317
01:37:44,911 --> 01:37:45,744
but that's fine.

3318
01:37:45,930 --> 01:37:49,800
But when people pick and choose how they
want to use science and how they want

3319
01:37:49,801 --> 01:37:52,380
to bastardize science to meet their needs,

3320
01:37:52,381 --> 01:37:53,400
it makes me nervous.

3321
01:37:53,401 --> 01:37:55,920
I did a piece recently
about the power of thinking.

3322
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:56,491
Um,

3323
01:37:56,491 --> 01:37:59,430
I've also done a piece about the
power of prayer and I went through the

3324
01:37:59,431 --> 01:38:03,750
literature and I tried to find examples
where positive thinking actually helped

3325
01:38:03,751 --> 01:38:04,530
people.

3326
01:38:04,530 --> 01:38:08,670
And there's just no good evidence that
thinking positively is going to actually

3327
01:38:08,671 --> 01:38:10,230
bring goodwill to your life.

3328
01:38:10,231 --> 01:38:10,560
Like,

3329
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,550
like the secret,

3330
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:12,151
you know this like,

3331
01:38:12,151 --> 01:38:13,500
well if I just want it bad enough,

3332
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:14,580
I'm going to make a bunch of money.

3333
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:15,240
It's like,

3334
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:15,781
no,

3335
01:38:15,781 --> 01:38:16,620
if you want it bad enough,

3336
01:38:16,621 --> 01:38:18,090
you're going to have
to fucking work for it.

3337
01:38:18,091 --> 01:38:19,020
And then it's gonna come to you.

3338
01:38:19,021 --> 01:38:22,740
And actually they find that the power of
positive thinking can actually be kind

3339
01:38:22,741 --> 01:38:27,741
of detrimental to cancer patients because
it causes a whole extra layer of guilt

3340
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:32,970
to the process of dying,

3341
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:33,620
you know,

3342
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:34,740
caused us to yourself.

3343
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:35,190
Exactly.

3344
01:38:35,190 --> 01:38:36,060
Because you didn't,

3345
01:38:36,270 --> 01:38:37,890
you didn't think positively enough,

3346
01:38:37,891 --> 01:38:39,390
you didn't will yourself out of this.

3347
01:38:39,391 --> 01:38:43,320
And there's a whole culture around that
in America where we kind of blame the

3348
01:38:43,321 --> 01:38:46,020
victims and where we
call cancer survivors,

3349
01:38:46,021 --> 01:38:46,831
survivors,

3350
01:38:46,831 --> 01:38:49,140
and we call cancer victims victims,

3351
01:38:49,141 --> 01:38:49,441
you know,

3352
01:38:49,441 --> 01:38:49,591
and,

3353
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:50,190
and it's like,

3354
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:52,830
and you're not doing so well.

3355
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:55,410
Nobody says it directly to
somebody who was dying of cancer.

3356
01:38:55,411 --> 01:38:56,790
Well you didn't will yourself out of it,

3357
01:38:56,970 --> 01:39:00,030
but they feel that because they say it
indirectly to the people who are coming

3358
01:39:00,031 --> 01:39:00,420
out of it.

3359
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:00,661
Oh,

3360
01:39:00,661 --> 01:39:04,170
it was all that nice prayer and all those
positive thoughts and all those Oprah

3361
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:05,220
magazines you read.

3362
01:39:05,221 --> 01:39:05,551
You know,

3363
01:39:05,551 --> 01:39:06,000
and it's like,

3364
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:06,690
ah,

3365
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:07,231
I don't know.

3366
01:39:07,231 --> 01:39:09,060
I think that's a bad precedent to set.

3367
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:12,410
It's also shitty science
because if you're,

3368
01:39:12,411 --> 01:39:12,621
you know,

3369
01:39:12,621 --> 01:39:15,170
you're only looking at the
group that was successful.

3370
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,060
Exactly.

3371
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:17,340
What about all the people that died?

3372
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:18,533
And that's the thing.

3373
01:39:18,610 --> 01:39:21,700
I tried to look at a lot of those
studies and I tried to compare,

3374
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:22,271
you know,

3375
01:39:22,271 --> 01:39:22,391
and,

3376
01:39:22,391 --> 01:39:25,780
and I found enough stuff out there that
kind of shows that the power of positive

3377
01:39:25,781 --> 01:39:27,070
thinking is not a real thing.

3378
01:39:27,071 --> 01:39:27,381
Also,

3379
01:39:27,381 --> 01:39:29,020
that shows that prayer
is not a real thing.

3380
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:29,721
Disagree.

3381
01:39:29,721 --> 01:39:31,700
That the power of positive
thinking is not a real thing.

3382
01:39:31,730 --> 01:39:36,140
I think it's a good way to operate and
live your life in a happy manner and will

3383
01:39:36,141 --> 01:39:39,110
probably lend you to
being more successful.

3384
01:39:39,111 --> 01:39:40,280
You'll have less hurdles.

3385
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:40,931
It's like,

3386
01:39:40,931 --> 01:39:42,340
it's like talking about Karma,

3387
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:42,701
you know,

3388
01:39:42,701 --> 01:39:46,930
like in some sense Karma is totally real
because if you're a fucking nice person

3389
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:47,771
and you're just,

3390
01:39:47,771 --> 01:39:47,941
you,

3391
01:39:47,941 --> 01:39:49,420
you do goodwill all of the time,

3392
01:39:49,421 --> 01:39:51,280
sometimes shitty things
are going to happen to you.

3393
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:53,560
But most people are going
to be nice to you too.

3394
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:55,240
If you put bad Karma out there.

3395
01:39:55,241 --> 01:39:58,360
To me what that really means is if you're
just a fucking asshole all the time,

3396
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:00,460
people are going to be
an asshole back to you.

3397
01:40:00,670 --> 01:40:01,600
Like that's obvious.

3398
01:40:01,601 --> 01:40:05,950
But I don't believe that Karma is some
sort of cosmic force that says you,

3399
01:40:05,951 --> 01:40:09,940
you store up goodwill with the universe
and the universe pays you back in some

3400
01:40:09,941 --> 01:40:10,510
way

3401
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:13,430
field that it is because that's
how it applies to a socially.

3402
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:13,850
Yes.

3403
01:40:13,850 --> 01:40:15,670
So we sort of like the,

3404
01:40:15,770 --> 01:40:18,800
I've always felt that the idea of the
birth and the death of the universe was a

3405
01:40:18,801 --> 01:40:23,210
weird concept and that maybe were wrapped
around that because of the idea of our

3406
01:40:23,211 --> 01:40:25,190
own biological limitations.

3407
01:40:25,191 --> 01:40:25,761
I've always thought,

3408
01:40:25,761 --> 01:40:26,180
yeah,

3409
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:28,700
like time is so interesting
because time is,

3410
01:40:28,701 --> 01:40:29,660
is is a real thing.

3411
01:40:29,661 --> 01:40:30,490
Flexible though.

3412
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:31,251
It's flexible.

3413
01:40:31,251 --> 01:40:31,670
Yes.

3414
01:40:31,670 --> 01:40:32,960
But it is also a real thing,

3415
01:40:32,961 --> 01:40:36,710
but we perceive it to be something that's
in some ways quite different than what

3416
01:40:36,711 --> 01:40:37,461
time actually.

3417
01:40:37,461 --> 01:40:37,590
Yeah.

3418
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:41,460
Well when you start getting into crazy
shit like a spaceship that goes faster

3419
01:40:41,461 --> 01:40:45,210
than the speed of light and then it
comes back to Earth in 20 years and 500

3420
01:40:45,211 --> 01:40:46,410
years have passed or whatever the fuck.

3421
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:47,140
Yeah.

3422
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:48,790
Or it would be earlier,

3423
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:48,820
earlier,

3424
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:50,230
come back earlier than when you left.

3425
01:40:50,231 --> 01:40:51,100
If it's faster than this.

3426
01:40:51,101 --> 01:40:51,791
So you'd have to,

3427
01:40:51,791 --> 01:40:52,280
yeah,

3428
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:54,480
you have to go really much
faster that you do that.

3429
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:55,503
You could see

3430
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:57,800
they say that if you are many,

3431
01:40:57,860 --> 01:41:02,860
like if you're a million light years away
from earth and you could look back and

3432
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,010
yeah,

3433
01:41:05,010 --> 01:41:05,440
yeah.

3434
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:08,950
Like if you left on a spaceship and you
were going faster to the speed of light

3435
01:41:08,951 --> 01:41:09,910
and you got a crazy ass,

3436
01:41:09,911 --> 01:41:10,230
tell us,

3437
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:13,300
go on Mars and then you turned
your telescope towards earth,

3438
01:41:13,301 --> 01:41:14,440
you would see yourself landing.

3439
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:16,060
What the fuck?

3440
01:41:16,061 --> 01:41:18,970
That's why Einstein says you can't
go faster than the speed of light.

3441
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,730
What if you can you
just fuck everything up?

3442
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:21,941
Well,

3443
01:41:21,941 --> 01:41:22,774
that's what everybody,

3444
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:23,381
I mean that's,

3445
01:41:23,381 --> 01:41:25,690
that's the fascinating
thing about thinking about.

3446
01:41:25,970 --> 01:41:27,170
Do you ever wonder,

3447
01:41:27,171 --> 01:41:30,230
like when you see things
like Fukushima and you see,

3448
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:30,711
you know,

3449
01:41:30,711 --> 01:41:31,930
nuclear disasters and the,

3450
01:41:31,950 --> 01:41:33,770
all the potential nuclear disasters,

3451
01:41:33,771 --> 01:41:36,250
a different places that we
have all over the [inaudible],

3452
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:39,800
just California that are on
fault lines or near fault lines.

3453
01:41:39,950 --> 01:41:40,431
Does that,

3454
01:41:40,431 --> 01:41:41,420
does that freak you out?

3455
01:41:41,421 --> 01:41:44,930
Do you wonder about like the
idea behind nuclear power?

3456
01:41:44,931 --> 01:41:45,141
I mean,

3457
01:41:45,141 --> 01:41:45,411
sure,

3458
01:41:45,411 --> 01:41:47,530
it's been very beneficial to societies,

3459
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:50,630
but if you have to look
at whatever it's been,

3460
01:41:50,631 --> 01:41:55,130
how many 60 years of implementation and
there's three parts of the world that

3461
01:41:55,131 --> 01:41:56,120
are broken now.

3462
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:57,060
Yeah.

3463
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:57,511
You know,

3464
01:41:57,511 --> 01:42:00,050
you know what's funny is I think
that there's this huge disconnect in,

3465
01:42:00,051 --> 01:42:00,421
in,

3466
01:42:00,421 --> 01:42:02,940
in public opinion between,

3467
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:03,691
again,

3468
01:42:03,691 --> 01:42:05,910
science and implementation.

3469
01:42:06,150 --> 01:42:07,650
And I always,

3470
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:08,401
I shouldn't say always,

3471
01:42:08,401 --> 01:42:11,460
but I'm often an advocate of doing
science for the sake of science.

3472
01:42:11,461 --> 01:42:14,340
I'm often an advocate of just
trying to learn as much as we can.

3473
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:19,580
I think that once these
things get implemented as
technologies and as sources of

3474
01:42:19,681 --> 01:42:20,280
engineering,

3475
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:25,280
that's why we have a government and
government is supposed to be better at

3476
01:42:25,830 --> 01:42:30,570
making sure that all of these
things are checked and balanced,

3477
01:42:30,571 --> 01:42:30,931
you know,

3478
01:42:30,931 --> 01:42:33,090
and that we should have
good protocols when,

3479
01:42:33,091 --> 01:42:33,924
when the,

3480
01:42:34,350 --> 01:42:38,850
when the earthquake struck in Italy and
all of those seismologists who basically

3481
01:42:38,851 --> 01:42:39,121
said,

3482
01:42:39,121 --> 01:42:41,100
I'm not sure that this is going to happen,

3483
01:42:41,101 --> 01:42:42,390
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

3484
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,040
And then so many people died.

3485
01:42:44,490 --> 01:42:45,323
Um,

3486
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:46,800
everybody blamed the scientists,

3487
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:47,980
the charged with manslaughter,

3488
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,140
they charge him with manslaughter,

3489
01:42:49,141 --> 01:42:49,974
they blamed the scientist.

3490
01:42:50,190 --> 01:42:52,440
Nobody blamed any of the civil engineers,

3491
01:42:52,441 --> 01:42:56,310
any of the people overseeing whether
or not the buildings were up to code,

3492
01:42:56,520 --> 01:43:00,540
whether or not the city was built in
such a way that it could withstand an

3493
01:43:00,541 --> 01:43:01,374
earthquake.

3494
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:01,970
And it's,

3495
01:43:01,970 --> 01:43:06,930
it's absolutely insane to me that the
people who were tasked with just trying to

3496
01:43:06,931 --> 01:43:08,310
understand whether or not,

3497
01:43:08,311 --> 01:43:10,650
and we can't predict
earthquakes by the way we can,

3498
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:14,090
and you're talking about Italy and that's
where the Vatican is and that's the

3499
01:43:14,091 --> 01:43:16,610
biggest center of nonsense in
the known universe for damn sure.

3500
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:18,590
It's the craziest fucking setup ever.

3501
01:43:18,591 --> 01:43:22,370
And that's an Italy kind of fuckery
they deal with on a regular basis.

3502
01:43:22,410 --> 01:43:22,950
Yeah.

3503
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:23,671
But we see this,

3504
01:43:23,671 --> 01:43:24,301
I mean that's the thing.

3505
01:43:24,301 --> 01:43:26,310
We don't have a global government.

3506
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:26,640
You know,

3507
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:28,110
we have a chai,

3508
01:43:28,190 --> 01:43:31,760
maybe the church wanted them to get
charged with manslaughter so they can move

3509
01:43:31,761 --> 01:43:32,930
into a stronger position.

3510
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:33,680
Maybe they,

3511
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:35,360
maybe they tried to like push that.

3512
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:36,640
I just think people scapegoat.

3513
01:43:36,770 --> 01:43:37,940
People want somebody to blame,

3514
01:43:38,150 --> 01:43:38,900
you know what I mean?

3515
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:41,960
And the pencil pushers with their
glasses sitting behind their desk.

3516
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:45,470
We're an easy target and it's really
fucking sad because it sets a terrible

3517
01:43:45,471 --> 01:43:48,920
precedent and it makes it
so that seismologist the
world over are going to be

3518
01:43:48,921 --> 01:43:49,754
nervous to,

3519
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,930
to have any sort of report.

3520
01:43:50,931 --> 01:43:52,080
If a government official comes

3521
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:52,650
and says,

3522
01:43:52,650 --> 01:43:53,640
look at all of this data,

3523
01:43:53,641 --> 01:43:56,190
do you think that there's a risk that
something like this could happen to us

3524
01:43:56,191 --> 01:43:56,610
soon?

3525
01:43:56,610 --> 01:43:57,061
They're going to go,

3526
01:43:57,061 --> 01:43:58,410
I don't want to fucking say anything.

3527
01:43:58,590 --> 01:44:00,000
I'm just gonna keep my mouth
shut because I don't want to get

3528
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:00,670
trouble.

3529
01:44:00,670 --> 01:44:00,941
Well,

3530
01:44:00,941 --> 01:44:01,810
not only that,

3531
01:44:01,811 --> 01:44:02,644
but how,

3532
01:44:02,770 --> 01:44:03,970
how could they,

3533
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,250
the people that are in
charge of the legal system,

3534
01:44:06,251 --> 01:44:11,251
how could they prosecute him when everyone
knows that it's impossible to predict

3535
01:44:11,681 --> 01:44:12,514
earthquakes?

3536
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:15,140
Fucking no butts.

3537
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:19,600
How could someone make that decision
if there's no evidence they did?

3538
01:44:20,410 --> 01:44:21,130
That's so crazy.

3539
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:21,311
I mean,

3540
01:44:21,311 --> 01:44:24,880
hopefully they overturn it
because people like what the fuck?

3541
01:44:24,881 --> 01:44:26,350
Like they wanted this to happen.

3542
01:44:27,370 --> 01:44:28,570
They caused the earthquake.

3543
01:44:28,571 --> 01:44:29,710
Like what the fuck are you saying?

3544
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:30,950
It doesn't make it.

3545
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:31,870
It makes no sense.

3546
01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:34,450
Absolutely no sense.

3547
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:35,590
But at least that's Italy.

3548
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:36,940
We can get our stupid fucks.

3549
01:44:36,941 --> 01:44:41,110
That's where my grandparents
fled the Italians,

3550
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:44,830
a little bit of Irish and
they fled to half Italian,

3551
01:44:44,831 --> 01:44:45,664
half Puerto Rican.

3552
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:50,860
Do you know if I recombination
for a neuroscientist,

3553
01:44:50,861 --> 01:44:51,694
young lady

3554
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,550
by a space ship?

3555
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:55,690
I mean it's,

3556
01:44:55,690 --> 01:44:57,910
I don't know as much about it exactly,

3557
01:44:57,911 --> 01:44:58,900
but I was going to say there's this,

3558
01:44:58,930 --> 01:44:59,441
there's this,

3559
01:44:59,441 --> 01:45:03,040
I'm kind of meme that's going
around on Facebook right now,

3560
01:45:03,041 --> 01:45:08,041
and I shared it on my page and it just
says this week in science 12 to 2012 and

3561
01:45:09,431 --> 01:45:13,030
it's like Nasa Messenger spacecraft
discovered evidence of ice and organic

3562
01:45:13,031 --> 01:45:14,050
compounds on mercury.

3563
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:16,330
DNA was photographed for the first time.

3564
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:19,810
A quasar was observed that puts out a
hundred times more energy than our entire

3565
01:45:19,811 --> 01:45:20,644
galaxy.

3566
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:26,560
I know a black hole with a massive 17
or 17 billion suns was observed and

3567
01:45:26,561 --> 01:45:29,680
another of Saturn's moons was found
to have a pac man like heat signature.

3568
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:34,240
And that's not to mention the
findings of the curiosity rover.

3569
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:35,230
So I mean,

3570
01:45:35,230 --> 01:45:36,730
this is this just this week,

3571
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:37,541
just this week.

3572
01:45:37,541 --> 01:45:39,480
This is why my job is so fucking cool.

3573
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:40,150
That's pretty cool.

3574
01:45:40,150 --> 01:45:40,390
Yeah.

3575
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:42,220
This is the best time ever to have it too.

3576
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:42,880
I feel like,

3577
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:44,020
I feel like that's the case too.

3578
01:45:44,021 --> 01:45:44,800
I mean there's,

3579
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:48,820
we've never been in an
intellectual climate that's
so detrimental to scientific

3580
01:45:48,821 --> 01:45:49,151
thinking,

3581
01:45:49,151 --> 01:45:53,950
but we've also never been
in a technological climate
that's so permissive of

3582
01:45:53,951 --> 01:45:55,270
scientific progress.

3583
01:45:55,630 --> 01:45:55,930
Great.

3584
01:45:55,930 --> 01:45:57,850
I think there's always
going to be loud people,

3585
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:59,680
but I think generally across the board,

3586
01:45:59,681 --> 01:46:04,600
people are much more open
minded to science and
understanding of the reality of

3587
01:46:04,601 --> 01:46:06,370
the universe than they
ever have been before.

3588
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:07,370
Then they have,

3589
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:08,390
I guess I should say within,

3590
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:10,160
I feel like within this century,

3591
01:46:10,161 --> 01:46:11,120
within the last century,

3592
01:46:11,121 --> 01:46:13,520
I should say we're in a very anti science

3593
01:46:13,570 --> 01:46:15,490
figured out in the Reagan
administration era.

3594
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,920
They figured out how to
make it a lot of noise.

3595
01:46:18,390 --> 01:46:21,310
One of the good ways to do it is like
you can get elected if you get the

3596
01:46:21,311 --> 01:46:21,610
Christian,

3597
01:46:21,610 --> 01:46:22,720
it's on your side and,

3598
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,020
and that's just gained momentum and
that's really sad because I would love to

3599
01:46:26,021 --> 01:46:29,770
see us go back to the 60
I mean in a sense to the,

3600
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:33,940
to the way that science was perceived
in the 60s to the excitement about NASA,

3601
01:46:33,941 --> 01:46:36,140
to the excitement about the space race.

3602
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:37,231
It's science.

3603
01:46:37,231 --> 01:46:37,471
Look,

3604
01:46:37,471 --> 01:46:37,711
if,

3605
01:46:37,711 --> 01:46:39,870
if we are the universe
trying to understand itself,

3606
01:46:39,871 --> 01:46:42,410
science truly is the
religion because that,

3607
01:46:42,411 --> 01:46:46,470
that's the religion of trying
to understand everything
truthfully and cutting

3608
01:46:46,471 --> 01:46:47,400
out all the fuckery,

3609
01:46:47,610 --> 01:46:48,960
cutting out all the nonsense.

3610
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:50,040
The problem is that

3611
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,510
the word religion,

3612
01:46:51,511 --> 01:46:52,710
just like the word God,

3613
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:54,300
I feel like have a connotation.

3614
01:46:54,301 --> 01:46:54,421
Yeah.

3615
01:46:54,421 --> 01:46:54,961
They're tainted.

3616
01:46:54,961 --> 01:46:55,680
Just like,

3617
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,030
just like the swastika,

3618
01:46:57,070 --> 01:46:57,361
you know,

3619
01:46:57,361 --> 01:46:58,081
it's tainted.

3620
01:46:58,081 --> 01:46:59,810
And so when you go back to kindle it will,

3621
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:00,420
it was like,

3622
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:02,040
it's like the oldest symbol on earth,

3623
01:47:02,050 --> 01:47:02,281
you know?

3624
01:47:02,281 --> 01:47:05,490
And if you go to like these
different old parts of Asia,

3625
01:47:05,491 --> 01:47:06,480
it's everywhere.

3626
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:07,680
But now it's tainted.

3627
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:07,991
Yeah.

3628
01:47:07,991 --> 01:47:08,850
There's a place near,

3629
01:47:08,851 --> 01:47:09,570
um,

3630
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:10,410
I think it's in,

3631
01:47:10,411 --> 01:47:11,244
um,

3632
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:15,090
somewhere in the valley and it's this
really ancient house that was built by

3633
01:47:15,091 --> 01:47:17,850
these people from India and
the swastikas all over there.

3634
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:18,311
Yeah.

3635
01:47:18,311 --> 01:47:19,240
So they have to explain,

3636
01:47:19,241 --> 01:47:21,490
it's like a plaque
explaining the swastika.

3637
01:47:21,491 --> 01:47:21,850
Exactly.

3638
01:47:21,850 --> 01:47:22,810
But that's what happens.

3639
01:47:22,811 --> 01:47:23,111
You know,

3640
01:47:23,111 --> 01:47:23,321
you,

3641
01:47:23,321 --> 01:47:25,090
you link it with something
fucking horrible.

3642
01:47:25,091 --> 01:47:26,170
Like religion,

3643
01:47:26,171 --> 01:47:26,951
in my view,

3644
01:47:26,951 --> 01:47:29,380
has been so fucking horrible for so long.

3645
01:47:29,650 --> 01:47:34,650
It's tainted and the idea
of God immediately draws
up in a Christian ideal of

3646
01:47:35,981 --> 01:47:40,810
like a white bearded guy living in like
on a cloud or some shit that's going to

3647
01:47:40,811 --> 01:47:41,561
cast judgment on you.

3648
01:47:41,561 --> 01:47:42,394
So when people talk about,

3649
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:42,821
yeah,

3650
01:47:42,821 --> 01:47:43,930
but I see God more as,

3651
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:47,680
I'm like call it fucking
something different because
it confuses me every time

3652
01:47:47,681 --> 01:47:49,220
you use the word God maybe.

3653
01:47:51,050 --> 01:47:51,310
Yeah.

3654
01:47:51,310 --> 01:47:51,611
Maybe.

3655
01:47:51,611 --> 01:47:51,971
Or how,

3656
01:47:51,971 --> 01:47:53,080
what we just don't use the word God.

3657
01:47:53,470 --> 01:47:55,710
We just talk about
science as being mobile.

3658
01:47:55,850 --> 01:47:56,040
Yeah.

3659
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:57,440
Call it [inaudible] figure out.

3660
01:47:58,390 --> 01:48:00,190
But science is just incredible.

3661
01:48:00,191 --> 01:48:00,971
It's incredible.

3662
01:48:00,971 --> 01:48:05,971
And it's all inspiring and learning about
our own existence is why we are so you

3663
01:48:06,761 --> 01:48:07,550
feel like conscious,

3664
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:12,550
this is really just a byproduct of all
these different synapses firing and all

3665
01:48:12,841 --> 01:48:13,850
of these different cells.

3666
01:48:13,851 --> 01:48:17,690
Charging and igniting and filling with
thought and intention and instincts and

3667
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:18,673
jeans.

3668
01:48:18,830 --> 01:48:19,221
I do.

3669
01:48:19,221 --> 01:48:21,610
I don't know if I feel like
the word byproduct maybe.

3670
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:22,613
Awesome.

3671
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:25,970
I should of said product of or

3672
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:26,910
you know,

3673
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:27,743
the uh,

3674
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:29,660
the end result of the,

3675
01:48:29,661 --> 01:48:32,760
the moving force behind
the biological unit.

3676
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:33,181
Yes.

3677
01:48:33,181 --> 01:48:35,730
I think that mind and brain
are two sides of the same coin.

3678
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:39,010
Mind thought consciousness arises as a,

3679
01:48:39,011 --> 01:48:42,720
as a physical Manistee
manifestation of brain activity.

3680
01:48:43,530 --> 01:48:46,860
So the brain does what it does
and through it we have thought.

3681
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:48,790
So you think that the,

3682
01:48:48,791 --> 01:48:53,791
the concept of the soul and the idea
that there's some conscious being trapped

3683
01:48:53,981 --> 01:48:54,740
in your,

3684
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:55,140
your,

3685
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:56,290
your meat vehicle?

3686
01:48:56,340 --> 01:48:56,521
Yeah.

3687
01:48:56,521 --> 01:48:56,961
I don't believe it.

3688
01:48:56,961 --> 01:48:57,640
Don't believe in that.

3689
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:58,530
Believe in the ghost in the shell.

3690
01:48:58,531 --> 01:48:59,910
I don't think anything
persist once we die.

3691
01:48:59,911 --> 01:49:00,630
For example,

3692
01:49:00,630 --> 01:49:01,011
when we died,

3693
01:49:01,011 --> 01:49:01,730
we were off.

3694
01:49:01,730 --> 01:49:02,300
That's it.

3695
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:02,990
That's a wrap.

3696
01:49:02,990 --> 01:49:03,740
That's a wrap.

3697
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:04,100
Yeah.

3698
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:06,080
Do you think there's a
universal consciousness?

3699
01:49:06,110 --> 01:49:06,620
No.

3700
01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:07,160
No.

3701
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:08,070
Just a universal,

3702
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:08,750
I mean

3703
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:09,920
I think there are laws,

3704
01:49:10,010 --> 01:49:14,150
there are fundamental laws of
nature that cannot be broken,

3705
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:17,270
but I don't think that
they have meaning in them.

3706
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:18,620
I think they just are.

3707
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:20,640
You don't think that
there's some sort of a,

3708
01:49:20,641 --> 01:49:21,411
a pattern,

3709
01:49:21,411 --> 01:49:23,240
a very clear pattern of,

3710
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:23,551
uh,

3711
01:49:23,551 --> 01:49:25,700
a constant that like,

3712
01:49:25,701 --> 01:49:28,160
if you look at like from
the big bang to now,

3713
01:49:28,161 --> 01:49:29,840
especially if you look
at just our culture,

3714
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:33,650
the constant innovation and
progress and moving forward.

3715
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:34,190
The,

3716
01:49:34,190 --> 01:49:38,530
just from looking at planets that go from
single celled organisms like you know,

3717
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:39,420
we did and to,

3718
01:49:39,421 --> 01:49:42,380
to what we have now with the Internet
and having this kind of the ability to

3719
01:49:42,381 --> 01:49:44,320
broadcast something
like this on a podcast,

3720
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:46,800
the isn't that the,

3721
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:50,430
that there's some sort
of a pattern that it's,

3722
01:49:50,431 --> 01:49:54,110
it's moving in a very specific direction
and unless there's some horrible

3723
01:49:54,111 --> 01:49:55,910
disaster that stops this course,

3724
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:59,180
we're going to continue to move
in a more and more advanced.

3725
01:49:59,650 --> 01:50:00,610
I definitely think that there,

3726
01:50:00,611 --> 01:50:02,670
we're seeing exponential growth in,

3727
01:50:02,671 --> 01:50:03,940
in technological advances,

3728
01:50:04,150 --> 01:50:07,370
but I don't think that that means
that there's somebody driving that,

3729
01:50:07,371 --> 01:50:07,810
right?

3730
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:07,960
No,

3731
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:08,081
no.

3732
01:50:08,081 --> 01:50:09,220
Not that someone's driving it,

3733
01:50:09,221 --> 01:50:10,820
but there is absolutely a,

3734
01:50:10,821 --> 01:50:13,180
a pattern and it almost
seems insurmountable.

3735
01:50:13,181 --> 01:50:16,080
It's like it's not going
to stop the idea of it.

3736
01:50:16,090 --> 01:50:19,520
The only thing that's
going to stop technological
innovation and progress is you

3737
01:50:19,521 --> 01:50:20,560
got to shut all the power off.

3738
01:50:20,660 --> 01:50:21,110
Yeah.

3739
01:50:21,110 --> 01:50:21,680
Forever.

3740
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:21,921
Yeah.

3741
01:50:21,921 --> 01:50:22,161
I mean,

3742
01:50:22,161 --> 01:50:23,390
I personally think that,

3743
01:50:23,391 --> 01:50:23,601
you know,

3744
01:50:23,601 --> 01:50:27,710
people talk about the kind of Kurzweilian
singularity and when man and machine

3745
01:50:27,711 --> 01:50:31,640
combine and then we can live forever
because we can download our consciousness

3746
01:50:31,641 --> 01:50:31,971
or whatever.

3747
01:50:31,971 --> 01:50:35,690
I personally don't think that Ray Kurzweil
has the best grasp of how the brain

3748
01:50:35,691 --> 01:50:35,990
works,

3749
01:50:35,990 --> 01:50:37,040
how the human brain works.

3750
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:41,990
And so I'm not sure that I really
buy into what he's selling,

3751
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:46,910
but eventually if we got to a point where
AI was kind of sophisticated enough,

3752
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:49,340
I think that I worry,

3753
01:50:49,370 --> 01:50:49,641
you know,

3754
01:50:49,641 --> 01:50:52,160
when we talk about what is
going to be the end for humans,

3755
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:54,440
I personally think that we're
going to fuck ourselves.

3756
01:50:54,441 --> 01:50:55,680
That we're just too much of a war.

3757
01:50:55,681 --> 01:50:57,560
Like you know,

3758
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:59,800
but we're not because you
hold short term intruders.

3759
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,673
I won't,

3760
01:51:00,890 --> 01:51:03,500
but I don't have babies so I'm
not passing these genes on.

3761
01:51:03,501 --> 01:51:04,670
At least not yet.

3762
01:51:04,671 --> 01:51:05,640
You go pass him jeans,

3763
01:51:07,050 --> 01:51:07,940
go do some breeding.

3764
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:10,043
Um,

3765
01:51:10,050 --> 01:51:10,710
yeah,

3766
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:11,650
that's the,

3767
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:15,360
the question of whether or not we're
going to fuck it up is certainly a valid

3768
01:51:15,361 --> 01:51:15,630
one.

3769
01:51:15,630 --> 01:51:15,930
You know,

3770
01:51:15,930 --> 01:51:16,220
we,

3771
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:17,460
a lot of us have bombs.

3772
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:19,500
We've done a lot of nuclear explosions.

3773
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:20,090
Yes.

3774
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:21,410
Well we may have colonize something.

3775
01:51:21,411 --> 01:51:21,621
I mean,

3776
01:51:21,621 --> 01:51:21,951
I just,

3777
01:51:21,951 --> 01:51:24,800
I just did a chat yesterday
with two guys from Mars.

3778
01:51:24,801 --> 01:51:25,071
One,

3779
01:51:25,071 --> 01:51:30,071
which is this Dutch company that plans
to colonize Mars in 2023 and that's an 11

3780
01:51:31,761 --> 01:51:32,740
years it should have happened.

3781
01:51:32,770 --> 01:51:33,060
Right.

3782
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:33,591
That's great.

3783
01:51:33,591 --> 01:51:36,840
Can I get some money and then
they're going to go all John McAfee?

3784
01:51:36,990 --> 01:51:37,201
Well,

3785
01:51:37,201 --> 01:51:37,500
they,

3786
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:38,333
what was that Brian?

3787
01:51:38,730 --> 01:51:40,470
I know there's crazy
people out in the back.

3788
01:51:41,010 --> 01:51:41,670
Wow.

3789
01:51:41,670 --> 01:51:43,320
Is that that if someone opened the back,

3790
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:45,390
we should hadn't been
mentioned the simulation.

3791
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:48,600
I know they're coming to shut us down.

3792
01:51:49,230 --> 01:51:49,770
Um,

3793
01:51:49,770 --> 01:51:49,981
no.

3794
01:51:49,981 --> 01:51:51,130
I think that they really want to do it.

3795
01:51:51,131 --> 01:51:55,080
It's a nonprofit organization and you
know what their plan is to get funding.

3796
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:58,580
They want to make this mission
of the first colonists to Mars.

3797
01:51:58,770 --> 01:51:59,850
I don't know if there'll be successful,

3798
01:51:59,851 --> 01:52:01,410
but I do think that they're
going to try to do it.

3799
01:52:01,411 --> 01:52:03,120
Definitely kill a few people in space.

3800
01:52:03,150 --> 01:52:08,150
They plan on the plan on making
this the most insane reality.

3801
01:52:09,350 --> 01:52:10,670
Oh Jesus.

3802
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:12,410
That's where I just checked out.

3803
01:52:12,411 --> 01:52:13,490
If they were real scientists,

3804
01:52:13,491 --> 01:52:14,241
would they do that?

3805
01:52:14,241 --> 01:52:15,440
Would they turn into a reality?

3806
01:52:15,441 --> 01:52:16,790
The only way they can get money for it.

3807
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:17,360
Wow.

3808
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:18,920
I'm on board on the booboo.

3809
01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:21,863
And I asked them,

3810
01:52:22,150 --> 01:52:22,631
I was like,

3811
01:52:22,631 --> 01:52:24,460
what are you going to do
if something goes horribly,

3812
01:52:24,461 --> 01:52:25,061
horribly wrong?

3813
01:52:25,061 --> 01:52:27,040
This is an extremely risky endeavor.

3814
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:27,430
Right.

3815
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:27,611
You know,

3816
01:52:27,611 --> 01:52:28,840
and they were saying at this point,

3817
01:52:28,841 --> 01:52:30,820
we'll have been training
these people for 10 years.

3818
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:32,110
They're going to be our friends.

3819
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:34,360
These people that we're
sending up to colonize Mars,

3820
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:35,470
they can't bring them back.

3821
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:36,333
By the way,

3822
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,410
these people are going to go to Mars
and they're going to live out their days

3823
01:52:38,411 --> 01:52:38,590
off.

3824
01:52:38,590 --> 01:52:39,940
Oh yeah.

3825
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:40,793
And

3826
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:43,510
what happens when something
goes horribly wrong?

3827
01:52:43,511 --> 01:52:43,901
And they're like,

3828
01:52:43,901 --> 01:52:44,890
that's when we have to shut off the,

3829
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:45,980
because

3830
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:46,813
you can't,

3831
01:52:46,870 --> 01:52:47,321
you can't.

3832
01:52:47,321 --> 01:52:48,910
Televise a friend of yours

3833
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:52,140
dying on that.

3834
01:52:52,170 --> 01:52:53,950
Alaska shows the,

3835
01:52:53,951 --> 01:52:54,191
uh,

3836
01:52:54,191 --> 01:52:55,300
one of the guys died.

3837
01:52:55,330 --> 01:52:55,511
I mean,

3838
01:52:55,511 --> 01:52:57,160
they didn't actually show him dying,

3839
01:52:57,161 --> 01:52:57,911
but I mean,

3840
01:52:57,911 --> 01:52:59,650
he died while they were filming the show.

3841
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:00,420
I mean,

3842
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:00,860
they,

3843
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:03,400
they have had deaths on
reality shows before.

3844
01:53:03,401 --> 01:53:05,890
All they'd have to do is
just figure out a way to,

3845
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:06,550
you know,

3846
01:53:06,550 --> 01:53:09,920
not to in the camera in and tell them
that there was some sort of a chemical x

3847
01:53:09,921 --> 01:53:14,320
fixation issue or whatever the fuck it
is that kills you when you're on a planet

3848
01:53:14,321 --> 01:53:15,154
that doesn't have air on.

3849
01:53:15,170 --> 01:53:17,150
If you even make it to the
planet and crazy bitch.

3850
01:53:17,151 --> 01:53:17,990
Like what the fuck?

3851
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:18,801
It's crazy.

3852
01:53:18,801 --> 01:53:22,610
And so their idea is that every 10
years they want to send for more people.

3853
01:53:22,611 --> 01:53:23,960
So it's like four people and four people,

3854
01:53:23,961 --> 01:53:27,050
four people and they're
going to have to be a doctor,

3855
01:53:27,051 --> 01:53:28,160
an engineer,

3856
01:53:28,161 --> 01:53:28,731
whatever.

3857
01:53:28,731 --> 01:53:31,640
Because they're going to have to be
able to grow the colony out there and

3858
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:33,230
eventually start terraforming.

3859
01:53:33,231 --> 01:53:37,640
I mean hopefully we'll get to a point
where we could blast something off of Mars

3860
01:53:37,641 --> 01:53:39,290
eventually to come back to earth.

3861
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:41,990
But until then they're going to
have to just make supply runs.

3862
01:53:41,991 --> 01:53:45,080
They're going to have to just send
things to Mars and we know it takes like,

3863
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:45,891
what,

3864
01:53:45,891 --> 01:53:47,140
nine months to get there.

3865
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:50,360
You got to wait nine months,

3866
01:53:50,361 --> 01:53:53,570
nine months and hope that it doesn't get,

3867
01:53:53,630 --> 01:53:54,110
you know,

3868
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:55,640
blow up on the way there.

3869
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:58,610
I mean it's absolutely insane.

3870
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:00,440
I can't really wrap my head around it.

3871
01:54:00,441 --> 01:54:01,520
I know they're going to try it.

3872
01:54:01,521 --> 01:54:02,750
I don't know if there'll be successful,

3873
01:54:02,751 --> 01:54:04,100
but the whole time I was doing this,

3874
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:06,440
this segment on huffpost live yesterday,

3875
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,120
I just kept stopping and being like,

3876
01:54:09,110 --> 01:54:11,750
fucking seriously talking
about this right now.

3877
01:54:11,751 --> 01:54:15,080
Like what a time to be
alive that you're having.

3878
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:15,590
I mean,

3879
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:17,570
I was having a serious
conversation with these.

3880
01:54:17,690 --> 01:54:20,450
So when you send these colonists to Mars,

3881
01:54:20,451 --> 01:54:21,920
what kind of tools will they need?

3882
01:54:21,921 --> 01:54:22,071
I mean,

3883
01:54:22,071 --> 01:54:24,470
it was absolutely blowing my mind,

3884
01:54:24,950 --> 01:54:27,530
planning on trying to
terraform that eventually,

3885
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:29,810
but they need to have a
lot of people their first,

3886
01:54:29,820 --> 01:54:32,520
so they get a lot of people there and
then they have some sort of a power source

3887
01:54:32,521 --> 01:54:33,354
and then they start,

3888
01:54:33,550 --> 01:54:35,800
I guess the or the Ema
and we've got the sun,

3889
01:54:35,860 --> 01:54:36,251
you know,

3890
01:54:36,251 --> 01:54:38,740
so they just come up
there with no atmosphere.

3891
01:54:38,741 --> 01:54:39,190
Right.

3892
01:54:39,190 --> 01:54:41,140
So it's super thin atmosphere.

3893
01:54:44,290 --> 01:54:45,850
They did find out that there is,

3894
01:54:45,870 --> 01:54:46,290
um,

3895
01:54:46,290 --> 01:54:46,510
it,

3896
01:54:46,510 --> 01:54:46,811
it will,

3897
01:54:46,811 --> 01:54:47,291
it's cold.

3898
01:54:47,291 --> 01:54:51,700
It's very cold on Mars during the
days I should say the Saul's so Mars,

3899
01:54:51,930 --> 01:54:53,590
it has a different day than earth,

3900
01:54:53,591 --> 01:54:55,360
so they call themselves during the salts.

3901
01:54:55,361 --> 01:54:56,194
They have um,

3902
01:54:56,490 --> 01:54:56,800
uh,

3903
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,650
it actually does get pretty
warm like in the forties.

3904
01:54:59,770 --> 01:55:00,090
Um,

3905
01:55:00,090 --> 01:55:00,940
but at night it's like,

3906
01:55:01,750 --> 01:55:02,830
it's too cold to survive.

3907
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:03,281
It's so,

3908
01:55:03,281 --> 01:55:06,280
so cold and there's no
liquid water on Mars,

3909
01:55:06,281 --> 01:55:07,690
so they'd have to figure that out too.

3910
01:55:07,990 --> 01:55:08,823
Fuck that.

3911
01:55:09,150 --> 01:55:10,150
Don't go to Mars.

3912
01:55:10,151 --> 01:55:12,970
People stop trying to prove a point.

3913
01:55:12,971 --> 01:55:14,030
You crazy ass hole.

3914
01:55:17,050 --> 01:55:18,400
I kept wanting to say to them like,

3915
01:55:18,401 --> 01:55:20,050
you're so fucking crazy.

3916
01:55:20,051 --> 01:55:20,920
But then I want it to be like,

3917
01:55:20,921 --> 01:55:23,190
it's because of crazy
motherfuckers like you.

3918
01:55:23,470 --> 01:55:24,460
That stuff happens.

3919
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:25,930
It's because somebody was like,

3920
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:29,530
let's go to the fucking
moon and everybody's and
probably somebody who don't

3921
01:55:29,531 --> 01:55:30,460
fucking go to the moon.

3922
01:55:30,461 --> 01:55:31,241
You're going to die.

3923
01:55:31,241 --> 01:55:31,991
You idiot.

3924
01:55:31,991 --> 01:55:33,700
But they figured out how to go.

3925
01:55:33,701 --> 01:55:37,240
How cool would it be if we keep on frog
hopping from like Mars to another plant,

3926
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:39,630
to another planet and
then it just gets code.

3927
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:43,980
There's no like it wasn't programmed
that would actually go that far

3928
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:44,260
out.

3929
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:49,260
[inaudible] they haven't
figured out that part.

3930
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:52,310
Yeah.

3931
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:53,143
Whoa.

3932
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:55,840
Do you buy into like the
simulation theory talked?

3933
01:55:55,841 --> 01:55:57,860
I mean do you ever
entertain it whatsoever?

3934
01:55:57,890 --> 01:55:58,401
You know I was,

3935
01:55:58,401 --> 01:56:01,160
I was talking to the scientists that
I interviewed about it and I was like,

3936
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:02,293
first of all,

3937
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:04,010
do you really believe this?

3938
01:56:04,011 --> 01:56:04,610
And he was like,

3939
01:56:04,610 --> 01:56:05,361
I'm a scientist,

3940
01:56:05,361 --> 01:56:06,320
I'm not a philosopher.

3941
01:56:06,321 --> 01:56:07,790
I just tried to look at the math.

3942
01:56:08,030 --> 01:56:09,440
And so I stopped him and said,

3943
01:56:09,480 --> 01:56:10,290
you know,

3944
01:56:10,290 --> 01:56:15,290
you eventually scientific conferences
and you also talk about it to the media

3945
01:56:15,740 --> 01:56:17,620
and eventually you use the word they,

3946
01:56:17,630 --> 01:56:17,931
you know,

3947
01:56:17,931 --> 01:56:18,550
if times,

3948
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:19,760
so maybe they are right.

3949
01:56:19,761 --> 01:56:20,151
And I was like,

3950
01:56:20,151 --> 01:56:22,890
who is this day I want to talk
to you about where you know,

3951
01:56:23,170 --> 01:56:25,820
and he had the most brilliant answer
cause I thought he was going to go the God

3952
01:56:25,821 --> 01:56:26,900
route and I was like no fuck.

3953
01:56:27,110 --> 01:56:28,190
But he had the most brilliant answer.

3954
01:56:28,191 --> 01:56:29,200
He said once,

3955
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:37,190
he said we are finally at a point in
our evolution that we are sophisticated

3956
01:56:38,541 --> 01:56:41,450
enough to write these
fundamental bits of code.

3957
01:56:41,720 --> 01:56:42,920
Cause that's the whole point of this.

3958
01:56:43,070 --> 01:56:45,350
Who's to say that we aren't a simulation?

3959
01:56:45,351 --> 01:56:49,220
If we can write our own simulation of
a very small portion of the universe,

3960
01:56:49,490 --> 01:56:49,641
well,

3961
01:56:49,641 --> 01:56:51,590
if we're sophisticated
enough to write our own,

3962
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:53,120
a very small simulation,

3963
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:57,290
who's to say that hundreds of thousand
years in the future we couldn't simulate

3964
01:56:57,291 --> 01:56:58,100
the whole universe.

3965
01:56:58,100 --> 01:57:02,600
So maybe the day is just us simulating
the past to figure out where they came

3966
01:57:02,601 --> 01:57:03,170
from.

3967
01:57:03,170 --> 01:57:03,411
Well,

3968
01:57:03,411 --> 01:57:08,411
I said that my take on the simulation
theory was that we live in the future like

3969
01:57:08,780 --> 01:57:10,070
those gray aliens.

3970
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:10,940
That's us.

3971
01:57:10,940 --> 01:57:12,200
That's what we really look like.

3972
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:16,730
We have no sexual organs because we
figured out a way to reproduce through

3973
01:57:16,731 --> 01:57:17,421
genetics,

3974
01:57:17,421 --> 01:57:20,420
genetic mutations or
you don't exist anymore.

3975
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:25,100
Giant eyeballs with builtin sunglasses
because we completely fucked up the

3976
01:57:25,101 --> 01:57:25,800
environment,

3977
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:26,571
need sunglasses.

3978
01:57:26,571 --> 01:57:27,404
Everywhere we go,

3979
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,920
we don't have a mouth anymore because
we talk with our brain and we're bored.

3980
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:32,690
We fucked up.

3981
01:57:32,691 --> 01:57:36,890
We engineered all the fun out of
reality to see where we came from.

3982
01:57:36,891 --> 01:57:41,420
We went back to the roaring
twenties technological age,

3983
01:57:41,421 --> 01:57:45,120
the time where people were still sending
Dick pics to people on Facebook and it

3984
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:46,200
nutty shit was still going to,

3985
01:57:46,201 --> 01:57:47,150
no one knew the rules.

3986
01:57:47,151 --> 01:57:48,470
This is the wild west of the,

3987
01:57:48,471 --> 01:57:49,520
of the Internet age.

3988
01:57:50,330 --> 01:57:52,880
We live in a future that's just not fun.

3989
01:57:52,881 --> 01:57:57,470
We've engineered all the good times out
of it and what we've decided to do is go

3990
01:57:57,471 --> 01:58:02,471
back to the roaring twenties of what it
all was fucking wild and crazy and you

3991
01:58:02,871 --> 01:58:04,220
could get bit torrent still

3992
01:58:04,250 --> 01:58:05,660
when we were watching rejected.

3993
01:58:05,661 --> 01:58:06,700
You guys remember rejected.

3994
01:58:08,350 --> 01:58:09,183
Ooh,

3995
01:58:10,910 --> 01:58:11,743
Ooh.

3996
01:58:12,370 --> 01:58:14,260
Talking about this for so long and I'll,

3997
01:58:14,261 --> 01:58:15,880
although I am joking
around when I say that,

3998
01:58:15,881 --> 01:58:18,950
I don't really believe that we are the
aliens cause I don't really believe any

3999
01:58:18,951 --> 01:58:19,090
of it.

4000
01:58:19,090 --> 01:58:19,710
I don't really know.

4001
01:58:19,710 --> 01:58:19,951
Yeah.

4002
01:58:19,951 --> 01:58:22,510
I mean it's hard to believe
something without good evidence,

4003
01:58:22,511 --> 01:58:24,350
but it's interesting to philosophize

4004
01:58:24,450 --> 01:58:25,990
and it's also interesting that that,

4005
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:27,640
that sort of archetype,

4006
01:58:27,670 --> 01:58:28,510
that alien,

4007
01:58:28,511 --> 01:58:31,270
that's sort of a really
stereotypical alien.

4008
01:58:31,470 --> 01:58:34,480
It repeats itself over and over
and over again with the big head,

4009
01:58:34,481 --> 01:58:35,291
the little skinny body.

4010
01:58:35,291 --> 01:58:35,590
Yeah.

4011
01:58:35,590 --> 01:58:36,400
What does religion,

4012
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:40,210
if you look at all of the lore built
into religion across so many cultures,

4013
01:58:40,211 --> 01:58:42,140
the Virgin Birth Story,

4014
01:58:42,140 --> 01:58:43,410
the resurrection story,

4015
01:58:43,411 --> 01:58:45,590
so many religions use that.

4016
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:48,380
But as far as like the way
a human looks from the wig,

4017
01:58:48,381 --> 01:58:49,310
gorilla looks,

4018
01:58:49,450 --> 01:58:49,750
you know,

4019
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:52,640
you look at other primates and
you know the way monkeys look,

4020
01:58:52,641 --> 01:58:53,031
the way,

4021
01:58:53,031 --> 01:58:53,241
you know,

4022
01:58:53,241 --> 01:58:53,901
we have to figure,

4023
01:58:53,901 --> 01:58:56,960
we all came from some very
similar source at one long,

4024
01:58:56,961 --> 01:58:58,250
long distant part in the past.

4025
01:58:58,450 --> 01:59:01,280
If you look at a gorilla and then you
look at a person and then you look at an

4026
01:59:01,281 --> 01:59:01,940
alien,

4027
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:02,331
it's like,

4028
01:59:02,331 --> 01:59:02,511
yeah,

4029
01:59:02,511 --> 01:59:02,841
that's,

4030
01:59:02,841 --> 01:59:03,640
that's how it goes.

4031
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:03,821
Yeah.

4032
01:59:03,821 --> 01:59:05,230
I mean it doesn't seem that far fetched.

4033
01:59:05,231 --> 01:59:08,560
Like why would we develop like scales
or like have a shark fin or some shit

4034
01:59:08,561 --> 01:59:10,240
that's like not our evolutionary lineage.

4035
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:11,241
By the way.

4036
01:59:11,241 --> 01:59:13,970
They're developing all
these artificial skins.

4037
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,620
Some of them with spider silk,

4038
01:59:15,621 --> 01:59:17,540
did they believe it's
going to be bulletproof?

4039
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:22,670
They're talking about engineering
human skin with fucking spider silk.

4040
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:25,310
So you become like some
bulletproof person.

4041
01:59:25,610 --> 01:59:25,931
Do you know?

4042
01:59:25,931 --> 01:59:26,470
Fuck it.

4043
01:59:26,470 --> 01:59:30,000
That's sad when people
don't tear open anymore.

4044
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:31,110
Like you can't like,

4045
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:32,110
like that's what it's going to be.

4046
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:35,700
That's what it's going to take for
people to stop fucking like having gun

4047
01:59:35,701 --> 01:59:36,210
violence.

4048
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:38,250
But what if we all become bulletproof?

4049
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:38,491
Yeah.

4050
01:59:38,491 --> 01:59:41,970
But what if you couldn't feel shit when
you like we're touching each other well

4051
01:59:41,971 --> 01:59:45,080
and you have bulletproof coffee
only shoot for the balls,

4052
01:59:45,081 --> 01:59:46,220
everyone to aiming for the deck.

4053
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:48,710
So bulletproof deck

4054
01:59:50,790 --> 01:59:53,070
your genitals would be the only
thing that wouldn't be bulletproof.

4055
01:59:53,071 --> 01:59:53,490
Right?

4056
01:59:53,490 --> 01:59:54,323
Yeah.

4057
01:59:54,940 --> 01:59:55,170
I mean,

4058
01:59:55,170 --> 01:59:57,620
you know that there are
people who have a genetic um,

4059
01:59:57,690 --> 01:59:59,370
deficits where they can't feel pain.

4060
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:00,050
Yeah.

4061
02:00:00,050 --> 02:00:00,360
And it's,

4062
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:01,440
and it sounds like a perk,

4063
02:00:01,441 --> 02:00:02,130
but it is not,

4064
02:00:02,130 --> 02:00:05,070
they usually die because they break bones.

4065
02:00:05,071 --> 02:00:05,910
They'll have internal bleed,

4066
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:07,650
they'll get an accident
and they won't know.

4067
02:00:07,970 --> 02:00:11,260
Well that's also been the speculation
for people that do a lot of uh,

4068
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:12,980
a body like,

4069
02:00:13,370 --> 02:00:16,670
like piercing their balls
and craziness and yeah.

4070
02:00:17,410 --> 02:00:18,580
Things under their skin.

4071
02:00:18,980 --> 02:00:19,860
They say that they're having,

4072
02:00:19,861 --> 02:00:23,750
that they have a hard time feeling things
and like real severe pain is like the

4073
02:00:23,751 --> 02:00:25,430
only thing that lets them
know that they're alive.

4074
02:00:25,940 --> 02:00:28,190
Disconnect between that mechanism.

4075
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:29,840
They say that a lot of people who,

4076
02:00:29,841 --> 02:00:30,170
uh,

4077
02:00:30,170 --> 02:00:32,930
choose to have a get
let animals fuck them.

4078
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:34,850
Or like a lot of those
guys have the same thing.

4079
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:37,480
This is not true.

4080
02:00:39,860 --> 02:00:40,250
Brian,

4081
02:00:40,250 --> 02:00:42,220
his peers probably brought
it back to the dolphin.

4082
02:00:42,221 --> 02:00:43,390
Fucking Mr. Haney.

4083
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:44,500
Um,

4084
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:49,470
Mr hands is a of a very famous Internet
video of a guy who got killed while

4085
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:50,560
horse was having sex with them.

4086
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:51,370
And there the,

4087
02:00:51,370 --> 02:00:53,710
they actually made a documentary
about the whole situation.

4088
02:00:53,711 --> 02:00:55,830
It's called zoo because the,

4089
02:00:55,831 --> 02:00:59,350
the realized there was a whole group of
people that lived in Washington state

4090
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:01,150
and we're having sex
with all these animals.

4091
02:01:01,151 --> 02:01:05,050
And they had all these video because
it was legal and is that so they move,

4092
02:01:05,051 --> 02:01:07,510
they met on the Internet and they moved
to Washington state and they all like,

4093
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:10,180
like went to this farm
and they got together.

4094
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:10,720
All right.

4095
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:11,620
The animals.

4096
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:11,831
Well,

4097
02:01:11,831 --> 02:01:12,664
the animals,

4098
02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:13,541
the animals,

4099
02:01:13,541 --> 02:01:14,800
just fuck horses.

4100
02:01:14,830 --> 02:01:15,191
Horses.

4101
02:01:15,191 --> 02:01:16,024
Fuck them.

4102
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:18,320
Fuck this guy and killed on it.

4103
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:19,450
But the horse is still alive.

4104
02:01:19,510 --> 02:01:19,791
Yeah.

4105
02:01:19,791 --> 02:01:20,141
Oh yeah.

4106
02:01:20,141 --> 02:01:20,920
It was fine.

4107
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:22,060
He didn't even bleed.

4108
02:01:22,970 --> 02:01:23,240
It get

4109
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:24,073
scratched.

4110
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:24,943
But he,

4111
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:28,670
the guy who's getting fucked by the horse
has all these piercings all over his

4112
02:01:28,671 --> 02:01:32,390
balls and I was talking to a
doctor about it and it's like it's,

4113
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:33,020
it's there's,

4114
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:37,700
there's very often those really self
destructive people have like an issue like

4115
02:01:37,701 --> 02:01:38,534
feeling pain.

4116
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:38,871
Yeah.

4117
02:01:38,871 --> 02:01:39,371
I could see that.

4118
02:01:39,371 --> 02:01:40,420
Whether it's a psychological

4119
02:01:40,420 --> 02:01:41,960
block or an actual physical,

4120
02:01:42,030 --> 02:01:43,840
what does that say about
us with all the tattoos?

4121
02:01:44,110 --> 02:01:44,441
I don't know.

4122
02:01:44,441 --> 02:01:45,280
I just think they look cool.

4123
02:01:45,330 --> 02:01:46,210
I think they look cool too.

4124
02:01:46,270 --> 02:01:47,050
I like art.

4125
02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:48,150
I like art and I don't,

4126
02:01:48,160 --> 02:01:50,500
I don't mind having them having
it on my body and people are like,

4127
02:01:50,501 --> 02:01:51,281
well then it's forever,

4128
02:01:51,281 --> 02:01:54,370
but I don't really think of this molecule
that you have on your arm that's done

4129
02:01:54,380 --> 02:01:55,213
a field trip to mean.

4130
02:01:55,630 --> 02:01:56,021
I did it.

4131
02:01:56,021 --> 02:01:56,351
I did.

4132
02:01:56,351 --> 02:02:01,351
I did a piece about the near death
experience questioning whether it was just

4133
02:02:01,421 --> 02:02:02,201
because of DMT.

4134
02:02:02,201 --> 02:02:04,390
Then also the alien abduction experience.

4135
02:02:04,550 --> 02:02:05,383
Yeah.

4136
02:02:05,610 --> 02:02:07,290
Variance in the the near death experience.

4137
02:02:07,291 --> 02:02:09,870
All of them they believe
may be influenced by DMT.

4138
02:02:10,830 --> 02:02:12,090
We know our brain makes it,

4139
02:02:12,091 --> 02:02:13,550
we know the lungs producer,

4140
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:14,490
we know it's produced in the liver,

4141
02:02:14,491 --> 02:02:16,470
and we also know it's
unbelievably psychoactive

4142
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:20,280
and that just feels like a little bit
more rational and explanation to me.

4143
02:02:20,630 --> 02:02:23,580
Certainly for the alien abduction thing.

4144
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:24,533
Yeah,

4145
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:25,620
the alien abduction thing.

4146
02:02:25,621 --> 02:02:26,041
What is that?

4147
02:02:26,041 --> 02:02:26,874
You Bitch,

4148
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:30,570
you're getting presence
on the air on the podcast.

4149
02:02:30,930 --> 02:02:31,021
Oh,

4150
02:02:31,021 --> 02:02:32,760
he stopped recording like hours ago,

4151
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:35,220
president.

4152
02:02:35,220 --> 02:02:36,320
It took me forever to find that.

4153
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:38,673
It's a,

4154
02:02:38,930 --> 02:02:39,600
it's a,

4155
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:43,660
it's a chimpanzee [inaudible] hour.

4156
02:02:43,690 --> 02:02:44,523
It comes out and goes.

4157
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:47,410
That might be the cutest thing.

4158
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:50,460
That's awesome man.

4159
02:02:50,550 --> 02:02:53,010
I love it too little monkey.

4160
02:02:56,260 --> 02:03:01,260
Even though my production company is
called talking Mckee and my tee shirt

4161
02:03:01,951 --> 02:03:03,270
company is called higher primate.

4162
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:05,173
I have a,

4163
02:03:05,270 --> 02:03:06,420
I have an issue with monkeys.

4164
02:03:06,810 --> 02:03:07,643
I don't know what it is.

4165
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:09,070
We have a common ancestor.

4166
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:12,230
I Dunno.

4167
02:03:14,770 --> 02:03:15,420
Yeah.

4168
02:03:15,420 --> 02:03:15,980
What's the difference?

4169
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:16,651
Monkeys have tails.

4170
02:03:16,651 --> 02:03:17,070
Right.

4171
02:03:17,070 --> 02:03:17,903
And they're more

4172
02:03:19,390 --> 02:03:20,223
conti.

4173
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:45,670
Um,

4174
02:03:45,670 --> 02:03:50,670
do you believe that there is an
undiscovered primate living in the Pacific

4175
02:03:51,071 --> 02:03:52,090
northwest?

4176
02:03:52,570 --> 02:03:53,980
That people believe that?

4177
02:03:53,981 --> 02:03:54,310
No.

4178
02:03:54,310 --> 02:03:55,180
They know it's bigfoot.

4179
02:03:55,370 --> 02:03:55,850
No.

4180
02:03:55,850 --> 02:03:56,510
No.

4181
02:03:56,510 --> 02:03:57,400
We have to ask everyone

4182
02:03:58,690 --> 02:04:01,000
who killed [inaudible].

4183
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:01,981
Okay.

4184
02:04:01,981 --> 02:04:02,521
First of all,

4185
02:04:02,521 --> 02:04:02,821
do you know?

4186
02:04:02,821 --> 02:04:03,654
Says yes.

4187
02:04:04,060 --> 02:04:04,893
Jane Goodall.

4188
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:05,783
She's convinced.

4189
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:07,021
Yeah,

4190
02:04:07,021 --> 02:04:07,854
she's convinced.

4191
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:11,520
She said that there's far too many
stories that are exactly the same.

4192
02:04:11,521 --> 02:04:13,500
The the images throughout time.

4193
02:04:13,630 --> 02:04:16,560
This pictograph over a thousand years ago.

4194
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:17,631
She,

4195
02:04:17,631 --> 02:04:17,840
she,

4196
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:18,673
she wants to believe,

4197
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:20,300
I believe.

4198
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:21,570
I'll believe it when I see evidence.

4199
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:22,150
They

4200
02:04:22,150 --> 02:04:23,080
know that it's a,

4201
02:04:23,090 --> 02:04:26,440
they know that a driver can't epiphysis
existed alongside human beings as

4202
02:04:26,441 --> 02:04:27,910
recently as 100,000 years ago.

4203
02:04:27,911 --> 02:04:28,361
In fact,

4204
02:04:28,361 --> 02:04:29,320
there was bones of them.

4205
02:04:29,321 --> 02:04:32,590
They would discover it in like one
of those Chinese medicine places.

4206
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:34,280
Gigantic [inaudible].

4207
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:37,350
This is an actual bipedal ape that existed

4208
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:39,660
as recently as a hundred
thousand years ago.

4209
02:04:39,690 --> 02:04:42,060
Possibly more recently
lived alongside people.

4210
02:04:42,061 --> 02:04:43,230
It was eight feet tall,

4211
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:48,000
huge and Asia and may have came down
the Bering straits along with people.

4212
02:04:48,330 --> 02:04:51,930
And the idea is that if
there were intelligent and
they probably are just like,

4213
02:04:52,050 --> 02:04:52,321
you know,

4214
02:04:52,321 --> 02:04:53,320
if they're by pedal,

4215
02:04:53,380 --> 02:04:54,700
they might be the only other,

4216
02:04:54,701 --> 02:04:54,851
I mean,

4217
02:04:54,851 --> 02:04:55,150
yeah.

4218
02:04:55,150 --> 02:04:55,871
Did we fuck them?

4219
02:04:55,871 --> 02:04:56,491
Because we fucked me,

4220
02:04:56,491 --> 02:04:57,220
Andrew.

4221
02:04:57,220 --> 02:04:59,470
I mean there's Neanderthal
DNA in many humans.

4222
02:04:59,500 --> 02:04:59,671
Yeah,

4223
02:04:59,671 --> 02:05:00,504
but isn't it

4224
02:05:00,850 --> 02:05:04,740
whether or not we fucked them and whether
or not we just have their trace DNA in

4225
02:05:04,741 --> 02:05:05,000
her,

4226
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,250
what would we get it
without fucking right.

4227
02:05:06,780 --> 02:05:07,090
I'll,

4228
02:05:07,090 --> 02:05:07,301
I'll,

4229
02:05:07,301 --> 02:05:09,520
I'll put that up because I don't
understand that we've talked to that.

4230
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:11,080
Do you think we fucked
them where they fucked up?

4231
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:11,800
They fucked us.

4232
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:12,220
Either one.

4233
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:13,960
Did they fuck the girls or the men?

4234
02:05:13,961 --> 02:05:14,330
Fuck this.

4235
02:05:14,330 --> 02:05:14,920
I don't know.

4236
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:17,800
We probably double fucked to them because
they are no longer around and we still

4237
02:05:17,801 --> 02:05:18,220
are.

4238
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:18,431
Yeah.

4239
02:05:18,431 --> 02:05:19,241
We told you're fuck.

4240
02:05:19,241 --> 02:05:20,080
There's actually a,

4241
02:05:20,081 --> 02:05:20,550
there's a,

4242
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:22,060
I'm going to do a piece on it.

4243
02:05:22,090 --> 02:05:22,270
Um,

4244
02:05:22,270 --> 02:05:23,790
I just got my kit in the mail.

4245
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:26,970
Nat Geo has this like geno typing or this,

4246
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:27,761
not geno typing,

4247
02:05:27,761 --> 02:05:31,960
but this genographic project
where you can do a g a cheek swab,

4248
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:36,890
send them your DNA and they will give
you like the background of your ancestor.

4249
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:37,230
Yeah.

4250
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:37,950
I'm all monkey.

4251
02:05:37,950 --> 02:05:38,741
They're gonna find out.

4252
02:05:38,741 --> 02:05:40,140
I'm not even a fucking
like monkey throwing,

4253
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:42,100
throwing something like you
have to do a monthly thing.

4254
02:05:42,101 --> 02:05:43,360
I was going to do it,

4255
02:05:43,361 --> 02:05:45,460
but then I've found like
it was a subscription.

4256
02:05:45,490 --> 02:05:48,000
Some kinds of description study.

4257
02:05:48,460 --> 02:05:49,040
Yeah.

4258
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:49,461
Here it is.

4259
02:05:49,461 --> 02:05:50,151
Study casts,

4260
02:05:50,151 --> 02:05:51,330
doubt on human neanderthals.

4261
02:05:51,350 --> 02:05:52,220
Interbreeding theory.

4262
02:05:52,221 --> 02:05:56,570
Cambridge scientists claim DNA overlap
between the entitles and notice how I

4263
02:05:56,571 --> 02:05:57,500
said in the end are tall.

4264
02:05:57,630 --> 02:05:58,290
Nanda tall.

4265
02:05:58,290 --> 02:05:58,540
Yeah.

4266
02:05:58,540 --> 02:06:00,080
Smart person on the podcast.

4267
02:06:00,081 --> 02:06:01,750
You uh,

4268
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:04,670
and modern humans is a
remnant of a common name.

4269
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:05,090
Yeah.

4270
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:05,790
It could be that kid.

4271
02:06:05,790 --> 02:06:06,990
That could be the case also.

4272
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:08,850
Or are we going to fuck dumb?

4273
02:06:08,910 --> 02:06:09,360
Come on.

4274
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:10,171
How do they really know?

4275
02:06:10,171 --> 02:06:11,960
For sure we will somebody fucked one.

4276
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:13,990
No doubt if they were alive with this.

4277
02:06:14,010 --> 02:06:16,170
It's just whether or not
they ever encountered.

4278
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:17,250
Yeah,

4279
02:06:17,250 --> 02:06:17,731
but I don't know.

4280
02:06:17,731 --> 02:06:19,650
I mean if people fuck horses.

4281
02:06:19,710 --> 02:06:20,170
Yeah.

4282
02:06:20,170 --> 02:06:21,090
Where's the mermaids?

4283
02:06:22,630 --> 02:06:22,800
Well,

4284
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:23,521
we never fucked.

4285
02:06:23,521 --> 02:06:27,540
I don't think we ever fucked anything
that like lived in the water that looked

4286
02:06:27,541 --> 02:06:28,081
like a person.

4287
02:06:28,081 --> 02:06:28,241
Yeah.

4288
02:06:28,241 --> 02:06:28,500
I don't think,

4289
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:28,651
well,

4290
02:06:28,651 --> 02:06:30,270
and we wouldn't have
viable offspring anyway.

4291
02:06:30,271 --> 02:06:31,950
We couldn't fuck a chimp and make a baby.

4292
02:06:31,980 --> 02:06:32,130
Right.

4293
02:06:32,130 --> 02:06:32,581
Like it would,

4294
02:06:32,581 --> 02:06:33,750
it would spontaneously abort.

4295
02:06:33,751 --> 02:06:34,471
But if they're close enough,

4296
02:06:34,471 --> 02:06:38,370
like a dog and a wolf can have sex
and they'll have viable offspring.

4297
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:39,870
Well all dogs came from wall.

4298
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:40,501
Exactly.

4299
02:06:40,501 --> 02:06:40,891
And so,

4300
02:06:40,891 --> 02:06:41,760
so it's fuck,

4301
02:06:41,790 --> 02:06:44,490
it's a mind fuck in and
of itself or towels in us.

4302
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:46,080
If we were close enough,

4303
02:06:46,090 --> 02:06:49,290
we might have been able
to have viable offspring,

4304
02:06:49,291 --> 02:06:50,124
but we don't know.

4305
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:51,061
Oh yeah,

4306
02:06:51,061 --> 02:06:51,720
I bet some,

4307
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:53,490
well maybe a few of them,

4308
02:06:53,491 --> 02:06:54,920
maybe they're really smart
in the end are talking.

4309
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:55,890
Maybe we did fuck them,

4310
02:06:55,891 --> 02:06:59,430
but maybe it is a trace from a common
ancestor and we just walked him for fun.

4311
02:06:59,431 --> 02:07:00,780
And that's not how we got their DNA.

4312
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:05,900
Me is first of all how few fossils
there really are as opposed to how many

4313
02:07:05,901 --> 02:07:08,690
things that ever lived and when
they find something new like that,

4314
02:07:08,691 --> 02:07:10,810
home loaf homofloresiensis stuff though.

4315
02:07:10,820 --> 02:07:12,680
The hobbit man from the Ilo Flores,

4316
02:07:12,950 --> 02:07:14,750
that makes you wreck really geek out.

4317
02:07:14,751 --> 02:07:15,620
Like Holy Shit,

4318
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:17,870
ten thousand thirteen thousand
years ago there was this

4319
02:07:18,090 --> 02:07:19,920
monkey man and they just found,

4320
02:07:19,950 --> 02:07:22,530
they just found like the biggest dinosaur.

4321
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:23,880
Yeah.

4322
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:24,930
Or not the biggest.

4323
02:07:24,931 --> 02:07:25,411
The oldest.

4324
02:07:25,411 --> 02:07:25,711
I'm sorry,

4325
02:07:25,711 --> 02:07:26,850
the oldest dinosaur.

4326
02:07:27,330 --> 02:07:27,631
I wish.

4327
02:07:27,631 --> 02:07:28,650
I thought I had it pulled out.

4328
02:07:28,651 --> 02:07:31,470
If Monsanto just paid for
all these dinosaur bones,

4329
02:07:31,471 --> 02:07:34,770
there was never really dinosaurs and
it's this huge thing just to control the

4330
02:07:34,790 --> 02:07:35,510
population.

4331
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:37,030
Bones existed before Monsanto.

4332
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:40,010
You could have Google
saved us so much time.

4333
02:07:40,011 --> 02:07:42,410
You mother would've been Santa
was a different thing back then.

4334
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:43,070
Indians.

4335
02:07:43,070 --> 02:07:46,550
Funny is that there are creationists
who really think the dinosaur bones were

4336
02:07:46,551 --> 02:07:48,950
put into the ground to test our faith.

4337
02:07:49,020 --> 02:07:49,800
That's brilliant.

4338
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:50,241
The the,

4339
02:07:50,241 --> 02:07:50,451
the,

4340
02:07:50,451 --> 02:07:54,060
the ability to control really
fucking dumb people is an art form.

4341
02:07:54,290 --> 02:07:55,021
It really is.

4342
02:07:55,021 --> 02:07:58,290
If you watch those dudes that are on
the late night TV shows screaming and

4343
02:07:58,291 --> 02:08:00,090
hollering and a Hooten about Jesus,

4344
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:02,220
there is an art form to that.

4345
02:08:02,730 --> 02:08:03,690
Sam Kinison who was,

4346
02:08:03,691 --> 02:08:04,524
in my opinion,

4347
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:05,610
at least at one point,

4348
02:08:05,611 --> 02:08:05,781
Tom,

4349
02:08:05,781 --> 02:08:08,430
he was the greatest comedian
ever for like a like a year.

4350
02:08:08,431 --> 02:08:09,870
I think he's the greatest
community in ever.

4351
02:08:10,050 --> 02:08:12,270
That's how I started out as a preacher.

4352
02:08:12,271 --> 02:08:12,820
He was a

4353
02:08:12,820 --> 02:08:14,520
Pentecostal tongue.

4354
02:08:14,521 --> 02:08:14,980
Jesus.

4355
02:08:14,980 --> 02:08:15,221
He was,

4356
02:08:15,221 --> 02:08:15,731
yeah,

4357
02:08:15,731 --> 02:08:16,480
he was.

4358
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:17,910
I'm pretty sure it's Pentecostal.

4359
02:08:18,510 --> 02:08:21,440
I think I should look that up
because I'm a big fan of Kennison,

4360
02:08:21,441 --> 02:08:22,161
but whatever he was,

4361
02:08:22,161 --> 02:08:24,050
he was a reverend and a,

4362
02:08:24,051 --> 02:08:24,680
you know that,

4363
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:26,930
that's where he got his
skill from on stage.

4364
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:28,970
That like commanding presence.

4365
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:31,970
That's a very specific
type of performance art.

4366
02:08:33,190 --> 02:08:35,270
It's just getting rubes to send you money.

4367
02:08:35,850 --> 02:08:36,720
I just found,

4368
02:08:36,721 --> 02:08:38,940
I just found this article
about this dinosaur.

4369
02:08:38,970 --> 02:08:41,640
It was called Nyasa saurus pairing.

4370
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:42,593
Tony.

4371
02:08:42,690 --> 02:08:43,140
Wow.

4372
02:08:43,140 --> 02:08:43,890
And it was it,

4373
02:08:43,890 --> 02:08:44,521
it was small.

4374
02:08:44,521 --> 02:08:46,080
It was the size of a Labrador.

4375
02:08:46,081 --> 02:08:50,730
But they say that it came from
about 240 to 245 million years ago,

4376
02:08:50,731 --> 02:08:52,650
which would make it one of
the earliest dinosaurs ever.

4377
02:08:52,860 --> 02:08:54,840
And it would've been
roaming pangea at the time,

4378
02:08:54,870 --> 02:08:59,840
basically when all the continents
were one big supercontinent Uzi,

4379
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:02,380
you know my favorite animal
that nobody knows about?

4380
02:09:02,650 --> 02:09:03,011
Terror,

4381
02:09:03,011 --> 02:09:03,790
birds,

4382
02:09:03,790 --> 02:09:06,940
terror birds like terror or birds.

4383
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:07,920
What's a terror?

4384
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:12,160
Gigantic predatory birds
that roamed North America.

4385
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:13,653
They,

4386
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:14,400
it's reasonable.

4387
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:14,611
I mean,

4388
02:09:14,611 --> 02:09:16,530
because birds are dinosaurs.

4389
02:09:16,531 --> 02:09:17,940
Like we know that for a fact,

4390
02:09:17,941 --> 02:09:19,590
dinosaurs evolved to become birds.

4391
02:09:19,591 --> 02:09:22,980
Actually the tattoo on my right arm
right here is a is archaeopteryx

4392
02:09:22,981 --> 02:09:23,730
lithographic,

4393
02:09:23,730 --> 02:09:26,280
which is basically a Burg dinosaur.

4394
02:09:26,281 --> 02:09:28,140
It was a total missing link.

4395
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:31,170
These things are fucking horrifying.

4396
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:33,210
I think birds today
are kind of horrifying.

4397
02:09:33,250 --> 02:09:36,040
Have you ever seen the documentary
the BBC did on the Congo and this one

4398
02:09:36,041 --> 02:09:37,660
gigantic prehistoric bird,

4399
02:09:37,661 --> 02:09:42,250
I think it's called the shoe bill and
it's this crazy ancient dinosaur of a

4400
02:09:42,251 --> 02:09:42,491
bird.

4401
02:09:42,491 --> 02:09:43,780
It's about five feet tall,

4402
02:09:45,170 --> 02:09:46,490
enormous,

4403
02:09:46,550 --> 02:09:49,940
huge beak and it's walking in the water.

4404
02:09:49,941 --> 02:09:50,800
All creepy.

4405
02:09:50,801 --> 02:09:53,090
I'd and fucked up with huge piece.

4406
02:09:53,180 --> 02:09:57,320
I mean the biggest like three feet long
and then it plunges in water and kills

4407
02:09:57,321 --> 02:09:58,640
this fish and pulls it out.

4408
02:09:58,970 --> 02:10:01,790
It's fucking weird is by the way,

4409
02:10:01,791 --> 02:10:03,470
that thing would eat a baby.

4410
02:10:04,190 --> 02:10:06,200
You left the baby on the
ground with that thing.

4411
02:10:06,201 --> 02:10:07,910
That thing would eat the
fuck out of your baby.

4412
02:10:09,650 --> 02:10:13,010
Do you know any friends who have
African gray parrots like as pets?

4413
02:10:13,011 --> 02:10:14,900
Those things live like 60 years.

4414
02:10:15,310 --> 02:10:18,710
We look them in the eye and they look
at you all creepy and you can see the

4415
02:10:18,711 --> 02:10:23,200
dinosaur fucking scary birds,

4416
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:24,380
birds,

4417
02:10:24,380 --> 02:10:25,213
birds

4418
02:10:27,550 --> 02:10:32,270
are our national animal is a
fucking evil cunt of a bird.

4419
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:34,440
Our national animal.

4420
02:10:34,441 --> 02:10:35,040
You look at the,

4421
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:36,040
you ever look at an eagle?

4422
02:10:36,041 --> 02:10:36,240
Me,

4423
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:38,500
I think I've talked to fucking coachee.

4424
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:43,280
That is the most reptilian bird you could
ever possibly wrap your head around.

4425
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:45,030
All the raptors really are,

4426
02:10:45,031 --> 02:10:46,730
I mean scary,

4427
02:10:47,970 --> 02:10:49,910
just like the raptors from Jurassic Park,

4428
02:10:49,911 --> 02:10:50,510
like that's,

4429
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:54,970
that's really the same kind of thing
you're dealing with and they're smart of

4430
02:10:55,910 --> 02:10:56,720
crows.

4431
02:10:56,720 --> 02:11:00,020
I Love Crows because people paint
crows out to be really evil.

4432
02:11:00,140 --> 02:11:01,490
I did a whole piece on crows.

4433
02:11:01,640 --> 02:11:02,930
They're brilliant,

4434
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:04,880
they're clever as fuck,

4435
02:11:04,890 --> 02:11:05,370
and they're so,

4436
02:11:05,370 --> 02:11:06,470
and they're beautiful.

4437
02:11:06,750 --> 02:11:10,580
They might be as smart
as dolphins use tools.

4438
02:11:11,380 --> 02:11:13,120
I interviewed this guy
who does crow research.

4439
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:16,670
They did this study where they wore
masks and like just neutral masks,

4440
02:11:16,671 --> 02:11:17,504
but they would do,

4441
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:22,160
they would do a helpful condition and
then kind of like a harsh condition.

4442
02:11:22,161 --> 02:11:23,360
So the healthful condition,

4443
02:11:23,361 --> 02:11:26,540
they would feed the crows and then in the
harsh position they would capture them

4444
02:11:26,570 --> 02:11:27,403
and tag them.

4445
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:29,990
And so then when they went
outside wearing the masks,

4446
02:11:30,110 --> 02:11:31,550
I think for up to seven years,

4447
02:11:31,580 --> 02:11:32,960
maybe 10 years later,

4448
02:11:33,410 --> 02:11:33,740
the,

4449
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:36,590
when they saw somebody in a mask
that was in the helpful condition,

4450
02:11:36,591 --> 02:11:38,000
the crows would come up and ask for food.

4451
02:11:38,001 --> 02:11:39,650
When they saw them in
the harmful position,

4452
02:11:39,830 --> 02:11:42,470
they would squawk at them
and like try to attack them.

4453
02:11:42,950 --> 02:11:44,090
And it wasn't even the person,

4454
02:11:44,091 --> 02:11:47,960
it was just the mask
they remembered faces.

4455
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:48,831
I mean,

4456
02:11:48,831 --> 02:11:49,850
it's crazy.

4457
02:11:49,851 --> 02:11:51,270
There's a lot of crows where I live.

4458
02:11:51,271 --> 02:11:51,650
They like,

4459
02:11:51,650 --> 02:11:52,380
there's like a,

4460
02:11:52,380 --> 02:11:53,480
what is that a murder of?

4461
02:11:53,620 --> 02:11:54,030
Yeah,

4462
02:11:54,030 --> 02:11:54,863
a murderer.

4463
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:56,413
That's amazing.

4464
02:11:57,220 --> 02:11:57,590
Yeah,

4465
02:11:57,590 --> 02:11:58,423
I know.

4466
02:12:02,910 --> 02:12:03,920
That's crazy.

4467
02:12:04,310 --> 02:12:04,971
They're brilliant.

4468
02:12:04,971 --> 02:12:05,761
And they use tools,

4469
02:12:05,761 --> 02:12:05,971
right?

4470
02:12:05,971 --> 02:12:06,830
And then they snowboard.

4471
02:12:06,831 --> 02:12:09,080
There's a video on youtube
of snowboarding crow,

4472
02:12:09,081 --> 02:12:10,430
which is like the best thing ever.

4473
02:12:10,650 --> 02:12:15,650
It's like it finds a little roof tile
or something carries it to the top of a

4474
02:12:15,711 --> 02:12:17,540
roof and Russia slides down.

4475
02:12:17,541 --> 02:12:18,740
It doesn't fly away,

4476
02:12:18,810 --> 02:12:20,780
decides it was fun and does it again,

4477
02:12:20,810 --> 02:12:22,130
like it does it four times in a row.

4478
02:12:22,131 --> 02:12:25,250
So it's obviously using this as a tool.

4479
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:27,050
Tend to ski or snowboard.

4480
02:12:27,051 --> 02:12:27,231
Yeah,

4481
02:12:27,231 --> 02:12:28,064
it's having fun.

4482
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:28,880
It's amazing.

4483
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:30,140
Why are they so smart?

4484
02:12:30,740 --> 02:12:30,981
Fuck.

4485
02:12:30,981 --> 02:12:31,281
Marry,

4486
02:12:31,281 --> 02:12:32,390
kill dolphin,

4487
02:12:32,710 --> 02:12:33,920
cro or bublé.

4488
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:39,793
I want to,

4489
02:12:40,820 --> 02:12:41,270
I'm gonna,

4490
02:12:41,270 --> 02:12:41,720
I'm gonna.

4491
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:42,950
I'm gonna kill him.

4492
02:12:43,340 --> 02:12:43,891
I'm gonna kill you.

4493
02:12:43,891 --> 02:12:44,390
Right?

4494
02:12:44,390 --> 02:12:45,610
I'm going to kill the crow.

4495
02:12:46,350 --> 02:12:47,183
I'm going to,

4496
02:12:48,060 --> 02:12:48,681
I want to fuck.

4497
02:12:48,681 --> 02:12:49,251
And Mary,

4498
02:12:49,251 --> 02:12:50,720
can I just fuck and Mary bublé.

4499
02:12:50,750 --> 02:12:51,050
No,

4500
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:52,280
I don't want to fuck a dolphin.

4501
02:12:52,281 --> 02:12:52,760
You Guy.

4502
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:52,911
Well,

4503
02:12:52,911 --> 02:12:54,650
you should marry the dolphin and fuck.

4504
02:12:54,651 --> 02:12:56,030
Bublé that way of blue bloods,

4505
02:12:56,060 --> 02:12:56,481
douchey.

4506
02:12:56,481 --> 02:12:59,450
You don't even have to get divorced
because you're married to a dolphin,

4507
02:12:59,451 --> 02:12:59,870
right?

4508
02:12:59,870 --> 02:13:00,201
Yeah.

4509
02:13:00,201 --> 02:13:01,034
It's no big deal.

4510
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:01,790
The Dolphin.

4511
02:13:01,790 --> 02:13:02,001
Yeah.

4512
02:13:02,001 --> 02:13:02,251
You say,

4513
02:13:02,251 --> 02:13:02,421
look,

4514
02:13:02,421 --> 02:13:02,990
I would love to marry,

4515
02:13:02,990 --> 02:13:04,760
and it's not even cheating
because it's not even a person.

4516
02:13:06,420 --> 02:13:11,180
That's how the guys who fuck horses look
at him cheating on my wife because it's

4517
02:13:11,181 --> 02:13:12,530
not a real person owning a horse.

4518
02:13:12,531 --> 02:13:13,270
Fuck me.

4519
02:13:13,270 --> 02:13:16,350
I would kill bublé fuck the
cro and marry the dolphin.

4520
02:13:16,351 --> 02:13:16,421
Yeah,

4521
02:13:16,421 --> 02:13:17,254
of course.

4522
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:17,960
Thanks.

4523
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:19,210
Thanks for your contribution.

4524
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:20,801
Really,

4525
02:13:20,801 --> 02:13:22,080
really super sweet apiece.

4526
02:13:22,150 --> 02:13:22,631
Appreciate it.

4527
02:13:22,631 --> 02:13:23,464
You're the best.

4528
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:26,680
I wanted to ask you about ambien because
that's one of the stories that's on

4529
02:13:26,681 --> 02:13:26,981
your,

4530
02:13:26,981 --> 02:13:27,250
uh,

4531
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:27,911
on your website,

4532
02:13:27,911 --> 02:13:28,320
right?

4533
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:28,471
Yeah.

4534
02:13:28,471 --> 02:13:30,120
That's up posts published on Monday.

4535
02:13:30,510 --> 02:13:32,140
Tell what the fuck

4536
02:13:32,140 --> 02:13:33,460
is going on with Ambien.

4537
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:34,211
So it's interesting.

4538
02:13:34,211 --> 02:13:34,361
You know,

4539
02:13:34,361 --> 02:13:37,510
I was talking to Arianna about
kind of like story ideas.

4540
02:13:37,710 --> 02:13:38,620
Arianna Huffington,

4541
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:40,690
how cool are you that you
could just say Ariana,

4542
02:13:40,691 --> 02:13:41,420
that's like,

4543
02:13:41,420 --> 02:13:44,620
that's like saying Elvis would
have to say the last name.

4544
02:13:44,660 --> 02:13:46,810
I'm going to Ariana and we
were just coming up with,

4545
02:13:49,210 --> 02:13:52,630
we were talking about what kinds of
things people want to hear about,

4546
02:13:52,631 --> 02:13:52,901
you know,

4547
02:13:52,901 --> 02:13:54,070
what's on a lot of people's minds.

4548
02:13:54,071 --> 02:13:55,060
It was actually her idea.

4549
02:13:55,061 --> 02:13:55,750
She was like,

4550
02:13:55,750 --> 02:14:00,130
so many people take ambien and they
sleep walk and they sleep drive and they

4551
02:14:00,131 --> 02:14:00,400
sleep,

4552
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:01,211
eat and they sleep.

4553
02:14:01,211 --> 02:14:01,571
Fuck.

4554
02:14:01,571 --> 02:14:03,820
And they wake up and they
don't remember any of it.

4555
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,860
Why does that happen?

4556
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:06,190
Yeah.

4557
02:14:06,190 --> 02:14:07,480
And so I started doing some research.

4558
02:14:07,481 --> 02:14:11,590
I talked to this doctor named Stephen
[inaudible] and he prescribes a lot of

4559
02:14:11,591 --> 02:14:12,041
ambient,

4560
02:14:12,041 --> 02:14:15,020
but he also helps people get off of
Ambien and he's asleep doctor for script.

4561
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:16,103
Bitchy

4562
02:14:19,290 --> 02:14:22,510
fucking tricky web gets
you off and he goes,

4563
02:14:22,511 --> 02:14:22,871
listen,

4564
02:14:22,871 --> 02:14:24,640
as long as you don't take it every day.

4565
02:14:24,660 --> 02:14:25,990
One that try again.

4566
02:14:26,270 --> 02:14:28,000
All the really crazy thing about Ambien,

4567
02:14:28,010 --> 02:14:29,920
it's supposed to be a
short term prescription.

4568
02:14:29,970 --> 02:14:30,160
Oh,

4569
02:14:30,160 --> 02:14:32,500
you're not supposed to take
ambien for longer than 10 days.

4570
02:14:32,710 --> 02:14:35,500
So a lot of people who have
chronic sleep problems,

4571
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:36,970
they'll take it once a week,

4572
02:14:37,190 --> 02:14:37,630
something.

4573
02:14:37,630 --> 02:14:37,721
Well,

4574
02:14:37,721 --> 02:14:41,170
it's just amazing that we live in this
culture of addiction where it's so many

4575
02:14:41,171 --> 02:14:45,700
people are addicted to cigarettes and
coffee and things that don't fuck up your

4576
02:14:45,701 --> 02:14:48,430
everyday life as far as
your functioning too much.

4577
02:14:48,700 --> 02:14:53,470
But we're completely triggered into them
and addicted to them that we would be.

4578
02:14:53,530 --> 02:14:56,110
So we would,

4579
02:14:56,140 --> 02:15:01,120
we would so readily prescribed things and
just hope the person we're prescribing

4580
02:15:01,121 --> 02:15:02,950
them to has good self control.

4581
02:15:02,970 --> 02:15:03,220
Yeah.

4582
02:15:03,220 --> 02:15:04,360
Because if they don't,

4583
02:15:04,420 --> 02:15:05,770
they're going to be physically addictive.

4584
02:15:05,771 --> 02:15:08,320
If I give you a bottle
of oxycontin and I say,

4585
02:15:08,321 --> 02:15:08,800
hey man,

4586
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:09,820
here's 30 pills.

4587
02:15:10,030 --> 02:15:11,530
Don't take more than one of them in a day.

4588
02:15:11,531 --> 02:15:11,761
And you go,

4589
02:15:11,761 --> 02:15:12,370
okay.

4590
02:15:12,370 --> 02:15:16,090
And then you just take 10 of them and
then you're fucking guns Ville and then

4591
02:15:16,091 --> 02:15:18,400
you start shaking in your
coffin and you need them.

4592
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:19,091
What did I do?

4593
02:15:19,091 --> 02:15:20,500
Did I just trust a dummy?

4594
02:15:20,620 --> 02:15:21,350
Exactly.

4595
02:15:21,350 --> 02:15:21,550
Well,

4596
02:15:21,550 --> 02:15:22,030
and you could,

4597
02:15:22,030 --> 02:15:24,460
you could have them take them water
day and they'll still get addicted.

4598
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:26,770
Oxycontin is extremely addictive.

4599
02:15:26,771 --> 02:15:27,850
Benzodiazepines,

4600
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,200
there's a reason that they say,

4601
02:15:29,290 --> 02:15:32,860
do not quit taking this medication without
speaking to your doctor because you

4602
02:15:32,861 --> 02:15:33,521
can't,

4603
02:15:33,521 --> 02:15:34,740
you'll go into withdrawal.

4604
02:15:34,990 --> 02:15:35,231
I mean,

4605
02:15:35,231 --> 02:15:36,130
if you're on Valium,

4606
02:15:36,131 --> 02:15:36,581
Xanax,

4607
02:15:36,581 --> 02:15:37,960
you can have grand mal seizures.

4608
02:15:37,961 --> 02:15:39,130
When you try to get off of it,

4609
02:15:39,131 --> 02:15:40,840
you have back spasms.

4610
02:15:40,841 --> 02:15:41,610
I mean it's,

4611
02:15:41,610 --> 02:15:42,443
you can die.

4612
02:15:42,810 --> 02:15:43,291
You know,

4613
02:15:43,291 --> 02:15:43,501
you,

4614
02:15:43,501 --> 02:15:43,681
you're,

4615
02:15:43,681 --> 02:15:47,460
the pain is so bad that we have to give
you this and we have to take the risk.

4616
02:15:47,510 --> 02:15:47,760
Yeah.

4617
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:48,750
We have to take the risk.

4618
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:49,260
Yeah.

4619
02:15:49,260 --> 02:15:49,861
Is that,

4620
02:15:49,861 --> 02:15:50,694
that seems

4621
02:15:50,820 --> 02:15:51,780
what it is for everybody.

4622
02:15:51,781 --> 02:15:52,061
It's,

4623
02:15:52,061 --> 02:15:53,010
it's all about the risk.

4624
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:54,810
You know the people who take Ambien,

4625
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:59,130
the reason they continue to take it is
because they're weighing the risk against

4626
02:15:59,131 --> 02:15:59,964
the benefits.

4627
02:16:00,090 --> 02:16:03,000
They know there's a risk that they're
going to fucking walk out into traffic.

4628
02:16:03,390 --> 02:16:03,721
They know.

4629
02:16:03,721 --> 02:16:04,231
I know.

4630
02:16:04,231 --> 02:16:05,520
They know that you know,

4631
02:16:05,521 --> 02:16:10,320
but their lives are so destroyed by
not sleeping that it does help them.

4632
02:16:10,410 --> 02:16:10,741
You know?

4633
02:16:10,741 --> 02:16:13,350
It actually bothers me because I did
this piece and all these people are like,

4634
02:16:13,351 --> 02:16:15,690
Oh yeah what pharmaceutical
company paid you to?

4635
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:18,510
Or like you know or this
is so anti big pharma.

4636
02:16:18,511 --> 02:16:20,880
Everybody thinks that you have
an agenda when you write science,

4637
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:24,150
but really I'm just trying to look at the
available evidence and write about it.

4638
02:16:24,151 --> 02:16:27,780
A lot of the available evidence when
I looked into ambien showed that it's

4639
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:29,140
risky.

4640
02:16:29,140 --> 02:16:30,430
It's really risky

4641
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:31,120
a drug,

4642
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:33,190
but it does help people.

4643
02:16:33,490 --> 02:16:35,230
You know there's always two sides,

4644
02:16:35,380 --> 02:16:36,310
two sides of that coin.

4645
02:16:36,370 --> 02:16:37,540
That's the real issue isn't there?

4646
02:16:37,541 --> 02:16:41,860
It looks like for some people if you have
good self control you can use it as a

4647
02:16:41,861 --> 02:16:42,400
tool.

4648
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:45,460
But the issue is that there's a lot of
people who do not have good self control.

4649
02:16:45,461 --> 02:16:46,294
What should we do?

4650
02:16:46,330 --> 02:16:48,490
Should we make things
completely unavailable?

4651
02:16:48,491 --> 02:16:50,890
And that comes to the Chagrin of
personal freedom when it comes to yeah.

4652
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,740
Or should we make it completely available?

4653
02:16:52,860 --> 02:16:53,310
When I,

4654
02:16:53,310 --> 02:16:57,480
when I'm talking about ecstasy and acid
and GHB and all these things that I've

4655
02:16:57,481 --> 02:16:58,020
done,

4656
02:16:58,020 --> 02:17:01,210
I had so much control back when
I was doing drugs cause I'm,

4657
02:17:01,211 --> 02:17:05,400
I'm a pretty kind of paranoid person
and I don't drink because I never liked

4658
02:17:05,401 --> 02:17:06,181
feeling drunk.

4659
02:17:06,181 --> 02:17:07,450
I don't like feeling out of control.

4660
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:08,081
You're paranoid,

4661
02:17:08,081 --> 02:17:09,730
but you do an ecstasy
and Ghb at the same time.

4662
02:17:10,030 --> 02:17:10,611
Exactly.

4663
02:17:10,611 --> 02:17:14,330
That was my dumbest move there and
I never did GHB again after that.

4664
02:17:14,331 --> 02:17:15,710
And I've only done ecstasy.

4665
02:17:15,711 --> 02:17:16,790
Maybe like I say,

4666
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:19,430
only be like 10 times I've done acid,

4667
02:17:19,431 --> 02:17:20,390
maybe like five times.

4668
02:17:20,391 --> 02:17:21,620
But I would definitely,

4669
02:17:21,621 --> 02:17:23,180
when I look back at my drug history,

4670
02:17:23,240 --> 02:17:24,830
I experimented with drugs.

4671
02:17:25,100 --> 02:17:27,620
I would never became addicted
to any drug I ever did.

4672
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:28,211
Yeah.

4673
02:17:28,211 --> 02:17:30,670
I've never fucked with anything
that's completely addictive.

4674
02:17:30,671 --> 02:17:32,830
I've never tried heroin and
we're trying to earn her.

4675
02:17:32,831 --> 02:17:33,190
Yeah.

4676
02:17:33,190 --> 02:17:34,840
The coat are the ones that are,

4677
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:37,630
I just saw too many people
just lose everything.

4678
02:17:37,670 --> 02:17:38,030
Exactly.

4679
02:17:38,030 --> 02:17:38,410
And,

4680
02:17:38,410 --> 02:17:39,970
and still to this day more,

4681
02:17:39,971 --> 02:17:44,590
I've seen more people over the last
decade or so fall apart because the pills

4682
02:17:44,591 --> 02:17:45,270
than anything.

4683
02:17:45,270 --> 02:17:45,600
Yeah.

4684
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:48,450
And I played with pills for a little
bit because I like to downers.

4685
02:17:48,451 --> 02:17:51,330
I liked drugs that I could have
fun on and then go to sleep on.

4686
02:17:51,510 --> 02:17:54,000
And the problem with things
like Xanax for example,

4687
02:17:54,001 --> 02:17:56,250
which I really liked back in the day,

4688
02:17:56,460 --> 02:17:59,400
is that for somebody who actually
does have a little bit of anxiety,

4689
02:17:59,550 --> 02:18:02,900
you take a dose of Xanax that's maybe
a little higher than you're supposed to

4690
02:18:03,180 --> 02:18:04,920
and you feel so good,

4691
02:18:04,921 --> 02:18:06,780
but you also feel so sober,

4692
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:10,410
like you're fucked up in that you feel
more sober than you've ever felt in your

4693
02:18:10,411 --> 02:18:11,070
life.

4694
02:18:11,070 --> 02:18:12,630
And so you're talkative,

4695
02:18:12,631 --> 02:18:13,411
you're warm,

4696
02:18:13,411 --> 02:18:14,280
you're emotional,

4697
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:16,980
but then you can go to sleep
at night because it's a downer.

4698
02:18:16,981 --> 02:18:17,311
I mean,

4699
02:18:17,311 --> 02:18:19,170
it's very easy to sleep on these drugs.

4700
02:18:19,350 --> 02:18:20,370
You wake up refreshed,

4701
02:18:20,371 --> 02:18:22,260
you don't feel like you were
doing drugs the night before,

4702
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:24,420
you don't fucking remember
anything that happened.

4703
02:18:24,930 --> 02:18:27,660
I mean it's the same reason that
people probably abused ambien.

4704
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:29,220
You feel good when you're on it.

4705
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:31,230
So Xanax makes you feel sober.

4706
02:18:31,350 --> 02:18:32,610
I it made me feel sober.

4707
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:33,211
Definitely.

4708
02:18:33,211 --> 02:18:34,590
So do you normally feel high?

4709
02:18:34,770 --> 02:18:35,131
No,

4710
02:18:35,131 --> 02:18:38,970
I think it's that people who are anxious
maybe have a little bit of an edge all

4711
02:18:38,971 --> 02:18:39,511
the time,

4712
02:18:39,511 --> 02:18:39,870
you know,

4713
02:18:39,870 --> 02:18:40,740
maybe a little stress.

4714
02:18:40,890 --> 02:18:42,630
And I also struggle a lot with depression.

4715
02:18:42,631 --> 02:18:43,920
So I actually do medicate.

4716
02:18:43,921 --> 02:18:45,600
I take an antidepressant every day.

4717
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:48,930
I take a very low dose of Selectsa
and I know that I need it.

4718
02:18:48,931 --> 02:18:50,250
I know what I'm like when I'm on it.

4719
02:18:50,251 --> 02:18:51,750
I know what I'm like when I'm off of it.

4720
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:56,160
I know that my brain chemistry is such
that a mild selective Serotonin reuptake

4721
02:18:56,161 --> 02:19:01,161
inhibitor helps me prevent
having major depressive episodes.

4722
02:19:01,281 --> 02:19:02,670
It helps me be functional.

4723
02:19:02,880 --> 02:19:07,880
And so now I am taking something that's
a daily maintenance kind of thing.

4724
02:19:07,921 --> 02:19:08,880
But back in the day,

4725
02:19:08,881 --> 02:19:12,540
I think that a lot of my experiments or
drugs were attempts to self medicate.

4726
02:19:12,810 --> 02:19:15,870
And when I would take
something like Xanax or Valium,

4727
02:19:16,230 --> 02:19:17,130
I felt sober.

4728
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:17,671
Did you try?

4729
02:19:17,671 --> 02:19:21,960
Have you tried anything like five HTP or
have you tried any natural thing weighs

4730
02:19:21,961 --> 02:19:22,200
or,

4731
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:22,831
yeah,

4732
02:19:22,831 --> 02:19:23,221
I mean,

4733
02:19:23,221 --> 02:19:26,610
and I think that for some people it's
a difference between talking about just

4734
02:19:26,611 --> 02:19:29,090
kind of your mood when you're
having a tough day and,

4735
02:19:29,091 --> 02:19:31,380
and treating clinical depression.

4736
02:19:31,410 --> 02:19:31,591
Yeah,

4737
02:19:31,591 --> 02:19:32,424
exactly.

4738
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:35,440
Something that you feel runs
in your family's genetic.

4739
02:19:35,810 --> 02:19:36,440
Yes,

4740
02:19:36,440 --> 02:19:37,920
and I've dealt with it
since I was a child,

4741
02:19:37,940 --> 02:19:38,111
you know,

4742
02:19:38,111 --> 02:19:41,630
so actually it was only last year that I
started taking meds for the first time.

4743
02:19:41,780 --> 02:19:45,440
My whole life I've been in therapy and
I've tried to work really hard to not

4744
02:19:45,441 --> 02:19:46,700
have to take medication.

4745
02:19:46,910 --> 02:19:50,960
And sometimes I think it takes somebody
kind of hitting a bottom or going to a

4746
02:19:50,961 --> 02:19:51,410
place.

4747
02:19:51,410 --> 02:19:54,650
It's the same thing with people who
actually abused drugs and finally need to

4748
02:19:54,651 --> 02:19:55,484
get off of him.

4749
02:19:55,640 --> 02:19:57,110
They go to a place where they go,

4750
02:19:57,111 --> 02:19:58,880
I don't ever fucking
want to go there again.

4751
02:19:58,881 --> 02:19:59,191
And,

4752
02:19:59,191 --> 02:20:00,170
and that tells them,

4753
02:20:00,171 --> 02:20:00,441
okay,

4754
02:20:00,441 --> 02:20:01,520
I need to go into Rehab.

4755
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:02,473
For me,

4756
02:20:02,810 --> 02:20:05,240
my antidepressants were
kind of my rehab from,

4757
02:20:05,270 --> 02:20:07,700
from my fucking brain.

4758
02:20:07,730 --> 02:20:08,001
You know,

4759
02:20:08,001 --> 02:20:08,420
my brain,

4760
02:20:08,420 --> 02:20:12,140
I know that I have clinical depression
and I know that it's a biological

4761
02:20:12,141 --> 02:20:12,974
illness.

4762
02:20:13,010 --> 02:20:13,281
You know,

4763
02:20:13,281 --> 02:20:16,520
mental illness has a foundational,

4764
02:20:16,550 --> 02:20:17,010
um,

4765
02:20:17,010 --> 02:20:17,510
um,

4766
02:20:17,510 --> 02:20:19,040
route in your biology.

4767
02:20:19,310 --> 02:20:23,210
And so I've done the intervention
with talk therapy my entire life.

4768
02:20:23,211 --> 02:20:24,070
I continue to do it.

4769
02:20:24,071 --> 02:20:25,490
It wasn't enough for me,

4770
02:20:25,670 --> 02:20:25,941
you know,

4771
02:20:25,941 --> 02:20:26,810
but I tried it for many,

4772
02:20:26,811 --> 02:20:30,560
many years and I think that I just
convinced myself that I would be okay.

4773
02:20:30,561 --> 02:20:33,350
But after enough bad behavior and after
heard and kind of myself and enough

4774
02:20:33,351 --> 02:20:34,011
people in my life,

4775
02:20:34,011 --> 02:20:36,920
I finally decided this is something
that's important for me to do.

4776
02:20:36,921 --> 02:20:41,390
And now I really advocate for kind of
trying to erase the stigma with mental

4777
02:20:41,391 --> 02:20:41,661
illness,

4778
02:20:41,661 --> 02:20:42,351
trying to be as open.

4779
02:20:42,351 --> 02:20:43,011
It's not easy,

4780
02:20:43,011 --> 02:20:44,870
but trying to be as
open about it as I can.

4781
02:20:45,050 --> 02:20:49,250
So many people struggle with it and it's
one of those things almost like obesity

4782
02:20:49,251 --> 02:20:52,580
that we see in this country where
there's a fair amount of people,

4783
02:20:52,610 --> 02:20:53,121
for example,

4784
02:20:53,121 --> 02:20:54,590
who eat like shit and they're fat.

4785
02:20:54,980 --> 02:20:59,210
And then there's some people who are
morbidly clinically obese that have

4786
02:20:59,211 --> 02:21:00,560
something wrong with them.

4787
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:00,831
You know,

4788
02:21:00,831 --> 02:21:01,490
like,

4789
02:21:01,490 --> 02:21:05,090
like nobody gets to be 600 pounds without
some sort of like mental illness or

4790
02:21:05,091 --> 02:21:05,924
without some sort of,

4791
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:06,530
um,

4792
02:21:06,530 --> 02:21:08,180
by biochemical problem.

4793
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:09,051
And I think for,

4794
02:21:09,051 --> 02:21:09,884
for um,

4795
02:21:09,890 --> 02:21:11,390
mental illness it's
the same kind of thing.

4796
02:21:11,391 --> 02:21:12,530
There are people who,

4797
02:21:12,710 --> 02:21:16,040
who can kind of work through it with a
lot of talk therapy and there are people

4798
02:21:16,041 --> 02:21:17,690
who have such a difficulty,

4799
02:21:17,691 --> 02:21:21,950
such a kind of biochemical difficulty
where they need medical intervention.

4800
02:21:21,951 --> 02:21:25,730
And I would love to see it if we could
start changing public perception about

4801
02:21:25,731 --> 02:21:26,810
mental illness to look at it.

4802
02:21:26,811 --> 02:21:27,260
Just like,

4803
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:27,561
you know,

4804
02:21:27,561 --> 02:21:28,670
somebody has diabetes,

4805
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:30,860
they have to fucking take
insulin and nobody goes,

4806
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:31,251
oh,

4807
02:21:31,251 --> 02:21:33,140
you're just not thinking
positively enough.

4808
02:21:33,141 --> 02:21:35,540
If you just think more positively
yourselves can take in sugar.

4809
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:40,400
Well it's always ignorant when anybody
tries to explain to you what's going on

4810
02:21:40,401 --> 02:21:42,110
with your consciousness or your body.

4811
02:21:42,340 --> 02:21:43,070
It's crazy.

4812
02:21:43,070 --> 02:21:43,341
And it's,

4813
02:21:43,341 --> 02:21:46,640
one is things that people do because
they don't like to see excuses in

4814
02:21:46,641 --> 02:21:47,474
themselves,

4815
02:21:47,530 --> 02:21:48,320
try to squash it.

4816
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:48,801
They do.

4817
02:21:48,801 --> 02:21:49,371
And other people.

4818
02:21:49,371 --> 02:21:50,121
And what I say,

4819
02:21:50,121 --> 02:21:53,900
I actually did a piece a long time ago
about depression where I talk about it.

4820
02:21:53,901 --> 02:21:54,171
I was like,

4821
02:21:54,171 --> 02:21:56,540
I have studied this from a
neuroscientific perspective,

4822
02:21:56,690 --> 02:21:59,720
but I also know what I'm talking
about because I suffer from it myself.

4823
02:21:59,900 --> 02:22:01,490
And this is what I've done,

4824
02:22:01,670 --> 02:22:05,150
and I urge anybody who needs
help to get help or whatever.

4825
02:22:05,151 --> 02:22:07,460
But I talk about the
biochemistry and I talk about,

4826
02:22:07,490 --> 02:22:08,180
you know,

4827
02:22:08,180 --> 02:22:10,520
some of the kind of biological
causes of depression.

4828
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:12,800
But one of the things that
I say in the video is like,

4829
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:16,370
I'm so sick of people who will come
into comment boards and be like,

4830
02:22:16,400 --> 02:22:16,881
Oh,

4831
02:22:16,881 --> 02:22:17,151
you know,

4832
02:22:17,151 --> 02:22:18,860
just fucking buck up or whatever.

4833
02:22:18,861 --> 02:22:19,101
I'm like,

4834
02:22:19,101 --> 02:22:19,820
you know what?

4835
02:22:19,820 --> 02:22:21,590
I fucking want to be depressed.

4836
02:22:21,591 --> 02:22:23,540
Trust me if I can just
will myself out of this.

4837
02:22:23,570 --> 02:22:24,403
I would,

4838
02:22:24,470 --> 02:22:28,020
because whatever kind of pain it causes
you to watch somebody who's depressed,

4839
02:22:28,021 --> 02:22:28,231
bitch,

4840
02:22:28,231 --> 02:22:29,400
and Moan or cry.

4841
02:22:29,880 --> 02:22:30,271
If you,

4842
02:22:30,271 --> 02:22:32,820
if you've known somebody in your life
who suffers from depression and most

4843
02:22:32,821 --> 02:22:33,271
people do,

4844
02:22:33,271 --> 02:22:36,810
and if you've been there for them through
a depressive episode and it hurts you

4845
02:22:36,990 --> 02:22:38,550
to see how much pain they're in,

4846
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:41,670
the pain that they're in is
worse than however much it hurts.

4847
02:22:41,671 --> 02:22:42,000
You.

4848
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:42,810
Trust me,

4849
02:22:42,810 --> 02:22:44,040
they don't want to be going through it.

4850
02:22:44,260 --> 02:22:47,310
It's the same argument I say for people
who are fucking pro life when they're

4851
02:22:47,311 --> 02:22:47,431
like,

4852
02:22:47,431 --> 02:22:47,611
yeah,

4853
02:22:47,611 --> 02:22:48,331
fucking abortion.

4854
02:22:48,331 --> 02:22:48,481
I'm like,

4855
02:22:48,481 --> 02:22:51,420
you think anybody wants to
have a fucking abortion?

4856
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:52,320
No,

4857
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:53,131
nobody's out there going,

4858
02:22:53,131 --> 02:22:56,010
I want to get knocked up so that
I can kill the fetus inside of me.

4859
02:22:56,040 --> 02:22:56,940
Of course not.

4860
02:22:57,090 --> 02:23:00,900
They want the option if there's
a worst case scenario situation.

4861
02:23:00,950 --> 02:23:02,170
So you feel like,

4862
02:23:02,171 --> 02:23:02,650
um,

4863
02:23:02,650 --> 02:23:07,040
this is a universal situation
that all people that,

4864
02:23:07,070 --> 02:23:07,820
uh,

4865
02:23:07,820 --> 02:23:08,240
have,

4866
02:23:08,240 --> 02:23:10,010
that suffer from clinical depression,

4867
02:23:10,011 --> 02:23:13,310
that it's just some sort of an inbounds
and the chemicals that your brain,

4868
02:23:13,311 --> 02:23:14,000
your body,

4869
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:14,833
I wouldn't say it's adjust.

4870
02:23:14,840 --> 02:23:18,920
I think that that the nature
nurture argument has to
come into play because this

4871
02:23:18,921 --> 02:23:19,191
is the,

4872
02:23:19,191 --> 02:23:22,220
this is the problem with neuroplasticity.

4873
02:23:22,221 --> 02:23:22,791
It's a problem.

4874
02:23:22,791 --> 02:23:23,624
And the perk.

4875
02:23:23,780 --> 02:23:25,520
If you have,

4876
02:23:25,550 --> 02:23:26,350
um,

4877
02:23:26,350 --> 02:23:26,540
uh,

4878
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:31,400
let's say lower than normal levels of
serotonin or dopamine or norepinephrine or

4879
02:23:31,401 --> 02:23:34,610
whatever the combination is that
causes your specific depression,

4880
02:23:34,940 --> 02:23:36,920
if you have lower than
normal levels of that,

4881
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:37,410
it's,

4882
02:23:37,410 --> 02:23:38,480
it's going to cause a lot of,

4883
02:23:38,690 --> 02:23:40,880
or it's going to contribute to
a lot of depressive thoughts.

4884
02:23:40,881 --> 02:23:43,280
Say that you have a lot of environmental
things that happened in your life.

4885
02:23:43,281 --> 02:23:46,940
You had a difficult childhood or you
experience trauma or whatever the case may

4886
02:23:46,941 --> 02:23:48,680
be combined with this,

4887
02:23:48,890 --> 02:23:50,690
the patterns in your brain,

4888
02:23:50,691 --> 02:23:55,691
the actual networks in your brain are
going to be reinforced in these depressive

4889
02:23:56,450 --> 02:23:57,140
ways.

4890
02:23:57,140 --> 02:23:58,910
So you immediately have a thought,

4891
02:23:58,911 --> 02:23:59,511
for example,

4892
02:23:59,511 --> 02:24:01,160
and you might go dark on that thought.

4893
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:04,730
You might look at something as a glass
half empty kind of way instead of a glass

4894
02:24:04,731 --> 02:24:05,300
half full way.

4895
02:24:05,300 --> 02:24:07,610
And then what you're doing
is you're reinforcing these.

4896
02:24:07,730 --> 02:24:11,090
So talk therapy can actually help you
form new neural networks to come out of

4897
02:24:11,091 --> 02:24:11,450
it.

4898
02:24:11,450 --> 02:24:14,090
But sometimes that's not enough for some
people because there's still a strong

4899
02:24:14,091 --> 02:24:15,380
biochemical basis.

4900
02:24:15,470 --> 02:24:16,550
So they may need both.

4901
02:24:16,551 --> 02:24:20,720
But I definitely think that drugs are
never the answer without some form of

4902
02:24:20,721 --> 02:24:21,380
therapy.

4903
02:24:21,380 --> 02:24:25,400
You've got to work through
your day to day issues too.

4904
02:24:25,401 --> 02:24:28,430
You've got to have some sort of cognitive
behavioral intervention so that you

4905
02:24:28,431 --> 02:24:33,050
can learn how to cope with
the difficulties of life
because everybody has a lot

4906
02:24:33,051 --> 02:24:35,420
of difficulties in life and
people who have mental illness,

4907
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:37,580
it's just that much harder
to get through the day.

4908
02:24:37,581 --> 02:24:41,060
It's that much harder to have
a relationship with your job.

4909
02:24:41,190 --> 02:24:42,590
What's the debate and the one,

4910
02:24:42,610 --> 02:24:42,920
the,

4911
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:43,250
in the,

4912
02:24:43,250 --> 02:24:44,580
in the buck up department,

4913
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:45,750
the debate is,

4914
02:24:45,890 --> 02:24:46,071
I mean,

4915
02:24:46,071 --> 02:24:47,420
I don't think it's a legitimate debate.

4916
02:24:47,470 --> 02:24:47,780
Not,

4917
02:24:47,780 --> 02:24:48,231
it's not.

4918
02:24:48,231 --> 02:24:48,930
It's trolling,

4919
02:24:48,930 --> 02:24:49,051
but,

4920
02:24:49,051 --> 02:24:49,311
well,

4921
02:24:49,311 --> 02:24:54,311
it seems like though that before you try
any sort of chemical intervention into

4922
02:24:55,191 --> 02:24:56,001
your consciousness,

4923
02:24:56,001 --> 02:24:57,890
you should definitely try
to get your health in order.

4924
02:24:57,980 --> 02:24:58,641
I think you should.

4925
02:24:58,641 --> 02:25:00,080
And I think that it also depends on,

4926
02:25:00,081 --> 02:25:01,280
on where you are in the spectrum.

4927
02:25:01,281 --> 02:25:04,730
Obviously somebody who is severely
schizophrenia who is having,

4928
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:05,030
um,

4929
02:25:05,030 --> 02:25:07,430
a schizophrenia episode
who is out on the streets.

4930
02:25:07,431 --> 02:25:07,611
You know,

4931
02:25:07,611 --> 02:25:09,770
you see some of these homeless people
who are out on the streets and they're

4932
02:25:09,771 --> 02:25:10,610
talking to themselves.

4933
02:25:10,850 --> 02:25:14,630
That person needs how tall that person
needs medical intervention quickly.

4934
02:25:14,780 --> 02:25:18,380
Sometimes the medical intervention has
to come first so that all of the other

4935
02:25:18,381 --> 02:25:20,420
stuff can take place
because they're that ill.

4936
02:25:20,690 --> 02:25:21,471
Other times,

4937
02:25:21,471 --> 02:25:22,820
if we're talking about generalized,

4938
02:25:23,810 --> 02:25:26,120
if we're talking about
certain levels of depression,

4939
02:25:26,240 --> 02:25:28,490
it may be the case that
getting your diet in order,

4940
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:30,740
talking through some of
your relationship issues,

4941
02:25:30,741 --> 02:25:33,170
your work issues and all
those things can exacerbate.

4942
02:25:33,170 --> 02:25:35,000
Then you'll actually
kind of be able to tell,

4943
02:25:35,330 --> 02:25:36,020
you know,

4944
02:25:36,020 --> 02:25:38,090
a lot of things are going well in my life.

4945
02:25:38,091 --> 02:25:38,960
I'm feeling really good,

4946
02:25:38,961 --> 02:25:42,440
but I still just have these days where
I start fucking crying for no reason and

4947
02:25:42,441 --> 02:25:42,860
I,

4948
02:25:42,860 --> 02:25:44,630
and I'm thinking about
ending it all and it's like,

4949
02:25:44,631 --> 02:25:44,781
well,

4950
02:25:44,781 --> 02:25:45,770
where's that coming from?

4951
02:25:45,771 --> 02:25:46,221
You know what I mean?

4952
02:25:46,221 --> 02:25:49,310
That might be something that we need to
talk about and try and have intervention

4953
02:25:49,311 --> 02:25:49,690
with.

4954
02:25:49,690 --> 02:25:49,930
But,

4955
02:25:49,930 --> 02:25:52,130
but somebody who is bipolar for example,

4956
02:25:52,460 --> 02:25:56,690
they're not going to be able to work
on getting healthy because there are so

4957
02:25:56,691 --> 02:25:57,710
mentally ill,

4958
02:25:57,860 --> 02:26:02,600
they're brain is so ill that it's going
to induce certain behaviors that are

4959
02:26:02,690 --> 02:26:03,920
counter to their health.

4960
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:05,780
So being able to get on,

4961
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:06,410
um,

4962
02:26:06,410 --> 02:26:08,150
on the lithium for example,

4963
02:26:08,151 --> 02:26:09,890
to kind of tamp some of the,

4964
02:26:09,891 --> 02:26:10,280
um,

4965
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:11,270
manic behaviors,

4966
02:26:11,271 --> 02:26:14,120
like having unprotected
sex or going out and do,

4967
02:26:14,121 --> 02:26:14,390
you know,

4968
02:26:14,390 --> 02:26:15,560
binge drinking or whatever.

4969
02:26:15,580 --> 02:26:15,690
Yeah.

4970
02:26:15,690 --> 02:26:16,523
That pitch

4971
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:17,741
she's talking about,

4972
02:26:17,741 --> 02:26:18,574
you know,

4973
02:26:19,060 --> 02:26:19,891
really what,

4974
02:26:19,891 --> 02:26:20,950
where did this come from?

4975
02:26:20,951 --> 02:26:22,080
I want to hear a backstory now.

4976
02:26:22,090 --> 02:26:22,820
Okay.

4977
02:26:22,820 --> 02:26:24,040
I just hang out at a comedy club.

4978
02:26:25,700 --> 02:26:27,690
It's getting late at comedy clubs,

4979
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:30,310
just being a silly,

4980
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:30,940
um,

4981
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:31,331
but yeah,

4982
02:26:31,331 --> 02:26:32,060
I mean those people,

4983
02:26:32,060 --> 02:26:33,320
they may need medical interview.

4984
02:26:33,321 --> 02:26:33,510
Yeah.

4985
02:26:33,510 --> 02:26:33,991
When you,

4986
02:26:33,991 --> 02:26:38,100
when you talked about doing Xanax and
having that feeling that you were sober,

4987
02:26:38,160 --> 02:26:38,580
yeah.

4988
02:26:38,580 --> 02:26:41,040
Wouldn't you think that would be like
the ideal state of consciousness?

4989
02:26:41,041 --> 02:26:44,610
Have you ever tried to reengineer that
and find what the right mixture is to get

4990
02:26:44,611 --> 02:26:46,850
hit that ideal state of
consciousness all the time?

4991
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:51,020
Just so paranoid now about
altering my consciousness through,

4992
02:26:51,260 --> 02:26:51,890
um,

4993
02:26:51,890 --> 02:26:54,750
through drugs that it's like I,

4994
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:56,810
I'm finally at a place in
my life where I'm pretty,

4995
02:26:56,811 --> 02:26:58,130
pretty stable and I'd really,

4996
02:26:58,131 --> 02:26:58,231
I,

4997
02:26:58,231 --> 02:26:58,550
I,

4998
02:26:58,550 --> 02:26:59,480
I know that I take,

4999
02:26:59,540 --> 02:27:00,170
um,

5000
02:27:00,170 --> 02:27:05,170
I take this Alexa every day and I are the
subtle a pram and I like the dose that

5001
02:27:05,841 --> 02:27:06,920
I'm on for example.

5002
02:27:06,921 --> 02:27:09,740
And I know that I'm in a room full of
men and probably most of the people that

5003
02:27:09,741 --> 02:27:09,870
are

5004
02:27:09,870 --> 02:27:11,900
listening right now or just one man here,

5005
02:27:13,160 --> 02:27:13,993
but so dudes

5006
02:27:14,190 --> 02:27:15,090
ears while I say this,

5007
02:27:15,091 --> 02:27:18,540
but I talked to my shrink sometimes
about the fact that like one time a month

5008
02:27:18,541 --> 02:27:19,140
for example,

5009
02:27:19,140 --> 02:27:22,800
I get a lot more emotional and she says
you can up your dose during that week.

5010
02:27:23,130 --> 02:27:25,440
I personally don't want to
up my dose during that week.

5011
02:27:25,470 --> 02:27:26,760
I don't like the way that I feel,

5012
02:27:26,761 --> 02:27:29,670
but I also don't want to just
medicate that out of myself.

5013
02:27:29,730 --> 02:27:33,720
I'm on the right dose right now that I
can still cry if something sad happens,

5014
02:27:33,721 --> 02:27:34,440
I still cry.

5015
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:35,100
I'm not,

5016
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:35,851
I'm not a Zombie.

5017
02:27:35,851 --> 02:27:37,070
I'm not numb to my emotions.

5018
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:42,320
I found the right level so that I don't
always just cry for no reason and a or

5019
02:27:42,441 --> 02:27:45,240
so that I don't have like
a major depressive episode
that I feel like I'm never

5020
02:27:45,241 --> 02:27:47,340
going to get out of because that I think,

5021
02:27:47,820 --> 02:27:49,050
I can't speak for anybody else,

5022
02:27:49,051 --> 02:27:49,920
but for myself,

5023
02:27:49,921 --> 02:27:54,810
the way that my depressive episodes
worked or they happen was just like if

5024
02:27:54,811 --> 02:27:58,800
you've ever taken acid or you've been on
a drug at a certain point you're like,

5025
02:27:58,830 --> 02:28:00,180
this is never going to stop.

5026
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:01,380
And it kind of sucks.

5027
02:28:01,381 --> 02:28:02,220
Like you kind of have this,

5028
02:28:02,250 --> 02:28:05,730
this fear like is this ever going to
go away or is this what I'm like now?

5029
02:28:05,910 --> 02:28:08,670
And that's how it would feel to me
when I'd go into a depressive episode.

5030
02:28:08,671 --> 02:28:10,590
It's like I'm so sad and I'm,

5031
02:28:10,830 --> 02:28:11,663
I'm crying,

5032
02:28:11,700 --> 02:28:14,160
I'm so low and I don't think I'm
ever going to come out of it.

5033
02:28:14,370 --> 02:28:16,350
And that's when I think for some people,

5034
02:28:16,351 --> 02:28:19,860
you know bad things like suicidal
thoughts or ideations to play.

5035
02:28:19,890 --> 02:28:21,210
When those guys run,

5036
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:22,841
we run like the wind.

5037
02:28:22,841 --> 02:28:22,980
Yeah.

5038
02:28:22,980 --> 02:28:23,330
All right.

5039
02:28:23,330 --> 02:28:23,770
All right.

5040
02:28:23,770 --> 02:28:25,160
Typically you're crying for no reason.

5041
02:28:25,440 --> 02:28:26,030
And Girls,

5042
02:28:26,030 --> 02:28:26,511
Oh man,

5043
02:28:26,511 --> 02:28:27,344
we cry for no,

5044
02:28:28,260 --> 02:28:29,240
are you that?

5045
02:28:29,270 --> 02:28:29,721
That's good.

5046
02:28:29,721 --> 02:28:31,420
That's a better crying for no reason.

5047
02:28:31,421 --> 02:28:32,600
It's a hard one for no reason.

5048
02:28:32,601 --> 02:28:32,961
It's a hard one.

5049
02:28:32,961 --> 02:28:34,250
So I'm going to give you a word of advice.

5050
02:28:34,251 --> 02:28:35,420
All you guys who are listening,

5051
02:28:35,660 --> 02:28:37,070
no matter what she says,

5052
02:28:37,160 --> 02:28:39,410
if she starts crying for no
reason and she can't figure out,

5053
02:28:39,411 --> 02:28:40,011
and she and you go,

5054
02:28:40,011 --> 02:28:40,641
but do you want this?

5055
02:28:40,641 --> 02:28:41,480
You know,

5056
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:41,800
get her.

5057
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:42,410
What do you want this?

5058
02:28:42,410 --> 02:28:42,950
No.

5059
02:28:42,950 --> 02:28:45,350
Now what you need to do is you just
need to put your arms around her.

5060
02:28:45,530 --> 02:28:46,600
Really just put your eye.

5061
02:28:46,630 --> 02:28:47,780
Even if she tries to push you away,

5062
02:28:48,020 --> 02:28:49,380
just put your arms around their,

5063
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:49,850
push you away.

5064
02:28:49,850 --> 02:28:51,020
Don't you advocating rape?

5065
02:28:51,100 --> 02:28:51,241
No,

5066
02:28:51,241 --> 02:28:51,321
no,

5067
02:28:51,321 --> 02:28:51,560
no.

5068
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:52,640
Don't try to have sex with her.

5069
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:53,960
Don't try to kiss her.

5070
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:54,710
Don't.

5071
02:28:54,710 --> 02:28:59,510
There's such a difference between sexual
intimacy and emotional kind of almost

5072
02:28:59,511 --> 02:29:00,540
paternal intimacy.

5073
02:29:00,550 --> 02:29:01,830
Now you're just talking crazy.

5074
02:29:01,831 --> 02:29:06,310
You just put your arms around her
advice of your life right now girls.

5075
02:29:06,350 --> 02:29:09,770
Exactly like that knife had to
do that exact same and it works,

5076
02:29:09,771 --> 02:29:10,310
right?

5077
02:29:10,310 --> 02:29:10,791
It works.

5078
02:29:10,791 --> 02:29:11,481
You'll freak out,

5079
02:29:11,481 --> 02:29:11,871
but you just have,

5080
02:29:11,871 --> 02:29:13,370
everybody wants to be hugged and then,

5081
02:29:13,371 --> 02:29:15,210
and then she will calm down because she,

5082
02:29:15,260 --> 02:29:20,240
what she needs is to feel like you don't
think she's crazy and no matter what,

5083
02:29:20,241 --> 02:29:22,360
you still love her and
she'll get through it.

5084
02:29:22,490 --> 02:29:24,230
You are supporting crazy behavior.

5085
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:28,620
Tell that bitch to get
her shit together and no,

5086
02:29:28,621 --> 02:29:28,771
no,

5087
02:29:28,771 --> 02:29:28,951
no,

5088
02:29:28,951 --> 02:29:29,161
no,

5089
02:29:29,161 --> 02:29:29,760
no.

5090
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:31,830
Go to the bar and drink with your friends.

5091
02:29:32,910 --> 02:29:33,920
Listen to Joe.

5092
02:29:33,930 --> 02:29:34,790
Whatever you do,

5093
02:29:36,210 --> 02:29:37,410
I want you to get in your car.

5094
02:29:37,411 --> 02:29:39,450
I want you to put sweet home Alabama.

5095
02:29:40,500 --> 02:29:43,410
Crank that shit and just drive,

5096
02:29:43,411 --> 02:29:43,801
man.

5097
02:29:43,801 --> 02:29:44,760
Just get away.

5098
02:29:45,020 --> 02:29:45,661
This is not,

5099
02:29:45,661 --> 02:29:49,140
you guys want to stay single problem.

5100
02:29:49,380 --> 02:29:49,800
Listen,

5101
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:53,160
there are certain tasks that
you do not want to take in life.

5102
02:29:53,250 --> 02:29:55,620
This is a guy who was making a
fucking monument to crazy horse.

5103
02:29:55,621 --> 02:29:55,830
He's,

5104
02:29:55,830 --> 02:29:58,430
he didn't completed his children
and trying to complete again.

5105
02:29:58,560 --> 02:30:00,930
You know why he tried to get too crazy?

5106
02:30:01,880 --> 02:30:03,430
Don't get too crazy.

5107
02:30:03,431 --> 02:30:05,150
This girl matters to you.

5108
02:30:05,810 --> 02:30:07,070
If she is the girl,

5109
02:30:07,071 --> 02:30:08,300
if you want to marry her,

5110
02:30:08,301 --> 02:30:09,350
if she's your life,

5111
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:10,310
I want to do that.

5112
02:30:10,311 --> 02:30:12,380
If she's all crazy because
you love her anyway.

5113
02:30:12,390 --> 02:30:14,420
What if you just met her
and she's already all crazy?

5114
02:30:14,650 --> 02:30:16,160
They just do take on that task.

5115
02:30:16,161 --> 02:30:16,430
Sorry,

5116
02:30:16,430 --> 02:30:17,420
the all girls,

5117
02:30:17,540 --> 02:30:20,000
it's part of being the girl
is being a little crazy.

5118
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:22,250
You're so raw,

5119
02:30:22,760 --> 02:30:24,200
are a little bit aggressive.

5120
02:30:24,230 --> 02:30:24,950
Oh,

5121
02:30:24,950 --> 02:30:25,783
not Brian,

5122
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:26,673
not me.

5123
02:30:26,710 --> 02:30:27,860
Brian's not even remotely aggressive.

5124
02:30:27,861 --> 02:30:28,830
He might be your ideal man.

5125
02:30:28,910 --> 02:30:30,560
You've never been aggressive
in your whole life.

5126
02:30:30,590 --> 02:30:30,830
No,

5127
02:30:30,830 --> 02:30:31,191
no.

5128
02:30:31,191 --> 02:30:34,370
He is absolutely not the girls
ever being aggressive athlete.

5129
02:30:34,371 --> 02:30:35,840
He's not aggressive with guy's.

5130
02:30:35,841 --> 02:30:36,674
He's not aggressive.

5131
02:30:37,240 --> 02:30:38,240
Speak in generalities,

5132
02:30:38,320 --> 02:30:39,230
but rare bird.

5133
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:40,430
I've never met anyone like him.

5134
02:30:40,490 --> 02:30:43,490
It's not uncommon for guys to be
somewhat aggressive and that comes on

5135
02:30:43,491 --> 02:30:44,060
different.

5136
02:30:44,060 --> 02:30:45,560
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

5137
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:48,050
And it's not uncommon for
girls to be emotional.

5138
02:30:48,051 --> 02:30:49,010
I don't want to say crazy.

5139
02:30:49,100 --> 02:30:49,340
Look,

5140
02:30:49,340 --> 02:30:53,700
I eat so much I Denomie and
almond milk milkshakes with that.

5141
02:30:53,720 --> 02:30:54,160
Okay.

5142
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:54,840
Yeah.

5143
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:56,440
So you've got all of those Fido,

5144
02:30:56,441 --> 02:30:57,221
and by the way,

5145
02:30:57,221 --> 02:30:58,300
it's all GMO,

5146
02:30:58,740 --> 02:31:00,670
is that everything needs is GMO.

5147
02:31:01,720 --> 02:31:02,291
He's growing.

5148
02:31:02,291 --> 02:31:02,680
Yeah.

5149
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:03,161
He's growling.

5150
02:31:03,161 --> 02:31:04,820
Fucking huge area.

5151
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:05,790
Yeah.

5152
02:31:05,790 --> 02:31:07,350
It's there isn't that,

5153
02:31:07,690 --> 02:31:10,930
that is some what true that
if you eat too much soy,

5154
02:31:10,931 --> 02:31:12,430
your body and smoked too much weed.

5155
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:13,070
No,

5156
02:31:13,070 --> 02:31:13,550
no,

5157
02:31:13,550 --> 02:31:13,961
that's not,

5158
02:31:13,961 --> 02:31:15,040
the real issue is that,

5159
02:31:15,070 --> 02:31:16,480
is that soy has a lot of,

5160
02:31:16,510 --> 02:31:18,340
it has high levels of Fido estrogens,

5161
02:31:18,341 --> 02:31:20,020
but there's absolutely reason to believe

5162
02:31:20,020 --> 02:31:23,620
that eating plant estrogens are
going to affect your own human.

5163
02:31:23,810 --> 02:31:24,970
It's a completely different model.

5164
02:31:25,360 --> 02:31:26,193
Vegetarian,

5165
02:31:27,330 --> 02:31:27,761
you're not,

5166
02:31:27,761 --> 02:31:28,710
it's not going to affect,

5167
02:31:28,711 --> 02:31:29,170
yeah.

5168
02:31:29,170 --> 02:31:30,003
That's like,

5169
02:31:31,360 --> 02:31:32,193
that's like saying this.

5170
02:31:32,620 --> 02:31:34,570
Like if a girl swallowed a bunch of come,

5171
02:31:34,571 --> 02:31:36,640
she would become more manly
because there's so much.

5172
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:37,461
First of all,

5173
02:31:37,461 --> 02:31:38,294
you don't know anything.

5174
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:40,101
They get stronger.

5175
02:31:40,101 --> 02:31:41,000
They just think better.

5176
02:31:41,850 --> 02:31:44,270
If there's a tribe in New Guinea,

5177
02:31:44,271 --> 02:31:45,230
not just one tribe,

5178
02:31:45,231 --> 02:31:50,231
but many that forced the boys at a very
young age to a ingest their sperm there.

5179
02:31:50,990 --> 02:31:51,220
Uh,

5180
02:31:51,220 --> 02:31:51,480
they,

5181
02:31:51,480 --> 02:31:52,940
and it's not just like one of them.

5182
02:31:52,941 --> 02:31:54,410
It's really fucking crazy.

5183
02:31:54,411 --> 02:31:55,970
There's like many,

5184
02:31:55,971 --> 02:31:58,070
many islands where they practice this,

5185
02:31:58,071 --> 02:32:01,820
where they take these boys away from
their mother at a very early age and they

5186
02:32:01,821 --> 02:32:03,980
live in these bachelor houses.

5187
02:32:04,130 --> 02:32:08,150
They live with men and the men
give them sperm to make them grow

5188
02:32:08,420 --> 02:32:09,270
and they think it helps.

5189
02:32:09,271 --> 02:32:11,490
They believe that's
the only one in Africa.

5190
02:32:11,491 --> 02:32:11,971
There are many,

5191
02:32:11,971 --> 02:32:12,300
many,

5192
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:15,900
many areas in Africa where they still
have bushmeat where they'll still kind of

5193
02:32:15,901 --> 02:32:17,160
murder chimpanzees,

5194
02:32:17,161 --> 02:32:17,581
gorillas,

5195
02:32:17,581 --> 02:32:19,950
and they'll drink their blood because
they think that it gives them life force.

5196
02:32:20,190 --> 02:32:21,600
I think that it makes them stronger.

5197
02:32:21,601 --> 02:32:21,871
You know,

5198
02:32:21,871 --> 02:32:23,310
there's a lot of lore connected to that.

5199
02:32:23,311 --> 02:32:24,270
It's not true.

5200
02:32:24,480 --> 02:32:27,140
The same way that drinking sperm
would not make you pray that,

5201
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:27,650
sir,

5202
02:32:27,650 --> 02:32:27,860
well,

5203
02:32:27,860 --> 02:32:30,290
these guys are the baddest
motherfucker on earth.

5204
02:32:30,291 --> 02:32:31,700
You should go there.

5205
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:33,570
They're flying through
the air and climate.

5206
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:34,101
All right.

5207
02:32:34,101 --> 02:32:34,881
Just so everybody knows,

5208
02:32:34,881 --> 02:32:36,990
Joe Rogan is advocating drinking your own.

5209
02:32:39,230 --> 02:32:40,680
That's not even advocating your own.

5210
02:32:40,690 --> 02:32:44,930
Your how scientific or you watch a
documentary on this boy's doing this.

5211
02:32:45,630 --> 02:32:46,390
It's,

5212
02:32:46,390 --> 02:32:47,060
it's look,

5213
02:32:47,060 --> 02:32:48,240
it's fucking disgusting

5214
02:32:49,670 --> 02:32:50,720
then that's going on right now.

5215
02:32:50,810 --> 02:32:53,900
And I was having this
conversation with a buddy.

5216
02:32:53,901 --> 02:32:55,970
We were talking about Greg
Fitzsimmons last night.

5217
02:32:55,971 --> 02:32:58,690
We were talking about
circumcision and how crazy.

5218
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:00,810
It is crazy.

5219
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:12,310
A child prettier child just died
recently because it's horrible.

5220
02:33:12,390 --> 02:33:13,181
Don't get it at home.

5221
02:33:13,181 --> 02:33:13,871
So we did it at home.

5222
02:33:13,871 --> 02:33:14,830
That big kid bled to death,

5223
02:33:14,890 --> 02:33:16,060
but that my sister's kids,

5224
02:33:16,090 --> 02:33:17,890
both of them went to high tech,

5225
02:33:17,980 --> 02:33:22,020
new hospitals and both of
their got shit got dis.

5226
02:33:22,130 --> 02:33:23,860
Like they fucked up the first time.

5227
02:33:23,980 --> 02:33:25,300
Say that go back months later,

5228
02:33:25,301 --> 02:33:26,950
put them to sleep and Redo it.

5229
02:33:29,350 --> 02:33:33,860
Put a baby to sleep to baby Jesus Christ.

5230
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:37,810
But the idea,

5231
02:33:38,310 --> 02:33:41,320
but that's all it is at this
point in his tradition you'd get,

5232
02:33:41,350 --> 02:33:45,850
have you been with a guy that's had that
that cock before and does it creep you

5233
02:33:45,851 --> 02:33:47,220
out of three guys?

5234
02:33:47,650 --> 02:33:48,640
She's smart dude.

5235
02:33:50,340 --> 02:33:50,780
What?

5236
02:33:50,780 --> 02:33:54,400
Like 200 hey whoa,

5237
02:33:55,870 --> 02:33:57,100
that's big numbers.

5238
02:33:57,130 --> 02:34:01,860
Like three like most girls are like I saw
one was very progressive liberal girl.

5239
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:04,521
What does that mean?

5240
02:34:04,521 --> 02:34:05,360
You Fuck African Guy

5241
02:34:08,350 --> 02:34:09,280
Straight to the motherland.

5242
02:34:10,780 --> 02:34:12,670
A lot of more progressive
and liberal thinkers.

5243
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:15,680
Maybe people who have more liberal
parents are probably people who are less

5244
02:34:15,681 --> 02:34:17,550
likely to have to circumcised.

5245
02:34:17,551 --> 02:34:18,150
I've heard to date

5246
02:34:18,150 --> 02:34:19,170
you because you're so smart.

5247
02:34:19,710 --> 02:34:20,100
Oh,

5248
02:34:20,100 --> 02:34:20,341
I mean,

5249
02:34:20,341 --> 02:34:20,461
like,

5250
02:34:20,461 --> 02:34:24,990
do you know like most of the
relationships are you in smart guys?

5251
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,280
So that's usually not an issue.

5252
02:34:26,281 --> 02:34:27,700
So you're out did fight.

5253
02:34:27,950 --> 02:34:28,681
But by the way,

5254
02:34:28,681 --> 02:34:29,371
just so you know,

5255
02:34:29,371 --> 02:34:29,611
I mean,

5256
02:34:29,611 --> 02:34:32,160
is anybody here in [inaudible]
you're all circumcised?

5257
02:34:32,630 --> 02:34:32,760
Yeah.

5258
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:33,430
That's what we call them in.

5259
02:34:33,430 --> 02:34:37,020
And you're all circumcised monkeys,

5260
02:34:37,050 --> 02:34:38,700
guys who are uncircumcised,

5261
02:34:38,820 --> 02:34:39,660
by the way,

5262
02:34:39,661 --> 02:34:40,470
in case if you don't know,

5263
02:34:40,470 --> 02:34:42,090
it looks the exact same.

5264
02:34:42,091 --> 02:34:42,241
What?

5265
02:34:42,241 --> 02:34:43,074
It's hard.

5266
02:34:43,110 --> 02:34:43,381
Yeah.

5267
02:34:43,381 --> 02:34:44,214
We've seen porn.

5268
02:34:44,260 --> 02:34:45,200
It looks the same.

5269
02:34:45,201 --> 02:34:45,871
We know why.

5270
02:34:45,871 --> 02:34:48,810
Why does it freak anybody out of
the extra skin freaks people out?

5271
02:34:48,830 --> 02:34:51,240
Because whatever the sleeping bag waiting,

5272
02:34:51,270 --> 02:34:52,103
it's nonsense.

5273
02:34:52,560 --> 02:34:53,131
The sleeping bag.

5274
02:34:53,131 --> 02:34:53,490
Queenie.

5275
02:34:53,490 --> 02:34:54,000
Yeah.

5276
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,130
It's one of the dumbest things
that human beings still do.

5277
02:34:56,430 --> 02:34:57,050
And uh,

5278
02:34:57,050 --> 02:35:01,260
and do under the guise really at
the lowest levels of it when the,

5279
02:35:01,261 --> 02:35:02,610
the Orthodox Jews do it.

5280
02:35:02,611 --> 02:35:02,680
Yeah.

5281
02:35:02,680 --> 02:35:05,590
And the rabbi has to suck the
baby's penis to stop the blog.

5282
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:06,210
I don't want to talk about,

5283
02:35:06,210 --> 02:35:06,451
yeah,

5284
02:35:06,451 --> 02:35:07,111
you don't want to talk about it.

5285
02:35:07,111 --> 02:35:09,090
That makes me really
uncomfortable raising.

5286
02:35:09,110 --> 02:35:10,530
I know religion,

5287
02:35:11,580 --> 02:35:13,050
fucking fucking religion.

5288
02:35:13,650 --> 02:35:13,981
Yeah,

5289
02:35:13,981 --> 02:35:14,550
indeed.

5290
02:35:14,550 --> 02:35:15,900
How much shit do you take?

5291
02:35:15,901 --> 02:35:17,160
Like if you do something like this,

5292
02:35:17,161 --> 02:35:18,480
how much should you take on Twitter?

5293
02:35:18,690 --> 02:35:19,680
They're like from people that,

5294
02:35:19,681 --> 02:35:19,841
uh,

5295
02:35:19,841 --> 02:35:20,820
are Bible bangers.

5296
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:21,291
Oh,

5297
02:35:21,291 --> 02:35:21,560
you know,

5298
02:35:21,560 --> 02:35:23,570
I don't have that many
Bible beater followers.

5299
02:35:23,571 --> 02:35:24,830
So I think they kind of know

5300
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:27,480
because they're only going to troll
you and pretend they're bible beater

5301
02:35:27,550 --> 02:35:28,230
follows.

5302
02:35:28,230 --> 02:35:28,651
Because I,

5303
02:35:28,651 --> 02:35:28,921
you know,

5304
02:35:28,921 --> 02:35:29,290
I,

5305
02:35:29,290 --> 02:35:31,150
I'm an atheist and I say it a lot,

5306
02:35:31,180 --> 02:35:31,601
you know,

5307
02:35:31,601 --> 02:35:32,950
so hopefully that doesn't it,

5308
02:35:33,010 --> 02:35:33,821
it kind of does,

5309
02:35:33,821 --> 02:35:34,740
but I feel like I need,

5310
02:35:34,750 --> 02:35:35,050
I did,

5311
02:35:35,050 --> 02:35:36,160
I did an episode of,

5312
02:35:36,161 --> 02:35:36,670
um,

5313
02:35:36,670 --> 02:35:38,950
of this Internet show called the point,

5314
02:35:39,220 --> 02:35:39,881
which is,

5315
02:35:39,881 --> 02:35:42,900
I'm a young Turk spinoff
showed it's like an hour log,

5316
02:35:42,901 --> 02:35:43,750
just talk,

5317
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:44,141
you know,

5318
02:35:44,141 --> 02:35:46,270
three people in a panel and a host.

5319
02:35:46,271 --> 02:35:49,750
And I hosted an episode that was all
about atheism and I made sure that

5320
02:35:49,751 --> 02:35:50,770
everybody on the panel was,

5321
02:35:50,890 --> 02:35:51,730
was an atheist.

5322
02:35:51,760 --> 02:35:52,610
And a lot of people are like,

5323
02:35:52,640 --> 02:35:52,741
ah,

5324
02:35:52,741 --> 02:35:53,590
it's so one sided.

5325
02:35:53,591 --> 02:35:53,930
And I was like,

5326
02:35:53,930 --> 02:35:54,060
no,

5327
02:35:54,060 --> 02:35:54,111
no,

5328
02:35:54,111 --> 02:35:54,520
no.

5329
02:35:54,520 --> 02:35:57,130
This isn't a fucking debate as
to whether or not God exists.

5330
02:35:57,131 --> 02:35:58,450
That's not the point of this show.

5331
02:35:58,451 --> 02:36:01,600
The point of the show is to show
you what it means to be an atheist.

5332
02:36:01,601 --> 02:36:02,800
Where do we get our morals?

5333
02:36:02,801 --> 02:36:04,360
What kinds of people are we?

5334
02:36:04,570 --> 02:36:08,560
We've got to start getting rid
of the stigma because honestly,

5335
02:36:08,950 --> 02:36:11,530
atheists take more shit than
a lot of minority groups,

5336
02:36:11,531 --> 02:36:13,570
and it's one of the biggest
minority groups out there.

5337
02:36:13,750 --> 02:36:15,910
But if you look across the board in,

5338
02:36:15,930 --> 02:36:16,300
um,

5339
02:36:16,300 --> 02:36:16,631
in,

5340
02:36:16,631 --> 02:36:18,580
in positions of political power,

5341
02:36:18,850 --> 02:36:20,120
it's a fucking death wish.

5342
02:36:20,121 --> 02:36:20,710
If you tell,

5343
02:36:20,710 --> 02:36:22,840
if you tell your constituency
that you don't believe in God,

5344
02:36:22,841 --> 02:36:23,674
you're not going to get up.

5345
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:24,440
Yeah.

5346
02:36:24,440 --> 02:36:28,520
It's amazing the idea that doing things
for just because they're the right thing

5347
02:36:28,521 --> 02:36:29,990
to do and it's great for the community.

5348
02:36:29,991 --> 02:36:34,160
Like that's never considered like the
people have to have some sort of a belief

5349
02:36:34,180 --> 02:36:35,090
in some sort of a,

5350
02:36:35,270 --> 02:36:35,421
yeah.

5351
02:36:35,421 --> 02:36:37,580
That they can't possibly
get their morals elsewhere.

5352
02:36:37,610 --> 02:36:37,781
Yeah.

5353
02:36:37,781 --> 02:36:39,410
It's impossible unless there's a deity.

5354
02:36:39,610 --> 02:36:40,540
It's so funny when people are like,

5355
02:36:40,541 --> 02:36:40,691
yeah,

5356
02:36:40,691 --> 02:36:41,560
but thou shalt not kill.

5357
02:36:41,561 --> 02:36:41,861
And I'm like,

5358
02:36:41,861 --> 02:36:42,311
really?

5359
02:36:42,311 --> 02:36:44,320
If there were never any Christianity,

5360
02:36:44,350 --> 02:36:48,130
if there's never any bible or I should
say Judaism cause it's in the first 10

5361
02:36:48,131 --> 02:36:48,590
books,

5362
02:36:48,590 --> 02:36:48,870
if the,

5363
02:36:48,870 --> 02:36:52,530
if that never existed we just would all
be like fucking killing each other and

5364
02:36:52,531 --> 02:36:53,830
nobody would ever stop and go,

5365
02:36:53,850 --> 02:36:54,401
yeah I'm probably,

5366
02:36:54,401 --> 02:36:55,450
we shouldn't kill each other.

5367
02:36:55,570 --> 02:36:57,310
So like it's insane.

5368
02:36:57,530 --> 02:36:57,710
Well

5369
02:36:57,710 --> 02:37:01,280
it's just so weird like as were saying
before that like there are positive

5370
02:37:01,281 --> 02:37:06,281
aspects to the idea of living your life
and I want to say a pious manner but a

5371
02:37:07,310 --> 02:37:11,430
or a spiritual matter cause that's really
tainted to moral a moral manner and

5372
02:37:11,431 --> 02:37:13,270
strive to be as moral as possible.

5373
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:15,200
Loving golden rule.

5374
02:37:15,380 --> 02:37:16,250
I feel like the golden

5375
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:17,870
rule is so kind of,

5376
02:37:17,930 --> 02:37:18,451
it's it,

5377
02:37:18,451 --> 02:37:20,090
it applies to everybody.

5378
02:37:20,120 --> 02:37:22,130
Do unto others as you would
have them do unto you.

5379
02:37:22,180 --> 02:37:27,180
And it's possible that if
everybody followed that most
of the disputes or people

5380
02:37:27,501 --> 02:37:28,430
have could be worked out.

5381
02:37:28,460 --> 02:37:32,900
If you really treat people as if they
are your brothers and sisters and you are

5382
02:37:32,901 --> 02:37:34,070
all in this together.

5383
02:37:34,071 --> 02:37:34,670
If we could,

5384
02:37:34,670 --> 02:37:35,290
but we could.

5385
02:37:35,290 --> 02:37:40,100
Got To figure out how to get everybody
on that same road because if that,

5386
02:37:40,101 --> 02:37:42,950
I mean if two people can get along in
a group of people can get along that we

5387
02:37:42,951 --> 02:37:43,610
can all get along.

5388
02:37:43,610 --> 02:37:46,160
We just have to figure out how to treat
everybody like they're in your group.

5389
02:37:46,190 --> 02:37:48,830
We love the Ingroup
outgroup status situation.

5390
02:37:48,831 --> 02:37:51,650
I mean everything comes down to that.

5391
02:37:51,710 --> 02:37:53,630
Everything comes down to in
group out group psychology,

5392
02:37:53,631 --> 02:37:54,560
whether it's religion,

5393
02:37:54,561 --> 02:37:55,520
whether it's politics,

5394
02:37:55,521 --> 02:37:59,500
it all comes down to us versus them and
it feels like so many people need of

5395
02:37:59,510 --> 02:38:01,790
them in order to define an us well,

5396
02:38:01,791 --> 02:38:03,680
they need that with Mac versus PC.

5397
02:38:04,400 --> 02:38:06,610
They needed with sandbox we do too.

5398
02:38:06,611 --> 02:38:10,550
I'm sure [inaudible] and t hello iPhone.

5399
02:38:10,580 --> 02:38:13,850
People get mad if you have
it and they have Verizon.

5400
02:38:13,851 --> 02:38:14,840
They'll talk shit about it.

5401
02:38:15,280 --> 02:38:16,430
I don't get any fucking service.

5402
02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:18,860
Even you can't even Google
search while you're on the phone.

5403
02:38:19,690 --> 02:38:23,940
What do you care about attached to me
switching providers and it goes back to,

5404
02:38:23,941 --> 02:38:24,410
or you know,

5405
02:38:24,410 --> 02:38:26,510
tribes of monkey people
trying to stay alive.

5406
02:38:26,511 --> 02:38:26,690
I,

5407
02:38:26,690 --> 02:38:26,990
you know,

5408
02:38:26,990 --> 02:38:28,420
being as close together as possible.

5409
02:38:28,421 --> 02:38:29,450
And that outside,

5410
02:38:29,451 --> 02:38:30,101
those are in Beta.

5411
02:38:30,101 --> 02:38:34,310
And it's funny because if you look at
two of our closest genetic relatives,

5412
02:38:34,311 --> 02:38:35,870
chimpanzees and Bonobos,

5413
02:38:35,871 --> 02:38:36,800
they're very similar.

5414
02:38:36,980 --> 02:38:37,311
Actually.

5415
02:38:37,311 --> 02:38:39,320
The banaba used to be
called the pygmy chimpanzee,

5416
02:38:39,321 --> 02:38:41,080
but we know that there
are two separate species.

5417
02:38:41,510 --> 02:38:46,510
The banaba only live in a certain part
of the Congo and they resolve all of

5418
02:38:46,940 --> 02:38:47,773
their differences.

5419
02:38:47,810 --> 02:38:48,643
There's sex,

5420
02:38:48,830 --> 02:38:50,660
they're like the most amicable species.

5421
02:38:50,660 --> 02:38:50,980
They just,

5422
02:38:50,980 --> 02:38:52,220
they're constantly fucking,

5423
02:38:52,221 --> 02:38:53,450
they're always sharing.

5424
02:38:53,660 --> 02:38:58,190
They're just these really
positive sex crazed primates.

5425
02:38:58,191 --> 02:39:01,220
Whereas chimpanzees can be
very violent and they have,

5426
02:39:01,221 --> 02:39:01,461
I mean,

5427
02:39:01,461 --> 02:39:02,480
they can also be kind,

5428
02:39:02,660 --> 02:39:07,660
but they have a strong idea of Ingroup
outgroup status and the string,

5429
02:39:09,020 --> 02:39:09,651
they still fuck,

5430
02:39:09,651 --> 02:39:09,951
of course,

5431
02:39:09,951 --> 02:39:11,330
but they fucked for a procreation.

5432
02:39:11,331 --> 02:39:11,511
I mean,

5433
02:39:11,511 --> 02:39:12,410
it's a very different,

5434
02:39:12,770 --> 02:39:14,900
they probably fucked for
pleasure from time to time too,

5435
02:39:14,901 --> 02:39:15,830
but it's very different.

5436
02:39:15,831 --> 02:39:16,664
Benobos when they,

5437
02:39:16,670 --> 02:39:17,241
when they're observed,

5438
02:39:17,241 --> 02:39:20,660
there's always having
sex with old related,

5439
02:39:20,661 --> 02:39:21,411
not related.

5440
02:39:21,411 --> 02:39:22,430
While they're eating dinner,

5441
02:39:22,431 --> 02:39:23,960
whether it be on their back,

5442
02:39:24,020 --> 02:39:25,700
they figured a way to stay out of the zoo.

5443
02:39:26,460 --> 02:39:27,320
Fuck like crazy.

5444
02:39:28,040 --> 02:39:29,840
So many people to the zoo.

5445
02:39:29,860 --> 02:39:30,810
The zoo doesn't want that

5446
02:39:32,710 --> 02:39:32,960
Novos.

5447
02:39:32,960 --> 02:39:33,171
Fuck.

5448
02:39:33,171 --> 02:39:33,800
They should.

5449
02:39:33,800 --> 02:39:35,080
They get so many more visitors.

5450
02:39:35,730 --> 02:39:39,500
Doesn't let animals do what they
actually do in the real world,

5451
02:39:39,980 --> 02:39:42,830
like supplying good cells to be a shit,

5452
02:39:43,330 --> 02:39:45,140
but it'd be really expensive.

5453
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:46,400
Why would be so expensive?

5454
02:39:46,401 --> 02:39:47,450
Breed your own gazelles.

5455
02:39:49,190 --> 02:39:49,700
Why not?

5456
02:39:49,700 --> 02:39:50,390
That's true.

5457
02:39:50,390 --> 02:39:51,111
I mean if you get them,

5458
02:39:51,111 --> 02:39:53,360
have an animal and lock them in an area,

5459
02:39:53,361 --> 02:39:55,250
the least you could do
is give them some fun.

5460
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:55,551
I mean,

5461
02:39:55,551 --> 02:39:56,090
give him the,

5462
02:39:56,090 --> 02:39:59,300
the genetic thrills that are put
in place that reward systems.

5463
02:39:59,770 --> 02:40:02,780
I feel like there's a
push with some new zoos.

5464
02:40:02,810 --> 02:40:06,830
Hopefully you're starting to see zoos
combining with universities where we're

5465
02:40:06,831 --> 02:40:10,530
seeing kind of animal behavior is
really being a big part of the,

5466
02:40:10,970 --> 02:40:15,390
of the design of the zoo and worrying
more about an animal's wellbeing.

5467
02:40:15,420 --> 02:40:17,010
Not just whether it stays alive,

5468
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:17,760
but it's like,

5469
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:18,330
yeah,

5470
02:40:18,330 --> 02:40:18,961
hell yeah.

5471
02:40:18,961 --> 02:40:19,794
I think that that's really right

5472
02:40:20,350 --> 02:40:24,160
in Denver at the zoo and we were walking
past this one exhibit and there was

5473
02:40:24,161 --> 02:40:27,910
this one monkey that was by himself
and he was wailing and agony,

5474
02:40:28,060 --> 02:40:29,080
just wailing.

5475
02:40:29,380 --> 02:40:30,760
And you could tell he was going nuts.

5476
02:40:30,820 --> 02:40:31,571
He's in this cage.

5477
02:40:31,571 --> 02:40:32,830
People were spinning around staring down.

5478
02:40:32,890 --> 02:40:33,401
There's nothing to do,

5479
02:40:33,401 --> 02:40:36,400
but swing from this rope to
that rope is a very small area.

5480
02:40:36,401 --> 02:40:40,480
And he was just SCO Riemann and it was
like a tortured souls like listening to

5481
02:40:40,481 --> 02:40:41,650
someone go insane.

5482
02:40:42,190 --> 02:40:43,023
Poor monkey.

5483
02:40:43,060 --> 02:40:43,893
That's fucked up.

5484
02:40:43,900 --> 02:40:44,733
You know?

5485
02:40:44,740 --> 02:40:47,320
How much is it worth to
watch that guy in real life?

5486
02:40:47,321 --> 02:40:50,950
Wouldn't it be better to like have them
in the jungle and make a DVD of it and

5487
02:40:50,951 --> 02:40:51,740
put it up?

5488
02:40:51,740 --> 02:40:52,310
But this,

5489
02:40:52,310 --> 02:40:54,350
this monkey might have
been born in captivity.

5490
02:40:54,370 --> 02:40:54,640
Yeah.

5491
02:40:54,640 --> 02:40:55,011
You know what I mean?

5492
02:40:55,011 --> 02:40:57,320
It might not be able to go back
into wild cause it would just die.

5493
02:40:57,390 --> 02:41:00,510
But it's like when you go by
someone's yard and they have a dog,

5494
02:41:00,511 --> 02:41:01,021
a big dog,

5495
02:41:01,021 --> 02:41:01,920
and a tiny little yard,

5496
02:41:01,921 --> 02:41:03,150
the dog's going fucking crazy.

5497
02:41:03,180 --> 02:41:04,980
Like that's not cool.

5498
02:41:05,070 --> 02:41:06,210
You're torturing this animal.

5499
02:41:06,211 --> 02:41:07,110
You're fucking with his life.

5500
02:41:07,360 --> 02:41:09,450
And if that's what you're
doing when you're doing a zoo,

5501
02:41:09,451 --> 02:41:11,640
like shouldn't they have
like a minimal size,

5502
02:41:11,641 --> 02:41:13,170
at least with the intelligent animals?

5503
02:41:13,180 --> 02:41:13,750
I think they,

5504
02:41:13,750 --> 02:41:14,051
yeah.

5505
02:41:14,051 --> 02:41:15,730
And I think that newsrooms
are starting to do that.

5506
02:41:15,731 --> 02:41:16,600
The La Zoo,

5507
02:41:16,620 --> 02:41:20,110
it has a really good elephant
enclosure because elephants are up,

5508
02:41:20,111 --> 02:41:21,340
they're like elephants with,

5509
02:41:21,341 --> 02:41:21,700
um,

5510
02:41:21,700 --> 02:41:24,310
with apes we're much more concerned,

5511
02:41:24,311 --> 02:41:24,551
right?

5512
02:41:24,551 --> 02:41:28,300
Because of the cause of the
cognitive functions of these animals.

5513
02:41:28,450 --> 02:41:31,780
So a lot of zoos don't even keep elephants
because they're not comfortable with

5514
02:41:31,781 --> 02:41:33,190
it or if they're keeping apes,

5515
02:41:33,191 --> 02:41:33,371
you know,

5516
02:41:33,371 --> 02:41:34,204
that they,

5517
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:35,073
at least,

5518
02:41:35,410 --> 02:41:38,620
I hope to see more as he
was trying because there is
kind of an argument for and

5519
02:41:38,621 --> 02:41:39,454
against zoos.

5520
02:41:39,640 --> 02:41:39,881
You know,

5521
02:41:39,881 --> 02:41:41,230
a lot of animal rights activists,

5522
02:41:41,231 --> 02:41:43,840
which I would never call myself
an animal rights activist,

5523
02:41:43,841 --> 02:41:45,310
but I call myself an animal.

5524
02:41:45,570 --> 02:41:46,070
Um,

5525
02:41:46,070 --> 02:41:48,160
I'm an advocate for animal
welfare because I am,

5526
02:41:48,161 --> 02:41:50,590
I'm for using animals
in laboratory research,

5527
02:41:50,710 --> 02:41:52,030
but I think that their welfare needs,

5528
02:41:52,090 --> 02:41:53,260
needs to be cared for,

5529
02:41:53,500 --> 02:41:54,333
um,

5530
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:56,920
for like monkeys or rabbits.

5531
02:41:57,530 --> 02:41:58,363
Um,

5532
02:41:58,800 --> 02:41:59,500
and then we'll reframe it.

5533
02:41:59,500 --> 02:42:00,333
You know,

5534
02:42:00,590 --> 02:42:01,270
I,

5535
02:42:01,270 --> 02:42:02,230
I've been,

5536
02:42:02,650 --> 02:42:04,870
I've been experiencing
shifting views with primates.

5537
02:42:04,900 --> 02:42:07,930
I think that the laws have to be
much more strict with primates.

5538
02:42:07,931 --> 02:42:09,010
I would prefer to see prime.

5539
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:12,700
It's only used for noninvasive
research instead of invasive research.

5540
02:42:12,970 --> 02:42:15,910
And I just hope that the places that
are doing primary research really treat

5541
02:42:15,911 --> 02:42:17,200
these animals with a lot of care.

5542
02:42:17,530 --> 02:42:17,920
Um,

5543
02:42:17,920 --> 02:42:18,581
they don't always,

5544
02:42:18,581 --> 02:42:19,414
which is dangerous,

5545
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:21,430
but we all get that.

5546
02:42:21,490 --> 02:42:22,181
Did you see that?

5547
02:42:22,181 --> 02:42:23,110
Did you see the prequel?

5548
02:42:23,440 --> 02:42:24,610
I liked the prequel.

5549
02:42:25,210 --> 02:42:25,451
Yeah.

5550
02:42:25,451 --> 02:42:26,350
I thought it was really good.

5551
02:42:26,590 --> 02:42:31,590
Or what about that fucking 28 days later
when they gave him that rage and the

5552
02:42:32,491 --> 02:42:32,740
tools,

5553
02:42:32,740 --> 02:42:33,670
they give him the rage.

5554
02:42:33,730 --> 02:42:34,563
And that's true.

5555
02:42:34,990 --> 02:42:36,970
But that didn't like
happen in real life though.

5556
02:42:36,971 --> 02:42:38,080
That happened in the movie.

5557
02:42:38,290 --> 02:42:38,621
No.

5558
02:42:38,621 --> 02:42:39,940
But what did happen in real life?

5559
02:42:40,240 --> 02:42:43,430
It's just a scary when you
think about that do exist.

5560
02:42:44,050 --> 02:42:44,883
Oh fuck yeah.

5561
02:42:45,450 --> 02:42:45,721
Nutty.

5562
02:42:45,721 --> 02:42:47,130
How many we've created two.

5563
02:42:47,160 --> 02:42:48,060
That's what's really scary.

5564
02:42:48,061 --> 02:42:52,380
How many people have created these
biological weapons that if they got out,

5565
02:42:52,710 --> 02:42:54,120
wipe out giant cities.

5566
02:42:54,121 --> 02:42:54,600
Whoops.

5567
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:55,830
We just want to see if we can make it.

5568
02:42:56,060 --> 02:42:56,810
That's true.

5569
02:42:56,810 --> 02:42:57,770
I mean that's true.

5570
02:42:57,890 --> 02:42:59,250
And we continue to,

5571
02:42:59,251 --> 02:43:00,290
to do this kind of research.

5572
02:43:00,291 --> 02:43:01,880
And what does this research mostly,

5573
02:43:01,881 --> 02:43:02,240
um,

5574
02:43:02,240 --> 02:43:02,540
uh,

5575
02:43:02,540 --> 02:43:04,280
funded by defense.

5576
02:43:04,610 --> 02:43:04,821
I mean,

5577
02:43:04,821 --> 02:43:06,210
this is national defense.

5578
02:43:06,740 --> 02:43:07,311
Exactly.

5579
02:43:07,311 --> 02:43:08,144
That's so true.

5580
02:43:08,410 --> 02:43:12,140
Banabos we'll have sex in every
combination except and son.

5581
02:43:12,200 --> 02:43:15,980
That's the only combination that
makes Benobos more moral than people.

5582
02:43:16,010 --> 02:43:16,580
That's true.

5583
02:43:16,580 --> 02:43:18,020
Because someone out there with some dude,

5584
02:43:18,021 --> 02:43:18,480
it's fucking,

5585
02:43:18,480 --> 02:43:18,631
yeah,

5586
02:43:18,631 --> 02:43:19,240
that's true.

5587
02:43:19,240 --> 02:43:22,110
And it's like somehow
they know or they've,

5588
02:43:22,380 --> 02:43:23,160
they've,

5589
02:43:23,160 --> 02:43:27,780
whether it's instinctual or they've kind
of learned some sort of disgust signal

5590
02:43:28,310 --> 02:43:29,143
through that because they,

5591
02:43:29,820 --> 02:43:31,410
if they bred mother and son,

5592
02:43:31,411 --> 02:43:35,370
they would end up with a lot of fucked
up genetic problems so they can,

5593
02:43:35,371 --> 02:43:36,480
they can fuck any others.

5594
02:43:36,481 --> 02:43:37,140
But,

5595
02:43:37,140 --> 02:43:38,110
but mother and son camp,

5596
02:43:38,410 --> 02:43:39,140
it's fascinating.

5597
02:43:39,140 --> 02:43:42,310
They must have just produced too
many bad kids and then realized that.

5598
02:43:42,311 --> 02:43:42,791
So there's,

5599
02:43:42,791 --> 02:43:44,080
there's gotta be a connection here.

5600
02:43:44,140 --> 02:43:44,560
Yeah.

5601
02:43:44,560 --> 02:43:46,180
But how would they know
who impregnated them?

5602
02:43:46,270 --> 02:43:46,840
If everyone

5603
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:47,141
fucking,

5604
02:43:47,141 --> 02:43:47,771
everybody I don't know.

5605
02:43:47,771 --> 02:43:49,000
And they fuck face to face,

5606
02:43:49,001 --> 02:43:50,380
which is really crazy to watch.

5607
02:43:50,410 --> 02:43:50,590
Yeah.

5608
02:43:50,590 --> 02:43:51,041
It's really,

5609
02:43:51,041 --> 02:43:51,251
I mean,

5610
02:43:51,251 --> 02:43:52,540
it's kind of cool to see them.

5611
02:43:52,780 --> 02:43:54,340
They have sex like humans do.

5612
02:43:54,341 --> 02:43:55,510
And most species don't.

5613
02:43:55,511 --> 02:43:59,140
Most all species have sex from behind
because you got to look out for predators.

5614
02:43:59,320 --> 02:44:00,250
They're up in the trees.

5615
02:44:00,280 --> 02:44:01,870
Well also a lot of animal sex.

5616
02:44:01,871 --> 02:44:04,140
I would venture to guess it's
kind of rapey have a little race.

5617
02:44:04,150 --> 02:44:04,320
Yeah.

5618
02:44:04,320 --> 02:44:06,860
Little rapey cause you
paid any attention to uh,

5619
02:44:06,890 --> 02:44:07,221
the,

5620
02:44:07,221 --> 02:44:07,630
uh,

5621
02:44:07,630 --> 02:44:08,331
giant champ.

5622
02:44:08,331 --> 02:44:09,470
But they found the Congo,

5623
02:44:09,620 --> 02:44:11,240
the Bondo ape.

5624
02:44:11,480 --> 02:44:12,230
No.

5625
02:44:12,230 --> 02:44:12,501
Yeah,

5626
02:44:12,501 --> 02:44:13,161
they found this,

5627
02:44:13,161 --> 02:44:13,580
uh,

5628
02:44:13,580 --> 02:44:15,550
this guy named Carl Amon.

5629
02:44:15,560 --> 02:44:19,330
He's a Swiss wildlife
photographer and he started,

5630
02:44:19,331 --> 02:44:19,550
uh,

5631
02:44:19,550 --> 02:44:20,930
studying them in [inaudible] 96.

5632
02:44:21,080 --> 02:44:24,350
They have some camera trap photos and
then they started sending expeditions and

5633
02:44:24,351 --> 02:44:27,350
they found it's a
completely different strain.

5634
02:44:27,351 --> 02:44:27,751
If you look,

5635
02:44:27,751 --> 02:44:28,790
look Google image,

5636
02:44:29,020 --> 02:44:30,020
you see how big they are.

5637
02:44:30,021 --> 02:44:31,710
They're fucking dead wall.

5638
02:44:32,020 --> 02:44:32,870
The bondo,

5639
02:44:32,871 --> 02:44:33,560
a Bondo,

5640
02:44:33,560 --> 02:44:34,393
bondo mystery.

5641
02:44:34,820 --> 02:44:37,800
National Geographic has
some great articles on it.

5642
02:44:37,870 --> 02:44:38,090
I,

5643
02:44:38,090 --> 02:44:38,420
Nat Geo.

5644
02:44:38,420 --> 02:44:38,670
Yeah.

5645
02:44:38,670 --> 02:44:39,160
Love it.

5646
02:44:39,160 --> 02:44:39,830
There.

5647
02:44:39,830 --> 02:44:40,663
The,

5648
02:44:40,920 --> 02:44:44,540
it's a complete different subspecies of
chimpanzee would they have a crest on

5649
02:44:44,541 --> 02:44:44,841
their head,

5650
02:44:44,841 --> 02:44:47,840
like gorillas and they're enormous
and they nest on the ground.

5651
02:44:48,080 --> 02:44:50,870
They don't sleep up in the trees because
they're big and they don't give a fuck.

5652
02:44:50,871 --> 02:44:52,790
And the locals call them lion killers.

5653
02:44:52,990 --> 02:44:53,410
Oh,

5654
02:44:53,410 --> 02:44:55,040
they say they have two
different types of chimps.

5655
02:44:55,041 --> 02:44:58,250
Is there a giant chimps and this,

5656
02:44:58,251 --> 02:45:01,820
it's actually the same sort of creature
that was in Michael Crighton's book,

5657
02:45:01,850 --> 02:45:02,683
the Congo.

5658
02:45:02,690 --> 02:45:05,170
That's silly mood book
was apparently very good,

5659
02:45:05,240 --> 02:45:06,560
but the reason is a great author.

5660
02:45:06,561 --> 02:45:06,830
I don't,

5661
02:45:06,830 --> 02:45:09,590
I mean there was a lot of really good
science and I mean he gets very science

5662
02:45:09,591 --> 02:45:10,790
fictiony but like come on,

5663
02:45:10,830 --> 02:45:13,530
we even got the color of them
because they have a gray color,

5664
02:45:13,531 --> 02:45:14,101
especially the,

5665
02:45:14,101 --> 02:45:14,800
when they get older,

5666
02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:16,440
sort of like how silver
back's turned gray.

5667
02:45:16,450 --> 02:45:16,710
Yeah.

5668
02:45:16,710 --> 02:45:20,070
These chimps turn gray too and they
thought it could be some sort of a hybrid

5669
02:45:20,071 --> 02:45:21,300
between chimps and gorillas.

5670
02:45:21,480 --> 02:45:23,520
They're not completely sure that it's not.

5671
02:45:23,750 --> 02:45:24,600
This is interesting.

5672
02:45:24,601 --> 02:45:25,434
Most likely.

5673
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:29,280
Most likely they think that it's just a
subspecies that only exists in this one

5674
02:45:29,281 --> 02:45:30,260
area called belly.

5675
02:45:30,480 --> 02:45:30,661
Well,

5676
02:45:30,661 --> 02:45:30,961
yeah,

5677
02:45:30,961 --> 02:45:31,880
I mean it happens like,

5678
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:32,641
like the Banabos.

5679
02:45:32,641 --> 02:45:36,540
They're only across a certain river in
the Congo and they just stayed there and

5680
02:45:36,541 --> 02:45:37,470
evolved and they don't exist.

5681
02:45:37,990 --> 02:45:40,030
Video of one of them eating a leopard.

5682
02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:40,551
Oh,

5683
02:45:40,551 --> 02:45:41,200
that's amazing.

5684
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:41,710
Yeah.

5685
02:45:41,710 --> 02:45:43,030
I don't know if it killed a leopard,

5686
02:45:43,031 --> 02:45:43,870
but they know it ate it.

5687
02:45:44,260 --> 02:45:44,560
Yeah,

5688
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:44,831
they,

5689
02:45:44,831 --> 02:45:46,090
they're fucking huge.

5690
02:45:46,120 --> 02:45:46,811
These are like,

5691
02:45:46,811 --> 02:45:47,021
you know,

5692
02:45:47,021 --> 02:45:51,160
if you think about a regular champ being
150 200 pounds and having the strength

5693
02:45:51,161 --> 02:45:51,881
of whatever it is,

5694
02:45:51,881 --> 02:45:52,900
a 500 pound man,

5695
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:53,680
how,

5696
02:45:53,680 --> 02:45:54,670
how big are these things?

5697
02:45:54,690 --> 02:45:55,271
The three,

5698
02:45:55,271 --> 02:45:56,170
400 pounds,

5699
02:45:56,171 --> 02:45:57,000
500 pounds.

5700
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,480
They're there like at least a hundred
pounds bigger than a regular champ.

5701
02:45:59,481 --> 02:46:00,550
And they had a shred.

5702
02:46:00,551 --> 02:46:03,190
Some of them that are six feet
tall and they standing up,

5703
02:46:03,220 --> 02:46:06,370
they have camera trap photos of them
that like they say that's a six foot tall

5704
02:46:06,371 --> 02:46:06,790
chimp.

5705
02:46:06,790 --> 02:46:07,350
Yeah,

5706
02:46:07,350 --> 02:46:08,440
a six foot tall champ.

5707
02:46:08,740 --> 02:46:10,020
That's so a lot

5708
02:46:10,150 --> 02:46:11,120
and put that can exist.

5709
02:46:12,050 --> 02:46:12,501
Well I don't,

5710
02:46:12,501 --> 02:46:12,751
I'm,

5711
02:46:12,751 --> 02:46:15,650
I'm just saying that they've been
looking for it for a really long time,

5712
02:46:15,680 --> 02:46:16,530
but who's been looking?

5713
02:46:16,550 --> 02:46:18,280
Do you ever watch finding that's true?

5714
02:46:20,390 --> 02:46:21,890
Not that they don't know
what the fuck they're doing,

5715
02:46:21,891 --> 02:46:23,480
but they don't know what
the fuck they're doing.

5716
02:46:23,481 --> 02:46:23,920
Yeah.

5717
02:46:23,920 --> 02:46:27,380
I think there's somebody who knows what
they're doing has looked survivor man,

5718
02:46:27,830 --> 02:46:28,400
that's strong.

5719
02:46:28,400 --> 02:46:29,233
It's bad ass.

5720
02:46:29,830 --> 02:46:30,720
It's like a really fat.

5721
02:46:30,721 --> 02:46:31,580
Had him on the podcast,

5722
02:46:31,910 --> 02:46:32,900
he's going to go

5723
02:46:33,260 --> 02:46:36,800
live in the forest and try to find big
foot cause he hadn't experienced in

5724
02:46:36,801 --> 02:46:37,610
Alaska.

5725
02:46:37,610 --> 02:46:41,420
He had some bipedal thing
making AYP noise is really loud,

5726
02:46:41,421 --> 02:46:43,910
50 feet from his tent in
the middle of nowhere.

5727
02:46:43,911 --> 02:46:44,744
He said,

5728
02:46:44,810 --> 02:46:46,250
take a fucking picture.

5729
02:46:46,251 --> 02:46:46,611
Tried.

5730
02:46:46,611 --> 02:46:47,720
He tried to get out his camera,

5731
02:46:47,721 --> 02:46:48,620
but the thing ran away.

5732
02:46:48,740 --> 02:46:52,370
He was in his tent and he heard it walking
around outside in the middle of the

5733
02:46:52,370 --> 02:46:53,203
night and then he heard

5734
02:46:54,520 --> 02:46:58,160
said it was really loud and it was only
like 50 feet from his 10 he said it was

5735
02:46:58,161 --> 02:47:00,650
the freakiest fucking thing he's
ever experienced in his life.

5736
02:47:01,010 --> 02:47:02,170
He knew it wasn't a moose,

5737
02:47:02,690 --> 02:47:04,040
it was walking on two feet for sure.

5738
02:47:04,041 --> 02:47:04,880
He knew it wasn't a bear,

5739
02:47:04,881 --> 02:47:06,020
it wasn't making bear noises.

5740
02:47:06,060 --> 02:47:06,893
He said an ape.

5741
02:47:07,550 --> 02:47:08,300
