1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,500
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,290
You don't talk about Asians have your,

3
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:06,450
your reality of your situation,

4
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:07,141
like your family,

5
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,260
like you don't want to talk about though.

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,143
I talked to everything.

7
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,660
You tell everybody on the whole story
what you did and why you can't go back to

8
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:13,220
Japan.

9
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:13,341
No,

10
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:13,981
I could go back.

11
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,060
I just can't get out.

12
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,950
You can't get out once you go back.

13
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,240
I would imagine so.

14
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,183
There's probably,

15
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,210
there's probably like a criminal record.

16
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,020
Yeah.

17
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,490
Tell it's a little different because tell
everybody what happened if you want it

18
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,900
to mean this is an interesting story over.

19
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,250
Yeah.

20
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:29,790
Well,

21
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,623
um,

22
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,160
if you want to listen on that,

23
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,133
not a problem at all.

24
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,200
That's the only reason why I brought
this up because I know you're pretty

25
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,870
adamant about expressing
yourself all the time.

26
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,193
I,

27
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,530
I would say before I finished,

28
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:42,680
uh,

29
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,110
started the story that uh,

30
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,210
Dave was a wrestler in Japan September
of 2003 in the same week I was in jail in

31
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:51,321
La County.

32
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:52,880
So I guess we were meant
to meet each other,

33
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:54,560
but they apart 10 years ago,

34
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,521
this coming September,

35
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:56,240
we're in jail.

36
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,451
Oh,

37
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:57,410
someone sounds like a stock.

38
00:00:57,411 --> 00:00:58,080
Correct.

39
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,660
That's exactly what I would send an email
if I was trying to get them to get me

40
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:03,494
pregnant.

41
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,493
So what's your,

42
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,453
tell us your story.

43
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,460
So I got an email in August,

44
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,050
2003 from my cousin.

45
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,800
Basically my writing skill
in Japanese isn't that good.

46
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:17,120
So he wrote it in English.

47
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,250
He basically could row pop up dead.

48
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,780
That's their nice went dead.

49
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,770
My father was dead,

50
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,360
but they didn't know
how to write in English.

51
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,560
So that's the only thing.

52
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:25,130
They were well,

53
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:25,670
and uh,

54
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,030
I called them and find out my
dad supposedly killed himself.

55
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,810
So wedding couple of days I flew back
to Japan and find out what happened

56
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,160
because I saw him six months before,

57
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,270
early 2003.

58
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,890
Um,

59
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,920
I find out that my step mother was
cheating on my dad before marriage,

60
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:40,641
during marriage.

61
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:40,881
And,

62
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:41,240
um,

63
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,810
they're trying to,

64
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,130
they're in process getting divorced,

65
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:44,970
but my dad killed himself later.

66
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:45,440
One.

67
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,670
We don't know for sure.

68
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,380
He commit suicide or my stepmother
have something to do with his death.

69
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,130
We don't know.

70
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,461
But,

71
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:52,820
um,

72
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,080
during the funeral I sold
my step mother killed him.

73
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,560
Do you think she killed?

74
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,410
I think so.

75
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,150
Why do you think that the
more I hear the story,

76
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:00,140
she sounds like the most,

77
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:00,620
my,

78
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,080
my cousins older brought in Korea.

79
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,030
She was living in Korea at my stepmother.

80
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,260
So my cousins,

81
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,660
older brother lives in Korea,

82
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,190
their virgin FBI,

83
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,640
they've checked the background and
my stepmother flew in the day before.

84
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,900
The last time they saw my dad alive.

85
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,090
Doesn't mean that he killed her,

86
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:20,430
but the,

87
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,041
she lies,

88
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:21,874
she killed him.

89
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,580
She said that she wasn't in Japan the
whole time and we find out later why she

90
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:25,970
lied.

91
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,803
She lied about that.

92
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,041
Well,

93
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,000
she lied about that.

94
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:28,720
That's that,

95
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,710
that kind of guilt lying about
where you were very suspicious.

96
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:33,100
Yeah.

97
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,930
So it doesn't mean she did it die.

98
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,600
How did he die?

99
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,410
Um,

100
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,070
hanging.

101
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,420
So I went to police station and saw the
picture and he was in the hot sun for

102
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:42,530
like two weeks.

103
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,270
So he was dark.

104
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:44,490
I mean,

105
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,900
he looked like we just
hanging outside inside.

106
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:48,980
But that summertime,

107
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:49,281
Japan,

108
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:50,390
it's so hot and humid,

109
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,040
a decomposing.

110
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,491
This is,

111
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:54,080
this is how I met Yoshi told us.

112
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:54,920
What was the joke?

113
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,750
It was the darkest joke
I've ever heard in my life.

114
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,280
What did I say?

115
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,740
Told the joke.

116
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,320
It's a joke.

117
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,120
I just say,

118
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,521
you know,

119
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,140
he was darker than a nigger or whatever.

120
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,520
But uh,

121
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:10,354
Yo,

122
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,300
that is not a dark joke
or even a good one.

123
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,960
But a racial slur darker
than Bobby Lee's balls.

124
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:17,610
Yes.

125
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,140
So Bobby Lee have dark
balls as black balls.

126
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,521
I can't.

127
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:21,910
Of course,

128
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,960
I can't approve of that.

129
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:23,980
That joke.

130
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,000
Do you don't say that on stage,

131
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:25,300
dude?

132
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,630
Yeah,

133
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,021
he did.

134
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:26,530
He did.

135
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:26,981
I was like,

136
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:27,761
this guy's crazy.

137
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:28,210
He's like,

138
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,020
that's ridiculous.

139
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,580
That's how you ended your act or somebody.

140
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,050
That's a good way to get your ass kicked.

141
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,160
Not yet,

142
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,180
but I'm going to have.

143
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,490
But basically he had been
hanging and he turned black.

144
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,670
So he was hanging and basically the heat
of the house just slowly cooked him.

145
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,111
Yeah.

146
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:44,261
I mean,

147
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:44,930
I showed the picture.

148
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,763
The cop told me,

149
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,860
I highly recommend you
don't look at the picture,

150
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,420
but I needed to see,

151
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:49,960
you know,

152
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,580
because after his death,

153
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:52,330
my family farm,

154
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,410
he told me that all the
horrible things that were have.

155
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,000
So do you think that she could have
possibly driven him to do that?

156
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,330
Yeah,

157
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:58,751
for sure.

158
00:03:58,751 --> 00:03:59,680
100% yeah.

159
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,520
Yeah.

160
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,590
She lived hundreds of thousands of dead.

161
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,360
And He,

162
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,020
she told my dad that she brought
one of her cousin from Korea.

163
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,980
We later on find out it was her lover,

164
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:10,780
her the whole time.

165
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,220
So while my dad was working,

166
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,040
she was fucking this guy
pretending to be her cousin,

167
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:15,550
whatever.

168
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,960
Just the whole humiliation,

169
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,400
debt and all that stuff.

170
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:18,731
And like,

171
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:19,564
was she younger?

172
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,801
10 years younger,

173
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:21,634
but this,

174
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,500
are you sure she wasn't
just fucking her cousin.

175
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,490
This is why a guy like David
should be afraid of marriage.

176
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,383
Okay.

177
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,860
Never ever,

178
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,280
never fuck someone where you're confused
as to why they're fucking you or never.

179
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,333
But then

180
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,990
the reality is the natural law,

181
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,501
the world,

182
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:41,251
you shouldn't get laid,

183
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,084
Brian,

184
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,620
she'd get your shit together first.

185
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:44,671
But so,

186
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,001
so,

187
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:47,520
so that happens when you do that man,

188
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,110
people start to resent.

189
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,980
You ever see like a famous dude with a
trophy wife and the trophy wife fucking

190
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:53,880
hates being there,

191
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:54,690
you know?

192
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,620
And you see that,

193
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,610
that that's a,

194
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,290
that's a sketchy situation.

195
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,900
Yeah.

196
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,900
I watched this dude and I watched his
wife yelled at him and shit and he's like,

197
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:05,420
uh,

198
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,770
like this sort of minuscule famous guy.

199
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,360
He's a small guy and you know,

200
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,530
the wife was yelling at him,

201
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:11,730
I'm giving him a hard
time and he had just,

202
00:05:11,731 --> 00:05:14,670
he just absorbed it and dealt
with it and it was really,

203
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:18,810
it really fucked me up cause this guy's
really famous and I was like doing man,

204
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,700
why are you in this prison to abuse you?

205
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,740
This is fucking shitty person in
your life is treating you like that.

206
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:25,931
Why?

207
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:27,900
Because she's not impressed with you.

208
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:28,734
Like what is it?

209
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,640
I'll tell you why some people wait a
hundred and fucking 30 pounds and she was

210
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:34,560
six foot tall and hot as fuck.

211
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,880
And she really wanted to get
fucked by Chinese black men,

212
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,150
Dingo time Mandingo or cause
and maybe like when a guy,

213
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,120
when the guy is an old guy and he's got
this hot young chippy and he doesn't

214
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:48,090
know why she's with them.

215
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,640
She's fucking stealing from you,

216
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:50,970
man.

217
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,803
Yeah.

218
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,323
So what happened?

219
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,740
So I went back to the funeral and um,

220
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,910
somehow she was,

221
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,450
she didn't know my temperament because
my dad's a very kind and nice person.

222
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,920
He's never hit me before,

223
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,930
but I have temperament from my mother.

224
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:06,420
She was,

225
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:06,650
you know,

226
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,870
she was typical Korean women varies,

227
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,141
uh,

228
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:09,741
aggressive,

229
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:10,041
you know.

230
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,550
So I caught her at the funeral by herself,

231
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:13,820
uh,

232
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,440
preparing to funeral thing for my dad.

233
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:15,860
Right.

234
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,030
It was like way up a hill.

235
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:17,270
Yeah.

236
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,103
Way Up in the hill,

237
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,970
rest of the family of down
the hill and parking lot.

238
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:20,880
They didn't know what's going on.

239
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,470
So basically I went up there
with my aunt and my aunt's soul,

240
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,221
my stepmother,

241
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:25,611
and she goes,

242
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:26,660
you kill my fucking brother.

243
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:27,411
You fucking bitch.

244
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:28,244
He leaves.

245
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,390
It was me and her and everyone knows at
this point that she was cheating on him

246
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:32,840
the whole time.

247
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,081
Oh yeah.

248
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:34,200
Everybody knows she the oldest of all.

249
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:35,640
She even tried to poison my dad.

250
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:37,100
So next thing you know,

251
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:38,120
she tried to poison.

252
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,313
They took the sample,

253
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,510
know those Korean dish,

254
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:42,231
Kimchi or whatever.

255
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,190
She brought from Korea.

256
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,660
My Dad kept getting sick,

257
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:47,300
so they took all the food from
refrigerator at some medical lab.

258
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,110
They checked and there
was a poison in a dish.

259
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,440
You're your stepmom is poisoning his
Kimchi and hitting on and cheating on him

260
00:06:57,381 --> 00:07:00,170
and the whole family knows and she has
the fucking balls to go to the funeral.

261
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,060
When she was playing this thing,

262
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:02,930
she didn't know anything about.

263
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:05,070
Me and her older sister have a reputation.

264
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,510
I'm Marion bunch of guy and the
old dying and Mr is circumstance.

265
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,071
Oh,

266
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:09,950
so they have a history.

267
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,330
They have a history of that.

268
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,290
Her and her older sister
does the same thing.

269
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:14,830
This,

270
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,430
this sounds like it's crazy.

271
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,480
It's fucking insane.

272
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,391
So my aunts,

273
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:19,160
are you fucking budget,

274
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,731
kill my brother.

275
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,690
She left sounds and then 10 seconds later
I just started running over and just

276
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:27,800
beating the shit out of her and I grabbed
back of her head and start punching

277
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:30,070
their face for a long time and put her in.

278
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:30,950
She's unconscious.

279
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,491
No,

280
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:34,520
but she was shocked because she didn't
know I had an inmate to do that and I was

281
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,110
a little surprised because
I didn't plan to do that.

282
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:36,944
I was angry,

283
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:37,671
but I didn't take,

284
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:40,010
she was dumb enough to be separated
by the rest of her family.

285
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:40,844
But she was arrested.

286
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,340
She was,

287
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,171
she was by herself.

288
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:42,801
You are by herself.

289
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:44,750
No one is anywhere near no one near.

290
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:48,440
And instead of grab her back of her head
and just started beating her face in

291
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,860
stop and uh,

292
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,190
put on her ground and it starts
stumping between her legs.

293
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,110
They're like eyeballs
stomped her pussy stomach.

294
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,950
Then her face or eyeballs,

295
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,170
well to come out I was stomping her face
like have to five or six times and I

296
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:04,340
heard some lady that work
at the cemetery scream.

297
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:07,970
That's when I kind of just stomping
on this lady and started screaming.

298
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,100
So how much damage did you do to her?

299
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,630
I think if I did it,

300
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,760
like my cousin called me in like
week later and he was laughing,

301
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,310
he was laughing on the phone like yeah,

302
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:17,390
if you did it for another menu,

303
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:18,141
probably killed her,

304
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:18,561
whatever.

305
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:21,050
She ended up going to hospital
for like two and a half,

306
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:21,884
three months.

307
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,690
But that snapped him out of it.

308
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:24,590
The lady screaming.

309
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,270
So then he ran back down the hill.

310
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:26,930
That's true.

311
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,763
And then like,

312
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,930
like everyone's like
what the fuck's going on?

313
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:31,760
And he like grabbed his cousin's car keys.

314
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:31,970
No,

315
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,130
no,

316
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,963
no.

317
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,500
Yes.

318
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,580
I went down and uh,

319
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,780
my stepmother's nephew
was walking up the stairs.

320
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:39,640
He didn't know what's going on.

321
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,820
So I started coming down and he
doesn't know what's going on.

322
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,240
So I figured by then I
already beat one person.

323
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,510
What difference does it make if I have,

324
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:46,540
so this guy goes,

325
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,120
peoples,

326
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,460
this funeral was how long after Japan,

327
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,180
but like when you got off the plane
and went straight to the funeral,

328
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:53,720
right?

329
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,321
A day after.

330
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:54,740
Yeah.

331
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,220
So this guy gets the Japan,

332
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,880
goes to a funeral and then just
starts punching people and then like,

333
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,830
so you attacked him as well?

334
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:02,670
For what reason?

335
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:05,550
Just because I feel related to her,

336
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,410
to her and like what difference does it
make if I fuck everybody at this point?

337
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:09,490
Yeah.

338
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,321
It's like porn stars.

339
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:13,410
Like what difference does it make you
feel about fuck one hooker or 500 once you

340
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:14,160
do one,

341
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,380
it's really interesting.

342
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,710
You're using attempted murder
and connecting it to gang bang.

343
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,001
Oh,

344
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,350
Yoshi kills hookers all the time.

345
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,213
No.

346
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,510
And kills him with his aids.

347
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,770
So the animals are out a boy that a boy.

348
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,170
So I went down the stairs,

349
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:34,681
I saw him,

350
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:35,550
I sucker punch him.

351
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:36,570
He doesn't know what's going on.

352
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,290
Oh my God.

353
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,160
And there was a little,

354
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:38,690
uh,

355
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,600
feel bad for that.

356
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:39,901
No,

357
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:40,734
not at all.

358
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,560
But he,

359
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,630
I wish I want to do with it.

360
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,480
I know by was just angry
with her and her family.

361
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:45,840
Right.

362
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,150
But mean her family is just people.

363
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,203
Yeah.

364
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,380
Don't feel bad of
poisoning poisonous Pete.

365
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:52,621
Well,

366
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:53,071
you know what I mean?

367
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:56,520
Maybe they don't know what the fuck
the sister and her dad at the time.

368
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:56,761
I didn't,

369
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:57,760
I wasn't really rationale.

370
00:09:57,761 --> 00:09:59,120
It was just so angry.

371
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,620
So I sucker punching.

372
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:02,220
He went down.

373
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,210
It'll most of these eight,

374
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,290
I'm six foot one.

375
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,210
Most of these people are
like five one five two.

376
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,970
So even though I'm not a
physically imposing in America,

377
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,230
I'm pretty big in Japan.

378
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,120
You're kicking ass in jail.

379
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,630
I'm Anderson Silva when it comes to
fighting and beating up old women.

380
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:18,150
But so how old was she
when you did this to her?

381
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,250
55 or something.

382
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,870
Oh,

383
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,130
Holy Shit.

384
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,971
She killed his dad,

385
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:24,120
man.

386
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,301
Oh,

387
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:25,140
I understand.

388
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:25,590
Listen,

389
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,310
there's no [inaudible]
I lost my fucking mind.

390
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:27,630
You know.

391
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:27,961
Listen,

392
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:28,794
I would've killed her.

393
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,340
I,

394
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,320
if I'm stomping on a check for five times,

395
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:32,154
she's dead.

396
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,580
I don't know how the fuck your
pussy stomps allowed her to live.

397
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,421
So he knocks the,

398
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:37,530
knocks the nephew out.

399
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,401
I got this little,

400
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:39,810
it's not something to joke about,

401
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:40,231
by the way,

402
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:40,921
ladies and gentlemen.

403
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:41,730
You're right.

404
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,260
If your outrage listening to this,

405
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:43,501
you're like,

406
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:48,501
I can't believe he just got that little
mallet where Buddhist scope to water to

407
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,530
clean that cemetery.

408
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:50,364
I grabbed that stuff,

409
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,121
just beat him one.

410
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:54,690
But the head Cup of times ran down
the parking lot and it's still there.

411
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,160
My stepmother's older sister and her and
her husband and then I started s sucker

412
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:00,060
punch him too.

413
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,080
It's punching everybody.

414
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,140
Yeah.

415
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,930
Punchbowl more endurance at this point.

416
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,190
You're getting winded.

417
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,270
Yeah.

418
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,590
I wish I would have stretched before that,

419
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,220
but I didn't plan,

420
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,900
it wasn't planning itself.

421
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,800
I don't know anything about martial art.

422
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:14,640
I don't let any of that stuff.

423
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,120
It was unplanned.

424
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,270
You beat all these people out.

425
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,360
How do you get out of the country?

426
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,783
Um,

427
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,510
my shit,

428
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:21,960
Mike,

429
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,070
my aunt Yoshi,

430
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,430
she's the only one when he
started finding me back,

431
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:27,120
she's the one that,

432
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,920
she had a cancer brain cancer actually,

433
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,740
but she's the one that uh,

434
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,763
interrupted fight.

435
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,080
Stop punching him and
just told me to leave.

436
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,780
And I told my cousin dragged me out of
there and he wasn't sure cause he want

437
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:38,100
to.

438
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,010
So you punched him too?

439
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,211
No,

440
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:39,301
no,

441
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:39,660
no,

442
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,493
no.

443
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,460
If I think he hesitated because he
doesn't want a somebody who did criminal

444
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,990
acts,

445
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,380
but he's smaller than I am,

446
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:46,960
so if you don't take,

447
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,820
I'm going to beat the shit out of it.

448
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,330
Well,

449
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:53,330
we got in his car and he's driving
me out of there and I went to Osaka

450
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:53,620
International.

451
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,790
He just got to Japan.

452
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,301
Yeah,

453
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:58,120
like a day before and then he went and
beat everyone up and then he's hiding.

454
00:11:58,121 --> 00:11:59,260
You got right to the airport?

455
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,840
I grabbed his cell phone
and call the airlines,

456
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,703
changed my flight.

457
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,460
I'm praying there's another fly with the
flowers and there just happened to be

458
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:07,420
one in four hours,

459
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:08,260
so I went over there,

460
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:11,710
but that was the longest full hours
airport because I figure she'll call the

461
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,090
police and just hid in the bathroom.

462
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:16,990
What happened had they not call the
police and never even occurred to them

463
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,730
because they were so worried about her.

464
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,571
They went to hospital.

465
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,040
Whether they probably
didn't know where you went.

466
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,170
They figured out they figured
out what's hiding somebody.

467
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:24,100
One of my cousin's house.

468
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,590
You think that they knew
that she was guilty too?

469
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,770
Oh,

470
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,920
everybody knows she's the returns.

471
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,450
How did you find out it was
your aunt that told you,

472
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:31,750
right?

473
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,290
Yeah.

474
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,550
It was her trying to poison him.

475
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:33,790
Huh?

476
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,001
Yeah.

477
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:35,020
Your aunt told you,

478
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:35,854
what did she say?

479
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,330
They have a medical record.

480
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,200
Someone this whole time.

481
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,590
Yeah.

482
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:38,771
Yeah,

483
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:40,060
but it doesn't mean she tried to kill him.

484
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:40,990
Oh No.

485
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,370
She tried to kill him
because of the poisoning.

486
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:43,690
Now that's pretty definitive.

487
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,230
Yeah.

488
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,700
And they had a medical lab.

489
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,001
Uh,

490
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:47,200
I don't know how they figure a poison,

491
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,090
but they took it to the lab.

492
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:49,280
Ever Eat Kimchi at Yoshi,

493
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:50,114
his house,

494
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,350
he keeps his daddy stabbing.

495
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,950
Kimchi in general is pretty strong.

496
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,390
I love Kimchi,

497
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,640
Kimchi at Yoshi cells and
it tastes a little weird.

498
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,683
Don't eat that shit.

499
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,401
Damn Dude.

500
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:02,050
So you escaped Japan.

501
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,740
Yeah.

502
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,520
And the other criminal
charges pressed against him.

503
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,430
Here's a weird thing.

504
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,260
Mostly comps in Japan doing or be a part
of like family dispute with technical.

505
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:12,430
She's still my family.

506
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,160
So whenever there's a
fan of me at each boot,

507
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:14,890
they'd rather,

508
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,920
there's even a fucking head stomping.

509
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,221
Well,

510
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:19,300
generally speaking,

511
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,433
but um,

512
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,840
I don't want to go back to Japan.

513
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:22,241
To find out.

514
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:23,440
So when remember you,

515
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:24,660
and I think Jody's it.

516
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:26,170
D has asked me and like the goal,

517
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:26,950
but you can translate.

518
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,090
I would love to do it,

519
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,700
but I was little worried.

520
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:31,270
Maybe as soon as I land,

521
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,240
there's a record of it and put me in jail.

522
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,151
There could be right?

523
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:34,720
There might be.

524
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,553
There might be.

525
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,000
You ready to record record?

526
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:06,331
Oh,

527
00:14:06,331 --> 00:14:07,164
it is already.

528
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,250
What the fuck's on?
