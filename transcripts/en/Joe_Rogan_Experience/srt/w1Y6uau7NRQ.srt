1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,260
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dr Chris Ryan.

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,520
Hello America. Hello Christopher.
We were just talking about, uh,

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,070
the pussy whipped phenomenon.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,360
We're talking about men who have
wives that answered their phones,

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,190
their cell phones. Not to be
helpful, like secretarial you. Hey,

6
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:27,060
let me get your phone. So I'm wondering
if there are, do to get off on that.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,360
Oh yeah, they have a mommy that takes care
of him. This guy is kind of like that.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,880
He, his wife, uh,

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,730
I called and it was the first time I'd
ever called him before off of this new

10
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:38,280
number and I think she
didn't have the number.

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,440
And so she answered it like
accusatory, like hello. He was like,

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,040
I was doing something wrong. I was selling
yourself dirty girl calling her man,

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,820
fuck is this. And I was just saying, hi,

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,140
I wished dirty girls called me. You just
got to put your number on the Internet.

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,910
They'll call you okay. Questions I
get, I get some dirty emails sometimes.

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,950
I prefer that. That's good cause
that you can control. Yeah.

17
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:07,740
And you don't know if you're
being catfished though
might be a right as long as

18
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:11,670
they're a nice picture. Give me
a fantasy. I'm reading a novel.

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,240
It's like you're reading the words of a
character that someone's created. Do it.

20
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,730
Well, you know, I don't care. I'm
never going to meet you anyhow.

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,460
And men would know what men
would actually be interested in.

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,810
Well that's the thing. I mean I had
to Bailey Jay on my podcast recently.

23
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:28,350
You know who she is? Yeah, she's coming
on mine. Oh good. She's, she's wonderful.

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,850
I really like her. And she was like, I
think she said her husband and straight.

25
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,750
Well let's explain who below. Sorry.
Yeah. Bailey. Jay's a trans woman.

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,760
A chick with a dick who doesn't give a
shit. What Pronoun you use. She does.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,170
She got upset at Gavin McInnes because
Gavin was calling her a he did.

28
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:49,590
She really? Yeah cause that's
his words though with me. She,

29
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,020
cause I asked her about that and
she was like, I don't give a shit.

30
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,040
She was really relaxed and funny.
That's, see Gavin says that,

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,610
but there could have been some other
things because he was being a Dick,

32
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,020
you know,
very possible.

33
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,680
He's the only guy I've ever had in the
podcast where two of my friends called me

34
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:07,410
up after the podcast and when
that's not true, this guy,

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,490
this is not what happened.

36
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:12,930
Let me tell you a Kurt Metzger and Jim
Norton both called me complaining that

37
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:17,100
what he said wasn't true. So he's a, he's
an interesting cat that Gavin, you know,

38
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:19,250
he is [inaudible] name's
ringing. It rings a bell, but I,

39
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,180
I've got a picture of him
but I can't remember who,

40
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:26,181
he was one of the original founders of
vice and they call him the godfather of

41
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:30,090
the hipster movement
because he dresses like,

42
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,490
like a really sharp dressed guy from
like the 1940s or something like that.

43
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,700
It was like vests and ties and tailored
suits and he has this crazy facial hair.

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,350
Yeah, okay. I've seen that. Yeah.
Dresses really nice. And he's super,

45
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,050
he's on the right wing side of things,
like very conservative and a lot of ways.

46
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:55,290
And he became a Catholic when
he was like in his forties.

47
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,790
It's a lot of weird shit going
on with that. For a woman
who, was it one of those?

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:02:59,980
No,

49
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,250
he was already married with kids and he,
he described it.

50
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,260
It was a very weird thing.

51
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,580
He said that he was like looking at his
daughter's foot and he realized that his,

52
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,710
like he's looking at his daughter's heal.

53
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,070
He realized that there is a
God I'm sure given more time,

54
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:19,210
he would like to express himself a little
more clearly in that regard. But um,

55
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,950
I have a feeling that a lot of these,
a lot of these right wing people that are,

56
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:27,580
um, that go pro religion, the, where
it doesn't make sense where they're,

57
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,590
they're like super analytical and rational
and kind of calculated about other

58
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:35,980
things.
But then when it comes to religion,

59
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:40,630
they just completely give in
and don't question it. And just,

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,150
I feel like it's an affiliation thing.

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,370
I feel like if you want to
be affiliated with the right,

62
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,810
you have to be religious.

63
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,560
And I think that they recognize that and
so they support because they know that

64
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:53,570
if you do that,
if you blindly affiliate yourself with,

65
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:58,571
with religion and if you want to be
like sort of an ingrained in the right,

66
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,750
you kind of have to be religious is very
few people that are conservative or on

67
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:08,170
the right that are atheists or agnostics.
Right.

68
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,920
And you're right, there's much more
unity on the right and the left,

69
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:12,660
everybody's stabbing
each other in the back,

70
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,860
which is why assholes rule the world
essentially. They stick together and well,

71
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,980
it's disturbing to me.
And I've got some people coming up,

72
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:23,550
some interesting podcast guests
that are going to talk about,

73
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,400
and I talked about it with Dave Ruben
recently where he calls it and you know,

74
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,420
Dave's an interesting example because
he is a gay man who is a very,

75
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,210
he's across the board on a lot of
different issues. He's like, he's,

76
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,550
he's pro second amendment.
He's, you know, he's like,

77
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,820
he's relaxed and analytical and a,

78
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:45,550
he calls it the regressive left.
And he's like,

79
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,900
it's almost like they'd been fighting
against the right so long they've become

80
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:51,370
their own version of that.

81
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,000
They have been fighting against like
the religious right or the super ultra

82
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:58,990
conservative regressive, right. That
they've become the regressive left.

83
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,210
And I think he's got some
good points in that regard.

84
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,190
Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I try to
get away from thinking left.

85
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:09,430
Right. You know, because
to me it's more tolerant,

86
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:13,510
intolerance [inaudible] and you
know, since sex at dawn came out, I,

87
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,910
I expected a lot of
blowback from the right.

88
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,930
And actually most of the blowback we've
received has been from the left. Really?

89
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,690
Yeah. From, yeah, because all the
political correctness, you know,

90
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,450
you're a cisgendered white male with your,
you know, mansplaining, blah blah blah.

91
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,530
You know what mansplaining tell
people that don't know though.

92
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,050
It's like the, the arrogant guy who
explains everything, knows everything,

93
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:42,550
you know. Well, if you explain things
and you're a married man, mansplaining,

94
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,880
you know what I was thinking
about recently and I don't
want to get into like a

95
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,000
men's rights thing. You
know, cause I mean there's,

96
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,240
there's a lot to be said
there. But anyway, I was
thinking about man spreading.

97
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,090
You know what that is on
the subways and stuff. We

98
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,240
sit with your legs open, you take up too
much space. Here's the problem with that.

99
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,160
Hey, men are generally bigger
than women, be men have balls.

100
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,110
Where are we supposed to put our balls?
If you can't spread what your legs,

101
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:13,410
where do your balls go?

102
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,740
Well the idea is that you're
being rude though because you're,

103
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:20,690
you should like keep your boss compress
the people next to you aren't, you know,

104
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,940
they aren't in encroached upon.
But yeah,

105
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,120
tell you what my balls are getting
encroached upon and that's got a very

106
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:32,870
immediate effect.
I think that's true.

107
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:35,270
But the meanwhile the
seats are what they are.

108
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,250
And so for a very short amount of time,

109
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:40,460
just think of it as an exercise
in your inner thigh development.

110
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,380
Just keep them pinched and work on like
an isometric tension sort of a thing.

111
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:47,720
Yeah, I just think about it like
putting someone in my guard,

112
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,440
like I'm trying to hold a triangle,
right. To keep my legs closed. Well look,

113
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:52,430
I'll go with it.

114
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,200
If it becomes socially acceptable for me
to put my hand down my pants and pulled

115
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:59,540
my balls up before I crossed my legs,
you know, I think he's just do that.

116
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,720
Well I do do that, but you know,
it freaks. Then I shake their hand.

117
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,100
You should have like a ball grabbing
glove that you could just sort of snap.

118
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:14,840
I'm about to give myself a prostate
exams is only so that when I shake your

119
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:18,980
hand, you know? Yeah, yeah. It's, it's,

120
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,590
the design sucks.
The design of the male body,

121
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,990
like the balls in the
outside is really stupid.

122
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,760
I think it's the design of the
fucking seats. I'm fine with my balls.

123
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,640
Oh, that vulnerable. Yeah. From
A, from a fighter's perspective.

124
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,533
Yeah.
Too Bad.

125
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,830
The most vulnerable part of your body
next to your brain and they're, well,

126
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,620
you know why they're there. Right.
Keep it cool. Keep him cool. Right?

127
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,130
So that your boys are ready
to roll at a moment's notice.

128
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:47,960
You've always got I insects it done.

129
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,260
We say the external scrotum
is the equivalent of a beer.

130
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,310
Have a fridge in your garage full of
beer and he say you got a spare fridge is

131
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:00,920
always ready to go cause you never know
when the guys are coming over to watch

132
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:04,550
the game. You got to have a couple
of cases cool and ready to go. Right.

133
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:08,450
You can't just pop your nuts out when
you think about having sex later on that

134
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,040
night and like sperm cool off, but
still another shitty design. Like why,

135
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,710
why?
You know and it's on every animal.

136
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,620
Like every mammal has balls
in the outside. Well No,

137
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:23,000
not everyone like gorillas there in
the abdomen actually. Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,380
They have such tiny dicks.

139
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,190
Tiny little dicks and see that's why
because but the male gorillas twice the

140
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:30,590
size of the female, I didn't know
their balls were in their abdomen.

141
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,120
Chimps are hanging out, chimps are out,
bonobos are out and they're huge giant.

142
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:39,470
They're like chicken eggs. That's because
they're, the females are permissive Qa,

143
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,200
so you got to the balls
outside of the body.

144
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:46,250
That's an indication of female promiscuity
and I knew it was the size of the

145
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:48,770
testicles was indicator
of female promiscuity.

146
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:51,680
I didn't know the balls outside the body.
So ladies,

147
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:54,650
if you don't let God man's plating,
how about you stop being horse?

148
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,770
If you weren't, we won't man spread.
If you weren't holding around,

149
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,750
we wouldn't need our
ball's in the outside.

150
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,030
We could suck our balls
up into our abdomen.

151
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:06,060
If you girls just keep your
fucking leg shot. How about that?

152
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,700
Do you ever see a Yogi do
that? Oh No, they do that.

153
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,980
Their balls in the air boss if you seen
it. No, I don't think it exists. Jamie,

154
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:16,080
find out if a guy can
pull. Yeah, I read it too.

155
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,710
They used to be a thing about weight.
She root karate like wait, she rue guys,

156
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:23,460
supposedly they would have these Katas
and in the [inaudible] they would be able

157
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:27,930
to suck their balls up into their body
to to prevent them from getting kicked.

158
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,260
I've never seen it.
I feel like I would have saw it already.

159
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,470
A big fan of any ball sucking.
Actually none.

160
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,220
Well now cause it hurts.
Well if a girl does it gentle,

161
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:42,060
she's good at it and she's got like the
upward stroke stroking thing while she's

162
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:44,310
sucking on your sac.
It's not a bad check.

163
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,650
I've never popped a
woody on the show before.

164
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,920
Some gals have skin, that's all
I'm trying to say. The, you know,

165
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:54,630
it's like we're not all created equal.

166
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,580
Whether it's basketball or painting or
Dick Sucking. Where are the artists?

167
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,590
We started this we, you said something
about what? Never tried to follow the sun,

168
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,450
follow the breadcrumb role.
Because I mean for some reason,

169
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:14,451
five minutes ago of the thought I had the
thought like I remembered some gay guy

170
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,200
saying to me like gay guys give
better blowjobs and then women do.

171
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,670
Or maybe he was by,

172
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,180
oh we were talking about someone sending
you a letter catfishing you pretending

173
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:29,130
to be a woman when they're really a man.
Oh. And then you said if it's a dude,

174
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:30,300
he knows what gets you off.

175
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,300
That reminded me of this thing
and I was thinking like, yeah,

176
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:38,080
I'll bet I'll bet dude's give great.
Blowjobs I would imagine. Yeah.

177
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,100
And Women Lesbians report much higher
orgasmic frequency then straight women do.

178
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,480
And it's the same thing.
Right?

179
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:48,540
Or like a woman knows how to go down
on a woman where guys are just like,

180
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,850
I don't know what to
do. I blow on it. Yeah,

181
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,640
it makes sense.
But isn't that like a communication thing?

182
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:59,280
Like you tell people what you
like and why it feels good. Yeah.

183
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,540
Some people just not good at
communicating sexually. It's,

184
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,820
it's interesting because it's like one
of the few things that people can be like

185
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:09,060
really embarrassed about communicating
about what it's like people tell you what

186
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:11,130
kind of, what colors they like. You know,

187
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:15,570
I don't like a couch that's white by
car has got to be black, you know,

188
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:18,690
like weird rules when it comes
to like things that they enjoy.

189
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,030
But when it comes to sex,
they're really,

190
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:23,370
it's really hard for people to
express what they enjoy. Yeah.

191
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:26,460
I dinner last night with a sex therapist
and we were talking about that and

192
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:29,490
she's like, she was like, you
know, I've got people come in,

193
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:34,260
they've been married 25 years and they've
never talked about like what position

194
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:38,370
works, you know, or you know, that
she doesn't like it when you do that.

195
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,440
You've been doing it 25 years.
She gets off on this

196
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,470
con punch. Yeah, yeah. It is.

197
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,680
It's a weird thing. Sex, you know,

198
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,310
it's weird you wanting someone to touch
your body in a way that's pleasurable

199
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,250
and it really

200
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,020
is sort of ultimately based about
around reproduction. I mean,

201
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:02,830
that's what the whole feeling and
sensitivity is ultimately about naturally

202
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,230
the, and was, yeah.

203
00:12:04,231 --> 00:12:09,231
I mean we argue in sex at dawn that that
in human sexuality got co-opted away

204
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:14,740
from reproduction towards social uses.
Yeah, definitely. Without a doubt. Yeah.

205
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,080
But originally you, right. I mean,

206
00:12:16,081 --> 00:12:19,050
that's why the all the nerve endings are
there and you know, all that business.

207
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,880
But even that like you could argue that
the having it been co opted and having

208
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:28,750
it move away from just being
about reproductive, uh, the,

209
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,130
the,

210
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:34,080
the pleasure being tied into
being a reproductive mechanism.

211
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,530
It's still about reproductive
even if it's socially,

212
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:40,680
because in the social
thing it's one part of,

213
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:45,040
of greater pattern of things that set
in place to make sure that you have the

214
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,000
preferred mate, you know,
like socially as well.

215
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,260
Like seeing how someone interacts with
someone socially, seeing how someone,

216
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,440
all those things are like sort of set
up this like very complex dance of

217
00:12:59,491 --> 00:13:04,491
interaction between men and women where
you're trying to figure out like what is

218
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:09,020
the best case scenario for someone that
you're going to get together with that

219
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,930
you're going to establish some sort of
a really intense relationship and bond

220
00:13:12,931 --> 00:13:16,510
with. And the most intense at the,
ultimately, at least the, the most, um,

221
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,940
the most committed is having a child. You
have to take care of together, you know,

222
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:24,630
cause then you're not just committed to
it in a sense of I love you and you love

223
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:27,720
me, but now we have to take
care of people, you know?

224
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:31,680
And so now we have to sort of abandon our
own needs to take care of these people

225
00:13:31,681 --> 00:13:32,400
as well.

226
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,400
And we've kind of gotten this position
by virtue of our being able to socially

227
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,060
jive with each other.

228
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,090
Yeah.
I,

229
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,380
I would argue and have argued
that in hunter gatherer times,

230
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,880
that sort of nuclear family thing
that you're positing the, you know,

231
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,120
mother,
father child is much more fluid.

232
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,730
And so women weren't really
that concerned about uh,

233
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,620
a mate in that sort of long term sense.

234
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,860
You're talking about like
tribal situations for teachers,

235
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,270
which is 95% or more of our
existence as a species. Right?

236
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,660
So it's, so what I argue in,
in sex at dawn is that it's,

237
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,490
there's more dispersed
responsibility for childcare.

238
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,270
That food is shared, that defense
is shared, everything shared.

239
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,280
And that really freaks out 20th century
and 21st century Western scientist

240
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:29,330
because it smacks of communism. You
know, but that's simply the fact.

241
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:34,250
If you look at hunter gatherers that still
exist or, um, you know, even Banabos,

242
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:37,370
right? One of the primates most
closely related to us, they share food,

243
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,600
very egalitarian, right? And, uh,

244
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:45,380
so I think that the,
the woman,

245
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,740
a woman's admiration for a man
isn't necessarily attraction

246
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,641
for the man.

247
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:57,641
So she might be fucking a dude who's
actually genetically more compatible with

248
00:14:58,011 --> 00:14:59,650
her.
But you know,

249
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,460
she spends more time with another guy
and you see that played out in marriages

250
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:07,940
now, like a woman Mary, uh,
Hugh grant kind of dude,

251
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,870
but when she's ovulating showground
Fucker, Brad Pitt look into, you know,

252
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:16,100
square jaw testosterone
indications, right? Because the,

253
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,480
the vigor of his genetics,

254
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,880
it turns her on when she's on [inaudible],
when she's not ovulating,

255
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,370
she finds it kind of vulgar and
she's more into the other dude.

256
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,550
So like women's taste
is really interesting.

257
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,023
This woman,
uh,

258
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,210
tweeted something the other day and
I respond to as a really interesting,

259
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,140
she's an author and she was saying,
uh,

260
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:41,270
that women like men complain
that sometimes when men
and women are together for

261
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:45,550
a long periods of time that the woman
no longer wants to have sex, right?

262
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,640
She goes, well, why is it so obvious to
men that they want genetic diversity?

263
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:52,710
Right?
They want to spread their seed,

264
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,190
but when a woman is done with your DNA,

265
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,510
like she's already had kids with you,
she's going to want Dick from other dudes.

266
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,360
Like it makes sense that
she would want other DNA.

267
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,810
Like why would it be that she
would only want kids from one man?

268
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,930
And she said she googled it and
she couldn't find it anywhere.

269
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:13,530
And I think actually you and I had
discussed this once like this idea,

270
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,990
but it totally makes sense,
right?

271
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,600
Yeah, sure. I mean genetic
diversity is a big thing.

272
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:23,850
I think I just pulled out my
digit. Oh, that earplug. Um,

273
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,620
we'll figure it out Jamie.
It's just pop right in there.

274
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,000
I just moved my foot and something pumped.
Oh, it connects over there. Sorry folks.

275
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,740
No worries. No, I didn't even know
you can hear. I just heard a good,

276
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,240
crazy. Yeah. Um, what are
we talking about? The, uh,

277
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,440
genetic diversity. Yeah. Yeah. Did I
ever tell you about the, the goats study,

278
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,620
the goat sheep study?
And I'm going to great when it's in a,

279
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:51,100
it was took place in Scotland.
And do you need a light?

280
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,333
Um,

281
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,970
they wanted to understand this sort of
like how males and females differ in

282
00:16:57,971 --> 00:17:02,760
their ad app. Adoptation
to, uh, like how they,

283
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,560
how they're,
how they imprint sexually.

284
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,800
So what they did was they took the babies,

285
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,940
all the babies born one year from the
sheep herd and put them in the goat herd

286
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,880
and then they took all the baby goats
and put them in the sheep herd. Oh yeah,

287
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:20,650
we did talk. We do it. So in the
end, the males were fixed, right?

288
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:24,580
They would only have sex with the
one that they had grown up with,

289
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:27,490
but the females were like, whatever, put
me with the goats, I'll fuck the goats,

290
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,990
the sheep, or if I was here
and I don't care. So there's,

291
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:33,910
there's just this fluidity in female
sexual response that in males you don't

292
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:36,460
have. And we talked, I
think last time I was on,

293
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,420
we talked about fetishes and how
like almost all fetishists are men.

294
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,730
Yeah. I'm going to get that
girl on. That's Sierra Cetera.

295
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,710
Sierra Lynch. Oh, you're
going to have her on.

296
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,420
I need to hear about the humiliation and
all this crazy shit that she has these

297
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:56,400
guys pay her to do. It just sounds so
bizarre. I need to hear about this.

298
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,290
But um, you know, like you're
talking about the porn star earlier.

299
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,610
Not this year is a porn star per se,
but she's so sweet and nice and like,

300
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,410
sure. You know, she's just really, she's
probably just unreal pressed as well,

301
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:13,500
you know? I mean, she's
just, her life is so bizarre.

302
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,690
And in comparison to the average person
that's sometimes I think we have all

303
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:22,020
these like self-imposed borders
that we put on our behavior.

304
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,630
And I think that's one of the
reasons why someone like her exists.

305
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:27,780
Like you're a release valve
for all this pressure, this,

306
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,500
this repression that a
lot of it is self imposed.

307
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,900
And so we try to find some sort of an
outlet for all their kinky weird shit that

308
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:41,030
that really builds up almost like a
residue of our mundane suppress society.

309
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,060
Yeah. And it builds up precisely
because it's repressed, right?

310
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,750
Like that's what this sex therapists last
night was saying to me, it's like if,

311
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,960
if people have a way
to express this energy,

312
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,350
then it doesn't become problematic because
it doesn't build up. It's, you know,

313
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:01,350
like if dude wants to dress up
in women's clothes or whatever,

314
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:02,460
and his wife's cool with it.

315
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,670
Like every once in a while he dresses up
and I'm like, okay, whatever. That's cool.

316
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,590
But if she would freak out, it starts
to become a big issue in his life.

317
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,250
Last time I was on, I think we
talked about, um, I had the,

318
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,450
have this theory of how some people have
like a homosexuality fetish as opposed

319
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:23,460
to being born homosexual.

320
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Did I must have gotten 30 or 40 emails
from an after that saying too that to me,

321
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:33,800
I've never heard anyone
describe that. That's me. And
now I'm getting a lot of, um,

322
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,970
gotten several really moving emails from,
uh,

323
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,870
men who are attracted to kids
and what they're saying is like,

324
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,730
look, I, you know, I know you,

325
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,140
you sympathize with people who can't
help what they feel right. Which is true.

326
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,880
I feel this, I don't ever want to act
on it. I don't want to ever do anything,

327
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,200
but I can't tell anyone.

328
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,340
I can't go to a therapist because they
by law have to like turn me in the

329
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:04,090
culture. So like freaked about
anything around, you know,

330
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:09,290
sex and kids that we're shooting ourselves
in the foot because we're not giving

331
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:14,250
these guys away to,
to let some of that energy vent off.

332
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,163
We have to,

333
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,260
I think we have to admit that there's
something going on in the mind that causes

334
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:25,860
this and they have to figure out
what that is. We'll almost always,

335
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:29,340
it's guys who got abused themselves.
Did you, these guys say that?

336
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:33,780
Were they saying that? So what is
it when you get abused as a child,

337
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,650
I could trigger something in you and
then that that becomes attached to

338
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:40,920
sexuality. Yeah, I think, I mean, I'm,

339
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,450
I haven't done any research,
original research. I've
read a lot of papers, right?

340
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:48,130
So take it for what it's worth.
My

341
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:53,130
feeling is that it's like what we talked
about last time with fetishes that you

342
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:57,310
have, there's a developmental
period, uh, for boys,

343
00:20:57,311 --> 00:21:02,311
somewhere between five and 10 years of
age where inexperience can imprint on you

344
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,880
permanently.
And so that could be expressed as like,

345
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:10,530
you need to smell latex to get
off, or you need to, you know,

346
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,130
be treated by humiliated by, you know,
by somebody like Sierra or, you know,

347
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:19,120
whatever it is. And, or it
could be you need to, like,

348
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:23,260
you want to have a sexual experience
with a man even though you're not gay

349
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,480
because you had that experience when
you were seven and that, you know,

350
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,150
imprinted on you. Um, and uh, so,

351
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:34,270
and that's what that goat sheep thing
is about, right? They wanted to say,

352
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,500
they wanted to understand like is
this a male mammalian thing? Right.

353
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,460
And so that's where they're looking at
different species where yeah, these males,

354
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,290
even though their goats,

355
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,330
they were with sheep when they came of
age sexually and for the rest of their

356
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:52,650
lives, they can only fuck shape,
you know? Well, what is it with

357
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,800
women then if it's a man,
a male mammalian thing,

358
00:21:55,801 --> 00:21:59,070
because many women when they're young,
if they're sexually abused,

359
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,100
they associate sex with worth and they
become hypersexual at a very early age.

360
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:10,560
They've, they, they, they're more
prone to masturbating at an early age.

361
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,460
I,

362
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,460
I think that's more a psychological
with the males I think in,

363
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,860
and of course there are many
exceptions to what I'm saying,

364
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:23,550
but I think with males it's more just
a question of imprint. It's there.

365
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:27,390
You can't change it. So it might be
latex, it might be red, high heels,

366
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:31,070
it might be big tits or whatever.
And more of a fetish thing, right?

367
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,760
A fetish thing.
Whereas,

368
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,480
and so if you were
sexually abused as a kid,

369
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,320
the thing is,
all right,

370
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,560
you're a seven year old boy
and your priest Suck Your Dick,

371
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,890
right? It's, it's freaky. It's bizarre.

372
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,070
But it feels good because
those nerve endings are there,

373
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,500
no matter how weird the situation is,

374
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:57,150
there's a physiological pleasure
associated with it. So, and also,

375
00:22:57,151 --> 00:23:00,120
when you're seven, you don't
know how weird it is. You
don't know what's going on,

376
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:01,170
right? You just know like, wow,

377
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,290
that felt great and this guy
likes me and I'm special.

378
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:08,730
And so it imprints on
a neurological level.

379
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,840
Whereas with girls, I think
what happens is, you know,

380
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,600
Daddy's really nice to
me when this happens.

381
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,380
Daddy really likes it when I do that,
and I love Daddy.

382
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,040
And so those sorts of connections
are made on the level of personality.

383
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:28,170
God Damn. Yeah, it's, it's
heavy. But I to deal with it,

384
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,020
we can't, can't push this side
isn't real. Right. Yeah. Right,

385
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,290
right. Yeah. Yeah. That is the
issue, right? Like how do you,

386
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,540
how do you mitigate that imprinting
when it comes to like how they interface

387
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,980
with society?
Like how do you,

388
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,040
how do you figure out a way
that you recognize the fact

389
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,120
that they do have this issue and this
issue was an imprinting issue because of

390
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:54,050
sexual molestation as a young
person and how do, how do you,

391
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:58,910
how do you deal with that and uh,
and somehow or another, I mean,

392
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,980
I wonder what, if anything
could fit. I mean, what,

393
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:07,130
I wonder if they've ever done
any studies on psychedelics,

394
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,030
like really intense ones,
like a boga and things along those lines,

395
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,180
like how that reacts to people or how
people react to that when they have those

396
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:20,800
kinds of issues. Well, I think
that's the way we need to,

397
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,310
to look,
because I mean,

398
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:25,610
I just finished writing a chapter on
psychedelics in this book I'm working on

399
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:26,090
now.

400
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:31,090
And one of the big points is that
psychedelics are really good for breaking

401
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,970
addiction and addictive behavior,
especially a booger. Right?

402
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,330
It bill is great because it's
so intense. Yeah. But I mean I,

403
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:42,690
Wasc is grades Psilocybin,
you know, different, but he,

404
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,060
vogue is famous for it.

405
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,810
The idea I think is that
these boundary disillusioning,

406
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,900
these boundary dissolving rather a
experiences are so intense that whatever

407
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,720
patterns you had that were there before,

408
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,860
they've sort of been dissolved for at
least at least a short period of time.

409
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,970
You know, I, I've, I've,

410
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:06,230
I was described a really
intense psychedelic experiences
as being like a reset

411
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:09,650
button. Like you're pressing
control, alt delete on your brain.

412
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,660
And then when your brain reboots,

413
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,670
you're left with a blank desktop with
one folder in it and that folders labeled

414
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:17,930
mild bullshit.

415
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,980
And then in that my old bullshit
folder with a think of it,

416
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,160
you have to decide like,
what do I do? Do I do? I, um,

417
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:30,250
look at this folder and look at it like
an outsider and just try to see what is

418
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:31,250
useful,
if anything,

419
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:35,270
about my old bullshit or do I fall
right back into these comfortable old

420
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:39,410
patterns because those are all I've known
for x amount of years of my life until

421
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:41,260
now.
I think for a lot of people,

422
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:46,040
they have these big experiences in these
big breakthrough moments and then they

423
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,350
go, I'm going to be new. I'm going
to be different. I'm gonna Change.

424
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,240
And then it's too uncomfortable.

425
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:53,570
And then there's too much time between
that experience and the next one.

426
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,740
And they slowly slide right back
into my old bullshit. Yeah. At least,

427
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,390
at least partially, you know,
at least in some way fall,

428
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,440
fall prey to the victim of the
patterns of, of, of their past.

429
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:11,210
That's why it's so cool
to have ritualized, uh,

430
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,690
sort of culturally approved use,

431
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,960
like the piety and the habitual Leanne's
right where every year they go to the

432
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:22,961
desert and as they're going out to gather
the piety every night around the fire,

433
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,570
they confess everything they've
done that year. That was wrong.

434
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,290
So they like cleanse themselves,
you know,

435
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:36,830
and then they take the pod and they
have that experience, which, you know,

436
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,920
I think that sort of sequential
ritual helps to seal in the changes,

437
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:47,550
the benefits, you know? Whereas with us
like, okay, you go to Peru, you do it,

438
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:51,060
you're back, you're back
in your old patterns. Yeah.

439
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:55,050
We've talked about this before. Rites of
passage, you know, rites of passage for,

440
00:26:55,051 --> 00:27:00,051
for adults that I think that these
moments of celebration and ceremony that

441
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:02,260
sometimes they can be like
really beneficial because they,

442
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:05,820
they physically mark like
a big change in your life.

443
00:27:05,821 --> 00:27:07,320
Like it makes this thing,

444
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,440
this new thing that becomes a
part of your life. It's just my,

445
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:16,770
my phone has decided to transcribe
everything I'm saying here. Look at this,

446
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,450
see what's going on here. I
must've said, Hey Siri. Wow.

447
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,710
Because look at this.
Yeah.

448
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,910
You sure the NSA isn't turning on?
Well, what are they going to do?

449
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,650
And they can just listen to the podcast
and then transcribe and let 'em, hey,

450
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:35,910
Siri has this new thing. Like,
like, watch, I'll show you
this. This is bizarre. Like,

451
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:40,320
I don't even, excuse me, I'm talking
when you're not on microphone, you fuck,

452
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,230
you're not Siri. Um, I can say it
into it and when I say it into it,

453
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:47,250
we'll call you like, Hey
Siri, call Chris Ryan.

454
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,300
My number is not going to come up as it.
Yeah. Which ones got more than one phone?

455
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,290
Oh, there's a bunch of
Ryan's. Chris Ryan, you fuck

456
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,090
writes Chris Ryan,
you fuck,

457
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,390
I mean Chris Ryan, the
first one. Douchebag.

458
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,910
Oh Bam. It is, it listened to me. I said,

459
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,660
think about all those words that I said,
the first one douche bag.

460
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,810
Like get figured out how to do that.
So I was on stage in a,

461
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,330
uh, the comedy store and I was
explaining how crazy phones are now.

462
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,380
So I said, I'm going to show you something
and time I made this recording and uh,

463
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:34,591
you know,

464
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:38,010
I record all my sets because I'm always
working on new material and blah, blah,

465
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:42,840
blah. So anyways, I'm on stage and I said,
now, watch this. I go, you know, Hey Siri,

466
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:47,130
call Brian Cowen. And so it starts
calling Brian Cowen while I'm onstage,

467
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,810
but I made a recording of this,

468
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:53,310
so I'm listening to recording in
my car as I'm driving. So my car,

469
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,500
my phone is playing in my car.

470
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:59,760
The recording through the Bluetooth
and it says in the recording,

471
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,020
hey Siri call Brian counts.
So while the recording's going on,

472
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,460
my fucking phone starts
calling Brian Cowen. Like how,

473
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:11,940
but that's an endless loop right? There
isn't endless. It's too poor. Brian.

474
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:14,610
And Chuck was getting all
these weird phone calls. Yeah,

475
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,280
it's a put it on airplane
mode so it doesn't work.

476
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,960
But how strange that you can
just talk to your phone now.

477
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:25,650
Like you need to have to press a
button anymore. Well, I got a nice, uh,

478
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:30,150
I mean Google has these new nexus phones.
I just ordered one.

479
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,510
And the main reason I ordered
it is they've also got this,

480
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,420
I forget what it's called,
f y or something.

481
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,720
It's a a plan that they only do with
their phones where it's 20 bucks a month,

482
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:42,250
unlimited

483
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,750
text and voice and then you pay, I
think it's 10 bucks a Gig for um, data,

484
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:47,763
you know,

485
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,990
but it automatically picks whatever
network is strongest where you are.

486
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:56,860
So it flips from Verizon at and t to
sprint, whatever. As you're moving,

487
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,740
as soon as you get home,
it automatically goes to your Wifi.

488
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,550
It always picks Wifi when possible.
Whoa.

489
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,200
So it's designed to keep your
bills as small as possible.

490
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:08,920
And here's why I got it.
It's the same all over the world.

491
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,000
So I don't have like I've always had
a Spanish phone, an American phone.

492
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,960
Then I got an unlocked phone with two
sim cards and then I have to switch and

493
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:18,580
then the Sim card expires. What? You know,

494
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:21,250
cause I haven't been to Spain for a
while and then it's a big fucking pain in

495
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:21,850
the ass.

496
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,870
This is like one phone around the world
and this is all through Google's all

497
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:26,704
through Google.

498
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:31,080
I guess Google has deals with
the various skynet dude there.

499
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:35,050
So terrifying. They're slowly but surely
buying up all these android companies,

500
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:36,750
they're buying up robotics companies are,

501
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,750
but they're working on artificial
intelligence and working on drivable cars.

502
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,750
Cars that drive themselves.
She,

503
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,930
yesterday they invited me to come and
speak at their headquarters and where the

504
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:49,720
fuck they going to ask for your DNA?
No, it's, you know what they do?

505
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,300
So they asked me to come and give a talk
and I'm like, fuck yeah, Google. Wow.

506
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,350
All right. And then we go back and
forth a few times and then there,

507
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,910
and then I said,
I'd like to bring my wife as well,

508
00:30:58,911 --> 00:31:03,040
and she'd love to see the headquarters
and then it's like, oh, um, you,

509
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:06,030
we don't have a budget for travel.
Um,

510
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,590
can you fly yourself to San Francisco?

511
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,760
Google, does it have the fuck I'm
going to give a talk for free, right.

512
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:20,920
Giving you a day on my life and you
want me to pay my flight? Google.

513
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,510
You don't even have a flight.
Money guys have fucking spaceship money.

514
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,200
Exactly.
I mean,

515
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:33,760
I want to come under the seats as maybe
it was like some Google employee that

516
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:35,050
wasn't,
they weren't,

517
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,370
you know, they didn't get, well, that's
why I said, I mean, I said like, oh,

518
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:42,300
I thought this was an official Google
event. Right, and I don't have time.

519
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:47,130
You know, if it's a thing,
and he's like, no, this isn't
official event. And like, how

520
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:52,040
are you fucking kidding. I don't get
it. It's Google. That's so retarded.

521
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,900
That's unbelievably retarded.

522
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,470
The fact that they would think that that
would be okay, that you would just go,

523
00:31:57,471 --> 00:32:02,000
yeah, I'll spend money for you.
Sure. Fly to this gigantic campus.

524
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:06,530
It's worth billions of dollars as you
siphon up all the world's resources and

525
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:11,270
develop the Uber Manch robot. Kim,
let me bring you lunch. You know,

526
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,320
how about I suck your Dick on there
too. I mean, I'm a man. I'm good at it.

527
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,680
That's my rose. I know it's done well.
You know, that was like the argument for,

528
00:32:21,681 --> 00:32:25,700
there's a lot of these festivals
like south by southwest
and now that we're like,

529
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,270
they put on these gigantic festivals
and they don't pay the artists,

530
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,410
they don't have any money, but it's owned
by South West, like south by southwest,

531
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:36,830
like southwest airlines sponsoring the
whole thing and they don't even fly you

532
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:40,430
there. I'm like, you can't
fly me on your own airline

533
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,400
to your thing where you want me to
work for free because it's out of your

534
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:48,020
fucking mind. But because it's
like a big deal to be there,

535
00:32:48,021 --> 00:32:51,920
a lot of people just say, I just want to
be a part of this. And they go anywhere.

536
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,570
Fair enough. But, and, and I, I'm sure
you get these pitches all the time.

537
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:59,500
What's this thing? Summit? Yeah,
same deal. Right? You know,

538
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:01,930
it's like up to the mountain or
go on the cruise or whatever.

539
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:07,000
But what pisses me off is they don't
tell you up front the first four or five

540
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:11,950
exchanges, you're under the impression
that this is a paying gig. Right.

541
00:33:11,951 --> 00:33:15,640
And then when you've already talked about
dates and how great it's going to be

542
00:33:15,641 --> 00:33:20,560
and the that it, ah, then it's like, oh,
buy and they make you bring up money.

543
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,740
You know, you've got an agent
who does it, but you know,

544
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:26,440
I was doing it myself and it's like,
you know,

545
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,970
we've been going back and forth and I have
to ask you like, you know, by the way,

546
00:33:30,971 --> 00:33:34,600
I, you know, my standard fee is x. Oh no,

547
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:37,270
this is because you get to
meet all these great people.

548
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,900
You're charging money
for tickets. Like, yeah,

549
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,780
we'll have to pay to go to this
thing. Exactly. And I'm the attraction

550
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:48,010
they're paying so they can meet me.
Yeah.

551
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,450
So welcome to the future. Well,
there's a lot of that going on. I mean,

552
00:33:52,451 --> 00:33:55,690
Jamie and I were just discussing that
actually before the show started about

553
00:33:55,691 --> 00:33:59,830
these companies that are
trying to capitalize on
podcasts where they're coming

554
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:04,470
along, they're trying to take a piece of
the action and offer some non-existence

555
00:34:04,471 --> 00:34:05,051
service.

556
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:09,040
It's going to connect to you with more
fans and in exchange for a piece of the

557
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:09,821
show.
And I'm like,

558
00:34:09,821 --> 00:34:14,821
they're just banking on the fact that it
seems good because it's a big company.

559
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:20,370
Like there's something attached to being
attached to a big company when actually

560
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:24,910
the contrary is true. It's, it's, it's a
bad thing to be attached to a big company.

561
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,330
Then you have to meet with all these
people and they get to decide which

562
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:32,590
direction your shit goes in and like,
Ooh. And that's summit thing, man.

563
00:34:32,591 --> 00:34:35,380
I got an email and I think,
I think you were in it.

564
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,730
It was a bunch of faces on the email.
Like are you on the website? Are you

565
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,550
well fucking hope not cause I, I
said no. Well I don't know man.

566
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:46,520
There was a lot of people that were on
it that I was looking at that was like,

567
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:49,490
what the fuck? You know, I was
looking at it and then I was like,

568
00:34:49,491 --> 00:34:51,860
this seems like very strange.

569
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:54,860
Like there's a lot of people involved
in this thing. Hold on. Yeah.

570
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:58,700
Well they invited me to go on this
cruise, which is next week, I think.

571
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,570
And you know it,

572
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:04,190
it is like they've got a lot of heavy
hitters going on the cruise, right.

573
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:07,760
As you know, whatever. Not Presenters,

574
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:11,450
but it's like the CEO of Google
is going to be there and you know,

575
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,590
Mark Zuckerberg or somebody, I all kind
of people Hancock's on this thing, right?

576
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,370
Hmm. Yeah. Well if they told
him he thinks he's getting paid.

577
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,670
Yeah.
There's a lot of people in this thing.

578
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,990
It seemed like they should be getting
paid. I mean, this is a, it is,

579
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,340
it's a very impressive
lineup of human beings.

580
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,970
Yeah. Maybe they pay some of them and
I'm just like not in the pay grade,

581
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,500
you know?
I don't know.

582
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,680
Well, I don't know either, but

583
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,810
I mean, I guess it would kind of make
sense if it was free for everybody.

584
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,460
Well, if you, or if you're, you're,

585
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,580
you're not playing anymore is about like,
you need to like,

586
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,160
like let's say like Ted,
it does this too, right?

587
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:54,720
It's all the networking opportunity.

588
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,710
So if you're like a guy with an idea
and you need investors than fuck, yeah,

589
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,410
that's a great thing to do.
But if you're an entertainer,

590
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:03,870
you've got your own
audience. Like, I mean,

591
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:06,930
I'm not looking for billionaires
to listen to my podcast.

592
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,660
That's not really my
demographic, you know? Yeah.

593
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,830
So there's really nothing in it for me
unless the billionaire is interested.

594
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,723
But you know,

595
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,480
they're an individual at that one point
in time that just a person that might

596
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,980
happen to be rich, like Richard Branson
started listening to your podcast,

597
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:25,230
you wouldn't be bummed out.
I'm like, oh, that's cool.

598
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,690
He seems like an interesting guy.
Like it wouldn't be like,

599
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:32,190
what an awesome opportunity to network
and now pitch him my startup, you know?

600
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:35,220
And that's what a lot of these people
are doing. Whenever I hear that term,

601
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,050
you know, I'm involved in a
startup. I just want to run
in the opposite direction.

602
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,250
Just fucking flee.
I didn't even know what you just said.

603
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,150
I gotta get the fuck away from you before
you hit me with some emails about some

604
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:49,590
shit that I don't give a fuck about.
Yeah. Actually. I mean I bad mouth Ted,

605
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:53,970
but I did become very good friends with
the billionaire there. There you go.

606
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:57,540
And he's like, I've been on his yacht
the bunch of times and it's great.

607
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,830
And he network. And here's the
cool thing, this guy, I mean,

608
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:05,970
I don't know if he's a billionaire,
but he lives on 130 foot yacht. Okay.

609
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:07,770
Which is like,
it has a gym.

610
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,300
Well that alone is probably worth
hundreds of millions of dollars. Uh,

611
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,310
I don't know. I'm not
appointing yeah. Cars.

612
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,820
But this is like a Russian oligarch Kinda,
Ya know,

613
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:23,460
helicopter budge him on his yacht is a
gym. There's a sauna, there's a Jacuzzi,

614
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:27,140
there's a walk in freezers machines.

615
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,860
They're not falling machines. You wouldn't
want them rolling around. But anyway,

616
00:37:31,861 --> 00:37:36,390
he made his money in wind farms,
so there's not even like bad Karma.

617
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:41,520
Oh yeah. He's just, and he's a really
nice guy. That's nice. Yeah. Yeah.

618
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:45,960
He's, he's funny. He's raping the wind,
stealing all our WIC and love to the wind.

619
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:50,430
All that fucking white man
taken all our wind. Yeah.

620
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,370
My Kid, uh, we were,
uh, driving yesterday.

621
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,730
She wanted to watch Peter Pan.
We won't see the movie the other day.

622
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,350
And the movie is a, it's pretty
cool. It's kind of intense, but, uh,

623
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,760
this is my youngest,

624
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:06,990
she's five and the movie was a little
freaked out for her little too freaky.

625
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,710
Like a lot of it was a lot of violence.
Even though it's like implied violence,

626
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:15,100
he kind of get it and scared her motto
mean people yelling big crocodile. Um,

627
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,860
so she wanted to watch
the cartoon instead.

628
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:20,380
So I put it on the cartoon and Peter
Pan, the cartoon is old as fuck. Right.

629
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,320
So I put it on and it is racist as fuck.

630
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,350
Like it's one of those
cartoons from like whenever,

631
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:31,860
I mean when did they make Peter
Pan? You know Jamie's name 19? Yeah,

632
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,230
it's a long ass time ago.
Um, but it's like they're,

633
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,540
they're going to war with the engines
in this, they're fighting engines.

634
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:45,640
What it does is say 53. Yeah. There you
go. Oh, I'm a little disappointed in them.

635
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:48,520
53 was a little bit more in line.
I was hoping it was like in the thirties.

636
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,800
Oh my God. Like, though,
you know, the, the what,

637
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:56,410
one of the songs and it was what
made the red man read, you know,

638
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:57,910
like it was just like,
Ooh,

639
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,270
what did your daughter notice
that it was racist chest idea.

640
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:06,010
She sees cartoons just go to zoning out
while we're driving or her little dance

641
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,530
class, you know, she's not
thinking about it. It just,

642
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,670
she's just looking at something that's
more interesting than being on the road.

643
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:17,050
Like I'm not a huge fan of sitting
the kids down in front of the TV,

644
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,350
but there's a lot of shows that are
educational and they actually learned from

645
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:21,510
him. If you could, uh,

646
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,270
could put on a good educational program
to actually pick up some stuff from it.

647
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,040
Some of the little kid shows that they
have today to have a little lessons of

648
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,540
the kid can learn about,
you know,

649
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:35,800
how to be nice and what's the benefit
about telling the truth when you made

650
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:39,430
mistakes and not getting upset
at people and that kind of stuff.

651
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:43,890
It's kind of cool, but uh, not those
old movies, those old movies just,

652
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:47,440
it's just racism the
whole after World War II,

653
00:39:47,441 --> 00:39:50,800
there was a lot of weird shit
like paper in the Pew. I mean,

654
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:55,360
come on like French people staying
and it's a random, is it Crieve? Yeah.

655
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,570
Fucking cartoon character ever.

656
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,610
They never express why they never, they
never showed him fucking, and he was,

657
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,120
he's clinging and grabbing and
hugging and he just wanted to kiss

658
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,590
specking stinky rapist and
the w who is the other? The,

659
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,960
the Dudley do, right? Yeah.

660
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,170
That chick was always tied to the
railroad tracks was Dudley do. Right.

661
00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:24,030
The Canadian, the Melty, he rode his
horse backwards. Oh, he wrote it.

662
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,300
And the lone ranger and Tonto. You
know what [inaudible] means in Spanish?

663
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,140
No idiot in Spanish, but native
American. What does it mean

664
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,180
as if there's one native American
language? Well, they have some variations,

665
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:41,230
but they have like similar words. I
think that there, I think the people,

666
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:44,470
the writers were fucking with us.
I think it was like Sammy Stott,

667
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,650
you know the Russian thing where you slip
it past the sensors because they don't

668
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:48,880
get it.
That makes sense.

669
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:52,150
Like the whole Batman and Robin
being a gay couple drink. Come on.

670
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,600
That's you know Hawaii
wonder the boy wonder. Yeah.

671
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,890
He was at the first
twink leave it to beaver,

672
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,460
but do they call it p
for back then beaver.

673
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:03,880
I actually looked this up and
I invite you to do it. Jamie,

674
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,950
I invite you to prove me wrong.

675
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:10,660
I looked up beaver and it went back to
like the 18 hundreds wow. Makes Sense.

676
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,630
Cause be for fun. We'll also and
grow. They weren't shaving. Yeah.

677
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,940
That just shows you what a profound
effect porn has had on our culture.

678
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,890
Because if you see a Bush today,

679
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,230
that's a girl is committed
to fucking shaking the,

680
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,070
she's going against the grain or she ages.
Yeah.

681
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,880
Or She's like Lebanese or something
like that. She can't help it.

682
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,580
She shaved a couple of days ago and she
didn't think she was gonna fuck today

683
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:39,680
you get the Vern fucking weeds
growing under her panties.

684
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:44,930
It is a weird thing though because
like until like, what was it, maybe 15,

685
00:41:44,931 --> 00:41:46,940
20 years ago,
everybody had a bush.

686
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,330
They just grew up like playboy Bush man.

687
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,610
And now there's no Bush and
there's no nudes in playboy.

688
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:55,820
What's happening to this world? Fine.
Try find a girl today with asshole hair.

689
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:01,340
Right. Try it. Then I just
changing the, changing the DNA.

690
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,653
It's um,

691
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:07,780
it's a fascinating thing that porn has
literally changed the way girls groomed

692
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:12,650
their pubic hair is almost
universally like all my, I mean,

693
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,270
profound change,
like a percentage of change.

694
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,950
It's almost like 80,

695
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:24,070
probably like 80 or 90% of women have
done like at least some significant

696
00:42:24,261 --> 00:42:27,380
grooming down there made.
Maybe they leave a little landing strip,

697
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:32,270
but let a full Bush go full
Bush was the norm. Right?

698
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,190
I don't know. I mean, I would assume.
Yeah, I would think so. I mean,

699
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:42,110
dudes weren't grown in right. When I
was in high school, I dated this girl.

700
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:44,130
She was crazy. And, um,

701
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:48,100
she was just all over the place and,
uh,

702
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,170
she was who I was like,
it was like,

703
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,390
it was two main girlfriends that I had
in high school and they're both very nice

704
00:42:56,391 --> 00:42:58,160
girls.
There's not nothing bad to say about him,

705
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:03,161
but one of them went to Catholic school
and she was the most fucked up and she

706
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:08,951
just had just like massive suppression
from Catholic school and just looking for

707
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:09,770
an outlet.

708
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:14,030
And her outlet was any boy that like
showed her attention like it was,

709
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,620
it was good for me early on to like
date a girl who's like super promiscuous

710
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:22,550
because of like lowered my expectations
about what girls cheating on me or

711
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:23,600
cheating in general.

712
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,600
Like we kind of made some
sort of agreement somewhere
along the line that we'd

713
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:30,200
never be like official boyfriend and
girlfriend. We'd never be boring.

714
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:34,850
We just hooked up and fucked a lot.
Right. But, um, one time she, uh,

715
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:38,750
had broke up with this guy and, uh,
she came over to my house and, uh,

716
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:42,260
we're getting ready to do
it, but she wouldn't take
her pants off. And I go, why?

717
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:46,950
What's the matter? She goes, I'm
embarrassed. I go, why? She goes, oh,

718
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:52,070
my ex boyfriend made me shave my
vagina. I went, what? Let's see it.

719
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,740
Let's see what's going on down
there. I'm like, whoa, that's crazy.

720
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:59,860
Like she was embarrassed that I would
see it and like not see her Bush.

721
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,630
So it'd be like freaky,
like,

722
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,320
or that she would be some sort
of a pervert or a wack job.

723
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,740
But now it's like standard.
It's so strange.

724
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:13,500
Like I remember thinking like she
was embarrassed because another God,

725
00:44:13,501 --> 00:44:17,900
I mean she was 18 she's embarrassed at
another guy had made her do this and then

726
00:44:17,901 --> 00:44:20,540
I was going to see, and I was going
to think about this other guy, but

727
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:25,550
honestly, for whatever reason,
I've never been that guy.

728
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,140
I'm not like a jealous guy. Like in
that way, no. I'm like, who cares?

729
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,010
What do I give a fuck?
Especially a

730
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,160
girl that I wasn't even,
it wasn't like, yeah,

731
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,250
we were longtime boyfriend
and girlfriend or anything.

732
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:41,850
She's just this neighborhood freak
that I liked. She was a great person.

733
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:43,230
She's nice.
She wasn't bad,

734
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:48,230
but she just describing it
friends like she was like, uh,

735
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,620
you know how it kitten,
you could like roll a ball,

736
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,030
yarn in front of them and
they just have to dive on it.

737
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,260
That's how she was with Dick.

738
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,140
He's a role your dick in front of
her. Whatever reason, that poor girl,

739
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,401
she's everybody.

740
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:06,420
I think pretty much everybody who tried
to fuck her fuck her for a while at

741
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:07,460
least. I mean, I'm sure she

742
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:12,380
see, I think a girl like that
should be admired and honored,

743
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,470
you know? I mean, do you know
about the, what were they called?

744
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:19,990
The sacred prostitutes of Ancient
Greece sacred? No. Yeah, they,

745
00:45:19,991 --> 00:45:24,650
they would, I'm every woman.
Uh, I think it was like a month.

746
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,240
Every woman at had a month in her life
where she would have to go and, um,

747
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:32,930
serve the gods of Greece by
being on the steps of the temple.

748
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:37,400
Fucking every man who, you
know, wanted to fuck her. Wow.

749
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,190
So really? Yeah. So her,

750
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,880
her sex like was seen as
her service to the gods.

751
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:50,450
And so they weren't whores.
They were doing the,

752
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,050
were doing God's work right there.
You know, that's fascinating.

753
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,190
And a lot of cultures have that,
like we talked about in, uh, in sex,

754
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,480
the time we talked about the
Kuleana I think, who like, um,

755
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:04,220
these men would go out on hunting
parties like four or five days, you know,

756
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:05,054
if you guys,

757
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:09,530
and a woman would go with
them to cook and, you know,

758
00:46:09,531 --> 00:46:13,430
keep the camp good when
they're out hunting and fuck
them when they got back to

759
00:46:13,431 --> 00:46:17,740
camp to like keep them comfortable.
And she wasn't some horror.

760
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:21,160
She was like a great woman. Like, Hey,
it's my turn. You know, and they'd,

761
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,260
it was an honored thing to
do. And that's, you know,

762
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:27,610
you're talking earlier about
like how our culture, you know,

763
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,850
we repress all this really natural
stuff and make it a problem when like,

764
00:46:31,851 --> 00:46:33,620
why it doesn't need to be a problem.

765
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,370
I've always wondered why that is.

766
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:39,050
And I wonder if it has
anything to do with our, uh,

767
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:44,180
our need for innovation and for
growth and for productivity.

768
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:51,630
And if the idea of like somehow in
suppressing sexuality it makes people

769
00:46:51,631 --> 00:46:56,631
concentrate on being more productive
and more successful so that way you can

770
00:46:58,051 --> 00:47:01,260
kind of earn sex.
And if sex was more free,

771
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:03,420
you wouldn't get as much done.

772
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:07,890
And I wonder if it's some sort
of a weird work around that.

773
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:13,260
Almost like the construction of this
advanced civilization has sort of a,

774
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,281
it's like,
it's,

775
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:18,630
it's invented this path that
sort of ensures productivity.

776
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:23,490
And one of the best ways to do that is
to make people compete like in a very,

777
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,140
very, uh, efficient and v ferocious
way for the attention of women.

778
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,270
And if this attention of women
was like easily achieved,

779
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,050
there would be less ambition and there
would be less than so in, in a sense,

780
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,700
suppression like leads
to more materialism.

781
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:43,870
And that leads to a more obvious
expression of that materialism.

782
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,600
Like you want the big house,
you want the Nice Watch,

783
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:51,601
you want the nice shoes and the nice
clothes and in wanting all those things,

784
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:54,880
uh, you want all those things because
sex is like difficult to achieve.

785
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:57,040
And if sex was easy to achieve,

786
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,230
you'd be a little bit more
relaxed and your needs.

787
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,220
Because like ultimately the
physical needs kind of like Trump,

788
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:06,580
all the other stuff, you know, I could
do, do you want, do you want a nice watch?

789
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,100
Yeah. I mean it's okay. Why do
I want to, I swatched it will,

790
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,650
they kind of look cool. Okay.
But do you want a nice watch?

791
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,810
Because girls are gonna recognize it.
Yeah.

792
00:48:13,811 --> 00:48:15,700
Well the girls don't give
a shit about a nice watch.

793
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,250
They just want to suck your Dick.
Wow. Well fuck that. Watch. Exactly.

794
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:24,830
Well you've just summarize the argument
of Freud's civilization and its

795
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,470
discontents well yeah,
that's what he says.

796
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:32,471
He says civilization is the product
of a repressed sexual energy being

797
00:48:33,711 --> 00:48:38,090
redirected into productive activities.
Huh?

798
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,970
Well I've sort of reversed it.
I've reversed it.

799
00:48:40,971 --> 00:48:45,450
Almost like civilization
itself. Yeah. Right. Because it,

800
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,540
because it's the result of that it wants
to continue in amplify that like any

801
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:52,850
system wants to persist.
Right.

802
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,790
So because it's the result of that,

803
00:48:55,791 --> 00:49:00,791
then there are in built in mechanisms for
perpetuating that cycle of repression.

804
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:05,090
Redirection. You know, dangling
the carrot. I mean, if,

805
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:10,270
if capitalism could stop us from
breathing and then charge us for air,

806
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,850
they would, oh yeah, they're
doing it with water right now.

807
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:14,650
You can figure out how to get

808
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:19,060
that wind farm guy like you're,
you, you're using our air. Exactly.

809
00:49:19,061 --> 00:49:21,310
You're making money on
exactly how that's right.

810
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,680
Well, I mean they've done it with land.
Right. Anything about it. Like, you know,

811
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,510
I'm going to have to pay for land
before no one had to pay for shelter.

812
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,390
That was free.

813
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,760
Well, have you ever heard the
argument about public lands? I mean,

814
00:49:30,761 --> 00:49:33,760
there's a real issue right now with
this Chris Ryan. Fuck, not Chris Ryan,

815
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:37,360
Paul Ryan. Excuse me. You
have the Nice, the nice round,

816
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:41,590
which I apologize the Paul
Ryan is not in my phone. Um,

817
00:49:41,591 --> 00:49:44,680
but that um,
in 2013,

818
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:49,681
he had proposed selling off public land
to pay for the debt that are corrupt.

819
00:49:50,081 --> 00:49:52,780
Politicians have fucking established
and Spencer. Right, right. Well,

820
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,220
there is Teddy Roosevelt.

821
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:58,570
It's set aside all of these like national
parks and all this wildlife area.

822
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,940
That's an incredible,
because we could all go there.

823
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:05,970
I mean we have these areas of our
country that are owned by the citizens.

824
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,140
So like you can go to Yellowstone,

825
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:11,590
you can go to all these different national
state parks and national and state

826
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:16,120
parks and you can go fishing. You could
go fucking kayaking and go camping.

827
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:21,660
And there's politicians that have proposed
selling off all this potentially very

828
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:26,830
valuable land to large corporations to
pay off a lot of the tax debt or the,

829
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:31,790
um, um, um, deficit debt. The
problem with that is, first of all,

830
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:35,390
it's never going to pay it off because
we all fucking trillions of dollars.

831
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:38,300
Like they, they, they tried to
explain it that of every man,

832
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:43,130
woman and child in this country gave
every penny that they owe. We would,

833
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,400
they own, we would still be
trillions of dollars in debt.

834
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,800
Like it doesn't matter because it's debt
in dollars and we print dollars. Well,

835
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:55,340
and it's dead to who? Like who
do we owe it to? It's all us.

836
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,650
What is that?
It's a weird fucking,

837
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,270
it's just ensuring that we're going to
give them a disproportionate amount of

838
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:09,590
resources and and,
and Zeros and we already do that.

839
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:13,240
Public land is leased to mining companies
for nothing. Yeah, right. Nothing.

840
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,340
Nowhere near market value.
That's another thing that the right,

841
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,530
like almost universally does.

842
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:23,590
They almost universally support big
businesses that impede on public lands and

843
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:27,650
frack and do a lot of things that are
potentially damaging to the environment

844
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:32,300
and they, they're very submissive of that.
The very summit. Oh, what a few p a few,

845
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,970
a few wells get tainted,
a few,

846
00:51:34,971 --> 00:51:39,800
a few lands get poisoned it.
There's a few areas where there's a spill.

847
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,860
I was invited,
but it's this weird sort of agreement.

848
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:47,450
There's an agreement with a lot of like
very confirmed right wing people that

849
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:51,230
you're going to be religious. You're
going to thank God. You're going to like,

850
00:51:51,231 --> 00:51:52,910
whether or not you believe it or not,
you're going,

851
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:54,440
you want to align yourself
with these people.

852
00:51:54,441 --> 00:51:58,580
You have to be openly religious and you
also have to be openly dismissive of

853
00:51:58,581 --> 00:51:59,930
environmental concerns.

854
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:04,160
There's like this weird
thing and oftentimes it's
amongst people that are not

855
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:08,270
even wealthy. Not only are
they not wealthy, they have
no potential to be wealthy.

856
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,800
Joe The plumber, fucking soldiers manage
this fucking guy do Jujitsu with who a,

857
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:14,840
it seems like a nice guy,
but uh,

858
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:19,760
we're having this conversation once about
global warming and he starts going off

859
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:24,050
about these people that believe in global
warming and that he's just real right

860
00:52:24,051 --> 00:52:28,250
wing as a soldier, you know, and he's
like, shit, like there's a natural cycle.

861
00:52:28,251 --> 00:52:31,700
It's always been like, are you a climate
scientist? Like how are you so confident?

862
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,121
Do you know?

863
00:52:32,121 --> 00:52:35,930
Like there's like thousands of scientists
that have been studying this for

864
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:40,340
decades and they're convinced to do
some shit going down and that it has a

865
00:52:40,341 --> 00:52:44,210
direct relationship. It w whatever
percentage of that relationship is,

866
00:52:44,211 --> 00:52:49,211
whether it's 5% or 6% or 1% but there
is a relationship between modern

867
00:52:49,341 --> 00:52:53,810
industrialized civilization
and the warming of the planet.

868
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:58,070
Like they believe this is scientists that
have looked at the data and say, well,

869
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,720
maybe there's some cycle going on,

870
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:04,520
but that cycle may in fact be accentuated
by human beings and our activity and

871
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:09,610
we might be speeding this up along and
it might have this effect that is like,

872
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:14,250
uh, like this effect
where like, like there's,

873
00:53:14,251 --> 00:53:17,840
there's some concerned about the polar
ice caps. Have you heard that concern?

874
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:21,770
That as they melt, they create
pools and as those pools reflect,

875
00:53:21,771 --> 00:53:26,580
water exacerbates the situation and
everything goes in this exponential

876
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,840
rate and it starts instead of looking
at it like, oh, we're losing, yeah,

877
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,210
there's tipping points instead of loop.
We're losing x amount of feet per year.

878
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,170
We'll know.
We'll actually,

879
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:38,130
once it hits this area and then the
comes water and then the water reflects

880
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,920
light, then it gets even
warmer, then everything gets
crazy. Right. And then your,

881
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:43,800
your, you know, then there's gonna come
a point in time where you're fucked.

882
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:44,400
I mean,

883
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,400
one need not look very far to find
underwater civilization evidence in other

884
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,250
there, there, there was this, um, there's,

885
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,160
there's been a bunch of them that
they found recently with a, you know,

886
00:53:56,161 --> 00:53:58,940
they'd go like near coastal
cities and they're out, you know,

887
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:01,980
scuba dive and then go, what the
fuck is this? And they find like, oh,

888
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:06,720
well 5,000 years ago this was the city
and now it's under water levels about 300

889
00:54:06,721 --> 00:54:10,050
feet higher than it was 12,000 years
ago. Yeah. I mean there's some,

890
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,510
I'm sure there's all sorts of reasons
for that and I'm sure that's not,

891
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:16,210
that has nothing to do with industrialized
civilization because the ice agent,

892
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,530
yeah, yeah, exactly. But I mean
there's no, there's no question.

893
00:54:19,531 --> 00:54:23,310
They understand the mechanism perfectly
of what's happening. But I'm with you.

894
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:27,180
I think the, the, I think it's
already too late, honestly. And See,

895
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,350
that's their next argument.

896
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:30,930
That's the argument that I can't really
argue with it because I think they're

897
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:35,190
right that, well, it's too late,
you know, because the methane,

898
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,040
that's what I'm worried about. You know,
about the methane. Yeah. From cow farts.

899
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,230
And Shit. No, no. In
the bottom of the ocean.

900
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:44,520
O and methane is much,
uh,

901
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:48,210
has a much greater impact than CO2,
then carbon.

902
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,630
And what does that from the bottom
of the ocean? What's that? Well,

903
00:54:51,631 --> 00:54:55,100
it's human waste. Same thing as
the cow shit. It's uh, no, it's um,

904
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,270
plant material that sediment,
you know,

905
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:03,540
settled to the bottom long time ago. And
then because the temperatures very cold,

906
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:08,541
it's frozen so it's sealed in and as the
warmer water comes over and melts that

907
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:12,870
ice, like permafrost is also happening
in the Arctic, the permafrost is melting,

908
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:17,610
so all the shit that's been sealed
under ice is now coming up and it's all

909
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:20,100
decomposing plant materials.
So it's full of methane.

910
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:23,580
Well there was a article that I
tweeted the other day that's even more

911
00:55:23,581 --> 00:55:24,414
terrifying.

912
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:29,450
They were talking about the potential
for long frozen viruses and bacteria that

913
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:34,190
we cannot control and that we don't
have any immunity. That's interesting.

914
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:39,470
Being released as global warming sort
of washes over these fucking dead wooly

915
00:55:40,201 --> 00:55:41,850
mammoth carcasses and shit.

916
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,240
Some saber tooth tiger got saber tooth
tiger aids and it's gonna just get blown

917
00:55:47,401 --> 00:55:49,650
off like dandelions in the,

918
00:55:49,651 --> 00:55:53,670
in the breeze and it's going to fly
up your nose. And I mean, you know,

919
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:57,720
it's completely unsustainable.
The population growth.
I, there's a cool thing.

920
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:59,170
I've got this unread it.
Uh,

921
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:03,210
there's a tangentially speaking page
where people talk about the podcast and

922
00:56:03,211 --> 00:56:06,260
whatever, friends of mine and stuff. So
there's the thing right now about, uh,

923
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:10,920
you where the guy's like, look,
Joe Rogan lives the perfect life,

924
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:13,260
right?
It's the perfect blend of,

925
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,370
of 21st century technology and primordial,
uh,

926
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,100
you know, life patterns. You know, he
kills his own meat. He has chickens,

927
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:27,300
he lives near a city, but he's
got land and space, you know,

928
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:32,390
so they sort of delineated
all these things, uh, about
your life. And he's like, oh,

929
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:36,190
how can everyone live that way? We need
to make a world where everyone lives.

930
00:56:36,191 --> 00:56:37,810
Like Joe Rogan.
Well,

931
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:41,200
I don't think I could ever live
like this if a city didn't exist.

932
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:44,560
I don't think our live like, I mean,
I'd have to be off the grid, right?

933
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,900
So if I'm off the grid and
I'm gonna live the way I live,

934
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,270
I would have to figure out
a way to make a living.

935
00:56:49,271 --> 00:56:51,760
So I'd have to have the kind of resources
that I have that which are really

936
00:56:51,761 --> 00:56:56,470
dependent upon a city and technology
and the Internet. Yeah. I mean,

937
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:57,610
it really is impossible.

938
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,770
It's not possible for everybody
to live the way I'm living.

939
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:02,100
Not if there are 7 billion of us,

940
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,820
not if there's 20 million in Los
Angeles. Right. Just in this city.

941
00:57:06,821 --> 00:57:10,780
I'm a fucking unique parasite. Yeah.
Well, what I'm saying is like, if,

942
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:15,760
if I think the key is dramatic reduction
of population because we've got the

943
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:18,940
technology right and we
understand how reproduction works,

944
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:21,160
so we could stop having
babies if we want to.

945
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,870
What do you think of the argument that
as technology increases and as people

946
00:57:25,871 --> 00:57:28,140
become more and more,
um,

947
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:33,250
centrally located in cities and a that's
happening and all these urban areas and

948
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:38,340
these people will be more concerned with
their careers and that I've read that

949
00:57:38,381 --> 00:57:42,880
there's a concern that the population
will actually decrease dramatically

950
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:48,240
because as people become more concerned
with their careers and more ingrained in

951
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:53,470
the civilized urban life,
that they'll be less unlikely,

952
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,630
less and less likely to breed.
Well,

953
00:57:55,690 --> 00:58:00,690
it's well documented that as women get
more education and enter the workforce,

954
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:06,940
their fertility decreases. It also become
more, they have more testosterone, right?

955
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:09,970
I don't know. Yeah. I don't
know how familiar with that.

956
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,440
But they definitely have less kids for
your kids and they weight later in life

957
00:58:14,441 --> 00:58:17,110
to start having kids and all
that. And they grow Dick's. Right?

958
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:22,230
They become like men and
mean. It may be a little, um,

959
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:25,660
but no, that's great. I mean, cause I
mean we're not, I'm not talking about,

960
00:58:25,661 --> 00:58:29,280
you know, Carly Fiorina, I'm talking
about women in Pakistan, right?

961
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,300
Who have absolutely no power or anything.

962
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,070
So as they get educated and have
more access to resources and so on,

963
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:40,000
they'll have fewer kids. And a lot
of places in the world right now,

964
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:44,630
population growth is below zero.
Japan, Spain, France, you know,

965
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:45,670
the Nordic countries,

966
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:50,290
which is why the whole migration thing is,

967
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,340
there's a bit of a, uh, like a,

968
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:58,210
a bait and switch going on there because
they're complaining that they don't

969
00:58:58,211 --> 00:58:59,050
want immigrants,

970
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:01,990
but they know they need immigrants because
there aren't enough young people to

971
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:05,220
support the old people.
That's so strange. Yeah.

972
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,480
But the problem is that they're getting
immigrants in a lot of times these

973
00:59:07,481 --> 00:59:11,770
immigrants have like these really extreme
cultural values and right. I mean,

974
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,680
they have an issue with,
you know,

975
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:18,790
different religious factions battling it
out and all of these European countries

976
00:59:18,791 --> 00:59:22,880
now, it was a giant Muslim
population and France and, you know,

977
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:27,440
have you ever seen that video where this
guy walks around Paris, dressed as a, a,

978
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:27,981
a Jew,

979
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:31,790
like very obvious Jewish person and he
walks through he's Arab neighborhoods and

980
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:35,330
just get fucking yelled at and screamed,
oh,

981
00:59:35,331 --> 00:59:39,410
it's horrible to the antisemitism.
And, uh, I asked, uh,

982
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:41,120
Ari about it and he's like,

983
00:59:41,121 --> 00:59:46,121
it's been pretty well documented that a
lot of these places that have a allowed,

984
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:48,890
uh,
pretty much anyone to immigrate to,

985
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:52,250
that they develop these communities
and in these communities,

986
00:59:52,251 --> 00:59:57,251
they essentially hold on to some of the
worst aspects of wherever they're from.

987
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:59,330
And it's only part of the communities.

988
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:01,820
But if you go through those
parts of those communities,

989
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:06,260
you're going to find those people. Yeah,
sure. Yeah. It's, it's a tough one.

990
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:10,160
Cause I mean,
I'm generally pretty open to immigration.

991
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:12,310
I'm an immigrant and most of
the time I'm sure, you know,

992
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,050
my grandparents were immigrants.
You know,

993
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:17,030
anybody who's not open to immigration
in America, it's like, well,

994
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:19,910
where the fuck do you think you
came from? You know? I mean,

995
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:22,370
in my case I live in Spain,
even native Americans,

996
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,800
they came down the Bering
strait from Siberia, you know,

997
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:27,290
although that's being questioned.
Yeah.

998
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:31,730
They're finding they found a ruins in
South America that are about 40,000 years

999
01:00:31,731 --> 01:00:36,590
old. Chile. I might, I might
be overestimating that, but
I think that's what it is.

1000
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,440
Right? There's no way that was Bering
strait. So now they're thinking,

1001
01:00:42,441 --> 01:00:45,680
well, like I was saying earlier
about the diaspora from Africa,

1002
01:00:45,681 --> 01:00:49,610
it seems it's much more complicated
than the story of Bering Strait and then

1003
01:00:49,611 --> 01:00:52,760
spreading out from there. Cause
yeah, they came over in boats.

1004
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:56,390
Well that was always an issue with the old
mech people. Right. Was it the old Mac?

1005
01:00:56,391 --> 01:00:58,940
I believe it was that they
have these ancient, uh,

1006
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,300
heads they found in South
America our features,

1007
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:06,230
they're very African features,
very thick lips and wide noses.

1008
01:01:06,231 --> 01:01:09,470
And they think that it's
Mexico. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1009
01:01:09,471 --> 01:01:13,820
And they think that it's very possible
that this is all Graham Hancock's area of

1010
01:01:13,821 --> 01:01:18,560
expertise and him and, uh, Randall
Carlson will beyond on the 19th.

1011
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:22,220
And I'm really psyched about that.
That's always a mind bender of a podcast.

1012
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:26,110
But Randall Carlson,
he's the meteor strike.

1013
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:31,500
He fucking freaks me out with
evidence photographs and you know,

1014
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,770
the core samples of how,

1015
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:37,760
how radically the earth temperature
changed around 12,000 years ago.

1016
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:42,761
And he believes that coexist
co [inaudible] that it
corresponds directly with

1017
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:46,880
some sort of an asteroid will impact.
But one of his things when he said,

1018
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:49,580
everyone's concerned about
global warming and he's like,

1019
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:52,340
global warming is a real issue. No
doubt about it, but you know what?

1020
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:57,260
The real issue is global cooling. He goes,
global cooling is far more terrifying.

1021
01:01:57,261 --> 01:02:00,290
If you look at human history,
the great periods of growth,

1022
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:04,100
the great periods of education and
innovation, they all came with warmth.

1023
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:08,420
Like whenever there's some cold,
whenever things freeze and shutdown,

1024
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:12,920
that's a wrap. That's the life
killer or killers global cooling.

1025
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:15,200
The glaciers in the last ice age,
right?

1026
01:02:15,201 --> 01:02:19,410
The glaciers were down to Minnesota
like all of Canada was under and all of

1027
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:20,010
northern Europe.

1028
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:24,900
Like down into France. Yeah, like to the
Pyrenees. Basically half of North America,

1029
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,750
half of North America was
under a mile high sheet of ice.

1030
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:32,340
Canada just didn't exist.
No fucking hockey. Hockey,

1031
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,420
no Montreal, no beautiful
fringe girls. Nothing.

1032
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:41,530
What's that shit with potatoes that
they put teens routine. Oh, poutine.

1033
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,780
That's stuffs for Dick.

1034
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:47,670
That's people that are trying to put
fat on cold weather food. Really Cozy.

1035
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:52,020
That's God damn delicious. I saw,
actually I saw you in Vancouver.

1036
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:53,850
I was just going to ask you
if you've been to Vancouver.

1037
01:02:53,851 --> 01:02:58,851
I saw your show that that's my favorite
city in and well I should say that it's

1038
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:02,640
my favorite city all year round.

1039
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:06,990
Whereas I really enjoy Toronto
when it's warm. It's cold.

1040
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:09,540
It's hard. Canada, it's fucking awesome.

1041
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,750
That is the number one place that I
would move outside the United States.

1042
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,790
Like is Australia and Canada.

1043
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:18,020
Those are the two spots that
you've heard from Dunkin. He's,

1044
01:03:18,021 --> 01:03:21,510
he's in Australia now. Is He really?
Yeah. He just went down like two days ago.

1045
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:25,200
Cause cause that's why I contacted you
to do the shrimp parade thing. Right.

1046
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,390
Cause I was going to be
an la that's right. Yeah.

1047
01:03:27,391 --> 01:03:30,030
We can't seem to organize
it when we're all together.

1048
01:03:30,031 --> 01:03:33,750
But Dunkin's become too successful.
Sabotaged his career,

1049
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:39,350
hang around with him. Yeah. He used
to be available and no love, no duck.

1050
01:03:39,351 --> 01:03:43,530
And he is so good at podcasts and rants.
Yeah.

1051
01:03:43,531 --> 01:03:45,600
He loves it so much that he almost,

1052
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:47,340
I think he loves it more
than even loves doing,

1053
01:03:47,341 --> 01:03:52,341
stand up those rants that he can just
freely go into when he does those live

1054
01:03:52,351 --> 01:03:55,630
podcasts. He's been doing a
lot of live podcasting. Well,

1055
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:58,260
I did two of them with him,
but he never put them out.

1056
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:02,370
I don't know where they are. He's holding
onto him. Yeah. Yeah, quite a while ago.

1057
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:07,410
Really? That seems odd. He doesn't hold
on to podcast. That's so strange. Yeah.

1058
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,270
Dude, I forgot to press
record. Fuck. They'll get bad.

1059
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:16,850
Let's do it again. I remember when
we said we'll just act it out though.

1060
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:21,000
Exactly. Australia is amazing
though. I fucking love it over there.

1061
01:04:21,001 --> 01:04:24,900
It's just too far. The flight is
just brutal. It's 16 hour flight. I,

1062
01:04:24,901 --> 01:04:29,670
I've only been there once and it was
because I was invited to speak at Sydney

1063
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:32,640
Opera House in this thing they do.
That's like the Australian ted,

1064
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,800
but they call it the, the
festival of dangerous ideas. Ooh,

1065
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,590
I like it. Isn't that
great? I love it. And it's,

1066
01:04:40,591 --> 01:04:44,400
it's like the Anti Ted where Ted is all
like don't offend anyone and who let us

1067
01:04:44,401 --> 01:04:45,990
look at what you're going
to say and you know,

1068
01:04:45,991 --> 01:04:48,070
let's rehearse this seven times there.

1069
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,820
They were like say
whatever the fuck you want.

1070
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:54,930
We want people to like talk about it
and be provoked and like, you know,

1071
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,310
no limit just to say what you want.
I appreciate that. Yeah. I think,

1072
01:04:59,311 --> 01:05:00,990
I think that's a sign
of a healthy culture.

1073
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:04,830
Getting back to her saying earlier where
we pression causes the problem it's

1074
01:05:04,831 --> 01:05:07,350
trying to avoid by pressurizing it.

1075
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,380
Well that's always been the knock on
Ted is that they try to control that

1076
01:05:10,381 --> 01:05:14,730
situation too much. They try to make
sure that the speakers all room together,

1077
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,010
like a Eddie was saying that they made him

1078
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,520
like room with some other
duties like ombre rich.

1079
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:24,880
I want to get my own fucking hotel
room mantle when they busted his balls

1080
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:29,650
because he came up to do your podcast
to promote his ted stuff, you know,

1081
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:33,100
and they, they, they pulled him
off of the rest of the program.

1082
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:36,580
It's just you can't do that with a
successful guy like him. Cause he's like,

1083
01:05:36,581 --> 01:05:40,000
what do I give a fuck?
Well and getting back to the other shit,

1084
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,340
they don't pay their perform.
Exactly.

1085
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,610
They didn't pay him and they made him
sleep in a room with some other dude.

1086
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:50,260
Like it's the whole thing is fucking
Uber Bizarre. It's very strange.

1087
01:05:50,261 --> 01:05:53,860
But in doing that and like really see,
I understand what they're doing,

1088
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:56,740
they're protecting their brand
because it's worth a lot of money now.

1089
01:05:56,741 --> 01:06:01,540
I mean they have a Ted podcast and they
have these ted talks and Tedx and the

1090
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:05,950
website gets fucking insane amount of
traffic and they've become a corporation.

1091
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:09,520
They become this corporate entity.
But when you respect someone,

1092
01:06:09,521 --> 01:06:12,610
like if you have someone like you and
they like your book and they like your

1093
01:06:12,611 --> 01:06:16,060
ideas, the more they can
just give you free reign,

1094
01:06:16,061 --> 01:06:17,970
the more it's going to be exciting.
Right?

1095
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,010
Gonna let you express
yourself in an uncensored way.

1096
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:25,840
You're going to get the full Chris Ryan
experience instead of like some bullshit

1097
01:06:25,841 --> 01:06:30,070
water down corporate version of
whatever the fuck your ideas would be.

1098
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:33,640
Whatever palatable aspects of your ideas
they think they could sell to people.

1099
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:38,950
Yeah, it's a strange, it's strange
thing. I mean, I feel like,

1100
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:42,460
you know, they've got a huge
platform, you've got to respect that.

1101
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:46,510
But on the other hand, you know, if I go
out and I fuck up, they could just say,

1102
01:06:46,511 --> 01:06:49,870
well, sorry Chris fucked up. It
doesn't have to reflect badly on them.

1103
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,760
When you saw what happened
with Graham Hancock,

1104
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:54,090
when the Graham Hancock put out his
thing and they were saying this,

1105
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:57,620
all this pseudo science, they're
accusing of of pseudoscience and, and,

1106
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:01,660
and you know, this, this
horrific idea of pseudoscience,

1107
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:04,900
like let the guy express his
opinions and ideas. And it was,

1108
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:09,901
it was about psychedelic drugs and it's
his thoughts on how it corresponds with

1109
01:07:11,051 --> 01:07:13,750
creativity and history and what,
you know,

1110
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:18,010
how man sort of evolved and
emerged with psychedelic trucks.

1111
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:21,340
It's not a unique opinion.
Not saying that it's not original,

1112
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:25,330
it's not unique in that it's not cool
and interesting and that it's not,

1113
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,970
he's not the only one that
thinks this. Sure. There's many,

1114
01:07:27,971 --> 01:07:31,000
many people that believe this,
and this is a common thought,

1115
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:35,260
not just amongst people that are on
the fringe, but amongst scholars. Yeah.

1116
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:38,380
There's a lot of people that
correlate and rightly so,

1117
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:43,650
incredibly powerful
hallucinogenic experiences with
changing people's ideas and

1118
01:07:44,881 --> 01:07:45,401
minds.

1119
01:07:45,401 --> 01:07:50,401
And that corresponds to a big leaps of
creativity are big chances that people

1120
01:07:51,131 --> 01:07:53,670
take. Or like we were talking
about your friend, uh,

1121
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,590
earlier today that was
a lawyer and you know,

1122
01:07:56,591 --> 01:07:59,950
it goes on this fucking psychedelic
trip and says, fuck this law shit.

1123
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:05,250
I'm going to open up a float tank center
and I'm going to be a freak and happy.

1124
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:07,260
Yeah, exactly. And you know,

1125
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:12,100
there's a big thing now in silicon valley
with microdosing microdosing wa which

1126
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:16,190
Lsd or suicide or whatever
it is. Um, because

1127
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,720
of the creativity.
Yeah.

1128
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:23,480
So like Steve Jobs said LSD was the
most important experience of his life.

1129
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:28,610
Uh, Kary Mullis who invented
the DNA replication,

1130
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,900
a credited to, uh, get
the PR, what is it? Pr?

1131
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:37,280
Probably Mary's chain something
TCR or something like that. Yeah.

1132
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,970
He's supposed to be crazy though. He's
an interesting dude. Yeah. He took his,

1133
01:08:40,971 --> 01:08:45,860
his Nobel money and just
surfs. Really? Yeah,

1134
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:50,000
I met him at, at Ted actually.
Yeah, he's a, yeah, he was,

1135
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:54,290
it was kind of irritating because I wanted
to shake his hand and say hello and,

1136
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:59,060
but every time I saw him he was engaged
in the same argument with the same guy.

1137
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:02,170
This one guy was just hounding
him and I don't remember,

1138
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:06,620
I don't know if it was like chem trails
or it was like one of these things

1139
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:12,800
and I kept thinking like, dude, just
like, you know, it's been two days.

1140
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:18,620
Yeah. Yeah. What's more of this?
And I'm good. So, um, yeah,

1141
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:18,801
the,

1142
01:09:18,801 --> 01:09:22,310
the surfing thing is another one of
those things like golf that I'm scared to

1143
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:27,080
try and I don't necessarily think I
would get addicted to golf because I find

1144
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:27,810
it's the,

1145
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:32,810
what's ridiculous about it
is more appealing to mock
than it is a interesting to

1146
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:36,600
walk, like the precision and the
accuracy and all the, you know, the,

1147
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:39,080
the control that you have
to have over your movement,

1148
01:09:39,081 --> 01:09:42,350
your body to make that ball roll into
the hole. It's still the end of the day,

1149
01:09:42,351 --> 01:09:45,260
it's just a ball falling into a hole.
It's fucking stupid. And that said,

1150
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:47,660
I'm hypocritical because I
play pool and I love that.

1151
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,640
But I know I become addicted to that.

1152
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:54,560
But the surfing thing is an addictive
it addictive thing that I'm scared of

1153
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:57,890
because I think I would fucking
dive right into that shit.

1154
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,440
Everybody that I talked to that
surfs the way they describe it,

1155
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,350
I feel like it would be amazing.

1156
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:07,040
But that's a really healthy thing to
be doing until the sharks come and bite

1157
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:10,820
your Dick off, Chris Ryan, you just punch
it in the face. You're a trained fighter,

1158
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:11,181
man.

1159
01:10:11,181 --> 01:10:14,630
Maybe I need to figure out how to get
strong enough where I can surf with chain

1160
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:18,800
mail, like a shark proof suit and
just to get to be really yolked.

1161
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:23,950
I tried surfing in Nicaragua.
I look how you said that when he got out,

1162
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,610
go check out our, like you fit right in.
And I gave love. Yeah, it was perfect. Uh,

1163
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:30,500
the perfect wave,
perfect place.

1164
01:10:30,501 --> 01:10:34,820
And there was this ex military American
dude who gave lessons. And like I'm at,

1165
01:10:34,821 --> 01:10:38,270
I'm in a cafe or something and he's like,
dude, I'll take you out. It's great.

1166
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:42,380
It's where they filmed one of the
like survivor or one of those shows.

1167
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:46,100
And um, yeah, he took
me out and it was this,

1168
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:51,020
it was like the perfect baby wave.
It was maybe like two or three feet high,

1169
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:55,790
perfect line coming in at just the right
angle. Like he couldn't fuck it up,

1170
01:10:55,791 --> 01:11:00,140
you know? And I just real
long board, which is really
easy. Longboards are better.

1171
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:04,580
Yeah, well they're stable.
Right. And uh, I mean,

1172
01:11:04,581 --> 01:11:06,110
I'm such a fucking pussy man.

1173
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,960
I like after like doing the push
up and get up on it, you know,

1174
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:14,330
like 20 times I like my arms were
shaking and like my knees were shaking,

1175
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,860
you know,
I'm not in great physical condition.

1176
01:11:16,861 --> 01:11:20,650
And finally I got up and I was like,
oh,

1177
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:25,710
I'm standing and the waves moving me a
little bit and then I fell forward and

1178
01:11:26,101 --> 01:11:28,890
the board smacked me right
in the fucking forehead.

1179
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,680
And I literally saw stars,
you know,

1180
01:11:31,681 --> 01:11:35,040
like I haven't since I was seven
and I wrecked my bike, you know,

1181
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:39,750
like that kind of like whoa. And I'm
underwater and like, all right, that's,

1182
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:43,020
you could die. Yeah. Yeah. You can hit
your head and died doing that shit. Oh,

1183
01:11:43,021 --> 01:11:45,310
do you see this? What's
going on there? I uh,

1184
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:49,980
I was with this buddy of
mine at a firing range.

1185
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:51,760
Oh, two weeks ago. Yourself.

1186
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:57,360
I had blood running down my
face. It was, it was humiliating.

1187
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:59,940
I've done a really, yeah, I myself,

1188
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:04,941
once I scold myself once when I shot a
pig that was just scope myself right on

1189
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:08,820
the nose. Oh, I cannot an
actual hunting situation.

1190
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,330
I'll walk myself as better or worse. I
mean, there were a lot of like, okay,

1191
01:12:13,331 --> 01:12:17,250
wait a minute. White men laughing at me.
Here's why it's worse. I didn't, I scoped.

1192
01:12:17,251 --> 01:12:19,440
It's siting in my rifle
now that I reconsider.

1193
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,990
I had a bandaid on when I shot the pig,

1194
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:26,370
but I scoped myself shooting at a
target before shot the pig. Now that,

1195
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:29,730
well that's what I,
my buddy was scoping in like he had a new,

1196
01:12:29,731 --> 01:12:34,120
he's an elk on her and he had
a new wind mag 300 right? Yeah.

1197
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:39,290
So I was shooting is 30 odd six and
apparently I was doing pretty well and I

1198
01:12:40,261 --> 01:12:42,510
don't, maybe he was just humoring
me, but he was like, Hey,

1199
01:12:42,511 --> 01:12:45,290
I think this is firing a little high.
Can you take a shot cause you're,

1200
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,780
you're really steady today. And
so I was like, okay, no problem.

1201
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:53,070
And just like it just drove
right into my forehead.

1202
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:56,250
If you get used to have 30 odd six is a
big difference between the kick of the

1203
01:12:56,251 --> 01:12:59,640
300 win Mag. That's a big
shell. I got one of those.

1204
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:03,900
Is that what your monster thing is that
you took out the two rifles that are

1205
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:06,660
like that around that one
of them's a 300 win mag.

1206
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:09,540
The other one's a seven
millimeter Remington ultra mag,

1207
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:14,100
which is basically real similar in size
and round. They're both big heavy rounds.

1208
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:18,540
I shot the Moose with that fucker
right there. Where? That's right here.

1209
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:21,660
It's a baby moose.
That's a Moose Moose.

1210
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:27,270
They would call it like a Forkey was
900 pounds and it was a small one.

1211
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:31,140
There's so big. Where were you? Canada?

1212
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:36,500
My buddy shot one the same trip that
was probably six 700 pounds bigger.

1213
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:40,180
It was so big.
He walked across it,

1214
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:45,290
walked across the road and it literally
didn't look real like his walked in the

1215
01:13:45,691 --> 01:13:49,020
street in front of us,
like it was road the street,

1216
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:53,730
but it was maybe 250 yards in
front of us in the road cheeses,

1217
01:13:53,731 --> 01:13:56,100
it was like Jurassic Park.
It was like a scene in Jurassic Park.

1218
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:58,920
I mean we could have probably driven
under it with a truck we were in.

1219
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,340
I'm not kidding.
There's so fucking big.

1220
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:06,870
I remember seeing them in
Alaska and thinking they
were like horses on steroids.

1221
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,680
Yeah, they're just a shoulder
front, shoulders. Incredible.

1222
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:15,250
With barn doors growing out of the
side of their heads. They're monstrous,

1223
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,810
monstrous animals.
You know,

1224
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:22,150
there's an idea that's connected with
the cold weather and large mammals like

1225
01:14:22,151 --> 01:14:25,150
that, that the colder the
weather, the larger the Mammo,

1226
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:28,740
I forget what the principle
is. It's skin exposure. Yeah,

1227
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:33,310
bigger internal and less skin
exposure. The ratio, the ratio,

1228
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:37,750
because the same animals that are
enormous in like Saskatchewan,

1229
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:42,130
like white tailed deer. If they're
in Mexico, they're way smaller,

1230
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:44,140
like a big white tail deer.

1231
01:14:44,141 --> 01:14:46,840
In Mexico it was only like a
hundred and something pounds.

1232
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:50,530
Whereas in Saskatchewan
they'll get to 300 plus pounds.

1233
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:55,120
They're literally like three times as big.
Same species. Yeah. Same species. Yeah.

1234
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:59,200
That's what also why polar bears are
so fucking big that polar bears are

1235
01:14:59,201 --> 01:15:03,840
gigantic. You know, Kodiak bears
on, um, we've been to Kodiak, man,

1236
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:08,230
I've seen one day I was sitting
on a bridge. It was weird.

1237
01:15:08,231 --> 01:15:12,070
I was sitting on this bridge. I'd gone
for a walk and it's like a low, you know,

1238
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:16,690
dirt board kind of bridge, you know, and
I sit in their writing in my journal,

1239
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:21,730
the pedantic dickhead. I was like, you
know, poetry about Alaska or something.

1240
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,990
And I heard the splashing in the river
below and I turned to look and I'm like,

1241
01:15:25,991 --> 01:15:29,500
maybe 15 feet above the water and I
look below and there's this fucking bear

1242
01:15:29,501 --> 01:15:33,710
down. They're like knocking salmon around,
like on the documentaries. Oh my God.

1243
01:15:33,711 --> 01:15:35,740
I immediately, I had like this, you know,

1244
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:39,520
bugs bunny image of him chasing me and
me running down and then, you know,

1245
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:43,690
whatever.
He didn't even notice me or,

1246
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:47,230
or it didn't give a shit. Yeah.
Apparently on Kodiak island,

1247
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:50,080
even though they're so enormous,
those bears are so terrifying.

1248
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:54,430
There's very few negative interactions
with human beings and that's one of the

1249
01:15:54,431 --> 01:15:57,190
reasons why some people thought
that that show the hunt,

1250
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,110
I don't know if you saw it,
it was a show that was on,

1251
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:03,460
I think it was on discovery
or one of those networks.
What history? Just recently.

1252
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:08,350
Yeah, it was Jonny Hughes did that.
Who's Johnny? He's, he's a guy.

1253
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:10,390
He's a writer. I know at, in fact,

1254
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:15,391
maybe I told this story on your podcast
about when he was in new new New Guinea

1255
01:16:16,331 --> 01:16:19,120
and he brought those people back,
the natives back to London.

1256
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:22,600
Does that ring a bell? Anyway, I'm
interrupting. You rang a bell going with,

1257
01:16:22,601 --> 01:16:25,270
you're trying to remember what it was.

1258
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,580
It was a hosted by or narrated
by the lead singer of Metallica.

1259
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:35,610
James Hatfield and it was about taking
grizzly hunters to this one island in

1260
01:16:38,921 --> 01:16:43,770
Alaska that has the largest brown bears
in the world. They're fucking in Norris,

1261
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:47,800
Kodiak, Kodiak island. And but the
thing is they're just eating fish. Yeah.

1262
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,350
Fish and beached whales.
That's another thing they eat.

1263
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,200
They beached whale can a whale
dies and washed up on the beach.

1264
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:56,940
They'll eat that fucking whale for
weeks and weeks. They're disgusting.

1265
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:02,020
I looked at leat that rotten stinky whale
like yeah cause it's easier to digest

1266
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:05,420
French. Yeah. They just get
like cheese and like they,

1267
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:09,980
that's why you can play dead with
grizzlies but not black really

1268
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:12,860
can't play dead with black
parents. Well what I've, you know,

1269
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:16,400
look it up until he just start going to
be careful with bullshit I come up with

1270
01:17:16,401 --> 01:17:17,031
here.
Yeah.

1271
01:17:17,031 --> 01:17:21,290
What I've been told is that black
bears just eat you fresh grizzly bears.

1272
01:17:21,291 --> 01:17:24,410
We'll throw some dirt over here and come
back a week later because they like it

1273
01:17:24,411 --> 01:17:25,640
rotten.
That makes sense.

1274
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:29,690
Unless they're super hungry at the time
and they just gorge your guts and then

1275
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:33,680
slowly, that's one of the things they
do is they always eat the guts first.

1276
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,530
And women, you know about the
thing with women with the pussy,

1277
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:40,220
if they're having a period.
Yeah, it's really terrible.

1278
01:17:40,221 --> 01:17:43,070
Way To die first for the bear.

1279
01:17:43,071 --> 01:17:47,960
Have you seen the movie a grizzly man?
I love that.

1280
01:17:47,961 --> 01:17:51,280
That's a great movie. That was one of
my favorite unintentional comedies ever.

1281
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:53,840
I swear to God.
I think Werner Herzog,

1282
01:17:53,841 --> 01:17:56,900
I would love to get drunk with
that guy and ask him, come on man.

1283
01:17:56,900 --> 01:18:00,620
You knew you were being funny movie.
No, I have not. I would love to though.

1284
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:02,600
He's amazing.
He knows he's funny.

1285
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:07,190
I had that question about him and I
watched a bad lieutenant. Did you,

1286
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:12,050
have you seen this? No. He made a
remake of it with Nicholas Cage,

1287
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:17,540
uh, three, four years ago. Got To
watch her. Why would they do that?

1288
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:20,690
It's fantastic.
It's fantastic.

1289
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,660
Nicholas Cage is off the fucking rock.

1290
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:29,480
He's crazed in it.
It's really hard for me.

1291
01:18:29,481 --> 01:18:33,830
It's better. I'm a big Verner
hurt, shock Jesus. In your life.

1292
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,070
I love Verna Hertz,
man.

1293
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:40,550
Did you ever see him as a bad guy and
that shitty Tom Hanks movie or not Tom

1294
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:41,420
Hanks,
Tom Cruise movie.

1295
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:46,430
It was a Shitty Tom Cruise movie where
Tom Reach Jack reacher or something like

1296
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:48,890
that. I never saw that.
Oh, I was at pizza shit.

1297
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:51,650
We did a Tom cruise is like some
assassin or something like that.

1298
01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:55,940
Nobody can kill him. He kills everybody
and Werner Herzog is one of the bad guys.

1299
01:18:55,990 --> 01:19:00,290
Winds up killing Werner Herzog is such
a fucking clunky, stupid fucking movie,

1300
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:03,640
but he has a nice car. It drives a
nice 1970 Chevelle. Beautiful car.

1301
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:08,060
There is that. But Werner Herzog
is an actor in a rare moment,

1302
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:12,480
but when he talks, all you can
think of, he's teammate Treadwell.

1303
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:16,330
Timothy Treadwell in the
grizzly made pretty good. Yeah.

1304
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:21,260
[inaudible] of nature.
If you seen the Antarctic did,

1305
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:24,950
no, what does that, that's a great movie
and counters at the end of the world.

1306
01:19:24,951 --> 01:19:29,440
It's called. Oh, so Verna hertz talk, he's
like, he says at the beginning like, um,

1307
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:30,350
you know,

1308
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:35,210
some organization gave him $5 million
to make a movie about Antarctica.

1309
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:37,310
And he said, and I, I said to them,

1310
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,210
I will not make another movie
about the damn penguins.

1311
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:48,680
So the deal was like, here's 5 billion or
whatever it was, just go do what you do.

1312
01:19:48,681 --> 01:19:51,530
Right. So he goes down there and he, uh,

1313
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:55,790
first he's got this friend Henry Kaiser,
I think his name is,

1314
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:59,150
used to be the Henry Kaiser
Band set ring a bell.

1315
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:03,980
It's like in the late seventies, early
eighties, like a prog rock kind of band.

1316
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:09,310
He quit music and became an underwater
photographer and now he's like the best

1317
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,920
at, uh, under ice. Oh God.
Yeah. Imagining that, uh,

1318
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,620
you've had vim Hoff on here. I'm going
to go to Amsterdam and cause he's,

1319
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,980
I talked to his son and actually I was
texting with his son while you guys were

1320
01:20:22,981 --> 01:20:27,690
talking. Oh Wow. And uh, uh, his
son was like, yeah, we'll do it.

1321
01:20:27,691 --> 01:20:29,670
And I was like, but I don't want
to do a fucking Skype thing.

1322
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:33,560
I want to meet with him. He's like,
I think he's an amazing human being.

1323
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:38,220
So I go to Amsterdam a lot, so
sometime I'm going to go like, hang on.

1324
01:20:38,221 --> 01:20:42,090
His houseboat attitude radiates.
Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
When he's sitting across,

1325
01:20:42,091 --> 01:20:46,770
he's got this fucking magnetic
energy. He's like, just a real deal.

1326
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:49,770
Oh yeah, yeah. 26 world records.

1327
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:54,210
I'd say when you get over 20 world
records, you're the real deal. Well,

1328
01:20:54,370 --> 01:20:58,410
and it's like my buddy who's rich from
wind farms, it's like when, I mean,

1329
01:20:58,411 --> 01:20:59,340
I don't know when,

1330
01:20:59,341 --> 01:21:03,180
but what I've seen him on your show and
I've seen the vice thing and it's not

1331
01:21:03,181 --> 01:21:06,540
about, look how cool I
am. It's not ego like, oh,

1332
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:09,690
I gotta get another record
and prove, you know, whatever.

1333
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:12,810
The dude's connected to
something really deep.

1334
01:21:12,811 --> 01:21:14,920
And the whole thing with
his wife and you know,

1335
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:19,940
how it started is so like
beautiful and touching and sincere.

1336
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:24,330
Yeah. You know, it's not an ego. Like I
saw that film a Everest the other day.

1337
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:25,283
Have you seen that?

1338
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:30,780
It's based on the Krakauer book and it's
been there a drama. Right? It's a drama.

1339
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:35,030
Right. Well, but it's based on truth.
The true story of, of this, uh,

1340
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:39,080
I don't know if it's 10 years ago,
there was a day when like 10 people died.

1341
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:42,750
It was the most disastrous day on
Everest ever and all this shit.

1342
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:45,810
But I was watching that and it's like,
okay,

1343
01:21:45,811 --> 01:21:49,890
you guys are all climbing Mount
Everest. Why? Who gives a fuck?

1344
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:54,840
It's all ego, ego. Like it looks
really cool from the valley,

1345
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:57,030
you know?
I mean it really does.

1346
01:21:57,031 --> 01:22:00,780
You don't need to like what is it
about you that you need to say?

1347
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,780
I was at the top of Everest,
you know,

1348
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:07,560
with my oxygen tanks and the five
Sherpas carrying all my shit, you know,

1349
01:22:07,561 --> 01:22:11,430
and I paid 60 grand to the guide
to like drag my sorry ass up there.

1350
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:16,100
I just felt like, Eh, fuck that.
But then when you know, Eh,

1351
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:18,810
that's a whole different thing.
It's not about ego.

1352
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:23,960
Well he also did it in his fucking shorts
with no shirt and he said he was like,

1353
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:26,580
to do it with clothes is too easy.

1354
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,100
Like that's one of the things
he said it would really be easy.

1355
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,520
There was a recent article,
I forget what publication,

1356
01:22:32,521 --> 01:22:36,210
but when some online thing where they
were talking about the business of going

1357
01:22:36,211 --> 01:22:37,044
to Everest,

1358
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:41,070
that it's like this eco tourists
business now where you get all these rich

1359
01:22:41,071 --> 01:22:44,040
people and the higher the Sherpas
that do all the dirty work,

1360
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:47,850
all the hard stuff carrying the oxygen,
carrying the food, carrying everything.

1361
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:51,540
And all these people do is they sit in
their warm tents and they put on their

1362
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:54,780
warm clothes and then they go where the
Sherpas tell them and they feel like

1363
01:22:54,781 --> 01:22:58,230
heroes. Yeah, but I used to do
a whole bit about Mount Everest,

1364
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,960
that it's not like when you get to the
top of lucky charms guys waiting for you

1365
01:23:00,961 --> 01:23:04,080
with a bag of gold. Ah,
finally have reached the top.

1366
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,970
Now you don't have work again for the rest

1367
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:09,150
your life. Come with me. There's
free pussy and cocoa and attend.

1368
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:14,160
Below is this bit about like the idea
of climbing to the top spot is like

1369
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:18,280
impressive, but nobody gives a fuck if
you got to the lowest spot. Like nobody,

1370
01:23:18,281 --> 01:23:21,010
like I get to the lowest spot on
earth, bro. Like, what's it like?

1371
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:25,340
You go down and then you go straight.
You get to the bottom. There's nowhere.

1372
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:28,120
You can't go any further.
You're so brave.

1373
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:30,810
Like no one cares about the lowest spot,
but everybody cares.

1374
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:35,260
Mariana's trench a little while that's
dead. It was pretty good in the ocean.

1375
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:39,640
Yeah. When you go in the ocean, that's
anytime work death valley or something.

1376
01:23:39,641 --> 01:23:39,880
Yeah.

1377
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:44,370
That's just like there's some stupid
chimp thing about going to the top branch

1378
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:49,150
is because like we associate the highest
branches with being safe from the

1379
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:53,620
predators. Like that's the reason why
bedrooms have like if you have a house.

1380
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:56,500
Yeah, the master bedroom is
almost always on the top floor.

1381
01:23:56,770 --> 01:24:00,700
And the reason is it's like you want
to be above to like look down at the

1382
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:01,620
potential predators.

1383
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:06,630
Like there's an association people
believe with chimps and trees and human

1384
01:24:07,031 --> 01:24:09,670
beings and having like houses
that are on the top war,

1385
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:13,390
the master bedroom's on the top. That up.
Jamie, that sounds like bullshit to me.

1386
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:18,430
It does sound like bullshit. Again,
this is something I read. I'm thinking,

1387
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:19,211
uh,

1388
01:24:19,211 --> 01:24:24,211
the bedrooms being on top comes from
the centuries where people lived above

1389
01:24:24,611 --> 01:24:28,600
their domesticated animals and the heat
from the animals rose up and heated

1390
01:24:28,601 --> 01:24:33,380
their bedroom. What farts? Animal
Farm. Animal Heat. Body Heat. Really?

1391
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:37,720
Yeah. Boy, that's an interesting theory.
But like Tibet, people live above their,

1392
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:40,350
their ox. Yeah, that's
what I'm sure saying.

1393
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:42,580
I would think it would be more
of a security thing though.

1394
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:44,950
I'd like to live in a cave.
If you're above,

1395
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:48,530
like people have to get to you and it's
way better strategically to be a time

1396
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:51,450
you have a view. It's always
nice to have a view. That's nice.

1397
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,280
You like to live in a cave. This is a k
for say on Bisbee, Arizona were ducks.

1398
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,170
Dan Hopeless.
Maybe you don't buy it.

1399
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:59,770
I had a house built into a cave to
go to a busy bee and check that out.

1400
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:04,210
I want to go before Doug dies. I don't
know how much longer he's got left.

1401
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:08,080
He's hoping he's going to hang in there
for a long time. But you're right. I mean,

1402
01:25:08,081 --> 01:25:11,110
I know he's a bit of a wild man.
Probably live forever.

1403
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:15,910
He'll do a Keith Richards pissing on
Migraine, but he, uh, he has hernia.

1404
01:25:15,911 --> 01:25:20,680
It's like he can lie on his back and
flex the stomach and like is bulges like

1405
01:25:20,681 --> 01:25:23,800
his bulges in his stomach where
they pop out in several places.

1406
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:27,490
Like his internal organs are like
trying to escape from his body cavity.

1407
01:25:27,491 --> 01:25:30,820
It's got to get that shit sewn up. No,
he won't do it. It's not going to happen.

1408
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,100
We'll take care of that shit
with Budweiser and cigarettes.

1409
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:40,720
A little duct tape mocks
me, mocks me, and he goes,

1410
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:45,850
how many surgeries have you had? Rogan
and Lincoln had a fuck load. None.

1411
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:53,230
That's like his bear. A barometer
for like, who's healthier?

1412
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:57,180
Who's living a healthier life? I've
been fucking stitch back together again.

1413
01:25:57,250 --> 01:26:01,480
Six or seven times. None. I resonate
with that sometimes. You know,

1414
01:26:01,481 --> 01:26:04,910
I see somebody getting hurt some and
I'm like, yeah, didn't happen to me.

1415
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:09,940
Look at me. I'm sitting here
saying, buy a surfboard. It didn't.

1416
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:12,500
And then a gun. What did
you like? Laird Hamilton,

1417
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:14,690
the out there every day looking sleek.

1418
01:26:14,691 --> 01:26:18,410
Call six Paki and shit flexing
as your fucking ride. The wave.

1419
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:21,590
I don't know what it
would do for me though.

1420
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:25,090
Well you read that thing that I
wrote for Esquire. I do the, um,

1421
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,031
the idea of you're,

1422
01:26:26,031 --> 01:26:30,130
you're the human body's ultimately a
lot like a sand castle and that, yeah.

1423
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:35,270
And that's really at the end of the day,
I mean enjoy it while you've got it,

1424
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:38,850
but at the end of the day, it's pretty
much pointless. I mean, we really are,

1425
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:42,330
you know, Kubler Ross's five
stages of grief, right? The,

1426
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:45,320
you know what I'm talking about?
I've heard that expression,

1427
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:46,480
but I don't know what they are.

1428
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:51,810
It's good to memorize cause you see them
everywhere that the acronym is Dab de

1429
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:57,080
da De da. So it's denial. So this is
whether you're like losing your job,

1430
01:26:57,140 --> 01:26:58,670
your marriage,
you,

1431
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:03,671
someone close to you dying or you just
got like the pancreatic cancer diagnosis,

1432
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:04,970
right?
It's all the same.

1433
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:09,170
And you and some people skip stages and
never get to the lower ones, whatever.

1434
01:27:09,171 --> 01:27:13,820
But the sequence is denial,
anger, so denial like, oh no,

1435
01:27:13,821 --> 01:27:16,790
there's a mistake. This can't be right.
Right. Then there's anger. Like why me?

1436
01:27:16,791 --> 01:27:20,690
That's not fair. I don't smoke. And
uh, and then there's bargaining. Okay,

1437
01:27:20,691 --> 01:27:23,570
I look from now on,
I'm going to work out right from now on,

1438
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:24,710
I'm going to eat right,
I'm going to,

1439
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:29,380
and then there's a depression
and then there's acceptance.

1440
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:33,920
Acceptance is if you're lucky enough and
evolved enough and psychedelics I think

1441
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:36,560
really help get to the acceptance stage.

1442
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:41,300
That's why they're so a psilocybin,
so effective with end of life, uh,

1443
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:44,030
treatment for anxiety.
People are facing the end.

1444
01:27:44,031 --> 01:27:47,760
They take a silicide been dose and
have an experience in there. Like, Oh,

1445
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,430
I'm not afraid of dying anymore.

1446
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,160
It's supposed to be one of the most
amazing things for people on that. Yeah.

1447
01:27:52,161 --> 01:27:54,320
It helps them accept this idea.

1448
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:59,480
I remember Larry Hagman was talking about
that in this interview that he did on

1449
01:27:59,481 --> 01:28:04,210
CNN of all places. And uh, they were
interviewing him about, you know, like,

1450
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:09,230
like times in his life and you know,
what, what, what like impactful moments.

1451
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:14,240
And he said, well, the
last time I took Lsd,

1452
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:17,960
and you could tell like the
person who was interviewing him,

1453
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:20,120
who was interviewing him, it
didn't expect that. And he said,

1454
01:28:20,121 --> 01:28:24,740
bullied it alleviated my fear of dying.
I really, I no longer worry about death,

1455
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:27,740
you know?
And he said the experience,

1456
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:32,030
whatever he had when he was on Lsd
was so profound that it's sort of like

1457
01:28:32,031 --> 01:28:34,370
relaxed into, and he had
that air about him too. Like,

1458
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:38,690
like a guy who was just there. He's
there, he's not like putting on a show.

1459
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:43,190
He's not like faking it and he's
not, he's just there. He's, he's him,

1460
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:43,880
you know.

1461
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:48,110
And he lived at like a fairly sustainable
life for a wealthy famous guy.

1462
01:28:48,111 --> 01:28:52,730
Had He, I think, I believe his
house was completely off the grid.

1463
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:55,390
I had some house in the
Santa Monica Mountains. Yeah,

1464
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,060
I remember reading something about that.

1465
01:28:57,130 --> 01:28:58,760
And I wonder if his house
was still available.

1466
01:28:58,761 --> 01:29:02,880
I'd look to fucking by Larry Hagman's
house. Pretty Dope. Better than a cave?

1467
01:29:02,881 --> 01:29:04,830
Probably, yes. Maybe not though.

1468
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:07,740
Cave would probably like be really
efficient as far as like keeping you cool

1469
01:29:07,741 --> 01:29:10,620
temperature, same all year
round. You know, it's,

1470
01:29:10,621 --> 01:29:13,740
you can have like grass growing
on the roof. That's pretty dirty.

1471
01:29:13,741 --> 01:29:16,350
Fucking hobbit house.
Remember they had those big brown doors,

1472
01:29:16,930 --> 01:29:20,730
the side of the Shyer, well you
know this thing about fear of death,

1473
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:24,240
you were talking earlier about um,
making sex,

1474
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:28,200
like restricting access and then using it
as a lure to get people to work, right?

1475
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:32,910
Yeah. So in, in civilized to death, the
last chapter that have just written,

1476
01:29:32,911 --> 01:29:37,040
by the way, I'm fucking done while I'm
in the rewrites now. But like, yeah,

1477
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:41,560
you hit the end of the book. So now it's
just about editing and rewrites and,

1478
01:29:41,561 --> 01:29:46,470
but you know how they say like work
expands to fill the space allotted to it.

1479
01:29:47,070 --> 01:29:51,210
Well, I've been in the U S for
like four years off and on. Right.

1480
01:29:51,211 --> 01:29:55,110
And like I finally decided like, no,
we're going back to Spain end of December.

1481
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,990
So the book gets done in
November. Of course, of course,

1482
01:29:58,030 --> 01:29:59,490
because you had a deadline.

1483
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,590
A lot of people say that
with a lot of things they do,

1484
01:30:01,591 --> 01:30:06,591
like they like deadlines because deadlines
or force you to fucking just cram

1485
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,890
that work in and, and it eliminates
any possibility of excuses.

1486
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:15,060
If you have a deadline, I just
blow by deadlines. Do you? Yeah,

1487
01:30:15,061 --> 01:30:18,510
it's gotta be structural in my life.
If it's someone telling me, Chris,

1488
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:22,500
it's gotta be done by Tuesday. I'm
like, yeah, whatever. That's negotiable,

1489
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,410
but I feel like I'm moving to
Spain and December. All right,

1490
01:30:25,411 --> 01:30:30,000
and then you finish it in time because I
got no kids. I got no mortgage. I mean,

1491
01:30:30,001 --> 01:30:34,860
I do, but it's nothing and it's
like, well, I don't really, yeah.

1492
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:37,860
I had this conversation with a friend
of mine and obviously, you know,

1493
01:30:37,861 --> 01:30:42,330
I have kids and I love having kids. I love
my family. I'm very, very, very happy.

1494
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:44,220
Couldn't,
wouldn't want it any other way,

1495
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:47,340
but I have this conversation with
my friend who also has a family.

1496
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:50,070
It also has kids, and we were
talking about this guy we know,

1497
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,640
I want to say his name. He's a
successful guy, he's wealthy,

1498
01:30:53,641 --> 01:30:57,600
he's doing really well. He's a well loved
guy, but he doesn't have any children,

1499
01:30:58,110 --> 01:31:01,830
and he goes, fucking sad. I
go, why is he sad? And he goes,

1500
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:05,490
she doesn't have any kids sad.
He goes, what's it all for? I go,

1501
01:31:05,491 --> 01:31:07,740
what's yours off for? I
go, you're going to have,

1502
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,610
you're going to give it to your
kids and they're going to die too.

1503
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,390
Fuck difference. Does
it make I go, I don't,

1504
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:15,540
I used to resent that when
I didn't have children.

1505
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:20,010
I always resented this
idea that a meaningful life
only involves reproduction.

1506
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:24,630
I resent it today and I love my kids.
I resent it. I think that's nonsense.

1507
01:31:24,631 --> 01:31:28,260
I think you could have a beautiful,
meaningful life and never reproduce.

1508
01:31:28,261 --> 01:31:32,370
You don't need to reproduce.
How do you affect the people around you?

1509
01:31:32,371 --> 01:31:34,200
How do you feel?
My family,

1510
01:31:34,201 --> 01:31:37,950
it's not just my family of the
children I've made and my wife,

1511
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:42,540
my family is my friends. The people I
love. Those are my family. You know,

1512
01:31:42,541 --> 01:31:45,900
like a family, like put it,
put whatever word you know,

1513
01:31:45,901 --> 01:31:47,910
call it whatever noise you
want to make with your face.

1514
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:53,180
But what's important to me is who you
love and who you take in and who you

1515
01:31:53,191 --> 01:31:57,810
surround yourself with.
I have this group of amazing,

1516
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:00,100
beautiful people I share time

1517
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:05,100
with and whether they were born out of
my wife's pussy or whether they were born

1518
01:32:05,201 --> 01:32:07,980
out of someone else's pussy,
who cares like that.

1519
01:32:07,981 --> 01:32:12,940
This idea that it's only meaningful if
you surround yourself with people that

1520
01:32:12,941 --> 01:32:16,960
came out of, you know, your
own Dna I think is it's so,

1521
01:32:16,961 --> 01:32:21,910
it's not just shortsighted,
it's dangerously egotistical.
I think it's just,

1522
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:24,160
it's bad for you.
It's bad for everybody.

1523
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:28,980
I think it's, it's an avoidance of death.
Yeah. And that's what I was gonna say,

1524
01:32:28,981 --> 01:32:30,270
like you were talking about sex.

1525
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:34,560
What I argue in the end of this book is
that there's also a mechanism built the

1526
01:32:34,561 --> 01:32:38,490
same sort of mechanism built around
death. That we're terrified. We're the,

1527
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:43,890
we're the only animal that knows
it dies, right? Homo Sapiens,

1528
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:47,010
sapiens, the homeowner who
knows it knows what do we know?

1529
01:32:47,011 --> 01:32:49,440
We know we're going to die.
So what did we do then?

1530
01:32:49,441 --> 01:32:52,690
We develop all these mechanisms,
some conscious,

1531
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:55,980
some not for avoiding thinking about that.

1532
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,590
And I think civilization is one of them.

1533
01:32:58,591 --> 01:33:03,180
We align ourselves with something
bigger than ourselves. So, you know,

1534
01:33:03,181 --> 01:33:06,510
and there's all this really interesting
research on terror management theory.

1535
01:33:06,511 --> 01:33:10,240
It's called, where they look at
the subconscious mechanisms. Uh,

1536
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,990
when people are reminded of mortality,

1537
01:33:12,991 --> 01:33:15,780
they react differently to
people outside their group.

1538
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:19,350
They're much more aggressive and
much more aligned with the, you know,

1539
01:33:19,351 --> 01:33:24,120
the identity of their group and all that.
Um, but so that, that's what I'm arguing.

1540
01:33:24,121 --> 01:33:26,820
And I think the reason, think
about psychedelics, right?

1541
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:31,770
And you've heard this a million times.
Every culture that's had access to them,

1542
01:33:31,771 --> 01:33:35,220
he's seen them as the greatest
gifts of the gods, the greatest,

1543
01:33:35,221 --> 01:33:39,210
most sacred things that
we have in America.

1544
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:42,690
You get busted with a bag
of mushrooms at a concert.

1545
01:33:42,691 --> 01:33:47,350
You go to prison longer than if you
kill somebody. Think about that.

1546
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:50,990
What does that mean? What the
fuck are we? So afraid you have

1547
01:33:50,990 --> 01:33:54,830
a Duffel bag filled with mushrooms
and you're selling them at a concert.

1548
01:33:54,831 --> 01:33:59,270
It is literally possible that you
will have a larger prison sentence.

1549
01:33:59,271 --> 01:34:01,160
And if you accidentally kill
someone in a street fight,

1550
01:34:01,161 --> 01:34:02,740
minimum mandatory sentencing,
right?

1551
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:07,520
Second degree murder versus distribution
schedule one psychedelics. Yeah.

1552
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:11,510
I know a guy who's doing anything
here a year for manslaughter a year,

1553
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:16,220
he's doing a year. He shot someone in
a road rage incident a year, a year.

1554
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:18,620
And if he had mushrooms in his
car, it'd be 10 years. Yeah.

1555
01:34:18,770 --> 01:34:21,920
It's very possible if you're in the wrong
place, the wrong part of the country,

1556
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:24,440
the wrong judge.
And what do mushrooms do?

1557
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:28,670
They give you peace or they
freak out depending on how, how,

1558
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:32,720
how hard you're holding on to it.
You hold it on those bad trips.

1559
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:36,860
I've never had a bad trip on mushrooms,
but I understand where they come from.

1560
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:38,190
I've had bad trips on weed.

1561
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:43,070
I've had those woo over eating to a tree.

1562
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:47,980
That's especially early in my career as a,
a,

1563
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:50,780
a psycho, not a, yeah, I had some fucking,

1564
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:55,340
because like we're were talking about
before they make sprays now ladies and

1565
01:34:55,341 --> 01:35:00,140
gentlemen, I just want to be honest. Uh,
I'm not entirely sober right now, uh,

1566
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:04,960
for the show or a little
spray under my tongue and um,

1567
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:08,930
they make stuff that's too fucking strong.
Like Joey Diaz,

1568
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,630
who's the savage of all savages.

1569
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:16,550
What he does is he'll take
a 500 milligram THC candy,

1570
01:35:16,850 --> 01:35:20,030
which um, you know what I like? I like 20.

1571
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:24,890
I like the 20 twenty's a good dose. Like
before I go on stage, I like our 20.

1572
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:28,490
It's not strong, it's light.
It's a little fun with happy.

1573
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:33,880
He'll take off fucking 500 and then he
takes a rapper for a cheaper lower dose

1574
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:39,020
and he puts the 500 in the lower dose
rapper and he gives them to people.

1575
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,330
Uh,
see that's not cool

1576
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:49,240
to him at school. He loves it. He loves
dosing people. I'm very against that.

1577
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,670
I mean I spent a lot of
time around psychedelics and
that's the one thing that I

1578
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:58,420
could never forgive. If you ever
heard a Dunkin story about Joey,

1579
01:35:58,990 --> 01:36:03,990
Joey gave Dunkin some fucking cookie
of death and it was just unbelievably

1580
01:36:04,631 --> 01:36:07,940
powerful. And he told Dunkin, look,
you know, just see it. Just, you know,

1581
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:11,530
how strong is it? It's not that
bad. Just eat it. So Dunkin eats it.

1582
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:16,570
An hour later he is at his home
in a fucking tornado of terror,

1583
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:21,820
just spiraling, freaking out. And then
he gets a phone call and it's Joey Diaz.

1584
01:36:21,821 --> 01:36:23,200
He goes,
welcome to my world.

1585
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:32,320
I guess. I guess if it's coming from
Joey Diaz, you should know better.

1586
01:36:32,350 --> 01:36:34,760
That's the guy though.
I mean that's just Joey's,

1587
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:40,300
that's what you get when you do it
with Joey. I'd love that guy. I'm so,

1588
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:45,340
I'm so happy. I know him. So
happy he exists. I've had one bad,

1589
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:48,850
bad. I mean, I've had crazy
shit happen. You know,

1590
01:36:48,851 --> 01:36:52,360
like I probably have told you the story
about when I got stung by a Scorpion

1591
01:36:52,361 --> 01:36:56,650
when I was tripping. Oh yeah.
So I mean I've had, and I
thought I was going to die.

1592
01:36:56,651 --> 01:36:59,320
Right. But that ended up being
a really good experience.

1593
01:36:59,321 --> 01:37:04,220
But the last time I did acid,
I did a heroic dose. Don't,
don't, don't, don't. Yeah.

1594
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:06,220
And it ended,
I won't go through the whole story,

1595
01:37:06,221 --> 01:37:11,221
but it ended with me wandering onto the
grounds of a psychiatric hospital and

1596
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:13,680
hiding the metal filings.

1597
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:18,160
And I heard all these weird voices and
I hid under this Rhododendron Bush.

1598
01:37:18,490 --> 01:37:22,080
And it turns out that they were the
patients taking a walk and they were like

1599
01:37:22,090 --> 01:37:25,390
wandering the grounds and I'm like,
cowering under this Rhododendron Bush.

1600
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:30,350
Like having cried and lost my shirt
and you know, I was just a fucking

1601
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:35,440
tired and my face.
Thank God

1602
01:37:37,230 --> 01:37:40,360
I can lock you up. Yeah. It's
crazy. Bastard. Or I'm a doctor.

1603
01:37:41,410 --> 01:37:45,790
My name is Chris Ryan. I want to wrote a
book about sex. No, not that Chris Ryan,

1604
01:37:45,910 --> 01:37:50,440
the other groups. Ryan Nolan.
Ryan the picture. Oh my God.

1605
01:37:50,441 --> 01:37:54,520
You know about that research where
they, uh, I think it was at Yale,

1606
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:56,070
um,
in

1607
01:37:56,070 --> 01:38:00,120
a psychiatry residents.
The teacher said, okay,

1608
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:02,990
the project is this weekend,
you have to go out.

1609
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,830
There were like six or seven students
had to go out and check themselves into a

1610
01:38:07,831 --> 01:38:12,420
psychiatric hospital. Ooh. Um,
separate different ones. Right.

1611
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,620
Saying that they were hearing voices that
we're telling them to hurt themselves,

1612
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:22,050
check in and then spend the night and
then the next day explaining the situation

1613
01:38:22,051 --> 01:38:23,010
and come back.

1614
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:27,480
And none of them could get out because
they wouldn't believe cause they're like,

1615
01:38:27,481 --> 01:38:32,040
no, listen, I'm a medical student. I go
to Yale, my professor, this was a project?

1616
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:35,790
No, not one of them could get out.
Wow. So how did they get them out?

1617
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:37,230
Because the professor went,
oh,

1618
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:40,650
because the professor knew that
was going to happen. Right. Wow.

1619
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:41,431
Cause he's like he,

1620
01:38:41,431 --> 01:38:45,960
it was to show like how helpless
psychiatric patients are.

1621
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,570
Cause even when they're telling you
the truth, you don't believe him.

1622
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:52,080
Well he's not always the case. Like when
everyone's being accused of anything,

1623
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:56,940
you feel guilty even if you're not like
I've been pulled over before and been

1624
01:38:56,941 --> 01:38:58,410
stone cold sober.

1625
01:38:58,590 --> 01:39:03,270
And especially before I was famous
and worried that I'm not sober,

1626
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:07,110
that I did something wrong with the
cops. Like what did I do? What did I do?

1627
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:10,630
You start going through your Rolodex
of Shit that you might've done but he

1628
01:39:10,631 --> 01:39:13,830
didn't do anything. And that's where
ended to false confessions a lot of times.

1629
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:16,470
Well listen,
if you put enough pressure on people,

1630
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:20,460
especially if you lock them up and like
this is what the fuck is going on with

1631
01:39:20,461 --> 01:39:21,360
Guantanamo Bay,

1632
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:25,110
they just released this guy that just was
in there for 14 years and have a story

1633
01:39:25,111 --> 01:39:27,390
about it and then being beaten
and he was fucking innocent.

1634
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:30,200
He didn't do anything. They had no
charges. There was no, there's no,

1635
01:39:30,201 --> 01:39:35,201
no reason to detain him to suspicion and
suspicion is a very weird thing cause

1636
01:39:36,271 --> 01:39:40,500
if I suspect you, what do you plot and
Chris Ryan, you come on my podcast,

1637
01:39:40,501 --> 01:39:43,680
but I think you've got to fucking
and alternative intention.

1638
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:48,140
There's something going on behind
your eyes. I see it out. I figure,

1639
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:49,770
oh you're here for my fucking free coffee.

1640
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:54,150
You know like when people start
like accusing you of things,

1641
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,850
you start wondering about
your own intentions.

1642
01:39:57,090 --> 01:40:02,090
You start like we exist in some sort of
a strange state where we're constantly

1643
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:06,930
in seeking approval.
We seek approval from each other and we,

1644
01:40:06,931 --> 01:40:11,931
we like to live in at least some
somewhat of a state of harmony with our

1645
01:40:11,971 --> 01:40:13,590
neighbors and our friends
and our community.

1646
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:18,860
And when someone is pointing to you at
being a disruptor of harmony in some way,

1647
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:22,080
shape, or form, you know, like if
you're in a relationship, I've,

1648
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:25,650
I've had friends that had
been in relationships like,
man, my fucking girlfriend,

1649
01:40:25,651 --> 01:40:28,360
she's always accusing me of doing
this and accusing me of doing that.

1650
01:40:28,361 --> 01:40:31,350
And I'm like, you got to get break
up with her because that, that'll,

1651
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:34,100
that'll you'll get sucked into that world.
Yeah.

1652
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:39,200
You will get sucked into her world of
anxiety and craziness and you'll become

1653
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:42,270
something different than you are now.

1654
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:44,340
You'll become what she's
accusing you of being.

1655
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:48,540
If you don't become that you at the
very least be a mess because you're

1656
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:51,930
constantly defending yourself. Like, I'm
just going to deal with it. I'll go home,

1657
01:40:51,931 --> 01:40:54,100
I'll talk to her. Like, this is the, the,

1658
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:57,940
that is the embodiment. That is the
definition of a codependent relationship.

1659
01:40:57,970 --> 01:41:02,020
Right? Like you're, you're allowing
her to be this accusatory person or he,

1660
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:04,780
you know, allow a golden woman
with a man. Same thing. It hasn't,

1661
01:41:04,781 --> 01:41:06,880
it's not sex dependent
or gender dependent,

1662
01:41:06,881 --> 01:41:11,740
but it's this weird thing that happens
to people when someone starts pointing at

1663
01:41:11,741 --> 01:41:15,450
you and saying, you know
what, Chris, you're just a
fucking asshole. You know you,

1664
01:41:15,451 --> 01:41:18,640
you just, you don't care about anybody
but yourself. And you're like, do I?

1665
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:21,190
God Damn it, you start. We'll have
to look at yourself and go, is this,

1666
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:25,000
is this true? And if someone says it
enough, you'll start to think it's true.

1667
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:26,140
You start to believe it.

1668
01:41:26,230 --> 01:41:30,010
So if you get a guy and you lock them
up in some fucking cage and everyday you

1669
01:41:30,011 --> 01:41:32,830
tell him that he's a criminal and you ever
day, you tell them you're a terrorist,

1670
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:35,060
you're plotting with Isis here.
Ah,

1671
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:37,210
you fucking put an orange
jumpsuit in them and,

1672
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:40,540
and then he does want to kill you.
Then before you know it,

1673
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:45,070
they're fucking memory is so distorted
and twisted by years of beatings and

1674
01:41:45,071 --> 01:41:47,890
you're feeding them dog food and
kicking them in the deck. Oh,

1675
01:41:47,891 --> 01:41:51,850
who is that guy anymore? 14 years in
Guantanamo Bay and they let them go.

1676
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:55,770
I would be amazed if he doesn't become a
terrorist now. Yeah. It would be amazing.

1677
01:41:57,140 --> 01:42:02,140
No better breeding ground for terrorists
than a terrorist in prison or criminal

1678
01:42:02,711 --> 01:42:06,640
camp. Yeah. Then prison, look at our
criminal justice system. It's a Mac.

1679
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,910
It's not about helping anyone.
It's not about reducing crime.

1680
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:14,450
It's just responding to some
primordial revenge fantasy,

1681
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:19,480
which we know perfectly
doesn't work, especially for
shit like nonviolent crimes,

1682
01:42:19,481 --> 01:42:22,690
which is a giant percentage
of our prisons. Yeah.

1683
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:26,890
I mean that is like one of the sickest
aspects of our culture that we have more

1684
01:42:26,891 --> 01:42:30,280
people in prison.
Then all the countries in the world,

1685
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:35,130
there's no one in any other
country including military
police states. Yeah. Yeah.

1686
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:39,220
It's crazy. It's, it's fucking, it's the
land of the free, right home of the brave.

1687
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,680
That's right.
Yeah,

1688
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:44,950
and you're going to go to France and
sitting in the Back Bay and France and

1689
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:48,760
Spain. Same Shit. Oh, it's on the fourth
or you're talking about me personally.

1690
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:51,850
Well, you are going to escape.
I beautiful country here.

1691
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:53,230
I'm going to Columbia first though.

1692
01:42:53,231 --> 01:42:57,180
I think I'm going to go
hang on my friend's yacht
in the Caribbean for awhile,

1693
01:42:57,181 --> 01:42:58,090
so hang with that dude.

1694
01:42:58,130 --> 01:43:02,590
CFLA stay taller if I were
really ballsy cause he's,

1695
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:07,210
he's doing Christmas with
his family elsewhere and I
know that Yod is sitting in

1696
01:43:07,211 --> 01:43:11,500
the British Virgin Islands empty right
now with the crew. But just your luck,

1697
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:13,510
you'll get on it by herself
and that's when the pirates,

1698
01:43:13,511 --> 01:43:17,140
we'll call him planning on
kidnapping. I'll defend it, you know,

1699
01:43:17,141 --> 01:43:21,830
and like I'm Chris Ryan, I'm an
author. I'm not a billionaire. Exactly.

1700
01:43:21,831 --> 01:43:26,500
We saw your Ted talk be
dead is only funded itch.

1701
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:29,260
It's good.
Yeah.

1702
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:33,580
Fucking yachts are weird in that sense
in that if you have one Mike man,

1703
01:43:33,581 --> 01:43:35,020
it's beautiful and it's amazing,

1704
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:39,220
but people look at that floating
fucking thing and it's a bank.

1705
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:42,130
It's like a floating bank inside of it.
There's money.

1706
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:44,020
You just got to figure
out how to extract it.

1707
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:47,950
And if you can grab one of those people
that's inside of it and take them and

1708
01:43:47,951 --> 01:43:51,350
whisk them away and then contact
the other people and say, hey,

1709
01:43:51,351 --> 01:43:51,980
you got to give me some of

1710
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:55,850
that money. If you want one
of these people back. But
on the other hand, a yacht,

1711
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:59,210
this big e,
if you take someone off that yacht,

1712
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:02,090
you're going to have some serious
guys come and look. And for you,

1713
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:05,330
it's not like a couple of old
people on a sailboat. Yeah.

1714
01:44:05,331 --> 01:44:07,610
But if you're in like Mexico,
they can't find El Chapo.

1715
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:09,410
If you can't get to El Chapo,

1716
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:13,310
I ain't going to hear you buy that
shit about El Chapo and the tunnel.

1717
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,410
I don't buy that.
What do you mean by it?

1718
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:18,230
I don't believe he escaped
through the tunnel. Why is that?

1719
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:20,570
Because you don't look,

1720
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:25,070
he's world famous for being the
dude who builds tunnels. Okay,

1721
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:28,970
well before they caught him, I didn't
know he was famous for being a dude.

1722
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:29,511
Oh yeah.

1723
01:44:29,511 --> 01:44:33,590
He's the dude who has all these tunnels
under the border with the train tracks

1724
01:44:33,591 --> 01:44:36,770
and all that. That's how he's like
this major smuggler. Right? Right.

1725
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:38,150
So he's the tunnel dude.

1726
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:42,080
And he's got all these teams of engineers
who are great at building tunnels,

1727
01:44:42,081 --> 01:44:44,270
and they're always finding them
in San Diego on all this. Right.

1728
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:49,040
So you finally catch the dude after he's
already escaped right from the other

1729
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:52,610
one five years ago or whatever that was.
She finally catch the dude again.

1730
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:57,020
You put them in the most
secure prison in Mexico,

1731
01:44:57,021 --> 01:44:57,771
number one,

1732
01:44:57,771 --> 01:45:02,771
supermax Mexican prison and dude's are
building a tunnel with power tools into

1733
01:45:05,001 --> 01:45:10,001
the prison and you don't hear it and
don't expect it and don't think about it.

1734
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:12,950
And they're like at some
fucking construction site,

1735
01:45:12,951 --> 01:45:15,050
a mile outside of the wall of the prison.

1736
01:45:15,051 --> 01:45:18,920
Then you're not checking that bull shit.
Give me a fucking break.

1737
01:45:18,921 --> 01:45:23,240
This guy paid off the prison guards.
That's why they're all arrested now.

1738
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:24,260
Paid off the,

1739
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:28,820
the head of the prison paid
off the senators and the
governors and the probably

1740
01:45:28,821 --> 01:45:31,820
the president and then they
built the tunnel to make,

1741
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:36,850
give a viable story for the dip shits
to like us to listen to and say, Oh,

1742
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:38,120
you skated through the Tono.
No,

1743
01:45:38,130 --> 01:45:40,850
he didn't any walked out the fucking
front door and got into a limo.

1744
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:44,660
Gimme a break, but they need the tunnel.
He definitely got out to the tunnel.

1745
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:48,350
There's video of it. There's
security video. But I agree with you.

1746
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:51,980
Who would then all the other ones who
gave us the security video of him going

1747
01:45:51,981 --> 01:45:54,680
behind that little wall and
crouching down and disappearing.

1748
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:57,610
Who gave us that video here to get
them through? Through the autonomy.

1749
01:45:57,620 --> 01:46:02,030
The tunnel exists. It exists as
a story. Oh, that's so strange.

1750
01:46:02,031 --> 01:46:05,110
You're a conspiracy theorist.
That's the dumbest conspiracy ever.

1751
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:09,560
The actually told exists, but it doesn't
mean he, he used it. That means it exists,

1752
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:12,270
so that will say, oh, you got out
through the tunnel of what age?

1753
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:15,110
We won't look at all
the people he paid off.

1754
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:17,840
I feel like I'm talking to Eddie
Bravo. This is, this is crazy.

1755
01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:19,940
Of course these deep paid off some people,

1756
01:46:19,941 --> 01:46:22,790
but I think you paid off some people
to allow him to build a tunnel.

1757
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:26,150
I think that's the outcomes razor
point of view. Yeah, I don't think so.

1758
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:29,360
I think the outcomes raise their point
of view is with the amount of corruption

1759
01:46:29,361 --> 01:46:33,260
that we know exists in the Mexican
government that he paid people off.

1760
01:46:33,261 --> 01:46:36,440
The guy's got billions of dollars.
You paid people off. They said, okay,

1761
01:46:36,441 --> 01:46:39,380
but we got to like come
up with some cover story.

1762
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:42,950
We can't just let you walk out the front
door because then it's obvious that you

1763
01:46:42,951 --> 01:46:46,010
paid us off because there's
no other explanation.

1764
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:50,160
So we make up this story of how we'll
okay have build a tunnel that'll take

1765
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,650
a couple of months. It's
fine. They build the tunnel.

1766
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:55,620
We say you went out through the tunnel
will leave this fucking evidence and

1767
01:46:55,621 --> 01:46:59,460
whatever, the little motor bike and all
this bullshit. And that's the story.

1768
01:46:59,461 --> 01:47:01,170
That's the way they do this
shit. Well, the tunnel,

1769
01:47:01,171 --> 01:47:05,490
it was a mile long and they say it took
a year. They say it took a year to build.

1770
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:10,140
Yeah, but because it had,
it had electricity in it.
Yeah. It had ventilation.

1771
01:47:10,170 --> 01:47:11,490
It had an electric bike.

1772
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:14,670
Like he hopped on electric bike and
shot down to the end of that thing.

1773
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:19,050
You don't buy it. I
don't put it in Mexico.

1774
01:47:19,051 --> 01:47:21,270
He's just fucking paint people off.
It's the way it works.

1775
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:26,100
This securest building in Mexico that
is like saying the prettiest gorilla,

1776
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:31,800
you know, the security, the
most secure prison in Mexico.

1777
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:35,340
Mexican prisons are pretty cool actually.
If you're going to go to prison,

1778
01:47:35,341 --> 01:47:38,430
Mexico is a good place. If you have a
little money. Oh, if you have bunny,

1779
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:41,130
if you have a little money you
don't need a lot. But like uh,

1780
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:42,960
cause in Mexican prisons,

1781
01:47:43,050 --> 01:47:46,500
you know like your wife can
come visit and stay with you.

1782
01:47:46,830 --> 01:47:51,510
You can have like good food. People can
bring you food, you can get cigarettes,

1783
01:47:51,511 --> 01:47:52,500
you can watch TV.

1784
01:47:52,530 --> 01:47:56,250
It's not like American where like you're
going to be in a sterile environment.

1785
01:47:56,910 --> 01:47:59,160
In Mexico there's a lot of their poorest,

1786
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:02,910
there's a lot of stuff you have to
stay there, but your wife can come,

1787
01:48:02,911 --> 01:48:07,490
your girlfriend can come, hookers
can come. Hookers. Real wow. Yeah.

1788
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:11,070
Wasn't that like one of the things that
they had been upset about him and the

1789
01:48:11,071 --> 01:48:15,600
previous incarceration that he had
been bringing in prostitutes? Yeah.

1790
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:19,690
He had like ran the prison. Yeah, but
he got out of that one too. Right.

1791
01:48:19,690 --> 01:48:21,700
And how do you get out of
that one? I'm like, whoa.

1792
01:48:21,930 --> 01:48:23,970
He said he like went
out through the laundry.

1793
01:48:23,971 --> 01:48:28,230
I think it was like in a laundry thing.
Well, there was a story recently,

1794
01:48:28,231 --> 01:48:31,170
we were actually talking about this in
a previous podcast that they had come

1795
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:34,830
very close to catching him, uh, like
within the last couple of weeks.

1796
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:37,990
And then he broke his leg jumping
out a window or something. Yeah.

1797
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:40,210
They said he believes he broke his leg.
Yeah.

1798
01:48:40,450 --> 01:48:44,700
He was wished away by a security
guards. El Chapo, who knows?

1799
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:50,060
This is terrifying that this gigantic
organized crime empire is built out of the

1800
01:48:52,441 --> 01:48:55,440
drug war because of
prohibition. They've, I mean,

1801
01:48:55,441 --> 01:48:59,280
it's no different than Al Capone during
the alcohol prohibition that we had.

1802
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:02,870
Yeah. That's really good.
That's, it's really interesting,
right? Yeah. Well it's,

1803
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:06,020
it's the same mechanism we've been
talking about all afternoons crashing.

1804
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:07,500
You repress it,
the pressure,

1805
01:49:07,501 --> 01:49:10,880
but it's like a steam engine or a
internal combustion engine, you know,

1806
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:13,230
create pressure,
no release.

1807
01:49:13,230 --> 01:49:17,310
And then use the energy of the
release for your own purposes. Yeah.

1808
01:49:17,330 --> 01:49:18,690
Just finds a way out.
Right.

1809
01:49:18,691 --> 01:49:23,340
If finds a little valve like my
poor girl with her shave vagina,

1810
01:49:24,270 --> 01:49:26,290
the girl from high school,
crazy girl,

1811
01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:30,120
the poor repress girl down curl was also,

1812
01:49:30,290 --> 01:49:34,620
this is the first girl that I ever met
that told me that she liked it when her

1813
01:49:34,621 --> 01:49:39,320
boyfriend hit her. Yeah. That was real,
cause we work together too. And uh,

1814
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:42,080
we were working together and she
was crying to me that, you know,

1815
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:45,990
this guy that this guy that she was dating
beat or the same guy shaved her pussy.

1816
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:48,040
He went whole hog.
It's crazy dude.

1817
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:52,030
But that he had a hit her and uh,
and she's like,

1818
01:49:52,031 --> 01:49:55,510
you know what's fucked up though?
I like it. And I was like, whoa.

1819
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,320
Like I remember thinking like, I don't
even know where to begin with this. I go,

1820
01:49:59,321 --> 01:50:02,580
you like it? She goes, I'm part of
it. I don't know what the fuck is.

1821
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:03,520
It just turns me on.

1822
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:06,370
Yeah. Well that, I mean, that relates
to what we were saying earlier.

1823
01:50:06,371 --> 01:50:09,940
Like we don't choose what we want.

1824
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,570
We don't choose what feels good.
Things feel good. I mean there's a,

1825
01:50:14,410 --> 01:50:17,520
I mean this is really a fucked up
thing to talk about, but it's real. Um,

1826
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:22,620
one of the reasons that
rape is so psychologically
damaging to women is a lot of

1827
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:26,260
women come when they're being raped.
Yeah.

1828
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:31,440
So there that imagine the schism that
that creates in your own experience where

1829
01:50:31,631 --> 01:50:32,170
you're like,

1830
01:50:32,170 --> 01:50:35,800
one part of you is saying this is the
worst fucking violation that's ever

1831
01:50:35,801 --> 01:50:40,520
happened in this guy has, you know,
is a monster and your body's coming.

1832
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,520
Yeah. Like what the fuck? And I, and see,

1833
01:50:42,521 --> 01:50:46,780
I think that's similar to what we were
talking about with these little boys who

1834
01:50:46,781 --> 01:50:51,580
are having experiences that gets sealed
as a pleasurable experience in one way.

1835
01:50:51,581 --> 01:50:55,990
Even though later they look back on it
and say that was a violation and a crime.

1836
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:58,280
So wild.
He's such a very,

1837
01:50:58,281 --> 01:51:01,880
very strange thing because it's
not just about reproducing,

1838
01:51:01,881 --> 01:51:06,500
it's there's psychological aspects to it.
There's sociological aspects to it.

1839
01:51:06,770 --> 01:51:10,910
There's forbidden things that
become more appealing because of it.

1840
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:13,250
It's so strange. What, what,

1841
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:17,540
what exists with human beings and that
it doesn't exist at all in any of the

1842
01:51:17,541 --> 01:51:18,374
animal world.

1843
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:22,670
This idea of being conscious and being
aware and if also contemplating all the

1844
01:51:22,671 --> 01:51:27,440
variables and at this sort of combines
together with the biological needs of

1845
01:51:27,441 --> 01:51:30,170
reproduction and it
creates this really potent,

1846
01:51:30,171 --> 01:51:33,440
confusing cocktail of ideas that gets,

1847
01:51:33,470 --> 01:51:36,780
I mean that's one of the reasons
why it's so offensive when you,

1848
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:41,330
you find out that someone that you know,

1849
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:41,900
uh,

1850
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:46,900
has either been raped or someone that
you know has been accused of raping

1851
01:51:47,931 --> 01:51:52,400
someone and they didn't do it or that
someone that you know has been involved

1852
01:51:52,401 --> 01:51:53,480
somehow in a rape,

1853
01:51:53,481 --> 01:51:56,840
like they were a part of a rape or
they maybe were in a gang bang rape or

1854
01:51:56,841 --> 01:51:58,460
something like that. It's just like, Whoa,

1855
01:51:58,461 --> 01:52:00,770
my whole world's been thrown upside down.

1856
01:52:00,771 --> 01:52:04,850
Like this idea of what people can and
can't do to each other. It's so crazy.

1857
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:10,040
It's human beings like forcing themselves
on other human beings is so strange.

1858
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:14,240
And then when you hear how many women
have rape fantasy, well you like, well,

1859
01:52:14,241 --> 01:52:19,000
well fuck Jesus Christ. That's
what you want. No, no, no,

1860
01:52:19,010 --> 01:52:23,330
no, no, no. It's what I enjoy thinking
about. Well what the fuck does that mean?

1861
01:52:23,331 --> 01:52:26,920
Do you want to get raped or no, no, no,
definitely not. But I fantasize about it.

1862
01:52:26,921 --> 01:52:31,470
It makes me calm. What? Yeah, what
are you saying? Like my buddy was, uh,

1863
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:33,560
having sex with his
girlfriend once and uh,

1864
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:38,420
she admitted while they're having sex
that what she really wants is a bunch of

1865
01:52:38,421 --> 01:52:42,890
black guys to come over and just fuck
the shit out of her against her will hold

1866
01:52:42,891 --> 01:52:46,460
her down and he and he, he'd never
thought about it the same way again.

1867
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:48,920
It was like he was fucked.
Like the relationship was done.

1868
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:52,850
It was like he couldn't handle it.
Yeah. Like she just wanted big,

1869
01:52:52,910 --> 01:52:57,230
muscular black guys to come over, just
fuck the shit out of it. Him just hold it,

1870
01:52:57,231 --> 01:53:01,820
shut up bitch and just, Oh, just, and
she didn't really want it to happen,

1871
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:05,930
but she wanted it to happen like in her
head, that was the fantasy, the fantasy.

1872
01:53:05,931 --> 01:53:07,340
Like when she would be alone,

1873
01:53:07,341 --> 01:53:09,890
no one's there and she would lock
her bedroom door and masturbate.

1874
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:12,200
She would be thinking about getting raped.

1875
01:53:12,770 --> 01:53:16,520
I can some crazy way like that.
She wanted that.

1876
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:18,200
She didn't want a
relationship with that guy.

1877
01:53:18,350 --> 01:53:21,770
She didn't want that guy to nuzzle her
take care of her and cuddle and watch

1878
01:53:21,771 --> 01:53:22,970
Netflix.
No,

1879
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:28,060
she wanted that guys come in her body
to make some like super potent a child

1880
01:53:28,821 --> 01:53:30,260
birthed out of violence.

1881
01:53:31,650 --> 01:53:34,620
Hey animal passion man as fuck though.
Right.

1882
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:37,050
That's the last remnants of that.
Yeah.

1883
01:53:37,051 --> 01:53:41,550
Well I don't know the last five minutes
but I mean, you know the UFC fighting.

1884
01:53:41,551 --> 01:53:45,450
What's that? You know that's animal
passion. That's animal like basic.

1885
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:48,690
I mean I know there's art to it and you
know the way you look at it's different

1886
01:53:48,691 --> 01:53:49,524
than the way I look at it.

1887
01:53:49,650 --> 01:53:54,650
But I look at it and I see two dudes
like unleashing the inner beast.

1888
01:53:55,110 --> 01:53:56,090
It's hard to argue,
you know,

1889
01:53:56,170 --> 01:53:59,040
all the arguments to women and
you know in the case of the women.

1890
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:02,550
But what about these cases you read
about every once in a while where like,

1891
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:08,170
like a dude goes to a woman's house at
night and she thinks it's her husband and

1892
01:54:11,761 --> 01:54:15,720
they have sex and then she finds out
it was just some guy. What? Yeah,

1893
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:19,630
every couple of years you read one of
these cases where like some guys like he

1894
01:54:19,631 --> 01:54:23,400
just walks into a house and had sex with
a woman and she's, and then she's like,

1895
01:54:23,401 --> 01:54:27,720
wait a minute, you're not my husband.
Those things seem unbelievable to me,

1896
01:54:27,721 --> 01:54:29,520
but I've seen them several times.

1897
01:54:29,970 --> 01:54:31,290
Well,
weird things can happen,

1898
01:54:31,291 --> 01:54:34,890
especially if you're in a situation
where like maybe your neighbor has been

1899
01:54:34,891 --> 01:54:38,970
thinking about fucking your wife forever
or the post man. And they're like,

1900
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:43,320
maybe they know your schedule. He
doesn't come home until nine every night.

1901
01:54:43,321 --> 01:54:45,450
He works this shift and you know,

1902
01:54:45,451 --> 01:54:49,340
and I can just get in there on Tuesdays
because that's when he's not there for

1903
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:54,060
that deck. I know twins who did that.
Really? Yeah. Oh, that seems more likely.

1904
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:59,520
But he's also a problem
with sleeping pills, man. Oh
yeah. The ambien fucking you.

1905
01:54:59,950 --> 01:55:03,810
Yeah. That's fucking very, very
dangerous. I've had a bunch of friends,

1906
01:55:03,811 --> 01:55:06,000
have some really bizarre experiences.

1907
01:55:06,001 --> 01:55:10,470
Like one of my buddies woke up in the
car driving somewhere and realize what he

1908
01:55:10,471 --> 01:55:11,304
was doing.

1909
01:55:11,370 --> 01:55:14,670
He had already gotten in the car and was
already driving and it was on some sort

1910
01:55:14,671 --> 01:55:18,330
of weird autopilot when he realized
that he was driving somewhere. Yeah,

1911
01:55:18,510 --> 01:55:22,680
that's heavy. It's very scary
because someone can do things to you,

1912
01:55:22,681 --> 01:55:26,130
I'm sure while you're under the
influence of sleeping pills and you would

1913
01:55:26,131 --> 01:55:29,430
probably just accept it or think it
was a part of your dream or you know,

1914
01:55:29,431 --> 01:55:29,941
or what.

1915
01:55:29,941 --> 01:55:34,670
But when you're taking something
that forces you into that state were,

1916
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:37,560
were monkeying with the mind,
that sort of sort of strange way.

1917
01:55:37,561 --> 01:55:41,730
And these companies that make these pills
will have you believe that it's safe

1918
01:55:41,731 --> 01:55:44,100
and easy.
It's cause you die.

1919
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:47,820
So if you don't die the
label it is safe. Look, he,

1920
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:51,810
we woke him up or he woke up in the
morning and we checked his heart rate.

1921
01:55:51,811 --> 01:55:55,590
Everything's fine. His blood
plates. And how do you feel,
Chris? I feel great. Well,

1922
01:55:55,591 --> 01:56:00,591
I had a wonderful night sleep and in the
safe it's safe but it's not necessarily

1923
01:56:01,081 --> 01:56:02,770
safe.
I mean whether it's safe,

1924
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:07,020
there's possible potential repercussions
for doing that shit and one of them is

1925
01:56:07,021 --> 01:56:09,270
that something happens to
you while you're doing it.

1926
01:56:09,330 --> 01:56:12,270
I think El Chapo was on Ambien.
You think so? That's what happened.

1927
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:13,950
Maybe aliens abducted him.

1928
01:56:14,030 --> 01:56:17,450
Look this, this is how, how fucking easy
it is to come in here and talk to you.

1929
01:56:17,451 --> 01:56:19,760
All right. I came in thinking, I
dunno what we're going to talk about.

1930
01:56:19,761 --> 01:56:20,930
We just talked a month ago.

1931
01:56:20,931 --> 01:56:24,020
I don't have anything new to talk about
so I made a couple of notes. I haven't,

1932
01:56:24,050 --> 01:56:27,730
I haven't gotten either one of them.
We always have shit to talk about it.

1933
01:56:27,830 --> 01:56:29,900
You really worried about
that? Well, I feel bad.

1934
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:32,900
I mean if it's just you and me
hanging out and Jamie, that's fine,

1935
01:56:32,901 --> 01:56:34,930
but if there are a million people
listening in there like that,

1936
01:56:35,180 --> 01:56:37,460
that asshole was just on
there a few weeks ago.

1937
01:56:37,461 --> 01:56:40,040
I don't want to hear his shit again.
Don't worry about those people.

1938
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:43,250
Can't think about that there. Those
people are really nice. Actually.

1939
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:47,780
Most of them are nice and looked at asked
majority. Yeah. I mean like, you know,

1940
01:56:47,781 --> 01:56:50,750
everyone talks about how the Internet
brings out the asshole and everybody.

1941
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:53,870
Right. But like the, the
people who, you know,

1942
01:56:53,871 --> 01:56:58,010
go to the trouble of rating my
podcast or putting comments,

1943
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:02,420
they're fucking beautiful. Like if I'm
feeling down I go read them. Like, Oh,

1944
01:57:02,421 --> 01:57:05,540
do you guys love me? It's beautiful. Well
you're giving them something for free.

1945
01:57:05,541 --> 01:57:10,410
That's awesome sometimes, but
it's a cool exchange, you know.

1946
01:57:10,710 --> 01:57:14,390
Yeah. I actually, I think I might've
mentioned the last time I was on that,

1947
01:57:14,990 --> 01:57:17,510
you know, you and Duncan
had sort of, you know,

1948
01:57:17,511 --> 01:57:20,870
when we get together and talk about
the future, I'm like the Dutch,

1949
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:24,280
what I'm going to die. But, uh,

1950
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:29,570
I read this book called future
perfect by Steven Johnson and uh,

1951
01:57:30,110 --> 01:57:34,070
I got a bunch of books that
I was going to trash, right?

1952
01:57:34,071 --> 01:57:37,760
Like there's the rational optimist by
Matt Ridley and there are a couple of

1953
01:57:37,761 --> 01:57:40,310
books that are all like, oh,
everything's great. And I was like, okay,

1954
01:57:40,311 --> 01:57:42,410
I'll respond to these arguments.
Cause,

1955
01:57:42,411 --> 01:57:45,800
obviously I'm making a different
argument so I should acknowledge them.

1956
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:49,070
So I trashed Matt Ridley,
I trash Steven Pinker,

1957
01:57:49,071 --> 01:57:52,070
I trashed from other people and
then I read this a future. Perfect.

1958
01:57:52,071 --> 01:57:56,510
And it's like fuck this guy's right. He's
right. He's makes really good arguments.

1959
01:57:56,511 --> 01:58:00,740
And they're very much along the lines of
what you were saying about the power of

1960
01:58:00,770 --> 01:58:04,640
unfiltered media that's happening,
that's unleashed by the Internet,

1961
01:58:04,970 --> 01:58:07,870
creating these emergent,
uh,

1962
01:58:08,030 --> 01:58:11,780
peer networks that never
could have existed before.

1963
01:58:11,900 --> 01:58:16,900
So good ideas can spread really quickly
and get capital really quickly if it's

1964
01:58:17,631 --> 01:58:20,570
a, you know, business sort of, or
money distribution kind of thing.

1965
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:25,190
And therefore, uh, things can change.

1966
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:26,420
Like I'm thinking,

1967
01:58:26,421 --> 01:58:30,440
I'm looking back at every civilization
that's ever existed and they fail, fail.

1968
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:33,080
They all collapsed and they
all follow the same patterns,

1969
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:37,970
but there wasn't this
sort of immediate world,

1970
01:58:38,180 --> 01:58:42,520
global mind. And now there is.
And as I said earlier, you know,

1971
01:58:42,521 --> 01:58:46,720
Homo Sapiens sapiens that harmony
that knows it knows what does it know.

1972
01:58:46,721 --> 01:58:47,800
It knows it's going to die.

1973
01:58:47,801 --> 01:58:51,880
The first thing that consciousness becomes
aware of is its own mortality. Right.

1974
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:57,190
So what I'm hoping is that when this
global mind clicks on as I think it's

1975
01:58:57,191 --> 01:58:58,120
happening right now,

1976
01:58:58,540 --> 01:59:02,560
that's when we become aware of our
mortality as a species and as a planet.

1977
01:59:02,561 --> 01:59:07,561
And maybe there's some like radical
transformative power in that and we'll all

1978
01:59:08,171 --> 01:59:10,500
end up living like Joe
Rogan in a hundred years.

1979
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:14,510
Definitely thing there's a radical
transform formative power of the instant

1980
01:59:14,511 --> 01:59:18,320
exchanging of ideas and information
because the, the good ideas,

1981
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:22,190
they get vetted out, like everybody's
ideas get discussed and bandied about.

1982
01:59:22,191 --> 01:59:26,060
And even, you know, podcasts, ideas,
like there's some ideas that people, uh,

1983
01:59:26,090 --> 01:59:30,020
you know, throw out on podcasts and
they get debated and everybody gets,

1984
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:33,020
there's so much intensity and so much,
you know,

1985
01:59:33,110 --> 01:59:37,040
discussion and debate about
who's right and who's wrong.

1986
01:59:37,041 --> 01:59:40,430
And it's because I think one
of the reasons why people
have so much of a vested

1987
01:59:40,431 --> 01:59:44,840
interest in these things is they recognize
the significance of exposing ideas

1988
01:59:44,841 --> 01:59:48,320
for what they truly are and trying to
figure out which ones are good and which

1989
01:59:48,321 --> 01:59:48,801
ones are bad.

1990
01:59:48,801 --> 01:59:53,510
And also the repercussions of living in
a world filled with bad ideas and bad

1991
01:59:53,511 --> 01:59:55,940
assumptions that we're all acting on.
And we've all,

1992
01:59:56,150 --> 02:00:01,150
whether it's racism or homophobia or the
fucking Federal Reserve or the fucking

1993
02:00:01,521 --> 02:00:03,830
two party system,
these things,

1994
02:00:03,831 --> 02:00:08,720
all these things we know by virtue of
like examining all the facts like, God,

1995
02:00:08,721 --> 02:00:10,160
this is not the best way to do this,

1996
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:11,930
but this is the system
that we're stuck with.

1997
02:00:12,110 --> 02:00:17,110
So when we're making communities and
even if they're open ended online

1998
02:00:17,211 --> 02:00:19,580
communities of people exchanging ideas,

1999
02:00:19,581 --> 02:00:23,480
there's still kind of communities like
people I talk with on Twitter are people,

2000
02:00:23,481 --> 02:00:26,300
uh, that I, I read their
Facebook posts or this is a,

2001
02:00:26,301 --> 02:00:30,050
there is a community to that because
we are exchanging information.

2002
02:00:30,051 --> 02:00:31,640
We all communicating with each other,
right?

2003
02:00:31,850 --> 02:00:34,970
And there's a community that comes
with podcasts as well. I mean,

2004
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:37,520
the people that are
listening to this right now,

2005
02:00:37,521 --> 02:00:40,040
the millions of people that will
get ahold of this conversation,

2006
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:42,200
they're a part of a community.

2007
02:00:42,410 --> 02:00:46,130
And whether or not they agree
or disagree or hate or love,

2008
02:00:46,370 --> 02:00:49,250
there's still in somehow or another,

2009
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:52,370
there's still in some way communing
with each other. We're, we're,

2010
02:00:52,490 --> 02:00:57,490
we're talking and communicating and
everybody has this ability now to exchange

2011
02:00:57,981 --> 02:01:02,930
ideas and the good ones sort of resonate.
And because of that,

2012
02:01:03,140 --> 02:01:07,180
I think we can exchange
ideas and evolve ideas and,

2013
02:01:07,181 --> 02:01:11,390
and evolve our own perceptions
of things in a much, much,

2014
02:01:11,391 --> 02:01:15,440
much quicker way than ever before and
ever in the history of the human race.

2015
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:17,510
Quick.
One of the reasons why I'm so optimistic.

2016
02:01:17,610 --> 02:01:19,980
Yeah. And I agree with you and
that's what this book really,

2017
02:01:19,981 --> 02:01:22,770
he really gets into that and
examples of it, what's it called?

2018
02:01:22,780 --> 02:01:26,010
It's called future perfect.
And the author is Steven Johnson.

2019
02:01:26,670 --> 02:01:30,720
And like he talks about
Kickstarter and how, you know,

2020
02:01:30,721 --> 02:01:33,420
Kickstarter two years
after it was launched,

2021
02:01:33,421 --> 02:01:38,280
it was already funding more art than
the National Endowment for the arts.

2022
02:01:38,610 --> 02:01:43,190
Wow. You know, in two years.
And uh, I mean, I, you know,

2023
02:01:43,191 --> 02:01:46,640
you're talking about how things
resonate and, and they happen quicker.

2024
02:01:46,670 --> 02:01:51,670
And I think another aspect
of it is that until now,

2025
02:01:51,831 --> 02:01:55,850
the ideas that became powerful
had to have market appeal.

2026
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:58,490
You had to be able to make
money from it somehow.

2027
02:01:58,790 --> 02:02:01,720
Whereas now like here you are
here, we push this button, this,

2028
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:04,820
I mean it costs nothing to produce
these things, these podcasts, right?

2029
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,270
They go out. If the idea is good,
a million people hear about it,

2030
02:02:08,271 --> 02:02:12,200
that resonates further.
It doesn't matter if it's a sellable idea,

2031
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:15,440
it just matters if it's a good idea.
Whereas before,

2032
02:02:15,441 --> 02:02:18,860
when all the media was controlled by
companies that needed to be making money

2033
02:02:18,861 --> 02:02:23,390
somehow, right? It had to
have that commercial appeal.

2034
02:02:23,850 --> 02:02:24,060
A lot

2035
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:27,240
of times people wouldn't even venture
into something like this unless they

2036
02:02:27,241 --> 02:02:30,030
thought that it was profitable.
Right. You know, when I got into this,

2037
02:02:30,031 --> 02:02:31,830
I did it entirely just for fun.

2038
02:02:31,860 --> 02:02:34,800
I think it's one of the reasons why
it's been successful is that I had no,

2039
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:39,060
no ulterior motive at all.
Like it was just fun.

2040
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:43,320
I just saw a lot of fun we'd be doing and
we started doing these a long time ago.

2041
02:02:43,770 --> 02:02:44,740
Um,
uh,

2042
02:02:44,741 --> 02:02:49,741
a platform called Justin TV we were doing
from the group member who would stream

2043
02:02:50,761 --> 02:02:53,580
from a laptop card.
I used to have this,

2044
02:02:53,581 --> 02:02:55,770
a Verizon card is ticking my laptop,

2045
02:02:56,040 --> 02:03:01,040
which stream from green rooms in between
shows and it would just be us fucking

2046
02:03:01,141 --> 02:03:04,830
around and talking to the camera and
maybe we'd add answered questions or

2047
02:03:04,831 --> 02:03:09,420
something like that. If there was a chat
and there was never a thought like, hey,

2048
02:03:09,421 --> 02:03:11,820
this is going to be
really profitable someday.

2049
02:03:11,940 --> 02:03:16,560
So let's make sure that our guests are
only like really acceptable mainstream

2050
02:03:16,561 --> 02:03:20,220
guests that we know we're going to get a
lot of attention and sometimes I'll get

2051
02:03:20,221 --> 02:03:21,270
complaints about that.

2052
02:03:21,271 --> 02:03:26,250
Like how come you keep having your friends
or some hunter dude or some comedian

2053
02:03:26,251 --> 02:03:27,600
or a fighter that I don't know.

2054
02:03:27,750 --> 02:03:32,370
How come you can't run and how come you
can't get Obama black? Marion got Obama,

2055
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:33,493
you know,
how can you,

2056
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:36,630
how come you don't get Steven Spielberg
won't look fat fucking I'm not even

2057
02:03:36,631 --> 02:03:39,480
trying. How about that? I just
want to have conversations.

2058
02:03:39,690 --> 02:03:42,330
If I really wanted to have
a conversation with Obama,

2059
02:03:42,690 --> 02:03:46,290
I don't know even know if it is possible
because I think if the fucking secret

2060
02:03:46,291 --> 02:03:49,070
service, listen to any of the shit that
I've said before, they'd probably, yeah,

2061
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:53,190
I'd probably be removed from
the discussion. But I mean,

2062
02:03:53,191 --> 02:03:58,191
I feel like there's some people that I
probably could talk to that I'm not drawn

2063
02:03:59,101 --> 02:04:03,060
to that I'm not drawn to them.
I'm not, I'm not interested in it,

2064
02:04:03,061 --> 02:04:05,520
but if I am interested in them,
I'll pursue them.

2065
02:04:05,521 --> 02:04:07,950
Like there's some famous
people that I find fascinating.

2066
02:04:08,130 --> 02:04:11,240
I would love to talk to them. Verna
Hertz, thug dude. Yeah, I would,

2067
02:04:11,490 --> 02:04:14,550
but not just because they're famous.
No, but if you have a talk show,

2068
02:04:14,551 --> 02:04:17,190
like if you have the tonight show
or something along those lines,

2069
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:21,560
you can't do a show like that unless
you have famous people on that.

2070
02:04:21,670 --> 02:04:24,840
That's the whole model. Right?
That's, that's the only way to do it.

2071
02:04:24,870 --> 02:04:27,600
And it's someone pitching something.
Right, exactly. It's going to be,

2072
02:04:27,601 --> 02:04:29,220
don't get to choose.
That's the other problem.

2073
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:33,000
If you're the host of one of those shows
and you're a part of some multimedia

2074
02:04:33,001 --> 02:04:36,090
conglomerate like NBC or universal
or whatever the fuck it is,

2075
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:40,320
they're going to bring all these
people, this is Mike, blah blah blah.

2076
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:43,740
He's got this fucking fast and
furious 47 coming out and you know,

2077
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:44,940
and you've got to have that guy.

2078
02:04:44,941 --> 02:04:48,930
What was it like on the set working with
Michelle Rodriguez? Oh man, she's crazy.

2079
02:04:48,931 --> 02:04:51,420
First of all, we're just like a
tight knit family. We would go in.

2080
02:04:51,421 --> 02:04:55,650
This film is amazing and I got a real
big thanks out to Steven Spielberg for

2081
02:04:55,651 --> 02:04:59,250
produce all that bullshit. It's this
through. It was great. It's nonsense,

2082
02:04:59,251 --> 02:05:01,530
it's nonsense and that's all
you're ever going to get.

2083
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:04,200
And these little seven minute
sound bites in between commercials.

2084
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:06,410
You do the seven minutes,
we'll be right back. All right.

2085
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:10,390
And then you go to commercial
and then fucking tie. Toyota Woo.

2086
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:13,890
Bababa Abilify or do you feel depressed?
And then next thing you know, Bam,

2087
02:05:14,310 --> 02:05:17,190
new guest and their new top 40 song.

2088
02:05:17,191 --> 02:05:21,990
I love apples and the fucking sing
their stupid song and then a, all right,

2089
02:05:21,991 --> 02:05:26,460
thanks for coming. We'll be back next week
with Tom Cruise. We got Oprah Winfrey,

2090
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,460
you know,
it's like the flaws,

2091
02:05:29,610 --> 02:05:32,430
the flaws signs Kim Kardashian

2092
02:05:34,050 --> 02:05:39,050
and you know you're going to watch
these famous heads say non thing,

2093
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:42,060
say nonsense.
And that's all those shows are.

2094
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:45,010
And that's one of the reasons why those
shows are they're they, they, they,

2095
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:46,590
they're an old,
it's an old model.

2096
02:05:46,620 --> 02:05:49,200
And I think that model is not
going to work in this new world,

2097
02:05:49,350 --> 02:05:53,700
this new world of computers
and the Internet and phones
and this new world wants

2098
02:05:53,940 --> 02:05:56,390
real information.
They want to know who the fuck are you.

2099
02:05:56,570 --> 02:06:00,180
You don't like you or don't like you.
You're you.

2100
02:06:00,450 --> 02:06:03,570
And Chris Ryan is Chris Ryan. Every
time I've seen you talk, you're you.

2101
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:05,700
And that's what people like
and that's what resonates.

2102
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:08,790
They know whether or not they agree
with you or disagree with you.

2103
02:06:08,791 --> 02:06:11,790
They know where you're coming from
as a place of honest consideration.

2104
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,520
And I tried to do that as well.
Everything I tried to do, I try,

2105
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:15,920
whether I'm right or I'm wrong,

2106
02:06:15,980 --> 02:06:19,620
if I get it wrong or I'm
clunky or I'm coming,

2107
02:06:19,621 --> 02:06:22,800
I'm not trying to be anything
other than who I am. You know?

2108
02:06:22,801 --> 02:06:26,400
And I think we're all in this together
and we're all learning and evolving and

2109
02:06:26,401 --> 02:06:28,920
growing and expanding our ideas together.

2110
02:06:29,250 --> 02:06:32,370
And I think one of the beautiful things
about podcasts is that you get to share

2111
02:06:32,371 --> 02:06:34,750
this with other people.
And there's a lot of people right now,

2112
02:06:34,751 --> 02:06:37,770
and it might be listening to this and a
truck on the way to somewhere and they

2113
02:06:37,771 --> 02:06:41,090
got fucking three hours to go and there
and they're thinking about shedding.

2114
02:06:41,100 --> 02:06:45,510
It's enriching their ideas and their
expanding their own ideas because of it.

2115
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:48,090
And maybe they're adding something
in their head. They're thinking,

2116
02:06:48,091 --> 02:06:50,730
you know why these guys are right, but
you know what else? What about this?

2117
02:06:50,820 --> 02:06:52,410
And then they have their
own idea from that.

2118
02:06:52,411 --> 02:06:55,920
And maybe that could become a fucking
business opportunity for them or a book

2119
02:06:55,921 --> 02:06:58,470
that they write or they
start their own podcast.

2120
02:06:58,590 --> 02:07:03,510
I've gotten fucking hundreds and hundreds
of messages from people that said they

2121
02:07:03,511 --> 02:07:07,830
started their own podcasts from listening
to this and that alone, who knows,

2122
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:13,100
you could nail some fucking podcast and
that podcast might be the best thing

2123
02:07:13,891 --> 02:07:17,370
that anybody's ever heard before and
it might all come out of you hearing

2124
02:07:17,371 --> 02:07:21,210
tangentially speaking or the Duncan
Trussell family hour or whatever.

2125
02:07:21,211 --> 02:07:25,650
And I think in that sense,
like everybody has a voice now,

2126
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:30,570
you know, in some really unique
way that never existed before.

2127
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:33,570
And what you were saying about like the
guy in the truck as you were saying that,

2128
02:07:33,571 --> 02:07:35,890
I was thinking one of
the things that I really,

2129
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:39,800
yeah, we were earlier talking about a
radio lab and I, I said I was Sorta,

2130
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:42,100
I found it sort of annoying
how produced it is.

2131
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:45,830
I think one of the things that's cool
about your show, my show Dunkin show,

2132
02:07:45,831 --> 02:07:49,780
these conversational shows that
aren't highly produced and edited,

2133
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:53,080
is that that guy in the truck,
he's listening to us,

2134
02:07:53,081 --> 02:07:54,910
have a conversation in real time.

2135
02:07:55,270 --> 02:07:58,450
So it's really easy for him to
imagine himself participating.

2136
02:07:59,230 --> 02:08:02,230
Whereas if you're listening to something
where everything's cut in real tight

2137
02:08:02,231 --> 02:08:04,030
and you know controlled,

2138
02:08:04,060 --> 02:08:08,110
you can't insert yourself into that
world because that's not a real world.

2139
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:13,050
Maybe that's why I like radio lab is
cause I'm so used to this and I do this so

2140
02:08:13,051 --> 02:08:14,430
often.
I'm doing this three times,

2141
02:08:14,431 --> 02:08:19,170
sometimes four times even we've done five
a week on some weeks that when I go to

2142
02:08:19,171 --> 02:08:20,310
something like radio lab,

2143
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:24,330
I could just sit down and absorb the
information and also because I think it's

2144
02:08:24,331 --> 02:08:28,230
so good. It's great. There's so
much matters. It's incredible.

2145
02:08:28,590 --> 02:08:31,290
But I could see your point. Like
sometimes it annoys me when they edit,

2146
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:34,170
like someone's in the middle of
talking and then they'll explain in a

2147
02:08:34,171 --> 02:08:36,600
paraphrased way what that
guy actually wound up saying.

2148
02:08:36,601 --> 02:08:39,240
Well how about you let him say it?
Right? Like why did you have to chime in?

2149
02:08:39,241 --> 02:08:43,110
And we missing 10 15
seconds of his explanation.

2150
02:08:43,111 --> 02:08:46,080
Is it too verbose? Like
why, why you got to cut in?

2151
02:08:46,380 --> 02:08:48,600
But they're doing it because
they kind of liked doing that.

2152
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:51,870
They like being clever with the
sound. That's their art. I mean,

2153
02:08:51,871 --> 02:08:53,850
they're creating this thing like my,

2154
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:57,600
one of my all time favorites is Dan
Carlin's hardcore history. It's amazing.

2155
02:08:58,100 --> 02:09:02,100
We've heard the newest one. Oh
good Lord. It might be best Africa.

2156
02:09:02,101 --> 02:09:06,660
We just out what, what's the doubt
about the Assyrians? All my God.

2157
02:09:06,750 --> 02:09:11,010
Oh my God. It's good. He's great. Oh,
he's the best. You had them on your, yes.

2158
02:09:11,070 --> 02:09:14,250
I love that guy.
He's a fucking national treasure.

2159
02:09:14,640 --> 02:09:19,230
He makes people think about history and
in a way it's exciting and it's, it's,

2160
02:09:19,231 --> 02:09:21,720
it's a, you could digest it, you know?

2161
02:09:21,830 --> 02:09:23,420
Yeah. I was, I was, uh,

2162
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:26,000
taking a walk the other day and I
was listening to one of his, um,

2163
02:09:26,030 --> 02:09:26,900
the series about world

2164
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:31,580
war one and yeah, it's amazing.
Something of doom. Yeah.

2165
02:09:31,610 --> 02:09:36,380
Um, no. Uh, that prophets of doom I think
was the one about, um, here, I'll pull it.

2166
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:40,910
It's like a seven, seven part series.
Each one's two or three hours long.

2167
02:09:41,450 --> 02:09:44,090
But it has always, I was
listening, I was thinking how,

2168
02:09:44,630 --> 02:09:47,570
cause I used to think history was boring,
right when I was in high school.

2169
02:09:47,770 --> 02:09:51,720
It was like, yeah, fucking history class
for Armageddon. That's what, that's it.

2170
02:09:51,721 --> 02:09:55,700
Yeah. All about world war one.
Oh my God. Incredible Shit.

2171
02:09:55,730 --> 02:10:00,350
And like the way he tells the story and
the details of the research is like,

2172
02:10:00,380 --> 02:10:05,380
this is the most interesting shit I can
imagine listening to and history was

2173
02:10:06,261 --> 02:10:09,200
boring. Like how hard you have to
work to make this boring. Well,

2174
02:10:09,201 --> 02:10:11,000
I think there's a difference between has,

2175
02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:14,030
I mean it's one of the reasons why he
makes the distinction that he's not a

2176
02:10:14,031 --> 02:10:17,810
historian. You know, he's like,
and although I do consider him one,

2177
02:10:17,811 --> 02:10:20,300
he won't consider himself
one because he's so humble.

2178
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:24,410
But what he's doing is he's adding this,

2179
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:29,500
the dramatic flare of a professional
broadcaster and then really excellent one

2180
02:10:30,140 --> 02:10:33,680
and that really excellent,
um, uh, entertainer

2181
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:37,460
and he's, he's distributing how
to use this voice. Well, yeah,

2182
02:10:37,461 --> 02:10:41,060
he's so good dramatically with his
paws and winning quotes, you know,

2183
02:10:41,061 --> 02:10:45,350
he changes his voice fucking good. The
new one's even better than the other ones.

2184
02:10:45,351 --> 02:10:49,790
I think he's getting better as that
sounds and Danieli Bolelli now it's in the

2185
02:10:49,791 --> 02:10:52,380
ring. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. He was just

2186
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:55,610
fucking love that guy.

2187
02:10:55,611 --> 02:10:59,360
And his new podcast is really excellent
to the beginning of the first one.

2188
02:10:59,361 --> 02:11:01,820
It's just like self,
it's about a story.

2189
02:11:01,850 --> 02:11:06,080
And that he had actually told me on
the podcast and I remember saying,

2190
02:11:06,110 --> 02:11:10,730
what the hell? Yeah, I do. I explain
it to anybody cause I don't want to,

2191
02:11:10,731 --> 02:11:14,360
I don't want to blow any of the suspense
and the craziness of the first story,

2192
02:11:14,361 --> 02:11:17,720
but not zero, zero, which is a
kind of, when he's explaining it,

2193
02:11:17,721 --> 02:11:19,530
but episode one block,

2194
02:11:19,620 --> 02:11:24,380
that story's so twisted when you find
out what people were capable of doing to

2195
02:11:24,381 --> 02:11:28,200
each other. Just a few hundred
a thousand, 2000 years ago.

2196
02:11:28,250 --> 02:11:30,790
Right now we're blowing up
people in Yemen. I mean,

2197
02:11:30,950 --> 02:11:35,000
and they say only 10% of the people who
get blown up are the ones we're aiming

2198
02:11:35,001 --> 02:11:38,720
at. 90% are innocent
bystanders. Yeah, yeah.

2199
02:11:38,721 --> 02:11:43,721
Well I mean this drones in this book I'm
almost finished with now the argument

2200
02:11:43,941 --> 02:11:47,810
is that civilization is sick,

2201
02:11:48,770 --> 02:11:52,910
right? Civilization itself
is a sick system. Um,

2202
02:11:53,210 --> 02:11:57,170
partly because it's built
on the repression of natural
urges and then you know,

2203
02:11:57,171 --> 02:11:58,490
all this distortion and all that.

2204
02:11:58,790 --> 02:12:02,330
So when you look at like all these stories
that people are talking about their

2205
02:12:02,331 --> 02:12:05,300
world war one, we don't even know what
they're fighting about, right. You know,

2206
02:12:05,301 --> 02:12:08,630
and the poison in each other and they're
blowing shit up and they're destroying

2207
02:12:08,631 --> 02:12:13,500
the landscape and it's dropping tons
of munitions and all this shit. And uh,

2208
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:18,230
or Columbus, when Columbus landed,
you know, he'd fucking, you know,

2209
02:12:18,231 --> 02:12:22,880
the letter he wrote back to the queen
when he first landed and he spend Yola was

2210
02:12:22,881 --> 02:12:26,030
like, these people are so
beautiful and they're so generous.

2211
02:12:26,030 --> 02:12:28,910
If you express admiration for anything,
they just give it to you.

2212
02:12:28,911 --> 02:12:32,630
And there's food everywhere
and fish everywhere and
fruit and they're beautiful.

2213
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:35,120
The swim and they're half
naked and they're lovely,

2214
02:12:35,121 --> 02:12:39,800
lovely people with 50 soldiers,
we can enslave the entire population.

2215
02:12:40,370 --> 02:12:44,690
It's like, Oh, who civilized here? You
know, the guy who's like, fuck you.

2216
02:12:44,691 --> 02:12:47,570
And he's cutting off people's hands cause
they're not bringing them enough gold

2217
02:12:47,830 --> 02:12:48,740
and there is no goal.

2218
02:12:48,890 --> 02:12:52,160
And then they're sending the dogs on
them and watching them rip their guts out

2219
02:12:52,161 --> 02:12:56,690
and slam and babies against
trees were the civilized ones.

2220
02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:01,880
Then it was all break explained in really
great detail by some religious person

2221
02:13:02,601 --> 02:13:04,010
that was involved with that.
Right.

2222
02:13:06,470 --> 02:13:10,910
What was his position? What would,
he was a Jesuit and he wrote, um,

2223
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:16,100
the conquest, the conquest
of new Spain was, uh,

2224
02:13:16,130 --> 02:13:19,470
Diaz. That's a really interesting
book that's about, uh,

2225
02:13:19,560 --> 02:13:23,920
the Aztec thing where they went
and took over Montezuma. But, uh,

2226
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:29,020
de Las Casas was a Jesuit who
saw this happening and um,

2227
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:32,640
the wrote all these treaties,
treaties is,

2228
02:13:32,670 --> 02:13:37,280
or essays decrying the treatment
of the natives and he's, he,

2229
02:13:37,310 --> 02:13:38,760
his point was like,

2230
02:13:38,761 --> 02:13:41,400
they're human beings and we're not
treating them like human beings.

2231
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:45,680
And then supple Veda argued they're not
human beings, they don't have souls.

2232
02:13:45,681 --> 02:13:47,160
So we're free to do what we want.

2233
02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:52,370
And they had this famous debate at the
Vatican between those two perspective.

2234
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:55,260
Like are they human or not?
Are they, you know, do,

2235
02:13:55,261 --> 02:14:00,261
are we justified in treating them like
animals and a de Las Casas one but didn't

2236
02:14:01,201 --> 02:14:04,560
matter. You know, my question is it's
pretty much universally accepted.

2237
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:08,790
The Columbus was a con. Yeah. And
that he was a horrible evil person.

2238
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:12,120
But how did it take us until
2015 before we recognize that?

2239
02:14:12,330 --> 02:14:16,170
How the fuck did that guy get a Monday?
Well, how did he get a day off? The same,

2240
02:14:16,171 --> 02:14:17,460
same reason.
The fucking,

2241
02:14:17,461 --> 02:14:21,150
those heads are carved into the
black hills in South Dakota, right?

2242
02:14:21,450 --> 02:14:26,250
It's like it was what we were saying
earlier, assist them once as if,

2243
02:14:26,251 --> 02:14:31,251
as if it's a living thing is system
adopts the subsystems that perpetuated a,

2244
02:14:32,070 --> 02:14:36,430
so that's a good way of describing
it. You know, you're an expensive, uh,

2245
02:14:36,510 --> 02:14:40,650
empire system. So you celebrate
those who expanded the empire.

2246
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:43,020
It doesn't matter if they
were cons, right? Right.

2247
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:48,200
Because what they did is something
that serve the interest of the system.

2248
02:14:49,050 --> 02:14:53,100
And so when I'm trying to get at in this
book is that what serves the interest

2249
02:14:53,101 --> 02:14:57,810
of the system is not what serves the
interest of the individuals within the

2250
02:14:57,811 --> 02:15:02,280
system. So the fact that,
you know, people often say,

2251
02:15:02,281 --> 02:15:05,940
well obviously the human race
is amazing because you know,

2252
02:15:05,941 --> 02:15:07,380
so successful because look,

2253
02:15:07,381 --> 02:15:11,690
there's 7 billion of us now and there
were only a hundred million 500 years ago,

2254
02:15:11,700 --> 02:15:14,910
whatever it is. And my argument
is like, well wait a minute.

2255
02:15:14,970 --> 02:15:19,970
Like they're way more prisoners in
America now than there were 50 years ago.

2256
02:15:20,131 --> 02:15:22,530
Does that mean prisoners are thriving?
You know,

2257
02:15:22,531 --> 02:15:25,620
the fact that there are more of a
given species doesn't mean that that

2258
02:15:26,130 --> 02:15:30,170
individuals within that species are living
better than premium. Not at all. It's,

2259
02:15:30,171 --> 02:15:32,070
it's also the same sort
of logic that would say,

2260
02:15:32,250 --> 02:15:36,450
well obviously being a king and being
royal is special and these are special

2261
02:15:36,451 --> 02:15:39,960
people. That's why they have power
over all these other people. Like, no,

2262
02:15:39,980 --> 02:15:42,420
these are the people just don't have
any power. Right. There's only you,

2263
02:15:42,421 --> 02:15:44,150
you're the king.
Like they,

2264
02:15:44,210 --> 02:15:48,060
that's a stupid way of looking at it and
the system gives you that power and you

2265
02:15:48,061 --> 02:15:51,030
just happened to have been plugged
into that spot. Yeah. Yeah.

2266
02:15:51,031 --> 02:15:53,790
And the idea that this is the
only way to do things well,

2267
02:15:53,791 --> 02:15:56,010
this is because we are
the best of version.

2268
02:15:56,011 --> 02:16:00,000
Like if you want to look at America as
far as like productivity and innovation,

2269
02:16:00,001 --> 02:16:03,270
and we're the best version right
now currently on this planet.

2270
02:16:03,271 --> 02:16:05,460
But that doesn't mean this
is the best way to do it.

2271
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:08,910
And it doesn't mean that if we found a
planet somewhere that was filled with

2272
02:16:08,911 --> 02:16:12,840
human beings that spoke a language
that we could all understand,

2273
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:18,030
but they just lived fucking way more
harmonious than us. They had no garbage.

2274
02:16:18,180 --> 02:16:21,180
Everything was completely recycled.
There was never any waste.

2275
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:24,030
They kept a very strict, uh, uh,

2276
02:16:24,031 --> 02:16:28,470
understanding of their environment and
what they were doing to it and how many

2277
02:16:28,471 --> 02:16:30,340
babies they had and how they treated

2278
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:33,280
each other.
And they never allowed property to exist.

2279
02:16:33,400 --> 02:16:37,480
They never allowed extreme depression
or any things that we have that we just

2280
02:16:37,930 --> 02:16:42,820
push aside or throw pills at, are
fucking put fences up for. We would go,

2281
02:16:42,821 --> 02:16:45,430
oh my God were retarded.
Why didn't we live like this?

2282
02:16:45,431 --> 02:16:49,180
And we could live like this and small
sustainable groups like these tribes that

2283
02:16:49,181 --> 02:16:50,050
we were talking about,
right?

2284
02:16:50,530 --> 02:16:54,010
We're talking about the way they would
take care of the village and then

2285
02:16:54,011 --> 02:16:57,190
everybody would take care of each other
and they'd live in these harmonious

2286
02:16:57,191 --> 02:16:59,710
communities. And it's not
saying they don't have disputes.

2287
02:16:59,711 --> 02:17:02,560
It's not saying they don't disagree
about things because all people are

2288
02:17:02,561 --> 02:17:06,070
constantly debating about ideas and they
all have their own unique and different

2289
02:17:06,071 --> 02:17:09,760
perspectives.
But when we get to this gigantic group,

2290
02:17:09,761 --> 02:17:13,390
whether it's a 300 million in
America or 7 billion worldwide,

2291
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:18,720
there's this massive diffusion
of responsibility for the
residual effects of our

2292
02:17:18,731 --> 02:17:19,570
civilization.

2293
02:17:19,570 --> 02:17:24,010
It's cigarettes out the window and fucking
poop in the ocean or whatever it is.

2294
02:17:24,310 --> 02:17:27,100
Like we somehow under the don't
feel responsible for all that.

2295
02:17:27,101 --> 02:17:29,050
Although ultimately it comes from humans.

2296
02:17:29,290 --> 02:17:31,510
If we found some group
that had figured that out,

2297
02:17:31,990 --> 02:17:34,780
we found some planet that was filled with
people that didn't have anything that

2298
02:17:34,781 --> 02:17:37,330
we don't have. They had
computers, they had cars,

2299
02:17:37,331 --> 02:17:40,610
but they had figured all this other shit
out and they had just, they just say,

2300
02:17:40,611 --> 02:17:42,670
well, this is more important than
anything else we're doing. Let's,

2301
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:44,890
let's engineer this first.
Let's figure this out.

2302
02:17:44,891 --> 02:17:49,090
First we would realize that we're
living like apes with phones and guns.

2303
02:17:49,300 --> 02:17:50,570
That's where it,
yeah,

2304
02:17:50,740 --> 02:17:55,700
like I had this joke in part of the
joke was about like if we went to, uh,

2305
02:17:55,910 --> 02:17:59,960
to the zoo or went to the Congo, we
found some rare spot in the Congo and we,

2306
02:18:00,010 --> 02:18:04,180
we ran into these chimps and they had
figured out cell phones and rocket

2307
02:18:04,181 --> 02:18:04,720
launchers,

2308
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:07,240
but all they were doing is taking
pictures of their dicks and shooting each

2309
02:18:07,241 --> 02:18:10,630
other in the face would be like,
what? That's us are you guys do it?

2310
02:18:10,631 --> 02:18:14,550
But that is us. That is us. That is what
we're doing. It's true. I mean, we're not,

2311
02:18:14,580 --> 02:18:14,741
it's,

2312
02:18:14,741 --> 02:18:17,680
we're not only taking pictures of our
dicks and knowing only shooting each other

2313
02:18:17,681 --> 02:18:19,600
in the face,
but for doing a lot of it,

2314
02:18:19,830 --> 02:18:22,390
there's a lot of Dick pics and there's a
lot of people getting shot in the face.

2315
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:25,750
And a lot of it is die.
Robots that are flying around the sky,

2316
02:18:25,900 --> 02:18:28,000
killing 90% of the wrong people.

2317
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:32,870
Well, sex and, and military are
the two main drivers of economics,

2318
02:18:33,090 --> 02:18:37,320
right? I mean, yeah. The
W is Eo Wilson said, uh,

2319
02:18:37,321 --> 02:18:41,300
he's great biologist.
He said humans are, uh,

2320
02:18:41,350 --> 02:18:44,910
the tragedy of humanity is that
we have stone-age instincts,

2321
02:18:44,940 --> 02:18:49,650
medieval institutions and god,
like powers technology.

2322
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:54,540
That's a beautiful way describing it.
Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's a mess.

2323
02:18:54,930 --> 02:18:56,990
Yeah. I mean what you described
like, oh, we go to this,

2324
02:18:56,991 --> 02:18:58,680
this planet and find these people.

2325
02:18:58,681 --> 02:19:03,681
And then that's very similar to the
story that is told over and over and over

2326
02:19:05,281 --> 02:19:10,140
again at first contact between
civilized people and native people.

2327
02:19:10,380 --> 02:19:12,630
Now when I say native people,
keep in mind,

2328
02:19:12,990 --> 02:19:16,990
I look at the Aztecs or the Inca
as they're civilized, right? It's,

2329
02:19:16,991 --> 02:19:21,820
it's not European, but they're living in
hierarchical, large scale civilizations.

2330
02:19:22,290 --> 02:19:25,970
Agricultural civilization, right?
Yeah. They're, they're native. Yeah.

2331
02:19:26,170 --> 02:19:29,330
Might not know about a lot of the
things of the Europeans knew about.

2332
02:19:29,331 --> 02:19:32,860
And they probably can choose that
shit out of slaves and all that shit.

2333
02:19:32,990 --> 02:19:35,720
So I'm not so, cause a lot of times
people will be like, Oh man, you know,

2334
02:19:35,721 --> 02:19:37,580
the fucking hystrix ripped their hearts.
I'm not,

2335
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:40,350
the Aztecs are the same as the Spaniards,
right.

2336
02:19:40,670 --> 02:19:45,590
I'm talking about Nate low scale a hunter
gatherer bands where everybody knows

2337
02:19:45,591 --> 02:19:47,570
each other, right. And nomadic, right.

2338
02:19:47,750 --> 02:19:51,880
Which in is tribal people oftentimes it
live in jungles and things along those

2339
02:19:51,890 --> 02:19:55,910
lines. There's a lot of resources
and there's no fight for resource.

2340
02:19:56,780 --> 02:20:01,640
Yeah. Because the population is standing
is, and it's steady. Right, right.

2341
02:20:02,170 --> 02:20:04,700
Um, you know, there are all
sorts of reasons for that,

2342
02:20:04,701 --> 02:20:08,840
but that's the story you get. Again and
again in this book, I quote this, um,

2343
02:20:08,900 --> 02:20:13,100
this Jesuit who lived with a Munton
Yay Indians in what's now Quebec.

2344
02:20:13,460 --> 02:20:15,350
And he says like,
you know,

2345
02:20:15,410 --> 02:20:19,280
they really enjoy life and
they're not worried about dying.

2346
02:20:19,281 --> 02:20:23,480
They're not worried about being hungry
because they save the world provides for

2347
02:20:23,481 --> 02:20:26,510
them. They look around,
they're like, yeah, there's
food everywhere. And he says,

2348
02:20:26,511 --> 02:20:30,380
like, I tried to talk to them and they,
if they get a beaver, they have a feast.

2349
02:20:30,890 --> 02:20:34,550
Even if you know the, the, the
guys next door got a beaver in,

2350
02:20:34,551 --> 02:20:36,710
they're having a feast to,
and if they get three beavers,

2351
02:20:36,711 --> 02:20:39,350
they'll have three fees and it
just eat till everything's gone.

2352
02:20:39,351 --> 02:20:42,650
And when I say to them like, why don't
you save something for tomorrow? They say,

2353
02:20:42,651 --> 02:20:45,530
well, we'll catch something tomorrow. And
they're like, well, what if you don't?

2354
02:20:45,560 --> 02:20:47,990
Well then we'll be hungry. Don't
worry. I mean, it's no big deal there.

2355
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,130
There's always enough.
Well,

2356
02:20:49,131 --> 02:20:52,760
they lived in a different world to
where there wasn't as massive fucking

2357
02:20:52,761 --> 02:20:56,510
quantity of human beings
that are literally pulling
everything out of the land.

2358
02:20:56,540 --> 02:20:56,811
Yeah.

2359
02:20:56,811 --> 02:21:01,811
So you need that huge population
to support the scarcity mindset.

2360
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:03,351
Well,

2361
02:21:03,351 --> 02:21:08,351
here's one good example of information
being distributed and how it's benefiting

2362
02:21:08,510 --> 02:21:11,780
even the environment here in North
America at the turn of the century,

2363
02:21:11,781 --> 02:21:16,781
there was a point in time where we had
wiped out like a giant majority of the

2364
02:21:18,471 --> 02:21:22,610
game animals on this planet because just
like they did with the buffalo and they

2365
02:21:22,611 --> 02:21:27,170
just fucking slaughtered the buffalo
and buffalo bill is a national hero.

2366
02:21:28,070 --> 02:21:31,580
All right. You're talking about
Columbus. Sure. Full of fucking bill.

2367
02:21:31,581 --> 02:21:35,420
That's what he's famous for. Shot
him and left them there to rot. Yeah.

2368
02:21:35,421 --> 02:21:39,200
What'd they do? They took
the hides, right? That's all
they, that's all they talk.

2369
02:21:39,260 --> 02:21:43,460
And mostly it was just to starve the
Indians. The hides were like, yeah,

2370
02:21:43,461 --> 02:21:44,600
that's why they did it.
Because they were,

2371
02:21:44,630 --> 02:21:47,450
that's when they were building the
railroads across the great plains.

2372
02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:51,620
Indians kept kicking their ass and
so they're like, well, you know,

2373
02:21:51,621 --> 02:21:55,580
they're kicking our ass so let's starve
them out. Take away their food source.

2374
02:21:55,581 --> 02:21:59,510
Yeah. You know, it's also interesting,
we haven't reintroduced the Buffalo,

2375
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:03,950
like the buffalo is the one animal that
if you look at like they've reintroduced

2376
02:22:03,951 --> 02:22:05,150
wolves.
All right.

2377
02:22:05,151 --> 02:22:09,710
And to a great many people's
dismay because they're
starting to attack livestock.

2378
02:22:09,950 --> 02:22:13,550
But that livestock in and of itself
is one of the reasons why they haven't

2379
02:22:13,551 --> 02:22:14,790
reintroduce buffalo.
Right?

2380
02:22:14,810 --> 02:22:17,230
Because people are scared because
if they bring buffalo back,

2381
02:22:17,450 --> 02:22:21,980
buffalo are beautiful, majestic creatures,
but say goodbye it all your hey bitch.

2382
02:22:23,150 --> 02:22:26,040
Well, buffaloes use much
less water. Cows do. Oh

2383
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:28,440
yeah, they're much better
environmental. Well they can. I mean,

2384
02:22:28,441 --> 02:22:32,570
they're fucking hardy. Hardy are. And
they can withstand really cold. Oh yeah.

2385
02:22:32,600 --> 02:22:37,590
Will they have blankets? They're
built in blankets, but they eat a lot.

2386
02:22:37,660 --> 02:22:42,480
Have you seen one like in la? All
in? Only in like a fenced in area.

2387
02:22:43,150 --> 02:22:47,880
It's like a Mousse. It's like wow,
that's so big. Yeah. Yeah. Bigger. Even.

2388
02:22:47,960 --> 02:22:48,751
Well not only that,

2389
02:22:48,751 --> 02:22:53,751
they look like prehistoric wooly and
Florian is a crazy thing called the muskox

2390
02:22:55,290 --> 02:22:59,370
Tibet. Well they have them in um, um, uh,

2391
02:22:59,470 --> 02:23:00,720
Antarctic I believe it is.

2392
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:04,050
And they also have them in Greenland
and people go to Greenly hunting these

2393
02:23:04,051 --> 02:23:07,920
things and they apparently
tasted delicious like rib eyes.

2394
02:23:07,921 --> 02:23:11,480
Like they're marbled cause there's
got the long hair, right? Yeah.

2395
02:23:11,790 --> 02:23:16,170
But they look like, like star wars
creatures look like a real animal,

2396
02:23:16,190 --> 02:23:20,970
this big furry thing with horns and
it's running around and the frozen snow,

2397
02:23:20,971 --> 02:23:22,530
you're like,
what the fuck is that?

2398
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:28,040
But these animals can survive in places
where we couldn't imagine surviving and

2399
02:23:28,531 --> 02:23:31,980
they thrive out there.
And this frozen Tundra,

2400
02:23:32,220 --> 02:23:34,140
these big gigantic,
you know,

2401
02:23:34,141 --> 02:23:38,970
2000 pound beast covered and far and god,

2402
02:23:38,971 --> 02:23:39,804
it's amazing.

2403
02:23:39,810 --> 02:23:44,810
But what my point was that there was a
point in time where we had driven a giant

2404
02:23:45,781 --> 02:23:48,000
majority of these animals to extinction.

2405
02:23:48,210 --> 02:23:51,660
Now because of the symbiotic relationship,

2406
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:55,830
especially like white tail deer have
with agriculture and human settlement,

2407
02:23:56,190 --> 02:23:59,790
there's more deer in America today than
they were when Columbus was here. Right.

2408
02:24:00,270 --> 02:24:02,670
Which is nuts.
And it's because of intervention.

2409
02:24:02,820 --> 02:24:06,260
It's because of management is
because like these, these, uh,

2410
02:24:06,450 --> 02:24:11,450
fishing game groups if recognize the
problems and if regulated the amount of a

2411
02:24:11,910 --> 02:24:13,020
hunting that people can do,

2412
02:24:13,021 --> 02:24:17,370
but also worked really hard to
protect habitat and preserve habitat.

2413
02:24:17,371 --> 02:24:20,220
And that's one of the things with
these national forests. In fact,

2414
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:24,840
Teddy Roosevelt was one cause he was a,
an avid outdoorsman and a hunter.

2415
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:28,960
He is the reason why we have these
national forests and national parks.

2416
02:24:29,310 --> 02:24:31,200
He and with great resistance,

2417
02:24:31,201 --> 02:24:36,030
he put that in place and he turned on
his own class. He was an interesting cat.

2418
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:41,360
His mother and his wife died on
either the same day or the same week.

2419
02:24:42,150 --> 02:24:46,980
Whoa. Yeah, he had a really bad week.
Um, it might've been the same day,

2420
02:24:47,370 --> 02:24:48,540
but he was back in New York.

2421
02:24:48,541 --> 02:24:53,541
I think he was a governor or a senator
and like his fucking life fell apart and

2422
02:24:54,151 --> 02:24:57,930
he's from this really wealthy family,
right? Obviously the Roosevelts,

2423
02:24:57,931 --> 02:25:01,550
they were already a very
wealthy family and as a way,

2424
02:25:02,010 --> 02:25:06,360
a little bit like Wim Hoff and as
a way of dealing with his grief,

2425
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:11,220
he was like, fuck it, I'm out of here.
He quit. And he went out to Montana,

2426
02:25:11,221 --> 02:25:15,690
I think, and worked on a
ranch and he was a sick kid.

2427
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:21,000
Um, which is why he sort of
like over compensated in a
way with all the macho and

2428
02:25:21,001 --> 02:25:24,220
you know, all this stuff. And he worked
on that ranch. That's where he really

2429
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:27,400
fell in love with the natural
world and you know, it became this.

2430
02:25:27,401 --> 02:25:31,120
And then he went back and became
secretary of the navy, I think, and uh,

2431
02:25:31,121 --> 02:25:33,760
fought in the Spanish
American war and you know,

2432
02:25:33,761 --> 02:25:35,620
his political career took off from there.

2433
02:25:35,710 --> 02:25:39,190
He established an independent party
wasn't like the Buffalo Party or something

2434
02:25:39,191 --> 02:25:42,840
like that. Wasn't that one of the
Times that he ran for president? Yeah.

2435
02:25:42,850 --> 02:25:47,630
It was in buffalo though, is like the
Bull Moose Moose. Right, right, right.

2436
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:50,500
Yeah, that's right. And he and John Muir,

2437
02:25:50,501 --> 02:25:52,840
we're friends who is John Muir again,

2438
02:25:52,870 --> 02:25:57,870
a great naturalist who wrote about
Yosemite and convinced a Roosevelt to make

2439
02:25:59,651 --> 02:26:03,070
Yosemite national park,
maybe the first national park.

2440
02:26:03,100 --> 02:26:06,670
Isn't it ironic that that's
probably what's going to
kill every single person on

2441
02:26:06,671 --> 02:26:07,840
this entire continent?

2442
02:26:08,050 --> 02:26:12,350
When Yosemite blows on that motherfucker
in Yellowstone, Yellowstone,

2443
02:26:12,351 --> 02:26:15,520
you choose those two for
whatever easy yellow, the y.

2444
02:26:16,590 --> 02:26:21,210
That's fucking goddamn terrifying to
me. Yeah, that's a big one. That's,

2445
02:26:21,800 --> 02:26:24,400
that's pretty cool.
There's always love that shit.

2446
02:26:24,430 --> 02:26:27,730
Did you see that storm yesterday?
Oh yeah. It was beautiful. I like,

2447
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:30,580
I like when nature just says,
fuck you.

2448
02:26:32,260 --> 02:26:35,940
You know that was barely a fuck you.
That was like, no, but first la,

2449
02:26:35,950 --> 02:26:38,280
that was whether it was like I was,

2450
02:26:38,430 --> 02:26:43,150
I was sitting up in the Soho House.
You've been up there in Hollywood? No,

2451
02:26:43,151 --> 02:26:46,150
I never have. It's pretty cool.
It's like it's the top floor of,

2452
02:26:46,151 --> 02:26:47,500
and it's up on the hill anyway.

2453
02:26:47,501 --> 02:26:50,110
So you can see all the way to the
ocean where all the rich people,

2454
02:26:50,111 --> 02:26:55,030
they become like members of this place.
And it's like a status symbol spot. Yeah.

2455
02:26:55,290 --> 02:26:59,050
Why'd you get in there?
Cause I have rich status symbol friends.

2456
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:02,770
What is it like in there?
It's cool. It's nice.

2457
02:27:02,771 --> 02:27:04,270
I mean there are no cameras allowed.

2458
02:27:04,420 --> 02:27:06,520
So like what happens if
you pull out your phone?

2459
02:27:06,970 --> 02:27:09,980
Actually what happened yesterday
when that storm system came in, I'll,

2460
02:27:09,981 --> 02:27:12,430
I'll show you a picture. You
know when we, when he finished,

2461
02:27:12,431 --> 02:27:16,570
but it was so beautiful because it was
really late and the sun was like right on

2462
02:27:16,571 --> 02:27:20,230
the horizon and these crazy clouds
came in really quickly and then it was

2463
02:27:20,231 --> 02:27:24,250
raining and the sun and there were
rainbows and like, you know the,

2464
02:27:24,550 --> 02:27:28,870
when the rays of the sun come down and
you know something's Jacob's ladder,

2465
02:27:28,871 --> 02:27:33,220
I think it's called. So everybody was like
pictures and all the waiters are like,

2466
02:27:33,221 --> 02:27:35,410
no photos, no photos. And
everyone's like, fuck you,

2467
02:27:35,740 --> 02:27:38,840
we're doing this soho rebellion.
Yeah.

2468
02:27:39,590 --> 02:27:41,540
But nobody first celebrities,

2469
02:27:41,770 --> 02:27:45,120
they do it right because they didn't want
people like surreptitiously look, look,

2470
02:27:45,130 --> 02:27:46,620
Joe Rogan talking to somebody.

2471
02:27:46,770 --> 02:27:50,950
But it's so hard when you have a phone
with a camera and everyone has a phone.

2472
02:27:51,430 --> 02:27:52,750
Everyone's phone as a camera.

2473
02:27:52,780 --> 02:27:55,900
You're not supposed to pull out the
phone in the place that you can go out on

2474
02:27:55,901 --> 02:28:00,790
the terrace where you can smoke and
whatever and talk and text or whatever.

2475
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:02,860
So they ask you when you go there,

2476
02:28:02,861 --> 02:28:04,510
please do not use your
phone while you're eating.

2477
02:28:04,550 --> 02:28:06,130
Can you taxed while you're eating?

2478
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:09,720
I don't think you're supposed to have
your phone out of your pocket in sign,

2479
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:14,320
but everybody's got a computer. They have
a computer. Yeah, everybody's working.

2480
02:28:14,350 --> 02:28:18,310
Cause it's a place where you can go
and work all day and there are tables.

2481
02:28:18,311 --> 02:28:22,020
It's like a lounge. Yeah. Yeah. You can
get some food, have a coffee, but you

2482
02:28:22,020 --> 02:28:24,950
can sit there. Is it like a restaurant
as well? I thought it was, yeah.

2483
02:28:24,951 --> 02:28:28,100
There's a rat in the,
in the back there's a restaurant area,

2484
02:28:28,250 --> 02:28:31,520
but the main thing like
there's a pool table there.

2485
02:28:32,290 --> 02:28:36,540
It's like a cool place to hang out.
But we're all the like she,

2486
02:28:36,550 --> 02:28:39,140
she people hang out.
Well honestly,

2487
02:28:39,141 --> 02:28:42,800
I mean I probably been there
five or 10 times and you know,

2488
02:28:42,801 --> 02:28:47,720
I can't remember seeing anyone that I
recognized as being famous wealthy folks.

2489
02:28:47,750 --> 02:28:51,080
I think it's,
it's people in the entertainment business.

2490
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:55,490
So there are a lot of producers and
scream screenwriters and you know,

2491
02:28:55,550 --> 02:28:59,420
and some actors will go in there,
whatever. But I think the idea,

2492
02:28:59,450 --> 02:29:04,450
it's not like my impression anyway is
that it's not about like going and being

2493
02:29:05,331 --> 02:29:09,020
seen. It's about going and not
having to deal with the shit,

2494
02:29:09,021 --> 02:29:13,070
but still being in public. So you can
be in public, people will be cool.

2495
02:29:13,071 --> 02:29:17,030
They respect your privacy, you can hang
out and work, you can have meetings there,

2496
02:29:17,031 --> 02:29:20,750
you can, you know, do your business
there, whatever. And also it's a network.

2497
02:29:20,751 --> 02:29:23,900
There's one in New York, there's one
in London. I've heard of them before,

2498
02:29:23,901 --> 02:29:25,550
but I've always thought
that they were just like,

2499
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:29,390
like Hob knobbing celebrity
spot. So since you know me, Joe,

2500
02:29:29,391 --> 02:29:34,110
I could probably talk to someone that
gets you out of want to go. This is,

2501
02:29:34,470 --> 02:29:37,790
I'm a member of the comedy store,
the only club I want to go to know.

2502
02:29:38,670 --> 02:29:43,250
There's this a weird thing about
being in that sort of a circle of like

2503
02:29:43,251 --> 02:29:45,980
privileged folks that I try
to avoid as much as possible.

2504
02:29:46,150 --> 02:29:50,330
It's a lot of people enjoy that a little
too much and it becomes like something

2505
02:29:50,331 --> 02:29:52,180
that they, uh, they, they just,

2506
02:29:52,280 --> 02:29:56,360
it's just become something a
little too precious to them. Yeah.

2507
02:29:56,361 --> 02:29:59,570
I don't get that vibe there,
but maybe I'm just not paying attention.

2508
02:29:59,571 --> 02:30:02,870
I'm only getting it third hand through
people that know people that go there,

2509
02:30:02,871 --> 02:30:06,200
that want to become a part of it and they
talk about, I'm like, what is this? What?

2510
02:30:06,470 --> 02:30:09,260
Then I realized I can't be in this
conversation. I got to get out of here.

2511
02:30:09,500 --> 02:30:11,600
I feel that way about Americans.
Actually,

2512
02:30:11,601 --> 02:30:14,570
when I'm in Spain and I hear
American accents, I'm like, yeah,

2513
02:30:14,571 --> 02:30:18,560
I'm going to go down here. Nothing
against Americans. But you know,

2514
02:30:19,070 --> 02:30:23,630
when, I mean, I don't know if I'm
resonating with what you're talking about,

2515
02:30:23,631 --> 02:30:26,360
but it's like I know that world too.
Well,

2516
02:30:26,750 --> 02:30:28,820
I'm not here to be in that world.

2517
02:30:28,821 --> 02:30:32,900
I want to be in another world was also
think that there's a certain amount of

2518
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:35,600
reaching for,
uh,

2519
02:30:35,900 --> 02:30:40,900
for things that some folks will
do when they achieve a level of,

2520
02:30:40,941 --> 02:30:43,250
uh,
financial success.

2521
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:48,530
And they still feel like empty as
they want some sort of exclusivity.

2522
02:30:48,531 --> 02:30:52,490
So they like to go to the admirals lounge,
you know what I mean?

2523
02:30:52,491 --> 02:30:55,160
At the airport. And you know
what I mean? Like this hat.

2524
02:30:55,460 --> 02:30:58,790
But the other thing to get with the
hats, but you know what I mean? Sure.

2525
02:30:59,270 --> 02:31:02,660
There's like exclusive things
that make them feel special.

2526
02:31:04,100 --> 02:31:06,590
Vip Lounge. Yeah. Yeah. God,

2527
02:31:06,591 --> 02:31:10,280
I want to get a bottle service
behind the velvet rope. Ooh.

2528
02:31:10,490 --> 02:31:14,660
Well that's when you know you've, you're,
you know, you're, you're a sucker for it.

2529
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:18,380
That's when you're hooked. People love
that velvet rope. It's right there.

2530
02:31:18,381 --> 02:31:20,010
I can't even get through it.
Look at it as a barrier.

2531
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:22,860
It's like a forced to tell you
what the guy I was with, uh,

2532
02:31:22,890 --> 02:31:27,270
he's a really good friend of mine. He's a
wonderful guy. Uh, grew up in Hollywood.

2533
02:31:27,540 --> 02:31:30,360
He's right now,
he's homeless.

2534
02:31:30,630 --> 02:31:33,690
He's given up his apartment cause
he's doing this movie about dolphins.

2535
02:31:33,691 --> 02:31:37,380
So he's down in Florida a lot of times
and then he's in Mexico and he's doing

2536
02:31:37,381 --> 02:31:41,640
all this stuff. And uh, I'm not, I hope
I haven't said enough to give him away,

2537
02:31:41,641 --> 02:31:45,720
but he's like, he's essentially, I was
giving him shit. He's a pussy vagabond.

2538
02:31:46,050 --> 02:31:49,950
He's like sleeping with different women
every night and he's using their houses.

2539
02:31:50,130 --> 02:31:54,050
Yeah, that's gross. No, they're all
friends and they, all they'll know is,

2540
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:57,820
they all know about each other, so he's
not lying to anyone, but he's like, yeah,

2541
02:31:57,830 --> 02:31:59,610
when I'm in La,
I don't really need an apartment.

2542
02:31:59,611 --> 02:32:01,350
I can stay in a hotel if I went to,

2543
02:32:01,590 --> 02:32:05,850
but it usually I'm sleeping with one of
my friends and then I go to the so house

2544
02:32:05,851 --> 02:32:09,090
and that's where I work. And it's like,
all right, that's a pretty good system,

2545
02:32:09,091 --> 02:32:10,890
you know.
And then he has his computer.

2546
02:32:10,891 --> 02:32:13,740
He works there and then he's off
to Miami to do some more filming.

2547
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:14,970
I have a buddy who's a,

2548
02:32:14,971 --> 02:32:19,971
a wealthy real estate guy and his house
is basically a hostel for really hot,

2549
02:32:20,851 --> 02:32:25,110
semi
semi homeless girls.

2550
02:32:25,170 --> 02:32:28,590
Like a Charles Manson without the
killing. No, no, no, because like,

2551
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:32,490
it's always like some new one that is
living with them and they almost always

2552
02:32:32,491 --> 02:32:34,050
have like a little dog and they're like,

2553
02:32:34,051 --> 02:32:36,390
they just get kicked out of their
apartment and no, you could stay with me.

2554
02:32:36,540 --> 02:32:39,290
And then when I'm staying with him
and it's like this battle he has to,

2555
02:32:39,300 --> 02:32:42,570
he's an older guy and he was like,
shit, it was hard for him to fuck them.

2556
02:32:42,740 --> 02:32:46,740
You know, occasionally he does get the
fuck, but sometimes I'm like, dude,

2557
02:32:46,741 --> 02:32:51,050
you got to get away from her. What are
you doing? She's fucking, but it's,

2558
02:32:51,340 --> 02:32:52,111
that's what he does.

2559
02:32:52,111 --> 02:32:56,280
He has like one after another of
these like semi homeless girls,

2560
02:32:56,460 --> 02:32:57,750
they don't have any place to go.

2561
02:32:57,751 --> 02:33:00,330
And they wind up staying with him
and they were usually really hot.

2562
02:33:00,570 --> 02:33:04,140
And that's their currency. The currency
is that they're pretty and, but you know,

2563
02:33:04,280 --> 02:33:06,920
symbiotic in a sad skirt away.
Yeah.

2564
02:33:07,220 --> 02:33:11,870
Do you ever hear a video about Father
Yod, Father Yod? Just talk about that.

2565
02:33:11,871 --> 02:33:15,860
It's called the, the,
uh, the source family.

2566
02:33:16,220 --> 02:33:19,490
He was this doot. Oh, you should watch
that. That's a really interesting,

2567
02:33:19,910 --> 02:33:22,010
so he was this documentary.
Yeah, it's a document,

2568
02:33:22,011 --> 02:33:24,050
I think it's called the source family.

2569
02:33:24,760 --> 02:33:29,760
And so father Yod was this dude who
started the first vegetarian restaurant in

2570
02:33:31,101 --> 02:33:35,630
America and he was in Hollywood and it
became like a place where Goldie Hawn or

2571
02:33:35,631 --> 02:33:39,530
some, you know, I don't know. People
in the early sixties were going and uh,

2572
02:33:39,670 --> 02:33:42,470
it'd be, you know, Dennis Hopper
and that kind of scene. Right.

2573
02:33:42,980 --> 02:33:47,980
And then it became a cult and he ended
up like basically marrying like 30 women

2574
02:33:48,171 --> 02:33:52,430
or something. But he was this big
charismatic dude. He was like,

2575
02:33:52,431 --> 02:33:56,450
Charles Manson without the nastiness,
right. Check out the movie.

2576
02:33:56,451 --> 02:33:59,720
It'll blow your mind.
I won't tell you any more because like,

2577
02:33:59,721 --> 02:34:02,000
it takes turns that you don't see coming.

2578
02:34:02,120 --> 02:34:06,240
And it tells you a lot about what la was
like in the sixties and seventies well,

2579
02:34:06,450 --> 02:34:06,630
oh,

2580
02:34:06,630 --> 02:34:07,291
I was like,

2581
02:34:07,291 --> 02:34:10,530
I mean the whole country was thrown on
its head in the 60s like no one knew what

2582
02:34:10,531 --> 02:34:15,531
the fuck to expect as soon as that acid
and marijuana got into the system post

2583
02:34:15,570 --> 02:34:18,160
Vietnam or during Vietnam?

2584
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:22,240
During Vietnam. The whole system
went wacky. Yeah. And he was,

2585
02:34:22,241 --> 02:34:26,020
I mean you'll relate to him in some ways
cause he was like physically he was a

2586
02:34:26,021 --> 02:34:29,290
really serious dude.
Like he was a green baret I think.

2587
02:34:29,291 --> 02:34:34,291
And he had killed a couple of people
and then he like spun out into drug

2588
02:34:35,081 --> 02:34:38,230
addiction or alcohol or something
and then he got his shit together.

2589
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:43,330
But he was just so fucking charismatic
that like people just gathered around him

2590
02:34:43,331 --> 02:34:46,420
all the time.
But at that,

2591
02:34:46,870 --> 02:34:48,340
if you watch it and we'll talk further,

2592
02:34:48,341 --> 02:34:52,810
I don't want to say anything else because
I'm really interested in Netflix or

2593
02:34:53,970 --> 02:34:55,840
apple. Yeah. It's somewhere out there.

2594
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:59,230
The source fan source family and
also that Verner Herzog thing,

2595
02:34:59,231 --> 02:35:03,540
encounters at the end of the world.
I don't mean to be giving you homework,

2596
02:35:04,100 --> 02:35:06,170
homework that's,
and you like her.

2597
02:35:06,300 --> 02:35:09,260
It's this same pad.

2598
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:14,170
Has Sierra Lynch on it for the last time
you were here? Like my brain is not.

2599
02:35:14,171 --> 02:35:18,150
Yeah. Is this your, like
when Chris Ryan's here?

2600
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,010
I guess I haven't been
writing that many notes.

2601
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:23,950
I mean there's other notes that aren't
from here. Oh, well I'm honored man.

2602
02:35:23,951 --> 02:35:26,130
And you're taking some notes.
The end of the world.

2603
02:35:26,131 --> 02:35:30,970
What does it encounters ferner
her to see the one about, um,

2604
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:35,710
the, uh, the cave art
in three d, You know,

2605
02:35:35,711 --> 02:35:40,711
I've been to less SCO in the real
cave was crazy only with an official

2606
02:35:42,521 --> 02:35:45,520
invitation from the French
government. Yeah. Because, um,

2607
02:35:45,550 --> 02:35:50,020
the people affected with
their breathing. Yeah. Yeah.

2608
02:35:50,021 --> 02:35:53,610
That was a crazy day, man.
That was, that was awhile ago.

2609
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:58,540
I'm like looking at those things in person
and knowing that someone 40,000 years

2610
02:35:58,541 --> 02:36:03,130
ago or whatever, 25 unless Sko, but
some of them, some of them are 40.

2611
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:07,750
The writing on this wall that
long ago, like a bowl, right?

2612
02:36:07,780 --> 02:36:11,950
It's the bison and it's like
as big as that wall behind you.

2613
02:36:11,951 --> 02:36:16,510
It's like three or four meters long and
maybe two or three meters high and it's

2614
02:36:16,511 --> 02:36:17,960
red ochre.
Wow.

2615
02:36:18,190 --> 02:36:21,910
It's just extraordinary because like
as her talk shows in that movie,

2616
02:36:21,911 --> 02:36:26,911
they use the contour of the rock to
accentuate the contours of the body of the

2617
02:36:27,251 --> 02:36:27,671
animal.

2618
02:36:27,671 --> 02:36:31,750
So like there's a bulge in the rock and
that's in the shoulder of the bison and

2619
02:36:31,751 --> 02:36:35,440
the fucking amazing. But I'll
tell you that. I mean, let's go.

2620
02:36:35,441 --> 02:36:37,190
It's a real honor to be invited.

2621
02:36:37,191 --> 02:36:41,800
And it was only because I was with Stanley
Kripner and Stanley goddess invited

2622
02:36:42,040 --> 02:36:45,400
his assistant doing, he's
already, he's in China right now.

2623
02:36:46,390 --> 02:36:51,390
Stoppable they invite him every year to
go to China and speak about shamanism,

2624
02:36:52,511 --> 02:36:54,920
I think. Wow. He was an interesting guy.

2625
02:36:54,921 --> 02:36:56,680
I was really fascinating
when you brought him in here.

2626
02:36:56,910 --> 02:37:00,430
He's really fascinated by listening to
his words and I'm really glad you did

2627
02:37:00,431 --> 02:37:03,640
that too because he's, you
know, he's 85 or something.

2628
02:37:03,641 --> 02:37:05,740
He's not going to be
around forever. But, uh,

2629
02:37:06,250 --> 02:37:08,630
he's really underappreciated because he's,

2630
02:37:08,850 --> 02:37:13,840
he's published 25 books and 700
scientific papers and you know,

2631
02:37:13,841 --> 02:37:16,490
but he never saw it.
The media

2632
02:37:16,490 --> 02:37:19,250
or anything. But he was on the
Johnny Carson show a few times.

2633
02:37:19,251 --> 02:37:22,340
What's he really about?
What? Well, he was the guy,

2634
02:37:22,370 --> 02:37:27,370
he was like the go to guy in the late
sixties early seventies when you were

2635
02:37:27,651 --> 02:37:32,060
talking about psychics. So like he
would go with the amazing Kreskin,

2636
02:37:32,270 --> 02:37:35,810
you know, do you remember the amazing
crush spoon bending and all that.

2637
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:40,580
So they would have doctor crib neuron
to sort of, you know, monitor the,

2638
02:37:40,581 --> 02:37:42,360
the experiment and you know,

2639
02:37:42,470 --> 02:37:46,130
try to catch Kreskin and lay
his trickery and all this stuff.

2640
02:37:46,131 --> 02:37:47,630
And so yeah,

2641
02:37:47,650 --> 02:37:52,220
I joke with Stanley that his Rolodex
has like three people under the amazing,

2642
02:37:53,210 --> 02:37:56,690
the amazing Randy, the amazing
Kreskin and some other amazing,

2643
02:37:57,470 --> 02:37:58,400
amazing Randy.

2644
02:37:58,401 --> 02:38:03,320
He's a fascinating cat too cause he sort
of set out to try to disprove as much

2645
02:38:03,321 --> 02:38:06,230
of that shit as possible even
though that's how he started out.

2646
02:38:06,290 --> 02:38:09,310
Well he's a magician as, as Stanley. Yeah.

2647
02:38:09,380 --> 02:38:14,380
So magicians are really skeptical because
they make a living tricking people so

2648
02:38:14,811 --> 02:38:19,190
they know how easy it is to do. When I did
that, a Scifi show, we had this guy on,

2649
02:38:19,191 --> 02:38:23,810
his name is Ben a check and he's
fucking amazing. If that shit amazing.

2650
02:38:23,811 --> 02:38:26,390
I mean he did the spoon bending
thing right in front of my,

2651
02:38:26,391 --> 02:38:28,730
I couldn't figure out what
the hell he was doing,

2652
02:38:28,731 --> 02:38:31,880
but he's super adamant about what he does.

2653
02:38:31,881 --> 02:38:36,200
What I'm doing is just tricks, right?
These are tricks. I don't have any powers.

2654
02:38:36,380 --> 02:38:39,930
This is, I can't tell you how I'm doing
it because this is my thing and I'm,

2655
02:38:39,960 --> 02:38:42,950
I'm you know, making a living doing
this. But I'll tell you right now,

2656
02:38:42,951 --> 02:38:46,490
it's bullshit. I'm really good at
this bullshit, but it's bullshit.

2657
02:38:46,820 --> 02:38:48,680
But I mean he was amazing.

2658
02:38:48,681 --> 02:38:52,760
And when he would pull information out
of people about their childhood and

2659
02:38:52,761 --> 02:38:55,930
guests things and explain where
they came from and like how,

2660
02:38:55,931 --> 02:38:59,360
it was just like mind blowing. And I'm
like, how the fuck are you doing? This?

2661
02:38:59,830 --> 02:39:02,330
Wouldn't say, but he would say,
I'm not telling you I'm doing this,

2662
02:39:02,331 --> 02:39:05,830
but I'm telling you right now, I'm
not psychic. This is all fakery.

2663
02:39:05,990 --> 02:39:07,130
It's all bullshit.

2664
02:39:07,550 --> 02:39:12,550
But he would get furious when he would
like the long island medium or one of

2665
02:39:12,771 --> 02:39:16,190
those shows where they had people and
tell them about their dead relatives.

2666
02:39:16,191 --> 02:39:20,960
He's like, this is, these
are crooks, these are, these
are, these people are shit.

2667
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:22,610
Like they're ruining people.

2668
02:39:22,611 --> 02:39:25,970
They're stealing money from people with
their trickery and the people who are

2669
02:39:25,971 --> 02:39:29,910
grieving, vulnerable. Come
on. And I look in the, Ah, ah,

2670
02:39:29,930 --> 02:39:31,580
that's the saddest shit
about people that are,

2671
02:39:31,581 --> 02:39:34,460
that go after folks that are hurting,
you know,

2672
02:39:34,461 --> 02:39:38,510
like with their loss and then they say
he's talking to you from behind the,

2673
02:39:38,540 --> 02:39:39,530
beyond the grave.

2674
02:39:39,950 --> 02:39:43,850
I feel like he's reaching out to you
and he's happy with where you are and he

2675
02:39:43,851 --> 02:39:46,580
just wants you to,
there's something that you're about to do.

2676
02:39:46,581 --> 02:39:49,640
Is there something you're thinking about
doing all this, this business project?

2677
02:39:49,641 --> 02:39:54,620
Yes. That's, that's it. That's it.
Yeah. And the fucking monsters. Okay.

2678
02:39:54,621 --> 02:39:59,621
Then extrapolate from that to the
American medical system where 30% of all

2679
02:40:00,291 --> 02:40:03,110
Medicaid is spent in the
last month of people's lives.

2680
02:40:03,170 --> 02:40:05,680
Does that really the amount? I
think so. Meanwhile, mushrooms,

2681
02:40:05,980 --> 02:40:09,290
it could grow mushrooms. It's giving
them that a fraction. Is that,

2682
02:40:09,460 --> 02:40:12,890
what is it when you're doing a hip
replacement on a 90 year old blind lady?

2683
02:40:13,900 --> 02:40:14,480
Fucking

2684
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:16,500
again, you know, or you know it. No,

2685
02:40:16,501 --> 02:40:20,550
there's this experimental treatment
we can try on grandma. You know,

2686
02:40:20,900 --> 02:40:24,060
it's going to like all her hair's gonna
fall out and she won't be able to see,

2687
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:29,100
but you know, we'll get $40,000 from your
insurance company. It's the same thing,

2688
02:40:29,130 --> 02:40:30,480
you know,
it's so fucking

2689
02:40:30,910 --> 02:40:35,170
sense in that sense. The dying
people, they mean there's
a, there's a lack of, uh,

2690
02:40:35,650 --> 02:40:38,980
accepting of the futility
of the body failing.

2691
02:40:39,340 --> 02:40:42,780
But didn't they just pass assisted
suicide in California like,

2692
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:45,550
or the ability to Jerry
Brown just signed it. I mean,

2693
02:40:45,551 --> 02:40:48,990
I think that's important too,
because I think we put our dogs down.

2694
02:40:49,010 --> 02:40:53,680
My dogs are sick and suffering. We know
that they're 15 years old and there's no,

2695
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:57,280
there's no positive ending to this,
but we don't do with people.

2696
02:40:57,281 --> 02:41:00,820
We make people like naturally rot away.
And I know there's this,

2697
02:41:00,880 --> 02:41:05,050
there's a potential for fuckery and for
people that want inheritance money and

2698
02:41:05,051 --> 02:41:10,051
the you talk your elderly dad who's got
Alzheimer's into signing over some will

2699
02:41:10,721 --> 02:41:13,810
just before you fucking off him.
There's a lot of that that's real.

2700
02:41:13,811 --> 02:41:18,811
It's 100% I know a guy who found out
that his own brother had talked his mom

2701
02:41:19,180 --> 02:41:23,460
into signing a fucking new will and he
had a fight him in court over it while it

2702
02:41:23,461 --> 02:41:25,420
was mom's sick.
His mom was like,

2703
02:41:25,421 --> 02:41:29,200
she's got some sort of a neurological
disorder and she's completely out of it.

2704
02:41:29,201 --> 02:41:32,320
And he,
he did this while his mom was sick.

2705
02:41:32,350 --> 02:41:35,560
He was taking care of his mom and he
had to hurt. I mean it was fucking,

2706
02:41:35,620 --> 02:41:37,720
as soon as it was horrible,
horrible people out there that do,

2707
02:41:37,721 --> 02:41:40,540
do things like that and they could do
something like that and then put someone

2708
02:41:40,541 --> 02:41:43,360
down.
But on the other hand,

2709
02:41:43,540 --> 02:41:48,070
like why would you want someone to just
suffer in fucking complete and total

2710
02:41:48,071 --> 02:41:50,890
agony for the remaining five months,
six months,

2711
02:41:50,891 --> 02:41:55,300
their life so that you can rest easy in
the fact that they went out with God,

2712
02:41:55,420 --> 02:41:56,020
they went out

2713
02:41:56,020 --> 02:41:59,170
naturally outweigh fighting.
You know,

2714
02:41:59,171 --> 02:42:04,040
after a long fight with like why
is fighting so admirable? What,

2715
02:42:04,041 --> 02:42:08,590
what happened to like gracefully
accepting the fact that we're all mortal,

2716
02:42:08,740 --> 02:42:12,400
especially. It's not like, well grandpa
fought it and then he lived forever.

2717
02:42:13,870 --> 02:42:18,460
He Won. He Won. He went back
in time. Now he's 20 you know,

2718
02:42:18,461 --> 02:42:21,010
Grandpa is getting younger every year.
It's so strange.

2719
02:42:21,160 --> 02:42:23,710
He just started competing in gymnastics,
so it's amazing.

2720
02:42:24,470 --> 02:42:27,010
He's going to stop shaving soon.
What about,

2721
02:42:28,240 --> 02:42:32,620
what about hermetically sealed
stainless steel caskets? Oh yeah,

2722
02:42:32,621 --> 02:42:33,880
that's what's up with that.

2723
02:42:34,230 --> 02:42:38,520
Like what exactly is it that your
ceiling out or in, I'm not sure what,

2724
02:42:38,560 --> 02:42:42,850
which way the seals preserve him
from nature. Well, wouldn't you want,

2725
02:42:42,851 --> 02:42:44,550
I mean like this ashes to ashes,

2726
02:42:44,690 --> 02:42:48,670
dust to dust. Don't you want, don't you
want them to be absorbed by the earth?

2727
02:42:48,700 --> 02:42:49,610
Don't do it. The, the,

2728
02:42:49,611 --> 02:42:54,400
they're the skin vessel to be useful and
maybe a tree will grow underneath them

2729
02:42:54,401 --> 02:42:55,234
or,

2730
02:42:55,600 --> 02:42:59,710
that's what I'm saying about American
Cultured Dab, Duh. Right. Denial, anger,

2731
02:42:59,711 --> 02:43:04,030
bargaining, depression, acceptance.
Do you think the culture's stuck,

2732
02:43:04,090 --> 02:43:05,860
but do you think that's
changing, do you think? Do,

2733
02:43:05,950 --> 02:43:09,010
and I think largely because this
conversations like this, you know,

2734
02:43:09,070 --> 02:43:12,250
I think largely because of
people able to communicate

2735
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:15,700
with each other and express how
futile that is and ridiculous that is

2736
02:43:16,170 --> 02:43:18,180
because that's the kind of thing,
if you know,

2737
02:43:18,181 --> 02:43:20,780
if you're a parent or grandparent is or,

2738
02:43:20,870 --> 02:43:24,930
or husband or wife is facing this kind of
thing and you're, you're thinking, fuck,

2739
02:43:24,960 --> 02:43:29,910
you know, I could put the dog down.
I can't help my wife die in peace.

2740
02:43:29,960 --> 02:43:34,050
Know you're not going to say
that to anyone. You get arrested,

2741
02:43:34,051 --> 02:43:37,230
you'll get ostracized. But we
can say it publicly. You know,

2742
02:43:37,231 --> 02:43:40,110
some people somewhere say is fuck it.
This is the truth.

2743
02:43:40,350 --> 02:43:45,000
Like in the book I quote from
a doctor's and you look at how,

2744
02:43:45,090 --> 02:43:49,080
what choices doctors make for
themselves when they're dying. Oh.

2745
02:43:49,230 --> 02:43:54,150
Versus what they recommend to their
patients. Completely different.

2746
02:43:54,270 --> 02:43:55,103
Yeah.

2747
02:43:55,330 --> 02:44:00,330
I have access easy cause they
know CPR rarely does anything.

2748
02:44:00,361 --> 02:44:03,990
When you're 80 years old and you have
a heart attack, say CPR, you know,

2749
02:44:03,991 --> 02:44:07,170
might keep you pumping along
for another couple of weeks,

2750
02:44:07,171 --> 02:44:11,470
but you'll have brain damage, broken
ribs and you know, excruciating pain.

2751
02:44:11,470 --> 02:44:16,410
A CPR works great. And movies, and
actually I quote those stats on TV,

2752
02:44:16,411 --> 02:44:17,071
the,
you know,

2753
02:44:17,071 --> 02:44:21,090
the number of people who go home and lead
a healthy life after receiving CPR is

2754
02:44:21,091 --> 02:44:25,880
like 95% and in reality it's like 6% yeah.

2755
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:28,950
So it's, it's a funny,
so funny, but you know,

2756
02:44:28,951 --> 02:44:31,230
getting back to the people
you're saying who, you know,

2757
02:44:31,410 --> 02:44:35,370
sign this and then often what are
the question I have is like, are we,

2758
02:44:36,660 --> 02:44:39,870
are we making there are creeps
who will do that shit, right?

2759
02:44:39,871 --> 02:44:41,700
There are situations that are really ugly,

2760
02:44:41,730 --> 02:44:46,730
but by our refusal to openly talk
about this stuff and make these things

2761
02:44:47,161 --> 02:44:50,190
available,
are we empowering them or not?

2762
02:44:50,520 --> 02:44:54,360
Because the assumption is that
they would have more power.

2763
02:44:54,390 --> 02:44:58,560
But I think if you have an open adult
conversation about these things in a

2764
02:44:58,561 --> 02:45:01,650
government that acknowledges that
sometimes the right thing to do is to help

2765
02:45:01,651 --> 02:45:05,700
someone die without pain and the
hospice gets funded a lot and all that.

2766
02:45:06,060 --> 02:45:08,730
I think that this enables those people.

2767
02:45:08,731 --> 02:45:11,400
It disempowers them because
then grandma's getting,

2768
02:45:11,401 --> 02:45:12,640
when she's still got her shit together,

2769
02:45:12,641 --> 02:45:14,910
there's going to be more
open about talking about it.

2770
02:45:14,911 --> 02:45:18,480
There's going to be more advanced
directive signed. People are going to be,

2771
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:22,440
you know, it's like sex where
the abstinence only programs,

2772
02:45:22,530 --> 02:45:27,360
those are the states where the most
STDs are pregnancies, teen pregnancies.

2773
02:45:27,361 --> 02:45:30,300
Right. So you refuse to talk
about it. You just make it worse.

2774
02:45:30,380 --> 02:45:33,130
[inaudible] yeah,
that it only makes sense in that sense.

2775
02:45:33,460 --> 02:45:35,350
And I know that's a double,

2776
02:45:35,500 --> 02:45:40,500
but I think that what's going on now
that has never existed before is that our

2777
02:45:40,571 --> 02:45:44,380
culture is not just being shaped
by whatever media is projected.

2778
02:45:44,710 --> 02:45:48,580
For the longest time, our culture was
shaped by the people that surrounded us.

2779
02:45:48,610 --> 02:45:52,060
You know? And that's why leaders were so
important. Right. And the tribal cultures,

2780
02:45:52,270 --> 02:45:55,510
tribal elders and Shamans and the
people that had lived a long life and it

2781
02:45:55,511 --> 02:45:59,380
learned and you could listen to them
and they could explain these experiences

2782
02:45:59,381 --> 02:46:01,840
that they've gone through and perhaps
you're going to go through rites of

2783
02:46:01,841 --> 02:46:04,890
passages were also very important
for that same reason like you've got,

2784
02:46:05,050 --> 02:46:07,450
you're going to go through something
and experience something and then you'll

2785
02:46:07,451 --> 02:46:09,590
have a greater understanding
of the world because of that.

2786
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:14,660
And for the longest time in our,
in our most recent history,

2787
02:46:14,870 --> 02:46:16,970
you know, it's the longest
time of, for us pretty recent,

2788
02:46:17,050 --> 02:46:21,980
but the last few hundred years it was
either a books that gave us a depiction of

2789
02:46:21,981 --> 02:46:24,350
the world and we kind of
learned from that and said,

2790
02:46:24,351 --> 02:46:26,000
well this is obviously how the world goes.

2791
02:46:26,240 --> 02:46:31,100
Or then it became motion pictures and
television and father knows best and you

2792
02:46:31,101 --> 02:46:31,281
know,

2793
02:46:31,281 --> 02:46:36,281
all these different shows that sort of
gave us this idea or ideal of what life

2794
02:46:36,951 --> 02:46:37,784
is all about.

2795
02:46:37,790 --> 02:46:42,770
And that's where we've formed our
vision or our version of reality.

2796
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:44,240
But now it's different.

2797
02:46:44,420 --> 02:46:48,980
Like now our version of realities
is informed by conversations.

2798
02:46:49,130 --> 02:46:53,000
Our version of reality is being formed
by people communicating with each other

2799
02:46:53,170 --> 02:46:56,480
and it's just a completely different
sort of experience because now you're

2800
02:46:56,481 --> 02:46:57,560
seeing a broader,

2801
02:46:57,561 --> 02:47:02,561
wider sort of conversation going on with
whether or not this like it just even

2802
02:47:05,510 --> 02:47:07,140
movements that are extreme like,

2803
02:47:07,160 --> 02:47:12,160
like whether it's paid or whether it's
a animal rights organizations or uh,

2804
02:47:13,990 --> 02:47:14,300
uh,

2805
02:47:14,300 --> 02:47:19,300
gay rights organizations or trans rights
or whether these like these black lives

2806
02:47:20,631 --> 02:47:21,590
matter or these other,

2807
02:47:21,710 --> 02:47:25,970
there's all these different groups
that have like way broader reach with

2808
02:47:25,971 --> 02:47:29,060
activism. That event, it
was never possible before.

2809
02:47:29,390 --> 02:47:31,760
Like if you didn't have a
guy like Martin Luther King,

2810
02:47:31,820 --> 02:47:36,380
a charismatic leader that could speak
up and give speeches. I have a dream.

2811
02:47:36,480 --> 02:47:41,090
Like if you didn't have that guy, who
the fuck else do you have? So few voices.

2812
02:47:41,330 --> 02:47:45,890
But now anyone with a concept or an
idea that resonates with other people,

2813
02:47:45,891 --> 02:47:50,240
you can make a tweet and that tweet can
go viral and that viral tweak and shape

2814
02:47:50,241 --> 02:47:52,550
the way people look at a certain subject.

2815
02:47:52,910 --> 02:47:57,740
You could write a Facebook blog or a
tumbler blog or make a short youtube video

2816
02:47:57,741 --> 02:48:00,880
and people could watch that video
and see your perspective. Go God.

2817
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:01,753
And he's right.

2818
02:48:01,790 --> 02:48:05,210
Chris Ryan made a great point there and
then they exchange it and they spread it.

2819
02:48:05,211 --> 02:48:09,160
Send him money, send that motherfucker
sub cash, pay pal, that dude's in cash.

2820
02:48:09,520 --> 02:48:14,300
You know this, but this, this the
unique time where we can all sort of,

2821
02:48:14,600 --> 02:48:17,390
we can all aid and shaping our culture.

2822
02:48:17,390 --> 02:48:20,900
We can all aid in shaping our
view of the world that we live in.

2823
02:48:21,140 --> 02:48:24,020
That just wasn't available before.
It just wasn't available.

2824
02:48:24,021 --> 02:48:25,600
What are you going to mimeograph on?

2825
02:48:25,601 --> 02:48:30,230
Million pamphlets and pass them out best
you could become one of those people

2826
02:48:30,231 --> 02:48:33,470
that shapes it for everybody else.
Like you'd be counter circle. Well,

2827
02:48:33,471 --> 02:48:37,070
even if you make a movie, you know,
or if you make a write a book,

2828
02:48:37,071 --> 02:48:42,071
but even then the movie is going
to be censored by the money.

2829
02:48:42,610 --> 02:48:46,820
Now you can make an independent movie
with $20,000 in your fucking iPhone. Yeah,

2830
02:48:46,821 --> 02:48:48,050
it's great. Yeah, you don't even,

2831
02:48:48,220 --> 02:48:51,530
and then you could do it through a go
fund me or a Kickstarter or some shit.

2832
02:48:51,890 --> 02:48:56,840
You don't need anybody's help. I mean,
we live in a weird, weird time. It's a,

2833
02:48:56,841 --> 02:48:57,621
it's amazing,

2834
02:48:57,621 --> 02:49:01,700
but I feel like we don't appreciate
it or can't recognize how insanely

2835
02:49:01,701 --> 02:49:03,950
transformative it is
because we're a part of it.

2836
02:49:04,370 --> 02:49:06,410
I think like one day in the future,

2837
02:49:06,411 --> 02:49:09,120
they'll look back at the 21st
century and they'll look back,

2838
02:49:09,121 --> 02:49:11,110
particularly at the time from,
you know,

2839
02:49:11,670 --> 02:49:16,670
the year 2000 I think maybe even 2001
maybe September 11th would be like a

2840
02:49:17,041 --> 02:49:20,010
tipping point because of all the
chaos that went along with that.

2841
02:49:20,250 --> 02:49:23,520
And they'll look at the amount of change
that's taking place in the last 14

2842
02:49:23,521 --> 02:49:27,110
years, since September 11 and they'll
go, this fucking put this will,

2843
02:49:27,360 --> 02:49:32,360
what a whirlwind of change
and ideas and transformation.

2844
02:49:33,150 --> 02:49:34,710
And in the middle of it,
we're,

2845
02:49:34,711 --> 02:49:38,460
we're just in the middle of it with our
iPhones and you're fucking, you know,

2846
02:49:38,550 --> 02:49:41,880
youtube and periscope and all this crazy
shit is going on and we're not even

2847
02:49:41,881 --> 02:49:44,230
realizing how bizarre it is.
Well,

2848
02:49:44,360 --> 02:49:47,230
I mean, I don't know if you're,
how you're younger than me,

2849
02:49:47,231 --> 02:49:52,231
but I remember in 1992 I lived in
San Francisco and I had a computer,

2850
02:49:53,021 --> 02:49:53,890
a Compaq,

2851
02:49:54,460 --> 02:49:59,230
and the Internet was starting and I was
in graduate school and I had come from

2852
02:49:59,231 --> 02:50:03,520
Spain to go to do graduate school in San
Francisco and the Internet was starting

2853
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:08,650
and this graduate school, uh, didn't
want to incorporate the Internet.

2854
02:50:08,710 --> 02:50:11,860
They were like, Nah, that's it. You know,
it's bullshit. Right. And I was like,

2855
02:50:11,861 --> 02:50:15,700
if you guys would use this, I could
go back to Spain, you know? Like,

2856
02:50:15,880 --> 02:50:20,770
that was my idea. It's like this is going
to be big, this internet thing. You know,

2857
02:50:21,140 --> 02:50:25,210
you thought that even then that it
would be like a global thing. I thought,

2858
02:50:25,211 --> 02:50:27,700
I mean, I was thinking of it
in terms of my own life, right?

2859
02:50:27,710 --> 02:50:31,210
Because I'd wanted to be back in Spain.
I was living with a Spanish woman.

2860
02:50:31,211 --> 02:50:34,180
She missed her family and like
we were like Cha, you know,

2861
02:50:34,181 --> 02:50:36,430
I want to get an American degree but I,

2862
02:50:36,640 --> 02:50:40,180
I really like living in Spain and she
wants to give it. And I was like, fuck,

2863
02:50:40,181 --> 02:50:45,181
if I could like submit papers this way
and the professors could answer through

2864
02:50:46,691 --> 02:50:50,140
the Internet and we could like do this
whole thing and I could be in Spain.

2865
02:50:50,980 --> 02:50:53,980
And I remember getting really frustrated
that they were just like, dad,

2866
02:50:54,100 --> 02:50:55,600
this isn't,
this isn't going to happen.

2867
02:50:55,630 --> 02:50:58,180
That shows the difference
between you and me. With me.

2868
02:50:58,181 --> 02:50:59,350
When I first got on the Internet,

2869
02:50:59,351 --> 02:51:03,880
it was 1994 all I did
was download UFO reports,

2870
02:51:04,060 --> 02:51:07,050
ca porn. I was looking for
porn. I was like of report to.

2871
02:51:07,070 --> 02:51:11,200
But it was frustrating because
it was like click, click, click.

2872
02:51:11,260 --> 02:51:16,240
Oh there's nice top of her breasts.
And I was single and living by myself.

2873
02:51:16,241 --> 02:51:18,250
So I just would go to the DVD store,

2874
02:51:18,610 --> 02:51:23,610
fucking rush those beads aside like
a gangster and either rent them

2875
02:51:27,160 --> 02:51:29,920
only room,
sometimes they had saloon doors,

2876
02:51:31,330 --> 02:51:35,020
the doors apart and go into that and
everybody would be, would feel so guilty.

2877
02:51:35,021 --> 02:51:36,130
And the porn section.

2878
02:51:36,160 --> 02:51:40,330
Do you ever see a porn movie in a
theater with like a bunch of old men and

2879
02:51:40,340 --> 02:51:44,440
raincoat? No, no. I took my girlfriend
in high school. Oh well, you know,

2880
02:51:44,540 --> 02:51:46,870
they really cliche well boots.

2881
02:51:46,960 --> 02:51:51,610
I told you I have this super hot Cuban
girlfriend and my last year of high

2882
02:51:51,611 --> 02:51:55,240
school and uh,
we went to a dirty movie.

2883
02:51:55,241 --> 02:52:00,160
I think it was Debbie does Dallas. Oh
yeah. That's how old I am. And uh, yeah,

2884
02:52:00,161 --> 02:52:03,850
I remember taking her in and I remember
just like, it was like, you know,

2885
02:52:03,880 --> 02:52:07,390
like taking a chunk, seal meat
into a shark tank, you know,

2886
02:52:07,391 --> 02:52:10,480
it's just like the dudes are just like,
yeah,

2887
02:52:10,481 --> 02:52:14,940
we'll want a live one.
There it is. How cool

2888
02:52:17,700 --> 02:52:18,700
did you ever see,

2889
02:52:18,850 --> 02:52:19,120
um,

2890
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:24,040
that when deep throat came out it was
essentially viewed as a cinematic film.

2891
02:52:24,041 --> 02:52:26,740
It wasn't like porn wasn't really a thing.

2892
02:52:26,741 --> 02:52:31,560
There was stag films which were just like
these weird weird clips on 16 million

2893
02:52:31,640 --> 02:52:36,350
meet early Jack Nicholson standing in
line in Times Square. Johnny Carson,

2894
02:52:37,080 --> 02:52:41,210
it was a famous photo of Johnny Carson
and all these people dressed up really

2895
02:52:41,211 --> 02:52:44,150
nice and they're waiting in
line to go see deep throat.

2896
02:52:44,180 --> 02:52:48,770
Have you seen the documentary inside deep?
Thorough now? Yeah. Well another one.

2897
02:52:52,150 --> 02:52:55,430
I'm expecting a report a
Monday morning by the way,

2898
02:52:55,431 --> 02:52:58,510
on the one with Lindsay Lohan,
right. No incident. She chief away.

2899
02:52:58,550 --> 02:53:03,080
It's a documentary about exactly what
you're saying about the cultural moment

2900
02:53:03,140 --> 02:53:07,550
that deep throat presented and how yeah.
Uh,

2901
02:53:07,910 --> 02:53:12,630
Lindsay Lohan play that role in a movie
that very few people watched that happen.

2902
02:53:13,250 --> 02:53:18,200
Um, Linda Lovelace. Yes. Yeah,
yeah. Poor Linda Lovelace.

2903
02:53:18,290 --> 02:53:23,240
Cause she then became a tool of the
feminist movement. She did. Yeah, she,

2904
02:53:23,241 --> 02:53:26,180
and then she claimed that she had
been raped and that the whole thing,

2905
02:53:26,480 --> 02:53:30,470
she didn't enjoy any of it.
And then at the end of her life,

2906
02:53:30,471 --> 02:53:34,280
I think she was diagnosed with cancer
and that at the end of her life she was

2907
02:53:34,281 --> 02:53:37,820
like, no, that was bullshit and
all convinced me to say that.

2908
02:53:37,821 --> 02:53:42,320
But really I was just having fun and it
was talking a lot of dicks. No big deal.

2909
02:53:42,370 --> 02:53:45,740
Yeah. Well, you know,

2910
02:53:45,810 --> 02:53:50,660
oftentimes people do become tools
of groups that have these, uh,

2911
02:53:50,760 --> 02:53:55,110
ideological principles that you may or
may not go with the idea of the feminist

2912
02:53:55,111 --> 02:53:56,510
movement.
And like th th the,

2913
02:53:56,730 --> 02:54:00,600
the real problem that a lot of people
have is that there's some women that are

2914
02:54:00,601 --> 02:54:01,350
involved in that,

2915
02:54:01,350 --> 02:54:05,010
that really don't like men and they're
opposed to men and they're opposed to,

2916
02:54:05,250 --> 02:54:06,750
there was one woman who was a part of,

2917
02:54:06,780 --> 02:54:08,790
I think it's called Google
ideas or something like that,

2918
02:54:09,030 --> 02:54:11,460
but she had this a
Twitter page and you know,

2919
02:54:11,461 --> 02:54:13,620
she was arguing with people on Twitter.
And one of the things she said is,

2920
02:54:13,980 --> 02:54:18,510
I men for dinner or eight men for
breakfast. Like, you think I'm scared,

2921
02:54:18,511 --> 02:54:22,670
I eat men for breakfast. And
everybody's like, what? What do you,

2922
02:54:22,680 --> 02:54:25,530
why would you say that? Like
all men, like not even assholes.

2923
02:54:25,531 --> 02:54:26,370
Like why would you even say that?

2924
02:54:26,370 --> 02:54:30,660
Like you imagine if a man said that if
a man in any position of power, like,

2925
02:54:30,661 --> 02:54:32,490
and she was,
I believe what,

2926
02:54:32,710 --> 02:54:35,670
and I'm parenting poor
understanding of what's going on.

2927
02:54:35,671 --> 02:54:39,400
But I believe that she was
brought in to sort of, um, uh,

2928
02:54:39,450 --> 02:54:43,230
bring more diversity to this project
they were doing, you know, this,

2929
02:54:43,231 --> 02:54:46,950
this idea and that bringing a feminist
perspective was going to, you know,

2930
02:54:47,190 --> 02:54:49,650
balance things out a little bit,
which is always a good idea. Right.

2931
02:54:49,950 --> 02:54:53,000
But when you read something
like that, like that's, if,

2932
02:54:53,040 --> 02:54:56,490
even if that's not really her intention,
just having that perspective,

2933
02:54:56,610 --> 02:54:59,580
having the perspective of a, you
know, I eat men for breakfast.

2934
02:54:59,880 --> 02:55:03,820
Like you could never say I was a nice way,
like come unwelcome.

2935
02:55:05,320 --> 02:55:09,540
I mean, hey, that's, that's
not bad. I like women who
have men for breakfast. Yeah.

2936
02:55:10,010 --> 02:55:13,640
You know, blow job.
There's the half asleep.

2937
02:55:13,641 --> 02:55:17,840
Blow job is a beautiful thing. It's
going away. It's like the Dodo bird.

2938
02:55:20,760 --> 02:55:21,790
It's like the wooded owl.

2939
02:55:21,791 --> 02:55:26,460
If we don't stop cutting down these
trees and we're not talking about doesn't

2940
02:55:26,590 --> 02:55:29,930
count because then you're not even there
for, it takes a special kind of passion.

2941
02:55:29,990 --> 02:55:34,520
And uh, I think, uh, some people just
don't have that for each other. Well,

2942
02:55:34,521 --> 02:55:37,520
and I think when you're half asleep
you can sort of enjoy it more

2943
02:55:39,030 --> 02:55:40,910
relaxed, more when you, you know,

2944
02:55:40,911 --> 02:55:43,610
you're cuddling together and then
someone just decides to start something.

2945
02:55:43,611 --> 02:55:46,510
You're like, all right, we're doing
this right. Ooh, well you do it.

2946
02:55:46,511 --> 02:55:49,940
I'll just sort of lie here sometimes
that's fun too. Yeah, sure, sure.

2947
02:55:50,030 --> 02:55:54,050
I did not consent. Well, there's like
a lot of madness now too, with sexy.

2948
02:55:54,080 --> 02:55:57,070
They want there, there were something
they were handing out to, um,

2949
02:55:57,770 --> 02:56:00,350
young students now where
they were saying that you,

2950
02:56:00,380 --> 02:56:03,470
you literally have to get consent. There
were, there were saying that they should,

2951
02:56:03,500 --> 02:56:07,340
you should get consent every 10
seconds during any, every, any sex act.

2952
02:56:07,370 --> 02:56:11,590
I'm sure there's an APP, you know, Siri,
ask her every 10 seconds, you know? Yeah.

2953
02:56:11,900 --> 02:56:15,140
If she's enjoying, do you consent
to this mass? Shove it in harder.

2954
02:56:15,650 --> 02:56:19,730
May I go faster, you know, may I pull it
back and then put it back in again, man.

2955
02:56:20,090 --> 02:56:24,470
Now rub it on the outside. May I tease
you man, we live in a world world. Yeah.

2956
02:56:24,500 --> 02:56:28,970
Well, it's America to have
you been to Spain? No, never.
You got to come visit man.

2957
02:56:29,020 --> 02:56:31,760
Well I think even it's not as suddenly
if you think it's really America.

2958
02:56:31,790 --> 02:56:34,640
I think it's what we were talking about
earlier about these small groups of

2959
02:56:34,641 --> 02:56:38,090
people that have these
ideas and they're very,

2960
02:56:38,120 --> 02:56:40,220
very passionate about
spreading these ideas.

2961
02:56:40,550 --> 02:56:42,920
And these ideas don't
necessarily have to be good,

2962
02:56:43,190 --> 02:56:45,800
but they have to have a bunch of other
crazy people that believe in them.

2963
02:56:45,830 --> 02:56:49,910
Like the people that convinced Linda
Lovelace in the saying that she was raped

2964
02:56:49,911 --> 02:56:53,730
and you know, the feminist movement
that co-opted her ideas. W I don't,

2965
02:56:53,780 --> 02:56:57,890
I mean they didn't do it because they
were calculating and evil and they had

2966
02:56:57,891 --> 02:57:00,800
some grand plan to ruin
it for everybody else.

2967
02:57:01,070 --> 02:57:02,960
They probably did it
because they were nuts.

2968
02:57:03,320 --> 02:57:05,600
And there's a lot of other nutty
people out there that agree with you.

2969
02:57:05,690 --> 02:57:10,690
I tweeted something the other day that
someone tweeted and it was so fucking

2970
02:57:10,731 --> 02:57:14,990
ridiculous that it, it, it,
it made me go, what the fuck?

2971
02:57:14,991 --> 02:57:18,920
I don't even know what to say, but
it was about abortion and the, uh,

2972
02:57:18,921 --> 02:57:21,590
the tweet was something like,
um,

2973
02:57:21,620 --> 02:57:26,620
abortion isn't just about women because
not everyone who gets pregnant is a

2974
02:57:27,501 --> 02:57:28,334
woman.

2975
02:57:30,580 --> 02:57:31,413
Hmm.

2976
02:57:32,490 --> 02:57:36,750
I'm not sure I get that one because
trans people can get pregnant.

2977
02:57:36,970 --> 02:57:41,970
So a woman who identifies with being
male can also get pregnant and abortion

2978
02:57:42,391 --> 02:57:47,190
rights are for her to
him him. Sorry, whatever.

2979
02:57:48,190 --> 02:57:52,890
Yeah, I'll read you or read you the exact
tweet because it's fucking maddening.

2980
02:57:52,891 --> 02:57:55,890
It's fucking crazy.
It just doesn't even make any sense.

2981
02:57:56,310 --> 02:58:00,000
And to find it right here. You found
a ready Jamie. Here it is right here.

2982
02:58:00,001 --> 02:58:02,190
I found it right here.
This is abortion.

2983
02:58:02,190 --> 02:58:04,110
Access isn't just a woman's right.

2984
02:58:04,230 --> 02:58:08,430
Not all pregnant people or people
who can get pregnant are women. What?

2985
02:58:08,431 --> 02:58:12,540
In the fucking actual
flux. But, but that's,

2986
02:58:12,630 --> 02:58:16,440
you can get a bunch of people
and go, yes, you're amazing.

2987
02:58:16,590 --> 02:58:18,870
Which he did is beautiful.
You just said was amazing. No,

2988
02:58:18,871 --> 02:58:20,900
but you said it's horse
shit like you just,

2989
02:58:20,940 --> 02:58:24,750
we just because you think
you're a man doesn't mean
you're a man. Okay, we're off.

2990
02:58:24,780 --> 02:58:29,040
We're off. On a weird tangent here,
but that's, that's what's going on.

2991
02:58:29,070 --> 02:58:32,190
Jermaine Greer got, and a lot of trouble
for saying that. Do you know who she is?

2992
02:58:32,191 --> 02:58:37,170
Yes. Yes. Correct. Yeah. The
female unit she wrote. Yeah.
So she said that she's like,

2993
02:58:37,171 --> 02:58:41,820
look, you can call yourself whatever you
want, but to me you're not a woman. Yeah.

2994
02:58:41,850 --> 02:58:45,600
And everybody's like, wow, hate language.

2995
02:58:46,090 --> 02:58:49,830
Languages are fucking opinion. Well,
not only that, like God damn it. Why?

2996
02:58:49,950 --> 02:58:53,610
Why do we assume that when
people say something nutty,

2997
02:58:53,611 --> 02:58:57,360
that they're crazy and almost every
single avenue except for gender,

2998
02:58:57,900 --> 02:59:02,340
for gender would just accept anything.
We'll just accept back and forth.

2999
02:59:02,370 --> 02:59:04,350
There's a guy that they
did speaking of radio lab,

3000
02:59:04,500 --> 02:59:09,480
an amazing piece and the guy clearly out
of his fucking mind when you listen to

3001
02:59:09,481 --> 02:59:10,300
him talk,

3002
02:59:10,300 --> 02:59:15,300
but he flips back and forth from being
male and female all day long and they're

3003
02:59:15,510 --> 02:59:20,400
talking about it like it's this
very unusual thing. It's very rare.

3004
02:59:20,460 --> 02:59:25,460
Normally with transgender they live in
one sacs and believe there are another,

3005
02:59:25,920 --> 02:59:27,870
but this person goes back and forth.

3006
02:59:27,900 --> 02:59:30,090
But when you listen to
this person talk you well,

3007
02:59:30,091 --> 02:59:31,900
this is not a stable human being.
Yeah,

3008
02:59:32,070 --> 02:59:35,010
and it's quite possible they
are out of their fucking mind.

3009
02:59:35,220 --> 02:59:39,540
But you don't consider it because it's
gender. If they thought they were a fox,

3010
02:59:39,790 --> 02:59:44,370
if they believed that they were born in
the ocean of Merck people, you would,

3011
02:59:44,430 --> 02:59:46,650
you would say, well, this
guy's out of his fucking mind.

3012
02:59:46,830 --> 02:59:50,400
But because he's talking about gender,
he could say, well now I'm a man.

3013
02:59:50,510 --> 02:59:52,380
Well now I'm, I'm a woman. I
just turned. I just turned.

3014
02:59:52,470 --> 02:59:55,410
So he's in the conversation and in the
middle of the conversation he's like,

3015
02:59:55,411 --> 02:59:59,010
I just flipped. Like they asked him
something uncomfortable. I'm jack now.

3016
02:59:59,040 --> 03:00:03,780
I just flipped like, oh, you're
fucking crazy. Oh, you're
crazy. You're crazy person.

3017
03:00:03,960 --> 03:00:08,010
You believe your male and female back
and forth like ping pong balls. Fuck you.

3018
03:00:08,930 --> 03:00:13,460
Okay. Fuck you for putting this on the
air. Fuck you for second. It's seriously,

3019
03:00:13,470 --> 03:00:17,310
God dammit. We have time. Jamie's just
tell we're out of time. Goddammit.

3020
03:00:17,630 --> 03:00:22,110
Podcast in all the fucking smash
three hours we did it again, sir.

3021
03:00:22,140 --> 03:00:26,640
Knocked it out of the park.
It tangentially speaking
is available on iTunes.

3022
03:00:26,670 --> 03:00:31,280
Uh, what's your website again? Chris
Ryan. Chris Ryan, Ph d. Dot com. Yeah.

3023
03:00:31,350 --> 03:00:33,750
Um,
