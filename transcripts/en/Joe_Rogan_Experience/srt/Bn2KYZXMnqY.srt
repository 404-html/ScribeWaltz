1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,680
Her low freak bitches and I attributed
it to cutting out refined sugars and

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:06,690
refined carbohydrates.

3
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:07,320
I think,

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,460
I think that stuff's poison,

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,700
but there's been studies showing it also
affects your brain and negative way as

6
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:11,971
well.

7
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,890
And people that eat refined sugar,

8
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:14,350
you know,

9
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:14,640
there's,

10
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,840
there's more brain atrophy.

11
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:17,130
I mean there's lots of correlations.

12
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,230
The one thing I will say is that,

13
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:19,950
you know,

14
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,340
there are people that are super physically
active and they're like working out

15
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,870
two hours a day and you know,

16
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:25,704
those guys,

17
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,130
they'll use refined sugar yeah.

18
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:29,411
To,

19
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:29,670
you know,

20
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:29,941
their,

21
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:33,360
their increased transport
glucose transporter in their
muscles and you're using

22
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:36,180
it as an anabolic way to
like get bigger muscle.

23
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:38,730
And I know guys who do that
after they work out the candy.

24
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,410
Yeah.

25
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:39,680
And,

26
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,080
and it,

27
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,510
it's not like it's,

28
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:41,851
it's,

29
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:46,150
you can't compare like people that aren't
working out like two hours a day or

30
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,030
two to normal people as
Freeman sedentary people,

31
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:49,864
weight lifters.

32
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,200
Yeah.

33
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,080
Weightlifters he pulled it are
just ripping their body apart.

34
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:58,290
There's a lot of savages out there that
are doing crazy power lifting workouts

35
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:00,050
and benching and squatting.

36
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:02,970
And I know a lot of guys who
like to eat candy afterwards.

37
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,330
Right?

38
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:03,720
Yeah.

39
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:03,931
No,

40
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:04,171
it's,

41
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:05,004
it's certainly,

42
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:05,611
you know,

43
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:07,350
I think that those people,

44
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,543
you know,

45
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,260
they're,

46
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,930
they're not,

47
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,411
it's not,

48
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,730
it's not acting the same way.

49
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,850
It's radically different requirement that
their body needs in terms of glucose.

50
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,600
And,

51
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,171
and the thing is,

52
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:16,381
I mean,

53
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:16,831
still,

54
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:17,191
it's like,

55
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:19,560
the way I think about it is
it's not really nutrient dense.

56
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:19,741
You know,

57
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:20,574
I like to like,

58
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,090
I'm like,

59
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:21,361
well,

60
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:21,960
there's lots of,

61
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,793
there's a reason.

62
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:23,131
Yeah,

63
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:25,680
there's a reason why I like to like
take and if you want the sugar and then,

64
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:25,891
you know,

65
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:28,570
I wouldn't get an orange or an
apple or something like that,

66
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,750
you should probably the
better move than eating candy.

67
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,190
But I think they just want a ton of it.

68
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,270
And what is the,

69
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,920
what's the anabolic factor?

70
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:35,131
Look,

71
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:37,140
if you were going to eat
candy or something like that,

72
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:40,080
has a bunch of refined sugar
after like an intense workout.

73
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:41,880
What would be the antibiotic factor?

74
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:41,971
Well,

75
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:42,630
the glucose,

76
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,171
so the,

77
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:44,910
the workout causes,

78
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,420
um,

79
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,810
Glucose transporters that transport
glucose to like go through the roof.

80
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:52,200
And so you start the glucose from your
bloodstream gets like sucked into the

81
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:53,910
muscle and then in the muscle,

82
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,541
you know,

83
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:54,901
you're,

84
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:55,651
you're basically,

85
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:56,130
you can,

86
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,150
you can use that as,

87
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:57,391
as,

88
00:01:57,391 --> 00:01:58,020
as a way to,

89
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,410
to,

90
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,120
to have insulin and it can be anabolic,

91
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:00,420
right?

92
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,200
Where,

93
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,591
where,

94
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:03,060
whereas if you weren't doing that,

95
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:07,230
then the glucose in your bloodstream
and it can all sorts of small dense LDL

96
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:10,710
particles can start to form because the
inflammatory transformations that happen

97
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:11,544
and things like that.

98
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,300
Um,

99
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,390
that's at least my understanding
that's in combination of course with,

100
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:15,810
um,

101
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,051
I mean,

102
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:16,141
oh,

103
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:16,471
acids,

104
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:18,840
which are also important for the
growth of the protein and muscle.

105
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:21,180
But that's my understanding of it.

106
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,373
I think.

107
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,140
So like in general though,

108
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,890
if someone could cut one
thing out of their diet,

109
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,840
refined carbohydrates and refined
sugars would be a great way to go.

110
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,800
I think the one,

111
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,180
if you were to think about the one
easiest thing that you could do that would

112
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:40,770
have the biggest impact on your health,

113
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:41,901
and if we're talking,

114
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:42,734
if we're talking about,

115
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,720
we're not talking about someone who's
already Paleo or someone like you or I

116
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,820
were talking about like
standard American person.

117
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,540
Yes.

118
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,370
The one thing that they could do to have
the biggest impact on their health I

119
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:55,350
would say is to cut out refined sugar.

120
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,391
Like that's,

121
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:57,870
that's probably the biggest thing.

122
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,530
The easiest thing,

123
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,780
I mean I don't know how easy it is.

124
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:01,900
It,

125
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,141
you know,

126
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:03,120
it can be addicting.

127
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,210
Yeah.

128
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,830
And that's been shown dopamine levels,

129
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:06,220
you know,

130
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,450
can get activated.

131
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,140
Game B was basically proceeded from
the idea that what we live in is a game

132
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,030
theoretic landscape,

133
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,960
right.

134
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,890
That the winners in this game theoretic
landscape are individuals who have

135
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:23,380
figured out where there's a niche.

136
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,250
Some of them have figured out how to
engage in something called rent seeking,

137
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,430
which rent seeking basically means making
money without producing some without

138
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:34,240
producing value.

139
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,630
So there's a lot of stuff that goes on
in our economy that is not productive.

140
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:38,410
And good,

141
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,190
but nonetheless generates fortunes.

142
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,810
So that's rent seeking as opposed
to innovation or productivity.

143
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,090
You're talking about like
hedge fund type stuff,

144
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:47,320
moving money around.

145
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,161
Well,

146
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:53,161
I want to be a little careful about this
because it is quite possible for things

147
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:58,270
like hedge funds to actually
correct inefficiencies in
the economy in a way that

148
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,290
is productive.

149
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,130
That doesn't mean that that's
the average thing that,

150
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,740
so do things are you referring to?

151
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,370
Well,

152
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:03,671
I mean,

153
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:03,911
you know,

154
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:04,151
let's,

155
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:04,984
let's take the,

156
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,450
the ultimate example
that will make it clear.

157
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,050
A warlord is not responsible for,

158
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,183
um,

159
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,240
for building the road that they then
stand by the side of and extort money from

160
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,160
people who want to travel it.

161
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,670
A cable company may produce some benefit.

162
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:28,630
They obviously have infrastructure
that allows you to get content,

163
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:32,800
but what fraction of what you're paying
for is actually about them delivering a

164
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:35,920
service at some price and
making some reasonable profit.

165
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:39,670
And what fraction of it is about the fact
that they are an economic Goliath and

166
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:43,330
that you don't have enough choice to be
able to negotiate a decent price with

167
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:43,930
them?

168
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,040
So there's some fraction of what
they're producing that is productive,

169
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,790
but then there's a large amount of profit
there that isn't about productivity or

170
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,300
innovation.

171
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,990
It's about the fact that they own a
choke point and you can't get around it.

172
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,413
Um,

173
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,550
so we don't know what fraction of the
economy is a rent seeking and what

174
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,400
fraction of it is productive.

175
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,990
But there is,

176
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,530
especially if one is broad minded about
thinking about all the ways that one can

177
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:12,640
engage in rent seeking,

178
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,200
one can actually be destructive of value.

179
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,670
If you destroy future
wellbeing for our descendants,

180
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,710
it may look productive in the present,

181
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:25,030
but it isn't productive.

182
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,320
It's actually destructive.

183
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,210
So that's a kind of um,

184
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,460
rent seeking that we don't
even typically model.

185
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,323
But,

186
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,613
uh,

187
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,760
we're,

188
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,593
where are we headed?

189
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:35,891
So,

190
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:36,640
Oh yes.

191
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,110
So we live in a game theoretic
landscape that's both good and bad.

192
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,431
As you point out,

193
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:47,431
competition is a healthy
thing and competition in
markets produces a huge amount

194
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:50,164
of value.

195
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,240
So I hear people deriding capitalism and
I always want to make the same point to

196
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:55,481
them,

197
00:05:55,481 --> 00:06:00,481
which is you've got two things glued
together and you are challenging them as a

198
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:03,260
package,

199
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,780
but there's no reason
they have to be packaged.

200
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,360
So we would be foolish to give up markets.

201
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,930
Markets are amazingly powerful
engines of innovation.

202
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:16,400
They are capable of solving problems
that we cannot solve deliberately,

203
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,690
even if we want it to.

204
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,280
So we need markets,

205
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,410
but we don't want markets ruling the
planet and deciding that anything that

206
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:28,610
spits out a profit is therefore good and
that we should be exposed to whatever

207
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:31,670
the market discovers can be a viable.

208
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,020
So what we want is ultimately to provide,

209
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,483
um,

210
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,350
provide incentive structures that cause
the market to produce things that are

211
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:43,184
good for us,

212
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,480
right?

213
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:44,871
In other words,

214
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,380
if you tell the market that you
want the solution to some problem,

215
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,250
the market can figure out how to solve
that problem and it will do it very well.

216
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,390
But if you allow the market to
decide what problems to solve,

217
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,440
it may end up,

218
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,280
for example,

219
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,230
addicting you to your phone,

220
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,580
right addicting to you.

221
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,070
To your phone in a way that
harms your social relationships,

222
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:04,760
harms your,

223
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,260
your parenting of your children,

224
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,600
harms all kinds of things
that are really important,

225
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:13,310
breaks the ability of your children to
have a educational experience in school.

226
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,540
We don't want the market discovering
how to disrupt useful functioning of

227
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:17,930
people.

228
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,640
We want the market to stay out of that
stuff and then to provide us benefits

229
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,390
that,

230
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:23,900
uh,

231
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,860
only it can provide,

232
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:29,861
like all of the mechanisms that now
allow us to navigate seamlessly in places

233
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:35,870
that we've never been avoiding traffic
that we wouldn't know to worry about.

234
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,351
Right?

235
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:41,351
Those are huge benefits and
they're capable of taking
a city that is to snarled

236
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:45,050
with traffic and reducing the degree
to which it is snarled with traffic.

237
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:46,040
So they're very powerful,

238
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,870
but we shouldn't,

239
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,660
we shouldn't throw the
baby out with the bath.

240
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:51,320
Water markets are good.

241
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,350
Allowing markets to
discover any and every,

242
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,250
uh,

243
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,910
mechanism for exploiting
you is not good at all.

244
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,511
And in fact,

245
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:02,900
it's a large part of why we're
in the predicament that we're in,

246
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:06,950
is that we let the market
decide what problems to solve.

247
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:16,700
Okay.
