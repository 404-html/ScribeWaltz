1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,740
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,150
John Fraser was a motherfucker.

3
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:04,820
How sad wasn't we used to go to Philly.

4
00:00:04,821 --> 00:00:07,750
Lisa drive passage gym on the
way from the airport that nae,

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,420
but he lived at his gym before he died.

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,510
Yeah,

7
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,180
he went broke in the end.

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:12,900
Look,

9
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,270
the amount of money that
these guys make for the time,

10
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:15,571
look,

11
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:18,720
they're talking to my $5 million persons
for Ali informant for the time you have

12
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:19,860
$5 million back then.

13
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:21,240
That is a lot of goddamn money.

14
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,313
But guess what?

15
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,420
You live like you've got $5 million.

16
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,450
So you're buying fucking Cadillacs and
paying for this and paying for that meals

17
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:31,830
here and jets there and
next thing you know,

18
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,580
$5 million doesn't even make it to the
80s and you know the brothers are showing

19
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:36,420
up at the door though.

20
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,660
My last motherfucking cousin.

21
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,653
Yeah,

22
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,291
listen man,

23
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,410
we got to venture and this
mother fucker can't go wrong.

24
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,303
Bottom shot.

25
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,150
White neighborhood first year going
to make 30% of your investments.

26
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:48,990
Second year,

27
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:50,300
60% on Yelp.

28
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,183
That's Matt.

29
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,520
And it just hit you
with some crazy speech.

30
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,320
How many of those do you
ever had to deal with?

31
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,843
Three.

32
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:57,931
Oh,

33
00:00:57,931 --> 00:00:58,980
you got them all the time.

34
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,330
I had to deal with one recently.

35
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,353
Movies,

36
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,980
TV shows you get them constantly ear
beatings to isn't I even come this man,

37
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:08,760
I'm not a movie producer.

38
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:09,750
All you have to do

39
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,860
is give us a check and we'll do it.

40
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,280
Oh,

41
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,780
she don't have to do anything
you don't have to worry about.

42
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,331
Yes I do.

43
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:16,164
I have to worry about it.

44
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:16,771
No,

45
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:16,881
no,

46
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:17,070
no.

47
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,903
You don't have to worry about it.

48
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,151
No,

49
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:18,361
no.

50
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:19,290
I do have to worry about it.

51
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:19,951
If I give you money,

52
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:20,784
I'm gonna worry about it.

53
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,260
Get out of here where your crazy idea.

54
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,640
This is the reason why they have banks.

55
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,330
Okay,

56
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,163
go to the bank.

57
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,850
If you have a really good
idea and you have credit,

58
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,661
go to the fucking bank.

59
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:28,494
If you don't have credit,

60
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,980
I got to assume somewhere along the line
you've already made some poor fucking

61
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,700
choices.

62
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,750
I don't want to be involved in that.

63
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,251
People have this,

64
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:36,990
everybody has this idea that they,

65
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:41,220
they're gonna figure out how to
circumvent this time honored system of

66
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:41,671
Hollywood.

67
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:43,320
And we're going to get to Joe Diaz.

68
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,710
If I can get to Cho Diaz.

69
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,620
I know Jody has been
killing it on the road.

70
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,250
If he can give me just $2,000
and I could start this film.

71
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,710
You know Quentin Tarantino does it.

72
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:51,960
Burn,

73
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,210
ran,

74
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:52,450
ran,

75
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:52,770
ran.

76
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,890
Kevin Smith made clerks and man,

77
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:55,191
man,

78
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:55,690
man.

79
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,740
And they just think that all they
need is a couple grand from Joey Diaz.

80
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,190
Joe,

81
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,461
Joe,

82
00:01:59,461 --> 00:01:59,731
Joe,

83
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,270
Joe.

84
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,103
You can't go wrong.

85
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:01,561
Okay.

86
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:02,394
Nobody makes movies.

87
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,210
Okay.

88
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:03,930
Join.

89
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,763
They just don't want me in.

90
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,050
They don't want me and Joey take,

91
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:10,110
don't want me and Joey as they
want to keep me on the outside.

92
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:10,821
Well,

93
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:11,850
you get them for your time.

94
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:13,230
It's not even that you get them for money.

95
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:14,400
It's you get them for your time.

96
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:14,850
Yeah.

97
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,320
Look at you with you're
living through you.

98
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:16,970
You're busy.

99
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,400
Yeah,

100
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,970
you're swamp.

101
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,090
There's no more.

102
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,240
I keep telling people that
and they get mad at me.

103
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,660
No,

104
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,381
they don't understand.

105
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:23,131
When you have children,

106
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:23,911
there's no schedule.

107
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:28,020
I can't count on my schedule at 10 20
she wouldn't get off my fucking lap

108
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,370
watching one,

109
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:29,701
two,

110
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:33,720
three videos on youtube at 10
30 I went to pick her up like,

111
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:34,960
let's go with what?

112
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,770
Yeah,

113
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,600
what will you fucking talking about?

114
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,110
Like I'll be back in a
couple of hours talking.

115
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,570
You don't have no fucking
idea what it is to,

116
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,490
and I went to get to go into the
room at nine 30 I get out of it.

117
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,570
I was going to get out of early.

118
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,550
That little bitch open the gate,

119
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,483
Doug.

120
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,890
I heard those stomping and like this.

121
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:53,621
There's no arguing,

122
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:54,770
but she just puts her hands up.

123
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,951
Got To pick her up,

124
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:57,100
got to put youtube on.

125
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,890
I got to sit there with a one,

126
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,201
two,

127
00:02:59,201 --> 00:02:59,591
three,

128
00:02:59,591 --> 00:02:59,891
four,

129
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:01,260
five you know,

130
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,140
and then she again,

131
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:02,501
Daddy.

132
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,160
Okay,

133
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,670
well the the problem people asking you
to do things too is that you kind of do

134
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:07,720
this shit for yourself.

135
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,051
Okay?

136
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:13,051
The way to do it is not to go through
other people and ask people to pick you up

137
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:13,954
and help you.

138
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,250
That's not how it works.

139
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,300
It doesn't work that way.

140
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,051
And pay.

141
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:20,110
Everybody thinks they're gonna figure out
some fucking choke shortcut cause they

142
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:23,230
know you or they know
this guy or that guy this.

143
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,210
There's no shortcuts
in creating something.

144
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,890
Just figure it out.

145
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,610
Bitch.

146
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,300
I love stand up because
there's one part of me,

147
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,850
it doesn't need anybody on these.

148
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,420
A notebook right here.

149
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:37,760
This is my tools for stand
up at a person will go,

150
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:41,900
go to Bob's fucking coffee house on
North Hollywood and do three minutes.

151
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,270
You know me,

152
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,140
I don't give a fuck.

153
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:44,950
When you,

154
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,250
we talked about having a band that
somebody came on hand and said that it was

155
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:51,130
the toughest thing in the world
for a band to stay together.

156
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,930
You got four people personalities.

157
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:56,080
You know you get these people that come
to you now and I was breaking it down

158
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:56,650
from another planet.

159
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,011
They don't say,

160
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:57,461
hey Joe,

161
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:58,270
how you doing?

162
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,820
My name is this.

163
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,100
Read my script for you.

164
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:00,491
Like it.

165
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:00,760
Yeah,

166
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,500
we're going to get $8
million and then you go,

167
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:02,801
okay,

168
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:03,341
when you get it,

169
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:03,760
call me.

170
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,810
I really liked the script.

171
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,010
Something you're interested in,

172
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,400
whatever,

173
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,233
three days,

174
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,280
all of a sudden you do get a
call on the yield and they say,

175
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:09,820
hey,

176
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,780
we're making a movie,

177
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,070
but guess what?

178
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,720
We didn't get $2 million.

179
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:17,260
We've got $200,000 so instead
of you getting 10,000 a week,

180
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:19,930
you're going to get a hundred a
day and that's going to be a hit.

181
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:20,830
We're going to make it happen.

182
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:24,550
Nine out of 10 they run out of money
for marketing and editing and the whole

183
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:25,031
fucking thing.

184
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,560
So your movie ends up in Youtube.

185
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,660
They don't have a legit schedule.

186
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,970
So you have to work Saturdays
and fucking Sundays.

187
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,090
You know those people that are
involved in those low rent movies,

188
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,060
they're a fucking nightmare
and it's their dream.

189
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:37,601
And I get,

190
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:38,434
it's your dream,

191
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,960
but don't include me in this fucking
thing because you want me to do everything

192
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,110
cheap on my end,

193
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:45,040
all the hours.

194
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,570
And it's your fucking dream.

195
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,000
If it's that much of your dream,

196
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:48,720
and do me a favor,

197
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,780
forget the 200 gs.

198
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,960
We got another 300 gs and
make this fucking work.

199
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,171
Well,

200
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:53,711
not only that,

201
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,110
you can find other actors out
there that will do it for cheap.

202
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,780
There's people that are out there that
just want to act sort of like a comic

203
00:04:58,781 --> 00:04:59,980
would go to an open mic night.

204
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,550
There's certain actors that just want
to do something to put it on a real go

205
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:04,001
find them.

206
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:07,150
There's a lot of talented people out there
that are not working as far as acting

207
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:07,870
goes,

208
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,850
there's a lot of fucking
people that can do it.

209
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,300
There's a lot of times people,

210
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,513
it's just the,

211
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,900
I just have a problem with people
like asking you to help them do it.

212
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:18,730
Like I get it from
comics all the time too.

213
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,810
Just looking for a break.

214
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,740
What are you talking about
and you're saying you're not,

215
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,860
you're not going to get a
break from another comic.

216
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,350
The way you get breaks is by
going on stage and being funny.

217
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,580
Like go to an open mic night.

218
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:27,941
Be Funny.

219
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:28,541
The club will say,

220
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,710
Hey Joey Diaz,

221
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:30,550
your fucking funny.

222
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,020
We would like you to come here more often.

223
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:33,190
The audience really enjoyed you.

224
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,091
Next thing you know,

225
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:34,930
some manager says,

226
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:35,231
you know what,

227
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:36,010
Joey Diaz,

228
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,880
you're really funny.

229
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,891
We would like to,

230
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:38,230
uh,

231
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,570
think about taking you on as a
client and that's how it works.

232
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,820
Like a comic coming along.

233
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:42,880
It's not going to make you funnier.

234
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,070
And then the people that do that,

235
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:48,280
they always have a distorted perception
of how good they are already.

236
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,061
You know,

237
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:49,331
those,

238
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:51,160
those kids that are asking for a break,

239
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,570
the kids that want you to help him,

240
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:52,931
hey man,

241
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:53,591
I just need a break.

242
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:54,890
If I could do a guest set for you,

243
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:55,451
it really helped me.

244
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:57,010
Like that's not you don't,

245
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,600
you don't go to the Doug Stan hope
show and asked for a fucking guests.

246
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,141
All our Doug,

247
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:02,310
we'll probably put you up Doug about it.

248
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,173
Alright,

249
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,510
do 15 starting to go up front.

250
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,530
Doug will push a and open micro
on his first time on stage.

251
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,050
He'll do that in front of a
crowd in Norway or something.

252
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,180
But that Stan Hope,

253
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,091
you know,

254
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:14,630
uh,

255
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,463
it's not normal.

256
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,950
You have to do you,

257
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,650
it's amazing what people,

258
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,390
you know,

259
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,380
we weren't like that.

260
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,980
Thank God we knew that
this took work at hot.

261
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,440
We knew that this wasn't
going to happen in one night.

262
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,360
I was old enough already when I started.

263
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:32,700
I was long in the tooth already
that I knew this was just not gonna.

264
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,021
You know,

265
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:36,530
you just didn't walk on stage and things
happen and people come here and they

266
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:38,750
called desperadoes where they just do,

267
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,090
don't come up to you for a
guest and you got to ask them,

268
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:42,140
what is this going to do for you?

269
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,740
Right?

270
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,390
How's this going to
fucking change your life?

271
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,940
It's like I've never been
too much of a hanger on it.

272
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,230
I don't believe in that.

273
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,880
I never believed in that shit.

274
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,631
You know?

275
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:52,600
I believe in doing the spot
if I go to the economy.

276
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:53,960
So it's cause I'm doing a fucking spot.

277
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,071
If I don't go to,

278
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:55,930
I don't go to the Improv.

279
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,350
My name isn't on that list.

280
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,490
The hangout,

281
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,271
there's no,

282
00:06:59,271 --> 00:06:59,661
for me,

283
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:00,130
there's no,

284
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:00,320
no,

285
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,800
no,

286
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,370
no,

287
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,090
no.

288
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,650
Because if you come up to Joe Rogan,

289
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:05,480
red band or Jamie and go,

290
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:06,314
Hi Jamie,

291
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,410
my name is Joey Diaz.

292
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,931
I'm a fucking,

293
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:08,241
I'm calm.

294
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:09,170
I'm a funny comic.

295
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,490
Jamie's going to say,

296
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,830
are you going up tonight
because we all want to watch it.

297
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,030
I love to laugh.

298
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:14,971
You're funny.

299
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:15,804
Let's go.

300
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,401
No,

301
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:17,330
I'm just here hanging out.

302
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,440
You hate that fucking funny.

303
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,210
If he's not on the list,

304
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:22,640
you ain't that fucking fun or
they don't know about you yet.

305
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,480
There's a possibility that there's
certain people that go to the Improv,

306
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,501
that's it,

307
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:28,071
and they'll tell you,

308
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:28,341
dog,

309
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,091
you've got a network.

310
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:29,661
What network?

311
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:30,710
Your network on stage.

312
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,830
I didn't have work on stage when
they laughed when I walk off.

313
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,693
That's networking.

314
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,661
Not only dad.

315
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:36,500
When you're a comic,

316
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,080
you're sort of like a
fruit or a vegetable.

317
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:39,581
In that year,

318
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:42,290
you're growing and then you get to one
day you going to be ripe and when you're

319
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:42,831
going to be ripe,

320
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:45,650
everyone's gonna know about it
and people find out about you.

321
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,480
If people found out about everybody,

322
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,890
they found out about you,

323
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:50,120
they found out about Hinchcliffe.

324
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:51,020
They find out about everybody.

325
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:51,920
You hear about Dunkin.

326
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,870
You wouldn't happen to know what's
happening in China right now.

327
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,853
What's happening in China?

328
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,270
I was packing them in.

329
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:56,990
Oh yeah.

330
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,561
Every night.

331
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:57,951
And he goes,

332
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,230
I can't believe there's
white people in UFC fans

333
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,050
coming from money out.

334
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:04,941
Okay?

335
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:05,960
They're not big rooms.

336
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:07,010
There were 120 seat,

337
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:07,921
a hundred seat.

338
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:08,990
This is like coffee shops,

339
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,883
right?

340
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,060
But where on the Internet,

341
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,380
this shit is worldwide.

342
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,233
It's worldwide.

343
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,540
He can't believe it.

344
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,360
That there's fucking people
walking around here going,

345
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,100
we came to see you from Macau.

346
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,140
I can't believe it took people
so long to figure it out.

347
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:22,190
Or he's a fucking genius.

348
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,090
He's a great comic.

349
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:23,391
It's,

350
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:23,780
uh,

351
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,780
it's just amazing that people have misled.

352
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,900
They think there's shortcuts.

353
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,270
When we got here,

354
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:30,200
what was the shortcut?

355
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,820
If you get on the tonight show,

356
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,713
right?

357
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,830
That's it.

358
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,380
How many people have gone to the
tonight show and not great success?

359
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,041
No one cares.

360
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,500
A lot of pee all now it doesn't.

361
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:38,900
No,

362
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,890
but back in the day it
meant something big.

363
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,810
You know,

364
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,770
Steven Wright days,

365
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,510
I could finally do a technical,

366
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:46,430
get up a Turkish get up.

367
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,851
No,

368
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:48,220
a technical get up in Jujitsu.

369
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,960
I could finally do it after a year
of practicing and hotel rooms.

370
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,660
Five a day I would do on my
right side of the family.

371
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:53,871
You know,

372
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:54,560
I'm a nut thug,

373
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:54,960
right?

374
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,521
You do know him.

375
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:58,410
Retarded half where people
know that I'm a little stupid.

376
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,280
I'm Geeky.

377
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,570
I don't like,

378
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,310
I don't like being bad at something.

379
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,340
And since we got the comedy work ethic,

380
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,370
I know that you could turn it anything
his wife into something if you just keep

381
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:11,570
showing up.

382
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,270
Yeah.

383
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,810
If you just,

384
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,550
you don't like the major Jitu has been,

385
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,750
I sucked Joe,

386
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,820
but I could finally do the whole
gym hip escape that fucking,

387
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,700
I'm a black belt.

388
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:23,130
The hip escapes to me today.

389
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,941
That's what I do.

390
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:25,170
I'm a hip escape expert.

391
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,400
That's what I work on.

392
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:27,040
You know?

393
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,873
Uh,

394
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,710
it's games a huge fuck.

395
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,890
And when you learn how to do
it for you or for six months,

396
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:35,190
I didn't know what I was doing and
it's Alami taught me sometimes all just

397
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,730
taught me a different and I put it all
together on my shoulder and now at least

398
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:41,790
I could pick up my ass and push
it all the way back for me.

399
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,780
Those are little things,

400
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:43,020
you know.

401
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,040
I wish I was better,

402
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,650
but I know if I keep going
to Jujitsu twice a week,

403
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,600
which is what my body can handle.

404
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,100
Eventually I'll get it somebody in an
arm bar eventually cause I got funny with

405
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:53,461
Combi.

406
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:56,280
I was no fucking just slip
Magoo in the beginning.

407
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,533
I just,

408
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,513
whatever.

409
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,910
I just kept showing up.

410
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,520
You've just got to keep
showing the fuck up.

411
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,503
That's half of life.

412
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,200
That's how a life and who gives a fuck.

413
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:05,580
I want,

414
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,930
I'm not looking for a black belt.

415
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,280
I'm not even looking to go to a beat.

416
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:09,114
Nobody up.

417
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,550
I'm just looking to go to
learn to a Turkish get up.

418
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,800
I could do with 10
pounds of Turkish get up.

419
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,960
I'm up to this point
where I put my arm down,

420
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:19,470
I put my knee up and I just go up to my
elbow and I go down and I do tell her

421
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,313
those bro Bop,

422
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,560
Bop,

423
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:21,810
bop.

424
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,491
I don't even go off,

425
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:23,820
but I've been doing it for eight months.

426
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:24,654
Got Kettlebells,

427
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,580
10 pounds Turkish get up bitch,

428
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,110
but I'm still doing it right.

429
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,240
What would happen if I
would took 35 pounds?

430
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,670
You know me dog.

431
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,580
I get it.

432
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,600
I wouldn't be here right now.

433
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:36,210
My shoulder would be
at my fucking hill so,

434
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:40,410
but at least I know this going in
because because of the lesson I got from

435
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:42,570
comedy that it don't matter though.

436
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,463
Just keep showing up.

437
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,100
Yeah,

438
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,450
but nobody last him dog.

439
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,123
Keep showing him.

440
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,020
Some people you tell them stay home.

441
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,970
Some people just don't want man.

442
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,860
For some people it's like me.

443
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,420
When we did comedy,

444
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,330
there was eight people who had a chance.

445
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,850
That was another six who were funny,

446
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:03,180
but they had day jobs because
they were married or had children.

447
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,010
Then you had two people did it as a hobby
that every once in a great while they

448
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:12,960
drove to a Gig and then you got three
people that just had mental health issues.

449
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:13,831
Yeah.

450
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:14,270
Okay.

451
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,680
He's always showed up every
week and they were nice enough,

452
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,270
but you knew there was something wrong
there and for them it was the way this is

453
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:21,661
for me,

454
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:22,494
what Jujitsu,

455
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,790
I'm not looking for them.

456
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,290
They're not looking to be on NBC.

457
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,320
All they want to do is
one time in their life.

458
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,250
Make somebody laugh.

459
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,230
How special is that?

460
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,410
It's huge.

461
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,570
And they'd go down there
and you miss those guys.

462
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:37,200
I miss those guys from my scenes and
see how even here and that way there's

463
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:40,920
people that you see them and they were
a pleasure to talk to because they don't

464
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:41,754
want an agent.

465
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,720
They don't want to be on
movies that just having fun.

466
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,620
They work at universal city
in the daytime as the hope,

467
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,360
you know?

468
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,310
It's very few of those that
I respect that man are,

469
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:55,841
they're very,

470
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:56,770
there's very few of those.

471
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,370
Most of those guys have dreams that
just never manifested themselves,

472
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,590
but a lot of them never material.

473
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,270
I met a lot of guys that bro,

474
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:05,560
they were proud of their job.

475
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,290
They just start somewhere and their life,

476
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,470
I take a be a standup and they just
didn't want to die without trying it.

477
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,160
Right.

478
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,760
And then they did it
and it become addicted.

479
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,890
How many people go to Jujitsu?

480
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:16,590
It becomes a daily standup.

481
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Definitely becomes addictive.

482
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,793
It becomes,

483
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,030
it becomes addicting and it's like
addicts where you see those guys are

484
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:22,841
scrambling outside.

485
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:25,570
The can't wait to get on stage
and like even guys who are bad,

486
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,320
they'll see a guy who's up there killing
like you be upset killing like man,

487
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:31,000
he's supposed to only be doing 15 minutes,

488
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,200
motherfuckers at 20 minutes.

489
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:33,550
Like what do you care?

490
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,540
What are you going to do?

491
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,310
You're going to go up after Joey Diaz,

492
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,940
what are you going to do?

493
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,740
You're an open miker and you're upset.

494
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,330
Like they think somehow or another they,

495
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,150
oh I'm on the non paid regulus but
you're not getting up until two in the

496
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:43,570
morning.

497
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,560
You know how it works.

498
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,513
This is what you do.

499
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,450
You're on a non paid,

500
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,590
I was a non paid regular.

501
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,060
You get up after everybody else.

502
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:49,690
That's what you do.

503
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,390
If there's anybody fucking crazy
is that people should know this.

504
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:53,224
You want to,

505
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,950
you were on a TV show and
you will not pay regular,

506
00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:58,720
which by law if you on a TV show,

507
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:00,280
you're allowed to go in
there and bump bitches.

508
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,871
Give him the bell.

509
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:02,380
You know what I'm saying?

510
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:02,471
Well,

511
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:03,071
not only that,

512
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:04,030
I showed up every night,

513
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,450
every night I was there every night.

514
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,380
Biggest lesson I learned about
this whole thing from you.

515
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,180
It was newsradio on Fridays.

516
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:11,320
You got there at 11 in the morning,

517
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:12,154
wardrobe,

518
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,210
stupidity,

519
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,133
laughter,

520
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,801
food,

521
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:16,060
and then at eight o'clock you shoot,

522
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,790
you'd be strolling in there
with fucking 1130 bro.

523
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,430
I respect you for that.

524
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:23,440
So this day that meant more
to me and you didn't need it.

525
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,530
And it's $15 it's not
like you had 19 kids.

526
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:28,180
He needed the 15 fucking dollars.

527
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,330
But I'll tell you the truth
being passed as a paid regular,

528
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:33,010
the comic store meant more to me.

529
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,220
Getting on a TV show up.

530
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,020
Me Too.

531
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,010
When I was on a TV show,

532
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:36,910
when I was on news radio,

533
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,010
one of the things I love
about you coming to visit me,

534
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,461
I was like,

535
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:39,911
finally,

536
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:40,930
there's another motherfucker.

537
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,780
It doesn't belong here because I was,

538
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,360
I was always wondering around like one
day they're going to tell me to get the

539
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:47,194
fuck off TB,

540
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,400
but until now,

541
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,151
somehow or another,

542
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:49,721
I'm on TV.

543
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:50,830
So Joey would show up at black.

544
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,330
Come here man.

545
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:52,661
Hey,

546
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:52,961
come here.

547
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:53,950
Let me show you what this is.

548
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:54,910
This is where they keep the food

549
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,480
wander around the set.

550
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,930
Joey would show up at the
set and Joey will be sitting.

551
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,030
They had an executives,

552
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,520
a VIP suite,

553
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,840
and the VIP suite.

554
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:08,350
They had shrimp cocktails
and delicious hors d'oeuvres,

555
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:09,810
and they had it catered.

556
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,020
A dude who,

557
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,381
you know,

558
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:15,310
had like one of those Mumford and
sons fucking facial hair things with a

559
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:16,390
beautiful tie,

560
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,810
a thin,

561
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,470
skinny tie.

562
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,970
He'd be like serving people shit.

563
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,750
And it would be all these NBC executives
and Joey fucking Diaz with a leather

564
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:23,111
jacket,

565
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:24,250
which stroll in and,

566
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,570
and feast.

567
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,810
He'd be sitting there with a fucking
paper plate with like 15 shrimp,

568
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:29,270
silent,

569
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,130
all my God.

570
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,530
Is that your friend?

571
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:42,720
Yeah.
