1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,170
Too Fun and we're live.
Mr.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,140
West.
Mr Mr Brogan,

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,460
have pleasure to have you here in 
person.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,130
Doing it on skype was fun and it was 
nice.

5
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:11,964
And you are to this day,
the only podcast I've ever done on 

6
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:15,210
skype.
Really?

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,410
Yup.
Yeah.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,433
But I just had to talk to you.
There's like if you couldn't get down 

9
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:21,390
here,
there's gotta be a way.

10
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:23,400
So it was nice to be able to do it that 
way,

11
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:24,234
but much nicer to see here in person.
And let's better to be here in person 

12
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:28,344
and actually what responsible if it 
would be being here in person is that I 

13
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:32,964
wouldn't actually come all this huge 
distance even to be on your show unless 

14
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:41,310
you paid me lots of money.
Of course we did not prepare to do but,

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,713
but because I have this conference 
coming up at the end of the week called 

16
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:48,210
Seapak,
which I'm surprised you didn't know that

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,240
conference on precession and ancient 
knowledge,

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,563
uh,
which is the end of this week for those 

19
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:55,970
living in southern California.

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,790
Might want to,
uh,

21
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,240
take,
uh,

22
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,710
take,
I'll take a look at the word sell it.

23
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:01,350
Tell everybody where,
where's that and what is it about?

24
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,620
It's Rancho Mirage,
which is a great name and means there is

25
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:07,670
no ranch but um,
Ron Tomo hires,

26
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,523
which is somewhere near palm springs and
it is about exactly what it says 

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,973
conference on precession and ancient 
knowledge and did it questions to begin 

28
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:20,940
with the whole.
Um,

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,790
so I say the whole,
the whole scenario,

30
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,640
the standards scenario of that,
what causes procession,

31
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,170
which is supposedly a kind of a wobble 
of the earth caused by,

32
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,004
nobody knows exactly what and the 
counter theory is that it isn't that 

33
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:40,890
it's that there is a dwarf star of some 
sort orbiting the sun,

34
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,870
upsetting the balance of the celestial 
mechanical balance of it.

35
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,400
And that makes a difference.
You say,

36
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:49,020
well what's the difference one way or 
another?

37
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,020
There's procession.
It doesn't make a difference actually in

38
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:57,021
the big picture because it means that 
our solar system basically conforms with

39
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,010
all of the other solar systems,
which mostly are dual in nature.

40
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:03,210
A serious,
for example,

41
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:05,780
as the Dwarf Star that circled around 
it,

42
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:06,614
series b,
that's responsible for all sorts of 

43
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,930
measurable phenomena.
So it starts off from there,

44
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:13,764
but then the ancient knowledge comes in 
because precession and this is a big 

45
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,804
mystery.
Precession seems to be a factor of 

46
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,630
virtually every ancient society be it 
sophisticated.

47
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,090
I'll let China and India,
South America,

48
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,950
Mesoamerica or so called primitive a 
word I hate to use.

49
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:35,784
It simply means an intellectual lies or 
not expressed in coherent western 

50
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:45,120
philosophy for whatever that's worth.
The the um,

51
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,140
but er procession is,
is a known fact,

52
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,293
um,
discovered actually long time ago you'd 

53
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:53,064
think by now it would be common 
knowledge and everybody would teach it 

54
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:56,580
in school,
which is a sort of a joke.

55
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,620
I'm interesting to people don't teach 
it.

56
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,460
Right.
It is a very bizarre

57
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,280
thing that it's,
it's so prominent in ancient cultures,

58
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:07,390
in ancient society that they literally 
map this out,

59
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:09,100
this 26,000
year cycle.

60
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:10,150
It's wobble of the earth

61
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,910
and that we rarely talk about it ever.
No,

62
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:14,744
because it upsets the notion that 
there's a knowledge of this going back 

63
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:18,794
to ancient times presupposes that 
there's a very advanced observational 

64
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,913
astronomy dating at a time when 
supposedly people were still living in 

65
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:30,230
trees.
So this is actually a big deal.

66
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,333
Hence the conference on precession and 
the ancient knowledge comes into it 

67
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,233
because understanding that there is a 
highly sophisticated scientific 

68
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,193
understanding that goes back not just to
ancient Egypt itself but far thousands 

69
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:49,994
and thousand millennia beyond upsets 
what is effectively the reigning 

70
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,500
religion of today except that doesn't 
call itself a religion.

71
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,460
It calls itself science which is based 
supposedly on reason.

72
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,530
It's dot.
None of those things are true.

73
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:06,590
It's not based on science and science is
not based upon reason.

74
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,700
Maybe we'll get it,

75
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,533
well some sciences,
but archeology in particular is very 

76
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:11,954
rigid and its ideas and a lot of it is 
based on the professors that have 

77
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:17,960
written books and that teach these ideas
and they don't want to let them go.

78
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,530
And when noon knowledge is discovered 
that challenges those ideas,

79
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:22,364
they fight it rigorously even if it's 
knowledge like the stuff that you 

80
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:28,460
exposed with doctor Ron Shock,
Robert Schoch rather,

81
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,550
which was the water erosion on the 
Sphinx,

82
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,010
which we were talking about before the 
podcast is,

83
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:37,940
which is one of the best pieces of 
evidence because the last time there was

84
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:40,340
rainfall heavy rainfall in the Nile 
Valley was,

85
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,510
what was it,
9,000

86
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:42,380
vcs that what it was.

87
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,230
They debate it,
but it's anyway,

88
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:48,670
it's way before the beginning of 
dynastic Egypt.

89
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,360
And then it's a question of how,
how have,

90
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,203
how old are when those rains fell 
because it's big bit of that of thing 

91
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:01,171
here that I'm now at liberty to um,
to relate publicly.

92
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:05,440
Originally,
I wasn't when I first got chocolate,

93
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:06,274
where do Egypt,
which is another two hour podcast in 

94
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:09,874
itself.
The history of getting shock interested 

95
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:12,514
in this stuff.
And when he finally agreed very 

96
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:19,090
hesitantly and very skeptically to come 
along because he had to see the evidence

97
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:19,924
for my s for himself and I scraped 
together a bit of money to bring them 

98
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:25,270
over and we got into the swings and 
closure.

99
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:27,130
I don't think it was luke got in 
legally.

100
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:30,070
I think we bribed our way and very early
in the morning,

101
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:30,963
well and Egypt,
everything is possible and bribed our 

102
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:34,450
way in.

103
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,310
And he walked into the swinks and 
closure.

104
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,500
Actually when we get that up on the 
screen,

105
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,390
you'll see the,
you'll see the,

106
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:41,840
the,
the,

107
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,673
the level of the water,
the extent of the weathering of the 

108
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:46,264
water,
weathering and chalk looked at it and 

109
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:52,771
everybody else walks into the sinks and 
closure and has this actually this shock

110
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,180
of recognition of the presence of this 
fabulous work of,

111
00:05:57,181 --> 00:05:58,014
of sacred art,
sculpture in fact of sacred sculpture 

112
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,270
and chocolate with chocolate is a,
as a,

113
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,560
uh,
no,

114
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:08,210
that's not,
it was to go way back to Tammy,

115
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,120
right to the beginning,
first slides and shock.

116
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,110
Everybody else sees the spanx as a work 
of art.

117
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,273
Shock sees the rocks and he's a 
geologist and he back like this and he 

118
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:23,180
said,
Oh wow,

119
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,300
these rocks look like they're hundreds 
of thousands of years old.

120
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,690
And he said,
don't quote me on that because that's of

121
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:30,524
course absolute heresy that the most 
spectacular sculpture on earth should 

122
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:34,394
be.

123
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,590
I mean,
tens of thousands of years actually,

124
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,250
even th th th the 4,500
years that are,

125
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,233
that it's associated with do not conform
with anybody's idea of how civilization 

126
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,500
developed.
This goes back to your,

127
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,110
of why the,
the academic,

128
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:56,111
I call it the academic establishment is 
so is so passionately,

129
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,470
um,
defends the old paradigm the way that it

130
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:07,940
does because of the reigning paradigm,
the trainings religion today,

131
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:10,340
which is not acknowledged,
that has religion,

132
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,803
is that this is,
this is the Church of progress and its 

133
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:17,240
credo just like the virgin birth is the 
Credo of,

134
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:20,180
of early Christianity or a present day 
Christianity.

135
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:21,710
Not that they know what they're talking 
about.

136
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,880
Um,
the,

137
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,370
the,
the,

138
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,820
the Credo of the Church of progress is 
a,

139
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:29,654
we are the most sophisticated human 
beings that have ever lived on the face 

140
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:33,794
of the planet with our hydrogen bombs 
and our nerve gas in our stripe 

141
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:39,500
toothpaste and our Disneyland's were the
best that ever was.

142
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,630
And secondly,
that progress as it's called,

143
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,500
goes in a straight line from primitive 
caveman up to ourselves.

144
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,550
And when it becomes self evident that in
very,

145
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:57,551
very ancient times they had knowledge of
precession,

146
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:02,891
which is an incredible thing to it.
It's almost unimaginable that it happens

147
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:08,951
through careful observation because the 
sun,

148
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,270
I don't know if all of the audience will
know what what this is.

149
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:15,500
So maybe it's worth talking about the 
sun.

150
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,480
If you look at the spring equinox now,
it's in the last,

151
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,360
the sun is rising against the last,
um,

152
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,830
the last bits of,
um,

153
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,090
of,
of,

154
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:27,740
um,
of Pisces.

155
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,574
It may even be in the earliest stages of
Aquarius and the gradually the Sun 

156
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,873
precesses that's to say it goes 
backwards around the Zodiac in a cycle 

157
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:42,560
that takes 25,000
canonically 25,000,

158
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:43,394
920 years to make a complete circle.
What this means is that it actually 

159
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:53,141
takes 72 years precisely for the sun to 
precess one degree.

160
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,003
So this is nothing who's going to be 
sitting there for 72 years watching the 

161
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:00,670
track of the sun in a,
in a,

162
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,603
in a cycle that takes 26,000
years to go around and observe that 

163
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,730
there's a discrepancy and then pass that
information down.

164
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,623
And then why should they care somehow or
another deeply connected with the 

165
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:17,190
civilization of that time and with our 
civilization.

166
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,423
When you look at the numbers involved,
this is another hours of conversation 

167
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,170
accurately.
The 72 in the 73 are significant numbers

168
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:31,530
in practically all of the developed 
numerologically based society.

169
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:35,250
So in Egypt set,
who's the bad guy?

170
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,090
Derivative?
Probably Satan is derived from set.

171
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,610
He's the bad guy,
but he's also a great God.

172
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:45,180
That is to say the gods are not gods in 
any superstitious fashion.

173
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,810
They represented the embodiments of 
cosmic principles,

174
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,213
so excuse me,
set is he who fixes spirit and matter 

175
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,213
and the whole basis of an esoteric of 
any esoteric doctrine including most of 

176
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:04,050
the religions that are around even today
and they're deprived forms.

177
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,603
The objective of any esoteric discipline
is to free ourselves individually and 

178
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:13,710
collectively for imprisonment and 
matter.

179
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,793
This is the question.
We're in mortality and so in some sense 

180
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:20,574
or another that processional cycle is 
very important than the numbers are 

181
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:26,460
important in the myth,
which again,

182
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:28,480
we don't have time for,
but Ozar,

183
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:31,140
iris is the good king.
Actually.

184
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:33,690
This is all very carefully,
uh,

185
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,000
expounded very brilliantly.
In fact,

186
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,373
in the hamlet myth,
it's become Shakespeare's hamlet and 

187
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:44,280
then in the lion king and Disney's lion 
king and the movies especially,

188
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,353
which is really pretty brilliant anyway,
set as the good king who is beloved by 

189
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:50,604
his people and set his,
his wicked brother is evil brother who 

190
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,670
was determined to unseat him than steal 
his sister wife Isis while he's at it.

191
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,103
Anyway,
sets,

192
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,060
sets a trap for Ozar Harris and it's,
it's set and it's 72 followers.

193
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,493
So 72 is this number associated with the
time and the 72 to 73 is a very 

194
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:17,601
significant ratio actually,
which pervades the philosophies of,

195
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,900
as I said,
of all of the esoteric civilizations.

196
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,930
So all of this stuff,
instead of all of this,

197
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:29,931
instead of being the kind of ask a quack
academic,

198
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:32,700
the same guy you were talking about 
earlier,

199
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:34,860
it still thinks the six is weathered by 
sand.

200
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,850
Ask One of those,
what ancient myth is about and they say,

201
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,693
oh,
well it's just a fabrication written by 

202
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:44,520
primitive people who are trying to 
explain the mysteries of the universe.

203
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,503
It's the other way around.
The perimeter of people are the ones 

204
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:47,514
with the phds.
And back then they not only did they 

205
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:54,190
understand these scientific,
these astronomical,

206
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,133
these astronomical facts,
but they orchestrated their whole 

207
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,640
civilization around those facts.
And the more,

208
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,940
the deeper you get into this,
the more miraculous,

209
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,830
um,
the,

210
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,950
the extent of ancient knowledge becomes 
the,

211
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:14,260
what is the mainstream explanation when 
they,

212
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:17,440
when they talk about the prevalence of 
the number 72 and their understanding of

213
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:19,780
the procession of the equinoxes,
do they address it at all?

214
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,614
Like how do they,
how do they sort of explain how they 

215
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:25,570
knew about this 26,000
year cycle?

216
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,210
I was at a very quick answer to that 
actually.

217
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:29,380
For a change.
No,

218
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,400
they just explained it's just ignore.
He's,

219
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,810
it's sorta like the Parthenon,
the Acropolis,

220
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,853
you know,
which one is the Acropolis is the 

221
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:38,290
building and the Parthenon is a 
structure,

222
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,700
right?
Is that what it is?

223
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,010
No breeze.
Both their temples about the buildings,

224
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,880
but what does the,
uh,

225
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,713
what's the,
the,

226
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,553
the base,
the base is the one that they don't 

227
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:46,720
explain,
right?

228
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,760
They just go,
well,

229
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:49,810
we don't really,
exactly.

230
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,960
That's the gigantic,
enormous base,

231
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,290
the huge stones that the Acropolis is 
built on.

232
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,230
Right.
Because don't goes up.

233
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,420
Acropolis is the one on top.
Right.

234
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,283
Okay.
See the Parthenon is what they're built 

235
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:06,370
on this,
the base structure where whatever it is,

236
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:06,830
the,
the,

237
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,910
the bottom area.
I don't know,

238
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,863
actually,
I've never really looked that deeply 

239
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:13,870
into it.
Other than that,

240
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:14,704
there's a friend of mine who's worked 
with the proportions and the 

241
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,520
sophisticated proportions of the 
Parthenon,

242
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:26,521
and it shows actually that it's as,
as my noodly orchestrated as anything in

243
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:30,850
Egypt,
even though it's much better than Egypt,

244
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,880
but much later than Egypt.
But no one knows who built it and no one

245
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:34,714
knows why they built it.
It's one of those weird ones where it's 

246
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:40,120
not really described and the tax and the
Acropolis is built upon it.

247
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,591
Um,
he said,

248
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:43,660
some explained to me by,
by Greek historians,

249
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:44,494
by people understand Greek history.
They just really don't understand where 

250
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:48,240
it came from.
Well,

251
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,113
I believe that's true,
except that I think it's pretty certain 

252
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:54,310
that it's not,
it's not of Egyptian age,

253
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,144
although if you're talking about 
gigantic paving stones at the bottom of 

254
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,680
it is that,
I don't know.

255
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,650
But whenever you see those gigantic 
stones,

256
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:06,970
that's a pretty good indication of an 
earlier period of construction.

257
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,223
As at Baalbek,
they have these monolithic 1200 ton 

258
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,060
blocks that they think the Romans put 
in.

259
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:16,240
And that's in Lebanon,
right?

260
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,260
That's Lebanon.
Yeah.

261
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:22,261
So there's a ton of this,
of this kind of indirect evidence.

262
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:25,600
And when you put it all together,
you get,

263
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,930
there's enough of a picture there so 
that it overthrows the basis.

264
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,943
I said,
what's important about it is up one 

265
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:34,084
sentence.
Who Cares?

266
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,193
In another sense,
it overthrows the suppose scientific 

267
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:43,240
basis of the Church of progress that 
we're the most sophisticated people that

268
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:44,074
have aware and we can do whatever we 
pleased with this once glorious planet 

269
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:50,710
of ours without worrying about it 
because we're the best in everyone.

270
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:51,880
Before us was primitive.

271
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,833
Well,
there's a lot of new evidence now since 

272
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:56,530
you started your work.
Um,

273
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,393
particularly all that nuclear glass that
they're finding that corresponds with 

274
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:01,504
meteor impacts throughout Europe and 
Asia and that that's somewhere around 

275
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:05,554
the end of the ice age really in the 
same sort of a time period when they do 

276
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:12,010
core samples and they find this nuclear 
glass,

277
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,890
it's all at around 10,000
plus years ago.

278
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,063
Um,
that kind of stuff really starts to 

279
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:18,874
indicate that we're looking at possibly 
an event that might've shaped human 

280
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:26,490
history or a reset of a large percentage
of,

281
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,403
of the people on this planet where 
civilization in many areas was all but 

282
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:32,740
wiped out.
And then they had to rebuild again.

283
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:33,931
Yeah.
This is,

284
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:36,330
I mean,
actually this is coming to the fore now.

285
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,130
There's a lot of evidence for these.
I think that's the tektites their code,

286
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,970
um,
shock thinks that they are the result of

287
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:47,940
a gigantic cme,
coronal mass ejection,

288
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,450
giant solar flares,
and does a lot of evidence with this.

289
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,284
Actually,
we know if we get into talking about it 

290
00:15:53,761 --> 00:15:54,594
here,
I will at sea pack for short of shock 

291
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:58,320
will be its effect anyway.
The,

292
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,880
that it's,
but it's,

293
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,783
it's unlikely that it's actually a 
nuclear blast because it would be 

294
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,220
inconceivable,
well,

295
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,150
at least by our standards,
a manmade nuclear blast.

296
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,360
Although when you go into the Hindu 
texts,

297
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,910
and I think it's the upanishads where 
they describe what sounds like,

298
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,280
I mean it's described as a battle of the
gods,

299
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,890
but for all the world it does sound 
like,

300
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,933
like a nuclear conflagration,
a bit of a human made nuclear 

301
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:31,860
conflagration.

302
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,993
I'm not,
I don't think anybody knows enough to 

303
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:38,130
say what it is other than that,
that story is in there.

304
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,080
In fact,
one of the,

305
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,420
I'm a,
because I'm a writer by trade,

306
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,680
I'm very interested in the way that that
language is used.

307
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,770
And so myth is one of the,
one of the principle of misleading words

308
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,110
that,
um,

309
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,650
if you look in the dictionary,
the first stick,

310
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,070
the first meaning that it gives for myth
is a lie.

311
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,810
You were talking about the myth because 
mythbusters goes to them.

312
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,343
That myth is ally,
but the ancients didn't see myth is a 

313
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:10,804
lie.
What myth actually is when you get into 

314
00:17:12,661 --> 00:17:17,661
it fairly deeply is it is the,
it is the interplay of cosmic principles

315
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,360
described as drama rather than in 
mathematics.

316
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,553
So once you get a good look at this is 
extraordinary but opaque book called 

317
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:30,354
hamlet's mill by George Joe Desante,
Yana and heritage on deck and two tour 

318
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,943
historians of science at Mit,
which is about as respectable as 

319
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:40,380
credentials can be.

320
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,693
So as soon as,
as soon as myth is understood as having 

321
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,483
both a rigorous scientific as well as,
as well as philosophical and spiritual 

322
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:55,470
base,
the whole,

323
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,160
the whole understanding of myth turns 
around.

324
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,570
And you'll see,
for example,

325
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:03,960
in hamlet and Shakespeare's hamlet,
which is based upon the Danish,

326
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,890
it was based upon a Danish folk tale,
um,

327
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,750
which then becomes quite brilliantly 
actually the lion king.

328
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,670
Uh,
in the Disney film.

329
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,700
You see how the myth,
I mean,

330
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:20,500
in other words,
you can decode the ohs,

331
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:22,980
Iris Isis,
Horace Smith as,

332
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,003
as pure as pure science,
and it might call us a spiritual or 

333
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,993
sacred science.
And at the same time that the ripping 

334
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,780
good story when you,
when you put it that way,

335
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,143
a story because then everybody can 
understand it even if they don't 

336
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:41,454
understand it,
even if they can't articulate what 

337
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,650
they've understood,
the power of the story soaks through.

338
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,740
So myth is actually the more you know 
about it,

339
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,790
my case is not that much,
but at least it's better than nothing.

340
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,470
Um,
the more you know about it,

341
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,813
the more amazing mythology becomes that 
they should have been able to put 

342
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:07,521
together these complex,
high hierarchical,

343
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,710
esoteric concepts in a way that 
resonates as a story otherwise,

344
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,300
in so far as,
I mean,

345
00:19:17,301 --> 00:19:18,134
our own cosmology is next to impossible 
to understand unless you are a 

346
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:26,621
cosmologist and schooled in the abstract
mathematics that make the thing work.

347
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:28,030
I mean,
I can't,

348
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,100
I mean the mathematics is absolutely 
beyond me,

349
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,323
but some of my astrophysicist trends can
explain it to me in such a way that I 

350
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:36,704
understand,
but it still doesn't have any emotional 

351
00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:39,390
impact.

352
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,223
So essentially what you're saying is 
that they didn't have the sort of 

353
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:45,240
scientific discipline that we have 
today.

354
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:49,740
They didn't understand a lot of the 
things that we know today as far as a,

355
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,030
the way,
um,

356
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,013
academics or scientists relay 
information about space or about 

357
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:56,184
cosmology.
So what they did is they combined 

358
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,300
theater and story with the actual facts 
that they knew.

359
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,400
So that was the way they would relay 
this stuff.

360
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:06,234
And that's the way that stuff would be 
passed on that information to be passed 

361
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:09,114
on through these stories.
But in those stories was an actual 

362
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:15,160
history of the world itself as far as 
they knew.

363
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,420
Right

364
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,171
through,
through,

365
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:18,810
through,
through that and through symbolism.

366
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,123
And this is,
this is an infinitely superior way of 

367
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:25,860
communicating knowledge because you 
don't have to be an expert.

368
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,533
You'll,
it soaks into your bones in such a way 

369
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,850
that it,

370
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,680
okay,

371
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,970
it direct personally and collectively 
people's behaviors.

372
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,133
And it's my firm conviction that this is
why Egypt lasted as a coherent 

373
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:46,020
civilization,
even in its dynastic form,

374
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,890
but 3,500
years

375
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:53,310
and our lunatic societies coming apart 
at the seams in front of our eyes at 300

376
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:55,800
years.
I wanted to talk to you about the,

377
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,673
the written history of Egypt and the 
hieroglyphic history of the pharaohs 

378
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,591
because,
uh,

379
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,391
I remember,
uh,

380
00:21:03,391 --> 00:21:04,224
I think it was from magical Egypt one 
when you were talking about the 

381
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,773
historical record,
like what they have written down in the 

382
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:11,044
hieroglyphs about the pharaohs,
that it goes back far beyond what we 

383
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:16,850
think of as the birth of Egypt.
You know,

384
00:21:16,851 --> 00:21:17,440
with the,
the,

385
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,460
the construction,
the,

386
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:19,294
the great pyramid.
I believe they put it modern academics 

387
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:22,780
put it at 2,500
BC,

388
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,614
correct?
Yes.

389
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,543
And they,
you believe that it's possible that 

390
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:30,970
Egypt existed as far back as,
I think you said 34,000

391
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:31,661
years.
Well,

392
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:33,130
that's,
that's their own,

393
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,200
that's the Egyptians account,
not mine,

394
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,190
right.
Course.

395
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,430
As expressed as expressed in a couple 
of,

396
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,833
in a couple of an in a stone tablet 
called the Palermo stone because it's 

397
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:46,300
now in Palermo,
Italy.

398
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,643
Um,
and in a very fragmentary papyruses 

399
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,720
called the Turin papyrus,
which is now in Turin.

400
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,693
And both of these documents.
One is a stone stele and the other is a 

401
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,610
hippopotamus tell or recount.
Um,

402
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,133
long periods when Egypt was ruled first 
by the net chodo which means the gods 

403
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:12,400
themselves,
which I take to mean fully,

404
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:16,150
fully realized divine human beings.
In other words,

405
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:20,710
human beings that have attained,
that have passed the,

406
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,120
the test of the quest of it.
Four in mortality who are in effect,

407
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,020
they've outsmarted death or they've out 
developed debt.

408
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,350
You why do you believe this?
Um,

409
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,450
because their work speak for themselves 
as it were.

410
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,730
Um,
and the,

411
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,470
the,
the level of the,

412
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,230
now we talked going back even to an even
to um,

413
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,113
to dynastic Egypt because the temples 
themselves and the level of art 

414
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,473
involved,
particularly in the sculpture is such 

415
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,270
that standard.

416
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,353
I say stay genius is rare enough,
but standard human genius doesn't seem 

417
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:07,450
to apply to these incredible 
constructions.

418
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:12,451
And the core academics simply dismiss it
out of hand is really very talented.

419
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,930
Um,
exponent of a barbaric and um,

420
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,620
and primitive understanding of the 
cosmos.

421
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,040
I leading my trips there,
which I do as you know,

422
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,290
a few times a year.
The next one coming up.

423
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,850
By the way,
anybody listening in,

424
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,980
how could people go in on one of those 
trips with you?

425
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,881
Oh,
it's very easy.

426
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:31,930
You pay.
Okay.

427
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,520
Where do they,
where do they find you though?

428
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,510
On my website.
Um,

429
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,020
John Anthony.
west.com.

430
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,880
Yeah.
On the website or,

431
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,410
or my,
my email.

432
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,990
J A w spanx at AOL dot.
Oh,

433
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:45,680
you messed up.
You give your email.

434
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,120
That's a disaster.
Is it?

435
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,013
My people.
Horrible people are going to send you 

436
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,620
naked pictures for sure.
Oh,

437
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,910
not of themselves.

438
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:57,910
I am I familiar with the term Dick pic 
cause it's,

439
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,220
yeah,
there you go.

440
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,990
Um,
so your,

441
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,830
your thoughts are that these people that
live 34,000

442
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:11,831
years ago were incredibly advanced,
much further advanced than we are today,

443
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,380
which doesn't take much.
But when you understand what's involved,

444
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:16,790
but yeah,
I know what you're saying,

445
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:17,624
but I mean we're,
we're pretty damn advanced compared to 

446
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:22,510
the people a few hundred years ago or in
certain ways we are abreast.

447
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,810
We still can't,
we couldn't,

448
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,450
we couldn't and wouldn't build the 
cathedral of shots.

449
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,420
Yeah.
Nobody,

450
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:31,670
there's nobody alive.
To the best of my knowledge,

451
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,893
who could produce a building that is 
based upon sacred principles that even 

452
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,840
comes close to sacred geometry and set 
grieve.

453
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:42,763
Even that,
I mean a few people really know quite a 

454
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:47,660
bit about this,
but they couldn't design Jada and that's

455
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,750
well that's 12th century.
What was it about Egypt and that time in

456
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:54,314
particular that in your opinion,
I mean obviously there's a lot of 

457
00:24:57,081 --> 00:25:00,500
speculation going on here because 
there's so little evidence from 34,000

458
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:01,334
years ago,
but what is it about that area that you 

459
00:25:02,811 --> 00:25:06,170
think develop people at such an 
incredibly high level?

460
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,070
Cause unless there's more evidence to be
found there,

461
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:11,630
it doesn't seem to be any parallels 
anywhere else in the world.

462
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,320
Like that one spot.
And actually there's,

463
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,893
there's a fairly,
there's a fairly simple explanation for 

464
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:20,550
that,
for a change it,

465
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,080
most of this stuff is so complicated,
but just to go back a bit to the,

466
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:24,963
the rule by the net shit who,
the gods themselves and the names of 

467
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:31,340
those real is a given and the length of 
time that they reigned.

468
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,040
And then there's another group of 
[inaudible] the lines,

469
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,960
the line of time is incredible.
Right?

470
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,020
Well this is where we're getting the 
34,000,

471
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,710
36,000
BC from.

472
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,480
Yeah,
because you add the,

473
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,003
the time's up.
The Turin for pirates has a similar 

474
00:25:45,081 --> 00:25:49,390
thing of the net that reign rule of the 
net shadow and the rule by the,

475
00:25:49,391 --> 00:25:51,980
it's called the [inaudible],
the followers of the,

476
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,500
the followers of the companions of 
horace.

477
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,753
And again,
the names are given and the regularly 

478
00:25:57,101 --> 00:25:59,030
as,
and when you add those all up together,

479
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,220
you get around 34 36,000
BC,

480
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,030
four does this some,
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

481
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:06,260
but Warren,
some of the pharaohs,

482
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:09,890
didn't they live hundreds of years.
There's no evidence for that.

483
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,040
But wasn't it written that they did?
I'm not sure.

484
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,170
I'm not sure what those dates are 
actually.

485
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:17,810
I've not actually deeply researched 
them.

486
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,870
I get those figures from [inaudible],
the UBX,

487
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,723
the great genius with the 
unpronounceable name who put together 

488
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:30,881
the whole interpretation of symbolist 
Egypt from which my work is derived.

489
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:34,040
I mean,
I regard myself as Schweller's Boswell,

490
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,353
um,
making his basically impenetrable work 

491
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,740
of accessible,
accessible to dummies like me.

492
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,710
No smart guys,
smart guys like you and not dumb.

493
00:26:47,711 --> 00:26:49,740
He's like politicians and quack 
academics.

494
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:53,370
No,
but when you're talking about 34,000

495
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:55,290
years,
I mean the average person today lives to

496
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:56,124
be about 80 years.
You're talking about an incredible 

497
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:59,330
number of pharaoh's then.
Yeah,

498
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,150
you are.
And so all that is depicted apparently,

499
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,690
apparently the names,
the names are given that I get that from

500
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:11,691
Schwaller from the one from the one long
chapter he wrote called the,

501
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,411
the,
the,

502
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:17,880
the chronology choreography.
He calls it [inaudible] not the word for

503
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:18,714
it,
but the chronology of Egypt where he's 

504
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,360
looking to back up to 200 from a 
scholarly point of view,

505
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:27,894
for the mode of the scholarly argument 
that the Egyptians knew what they were 

506
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:34,080
talking about when they were assigning 
these long reins.

507
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:35,930
That these are not fictitious.
Um,

508
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,193
this is not made up history that in 
order to you fool the people who 

509
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:43,970
couldn't read the hieroglyphs anyway,
only describes,

510
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,180
could read the hieroglyphs.

511
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,640
So the trawler wrote this very long and 
thoughtful and scholarly,

512
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,350
um,
lecture,

513
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,071
I,
sorry,

514
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,570
not lecture,
but that chapter.

515
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,913
And then at the very end of it,
this throwaway line and does of course 

516
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:00,270
the Great Sphinx of Giza has been 
weathered,

517
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,300
chose unmistakable signs of aquatic 
erosion.

518
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,260
And that was my little epiphany because 
I picked up on that and said,

519
00:28:07,261 --> 00:28:09,180
wow,
the rest of this isn't science,

520
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,930
but that's geology.
And if the geologists can be,

521
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,350
you know,
can will agree that this is,

522
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,550
this cannot have taken place since 2,500
years,

523
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,720
2,500
bc when the synxis supposedly built this

524
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:28,050
will upset the whole paradigm.
All of civilization will have to be,

525
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,530
our view of civilization will have to be
rethought.

526
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,630
And that's began.
There's a long,

527
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,853
long now,
four decade long quest to find somebody 

528
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,840
to back it up.
And we're now,

529
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:45,050
my sense of it is closing in on beating 
down the opposition.

530
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,930
And this'll be another thing I took.
In fact,

531
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:51,420
I'll probably be talking about at 
Seapak,

532
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,613
but probably have with how so I said a 
little bit more politely than I feel it 

533
00:28:57,601 --> 00:29:02,601
necessary to talk about here.
I'm here with you and that is riffing on

534
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,073
a line that probably everybody who tunes
into this is pro is familiar with 

535
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,480
victor,
who goes to the French poet,

536
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,190
novelist,
a dramatist of the 19th century France.

537
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:21,210
Actually Frances,
most most popular poet of the,

538
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:22,044
of the 19th century was v Victor Hugo,
and it was Victor Hugo who wrote the 

539
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:27,114
famous line.
There's one thing stronger than all the 

540
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:32,550
armies in the world and that is an idea 
whose time has come.

541
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,900
You know that line,
right?

542
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:38,040
Everybody knows that line.
But what victor who go didn't think of,

543
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,083
or if he did,
he didn't express it was that the 

544
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,710
strongest thing in the world is an idea 
whose time has not yet gone.

545
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:49,390
And since it is,
it is a matter of record that all of the

546
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:54,010
armies in the world be they military,
economic,

547
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:55,570
financial,
cultural,

548
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,080
agricultural,
even wherever there's a paradigm,

549
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:03,670
there's an army devoted to protecting 
that paradigm.

550
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,100
And this is where we stand now,
that,

551
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:11,610
that the idea whose time has come only 
comes when the second strongest,

552
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,283
the armies of the second strongest thing
in the world are beaten down and beaten 

553
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:19,054
into the ground and somebody breaches 
the Portcullis to the ivory tower where 

554
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:23,634
all of these guys live.
And this is a particular interest to me 

555
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:30,190
because I am a scholar by default,
but a satirist by nature.

556
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,623
And really my whole,
my whole adult life has been devoted to 

557
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:44,290
proving a vision that I had at the age 
of 13 or so.

558
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,590
But I was born into a lunatic asylum.
And at the age of about 19,

559
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:50,424
it was a very uncomfortable place to 
live where everybody's called the 

560
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,343
progress.

561
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,590
And I thought it was crazy.
And at that age,

562
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:58,690
about 19 or so,
I knew what I wanted to do,

563
00:30:58,691 --> 00:30:59,524
which was to be the little boy who said 
the emperor has no clothes and to prove 

564
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,413
to everybody's satisfaction that indeed 
the emperor has no clothes and it's a 

565
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:09,724
lunatic asylum.
The end result took me a few couple of 

566
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,150
decades to realize that it was that,
um,

567
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,120
in,
in real life what happens is that no,

568
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:20,560
the people all older,
they will look,

569
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:24,070
the emperor has no clothes and everybody
lives happily ever after.

570
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,060
What happens is that the disgraced 
amparo gets up and goes back to his,

571
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,870
goes back to his palace and regroups the
empire.

572
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,360
And at the end they,
all of the,

573
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,223
all of the forces of empire conspire to 
prove to everyone that the emperor's 

574
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:42,940
clothes are real.
But it's the child who's imaginary.

575
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,253
Talking about this before the podcast,
and this is a really fascinating aspect 

576
00:31:47,101 --> 00:31:49,660
of this discussion,
was yours,

577
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:50,843
when I first became aware of your work,
was that Charlton Heston narrated 

578
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:56,670
documentary about the aging of the 
Sphinx,

579
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,160
the mystery of the Sphinx,
which I believe is on NBC.

580
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,800
Uh,
what,

581
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:01,634
what I thought was shocking was when Dr 
Shock was speaking to that Egypt 

582
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:14,361
tologist who was saying what evidence is
there of a culture that existed 7,000

583
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,730
years before ancient Egypt?
What?

584
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,340
There's no evidence.
He's like theories.

585
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,203
No.
And he was laughing and the way he was 

586
00:32:22,411 --> 00:32:24,780
doing it was so much ego involved and 
what he was saying,

587
00:32:24,781 --> 00:32:25,614
I was like,
wow,

588
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,200
this is not how I would picture an 
Egypt.

589
00:32:28,201 --> 00:32:30,810
Tologist laughing.
Well that got me curious.

590
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:32,910
I started getting into it.
Why would anybody think like that?

591
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:34,080
And then I realized,
oh,

592
00:32:34,081 --> 00:32:38,910
these guys write books and they teach 
lectures and they teach classes based on

593
00:32:38,911 --> 00:32:39,744
this that they're,
they're teaching and now this 

594
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:44,030
information has been shown to be not 
true anymore.

595
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,600
When doctor shock was showing this water
erosion,

596
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,463
he was saying that this was all before 
the discovery of gold Beckley tappy and 

597
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:51,674
once they discovered go Beckley Tapi,
now they know that there was a 

598
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:57,470
sophisticated structure capable of 
massive stones circles.

599
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,543
That was 12,000
years ago at least when it was 

600
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,993
intentionally buried.
So it could have easily been several 

601
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:09,440
thousand years old then we don't know.
But we know at least 12,000

602
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:10,274
years ago someone was capable of 
incredible design and incredible stone 

603
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:14,774
structures with three dimensional 
animals carved into the stone 

604
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,360
structures,
which is very sophisticated now.

605
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:25,570
Has that guy been talked to since then?
And has he amended his position on it?

606
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,880
As far as I know he hasn't and I know 
laner reasonably well.

607
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:34,530
We're civil to each other and it won't 
be long.

608
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,050
I mean he's the,
he's,

609
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,840
he's one of the generals of the,
uh,

610
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:40,440
in the,
in,

611
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,011
in,
in,

612
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:41,844
in the,
in the army of the idea whose time has 

613
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,550
not yet gone.
And his,

614
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,570
his time is coming up pretty good.

615
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,260
Does he dress,
go back,

616
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,094
Lee tappy now me cause his whole,
his whole position was there was no 

617
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:55,400
civilization.
What evidence is there?

618
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,560
Well now that you have this evidence,
what does he say?

619
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:02,600
I haven't actually spoken to him and I 
don't know if anyone has,

620
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:04,370
I see him in Egypt every once in a 
while.

621
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,593
I don't know if anyone has.
And I said I ran into him fairly 

622
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:10,580
recently.
He just said hello.

623
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,120
And I don't think I'd really,
I'd necessarily want to bring it up with

624
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:19,730
them.
Um,

625
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:24,230
off the record.
I'd rather have him that the camera's on

626
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:28,220
us and just see what happens.
But otherwise,

627
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,580
otherwise,
otherwise he's a dead duck.

628
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,903
But it's just so he,
he seems to be just clinging to this 

629
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:35,664
idea because he can,
like in mainstream academia hasn't 

630
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,330
accepted this predating of the Sphinx 
or,

631
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,210
or also the,
the difference in the structures,

632
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,700
like the difference in the construction 
methods that were used.

633
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:48,683
One of the more fascinating things that 
you sort of highlighted in your ancient 

634
00:34:50,911 --> 00:34:52,680
Egypt,
a series magical Egypt,

635
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:53,514
which is fantastic and I highly 
recommend it to anybody who is even 

636
00:34:56,881 --> 00:34:57,714
remotely curious to this.
You will be sucked in in an incredible 

637
00:34:59,761 --> 00:35:00,594
way.
It got to the point where my wife was 

638
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,270
walking by the TV,
she's like,

639
00:35:03,271 --> 00:35:05,070
Jesus Christ,
you're watching Egypt again.

640
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:05,961
And I'm like,
it's,

641
00:35:05,961 --> 00:35:08,700
it's like six disks that goes on 
forever.

642
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,140
Eight.
Um,

643
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:10,974
so the different,
there's a clear distinction between the 

644
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,950
older methods of construction and the 
newer methods.

645
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:17,784
They use different methods and it's 
really obvious to someone like me who's 

646
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,960
not even a,
I don't know anything about it,

647
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,033
but you could see the difference and 
also that these older structures were 

648
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,210
below the newer structures.
Like you had a dig down to get them.

649
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,250
That's right.
Yeah.

650
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:33,090
It's like the fact that they don't 
address that.

651
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,953
The fact that this isn't,
that's like they want to lump this all 

652
00:35:36,061 --> 00:35:37,970
into the same people,
kind of crazy.

653
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,730
It is and but as long as they can get 
away with it,

654
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:44,010
they will continue to get away with it.
As I said,

655
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,263
the second,
the second strongest thing in the world 

656
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,440
is the idea whose time has not yet gone 
and anybody who doesn't,

657
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,000
let's say among myself,
between myself and my colleagues are all

658
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:59,450
in this,
let's say the,

659
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,440
the,
the question to prove,

660
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,780
to demonstrate that the advanced 
civilization existed in the very distant

661
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:11,640
past,
which is in my case other cases,

662
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:12,474
not necessarily,
but in mine it's because that opens the 

663
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:17,300
door in and of itself,
doesn't the pro,

664
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,213
it doesn't affect the price of eggs,
but on a much more profound 

665
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:21,684
philosophical level.
Once it's understood that that 

666
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,930
understanding that civilization goes,
went back way much,

667
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:32,931
much further leads to the understanding 
and the acceptance that our role,

668
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:39,960
our destiny as human beings is to 
achieve in mortality.

669
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:44,130
This is as simple as all as that.
Otherwise it's just a head trip.

670
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,353
In other words,
if it's not understood that we have a 

671
00:36:46,681 --> 00:36:49,350
role to play in this grand cosmic state 
scheme,

672
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,760
there's no civilization.

673
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,050
What do you mean by that?
Our,

674
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,400
our,
our goal is to achieve in mortality.

675
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:58,870
Do you mean as individuals or do you 
mean like and what's in what way?

676
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,293
That we,
we arrive at a level of consciousness 

677
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,720
that is not subject to the death of the 
physical body,

678
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,770
so all of religion is based upon that.
All of the,

679
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,813
the stories of the saints and the Rachis
and the masters and so on is based upon 

680
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:16,763
all of it is based upon their 
experiences that have led them to this 

681
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,220
understanding.
If it's just a head trip,

682
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:26,670
it's no good.
It has to be part of your very being.

683
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,863
The purpose of sacred art is to end of 
sacred music when it works is to 

684
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,360
communicate even if only momentarily and
fragmentary.

685
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:42,300
Really this understanding that there's 
something else.

686
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,820
And speaking from my own personal 
experiences,

687
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,600
I've never gone through a full blown 
mystical experience,

688
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,310
but I've had lots of these moments,
particularly in Egypt and the long study

689
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,563
and these moments in Egypt where there's
this sudden realization that the world 

690
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:04,500
as it as it has,
it manifests to our,

691
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,323
our,
our,

692
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:07,883
our faculties are normal faculties is 
not the only world there is this 

693
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:13,824
something else beyond that,
which was understood a lot better in 

694
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:21,080
those days than now.
And actually when we end up,

695
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,210
I forgot to mention this,
but I don't know if you know this.

696
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,370
I've been spent the last couple of years
sort of sidetracked from my regular work

697
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:34,440
working on a book written by a friend of
mine.

698
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,400
Good.
Um,

699
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,503
who was not a writer.
So I helped him with the editing and 

700
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:43,390
contributed to it.
And this is maybe the definitive book on

701
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:45,390
envy and the ease.
You know what those are,

702
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,320
right near death experience,
death experiences.

703
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,543
He was a Christian pastor,
a rare guy who actually lived what he 

704
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:51,514
preached named David Solomon,
and he had collected all of this 

705
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:56,014
material,
huge amount of material that he was 

706
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,790
trying to systematize because this is 
now,

707
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:05,620
it's certainly not a common experience,
but there are 5,000

708
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,993
verifiable accounts of people who have 
been clinically dead and who have been 

709
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:11,914
revived usually but through modern 
methods because now one of the reasons 

710
00:39:15,461 --> 00:39:20,461
why it's now so common and before it was
reserved for the saints,

711
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:23,950
the Great Saints and the mystics that 
modern medicine has,

712
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:24,784
has,
has improved to such an extent that if 

713
00:39:26,321 --> 00:39:27,154
you get to these people quickly enough,
any number of people who are clinically 

714
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:34,090
dead for x number of minutes,
you know,

715
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,160
not two days minutes,
sometimes more extended period than that

716
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,760
come back with these tales of this 
realm.

717
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,950
Beyond that of the senses,
a realm of higher consciousness.

718
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:52,951
Basically what it is,
what they've experienced is his grace.

719
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,420
In Christian terms,
it's grace,

720
00:39:55,421 --> 00:39:56,500
it's a,
it's a moment.

721
00:39:56,501 --> 00:40:00,940
Then they come back transformed and they
come back convinced that everything that

722
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:04,900
they were doing before is either 
nonsense or unimportant.

723
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:05,734
Then they often come back with a mission
even though they don't have the 

724
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,170
schooling,
let's say.

725
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:12,880
They don't understand philosophically or
spiritually what they've experienced.

726
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:13,714
They know what they've experienced and 
they laugh at the debunkers who are 

727
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:20,230
saying it's all brown hallucination of 
the brain dying brain.

728
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,900
This is all garbage.
What they've experienced,

729
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:23,734
they've experienced,
and David put these together in a 

730
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:29,260
systematic fashion and then as he was 
just a Diclectin,

731
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,094
all this material,
and I was telling him this is that he's 

732
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:34,054
a good friend.
He financed our trip to go the tap pay 

733
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:36,843
five,
six years ago and he started losing his 

734
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:42,790
balance and he was a touchy guy who 
knows a lot about balance.

735
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,910
Also a bonsai master and the Christian 
Pastor,

736
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,610
unusual guy,
and he started losing his balance and it

737
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:53,430
wasn't going away and the doctors 
finally figured out what he had,

738
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:56,110
what it was wrong with them and he had a
Glioma,

739
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,090
Glioblastoma,
something.

740
00:40:58,091 --> 00:40:59,380
I forget purpose.
It's something.

741
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:03,250
Do you know what a Glioma is?
Because it's a form of brain cancer that

742
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:07,210
is 100% fatal.
It's the only thing you have is that you

743
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:08,044
can't determine the timeline.
And they gave him something like 10 

744
00:41:11,441 --> 00:41:15,310
months to 12 months to live.
They actually lived three years.

745
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,980
And at that point he had all of this 
material.

746
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:19,750
And I told him when he was telling me 
that,

747
00:41:19,751 --> 00:41:20,501
I said,
hey dude,

748
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:23,080
I should write a book.
This is really good stuff.

749
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,750
The way you're doing it is not like 
anybody else has ever done.

750
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,430
And he said,
no,

751
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:28,380
no,
I'm not a writer.

752
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,223
I'm just doing this.
And then when he found out the 

753
00:41:30,131 --> 00:41:32,440
diagnosis,
then he had a mission,

754
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,980
which was to get the book out,
but

755
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,170
he wasn't a writer.
So he drafted me into,

756
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,123
they'll put the words in ride harder and
he lasted just long enough to get the 

757
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:44,150
book finished and get it published.
And it's,

758
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:45,200
it's,
it's really,

759
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,320
if this went viral,
it could make a difference.

760
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:50,480
It's called,
he was very good at titled David.

761
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,820
It's called,
um,

762
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:56,810
it's called the dead saints chronicles 
subtitle,

763
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,550
a,
um,

764
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,040
a zen journey through the Christian 
afterlife.

765
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,810
And it really,
it really is an absolutely extraordinary

766
00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:06,644
book and it becomes quite clear when you
go through this that what people have 

767
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:13,760
experienced is a state of grace that's 
not all the same.

768
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:16,850
I mean some people it's more profound 
and some people less so,

769
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,953
but all of these people are unprepared 
for what they've experienced and all of 

770
00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:25,190
them come back transformed.
And of course the cracker dynamics.

771
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,530
This is one of the ways they protect 
themselves.

772
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:31,130
Peer Review was one way and the other is
their insistence.

773
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:34,460
Who the hell made?
We gave them the right to make the rules

774
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:38,510
from science that applied to science 
with the scientist that that makes,

775
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:39,950
gives them the right,
the big the rules,

776
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:44,390
know the rules of the rules and one of 
their insists,

777
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,253
one of the chief element,
one of the chief ways in which they 

778
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:52,901
protect themselves is to insist that 
anecdotal evidence,

779
00:42:53,481 --> 00:42:56,540
personal experience doesn't count.
I don't know about you,

780
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:59,450
but I wouldn't buy a cookbook by someone
who's never fried an egg.

781
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,710
So these are guys who've never fried a 
spiritual egg and these 5,000

782
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:04,544
accounts or people who've actually been 
there to this superior realm and come 

783
00:43:10,191 --> 00:43:11,690
back to talk about it.

784
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:12,563
No.
You say you haven't had a mystical 

785
00:43:14,311 --> 00:43:16,140
experience.
You mean a psychedelic experience?

786
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,310
Know that I've had yet.
You've had psychedelic trance,

787
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,630
which kind of psychedelic experiences 
behind Oh,

788
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,630
blood done Iowasca and I've done 10.
I've done,

789
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:24,960
you know,
you name it.

790
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,210
Right.
So then,

791
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,560
so you've done dmt.
Yes,

792
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,320
I've done and I've done a,

793
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,260
not Mescalin,
but um,

794
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,810
the other one out acid.
Okay.

795
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:35,930
All of those.
No,

796
00:43:35,931 --> 00:43:38,080
no.
The experience has come actually for me,

797
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,850
as I said,
they're not a major,

798
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,940
it's not the state of grace that these 
people,

799
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,630
you didn't experience a state of grace 
when you did DMT.

800
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:47,700
Not Quite,
no,

801
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,060
not,
not compared to what the,

802
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:50,851
the,
the,

803
00:43:50,851 --> 00:43:51,860
uh,
the MDS.

804
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,970
The ask how many times you've done it?
One.

805
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:54,841
One time.
Okay.

806
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:57,030
Did you do a lot of it?
I don't know.

807
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,200
He gotta do a lot of it.
Yeah.

808
00:43:58,201 --> 00:44:01,830
I made you just dissolve.
Did you go to this crazy geometric,

809
00:44:01,831 --> 00:44:04,030
infinite universe where you're coming?
I didn't,

810
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,310
he didn't get in there then.
I didn't get,

811
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,400
I didn't need how long you in town for?
Pardon?

812
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:09,263
How long you in town for?
Till tomorrow we're going to have to 

813
00:44:11,761 --> 00:44:13,620
make something happen.
You got up,

814
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:14,543
you got to go deeper.
That experience that people are having 

815
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:20,480
and near death experience is mirrored by
the same extent.

816
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:21,323
You,
I'm sure you're aware of Doctor Rick 

817
00:44:22,051 --> 00:44:22,950
strassman.
Oh yeah,

818
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:23,784
sure,
sure.

819
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,300
Um,
he,

820
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,980
I believe actually we met them when 
chance was doing the brilliant guy.

821
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,190
It's so important because what has 
created

822
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,870
by his book,
Dmt,

823
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:34,704
the spirit molecule,
they did these clinical tests giving 

824
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:41,700
people dmt in a clinical setting and a 
at the University of New Mexico.

825
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:42,923
And what they found was these people 
achieve this incredible state of 

826
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:49,420
understanding,
um,

827
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:52,200
a more relaxed,
a vision of the future.

828
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:54,420
They're more confident,
like the,

829
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,273
the idea,
I mean this is also mirrored by some of 

830
00:44:56,221 --> 00:44:57,054
the John Hopkins tested they've done 
with people with silicide been where 

831
00:44:59,581 --> 00:45:01,170
people have,
uh,

832
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,753
you know,
they have just a much better outlook 

833
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,093
about the future.
They don't think that this is it and 

834
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:09,750
that whatever happens to them when 
they're having these trips.

835
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,733
And the way strassman did it as much 
more intense and most people do it 

836
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:16,920
because they did intravenous doses,
which lasts longer.

837
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:19,380
A typical dmt trip last only about 15 
minutes,

838
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:21,840
unless you just jump right back in,
which is what I usually do.

839
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,490
But he,
um,

840
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,500
he gave these people to intravenous 
doses,

841
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:28,890
which to take them just very deep for 
more than a half an hour.

842
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,053
And they all have very similar stories 
and similar stores to people that have 

843
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:33,534
had near death experiences.
I've had friends that have had near 

844
00:45:36,031 --> 00:45:37,950
death experiences and when they talk 
about it,

845
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,670
it's very similar to the way I've talked
to other people that have had dmt trips,

846
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:45,060
where they are in the presence of this 
divine greatness.

847
00:45:45,061 --> 00:45:47,190
There's something.
So,

848
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,650
but that is also a chemical that's 
produced by the brain.

849
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,270
Now this is where,
uh,

850
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,740
neuroscientists step in and say,
well,

851
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:58,730
your experiences is experiencing is some
sort of a hallucination and a,

852
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,573
they might be right,
but it also might be some sort of a 

853
00:46:01,741 --> 00:46:05,670
chemical gateway that your brain 
produces when we really don't know.

854
00:46:05,671 --> 00:46:09,390
And that might be the way the soul,
quote unquote air quotes,

855
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,230
whatever.

856
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,740
But for lack of a better word,
transitions to this next stage of life.

857
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:17,460
Now when the anecdotal evidence that 
you're talking about is measuring up,

858
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:21,720
what's interesting about it is similar 
accounts over and over and over and over

859
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:23,760
again.
The people that can remember things,

860
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:26,100
they remember this incredibly divine 
experience.

861
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:29,850
But you know,
the question becomes is that experience,

862
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,710
and this is something that I've been 
bouncing,

863
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:32,723
bouncing around in my head a lot lately,
is that experience a hallucination or 

864
00:46:36,451 --> 00:46:39,870
has that experience and actual real 
experience in a divine presence?

865
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,733
And does it matter?
Because is it the same thing no matter 

866
00:46:44,491 --> 00:46:45,324
what?
If you just think you're experiencing 

867
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:51,990
God and divine greatness because you're 
creating it in your mind versus actually

868
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:52,824
experiencing God and divine greatness.
Isn't the experience the exact same 

869
00:46:56,131 --> 00:46:56,964
thing and is is our mine locked into the
idea of a physical thing like this 

870
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:01,980
laptop?

871
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,510
I can pick it up,
I can drop it.

872
00:47:03,511 --> 00:47:04,860
I know it has weight,
I can touch it.

873
00:47:04,861 --> 00:47:05,694
I can measure the width.
We can't do that with psychedelic 

874
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:09,624
experiences.
We can't do that with transcendent 

875
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:11,874
experiences.
We can't do that with mystical 

876
00:47:13,381 --> 00:47:14,850
experiences.
You can't measure them.

877
00:47:14,851 --> 00:47:16,710
You can't put them in a bag and take it 
home with you,

878
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,940
but it might be the same thing.
It's entirely possible that this is what

879
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:21,774
a many,
many ancient cultures experienced as 

880
00:47:22,861 --> 00:47:23,694
well.
They found these of psychedelics very 

881
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:27,084
odd for early on and this is also 
something that you documented your work 

882
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:35,350
and they date documented it very clearly
in a lot of the d Egyptian work.

883
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:37,300
They had deep understanding and 
knowledge.

884
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,130
Exactly.
Joe,

885
00:47:39,131 --> 00:47:42,040
this is one of the important things 
about the drugs,

886
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,100
the drugs and the NDE experiences.
In my view,

887
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,670
the ND experiences,
marcel,

888
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:52,480
because there's nothing in the way.
There's nothing obstructing it.

889
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:53,430
The dead.
Right.

890
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,750
And this is where they go with the 
drugs.

891
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:57,170
You're,
you don't,

892
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,211
you,
you know,

893
00:47:58,211 --> 00:47:59,220
you're you,
um,

894
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:03,680
in these experiences and the problem,
interesting.

895
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:06,850
There's problem I once it's not a 
problem is the wrong word,

896
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:08,170
but,
um,

897
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:11,080
with the Nde experiences,
I mean,

898
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:16,380
absolutely joe six pack everybody,
ordinary people,

899
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,373
many of them,
some of them even atheists go through 

900
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:23,920
this and come back,
literally transformed their whole lives,

901
00:48:23,921 --> 00:48:27,760
have changed by with the drugs.
It really is for the most part,

902
00:48:27,761 --> 00:48:30,340
it's a trip.
It doesn't have this,

903
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:33,250
let's say there's lasting 
transformational value.

904
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,320
It doesn't,
some people it does sometimes.

905
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:35,740
Yes.

906
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,760
Well,
the John Hopkins study showed that a lot

907
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:39,590
of people,
like decades later,

908
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,900
I know a vaseline improved quality of 
life,

909
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:42,763
different outlook on things.
And especially when you're dealing with 

910
00:48:44,901 --> 00:48:46,430
terminally ill patients.
Oh,

911
00:48:46,431 --> 00:48:47,264
well.
And they've given it to terminally ill 

912
00:48:47,931 --> 00:48:48,764
patients,
significant lessening of anxiety and 

913
00:48:51,231 --> 00:48:52,250
fear of death.

914
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,070
Oh,
sure.

915
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:55,340
It would be.
But the hallucination,

916
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,270
this is another scam by the,
by the so called rationalists,

917
00:48:59,271 --> 00:49:00,104
who in fact the not there.
This idea that it's a hallucination and 

918
00:49:02,631 --> 00:49:06,650
what's a hallucination and what's it's,
what's its evolutionary value?

919
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:09,440
Why should they be?
Where's the hallucination gene?

920
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:12,710
This is all bullshit actually.
And what it actually is,

921
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:16,890
is not based upon reason as they liked,
as they like to,

922
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,553
as they promote themselves,
what it is actually is the 

923
00:49:20,421 --> 00:49:23,450
rationalization of their own inner 
emptiness.

924
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:26,660
They can't handle the fact that there 
might be something else,

925
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:27,823
and in fact,
their whole intellectual lives are 

926
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:31,363
consecrated to the,
to proving that life is indeed as 

927
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,400
meaningless as their own.

928
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,860
But is that what it is?
Or is it,

929
00:49:38,861 --> 00:49:41,050
they're just trying to look at some sort
of a,

930
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,200
give it a critical objective view and,
and go over all the possibilities.

931
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:47,403
We know that drugs do affect the mind in
very strange ways and we know some 

932
00:49:50,261 --> 00:49:53,380
people take drugs and it completely 
distorts the reality.

933
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:55,150
Alcohol's a perfect example of that,
right?

934
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:56,103
Yeah.
It's a great drug for distorting 

935
00:49:57,071 --> 00:49:58,990
reality.
You can watch someone get drunk and have

936
00:49:58,991 --> 00:50:01,930
a very bizarre version of the what of 
what they're looking at.

937
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:03,183
Um,
there's many drugs that change the way 

938
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:07,780
people look at things like physically 
the way they see things.

939
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,580
They will hallucinate.
They,

940
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:10,563
they do.
So we know that drugs have an effect on 

941
00:50:11,681 --> 00:50:12,514
people.
I mean it seems rational though that a 

942
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:14,884
scientist would look at those things and
try to find some sort of a scientific 

943
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,250
explanation for the chemical process is 
going on in the mind.

944
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,084
The way it's affecting the visual cortex
and the things that the person is quote 

945
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:25,900
unquote hallucinating

946
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:30,770
underlying that contention,
which is not science in an of itself.

947
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:33,800
That is just a hypothesis.
That is speculation.

948
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:34,903
And I said,
what is based upon is protecting their 

949
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:41,660
own vision of the world,
which is that the universe isn't,

950
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,080
is an accident and anything that is 
mystical or sore,

951
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:49,940
so-called spiritual is hallucinatory.
And they have the answers.

952
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,040
And these people,
as far as I'm concerned,

953
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,040
are more dangerous even than 
politicians.

954
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,370
They are,
they are put it this way.

955
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,420
Um,
it's the,

956
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:04,010
the Church of progress is the religion 
of the,

957
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:07,970
of the emotionally defective,
the spiritually dyslexic,

958
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:12,800
and the philosophically depraved.
Or to put it into into other terms,

959
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,233
you actually,
martial arts master I studied with 

960
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:19,340
briefly,
he used to say in his Japanese accent,

961
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:20,653
if you want,
if you want happiness in this crazy 

962
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:24,254
world,
you do not talk about moon beams to the 

963
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:31,871
blind or sutton or woundings to the 
blind music to the death.

964
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,390
And you absolutely do not talk about sex
to Unix.

965
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,553
They just get angry.
And this is what you're dealing with 

966
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:40,034
when you're dealing with these,
with these intellectually based 

967
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:45,140
scientists.
These are spiritual,

968
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:50,141
emotional and philosophical unix and no 
kids,

969
00:51:52,161 --> 00:51:54,830
no surprise when they behave the way 
they do.

970
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,190
Who surprised who surprised when the,
when the,

971
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:01,560
when the UNIX snigger behind the salt 
back and,

972
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:02,403
and deride his passions.
The problem is that with our Church of 

973
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,433
our church or progress,
when the Unix take over the palace and 

974
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:13,880
called their terrible disability reason,
then the empire's cooked.

975
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:14,963
You sound like a person who's been 
deeply in the trenches against 

976
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:19,590
academics.
A bitter man.

977
00:52:19,591 --> 00:52:20,370
John Anthony.

978
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,390
No,
I'm not bitter.

979
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:22,763
I'm not bitter.
I'm just realistic and I know what's 

980
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:25,674
involved from being in the trenches.
I know what's involved in fighting this 

981
00:52:30,301 --> 00:52:33,150
particular battle,
which I've been engaged in all of these,

982
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:36,390
all of these,
all of these decades and those are yours

983
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:39,640
cause you're dealing with archaeologists
that are trying to refute evidence.

984
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:40,643
They're all just as bad as each other.
What I bring to the table that my 

985
00:52:43,591 --> 00:52:44,424
colleague Graham Hancock was an 
excellent writer and some of the others 

986
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,850
who are very brilliant people.
Rupert sheldrake is all to her very good

987
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:55,780
friend and a very good scientist.
What they are not as satirists my nature

988
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:56,903
and I am

989
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:02,380
now let's go back to this idea that 
human beings need to fulfill immortality

990
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:03,930
or that,
that,

991
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:07,160
that that is our ultimate destiny to 
fulfill and mortality.

992
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,350
What?
What do you mean by that?

993
00:53:09,351 --> 00:53:11,660
Exactly?
Because if there is an afterlife,

994
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,523
right,
if we do die and then we go to this 

995
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:16,430
other place that people are seeing in 
these near death experiences,

996
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:17,683
why do we have to do anything?
Why can't we just sit around and wait 

997
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:23,930
for physical meet body to stop working 
and then transcend?

998
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,610
Well,
this is again,

999
00:53:26,611 --> 00:53:27,444
this gets addressed and,
and David's book and the Dead Saints 

1000
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:31,740
Chronicles,
um,

1001
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,220
because it's our job to transcend.
In other words,

1002
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:37,590
if we don't do anything,
well,

1003
00:53:37,591 --> 00:53:39,000
something happens to us.
And again,

1004
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:40,463
here's where the,
the near death experiences get 

1005
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:45,360
interesting because almost none of them 
are negative.

1006
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:50,630
What happens to the real evil monster 
people that are out there in this world?

1007
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:52,740
I mean,
the Dick Cheney got to heaven.

1008
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:53,970
They,
if he talks,

1009
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:55,980
I don't want to be there.
Totally hilarious.

1010
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,530
I'm imagining if

1011
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,950
to having like tick fucking Cheney's up 
here and you gotta be kidding me,

1012
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,670
man.
I've done so much.

1013
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,980
I mean,
he's in the special waterboarding.

1014
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:09,660
Well,
maybe he just,

1015
00:54:09,661 --> 00:54:10,770
you know,
realizes it yet.

1016
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:11,970
No,
but seriously,

1017
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,163
this is the purpose.
You'd never know it from listening to 

1018
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:17,490
these guys.
This is the purpose of religion.

1019
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,620
It's a,
it's a practice.

1020
00:54:19,621 --> 00:54:22,290
It's not something you believe in.
It's something that you do.

1021
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,960
And if you don't do it,
you don't,

1022
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:25,853
unless you go through an Nde and you 
come back and you start doing it in one 

1023
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:29,724
way or another.
But it's my own personal conviction is 

1024
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:39,381
that unless enough people are doing this
and getting somewhere with it,

1025
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:41,520
it's not as though everyone's going to 
become enlightened.

1026
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:42,354
They probably aren't gotten going to 
deep into the whole theories of 

1027
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:49,380
reincarnation and returned and so on,
which is part of Egypt and part of this,

1028
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,870
all of the eastern cultures,
reincarnation,

1029
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:55,650
no chances are you don't make it in one 
lifetime.

1030
00:54:55,651 --> 00:55:00,651
But these things,
let's say there's a report card,

1031
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,360
is a divine report card where these 
things are measured.

1032
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,950
I mean Jesus says in so far heard some 
in the Bible.

1033
00:55:08,951 --> 00:55:12,090
This is a more as a scholarly morass and
I,

1034
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:17,290
I usually try to avoid using it as,
as evidenced with things because it's so

1035
00:55:17,371 --> 00:55:18,204
open to interpretation and it's so 
convoluted to begin with and who knows 

1036
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,880
what's original to it and what isn't.
But you know,

1037
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:25,650
many are called,
few are chosen,

1038
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:26,963
but those who are called who do their 
work or who tried to do their work 

1039
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:31,703
reaped the benefit of that on an 
internal level that the crack epidemic 

1040
00:55:36,481 --> 00:55:39,690
can't measure and don't want to measure 
and don't believe can be measured.

1041
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:40,943
But somebody with a presence is very 
different from somebody without any 

1042
00:55:43,621 --> 00:55:44,454
presence at all.
We see that in the world around you as 

1043
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:47,230
you go.

1044
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:49,740
I want to bring you back around though 
because I'm still confused.

1045
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:53,470
What do you mean by it's our goal to 
achieve in,

1046
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,700
uh,
in mortality?

1047
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,613
Like what do you mean by that?
Do you mean like the physical body no 

1048
00:55:57,421 --> 00:56:00,150
longer dies and it,
do you believe that?

1049
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,170
Like,
well,

1050
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,480
whatever I read,
I do not remember what I read,

1051
00:56:03,481 --> 00:56:04,314
but what I read about the early,
the earliest depictions of the pharaohs 

1052
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,340
that was,
that they lived and extraordinary length

1053
00:56:11,341 --> 00:56:13,710
of time,
similar to like noah,

1054
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,390
like Noah in the,
uh,

1055
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,600
in the Bible was 600 years old when he 
built the art.

1056
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:19,860
Correct.
Something like that.

1057
00:56:19,861 --> 00:56:21,300
Something like that.
Um,

1058
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,740
and that this is a,
a common thing.

1059
00:56:23,741 --> 00:56:24,070
And now

1060
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:28,030
know is this,
because the way we think of time,

1061
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,013
they had a different interpretation of 
it and what 600 years is to us is not 

1062
00:56:32,591 --> 00:56:34,510
600 years to them.
Is it like,

1063
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,553
like in the Quran when they talk about 
72 virgins that well you know when they 

1064
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:43,330
expression 72 virgins is not really 72 
what that with 72 virgins means.

1065
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:45,580
Well it's interesting cause it's 72 
again,

1066
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,530
what it means is a large,
it's like a shit load.

1067
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,413
Like someone saying a shit load,
you'll have 72 virgins and having like 

1068
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:52,061
Whoa,
Whoa,

1069
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:53,540
am I gonna do it all them,
you know,

1070
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,450
it's just a,
a large number.

1071
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:56,284
It's,
it's the,

1072
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,670
the actual,
it's not,

1073
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:02,860
it's not the actual number 72 it's just 
sort of a euphemism for a large number.

1074
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:03,723
That's one of the theories of all of 
those different strange numbers in the 

1075
00:57:06,371 --> 00:57:07,204
Bible.
And I don't know any better than anyone 

1076
00:57:08,411 --> 00:57:12,840
else as far as I know the pharaohs lived
ordinary lifespans and of course there's

1077
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:13,683
no evidence,
physical evidence of the pharaohs does 

1078
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:17,653
Nacho do.
And when the wine rule has ruled and 

1079
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,550
the,
I'm so hard when they ruled,

1080
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,150
there's none of that.
And we simply don't know.

1081
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,680
The Tibetans have accounts if you want 
to believe that Tibetans and I tend to,

1082
00:57:29,681 --> 00:57:34,681
I don't see why they should lie of great
lamas who live several hundred years and

1083
00:57:34,781 --> 00:57:37,060
go when they choose to.
I don't know.

1084
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:41,280
Simple as that.
And actually it's a,

1085
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,990
it's a,
you might say it's,

1086
00:57:43,991 --> 00:57:44,510
uh,
it's,

1087
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:47,380
it's,
it's no more than a kind of mental,

1088
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,360
it's an interesting hypothesis like 
bigfoot,

1089
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,333
but who cares?
I'm the only thing that actually counts 

1090
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:54,940
as the inner work.

1091
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,010
And if you're doing it,
you're doing it.

1092
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,970
And if you're not doing it and you don't
measure yourself either,

1093
00:58:00,971 --> 00:58:04,900
as soon as you are looking for results,
that's already a way of not getting them

1094
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,133
very,
it's a very delicate and yet profound 

1095
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,940
subject.
And she got to a good zen master.

1096
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,980
This stuff is still around there.
There are,

1097
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:16,990
there are mass.
There's my own,

1098
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:17,913
my own focus as you probably know or 
maybe you don't because the gird Jeff 

1099
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,590
Work of the cross when I came across 
guard javelin,

1100
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:24,463
extraordinary character,
he was the first person I'd ever 

1101
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:27,814
encountered posthumously.
He died in 49 and I found out about his 

1102
00:58:30,521 --> 00:58:32,530
work in the 60s,
um,

1103
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:36,490
who was as contemptuous of Western 
civilization as I was.

1104
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:40,930
The difference was that he knew how to 
live in it and I didn't end at a certain

1105
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:44,580
point point I figured out particularly 
where you're talking about before the,

1106
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,050
the,
the my life in the trenches.

1107
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,340
Good subtitle for something.

1108
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:53,550
I still don't understand what you mean 
about achieving in mortality.

1109
00:58:53,551 --> 00:58:55,680
So if you're not talking about physical 
inventory,

1110
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,553
we mortality,
you're not talking about someone living 

1111
00:58:57,601 --> 00:59:00,710
in a thousand years and plus absolutely.
What are you talking about?

1112
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,580
You're talking about the ideas that 
they,

1113
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,560
they promote transcending and

1114
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,833
no,
I'm talking about a level of 

1115
00:59:07,601 --> 00:59:12,100
consciousness that transcends death.
The body dies.

1116
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:17,490
And that understanding is that that 
understanding is where you are.

1117
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:20,463
I mean the drugs do that.
You have these moments that with the 

1118
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:24,950
body you come back cause he got ahead of
the trip.

1119
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:26,610
Let's say it's,
it's,

1120
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:30,680
it's an eternal trip.
And the ancients talk about that all the

1121
00:59:30,681 --> 00:59:33,980
time.
Even even in their mythology,

1122
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,830
which it was always taken this as 
fanciful,

1123
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:39,010
let's say in the pyramid texts,
the,

1124
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,390
the script reads that the,
the,

1125
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,460
when the Pharaoh dies and the Pharaoh 
being,

1126
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:47,540
let's say the embodiment of the realized
and enlightened sold.

1127
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:51,170
When the Pharaoh dies,
his bar unites with his car,

1128
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,880
his spirit unites with his essence,
becomes a star.

1129
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:56,933
What star and traveled with raw across 
the sky and his boat of millions of 

1130
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,750
years.
This is an in fact,

1131
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:09,290
I've often wondered if the Egyptians 
actually knew what he was being,

1132
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:10,303
what they were talking about.
And the stars themselves are the 

1133
01:00:12,531 --> 01:00:17,531
realizations of enlightened souls.
It's as good as any other ex explanation

1134
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:18,410
that,
that,

1135
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,510
that,
that there's simply balls of gas.

1136
01:00:20,511 --> 01:00:21,344
How did that get there?
That automatically at some point 

1137
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:25,350
accidentally,
um,

1138
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:30,590
coalesce into galaxies and Nebula and 
universes and the whole thing goes on.

1139
01:00:31,011 --> 01:00:32,390
Meaninglessly.
Um,

1140
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,360
well I don't think anybody thinks it's 
meaningless,

1141
01:00:34,361 --> 01:00:36,850
but it is kind of fascinating that stars
themselves.

1142
01:00:36,851 --> 01:00:40,150
So the only reason why people are alive,
we are made of stardust,

1143
01:00:40,151 --> 01:00:40,984
which has just where you are in deed.
Incredible to think that the seeds of 

1144
01:00:43,781 --> 01:00:48,781
human life and all carbon life in fact 
come from a star exploding like wow.

1145
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:52,240
Like everything that you see,
like the sun,

1146
01:00:52,241 --> 01:00:55,660
the sun is a seed for future life.
That's bananas.

1147
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:56,860
Exactly that.
Yeah.

1148
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,833
Well that,
that you've answered your own question 

1149
01:00:59,941 --> 01:01:01,200
as it were,
that,

1150
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:02,093
that,
that,

1151
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,940
that understanding and that,
I wouldn't even call it a philosophy,

1152
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,300
it's an understanding by people who 
understand more than we do.

1153
01:01:09,301 --> 01:01:10,380
Certainly more than I do,

1154
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,673
but isn't it?
But if you say that's our goal to 

1155
01:01:13,521 --> 01:01:15,060
achieve in mortality,
that sounds,

1156
01:01:15,061 --> 01:01:17,320
it sounds like we're going to get it 
anyway no matter what.

1157
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:18,970
Well,
no,

1158
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,930
actually with the nds know what had I,
not really,

1159
01:01:22,931 --> 01:01:23,890
no,
they,

1160
01:01:23,891 --> 01:01:25,030
they've,
they've had their,

1161
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:28,240
their experience,
they've had their x number of minutes of

1162
01:01:28,241 --> 01:01:29,074
grace and come back and come back 
transformed and realize that they have 

1163
01:01:34,661 --> 01:01:37,810
to live their lives differently.
They don't even talk about,

1164
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,710
you know,
about the,

1165
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,510
the future or anything like that.
I mean,

1166
01:01:40,511 --> 01:01:41,344
this is a very,
obviously a very big thing that not 

1167
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:45,034
many,
that not many people ever densely 

1168
01:01:47,741 --> 01:01:49,690
achieved,
but the effort,

1169
01:01:49,691 --> 01:01:53,810
like everything else,
the effort is the effort and it's,

1170
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,480
it's on the scorecard.
It's like,

1171
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,633
it's not so different from everybody who
picks up a vial then isn't going to end 

1172
01:02:01,511 --> 01:02:02,344
up in [inaudible] in Carnegie Hall and 
everyone who picks up a baseball bat 

1173
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:08,710
isn't going to play center field for the
mets or any other team.

1174
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:09,903
It's,
but it's the effort that counts and 

1175
01:02:12,221 --> 01:02:13,054
it's,
it's a certain kind of directed and 

1176
01:02:14,741 --> 01:02:18,820
intelligent effort that is painful in 
its own way,

1177
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:21,090
but,
but carries its own reward.

1178
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:21,983
And it,
it manifests in a kind of presence and 

1179
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:32,130
just in our daily lives,
even with people who are not consciously

1180
01:02:32,131 --> 01:02:34,920
doing it,
but they're doing it,

1181
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:40,350
they have a different level of presence 
and you notice it when you meet them.

1182
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:42,000
Hmm.
Now.

1183
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:46,740
What is it that you think these ancient 
Egyptians,

1184
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:47,603
when you're talking about the earliest 
Egyptians that you believe how to 

1185
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:52,680
achieve this incredible state of mind or
consciousness,

1186
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:55,890
what is it that you think that they did 
to achieve that?

1187
01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:00,630
Like why were they so advanced?
Why were they so beyond what we think of

1188
01:03:00,631 --> 01:03:01,464
when we think of even the possibility of
a human being living 34 plus thousand 

1189
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:06,860
years ago?
How did that,

1190
01:03:06,861 --> 01:03:08,070
how did they achieve that?

1191
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:10,250
We don't know.
We don't know.

1192
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:12,370
We don't know.
All we can see,

1193
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:17,080
all we can see is the manifestation of 
of what they did.

1194
01:03:17,081 --> 01:03:19,480
When we actually,
when you really understand Egypt,

1195
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:24,070
even to the extent that I do you,
you,

1196
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:25,263
you regarded as miraculous.
He's don't see how beings ostensibly 

1197
01:03:28,961 --> 01:03:29,794
like ourselves should even imagine such 
things much less be able to do it and 

1198
01:03:34,931 --> 01:03:37,040
this is what I'll pitch my trip.
Okay.

1199
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:38,853
I often start a lecture off by saying 
that Egypt is like sex that gets 

1200
01:03:42,311 --> 01:03:44,800
everybody's attention.
Why is it like Sachs?

1201
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:50,510
Because you can read books about it and 
that's inflammation.

1202
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,510
All of sorts.
You can look at pictures.

1203
01:03:52,511 --> 01:03:55,060
That's a different kind or a different 
level of information.

1204
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:57,750
But until you've experienced it,
you,

1205
01:03:57,850 --> 01:04:02,850
you do not and cannot understand it.
And Egypt is like that magically,

1206
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:08,440
that magical leads up series is as close
as anyone has ever come to communicating

1207
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:10,263
the,
the wonder and the magic that is Egypt 

1208
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:14,440
as anyone has ever has ever.

1209
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,980
It's way head and shoulders above what 
anybody else has done.

1210
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:21,490
And that's my genius part in their 
chances doing in its entirety.

1211
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:22,324
It's,
you know,

1212
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,150
simple just ideas and I play a big role 
in it,

1213
01:04:25,151 --> 01:04:30,151
but it's early chances baby and the,
the,

1214
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:31,983
uh,
but,

1215
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,220
but at the visit to Egypt at the end of 
a couple of weeks there,

1216
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:39,760
I can talk from now till Doomsday,
which I'm about in the process of doing.

1217
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:45,220
Um,
and nothing,

1218
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,680
nothing that I say,
can you come,

1219
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:52,570
can come even remotely close to what 
it's like to be two weeks in Egypt,

1220
01:04:52,571 --> 01:04:56,830
day after day after day after day in the
presence of,

1221
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:00,010
of sacred art,
of this,

1222
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:03,400
of this quality.
And there's nowhere else in on the left.

1223
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:05,860
I mean,
I'm sure that China and India and all of

1224
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:08,890
these places had not pyramids and not 
that kind of structure.

1225
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:11,060
The nature of Egypt,
it's strange.

1226
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:12,023
It's a kind of freak of nature as it 
were at all desert except this little 

1227
01:05:15,701 --> 01:05:16,660
strip of,
of,

1228
01:05:16,661 --> 01:05:17,494
of,
and then the delta that until recently 

1229
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:24,190
was impenetrable swamp.
So it's practically unattainable.

1230
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:29,820
And the food denial floods and the food 
jumps out of the ground and under the,

1231
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:32,730
under the,
with,

1232
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:33,570
with,
with,

1233
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:34,403
uh,
with a series of genuinely enlightened 

1234
01:05:39,341 --> 01:05:40,174
rulers,
or at least pretty close to enlightened 

1235
01:05:41,691 --> 01:05:45,190
drill is ruling them.
That all lasts for 3,500

1236
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,110
years.
And how did they live?

1237
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,880
You see everything that they did.
In fact,

1238
01:05:48,881 --> 01:05:49,714
until quite recently,
there were no such things as jobs that 

1239
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:57,430
were trades and crafts and skills and 
arts and everybody.

1240
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:58,390
I mean,
yes,

1241
01:05:58,630 --> 01:05:59,463
and in Europe that the combination of a 
repressive church and then oppressive 

1242
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:08,030
nobility kept everybody,
you know,

1243
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,480
immersed in serfdom in one way or 
another.

1244
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:11,613
But what people actually did with that 
lives was in some sense or another 

1245
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:16,900
transformational,
all of it.

1246
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,490
It takes a lot of smarts to be a good 
patent.

1247
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,510
All of these things that people used to 
do as a matter of course,

1248
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:23,560
and in Egypt,
you see it,

1249
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:26,043
you'll see it carved into the walls and 
everyone thinks these are the scenes of 

1250
01:06:28,481 --> 01:06:31,240
daily life.
While they are scenes of daily life with

1251
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:34,420
the decodable as transformational 
activities.

1252
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,450
So anything that you do,
and boy,

1253
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:41,770
you're doing marshal your martial arts.
This is a highly developed skill.

1254
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:45,740
You will are somebody that you wouldn't 
be if you were,

1255
01:06:45,741 --> 01:06:46,574
didn't have that scale.
If you were doing a full podcast and 

1256
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:52,150
what you did for a living was flipping 
burgers at Mcdonald's,

1257
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,760
you wouldn't be Joe Rogan.
You've,

1258
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:55,690
you've,
you've,

1259
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:56,613
you've been doing your homework without 
maybe even thinking that it was 

1260
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:00,940
homework.
Cause any,

1261
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:01,774
anything that you're involved in that,
that you go at with a quest for 

1262
01:07:08,381 --> 01:07:12,820
perfection of whatever it is,
has this transformational value.

1263
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,710
And when you recognize,
when you know it,

1264
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,930
let's say,
when you know it intellectually,

1265
01:07:16,931 --> 01:07:20,350
when you can articulate it,
it doesn't fit,

1266
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,640
it implements the actually the activity 
itself.

1267
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,620
So what's possible even to do that?
You could be an,

1268
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,380
or you could be an enlightened burger 
flipper and the sewer fees are very good

1269
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:32,950
at,
you know,

1270
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:37,890
the sophie is in life,
but not as enlarged by sorry,

1271
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,480
is in life,
but not have it.

1272
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,440
In other words,
you can,

1273
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:44,740
you can practice waking up as it were,
uh,

1274
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,950
in the midst of the most mundane thing 
you could be.

1275
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:50,170
You could,
you could be an enlightened garbage,

1276
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:54,340
garbage collector as long as you knew 
what you were doing.

1277
01:07:54,341 --> 01:07:57,040
It's a totally different thing.
I would imagine.

1278
01:07:57,041 --> 01:07:58,360
I'm not a cop.
It's collected.

1279
01:07:58,750 --> 01:07:59,583
That's a totally different thing to 
collect the garbage consciously than it 

1280
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:04,000
is to just do it.

1281
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,940
Resentfully because that's the only job 
that they can get all the right.

1282
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:10,690
So when,
when we talking,

1283
01:08:10,691 --> 01:08:12,040
it's,
it's not as though this is,

1284
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:16,670
it's not as though this is anything 
actually new.

1285
01:08:16,671 --> 01:08:19,310
It's is,
that's the oldest idea that ever was.

1286
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:20,413
And it's something that people have been
doing for thousands and thousands of 

1287
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,410
years.
That said,

1288
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:30,310
going into the whole thing of precession
and the and the and the ages,

1289
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,860
particularly as expressed plato,
they have the golden age,

1290
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,660
silver age,
Bronze Age,

1291
01:08:35,661 --> 01:08:36,494
and an iron age.
The Hindus do it and rather more 

1292
01:08:39,321 --> 01:08:40,154
sophisticated fashion.
I forget exactly the name there on the 

1293
01:08:42,171 --> 01:08:44,930
tip of my tongue of,
of those ages,

1294
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,210
but if they have,
they are,

1295
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,193
let's say analogous to our seasons,
particularly if you live where I do and 

1296
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:55,010
not in California where it's all one 
season,

1297
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:59,120
but the seasons,
the guarantees at the Yugas,

1298
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:00,140
the Yugas and that's right.

1299
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,720
It's,
it's if,

1300
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,370
if,
if,

1301
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:06,230
if there,
compared to the seasons,

1302
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:11,210
it's a very different thing to grow 
roses in June than it is in January.

1303
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:15,110
It's the same effort when you're talking
about the people you know,

1304
01:09:15,111 --> 01:09:19,340
at waking up and all of the rest of it.
This is a dark age.

1305
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:20,263
I mean this is,
this is the Kali Yoga as far as I'm 

1306
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:23,414
concerned to do anything.
I just have a spiritual nature now with 

1307
01:09:28,641 --> 01:09:29,474
all of these forces,
with all of these forces lined up 

1308
01:09:32,061 --> 01:09:33,800
against you.
And not consciously of course,

1309
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:36,500
but unconsciously it's,
it's an,

1310
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:41,510
it's an incredibly difficult thing to 
actually practice a genuine,

1311
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:45,200
the genuine spiritual doctrine.
First of all,

1312
01:09:45,201 --> 01:09:46,034
they have to get interested in it.
And that's the only that small chunk of 

1313
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:50,360
it of us.
And then you have to try to do it,

1314
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,640
and you have the time.
You have to have the folklore,

1315
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,430
the time and the focus,
the,

1316
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:55,653
that's right.
The focus and the weld and all the rest 

1317
01:09:57,071 --> 01:09:58,900
of the things and that.
So that's,

1318
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:04,320
so growing roses in January takes a lot 
more effort than to get to the same rows

1319
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:09,850
than it takes in June when the jumping 
out of the ground.

1320
01:10:09,851 --> 01:10:11,620
So my guess is,
and it's only gas,

1321
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:16,640
it's speculation that in these higher 
levels of these higher periods of,

1322
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:20,260
of know Golden,
silver,

1323
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:23,170
bronze and so on,
it's just much easier.

1324
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:28,200
It is much easier for people to 
recognize what's demanded of them and to

1325
01:10:29,831 --> 01:10:32,050
do it than it is in the middle of,
uh,

1326
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:32,890
of,
uh,

1327
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:33,700
of,
uh,

1328
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:37,810
from a spiritual point of view of 
spiritual but brightly lit,

1329
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,190
brightly an illuminated but brightly 
lit,

1330
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:43,540
dark,
dark age.

1331
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:44,261
Well,
if you,

1332
01:10:44,261 --> 01:10:44,870
where we are,

1333
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:45,703
if you look at the influence that Egypt 
had clearly on Greece and clearly on a 

1334
01:10:48,921 --> 01:10:53,060
lot of other civilizations where people 
literally came to Egypt to learn,

1335
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:57,980
if each app wasn't there,
what would civilization be like?

1336
01:10:57,981 --> 01:10:58,814
I mean,
it's such a unique place in that 

1337
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:01,813
there's,
there's really no where that you can 

1338
01:11:03,951 --> 01:11:04,784
compare that has the level of 
sophistication as far as the structures 

1339
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:10,720
and the ancient in the ancient world has
not even,

1340
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:11,660
I mean,
it's almost like they're,

1341
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,240
what they created was undeniable.
Hmm.

1342
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,450
Like,
I think Giza,

1343
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:19,020
the Great Pyramid of Giza as 2 million,
300,000

1344
01:11:19,021 --> 01:11:21,810
stones,
they way between two and 80 tons.

1345
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:25,110
Like what?
Like how that's insane.

1346
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:26,303
Like the,
there's the level of sophistication and 

1347
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:29,700
creating something like that.
I mean,

1348
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:33,090
I've only seen it in photographs,
but one of the greatest photographs I've

1349
01:11:33,091 --> 01:11:36,780
ever seen is from someone with a gopro 
standing on the top of it.

1350
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:37,913
So you get this kind of a,
you get a sense of how immense it 

1351
01:11:41,221 --> 01:11:42,180
really,
truly is.

1352
01:11:42,181 --> 01:11:43,590
Yeah.
And you just think about how,

1353
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,310
how incredible that must have been when,
especially when it's covered with smooth

1354
01:11:47,311 --> 01:11:49,980
limestone in four,
they cut it all off.

1355
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:51,210
I mean,
what,

1356
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:52,043
what you're seeing is it's,
it's an undeniable mastery of physical 

1357
01:11:56,611 --> 01:12:00,510
things to the point where you just,
it makes you just,

1358
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:03,060
it makes your head spin because we,
I mean,

1359
01:12:03,061 --> 01:12:05,220
people say we can do that today.
Well,

1360
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:06,083
okay,
maybe we kind of understand that it's 

1361
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:10,950
been done and that we,
we can do pretty immense things.

1362
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,100
We have some pretty incredible tractors 
and machines and everything like that.

1363
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:16,360
But they didn't have those.
No.

1364
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,430
As far as we know,

1365
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,960
they didn't have those.
They might've had something else.

1366
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,910
What do you think they had?
I don't know.

1367
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,170
I mean,
do you think about,

1368
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:25,940
do just,
do you have like some hypothesis,

1369
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:28,360
some theories in your head about the 
construction methods?

1370
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:34,170
Some a bit that,
that actually from Tibet.

1371
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:38,280
There's actually a funny little book 
I've done some lectures at,

1372
01:12:38,281 --> 01:12:39,930
at uh,
um,

1373
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,310
what is it called,
um,

1374
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,740
in Joshua tree,
you know,

1375
01:12:43,741 --> 01:12:45,140
about that event?
Um,

1376
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:46,403
it's a contact in the desert.
They're mostly interested in the UFO 

1377
01:12:49,591 --> 01:12:53,010
phenomenon and stuff like that.
But the place itself,

1378
01:12:53,011 --> 01:12:58,011
Joshua retreat center is founded by a 
very interesting guy who was sort of the

1379
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:00,871
Tibetan Krishnamurti.
In other words,

1380
01:13:00,871 --> 01:13:03,570
it's an interesting little book he wrote
and terribly written,

1381
01:13:03,571 --> 01:13:06,870
but his,
his studies in Tibet.

1382
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,390
And at the end of his little book he's 
talking about,

1383
01:13:09,391 --> 01:13:10,224
he studying with the,
with the llamas he just described 

1384
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:17,100
certain of the certain of the things he 
has seen them do.

1385
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:19,890
And I see no particular reason to 
dismiss what he says.

1386
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:24,000
He's talking from experience and it has 
the ring of veracity to it.

1387
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:26,360
And he talks about,
um,

1388
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:31,140
going into an underground chamber that 
has no lights or electricity or anything

1389
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:31,950
like that.

1390
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:34,350
That's all lit up.
And actually go to Egypt.

1391
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:37,620
We have these deep,
deep shaft tombs that go down and around

1392
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:39,300
and all like this.
And people say,

1393
01:13:39,301 --> 01:13:40,770
well,
how did they light the thing up?

1394
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:41,903
Can't have had torches or would have,
it would have used up all of the oxygen 

1395
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,640
and it would have smoked up the ceilings
and all the rest of it.

1396
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,200
When people say,
well mirrors,

1397
01:13:49,201 --> 01:13:53,280
no mirrors will do and then you need 
silvered mirror is for that to go around

1398
01:13:53,281 --> 01:13:54,114
corners there other gypsy caves in 
Seville that are four or five rooms in 

1399
01:13:57,751 --> 01:14:01,260
that are lit with mirrors from on top.
But no,

1400
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,240
somehow,
and I used to joke and say,

1401
01:14:03,241 --> 01:14:04,074
well you know,
they had an inner light and joking but 

1402
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:08,910
maybe that's what,
maybe that's what it was.

1403
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,890
But the producers and talks about other

1404
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:13,023
Lama's,
these witness doing incredible feats of 

1405
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,273
that you couldn't do,
you know that you just couldn't do in 

1406
01:14:20,051 --> 01:14:23,470
your ordinary state.
Probably you as a martial artist,

1407
01:14:23,471 --> 01:14:28,120
I've had moments or witnessed people who
can do things that are for anybody else.

1408
01:14:28,121 --> 01:14:29,320
Impossible.
Yeah,

1409
01:14:29,321 --> 01:14:32,110
but they don't light up tunnel snow.
They don't light up tunnel.

1410
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:33,250
But,
but they can do,

1411
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:35,350
they can do physical things that,
that are,

1412
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:38,260
that are,
they're extraordinary.

1413
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:42,490
They're almost miraculous that nobody 
else could do them.

1414
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:43,210
Yeah.
But that,

1415
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:44,043
that's a,
it's a really important point where 

1416
01:14:45,251 --> 01:14:46,084
you're saying about the construction 
methods that they used where they did 

1417
01:14:49,531 --> 01:14:53,550
have these long tunnels and these 
passages and these places,

1418
01:14:53,551 --> 01:14:54,384
but somehow or another,
they managed to navigate these things 

1419
01:14:57,331 --> 01:15:01,440
without leaving any marks or soot from,
from torches,

1420
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:05,940
which are everywhere else where people 
use candles or anywhere else.

1421
01:15:05,941 --> 01:15:06,810
Like,
you know,

1422
01:15:06,811 --> 01:15:10,170
you didn't the Sistine Chapel,
like the entire ceiling was covered with

1423
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:10,741
some,
you know,

1424
01:15:10,741 --> 01:15:11,574
they had to clean it,
to prepare it so people could see it 

1425
01:15:14,311 --> 01:15:15,990
again.
But that's,

1426
01:15:15,991 --> 01:15:16,824
um,
that's really fascinating to think that 

1427
01:15:18,151 --> 01:15:18,984
they had some other method of 
illumination that we just haven't 

1428
01:15:21,361 --> 01:15:22,194
discovered yet.
We don't know what they did or how they 

1429
01:15:23,281 --> 01:15:23,720
did it.

1430
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,553
That's one thing.
But you look at a jillion other things 

1431
01:15:27,021 --> 01:15:28,610
when you particularly,
this is again,

1432
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:31,060
one of the reasons why the swinks theory
is,

1433
01:15:31,061 --> 01:15:31,894
is so is so contentious to these,
so dangerous to these guys because the 

1434
01:15:36,171 --> 01:15:38,270
swings,
carving the spanx is one thing,

1435
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:39,343
but okay,
limestones are relatively resilient 

1436
01:15:42,051 --> 01:15:44,210
stones.
Are you relatively soft stone enough?

1437
01:15:44,211 --> 01:15:47,450
Guys with chisels,
even if they're copper chiseled could do

1438
01:15:47,451 --> 01:15:49,730
that given enough time and enough 
genius.

1439
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:53,510
But the temple die the side of it,
um,

1440
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:59,200
and are built of stones half the size of
this room slotted into place like pieces

1441
01:16:00,411 --> 01:16:04,220
of a jigsaw puzzle.
This is unbelievable.

1442
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:06,410
And again,
what you just said is really important.

1443
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,880
Copper,
copper tools,

1444
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:10,190
that's what they think.
Copper tempered with arsenic.

1445
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:11,323
I mean that.
But those same copper tools to 

1446
01:16:13,521 --> 01:16:17,630
supposedly are supposedly used for,
for carving the granite,

1447
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:18,973
the,
if you go to Egypt actually usually get 

1448
01:16:20,771 --> 01:16:21,770
you a huge audience.

1449
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:22,603
Got to Juggle Rogan,
trip together and come on to people 

1450
01:16:25,071 --> 01:16:28,130
listening to this podcast.
We'll have a test.

1451
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:29,833
Too many fruits,
well 90% of them would be great to 10% 

1452
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,110
will keep out the 10%.
It's just do it,

1453
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:37,170
do it.
Prepare,

1454
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:38,453
filter.
Okay.

1455
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:40,870
Conversation with them.
Prepare a filter,

1456
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:42,710
get them in a room,
prepare a filter.

1457
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,650
And how many people when you taking the 
time?

1458
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,790
I have a Max of 24 hmm.
Interesting.

1459
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,870
It's not more than that is an 
unmanageable.

1460
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,333
And when you see it,
I mean one thing after the other and 

1461
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:57,200
it's totally safe to go to Egypt.
Narcan right now.

1462
01:16:57,860 --> 01:16:59,690
Well,
it's a safe as Los Angeles.

1463
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:00,613
I mean,
we were anywhere else here and then 

1464
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,760
didn't Dumbfuckistan it's,
you know,

1465
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:08,900
this is tough work for Americans.
We're Americans too,

1466
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:12,720
of all people to be afraid of going 
somewhere.

1467
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:15,900
We're worried about Islamic terrorism 
more than anything because we then,

1468
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:16,843
it's here.

1469
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:18,103
It's already here.
And Islamic terrorism is itself a tiny 

1470
01:17:21,561 --> 01:17:25,610
little bit of the terrorism that goes on
on a daily basis.

1471
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:26,743
You pick up that you opened the internet
and there's some nutcase kid somewhere 

1472
01:17:30,591 --> 01:17:33,000
or another shooting down a mall.
I mean,

1473
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,210
the terrorist,
the terrorist,

1474
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:40,580
the known terrorists have accounted for.
It's not even the statistic,

1475
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,850
it's an x number of people that they've 
gone after.

1476
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:46,580
But you know,
here,

1477
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:51,170
here in this crazy violent country,
you'll never safe anywhere.

1478
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:53,210
Schools aren't safe,
malls aren't safe.

1479
01:17:53,211 --> 01:17:54,310
What's safe,
right.

1480
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:56,480
So Kira has some nice hotels too,
right?

1481
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:57,710
Oh Great.
Hotels.

1482
01:17:57,711 --> 01:17:58,544
Yeah.
We stay at a place to actually right 

1483
01:17:59,961 --> 01:18:02,300
across a stone's throw from the pyramids
itself.

1484
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,800
So you can look at the pyramid out your 
window.

1485
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:05,990
Yeah.
You can't do that.

1486
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:06,883
Oh boy.

1487
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,420
When I look at,
uh,

1488
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:10,290
the Great Pyramid are,
I look at the,

1489
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,133
uh,
the structure that I've seen online or 

1490
01:18:13,461 --> 01:18:15,230
in your videos or things along those 
lines.

1491
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:20,030
What's shocking to me is how each,
and this is going to be a weird thing to

1492
01:18:20,031 --> 01:18:20,864
say how Egyptian it looks and how Egypt 
stands alone in this very distinctive 

1493
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,540
way and that the,
the construction methods,

1494
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:30,403
the,
that just the intricacy of the building 

1495
01:18:31,911 --> 01:18:33,770
and these pyramids,
I mean,

1496
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:34,783
people talk about the Mayan Pyramids and
I've been to [inaudible] needs and it's 

1497
01:18:36,771 --> 01:18:39,620
an amazing place and it's really 
beautiful and crazy to look at,

1498
01:18:39,621 --> 01:18:42,920
but it pales in comparison to the 
structures of Egypt.

1499
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:46,740
Yeah.
Everything pales in comparison with it.

1500
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,800
How did that happen?
Well as I said,

1501
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:54,120
because it was in a kind of a blessing 
lung.

1502
01:18:54,121 --> 01:18:55,740
It had,
it had a philosophy,

1503
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:56,663
you know,
it had a spiritual philosophy 

1504
01:18:58,291 --> 01:19:01,320
underpinning it that had the,
that had the,

1505
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:04,950
that that had,
you might say that had the,

1506
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:09,570
that united the people in their entirety
doesn't mean that they weren't,

1507
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,453
you know,
criminals and murderers and stuff like 

1508
01:19:11,941 --> 01:19:12,774
that.
But basically the people were united in 

1509
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:16,374
their,
in their faith and delighted in their 

1510
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:21,240
belief errata this when Egypt was sixth 
century BC,

1511
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:26,490
the rod is this,
and Egypt is already in steep decline as

1512
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,460
the Egyptians of the happiest,
healthiest,

1513
01:19:29,461 --> 01:19:30,294
and most religious of people.
That wasn't the Egyptian Chamber of 

1514
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:36,120
Commerce that was telling him to say 
that he was a patriotic Greek,

1515
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:37,403
but it was like that.
And it was a combination of the 

1516
01:19:40,261 --> 01:19:41,094
philosophy wedded to it in a,
in a society that was protected on all 

1517
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:49,710
four sides and almost an almost 
impregnable.

1518
01:19:49,711 --> 01:19:50,544
It was conquered a couple of times over 
the course of 3000 years for a 

1519
01:19:53,461 --> 01:19:56,320
relatively brief period of time,
um,

1520
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:00,720
and the food jumped out of the ground.
The Nile flooded and took practically no

1521
01:20:00,721 --> 01:20:01,554
work and that I made a a quite 
substantial population but gave them 

1522
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,100
months of free time every,

1523
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,140
every year.
And so how did it all go wrong?

1524
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:12,810
That would,
talking about the colleague Ogas,

1525
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:13,733
um,
the whatever that whatever period Egypt 

1526
01:20:17,011 --> 01:20:17,844
is assigned to is on a downhill slope.
It just plain was on a downhill slope 

1527
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:23,363
and you can,
you can watch it transform in front of 

1528
01:20:25,531 --> 01:20:26,790
your eyes.
It,

1529
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:27,853
it disintegrates as a coherent religion 
rises in another form that we call 

1530
01:20:33,631 --> 01:20:34,464
Christianity actually,
and could see it happening in front of 

1531
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:40,260
your nose with Coptic Christianity 
arising.

1532
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:43,660
All the rest of the stuff gets 
completely decadent under the Romans and

1533
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:45,960
syndrome.
What's his name?

1534
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:47,423
Gibbon.
And we'd given in decline and fall of 

1535
01:20:49,321 --> 01:20:52,170
the Roman empire,
talks about the grand jury,

1536
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:54,173
the glory of Greece,
which is absolute nonsense or totally 

1537
01:20:57,140 --> 01:21:00,630
with near total nonsense.
And the Grand Juror Rome.

1538
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:03,060
Yeah.
They were building coliseums and elected

1539
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:07,680
and wanted to torture in order to let 
die gladiators kill each other.

1540
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:11,260
And they built good roads.
But Ron was a three ring bro,

1541
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:15,480
three ring bureaucracy actually.
And that's the beginning of the end.

1542
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,790
And Europe anyway,
it's very traceable.

1543
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:18,883
The the Asian countries less so,
but they too have high civilizations 

1544
01:21:22,951 --> 01:21:23,784
that decline.
And in Europe you see kind of a 

1545
01:21:26,311 --> 01:21:30,270
turnaround in the renaissance,
the very impossible to actually date.

1546
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:34,740
And then you have it leading in a sort 
of,

1547
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,373
in a one very one sided development in 
which in which technology advances by 

1548
01:21:42,421 --> 01:21:43,254
leaps and bounds and everything else is 
arguably a lot worse than it was a 

1549
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:54,720
couple of hundred years ago from us.
From every spiritual psychological point

1550
01:21:54,721 --> 01:21:55,554
of view,
we are a lot worse off than let's say 

1551
01:21:57,451 --> 01:21:58,710
the colonial American.
Yeah.

1552
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:01,850
Steve really thinks so.
The depictions of the colonial Americans

1553
01:22:01,851 --> 01:22:02,960
by,
um,

1554
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:06,090
by the ancient people.
When,

1555
01:22:06,091 --> 01:22:06,621
when,
when you,

1556
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:09,800
uh,
who was it that described the atrocities

1557
01:22:09,801 --> 01:22:12,110
that Columbus and his crude had done?
Um,

1558
01:22:12,111 --> 01:22:13,590
what preacher?
Priest,

1559
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:15,140
no,
loads of the mature,

1560
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:17,180
horrific,
horrific things.

1561
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:18,700
Those are the conquerors.
Yeah.

1562
01:22:18,701 --> 01:22:21,860
We're not talking about the settlers and
the Indians.

1563
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:22,510
Right.
Oh,

1564
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:25,460
and the other,
this already pulled that stuff.

1565
01:22:25,461 --> 01:22:29,780
Montezuma was a piece of shit.
Blotter of 80,000

1566
01:22:29,781 --> 01:22:32,420
slaves after they built Tia to con.
How he say that.

1567
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,530
Te Te,
te Lacan Teal,

1568
01:22:34,531 --> 01:22:38,360
teal con this I don't,
this I don't know about and I don't know

1569
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:39,253
again,
but they say my bad people to loads of 

1570
01:22:42,081 --> 01:22:43,760
bad people that just didn't have the 
Internet

1571
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,333
talking about it.
They certainly didn't have the Internet 

1572
01:22:46,481 --> 01:22:48,790
and lots of other goodies.
They didn't have.

1573
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:50,590
Um,
no,

1574
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:51,424
but that was a certain,
let's say about the populous in general 

1575
01:22:57,610 --> 01:23:01,210
in America.
A certain gravitas about them.

1576
01:23:01,211 --> 01:23:04,240
There's a certain presence that is of 
our great,

1577
01:23:04,241 --> 01:23:06,850
great grandfathers,
well not mine cause they were in Hungary

1578
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:07,750
at that time.
My great,

1579
01:23:07,751 --> 01:23:10,000
great.
But there's a certain,

1580
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:11,590
okay,

1581
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:14,890
sort of,
it's like Emerson self reliance.

1582
01:23:14,891 --> 01:23:15,724
I mean this is,
this is a piece of her I meanwhile of 

1583
01:23:17,381 --> 01:23:18,214
course the weapon,
all the slaves in the south and they're 

1584
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:24,100
murdering all the Indians and the,
and the billionaires as is their fashion

1585
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:26,950
or beating up on their Irish immigrant 
workers.

1586
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,140
That's why perhaps slaves when they can 
mistreat their,

1587
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,320
their work is in build there,
you know,

1588
01:23:32,321 --> 01:23:33,610
and build all of their,
uh,

1589
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:36,880
their railroads across the country.
But nevertheless,

1590
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:38,373
there's a sense of,
they say Grub a test is almost the only 

1591
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:44,394
word I can think of.
Cause it's not as though it's 

1592
01:23:45,181 --> 01:23:47,280
intellectually advanced or anything like
that,

1593
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:48,563
but there's a certain seeming solidity 
to 19th century America then than there 

1594
01:23:56,221 --> 01:23:58,380
is now in this crazy chaos.

1595
01:23:58,530 --> 01:23:59,363
Don't you think that there's always this
tendency in human beings that long from 

1596
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:06,980
front Ostalgie they look back to the 
past to a moment when things made sense.

1597
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,233
It seems to me that there's always that.
And even when people are full of shit 

1598
01:24:09,951 --> 01:24:11,960
about it,
like they look back in high school days,

1599
01:24:11,961 --> 01:24:13,070
man,
those were the good old days.

1600
01:24:13,071 --> 01:24:14,990
Like what are you talking about yet?
Pimples,

1601
01:24:14,991 --> 01:24:16,760
you were out of your fucking mind and 
secure.

1602
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:19,340
You're terrified of the future.
That wasn't the good old days.

1603
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,461
It's true.
Yeah.

1604
01:24:20,461 --> 01:24:22,720
Trump make America great again.
Yeah,

1605
01:24:22,770 --> 01:24:25,830
bring back slavery.
Find some more.

1606
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,710
Until we run out of Indians.
Murder The let's,

1607
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:32,500
let's go to the Arab nations or let's go
out in the Amazon.

1608
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:32,901
Yeah,
hell,

1609
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:36,240
let's import them and murder and let's 
bring back all of that stuff.

1610
01:24:36,241 --> 01:24:37,170
No,
it was never great.

1611
01:24:37,470 --> 01:24:39,630
But as I said,
there's just,

1612
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,160
there is a kind of,

1613
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:44,323
maybe I'm more optimistic.
I think there's an awakening going on 

1614
01:24:46,221 --> 01:24:47,054
right now with human beings that's 
unprecedented and I think it's because 

1615
01:24:49,611 --> 01:24:50,444
of the Internet.
I think because of the fact that we're 

1616
01:24:52,341 --> 01:24:53,174
combining our thoughts and some sort of 
a strange way and sharing ideas and 

1617
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,370
information in a way that no one's ever 
been able to do before.

1618
01:24:58,940 --> 01:24:59,773
I just,
I don't think people who've ever been 

1619
01:25:00,711 --> 01:25:04,250
this aware of how crazy things are.
Uh,

1620
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,113
but at the same time it's lifted the 
lunacy of last night's presidential 

1621
01:25:07,761 --> 01:25:11,030
debate and you realize like,
well I guess we really haven't,

1622
01:25:11,270 --> 01:25:12,103
I mean we might be aware of things but 
actual progress and not really being 

1623
01:25:14,481 --> 01:25:15,314
made.

1624
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:16,233
We,
we have the ability to be aware of 

1625
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:18,850
things.
Yes.

1626
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:19,683
But we are not,
we are not at least in sufficient 

1627
01:25:22,361 --> 01:25:23,194
numbers.

1628
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:24,620
Okay.

1629
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,860
Doing anything like we are,
we are not doing anything about it.

1630
01:25:27,861 --> 01:25:30,320
And that's the crux of the matter.
It's one thing.

1631
01:25:30,321 --> 01:25:31,154
This is why intellectual spiritual,
intellectual mysticism is a total waste 

1632
01:25:36,981 --> 01:25:38,480
of time.
Only the,

1633
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:40,910
it's like intellectual violin playing.
No,

1634
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:44,030
he got to play the violin or it's not 
music.

1635
01:25:44,330 --> 01:25:44,871
Right.
So,

1636
01:25:44,871 --> 01:25:48,710
so thinking about Egypt is not great.
The ability,

1637
01:25:48,711 --> 01:25:49,700
well that,
yes.

1638
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,950
The ability to

1639
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:53,670
yeah.

1640
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:54,503
To,
to get information is now absolutely 

1641
01:25:56,771 --> 01:25:57,820
unparalleled.
Yeah.

1642
01:25:57,821 --> 01:25:58,420
There's,
there's no,

1643
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,253
as far as we know,
there's never been anything remotely 

1644
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:03,230
like this.
If the same time there's never been that

1645
01:26:03,231 --> 01:26:04,064
much static.

1646
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:07,080
So it was,
hey we were talking about earlier the,

1647
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:07,933
you know the,
the crystals sniffers in the Unicorns 

1648
01:26:10,281 --> 01:26:13,640
and the ancient aliens.
This is,

1649
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:14,503
this is all a vast amount of static.
So you have to be able to find a way 

1650
01:26:18,021 --> 01:26:21,770
that you have to find your way through 
the static to the music.

1651
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,690
How much is ancient aliens frustrated?
Yeah.

1652
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:25,083
Cause as much,
cause I know I watched a couple of 

1653
01:26:26,391 --> 01:26:27,224
programs did,
he's throwing things at the TV and I 

1654
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:33,860
have low expectations.
So it's TV.

1655
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:34,694
It's supposed to,
it's entertainment than the people who 

1656
01:26:36,381 --> 01:26:38,120
are putting it together.
You know,

1657
01:26:38,121 --> 01:26:40,910
don't know what they're doing except 
they see that it works.

1658
01:26:40,911 --> 01:26:44,200
Then they want to make money.
Is it possible that he

1659
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:47,950
aliens made the Pyramids?
I want to have all these experts.

1660
01:26:47,951 --> 01:26:49,690
Everything in is,
is it possible?

1661
01:26:49,691 --> 01:26:52,750
That extra terrestrials I guess that's 
possible.

1662
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:53,371
Yeah.
Through I will.

1663
01:26:53,371 --> 01:26:54,204
It is possible.
And Georgia of course pushed into a 

1664
01:26:56,071 --> 01:26:58,890
corner says yeah,
all of this and that and so on.

1665
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:00,660
Still it's aliens.

1666
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:01,600
Georgia.
So close.

1667
01:27:01,601 --> 01:27:02,280
Yeah.
He's,

1668
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,670
he's beautiful.
I love that guy.

1669
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,590
He's a funny guy.
He's a funny guy.

1670
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:06,633
Um,
w when you think of ancient Egypt and 

1671
01:27:10,541 --> 01:27:11,530
you,
you think of the,

1672
01:27:11,531 --> 01:27:14,470
the public's understanding and awareness
of it,

1673
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:17,380
what do you think the average person is 
missing?

1674
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:20,400
All of it.
All of it,

1675
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:22,050
basically.
Yeah.

1676
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,273
So you think it's like right before our 
fate in front of our eyes and most 

1677
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:29,390
people just have no idea the majesty and
how intensely unique it is.

1678
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:29,961
Oh,
look,

1679
01:27:29,961 --> 01:27:32,420
our mystery of the Spanx,
which at that time,

1680
01:27:32,421 --> 01:27:36,530
one of the most,
one of the most watched TV documentaries

1681
01:27:36,531 --> 01:27:37,364
of all time,
and I really had a massive audience and 

1682
01:27:39,711 --> 01:27:41,840
people who saw it,
remember it?

1683
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:43,040
I mean,
even to this day,

1684
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:45,290
um,
you saw it.

1685
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:46,520
Oh,
you did?

1686
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:47,353
Okay.
I have a vhs cassette tape of it serve 

1687
01:27:49,071 --> 01:27:51,320
really late.
I brought it.

1688
01:27:51,321 --> 01:27:52,220
Wait,
did I bring it?

1689
01:27:52,230 --> 01:27:54,740
I'd forget if I brought you the way I'm 
gonna get it online now.

1690
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,103
Might be on youth on DVD.
I was going to bring you a DVD of it 

1691
01:27:58,251 --> 01:27:59,084
actually,
but I've maybe for kind of almost 

1692
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:01,460
memorized it.
Well,

1693
01:28:01,461 --> 01:28:02,294
that's good.
And I've seen anyway quite a few times 

1694
01:28:03,261 --> 01:28:08,060
that had a certain impact for sure.
Even if 30 million people saw it,

1695
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:11,990
300 minutes didn't,
right.

1696
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:13,003
And then going there,
it's really what's up and well that's 

1697
01:28:15,321 --> 01:28:16,920
the,
that's that's the big crunch.

1698
01:28:16,921 --> 01:28:19,730
And that only x number of people can go 
there.

1699
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:22,000
I went to the Vatican last summer.
Yeah.

1700
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:23,150
This past summer.
Um,

1701
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:25,200
my first time ever in Italy.
And uh,

1702
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,720
I had seen it on television before.
Obviously I'd seen videos and stuff.

1703
01:28:28,721 --> 01:28:30,370
I've seen photos.
Boy,

1704
01:28:30,371 --> 01:28:33,280
when you're there and you're,
you're like,

1705
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:35,230
what does it,
St Peter's Basilica.

1706
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:36,820
St Paul's.

1707
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:38,010
Saint Paul's.
No,

1708
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:39,850
Paul's St Paul's.
Wait,

1709
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:40,803
one of those guys.
And now Miss [inaudible] at Saint 

1710
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:45,550
Peter's is okay.
It is with the Dome,

1711
01:28:45,551 --> 01:28:46,690
with a Buffalo.
It comes out.

1712
01:28:46,691 --> 01:28:46,810
Yeah.

1713
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:47,643
And you,
you look at it and you go when you're 

1714
01:28:49,061 --> 01:28:52,810
inside of it and you realize the insane 
magnitude of the construction,

1715
01:28:52,811 --> 01:28:53,644
the fact that it took hundreds of years 
to complete and they did it all without 

1716
01:28:56,021 --> 01:28:57,850
sauce,
without power tools,

1717
01:28:57,851 --> 01:28:58,684
rather.
They did it all without any modern 

1718
01:29:00,251 --> 01:29:05,251
equipment and unbelievably beautiful,
incredible work of art.

1719
01:29:05,570 --> 01:29:08,220
And it pales in comparison to what they 
did in Egypt.

1720
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,090
Yes,
it does.

1721
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:11,440
Which is like it.
There's certain,

1722
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:13,810
I think I got to go because it's one of 
those,

1723
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:16,260
well,
they also have an obelisk that's a 4,000

1724
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:18,000
year old ambulance.
I said a little major.

1725
01:29:18,110 --> 01:29:19,000
Yeah,
they stole it from me.

1726
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,553
And you just look at that and when 
you're there physically and you look at 

1727
01:29:22,681 --> 01:29:23,730
it in person,
you just go,

1728
01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:26,160
how long fuck did they make this?

1729
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,020
Wait a minute now wait,
this is,

1730
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:29,053
yeah,
cathedral is the silica is very 

1731
01:29:31,201 --> 01:29:34,050
interesting and all that.
But how did they move?

1732
01:29:34,051 --> 01:29:34,884
How did they get this actually 
interesting book by my now deceased 

1733
01:29:38,101 --> 01:29:42,060
friend Peter Tompkins on the magic of 
the obelisks where he's talking about,

1734
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:43,980
you know,
ripping that out of there.

1735
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:47,460
Out of context and bringing him to Rome 
and New York and New England,

1736
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:48,893
and it was interesting because they were
brought over in the 19th century and 

1737
01:29:51,721 --> 01:29:52,554
it's already,
you know,

1738
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:53,483
technology's pretty advanced.
I mean was huge cranes and all the rest 

1739
01:29:56,401 --> 01:30:01,401
of it and it strained the,
the Victorian technology to the utmost.

1740
01:30:02,071 --> 01:30:02,904
They get these things over and then you 
realize that the Egyptians did it with 

1741
01:30:07,141 --> 01:30:12,141
none of those tools that all they 
somehow got ripped out of the bedrock,

1742
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:13,823
brought down the river,
taken offloaded from the raft or boats 

1743
01:30:17,371 --> 01:30:21,180
or whatever,
but there's a big job transported across

1744
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:22,014
the ground that's doable,
erected in place precisely to the 

1745
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:29,460
millimeter millimeter on the base.

1746
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:32,010
That's a big mystery.
They have levels.

1747
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:36,300
What did they have levels like bubble 
levels and not bubbled levels,

1748
01:30:36,301 --> 01:30:41,020
but they had other kinds of did it with 
water somehow or another that that's,

1749
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,190
that's I think reasonably well 
established,

1750
01:30:44,191 --> 01:30:46,560
but I forget exactly how it was on how 
they leveled.

1751
01:30:46,561 --> 01:30:47,394
For example,
the base of the pyramid to the 

1752
01:30:49,201 --> 01:30:50,034
millimeter or something like that.
I mean everything that you look at in 

1753
01:30:54,451 --> 01:30:55,620
Egypt,
when you go there,

1754
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:57,093
the deeper you look,
the more mysterious it becomes and new 

1755
01:30:59,691 --> 01:31:01,370
marvel at on.
The devil did this.

1756
01:31:01,390 --> 01:31:02,223
Well,
the king's chamber is one of the most 

1757
01:31:03,031 --> 01:31:07,170
bizarre ones.
Well no buzz up.

1758
01:31:07,171 --> 01:31:09,600
More bizarre than than other things.
I mean it's a,

1759
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:12,080
but just the enormity of the stones,
the way theirs,

1760
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:16,720
they're set up that it's just,
it's such a complex system.

1761
01:31:16,730 --> 01:31:19,050
The way that the way they've set them in
place is so cool.

1762
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:23,910
You're talking about the ones that the,
the so called relieving chambers,

1763
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:25,590
which are really resonating.
Chambers,

1764
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,290
resonating chambers.
Yeah,

1765
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:29,340
that,
that's another thing I think.

1766
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:30,503
Yeah,
they're not that.

1767
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:31,583
They don't really,
they don't relieve anything 

1768
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:33,733
architectural.
He completely unnecessary to relieve 

1769
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:37,043
the,
the stresses from above directly below 

1770
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:41,970
the king chamber is the so called 
Queen's chamber,

1771
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:43,283
which doesn't have that at all,
has a simple gabled roof and that 

1772
01:31:45,451 --> 01:31:48,600
protects it from anything that it needs.
The other Chambers,

1773
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,230
when you're in the king chamber,
it's like being,

1774
01:31:52,231 --> 01:31:53,730
it's an echo chamber.
You can't.

1775
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:55,083
It's,
it's really a miraculous place and of 

1776
01:31:56,851 --> 01:31:59,070
course everything is precision cotton,
all of that,

1777
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:02,480
but it doesn't look that fantastic 
insistent and it's the,

1778
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:03,503
the level above that are the most 
amazing things because these are the 70 

1779
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:07,234
ton blocks of stone.
I think that's where you're talking 

1780
01:32:08,561 --> 01:32:10,630
about how they got those into place.

1781
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:11,463
No one knows,
but they're responsible for the 

1782
01:32:13,781 --> 01:32:17,020
resonance of that,
of that particular chamber.

1783
01:32:17,021 --> 01:32:17,854
And it's my belief that resonance plays 
even not necessarily resonance with the 

1784
01:32:24,101 --> 01:32:25,750
human voice,
but when you're in there,

1785
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:27,543
the the,
I forget the acoustic term feedback or 

1786
01:32:31,151 --> 01:32:33,430
whatever that you can't.
For example,

1787
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:35,080
if we're in the king's chamber and we 
go,

1788
01:32:35,081 --> 01:32:35,914
we rent the pyramid for a couple of 
hours in for a meditation session and 

1789
01:32:39,041 --> 01:32:42,190
not on my trips,
and when you're in there,

1790
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:43,083
you can't have a conversation the way 
we're having it now you have to talk 

1791
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:50,620
like this.
Otherwise the reverberation is such that

1792
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:52,640
it's grumbled your voice.
Well,

1793
01:32:52,641 --> 01:32:55,810
if this can only be deliberate and you 
can hear from the,

1794
01:32:57,130 --> 01:32:57,963
you can hear from the king's chamber.
If you do set up and you do a chant in 

1795
01:33:01,451 --> 01:33:02,284
the king's chamber,
if you go all the way down the ground 

1796
01:33:04,241 --> 01:33:08,020
gallery,
and then there's a place below where you

1797
01:33:08,021 --> 01:33:08,890
have to make a turn.

1798
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:09,723
And then there's a descending passage 
that goes as deep below the ground as 

1799
01:33:13,571 --> 01:33:14,404
the,
as the pyramid has this king's chamber 

1800
01:33:16,451 --> 01:33:20,890
is above the ground is about 12 story 
shaft that you go out on the ground,

1801
01:33:20,891 --> 01:33:21,724
12 stories,
12 stories down below and then 12 

1802
01:33:23,291 --> 01:33:24,520
stories built.
Wow.

1803
01:33:24,521 --> 01:33:29,500
Good luck.
And I'll write a very good and um,

1804
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:31,480
and I,
uh,

1805
01:33:32,410 --> 01:33:35,010
and,
and if you set up a chance in the,

1806
01:33:35,011 --> 01:33:38,800
in the king's chamber,
you can hear it down in the,

1807
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:41,740
in the pit below 12 stores below.
Yeah.

1808
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:45,220
But you shouldn't be able to hear it at 
all because the sound has to go down and

1809
01:33:45,221 --> 01:33:47,530
then turn around and then go down the 
other shop.

1810
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:48,850
By the way,
I should say,

1811
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,800
because people are always asking me,
now,

1812
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:52,083
it's a function of age.
How long are you going to keep doing 

1813
01:33:54,191 --> 01:33:57,880
these traps?
And I say,

1814
01:33:57,881 --> 01:33:58,714
well,
you know,

1815
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:01,060
unless and until,
um,

1816
01:34:01,150 --> 01:34:04,720
I can't get up and down the king time up
to the king's chamber,

1817
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:05,943
I'll,
I'll be doing trips unless some media 

1818
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:08,110
thing takes over.

1819
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:10,900
But they say in Texas,
if you can do it,

1820
01:34:10,901 --> 01:34:13,900
it ain't bragging.
Good line.

1821
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:18,850
So I was in Egypt reasonably on my,
on the research reckie trip,

1822
01:34:18,851 --> 01:34:20,950
but that may lead to something and the 
May not,

1823
01:34:20,951 --> 01:34:23,260
we'll say keep trip or record 
reconnaissance.

1824
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:26,920
Oh,
the film Lingo for reconnaissance.

1825
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:30,750
I thought it was like,
no,

1826
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,870
not regular,
not reiki now and,

1827
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,950
and actually,
so normally you have a go with the group

1828
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:38,650
up to the king's chamber.
But I don't bother to go.

1829
01:34:39,070 --> 01:34:39,903
We open,
it gets opened up and he'd go down into 

1830
01:34:41,321 --> 01:34:42,180
the pet side,
said Nah,

1831
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:43,483
cause my,
on my 84th birthday I happened to be in 

1832
01:34:45,461 --> 01:34:46,211
Egypt.
So I said,

1833
01:34:46,211 --> 01:34:48,250
okay,
well I'll test it.

1834
01:34:48,251 --> 01:34:51,460
So I went up to the king's chamber and 
down the shaft,

1835
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:54,760
that's 12 stories up on 12 stories down 
and I went down to the pit.

1836
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:55,883
It was 12 stories down and 12 stories up
and I figured that was pretty good for 

1837
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:01,520
her,
so it was pretty good.

1838
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:05,410
Um,
so I'll be doing the trips for a while.

1839
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:07,820
Nice.
Well that's good because I mean,

1840
01:35:07,821 --> 01:35:08,654
I don't think anybody's capable of doing
the same kind of experience that you 

1841
01:35:12,231 --> 01:35:15,020
would provide.
Like your knowledge of Egypt is,

1842
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:17,330
it's pretty rare in this day and age.
Well,

1843
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:20,810
I was hoping when I had this idea to 
dude my own trips,

1844
01:35:20,811 --> 01:35:21,644
I thought,
oh finally I'll make a living out of 

1845
01:35:22,611 --> 01:35:25,610
this stuff.
But what happened was that no sooner had

1846
01:35:25,611 --> 01:35:28,160
my guidebook come out.
You probably don't have a copy of that,

1847
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:30,650
but it's out of print now.
But I have copies,

1848
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:33,950
um,
that um,

1849
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:39,290
back in [inaudible] 85,
the first of the terrorist things happen

1850
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:40,124
then these guys hijack the cruise ship 
off Alexandria and push this poor old 

1851
01:35:46,131 --> 01:35:50,600
guy in a wheelchair over the side of the
crowd of the cruise ship and he drowned.

1852
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:56,110
And that my book had just come out and 
instantly the tourist trade was killed.

1853
01:35:56,810 --> 01:35:58,910
It's talking about people being afraid 
for a whole year.

1854
01:35:58,911 --> 01:36:02,240
It took for it to develop and it,
it did develop again,

1855
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:05,210
but the book had disappeared from the 
shelves by that time anyway.

1856
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:08,450
Was still available of course.
But um,

1857
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:10,490
wait,
I lost my thread.

1858
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:12,920
Um,
with the trips.

1859
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:18,000
Like what did you say with Egypt?
Someone doing what?

1860
01:36:18,350 --> 01:36:19,183
Someone doing it.
My plan was I wanted to train a number 

1861
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:25,040
of people up to who cook familiar,
you know,

1862
01:36:25,041 --> 01:36:29,330
steeped and symbol as Egypt to to spread
the word as it were.

1863
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:31,090
And while I'm,
while I was added,

1864
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:33,860
get a commission from,
from the trips to,

1865
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:34,723
you know,
provide some useful wolf repellent so 

1866
01:36:37,131 --> 01:36:40,040
you can have some nice passive income 
sometimes.

1867
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,680
Right.
But it never happened because you know,

1868
01:36:42,710 --> 01:36:46,790
one thing led to another and it was hard
enough getting my own trips filled up.

1869
01:36:47,030 --> 01:36:47,800
But yeah,
the PR,

1870
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:52,340
but unfortunately as it now stands,
I'm the only one,

1871
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,233
only a handful of people know symbolist 
Egypt well enough to communicate it as 

1872
01:36:57,621 --> 01:37:00,340
it just so happens I'm the only one who 
does trips out.

1873
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:01,553
I really,
I really am the only wheel in town in 

1874
01:37:02,991 --> 01:37:04,270
that regard.
Well,

1875
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:07,010
you brought us a bunch of slides,
so once you tell me what,

1876
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:09,050
what,
what do you want to show us and what did

1877
01:37:09,051 --> 01:37:10,430
you bring here?
Well,

1878
01:37:10,610 --> 01:37:13,520
I brought,
that's my whole long lecture.

1879
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:17,270
You want to see,
you want to go to the,

1880
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:20,630
to the geology of the Sphinx,
the water weathering.

1881
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:24,620
Um,
and then the other slides,

1882
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,990
um,
related to that,

1883
01:37:26,991 --> 01:37:30,020
the gigantic blocks paving blocks,
um,

1884
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:32,420
around particularly around the second 
pyramid.

1885
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:37,930
And I'm,
and I'm fucking pyramid and yeah,

1886
01:37:39,141 --> 01:37:39,974
mostly around the second pyramid.
And then I mean all of that stuff 

1887
01:37:44,241 --> 01:37:48,620
relates to the scientific,
the geological evidence.

1888
01:37:49,070 --> 01:37:52,610
Then I wanted to get into,
I didn't want to touch the,

1889
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:56,910
the symbolist,
the quest for immortality cause that's a

1890
01:37:56,911 --> 01:37:57,744
total big subsequent thing I did want to
get into and we didn't even talk about 

1891
01:38:02,191 --> 01:38:02,760
it.

1892
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,410
Um,
yeah,

1893
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:09,411
the map of the map of Dumbfuckistan and,
and what I call the,

1894
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:12,570
the,
and I've got a great graphic for it.

1895
01:38:12,571 --> 01:38:15,750
And actually the everybody,
you know,

1896
01:38:15,751 --> 01:38:18,600
certainly and everybody,
probably most of your audience will know

1897
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:21,180
about the four horsemen of the 
apocalypse,

1898
01:38:21,210 --> 01:38:22,043
right.
From revelation who are actually 

1899
01:38:24,061 --> 01:38:29,061
interesting study in its own right.
The four horsemen are war,

1900
01:38:31,770 --> 01:38:34,650
famine and war,
famine,

1901
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:36,870
pestilence,
and death.

1902
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,273
And what's interesting about the four 
horsemen is that only war is really 

1903
01:38:41,191 --> 01:38:43,500
under human control,
at least in theory,

1904
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:47,250
the famine,
pestilence,

1905
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,360
plague,
as it were,

1906
01:38:48,810 --> 01:38:49,643
and death comes to us all.
It's a peculiar choice actually for the 

1907
01:38:52,201 --> 01:38:53,034
four horsemen.
But I invented the five cowboys of 

1908
01:38:56,761 --> 01:39:00,660
apocalypse 2.0
and they are,

1909
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:04,650
and they are capitalism,
patriotism,

1910
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:09,690
democracy,
technology and entertainment.

1911
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:11,300
All this stuff I love.
Yeah.

1912
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:14,980
Well that's the end.
Well,

1913
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:16,353
no,
it's just another way of looking at 

1914
01:39:17,651 --> 01:39:21,400
things actually.
And it's really human folly.

1915
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:22,210
All of it,
right?

1916
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:22,810
Well,
yeah,

1917
01:39:22,810 --> 01:39:25,150
call it democracy.
Call it capitalism,

1918
01:39:25,151 --> 01:39:26,960
call it technology.
It's,

1919
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:29,290
it's none of those things.
It's human folly.

1920
01:39:29,291 --> 01:39:32,770
It's the human,
the error and human use that,

1921
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:33,420
right?
Yeah.

1922
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:34,253
Well,

1923
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:35,513
okay.
Capitalism is really based upon the 

1924
01:39:38,521 --> 01:39:40,260
philosophy.
Everything for me,

1925
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:41,183
nothing for you.
You see everybody's fighting for market 

1926
01:39:43,381 --> 01:39:44,700
share.
Why can't you live with a guide?

1927
01:39:44,701 --> 01:39:46,350
Stay alive.
It wasn't,

1928
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:49,070
that's competition.
But if it wasn't for that competition,

1929
01:39:49,071 --> 01:39:49,904
we wouldn't be here.
It shoot across the sky wouldn't have 

1930
01:39:52,731 --> 01:39:56,300
laptops at work so well we might have 
internet that's so fast.

1931
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,730
I don't know and we might,
but we might not.

1932
01:39:58,790 --> 01:39:59,623
It's very possible that we wouldn't and 
there's a downside to all of those 

1933
01:40:02,001 --> 01:40:03,560
things,
but the mat upside too.

1934
01:40:03,561 --> 01:40:05,780
There isn't.
I'm a glass half full kind of guy.

1935
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:10,720
That to me was that's the technology 
side of it and got to that yet totalism

1936
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:13,570
is based upon everything for me.
Nothing for you.

1937
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:16,960
Patriotism is based upon everything for 
us.

1938
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:18,183
Nothing for them.
The bumper sticker says God bless 

1939
01:40:20,591 --> 01:40:21,424
America,
but hidden sticky sides as in fuck 

1940
01:40:23,771 --> 01:40:25,070
everyone else,
right?

1941
01:40:25,130 --> 01:40:25,963
That's patriotism.
Democracy is that the idea is that the 

1942
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:34,570
dishwashers elect the chef and tell them
what to do.

1943
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:35,703
I don't know about you.
I don't eat in the restaurant with the 

1944
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:40,150
dishwashers,
elect the chef and tell him what to do.

1945
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:43,390
It's flawed.
It's hopelessly flawed to begin with,

1946
01:40:43,391 --> 01:40:47,560
which Plato recognized perfectly.
Churchill said,

1947
01:40:47,561 --> 01:40:48,394
deb malick cracy looks like the worst of
all possible of all possible political 

1948
01:40:51,881 --> 01:40:54,250
systems until look at all the others

1949
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:55,383
at the same time.
This is fun and it's not necessarily 

1950
01:40:57,761 --> 01:40:58,960
untrue.
The same time.

1951
01:40:58,961 --> 01:40:59,794
He also said contradicting himself.
The best argument against democracy is 

1952
01:41:03,191 --> 01:41:05,710
10 minutes of conversation with an 
average voter.

1953
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:07,333
I know about you.
I don't want my leaders elected 

1954
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:14,770
numerically ply.
The average voter actually,

1955
01:41:14,771 --> 01:41:16,870
if they had a test for,
if there were,

1956
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,150
if there were,
if there were,

1957
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:22,820
which is next to impossible to even 
conceive if it,

1958
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:25,010
if,
if voting we're a privilege.

1959
01:41:25,011 --> 01:41:27,670
I mean when the country started off it 
was a privilege,

1960
01:41:27,671 --> 01:41:30,130
but you had to be a white male who owned
property,

1961
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:31,293
which is not as elitist as it actually 
looks now because in those days they 

1962
01:41:38,021 --> 01:41:38,854
were the only ones who were substantial 
enough and probably had some sort of an 

1963
01:41:41,561 --> 01:41:42,394
education.
It doesn't mean necessarily that they 

1964
01:41:43,571 --> 01:41:47,540
understand the principles and they,
you know,

1965
01:41:47,541 --> 01:41:49,990
they,
they were the s you might say this solid

1966
01:41:49,991 --> 01:41:52,690
citizens who at least could read,
I mean,

1967
01:41:52,691 --> 01:41:55,900
nobody else could read except people 
with an education of some sorts.

1968
01:41:56,230 --> 01:41:57,063
So that was,
that was the rule and it wasn't a 

1969
01:41:58,841 --> 01:41:59,674
terribly good rule,
but it might have been in its own way 

1970
01:42:02,770 --> 01:42:03,603
anyway.
That's as a principle that it shouldn't 

1971
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:11,390
be a privilege to vote just as like 
anybody could produce pr.

1972
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:14,260
Why shouldn't anybody be able to do 
brain surgery,

1973
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:19,180
you know,
or design engineer design a bridge.

1974
01:42:19,210 --> 01:42:21,790
I'm as good as the next guy but I'm 
never designed to bridge.

1975
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:24,730
I don't have any training,
but it's a democracy.

1976
01:42:24,731 --> 01:42:29,100
Why can't I do that?
Or play center field for the mets that I

1977
01:42:29,101 --> 01:42:33,130
would just really essentially anybody,
you just have to say,

1978
01:42:33,131 --> 01:42:34,810
I want to do it,
step up.

1979
01:42:34,811 --> 01:42:36,700
This is my plan and get people to vote 
for you.

1980
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:41,530
Well that it's a catastrophe anyway,
put it this way and its current form and

1981
01:42:41,531 --> 01:42:43,870
in fact as far back as he could go in 
America,

1982
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:45,280
it's been a disaster.

1983
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,880
Democracy technology is certainly a 
mixed bag.

1984
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:51,820
The problem.
Two big problems with technology.

1985
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:55,960
The main one,
and we touched upon this earlier,

1986
01:42:56,650 --> 01:42:57,483
is that technology deprives the average,
the normal human being of making a 

1987
01:43:03,971 --> 01:43:07,330
living out of his own product,
out of his own creativity.

1988
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:10,420
It deprives them.
Technology does it.

1989
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:11,613
The only people who are creative in 
technology are the people who are 

1990
01:43:14,411 --> 01:43:18,610
creating the technology.
Everybody else serves the technology.

1991
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:21,520
They work in the offices that serve the 
technology.

1992
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:22,743
They they,
they're basically slaves to the 

1993
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:25,864
technology.
What about the people that use the 

1994
01:43:26,651 --> 01:43:30,640
technology to separate themselves from,
from slave jobs?

1995
01:43:30,990 --> 01:43:33,580
Like there's a lot of people that have 
started their own businesses online.

1996
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:35,890
Yeah,
because they could use technology now,

1997
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:38,320
so you can crafts people,
create things.

1998
01:43:38,321 --> 01:43:39,154
That's the upside,
but it's a relatively small part 

1999
01:43:41,651 --> 01:43:44,590
compared to the number of people they 
talk about.

2000
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:47,980
They talk about all these good jobs 
going at the China.

2001
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:51,500
That was a shitty jobs.
Nobody in their right mind would to work

2002
01:43:51,501 --> 01:43:52,200
in a factory.

2003
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,800
If you ever worked in a factory,
no.

2004
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:55,770
Or been in the factory.
Really.

2005
01:43:55,810 --> 01:43:56,643
I've been in factories.
I went to schools is seldom as I 

2006
01:43:58,911 --> 01:44:01,460
possibly could in Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania,

2007
01:44:01,461 --> 01:44:02,750
which is where the,
the,

2008
01:44:03,180 --> 01:44:05,500
uh,
Bethlehem steel center was.

2009
01:44:05,501 --> 01:44:08,510
And we used to go there on field drops.
Holy Mackerel.

2010
01:44:08,511 --> 01:44:09,344
These,
this was like working in Dante's 

2011
01:44:10,341 --> 01:44:11,174
inferno,
these black and figured jumping up and 

2012
01:44:13,281 --> 01:44:14,114
down in the blind,
the heat of the bessemer converters and 

2013
01:44:17,721 --> 01:44:18,554
the other kinds of jobs of robots 
stuffing things into boxes of flipping 

2014
01:44:22,941 --> 01:44:26,330
burgers.
The vast majority of people,

2015
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:28,830
yeah,
they got the,

2016
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:29,660
that,
you know,

2017
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:32,360
they have the television sets and their 
internet and stuff like that.

2018
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:33,453
But,
but the vast majority of people cannot 

2019
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:39,620
do not and cannot make their living out 
of their own creativity.

2020
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,930
And before,
however terrible things may have been in

2021
01:44:41,931 --> 01:44:42,764
medieval times,
people did creative transformational 

2022
01:44:45,411 --> 01:44:46,100
things.

2023
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:50,360
Cause that's the downside of technology 
and the other bad side of technology,

2024
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:54,430
you talked about the good side,
the bad side is that it's,

2025
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:58,460
it's not immoral necessarily,
but it's amoral.

2026
01:44:58,730 --> 01:45:01,130
So as long as they can do it,
they do it.

2027
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:03,140
Um,
within my budget.

2028
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:04,700
Well,
hydrogen bomb,

2029
01:45:04,701 --> 01:45:05,990
why not?
We don't invent it.

2030
01:45:05,991 --> 01:45:07,760
Somebody else will do it.
Nerve gas.

2031
01:45:07,761 --> 01:45:10,140
Well that's a very good way of getting 
wet roadway with,

2032
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:11,360
you know,
around stuff,

2033
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:14,870
strike toothpaste.
Well it's a waste of time and effort and

2034
01:45:14,871 --> 01:45:16,880
stuff like that,
but maybe we can sell more,

2035
01:45:16,881 --> 01:45:17,714
strike two strike toothpaste,
then unstrapped toothpaste and the rest 

2036
01:45:21,261 --> 01:45:22,760
of it is,
in other words,

2037
01:45:23,210 --> 01:45:24,770
a percentage of it.
Yeah,

2038
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:25,663
the medicine is very good until it gets 
into the hands of big Pharma that makes 

2039
01:45:29,301 --> 01:45:31,990
sure that the most,
that that,

2040
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:32,833
that,
that people are ripped off for her to 

2041
01:45:35,691 --> 01:45:38,270
get at the medicine that they need in 
the medicine that they,

2042
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:42,170
that they have available is not usually 
a cure.

2043
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:45,290
It's a way of keeping people alive and 
buying more medicine.

2044
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:50,120
Anything that's actually a cure that 
comes from alternative sources is fought

2045
01:45:50,121 --> 01:45:53,060
to the death by,
by the big pharmaceutical companies.

2046
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:57,800
So technology is certainly a mixed bag 
and entertainment,

2047
01:45:57,910 --> 01:46:00,810
depending on how you define it,
is what,

2048
01:46:00,970 --> 01:46:03,590
what you do to kill time before it kills
you.

2049
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:05,420
For the most part,
it's a waste of,

2050
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:10,780
it's an absolute waste of time.
It's takes your mind off the,

2051
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:14,340
of the boringness of your own life.
Um,

2052
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:16,820
artists,
different art is not entertainment.

2053
01:46:16,821 --> 01:46:17,654
There's a broad,
there's a broad line in between that at 

2054
01:46:21,321 --> 01:46:25,340
least in theory,
could or should be filled by comedy,

2055
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:26,593
which is not exactly entertainment,
but it's not exactly sacred science 

2056
01:46:30,831 --> 01:46:34,550
either,
but it plays at least theoretically it,

2057
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:38,450
it,
it can play a kind of a transformational

2058
01:46:38,451 --> 01:46:39,860
role.
You can,

2059
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:45,700
real high level comedy is enlightening.
It's,

2060
01:46:46,431 --> 01:46:49,950
it,
it points out and comedy is based upon,

2061
01:46:49,951 --> 01:46:51,810
you can't laugh.
You can only,

2062
01:46:51,811 --> 01:46:56,811
comedy is based upon what's wrong.
You can't laugh at what's right.

2063
01:46:59,060 --> 01:46:59,893
You can't make fun of good sex or good 
food and you can make fun of attitudes 

2064
01:47:02,671 --> 01:47:05,880
toward good sex or good food.
But you can't laugh.

2065
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:08,190
That's at what's right.
Not Easily,

2066
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:12,720
but you can laugh,
but you can do laugh at what's wrong.

2067
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:18,090
And so let's say at some inner level by 
laughing at what's wrong

2068
01:47:21,410 --> 01:47:25,400
inadvertently,
it's a recognition we have within us,

2069
01:47:25,401 --> 01:47:27,260
let's say a moral,
uh,

2070
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:28,400
we have a moral,

2071
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:29,700
okay,

2072
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:34,700
compass by the wrong word.
We have a moral thermometer or something

2073
01:47:35,371 --> 01:47:36,204
of the sort that recognizes by 
recognizing what's wrong were assenting 

2074
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:43,500
we're giving asset to what's right.
It is too cultural.

2075
01:47:43,501 --> 01:47:44,334
Of course.
What's funny to an Eskimo is not 

2076
01:47:45,421 --> 01:47:46,254
necessarily funny to an African,
the 22 an African is not necessarily 

2077
01:47:49,561 --> 01:47:51,030
funny to work,
you know,

2078
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:55,950
to a Chinese,
but comedy has this potential to play,

2079
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:58,770
at least in my view,
a transformational role.

2080
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,170
But anyway,
mostly it doesn't,

2081
01:48:01,230 --> 01:48:02,063
an entertainment at the American level 
turn on your television set is that 

2082
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:08,580
entertain and it's certainly not art.
It's,

2083
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:10,530
it's,
it's a deadening.

2084
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:12,600
It's an anodyne.
It's,

2085
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,090
it's sort of,
most of it is,

2086
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:16,400
is,
is a,

2087
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:17,760
is a kind of,
is a,

2088
01:48:17,770 --> 01:48:19,110
is a kind of,
um,

2089
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:21,650
what's,
what's it take to go set it?

2090
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:22,633
It's,
it is a,

2091
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:26,400
it's basically a kind of sedative or the
opposite or,

2092
01:48:26,401 --> 01:48:28,200
uh,
it's like a benny,

2093
01:48:28,270 --> 01:48:30,900
it's a stimulant that it's an,
it's a stimulant,

2094
01:48:31,070 --> 01:48:31,903
right?
Actually with your opens the terminator 

2095
01:48:33,061 --> 01:48:35,940
and all of that horrible,
vicious things that they do.

2096
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,360
So that's,
yeah.

2097
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:39,640
Let's get to the slides,
right?

2098
01:48:39,650 --> 01:48:41,330
It's cause we're already two hours in 
here.

2099
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:41,900
No,
yeah.

2100
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:42,620
Let's,
um,

2101
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:44,990
let's take a look at some of the slides 
of a,

2102
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:47,660
what do you want to start?
Let's start with the geology start right

2103
01:48:47,661 --> 01:48:50,030
at the beginning and I'll just whip your
passed.

2104
01:48:50,031 --> 01:48:51,590
Okay,
now why are they,

2105
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:52,663
this is a really confusing thing to me.
Why do they continue to rebuild that 

2106
01:48:56,631 --> 01:48:57,464
thing?
Because when they're rebuilding it and 

2107
01:48:58,821 --> 01:49:02,030
they're rebuilding the feet and the 
pause of the Sphinx,

2108
01:49:02,031 --> 01:49:05,510
and I understand there's considerable 
erosion that that they have to mitigate,

2109
01:49:05,511 --> 01:49:06,344
but it's not the sphinx anymore.
I mean it's bringing the swings back to 

2110
01:49:10,581 --> 01:49:11,414
supposedly what it was originally.
The problem is really is an engineering 

2111
01:49:15,471 --> 01:49:16,304
problem.
They don't know themselves and at least 

2112
01:49:17,901 --> 01:49:19,820
a few of them acknowledge it.
Shock,

2113
01:49:19,821 --> 01:49:20,654
thanks this number and he's done.
He's not in charge of doing the repairs 

2114
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:24,643
that it may be doing more damage because
it's still weathering on the inside and 

2115
01:49:28,221 --> 01:49:31,760
like covering it over with these usually
very badly,

2116
01:49:32,450 --> 01:49:33,283
badly done stuff,
but they're actually doing more damage 

2117
01:49:35,721 --> 01:49:35,950
than that.

2118
01:49:35,950 --> 01:49:37,570
Well,
the Department of Antiquities,

2119
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:41,180
is that what you're no longer,
he's no longer in the bucky.

2120
01:49:41,270 --> 01:49:42,620
Did they lock them up?
No,

2121
01:49:42,621 --> 01:49:43,011
no,
no,

2122
01:49:43,011 --> 01:49:43,844
no.
He was in trouble.

2123
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,340
Well,
he was in trouble,

2124
01:49:46,341 --> 01:49:49,290
but they couldn't it on it.
They could.

2125
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:51,010
Now listen,
I,

2126
01:49:51,570 --> 01:49:53,140
I,
on a personal level,

2127
01:49:53,141 --> 01:49:55,900
that's another long story when we were 
already gone on for two hours,

2128
01:49:55,901 --> 01:50:00,901
but on a personal level,
I can get on with Zady and a nine,

2129
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:02,583
he's now back in,
not formally in a position of power is 

2130
01:50:05,681 --> 01:50:09,640
not headed the department and he,
because he's got his problems.

2131
01:50:09,641 --> 01:50:11,400
Do you see the debate that he had with 
Graham Hancock?

2132
01:50:11,401 --> 01:50:12,700
God,
he was,

2133
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:14,610
yeah,
he was exactly there.

2134
01:50:14,611 --> 01:50:16,900
And,
and all of his friends even,

2135
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:17,823
I mean,
the guy who runs my trip Mama dogs 

2136
01:50:19,190 --> 01:50:20,023
meeting,
I called the surgeon because he really 

2137
01:50:21,521 --> 01:50:26,470
knows how to operate his wonderful guy 
and he's a good personal friend of Zeiss

2138
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:27,870
and he said,
you know,

2139
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,410
thought he,
this is a disaster,

2140
01:50:29,411 --> 01:50:30,730
but he,
you know,

2141
01:50:30,731 --> 01:50:34,810
he lived through it and he's back back 
on the scene as it were.

2142
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:35,703
Anyway,
we're looking at this finks and closure 

2143
01:50:37,721 --> 01:50:40,060
here and a,
this massive,

2144
01:50:40,090 --> 01:50:43,840
massive structure with this,
all this erosion around it,

2145
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:44,733
right?
All this road intuit and then they'll 

2146
01:50:45,641 --> 01:50:47,580
send this on youtube.
Um,

2147
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:48,220
yeah.
When,

2148
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:50,740
when you'll see as we go through a few 
sides,

2149
01:50:50,741 --> 01:50:53,740
you get a few slides,
you'll see the sense of that erosion.

2150
01:50:53,741 --> 01:50:57,070
This is just a wonderful picture of it 
taken by a good friend of mine.

2151
01:50:57,071 --> 01:50:59,620
Keep going about,
this is why,

2152
01:50:59,621 --> 01:51:03,700
this is why the swings could not have 
been weathered by sand.

2153
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:06,040
What we're looking at right now for the 
people that are just listening,

2154
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:08,860
is it buried in sand,
which it has been many,

2155
01:51:08,861 --> 01:51:10,480
many times when,
um,

2156
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:13,030
when Napoleon found that it was burdened
sand correct,

2157
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:16,510
completely buried in sand and probably 
for a few thousand years,

2158
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:17,703
this is taken photograph taken about 
2000 when it had already been excavated 

2159
01:51:22,151 --> 01:51:25,060
and filled up with sand again,
which happens pretty quickly.

2160
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:26,193
So basically you can say,
give a take a few hundred years that 

2161
01:51:29,531 --> 01:51:32,260
since it's supposed did construction 
around 2,500

2162
01:51:32,261 --> 01:51:33,094
BC,
it's been buried in sand about 3000 of 

2163
01:51:35,921 --> 01:51:38,110
those 4,500
years.

2164
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:39,420
That's the proof.
Yeah,

2165
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:40,293
that's,
there's the evidence and still the 

2166
01:51:41,591 --> 01:51:42,424
geologists go on ranting about sand.
When you were talking about this friend 

2167
01:51:45,041 --> 01:51:47,110
of yours is going to cause a dreezy.
Okay.

2168
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:48,250
How did it,
how did it,

2169
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:50,350
whether by sand,
wind and sand,

2170
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:52,900
right.
The wind can't get the wind,

2171
01:51:52,901 --> 01:51:54,430
can't it?
The fact that that way,

2172
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:57,510
it wasn't that the original text of 
whoever who,

2173
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:59,710
who do they attribute to?
The construction of the pyramid?

2174
01:52:00,030 --> 01:52:00,670
Moses?
No,

2175
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:00,900
no,
no,

2176
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:01,300
no,
no.

2177
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:02,133
Pharaoh Khafra cops.
This successor of Khufu who supposedly 

2178
01:52:05,381 --> 01:52:09,550
built the Great Pyramid,
which is not true in its entirety,

2179
01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:11,283
the pyramids.
This is another comp com complex 

2180
01:52:13,301 --> 01:52:14,134
argument,
which means you see everything's 

2181
01:52:15,041 --> 01:52:17,950
complex.
They're almost certainly built in stages

2182
01:52:17,951 --> 01:52:18,784
in the earliest stages,
probably date from whenever the Sphinx 

2183
01:52:21,731 --> 01:52:25,240
was originally built and the argument 
for coffer building.

2184
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:29,460
It wasn't a tax that said that he had a 
dream that if he uncovered this,

2185
01:52:29,461 --> 01:52:31,720
thinks that he would become pharaoh.
No,

2186
01:52:31,721 --> 01:52:33,910
that's took Moses.
That's torn fat.

2187
01:52:33,970 --> 01:52:34,803
A thousand years later they attributed 
to compro because the causeway that 

2188
01:52:40,451 --> 01:52:41,284
leads from the spanx.
If you'd go to the behind it cause 

2189
01:52:43,561 --> 01:52:45,950
either the beginning,
not really as he just back into spanx.

2190
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:47,153
The causeway,
the causeway leads up to the right to 

2191
01:52:49,791 --> 01:52:53,320
the middle of the PR of the Pyramid of 
the car for up pyramid,

2192
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:54,163
which he almost certainly did build or 
any way super imposed upon something 

2193
01:52:57,861 --> 01:52:59,870
that was there before because you can 
prove that.

2194
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:00,973
Okay,
keep going to use the thing it was 

2195
01:53:01,761 --> 01:53:03,250
taught Moses was that,
no,

2196
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:03,651
no,
no.

2197
01:53:03,651 --> 01:53:04,484
They always thought it was,
they always thought it was [inaudible] 

2198
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:09,080
because uh,
well that again,

2199
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:11,970
what is this right here?
That's not the Rosetta stone is no,

2200
01:53:12,030 --> 01:53:12,291
no,
no,

2201
01:53:12,291 --> 01:53:12,470
no.

2202
01:53:12,470 --> 01:53:13,303
That's the,
that's the Stele of took Moses that 

2203
01:53:15,021 --> 01:53:19,670
talks about how in a dream he ate,
it's covered with sand.

2204
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:21,820
Oh that's everyday.
That's the end.

2205
01:53:21,870 --> 01:53:25,140
1450 BC.
So as Abbott in 1450 BC,

2206
01:53:25,141 --> 01:53:25,974
it was confidence and exactly with a 
certain number of other evidences of 

2207
01:53:29,421 --> 01:53:30,254
that sort,
you can put together the timeline that 

2208
01:53:32,061 --> 01:53:32,894
tells you,
I swear I've read online someone 

2209
01:53:34,401 --> 01:53:36,620
attributed and Tut Moses to the creation
of it,

2210
01:53:36,621 --> 01:53:38,880
but there's a lot of,
a lot of junk.

2211
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:42,410
Now the face of this finks and this is a
really controversial thing,

2212
01:53:42,411 --> 01:53:43,244
right,
because the face of the Sphinx is 

2213
01:53:43,821 --> 01:53:44,654
clearly newer than the body.
It's less eroded and it's also a very 

2214
01:53:47,691 --> 01:53:50,510
African looking face.
Do they think that,

2215
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:52,640
which is obviously it's the continent 
Africa,

2216
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:53,683
but did they think there's the new beans
had conquered Egypt at one point in 

2217
01:53:56,211 --> 01:53:56,710
time,
right?

2218
01:53:56,710 --> 01:54:00,110
It wasn't the speculation that one of 
the new being farrows had,

2219
01:54:00,111 --> 01:54:01,130
uh,
created this,

2220
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:05,390
well,
some said that 19th century travelers,

2221
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:08,660
lots of them noted that this was really 
an African face.

2222
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:11,610
But what they meant is that it's a sub 
Sahara Africa.

2223
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:17,070
It's a real African African face.
The new means a very black but have more

2224
01:54:17,571 --> 01:54:21,950
or less find her features.
They don't have to draw like that.

2225
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:24,800
I mean that looks more like an NBA 
basketball player,

2226
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:27,650
Egyptian,
right?

2227
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:32,660
Like the head dresses all re redone the 
picture before with covered with sand.

2228
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:37,180
You see how they do read it.
The bottom had bets in,

2229
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:42,240
in its entirety.
The face itself is a much harder outcrop

2230
01:54:42,651 --> 01:54:43,484
of limestone.
So it hasn't weathered to the same 

2231
01:54:46,161 --> 01:54:49,010
extent that the body of the Sphinx has 
weathered.

2232
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:53,830
So you think it's the same era?
We don't know actually we of it,

2233
01:54:53,850 --> 01:54:56,930
you see the,
the African face is a,

2234
01:54:56,931 --> 01:54:59,960
is a real problem actually.
Of course the Egyptians,

2235
01:54:59,961 --> 01:55:00,794
there was prejudice does everyone else 
and they don't want to actually believe 

2236
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:07,160
that the Sphinx itself could be a sub 
Saharan African.

2237
01:55:07,310 --> 01:55:10,820
Maybe from an earlier period when the 
Africans were pharaoh's we don't know.

2238
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:11,753
Wasn't there some speculation that 
initially it was an actual lion's face 

2239
01:55:14,691 --> 01:55:17,810
and that the lion's face was cut down to
create this,

2240
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:18,873
that that's us speculating that way 
because the head is way too small for 

2241
01:55:23,571 --> 01:55:24,404
the body and it's certainly,
and we had the NYP D we did this big 

2242
01:55:28,431 --> 01:55:30,320
study.
I think that's the next slide coming up.

2243
01:55:30,820 --> 01:55:31,940
Um,
yeah,

2244
01:55:31,941 --> 01:55:35,960
there it is that you see the,
with Frank Domingo who was the,

2245
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:36,913
um,
and why can't you taste well he was a 

2246
01:55:39,090 --> 01:55:44,090
forensic senior forensic artist for the 
NYP D is a guy who knows

2247
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,450
about physiology so young,
young.

2248
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:51,360
So he did a study of the comparative 
phases of the swings.

2249
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:52,194
And the of the strengths,
that's the one on the right and feral 

2250
01:55:55,680 --> 01:56:00,090
conference.
And his conclusion was that no artists,

2251
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:00,953
no competent artist or sculptor who 
could possibly have used the same model 

2252
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:08,910
for the face of the spanx.
As for the cop rock face,

2253
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:09,783
right?
Professing there's a few Kopra faces 

2254
01:56:10,951 --> 01:56:12,960
floating around.
So the,

2255
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:17,910
my criminal partner,
when frank gave us that study,

2256
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:19,040
um,
his,

2257
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:22,370
his comparative study,
Boris Saeed said,

2258
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:23,580
ah,
for the,

2259
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:26,970
for the,
for the academic establishment,

2260
01:56:26,971 --> 01:56:27,804
this is bad news and worse news,
the bad news is that there wasn't 

2261
01:56:30,901 --> 01:56:33,750
Atlantis.
And the worst news is they were black.

2262
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:37,680
My black friends,
like that phrase.

2263
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:40,020
But anyway,
so,

2264
01:56:40,021 --> 01:56:40,854
and then when the 90s,
I did an op Ed piece for the New York 

2265
01:56:44,431 --> 01:56:47,340
Times and I carefully left that part 
out.

2266
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:52,910
I just compared to use the frank dummy,
the mangoes drawing versus the Spanx.

2267
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:55,253
But a couple of weeks later,
a letter was published from an order 

2268
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:01,200
from an orthodontist who also knows 
about faces saying,

2269
01:57:01,201 --> 01:57:02,034
hey,
hey,

2270
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:05,220
that swings is actually a sub Saharan 
African face.

2271
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:07,080
I didn't say it,
he sent it.

2272
01:57:07,081 --> 01:57:10,500
So I'm not in trouble for that.
But anyway until,

2273
01:57:11,010 --> 01:57:11,843
until something better is discovered.
It's a sub Saharan African face and we 

2274
01:57:14,881 --> 01:57:17,000
don't know when it,
and it was really carved and,

2275
01:57:17,001 --> 01:57:21,240
and we don't know when it's entirely 
possible that it used to be online.

2276
01:57:21,241 --> 01:57:23,670
And then some title,
the girl came along and said,

2277
01:57:23,690 --> 01:57:24,960
I don't like that line.
Well,

2278
01:57:25,590 --> 01:57:26,423
no,
it may have been that the head was so 

2279
01:57:27,751 --> 01:57:28,870
weathered,
ah,

2280
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:31,650
that over over time that they'd said,
well,

2281
01:57:31,890 --> 01:57:34,680
we can't,
we can't repair the face of the way that

2282
01:57:34,681 --> 01:57:36,480
we can repair the body.

2283
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:37,613
And so they re carve the head.
And of course [inaudible] was most 

2284
01:57:40,711 --> 01:57:44,880
likely still above ground while the rest
of the body was covered.

2285
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:47,250
So it was a subject to more erosion.
Well,

2286
01:57:47,251 --> 01:57:48,120
it would not,
well,

2287
01:57:48,121 --> 01:57:50,730
it's also a harder limestones so 
probably,

2288
01:57:51,180 --> 01:57:52,590
again,
this is speculation,

2289
01:57:52,591 --> 01:57:56,010
but we reckon that it,
an outcrop was done,

2290
01:57:56,011 --> 01:57:59,250
was sticking above the sand level to 
begin with.

2291
01:57:59,251 --> 01:58:03,270
And somebody at some point,
the judge in years ago,

2292
01:58:03,650 --> 01:58:05,820
um,
decided to,

2293
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:08,730
to,
to carve the swings by,

2294
01:58:08,910 --> 01:58:09,743
by cutting around it.
It's cutting the bedrock away from 

2295
01:58:12,241 --> 01:58:13,074
around it,
leaving the outcrop above and carving 

2296
01:58:15,871 --> 01:58:17,940
that into whatever it may have been 
originally.

2297
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:20,460
It could have been an African queen 
would have been,

2298
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:24,450
how much information did they lose when 
the library of Alexandria was burned?

2299
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:25,740
Well,
since it was burned,

2300
01:58:25,741 --> 01:58:26,770
we don't know.
All right.

2301
01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:27,613
It's amazing.
1 million scrolls which dragged that 

2302
01:58:31,411 --> 01:58:33,660
they had a million scrolls.
Who knows what was on that.

2303
01:58:34,050 --> 01:58:35,340
One of my,
one of my,

2304
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:40,660
one of my dreams have dreams but um,

2305
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:42,963
sort of they didn't whatever.
But the hope is that one of these days 

2306
01:58:51,010 --> 01:58:54,940
somebody turns over at spade and you 
know,

2307
01:58:54,941 --> 01:58:59,941
when in Damascus or in somewhere up 
there and discovers a cache of,

2308
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:02,110
of you know,
of,

2309
01:59:02,111 --> 01:59:05,470
of hidden,
of hidden scrolls scrolls from the,

2310
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:06,333
from the library of Alexandria.
It's quite probable that the so called 

2311
01:59:09,671 --> 01:59:11,680
maps of the,
of the sea kings,

2312
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:12,933
you know the peary reese map and some of
those other things are copies of maps 

2313
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:17,673
that were originally part of the part of
the library and I have a whole film 

2314
01:59:21,341 --> 01:59:22,174
script actually.
What's the latest on this supposedly a 

2315
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:27,340
chamber that they found in the pause,
the Sphinx.

2316
01:59:27,550 --> 01:59:30,190
There's been some radio,
no us and that's awesome.

2317
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:31,033
It's the seismograph says as the chamber
there and the seismograph doesn't 

2318
01:59:34,691 --> 01:59:39,490
channel and it doesn't is united and the
geophysicist who did it said,

2319
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:40,653
yeah,
there's a void down that I that mean 

2320
01:59:42,670 --> 01:59:43,503
that it's,
it could be a natural void that's 

2321
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:50,410
certain kinds of limestone that riddled 
with those kinds of voids,

2322
01:59:50,411 --> 01:59:52,240
but this isn't that kind of limestone.

2323
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:53,373
So more more stuff.
When when the opposition finally caves 

2324
01:59:57,581 --> 02:00:02,080
in and says they never say they're wrong
but and says,

2325
02:00:02,081 --> 02:00:03,760
well,
this deserves further study,

2326
02:00:04,070 --> 02:00:08,780
then maybe we get permission to go and 
really look back in internet,

2327
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:09,693
stick a probe down to something like 
that and see if there is indeed 

2328
02:00:12,221 --> 02:00:14,290
something in there.
We don't know.

2329
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:16,960
God.
That seems like an important thing could

2330
02:00:16,961 --> 02:00:17,794
be.
I mean it just to find that there's 

2331
02:00:18,881 --> 02:00:21,100
something there justifying there's 
something there.

2332
02:00:21,101 --> 02:00:22,060
It's important.
Yes.

2333
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:23,373
Now,
is there ever been any discussion 

2334
02:00:26,261 --> 02:00:28,480
whatsoever about you?
I mean,

2335
02:00:28,481 --> 02:00:31,720
I know they've done all this,
a repair work on the Sphinx is ever,

2336
02:00:31,721 --> 02:00:36,721
ever been any discussion of taking the 
limestone that was pulled from the Great

2337
02:00:38,290 --> 02:00:39,123
Pyramid and somehow or another putting 
new limestone back up here to recreate 

2338
02:00:41,981 --> 02:00:44,890
its original look?
No.

2339
02:00:44,891 --> 02:00:47,260
Nobody has ever talked about that as far
as I know.

2340
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:50,710
But it would be a nightmarish job 
because all of the,

2341
02:00:50,860 --> 02:00:51,693
all of those core blocks are all crumbly
and anamund and damage and stuff like 

2342
02:00:56,921 --> 02:00:57,754
that.
And besides,

2343
02:00:58,090 --> 02:00:59,620
they have other fish to fry,
you know,

2344
02:00:59,621 --> 02:01:02,440
they've got the technology to worry 
about.

2345
02:01:02,610 --> 02:01:04,780
I know,
but I mean just if people could see what

2346
02:01:04,781 --> 02:01:09,010
it used to look like,
you never did that when they redid it to

2347
02:01:09,011 --> 02:01:11,500
build Cairo acquired,
that's what they say.

2348
02:01:11,710 --> 02:01:12,543
I'm not even a hundred I've never seen 
the study that actually has documented 

2349
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:21,640
where those stones are and they're big 
massive stones and they slope like this.

2350
02:01:21,850 --> 02:01:23,470
You can't build a bridge out of those 
stones,

2351
02:01:23,471 --> 02:01:24,304
you'd have to cut the edge off with is 
almost as much work as querying this 

2352
02:01:26,921 --> 02:01:28,810
stuff out of,
out of the room,

2353
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:30,940
out of the,
out of the raw quarry rock,

2354
02:01:30,941 --> 02:01:33,730
which is closer to Cairo.
So what do you think happened?

2355
02:01:33,731 --> 02:01:35,170
I don't know.
I don't know,

2356
02:01:35,230 --> 02:01:36,063
but I'm,
I'm not 100% happy with that 

2357
02:01:37,751 --> 02:01:40,220
explanation.
I don't have a better one

2358
02:01:40,610 --> 02:01:41,520
but,
but,

2359
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:46,600
but that one is subject to,
let's say a subject to question now.

2360
02:01:47,170 --> 02:01:50,300
Is it been firmly established that it 
was covered in smooth limestone?

2361
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:51,740
Pretty much,
yeah.

2362
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:52,890
Pretty much.
Um,

2363
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:54,060
yes.
Actually the,

2364
02:01:54,090 --> 02:01:56,060
the,
the Roman Greco Roman,

2365
02:01:56,061 --> 02:01:59,660
his writers who were there at the time 
studying,

2366
02:01:59,661 --> 02:02:03,740
talked about it being absolutely perfect
and unpenetrable.

2367
02:02:03,770 --> 02:02:04,603
In fact,
one of them said there's a rumor that 

2368
02:02:06,471 --> 02:02:11,471
there was a hinged block at the entrance
that have you pushed it at or you know,

2369
02:02:11,870 --> 02:02:13,610
did something with it.
It opened.

2370
02:02:13,611 --> 02:02:14,444
And I've often thought that,
I wonder if that's the origin of open 

2371
02:02:17,301 --> 02:02:21,040
sesame and the in the thousand and one 
nights,

2372
02:02:21,620 --> 02:02:25,340
because there are a lot of certain of 
those thousand and one nights tales that

2373
02:02:25,341 --> 02:02:28,880
have their origins in ancient Egypt.
It would be a good study.

2374
02:02:29,570 --> 02:02:30,770
Go ahead.
Keep going.

2375
02:02:31,580 --> 02:02:32,413
What else we got here?
Oh that's the head of [inaudible] with 

2376
02:02:34,821 --> 02:02:35,654
the,
with the Falcon while very different 

2377
02:02:37,131 --> 02:02:37,580
face.

2378
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:38,413
They totally different face.
I mean you can't miss that and there's 

2379
02:02:41,451 --> 02:02:42,284
more long story,
but we were already going over here and 

2380
02:02:44,811 --> 02:02:49,430
I won't go into here's this water 
weathering that shot took one look at it

2381
02:02:49,431 --> 02:02:50,264
and said,
wow,

2382
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:52,940
this looks like there are hundreds of 
thousands of years old.

2383
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:55,490
Just keep going now hundreds of 
thousands of years.

2384
02:02:55,491 --> 02:02:58,730
I was is,
you know when the geologist,

2385
02:02:58,731 --> 02:03:02,270
he wasn't thinking what he was,
he was saying he was just saying it,

2386
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:03,313
but it was massive water erosion.
It was massive water erosion by a guy 

2387
02:03:07,761 --> 02:03:10,880
whose expertise is in,
is in that field.

2388
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:13,610
So if he thought about it,
you know,

2389
02:03:13,611 --> 02:03:15,950
he can't document that until we get a 
bunch of guys.

2390
02:03:15,951 --> 02:03:18,230
They're really looking seriously into 
it.

2391
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:20,890
But how old do you think it is if you 
had know?

2392
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:22,650
I don't know.
Um,

2393
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:23,893
because of the way it's oriented.
One of the reasons they come out with 

2394
02:03:26,601 --> 02:03:31,601
the date and handcock and above all 
originally came out with his 11,500

2395
02:03:32,990 --> 02:03:36,620
because as a processional marker,
cause that's what would be the time as a

2396
02:03:36,621 --> 02:03:37,454
lion.

2397
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:42,380
That would be the time when it last saw 
its own image in the sky.

2398
02:03:42,381 --> 02:03:44,480
Leo The Lion,
the Constellation of Leo.

2399
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:46,670
That would've been the last time I 
think.

2400
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,800
Not that there's too much that's going 
on.

2401
02:03:48,801 --> 02:03:53,210
It's in too chaotic a stage two to have 
been done.

2402
02:03:53,211 --> 02:03:56,600
Then I think it may be the press the age
before that,

2403
02:03:56,601 --> 02:03:57,434
which would be about 36,000
BC which would correspond to the 

2404
02:04:00,261 --> 02:04:02,630
Egyptian texts themselves.
However,

2405
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:03,643
that said,
it wouldn't surprise me if we her older 

2406
02:04:04,791 --> 02:04:05,624
cell.
It's until we got a bunch of geologists 

2407
02:04:08,241 --> 02:04:12,950
and experts in their various fields to 
see if they can put a fix on it and they

2408
02:04:12,951 --> 02:04:15,230
might not be able to.
But that's what,

2409
02:04:15,231 --> 02:04:19,310
that's,
that's one of the things we look forward

2410
02:04:19,311 --> 02:04:20,144
to doing if we get permission to go back
in there and get the funding and you're 

2411
02:04:23,721 --> 02:04:28,520
important and the permissions to go 
there and actually get this done.

2412
02:04:28,521 --> 02:04:30,860
And this is where actually we were just 
in Egypt.

2413
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:35,880
I had when I climbed up and down the 
pyramid myself at 84 and um,

2414
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:38,933
we got complicated story,
but we did get to meet the new minister 

2415
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:49,140
of antiquities and it was very cordial 
and,

2416
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:50,513
and kind of listed the things that we 
had to do in order to get formal 

2417
02:04:54,211 --> 02:04:57,810
position,
but in any way we established a personal

2418
02:04:58,170 --> 02:05:00,000
contact with him,
which is very useful.

2419
02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:01,283
And then we also met up with the 
director of this new gigantic museum 

2420
02:05:06,030 --> 02:05:09,180
that they're building and that is going 
to open in a year or two ago.

2421
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:10,403
And he was,
he was very open to anything even 

2422
02:05:13,291 --> 02:05:17,010
controversial that they could apply 
science toe.

2423
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:21,270
So if some of the other pieces of this 
trip didn't go as planned,

2424
02:05:21,271 --> 02:05:22,104
we couldn't get the see some of the 
things we wanted to see for complicated 

2425
02:05:24,721 --> 02:05:26,190
reasons.
But anyway,

2426
02:05:26,191 --> 02:05:27,024
that we established the potential 
foothold for getting the next stage of 

2427
02:05:32,091 --> 02:05:32,924
the,
of work.

2428
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:34,800
Very promising.
It's promising.

2429
02:05:34,830 --> 02:05:36,570
Now,
correct me if I'm wrong,

2430
02:05:36,571 --> 02:05:37,404
would they think that people in this 
form the form of you and I have only 

2431
02:05:39,931 --> 02:05:43,020
been around for somewhere around 300 to 
500,000

2432
02:05:43,021 --> 02:05:43,854
years?
Is that right?

2433
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:44,933
Well,
that's the current thing for trout and 

2434
02:05:46,231 --> 02:05:46,890
it changes.
Yeah.

2435
02:05:46,890 --> 02:05:47,671
Yeah.
It changes.

2436
02:05:47,671 --> 02:05:49,410
It May.
So let's bring it back.

2437
02:05:49,411 --> 02:05:51,690
Let's go crazy and say it's a million 
years old when,

2438
02:05:51,850 --> 02:05:55,140
when you're looking at something like 
this and you're talking about 36,000

2439
02:05:55,141 --> 02:05:56,010
years,
boy,

2440
02:05:56,011 --> 02:05:57,090
that's,
uh,

2441
02:05:58,360 --> 02:05:59,193
it's just,
it's just crazy to think that there was 

2442
02:06:01,051 --> 02:06:04,500
this period where people just throwing 
shit at each other and you know,

2443
02:06:04,501 --> 02:06:06,810
and throwing a pointed sticks in animals
and,

2444
02:06:07,140 --> 02:06:09,300
and uh,
kind of barely getting by.

2445
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:14,660
And then something like this just sort 
of erupts out of the imagination and the

2446
02:06:16,891 --> 02:06:21,690
engine nuity of people that lived tens 
of thousands of years ago.

2447
02:06:22,170 --> 02:06:23,003
Yeah.
But it shouldn't be that difficult 

2448
02:06:24,151 --> 02:06:26,070
because as you keep going through the 
slides,

2449
02:06:26,370 --> 02:06:28,740
you'll get to the Paleolithic caves and 
I was out.

2450
02:06:28,770 --> 02:06:31,080
That's more evidence of water erosion,
correct?

2451
02:06:31,110 --> 02:06:32,040
No.
Can it right there?

2452
02:06:32,090 --> 02:06:32,401
No,
no.

2453
02:06:32,401 --> 02:06:33,600
I'm talking about,
know what I'm saying,

2454
02:06:34,050 --> 02:06:36,350
but bright there.
This image w right there,

2455
02:06:36,351 --> 02:06:37,690
I'll say me.
Which those little,

2456
02:06:37,790 --> 02:06:39,330
that's the same.
That's the same what?

2457
02:06:39,331 --> 02:06:41,340
What are weathering is just another view
of it.

2458
02:06:41,370 --> 02:06:42,720
Okay.
Back end of the Sphinx.

2459
02:06:42,870 --> 02:06:45,300
Okay.
And that's interesting.

2460
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:46,950
Anyway,
part of Mark Lane,

2461
02:06:46,951 --> 02:06:48,530
his theory is that,
you know,

2462
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:49,620
is that it's,
it's,

2463
02:06:50,130 --> 02:06:52,350
it flaked away,
you know,

2464
02:06:52,351 --> 02:06:54,630
over time.
And that's what's responsible for these.

2465
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:58,980
See the curved profile.
But this is a tomb that's been cut in.

2466
02:06:59,490 --> 02:07:01,350
It's old,
it's not old kingdom.

2467
02:07:01,351 --> 02:07:03,360
It's,
it's what's called late kingdom,

2468
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:04,493
but it dates from about six or 700 BC.
And those are the Mason's marks still 

2469
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:11,650
adds original stuff.
20s,

2470
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:16,080
2,600,
two and a half thousand years later.

2471
02:07:16,230 --> 02:07:18,190
Still perfectly visible.
No,

2472
02:07:18,630 --> 02:07:21,900
no theory theory exploded.

2473
02:07:22,270 --> 02:07:24,340
Well that definitely puts a damper on 
the,

2474
02:07:24,341 --> 02:07:25,780
uh,
wind and sand erosion.

2475
02:07:26,050 --> 02:07:27,190
That too.
Absolutely.

2476
02:07:27,191 --> 02:07:28,024
Yeah.
Especially considering that they still 

2477
02:07:29,981 --> 02:07:32,920
think the spanx is 26 or 2,500
BC.

2478
02:07:32,921 --> 02:07:33,070
Yeah,
yeah,

2479
02:07:33,070 --> 02:07:33,903
yeah.
Well,

2480
02:07:34,060 --> 02:07:35,500
this is,
this is,

2481
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:40,390
remember I said the second strongest 
thing in the world and this is not,

2482
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:41,433
you don't trifle with them.
And then if you think that just because 

2483
02:07:44,741 --> 02:07:47,560
the evidence is good enough,
they're going to accept it.

2484
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:50,230
No,
they're only going to accept it when you

2485
02:07:50,231 --> 02:07:51,064
beat him into the ground sufficiently so
that they can't get up while as long as 

2486
02:07:55,181 --> 02:07:58,360
the reputation is staked on their,
you know,

2487
02:07:58,390 --> 02:08:00,640
their original assumptions being 
correct,

2488
02:08:00,641 --> 02:08:02,080
there's going to be a problem.
Oh,

2489
02:08:02,081 --> 02:08:03,370
and so there is,
yeah.

2490
02:08:03,490 --> 02:08:04,323
So what are we looking at here?
This is the corner of copper for up 

2491
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:06,460
here,
Ahmed.

2492
02:08:06,460 --> 02:08:09,190
And you'll see the two very different 
styles of architecture,

2493
02:08:09,430 --> 02:08:10,263
the huge blocks below,
very finely dressed and the much cruder 

2494
02:08:13,810 --> 02:08:18,340
core masonry up above this is evidence 
of two separate stages of construction.

2495
02:08:18,610 --> 02:08:23,610
It's like if you had of your board of 
Victorian House with an Ikea kitchen and

2496
02:08:23,861 --> 02:08:26,380
that you wouldn't say,
oh well they just decided to,

2497
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:27,313
you know,
build this Victorian House and put this 

2498
02:08:28,420 --> 02:08:29,380
cool new kitchen.

2499
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:30,213
And now you'd know in two seconds that 
it's two different stages of 

2500
02:08:33,221 --> 02:08:34,870
construction.
Anyway,

2501
02:08:35,260 --> 02:08:36,840
we got a lot of tough stuff to cover 
here.

2502
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:39,513
Here.
What would stop you see where these 

2503
02:08:41,951 --> 02:08:44,410
people are walking?
Do you see that?

2504
02:08:44,411 --> 02:08:45,244
This one block,
you see those people there and then all 

2505
02:08:47,861 --> 02:08:50,200
the way down with the third guy down 
there is walking.

2506
02:08:50,201 --> 02:08:51,034
There's another,
it goes down to there and then it goes 

2507
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:53,353
20 plus.
It's about 20 by 30 foot block and then 

2508
02:08:56,410 --> 02:08:59,530
next to the next slide.
That's what it is,

2509
02:08:59,531 --> 02:09:00,041
ed,
John.

2510
02:09:00,041 --> 02:09:01,870
Those are the blocks people walking on 
top.

2511
02:09:01,871 --> 02:09:02,704
That's what we would just looking at.
So those blocks are about between six 

2512
02:09:06,101 --> 02:09:08,540
and eight feet thick.
Go back to the bottom line,

2513
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:10,120
so not only they're six and eight feet 
thick,

2514
02:09:10,121 --> 02:09:11,560
but they're stacked on top of each 
other.

2515
02:09:11,561 --> 02:09:13,570
I'll try to build it up to that level.

2516
02:09:13,630 --> 02:09:14,463
Wow.
Six and eight feet thick and then 

2517
02:09:16,571 --> 02:09:17,404
stacked on top of another one.
That's of a similar and I could go 

2518
02:09:19,541 --> 02:09:20,980
poking back into it.
It's all,

2519
02:09:20,981 --> 02:09:23,650
you see the joints between the Merck 
pretty rough,

2520
02:09:23,830 --> 02:09:26,830
but in fact if you poke back in there,
you'll see that they fit together,

2521
02:09:27,070 --> 02:09:29,650
that you can barely get a credit card 
between them.

2522
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:30,940
That's just,
that's,

2523
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:31,481
that's,
you know,

2524
02:09:31,481 --> 02:09:34,240
lots and lots of weather over lots and 
lots of years.

2525
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:37,810
Then those are the,
the blocks of the great pyramid,

2526
02:09:37,811 --> 02:09:38,644
which a much smaller and almost pre,
almost presuppose a later state of 

2527
02:09:43,961 --> 02:09:44,794
construction.

2528
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:49,510
We had those same,
okay,

2529
02:09:49,511 --> 02:09:51,010
that's the Red Pyramid.
You know,

2530
02:09:51,011 --> 02:09:52,870
we're going to take up too much time 
here.

2531
02:09:52,871 --> 02:09:54,190
Keep going.
Okay.

2532
02:09:54,191 --> 02:09:55,024
That's the interior of the Red Pyramid 
and you see that's a megalithic 

2533
02:09:57,461 --> 02:09:58,294
construction.
It's always called the plundered tomb 

2534
02:09:59,381 --> 02:10:00,310
chamber.
A,

2535
02:10:00,311 --> 02:10:02,830
it's not a tomb chamber because nobody 
was ever found in,

2536
02:10:02,831 --> 02:10:03,664
in it.
It doesn't look like any Egyptian tomb 

2537
02:10:05,141 --> 02:10:07,570
chamber and B,
it's not plundered.

2538
02:10:07,960 --> 02:10:09,550
It's simply ruinous.
It's,

2539
02:10:09,551 --> 02:10:10,360
this is,
uh,

2540
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:14,020
this is an earlier,
this is an earlier construction that for

2541
02:10:14,021 --> 02:10:16,390
whatever reason,
the builder of the red,

2542
02:10:16,450 --> 02:10:17,283
uh,
Red Pyramid decided to incorporate that 

2543
02:10:20,020 --> 02:10:20,853
into his pyramid.
It's not like an Ikea kitchen 

2544
02:10:24,070 --> 02:10:29,050
incorporated into the Victorian House.
It's something that was there before and

2545
02:10:29,051 --> 02:10:29,884
that they built the pyramid on top of.
So there's some older construction and 

2546
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:34,160
then in a better,

2547
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:35,820
more stay up there.
Jamie,

2548
02:10:35,850 --> 02:10:36,683
stop moving a,
so what you're seeing the lower cruder 

2549
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:43,770
level is uh,
an older method of construction.

2550
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:46,040
Then above it you see,
you look really smooth.

2551
02:10:46,190 --> 02:10:46,510
Yeah,
yeah.

2552
02:10:46,510 --> 02:10:49,160
My Macho well and also he has a really 
smooth,

2553
02:10:49,161 --> 02:10:51,260
because it's in perfect shape.
There's nothing,

2554
02:10:51,261 --> 02:10:52,970
it's at the inside of the pyramid.
Nothing,

2555
02:10:53,030 --> 02:10:55,130
nothing could,
it's like it was done yesterday,

2556
02:10:55,490 --> 02:10:58,340
whereas the bottom has been out in the 
weather for a long time.

2557
02:10:58,370 --> 02:11:00,590
That's the secret.
It's measured by,

2558
02:11:00,890 --> 02:11:05,450
it's weathered it not like the,
not like the exterior of the Sphinx,

2559
02:11:05,780 --> 02:11:10,400
but,
but it's style is typically is typically

2560
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:11,293
a megalithic.
It looks like certain to the 

2561
02:11:12,381 --> 02:11:13,214
constructions in,
in Ireland and Scotland and Wales and 

2562
02:11:15,611 --> 02:11:17,030
Megalithic instructions there.

2563
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:19,670
So you mean like a cruder cutting much,

2564
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:23,740
much cruder but dating from an earlier 
period,

2565
02:11:23,741 --> 02:11:24,670
six,
7,000

2566
02:11:24,671 --> 02:11:25,400
pcs.

2567
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:28,920
So much like when they go and do 
excavations in Mexico City,

2568
02:11:28,921 --> 02:11:29,754
they're always build.
They're building buildings down there 

2569
02:11:31,261 --> 02:11:32,094
and they have to stop construction 
because they find like some ancient 

2570
02:11:33,751 --> 02:11:34,584
pyramid or something along those lines.
Exactly what this is is they had an old 

2571
02:11:38,101 --> 02:11:40,710
structure and they built the new stuff 
on top of it.

2572
02:11:40,890 --> 02:11:43,680
The new stuff is what we think of as the
original structure,

2573
02:11:43,710 --> 02:11:46,950
but there's evidence the point that 
there was some ancient stuff below that.

2574
02:11:47,010 --> 02:11:48,000
Exactly.
Okay.

2575
02:11:49,140 --> 02:11:50,130
Interesting.
Okay.

2576
02:11:50,131 --> 02:11:50,930
And what do we got here?

2577
02:11:50,930 --> 02:11:55,550
Well I that's more of shotgun myself.
Okay.

2578
02:11:55,551 --> 02:11:58,550
This is another piece of the puzzle.
This is part of Abi dose,

2579
02:11:59,030 --> 02:12:01,040
um,
behind the temple itself.

2580
02:12:01,041 --> 02:12:03,920
Temple this off to the right and this is
again,

2581
02:12:05,390 --> 02:12:06,223
a good friend of mine has just done an 
elaborate book on this and even though 

2582
02:12:09,261 --> 02:12:13,610
he's not an egyptologist,
it's being academically published,

2583
02:12:14,090 --> 02:12:18,980
but it's going into into all sorts of,
of things having to do with this strange

2584
02:12:18,981 --> 02:12:19,814
structure,
which is one of the most resonating 

2585
02:12:21,021 --> 02:12:24,650
powerful places in all of Egypt.
We are convinced,

2586
02:12:24,651 --> 02:12:29,030
shocking myself that that was central 
pillars date from a much earlier period.

2587
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:31,610
And then the rest of the temple is Seti 
the first,

2588
02:12:31,611 --> 02:12:32,444
which is about 1300 BC.
But this is to elaborate to get into 

2589
02:12:35,841 --> 02:12:37,220
here and I'm running out of words.

2590
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:39,350
Why do you think that it's older

2591
02:12:39,930 --> 02:12:42,350
one construction method,
style,

2592
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:46,920
style of construction,
mostly style of construction and the way

2593
02:12:46,921 --> 02:12:51,330
that it's sided sort of buried into the 
ground,

2594
02:12:51,331 --> 02:12:52,164
which is almost unheard of in it for an 
Egyptian temple to be constructed into 

2595
02:12:58,440 --> 02:12:59,273
as a subterranean structure would have 
had a roof over it and so on at some 

2596
02:13:02,041 --> 02:13:04,800
point or another.
But anyway,

2597
02:13:04,801 --> 02:13:06,600
that's it.
It's a complicated issue.

2598
02:13:06,601 --> 02:13:09,510
There it is.
It fills up with water sometimes and now

2599
02:13:09,511 --> 02:13:12,370
they won't let you end up.
But uh,

2600
02:13:12,780 --> 02:13:15,620
anyway,
this is with the,

2601
02:13:16,140 --> 02:13:18,690
this is us actually I the,
the Goonie oh.

2602
02:13:18,710 --> 02:13:21,120
And John Hancock and myself and handcock
and,

2603
02:13:21,660 --> 02:13:22,493
and the,
the Graham's still now he's getting a 

2604
02:13:27,061 --> 02:13:29,640
bit cautious,
more cautious about it,

2605
02:13:30,030 --> 02:13:32,220
but we went finance

2606
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:35,070
while this mega millionaire,
um,

2607
02:13:35,130 --> 02:13:36,820
Japanese,
um,

2608
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:38,700
industrialist,
um,

2609
02:13:38,730 --> 02:13:39,541
really,
I mean,

2610
02:13:39,541 --> 02:13:42,120
he wants it to prove the existence of 
the Maria.

2611
02:13:42,510 --> 02:13:44,670
And as you see,
I mean all of those geometric,

2612
02:13:45,120 --> 02:13:46,740
um,
looks there.

2613
02:13:47,070 --> 02:13:50,040
And Chuck and I came to the conclusion 
after a week of diving there,

2614
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:54,360
that seductive as it looks,
it really is a natural,

2615
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:59,070
entirely a natural way.
And we could even see,

2616
02:13:59,071 --> 02:13:59,904
we don't have the pictures of it because
it was the last day we there they could 

2617
02:14:02,071 --> 02:14:04,280
even see the way that it was formed by 
the,

2618
02:14:04,730 --> 02:14:09,730
the nature of the Rock and the action of
the waves and the terrific tides that,

2619
02:14:10,061 --> 02:14:12,810
that prevail there.
So this is what this,

2620
02:14:13,140 --> 02:14:14,280
that's me.
You can tell.

2621
02:14:14,670 --> 02:14:15,503
Um,

2622
02:14:16,170 --> 02:14:18,550
well you were so you actually did the 
diving down there?

2623
02:14:18,820 --> 02:14:21,100
Yeah.
Oh,

2624
02:14:21,190 --> 02:14:23,170
when was that?
10,

2625
02:14:23,171 --> 02:14:26,650
12 years ago in my seventies.
What?

2626
02:14:26,770 --> 02:14:28,180
It's pretty gangster thing.
Yeah.

2627
02:14:28,181 --> 02:14:28,540
Well good

2628
02:14:28,540 --> 02:14:31,570
down the bottom of the ocean when you're
70 checking out rocks.

2629
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:32,593
Well,
and I don't like being underwater 

2630
02:14:34,251 --> 02:14:36,110
either,
but for archaeology I'll do it.

2631
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:38,510
Okay.
Keep going.

2632
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:43,313
Oh well this is the famous,
this is the famous cartoon that some 

2633
02:14:46,231 --> 02:14:48,630
people think or his hair.
These are now,

2634
02:14:48,631 --> 02:14:49,464
these are the Paleolithic caves.
This is the best of them called 

2635
02:14:51,841 --> 02:14:53,700
[inaudible].
This is day two,

2636
02:14:53,701 --> 02:14:56,730
this is in France or this is in France 
and this day date,

2637
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:57,810
they date,
not us.

2638
02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:00,960
They date to 31,000
BC or older.

2639
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:04,890
This is genius stuff.
Um,

2640
02:15:06,710 --> 02:15:10,910
great artists did this.
Great artists are not primitive then you

2641
02:15:10,911 --> 02:15:15,290
might be shooting arrows at rhinoceroses
to eat and why not?

2642
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:16,153
It's a lot better than going to the 
supermarket and the organic or you have 

2643
02:15:19,131 --> 02:15:23,120
ever,
you never heard of a gmo rhinoceros but,

2644
02:15:23,510 --> 02:15:27,320
but this is,
this is fabulous work and who knows what

2645
02:15:27,321 --> 02:15:30,320
was going on the rest of the time when 
they're doing this in the dark,

2646
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:34,100
hidden away in these caves.
And this is 31,000

2647
02:15:34,101 --> 02:15:37,610
BC.
So the date where us of 36,000

2648
02:15:37,611 --> 02:15:39,630
or thereabouts for,
you know,

2649
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:44,800
for the spanx and all of that is not as 
out of out of the question as,

2650
02:15:45,770 --> 02:15:49,180
as you think,
because they date this the 31,000.

2651
02:15:49,181 --> 02:15:52,730
And this presupposes a,
uh,

2652
02:15:52,940 --> 02:15:57,940
an extremely sophisticated art artistry 
and supremely sophisticated art.

2653
02:16:00,461 --> 02:16:05,461
History is not done by morons or by,
by primitives.

2654
02:16:07,550 --> 02:16:10,670
It just isn't.
Keep going.

2655
02:16:12,590 --> 02:16:13,640
Look at this great stuff.

2656
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:17,980
Yeah,
they definitely had a very good sense of

2657
02:16:17,981 --> 02:16:18,814
how to capture what these animals that 
they worshiped and went after looked 

2658
02:16:23,111 --> 02:16:24,400
like.
But it was a crazy,

2659
02:16:24,401 --> 02:16:27,240
here you see that looks like a rhino 
down there and horses.

2660
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:28,211
It is.
It is.

2661
02:16:28,211 --> 02:16:32,410
And the horses,
wild horses mile or maybe go back.

2662
02:16:32,411 --> 02:16:35,850
We tapped the artists artists study of 
go back to time.

2663
02:16:36,550 --> 02:16:37,383
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but I think they've only uncovered less 

2664
02:16:38,861 --> 02:16:41,200
than 10% of go back.
We test much less,

2665
02:16:41,230 --> 02:16:42,063
I think it's 5% or something like that.
And they work well now it's near the 

2666
02:16:45,161 --> 02:16:47,260
Syrian border.
So God knows what they're doing,

2667
02:16:47,261 --> 02:16:50,590
but they're covering it over because 
once they started excavating it,

2668
02:16:50,760 --> 02:16:51,593
I've been protected by the fill role of 
these thousands of years and it started 

2669
02:16:55,391 --> 02:16:56,224
deteriorating.
So now they've unfortunately you can no 

2670
02:16:58,481 --> 02:17:01,270
longer see it the way the chalk and I 
saw it six,

2671
02:17:01,271 --> 02:17:03,640
seven years ago.
So what are they covering it with?

2672
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:05,640
Oh,
they've got sheds and roofs.

2673
02:17:05,641 --> 02:17:07,900
Silver.
It completely destroyed.

2674
02:17:07,901 --> 02:17:09,490
It's magic,
but I can't blame them.

2675
02:17:10,090 --> 02:17:12,010
The weather is getting at it.
Well,

2676
02:17:12,011 --> 02:17:13,570
they've only,
when did they discover this?

2677
02:17:14,220 --> 02:17:15,053
It was actually discovered in the 1994 
or so and they've been working on it 

2678
02:17:19,270 --> 02:17:24,270
ever since and it only came into public 
view around 2004 or there abouts.

2679
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:27,553
And here,
here's some of the detail and which is 

2680
02:17:28,991 --> 02:17:29,824
why shock is fascinated by this because 
that kind of thing of the 

2681
02:17:32,410 --> 02:17:33,243
anthropomorphic of the,
of the hands grasping around the corner 

2682
02:17:37,630 --> 02:17:41,440
that's doing that was something almost 
identical to that.

2683
02:17:41,441 --> 02:17:42,274
And Easter Island,
we think Easter island plays a role in 

2684
02:17:44,531 --> 02:17:47,850
this whole lost civilization hypothesis.
Wow,

2685
02:17:50,110 --> 02:17:51,040
that's more,
again,

2686
02:17:51,041 --> 02:17:51,874
this has raised relief.
You have to chop the soane cut or a 

2687
02:17:54,221 --> 02:17:56,410
braid,
the stone away from the figures.

2688
02:17:56,411 --> 02:17:58,960
This is tough to do.
It's three d stuff.

2689
02:17:58,961 --> 02:17:59,794
And also aren't there to animals 
depicted on these things that aren't 

2690
02:18:02,441 --> 02:18:03,274
even local.
They're not even available in that 

2691
02:18:05,201 --> 02:18:07,570
continent and on nor did they think 
there's a history of these animals.

2692
02:18:07,750 --> 02:18:10,300
I am not sure this is what this one is,
the,

2693
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:11,553
that one.
There is a kind of a feline of some 

2694
02:18:12,881 --> 02:18:14,260
sorts,
um,

2695
02:18:14,630 --> 02:18:18,180
hard to tell exactly what it is cause 
it's stylized with it.

2696
02:18:18,220 --> 02:18:20,590
It's a pretty brilliant piece of 
sculpture and you have to,

2697
02:18:20,910 --> 02:18:21,743
you know,
carve away the holds stone surface in 

2698
02:18:23,651 --> 02:18:26,620
order to get at that with,
I'm not sure if they,

2699
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:30,200
if they know or some eyes what that is.
Yeah,

2700
02:18:30,201 --> 02:18:32,200
I definitely would start some sort of 
like half cuma,

2701
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:34,830
some sort of a,
some sort of a humorous,

2702
02:18:34,990 --> 02:18:39,250
this is interesting.
That's a bead that they found there from

2703
02:18:39,320 --> 02:18:44,140
go back to the topic and the,
this is a big mystery in a small bead.

2704
02:18:44,340 --> 02:18:45,730
It was,
how did they drill that hole?

2705
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:47,830
It's a very,
very,

2706
02:18:47,831 --> 02:18:50,080
very hard stone.
Very hard stone.

2707
02:18:50,081 --> 02:18:54,040
A very small stone to sitting in your 
hand that's about the size of yours.

2708
02:18:54,060 --> 02:18:57,910
You're the last digit of your thumb.
It's tiny.

2709
02:18:58,080 --> 02:18:58,913
It's tiny and it's thin.
And so there's a tiny little hole in 

2710
02:19:01,631 --> 02:19:02,710
that.
And again,

2711
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:04,900
we're talking about a time where there 
was no steel.

2712
02:19:05,050 --> 02:19:06,730
That's right.
So how did they do that?

2713
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:07,593
Exactly?
There's a bunch of pottery in Egypt in 

2714
02:19:10,661 --> 02:19:15,220
terms of a carved stone where they have 
zero idea how they,

2715
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:19,060
how they constructed it with a very thin
lip and then it goes inside contour.

2716
02:19:19,061 --> 02:19:20,620
Yeah,
I think we have one of those there.

2717
02:19:21,100 --> 02:19:21,933
This is a,
this is a bracelet found recently in 

2718
02:19:24,581 --> 02:19:26,050
Turkey,
had made of Obsidian,

2719
02:19:26,051 --> 02:19:31,040
which is an almost impossible stone to 
work with and the ridges on it.

2720
02:19:31,130 --> 02:19:32,090
They,
again,

2721
02:19:32,091 --> 02:19:36,110
not us have found by doing a careful 
study of it geometrically,

2722
02:19:36,111 --> 02:19:38,960
that it's very sophisticated geometry at
work.

2723
02:19:38,961 --> 02:19:43,040
I forget exactly what it is that set at 
issue here,

2724
02:19:43,041 --> 02:19:45,230
but it's not just a cup of cavemen 
saying like,

2725
02:19:45,231 --> 02:19:47,240
you know,
my wife is pissed off at me,

2726
02:19:47,241 --> 02:19:49,640
so I better give her something nice for 
our anniversary.

2727
02:19:50,010 --> 02:19:50,661
Clark said,
well,

2728
02:19:50,661 --> 02:19:52,640
here's a nice chunk of obsidian.
I think I'll,

2729
02:19:53,150 --> 02:19:53,870
I'll,
uh,

2730
02:19:53,870 --> 02:19:57,400
I'll do a little bracelet for her and 
don't know how all this is.

2731
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:01,340
The data is by the Strada that it's 
found in around 8,000

2732
02:20:01,341 --> 02:20:02,510
BC.
Wow.

2733
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:05,090
Wow.
Okay.

2734
02:20:05,091 --> 02:20:06,890
This is more stuff.
This is Sardinia,

2735
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:11,920
which is a treasure of Megalithic UN 
misunderstood.

2736
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:15,380
Look at these extreme plastic 
structures.

2737
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:19,010
We think shotgun myself that this may be
a lot of,

2738
02:20:19,011 --> 02:20:19,844
this may be an answer to this massive 
coronal mass ejection that happened 

2739
02:20:25,701 --> 02:20:29,930
maybe thousands of years earlier.
Even in people are still building things

2740
02:20:29,931 --> 02:20:32,720
to keep them safe from another one of 
these.

2741
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:33,733
Now what would be the effect of a 
coronal mass ejection right now but 

2742
02:20:38,030 --> 02:20:40,420
catastrophe,
right as far as it'd be now it would,

2743
02:20:40,430 --> 02:20:41,263
it would kill the satellites and it 
would freeze the we'd read it would fry 

2744
02:20:45,711 --> 02:20:46,544
the grid.
I mean instantly the only people who 

2745
02:20:49,521 --> 02:20:50,354
would hang the only people who would 
survive or the survivalist who are off 

2746
02:20:54,411 --> 02:20:57,840
the grid that because we're all assholes
with those kinds of survivalist.

2747
02:20:57,880 --> 02:20:58,713
No problem.
Yeah that was those kinds of cars but 

2748
02:21:00,891 --> 02:21:05,270
other people are off the grid,
you know doing um,

2749
02:21:05,450 --> 02:21:09,830
my pal clay who's here buying tena extra
acres that I have,

2750
02:21:10,250 --> 02:21:11,083
I'm not doing anything with and is 
planning to in fact do exactly that to 

2751
02:21:15,081 --> 02:21:15,914
go off the grid and build a permaculture
10 acre self sustaining self sustaining 

2752
02:21:20,620 --> 02:21:21,453
is a great way to do it.
To have like a farm and if you can 

2753
02:21:24,141 --> 02:21:27,950
afford the land and have solar power and
all that counseling well water,

2754
02:21:28,170 --> 02:21:31,130
a few people are doing that.
It's possible.

2755
02:21:31,190 --> 02:21:33,590
There are some people,
but you know when,

2756
02:21:33,591 --> 02:21:37,520
when the world is overpopulated to the 
extent that it is,

2757
02:21:37,521 --> 02:21:41,360
it's not going to get to an awful lot of
people very quickly.

2758
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:43,790
It's,
it's difficult to do.

2759
02:21:43,820 --> 02:21:44,653
Yeah.
These are the interior of those 

2760
02:21:45,681 --> 02:21:46,514
extraordinary neurology they called.
So identity is incredible place 

2761
02:21:49,221 --> 02:21:49,720
actually.

2762
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:53,000
And that's an Italy right island off the
coast of,

2763
02:21:55,340 --> 02:21:57,140
wow,
what do they date?

2764
02:21:57,141 --> 02:22:00,650
These two will Bei data to 2,600
or so,

2765
02:22:00,770 --> 02:22:02,180
2,600
BC.

2766
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:04,850
And Chuck and I questioned that,
but we don't have,

2767
02:22:05,330 --> 02:22:06,163
we don't have any data that that tells 
us otherwise was that is the stone 

2768
02:22:10,221 --> 02:22:12,950
circle in Egypt and knobbed apply as 
it's called,

2769
02:22:12,951 --> 02:22:16,700
that it looks completely fragmented and 
rough,

2770
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:20,630
but in fact even this,
the academics,

2771
02:22:20,631 --> 02:22:21,464
the Rko astronomers acknowledge 
architect is astronomically and there's 

2772
02:22:26,911 --> 02:22:27,744
a physicist archioffice Toronto named 
Tom Brophy who studied it much more 

2773
02:22:32,911 --> 02:22:33,744
carefully and has found much more 
sophisticated alignments than just 

2774
02:22:38,731 --> 02:22:40,770
salts.
This is an equinox is again,

2775
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:43,440
cause that's a,
that's a common thread in ancient,

2776
02:22:43,860 --> 02:22:45,000
uh,
architecture,

2777
02:22:45,001 --> 02:22:46,950
which is really fascinating,
is the,

2778
02:22:47,150 --> 02:22:47,983
the alignment with a celestial bodies.
Mayans always big on that little way as 

2779
02:22:53,101 --> 02:22:53,934
well.
What they're doing back to procession 

2780
02:22:55,860 --> 02:22:57,960
for whatever reason that we don't 
understand.

2781
02:22:57,961 --> 02:23:02,100
But with the evidence is there,
there and the festivals and all sorts of

2782
02:23:02,101 --> 02:23:05,520
things like that are attuned take place 
at these,

2783
02:23:05,521 --> 02:23:08,460
at these critical,
these critical,

2784
02:23:08,461 --> 02:23:12,330
let's call them energy points and what 
they're doing,

2785
02:23:12,331 --> 02:23:13,770
and it's quite clear that they're doing 
it,

2786
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:18,810
is that they're,
they're orchestrating their attire,

2787
02:23:18,811 --> 02:23:19,644
civilization that tuning their entire 
civilization to the movements of the 

2788
02:23:23,131 --> 02:23:23,964
heavens.
This is quite clear and this you can 

2789
02:23:26,041 --> 02:23:28,860
kind of demonstrate what they're 
achieving by that.

2790
02:23:29,550 --> 02:23:32,850
We don't know,
but it's very important to them.

2791
02:23:34,860 --> 02:23:35,930
What are we go here?
More,

2792
02:23:36,030 --> 02:23:38,880
more of the same.
That's the Devil's Dick.

2793
02:23:39,880 --> 02:23:40,710
Well,
close.

2794
02:23:40,710 --> 02:23:41,790
It looks so good.
Yeah.

2795
02:23:41,850 --> 02:23:45,270
That's the,
that's not apply.

2796
02:23:45,330 --> 02:23:46,163
And that just the drawing and not apply 
on this is this gets into complications 

2797
02:23:51,271 --> 02:23:52,104
of the cosmology of it.
This is the dog and this is the work of 

2798
02:23:55,140 --> 02:23:58,890
my good friend,
a layered scranton who you may know of,

2799
02:23:58,900 --> 02:23:59,733
I think.
Yes,

2800
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:01,410
yes.
And the Dogon tribe,

2801
02:24:01,411 --> 02:24:02,244
that's a tribe to think that they're,
they come from the constellation 

2802
02:24:04,141 --> 02:24:05,490
serious.
Well where,

2803
02:24:05,491 --> 02:24:07,120
who think they got their knowledge 
yesterday?

2804
02:24:07,220 --> 02:24:09,560
It comes to it through them directly 
from serious,

2805
02:24:09,561 --> 02:24:11,260
I don't think they think they come from 
serious,

2806
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:13,740
I'm not sure.
But anyway,

2807
02:24:14,310 --> 02:24:19,310
layered work started out just as a sort 
of amateur thing.

2808
02:24:21,570 --> 02:24:22,403
I'm looking for looking into the 
cosmology of the Dogan and at a certain 

2809
02:24:26,611 --> 02:24:30,690
point he decides to see how that matches
current cock in technology.

2810
02:24:30,690 --> 02:24:31,523
He's a techie guy,
he's a expert in computer languages and 

2811
02:24:34,471 --> 02:24:35,460
things like that.
So He's,

2812
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,820
he's,
he's very good at this kind of work.

2813
02:24:39,210 --> 02:24:43,490
And he finds that in the first book of 
his called science at the Dogan,

2814
02:24:44,060 --> 02:24:47,370
um,
that this Dogan cosmology of this,

2815
02:24:47,390 --> 02:24:50,350
you know,
read the Sim simple tribe in,

2816
02:24:50,430 --> 02:24:52,530
um,
western western Africa,

2817
02:24:53,300 --> 02:24:54,120
Mali,
Mali,

2818
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:56,010
I think it is.
Um,

2819
02:24:56,910 --> 02:24:59,490
has their cosmology,
which is,

2820
02:24:59,790 --> 02:25:00,623
they know about,
they can transmit it is in fact 

2821
02:25:03,390 --> 02:25:04,223
consistent with the latest wrinkles and 
string theory in torsion theory in high 

2822
02:25:09,241 --> 02:25:11,040
energy physics and all that sort of 
stuff.

2823
02:25:11,430 --> 02:25:16,110
And then that led him to the study of 
other civilizations and he's now,

2824
02:25:16,111 --> 02:25:16,944
it was six or seven books into it.
And really what he's doing as he's not 

2825
02:25:21,240 --> 02:25:22,073
just talk,
it's unrecognized by a handful of 

2826
02:25:24,041 --> 02:25:24,521
people.
You know,

2827
02:25:24,521 --> 02:25:26,620
they're hot by sellers and the written 
very well.

2828
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:28,660
It's very,
very simple and easy to find,

2829
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:31,450
easy to follow.
He's,

2830
02:25:31,451 --> 02:25:32,284
he's showing that this,
this complex cosmology is understood 

2831
02:25:37,961 --> 02:25:42,370
unexpressed by every society,
virtually every society that he's looked

2832
02:25:42,371 --> 02:25:44,530
into,
including the Chinese.

2833
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:45,813
Um,
that was a relatively recent book and 

2834
02:25:47,471 --> 02:25:52,471
he's ending up by with a master,
a picture puzzle of all of these ancient

2835
02:25:53,770 --> 02:25:56,110
civilizations.
No dating them.

2836
02:25:56,111 --> 02:25:59,380
Exactly.
But it's become quite clear through this

2837
02:25:59,381 --> 02:26:04,381
body of work that the ancients had this 
same,

2838
02:26:05,470 --> 02:26:06,303
the fact that Lee,
the same cosmology and the same 

2839
02:26:08,531 --> 02:26:12,340
understanding of it.
And we think that this is a hand me down

2840
02:26:12,341 --> 02:26:16,210
from the ancient civilization that we're
busy trying to,

2841
02:26:16,750 --> 02:26:20,230
to validate and the

2842
02:26:22,330 --> 02:26:24,520
[inaudible] the survivors of this 
coronal mass,

2843
02:26:24,521 --> 02:26:25,450
this,
this,

2844
02:26:25,451 --> 02:26:26,284
the survivors of the curve,
the pdf that existed before the coronal 

2845
02:26:28,451 --> 02:26:31,480
mass that achieve some sort of a high 
level of sophistication.

2846
02:26:31,660 --> 02:26:34,750
And then these people with whatever 
knowledge was leftover,

2847
02:26:34,751 --> 02:26:35,584
whatever,
they had managed to save something of 

2848
02:26:37,421 --> 02:26:38,254
that sort or they with the same people 
who are everywhere and had it to begin 

2849
02:26:41,021 --> 02:26:42,160
with.
What you're seeing up here,

2850
02:26:42,161 --> 02:26:42,994
figure 12.4
the quantum fresno frenzy can cause a 

2851
02:26:45,461 --> 02:26:49,990
string anti string pair to erupt and 
annihilate yielding and more complicated

2852
02:26:49,991 --> 02:26:51,160
interaction.
What does that,

2853
02:26:51,430 --> 02:26:52,390
well,
that's from,

2854
02:26:52,450 --> 02:26:54,910
again,
that's from the physics lab actually.

2855
02:26:54,911 --> 02:26:55,870
Are they talking about,

2856
02:26:56,200 --> 02:27:00,460
I'm not sure if it's like some sort of a
geometry thing and,

2857
02:27:00,461 --> 02:27:04,780
or the physics thing and they're looking
at this is Dogan art,

2858
02:27:04,810 --> 02:27:05,860
is that what this is?
No,

2859
02:27:05,861 --> 02:27:10,861
but Dogan has has that figure in it.
Keep going down

2860
02:27:11,310 --> 02:27:11,971
down.
I think.

2861
02:27:11,971 --> 02:27:16,220
Let's say there's some way the Dogan 
have that there.

2862
02:27:16,221 --> 02:27:17,540
It's,
where is it,

2863
02:27:17,550 --> 02:27:18,383
Jamie?
Okay.

2864
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:21,273
Okay.

2865
02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:23,230
No,
nope.

2866
02:27:23,530 --> 02:27:25,810
Hmm.
I think it's the one right after.

2867
02:27:25,811 --> 02:27:29,820
It says very close.
Let's see.

2868
02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:30,663
Anyway,
and it once you have to read Larry's 

2869
02:27:31,811 --> 02:27:34,140
book,
science of the dog,

2870
02:27:34,141 --> 02:27:34,974
and that's really all there.
And then it's the same in all of the 

2871
02:27:37,511 --> 02:27:40,000
civilizations all over the place.
And as I said earlier,

2872
02:27:40,600 --> 02:27:44,880
I don't,
I dislike,

2873
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:46,380
okay.

2874
02:27:46,380 --> 02:27:49,330
Using the Old Testament,
the Bible for,

2875
02:27:49,400 --> 02:27:52,260
for scholarship because it's a minefield
you just don't know.

2876
02:27:52,530 --> 02:27:54,000
You can select from it.
I mean,

2877
02:27:54,030 --> 02:27:54,863
you know,
the inquisitor's found a way to justify 

2878
02:27:56,371 --> 02:27:57,204
the inquisition from the Bible and you 
can justify just about anything with so 

2879
02:28:00,911 --> 02:28:02,670
much craziness in the,
so much,

2880
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:07,830
so much craziness going on in there.
But one thing that did strike me and the

2881
02:28:07,831 --> 02:28:11,040
correspondence is our correspondence is 
one of the,

2882
02:28:11,460 --> 02:28:14,940
one of the intriguing bits of,
of the,

2883
02:28:14,970 --> 02:28:16,920
um,
of,

2884
02:28:16,930 --> 02:28:20,490
I forget where it is,
tower of Babel of it's exodus or no,

2885
02:28:20,491 --> 02:28:22,560
can't be activist.
Genesis

2886
02:28:22,590 --> 02:28:23,361
may be.
Anyway,

2887
02:28:23,361 --> 02:28:27,470
one of the early books of the Bible 
where they talk about the tower of Babel

2888
02:28:27,890 --> 02:28:30,320
and one of the lines,
it's very suggestive,

2889
02:28:30,321 --> 02:28:35,300
is this before the or before the,
the tower was built,

2890
02:28:35,990 --> 02:28:40,190
all of all of humanity spoken one 
tongue.

2891
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,550
The eskimos spoke the same as the 
Polynesians.

2892
02:28:43,551 --> 02:28:44,261
What is this,
you know,

2893
02:28:44,261 --> 02:28:47,300
in the Polynesians spoke Chinese.
Now it doesn't seem,

2894
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:48,513
it doesn't seem logical.
I mean the linguists don't find that 

2895
02:28:50,241 --> 02:28:51,074
sort of thing.
But if the common language that they 

2896
02:28:53,181 --> 02:28:57,920
spoke was the cosmology and laird finds 
the same cosmology wherever he looks.

2897
02:28:58,490 --> 02:29:01,790
That's interesting.
That's not anything that you can base,

2898
02:29:02,970 --> 02:29:04,340
you know,
you can't be sure of it,

2899
02:29:04,370 --> 02:29:09,370
but suddenly that that's strange line 
does have some corroboration.

2900
02:29:10,650 --> 02:29:11,483
I think it's very hard for us to put 
into perspective what it would be like 

2901
02:29:14,070 --> 02:29:14,903
if there was some sort of a high level 
of sophistication involved in the 

2902
02:29:18,271 --> 02:29:21,270
society back then and then the 
experienced whatever it was,

2903
02:29:21,271 --> 02:29:22,104
whether it was meteor showers,
supervolcanoes what that asteroid has 

2904
02:29:25,471 --> 02:29:26,304
dried.
Yeah,

2905
02:29:26,430 --> 02:29:27,263
and whatever it is and then trying to 
retain a certain amount of it and pass 

2906
02:29:32,101 --> 02:29:32,934
it onto your children and how things 
would get so convoluted and distorted 

2907
02:29:35,910 --> 02:29:38,400
and there'd be very little left.
Yes.

2908
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:40,620
Yeah.
I mean like then it's an,

2909
02:29:40,710 --> 02:29:45,710
but the people would be of the same 
sophistication in terms of the same kind

2910
02:29:47,011 --> 02:29:50,130
of minds,
the same sized brains,

2911
02:29:50,131 --> 02:29:50,964
the same capability.
They would just have to relearn 

2912
02:29:52,711 --> 02:29:52,900
anything.

2913
02:29:52,900 --> 02:29:54,610
Hang all over again.
Well let's this.

2914
02:29:54,660 --> 02:29:55,493
This is a good,
I think there's a good case that can be 

2915
02:29:57,821 --> 02:30:02,821
made for that because stuff gets after 
we're after this cat catastrophe.

2916
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:09,960
Things really do go into a tailspin and 
then around 3000 BC,

2917
02:30:11,291 --> 02:30:12,400
4,000
BC,

2918
02:30:13,180 --> 02:30:18,180
all of a sudden all over the place,
very sophisticated civilizations arise,

2919
02:30:19,030 --> 02:30:23,050
but based upon this,
this ancient knowledge though the,

2920
02:30:23,051 --> 02:30:24,910
the mythology is all there to begin 
with,

2921
02:30:24,911 --> 02:30:27,080
but suddenly the Sumerian around the 
same time,

2922
02:30:27,081 --> 02:30:28,510
this Egypt,
there's,

2923
02:30:28,900 --> 02:30:32,080
there's China for sure.
There's India and all of these,

2924
02:30:32,860 --> 02:30:33,693
all of these seem to arrive at a very 
high level of understanding around that 

2925
02:30:38,771 --> 02:30:40,330
4,000
or so he date,

2926
02:30:40,510 --> 02:30:43,560
especially Samir,
when they go over some of the ancient,

2927
02:30:43,561 --> 02:30:44,394
those saw clay tablets.
When they see the depictions of the 

2928
02:30:46,501 --> 02:30:49,380
solar system,
that's where it gets really confusing.

2929
02:30:49,381 --> 02:30:51,090
It's like,
how the hell did they know this?

2930
02:30:51,091 --> 02:30:51,924
How do they know that there was a sun in
the center and then all these planets 

2931
02:30:54,241 --> 02:30:56,580
were in the correct size?
I mean,

2932
02:30:56,581 --> 02:30:59,910
they had jupiter and the correct size 
and the correct position.

2933
02:30:59,911 --> 02:31:02,970
Mars in the correct position was very,
very strange stuff.

2934
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:04,980
I didn't know that.
I ever seen.

2935
02:31:05,820 --> 02:31:06,653
Beautiful.
But if you are followed Zacharias hitch 

2936
02:31:08,101 --> 02:31:10,590
and stuff was he's got some really wacky
shit.

2937
02:31:10,591 --> 02:31:14,060
Well it is wacky.
Peter Fonda read if you're hot.

2938
02:31:14,080 --> 02:31:14,913
Yeah,
but it's a the Annunaki and those from 

2939
02:31:17,581 --> 02:31:18,414
heaven to Earth came and people out of 
monkeys and alien DNA is a galactic 

2940
02:31:24,301 --> 02:31:28,250
Darwinian while he was,
now he's how he's always wearing food

2941
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:30,310
and I call his,
I call him,

2942
02:31:30,390 --> 02:31:32,220
I called his father was switching in 
these,

2943
02:31:34,550 --> 02:31:35,031
well,
uh,

2944
02:31:35,031 --> 02:31:39,560
I read the use for the 12th planet to 
think that was called the 12th planet.

2945
02:31:39,740 --> 02:31:41,870
Horrible stuff yet.
But when you know,

2946
02:31:41,871 --> 02:31:43,370
when you don't know anything it's 
awesome.

2947
02:31:44,230 --> 02:31:49,230
But I pull up the image Jamie of the,
just to show it to 'em John of the solar

2948
02:31:51,291 --> 02:31:55,820
system depiction in the clay tablets 
because it's really fascinating stuff.

2949
02:31:55,821 --> 02:31:58,640
I mean it clearly shows a son with what 
we,

2950
02:31:58,880 --> 02:31:59,301
you know,
the,

2951
02:31:59,301 --> 02:32:00,134
our standard sort of image of a sun.
It's a circle and the radiating sort of 

2952
02:32:03,441 --> 02:32:04,274
lines outside of it.
And then it has all these planets 

2953
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:08,270
circling around it.
Yeah,

2954
02:32:08,271 --> 02:32:09,470
there it is right there.
Look at that.

2955
02:32:10,890 --> 02:32:13,980
Oh,
the sun is a star.

2956
02:32:14,150 --> 02:32:14,751
No,
that's just,

2957
02:32:14,751 --> 02:32:16,280
it's not a drawing.
It's just outlined.

2958
02:32:16,310 --> 02:32:20,840
That's the actual original clay tablet.
But they drew on as an outline,

2959
02:32:21,380 --> 02:32:22,213
but he's not amazing.
I mean you could find the actual tablet 

2960
02:32:24,381 --> 02:32:26,720
Jamie too,
cause he and he can zoom in on it so you

2961
02:32:26,721 --> 02:32:28,550
could see it better,
but really,

2962
02:32:28,551 --> 02:32:31,250
really incredible stuff when you 
consider the fact that they,

2963
02:32:31,270 --> 02:32:34,010
uh,
made this somewhere around,

2964
02:32:35,140 --> 02:32:36,770
what was his 5,000
BC?

2965
02:32:36,830 --> 02:32:38,000
4,000
BC?

2966
02:32:38,190 --> 02:32:39,650
I don't know.
I think it was that one right there

2967
02:32:39,800 --> 02:32:41,240
was that early,
but it's somewhere,

2968
02:32:41,360 --> 02:32:42,530
somewhere in that neighborhood.

2969
02:32:43,250 --> 02:32:46,060
See if you can find a better full 
version of it.

2970
02:32:46,061 --> 02:32:46,160
Yeah.

2971
02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:48,620
They're young Jimmy,
but

2972
02:32:49,160 --> 02:32:49,993
incredible stuff and weird stuff.
And I mean there are depictions of 

2973
02:32:53,121 --> 02:32:56,520
people with tails sitting on the labs of
giants and

2974
02:32:57,030 --> 02:32:57,863
that,
that tends to decode symbolically 

2975
02:33:01,650 --> 02:33:05,100
actually those hybrid creature type 
stuff like that.

2976
02:33:05,770 --> 02:33:06,910
Yeah.
Those,

2977
02:33:06,990 --> 02:33:07,711
those,
those,

2978
02:33:07,711 --> 02:33:11,340
most of those things I think should not 
be taken literally.

2979
02:33:11,370 --> 02:33:12,510
Right.
Um,

2980
02:33:13,390 --> 02:33:15,180
like you were talking about myths.
Yeah.

2981
02:33:15,210 --> 02:33:20,190
The myths because things change shape 
and the one thing becomes another.

2982
02:33:20,580 --> 02:33:25,580
And when does a shung pictorially it,
it doesn't mean that it's to be taken.

2983
02:33:26,011 --> 02:33:26,844
Literally there's the original,
so you could see it there in the 

2984
02:33:28,771 --> 02:33:33,771
background.
Pretty interesting stuff,

2985
02:33:34,141 --> 02:33:36,090
Huh?
But where,

2986
02:33:36,091 --> 02:33:38,070
where are they in the background?
Where,

2987
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:39,850
see right there.
Oh yeah.

2988
02:33:40,780 --> 02:33:41,613
And

2989
02:33:42,930 --> 02:33:44,640
but the stars,
that's the original.

2990
02:33:45,380 --> 02:33:46,213
You have the sun and the moon.
The stars actually that's a motif that 

2991
02:33:49,951 --> 02:33:52,440
you see in Egypt often.
Really where you have,

2992
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:57,300
where you have a star with the solar 
disk and in,

2993
02:33:57,301 --> 02:33:58,110
in,
in,

2994
02:33:58,110 --> 02:34:02,910
in the middle of it.
And often they're just stars.

2995
02:34:02,911 --> 02:34:03,744
That five points that stars and then 
it's with the solar disk in it and what 

2996
02:34:08,131 --> 02:34:08,964
they're talking about.
I think the egyptologists talk about a 

2997
02:34:10,471 --> 02:34:15,320
stellar cult and the solar cult and that
as soon as you call anything to cult,

2998
02:34:16,170 --> 02:34:17,740
it becomes,
it becomes,

2999
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:20,650
you can talk about it because it's 
somebody else's religion,

3000
02:34:21,180 --> 02:34:23,470
therefore a superstition.
But what,

3001
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:25,660
what,
what it's talking about.

3002
02:34:25,661 --> 02:34:27,820
And probably this too,
um,

3003
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:29,110
it's,
it's two levels.

3004
02:34:29,111 --> 02:34:30,190
In other words,
it's the,

3005
02:34:30,670 --> 02:34:32,470
it's the,
it's the solar sky,

3006
02:34:32,471 --> 02:34:35,230
our solar system and the star around it 
is,

3007
02:34:35,231 --> 02:34:39,730
there's a diagonal sky is the 
constellation Constellation in the sky.

3008
02:34:39,731 --> 02:34:40,564
So it's two,
two levels of the hierarchy 

3009
02:34:43,091 --> 02:34:45,980
simultaneously.
But it,

3010
02:34:46,080 --> 02:34:46,913
yeah,
just amazing that you're talking about 

3011
02:34:47,991 --> 02:34:49,550
such a long,
long time ago.

3012
02:34:49,551 --> 02:34:51,080
And they had all the little planets

3013
02:34:51,370 --> 02:34:53,760
there,
but all the,

3014
02:34:53,860 --> 02:34:56,070
well they have,
they don't have your innocent,

3015
02:34:56,520 --> 02:34:58,050
they don't have urinary,
see what they have there.

3016
02:34:58,080 --> 02:34:59,280
Do they pull it back up again?
Jamie?

3017
02:35:00,400 --> 02:35:01,800
I'm finding a couple of different 
versions.

3018
02:35:03,060 --> 02:35:04,630
So there's more than one version of it.
Yeah.

3019
02:35:04,640 --> 02:35:07,020
One only had seven planets.
They have another one that was nine.

3020
02:35:07,021 --> 02:35:07,651
It was shit.
Ah,

3021
02:35:07,651 --> 02:35:08,910
that's interesting.
If they have,

3022
02:35:08,911 --> 02:35:09,990
medicine only has seven.

3023
02:35:10,450 --> 02:35:11,283
That was a different one where that 
shows a star and then it has a bunch of 

3024
02:35:13,691 --> 02:35:15,910
plants off to the side.
Who knows what that means.

3025
02:35:15,911 --> 02:35:17,590
Go full you on that one,
Jamie.

3026
02:35:18,280 --> 02:35:19,113
Yeah,
look at that one.

3027
02:35:21,150 --> 02:35:24,840
It's just so cool to look at something 
that someone made,

3028
02:35:25,340 --> 02:35:25,891
you know,
whatever,

3029
02:35:25,891 --> 02:35:29,220
five thousand six thousand years ago and
see there

3030
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:33,400
dare attempt.
Go back to that police there,

3031
02:35:33,690 --> 02:35:35,640
tamped at trying to,
uh,

3032
02:35:36,300 --> 02:35:37,133
show and convey what they knew about the
world or what their thoughts were about 

3033
02:35:42,181 --> 02:35:43,460
the world.
Like what are we seeing

3034
02:35:43,540 --> 02:35:45,700
here?
It looks like war.

3035
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:48,970
That one is not well,
that's a common theme.

3036
02:35:48,971 --> 02:35:49,910
And,
and uh,

3037
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:52,540
that's a common theme in Egypt to the 
Pharaoh,

3038
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:57,960
the Pharaoh smiling,
smiling in the heads of the,

3039
02:35:58,001 --> 02:36:00,700
of his enemies.
It's the conquest of the forces of light

3040
02:36:00,701 --> 02:36:03,100
over the forces of darkness.
And this one,

3041
02:36:03,101 --> 02:36:06,190
the seven might not be there.
It is,

3042
02:36:07,060 --> 02:36:09,520
um,
have that you have that,

3043
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:12,460
um,
as I said off often in Egypt or are very

3044
02:36:12,461 --> 02:36:14,230
similar,
but the other one,

3045
02:36:14,231 --> 02:36:16,920
the star and the seven,
the seven planet,

3046
02:36:16,930 --> 02:36:20,800
it could be planets,
but see it's a different looking star to

3047
02:36:20,801 --> 02:36:23,350
it's many one too.
That's a different one.

3048
02:36:23,530 --> 02:36:24,363
The other one,
six,

3049
02:36:24,520 --> 02:36:26,170
it might be,
it might be,

3050
02:36:26,430 --> 02:36:30,310
it might be a number symbolism thing 
with the thing and the,

3051
02:36:30,311 --> 02:36:31,144
and the numbers.
Egyptians do seven not as circles like 

3052
02:36:35,411 --> 02:36:36,244
that,
but as,

3053
02:36:36,540 --> 02:36:37,690
as as dots.
It's,

3054
02:36:37,691 --> 02:36:38,530
you know,
it has,

3055
02:36:38,531 --> 02:36:43,480
it has a numerical validity rather than 
necessarily than an astronomical one.

3056
02:36:43,510 --> 02:36:46,030
That one,
the other one and go back the other one,

3057
02:36:46,031 --> 02:36:48,860
Jim.
Yeah,

3058
02:36:48,861 --> 02:36:49,694
no,
that,

3059
02:36:49,880 --> 02:36:51,980
that one's,
that one's really interesting.

3060
02:36:52,010 --> 02:36:55,360
Yeah.
All this stuff is an interest.

3061
02:36:55,361 --> 02:36:56,720
Yeah.
The relative sizes,

3062
02:36:56,750 --> 02:36:59,150
the relative sizes,
that's pretty mind boggling.

3063
02:36:59,480 --> 02:37:00,850
Yeah.
And again,

3064
02:37:00,860 --> 02:37:02,510
the two,
the two on the,

3065
02:37:02,780 --> 02:37:07,340
on the outer edge is really those two.
Yeah,

3066
02:37:07,730 --> 02:37:09,170
that's,
that's interesting.

3067
02:37:09,530 --> 02:37:11,690
Yeah.
Very interesting indeed.

3068
02:37:11,691 --> 02:37:14,080
I'd like to see that explained any other
way than,

3069
02:37:14,710 --> 02:37:16,370
than uh,
they knew something.

3070
02:37:17,410 --> 02:37:20,150
I mean,
or it's an amazing lucky.

3071
02:37:20,151 --> 02:37:21,470
Yes.
No,

3072
02:37:22,030 --> 02:37:24,680
this is not guesswork.
No,

3073
02:37:24,681 --> 02:37:28,970
it's just a unraveling ancient 
civilization.

3074
02:37:28,971 --> 02:37:31,250
It's like putting together a puzzle when
you only have five,

3075
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:32,780
six pieces.
Well,

3076
02:37:32,781 --> 02:37:33,614
we're,
this is the thing that when we started 

3077
02:37:35,031 --> 02:37:35,864
out there were a few pieces and then now
a lot of pieces have been added to the 

3078
02:37:41,931 --> 02:37:42,650
puzzle.
Right.

3079
02:37:42,650 --> 02:37:43,483
But the nuclear glass,
the coronal mass ejection go back to 

3080
02:37:46,991 --> 02:37:50,670
[inaudible] is a big chunk of Gunung 
Padang.

3081
02:37:50,671 --> 02:37:51,890
And in,
uh,

3082
02:37:52,490 --> 02:37:55,700
Indonesia is another one that I don't 
have any photos.

3083
02:37:55,710 --> 02:37:59,750
Event with chalk has been to that and is
absolutely convinced that at very,

3084
02:37:59,751 --> 02:38:04,040
very low aa that it's,
that it's human made and that it's very,

3085
02:38:04,041 --> 02:38:06,890
very old.
These things are showing up all over the

3086
02:38:06,891 --> 02:38:09,200
place.
So go back to this slides and,

3087
02:38:09,201 --> 02:38:10,550
um,
it's just,

3088
02:38:10,910 --> 02:38:15,170
it's such an emerging thing as far as 
like,

3089
02:38:15,171 --> 02:38:17,660
uh,
people talking about it to the slides.

3090
02:38:18,760 --> 02:38:21,230
Um,
this is something that's being discussed

3091
02:38:21,231 --> 02:38:23,900
over and over again.
Now it's much more mainstream.

3092
02:38:23,901 --> 02:38:24,734
And now that Graham Hancock has got a 
lot of traction on his work and his new 

3093
02:38:28,161 --> 02:38:28,994
book,
magicians of the Gods and Randall 

3094
02:38:31,460 --> 02:38:34,220
Carlson,
who's an expert on asteroidal impacts,

3095
02:38:34,221 --> 02:38:36,590
has sort of impacted his work as well 
and really,

3096
02:38:36,610 --> 02:38:37,600
Eh,
uh,

3097
02:38:37,730 --> 02:38:39,290
sort of,
um,

3098
02:38:39,590 --> 02:38:44,480
made it more interesting because he's 
provided a context with some historical,

3099
02:38:44,810 --> 02:38:45,643
uh,
like actual scientific evidence of 

3100
02:38:47,931 --> 02:38:48,860
impacts.
No.

3101
02:38:48,861 --> 02:38:49,460
Yeah,
yeah,

3102
02:38:49,460 --> 02:38:50,300
yeah.
Go along with it.

3103
02:38:50,330 --> 02:38:52,460
So what are we looking at here?
That's,

3104
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:53,690
that's called Beckley tip.
Hey,

3105
02:38:53,691 --> 02:38:54,450
again,
I'm,

3106
02:38:54,450 --> 02:38:55,610
but I'm not,
yeah,

3107
02:38:55,810 --> 02:38:57,130
that's all right.
Might go back to these heavy,

3108
02:38:57,131 --> 02:38:57,964
that's not the Playa,
but that's one of shocks when a shuck 

3109
02:39:00,771 --> 02:39:02,660
slides I think,
and I'm not sure what he's,

3110
02:39:03,230 --> 02:39:07,580
what he's driving at there in the 
background.

3111
02:39:07,610 --> 02:39:08,443
That's Brophy's I think that's brophy's 
slides of where he's looking for much 

3112
02:39:12,201 --> 02:39:15,850
more sophisticated information in the,
in,

3113
02:39:15,860 --> 02:39:17,180
in the Playa.

3114
02:39:17,480 --> 02:39:21,270
And even if he's,
even if it's more far out speculations,

3115
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:25,370
I just speculation.
I think they could be just the basic,

3116
02:39:25,490 --> 02:39:28,160
the basic premise is already,
um,

3117
02:39:29,090 --> 02:39:31,010
of great significance that,
that,

3118
02:39:31,100 --> 02:39:33,410
that this is cause this is dated to 
five,

3119
02:39:33,411 --> 02:39:34,610
6,000
BC.

3120
02:39:34,970 --> 02:39:37,520
So that makes it the oldest datable 
stone circle.

3121
02:39:37,970 --> 02:39:38,803
Now,
one of the things I was going to bring 

3122
02:39:39,201 --> 02:39:40,034
up with you,
I forgot when we were talking earlier 

3123
02:39:40,821 --> 02:39:41,960
about this,
uh,

3124
02:39:41,961 --> 02:39:44,890
idea of the procession of equinox is,
uh,

3125
02:39:44,930 --> 02:39:45,763
the wobble of the earth being caused 
perhaps by a dwarf star that we don't 

3126
02:39:49,101 --> 02:39:50,900
know exactly where it is.
Uh,

3127
02:39:51,100 --> 02:39:51,933
that was one of the theories about 
whatever it is outside of the Kuyper 

3128
02:39:56,211 --> 02:39:57,860
belt that,
uh,

3129
02:39:57,890 --> 02:40:02,890
there's this object out there now that 
they're 90% plus sure exists and they're

3130
02:40:03,441 --> 02:40:04,220
calling it,
you know,

3131
02:40:04,220 --> 02:40:08,120
planted acts or whatever it is.
They think that it's at least four times

3132
02:40:08,121 --> 02:40:12,350
larger than the earth and it's some 
somewhere outside of the Kuyper belt,

3133
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:14,970
which is now what they believe Pluto is 
a part of.

3134
02:40:14,970 --> 02:40:15,803
Right.
Pluto when it,

3135
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:18,030
okay,
when Pluto is no longer a planet,

3136
02:40:18,031 --> 02:40:22,860
it got listed as an asteroidal.
Pluto downgraded got the shaft,

3137
02:40:23,170 --> 02:40:24,600
but they think there's something out 
there.

3138
02:40:24,601 --> 02:40:25,434
And one of us,
one of the theories that I had read was 

3139
02:40:28,621 --> 02:40:32,340
that it could be some sort of a dwarf 
star that is a,

3140
02:40:32,341 --> 02:40:35,430
that exists so far out there that we 
can't see it.

3141
02:40:35,700 --> 02:40:36,900
Oh,
well the brown door,

3142
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:39,850
I mean,
walter cutting didn't,

3143
02:40:39,851 --> 02:40:43,050
who runs,
who started sea pack would be,

3144
02:40:43,051 --> 02:40:44,430
I don't know.
He knows about that.

3145
02:40:44,440 --> 02:40:45,273
I'll be seeing him in a few days and 
some interesting stuff going on at seed 

3146
02:40:48,891 --> 02:40:49,800
packets.
It's strange.

3147
02:40:49,801 --> 02:40:52,880
You didn't know about it.
Well you know about the planet that they

3148
02:40:52,930 --> 02:40:53,940
were pretty sure of.
Right.

3149
02:40:55,130 --> 02:40:56,640
Do you know about that?
I think,

3150
02:40:57,120 --> 02:40:58,410
well,
let's see if he could find that.

3151
02:40:58,411 --> 02:40:59,244
Like they,
they think that somewhere outside of 

3152
02:41:01,081 --> 02:41:05,670
Pluto that there is a large body,
they don't know what it is.

3153
02:41:05,670 --> 02:41:06,503
They don't know exactly how big it is,
but they think it's far larger than the 

3154
02:41:08,341 --> 02:41:09,300
earth.
Uh,

3155
02:41:09,390 --> 02:41:11,310
at least four times larger than the 
earth.

3156
02:41:12,270 --> 02:41:13,103
And that it exists and it's,
it's gravitational effect is having a 

3157
02:41:16,921 --> 02:41:17,754
response here.
It is new dwarf planet discovered far 

3158
02:41:20,251 --> 02:41:21,690
beyond Pluto's or no,
Jamie.

3159
02:41:21,691 --> 02:41:24,120
That's not it at all.
I think that's a different,

3160
02:41:24,121 --> 02:41:27,450
that's a dwarf planet.
This is something that's much larger.

3161
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:30,120
This is like a,
they think it's larger than earth.

3162
02:41:30,121 --> 02:41:30,954
Lou just look up planet four times 
larger than Earth believe to be outside 

3163
02:41:35,281 --> 02:41:36,114
of the solar system.
They think it's a part of the solar 

3164
02:41:37,711 --> 02:41:40,410
system,
but it's on this gigantic orgo like way,

3165
02:41:40,411 --> 02:41:41,520
way,
way out there.

3166
02:41:43,740 --> 02:41:45,810
So most of them are binary star systems,
right?

3167
02:41:45,811 --> 02:41:46,920
Most of them.
I think so.

3168
02:41:46,921 --> 02:41:49,110
Yeah.
Shock would know that.

3169
02:41:49,340 --> 02:41:51,840
He knows.
Is astronomy a lot better than I do.

3170
02:41:52,470 --> 02:41:53,303
But it's interesting if there is some 
sort of a star or a dead star out there 

3171
02:41:57,990 --> 02:41:59,850
way out there.
Yeah.

3172
02:42:00,210 --> 02:42:03,030
And then it's affecting us.
It's causing our earth to wobble.

3173
02:42:03,450 --> 02:42:04,290
Maybe.
Yeah.

3174
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:09,390
I mean here it is as Toronto merce say a
nap.

3175
02:42:09,430 --> 02:42:10,241
No,
no,

3176
02:42:10,241 --> 02:42:10,531
no,
no,

3177
02:42:10,531 --> 02:42:10,980
not,
nope.

3178
02:42:10,980 --> 02:42:11,731
Do Nothing.
Does that.

3179
02:42:11,731 --> 02:42:13,800
It looks bad.
Is that it?

3180
02:42:14,530 --> 02:42:15,540
Well,
Neptune's big.

3181
02:42:16,030 --> 02:42:19,080
It could be.
It might be hit January 20th yeah.

3182
02:42:19,081 --> 02:42:19,914
Okay.
That's right.

3183
02:42:20,820 --> 02:42:22,110
Yeah.
I didn't see that one.

3184
02:42:22,530 --> 02:42:23,363
The claim is the strongest yet in a 
century's long search for planet x 

3185
02:42:26,101 --> 02:42:26,934
beyond Neptune nuquest has been plagued 
by far fetched claims and even outright 

3186
02:42:30,721 --> 02:42:31,554
quackery.
But the new evidence comes from a pair 

3187
02:42:33,961 --> 02:42:36,090
of respected planetary scientists.

3188
02:42:36,150 --> 02:42:38,160
I want to say that guy,
the language,

3189
02:42:38,370 --> 02:42:41,610
look at the language yet it's quackery.
If they don't agree,

3190
02:42:41,611 --> 02:42:44,550
and if it's not one of their own,
and if it's one of their own,

3191
02:42:44,700 --> 02:42:48,500
it's respected until somebody comes 
along and shows that they're wrong.

3192
02:42:48,630 --> 02:42:49,463
Right.
But their language is tempered by guys 

3193
02:42:50,911 --> 02:42:52,710
like Zacharias H isn't it?
Well,

3194
02:42:52,711 --> 02:42:54,300
yeah,
he brings it on himself.

3195
02:42:54,301 --> 02:42:55,134
That's right.
Right.

3196
02:42:55,170 --> 02:42:56,850
But some of that stuff,
it's,

3197
02:42:56,890 --> 02:42:58,020
it's,
it's equal.

3198
02:42:58,021 --> 02:42:58,854
That's why I call them the core 
academics because every week there's 

3199
02:43:01,711 --> 02:43:02,544
something coming along this proving 
stuff that they'd been insisting has 

3200
02:43:05,371 --> 02:43:08,400
been right for the last 10 or 15 or 20 
years.

3201
02:43:08,490 --> 02:43:10,500
Look at this thing.
But they're never quacks.

3202
02:43:10,530 --> 02:43:12,010
They think it orbits the sun every

3203
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:13,450
15,000
years.

3204
02:43:13,810 --> 02:43:14,643
Right.
Yeah.

3205
02:43:14,760 --> 02:43:15,790
Okay.
Wow.

3206
02:43:16,300 --> 02:43:18,760
That's awesome.
I mean it's just,

3207
02:43:18,761 --> 02:43:21,670
it's so interesting.
We know so much,

3208
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:25,120
but so little at the same time.
You know,

3209
02:43:25,121 --> 02:43:26,110
uh,
I think it was Dennis.

3210
02:43:26,140 --> 02:43:26,973
Yeah.
Dennis Mckenna had this great saying 

3211
02:43:27,911 --> 02:43:31,110
that when the bonfire of,
uh,

3212
02:43:31,840 --> 02:43:33,100
I was a,
how they work,

3213
02:43:33,230 --> 02:43:34,063
a bonfire of understanding grows,
it illuminates the surface area of 

3214
02:43:38,711 --> 02:43:39,990
ignorance.
Well,

3215
02:43:40,160 --> 02:43:41,100
good line.
Yeah.

3216
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:44,080
That you realize like the brighter the 
light,

3217
02:43:44,290 --> 02:43:44,981
like,
wow,

3218
02:43:44,981 --> 02:43:46,990
there's so much you don't know.
And then all the,

3219
02:43:47,140 --> 02:43:50,290
you have to distinguish between 
knowledge and understanding.

3220
02:43:50,770 --> 02:43:54,010
The example with the crack epidemic 
egyptologists they,

3221
02:43:54,490 --> 02:43:55,323
they have a lot of facts that it's this 
well so that they do not understand at 

3222
02:43:58,451 --> 02:43:59,650
all.
And that's why,

3223
02:43:59,651 --> 02:44:00,484
I mean my own work schwaller is on work,
couldn't have been done without all of 

3224
02:44:04,331 --> 02:44:09,331
that careful factual work.
Let the Egyptologist and what I do,

3225
02:44:09,441 --> 02:44:10,274
who would we do?
I mean those of us who are looking into 

3226
02:44:11,891 --> 02:44:12,724
this,
we take that factual material and 

3227
02:44:14,291 --> 02:44:15,124
Schwaller rise it and that gives us a 
certain degree of understanding those 

3228
02:44:18,700 --> 02:44:22,000
Derek stone to have it all those jerks.
Let's go back to the slides.

3229
02:44:24,220 --> 02:44:25,810
What else you got here that you want to 
show us?

3230
02:44:26,050 --> 02:44:26,883
I don't know.
This is a lot but some stuff I want to 

3231
02:44:28,151 --> 02:44:29,140
skip.
Okay,

3232
02:44:29,141 --> 02:44:29,974
keep going.
I wanted to skip stuff now cause I'm 

3233
02:44:31,631 --> 02:44:33,760
getting,
I'm running out of words,

3234
02:44:33,761 --> 02:44:34,950
which is hard to do.
These are the,

3235
02:44:34,970 --> 02:44:39,370
that's one of those very hard stone 
vase,

3236
02:44:39,890 --> 02:44:40,723
um,
with this thin lip and the walls of the 

3237
02:44:42,431 --> 02:44:45,190
vas are about as thick as the rim of the
lip.

3238
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:48,130
And this is all made out of one,
one,

3239
02:44:48,220 --> 02:44:49,053
uh,
piece of a very hard stone cold green 

3240
02:44:51,221 --> 02:44:52,054
shifts.
And we think actually shocking myself 

3241
02:44:54,430 --> 02:44:56,920
and as an idea,
if I had another friend of mine,

3242
02:44:56,990 --> 02:44:57,823
good,
very good writer named Paul William 

3243
02:44:59,140 --> 02:45:03,240
Roberts was his suggestion that hey,
maybe these stone thinks it's,

3244
02:45:03,241 --> 02:45:04,074
it'll quite a few of them date from the 
earlier period and had were kept as 

3245
02:45:08,981 --> 02:45:11,500
sacred objects all of those years.

3246
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:15,730
And of course if they were kept in 
guarded and not broken and a hammer,

3247
02:45:15,740 --> 02:45:19,750
brexit but were kept in touch in in one 
piece,

3248
02:45:20,260 --> 02:45:22,570
you know,
x number of thousand years that wouldn't

3249
02:45:22,571 --> 02:45:23,404
be weathered or anything,
they'd be fine as long as they were 

3250
02:45:25,391 --> 02:45:26,224
protected.
Now is there any speculation whatsoever 

3251
02:45:29,021 --> 02:45:32,340
as to the method that they use to create
something like this?

3252
02:45:32,350 --> 02:45:33,183
Some stupid ones.
Let's hear the stupid ones so that 

3253
02:45:36,250 --> 02:45:37,083
they're shown with bow drills that you 
know that the way like you light a fire 

3254
02:45:41,981 --> 02:45:42,814
with sticks like this.
Well it's a kind of a drill that they 

3255
02:45:45,611 --> 02:45:48,820
put in there with bulls of some kind of,
you know,

3256
02:45:48,821 --> 02:45:53,590
hard stone and once you get the drill 
thing down you can kind of work your way

3257
02:45:53,591 --> 02:45:55,840
around and gradually,
gradually,

3258
02:45:55,841 --> 02:45:56,674
gradually hollow out the inside.
This seems insane to me and that it 

3259
02:46:03,251 --> 02:46:04,430
would take,
I mean,

3260
02:46:04,480 --> 02:46:05,313
one of those guys should devote his life
to taking a block of green schist and 

3261
02:46:09,321 --> 02:46:13,340
trying that method and see how far he 
gets in 10 or 15 years.

3262
02:46:13,341 --> 02:46:17,660
It's very hard to imagine that they 
could do that with a method like that,

3263
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:21,540
but it's otherwise no one knows.
But isn't that like sort of a,

3264
02:46:21,660 --> 02:46:22,493
it doesn't balance out with the insanity
of building a pyramid in the first 

3265
02:46:25,321 --> 02:46:26,154
place.

3266
02:46:26,630 --> 02:46:26,910
Okay.

3267
02:46:26,910 --> 02:46:28,170
I mean,
building a pyramid,

3268
02:46:28,171 --> 02:46:29,004
it's just incredible undertaking.
Then they say that like if you cut in 

3269
02:46:31,291 --> 02:46:34,470
place 10 songs a day,
it would take you 664 years.

3270
02:46:34,710 --> 02:46:36,320
It is mind boggling.
Yeah.

3271
02:46:36,440 --> 02:46:37,290
But,
but,

3272
02:46:37,320 --> 02:46:38,153
uh,
in fact,

3273
02:46:38,570 --> 02:46:42,170
um,
it's quite clear that they did it.

3274
02:46:42,171 --> 02:46:43,004
It's,
it's not at all clear that they did it 

3275
02:46:44,301 --> 02:46:48,200
in the allotted 25 years as something 
that's sort of why they did it.

3276
02:46:48,260 --> 02:46:48,951
I mean,
again,

3277
02:46:48,951 --> 02:46:49,784
does he do it to an academic?
The only possible explanation is that 

3278
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:54,913
they were tombs,
even though there's no evidence 

3279
02:46:55,821 --> 02:46:58,700
whatsoever that they were tombs.
But if they say they were tombs,

3280
02:46:58,701 --> 02:47:00,170
they don't need that.
What do you think they were?

3281
02:47:00,650 --> 02:47:04,980
I don't know except what I'm pretty sure
is that they weren't tombs in the,

3282
02:47:04,981 --> 02:47:07,420
and they weren't tunes only.
My,

3283
02:47:07,450 --> 02:47:12,450
my gentle sense of it is that since 
everything and Egypt has as its focus,

3284
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:17,600
the quest for immortality in some way,
shape or form,

3285
02:47:18,650 --> 02:47:19,483
they enhance that quest.
They make it possible to do things that 

3286
02:47:24,260 --> 02:47:26,080
you wouldn't otherwise do.
I can tell you,

3287
02:47:26,120 --> 02:47:28,220
you've got enough people together and 
come on a trip,

3288
02:47:28,490 --> 02:47:32,630
I'll come on your own and we do our two 
hour meditation in the pyramid.

3289
02:47:33,080 --> 02:47:37,400
You come out of there and knowing that 
you not been just in a quiet bathroom,

3290
02:47:37,850 --> 02:47:38,980
um,
it,

3291
02:47:39,340 --> 02:47:42,950
it,
this place surges with power.

3292
02:47:43,110 --> 02:47:45,020
You've got a group of people in there,
all of whom are,

3293
02:47:45,470 --> 02:47:48,710
especially if are some whoever the 
practice of meditation,

3294
02:47:49,700 --> 02:47:51,200
it's,
it's really,

3295
02:47:51,410 --> 02:47:56,410
it's something and I mean you come out 
of there knowing that you've experienced

3296
02:47:58,281 --> 02:48:00,170
something that you've not experienced 
before.

3297
02:48:00,530 --> 02:48:04,610
So how they were used and to what end,
I don't know.

3298
02:48:04,910 --> 02:48:05,743
I mean this is a quite common theory 
that there were sites of high 

3299
02:48:09,081 --> 02:48:09,914
initiation.
Well there are sites of high initiation 

3300
02:48:12,141 --> 02:48:14,420
and when you understand what initiation 
involves,

3301
02:48:15,280 --> 02:48:17,300
that's not a,
that's not a dumb theory.

3302
02:48:17,301 --> 02:48:18,134
It is a dumb theory.
If you don't think there's such a thing 

3303
02:48:20,480 --> 02:48:21,313
as initiation and if you think that 
illumination is dependent upon 

3304
02:48:24,501 --> 02:48:25,334
electricity,
well you're not be able to think of 

3305
02:48:27,561 --> 02:48:29,450
Egyptian.
But if,

3306
02:48:30,020 --> 02:48:34,580
if you've been to the Po to the places 
and have experienced it yourself,

3307
02:48:35,180 --> 02:48:36,013
the power of these places then exploit 
explanations of that sort even though 

3308
02:48:38,931 --> 02:48:40,160
they don't count as

3309
02:48:42,090 --> 02:48:45,520
speculative for sure.
But when you don't have any evidence for

3310
02:48:45,521 --> 02:48:47,840
them being tombs,
that's pretty speculative to right.

3311
02:48:48,120 --> 02:48:51,360
And building them is incredible.
Beyond belief.

3312
02:48:51,450 --> 02:48:54,180
Lighting them up is only slightly less 
incredible.

3313
02:48:54,210 --> 02:48:55,140
Yeah,
it's the whole thing.

3314
02:48:55,710 --> 02:48:58,770
Do you have any theories at all is how 
they could build some sort of a stone?

3315
02:48:59,520 --> 02:49:00,353
No,
no.

3316
02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:02,640
I don't.
Pretty incredible stuff.

3317
02:49:03,240 --> 02:49:05,840
But let's go up cause we got a lot of 
stuff and I don't want to take her.

3318
02:49:06,210 --> 02:49:07,080
Okay.
That's us.

3319
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:10,500
My criminal partner,
Boris swinging the digital sledge hammer

3320
02:49:11,070 --> 02:49:11,903
looking for underground caverns.
So what did you hit that thing and it 

3321
02:49:15,121 --> 02:49:19,140
makes us sound and this sound 
seismograph two goes into the earth.

3322
02:49:19,170 --> 02:49:20,003
Interesting.
The next slide is what we found and 

3323
02:49:22,081 --> 02:49:24,520
there it has the Aa that's,
that's the,

3324
02:49:24,610 --> 02:49:27,780
that's the,
that is a cavern or a chamber or of some

3325
02:49:27,781 --> 02:49:28,614
sort.
It's a void underneath the bedrock and 

3326
02:49:31,591 --> 02:49:32,424
that's the so called hall of records.
People think that that's Edgar Casey is 

3327
02:49:35,701 --> 02:49:38,190
talking about.
We're iffy about it.

3328
02:49:38,191 --> 02:49:39,024
Other than that,
the seismograph does not know how to 

3329
02:49:41,671 --> 02:49:42,504
channel.
So it just says what's there and it 

3330
02:49:46,100 --> 02:49:48,750
knows there's a void and at the very 
back it's a little bit,

3331
02:49:48,960 --> 02:49:49,793
you don't see,
it's the edge of the CC at the very end 

3332
02:49:51,781 --> 02:49:55,410
by the rump that is also a chamber and 
that's absolutely,

3333
02:49:55,411 --> 02:49:56,244
it's known that it's there and this 
gives you the same profile sizemore 

3334
02:49:58,840 --> 02:49:59,673
logically,
but there's no seismograph Bentley's 

3335
02:50:01,260 --> 02:50:01,690
things.

3336
02:50:01,690 --> 02:50:02,501
Yeah,
the back one,

3337
02:50:02,501 --> 02:50:03,334
there's a way,
it's a very rough cut chamber and 

3338
02:50:05,131 --> 02:50:05,964
there's a just behind them,
one of those stones because if you pull 

3339
02:50:07,561 --> 02:50:11,190
it away and you can get in and it's a 
room rough,

3340
02:50:11,220 --> 02:50:12,053
it's very rough.
But about the size of the room that 

3341
02:50:13,171 --> 02:50:15,540
we're in here at the studio and that's a
room.

3342
02:50:15,541 --> 02:50:16,374
So if that's a room,
then it stands to reason that seismic 

3343
02:50:19,471 --> 02:50:23,220
graphical reason anyway,
that a is also a,

3344
02:50:23,720 --> 02:50:27,570
a cavern or a grotto or construction or 
something.

3345
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:30,960
So what we're looking at with a,
when you see all those circles around it

3346
02:50:30,961 --> 02:50:32,640
and the,
the rough shape of it,

3347
02:50:32,670 --> 02:50:34,830
that's the shape that they believe the 
room is.

3348
02:50:34,831 --> 02:50:35,664
So it'd be similar to the one that's at 
the ramp where it would be like kind of 

3349
02:50:38,131 --> 02:50:39,410
a rod meld.
Well,

3350
02:50:39,411 --> 02:50:40,980
the,
the seismic graphic,

3351
02:50:40,981 --> 02:50:41,814
those are the,
I forget the top of the lines of 

3352
02:50:43,871 --> 02:50:47,160
something that gives you the depths of,
the thing is that,

3353
02:50:47,190 --> 02:50:50,640
and but it's not like a square 90 degree
angle.

3354
02:50:51,040 --> 02:50:54,320
It's roughly rectangular.
Says Tom,

3355
02:50:54,470 --> 02:50:55,303
Tom Dubecky,
who is our Geo Geo physicist who was 

3356
02:50:57,331 --> 02:50:58,164
doing that work.
So what's the hold up as far as 

3357
02:50:59,341 --> 02:51:01,230
examining that?
Well,

3358
02:51:01,260 --> 02:51:05,730
two one,
they don't want to be wrong to that.

3359
02:51:05,731 --> 02:51:08,100
It's very difficult to do.
It's under about five.

3360
02:51:08,150 --> 02:51:10,280
The about 15 feet of bedrock that 
haven't,

3361
02:51:10,740 --> 02:51:15,480
the Sphinx is a,
probably the the most,

3362
02:51:16,320 --> 02:51:19,950
let's say that the archeological hot 
spot of the universe.

3363
02:51:20,340 --> 02:51:24,070
I mean nothing is more open to,
you know,

3364
02:51:24,970 --> 02:51:27,790
excitement and all the rest of it is the
swinks.

3365
02:51:29,550 --> 02:51:30,383
Secondly,
the water level has risen so that that 

3366
02:51:33,330 --> 02:51:36,390
whole chamber is probably filled with 
water now.

3367
02:51:36,391 --> 02:51:41,090
So anything that isn't stone would have 
been obliterated long ago when I was at,

3368
02:51:41,280 --> 02:51:43,230
he got down there and you're found with 
wet scrolls,

3369
02:51:43,320 --> 02:51:46,250
well maybe or or stone something or in 
that,

3370
02:51:46,680 --> 02:51:47,513
but in theory you could put a little 
fiber optic something down there and 

3371
02:51:50,491 --> 02:51:51,324
study it,
but they don't want to be wrong about 

3372
02:51:53,551 --> 02:51:55,500
this and anything invasive.

3373
02:51:56,100 --> 02:51:59,160
The Sphinx is really in disastrous 
conditions.

3374
02:51:59,161 --> 02:52:02,250
So any little vibration or something 
like that could,

3375
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,530
you know,
could could conceivably damage it.

3376
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:06,903
I don't worry about these things.
The geology is much more important as 

3377
02:52:09,941 --> 02:52:10,774
far as I'm concerned.
And my guess is that when we finally 

3378
02:52:13,361 --> 02:52:17,020
break open the port colors and capture 
all of the,

3379
02:52:17,980 --> 02:52:19,570
you know,
all of the capture,

3380
02:52:19,571 --> 02:52:20,840
all of the,
the,

3381
02:52:20,950 --> 02:52:22,620
the,
the core academics that,

3382
02:52:22,680 --> 02:52:24,250
that it protects it,
the moment,

3383
02:52:24,730 --> 02:52:28,570
um,
which I dunno,

3384
02:52:28,600 --> 02:52:30,310
maybe we'll waterboard them,
but anyway,

3385
02:52:30,330 --> 02:52:31,163
we can,
we capture all of the academics and get 

3386
02:52:33,131 --> 02:52:36,250
them the hell out of there at that point
when it gets,

3387
02:52:36,730 --> 02:52:37,563
when it is,
when it is accepted and these things do 

3388
02:52:39,881 --> 02:52:42,340
happen.
This is idea whose time has come,

3389
02:52:42,640 --> 02:52:44,770
when it has come,
things change.

3390
02:52:44,860 --> 02:52:49,000
And at that point maybe then the funding
shows up and the,

3391
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:49,953
and the,
and the determination comes up to 

3392
02:52:53,081 --> 02:52:58,081
actually look into that void or chamber 
and see if it is indeed avoid or chamber

3393
02:52:58,091 --> 02:52:58,924
and if there's something in there,
is it possible that there's some other 

3394
02:53:00,941 --> 02:53:02,910
things in Egypt that haven't been 
discovered yet?

3395
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,410
Load,
even though where they are a lot of them

3396
02:53:05,411 --> 02:53:06,430
because,
yeah,

3397
02:53:06,431 --> 02:53:09,020
but what do you call it?
Landsat,

3398
02:53:09,330 --> 02:53:11,590
uh,
infrared.

3399
02:53:11,950 --> 02:53:12,783
Something,
you know when you can photograph 

3400
02:53:13,390 --> 02:53:14,950
underground?
They have,

3401
02:53:14,951 --> 02:53:15,311
yeah,
they,

3402
02:53:15,311 --> 02:53:16,144
there are hundreds of sites that they 
know where their graves and tombs and 

3403
02:53:19,181 --> 02:53:21,310
stuff like that,
but most of them,

3404
02:53:21,340 --> 02:53:24,580
I don't think the,
I don't think that kind of photography,

3405
02:53:24,581 --> 02:53:25,414
I thought there's a name for it.
I don't think that kind of photography 

3406
02:53:28,151 --> 02:53:32,650
goes deep enough from for us to 
establish the,

3407
02:53:32,690 --> 02:53:36,190
the lost civilization.
It will be under the sand level.

3408
02:53:36,220 --> 02:53:37,053
It'll be at the bottom of the sand level
and so far at any rate it doesn't get 

3409
02:53:40,241 --> 02:53:42,790
down that deeply,
but they have lots of places to excavate

3410
02:53:42,791 --> 02:53:43,624
of that.
The money.

3411
02:53:45,400 --> 02:53:46,990
Let's keep going here.
Keep going.

3412
02:53:48,160 --> 02:53:49,150
Okay.
Well this is now,

3413
02:53:49,151 --> 02:53:52,480
this is chuck's book and he'll be at 
Seapak.

3414
02:53:52,510 --> 02:53:54,640
This is a recent book.
That's his last book.

3415
02:53:54,641 --> 02:53:55,660
Yeah.
That's a recent book.

3416
02:53:55,840 --> 02:53:56,673
The role of solar outbursts in our past 
and future for gotten civilizations of 

3417
02:54:00,611 --> 02:54:01,330
title.
Yeah,

3418
02:54:01,330 --> 02:54:02,590
very,
very interesting.

3419
02:54:02,860 --> 02:54:06,400
Very interesting thesis and backed up by
a lot by,

3420
02:54:06,750 --> 02:54:08,110
you know,
a lot of solid,

3421
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:11,500
a lot of solid scholarship and chocolate
would be at the seat pack.

3422
02:54:11,800 --> 02:54:14,890
This particular seat back,
so he thinks it was a,

3423
02:54:14,950 --> 02:54:15,783
uh,
a sore outburst more than they think it 

3424
02:54:18,701 --> 02:54:21,130
was an asteroidal impact.
He thinks,

3425
02:54:21,131 --> 02:54:24,130
although they're not necessarily 
antithetical the dates,

3426
02:54:24,460 --> 02:54:25,560
the dates,
in other words,

3427
02:54:25,561 --> 02:54:27,280
it could have been either.
I mean,

3428
02:54:27,281 --> 02:54:28,114
shock shock thinks that it's a,
an impact in the earlier catastrophe 

3429
02:54:34,481 --> 02:54:37,290
that brings on the younger dryas that,
that the,

3430
02:54:37,291 --> 02:54:38,124
the intensification of the Ice Age and 
he thinks that it's the solar outburst 

3431
02:54:42,490 --> 02:54:46,840
that that puts an end to the entire 
civilization and melts all the ice.

3432
02:54:47,080 --> 02:54:49,690
Whoa.
Wow.

3433
02:54:51,410 --> 02:54:53,180
A northern lights.
What else we got?

3434
02:54:53,670 --> 02:54:54,491
Well,
I'd keep going.

3435
02:54:54,491 --> 02:54:55,324
Does this go whisk by here because this 
is Anthony [inaudible] who was a 

3436
02:54:57,881 --> 02:54:59,930
physicist at the,
it's his thing.

3437
02:54:59,931 --> 02:55:00,764
Then here,
these are these figures that show up in 

3438
02:55:03,951 --> 02:55:04,400
the,

3439
02:55:04,400 --> 02:55:05,233
you know,
in,

3440
02:55:05,480 --> 02:55:08,990
in the electro,
through the electron microscope and that

3441
02:55:08,991 --> 02:55:09,824
are mirrored by those strange dancing 
multi-headed multi-armed figures at the 

3442
02:55:15,560 --> 02:55:19,610
petroglyphs at the top.
Usually at the upper registers of those,

3443
02:55:19,910 --> 02:55:24,910
of the petroglyph facade facade,
which also mirrors,

3444
02:55:26,001 --> 02:55:27,670
that's the wrong go wrong.
Go scripture.

3445
02:55:27,730 --> 02:55:32,570
Aftershock is fascinated by the so far 
untranslatable Rango rango script.

3446
02:55:32,850 --> 02:55:37,850
We're aside from Easter island,
which shows as as letters,

3447
02:55:38,091 --> 02:55:43,091
presumably those kinds of weird humanoid
figures.

3448
02:55:45,440 --> 02:55:49,940
One of the great mysteries of linguists.
Oh Yeah Huh?

3449
02:55:50,650 --> 02:55:51,483
Chro.
Qigong as at the bottom of the whole 

3450
02:55:55,371 --> 02:55:57,190
thing of my whole show.
Yup.

3451
02:55:57,680 --> 02:56:01,330
Really with a whole bunch of other stuff
that I wanted on it.

3452
02:56:01,340 --> 02:56:01,791
Not,
well,

3453
02:56:01,791 --> 02:56:03,980
some stuff I didn't want I wanted to 
whisk through,

3454
02:56:04,370 --> 02:56:05,203
but what was up there that maybe I'll 
send it to you is the map of them fuck 

3455
02:56:08,900 --> 02:56:13,040
stan of greater and Lesser Dumbfuckistan
which is,

3456
02:56:13,340 --> 02:56:18,340
which is very useful and my five cowboys
and then the graphic of the five cowboys

3457
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:23,300
jury graphic.
My stepson found it somewhere online,

3458
02:56:23,690 --> 02:56:27,080
but it really shows the fun.
It's cowboys and action,

3459
02:56:27,770 --> 02:56:28,910
which is,
as I said,

3460
02:56:28,911 --> 02:56:29,744
you pick up the pickup,
the daily newspaper or turn on the 

3461
02:56:32,571 --> 02:56:34,670
Internet and just see the cowboys at 
work.

3462
02:56:34,730 --> 02:56:37,770
You've been at this for a long time now.
Yeah,

3463
02:56:39,050 --> 02:56:42,750
late sixties [inaudible] I was born,
yeah.

3464
02:56:43,340 --> 02:56:48,340
I was born in 67 well that's a around 
that's around the time I came across.

3465
02:56:50,841 --> 02:56:52,130
Schwaller deliberate,
yes.

3466
02:56:52,910 --> 02:56:53,743
Around them.

3467
02:56:53,930 --> 02:56:58,930
Do you feel like people are slowly but 
surely starting to come around at these,

3468
02:57:00,100 --> 02:57:00,933
the,
the concepts of these ancient 

3469
02:57:01,491 --> 02:57:06,140
civilizations being not the primitive 
people that we've been told,

3470
02:57:06,141 --> 02:57:08,540
but maybe perhaps just really complex?

3471
02:57:08,590 --> 02:57:11,020
Oh yeah.
Well a lot of people,

3472
02:57:11,260 --> 02:57:12,990
the trouble is that it's,
that the,

3473
02:57:12,991 --> 02:57:14,800
the,
the picture is muddied.

3474
02:57:15,130 --> 02:57:15,963
I mean the academics there as almost as 
academics errors staunches ever in 

3475
02:57:19,781 --> 02:57:21,160
their,
in their delusion.

3476
02:57:21,520 --> 02:57:25,090
But the trouble is that the whole 
scenario is,

3477
02:57:25,540 --> 02:57:30,540
is muddied and it's almost unavoidable 
by ancient aliens in Zechariah said Chin

3478
02:57:30,761 --> 02:57:31,594
and a whole bunch of nutcases that think
that aliens built the pyramids and all 

3479
02:57:34,991 --> 02:57:37,030
of that sort of stuff.
So yes,

3480
02:57:37,031 --> 02:57:39,040
more people are interested,
but how many,

3481
02:57:39,430 --> 02:57:44,430
the percentage of those that are 
actually capable of,

3482
02:57:46,600 --> 02:57:47,433
of sifting the evidence and 
intellectually honest enough to accept 

3483
02:57:53,920 --> 02:57:58,750
what stands up to scrutiny and not 
numerically there,

3484
02:57:58,751 --> 02:58:00,430
there are lots more of them than they 
were,

3485
02:58:00,431 --> 02:58:01,264
but

3486
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:06,630
there are very,
very small percentage of very,

3487
02:58:06,990 --> 02:58:11,990
very small percentage of the populace 
that actually care or understand it.

3488
02:58:13,110 --> 02:58:13,943
But it only takes a certain small 
percentage of you ever tried to get 

3489
02:58:16,321 --> 02:58:18,630
your,
your magical Egypt series on Netflix?

3490
02:58:19,920 --> 02:58:20,660
No,
not,

3491
02:58:20,660 --> 02:58:21,493
not on Netflix,
but they probably wouldn't take it 

3492
02:58:23,310 --> 02:58:24,143
because they'd have to,
they'd have to make a cup to cut a 

3493
02:58:28,711 --> 02:58:32,160
really lousy deal with them and be,
um,

3494
02:58:32,440 --> 02:58:33,320
the,
the,

3495
02:58:33,321 --> 02:58:35,370
the numbers probably wouldn't justify 
it.

3496
02:58:35,430 --> 02:58:36,580
I don't know about that.
Well,

3497
02:58:36,581 --> 02:58:38,790
they did love documentaries.
And why would you think that,

3498
02:58:38,791 --> 02:58:40,800
uh,
they would want to cut a lousy deal?

3499
02:58:41,250 --> 02:58:42,011
They do.
I mean,

3500
02:58:42,011 --> 02:58:42,540
they,
they,

3501
02:58:42,540 --> 02:58:43,500
they,
they,

3502
02:58:43,860 --> 02:58:47,190
they really,
they really don't give you much.

3503
02:58:47,550 --> 02:58:49,740
I mean,
the mystery of the swings is on there,

3504
02:58:49,741 --> 02:58:53,520
but it's the guy who,
I'm the guy who,

3505
02:58:53,521 --> 02:58:54,450
uh,
who did the,

3506
02:58:54,510 --> 02:58:57,930
who does the reproduction of it,
that,

3507
02:58:57,990 --> 02:58:58,823
that negotiated with them and chance the
downside of chances that he's a bit 

3508
02:59:04,651 --> 02:59:07,350
paranoid about letting stuff out of his 
control.

3509
02:59:07,650 --> 02:59:09,240
So I've told him,
you know,

3510
02:59:09,241 --> 02:59:10,074
cause that's the thing on Netflix or I 
mean people have stolen it and it's on 

3511
02:59:13,861 --> 02:59:16,310
youtube in a very,
you know,

3512
02:59:16,320 --> 02:59:17,670
in a very,
you know,

3513
02:59:17,671 --> 02:59:22,110
it's at the reproduction you really 
don't see it unless you actually own the

3514
02:59:22,111 --> 02:59:25,620
DVD and,
but it's chances baby as far as,

3515
02:59:25,710 --> 02:59:28,690
as,
as pitching it and he doesn't,

3516
02:59:28,691 --> 02:59:29,524
then it's not,
so he hasn't even brought it up to 

3517
02:59:30,931 --> 02:59:32,820
Netflix.
I don't know if he has or not.

3518
02:59:32,850 --> 02:59:35,070
It seems like it'd be right up their 
alley you would think.

3519
02:59:35,071 --> 02:59:35,904
But I,
I've given up that of arguing the case 

3520
02:59:38,131 --> 02:59:40,200
of he doesn't,
it says it's his,

3521
02:59:40,260 --> 02:59:42,090
it's his baby is,
it's not,

3522
02:59:42,150 --> 02:59:44,700
I mean it is and it's not,
but it's a big part of your work.

3523
02:59:44,760 --> 02:59:45,593
I mean,
I just think that that would be a great 

3524
02:59:46,771 --> 02:59:48,660
venue for it.
I think it would be too,

3525
02:59:48,661 --> 02:59:49,494
but you write him and tell him that I 
have a netflix trying to get on your 

3526
02:59:54,601 --> 02:59:56,490
show for a while and hasn't been,
well,

3527
02:59:56,491 --> 02:59:58,270
he's been emailing you a couple of 
times.

3528
02:59:58,590 --> 03:00:01,740
Nobody me on the wrong address and 
nobody responded.

3529
03:00:01,741 --> 03:00:06,210
So he gives up anyway.
I never got any emails from the dude.

3530
03:00:06,950 --> 03:00:08,760
Well,
I'll talk about that after the show.

3531
03:00:08,761 --> 03:00:09,960
We'll try to figure that out.
But,

3532
03:00:10,260 --> 03:00:11,093
uh,
I got a comedy special coming out on 

3533
03:00:12,571 --> 03:00:14,120
Netflix and October.
Yeah.

3534
03:00:14,140 --> 03:00:17,010
Be Happy to talk to them and say,
Hey,

3535
03:00:17,160 --> 03:00:21,420
this is something I should look at.
I don't have any idea what kind of deals

3536
03:00:21,421 --> 03:00:22,254
they cut in terms of documentaries,
but what I do know is that what you did 

3537
03:00:24,541 --> 03:00:26,610
is amazing.
And then I think that it would,

3538
03:00:26,611 --> 03:00:27,444
uh,
it would,

3539
03:00:27,750 --> 03:00:32,750
it would be great for everybody to have 
that have more access by just the,

3540
03:00:32,970 --> 03:00:37,970
just the sheer depth of the information 
when you go over like the temple and man

3541
03:00:38,491 --> 03:00:39,324
and all the different,
that just that the different incredible 

3542
03:00:42,811 --> 03:00:45,840
structures that exist in Egypt that most
people don't even discuss.

3543
03:00:45,870 --> 03:00:46,703
Oh,
they don't know about and they don't 

3544
03:00:47,431 --> 03:00:48,960
want to discuss it,
but chances,

3545
03:00:49,410 --> 03:00:50,243
I mean,
that's,

3546
03:00:50,580 --> 03:00:51,413
you know,
the way to really watch it because 

3547
03:00:52,530 --> 03:00:54,810
people have told me this too.
I mean,

3548
03:00:54,811 --> 03:00:55,644
I'm not,
I'm not much into even dope by casually 

3549
03:00:58,561 --> 03:01:00,280
smoke at in a while.
And I'm not much,

3550
03:01:00,840 --> 03:01:03,400
Bob Cares.
My vice such as it is,

3551
03:01:03,540 --> 03:01:07,180
I don't even consider it vicious.
But um,

3552
03:01:08,290 --> 03:01:09,123
watching that,
a couple of talks to watch magical it 

3553
03:01:11,940 --> 03:01:14,170
with a couple of Tux cause it slows 
things down.

3554
03:01:14,620 --> 03:01:15,453
The editing on that as,
as breathtaking and there's a hypnotic 

3555
03:01:18,611 --> 03:01:20,800
quality to it.
It's really,

3556
03:01:20,890 --> 03:01:23,320
I mean it's an extraordinary achievement
in shock.

3557
03:01:23,321 --> 03:01:27,820
Did it on second shock.
I mean chance did it on a zero budget,

3558
03:01:27,821 --> 03:01:29,650
you know,
and doing all of the photography,

3559
03:01:29,680 --> 03:01:32,530
I mean everything single handed on 
nothing.

3560
03:01:32,860 --> 03:01:36,520
It's really the heroic production and,
and you know,

3561
03:01:36,521 --> 03:01:38,380
and we made nothing out of it.

3562
03:01:38,950 --> 03:01:40,840
Let's try to get it on Netflix.
I really want,

3563
03:01:40,841 --> 03:01:43,510
I'm going to try to make an attempt so 
when you attend,

3564
03:01:43,511 --> 03:01:44,010
yeah,
I will.

3565
03:01:44,010 --> 03:01:45,370
I will.
I'm going to try to make an attempt.

3566
03:01:45,371 --> 03:01:47,440
I'm going to bring it to them and have a
conversation with them.

3567
03:01:47,441 --> 03:01:48,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

3568
03:01:48,550 --> 03:01:49,730
They stink.
Give,

3569
03:01:50,350 --> 03:01:52,570
give him a copy.
They might not even know.

3570
03:01:52,630 --> 03:01:53,311
You know,
I mean I,

3571
03:01:53,311 --> 03:01:55,470
I guarantee they don't,
they don't have a lead out now.

3572
03:01:55,840 --> 03:01:58,330
I really think it's one of the great 
works.

3573
03:01:58,990 --> 03:02:01,480
I think it's to May and it's so in 
depth.

3574
03:02:01,481 --> 03:02:04,510
It's so in depth into the only way you 
could do it was to self produce it.

3575
03:02:04,720 --> 03:02:05,441
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

3576
03:02:05,441 --> 03:02:07,500
You couldn't get anyone to do that and 
nobody would go,

3577
03:02:07,520 --> 03:02:11,050
you're going to do eight dvds on enough.
What are you out of your mind?

3578
03:02:11,051 --> 03:02:13,900
Nobody's going to watch all that.
I watch it like three or four times.

3579
03:02:13,910 --> 03:02:15,340
Lots of people do.
I mean people,

3580
03:02:15,390 --> 03:02:16,750
you have a magical Egypt too,
right?

3581
03:02:16,960 --> 03:02:17,793
Well we're working on it.
We don't have the funding and then 

3582
03:02:19,831 --> 03:02:22,510
actually this is chances baby now cause 
I'm,

3583
03:02:24,820 --> 03:02:29,800
anytime he wants me I'm there for him.
But I'm not in any position to to really

3584
03:02:29,801 --> 03:02:32,230
help with it because I'm so swamped with
my own stuff.

3585
03:02:32,640 --> 03:02:34,450
But yeah,
he covered in magical Egypt.

3586
03:02:34,480 --> 03:02:35,970
I don't know.
I don't know.

3587
03:02:35,990 --> 03:02:40,030
We've got the first one semi done,
but I don't know what he's got in mind.

3588
03:02:40,031 --> 03:02:42,130
And this is what Australia,
so I don't get to see him.

3589
03:02:42,131 --> 03:02:46,750
The doll and it's even skype is,
is not good for in depth,

3590
03:02:46,751 --> 03:02:48,710
evening long conversation.
No,

3591
03:02:49,230 --> 03:02:52,180
I don't know.
But I'll bet if you showed it to Netflix

3592
03:02:52,181 --> 03:02:54,730
and they expressed an interest,
he'd be interested,

3593
03:02:54,760 --> 03:02:56,110
well I'm going to do that.
I'm going to do that.

3594
03:02:56,110 --> 03:02:58,150
I'm going to bring them a copy.
We're going to see what we could do.

3595
03:02:58,630 --> 03:02:59,463
I think it's,
it's one of those things that I really 

3596
03:03:00,910 --> 03:03:01,743
believe that people should say.
Oh that and I think that if you could 

3597
03:03:03,431 --> 03:03:04,264
get it on Netflix and I could tweet it 
and let the world know and try to get 

3598
03:03:07,991 --> 03:03:10,120
people to spread the word.
I think once people see it,

3599
03:03:10,121 --> 03:03:12,580
they just start like that making of a 
murderer thing.

3600
03:03:12,581 --> 03:03:13,414
You know,
that that caught all that traction 

3601
03:03:14,470 --> 03:03:17,650
entirely because it was on Netflix and 
word of mouth mostly.

3602
03:03:18,070 --> 03:03:18,920
I really think that,
that,

3603
03:03:19,270 --> 03:03:21,220
that magical Egypt is one of those 
things.

3604
03:03:21,221 --> 03:03:21,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

3605
03:03:21,700 --> 03:03:22,533
Well what I would like to do actually,
and I hope my pal clay and some other 

3606
03:03:25,901 --> 03:03:29,260
people are going to help me with this.
I'd like to get some of my other,

3607
03:03:29,740 --> 03:03:32,910
when I'm wearing my other hat and my,
my uh,

3608
03:03:33,700 --> 03:03:37,050
my writers,
my Bohemian Barei instead of my Egypt,

3609
03:03:37,051 --> 03:03:39,240
a logical pith helmet.
Cause I've got a,

3610
03:03:39,280 --> 03:03:44,280
I mean a whole lifetimes worth of work,
much of which has been produced but none

3611
03:03:44,441 --> 03:03:45,670
of it really,
um,

3612
03:03:46,300 --> 03:03:50,050
commercially successful.
And it just sitting there waiting to get

3613
03:03:50,051 --> 03:03:50,884
done.
And netflix would be the perfect venue 

3614
03:03:52,841 --> 03:03:56,390
for it if I had something to show him.
Um,

3615
03:03:56,560 --> 03:03:58,340
you know,
because they do production,

3616
03:03:58,340 --> 03:04:00,900
I mean they,
they're producers now too.

3617
03:04:01,370 --> 03:04:02,203
It's an interesting time.
I mean that's one of the best things 

3618
03:04:03,741 --> 03:04:04,574
about the internet is that something 
like that can kind of spring up and 

3619
03:04:07,731 --> 03:04:10,640
become a bigger net worth than any of 
the networks on television.

3620
03:04:10,641 --> 03:04:11,030
You know,
that's,

3621
03:04:11,030 --> 03:04:11,863
that's the upside.
Well the networks are about to die and 

3622
03:04:13,731 --> 03:04:16,270
good riddance.
Well it's a silly idea what,

3623
03:04:16,310 --> 03:04:18,770
it was good back when there was no other
ideas.

3624
03:04:19,090 --> 03:04:19,923
You had to sit through those commercials
and wait for the next segment and then 

3625
03:04:22,401 --> 03:04:24,700
you watch 10 minutes and the is popped 
on again.

3626
03:04:24,710 --> 03:04:25,543
You rolled your eyes and waited for the 
commercials again and that all that 

3627
03:04:28,371 --> 03:04:30,080
stuff's nonsense.
Now you watch a commercial,

3628
03:04:30,081 --> 03:04:32,420
now you're like,
what is this silly thing?

3629
03:04:32,450 --> 03:04:35,390
Well the Internet's full of commercials.
So it is,

3630
03:04:35,480 --> 03:04:36,560
it is,
but at least,

3631
03:04:36,561 --> 03:04:37,394
uh,
at least they're usually at the 

3632
03:04:38,151 --> 03:04:40,790
beginning of a video and then in the 
middle,

3633
03:04:40,791 --> 03:04:43,190
sometimes things near there.

3634
03:04:43,520 --> 03:04:44,840
Anyway.
Anyway,

3635
03:04:44,900 --> 03:04:46,310
magical.
Egypt is awesome.

3636
03:04:46,370 --> 03:04:48,040
You're awesome.
Appreciate you coming on.

3637
03:04:48,041 --> 03:04:50,830
And Joe,
glad we got a chance to meet in person.

3638
03:04:50,990 --> 03:04:54,530
It's a big difference even though skype 
is the next best thing.

3639
03:04:54,580 --> 03:04:55,371
Yeah.
Two,

3640
03:04:55,371 --> 03:04:59,300
three dimensional meeting.
It isn't three dimensional meetings.

3641
03:04:59,490 --> 03:05:02,180
Not as fun to be here.
And thanks for inviting me.

3642
03:05:02,240 --> 03:05:04,550
Thank you.
And thank you for all of your work cause

3643
03:05:04,551 --> 03:05:09,350
I think you've done a great service to 
the world to sort of shine light on this

3644
03:05:09,351 --> 03:05:12,400
amazing civilization.
Much appreciate it.

3645
03:05:12,440 --> 03:05:16,760
All Right Ladies and gentlemen is it's,
thank you very much John Anthony West.

3646
03:05:16,761 --> 03:05:20,600
Go seek out as work and definitely go by
magical Egypt.

3647
03:05:20,601 --> 03:05:21,830
Don't pirate it.
You fucks.

3648
03:05:21,831 --> 03:05:23,060
Go buy it.
That's awesome.

3649
03:05:23,390 --> 03:05:24,770
Exactly.
And,

3650
03:05:24,830 --> 03:05:25,663
and,
and if you have the money and the way I 

3651
03:05:27,921 --> 03:05:31,010
have the wherewithal and the will get on
an Egypt trip,

3652
03:05:31,120 --> 03:05:32,750
get on an age of trump,
this man,

3653
03:05:33,800 --> 03:05:36,590
because I'm good enough to get up and 
down the pyramid.

3654
03:05:36,591 --> 03:05:38,480
But who knows what,
how long exact,

3655
03:05:38,481 --> 03:05:39,314
so,
uh,

3656
03:05:39,550 --> 03:05:41,690
I'll ride strike while the irons hot.
