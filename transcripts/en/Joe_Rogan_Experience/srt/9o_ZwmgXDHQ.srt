1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,780
Thin nose anymore.
It behooved me.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,173
Yeah.
Have you ever looked at like a virgo 

3
00:00:07,521 --> 00:00:08,550
does ears?
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:12,150
They were big ears and the nose grow.
They keep growing.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,740
Yeah.
Age is a very annoying thing.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,880
Well,
that's a weird one.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,920
It's almost like to let someone know 
like,

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,783
Hey,
look at this guy's proportions are all 

9
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:20,070
fucked up.
He's got bad juice.

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,450
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,070
Yeah.
So how do I reduce.

12
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:25,890
I wanted to get an ear reduction and a 
nose sharpening.

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,813
I'm sure people have done that.
I could only imagine if girls are 

14
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:31,410
getting will grow.
That's a different one.

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,600
A big ass heroine is here.
Hey.

16
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,820
Hey.
He's not 12 shaved those years.

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,700
You know,
I've,

18
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,020
I've got hair growing out of my ears.
I have to.

19
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,350
I have to put a tremor in vain.
I pluck my.

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,243
Yeah,
if I see hair that doesn't belong 

21
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:50,310
somewhere I have.

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,960
I'll take it out.
Go Wax it.

23
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,420
My father like he lets his nose hair 
grow.

24
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,400
Has your eyebrows micro?
Would it kill you to.

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,710
Can you.
I'm looking into your nose and stuff.

26
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,260
It's a nest father,
bro.

27
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,783
Yeah,
sometimes I get so mad at him because 

28
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,570
the way he eats sometimes,
like we were in Mexico and he uh,

29
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,880
he was just show up,
you got to breakfast,

30
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:12,714
he has his belly and he's got like,
he's got four French toast and a waffle 

31
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,263
and a banana and I,
and I'm just sitting there and I get so 

32
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:22,680
mad.
And then I started texting him.

33
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,573
I texted him,
I said,

34
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,623
listen man,
you got to start changing the way you 

35
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:27,084
eat.
And I go and I'm angry as I'm texting 

36
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:30,210
this,
I'm getting more angry,

37
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,510
more angry.
So stop the bullshit and start eating.

38
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,250
No,
I was so angry.

39
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,230
I had to tell them that I'm getting,
my heart was beating.

40
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,210
I was furious.
I couldn't text faster.

41
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,223
I go get it together,
get it together and stop eating 

42
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,153
bullshit.
And would it kill you to fucking move a 

43
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:47,790
little bit?
Bang.

44
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,690
I just sent that.
Oh yeah.

45
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,630
Strong.
I don't want him to die.

46
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,930
Does he exercise at all?
Fuck.

47
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:56,130
No.
And I'll tell you why.

48
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,233
When he was young,
he was poor and he had to do manual 

49
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:01,170
labor.
He had to work construction.

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,920
He had to do everything with his hands,
so now that he has money,

51
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:08,250
it reminds him of one,
if you asked him to do shit,

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,113
if you ask him to help you with a table,
it reminds him of when he was poor and 

53
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:14,064
how awful it was.
I was reading a book once on power 

54
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:19,230
lifting.
One of the things that they suggested is

55
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:20,790
getting a manual labor job.

56
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,320
That's when you have to move furniture.
Okay.

57
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:28,200
When you got to carry couches upstairs.
Yeah.

58
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,720
Yeah.
That'll never saw that.

59
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,613
I never saw anybody actually recommend 
that someone do that in order to get 

60
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:36,330
stronger.
Well,

61
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,320
when you,
um,

62
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,100
my friend who we wrestled and played 
football at a high level,

63
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,010
they used to work the farm and they 
would,

64
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,253
there was a thing where you would take 
hay and you would run after the truck 

65
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,303
trucks.
I'll you take the hay and you throw it 

66
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:53,040
off and I guess you'd just doing that.
Oh yeah.

67
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,731
I mean,
you know,

68
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:57,040
you can crazy.
I worked construction one summer in,

69
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:57,874
uh,
in Washington dc in the 95 degree heat 

70
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,930
and I had to dig a foundation for a 
building for a house,

71
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,460
just dig into the ground all day and 
then we had to,

72
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,500
we had to demolish a house and take that
debris,

73
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,723
put it into a truck and then drive it to
a landfill called lot and I think and 

74
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:19,660
then we would,
and we take it off the truck.

75
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,943
So that movement of digging and then 
like the demolition and digging and 

76
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,580
piling it in a truck and then piling it 
off a truck.

77
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,610
You're too exhausted to do a goddamn 
thing.

78
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,444
You're not working out after that.
If you do work out and you get used to 

79
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:37,024
it though,
I think that's the idea is that your 

80
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,510
body becomes way more resilient.
That's what he was saying.

81
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,733
If you could get a job because a mason 
or some sort of manual labor on a 

82
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:46,060
construction site.
We carrying lumber.

83
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,123
You just lifting things up.
Karen Reynolds have your body will just 

84
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:51,580
naturally gets stronger.
The strongest I've ever felt in my life.

85
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:54,790
And Jujitsu was a Mexican guy who was 
amazing.

86
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,650
Oh yeah,
man.

87
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,920
I couldn't move.
Rick's man.

88
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,320
I couldn't believe how.
How has nothing worked on them.

89
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,690
Just imagine like picking up bricks all 
day long.

90
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,800
Scanning bricks.

91
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,600
Everything will just get stronger.
Yeah.

92
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,600
I worked with a guy named Boo Jack in 
DC.

93
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,600
Boo Jack.
What giant black guy who was a mason.

94
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,470
Does that two words or one word just 
called himself bootjack.

95
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,480
I called him Boo and he go who?
Jack?

96
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,700
That was probably as one name,
right?

97
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,800
Yup.
Last name or his first name?

98
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,260
I think it was his whole name.
Bluejack brand name.

99
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,920
It's a superhero or something.
He should be here.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,640
Just a giant.
Very,

101
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:30,430
very friendly.
Jolly black men with the biggest,

102
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:31,264
strongest hands I've ever seen.
He was a mason speaking of big jolly 

103
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,490
black men with one name.
Uh,

104
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,020
I met Sinbad the other day.
I've never met before.

105
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,930
I met him in a parking lot.
Our cars were right next to each other.

106
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,030
Fully random.
Just fully random.

107
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:46,180
What was he wearing?
Was He wearing a dangly earring?

108
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,900
A check.

109
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,070
Was He.
Was he dressed in a colorful manner or.

110
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,023
No,
he was very understated and seemed a 

111
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,033
completely normal.
Like I don't remember what he was 

112
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:56,344
wearing.
He might be wearing what you're wearing 

113
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,450
right now.
He always struck me as a nice,

114
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,740
very,
very nice guy.

115
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,170
Very nice guy.
And what's he doing now?

116
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,320
Doing standup.
Still touring?

117
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,300
Yeah.
You know,

118
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,360
still got an audience.
Oh yeah.

119
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,440
He's a funny dude,
man.

120
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,170
Apparently he was really funny on kill 
Tony.

121
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,770
They did a kill Tony episode and Sinbad 
side end is one of the um,

122
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,870
the guest judges.
Yeah.

123
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,003
You know,
they have a new guest every week and 

124
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,463
they said he was killer.
He had to do to have been doing it for 

125
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:24,430
that long.
They've got some tricks up their sleeve.

126
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,370
It's a real comic.
It's been around forever.

127
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,530
Been communicating with an audience for 
a long time,

128
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,560
but it's just nice to meet him in it and
see that he's a nice guy.

129
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,390
You know,
those guys.

130
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,420
You ever met anybody who was not so 
nice?

131
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,510
If I did the wrong way maybe five years 
ago,

132
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:42,910
I would have told you.
Yeah.

133
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,250
But now I'm like,
why?

134
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,143
Why,
why bring heat on someone from some 

135
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:49,780
weird moment that I probably could have 
done myself if I was true.

136
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,170
If you've run into someone and you're in
the wrong head space,

137
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,033
maybe you just got done,
somebody yelled at you and maybe you 

138
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,760
have a business deal that went bad.
Maybe you got cut off on the highway.

139
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,650
You never know when you're running into 
people.

140
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,790
It's just we vary so much liquid.
We would like to encourage each other to

141
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:05,624
be on a good track all the time,
but I think we need a little bit more 

142
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:11,000
forgiveness when someone does something 
stupid.

143
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,020
I'm going to call my next special,
I think bipolar ape because that is what

144
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:15,854
we are.

145
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,723
We are men and if you stop and you 
freeze frame on somebody when they're 

146
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,004
having a moment,
you can catch them in any like that 

147
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:25,874
whole spectrum,
the human spectrum center in St and 

148
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:28,484
anything in between.
You can catch them in a terrible moment 

149
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,424
or a great moment,
but you can't decide that that's what 

150
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:35,510
they are all the time and that's what 
we're doing.

151
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:36,830
Now.
Let's get to that.

152
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:39,140
We quantify certain things that are just
dumb,

153
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,580
like there's certain things you just 
never,

154
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,400
you're just not going to bounce back 
from the Rachel Dolezal thing,

155
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,320
which she pretended she was black but 
trialist and black much.

156
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,553
You know what I'm saying?
But there's like those things where it 

157
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:51,620
becomes a nationwide thing and I bet 
she's a lovely lady.

158
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,970
I Dunno,
I have no idea.

159
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,813
I have no idea.
That might be empathy gone wild or that 

160
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,290
might be sort of this,
this,

161
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,124
uh,
I think a lot of times everybody wants 

162
00:06:58,761 --> 00:06:59,420
to be an individual.

163
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,253
They want that.
That's always been a problem with the 

164
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:02,151
human condition,
right?

165
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:03,440
You want to,
you want to be,

166
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,870
you want to be unique.
We all do,

167
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,360
right?
Even though we all believe in equality,

168
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,194
we all want to be not equal.
We want to be a little better than the 

169
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,170
next guy,
or at least unique.

170
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,970
And that's maybe where competition comes
from itself.

171
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,970
But I think sometimes people negotiate 
that issue and that problem with a,

172
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,530
with a very clumsy apparatus with a 
really weird way of doing it.

173
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,480
I'm going to be trans racial or I'm 
gonna.

174
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm going to wear dishes in my ears and,
and,

175
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,430
and literally cover my whole face with 
tattoos.

176
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,260
That's fine.
Super Common.

177
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:33,861
There might.
Yeah.

178
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:36,290
That might be a better way to negotiate 
that,

179
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,470
that problem you're having because it's 
a,

180
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,733
it's still pretty surface.
You have a look at the Hashtag face 

181
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,400
tattoo on instagram.

182
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,930
No.
Holy Shit.

183
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,550
There's a lot of people get in their 
face tattooed like it's like what?

184
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:51,620
Slow down,
slow down.

185
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,440
It goes back to wanting to be seen.
Well,

186
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,620
I think what you're saying makes a lot 
of sense in terms of like people wanting

187
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:58,454
to belong to a group that seems cool and
like black people seem like overall a 

188
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:03,590
cool group,
right?

189
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,280
Like you have good music behind it.
They have a funny way of talking.

190
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,160
They have all these amazing pro 
athletes.

191
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:10,994
They have a totally different kind of 
culture and you identify with that 

192
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:15,260
culture but you can't get in because 
you're a white girl.

193
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,094
You're like,
Shit.

194
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,953
It's also something.
I think also there's a romance to when 

195
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,500
you're on the outside looking in it 
struggle.

196
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,423
Oh yeah.
And I'm being having been oppressed and 

197
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:27,080
all those things.
And yet you yet you triumph,

198
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,320
yet you find a way to be funny,
yet you find a way to be colorful,

199
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:32,840
yet you find a way to be artistic.

200
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,700
Rap came from from,
from the South Bronx.

201
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:39,590
While it was literally on fire.
Yeah.

202
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,900
And rap is just one aspect of it.
Right?

203
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:42,734
I mean think about it.
Some of the very best stand up 

204
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:46,430
Comedians,
some of the very best musicians.

205
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,570
And we think of the percentage of the 
population that's black,

206
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:56,050
12 percent the percentage that become 
elite professional athletes mean what is

207
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,500
the percentage of NBA players that are 
black?

208
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,110
It's something crazy.
A lot of it's also just.

209
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,520
What is it you think?
I don't know,

210
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:06,590
but it's pretty high.
I mean 69 personally.

211
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,490
Probably something.
I don't know why I said that number.

212
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,683
Jamie,
are you a lot of it might be just also 

213
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:12,324
that there are two.
There are two avenues open to you in a 

214
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:16,440
lot of black communities.
At least it's changing,

215
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:19,920
but you know it was sports and music for
sure.

216
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,490
That's.

217
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,830
That probably plays a part in it,
no doubt about it,

218
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,903
but it's also there's a sort of 
extraordinary number of professional 

219
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:30,620
athletes like elite athletes.
Yeah.

220
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,110
That just happened to be black.
And what is that though?

221
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,460
Is it genetic?
Is it,

222
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,310
is it the environment that are coming 
from.

223
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,144
I mean it's,
it's a fascinating thing to be explored 

224
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:44,910
because for all this talk of racism,
if you just want to be really honest,

225
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,243
there's a lot of African Americans that 
have some pretty phenomenal genetic 

226
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,400
traits like fit,
like Carl,

227
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:58,430
like think of like who's like Jamie,
who was like the biggest freak all time?

228
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,853
A athlete basketball player.
Would it be probably the Bron Jim Bron 

229
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:04,630
James Probably.
Right.

230
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,890
And then you have Michael Jordan is 
another freak athlete,

231
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,753
right?
I mean how many of those guys like that 

232
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,393
stuff?
Because people would argue like Larry 

233
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,700
Bird,
but it was a phenomenal shooter,

234
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,740
but he wasn't the kind of freak 
athletes.

235
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,310
Lebron is Dr Jay Jordan would use to 
literally fly,

236
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,203
fly through the air.
There are a couple of guys that can do 

237
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:28,050
things like that,
but they don't have the overall.

238
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,400
Yeah.
Well,

239
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:31,650
so,
so if you look at,

240
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,050
there's a book called the sports gene 
that talks about this.

241
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,800
If you look at Africa,
it's,

242
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,450
it's probably the most genetically is 
the most genetically diverse part of the

243
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:43,284
world,
right?

244
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,153
I mean,
the Africans from the bar for coast are 

245
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,950
totally different in the Africans from,
from say the highlands of Kenya,

246
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,980
Ethiopia,
the Africans from the Sudan,

247
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:56,070
the Dinka and the new attend to be 
almost seven,

248
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,270
six,
sometimes.

249
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,223
Certainly seven feet is not that 
uncommon in many people don't realize 

250
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,850
Egypt,
supportive Africa very much so.

251
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:04,740
I mean the Tunisia,
Morocco,

252
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:06,290
that's more Arabic,
right?

253
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,513
Um,
uh,

254
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,700
but then you've got,
I mean,

255
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,680
it's fascinating.
This is really,

256
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,070
it was,
and let's go to Ethiopia,

257
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,440
Ethiopia,
they grow to an average height,

258
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,210
a beautiful people.

259
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,710
There was a lot of trade and that side 
of the world,

260
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:17,950
the Eritrea,
they're dead.

261
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,480
They've been renowned for their beauty.
If you just step over the border,

262
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,280
just just go right to just one,
one south or one north.

263
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,680
You are going into Sudan and south 
Sudan,

264
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,750
tallest people in the world.
Talls people in the world.

265
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,743
And I mean,
some of them can be like a fist off at 

266
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:33,684
eight feet,
that's where like new bowl and those 

267
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:35,940
people came from,
okay,

268
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,260
if you go just another country,
just one more country east,

269
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,390
now you're in the Congo and that's home 
to the pygmy.

270
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,210
So you've got the shortest people in the
world in one country and then just cross

271
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:47,044
the border,
one of the tallest in the world in that 

272
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,880
country.
So Africa is insanely diverse.

273
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,950
But if you look at the athletes with the
most explosive power,

274
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,113
and if you like that,
that includes the fast people in the 

275
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:59,000
world who are in Jamaica and who are,
um,

276
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,130
you know,
in the United States,

277
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,620
genetically,
you can trace them back to a very primal

278
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,470
marilee.

279
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,303
You can trace them back,
very small part of Africa according to 

280
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:08,620
this book,
the sports gene,

281
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,920
which is the Africa most,
um,

282
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,680
and so that is where,
that's where you'll see the fastest,

283
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:15,880
most explosive people.
However,

284
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:19,030
having said that,
you can hear it deion sanders talking,

285
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,180
watching this white running back 215 
pounds.

286
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,140
He ran a four,
three,

287
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:25,030
5:40.
And he was like,

288
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,460
I can't say this on tv,
but he can run,

289
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:28,420
run,
run,

290
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,313
run,
run.

291
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,460
And it was true.
It was like,

292
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,320
you haven't seen a white guy run a four,
three,

293
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:34,600
five in forever.
It's pretty rare.

294
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,090
There's gotta be some Viking genes 
floating room.

295
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,013
Sure.
But there,

296
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,863
there is no,
I don't think there's any black 

297
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,350
quarterbacks in the NFL,
quarterbacks cornerbacks.

298
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,273
It's just fascinating when you stop and 
think about just the sheer number of 

299
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,540
people involved in professional 
athletics,

300
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,040
the sheer number of people that make a 
living playing a game with their body.

301
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,053
Yeah.
But I don't know if that kind of 

302
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,390
athleticism helps you become a champion 
in tennis.

303
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,380
You know,
there are different.

304
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,120
Depends on the sport and sports 
specific.

305
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:04,481
Right?
Well,

306
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:05,314
I mean first of all,
black people historically have not been 

307
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:09,460
into tennis because they didn't have 
money.

308
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:10,294
It's Arthur Ashe was obviously Athena,
but Arthur Ashe was like way before 

309
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:16,001
they're telling.
Right.

310
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:19,420
So he was like the groundbreaker.
But how many mean now?

311
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,030
I'm sure a lot of kids growing up in 
Nice communities,

312
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:23,710
they have tennis clubs and stuff like 
that.

313
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,390
African American kids.
But it's less a thing of that culture.

314
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,920
The thing like there's not a lot of 
Italian American tennis players either.

315
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:35,620
You know what I'm saying?
Like my people don't play tennis,

316
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,860
they don't get into tennis.
It's not an economic thing.

317
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,610
It's just a cultural of the same way.
Yeah.

318
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,330
So when you see all these like world 
class tennis players,

319
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:45,700
it just happened to be of the,
you know,

320
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,830
rich upper crease coach.

321
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,510
You need a lot of stuff with tennis.
You know,

322
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,583
it's a lot going on at tennis plus 
nobody gives a shit until you're really 

323
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:54,580
good.
You know,

324
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:56,820
like if you're kind of like,
if you have a chance,

325
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,270
holy plays a Semipro ball for,
oh maybe we'll get into the big leagues,

326
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,260
you know?
But if you don't,

327
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,290
if you like obviously my pro tennis 
player get a fucking job,

328
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,790
bitch,
what are you doing?

329
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,520
You playing tennis?
It takes a long time.

330
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,820
I used to know this dude who was a 
professional racquetball player and that

331
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:16,780
was the grind nerdiest of all grinds 
because when I was 19 I recognize like,

332
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,643
oh no,
this dude done painted himself into a 

333
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:21,550
corner.
He's like a world champion.

334
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:23,940
It's something nobody gives a fuck.
Nobody cares dude.

335
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,500
Nobody cared.
And people would treat him like,

336
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,460
Oh,
poor guy.

337
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,630
Like that was part of it.

338
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,463
It was like he's awesome but poor guy.
Well I feel like way when I watched the 

339
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:35,860
biathlon picks and shit or curling or.
Yeah,

340
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:36,694
the sports will curling is,
don't talk shit about curling in 

341
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:40,720
Newfoundland.
If you go up there and Canada,

342
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:42,820
they get fucking angry at you.
I don't give a fuck.

343
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,893
They get mad.
So I don't care that you replayed the 

344
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:49,930
curling move in slow motion.
I didn't miss it in regular motion.

345
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,970
You know,
there's just certain sports.

346
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:54,920
I don't think their skills are not 
sports.

347
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,550
Like what?
Uh,

348
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,383
how to races,
how to racist deal with the fact that 

349
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,850
there's so many elite black athletes.
What is it?

350
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,040
Because you just look at it and how do 
you see white superiority in that many.

351
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,360
I've heard,
I've heard guys in New York,

352
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:15,950
white guys would always say this about,
about I'd hear white dudes in there talk

353
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:18,080
about black and white athletes like 
this.

354
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,080
They'd be like,
well he's brother.

355
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,890
So obviously he's going to be faster and
stronger,

356
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:22,724
but this kid over here has got heart and
he's got smarts and then so like guys 

357
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:30,500
who apparently got heart brain,
whereas the black guy only has muscle.

358
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:32,150
It was a clear indication that you're 
just,

359
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,000
it was such a racist kind of way of 
delineating,

360
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:35,834
you know,
what's also delusional because people 

361
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:40,250
want to assume that because someone has 
physical attributes,

362
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:42,620
they don't have mental attributes,
they always want to say that.

363
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,633
And sometimes it's true because 
sometimes when you have physical 

364
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:48,860
attributes,
life is easier for you and you get soft.

365
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,053
You don't have to work as hard.
Like one of the more impressive guys in 

366
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:53,924
the UFC for me has always been Frankie 
Edgar because that guy's just a product 

367
00:15:57,381 --> 00:16:00,410
of hard work.
He's never been a knockout puncher.

368
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,060
He's not the biggest guys always in 
small for whatever division.

369
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,730
He's in a small 55 and he's pretty small
at 45 in comparison to some guys like,

370
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
you know,
like Ortega,

371
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,280
we fought this weekend,
right?

372
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,050
Brian's much bigger than.
I'm taller,

373
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:12,884
longer.
He's just all heart and will and 

374
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:16,094
toughness.
And,

375
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,163
and I love that,
and I think that's an admirable thing 

376
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:21,860
and I think you can get out a lot at a 
Washington guy like that,

377
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,963
but it doesn't mean that a guy can't 
have that mindset and also have some 

378
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,800
fucking ray Lewis body.
Well man,

379
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,080
it's my turn was the example of that.
Nobody and coby Brian was saying,

380
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,060
nobody works harder and that's why they 
and they,

381
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,260
they love to win in the almost psychotic
way.

382
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,450
Extreme winters are that way.
Yeah.

383
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,553
That whole thing,
that extreme winters is why we're here 

384
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:46,160
folks.
It's why it's so compelling.

385
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,071
I mean,
you,

386
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:47,904
you had to have some godly resolve to 
get through the Mongol era and the 

387
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:53,414
fucking caveman era and think about all 
the different shit that's happened in 

388
00:16:57,261 --> 00:16:57,710
between it.

389
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,290
Just think about the people that 
colonized this country.

390
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,343
We were so far removed from people who 
lived here and rode wagons across the 

391
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,760
country just 200 years ago.
Nothing that just happened.

392
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,040
They did this study.
Uh,

393
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,913
Camille Paglia was talking about this.
Why were most of the people that 

394
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:18,610
revolutionized the human condition,
male,

395
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,240
like.
So in other words,

396
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,133
the printing press and Einstein and 
copernicus and Galileo and Kepler and 

397
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,110
all these people that Kinda like you 
know,

398
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,520
and,
and why,

399
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:31,330
why so few women and so a lot of 
academic circles will.

400
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,253
The only single variable answer is that 
women were kept down by the Patriarchy 

401
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:38,780
or whatever.
It might be very condescending though if

402
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:39,614
you think about it,
because that would suggest that women 

403
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:41,960
didn't find their way through the 
cracks.

404
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:42,794
Some of them did,
but for the most part and then there's 

405
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,050
some truth to that.

406
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:45,883
But for the most part,
there's another really interesting 

407
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:49,680
theory that men have.
Men and women tend to have two different

408
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,570
kinds of brains.
We've evolved that do different.

409
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,404
Brian's because women have to watch out 
for children and pay attention to the 

410
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:56,964
minutia and keep them away from death.
Whereas men have the kind of brand that 

411
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:01,004
can obsess over just one thing,
even if it doesn't really bare any 

412
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:04,434
relation to the material world.
So they can think about whether time 

413
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:10,510
bends or whether they the the 
relationship between time and matter and

414
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,940
space,
you know,

415
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,223
and they'll just delta zero in on that 
problem and obsessed over that problem 

416
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:20,820
and you have those extreme winners that 
literally to the exclusion of everything

417
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:22,050
else,
including their family,

418
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:23,230
including,
you know,

419
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,120
other people focused on just one thing.
But in a lot of ways,

420
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,910
thank God we had that aberration because
that is what revolutionizes,

421
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,783
that is what changes a lot about how we 
live a little explosions that make this 

422
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,110
thing move quicker there.

423
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,080
The combustion inside the engine that is
human civilization.

424
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:42,690
Every now and then you get someone that 
just is an outlier.

425
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:43,524
So Elon musk characters drilling holes 
under the Los Angeles and building 

426
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:48,600
fucking power stations from,
for solar power.

427
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:50,130
For People's houses.
Yeah.

428
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,340
Make it fucking cars.
She's never going to work.

429
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,570
It's never going to work.
It's never going to work.

430
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:55,650
He's like,
shut up.

431
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,440
He's just so much smarter.
We let them drill under the city.

432
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:00,090
Will it go ahead.
You know what you're doing.

433
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,343
Everybody just lets him do it.
You imagine if like a regular person 

434
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,910
wanted to drill underneath the cities 
and make tubes and put,

435
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,660
they'll be like,
that's the dumbest idea ever.

436
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,613
And it dropped down.
A car is going to go on a train and the 

437
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:14,820
train is going to go really fast with 
the car underground.

438
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,710
Shut the fuck up.
Should have this guy,

439
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,300
Andrew Keenan,
your podcast.

440
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,133
I interviewed him.
He wrote a book called how to fix the 

441
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,024
future and uh,
also a book called the Internet's not 

442
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:24,560
the answer.
And,

443
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,870
and another book called the call to the 
amateur and kind of like in the culture,

444
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,120
the Amatory Lichens,
uh,

445
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,770
you know,
the infinite monkey metaphor.

446
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,910
You ever heard that?
Yes.

447
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,481
Yeah,
it's great.

448
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:34,314
So if you had an infinite number of 
monkeys just banging away at a 

449
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,810
typewriter,
eventually one of them would,

450
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,190
would type out a masterpiece,
like a shakespearian play or something.

451
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,780
Just randomly,
just randomly.

452
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:43,561
Yeah.
And as you know,

453
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:46,440
if that was real and it would end 
mathematically,

454
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:48,360
you can prove it.
I get it mathematically,

455
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,130
but I still call bullshit,
right?

456
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,500
Like,
it doesn't make any sense.

457
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,573
Like what are the odds that just 
randomly this monkey on just accident 

458
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,423
put the periods in the right place and 
the spaces in the right place and the 

459
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,180
commas in the right place?

460
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,550
No,
no.

461
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,320
It's impossible.
It is part of the last chance.

462
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,740
Last chance can suck a fat dick.
I don't buy it.

463
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,723
I don't buy it.
I've heard it before by people far 

464
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:15,330
smarter than me and I'm like,
no,

465
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,283
no.
There's zero chance raises an amazing 

466
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:19,734
question,
right?

467
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,490
What's.
What's amazing is it's like human beings

468
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,420
can actually reach beyond that,
which they can measure human beings.

469
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,760
So it's not just what you can see and 
measure.

470
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,600
It's actually what you can imagine and 
what you can imagine actually is real.

471
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,780
It's a part of reality and all that 
shit.

472
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,240
Yeah,
but he said that these infinite monkeys,

473
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,140
that's basically what youtube and what 
the Internet has ushered in.

474
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,940
Right.
But long story short,

475
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,980
when you're talking about Elon Musk,
he was talking about how in his book

476
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,843
had a fixed future.
The nine tech billionaires of the nine 

477
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:52,564
tech billionaires,
they own more wealth than one point 8 

478
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:57,963
billion people on this planet.
We've actually never seen this kind of 

479
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,260
concentration of wealth.
Good.

480
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,400
Luckily guys like Jeff Bezos who he 
knows really well and uh,

481
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,563
you know,
these other guys like Mark Zuckerberg 

482
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,460
are kind of aware.
They have some historical perspective of

483
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:13,294
where they stand and for the most part 
they're doing their best to try to 

484
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,390
figure out a way to be responsible with 
this wealth.

485
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,360
There's also the fact that they're 
coming from a tech background,

486
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:26,380
which has historically been really 
fucking smart people.

487
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,940
Right.
Those are the innovators.

488
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,310
So because of that,
they're more left leaning.

489
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,820
Yeah.
Which is probably for what,

490
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,310
it's just the whole tech community is 
more left leaning.

491
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:38,830
Yeah,
I mean that's why any,

492
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,160
anything that deviates from that,
it's kind of punished.

493
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,503
Well,
the problem though is that now you have 

494
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,050
the four riders of the apocalypse,
Google,

495
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:48,730
facebook,
Amazon,

496
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,490
and apple.
There's so much that,

497
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,430
I mean,
the amount of co they have,

498
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,400
they had access to all your data and to 
the maps.

499
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,130
So it does kind of go.
You kind of go,

500
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,390
okay,
your left leaning,

501
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:03,790
but there has never been this kind of 
concentration of power.

502
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:04,923
Well yeah,
but they're not doing anything with the 

503
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:06,964
power that we know of.
What would they do have is tremendous 

504
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:12,760
wealth like off the charts,
tremendous wealth at apple,

505
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,743
at Google.
I mean they just have tremendous amount 

506
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:19,480
of influence and I think when you have 
that kind of money,

507
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,373
like idealistic,
hippie leftwing dreamers are way better 

508
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,674
off like throwing that money around then
like really gangster globalists that 

509
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:29,740
are,
you know,

510
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,573
pro war,
really enthusiastic about right wing 

511
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:35,530
politics like that will be way scarier 
if all that money,

512
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:36,364
the billions of dollars was in a 
Cristiana cult that thought that the 

513
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,600
second coming was going to happen in 
Jerusalem.

514
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,400
So it was very important to protect 
Israel,

515
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,323
which is real.
There's a lot of people in this country 

516
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:46,444
that want to protect Israel because they
think that's where Jesus is pit stop 

517
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:50,300
when it comes back.
Yeah,

518
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,910
you can.
I do worry about.

519
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:52,803
Yeah,
you should worry about very religious 

520
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:55,270
people.
So with,

521
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,120
with a messianic.
Yeah.

522
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,810
And that's,
that's a real thing today.

523
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:03,811
So I think like secular tended reason 
based techno freaks who I might disagree

524
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:05,194
with them on some of the most ridiculous
asks a ridiculous aspects of 

525
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,053
progressivism.
Like they just go so far off the charts 

526
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:13,444
and it's so common now.
Everyone is getting so hysterical about 

527
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:18,040
things.
You know Christina Hoff sommers is.

528
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,210
I love her.
She's great.

529
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:20,044
She's got love her.
She's got literally shouted down 

530
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,110
offstage.
They interrupted her speech,

531
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,410
they put up signs.
They wouldn't let her talk through.

532
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,210
We're calling her a fascist where they 
sound really confident in their point of

533
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:28,730
view.
Huh?

534
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:29,563
It's just so pleased.
But they don't engage somebody in ideas 

535
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,300
a shout them down because you're 
terrified.

536
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,163
Well,
what they're doing also is they're 

537
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:36,514
getting on Youtube.
So there's all these videos of them 

538
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,830
being woke.
Hashtag woke expressing their wokeness.

539
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,990
I haven't heard that expression.
I know you have.

540
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,080
Yeah.
You're just talking about it.

541
00:23:45,081 --> 00:23:46,070
Yeah,
it's a gross

542
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,903
word.
I think it comes down to what I was 

543
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,033
amazed.
What I'm amazed at is I've talked to 

544
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:53,210
some of these far left ideologues,
you know,

545
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,673
and uh,
and especially the people that would 

546
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:57,730
shout down,
Christine Summers,

547
00:23:57,731 --> 00:23:58,564
who is such a reason voice in such an 
important voice to smart and let her 

548
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:06,130
talk and then if you disagree with her,
have a conversation with you.

549
00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:06,964
Are they typically do a q and a at the 
end of these speeches that's just rude 

550
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,600
to her with your ideas.
And she's a feminist for fucking podcast

551
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:17,090
is called progress.
Actual feminist.

552
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,223
That's what her,
her thing is her video series that she 

553
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:22,370
does now.
She's an important person,

554
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,100
man.
She's not an anti woman in any way,

555
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,900
shape or form.
She's not the female.

556
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,190
I've listened to her and she,
she wrote that book,

557
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:32,690
the war on boys.
She's,

558
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,670
she's excellent.
She's excellent.

559
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,503
But I think a lot of this is like,
one of the things I noticed is that a 

560
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:41,990
lot of the left wing idiot logs at that 
first of all are fairly young.

561
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,853
A lot of times they don't have a whole 
lot of experience in the world or you 

562
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:49,160
know,
they are people who are like,

563
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:49,994
if you just take the average journalist,
and I've met a lot of them now and talk 

564
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:53,780
to a lot of them,
the average journalist,

565
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:54,614
even the average academic in colleges or
in the people that are kind of 

566
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,620
controlling this conversation in certain
aspects,

567
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,323
they have just not really ever met 
anybody or worked with anybody that 

568
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,183
worked with their hands that he spends a
lot of time that had to be in the 

569
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:15,900
military that,
um,

570
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,080
they,
they tend to be pretty cloistered,

571
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,020
you know,
I mean,

572
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,853
uh,
even even Sam Harris by his own 

573
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:23,660
admission said that in his Rolodex of 
1100 people,

574
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:25,610
he only had one friend who smoked.

575
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,640
And that was Christopher hitchens.
That significant.

576
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:33,790
It's significant when you are exposed to
one element of society.

577
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,003
And one of the advantages that I think a
comic has when you travel so much is 

578
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:41,450
that you're around real people.
People that work with their hands,

579
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,700
people to do other things that are in 
the military,

580
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:45,260
people that are cops,
people that are,

581
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,120
that are essentially a huge part of the 
fabric of this side who are on the right

582
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,013
on uncertainty on the left.
And what you start to realize is that 

583
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,430
your,
um,

584
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,820
the world is way more complicated as is 
always the way it is,

585
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:00,350
right?
It's just way more complicated.

586
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,220
People are way less,
uh,

587
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,370
uh,
easy to pigeonhole there.

588
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,233
Just because you supported trump doesn't
necessarily mean you are right winner 

589
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,890
across the board.
It doesn't mean you're,

590
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,990
you know,
about the patriarchy and stuff.

591
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,033
And I find that a lot of young people 
and I find a lot of people who are 

592
00:26:15,711 --> 00:26:18,650
trying to be woke and stuff.
And we do this as Americans.

593
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,360
It's not just the left,
it's also the right.

594
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:23,270
We do this as Americans.
We want to find a bad guy and we want to

595
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:25,880
put a label on that bad guy.
We want a single variable answer.

596
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,040
We want a single variable solution,
right?

597
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,820
So in other words,
you are racist,

598
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,330
you are a sexist,
you are a homophobe,

599
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,390
so you've got to be sanctioned and we 
got to get rid of you.

600
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:42,260
And if we can get rid of racism as if 
racism has a and do with it.

601
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:43,094
Actually it's about tribalism because 
people don't need a difference in skin 

602
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:46,164
color to hate each other.
Have you heard of the Middle East or 

603
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:51,000
Africa or even this country?
It's not about the melanin in your skin,

604
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,980
it's just we're tribal,
but,

605
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,000
but we tend to want to find that one 
label.

606
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,650
You're a racist.
You're a homophobe bibles.

607
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,460
Most certainly racist.
Yeah,

608
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:03,460
of course there are.
You beat.

609
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,460
Don't think racism is the problem that 
we're facing.

610
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:06,294
I think it's more of a tribalism.
I think that if everybody was the same 

611
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:09,990
color,
we'd have no problem,

612
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,730
uh,
joining groups and hitting each other.

613
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,200
No problem.
Again.

614
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,610
Well,
that's where you see the Middle East,

615
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:16,420
that's for sure.
Look,

616
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,860
Yuval Harari,
racism is just a symptom of that.

617
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,143
You Bet.
Harare's a great book sapiens and 

618
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,590
everybody should read it.
Read it on your recommendation.

619
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,830
If the Dinka,
the Dinka and the Nuer and the Sudan,

620
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:30,780
let's just take them.
They look exactly the same.

621
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,010
Just Google it.
They have an exact,

622
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:33,130
just racist,
right?

623
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,360
They like saying all black people have 
exactly the same.

624
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,830
Well,
they look,

625
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,461
they do.
Look,

626
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:38,831
they,
they,

627
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:40,440
they are basically,
they are,

628
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,160
they are they the only way to tell them 
the difference is the tribal markings.

629
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,980
But for the most part they're,
they look exactly the same.

630
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:48,900
Very similar cultures or hurting 
culture.

631
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,930
A Dinka and the Dinka language means 
people knew in the new,

632
00:27:53,931 --> 00:27:56,340
uh,
language means original people.

633
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,530
Whoa.
And they're sworn enemies.

634
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,830
They fucking hate each other.
Talk to justin ran about.

635
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:02,664
Yeah,
Ta Talk to Justin Wren about how the 

636
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,000
pygmies are treated in the country right
next door.

637
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,103
They're brutally discriminated.
They can't even go to hospitals or 

638
00:28:12,361 --> 00:28:15,150
schools because they're short and 
they're magic apparently.

639
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,670
So go fuck yourself.
It ain't about color.

640
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,520
We don't need color to hate each other.
We just don't.

641
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,443
We would find something.
It would be neighborhoods or lines in 

642
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:26,490
the dirt or sports teams.
Fuck yes.

643
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,593
We,
we mean we hate each other from 

644
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,960
neighboring high schools in the same 
town.

645
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,420
We compete with each other.
Maybe it's a good,

646
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,850
good natured competition.
There's nothing wrong with that either.

647
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,163
There's a natural need that we have to 
compete against each other and conquer 

648
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:41,514
each other,
and that's because we used to do that 

649
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,870
exclusively,
right?

650
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,803
That's how people move.
That's what this Viking show is all 

651
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,430
about.
People coming into peoples' villages,

652
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,190
fucking them up and taken all their gold
and just,

653
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:55,230
that's what people did forever.
Fuck yes,

654
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,340
and,
but here's the other thing.

655
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,460
It's really taboo.
This is so fucking taboo.

656
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,820
Even say this.
Now what are you going to risk something

657
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,323
so.
So the narrative is those people aren't 

658
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:08,274
doing well.
Let's just take any group of people 

659
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,190
they're not doing well,
right?

660
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,250
Because they've been.
There's only one answer to that.

661
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,310
They've been put down.
They been oppressed,

662
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:18,750
they've been suppressed.
Yes.

663
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:20,410
Sometimes that's true,
right?

664
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:21,743
Nobody can tell me you don't understand 
the history of this country unless you 

665
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:27,270
studied the black experience at least a 
little bit because that is.

666
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:31,590
That is such a huge part of the history 
of this country and to be a black person

667
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:33,600
in this country is not something I have 
no idea about,

668
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,750
but it hasn't been easy.
Granted,

669
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,950
let's just take any ethnic group.
If you were to ever like Thomas Soul,

670
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,813
who's a black scholar,
if you were ever to bring up the idea 

671
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:50,941
that maybe part of the problem in 
certain groups,

672
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,920
okay,
that aren't doing well,

673
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,880
could be internal,
could be of their own making,

674
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,600
could be that there are certain aspects 
of that person's culture,

675
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,630
whether they're in Hewitt,
whether they're Mexican,

676
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:07,180
whether they're black or whether they're
a hillbilly white guy.

677
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,960
If you start talking about the fact that
their culture and the way they.

678
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,460
Their belief,
their,

679
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,340
their,
their,

680
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,480
their practices could have something to 
do with why they're not getting ahead.

681
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,853
You better be damn careful because now 
you're blaming the victim because it is 

682
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:24,320
true that,

683
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,153
well,
you're not really necessarily blaming 

684
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:27,411
the victim,
right?

685
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:28,244
Because the victim in this case is a 
person who's a part of a culture and 

686
00:30:31,101 --> 00:30:31,934
we're all influenced by our environment 
and if you were involved in a culture 

687
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:35,864
that has very specific ways of behaving 
and you're supposed to engage in these 

688
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:43,220
and whether it's a know female genital 
mutilation that they do to children on a

689
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,320
regular basis in some parts of the 
world,

690
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:46,370
like why did they do that?
Well,

691
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:48,500
they've just been doing that.
That's what they've been doing that.

692
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:49,334
So they just keep doing that.
Like there's a lot of weird things that 

693
00:30:51,111 --> 00:30:53,900
people just get sucked into and then you
don't even realize what you're doing.

694
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,610
You're 18.
You live in that life.

695
00:30:55,611 --> 00:30:56,444
Then it becomes a part of your pattern 
or behavior and then when you're 35 and 

696
00:30:59,451 --> 00:31:00,284
everyone around you is behaving the same
way in the world filled with violence 

697
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,870
and no one can hit the pause button and 
go,

698
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:08,360
hey,
why we getting each other,

699
00:31:08,361 --> 00:31:10,610
Hutus and Tutsis like,
what are we doing?

700
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,380
No one's like,
stop,

701
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,663
settle the fuck down.
It's like you get locked up in the 

702
00:31:16,101 --> 00:31:19,550
momentum of your past,
of the past,

703
00:31:19,551 --> 00:31:21,650
of your family,
your ancestors,

704
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:22,940
your community,
your environment.

705
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:23,983
Very few people have complete autonomy,
so the idea that we're supposed to ask 

706
00:31:26,271 --> 00:31:28,930
somebody to just figure it out or get 
their shit together,

707
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,610
pull themselves up by their bootstraps.
It's pretty preposterous.

708
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,680
Fuck yeah,
and it's usually coming from people that

709
00:31:33,681 --> 00:31:34,514
got a nice juicy hand like life gave you
a couple of aces and you got to seven 

710
00:31:38,451 --> 00:31:41,660
over there and a two and you try to 
figure out if you can get a flush,

711
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,450
like you've got a good hand.
You got lucky.

712
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,640
So if you say you made it with a good 
hand,

713
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:47,474
like,
oh,

714
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,010
congratulations.
You won the pot.

715
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,110
You got dealt three aces.
You kinda.

716
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,220
Exactly.
You got lucky.

717
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,113
Exactly.
I'll be the first to admit that should 

718
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,243
be the first.
I mean that some people are born with 

719
00:31:58,611 --> 00:32:00,710
more advantaged than others.
Just a better family.

720
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,573
Just stop for a moment and I don't want 
to get to this are already to Social 

721
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,413
Justice Warrior II in this podcast,
but this is one of the things that 

722
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:08,834
pisses me off and said,
I agree with so many of those twats on 

723
00:32:12,171 --> 00:32:13,004
so many important issues and then they 
get so crazy that they wanted to 

724
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:18,620
interrupt people at Christina Hoff 
summers and yell at.

725
00:32:18,621 --> 00:32:19,730
She's a fascist and

726
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,240
we just,
we just,

727
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,280
we.
There's just too much conflict.

728
00:32:25,281 --> 00:32:26,114
That doesn't make any sense today.
They're not reasonable that they're not 

729
00:32:29,211 --> 00:32:31,850
civil or reasonable,
so I don't know where else to go.

730
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,313
Like what if you're not going to be 
reasonable and you're going to decide 

731
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:39,980
that you're that right,
that you

732
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,813
are,
that your site is rooted in truth and 

733
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,740
love and that and my sides rooted in 
falsehood.

734
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,623
Knievel,
salt,

735
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,720
aggressive issues are all.
It's no,

736
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:50,630
no one has ever like super into women's 
rights but racist,

737
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:51,983
like they're all like there's a pattern 
of behavior that you're supposed to 

738
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:57,530
follow them.
It's like really?

739
00:32:57,531 --> 00:32:58,364
It's a really interesting predetermined 
pattern that everybody locks into 

740
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:03,110
because it's support gay marriage.
It's like all these things.

741
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:03,940
Well,
you can yell.

742
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,820
It's like,
it's like if you're,

743
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:05,654
if you're in favor,
if you believe that global warming is 

744
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:10,970
caused by human beings,
you've got to be in the right.

745
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,150
You know you,
unless you're.

746
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,660
Unless you know where you stand on gay 
marriage,

747
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:15,763
on everything else like that,
that's unfortunately you can't be sort 

748
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:19,610
of responsive to evidence.
Right?

749
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,623
So instead of being affiliated with a 
party or a candidate be affiliated with 

750
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:26,120
the problem,
what's the problem?

751
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,740
Will agree with all three shooters,
right?

752
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,850
That socks.
Yes.

753
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,510
So there's gotta be a way,
if we could put our ideas together,

754
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,680
create a little idea.
Sex.

755
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:35,570
There's gotta be a way,
right?

756
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:37,880
There's gotta be a way to deal with this
problem.

757
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,541
Oh,
well,

758
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:41,390
can we talk about the fact that we all 
agree that the problem socks.

759
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,433
Now you're saying we need more guns and 
this other side saying we need less 

760
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:47,840
guns.
Is there,

761
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,660
is there something,
is there something we can.

762
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,690
Can we at least start talking instead?
Because you know,

763
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,570
Brendan on the podcast said,
can we agree that a gum problem,

764
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,500
the fucking number of hate emails we got
to know,

765
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,320
want to give up those guns and,
and,

766
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:02,991
and uh,
yeah.

767
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:03,824
And,
and Jim Jefferies was so funny because 

768
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:07,000
he goes and his pod.
Did you hear that?

769
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:08,010
That,
that stand up in it.

770
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,170
He goes,
here's the argument,

771
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,350
because I like them so fuck off.
And it's like,

772
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,700
that's good enough.
Yeah.

773
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,043
The constitution says that guns,
we have a right to bear arms so we can 

774
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:18,980
protect ourselves against tyrannical 
government.

775
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:19,821
Right?
I mean that's,

776
00:34:19,821 --> 00:34:22,040
that's what the second amendment.
Well,

777
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,150
you know,
he's like,

778
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:24,740
the government has drones,
right?

779
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,560
They got tanks,
they've got cruise missiles.

780
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,280
Your ar 15 ain't doing shit.
Another problem.

781
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,810
This is,
people need to understand this.

782
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,790
The government is us.
Okay.

783
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,280
Everybody that you just described,
someone who works in the military,

784
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,170
everyone just described someone who's a 
soldier,

785
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,840
two soldiers or civilians,
they're the same people.

786
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,040
They're people,
they're us.

787
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,780
We're not talking about some global 
elites.

788
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:46,880
It's going to take over.
They're not taking over with us.

789
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,820
We are not going to take over ourselves.
We're not.

790
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,890
This is not a stupid fucking country.

791
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,890
Like the idea that somehow or another 
the military will start taking them.

792
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:55,724
Well,
we have to be careful is people that 

793
00:34:56,991 --> 00:34:59,090
have extreme power and shit.
Judgment.

794
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,073
Like that cop that shot that kid in the 
hallway in Arizona that that horrible 

795
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,230
video was bad white guy shooting a white
guy too.

796
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:07,064
By the way.
I don't even know if that has anything 

797
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:10,640
to do with racism with a lot of what 
cops are doing.

798
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:11,474
I think some of it most certainly does,
but I think a lot of it has to do with 

799
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:14,864
people to just incompetent and they're 
police officers and they shouldn't be 

800
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:18,524
police officers and on top of that,
I think the stress of the job just 

801
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:22,784
breaks people's brains and I think 
sometimes people are just so out of 

802
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:26,174
their fucking mind with worrying about 
being shot and dealing with trauma and 

803
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:34,181
dealing with violence and dealing with 
domestic abuse and fucking murdered kids

804
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:35,600
and all the fucked up things.

805
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,130
They say.
See everyday they're brains are frazzled

806
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:38,964
man and they're stepping out into the 
street and then they can confront 

807
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:44,100
somebody and they just want to fucking 
shoot.

808
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,800
I just want to shoot before they get 
shot there on a hair trigger,

809
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:47,634
man,
that's a couple of seconds to write 

810
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,650
sometimes and sometimes it doesn't.
Sometimes they plant a gun on the guy.

811
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,380
I mean sometimes it's absolutely a dirty
cop.

812
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,071
Right?
You know,

813
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,870
sometimes the guy's reaching for his 
wallet,

814
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,820
they shoot him in the car with his baby 
in the backseat.

815
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,440
This has been a bunch of these things,
man,

816
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,530
and I think it boils down to more than 
anything,

817
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,100
people that are fucking completely 
incompetent at being a police officer.

818
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,143
What's amazing is the number of 
interactions where you never hear shit 

819
00:36:12,481 --> 00:36:13,314
about.
What's amazing is how many people get 

820
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,660
pulled over every day.
How many people deal with a cop,

821
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,610
how many people get questioned by a cop?

822
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,533
How many people are in a situation where
a cop has to talk to them about 

823
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:28,020
something that happened and nothing 
happens and nobody gets shot.

824
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,220
It's overwhelming.
The numbers of actual interactions where

825
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:33,054
everything goes okay,
far outweigh the dirty cop that shoots 

826
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:38,550
the kid in the hallway.
Of course,

827
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,291
the and the,
the,

828
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:42,150
the cop that plants the Taser and the 
guy after he shoots them.

829
00:36:42,151 --> 00:36:43,920
All these different things where there's
a dirty guy,

830
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,983
there's just people.
The number of honorable police officers 

831
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,660
is actually pretty fucking stunningly 
positive.

832
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,503
So if cops that save lives or stop 
crying from happiness and all those 

833
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:59,580
things protect people.
Human beings have this crazy brain right

834
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:00,414
where this negativity bias where 
something like violence and stuff has 

835
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:07,500
such an effect on our brain.
We're really good at seeing problems but

836
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:08,334
really bad at,
at coming up with the solutions like we 

837
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,760
tend to jump to.

838
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,170
So if you,
if there's a problem,

839
00:37:13,171 --> 00:37:15,390
if it's a very.
It's a very thing about terrorism,

840
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:16,920
right?
If people die on,

841
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:20,100
it's a very scary situation.
Far More people die of diabetes.

842
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,383
Far More people die of heart disease.
People die if the way you're eating far 

843
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:28,680
more die from all the various 
pharmaceutical opiates.

844
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,130
That's exactly right.
I mean,

845
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,960
I can't tell how many people die of of 
aspirin,

846
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,430
some crazy number think it's $10,000
crazy,

847
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,733
but things are not as sexy,
but we tend to react to the things that 

848
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:41,611
really scare us.
Right?

849
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:42,444
Yeah.
We'll violence violence is what gets us 

850
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:45,760
not disease.
Like,

851
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,613
dude,
I know two people who have lost loved 

852
00:37:48,721 --> 00:37:51,390
ones to the flu this year.
Yeah.

853
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,810
Yup.
One of them was a 14 year old girl.

854
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,010
Oh my God.
Yeah.

855
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,960
The flu killed Jesus do this.
Flu is no fucking shot for two weeks.

856
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,751
Dude,
it's.

857
00:38:01,751 --> 00:38:03,060
You get a joke.
I got.

858
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:07,200
I was going down for a couple of days 
because I caught it really early on.

859
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,420
I knew it was happening and I did 
nothing.

860
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:12,720
I stayed home and I ate real good and I 
just slept all day.

861
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:16,230
I let my body I worked out.
You can't ask those.

862
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,180
The working out ones are the worst.
Killed me.

863
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,073
I've had that happen before was thinking
I was a little bit sick and then I 

864
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:23,580
worked out and it just gripped me.
Got Me.

865
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,910
I'd never been sick like that.
Hadn't six since college.

866
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:28,950
I was real proud of myself that I 
recognized it.

867
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,270
I was like,
something's going on here.

868
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:32,610
Like I,
I'm pretty in tune with what I'm feeling

869
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:33,620
like a pussy.
Well,

870
00:38:33,621 --> 00:38:36,190
I'm just lazy and when like my body just
feels off

871
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,480
and I'm like,
my body feels off.

872
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,470
And then I was like,
oh my God,

873
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:41,980
I know sweating and I'd be sitting there
with Chili and then I'd be sweating.

874
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:42,820
And I was like,
okay,

875
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm just going to get under the covers 
and Netflix the fuck out of these couple

876
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:50,980
of days because I did that two days ago 
where everybody in my family was sick.

877
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:51,910
They,
everybody's getting cold.

878
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:54,510
Everybody around was getting cold and I,
I,

879
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,340
it was eight hours.
I'd been sleeping eight hours.

880
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,640
I couldn't get out of bed and I was 
like,

881
00:38:57,641 --> 00:38:59,170
I'm tired.
I slept.

882
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,020
Yeah,
fucking slept for 11 hours.

883
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,060
Felt tip top.
My body fought it.

884
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:04,894
I was like,
I'm not moving until it's the mood has 

885
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,740
to get asked to move and you got to have
a healthy body.

886
00:39:08,741 --> 00:39:09,574
Folks.
This is the one thing that I got from 

887
00:39:11,111 --> 00:39:12,400
this year and it was only,
like I said,

888
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:14,290
it was really only fucked up for like 
two days,

889
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,740
but one thing that God is how wonderful 
it is to be healthy.

890
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,753
Yeah.
I mean we take this fucking thing for 

891
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:21,814
granted.
This vitality you take just feeling 

892
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:25,570
good.
Like right now,

893
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,670
right now.
Right now I feel great.

894
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,960
I feel great.
Yeah,

895
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:30,840
me too.
Ate Breakfast at,

896
00:39:30,841 --> 00:39:32,320
worked out.
I'm healthy.

897
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,120
Hanging out with my friend.
Yeah.

898
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:34,954
There are podcasts.
There are two things they talk about 

899
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:40,230
like when you do a to a country.
Number one is this,

900
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,123
this fucking behavioral scientist named.
He wrote a book called scarcity and his 

901
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:45,484
name is uh,
lr chef here and I did a podcast with 

902
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:51,400
him and he'd studies like how humans 
behave when they have.

903
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,140
They don't have enough food in their 
stomach,

904
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:57,280
like most economists wrote their 
treatises from a full stomach.

905
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,070
Adam Smith,
the father of capitalism was also living

906
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:00,904
with his mother when he wrote the moral 
sentiments of man and the wealth of 

907
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,114
nations.
Okay.

908
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,360
So,
and so he was,

909
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,610
what,
what you don't hear as,

910
00:40:06,611 --> 00:40:08,300
as this,
this company.

911
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:08,981
Uh,
so he was like,

912
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:10,630
well,
the Internet Marketing Gurus,

913
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:11,464
and I was like,
Ferrari's that he rented this mom's 

914
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,320
driveway.
Well,

915
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:15,154
you know,
this,

916
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,993
this woman,
I was talking about the free market and 

917
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:19,930
I'm a free market guy and you know,
I'm a capitalist.

918
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:21,190
And she said,
that's great.

919
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:22,024
And I've been inundated in the sort of 
the extreme Milton Friedman Faa High 

920
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,770
School of Economics.
But she was like,

921
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,663
she had a thing called doughnut 
economics and she's out of Oxford and 

922
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,740
Kate Rayburn.
And she,

923
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,581
she said,
well,

924
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:34,414
you know,
what they don't tell you is when Adam 

925
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,333
Smith was writing the wealth of nations,
the fucking handbook for all capitalist 

926
00:40:39,551 --> 00:40:42,270
and free market guys like yourself is 
that his mother was like,

927
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,110
Adam,
dinner's almost ready.

928
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,000
And uh,
I,

929
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,700
I,
uh,

930
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,410
I folded your laundry,
you know,

931
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,540
what's that worth?
What the fuck is that?

932
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,263
You know what I mean?

933
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,500
So you got to take those things into 
account.

934
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,350
So funny,
my,

935
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,780
My,
my perspective on,

936
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,600
on capitalism has always come from a 
full belly.

937
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,670
Never been hungry.
I was a wrestler guys.

938
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,640
I did have to suck a lot of weight.
The point is never been hungry.

939
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,890
Never had to worry about where my next 
meal was coming from.

940
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,630
Certainly never had to worry about a 
roof over my head.

941
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:08,943
That's a.
that's a big difference between even a 

942
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:13,700
guy like me and you like this.
You got your.

943
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,070
Your perspective is going to be 
different.

944
00:41:15,071 --> 00:41:18,040
It's going to be adult has to be.
There's a level of compassion.

945
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:20,170
I think that as a civilization we 
haven't hit.

946
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,140
We haven't hit the right number.
We're in this number where we.

947
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,033
We don't give a fuck about each other 
enough and I think that one of the ways 

948
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:31,891
that that could be solved is I've been 
thinking a lot about universal basis,

949
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,220
basic income that

950
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,540
if that was a possibility where you 
could give everybody just a small amount

951
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:40,490
of money,
like $12,000

952
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:41,324
a year,
which is like a thousand dollars a 

953
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:45,440
month.
It's basically enough to get by,

954
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,720
but you wouldn't have to think about 
that.

955
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,870
Then you wouldn't have to think about 
that aspect.

956
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:51,704
Like you would always have food.
If we could make sure that everybody 

957
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:56,420
always had food and everybody always had
a place to sleep,

958
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,343
what would that cost?
What would it cost to eradicate 

959
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:02,360
homelessness to a point where if you 
were homeless,

960
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:03,194
it was a total voluntary situation.
Either you're just a nomad who likes 

961
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:09,920
camping or you're.
You're mentally ill and you just need to

962
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:10,754
sleep in a box because you think that's 
the only way that the aliens can't get 

963
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,130
you.
There's,

964
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,480
there's those people at skid row is 
filled with crazy.

965
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,080
Crazy.
How much,

966
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:22,700
how like what percentage of our cities 
have homeless people in them?

967
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,220
Like is it three percent of the city's 
homeless?

968
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,190
One percent of the city's almost summer 
climates.

969
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,220
It's higher,
right?

970
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:29,443
How would,
how,

971
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,290
how much of an impact would it be if you
could just bring that down to zero?

972
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:34,963
I mean,
wouldn't that be just great for the way 

973
00:42:38,061 --> 00:42:40,370
people feel about other people?
Well,

974
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:42,950
there are societies that do that.
Singapore,

975
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,750
certain Scandinavian,
very hippie.

976
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:47,300
This podcast is a strong weed.
Well,

977
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:47,781
no,
I mean,

978
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:48,614
but you're at.
You're asking a really good question 

979
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:51,980
because they have done these 
experiments.

980
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,510
Twenty billion.
That's it.

981
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,410
They,
they could end homeless,

982
00:42:56,411 --> 00:42:56,841
sorry,
sorry.

983
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:59,180
With money used to buy Christmas 
decorations,

984
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:00,883
it would cost about $20 million for the 
government to effectively eliminate 

985
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:05,684
homelessness in the United States of 
housing and urban development official 

986
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:10,010
told the New York Times Monday,
December 11,

987
00:43:10,011 --> 00:43:13,860
2012.
So I think for what we spend it,

988
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,713
it's kind of the wrong question because 
I give a man a fish or feed them in and 

989
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:18,140
teach a man to fish.

990
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,590
It's a really tricky.
It is.

991
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,460
They have to be careful.
It's a weird question,

992
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,160
but it's also one that no one's 
addressing.

993
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:26,383
It's like I,
you look at people who are homeless to 

994
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:29,811
go,
Oh,

995
00:43:29,811 --> 00:43:31,910
you fucking bomb,
get your shit together.

996
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,760
All you lazy.
Fuck or all you crazy person.

997
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,350
Oh,
he must be a junkie.

998
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,210
You know,
so,

999
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,043
so can I tell you,
so my friend works for does this worse 

1000
00:43:39,611 --> 00:43:43,670
with homeless youth and uh,
I'm pretty extensively.

1001
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:44,504
Hasn't done it for 20 years and actually
the what he'll tell you and he's very 

1002
00:43:50,421 --> 00:43:51,254
compassionate person,
but he'll tell you that the system in 

1003
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:56,444
this city of Los Angeles,
there are a lot of resources for people 

1004
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,860
on the street from places to get a 
computer,

1005
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:04,723
places to sleep,
places to take a shower there and and 

1006
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:09,800
what happens is there are a lot of 
people that get this network.

1007
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:10,663
They figure out where to go and one of 
the things that they are talking about 

1008
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:18,920
in this community and trying to get kids
and homeless people off the street.

1009
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,870
It's one,
one thing.

1010
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:22,250
There are a lot.
It's a complicated issue,

1011
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:26,410
but what has been said and it was 
shocking to me was they were like,

1012
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,210
problem is the system is so easy to 
game.

1013
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,160
It's so easy to.
You can live on the street and

1014
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,350
live.
You can.

1015
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,740
You can,
when you're a youth,

1016
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,200
you can actually,
if you understand how to how to work the

1017
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:38,034
system.
There are so many resources that a lot 

1018
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:45,060
of times it doesn't lend itself to 
really needing to get out of a situation

1019
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:45,894
right now,
but how many of these kids are playing 

1020
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,210
this out like this with a gaming the 
system?

1021
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,340
A lot of really because you're a human 
being,

1022
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:52,530
so you figure out where you can get your
breakfast,

1023
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:54,390
where you can get a shower,
where you can get your computer,

1024
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:55,224
where you can get your hangout,
where you can get all these things 

1025
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:59,280
somehow under that's hurting them.
I'm not saying,

1026
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:00,503
look,
I'm not saying we shouldn't have these 

1027
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:01,890
resources.
Right?

1028
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:02,723
I thought it was fascinating that a lot 
of the people that are really on the 

1029
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:05,424
front lines and all in this are saying 
that the the ironic and frustrating 

1030
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:14,751
thing sometimes can be that it does 
create not complacency,

1031
00:45:15,271 --> 00:45:18,900
but certainly there are way more 
resources than you think.

1032
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,733
There are people that have worked very 
hard to address this problem and people 

1033
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:28,050
do it when they know where to go.
They do know where to get food.

1034
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:30,870
They do know where to get a shower.
They do know what to do so they can live

1035
00:45:30,871 --> 00:45:31,630
on the street.
There's.

1036
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,060
There's many levels to this.
Right?

1037
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,770
First of all,
one of the big levels,

1038
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:37,250
the inescapable is mental illness.
Yeah.

1039
00:45:37,251 --> 00:45:38,084
Those people.
There's a lot of people that are 

1040
00:45:38,881 --> 00:45:39,714
wandering around the street that really 
should probably be in some sort of an 

1041
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:43,710
institution.
Yes.

1042
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,050
Getting healthcare.
Yes and medicated.

1043
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,913
Yes.
But how do you force someone to do that 

1044
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,833
and is it that,
is that the issue or is it a funding 

1045
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:51,970
issue?
You know,

1046
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,550
that was an issue apparently.
Putting Reagan.

1047
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,310
Yeah.
When Reagan was in office,

1048
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,233
they lower the standard of what's Cuckoo
for cocoa puffs and they just let a 

1049
00:46:00,211 --> 00:46:01,650
bunch of dudes just wander through the 
street.

1050
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,513
That actually wasn't the.
It was a little bit more complicated 

1051
00:46:04,421 --> 00:46:04,920
than that.
It was.

1052
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,753
It was at the state doesn't have a right
to keep you against your will if you 

1053
00:46:08,191 --> 00:46:09,001
don't want to be.
Right.

1054
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:09,834
So.
So there had to be very specific 

1055
00:46:11,131 --> 00:46:12,750
criteria for that.
So you know,

1056
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:13,584
this whole thing with gun control,
like we need to help mental health 

1057
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:16,254
issue.
Well,

1058
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:17,363
there's,
if you talked to the psychiatrist will 

1059
00:46:18,711 --> 00:46:19,544
be like,
look dude,

1060
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,910
the criteria for getting tougher,
saying,

1061
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:24,803
saying and getting somebody essentially 
classified as a danger to society and 

1062
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,360
uh,
like a real threat is very steep.

1063
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,890
It's hard to do.
Yeah,

1064
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,410
you,
you,

1065
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,320
you can't do that because somebody talks
to themselves.

1066
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:38,850
You can't do it because they're hearing 
voices.

1067
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,890
Well,
the other doesn't want to visit that kid

1068
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,760
two years ago,
right?

1069
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,550
The kid who shot up to school in Florida
and they decided he wasn't a threat,

1070
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,800
but he might not have been a threat to 
years ago.

1071
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,180
Like people saying,
Oh,

1072
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:52,830
you know,
they visited them two years ago.

1073
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:53,730
They're incompetent.
No,

1074
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:57,210
he might be a different person now you 
have to realize that like people get way

1075
00:46:57,211 --> 00:46:59,880
worse.
Like we've all known people that we knew

1076
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:02,550
at one point in time in your life,
then you don't see him for six years and

1077
00:47:02,551 --> 00:47:03,271
then you see them,
you're like,

1078
00:47:03,271 --> 00:47:04,104
whoa,
well that's because people evolve and 

1079
00:47:05,371 --> 00:47:07,470
sometimes they evolve and sometimes they
don't.

1080
00:47:07,471 --> 00:47:09,690
Sometimes they recede.
Sometimes it gets ugly.

1081
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,913
So definitely didn't you go crazy?
Aren't you talking about how because 20 

1082
00:47:14,191 --> 00:47:16,580
percent of boys in this fucking country,
r,

1083
00:47:16,581 --> 00:47:17,414
d,
a r,

1084
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,740
r,
a diagnosed with Adhd,

1085
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:21,443
diagnosed of course because you haven't 
spent 10 minutes with you who's not an 

1086
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:27,000
expert on Adhd.
It could be a thousand other things.

1087
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,350
I just.
We have a boy.

1088
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,190
It was on Rhonda.
Patrick

1089
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,263
posted up to study and then we're 
lugging a d hd was something that was 

1090
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:38,230
not the one that was created.
See if Google this too.

1091
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:41,770
Sorry.
Adhd was the one that was created by the

1092
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:44,080
advertising agency.
What a surprise.

1093
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:45,603
There's been several conditions that 
were literally invented by advertising 

1094
00:47:50,711 --> 00:47:51,544
agencies in order to promote a cure,
so it's attention deficit hyperactivity 

1095
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,110
disorder.
Yeah.

1096
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,493
Look,
I don't know how much of that is a real 

1097
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:05,050
disease and maybe maybe some of it is.
Maybe I'm not.

1098
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:05,943
I'm obviously not an expert.
Maybe some of it is a kid whose brain 

1099
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:09,390
works different.
Right.

1100
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,533
Let me tell you something,
man.

1101
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:14,500
My dog might have adhd or whatever the 
fuck it is.

1102
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,900
I go to see him and he goes crazy.
He's.

1103
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,960
He's out of his fucking mind.
He thinks we're going running,

1104
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,100
he's running around in circles,
he's hopping up and down.

1105
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,020
He bolts back and forth into the 
backyard.

1106
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,000
He's like a maniac,
like I can't control them.

1107
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,730
You know what the solution for that is?
I take him running,

1108
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:28,564
right?
I don't lock them in a room and then 

1109
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,364
drug them.
You know what I was wanting to dealing 

1110
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:33,130
with little kid.
You know when I was really focused.

1111
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,750
You know what?
I wasn't focused Algebra.

1112
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,310
You know what?
I was really focused.

1113
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:38,620
If somebody started talking about 
fighting and how to throw a right hand,

1114
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:40,180
just think about what I'm saying with my
dog.

1115
00:48:40,181 --> 00:48:41,014
I mean there's really something to that.
Like that dog wanted to go run and 

1116
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:45,760
invite you to forced him to sit into a 
room.

1117
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,460
He would go crazy bark and he wouldn't 
want to do that.

1118
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,610
That's how kids are exactly the same 
goddamn thing.

1119
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,840
There it is.
Yeah.

1120
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,490
The drugging of the American boy.

1121
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:55,840
But what was the tweet?
Jamie?

1122
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,700
Is this an esquire article?
What did it.

1123
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,593
What did the tweet say?
One in five boys will be diagnosed with 

1124
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:04,030
Adhd by the time they make it to high 
school to date.

1125
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,043
Only one significant study has looked at
adhd misdiagnosis and found 20 to 25 

1126
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:14,370
percent of boys were misdiagnosed and 
this was before a d,

1127
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:16,900
h,
d was a ca as common as it is now,

1128
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:17,883
so they're saying it's a real issue.
I know quite a few people that are 

1129
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:23,590
drugging their kids.
This is my next door neighbor.

1130
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:26,260
They put their fucking kid on Ritalin.
There was nothing wrong with this kid.

1131
00:49:26,261 --> 00:49:27,094
I talked to that kid all the times.
It just takes too much energy that you 

1132
00:49:30,431 --> 00:49:31,264
just had too much energy and they didn't
want to deal with it and they weren't 

1133
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:34,054
paying attention to them.
They worked all day and then the kids 

1134
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:36,304
bouncing off the walls and nobody wants 
to take care of the kid and so they put 

1135
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:39,310
him on Ritalin.

1136
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,110
Awful dude,
it's happening everywhere.

1137
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,033
It's happening.
The bad side effects some of these 

1138
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,370
drugs.
Look at this,

1139
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,473
six point 4 million children between the
ages of four and 17 have been diagnosed 

1140
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,424
with Adhd by high school.
Nearly 20 percent of all boys will have 

1141
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:58,090
been diagnosed with Adhd.
A 37 percent,

1142
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,060
37 percent increase since 2003.
My son,

1143
00:50:01,061 --> 00:50:01,894
my son is a classic example of a kid who
doesn't like to sit still and rough 

1144
00:50:04,841 --> 00:50:07,370
houses.
Google does have adhd,

1145
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,930
so if a school's have no time for horse,
they have no time for boy energy.

1146
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:11,880
No,
you're.

1147
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,170
You're.
You're condemned because it's aggressive

1148
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:15,004
and my son is the way to not be a boy.
He's being told that his hands are hot 

1149
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:20,230
lava and he can't use his hands.
That's healthy.

1150
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:23,180
Oh my God.
What kind of liberal school you've taken

1151
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,760
for public school?
Public School.

1152
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:25,683
That's what happens.

1153
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,040
That's awful.
This is what we're dealing with.

1154
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,820
A 1900 adhd was first mentioned in 19.
Oh,

1155
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:35,210
two British pediatric pediatrician.
So it must be a wrong one.

1156
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:39,200
A different one described an abnormal 
defect of moral control and children.

1157
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,393
He found that some effective children 
could not control behavior the way a 

1158
00:50:42,681 --> 00:50:45,140
typical child would,
but they were still intelligent.

1159
00:50:45,141 --> 00:50:47,640
Maybe it was restless legs syndrome.
Was that.

1160
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:50,570
Didn't you tell me that one might have 
been,

1161
00:50:50,571 --> 00:50:52,330
but I don't know.
Who was the.

1162
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,920
Who was the guest?
Do you remember?

1163
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:58,130
The guest was a woman who was telling us
all about this.

1164
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,340
Some medical expert.
Was it Kelly Brogan?

1165
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,640
It might've been.
Might've been Kelly Brogan.

1166
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,740
Dr Kelly,
but what didn't you say weren't.

1167
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,160
Aren't there studies about school 
shooters and a lot of them were on SSR.

1168
00:51:11,161 --> 00:51:12,710
I's and stuff.
Yes.

1169
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,380
Mass shooters.
Not just school shooters,

1170
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:16,483
but like even this Vegas Guy,
the Vegas guy was on anti anxiety 

1171
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:21,824
medication.

1172
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,430
Yeah,
that stuff in.

1173
00:51:23,431 --> 00:51:26,450
That's also Chris Cornell was on anti 
anxiety medication.

1174
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:31,650
There is a lot of people who are on 
psych drugs who lose their fucking minds

1175
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:33,830
because psych drugs are not universal.
Right?

1176
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,890
Like there's no thing like here's a 
perfect example.

1177
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,053
Say if you have a.
There is a solution that makes alcohol 

1178
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,180
91 octane.
Right.

1179
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,273
And you add something to that and you 
can add some additives and it'll spike 

1180
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:55,130
it up and you could try to find the 
right mixture,

1181
00:51:55,131 --> 00:51:55,964
but that's just fucking gasoline.
You throwing things in there and try to 

1182
00:51:58,641 --> 00:51:59,474
mix it up.
You don't know exactly what the right 

1183
00:52:00,531 --> 00:52:03,440
thing is.
That's how they're doing your brain.

1184
00:52:03,441 --> 00:52:05,120
Correct.
When the chipkey these things,

1185
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:07,010
that's why they say,
try this one.

1186
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,450
There's not like,
okay,

1187
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:09,973
you have one cup of flour,
you need two eggs and one tablespoon of 

1188
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:15,250
sugar.
No,

1189
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:15,481
no,
no,

1190
00:52:15,481 --> 00:52:15,920
no,
no.

1191
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,753
There's no specific recipe.
And what the fuck does feel good mean 

1192
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,890
that the other thing that they're not 
taking into account is said,

1193
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,753
you know,
you might be depressed for a good 

1194
00:52:23,871 --> 00:52:25,340
reason.
In other words,

1195
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:26,174
if you made me do a job I hated and,
and I wasn't allowed to work out or I 

1196
00:52:30,441 --> 00:52:32,030
didn't know how to eat or a thousand 
things.

1197
00:52:32,031 --> 00:52:34,040
They make me feel good because I have to
self regulate.

1198
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:34,874
Yes.
I'm 51 and I gotta I gotta I still have 

1199
00:52:37,131 --> 00:52:39,190
to self regulate because otherwise,
um,

1200
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:43,010
you know,
I'll go crazy if I don't have.

1201
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:46,580
If I didn't know how to do those things,
I would probably be depressed now.

1202
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,270
Now you're going to give me drugs.
Well that's not going to help me.

1203
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,061
Well,
here's what it is.

1204
00:52:51,061 --> 00:52:53,090
What I'm doing.
My behavior is what it is.

1205
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,013
For sure,
but here's where I think you've got to 

1206
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:58,160
recognize that that kid,
your son who has that energy,

1207
00:52:58,161 --> 00:53:01,520
that's a gift and what you're doing is 
you're making them squander that gift by

1208
00:53:01,521 --> 00:53:03,920
sitting them down in a fucking charity,
wants to go crazy.

1209
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:07,280
That kid is supposed to be like my dog 
running around all day.

1210
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,890
Okay?
My dog is a year old at seven.

1211
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,060
He's a seven year old dog basically,
you know,

1212
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:14,600
in dog years and he's like a seven year 
old kid.

1213
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,790
He's running around,
he's going fucking crazy,

1214
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,430
you know,
but that's because he wants to run.

1215
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:21,080
Exactly.
But once he runs,

1216
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,120
he's high dogs the best.
Yes.

1217
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,810
And your kid will be to,
if you,

1218
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,653
if your kid was involved in something 
where they emphasized physical movement 

1219
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,820
and then taught things in between 
workouts,

1220
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:34,450
taught things in between,
you know,

1221
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,230
they play a game outside,
play a little dodge ball,

1222
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:39,390
play a little soccer,
play a little basketball.

1223
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:41,220
Then after you wear yourself out a 
little,

1224
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:42,850
come sit down.
We're going to teach about math.

1225
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,420
Teach them about math and then you know 
you're going to show them,

1226
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:46,230
this is leverage.

1227
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,063
We're all going to pick things up.
Can you think you'd pick it up like or 

1228
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,820
like let them now pick it up with 
leverage.

1229
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:51,610
Oh,
you see,

1230
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,443
you understand you could teach kids in a
very physical way instead of forcing 

1231
00:53:56,011 --> 00:53:56,844
them to sit down.
Who the fuck wants to sit that hard ass 

1232
00:53:59,231 --> 00:54:01,170
chair?
We feel other people's gum on the top of

1233
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,280
your leg.
You know,

1234
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,230
it sucks.
It sucks.

1235
00:54:04,231 --> 00:54:07,860
You're sitting there waiting for the 
fucking class to be over stuck.

1236
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,190
Don't get it.
Their energies.

1237
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,043
How did I ever tell you that?
My acting teacher who looked at me time 

1238
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:15,810
is the greatest.
And he goes,

1239
00:54:15,811 --> 00:54:17,310
uh,
I had done a scene.

1240
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:17,761
He goes,
you know,

1241
00:54:17,761 --> 00:54:20,250
we got it with you.
Get a little self esteem problem.

1242
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,960
You think of yourself as a second 
banana.

1243
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:23,820
And I was like,
what?

1244
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,111
He goes,
yeah,

1245
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:26,730
you got to start believing in yourself 
more.

1246
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,790
He goes,
you got to start thinking of yourself as

1247
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:30,624
a first banana.
Did he say this when he was in his 

1248
00:54:31,621 --> 00:54:32,640
underwear?
He did.

1249
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,540
He was,
I was wearing,

1250
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:35,220
I was wearing,
I was wearing black place on it.

1251
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:37,520
He was put these black lace on Nissan.
Hey God,

1252
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:38,720
I'm going to pierce her nipples.
Know this.

1253
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,710
What's that?
Why?

1254
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,490
Why do you smell a Cologne that persil 
this is weird.

1255
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:47,040
So he,
he says that to me and I'm a young actor

1256
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:49,740
and I'm fucked up of her and I'm like,
I got to get better.

1257
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:52,650
I got to get a higher self esteem.
So I say to my buddies,

1258
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:53,484
kind of group of guys,
one of my buddy's older and wiser and I 

1259
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:56,920
said,
man,

1260
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,130
I,
I was told I have low self esteem,

1261
00:54:59,131 --> 00:54:59,964
you know,
and I heard fortunate back over there 

1262
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:07,950
goes,
thank God you really think you'd be this

1263
00:55:09,631 --> 00:55:10,464
funny if you fucking like yourself bro,
and you think you'd be a fucking actor 

1264
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:14,940
if you liked yourself,
go fuck yourself.

1265
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,160
That guy's an asshole.
Keep hating yourself.

1266
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:19,740
It's the best part of you.
That's how that got tanks.

1267
00:55:19,741 --> 00:55:20,820
Monk.
I know.

1268
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:21,990
I was like,
you're right.

1269
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,060
I liked it.
The whole point,

1270
00:55:24,061 --> 00:55:27,810
that whole thing that drives me is the 
fact that I've never been satisfied with

1271
00:55:27,811 --> 00:55:29,700
myself and I'm never going to lose that.
I,

1272
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,280
if I,
if you make me really happy with myself,

1273
00:55:32,281 --> 00:55:34,500
I'm not so sure it's a good thing.
You know what?

1274
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:36,960
You got to figure out how to do,
I think not you,

1275
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:42,080
but I think humans to somehow or another
disconnect you from the result.

1276
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:45,570
If you could figure out a way to 
disconnect you from the result,

1277
00:55:45,571 --> 00:55:46,404
you could look at it more objectively.
You're going to feel the sting of 

1278
00:55:48,601 --> 00:55:50,100
failure.
It's a fact,

1279
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:53,580
but you have to recognize what that is 
and intellectualize it.

1280
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:54,780
You got to put it in this little box.

1281
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,970
Okay,
this is good because now I'm going to be

1282
00:55:56,971 --> 00:55:57,804
fucking pumped up to improve.
I'm going to recognize the urgency and 

1283
00:56:00,211 --> 00:56:02,850
failure because it's so extremely 
uncomfortable,

1284
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:05,190
but that's not me.
What me is,

1285
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:06,024
is the person who's doing this and I'm 
eventually going to be a finished 

1286
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:09,150
product.
I'm going to figure this out,

1287
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,213
but right now,
that little thing that happened that 

1288
00:56:11,251 --> 00:56:12,330
sucks.
Like,

1289
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:14,350
okay,
don't freak out you.

1290
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,130
Everybody fucks up.
Maybe you fucked up this way,

1291
00:56:17,131 --> 00:56:20,430
but you didn't run into someone's car.
Maybe you did run into someone's car,

1292
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:21,264
but you didn't do this.
Everybody's got their own little fuck 

1293
00:56:22,831 --> 00:56:25,360
failure,
a huge part of part of being a human.

1294
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:28,000
You got to understand the consequences 
of doing something incorrectly.

1295
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:29,283
The end,
especially the humiliating feeling of 

1296
00:56:31,211 --> 00:56:35,080
being like put in your place like you 
might think you're good at something and

1297
00:56:35,081 --> 00:56:35,710
then you fail at it.

1298
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:36,543
You Go,
oh my God,

1299
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,370
I got this elevated sense of how good I 
was at this thing.

1300
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:40,204
Now I have to look at it more 
objectively and I have to get to that 

1301
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:46,891
place where I thought I was just.
People don't want to wear Andy Kalpin.

1302
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,980
Have you had great very smart guy,
brilliant guy.

1303
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,260
I said,
what's best for recovery?

1304
00:56:52,261 --> 00:56:54,010
And he goes,
why do you want to recover?

1305
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:54,933
That's what do you mean?
He goes,

1306
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:55,893
well,
why don't you let your body adapt and 

1307
00:56:56,741 --> 00:56:58,090
figure it out.
Just eat some food,

1308
00:56:58,091 --> 00:56:58,924
see how it feels,
but maybe maybe suffer a little bit and 

1309
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:01,594
see what that does because your body 
might have to compensate and get 

1310
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:04,560
stronger as a result.
Sure.

1311
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:05,900
An interesting way of looking at it,
I was like,

1312
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,780
I think there's definitely something to 
that.

1313
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:10,150
I mean,
I think that's why people push,

1314
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:10,720
right?

1315
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,270
That's what pushing is.
It's forcing adaptation.

1316
00:57:13,271 --> 00:57:14,051
You're,
your body's going,

1317
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:16,450
oh my God,
this asshole wants to dead lift now.

1318
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:16,961
Right?
Okay,

1319
00:57:16,961 --> 00:57:18,070
I've got to,
I've got to adapt.

1320
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:18,904
Now.
That's also with the sauna is you got 

1321
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:21,490
to.
Your body's trying to adapt.

1322
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:22,563
Okay,
this asshole wants to live at 170 

1323
00:57:23,591 --> 00:57:24,424
degrees.
I have to figure out how to keep 

1324
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:26,284
everything from shutting down.
Let's mass produce these heat shock 

1325
00:57:28,961 --> 00:57:31,100
proteins and try to figure out,
you know,

1326
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,113
how norepinephrine,
it's also like being honest with 

1327
00:57:34,781 --> 00:57:38,380
somebody is right.
So like it's also kinda like sitting and

1328
00:57:38,381 --> 00:57:40,210
hearing things.
You don't want to hear about yourself.

1329
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,360
Maybe shortcomings,
right?

1330
00:57:41,361 --> 00:57:44,020
So when somebody says some somebody 
something to you,

1331
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:48,310
like you're not taking yourself,
you're not working hard enough or you're

1332
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:50,740
not working correctly or you did this 
wrong,

1333
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:56,460
or your ideas are a bit bankrupt.
Let me tell you why that shit is not fun

1334
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,080
at all here.

1335
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:00,423
But it's exactly like working out.
If you could just sit and listen and 

1336
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:05,050
take it in,
not argue it.

1337
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:06,970
Listen,
take it in,

1338
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,490
feel bad.
For Awhile,

1339
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:09,363
I promise you,
I promise you that that's probably the 

1340
00:58:12,371 --> 00:58:16,300
best way to change listening and hearing
it because it'll bother you,

1341
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:19,720
let it bother you and then let that 
spurned you to action.

1342
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,100
If you,
if you,

1343
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,053
if you want to get,
if you want to shout Christina summers 

1344
00:58:23,321 --> 00:58:24,154
down or you want to get into your safe 
space and not hear those things because 

1345
00:58:27,491 --> 00:58:28,870
they hurt you,
this is why they're.

1346
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:30,790
Yeah,
but that's only part of the problem.

1347
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:32,710
The real problem is a control power 
problem.

1348
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:33,743
The country,
there's control and power problems 

1349
00:58:34,581 --> 00:58:35,414
because these are 18 year old kids and 
they've just gotten away from home for 

1350
00:58:37,031 --> 00:58:37,864
the first time and they want to exercise
their power and they want to change the 

1351
00:58:39,911 --> 00:58:41,320
world and they're fucking babies.

1352
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,353
They have half baked brains and they 
want to yell shit out and they think 

1353
00:58:45,311 --> 00:58:46,144
that they're doing the right thing.
They really do and they were yelling 

1354
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:48,560
outside.
You can't have.

1355
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:49,463
We won't have fascists in our school.
You see Jordan Peterson was doing a 

1356
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:54,730
speech and they were literally at the 
windows.

1357
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,830
They climb the walls and got to the 
windows,

1358
00:58:56,831 --> 00:59:00,310
were banging on the windows from the 
outside while the speech went on.

1359
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,050
Wow Dude.
It's disturbing.

1360
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,003
And everyone inside his super calm and 
there's people that keep an eye on the 

1361
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:06,274
window because you hear it cracking.
So like there's a smashing this fucking 

1362
00:59:08,951 --> 00:59:11,980
window just banging up against it.
The entire time he's talking,

1363
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,750
he just hear Bang,
Bang,

1364
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:14,584
Bang,
Bang,

1365
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:15,371
Bang,
Bang,

1366
00:59:15,371 --> 00:59:16,204
Bang,
Bang.

1367
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,073
And they're yelling shit outside about 
fascism or it's like they don't even 

1368
00:59:20,411 --> 00:59:21,244
know what the fuck that means.
Like they literally are just saying it 

1369
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:25,400
for anybody who disagrees with them.

1370
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:29,150
When a real fascist comes along,
they're going to be so duped.

1371
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,353
There'll be,
there'll be shot against a wall and 

1372
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:33,510
shot.
That's what,

1373
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,393
that's what fascists do real fast.
But they seem to think that disagreeing 

1374
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,733
with,
uh,

1375
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:43,400
people were out of their fucking mind.
They don't have any quotes fascism,

1376
00:59:43,401 --> 00:59:45,230
they,
but they have no confidence.

1377
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:45,530
Right?
So,

1378
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:46,980
so.
Well,

1379
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,833
because if you're having an argument 
with somebody and you end up hitting 

1380
00:59:49,731 --> 00:59:52,250
them because they're saying because you 
don't like it means you don't have.

1381
00:59:52,251 --> 00:59:54,100
The idea is to compete with their ideas.
You know,

1382
00:59:54,101 --> 00:59:54,934
I don't think it's that dude.
I think they're just young and they 

1383
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:58,790
don't understand what the fuck they're 
doing.

1384
00:59:58,860 --> 00:59:59,250
They're,
they're,

1385
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:02,420
they're enjoying this ability to scream 
out.

1386
01:00:02,421 --> 01:00:03,670
It's like I said,
practicing.

1387
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:05,840
Yeah.
Have got way too much power.

1388
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:06,800
Their children.
Yeah.

1389
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,550
They're essentially children.
Yeah.

1390
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,830
Yeah.
They could go to war,

1391
01:00:09,831 --> 01:00:10,880
some of them and yeah,
they can,

1392
01:00:10,881 --> 01:00:11,600
but that's not right.

1393
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,700
Anyway.
They probably shouldn't be able to.

1394
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:16,700
Probably like 21 before you make that 
decision.

1395
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:18,043
The whole thing's fucking crazy.
It's crazy that they don't have enough 

1396
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:22,730
security to keep the fucking kids are 
banging on the windows.

1397
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,700
Like what kind of nonsense facility do 
you run?

1398
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,770
You just didn't see that comment.
Are you guys,

1399
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,810
do you have the Internet?
You guys have the Internet.

1400
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,660
It's kind of see what's going on.
As kind of knew the American culture has

1401
01:00:32,661 --> 01:00:34,670
always been a few years.
Know what I'm saying?

1402
01:00:34,671 --> 01:00:37,750
American culture has always given like 
their kids.

1403
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,110
Is that recently too.
I mean,

1404
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,393
Jonathan,
I had talks about this like helicopter 

1405
01:00:42,411 --> 01:00:43,244
parenting and sort of the idea that your
kid has his own autonomy and it's very 

1406
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:46,810
important.
I,

1407
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,010
I've,
I've seen all the new science on this.

1408
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:49,950
I mean for sure.
Yeah,

1409
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:51,320
definitely.
Your kid has ticks,

1410
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,333
is allowed to exercise their point of 
view and have a tantrum and then you 

1411
01:00:55,671 --> 01:00:56,780
have to show them that,
that,

1412
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:02,020
that there are consequences for that and
that's a new way of looking at,

1413
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,250
you know,
a lot of cultures are like,

1414
01:01:04,251 --> 01:01:05,084
Hey,
if you fucking talk to me like that 

1415
01:01:06,321 --> 01:01:08,240
again,
I'm going to hit you in the fucking.

1416
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:09,283
I'm going to take this riding crop and 
whack your fucking legs or whatever it 

1417
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:13,670
might be.
So I don't know.

1418
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,980
Well,
we've got a real soft right now.

1419
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:16,873
It's a real easy time to be alive and I 
think ultimately the ship's going to 

1420
01:01:18,981 --> 01:01:19,814
balance out a really do.
And I think ultimately a lot of these 

1421
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:28,060
kids that are super radical now will 
probably stabilize as they get older and

1422
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:29,294
more experienced,
would be more embarrassed with some of 

1423
01:01:30,351 --> 01:01:33,080
the things they've done to especially to
disrupt free speech.

1424
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:33,933
They they should really be embarrassed 
by that because it's so foolish like 

1425
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:39,080
you.
All you have to do is formulate a really

1426
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:39,914
good argument with ideas and then you 
play those ideas out in the court of 

1427
01:01:43,401 --> 01:01:44,234
public opinion.
You do it in some sort of a way where 

1428
01:01:45,951 --> 01:01:49,700
you have a one person representing one 
side,

1429
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:53,510
one person representing the other side,
and you beat that idea with better ideas

1430
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:54,560
and that's what you're supposed to do.

1431
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:58,190
That's the whole exercise and these 
people that oppose your ideas.

1432
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,730
You should use that to challenge you to 
improve your ideas,

1433
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:02,564
to make your,
improve your ideas undeniable so that 

1434
01:02:05,141 --> 01:02:07,790
when you present that argument,
you've looked at it from both sides.

1435
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:08,743
There's far too many people,
including these people that are 

1436
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:12,890
interrupting people that are only 
looking at an argument from the point of

1437
01:02:12,891 --> 01:02:13,724
view that they would like to be correct 
and they're only looking at it like 

1438
01:02:15,711 --> 01:02:17,630
she's a fashion.
She's a Nazi.

1439
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,770
They're not looking at real,
hey,

1440
01:02:18,771 --> 01:02:19,604
maybe that's just a lady and maybe she's
a nice lady and maybe she's got some 

1441
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:24,450
points and maybe I agree with her and 
maybe I don't,

1442
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,120
but you've got to let her talk like this
is all nonsense.

1443
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:29,070
Holding signs up and trying to get 
attention.

1444
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,070
This is not the time for that.
It doesn't persuade anybody over to your

1445
01:02:32,071 --> 01:02:32,460
side.

1446
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,293
I'll tell you that much.
They don't even try to do that and 

1447
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,093
they're just trying to recruit the 
troops and then the also the trying to 

1448
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:38,453
send out a flag that they care and 
they're out here doing the right God 

1449
01:02:41,721 --> 01:02:42,554
damn thing using my voice.
I'm out here using my voice like it's 

1450
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:46,920
like,
no,

1451
01:02:46,921 --> 01:02:47,754
you're being a little kid that's 
interrupting their tribe and its ways 

1452
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:54,240
you're going to be against something.
Then to define what they're for.

1453
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:55,074
If you ever asked them what their for 
like I had this conversation quality 

1454
01:02:57,031 --> 01:03:00,000
bro.
Was that equality where everything,

1455
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:01,680
they don't know what that.
Including comedians.

1456
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,780
I want an equal number.
Yeah.

1457
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,520
You see what that one Bert?
Yeah.

1458
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:06,893
Yeah.
When someone wants to medians men and 

1459
01:03:08,521 --> 01:03:09,990
women,
it's the dumbest Shit I've ever heard in

1460
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:12,000
my life.
Are you funny enough to be on the stage?

1461
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:12,630
Okay.

1462
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:14,760
Then I don't give a fuck what you look 
like.

1463
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,500
I don't care if you're.
Nobody wants to hear that.

1464
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,393
Yeah.
Remember when Jerry Seinfeld got in 

1465
01:03:18,781 --> 01:03:22,500
trouble because they were like,
why's comedian cars having coffee?

1466
01:03:22,501 --> 01:03:25,450
All white guys.
Well I dunno,

1467
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,360
but you know there are a lot of funny 
white guys,

1468
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:29,580
so fuck off.
Funny Black guys too.

1469
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:30,443
Well that's what Jerry Seinfeld studies.
So essentially I don't care what color 

1470
01:03:32,761 --> 01:03:35,760
they are.
I speak the language of comedy or funny.

1471
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:36,900
Exactly.
And they were like,

1472
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:40,420
that sounds racist.
Sorry,

1473
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:45,510
but that sounds racist.
You're dumb and you're fucking dumb.

1474
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:46,733
What would you say if you were there?
And that lady said that because there 

1475
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:51,810
was a woman,
two guys are sitting in a guy and a girl

1476
01:03:51,811 --> 01:03:52,644
sitting there talking and they played 
the Jerry Seinfeld clip and then the 

1477
01:03:55,171 --> 01:03:57,270
woman who was an African American was 
like,

1478
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,280
I'm sorry,
but that's racist.

1479
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:03,510
And I was sitting at home by comic in 
the world and most of his audiences that

1480
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:04,344
most of his ticket pairs are white.
He's undeniable that most of the people 

1481
01:04:07,231 --> 01:04:09,750
that go to his movies are white and he 
and he,

1482
01:04:09,751 --> 01:04:11,490
he turned it because he's fucking 
hilarious.

1483
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:12,343
Right.
But that doesn't have anything to do 

1484
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:13,674
with what she,
what she saying is that he's racist 

1485
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,060
because he's not having black people on 
his show.

1486
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,760
I don't know how.
But he.

1487
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:24,810
And he's saying,
no,

1488
01:04:24,811 --> 01:04:26,190
I don't even care.
I just care.

1489
01:04:26,191 --> 01:04:27,540
Are they funny?
I don't care.

1490
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:28,890
Like diversity doesn't mean anything to 
me.

1491
01:04:28,891 --> 01:04:30,330
I don't care.
And she's like,

1492
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:35,210
that's so racist.
But I feel like when you say something's

1493
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,710
racist today,
you don't have to back it up anymore.

1494
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:39,300
I agree.
People just back off.

1495
01:04:39,301 --> 01:04:41,490
Especially if you're saying a white 
person is racist.

1496
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:42,813
If you say a white person's racist,
everybody pulls out the microphone 

1497
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:44,760
though.

1498
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,170
My magnifying glass.
Wait a minute,

1499
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,600
what have we got here?
We're looking at a waste.

1500
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:53,100
But they'll also say,
you don't even know it.

1501
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,450
You don't.
You don't even know it.

1502
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,750
Like you're,
you're the white supremacy is everywhere

1503
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:00,590
and will they teach that at schools now?
So now they teach that also at some jobs

1504
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:05,220
you have to go to bias training.
Yeah.

1505
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,500
Bias.
Conscious bias training.

1506
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:08,363
What do they call it?
I think it's antibiotic conscious 

1507
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:11,183
subconscious bias training.
Like you might even realize you're 

1508
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:17,470
racist and you are racist.
How many black guys got in late?

1509
01:05:17,471 --> 01:05:18,040
Because of all this

1510
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,390
though?
Hopefully a lot.

1511
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:22,090
A lot of hippie white chicks just want 
to show they're not racist.

1512
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:25,120
Oh,
that just got it out of his dick down.

1513
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,590
Amy.
It's just,

1514
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:30,190
it's,
I'm in the choir jerking off.

1515
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:35,250
What's in crying?
It's just weird,

1516
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:36,011
man.
It's just.

1517
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:36,844
I never,
I've never seen us so divided and part 

1518
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:41,630
of it has to do with trump for sure.
There's like this reaction like that.

1519
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:46,180
They feel like I'm really obligated to 
act.

1520
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,790
People feel obligated to act and try to 
make things change,

1521
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,460
which I think is ultimately good.
All this thing,

1522
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,060
the all what's going on right now does 
not concern me nearly as much as it does

1523
01:05:55,061 --> 01:05:55,894
a lot of other people because I feel 
like people are already reacting to it 

1524
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,480
and already going,
what in the fuck you know,

1525
01:06:01,481 --> 01:06:02,314
and,
and the ship is already starting to 

1526
01:06:03,731 --> 01:06:04,564
write itself.

1527
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,673
Well,
the Oscars was the lowest rated I think 

1528
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:08,494
in the history of the Oscar heard that,
but it's also a 26 million people 

1529
01:06:11,831 --> 01:06:13,780
watched.
That's a lot of fucking people.

1530
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,500
That's a lot.
Don't Shit on someone who got 26 million

1531
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:21,340
people were afraid to be.
People get very kind of like,

1532
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,900
wow,
we're getting political here.

1533
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:26,560
And when they looked at the numbers,
the numbers where they were comparing it

1534
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:30,820
to like 2013,
there were down $5 million from 2013,

1535
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:34,060
I think it was.
Guess what was it around 2013 Netflix.

1536
01:06:34,061 --> 01:06:36,010
True.
There's a lot more shit to watch.

1537
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:37,690
True.
What's it down from last year?

1538
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:40,450
There's definitely people that are bored
with Hollywood though,

1539
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,800
like enough.
Well,

1540
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:42,634
they Hollywood's overreach.
I think Hollywood tends to be what 

1541
01:06:45,281 --> 01:06:48,160
bothers me about Hollywood is there 
virtuous virtue signaling,

1542
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:51,940
like they're going to set an example you
fucking guys like you want to be liked.

1543
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,850
Okay.
And you're as fickle as it gets.

1544
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:55,893
They were the same people that were 
standing up and clapping for Roman 

1545
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,470
Polanski.
I'm sorry man.

1546
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:00,760
Well,
some of them were.

1547
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:03,010
Some of them were really saying some 
ridiculous shit.

1548
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:04,240
I mean,
come on guys.

1549
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:08,140
It's a long time ago and he's drugged 
and sodomized at 13 year old.

1550
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,320
I think he was like more than one too.
Yeah.

1551
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,700
So,
so guess what?

1552
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:15,460
I can't have that guy.
You're not kidding.

1553
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:17,560
They wanted to sign a petition to bring 
them back in the country.

1554
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,330
I,
I can't forgive that.

1555
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,950
No.
Stay in France.

1556
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:22,323
Well,
they want to bring it back to the 

1557
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:26,530
country to arrest them and they're 
really trying hard to do that.

1558
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:28,263
And there's people that resist that.
I think he's an amazing artist and you 

1559
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:34,030
know,
artists are just be consistent though.

1560
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,310
You can't system.
That's where I draw the line.

1561
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:39,010
You can't drug kids.
Fuck with Asia Argento,

1562
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:39,873
who was one of the,
one of the people that came out against 

1563
01:07:40,961 --> 01:07:44,320
Harvey Weinstein,
she had been raped by him apparently,

1564
01:07:44,321 --> 01:07:46,750
and then she had a sexual relationship 
for 10 years afterwards,

1565
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:48,010
which by the way,
people like,

1566
01:07:48,011 --> 01:07:48,844
ah,
that I actually forgive that because 

1567
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:51,430
people go back to the trauma,
right?

1568
01:07:51,431 --> 01:07:52,690
They want to relive it on their own 
terms,

1569
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:56,570
but she signed the petition to for,
for Roman Polanski to,

1570
01:07:56,710 --> 01:08:00,220
you know,
to be freed when he was put under arrest

1571
01:08:00,221 --> 01:08:03,910
and I believe it was Switzerland and now
that's not consistent.

1572
01:08:03,911 --> 01:08:05,830
I'm sorry man,
I'm sorry.

1573
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:08,170
But if that guy is just as bad as,
yeah,

1574
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:11,050
you can see the petition online.
What was her perspective?

1575
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:12,963
She was somebody who thought Roman 
Polanski should not be prosecuted for 

1576
01:08:17,331 --> 01:08:20,240
something that happened a long time ago.
She signed that petition.

1577
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:21,950
I would never sign that petition.

1578
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:22,993
So there's a lot of disconnect.
So I have a big problem with that sort 

1579
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:26,030
of disconnect.
That's a problem.

1580
01:08:26,031 --> 01:08:28,190
I don't know this woman,
I don't know her.

1581
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:29,320
Um,
I,

1582
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:30,163
I believe,
I believe what she says about Harvey 

1583
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,493
Weinstein.
Uh,

1584
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:34,940
and again,
you know,

1585
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:35,774
people are like,
well she went back to the scene of the 

1586
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:37,304
crime that's very common,
but don't sign a petition and then now 

1587
01:08:40,251 --> 01:08:43,190
be this leading voice in this whole,
you know,

1588
01:08:43,191 --> 01:08:46,610
anti harassment.
I think it's very inconsistent.

1589
01:08:46,611 --> 01:08:48,560
I think you have to pay,
you have to at least answer to that.

1590
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:51,770
Did she comment on once she saw there 
was a mia culpa there,

1591
01:08:51,771 --> 01:08:55,010
but it's very inconsistent in it and 
there's a lot of that out there.

1592
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,500
There's a lot of that we should make 
sure that she definitely did that.

1593
01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:00,240
You'll see it.
Just see if you can go the young dreamy.

1594
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,460
It feels like something that,
you know,

1595
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,730
I looked it up,
I actually looked it up.

1596
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,160
I wanted to see who had signed the 
petition.

1597
01:09:07,161 --> 01:09:09,080
I came across her name and I was like,
whoa.

1598
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:11,900
That doesn't make any sense to me.
You know,

1599
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,460
it just doesn't make any sense,
man.

1600
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:19,680
I don't get it.
I don't know enough about what happened.

1601
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:24,470
I know that he drugged in some younger 
girl.

1602
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:29,500
She was 13 and her mom dropped her off.
I believe it was there.

1603
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,860
It was the seventies men,
people would just relationship every bit

1604
01:09:33,861 --> 01:09:35,710
of 20,
all that shit the year.

1605
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,310
Um,
man,

1606
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:38,293
but I believe he knew she was 13.
Then he knew he was going to go away to 

1607
01:09:41,151 --> 01:09:46,151
jail and he left the country to Jesus 
Christ and say.

1608
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,080
And then apparently there's another 
woman that he had done that too.

1609
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:55,010
So imagine being on the scene back then.

1610
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,113
How weird that must have been.
Like there had been like think about 

1611
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:00,043
Roman Polanski,
making movies and like what the 19 

1612
01:10:01,551 --> 01:10:02,390
seventies,
right?

1613
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:04,370
Yeah.
I mean God trying to town.

1614
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:05,660
It's only only days.
Yeah.

1615
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:06,494
Amazing.
But they'd only been making movies for 

1616
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:10,970
like a few decades.
It was a real new thing.

1617
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:14,060
She signed the petition,
but I found a tweet she just put,

1618
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:16,880
she put out a couple months ago where 
she said she regretted doing it.

1619
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:19,400
Already.
Regretted the signing the petition years

1620
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,590
ago.
She said a mistake robin plants.

1621
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:23,690
He's a filmmaker whose work at meijer 
greatly,

1622
01:10:23,691 --> 01:10:26,270
but if I ever see him,
I'll spit in his face if he's lucky.

1623
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,520
Yeah.
But you signed petition already.

1624
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:31,940
Regretted signing the petition years ago
already felt it was a mistake.

1625
01:10:31,941 --> 01:10:32,774
No excuses.
It was stupid with this indicates a 

1626
01:10:34,321 --> 01:10:35,154
pattern of behavior that if true and I 
believe it to be true is beyond 

1627
01:10:38,301 --> 01:10:39,140
unforgivable.

1628
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:40,183
Well,
I think,

1629
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:44,020
I think you,
you got a good point though about you.

1630
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,673
She made a mistake in there is something
that happens to people that have been 

1631
01:10:48,501 --> 01:10:50,720
violated.
Sometimes they blame themselves.

1632
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:51,583
That's what I said.
So I'm paying for that and there could 

1633
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:56,310
be a little of that in her decision 
making process to.

1634
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:59,630
I can't.
I could be a little bit of wanting to be

1635
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:01,070
in with Hollywood,
you know,

1636
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:03,860
that's not ethically or morally 
consistent.

1637
01:11:03,861 --> 01:11:04,694
No.
And she fucked up and she realized she 

1638
01:11:05,721 --> 01:11:07,850
fucked up.
But you're also coming after people now,

1639
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,780
you know,
if we're gonna,

1640
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,633
if we,
we're going to end and a lot of these 

1641
01:11:11,751 --> 01:11:14,880
people you know,
deserve to become after.

1642
01:11:14,881 --> 01:11:17,010
But you know,
we have to be consistent here.

1643
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:19,200
Right?
But isn't she begins being consistent by

1644
01:11:19,201 --> 01:11:21,870
just saying that she fucked up and she 
realized that she fucked up.

1645
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:22,704
Well,
there are a lot of people are saying 

1646
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:24,063
that once they get caught,
well that petition the petition doesn't 

1647
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:27,870
mean Jack Shit.
They ain't letting him.

1648
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:30,500
He doesn't matter.
He signed it and it was at.

1649
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,153
I don't know anybody that would sign 
that and like I would never sign that 

1650
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:34,890
petition.
That's all I'm trying to say.

1651
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:35,873
Being consistent if I'm.
So if the guy came to America and got 

1652
01:11:40,471 --> 01:11:44,460
arrested and went through the trial and 
then got convicted,

1653
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:47,250
how much time would you do?
I don't know.

1654
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:54,380
What's interesting is like would it be 
better karmically to go to jail for what

1655
01:11:57,001 --> 01:11:59,250
he did come back,
go to jail and then no one.

1656
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,510
Everyone would always know.
When you got out that you were convicted

1657
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:06,960
and you were punished for child 
molestation,

1658
01:12:06,961 --> 01:12:09,660
like you did it and they got you.
Everyone would know.

1659
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:10,523
Whereas now he's living in France and he
has to deal with it floating over his 

1660
01:12:14,311 --> 01:12:15,144
head.
Everyone who meets me knows that I 

1661
01:12:16,861 --> 01:12:21,861
drugged and raped a kid everywhere I go.
Everyone knows a drugged and raped a kid

1662
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:26,640
and it just keeps playing out in his 
head all day long.

1663
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:28,910
Public shaming is powerful shit.
Well,

1664
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:31,000
I mean that's the highest level.
Yes,

1665
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:35,070
this is drugging and raping a kid.
I'm a forgiving guy.

1666
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:36,510
Can't figure that one.
I.

1667
01:12:36,511 --> 01:12:39,030
I can't like.
I'm a forgiving dude,

1668
01:12:39,031 --> 01:12:39,864
man.
I can't stay mad and I think it's good 

1669
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:42,630
to be forgiving about things.

1670
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:45,240
There are certain things that to me when
you,

1671
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:47,910
and he's a great filmmaker and a great 
artist for me,

1672
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:50,550
that kind of stuff.
It's very difficult,

1673
01:12:50,551 --> 01:12:52,860
man.
It's very difficult.

1674
01:12:52,861 --> 01:12:53,694
I had an argument with a bunch of older 
actors about this and they were all 

1675
01:12:56,221 --> 01:12:58,980
saying it was a long time ago.
She looked up and I was like,

1676
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,340
if it was your daughter and she was 13,
how would you feel?

1677
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:04,640
You just got to keep going back to that.
Well,

1678
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:06,540
especially if you actually have a 
daughter,

1679
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:07,613
you actually have a daughter that's not.
You're not conceptualizing that your 

1680
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,270
gut.
It actually locked into your brain.

1681
01:13:12,271 --> 01:13:13,104
You're actually thinking about your 
daughter and it becomes a different 

1682
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:18,420
completely different thing.
I remember thinking when I was young,

1683
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:19,560
you know?
Yeah.

1684
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,260
If someone did that to my daughter,
but then it was like before I had a kid,

1685
01:13:22,261 --> 01:13:23,094
it was like,
that was just a weird concept that 

1686
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:26,910
didn't seem real.

1687
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:29,730
But now you think about this 13 year old
girl and you're like,

1688
01:13:29,731 --> 01:13:30,564
whoa.
But what a court would do and what a 

1689
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:36,420
trial would do is you might hear 
something like,

1690
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,520
I don't know,
but you might hear.

1691
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,590
I don't know.
She said,

1692
01:13:40,591 --> 01:13:43,860
she said she was 20.
When we talk about drugging,

1693
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:45,420
hold on.
She smoked a little weed that,

1694
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,790
that guy gave her over there.
Let's be careful.

1695
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:48,624
Right then.
Then you start hearing all the 

1696
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:53,220
extenuating circumstances and maybe you 
would go,

1697
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,193
you got to do the time,
but at least I get how that happened 

1698
01:13:56,911 --> 01:13:58,410
because you thought it was something 
different.

1699
01:13:58,411 --> 01:13:59,940
Right?
What was your intention?

1700
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,130
What did you see?
But we don't know that.

1701
01:14:02,131 --> 01:14:04,740
So what happens is we start and we're 
doing this too,

1702
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:05,880
and I'm doing it.
I don't know.

1703
01:14:05,881 --> 01:14:07,180
I don't know all the details of the 
case.

1704
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:08,014
So.
And all I'm saying is that he drugged 

1705
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:12,040
and sodomized a 13 year old.
Here's goal that everyone

1706
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,210
was drugged,
him included.

1707
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:14,830
Well,
there's this what I'm saying,

1708
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:15,664
so we all have to be,
we all have to be careful and I have to 

1709
01:14:17,431 --> 01:14:17,901
two,
because I'm,

1710
01:14:17,901 --> 01:14:20,440
I'm kind of breaking my own rule here.
I'm,

1711
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,990
I'm drawing these very strong,
hardened fast,

1712
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:25,943
uh,
like there's no context and what I'm 

1713
01:14:27,341 --> 01:14:29,440
saying,
there's no nuance in what I'm saying.

1714
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:30,910
There's no context.
Right?

1715
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:31,953
And you got to be careful because 
everything is nuanced and context in a 

1716
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:35,014
way otherwise otherwise you.
Otherwise you're taking me at just the 

1717
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:40,430
words I'm saying.
So what I'm seeing from this,

1718
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:43,450
this is like she's upset and you're 
upset.

1719
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:46,360
Like she's upset.
She signed it and Europe said she signed

1720
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:47,194
it.
But that doesn't mean nearly as much to 

1721
01:14:49,661 --> 01:14:50,494
me.
Like people making a mistake like her 

1722
01:14:52,151 --> 01:14:55,240
making that mistake doesn't mean much to
me.

1723
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,250
It's just a mistake.
It doesn't give it.

1724
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,600
I'm not going to have the thing,
you know,

1725
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,860
there's,
there's no consequences.

1726
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:02,170
No one got hurt because of that mistake.
You know what I'm saying?

1727
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,970
Like it was a mistake.
She fucked up,

1728
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:08,050
but it didn't ultimately hurt anyone.
Like it doesn't.

1729
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:08,973
I don't like the fact that someone would
at least temporarily have that thought 

1730
01:15:11,801 --> 01:15:13,300
in their mind like,
that guy should be free,

1731
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,830
like leave him alone.
What's bygones be bygones.

1732
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:17,800
Actually talking about something 
different.

1733
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,050
What are you talking about?
So I'm talking about.dot

1734
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,810
Hollywood tends to do.
I was just using her as an example.

1735
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,840
Hollywood tends to do that which is 
popular,

1736
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,513
that which is going to make them liked 
rather than something that's morally or 

1737
01:15:31,061 --> 01:15:33,170
ethically consistent.
That's what I mean.

1738
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,593
We've talked about this before,
that it all comes down to the whole 

1739
01:15:36,311 --> 01:15:40,720
process of being chosen to do things 
with being chosen to direct or chosen to

1740
01:15:40,721 --> 01:15:41,554
act or chosen.

1741
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:43,630
Everybody's constantly working to be 
chosen.

1742
01:15:43,631 --> 01:15:45,460
You're all trying to audition for 
things.

1743
01:15:45,461 --> 01:15:47,950
We're trying to angle to get a certain 
role.

1744
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:50,260
It's a constant process of like me,
like me,

1745
01:15:50,261 --> 01:15:53,950
like me and these are people that go 
into this job with his yearning,

1746
01:15:53,951 --> 01:15:54,784
desire to be loved and then on top of 
that they're playing this weird 

1747
01:15:57,491 --> 01:15:58,600
political game.
I mean,

1748
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:00,700
acting is all political.
I mean,

1749
01:16:00,701 --> 01:16:01,534
it doesn't make any sense that every 
other occupation except maybe tech 

1750
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:09,130
tech's probably like mostly mostly 
liberal,

1751
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:10,383
but Hollywood is almost exclusively 
liberal and if you step out of those 

1752
01:16:13,121 --> 01:16:14,360
lines,
nobody wants to work with you anyway.

1753
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,273
Hollywood on the surface is liberal,
but actually nobody who's conservative 

1754
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,350
or whatever will speak out.
Right.

1755
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,900
Like Tim Allen lost his show because 
he's.

1756
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:25,300
Because he's conservative.
He's an old white guy.

1757
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:26,720
What are you expect?
Well,

1758
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,970
white guys.
Yeah,

1759
01:16:27,971 --> 01:16:28,990
that's apparently golf.

1760
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:30,363
Probably a very real thing nowadays.
I started hanging out with Dennis 

1761
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:34,870
Miller.
Same thing.

1762
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:38,690
He went fucking James.
James Woods is crazy.

1763
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,660
James Woods is arguing with people on 
twitter.

1764
01:16:40,661 --> 01:16:42,040
Like James,
you're 70 years old.

1765
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:43,450
Crazy.
How many days you got left?

1766
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:44,493
How many?
How many moments in your life do you 

1767
01:16:46,241 --> 01:16:47,830
really have left?
Do you have a thousand?

1768
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:48,641
Like,
what are you going to do?

1769
01:16:48,641 --> 01:16:50,230
You're gonna waste.
400 of them on twitter.

1770
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,560
Yeah.
That's not wise.

1771
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,473
That's not a wise lady.
Said he was blackballed for his 

1772
01:16:53,621 --> 01:16:56,740
conservative views.
What is he really?

1773
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:57,880
I don't know.
Yeah,

1774
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,860
I don't know.
I don't know man.

1775
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,510
I don't want to.
Again,

1776
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,070
I don't want to be,
um,

1777
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,320
I don't know if I'm being helpful.
Right?

1778
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:08,260
So.
Well,

1779
01:17:08,261 --> 01:17:10,970
so you know,
you call out certain people.

1780
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:11,833
Are you talking about the inconsistency 
is most people are doing the best they 

1781
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:16,640
can and trying to make the world a 
better place.

1782
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,473
Right?
So I think most people would just look 

1783
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:23,380
rolling downhill in a hamster wheel.
He thinks,

1784
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:25,400
I'm trying to figure out how to stop 
this fucking thing.

1785
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,353
Yeah.
Most people are just on full on 

1786
01:17:27,711 --> 01:17:28,544
momentum.
Most people are definitely not thinking 

1787
01:17:30,051 --> 01:17:31,850
about how to be,
make the world a better place.

1788
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:32,863
Occasionally people think of that.
What they try to think is how do I get 

1789
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:38,420
buy number one?
Then how do I get better?

1790
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:40,220
How do I get ahead?
Number two,

1791
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,860
those are the things they think of and 
occasionally what's going on?

1792
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,230
What's up it over there?
Yeah.

1793
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,313
Fucking trump.
And then they go back to work until you 

1794
01:17:47,421 --> 01:17:48,750
can do sometimes.
Yeah.

1795
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,530
Most people,
that's most people like James Woods.

1796
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:53,630
It's like Jesus James,
I get it,

1797
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:55,970
but you're not changing hearts and minds
on twitter.

1798
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:59,980
While the funny shit though sometimes I 
was going to say like funny guy,

1799
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:02,160
the biggest thing is like,
you know,

1800
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,940
are you,
it's really hard to persuade anybody.

1801
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:08,900
It's fucking like I was thinking about 
why would the times I've changed my mind

1802
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:12,320
hard to change my mind was I never 
changed it in an argument.

1803
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:13,711
Change it.
Yeah,

1804
01:18:13,711 --> 01:18:15,470
right.
I changed it in a conversation.

1805
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,800
I don't mind changing my mind.
I think that's important too.

1806
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:19,800
You know,
and I've,

1807
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,160
I've changed my mind before and people 
got mad at me,

1808
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:24,830
bro.
You change your mind like,

1809
01:18:24,831 --> 01:18:26,060
yeah,
I changed my mind.

1810
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,920
I learned some new stuff and then went,
oh,

1811
01:18:27,921 --> 01:18:31,040
okay,
I can't defend this old idea and I'm not

1812
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:32,600
an idea.
Stupid.

1813
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:34,070
The first.
What's the,

1814
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,880
what's the first rule?
And being a scientist doubt,

1815
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:37,753
uh,
ignorance.

1816
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:38,623
You don't know anything and then you,
you make sure that you're responsive to 

1817
01:18:41,991 --> 01:18:42,824
the evidence and then if you,
even if you build up a whole reputation 

1818
01:18:45,591 --> 01:18:46,424
on your conclusion,
you have to be willing to change or 

1819
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:50,540
conclusion based upon new evidence.

1820
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:53,150
And you have to,
you have a finished product.

1821
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,201
Yeah,
exactly.

1822
01:18:54,201 --> 01:18:55,220
Your finished product.
Oh,

1823
01:18:55,221 --> 01:18:56,390
it's amazing.
You're a verb.

1824
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:57,730
Yeah,
well I'm.

1825
01:18:57,810 --> 01:18:59,990
I'm definitely smarter than I was three 
months ago.

1826
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:00,953
It's different person to.
How about how about the differences in 

1827
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:06,230
you when you were 28 and now it's a 
human person.

1828
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:07,970
Yeah,
totally different human.

1829
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,493
Yeah,
but that raises an interesting question 

1830
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:13,220
too,
so okay,

1831
01:19:13,221 --> 01:19:15,530
you're a very different person.
What if you did something awful?

1832
01:19:15,531 --> 01:19:17,470
Then let's maybe murder and now you're 
in.

1833
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,590
Should they let you go?
Right,

1834
01:19:18,591 --> 01:19:21,320
and now at 51,
I'm so different than when I was 21.

1835
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:23,540
I don't remember that.
I was such a moron.

1836
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:24,583
I was a moron at 30.
I remember feeling that awkward lack of 

1837
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:29,264
control I had for myself,
like feeling how awkward it was and we 

1838
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:32,863
wishing I had more composure.
I remember actively feeling that at 21 

1839
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:36,943
that it was so impulsive and so crazy 
and I wished I was more composed and I 

1840
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:42,620
would see people that had their shit 
together and I would really admire them.

1841
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:45,800
I look at that guy all composed and shit
dressed nice,

1842
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,910
knows what to say when not to say it.
Meanwhile,

1843
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:50,720
blurt things out that I should never 
say.

1844
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:52,010
How about the way you look?
Like do.

1845
01:19:52,011 --> 01:19:52,844
I was thinking about the way I looked at
certain things like women and their 

1846
01:19:55,311 --> 01:19:58,020
capabilities when I was a young man.
I did.

1847
01:19:58,190 --> 01:19:59,023
You know,
it changed me in looking at women in in 

1848
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:04,520
a different light,
the UFC and having children with a woman

1849
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,540
and watching how good she wasn't raising
kids and all the things that that takes,

1850
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:10,523
that's a certain type of strength and 
then watching women like paige vanzant 

1851
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:14,664
fight three rounds with a broken arm 
that that was all something that I 

1852
01:20:17,761 --> 01:20:18,594
didn't think belonged.
That was an arena I was not aware of 

1853
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:21,684
that kind of feminine strength or 
fortitude or whatever you want to call 

1854
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:26,010
it.

1855
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:30,480
It causes me to look at that gender 
differently than I did before.

1856
01:20:30,481 --> 01:20:33,480
So in a lot of ways I'm a different 
person and as you get older,

1857
01:20:33,481 --> 01:20:36,480
that's what happens.
You see the world differently as you are

1858
01:20:36,481 --> 01:20:41,481
exposed to more data and exposed to more
and different paradigms and examples and

1859
01:20:42,391 --> 01:20:44,280
I think that's a good thing.
It is a good thing.

1860
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:45,750
It's also,
it's ridiculous.

1861
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:46,663
The female male debate back and forth is
ridiculous because people vary so much 

1862
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:54,150
inside those groups that for someone to 
say,

1863
01:20:54,151 --> 01:20:54,984
all women do this,
women are all thinking this will be 

1864
01:20:56,741 --> 01:20:57,181
like,
no,

1865
01:20:57,181 --> 01:20:59,040
no,
that doesn't make any sense.

1866
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:01,950
That's just as stupid as saying,
men do moon all dues.

1867
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:03,600
All mandus.
No,

1868
01:21:03,601 --> 01:21:04,290
no,
that's not.

1869
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:06,630
That doesn't make any sense.
What it fucking human beings.

1870
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:07,493
There's a great number of men that do 
this stupid thing and a great number of 

1871
01:21:10,171 --> 01:21:11,004
women that say this annoying thing is a 
great number of people that are just 

1872
01:21:14,461 --> 01:21:15,810
looking to skate by in this life.

1873
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:18,150
Men and women,
because a great number of dummies,

1874
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:21,180
there's a great number of really 
inspirational,

1875
01:21:21,181 --> 01:21:22,014
fantastic people that also have vaginas.
There's a lot of them had really smart 

1876
01:21:25,801 --> 01:21:26,634
ones that blow your mind in a 
conversation and they just happen to be 

1877
01:21:29,401 --> 01:21:30,234
female and there's a lot of them that 
are just happened to be male and they 

1878
01:21:32,811 --> 01:21:33,644
they.
That male who happens to be fucking 

1879
01:21:35,401 --> 01:21:36,234
brilliant and articulate and mindblowing
has almost no fucking relation to some 

1880
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,480
idiot shithead.
Ditch digger asshole.

1881
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:46,363
Yeah.
Which nothing wrong with taking digital 

1882
01:21:47,221 --> 01:21:48,054
folks.
Just don't dig ditches if you're an 

1883
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:50,400
asshole.
Trying to be.

1884
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:51,533
No,
but it's also like if one of the things 

1885
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:53,334
I noticed,
you have a lot of people from different 

1886
01:21:53,881 --> 01:21:56,140
backgrounds.
You got to Nigeria in this corner,

1887
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,380
you've got Pakistan in that corner,
you've got China in that corner,

1888
01:21:58,381 --> 01:21:59,214
you've got fucking America.
You got a white guy from Iowa when they 

1889
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:02,184
all have to get food out to a group of 
people in a restaurant or they gotta 

1890
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,650
figure out a way to run a business 
together.

1891
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:09,900
All that shit didn't.
Nobody has time for that shit.

1892
01:22:09,901 --> 01:22:11,670
Everybody's kind of working toward a 
common goal.

1893
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:14,010
Nobody has time.
If you actually have something important

1894
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:15,620
to deal with when you don't have 
something important to do,

1895
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,473
start looking at like weird shit.
Like I fucking hate ginger's Ginger's 

1896
01:22:20,461 --> 01:22:21,294
role.
The devil.

1897
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:24,330
Now you start looking at things 
different.

1898
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:27,210
You know,
you start looking at the differences and

1899
01:22:27,211 --> 01:22:29,860
getting annoyed with stupid shit.
Yup.

1900
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:31,650
Yeah.
I think all human beings,

1901
01:22:31,651 --> 01:22:34,140
just like your son have a physical 
requirement.

1902
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:37,530
There is a bond requirement that we all 
have with each other.

1903
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,470
There's a love requirement that we all 
have with each other.

1904
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:41,603
We have to get a certain amount of love.
You've got to have a certain amount of 

1905
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:44,004
bonding and comradery with the people 
around you and these needs should be 

1906
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:48,623
legit,
like they give you like a vitamin C 

1907
01:22:50,041 --> 01:22:50,630
chart.

1908
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:53,190
USD,
a recommended daily allowance of Vitamin

1909
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:54,023
C.
is this recommended daily allowance of 

1910
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:58,380
iron?
Is that like all that stuff is important

1911
01:22:58,500 --> 01:22:59,333
for your body?
I think you have an equally important 

1912
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:04,740
requirement for your.
Your mind?

1913
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:05,713
Yes,
and for just your physical being like 

1914
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:12,560
not necessarily your body in terms of 
like nutrition but just love and warmth.

1915
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:13,403
Like the human touch,
you know the babies will die if you 

1916
01:23:15,221 --> 01:23:15,940
don't touch them,
right?

1917
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:17,470
Yeah.
It was called failure to thrive.

1918
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:20,530
So in hospitals when they have babies 
that don't have parents,

1919
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,840
they have people that come around and 
hold the babies.

1920
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:26,410
She's not held.
You can feed the baby and everything.

1921
01:23:26,411 --> 01:23:28,480
If the baby's not held,
the baby will die.

1922
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:29,643
Fuck,
I have to be touched by another human 

1923
01:23:31,091 --> 01:23:32,010
being.
A baby has to.

1924
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:34,480
Yeah.
It's like water or food.

1925
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:38,280
That's a fucking requirement.
And I think that this,

1926
01:23:38,281 --> 01:23:39,114
this is being violated in schools when 
you teach in little kids with tons of 

1927
01:23:42,491 --> 01:23:43,324
energy and the way they cope with that 
violation is give those kids medication 

1928
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:49,630
that makes them conform and we just 
accept that.

1929
01:23:49,810 --> 01:23:50,643
And then people get on anti anxiety 
medication and people get on all this 

1930
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:53,944
medication,
that medication and how many of these 

1931
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:55,864
medications are clearly described 
because your life sucks or prescribed 

1932
01:23:59,231 --> 01:24:01,390
rather because your life sucks.
How many of them is it?

1933
01:24:01,391 --> 01:24:03,580
Half?
Is it 30 percent?

1934
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:04,503
Like what number of people actually have
something wrong with their brain and 

1935
01:24:06,671 --> 01:24:07,504
what number of people have something 
wrong with their brain because their 

1936
01:24:08,741 --> 01:24:09,790
life sucks,
right?

1937
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:14,680
God dammit.
I hate going over this same subject over

1938
01:24:14,681 --> 01:24:17,550
and over again because it's just so.
Well,

1939
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:21,160
it's hard to hard to come up with 
answers because it all depends.

1940
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,380
It's drilling.
I was talking to Andy Galpin about that.

1941
01:24:23,381 --> 01:24:24,214
I was like,
well,

1942
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,150
uh,
is,

1943
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:28,360
is this vitamin good for you or is this 
supplement could fee or is this.

1944
01:24:28,361 --> 01:24:29,860
I was showing him stuff I take and he 
goes,

1945
01:24:29,861 --> 01:24:32,920
it depends.
It just depends on your body.

1946
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,530
It depends on what you're.
What are you doing with your body,

1947
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,370
what,
what is,

1948
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:40,090
what is your routine like on a daily,
on a weekly basis,

1949
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:42,160
what kind of stresses you putting your 
body on?

1950
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,810
Some things work,
some things don't.

1951
01:24:43,811 --> 01:24:46,180
There is no clear cut,
single variable answer.

1952
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:47,133
It's just so fascinating that all of our
bodies have different requirements 

1953
01:24:49,571 --> 01:24:52,150
because we literally developed in 
different parts of the world.

1954
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:56,050
I know and scooted over here in a boat.
Started fucking each other.

1955
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:57,311
Oh,
look at you.

1956
01:24:57,311 --> 01:24:58,144
Allergic to cats.
Like all just weird things that stuck 

1957
01:25:01,811 --> 01:25:02,644
with us.
I do better with goat dairy and me too 

1958
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:08,740
and I do with Mediterranean than I do 
with Holstein cow dairy dude.

1959
01:25:08,741 --> 01:25:10,000
My daughter,
when she was little,

1960
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:11,860
she would throw up if she drank cow's 
milk,

1961
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:14,740
but she would drink goat's milk and 
she'd have no problem with it at all.

1962
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:16,150
Yeah,
it's weird.

1963
01:25:16,151 --> 01:25:17,650
Ben,
like human dairy.

1964
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,020
Well,
do you fuck with raw milk at all?

1965
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:21,011
Yeah,
I used to,

1966
01:25:21,011 --> 01:25:24,040
but not anymore.
I'll fuck with raw goat milk.

1967
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:25,323
I can't do raw milk.
A cow would rather get raw goat milk 

1968
01:25:27,881 --> 01:25:28,714
because first of all,
do they treat goats the way they treat 

1969
01:25:30,971 --> 01:25:33,310
cows?
I figure if you're running goats,

1970
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:34,493
you probably like a little bit more 
animal friendly goat milk in the world 

1971
01:25:37,721 --> 01:25:42,721
from this amish from the Amish Shit.
It's which and creamy and delicious.

1972
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,433
Would you imagine?
Let's go on a limb here and guess would 

1973
01:25:47,261 --> 01:25:52,261
you imagine there's factory farming of 
goats like milking commercial large?

1974
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,010
Sure.
There is.

1975
01:25:54,011 --> 01:25:54,844
Like I get,
there's certain ultra pasteurized milk 

1976
01:25:56,351 --> 01:25:58,840
called Meyers that I get.
Sometimes it's really good,

1977
01:25:58,841 --> 01:26:01,160
but it's ultra pasteurized,
but I'm sure that's that.

1978
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:03,500
The problem is when you talk about 
factory farming,

1979
01:26:03,501 --> 01:26:04,070
here's the problem,

1980
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,440
right?
So we want consistency in our food.

1981
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:09,920
So you want to buy eggs and you,
when you go to buy a carton of eggs,

1982
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:13,870
you know they're going to cost a dollar 
50 or $2 and 50 or $3 and 50,

1983
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:14,713
whatever you,
you know that they're going to cost a 

1984
01:26:15,321 --> 01:26:16,154
certain amount.
You don't go to the store and one day 

1985
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:20,870
they're three slash 50 and the next day 
they're $12.

1986
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:21,883
And the reason for that is this,
that we figured out a way to create 

1987
01:26:25,701 --> 01:26:26,534
enough eggs so that there is enough of a
lot so that we can keep the price at a 

1988
01:26:29,901 --> 01:26:30,734
certain level.
The problem with if you had all these 

1989
01:26:33,351 --> 01:26:34,640
family farms.
Okay.

1990
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:35,503
Which I've always been a fan as I always
talk about family farms versus factory 

1991
01:26:38,301 --> 01:26:39,140
farms.
Awesome.

1992
01:26:39,141 --> 01:26:41,890
Brian never done a day of farming in my 
fucking life.

1993
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,690
Don't know anything about it,
but I done my reading.

1994
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:48,530
So here's Brian again with his point of 
view because he's read some stuff and he

1995
01:26:48,531 --> 01:26:50,960
likes eating at Erewhon and whole foods.
Okay.

1996
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:53,780
Because I can afford it.
So I like family.

1997
01:26:53,781 --> 01:26:56,300
I've,
I like family's family.

1998
01:26:56,301 --> 01:26:57,134
Farming is bad.
The problem is that if you look at the 

1999
01:27:00,771 --> 01:27:01,604
way farming it works is that some family
farms aren't as good as other family 

2000
01:27:06,681 --> 01:27:09,410
farms for a thousand reasons that is not
as productive,

2001
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,273
not as proficient.
So what would happen is that family 

2002
01:27:11,871 --> 01:27:12,950
would say,
hey bro,

2003
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,190
I know you're a chicken farmer too,
but you're not doing it right.

2004
01:27:16,191 --> 01:27:20,030
Let me buy your farm.
I'll buy your farm for 15 times.

2005
01:27:20,031 --> 01:27:21,980
What it's worth right now,
you need the money,

2006
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,713
but I'm going to secretly,
I know I'm going to make my money back 

2007
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:28,970
because I know how I knew how to do it 
better than that guy and then I do that.

2008
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,193
Now I get up,
I go and buy a machine that's actually 

2009
01:27:32,811 --> 01:27:35,360
faster and I go to the next form and I 
say,

2010
01:27:35,361 --> 01:27:36,194
hey bro,
you're not going to compete with me on 

2011
01:27:37,641 --> 01:27:39,380
the market anyway and you're not as 
good.

2012
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:43,010
Sell me your farm and what happens?
Is it going to go fuck you?

2013
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:48,370
Not because you're not a city slicker.
He's a farmer himself talking to.

2014
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:51,110
Don't like your attitude.
Hey Bro,

2015
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:54,110
my fucking phone.
I could give you a deal.

2016
01:27:54,111 --> 01:27:55,530
Come over here.
I could,

2017
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:56,740
I,
I not to make A.

2018
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:58,310
I know what you're saying.
What people.

2019
01:27:58,311 --> 01:28:02,000
The real problem with factory farm is 
the lack of moral standards,

2020
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:04,610
like when they shove these chickens,
these little boxes.

2021
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:05,593
And the other thing is we've adapted to 
the ecosystem that we operate under and 

2022
01:28:09,471 --> 01:28:12,660
the ecosystem that we operate under.
We get free food basically.

2023
01:28:12,661 --> 01:28:13,431
Yeah.
Not Free Food,

2024
01:28:13,431 --> 01:28:15,790
but a lot of protein.

2025
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:16,511
Yeah,
but it's,

2026
01:28:16,511 --> 01:28:17,344
it's everywhere.
The food is just coming in and the eggs 

2027
01:28:18,831 --> 01:28:19,664
are everywhere,
so someone's got to be able to make all 

2028
01:28:21,411 --> 01:28:22,244
those eggs,
so we sort of develop these areas and 

2029
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:29,990
stacked them up with people based on the
idea that it's easy to get food here.

2030
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:32,360
It was really hard to get food here in 
the 18 hundreds.

2031
01:28:32,361 --> 01:28:34,460
It'd be 1500 people here,
right?

2032
01:28:34,461 --> 01:28:36,100
Yeah.
It would be like the desert,

2033
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:36,993
but as people desert people live there.
Some people that this little ranch here 

2034
01:28:40,101 --> 01:28:40,934
ranch there.
Why?

2035
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:43,190
Because there's no fucking food man or 
water.

2036
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:44,390
Yeah,
there's not a lot there.

2037
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:45,920
It's a desert.
Right.

2038
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:46,783
So because of the fact that we figured 
out how to be able to feed all these 

2039
01:28:50,181 --> 01:28:51,670
millions and millions and millions of 
people's.

2040
01:28:51,671 --> 01:28:52,231
Yeah.
Yeah.

2041
01:28:52,231 --> 01:28:55,310
Well in this one little spot like la in 
particular where no one's growing,

2042
01:28:55,311 --> 01:28:56,144
shit,
everything shoved in there in terms of 

2043
01:28:57,921 --> 01:28:59,960
humans and they're just pumping eggs in 
there left and right.

2044
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:02,250
Yeah.
They've sort populated that place

2045
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,720
based on this ridiculous idea of the 
access to meet.

2046
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:08,820
It's not a ridiculous idea.
It's actually a reality.

2047
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:09,511
Right,
right.

2048
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:12,540
But then people come along and they see 
a peta video and then they go,

2049
01:29:12,541 --> 01:29:14,250
hey,
but you still want to live here,

2050
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,840
so while you're going to have to go 
vegan then,

2051
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:17,100
well guess what?
If you do that,

2052
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,113
they're going to have to chop down a lot
of fucking trees and start growing food 

2053
01:29:19,981 --> 01:29:20,814
everywhere.
They're going to have to put it 

2054
01:29:21,361 --> 01:29:23,040
everywhere.
All these people are going to be Vegan,

2055
01:29:23,490 --> 01:29:24,323
all 2 million in this town and 6 million
in the neighborhood town and then $20 

2056
01:29:28,611 --> 01:29:29,444
million in la.
A lot of agricultural runoff and 

2057
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:32,583
pollution.
You're going to have a lot of fucking 

2058
01:29:33,631 --> 01:29:34,464
shit go into the ground.
You're going to have a lot of combines 

2059
01:29:36,001 --> 01:29:40,140
chewing up rabbits and rats,
ground nesting birds.

2060
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:42,960
Everything's.
Everything's going to get buzzed up.

2061
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,470
When you gathering up all that grain,
you're going to need to feed all those 2

2062
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:48,810
million people that don't have access to
animal protein anymore.

2063
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:50,370
That's not good either.
Right?

2064
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:53,850
We're fucked is what I'm saying.
You're giving up that easy.

2065
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:54,743
I give up.
I think technology is allowing us to 

2066
01:29:56,551 --> 01:29:59,580
grow more food on less land.
So that's true.

2067
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,710
I think I'm very hopeful for that.
Um,

2068
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:03,870
uh,
artificial meat,

2069
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:05,063
that meat,
they're growing very hopeful for that 

2070
01:30:06,661 --> 01:30:07,494
because if we could figure out a way to 
make it healthy to get that kind of 

2071
01:30:11,251 --> 01:30:12,084
meat,
you would still have population control 

2072
01:30:13,681 --> 01:30:16,500
problems and I think I would never stop 
hunting because of that.

2073
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:17,993
But it's,
it's meat without a central nervous 

2074
01:30:18,781 --> 01:30:21,240
system.
Eat without a central nervous system and

2075
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:25,410
we could probably,
if it's done and it really works.

2076
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:26,273
I mean there's a lot of ifs there,
but we could probably eliminate most of 

2077
01:30:28,981 --> 01:30:29,850
the factory farming.

2078
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:32,280
The real problem would be like,
what would you do with all those cows?

2079
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:35,250
What do you do with the cows now?
They would die off and then you wouldn't

2080
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,740
have,
but you don't want them to go extinct,

2081
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:38,993
you know,
have some cows because there'll be 

2082
01:30:39,661 --> 01:30:40,494
people who it'd be a whole marketplace 
of eating meat with the central nervous 

2083
01:30:46,051 --> 01:30:47,220
system.
Just watch,

2084
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:49,130
I'll do it.
Definitely is natural.

2085
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:52,700
We go back to the.
There's always going to be a marketplace

2086
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:56,730
for eating food as it quote unquote 
occurred naturally.

2087
01:30:56,731 --> 01:30:59,680
Which of course Holstein cows are not 
[inaudible].

2088
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:02,220
The other thing I was going to get to 
the problem with letting them go,

2089
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:03,413
if we ever let them go,
they morph sort of like the same way 

2090
01:31:05,851 --> 01:31:06,684
pigs morph.
They become this thing called scrub 

2091
01:31:07,981 --> 01:31:09,150
bulls.
You ever heard of scrub bowls?

2092
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:11,400
It's a really,
uh,

2093
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,550
it's really popular.
Especially in Australia.

2094
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:18,270
They're wild cattle cattle really broken
through fences and lived many,

2095
01:31:18,271 --> 01:31:21,150
many generations in the wild men.
The males are super aggressive.

2096
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:22,980
Very dangerous.
Jamie,

2097
01:31:22,981 --> 01:31:23,791
let me see.
Yeah,

2098
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:25,470
they're dangerous.
Is Fuck enormous.

2099
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,560
Enormous bull.
They're not afraid of lions.

2100
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:29,340
Afraid of water buffalo.
They can climb a tree.

2101
01:31:29,341 --> 01:31:31,020
When you see a water buffalo.
Well,

2102
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:31,943
my friend Adam Green tree who shot that 
buffalo above the flag and I'm in the 

2103
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,880
north lands.
That's a scrub bull.

2104
01:31:41,881 --> 01:31:42,714
So you see how weird that thing looks?
It looks weird because it's probably 

2105
01:31:45,391 --> 01:31:46,920
lived in the wild for many,
many,

2106
01:31:46,921 --> 01:31:49,380
many generations.
They're huge.

2107
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:51,420
Look at the size of the sack on him.
Dude,

2108
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:54,540
look at his sack and look at his hog.
Holy Shit.

2109
01:31:54,541 --> 01:31:55,380
Things.
No joke.

2110
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:59,820
That thing is laying pipe all day.
Just just banging all these cows

2111
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:01,083
did.
They're enormous wild cows and they're 

2112
01:32:03,041 --> 01:32:06,610
very aggressive.
The males in particular will fuck you up

2113
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:09,130
because they're not steers.
Right?

2114
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:11,470
There are bowls.
When we're getting steak,

2115
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:14,770
you're getting steak most of the time 
from a a steers and animal.

2116
01:32:14,771 --> 01:32:16,540
They cut the balls off of it when it's 
young.

2117
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:20,080
These are full as bowls with the muscles
on that.

2118
01:32:20,081 --> 01:32:24,070
That animal look at the size of that.
That thing's huge.

2119
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,790
Jesus.
Yeah.

2120
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:29,110
These are big fucking wild bulls.
You know,

2121
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,150
what does that weigh?
Eighteen hundred pounds or some shit.

2122
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:32,650
Oh Man.
Fuck.

2123
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:34,803
So that would happen in America.
You got to recognize that if people 

2124
01:32:37,331 --> 01:32:42,160
stopped having domestic cattle and they 
just let those cattle roam through,

2125
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,233
you would have a devastating impact on 
the ecosystem just like you have with 

2126
01:32:45,971 --> 01:32:48,100
wild pigs.
It would be similar.

2127
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:49,323
You'd have one.
You have those cows would all be 

2128
01:32:50,921 --> 01:32:53,780
euthanized or they be eating and then 
maybe it's,

2129
01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:55,390
it's,
it's blinding the cows,

2130
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,333
but you'd have to have a certain 
population of them that we keep alive 

2131
01:32:58,361 --> 01:33:01,390
what it needed for milk,
you know,

2132
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:04,110
can milk them if they come up with 
artificial mill.

2133
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:05,323
Goddammit.
Joe.

2134
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:08,830
Fuck.
You're not really supposed to drink milk

2135
01:33:08,831 --> 01:33:09,550
though,
right?

2136
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:11,530
I mean not really,
but cheese is good.

2137
01:33:11,531 --> 01:33:12,670
Shit.
Is it though?

2138
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:15,430
I drink.
I cheese and I drink wine.

2139
01:33:15,431 --> 01:33:17,460
It doesn't make me feel good and I'm 
never stopping.

2140
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:21,190
How about that one does not make me feel
good until it goes in my mouth.

2141
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,490
The problem is if I,
if I like I was in that makeup chair and

2142
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:31,200
you drink in one I was doing now was 
puffy in the morning and I looked at the

2143
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:34,160
makeup woman and I said,
I think and I said,

2144
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:36,130
why?
Why am I so puffy in the morning?

2145
01:33:36,131 --> 01:33:38,240
And she goes,
are you drinking at nine ago?

2146
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:40,150
Every night?
She goes,

2147
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:41,380
well,
don't do that.

2148
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:42,573
If you have to shoot the next day,
you might not want to drink three 

2149
01:33:44,381 --> 01:33:48,130
glasses of wine because I get swollen.
Just drink it.

2150
01:33:48,770 --> 01:33:50,050
Yeah,
but I want to know.

2151
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:53,200
Do you want to look good?
Dairy reinvented,

2152
01:33:53,201 --> 01:33:55,000
sustainable kind.
Delicious.

2153
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:56,980
There you go.
Animal Free Milk.

2154
01:33:57,570 --> 01:34:00,760
I bet that thing gives.
You can lock it.

2155
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:04,930
Farts.
Farts that if you were at a a chair with

2156
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:06,600
wheels on it,
you could partner with.

2157
01:34:06,610 --> 01:34:08,200
Scoot you across a carpet.

2158
01:34:10,450 --> 01:34:12,170
I mean,
how could your body want?

2159
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,040
Digest that.
What's that stuff made outta?

2160
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:17,980
Give me some ingredients on Jamie.
Weird people are weird.

2161
01:34:18,010 --> 01:34:21,810
Milk Almond milk.
That's my favorite son.

2162
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:22,653
Even.
Yeah.

2163
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:25,960
There's no almond entities that's not 
almond milk.

2164
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:28,530
So whenever a joke like that,
that's someone's joked.

2165
01:34:28,531 --> 01:34:30,310
I just bite someone's joke.
I don't think so.

2166
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:32,393
The whole almond milk thing is so weird.
You're just soaking nuts and then 

2167
01:34:35,681 --> 01:34:37,710
getting the dirty water.
They know what it's like.

2168
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:38,663
It's like when you a eat coco pops 
cuckoo for cocoa puffs and you would 

2169
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:44,410
have that chocolate in there.
Would that be the chocolate?

2170
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:45,070
No.
Bottom.

2171
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:46,360
Press them.
God it.

2172
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:48,070
What are you talking about?
They stay,

2173
01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:49,870
they take the almonds,
they soak them,

2174
01:34:49,871 --> 01:34:50,920
they sprout them,
right,

2175
01:34:50,921 --> 01:34:52,210
but then they press them.
Right,

2176
01:34:52,211 --> 01:34:53,860
but that dirty water,
it's just water.

2177
01:34:53,870 --> 01:34:55,510
The almonds were soaking around it?
No,

2178
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:57,500
because they don't do it that way,
I don't think.

2179
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,010
I think

2180
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,410
the way they do it as they crushed the 
almonds after they've been.

2181
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:03,880
After they had been soaked,
they take the skin off and then they.

2182
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:05,063
They crushed them and then they mix it.
They crushed them and then they press 

2183
01:35:08,361 --> 01:35:11,050
them and it creates like a milky.
It's dirty water.

2184
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:16,070
I don't know what kind of fucking almond
factor when you're talking about bro.

2185
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,660
It's dirty.
Almond water.

2186
01:35:17,690 --> 01:35:22,400
What is your.
I'm genetically engineered yeast.

2187
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:23,390
What does,
what is this?

2188
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:25,890
This is.
What's the cellular ag?

2189
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,710
What?
Vegan milk.

2190
01:35:27,711 --> 01:35:29,030
It's called.
Oh my God.

2191
01:35:29,031 --> 01:35:30,620
The term genetically.
Wow.

2192
01:35:30,621 --> 01:35:35,621
The team used genetically engineered 
yeast to pro produce six key proteins.

2193
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:37,820
Oh God.
Damn motherfucker.

2194
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:38,863
Six key proteins that provide the 
texture and plants to harvest ate fatty 

2195
01:35:43,671 --> 01:35:47,390
acids that contribute to the flavor.
Finally they add sugars,

2196
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:49,220
minerals,
and water.

2197
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,110
Easy peasy.
It's sugar.

2198
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:55,120
With this straightforward recipe,
the composition can be modified to leave

2199
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:55,963
potentially harmful components such as 
cholesterol and hormones out of the 

2200
01:35:59,031 --> 01:35:59,864
equation.

2201
01:35:59,910 --> 01:36:03,950
Kind of lactose cholesterol by the way,
the building blocks of all cells.

2202
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:06,940
Yeah.
Isn't lack sugar.

2203
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:09,080
Google that back there.
Yeah,

2204
01:36:09,081 --> 01:36:10,340
they're putting sugar in there,
man,

2205
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:11,293
but they said they put sugars in it 
because otherwise it would taste like 

2206
01:36:13,371 --> 01:36:14,970
donkey piss.
Yeah.

2207
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,090
East.
By the way,

2208
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:19,670
east is a life form.
Where do you draw the line?

2209
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:22,970
Like if you're a Vegan and you're eating
yeast,

2210
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:23,893
you are eating a living thing.
You're eating a life form that if you 

2211
01:36:27,681 --> 01:36:29,810
didn't eat it,
it would replicate.

2212
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:32,560
It's not a plant.
It's a life form.

2213
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:35,810
[inaudible] like if you're.
If you're eating probiotics,

2214
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:37,760
like say if you're a Vegan,
you eating probiotics,

2215
01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:39,470
you are eating a little tiny light 
forms.

2216
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:40,933
That's what you're eating.
When you have fermented that you're 

2217
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:47,930
letting animals grow on your food and 
you're eating your food and the animals,

2218
01:36:47,931 --> 01:36:49,430
so like that's where I get my protein.

2219
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:51,920
You're eating animals,
you're eating little tiny,

2220
01:36:51,921 --> 01:36:53,510
tiny little animals.
I think one,

2221
01:36:53,511 --> 01:36:54,370
10,
10,

2222
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,960
nine out of 10 of your cells are not 
human.

2223
01:36:56,961 --> 01:36:59,870
They're bacteria.
Every cell of your body is made from it,

2224
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:00,853
and all of your steroid hormones,
hormones are synthesized from 

2225
01:37:03,741 --> 01:37:04,574
cholesterol,
including all of the sex and adrenal 

2226
01:37:06,501 --> 01:37:07,191
hormones.
Well,

2227
01:37:07,191 --> 01:37:08,570
you definitely don't want that in your 
body.

2228
01:37:08,571 --> 01:37:09,404
Then do you.
Why would you want something that's 

2229
01:37:10,941 --> 01:37:13,460
responsible for every fucking cell in 
your body?

2230
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:14,833
Like this idea that,
that diet is better for you is so 

2231
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:21,680
Goddamn cockamamie.
They're telling you that they're putting

2232
01:37:21,681 --> 01:37:24,860
in sugar so that it makes it palatable 
and taking you.

2233
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:25,813
You don't have to worry about that 
naughty cholesterol that's responsible 

2234
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:32,030
for every fucking cell in your body and 
your hormones.

2235
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:33,920
We don't want that.
Have it.

2236
01:37:34,430 --> 01:37:36,800
They're not even paying attention to 
science,

2237
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:37,820
but it's a belief system.

2238
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:38,330
It's not.
It's like,

2239
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:39,980
here's what it is though.
Here's where it gets weird.

2240
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:41,610
The,
this is,

2241
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:42,513
uh,
I also believe in many ways is a left 

2242
01:37:43,911 --> 01:37:48,911
right thing that the left believes in 
climate change science wholeheartedly,

2243
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,000
100 percent,
but does not believe in gender is gender

2244
01:37:53,001 --> 01:37:54,020
size.
No,

2245
01:37:54,021 --> 01:37:55,800
that's all bullshit.
If you,

2246
01:37:55,801 --> 01:37:59,100
if you,
if you talk about the difference between

2247
01:37:59,610 --> 01:38:02,950
male and female xy chromosomes,
they'll shut you down.

2248
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:05,890
Did you see bret Weinstein's,
his wife?

2249
01:38:05,891 --> 01:38:07,770
I heard they were hiring Eric Weinstein.
No,

2250
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:09,930
I'm his wife,
heather hiding.

2251
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:13,360
She was doing a speech,
uh,

2252
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:15,120
with James Demore.
Uh,

2253
01:38:15,121 --> 01:38:15,954
they were talking about gender diversity
and she's just talking about the 

2254
01:38:17,911 --> 01:38:20,580
difference between males and females.
From a scientist point of view.

2255
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:22,590
She's a,
she's a real biologist,

2256
01:38:22,591 --> 01:38:24,720
right?
People get up and screaming.

2257
01:38:24,721 --> 01:38:26,310
They're shutting her down there,
walking out.

2258
01:38:26,311 --> 01:38:29,280
They knocked over the sound system.
They called her a fascist.

2259
01:38:29,330 --> 01:38:31,020
Oh,
he said he's a Nazi.

2260
01:38:31,850 --> 01:38:34,320
You're against science,
but it's amazing.

2261
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:35,850
It's amazing.
So dumb.

2262
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:38,940
But it's this thing,
this left right thing to.

2263
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,650
It's right.
It's like the left.

2264
01:38:40,651 --> 01:38:44,640
Once you do 100 percent buy into 
whatever science they accept,

2265
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:50,150
but also they don't buy into a lot of 
shit that just doesn't fit with whatever

2266
01:38:50,581 --> 01:38:51,414
their ideology I left.
Isn't the cultural purity the far 

2267
01:38:53,881 --> 01:38:55,650
right's into racial period?
Yeah,

2268
01:38:55,651 --> 01:38:57,930
but it was the denial of sciences and 
new thing.

2269
01:38:58,380 --> 01:38:59,213
Yes.
It's denial of science was just not a 

2270
01:39:00,391 --> 01:39:03,660
part of the left.
The left was always pro science posted,

2271
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:07,350
supposedly pro science that the idea was
that they were more educated,

2272
01:39:07,351 --> 01:39:08,920
but as I looked into it,
I felt it was like,

2273
01:39:08,930 --> 01:39:09,763
that's not really true,
but you would think that it would be 

2274
01:39:11,701 --> 01:39:14,820
more educated because they can.
Is it left and right or is it just.

2275
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:15,733
Is it,
is it.

2276
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:18,870
Are we talking about just people who 
are.

2277
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,033
I feel like when we talk about these 
people that are not going to have a 

2278
01:39:22,621 --> 01:39:25,370
sound systems and walking out and 
shouting that Christine and summers,

2279
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:28,380
I don't know that they're right or left.
I think that these are young,

2280
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:33,240
young,
confused people.

2281
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:35,430
Shitheads shit.
Yeah.

2282
01:39:35,431 --> 01:39:37,840
I think that I really do.
I think they're proud.

2283
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:40,260
First of all.
I don't think they're very smart.

2284
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,270
I don't think that that's absolutely 
true.

2285
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:45,300
I think a lot of them might have some 
psychological problems.

2286
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:46,433
I think a lot of them want to belong.
I think a lot of them just want to be 

2287
01:39:49,951 --> 01:39:54,900
heard and people do clumsy shit.
When people want to feel significant,

2288
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:56,093
they'll do even crazier shit,
like put a gun in their hand and shoot 

2289
01:39:58,081 --> 01:39:59,610
somebody so sure,
you know,

2290
01:39:59,611 --> 01:40:00,720
and it usually it belongs.

2291
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:03,660
It's the realm of young people who don't
know what to do with their energy.

2292
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:05,130
There's a lot of that.
And again,

2293
01:40:05,131 --> 01:40:07,500
like we talked about before with 
Christina Hoff summers,

2294
01:40:07,530 --> 01:40:08,363
there's just a bunch of people that are 
free from their parents for the first 

2295
01:40:10,471 --> 01:40:11,250
time.
That's right.

2296
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:13,990
You know,
they've only been free for 24 months and

2297
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:16,530
they're stretching,
they're dyed their hair green.

2298
01:40:16,531 --> 01:40:18,810
You can't stop me,
you fascist and I just,

2299
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:19,753
yeah,
I just want to stop everything and they 

2300
01:40:20,941 --> 01:40:21,774
want attention.
But ultimately I think that this is 

2301
01:40:25,981 --> 01:40:26,814
giving us an opportunity to really fully
examine ideas and even though these 

2302
01:40:30,061 --> 01:40:32,250
people shouting people down,
all those noises going on,

2303
01:40:32,251 --> 01:40:33,570
like there'll,
there'll be a result.

2304
01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:34,883
They'll be some sort of an ebb and flow 
to all this that I feel very hopeful 

2305
01:40:39,091 --> 01:40:39,924
about.
Like when I look at the ebb and flow of 

2306
01:40:40,981 --> 01:40:41,910
things,
like I like it.

2307
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:42,773
I like what's going on.
I like that there's a lot of fucking 

2308
01:40:44,251 --> 01:40:45,084
chaos and definitely some people have 
taken some unsafe unnecessarily bullets 

2309
01:40:48,150 --> 01:40:48,983
and there's definitely some ideas that 
are getting shut down that shouldn't be 

2310
01:40:51,151 --> 01:40:51,984
and there's definitely some overuse the 
word Nazi and fascist and all this 

2311
01:40:55,421 --> 01:40:56,254
different stuff,
but it seems like overwhelmingly all 

2312
01:40:58,841 --> 01:40:59,674
this crazy energy is being pushed into 
at least the idea that we're improving 

2313
01:41:03,881 --> 01:41:05,260
the world.
Yeah,

2314
01:41:05,410 --> 01:41:08,380
you know what I'm saying?
They want to improve the world.

2315
01:41:08,410 --> 01:41:09,243
I had a bunch of women on my podcast.
We were talking about sexism in 

2316
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:15,190
Hollywood and of course I was like,
I don't see it that much.

2317
01:41:15,191 --> 01:41:16,024
I was like,
I don't say it,

2318
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:18,790
and these women were all really 
intelligent and I said,

2319
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,200
you know,
I gotta be honest man.

2320
01:41:20,201 --> 01:41:22,630
As a white man now I just feel like I,
it's just,

2321
01:41:22,790 --> 01:41:24,180
it's hard for us.
I go,

2322
01:41:24,210 --> 01:41:24,800
I go,
I go,

2323
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:25,560
I go,
you know,

2324
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:28,780
I gotta watch what I say now I've got to
watch how I talk.

2325
01:41:28,830 --> 01:41:30,120
And,
and one of the women goes,

2326
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,690
Katie goes,
wow,

2327
01:41:31,691 --> 01:41:34,230
I can't imagine what that's like one.
What's it like to have to watch it?

2328
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:38,310
Watch what you say and watch.
Watch what your impact is like.

2329
01:41:38,311 --> 01:41:40,420
I have no idea.
Meanwhile she's been dealing with that.

2330
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:41,673
Every woman I know has been dealing with
that for fucking ever and I guess I 

2331
01:41:44,201 --> 01:41:46,480
didn't take it.
I didn't look at their perspective.

2332
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:48,460
It's hard to look at other people's 
perspective.

2333
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:49,121
Yeah,
it is.

2334
01:41:49,121 --> 01:41:49,954
It's hard to.
Like

2335
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:50,833
I was talking to shop in the last 
podcast we were talking about a Joey 

2336
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:56,770
Diaz had some crazy shit about some 
chicks ass and uh,

2337
01:41:57,170 --> 01:41:59,270
and we were all laughing about it.
He was like,

2338
01:41:59,271 --> 01:42:00,870
it's Joey's fucking Diaz.
He's a comedian.

2339
01:42:00,871 --> 01:42:02,630
I go,
I totally understand and I'm with you.

2340
01:42:02,690 --> 01:42:07,690
But now imagine if you were a regular 
sized guy and you were dealing with some

2341
01:42:10,221 --> 01:42:11,054
seven foot tall ogre who was going 
online talking about how good your 

2342
01:42:16,461 --> 01:42:18,440
asshole smelled.
And you're like,

2343
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:19,303
oh Jesus.
And you knew that that guy wanted to 

2344
01:42:20,451 --> 01:42:21,284
fuck you.
And then you knew that if he was alone 

2345
01:42:22,251 --> 01:42:24,110
with you,
he could probably like hold you down and

2346
01:42:24,111 --> 01:42:26,390
fuck you.
Like that would be terrifying,

2347
01:42:26,450 --> 01:42:27,170
right?
Yeah,

2348
01:42:27,170 --> 01:42:29,720
that'd be terrifying.
In this case,

2349
01:42:29,721 --> 01:42:32,090
he's talking about a female fighter.
Probably would fuck joey.

2350
01:42:32,091 --> 01:42:34,550
His ass probably beat Joe.
His ass.

2351
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:38,390
Bad Ass.
You know Joey's not in the best shape.

2352
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:39,820
He might.
He might call clock

2353
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:41,330
punched out.
She starts circling,

2354
01:42:41,331 --> 01:42:42,164
is jagged.
She's scared she's going to pepper his 

2355
01:42:44,651 --> 01:42:46,580
face a little bit,
but either way he's being funny.

2356
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:48,120
That's all it is.
But I was saying about.

2357
01:42:48,270 --> 01:42:49,103
Imagine now though that your a girl who 
hear someone talk about your asshole 

2358
01:42:53,441 --> 01:42:55,530
like that and we've all done it.
We've all done it.

2359
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:58,050
Yeah.
You'd be like,

2360
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:58,913
oh no.
Like that's got to be a terrible 

2361
01:42:59,851 --> 01:43:00,684
feeling.

2362
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:03,800
Yeah,
it is.

2363
01:43:03,801 --> 01:43:04,634
It's interesting.
I'd love to be a woman for one day to 

2364
01:43:06,681 --> 01:43:08,210
see what.
That's what you'd like to get fucked.

2365
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:10,700
If you're a woman for one day,
we just suck a dick.

2366
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:12,200
No,
wouldn't you like,

2367
01:43:12,201 --> 01:43:14,480
that's where I draw the line in there.
I only want to see where it goes.

2368
01:43:14,481 --> 01:43:16,790
I just want to see what it's like.
Like what does it feel like?

2369
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,320
Like stuck it in your ass.
Like I could have found that out.

2370
01:43:19,321 --> 01:43:19,971
I was a guy.
Well,

2371
01:43:19,971 --> 01:43:20,804
first of all,
what's it like to be attracted to a man 

2372
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:25,220
like I look at you and I know women find
attractive.

2373
01:43:25,221 --> 01:43:27,040
I don't find you attractive.
Beautiful,

2374
01:43:27,150 --> 01:43:28,340
right area,
right?

2375
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:30,590
But to have this big kind of a good 
side,

2376
01:43:31,050 --> 01:43:33,080
this guy,
you got a strong jaw,

2377
01:43:33,081 --> 01:43:34,460
smaller,
strong jaw,

2378
01:43:34,461 --> 01:43:38,120
smolder God,
you do smaller and smaller and smaller.

2379
01:43:38,121 --> 01:43:39,380
It's hard.
It's hard for you to.

2380
01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:41,300
I get lost in your eyes.
You have a strong Johnson.

2381
01:43:41,770 --> 01:43:42,603
Well,
imagine wanting someone to stick 

2382
01:43:43,361 --> 01:43:45,370
something in you and shoot,
shoot sperm and two.

2383
01:43:45,371 --> 01:43:47,320
You can't wait.
Get some in me.

2384
01:43:47,410 --> 01:43:48,520
Yeah,
imagine that.

2385
01:43:48,570 --> 01:43:49,690
Yeah.
Jamie just threw up.

2386
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:52,160
Yeah.
Like

2387
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:54,730
my wife was watching Sopranos and she 
found time sprinter.

2388
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:55,583
Attractive when I said why?
She goes because he's powerful and he's 

2389
01:43:58,011 --> 01:44:00,130
just bad and he's and,
and you know,

2390
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,060
and I said,
well we want to be married to him.

2391
01:44:02,061 --> 01:44:03,170
She goes,
I don't want to be married to him.

2392
01:44:03,171 --> 01:44:05,000
I want to be as mistress.
I was like,

2393
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:06,980
what the fuck?
God.

2394
01:44:06,981 --> 01:44:10,850
Leave the room.
I know I gotta I got to gain weight.

2395
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:13,220
I would make tea and I was think about 
my life.

2396
01:44:13,221 --> 01:44:14,054
I got to stop being so shredded.
I've got to get into crime and gained 

2397
01:44:16,071 --> 01:44:17,920
some weight instead of being so good.
Yeah.

2398
01:44:17,930 --> 01:44:20,570
Just eat some pasta.
So legit and terrific up.

2399
01:44:21,150 --> 01:44:22,190
Yeah,
he died young.

2400
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:23,143
That was a bummer.
If it's one of those guys that when he 

2401
01:44:25,041 --> 01:44:26,060
died I was like,
oh,

2402
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:28,430
55 or 52 or something.
Shit.

2403
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:29,960
He was in that neighborhood.

2404
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:31,490
Looked every bit of 60.
Yeah.

2405
01:44:31,491 --> 01:44:33,920
He had it all in his system to baby.
Yeah,

2406
01:44:33,921 --> 01:44:34,754
he did,
right?

2407
01:44:34,930 --> 01:44:37,400
He had the full ride.
He likes to do well.

2408
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:40,400
I know guys have worked with them.
I know guys well who worked with him and

2409
01:44:40,401 --> 01:44:42,950
he just.
He could fucking tear it up man.

2410
01:44:43,070 --> 01:44:46,940
Who's the movie though?
Played a hitman.

2411
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:48,830
What was that movie?
True Romance?

2412
01:44:49,330 --> 01:44:49,850
No,
no.

2413
01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:51,380
Yeah.
Was that one but there was a more recent

2414
01:44:51,381 --> 01:44:54,620
one.
I'm God damn it.

2415
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:56,710
Was it with Brad Pitt?
Was there,

2416
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:58,910
moved with him and Brad Pitt killing me 
softly.

2417
01:44:58,970 --> 01:45:01,310
Yes.
Was he a Hitman to.

2418
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,280
They were both Hitman,
but he was also in the drop.

2419
01:45:04,281 --> 01:45:05,310
I don't know if you're thinking about 
that.

2420
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:07,730
I'm thinking of killing me softly.
That's the one,

2421
01:45:07,731 --> 01:45:10,010
right?
He was great and true romance,

2422
01:45:10,011 --> 01:45:10,641
man.
Fuck.

2423
01:45:10,641 --> 01:45:12,260
He's great and everything.
It was amazing.

2424
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:17,250
I mean that Tony Soprano's character 
literally literally changed gene,

2425
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:18,133
what we think of as like a hero in a TV 
show because all of a sudden the hero 

2426
01:45:21,441 --> 01:45:23,630
was a murderer,
like the hero.

2427
01:45:23,770 --> 01:45:27,200
Like when he killed Christopher,
like when they had the car accident,

2428
01:45:27,201 --> 01:45:28,730
you just fucking smothered him.
He's like,

2429
01:45:28,731 --> 01:45:31,310
this is a good excuse to kill this guy.
I just killed him right there.

2430
01:45:31,311 --> 01:45:32,870
I was like,
whoa.

2431
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:36,620
Holy Shit.
Holy Shit.

2432
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:38,690
When he closed his nose.
Yeah,

2433
01:45:38,691 --> 01:45:40,570
man,
that was fucked up.

2434
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:44,930
There's no class that was fucked up.
Yeah,

2435
01:45:45,230 --> 01:45:46,790
I know.
That's what it was like.

2436
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:49,940
That's willing to do whatever it took.
Yeah,

2437
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:51,740
but it was also the star,
the movie,

2438
01:45:51,770 --> 01:45:53,690
The star of the show.
And you liked him?

2439
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,450
Oh yeah.
That's what was so genius.

2440
01:45:56,860 --> 01:45:59,480
There's never been a show like,
that is so bad.

2441
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:04,170
Look,
he was so bad and there's.

2442
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:06,380
There hasn't been a show like that since
then.

2443
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:08,233
I mean,
who else is like that much of a villain 

2444
01:46:13,341 --> 01:46:16,040
and a hero wrapped up into one?
Who else?

2445
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:17,930
What other?
What other?

2446
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:20,960
The only person that you can maybe 
breaking bad,

2447
01:46:20,961 --> 01:46:22,070
but you could see why he was doing it.

2448
01:46:22,070 --> 01:46:24,950
It wasn't a bad guy.
Tony Soprano's was a Hemi badge,

2449
01:46:25,090 --> 01:46:26,960
cheated on his wife,
constantly murdered,

2450
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:28,820
killed,
but it was the.

2451
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:31,310
What was fascinating about him is that 
it was the dichotomy.

2452
01:46:31,311 --> 01:46:32,144
It was the guy who loved his family,
told the son to do his homework and not 

2453
01:46:36,321 --> 01:46:39,830
to swear at the table and also an order 
a hit in the same breath.

2454
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:41,293
That insane contradiction was what?
You can't take your eyes off because 

2455
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:46,423
we're bipolar reps because you can be a 
very bad guy and also a really good guy 

2456
01:46:49,891 --> 01:46:50,724
and that's what's.
That's what's fucking crazy and true 

2457
01:46:52,381 --> 01:46:53,310
about human beings.
Well,

2458
01:46:53,330 --> 01:46:54,163
that's what's brilliant though about 
that writing is that they figured out 

2459
01:46:56,521 --> 01:46:57,354
how to encapsulate that in fiction where
it's playing out every week and you're 

2460
01:47:01,141 --> 01:47:03,440
not.
You're not sick of the guy like you want

2461
01:47:03,441 --> 01:47:04,274
to.
You want to see if he's going to make 

2462
01:47:04,951 --> 01:47:05,100
it.

2463
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:05,933
Is he going to get busted?
Is he going to jail or they gonna crack 

2464
01:47:08,281 --> 01:47:09,960
down on them.
Who's going to rat them out,

2465
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:13,470
you know,
but that,

2466
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:17,340
that shows an interesting like kind of 
metaphor for life.

2467
01:47:17,341 --> 01:47:18,174
Like I guess what I really worry about 
with our social situation today is the 

2468
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:23,993
destruction of people and how they're 
never allowed to come back into the 

2469
01:47:27,271 --> 01:47:28,680
fold.
That's what I worry about.

2470
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:31,410
Like,
like public shaming or whatever it might

2471
01:47:31,411 --> 01:47:32,244
be.
Like there are very few people that 

2472
01:47:34,081 --> 01:47:37,770
deserve eternal damnation and they are 
out there,

2473
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:39,960
but for the most part,
Roman Polanski.

2474
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:41,680
It's a tough,
you know,

2475
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:42,713
again,
a great artist and a great filmmaker on 

2476
01:47:44,850 --> 01:47:48,210
reacting to the fact that you,
I can't,

2477
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:54,200
I can't justify having you come back to 
the country and be pardoned after that.

2478
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:59,640
If the,
if what you did is true.

2479
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,090
If what I've been,
what I've read and been told is true,

2480
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:04,253
I don't know how I'm supposed to forgive
that so that that's mainly because a 

2481
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:11,340
child and so that falls into line of 
unacceptable things for me,

2482
01:48:11,370 --> 01:48:12,203
but then there's people that have been 
shamed like Al Franken where you're 

2483
01:48:15,701 --> 01:48:16,600
like,
really?

2484
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:17,680
No.
That was ridiculous.

2485
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:19,420
It was ridiculous.
What did he do?

2486
01:48:19,421 --> 01:48:23,600
What I get to the photo was very 
inappropriate that he took the end.

2487
01:48:24,490 --> 01:48:26,820
You can't just train him.
Funny Weinstein.

2488
01:48:26,821 --> 01:48:27,840
That cheapens.
No,

2489
01:48:27,841 --> 01:48:29,100
you can't.
He shouldn't have done it,

2490
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:32,070
but he was trying to be funny and 
sometimes people try to be funny,

2491
01:48:32,071 --> 01:48:34,020
especially people are around each other 
all the time.

2492
01:48:34,021 --> 01:48:37,920
They get stupid and they,
they crossed lines and you know,

2493
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:39,023
or you just don't read the signals.
You Cross a line in that you're trying 

2494
01:48:42,811 --> 01:48:45,060
to pick somebody up or you're putting 
pressure on them.

2495
01:48:45,061 --> 01:48:48,540
Don't you think that ultimately what 
this is going to do though is people are

2496
01:48:48,541 --> 01:48:50,910
going to have to learn to be nicer to 
each other.

2497
01:48:51,180 --> 01:48:52,013
Don't you think that?
Or they're going to be really careful 

2498
01:48:55,261 --> 01:49:00,261
and afraid and I worry that if you have,
for example,

2499
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:01,920
first of all,
where do people,

2500
01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:06,090
most people meet their wives and their 
girlfriends?

2501
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:07,920
A lot of times it's a work a lot of 
times,

2502
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:08,783
okay,
their husbands and their wives and I 

2503
01:49:10,471 --> 01:49:11,304
think that your don't be surprised if 
corporations start to have a zero 

2504
01:49:15,451 --> 01:49:18,960
tolerance policy for any kind of romance
in the office space.

2505
01:49:18,961 --> 01:49:19,794
It'll be like the military.
Nobody's allowed to date anybody and if 

2506
01:49:21,391 --> 01:49:23,130
you do get fired right away,
no questions asked,

2507
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:26,100
and now think about the fact that your 
eight hours a day in this place,

2508
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:28,170
which is most of your waking hours to 
make anybody happy.

2509
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:30,510
I can make anybody happy.
Also,

2510
01:49:30,511 --> 01:49:31,344
please add the fact that we're also 
going to have all of the meetings 

2511
01:49:33,781 --> 01:49:38,430
between men and women in rooms 
videotaped and in fact d and in fact,

2512
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:41,340
men and women aren't allowed to be in 
the same room without a chaperone.

2513
01:49:41,910 --> 01:49:42,743
Yes,
you're going to see all the shit 

2514
01:49:43,170 --> 01:49:45,510
chaperones role because you're talking 
about major money.

2515
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:48,430
You're talking about major fucking.
It'd be a robot with a camera.

2516
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:49,690
The robot,
it says,

2517
01:49:50,110 --> 01:49:51,910
I think you were speaking inappropriate 
thing.

2518
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:55,450
Exactly.
And so you have all these issues,

2519
01:49:56,350 --> 01:49:58,120
so is that going to make all of us 
happier?

2520
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,230
No,
we're going to have to quit.

2521
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:02,330
Is it going to make us work in offices?
We're going to be safer.

2522
01:50:02,331 --> 01:50:04,630
I'm hoping that it makes people quit 
offices.

2523
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:05,703
So what happens is there will be no 
sexual harassment at the workplace 

2524
01:50:08,321 --> 01:50:11,700
because there's no workplace.
Fuck,

2525
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,450
I never thought of that dude.
Dude,

2526
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,260
way ahead.
You're smarter.

2527
01:50:15,370 --> 01:50:18,150
We're working together.
Not Working together now.

2528
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:20,530
That's Kinda why I show up and work 
together.

2529
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:22,030
Fuck.
By the way,

2530
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,550
men and women working together as a 
pretty new thing in history.

2531
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:25,840
Yeah.
Men and women boys.

2532
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:26,823
Yeah.
Men and women have never worked 

2533
01:50:27,311 --> 01:50:27,990
together.
Yeah.

2534
01:50:27,990 --> 01:50:31,150
So this is all kind of like and you 
know,

2535
01:50:31,151 --> 01:50:31,984
you know,
listen,

2536
01:50:32,170 --> 01:50:34,810
when men and women get together,
people are starting to fuck.

2537
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,660
Whoa,
they're just gonna Fuck Whitney.

2538
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:39,280
Cummings was a funny joke about that,
but working in the writing room,

2539
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:44,230
working on a set of a show like she 
doesn't usually work like at a place and

2540
01:50:44,231 --> 01:50:45,064
she's like,
oh,

2541
01:50:45,340 --> 01:50:46,810
this is what people are doing here.
Like,

2542
01:50:46,811 --> 01:50:48,760
yeah,
I don't want to give away her joke.

2543
01:50:48,761 --> 01:50:49,890
It's very funny,
but yeah,

2544
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:51,100
that's,
you know,

2545
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:53,920
there's something that's happening when 
men and women get around each other,

2546
01:50:53,921 --> 01:50:54,754
they're jockeying for sexual position 
and they're attracted to each other and 

2547
01:50:57,340 --> 01:50:59,170
they worked together and they ended up 
liking each other.

2548
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:00,233
Yeah.
And then they get to know each other at 

2549
01:51:01,061 --> 01:51:02,050
work and.
Yeah.

2550
01:51:02,051 --> 01:51:03,160
And then what happens.
Okay.

2551
01:51:03,161 --> 01:51:03,994
So you can see you can't.
So there's no such and there's no 

2552
01:51:06,851 --> 01:51:10,330
romance and there's no humor.
Humor is dangerous.

2553
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:11,373
Humor can be a problem.
What if you say something racist and 

2554
01:51:13,151 --> 01:51:13,984
you're trying to be funny.

2555
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:16,680
You get in trouble.
Don't do that.

2556
01:51:16,681 --> 01:51:18,730
You're not racist,
but you were just trying to be funny.

2557
01:51:19,090 --> 01:51:19,930
Right.
Okay.

2558
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:21,243
But you can say racist things.
I'll give you a free pass to say racist 

2559
01:51:24,941 --> 01:51:28,090
things about white people.
Well that's fine.

2560
01:51:28,150 --> 01:51:30,700
I'll give you a free pass.
Do you have any racist white things that

2561
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:32,230
you could say at work today?
Tommy?

2562
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:34,810
Yeah.
Couldn't they be hillbillies?

2563
01:51:35,110 --> 01:51:36,160
Yes.
Or rednecks.

2564
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:38,290
Rednecks.
Dirty hillbillies.

2565
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:39,640
That's fine.
Shit.

2566
01:51:39,641 --> 01:51:40,474
All over those people that were forced,
their whole family worked at a coal 

2567
01:51:42,251 --> 01:51:43,100
mine.
Yeah.

2568
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:44,950
Hey,
how you dummies?

2569
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:46,830
Will you fucking your kids?
Uh,

2570
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:49,360
yeah.
It'd be racist all day for white people.

2571
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:54,190
You can and there's some white people 
that do not have a fucking good deal.

2572
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:55,970
They don't have a good deal.
No.

2573
01:51:56,290 --> 01:52:01,240
They got $400 in the bank if that.
There's some incredible amount of money,

2574
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:03,370
uh,
or an incredible amount of people rather

2575
01:52:03,371 --> 01:52:06,870
in this country that have less than that
in their bank through.

2576
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:08,530
Yeah.
There was something like 50 percent,

2577
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:09,713
some study they did.
People that have $200 or less in their 

2578
01:52:13,931 --> 01:52:14,764
bank account and some insane number like
into the millions and millions of 

2579
01:52:20,530 --> 01:52:21,460
people.
This is what I always say,

2580
01:52:21,461 --> 01:52:23,250
that people that voted for trump,
you know,

2581
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:25,590
a lot of them have been demonized by,
you know,

2582
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:30,220
the left as being a racist or homophobic
or massage seats and stuff like that.

2583
01:52:30,221 --> 01:52:31,870
Yeah.
Or or,

2584
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:36,850
or good people who have $400 in the bank
or less,

2585
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:39,400
can't send their kids to baseball,
et cetera.

2586
01:52:39,401 --> 01:52:42,970
And along comes Hillary Clinton,
who's Obama light talking about the same

2587
01:52:42,971 --> 01:52:43,571
shit.
And they were like,

2588
01:52:43,571 --> 01:52:45,410
I'll try anything but her.
Look at this.

2589
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:47,660
There you go.
That's real.

2590
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:49,430
Read that.
That's real man.

2591
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:52,730
Six in 10 Americans don't have $500 in 
savings.

2592
01:52:52,731 --> 01:52:54,050
There you go.
Holy Shit.

2593
01:52:54,051 --> 01:52:56,540
It's way more than I thought it was when
you don't have one.

2594
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:57,031
Okay,
now,

2595
01:52:57,031 --> 01:52:59,180
now we're back to that.
That story about scarcity.

2596
01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:02,710
Isn't that like a hundred and $50,
million people or something like that?

2597
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,670
Yeah,
60 percent.

2598
01:53:04,790 --> 01:53:05,630
It's more than.
Yeah.

2599
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:06,493
So,
so how does the,

2600
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:07,843
what is the real number of people in 
America is a 300 million or morning or 

2601
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:11,960
something at 3:30.
Three 30.

2602
01:53:12,410 --> 01:53:13,550
So it's more than that.
Yeah.

2603
01:53:13,551 --> 01:53:16,220
So,
so one 70 170 million people.

2604
01:53:18,210 --> 01:53:21,140
So when you got $500 a month,
are you thinking about gender neutral?

2605
01:53:21,141 --> 01:53:22,290
Bathrooms?
Always.

2606
01:53:22,350 --> 01:53:23,680
Are you thinking about that?
No.

2607
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:26,570
Everyone's massages,
bro.

2608
01:53:26,660 --> 01:53:29,540
It's disgusting to be a man and see 
other men's.

2609
01:53:29,541 --> 01:53:32,660
I'm just ashamed of my gender.
I'm ashamed.

2610
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:33,553
All your fucking thinking about is 
getting my money so you can send your 

2611
01:53:35,751 --> 01:53:36,584
kids to fucking think.
Bret Weinstein said that was really 

2612
01:53:39,081 --> 01:53:40,580
interesting about this.
Is it better?

2613
01:53:40,590 --> 01:53:42,710
Eric and Eric?
There's brothers.

2614
01:53:42,711 --> 01:53:44,360
They're brothers.
They both been on my podcast.

2615
01:53:44,630 --> 01:53:46,250
Eric is a mathematician who works for 
Peter.

2616
01:53:46,251 --> 01:53:47,084
Teal is the professor from Evergreen 
College that got the day of absence 

2617
01:53:51,351 --> 01:53:53,780
where they made him quit because there 
was.

2618
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:55,520
There were saying white people need to 
stay home.

2619
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:57,470
Everybody's like,
that's so racist.

2620
01:53:57,860 --> 01:53:59,870
He's also a Jew.
The Jews.

2621
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:00,740
We super,
super,

2622
01:54:00,741 --> 01:54:02,190
super progressive.
It doesn't matter.

2623
01:54:02,230 --> 01:54:04,820
The Jews didn't exactly have it easy 
what he was saying.

2624
01:54:04,821 --> 01:54:05,654
That's interesting.
You were saying that this is not just 

2625
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:09,343
about that.
It's also about subordination and that 

2626
01:54:12,351 --> 01:54:15,590
you're seeing this subordination plate 
that's planning,

2627
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:19,040
that's taking place,
and then a lot of these men like the way

2628
01:54:19,041 --> 01:54:19,874
they're behaving,
they're behaving to be subordinate 

2629
01:54:21,660 --> 01:54:22,210
there.
There.

2630
01:54:22,210 --> 01:54:25,030
There are being obedience trained,
you know,

2631
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:25,873
and they're.
They're giving into it to show that you 

2632
01:54:27,441 --> 01:54:28,274
shouldn't punish me because I'm on your 
side because they were terrified of the 

2633
01:54:31,671 --> 01:54:32,504
women that are wielding this power now,
but I got up in the air building that 

2634
01:54:34,621 --> 01:54:35,220
wild.

2635
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:38,990
I've got a theory about that.
Brilliant men.

2636
01:54:39,110 --> 01:54:39,943
Historically,
when you create a bunch of quiet resent 

2637
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:47,360
and it turns into allowed violence,
men are really good at.

2638
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:48,823
You've got to be careful about make a 
masculine men a wholesale because I 

2639
01:54:53,991 --> 01:54:54,824
always worry that it's very easy to whip
them up when you got the right 

2640
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:01,243
circumstances and the right leader and 
men like to organize and they liked to 

2641
01:55:05,511 --> 01:55:06,344
fight and they like to fight back and 
that's what makes them feel significant 

2642
01:55:09,711 --> 01:55:13,340
when they've been emasculated and I 
don't think it's,

2643
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:15,140
you know,
that's the expression.

2644
01:55:15,141 --> 01:55:18,320
Punishment doesn't change behavior.
It just suppresses it.

2645
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:19,633
Well.
Do you know that in the turn of the 

2646
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:21,710
century,
I'm not this one,

2647
01:55:21,711 --> 01:55:22,544
but the last,
there was a giant bachelor culture in 

2648
01:55:26,691 --> 01:55:27,524
America where men just didn't.
They had just gotten through like a lot 

2649
01:55:32,091 --> 01:55:35,270
of it was like in the twenties to like 
an after the depression.

2650
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:38,660
It was like the burden of having a 
family was just too much.

2651
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:39,733
It wasn't attractive to them and there 
was a bunch of men that gravitate 

2652
01:55:42,021 --> 01:55:44,090
towards pool halls and in

2653
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:44,933
19 early 19 hundreds of New York City,
there was more than 900 pool halls in 

2654
01:55:50,881 --> 01:55:55,881
New York City to just stop and think of 
that more than 900 pools and there's all

2655
01:55:56,911 --> 01:55:59,850
these men that would just go there and 
they would hang out and they were like,

2656
01:55:59,851 --> 01:56:03,660
fuck that life,
and they just didn't want to have a part

2657
01:56:03,661 --> 01:56:05,640
of it because it was too brutal.
It was too hard.

2658
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:11,120
They're all this country would need for 
this thing to flip on its fucking ass.

2659
01:56:11,850 --> 01:56:15,120
All they would need is legalized 
prostitution and guys would be like,

2660
01:56:15,121 --> 01:56:15,954
wait,
hold up,

2661
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:16,980
wait a minute,
hold on,

2662
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:18,420
hold on.
I definitely love you.

2663
01:56:18,421 --> 01:56:19,740
I'd definitely love you,
but wait a minute,

2664
01:56:19,741 --> 01:56:21,540
wait a minute.
What am I signing?

2665
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:23,033
What is this?
If if people found out that they could 

2666
01:56:25,831 --> 01:56:29,130
just get sex anytime they wanted,
if they had $100,

2667
01:56:29,310 --> 01:56:30,143
like if you have $100,
you can get sex and you get sex and a 

2668
01:56:32,281 --> 01:56:33,480
pretty girl and it's clean.

2669
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:35,970
You don't have to worry about it.
People would be outraged.

2670
01:56:35,971 --> 01:56:36,301
Like,
well,

2671
01:56:36,301 --> 01:56:38,370
how am I going to have power over this 
man?

2672
01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:41,730
If I can't control his sex,
I could only.

2673
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:44,220
I only have him locked.
Otherwise we're just friends.

2674
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:46,650
See if we're just friends,
I can't have half his money.

2675
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:49,650
I can't tell him what to do.
I can't tell him when to be home,

2676
01:56:49,651 --> 01:56:50,484
but let me ask you a question.
We have to live together and I have to 

2677
01:56:52,531 --> 01:56:53,364
control his sex.
If we live together and then I control 

2678
01:56:55,101 --> 01:56:57,000
his sex,
then I have all this power.

2679
01:56:57,240 --> 01:56:58,073
But if they were in a situation where 
legalized prostitution was just like 

2680
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:05,310
grocery stores or it's just everywhere.
What would the first of all,

2681
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:08,910
the amount of hose would probably be the
same.

2682
01:57:09,950 --> 01:57:13,110
It's like used to be a lot richer.
Now they're just doing it like under the

2683
01:57:13,111 --> 01:57:13,770
table.

2684
01:57:13,770 --> 01:57:17,880
It's hard to get away with it.
They can get rated as sneakiness.

2685
01:57:17,881 --> 01:57:18,714
There's all this,
you know,

2686
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:19,673
the gold diggers instead of hose.
Some girls would just go straight into 

2687
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:23,910
heroin.
Yeah.

2688
01:57:23,911 --> 01:57:24,744
But here's my question.
Do you think men are more interested in 

2689
01:57:26,971 --> 01:57:29,250
sex or admiration?
There's both.

2690
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:31,680
They want to be fake admiration from the
hose.

2691
01:57:31,770 --> 01:57:33,820
Yeah,
but they say with all due respect,

2692
01:57:33,821 --> 01:57:34,740
no,
it's fake though.

2693
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:39,390
Like I think men can do want to be 
admired more than anything else they do.

2694
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:41,640
They do.
They want their dick to be the biggest.

2695
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:42,503
Even if it's a mushroom cap,
just make all the noise please and let 

2696
01:57:45,001 --> 01:57:48,030
me know I'm King Kong and that's why.
And you stick to the woman.

2697
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:49,103
A lot of times you'll stick that one 
woman who you know has got your back no 

2698
01:57:52,081 --> 01:57:52,914
matter what you're talking about.
A guy who finds that there's a lot of 

2699
01:57:55,981 --> 01:57:57,600
people that don't find that in for them.

2700
01:57:57,600 --> 01:57:59,730
Legalized prostitution right next to 
Bolero.

2701
01:57:59,970 --> 01:58:04,970
Hop on in Chanera go sandwich Dick,
suck.

2702
01:58:06,030 --> 01:58:08,520
Get a grilled cheese and tomato soup 
kitchen.

2703
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:14,570
Like it would change.
Like what people like why,

2704
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:15,773
why are you dating?
Are you dating specifically for sex or 

2705
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:19,333
dating because you want companionship,
like are you too consumed with work and 

2706
01:58:22,490 --> 01:58:23,323
are you busy all day and you just like 
to hang out with your friends but you 

2707
01:58:24,781 --> 01:58:25,650
get horny?
Yeah,

2708
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:29,160
because we have a solution for you.
And if that was the case.

2709
01:58:29,190 --> 01:58:30,930
I'm not saying that relationships 
wouldn't be the same,

2710
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:32,003
but I'm saying is there's a lot of 
relationships that wouldn't be the same 

2711
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:35,093
too.
I think you're onto something like my 

2712
01:58:36,571 --> 01:58:37,720
buddy Steve,
he blew it.

2713
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:38,583
He was like,
he would have stayed in jail if he had 

2714
01:58:39,541 --> 01:58:41,800
access to women because he was hanging 
out with all his friends.

2715
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:42,140
He

2716
01:58:42,140 --> 01:58:45,550
was like,
it was the fucking best best because all

2717
01:58:45,551 --> 01:58:47,950
we do is fuck around and laugh all day,
lift weights,

2718
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:49,870
and you know,
he just did food kind of sucks,

2719
01:58:49,871 --> 01:58:51,810
but you're all laughing and you're all 
in a shitty situation.

2720
01:58:51,811 --> 01:58:52,930
Situations.
Everybody gets along.

2721
01:58:53,110 --> 01:58:54,280
He goes,
if I had girls,

2722
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:57,890
if I had access to women,
I would not have left.

2723
01:58:57,950 --> 01:59:00,220
That's hilarious.
This is in Fort Dix to like,

2724
01:59:00,221 --> 01:59:01,054
you know,
the biggest federal penitentiary in the 

2725
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:03,360
world.

2726
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:07,720
I'm obviously torn on prostitution 
because I don't want anybody that I know

2727
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:08,733
kids or my kids to go into prostitution,
but I also don't think anybody should 

2728
01:59:13,151 --> 01:59:13,984
tell people that something that's 
completely legal to do for free is 

2729
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:21,390
illegal to charge money for.
Yeah.

2730
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:25,270
Like there is some gay male escort that 
came out today.

2731
01:59:25,530 --> 01:59:26,460
Uh,
there was,

2732
01:59:26,540 --> 01:59:29,950
I put it on my twitter about like,
just let these fucking people have sex.

2733
01:59:29,951 --> 01:59:30,784
Like some gay male escort was talking 
about the priests at the Vatican and 

2734
01:59:33,551 --> 01:59:34,510
he's like,
naming names.

2735
01:59:34,511 --> 01:59:36,090
I fuck that guy.
I fucked him.

2736
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:37,370
I fuck pan.
He wants us,

2737
01:59:37,460 --> 01:59:39,570
my dad,
him and you know,

2738
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:41,800
they was talking about them being 
hypocritical.

2739
01:59:41,801 --> 01:59:42,251
Like,
yeah,

2740
01:59:42,251 --> 01:59:45,940
there are definitely hypocritical.
Let these fucking people have sex.

2741
01:59:45,941 --> 01:59:47,180
This is crazy.
Like your,

2742
01:59:47,190 --> 01:59:49,050
your system doesn't work.
Yeah.

2743
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:54,100
If they just let them have sex and let 
them have male escorts,

2744
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:56,320
just leave them alone.
Say That's fine.

2745
01:59:56,380 --> 01:59:58,030
Just as long as you do.
You believe in Jesus still.

2746
01:59:58,031 --> 01:59:59,320
Yeah.
Just like Dick,

2747
01:59:59,710 --> 02:00:01,330
I believe in Jesus,
but I love Dick.

2748
02:00:01,331 --> 02:00:02,164
Okay,
well Jesus must've put that love for 

2749
02:00:02,981 --> 02:00:04,540
Dick in you.
Jesus.

2750
02:00:04,541 --> 02:00:06,850
Put that love for our truth.
Sure.

2751
02:00:06,851 --> 02:00:08,510
Right.
It must have been.

2752
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:09,460
The truth is

2753
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,350
it's a complicated thing,
right?

2754
02:00:12,351 --> 02:00:13,820
Because then where do you.
So,

2755
02:00:13,850 --> 02:00:18,850
so like we had these urges and a lot of 
them are not very productive,

2756
02:00:20,990 --> 02:00:23,110
right?
So you want to have sex with all,

2757
02:00:23,210 --> 02:00:25,580
you want to have sex with everybody you 
can or whatever it might be,

2758
02:00:25,581 --> 02:00:27,800
but you know,
that's not viable because there are just

2759
02:00:27,801 --> 02:00:28,640
certain trade offs

2760
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:30,600
do that.
Well,

2761
02:00:30,670 --> 02:00:31,280
you know,
the,

2762
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:36,280
the viable alternatives x Mokena you 
have these ai robot fuck dolls that live

2763
02:00:37,541 --> 02:00:40,030
in your house,
but the problem is they probably get too

2764
02:00:40,031 --> 02:00:44,230
smart than they kill your real wife.
You know the algorithm.

2765
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:45,153
Yeah.
And they figured out a way to convert 

2766
02:00:46,031 --> 02:00:47,980
your sperm into babies.
They just,

2767
02:00:48,030 --> 02:00:51,080
they've figured out a way to create an 
actual digital wound.

2768
02:00:51,210 --> 02:00:54,610
Could idea for from movie dude.
Well it's x Monkey Manchino that movie.

2769
02:00:54,780 --> 02:00:56,350
Did you see that now?
Oh my God.

2770
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:58,270
It's one of my all time favorite.
Yeah.

2771
02:00:58,271 --> 02:01:00,910
I want to top top 20 all time.
Favorite movies.

2772
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:05,890
I'm obsessed with Black Mirror.
It's an hour and 45 minute black mirror.

2773
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:07,870
X market is amazing.
Yeah,

2774
02:01:07,871 --> 02:01:09,250
I do love Black Mirror.
It's awesome.

2775
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:11,680
But x market is actually even more 
intense.

2776
02:01:11,860 --> 02:01:15,190
It's a really well done movie about Ai 
and uh,

2777
02:01:15,250 --> 02:01:17,890
it's,
it has very few cut the shit scenes.

2778
02:01:17,890 --> 02:01:19,210
Like when you're,
when you're watching it,

2779
02:01:19,211 --> 02:01:20,080
you're like,
whoa.

2780
02:01:20,260 --> 02:01:22,570
Like all of this could be possible in a 
hundred percent.

2781
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:24,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

2782
02:01:24,581 --> 02:01:26,320
It's really good.
I want to tell you anymore.

2783
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:27,780
It's really good to watch it.
Yeah,

2784
02:01:28,110 --> 02:01:29,230
it's,
it's the shit.

2785
02:01:29,890 --> 02:01:31,840
And it's also.
Yeah.

2786
02:01:31,841 --> 02:01:32,980
That would be the move.
What do you think?

2787
02:01:33,730 --> 02:01:35,770
It's so fun.
It's going to eat us.

2788
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:37,690
You think what I think?
How about this?

2789
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:38,823
Um,
Boston makes those fucking robots that 

2790
02:01:41,361 --> 02:01:43,520
you can't kick over.
Do you know those things?

2791
02:01:43,521 --> 02:01:44,690
Yeah.
And they,

2792
02:01:44,890 --> 02:01:49,890
they are funded by Darpa and Darpa makes
a robot called the eater robot e a t our

2793
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:56,320
robot and the eater robot literally eats
biological material.

2794
02:01:57,620 --> 02:02:00,530
I'll spell that out for you.
It's fucking people.

2795
02:02:00,710 --> 02:02:04,280
It eats dead people on the battlefield 
to fuel itself.

2796
02:02:04,310 --> 02:02:05,143
It is an actual working concept of a 
fucking robot that eats dead people for 

2797
02:02:11,061 --> 02:02:11,690
fuel.

2798
02:02:11,690 --> 02:02:13,730
Yes.
E a t o will.

2799
02:02:13,731 --> 02:02:18,260
It can eat hay and maybe sticks and 
rabbits.

2800
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:22,740
Maybe delete a rabbit.
It's going to eat people you fuck way,

2801
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:26,450
way autonomous tactical robot eater 
project.

2802
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:28,670
Uh,
it's from a Darpa.

2803
02:02:28,730 --> 02:02:29,563
It's.
Yeah.

2804
02:02:29,570 --> 02:02:32,480
What's Darpa you highlighting there?
What's dark?

2805
02:02:32,990 --> 02:02:33,823
Oh,
it's a video.

2806
02:02:33,930 --> 02:02:35,780
So I'm looking at the cursor doing that.
I'm like,

2807
02:02:35,781 --> 02:02:38,840
why are you highlighting Darpa?
Darpa is.

2808
02:02:38,841 --> 02:02:41,570
I forget the something research.
It's all military shit.

2809
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:44,340
Darpa is a robot.
Yes.

2810
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:46,040
Yeah,
it's a real thing.

2811
02:02:46,340 --> 02:02:47,173
Yeah.
It's a real thing that the same people 

2812
02:02:48,231 --> 02:02:50,120
that are making those Boston dynamic 
robots,

2813
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:52,730
you just see the one recently that it 
bounces.

2814
02:02:52,850 --> 02:02:53,683
It pulls up to the side of a wall and 
then bounces over the wall like 13 feet 

2815
02:02:56,301 --> 02:02:59,090
in the air.
No lands on top of a building.

2816
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:00,073
It could land on the roof of a building.
Come on from the bottom and hop all the 

2817
02:03:02,931 --> 02:03:05,570
way up to the second story.

2818
02:03:05,570 --> 02:03:06,403
Building two story building.
It leaps literally from the ground all 

2819
02:03:09,081 --> 02:03:13,040
the way to the top itself.
It's on wheels,

2820
02:03:13,070 --> 02:03:14,810
so it writes itself perfectly every 
time.

2821
02:03:15,290 --> 02:03:16,550
That's so fucking,
dude.

2822
02:03:16,551 --> 02:03:19,310
It's so bananas and all this stuff is 
happening.

2823
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:22,280
Like while people are paying attention 
to Kim Kardashian's ass.

2824
02:03:22,530 --> 02:03:23,870
Even Jamie,
Jamie's like,

2825
02:03:23,871 --> 02:03:26,750
oh,
Kim Kardashian called out the easy mafia

2826
02:03:26,751 --> 02:03:27,240
today.
Like,

2827
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:29,560
did you like her?
You like her a camera dash,

2828
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:30,403
and he is.
He loves celebrity gossip and upset of 

2829
02:03:33,831 --> 02:03:36,030
how I met your mother and she was there 
and we were.

2830
02:03:36,031 --> 02:03:38,270
We were like,
her dressing room was right next to mine

2831
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:41,230
that she was on set and she didn't look 
like what I thought she was.

2832
02:03:41,470 --> 02:03:43,040
She didn't have any makeup.
She's pretty and all,

2833
02:03:43,070 --> 02:03:45,060
but it was just like,
I didn't even know that I was hurt.

2834
02:03:45,061 --> 02:03:46,380
I was like,
I think that's Kim Kardashian.

2835
02:03:46,410 --> 02:03:47,243
I'm not sure.

2836
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:48,740
It's a.
she's a person.

2837
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:49,833
She's.
We've made a bizarre choice to spend a 

2838
02:03:53,481 --> 02:03:55,980
tremendous and me included spend a 
tremendous amount of talent,

2839
02:03:56,030 --> 02:03:58,070
tremendous,
tremendous amount of time thinking about

2840
02:03:58,071 --> 02:03:58,904
a person that really doesn't do a thing.
Like they just live like that's what's 

2841
02:04:02,961 --> 02:04:04,250
weird.
It's like she,

2842
02:04:04,251 --> 02:04:08,270
they've tapped into this extreme desire 
for gossip and some weird,

2843
02:04:08,271 --> 02:04:09,104
crazy way where they do all these wacky 
things with life where you can't take 

2844
02:04:10,821 --> 02:04:13,070
your eyes off of them and they always 
have something new going on,

2845
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:17,150
but they don't do anything.
So now she got wise though and married a

2846
02:04:17,151 --> 02:04:19,910
guy who does other thing.
She'd married Kanye West,

2847
02:04:19,950 --> 02:04:22,010
right?
He's a giant cultural thing.

2848
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:24,710
Yeah.
So then now it becomes more legit.

2849
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:27,410
Now the whole empire is like really 
solidified,

2850
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:31,320
like they've added some fucking sand.
It's ambition,

2851
02:04:31,630 --> 02:04:33,490
ambition.
It's just like this strange.

2852
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:34,333
It's definitely that.

2853
02:04:35,090 --> 02:04:37,260
There's ambition,
but there's also this.

2854
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:39,090
They've figured out how to Juke the 
system.

2855
02:04:39,450 --> 02:04:43,380
They figured out how to Shuck and jive 
and make their way in with no singing,

2856
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:46,700
no dancing,
no comedy into money.

2857
02:04:46,710 --> 02:04:49,290
I think I have money,
but what do you do?

2858
02:04:49,291 --> 02:04:50,124
Anything different than you did like 
besides not worry so much about what a 

2859
02:04:52,651 --> 02:04:55,740
car is going to cost,
but what do you do that's luxurious?

2860
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:57,580
I don't really do much,
man addressed.

2861
02:04:57,730 --> 02:05:01,100
Those are dress I know address normal 
work.

2862
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:02,940
I work out,
I go running.

2863
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:04,073
What do you do?
Is there any advice you'd like hunting 

2864
02:05:06,370 --> 02:05:07,620
on advice though?
That's where I get my.

2865
02:05:07,660 --> 02:05:10,110
Maybe this is what I mean is like I 
don't spend.

2866
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:11,610
Right.
I have my standup.

2867
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:13,630
I like to box.
I like to uh,

2868
02:05:14,590 --> 02:05:15,423
you know,
the things I do don't take that much 

2869
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:19,620
money.
They take a lot of time and energy.

2870
02:05:19,710 --> 02:05:20,543
I think if you wanted to travel and you 
wanted to go on some big time 

2871
02:05:23,251 --> 02:05:24,084
adventures,
which I have decided I'm really 

2872
02:05:25,471 --> 02:05:28,680
interested in doing some adventure.
Some your especially hunting adventures.

2873
02:05:28,681 --> 02:05:31,670
I like to go to New Zealand,
New Zealand.

2874
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:33,630
We should go to his farm.
I would love to.

2875
02:05:33,631 --> 02:05:34,464
I'd love to go to.
I want to bow hunt in Alaska and the 

2876
02:05:36,031 --> 02:05:39,000
Yukon wild coats on his property there.
Wild.

2877
02:05:39,001 --> 02:05:39,990
Huh?
Go.

2878
02:05:40,710 --> 02:05:41,700
I don't know,
but there are wild.

2879
02:05:41,701 --> 02:05:42,534
He's got his New Zealand's insane.
New Zealand is really like an 

2880
02:05:45,541 --> 02:05:46,374
experimentation in um,
invasive species because everything is 

2881
02:05:49,621 --> 02:05:50,454
invasive.
They have red stag that are from Europe 

2882
02:05:52,081 --> 02:05:54,610
and they have all these axes.
Actually,

2883
02:05:54,680 --> 02:05:55,513
I don't know if they have access to.
He's got huge red stag on his property 

2884
02:05:57,211 --> 02:06:02,211
that shoots their clearance.
They have some immense animals there and

2885
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:03,593
they don't have any predators,
so they have these crazy seasons where 

2886
02:06:05,791 --> 02:06:07,110
you could just shoot things all the 
time.

2887
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:08,070
Oh,
there's a while.

2888
02:06:08,070 --> 02:06:10,380
Go look at a cool horns on that thing,
man.

2889
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:12,450
That's what he should fuck.
That's amazing.

2890
02:06:12,451 --> 02:06:13,800
Look at that thing.
I know.

2891
02:06:13,890 --> 02:06:17,160
It's like the ripples of a jelly fish 
when it's in the water.

2892
02:06:17,230 --> 02:06:20,460
You want to go?
We can go look at that fucking thing.

2893
02:06:20,850 --> 02:06:23,190
That's a New Zealand Wild Goat,
Huh?

2894
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:24,053
Yeah.
Wow.

2895
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:27,510
Those horns are beautiful.
Look at the code on that thing.

2896
02:06:27,940 --> 02:06:30,720
What are the amazing animal?
I know they're smart.

2897
02:06:31,410 --> 02:06:32,243
I was watching a thing online about 
these guys that were hunting for big 

2898
02:06:36,591 --> 02:06:38,820
horn sheep,
you know,

2899
02:06:38,821 --> 02:06:42,480
and there were uh,
in the rocky mountains hunting for rocky

2900
02:06:42,481 --> 02:06:44,010
mountain bighorn sheep with a bow and 
arrow.

2901
02:06:44,270 --> 02:06:46,080
And I was looking at these things and 
I'm like,

2902
02:06:46,110 --> 02:06:46,943
what a crazy animal.
You remember we saw them and we're in 

2903
02:06:48,781 --> 02:06:51,420
Montana.
And rinella was pointing out the size of

2904
02:06:51,421 --> 02:06:52,040
their balls.

2905
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:52,873
Yes,
because they have like church bell 

2906
02:06:53,551 --> 02:06:54,510
balls.
Do they have,

2907
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:57,240
they're so athletic to keep each other 
in the balls.

2908
02:06:57,330 --> 02:06:58,163
They do.
They kick each other in the balls when 

2909
02:06:59,131 --> 02:07:01,530
they were living there,
like be jockeying for attention.

2910
02:07:02,010 --> 02:07:02,843
They had buddy each other,
which is why they have those antlers in 

2911
02:07:04,351 --> 02:07:08,280
the first place and then they walk up 
behind each other and lift their feet up

2912
02:07:08,281 --> 02:07:11,070
and kick each other in the balls.
I didn't see that constantly.

2913
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:13,940
They crash into each other though.
It's incredible dude.

2914
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:15,700
And they're so athletic.
I was up in Bisque,

2915
02:07:15,810 --> 02:07:19,440
big whiskey mountain in Wyoming and me 
and my buddy hiking and he discussed,

2916
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:22,470
he just pointed at and they were just 
seven of them.

2917
02:07:22,471 --> 02:07:25,840
I wrote with them and they are fucking 
huge there.

2918
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:26,870
Three hundred pounds.
Yeah.

2919
02:07:26,890 --> 02:07:28,260
Giant animals.
Yeah.

2920
02:07:28,261 --> 02:07:31,020
Look at these fuckers.
Look at what a cool animal too.

2921
02:07:31,021 --> 02:07:33,060
Like when you look at the things,
got some balls,

2922
02:07:33,130 --> 02:07:34,040
the horns on their head.

2923
02:07:36,690 --> 02:07:38,470
We're the sack.
Once they collide,

2924
02:07:38,530 --> 02:07:40,600
look at his sack on the right just 
swinging.

2925
02:07:40,630 --> 02:07:41,463
How crazy did they don't have any head 
trauma while they're probably dumb as 

2926
02:07:44,921 --> 02:07:46,840
fuck.
I mean seriously.

2927
02:07:46,841 --> 02:07:48,480
What do they have to do?
I smell mountain lion.

2928
02:07:48,890 --> 02:07:50,460
They're not doing algorithms.
Yeah,

2929
02:07:50,660 --> 02:07:53,500
their food is right in front of her 
fucking stupid face all the time.

2930
02:07:54,130 --> 02:07:56,800
Here it goes.
Boom.

2931
02:07:58,060 --> 02:08:01,000
And they snap into it too.
It's not like they're running into their

2932
02:08:01,001 --> 02:08:01,834
head down there.
They're putting all this extra emphasis 

2933
02:08:04,121 --> 02:08:04,954
in.
They're trying to make it uncomfortable 

2934
02:08:05,591 --> 02:08:06,424
for the other dude.
The crazy thing is when you see two 

2935
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:11,350
bucks and they're orange get tied up 
together.

2936
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:13,780
That's crazy.
But what's crazy about this is that they

2937
02:08:13,781 --> 02:08:16,150
pause afterwards so they must get their 
bell rung.

2938
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:19,570
Right?
But look,

2939
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:22,420
they just stand there and they back up 
like no one is like,

2940
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:23,433
bitch,
I hit you again and now hit you with 

2941
02:08:24,491 --> 02:08:25,630
again.
You're right,

2942
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:26,600
right.
Watch what they do.

2943
02:08:26,650 --> 02:08:28,180
Take a days,
didn't find a bucket,

2944
02:08:28,240 --> 02:08:30,550
must be lunches.
Boom.

2945
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:31,960
And then they built.
They're both like,

2946
02:08:31,961 --> 02:08:34,810
what is happening here?
Oh Jesus.

2947
02:08:34,811 --> 02:08:36,880
They turned to sideways.
Almost like the one.

2948
02:08:36,881 --> 02:08:39,410
Ignore the fact that the guys there.
Wow,

2949
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:44,590
look at this guy.
I wonder if they see cool shit.

2950
02:08:44,830 --> 02:08:45,663
Like,
look,

2951
02:08:47,590 --> 02:08:50,010
what else?
You butterflies and fairies.

2952
02:08:50,290 --> 02:08:52,660
Fairies.
His came up off the ground.

2953
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:56,230
Do they hit each other so hard,
but they just stop.

2954
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,153
Look,
they hit each other and then they just 

2955
02:08:57,821 --> 02:09:02,800
chill out.
When you're getting off on it,

2956
02:09:03,310 --> 02:09:05,860
it's like they're getting some kind of a
high.

2957
02:09:07,270 --> 02:09:08,103
I wonder if anybody's ever observed like
a wonder if there'd be a way to measure 

2958
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:15,170
like certain neuro transmitters on them,
like inaction,

2959
02:09:15,250 --> 02:09:19,060
like let them collide with each other 
and then figure out like what happens to

2960
02:09:19,061 --> 02:09:19,720
the brain.

2961
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:22,080
I guess there's some burst of happiness 
that comes out of that.

2962
02:09:22,150 --> 02:09:22,983
They talk about this in concussion where
the where they don't suffer from brain 

2963
02:09:26,861 --> 02:09:29,020
trauma or cte.
Actually they don't get.

2964
02:09:29,050 --> 02:09:30,640
You think that they would,
but male,

2965
02:09:31,090 --> 02:09:34,510
the male rams don't have science and so 
the brain is designed different than our

2966
02:09:34,511 --> 02:09:36,990
same as a woodpecker.
Woodpecker is brain and fuck it,

2967
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:38,913
they were in my garden are there.
The physiology of the skull was the 

2968
02:09:42,071 --> 02:09:42,904
both,
but the way their brain is attached to 

2969
02:09:44,741 --> 02:09:45,574
the inside of the skull is different.
Our brains like barely attached our 

2970
02:09:49,331 --> 02:09:50,164
brains.
Like someone who's like not worried 

2971
02:09:51,011 --> 02:09:52,480
about anything bad going wrong.
Well,

2972
02:09:52,490 --> 02:09:55,330
it's all gelatinous,
like our spinal cord goes brain and it's

2973
02:09:55,331 --> 02:09:57,790
all one big sort of gelatinous mass,
right?

2974
02:09:57,820 --> 02:10:00,940
Yes.
Well we're just not sturdy,

2975
02:10:01,710 --> 02:10:02,543
you know,
we're just so weak in comparison to 

2976
02:10:04,271 --> 02:10:06,390
other animals like you,
you know what it's like,

2977
02:10:06,391 --> 02:10:09,160
like you remember when you shot your 
deer in Montana and we were um,

2978
02:10:09,250 --> 02:10:13,120
we were cleaning it and addressing it 
and we're pulling on the skin.

2979
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:14,433
You're grabbing that which,
which a lot of people turn into jackets 

2980
02:10:18,311 --> 02:10:19,144
and pants and shit.
That's the native Americans just make 

2981
02:10:20,591 --> 02:10:23,350
clothes on them and you're grabbing that
hide and you're thinking,

2982
02:10:23,380 --> 02:10:25,300
oh,
this is so thick.

2983
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:26,193
Like this shit is strong.
You're pulling on it and then grab your 

2984
02:10:29,441 --> 02:10:32,650
bitch ass scale.
We have toilet paper scan,

2985
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:37,560
nick it and it's a process,
you know,

2986
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,070
while we were cleaning that animal,
what were,

2987
02:10:40,071 --> 02:10:41,960
um,
when you were doing the ravine comer.

2988
02:10:42,170 --> 02:10:43,003
I remember I sliced my finger open,
just touched my finger with the blade 

2989
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:48,260
and my fingers squirting all over the 
place.

2990
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:50,840
Meanwhile,
I've got to really dig in to get to this

2991
02:10:50,860 --> 02:10:51,693
meet.
I gotta really cut through all this 

2992
02:10:53,171 --> 02:10:54,260
skin.
It's so hard.

2993
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:56,660
Yeah,
and then you get an infection,

2994
02:10:56,810 --> 02:10:59,150
like if you got a blister on your foot 
and you're in the wilderness,

2995
02:10:59,210 --> 02:11:01,550
you know who you're fucked,
you're fucked.

2996
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:05,150
You got a lot of guys get because they 
were new boots that go,

2997
02:11:05,151 --> 02:11:05,984
oh,
I'll go through new boots going hiking 

2998
02:11:06,801 --> 02:11:08,120
is awesome.
And then your features get.

2999
02:11:08,150 --> 02:11:10,640
Fuck what bitches.
We are on the cold too.

3000
02:11:10,641 --> 02:11:15,020
We can't handle the call.
I've got some negative messages.

3001
02:11:15,030 --> 02:11:15,863
I member on twitter when the episode of 
mediator came out when you and I were 

3002
02:11:22,191 --> 02:11:23,720
uh,
in Montana and I was like,

3003
02:11:23,721 --> 02:11:25,300
don't blow into being comfortable.
It's the cool though.

3004
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:28,220
You focus.
This is poor woodsmanship.

3005
02:11:28,221 --> 02:11:29,054
Like,
Hey,

3006
02:11:29,120 --> 02:11:30,470
poor woodman's ship.
Let's.

3007
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:31,640
Hey,
I'm not a good woodsmen.

3008
02:11:31,641 --> 02:11:33,620
I'm a pussy.
It's 90 degrees outside.

3009
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:35,420
You don't want.
You just want me to suck it up.

3010
02:11:35,720 --> 02:11:37,280
Does that make you feel better if I just
suck it up?

3011
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:39,260
How about if I say it sucks and then I 
suck it up.

3012
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:44,280
Hunting.
Camping here.

3013
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:46,640
You shaking.
I can hear you shivering in the morning,

3014
02:11:46,641 --> 02:11:47,474
right here,
putting on your socks and you go get 

3015
02:11:50,710 --> 02:11:52,430
almost yourself camping.

3016
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:53,333
Blow.
Do you know what doesn't blow when the 

3017
02:11:55,041 --> 02:11:58,630
campaign is over the best?
Like you have the best showers ever.

3018
02:11:58,660 --> 02:12:00,740
We have great.
We have the greatest time to though.

3019
02:12:00,741 --> 02:12:05,000
It's fast.
So much fun because we laugh so hard.

3020
02:12:05,210 --> 02:12:06,830
I think Rinella wants to go to Mexico 
with us.

3021
02:12:06,860 --> 02:12:07,990
I want to go.
Okay.

3022
02:12:07,991 --> 02:12:09,440
Let's like you guys don't invite me 
anymore.

3023
02:12:09,441 --> 02:12:10,730
I want to do.
I told them.

3024
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:11,623
I told him the next one to come because 
we did one where we struck out we win a 

3025
02:12:15,500 --> 02:12:19,940
bow hunting for deer in Arizona.
Not Arizona.

3026
02:12:19,941 --> 02:12:21,450
Excuse me.
In Nevada last,

3027
02:12:21,470 --> 02:12:23,030
uh,
I think it was August.

3028
02:12:23,630 --> 02:12:26,960
Nothing struck out.
Was it cold or very hot?

3029
02:12:26,990 --> 02:12:28,520
Very hot.
100 degrees.

3030
02:12:28,630 --> 02:12:29,180
Real?
Yeah.

3031
02:12:29,180 --> 02:12:32,450
Yeah.
So hot that if you shot an animal,

3032
02:12:32,451 --> 02:12:33,284
there's a real concern about getting the
meat back to camp as quickly as 

3033
02:12:36,771 --> 02:12:37,790
possible.
Yeah.

3034
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:38,550
Yeah.

3035
02:12:38,550 --> 02:12:40,960
It's fucking hot.
Tj dillashaw Tommy.

3036
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,480
He was up in the mountains of a Nevada 
in Nevada.

3037
02:12:44,481 --> 02:12:46,230
And it was super cold though.
Yeah.

3038
02:12:46,280 --> 02:12:48,410
That was like,
what time of year?

3039
02:12:48,411 --> 02:12:49,244
Yeah,
he was probably in a different season 

3040
02:12:49,851 --> 02:12:51,180
and maybe for elk,
you know,

3041
02:12:51,181 --> 02:12:53,460
like he was a nice thing.
It was a deer.

3042
02:12:53,570 --> 02:12:54,110
Well,
there's a,

3043
02:12:54,110 --> 02:12:55,760
there's always a bunch of seasons too,
right?

3044
02:12:55,761 --> 02:12:58,160
There's like early archery,
which is what we were doing,

3045
02:12:58,161 --> 02:12:59,660
which is where the animals are in 
velvet,

3046
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:03,440
so they've just finished growing their 
horns and they're starting to scrape the

3047
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:06,440
velvet,
which is the outer skin off of the bone.

3048
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:07,513
I didn't even know until really recently
that antlers are literally bone and an 

3049
02:13:11,450 --> 02:13:13,910
elk antler.
Like those antlers right there.

3050
02:13:13,911 --> 02:13:18,290
That's the fastest growing bone in the 
wild kingdom.

3051
02:13:18,370 --> 02:13:21,560
Wow.
The fastest growing thing in nature,

3052
02:13:21,710 --> 02:13:26,710
those antlers fall off every year.
Every year they weigh 30 pounds.

3053
02:13:27,350 --> 02:13:29,030
Wow.
Holy Shit.

3054
02:13:29,090 --> 02:13:31,190
Yeah.
They're like 15 pounds each side.

3055
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:33,510
The bone and it grows in a couple of 
months.

3056
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:34,600
What?
Yup.

3057
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:36,300
Goes quick.
Yeah.

3058
02:13:36,550 --> 02:13:38,130
Like,
see if you could find a video.

3059
02:13:38,140 --> 02:13:39,300
Do you see any,
um,

3060
02:13:39,580 --> 02:13:40,413
uh,
growth of a elk antlers were when you 

3061
02:13:43,561 --> 02:13:45,660
were in Nevada,
like in 100 degree heat?

3062
02:13:45,661 --> 02:13:46,940
Did you see any other animals?
Okay.

3063
02:13:47,090 --> 02:13:48,540
Yeah.
Someone saw an elk.

3064
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:49,520
Um,
uh,

3065
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:51,870
we saw,
we saw some,

3066
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:53,880
a lot of like jack rabbits and stuff 
like that.

3067
02:13:53,881 --> 02:13:54,714
They have a lot of rabbits.
You have to be really careful with the 

3068
02:13:56,461 --> 02:13:57,440
rabbits too.
Like if you,

3069
02:13:57,441 --> 02:13:58,274
if you kill one and skin one,
they have little mites and shit that 

3070
02:14:01,321 --> 02:14:04,080
will give you infections that you can 
die from.

3071
02:14:04,130 --> 02:14:06,810
Lack,
like legitimately see antlers.

3072
02:14:06,811 --> 02:14:08,370
Well,
antlers are growing.

3073
02:14:08,371 --> 02:14:10,050
They're covered in fuzzy skin called 
velvet.

3074
02:14:10,051 --> 02:14:10,884
Yeah,
that's what they look like in their 

3075
02:14:11,041 --> 02:14:11,430
environment.

3076
02:14:11,430 --> 02:14:13,080
Is that what you still get that little 
quick look?

3077
02:14:13,081 --> 02:14:14,990
A quick as mass human growth hormone in 
it or.

3078
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:15,833
I mean like.
Yes,

3079
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:17,760
yes,
the velvet from the antlers.

3080
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:22,380
A lot of football players were taking it
because it actually lets you grow growth

3081
02:14:22,381 --> 02:14:23,131
hormone.
So look,

3082
02:14:23,131 --> 02:14:25,950
you could see it April eighth,
then the April Fifteenth,

3083
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:28,470
and then April 22nd.
Look how quick that Shit's growing.

3084
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:30,360
That's crazy.
That's crazy.

3085
02:14:30,361 --> 02:14:31,950
Seven days later.
It's longer.

3086
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:33,450
Look at that.
May sixth.

3087
02:14:33,480 --> 02:14:36,450
It's fucking gigantic now.
That's nuts.

3088
02:14:37,140 --> 02:14:38,370
Look at that.
May Thirteenth,

3089
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:41,130
May 20th a week late like a mushroom,
a week later.

3090
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:44,010
His past as a fucking mushroom.
That is crazy.

3091
02:14:44,820 --> 02:14:46,730
A week later after that and it's all 
value.

3092
02:14:46,770 --> 02:14:49,320
That's nuts.
That is nuts.

3093
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:51,270
July first.
Look at that just a couple of months.

3094
02:14:51,271 --> 02:14:53,100
July eighth,
July 15th.

3095
02:14:53,101 --> 02:14:55,080
Look at the size of that thing.
Okay.

3096
02:14:55,290 --> 02:14:56,123
This must be a commercial elk farm that 
we're looking at because these elk are 

3097
02:15:01,651 --> 02:15:02,484
so big,
like their antlers are so big that that 

3098
02:15:05,491 --> 02:15:08,310
seems like it seems like,
um,

3099
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:09,660
like they're feeding in something.

3100
02:15:09,660 --> 02:15:11,800
It'd be hard to get that many pictures 
of the same one too.

3101
02:15:11,860 --> 02:15:13,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

3102
02:15:13,141 --> 02:15:14,120
That must be.
So.

3103
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:16,740
Let me just pause.
Pause right there.

3104
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:17,490
Yeah,
it is.

3105
02:15:17,490 --> 02:15:21,030
If you saw that elk in the wild,
you would shut your fucking pants.

3106
02:15:21,031 --> 02:15:23,580
That would be the boulevard bowls.
If its antlers.

3107
02:15:23,581 --> 02:15:25,260
Look at the size of the antlers on that 
thing.

3108
02:15:25,290 --> 02:15:26,940
That thing has like one,
two,

3109
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:27,990
three,
four,

3110
02:15:27,991 --> 02:15:28,801
five,
six,

3111
02:15:28,801 --> 02:15:29,670
seven,
eight,

3112
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:33,180
nine points on one side.
And one,

3113
02:15:33,181 --> 02:15:34,410
two,
three,

3114
02:15:34,411 --> 02:15:35,280
four,
five,

3115
02:15:35,281 --> 02:15:36,360
six,
seven,

3116
02:15:36,570 --> 02:15:37,500
eight,
nine.

3117
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:40,000
It's a nine by nine.
That's crazy.

3118
02:15:40,010 --> 02:15:41,580
Craziest.
Not Have Antlers.

3119
02:15:41,930 --> 02:15:42,763
No.
They don't have antlers,

3120
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:44,820
but every now and then a dear female has
antlers.

3121
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:45,830
Hmm.
Yeah.

3122
02:15:45,830 --> 02:15:50,830
Some freak bitch just likes to fight 
fucking some bull dyke sort of dikey.

3123
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:54,360
Dykey doe just grows them.
Antlers.

3124
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:56,040
Yeah.
Some gunshot one recently.

3125
02:15:57,330 --> 02:15:59,130
And they were all confused.
It was white.

3126
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:01,920
It was a,
it was a female rather.

3127
02:16:01,921 --> 02:16:04,350
And had a antlers.
They're like,

3128
02:16:04,351 --> 02:16:06,380
what is this?
Yeah,

3129
02:16:06,390 --> 02:16:09,300
but that should grows every year.
People go shit on to Mexico.

3130
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:11,160
I don't know,
maybe deer.

3131
02:16:11,340 --> 02:16:13,560
There's a lot of deer in Mexico.
So Nora.

3132
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:16,230
So Nora has a lot of mule deer.
Dangerous though,

3133
02:16:16,231 --> 02:16:17,670
aren't there a bunch?
Don't be scared.

3134
02:16:19,930 --> 02:16:23,160
They're not going to fuck with you.
What you gotta worry about is uh,

3135
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:27,770
I mean if you would go to their towns 
and caused problems,

3136
02:16:27,771 --> 02:16:31,330
you went to just say no to drugs.
They're busy making drug money.

3137
02:16:31,710 --> 02:16:33,610
They don't have time to go looking for 
some asshole.

3138
02:16:33,611 --> 02:16:34,444
Shoot a deer.
And there's branches that you go to out 

3139
02:16:36,431 --> 02:16:39,650
there were there,
they'd normally they're hunting ranches.

3140
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:41,500
That's why people go there in the first 
place.

3141
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:42,873
And that would probably be like where 
you park your stuff and you drive in 

3142
02:16:45,911 --> 02:16:46,744
from Arizona to Cancun.
And one of the guys who's there and 

3143
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:50,950
wealth do guy,
and I said,

3144
02:16:51,220 --> 02:16:52,530
what about the cartels?
He goes,

3145
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:56,890
they own a lot of these resorts to your 
money for them,

3146
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:57,753
they don't worry about the cartels.
And I've talked to a guy with this 

3147
02:16:59,831 --> 02:17:02,740
amazing restaurant and I said,
what about the cartels?

3148
02:17:02,740 --> 02:17:05,000
And they said they'd come here and I 
said,

3149
02:17:05,001 --> 02:17:05,834
wait a minute.
This does show up in a bunch of SUV is 

3150
02:17:07,361 --> 02:17:08,320
they come,
they tip,

3151
02:17:08,350 --> 02:17:09,183
they say,
thanks.

3152
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:10,660
I go,
they don't like extort money.

3153
02:17:10,690 --> 02:17:11,523
No.
The only time that happens is if you're 

3154
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:13,293
selling drugs out of your restaurant.
If you're selling drugs out of your 

3155
02:17:16,151 --> 02:17:17,230
restaurant,
they want a piece.

3156
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:20,350
Otherwise you're fine.
It's all ingrained.

3157
02:17:20,351 --> 02:17:22,840
It's all like a whole business you say.
Yeah,

3158
02:17:22,841 --> 02:17:24,250
it's a business.
Yeah.

3159
02:17:24,310 --> 02:17:25,143
Um,
I was in Punta Mita and we took these 

3160
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:29,613
golf carts.
They let us take these golf carts to 

3161
02:17:31,361 --> 02:17:32,860
town.
We're staying at this resort.

3162
02:17:33,340 --> 02:17:34,091
And you,
you could,

3163
02:17:34,091 --> 02:17:39,091
you leave the resort and when you leave 
the resort there is a stark contrast.

3164
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:40,983
Yes sir.
From safety and beautifully manicured 

3165
02:17:43,751 --> 02:17:48,751
lawns and landscaped grounds to we get 
out.

3166
02:17:49,270 --> 02:17:50,103
We are maybe 100,
200 yards from the outside and we see a 

3167
02:17:54,881 --> 02:17:56,050
military base.

3168
02:17:56,320 --> 02:17:59,740
It's a very small military base with two
guys with bulletproof vests,

3169
02:17:59,770 --> 02:18:00,603
helmets on holding.
I don't know what kind of fucking high 

3170
02:18:02,441 --> 02:18:07,360
powered rifle are behind a metal plate 
that's attached to the top of a jeep.

3171
02:18:07,750 --> 02:18:12,750
So they literally area in like riot war 
type vehicle.

3172
02:18:13,121 --> 02:18:14,890
Yeah,
fully armed,

3173
02:18:15,010 --> 02:18:15,843
ready to go.
So if anything went wrong right over 

3174
02:18:17,951 --> 02:18:20,920
there,
they drive in so they're protecting this

3175
02:18:20,921 --> 02:18:23,230
resort and I realized like protective is
sword.

3176
02:18:23,260 --> 02:18:24,093
That's what it's for.
They're there to protect all these 

3177
02:18:27,100 --> 02:18:27,933
wealthy people from Europe and America 
and wherever the fly in stay at this 

3178
02:18:31,871 --> 02:18:34,030
resort.
And I was like Whoa,

3179
02:18:34,031 --> 02:18:38,290
this is crazy because it makes sense.
I mean why else would that be there?

3180
02:18:38,370 --> 02:18:41,650
It's there and they're like waiting 
outside the gate.

3181
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:43,073
There's a,
there's a,

3182
02:18:43,330 --> 02:18:44,163
there's a great deal to be said about 
having institutions you can trust like 

3183
02:18:48,791 --> 02:18:52,330
courts that can enforce contracts that 
are not corruptible.

3184
02:18:52,330 --> 02:18:54,130
So in this country,
if you buy a house,

3185
02:18:54,131 --> 02:18:56,050
that piece of paper actually means 
something.

3186
02:18:56,300 --> 02:18:59,890
And most countries not so much.
It's your private property,

3187
02:18:59,891 --> 02:19:03,610
but somebody with a bigger guy come and 
take it from me as we can decide you did

3188
02:19:03,611 --> 02:19:05,050
something wrong and they have to take 
it.

3189
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:05,913
Yeah,
and that is the fundamental difference 

3190
02:19:06,791 --> 02:19:09,490
between our countries still and a lot of
other countries,

3191
02:19:09,491 --> 02:19:11,200
including Mexico and someplace.
Well,

3192
02:19:11,201 --> 02:19:13,210
that's what happened to that McAfee guy 
in.

3193
02:19:13,420 --> 02:19:15,700
Where was it that he was at?
Was it Costa Rica?

3194
02:19:16,330 --> 02:19:17,380
Where was he?
No,

3195
02:19:17,500 --> 02:19:19,930
somewhere else that you remember.
That guy,

3196
02:19:19,931 --> 02:19:20,764
the McAfee guy that came up with that 
virus software and then he went bananas 

3197
02:19:23,501 --> 02:19:26,950
and moved to some other country,
some tropical country.

3198
02:19:27,530 --> 02:19:30,440
What happened to as well?
They accused him of murder.

3199
02:19:31,220 --> 02:19:34,880
Was it billy's?
They accused him of murder and he had to

3200
02:19:34,881 --> 02:19:37,730
flee the country and they took his land 
and he was like,

3201
02:19:37,731 --> 02:19:39,170
Hey,
they're their railroad in me.

3202
02:19:39,170 --> 02:19:41,840
I gotta get the fuck out of here.
We actually talked to him on the podcast

3203
02:19:41,841 --> 02:19:42,674
when he was on the Lam.
He called me up on the phone and I did 

3204
02:19:45,771 --> 02:19:49,160
an interview with him on the lamb.
It's what happens.

3205
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:50,113
Yeah,
he was a.

3206
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:51,860
He gets.
He's living in America now,

3207
02:19:51,861 --> 02:19:52,694
but he's like a bonafide wild man,
like he denied these reports that 

3208
02:19:56,290 --> 02:19:57,123
there's a forum where someone was taking
photos of method they were making and 

3209
02:20:04,041 --> 02:20:06,950
explaining how their re-engineering meth
and making it better.

3210
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:09,140
And uh,
they were saying that it was him,

3211
02:20:09,630 --> 02:20:10,950
that he was the one who was doing that.
He,

3212
02:20:10,960 --> 02:20:13,910
so he's in beliefs get some fucking lab 
in his backyard.

3213
02:20:13,911 --> 02:20:14,744
He denied the whole thing.
So I don't know if it's true or not 

3214
02:20:16,341 --> 02:20:18,740
true.
I think he said he was trolling like,

3215
02:20:18,741 --> 02:20:19,670
okay,
maybe.

3216
02:20:20,420 --> 02:20:21,500
Right.
Remember that Jamie.

3217
02:20:22,430 --> 02:20:24,380
It was something connected to like bath 
salts,

3218
02:20:24,381 --> 02:20:28,550
like he figured out how to reengineer 
bath salts and make them better people.

3219
02:20:28,550 --> 02:20:30,350
Can you know what's going to happen if 
you take.

3220
02:20:30,351 --> 02:20:31,184
Nobody took.
Nobody had a lot of problems and then 

3221
02:20:32,691 --> 02:20:35,420
took some meth and they got better.
Here's my question though.

3222
02:20:35,450 --> 02:20:37,790
How many people are doing math right?
And we just don't hear about it.

3223
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:40,400
Yeah.
Meth labs and dead dogs.

3224
02:20:40,401 --> 02:20:45,401
So the founder of McAfee antivirus went 
on the run and believes Meth,

3225
02:20:46,250 --> 02:20:48,830
meth labs.
And it was about the dogs.

3226
02:20:48,831 --> 02:20:52,280
When it say what?
Scroll back and dead dogs.

3227
02:20:52,310 --> 02:20:53,000
Oh,
okay.

3228
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,360
Dead Dogs.
I don't know the story.

3229
02:20:55,361 --> 02:20:57,890
He says he was trolling about the meth 
labs,

3230
02:20:58,280 --> 02:20:59,113
but it's entirely possible.
That dude was just part is as often 

3231
02:21:02,180 --> 02:21:03,013
believes somebody wind up accusing 
somebody of murder and I think they 

3232
02:21:06,981 --> 02:21:08,660
wanted to question him and he was like,
fuck,

3233
02:21:08,661 --> 02:21:11,690
you think I'm gonna?
Move back to America.

3234
02:21:11,691 --> 02:21:13,630
I tried this out.
It's not fun guys.

3235
02:21:14,290 --> 02:21:15,890
Yeah.
I'll just blog about you for a couple of

3236
02:21:15,891 --> 02:21:16,724
years.

3237
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:22,430
What's he do for money?
He started McAfee antivirus.

3238
02:21:22,431 --> 02:21:25,640
I'm sure he's got millions of dollars.
They took a lot of his cash though.

3239
02:21:25,641 --> 02:21:28,190
That's a huge problem.
That's the problem with Russia and a lot

3240
02:21:28,191 --> 02:21:29,024
of countries when when like the ruling 
elite has the power to do whatever they 

3241
02:21:32,331 --> 02:21:33,210
want,
including kill you.

3242
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:37,250
You guys take your house.
It's this double agent in England today.

3243
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:40,190
London.
He and his daughter are gravely ill.

3244
02:21:40,310 --> 02:21:41,220
Been poisoned.
Yeah.

3245
02:21:41,221 --> 02:21:43,790
There were.
There were secret agent against Russia,

3246
02:21:43,791 --> 02:21:44,420
right?
Yeah.

3247
02:21:44,420 --> 02:21:46,190
Double agents I guess.
Don't do that.

3248
02:21:46,670 --> 02:21:48,740
Well,
you're gonna you're gonna die.

3249
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:51,110
Yeah.
That seems like a bad job.

3250
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:55,340
Secret agent against Russia.
That's a risky fucking job.

3251
02:21:55,370 --> 02:21:56,540
Did you see it,
Chris?

3252
02:21:56,541 --> 02:21:57,291
Have you seen that?
Yes,

3253
02:21:57,291 --> 02:21:58,280
I have.
Boy.

3254
02:21:58,281 --> 02:22:01,730
One a Oscar for that Disney did and well
deserved.

3255
02:22:02,090 --> 02:22:03,980
Well deserved.
We know where that Russian scientists.

3256
02:22:03,981 --> 02:22:06,380
I love that guy.
That guy is under protection.

3257
02:22:06,530 --> 02:22:07,363
He is right now under protective custody
somewhere where they're worried about 

3258
02:22:11,661 --> 02:22:14,480
him being assassinated.
They they took.

3259
02:22:14,570 --> 02:22:18,350
Not only did they take all of his money,
they took away his wife's house.

3260
02:22:18,710 --> 02:22:19,301
They did?
Yeah.

3261
02:22:19,301 --> 02:22:20,780
They.
They're trying to turn his family.

3262
02:22:20,781 --> 02:22:21,614
Homeless.
I think they're trying to pressure him 

3263
02:22:24,411 --> 02:22:26,040
into going back to Russia and giving

3264
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:28,740
himself up by making his family 
essentially homeless.

3265
02:22:30,070 --> 02:22:30,903
Yeah.
They're putting tremendous pressure on 

3266
02:22:32,521 --> 02:22:34,950
him so he can't get his wife out or 
anything.

3267
02:22:34,951 --> 02:22:37,110
Or Gregory.
What is his last name?

3268
02:22:37,130 --> 02:22:40,200
Gagarin.
He doesn't as well,

3269
02:22:41,190 --> 02:22:44,250
but I would have gotten wiser 
apparently.

3270
02:22:44,710 --> 02:22:45,720
He.
She didn't want to listen.

3271
02:22:45,810 --> 02:22:48,780
She didn't want to come.
He was already out of the country and he

3272
02:22:48,781 --> 02:22:50,880
didn't.
She didn't want to listen to him and she

3273
02:22:50,881 --> 02:22:51,714
didn't understand that he had been.
They were listening to his phone calls 

3274
02:22:54,001 --> 02:22:54,834
and emails that she didn't have a way.
He didn't have a way of expressing to 

3275
02:22:57,061 --> 02:22:58,920
her like,
hey,

3276
02:22:58,921 --> 02:23:01,560
you've gotta get the fuck out now.
Like if you did that,

3277
02:23:01,561 --> 02:23:03,180
they would have just come and scooped 
her up.

3278
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:06,103
No due process.
Rod Shanoff Gregory watching off the 

3279
02:23:09,601 --> 02:23:11,130
head of the Russian anti-doping 
laboratory.

3280
02:23:11,131 --> 02:23:13,200
It's an amazing documentary folks.
If you haven't seen it,

3281
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:14,273
it's on Netflix man.
But it just shows you what it could be 

3282
02:23:17,431 --> 02:23:20,040
like in other countries.
They don't play by the rules.

3283
02:23:20,041 --> 02:23:22,740
There's no rules.
He who has the power makes the rules.

3284
02:23:22,741 --> 02:23:23,720
That's right.
You're,

3285
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:27,630
you're dealing with the mafia basically 
organized bad.

3286
02:23:28,490 --> 02:23:30,120
Yeah.
And there's a lot of people that love it

3287
02:23:30,121 --> 02:23:31,320
to be like that here.
Oh,

3288
02:23:31,321 --> 02:23:32,400
they would love it.
I know.

3289
02:23:32,550 --> 02:23:35,370
And they don't because they have no idea
of what history is about.

3290
02:23:35,460 --> 02:23:38,310
Here's the thing,
if you want to use this,

3291
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:39,720
if you,
if you,

3292
02:23:40,290 --> 02:23:41,123
if you want to be,
if you don't want to believe in things 

3293
02:23:43,591 --> 02:23:46,290
like due process,
right?

3294
02:23:46,750 --> 02:23:47,583
Um,
integrity of courts and all those 

3295
02:23:48,991 --> 02:23:49,890
things,
uh,

3296
02:23:50,130 --> 02:23:50,963
if you don't want to,
if you don't want to believe that you 

3297
02:23:53,761 --> 02:23:55,950
should have a right to criticize your 
government.

3298
02:23:57,330 --> 02:23:58,163
I know what works for you right now 
because the person in power is on your 

3299
02:24:01,321 --> 02:24:03,120
side,
but you're next.

3300
02:24:03,240 --> 02:24:04,073
You're next.
As soon as the tables flip and the 

3301
02:24:05,371 --> 02:24:08,490
table's always flip,
so you are historically ignorant.

3302
02:24:08,910 --> 02:24:11,910
There is a reason that the founding 
fathers thought through these things.

3303
02:24:11,940 --> 02:24:14,980
They came from tyranny and uh,
the,

3304
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:15,873
the genius of the founding fathers was 
there's those checks and balances and 

3305
02:24:18,631 --> 02:24:19,464
representative government.
And it's such a radical idea that our 

3306
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:26,580
leaders are basically are they serve at 
our whim?

3307
02:24:26,581 --> 02:24:27,414
Now that's all changing.
Lawrence lessig you need to have on the 

3308
02:24:30,121 --> 02:24:32,820
podcast who wrote republic last.
I talk about them all the time.

3309
02:24:33,180 --> 02:24:35,530
Lawrence lessig will tell you right now.
He's a,

3310
02:24:35,580 --> 02:24:37,490
he's a,
he's at Harvard University.

3311
02:24:37,491 --> 02:24:39,360
He's a law professor.
And he said,

3312
02:24:39,361 --> 02:24:44,361
your government does not represent.
You have the Gerrymander districts where

3313
02:24:44,780 --> 02:24:46,440
there are all these districts are 
gerrymandered.

3314
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:47,353
You know what that means.
So the congressional districts are 

3315
02:24:50,161 --> 02:24:50,994
essentially,
they're redrawn so that they favor one 

3316
02:24:55,921 --> 02:24:57,990
party or another.
Do you understand?

3317
02:24:58,430 --> 02:24:59,263
So demographics,
so a million Republicans in 

3318
02:25:01,891 --> 02:25:03,570
Massachusetts as well,
not vote.

3319
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:05,670
They're never going to win.
They're just not represented.

3320
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:06,533
Because the districts are so 
gerrymandered that it's always going to 

3321
02:25:09,871 --> 02:25:12,900
be typically a democrat.
That's one example.

3322
02:25:12,930 --> 02:25:17,930
Okay.
Of the 435 seats in Congress,

3323
02:25:19,110 --> 02:25:19,943
the ones that aren't chairman and the 
ones that are actually where your vote 

3324
02:25:21,721 --> 02:25:24,850
actually counts there,
about 35 of those seats,

3325
02:25:24,970 --> 02:25:26,560
about 35 of the 40,
35.

3326
02:25:26,561 --> 02:25:27,394
I think that's the number.
Just keep this in mind to every fucking 

3327
02:25:30,641 --> 02:25:31,474
congressmen that you know spends 30 to 
70 percent of his or her time calling 

3328
02:25:36,820 --> 02:25:41,820
for money raising funds and they do sent
30 to 70 percent of their time.

3329
02:25:43,030 --> 02:25:44,440
That's insane.
And they do it.

3330
02:25:44,441 --> 02:25:48,550
And this has been well documented in 
republic last and so damn much money.

3331
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:50,440
There are some very good books that I've
read on this.

3332
02:25:50,620 --> 02:25:53,350
I've had less sick on my podcast.
Why's he got to have him on because he's

3333
02:25:53,351 --> 02:25:54,910
a fucking important.
I'd be happy to.

3334
02:25:54,940 --> 02:25:55,773
He's so important to listen to.
And he had his spells name Lawrence 

3335
02:26:00,130 --> 02:26:05,130
lessig s l e s s I g and he does an 
amazing job.

3336
02:26:05,351 --> 02:26:07,690
He's got a great ted talk.
You can listen to her for 20 minutes.

3337
02:26:07,930 --> 02:26:08,763
That's all it is,
and just listen to him talk about how 

3338
02:26:10,691 --> 02:26:13,690
democracy doesn't work the way it does 
with money in politics now,

3339
02:26:13,960 --> 02:26:14,793
and he talks about campaign.
We just so when you didn't say campaign 

3340
02:26:16,481 --> 02:26:17,314
finance,
reform everybody's zones out that those 

3341
02:26:19,001 --> 02:26:20,290
words are exhausting.
I'm like,

3342
02:26:20,291 --> 02:26:21,124
oh Jesus.
But he opens the book with this fucking 

3343
02:26:24,041 --> 02:26:26,560
amazing,
thorough quote and he talks about if you

3344
02:26:26,561 --> 02:26:27,394
want to talk about the problems in this 
country and our democracy and this 

3345
02:26:30,191 --> 02:26:31,024
thorough quote is,
I see men everywhere hacking at the 

3346
02:26:32,801 --> 02:26:35,770
branches of evil while none are striking
at the root.

3347
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:38,150
It's a great fucking quote,
right?

3348
02:26:38,151 --> 02:26:39,670
Him Throw Hudson good ones.
Yes,

3349
02:26:39,671 --> 02:26:41,750
he had some good ones because that,
those,

3350
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:44,560
some of those data and my,
my other favorite mark twain quote,

3351
02:26:44,950 --> 02:26:45,783
a loyalty to my country,
always to my government only when it 

3352
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,930
deserves it.
It's two really cool quotes,

3353
02:26:49,931 --> 02:26:52,780
but you know,
he does a really good job of saying that

3354
02:26:52,781 --> 02:26:53,614
35 seats really matter and those are the
only ones that matter with those 

3355
02:26:56,980 --> 02:26:58,570
districts worth voting.
You know,

3356
02:26:58,650 --> 02:27:00,670
where it makes sense to vote,
where if you're,

3357
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:02,590
if you're a republican or a Democrat,
where that,

3358
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:06,640
where that to contested seat,
but then those,

3359
02:27:06,700 --> 02:27:08,530
those concussions,
congressional,

3360
02:27:08,620 --> 02:27:09,453
you know,
candidates or those ones were in Qa or 

3361
02:27:11,570 --> 02:27:12,880
in the,
in the seat's already.

3362
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,890
They have to raise money to stay in 
power.

3363
02:27:15,190 --> 02:27:16,023
So they're talking to their donors and 
their fundraisers are the ones that are 

3364
02:27:18,761 --> 02:27:19,594
telling them what kind of issues they 
better hit on if they want the big 

3365
02:27:22,871 --> 02:27:23,500
donors.

3366
02:27:23,500 --> 02:27:26,890
That's so crazy.
It's a crazy system.

3367
02:27:26,950 --> 02:27:27,783
You know what's interesting though,
the system has affected the place where 

3368
02:27:30,941 --> 02:27:31,774
we came from.
Like what if the United States didn't 

3369
02:27:34,090 --> 02:27:34,923
take off from Europe?
What if we didn't bail and start this 

3370
02:27:37,421 --> 02:27:39,670
thing up over here?
What would it be like over there?

3371
02:27:39,870 --> 02:27:42,990
Because what it was like over there was 
a bunch of kings and queens and shit and

3372
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:44,630
had been like that forever.
That's right.

3373
02:27:44,770 --> 02:27:47,950
And now now it's kind of,
they have a queen,

3374
02:27:47,951 --> 02:27:49,450
but it's bullshit.
You know,

3375
02:27:49,460 --> 02:27:51,190
there's one prince was getting married 
that,

3376
02:27:51,210 --> 02:27:52,900
you know,
people who seem to give a fuck about.

3377
02:27:53,110 --> 02:27:54,220
I don't get it.
You know,

3378
02:27:54,221 --> 02:27:56,680
George George Washington said right when
they wanted to make him king,

3379
02:27:56,950 --> 02:27:58,840
he said,
I didn't fight this revolutionary war to

3380
02:27:58,841 --> 02:27:59,674
become George the second and George 
George King George was the king over 

3381
02:28:03,341 --> 02:28:04,174
there,
and when King George found out that 

3382
02:28:06,251 --> 02:28:09,790
George Washington refuse to kingship and
said,

3383
02:28:10,060 --> 02:28:10,893
no,
I'm a president and I will serve a term 

3384
02:28:12,841 --> 02:28:15,000
and I'll go back to month Jello.

3385
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,140
Wherever he's from,
was that Jefferson or whatever,

3386
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:18,620
either way,
said or Mount Vernon.

3387
02:28:18,621 --> 02:28:19,454
And he said,
uh,

3388
02:28:20,570 --> 02:28:21,403
uh,
short came to our said if he said that 

3389
02:28:22,431 --> 02:28:26,120
he's the greatest man to airlift to be 
rejected power.

3390
02:28:26,180 --> 02:28:28,670
But that's what George Washington said.
I fought.

3391
02:28:29,030 --> 02:28:29,863
I fought against.
What's amazing is that it's affected 

3392
02:28:32,691 --> 02:28:33,524
their,
like the goal of this works better 

3393
02:28:35,960 --> 02:28:38,990
because it does,
but how did it set in over there?

3394
02:28:38,991 --> 02:28:39,824
That's what's fascinating.
Like how did it eventually they gave up 

3395
02:28:43,580 --> 02:28:46,970
power to sort of emulate the west.
Well,

3396
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:51,330
the British,
the British always had a tradition of so

3397
02:28:51,530 --> 02:28:55,370
way before the revolutionary war,
way before the American experiment.

3398
02:28:55,820 --> 02:28:56,653
There was always,
in fact the thing it started with Henry 

3399
02:28:58,371 --> 02:28:59,204
the eighth.
There was always a contentious debate 

3400
02:29:03,411 --> 02:29:06,740
about how much power the king should 
have versus parliament,

3401
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:09,950
how much power the king should have 
versus the landed gentry verse.

3402
02:29:11,300 --> 02:29:13,880
It was always that issue,
but it's kind of lyricists that the king

3403
02:29:13,881 --> 02:29:16,040
doesn't have to show any merit like 
they.

3404
02:29:16,090 --> 02:29:16,923
They didn't rise through the ranks by 
hacking their way through a river of 

3405
02:29:19,071 --> 02:29:20,210
enemy.
They didn't.

3406
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:21,073
They didn't just figure out a way to 
bring prosperity to the land and so 

3407
02:29:24,351 --> 02:29:26,360
voted them at as king.
Well actually,

3408
02:29:26,361 --> 02:29:28,700
it's actually fascinating that this 
small island,

3409
02:29:28,770 --> 02:29:29,603
the small island of Pale people,
basically controlled almost the entire 

3410
02:29:33,111 --> 02:29:34,970
world on.
One of the things that's given credit is

3411
02:29:34,971 --> 02:29:38,390
that the British had this sort of 
religious idea almost.

3412
02:29:38,540 --> 02:29:39,373
It was called the great chain of being 
and the great chain of being was you 

3413
02:29:42,021 --> 02:29:45,200
have God at the top,
king is second place,

3414
02:29:45,530 --> 02:29:50,000
then you have the aristocracy,
then you have the nobility,

3415
02:29:50,060 --> 02:29:52,520
the landed gentry,
and then the surface,

3416
02:29:52,780 --> 02:29:56,600
and if you and for you to aspire out of 
your place,

3417
02:29:56,601 --> 02:29:59,900
your,
your God given place for you to say,

3418
02:30:00,110 --> 02:30:04,130
I may be an aristocrat or Nobel or 
Atlanta Gentry,

3419
02:30:04,131 --> 02:30:05,210
but someday I'm going to be the king.

3420
02:30:05,420 --> 02:30:06,253
That would be considered fucking heresy.
That would be the equivalent of us 

3421
02:30:09,471 --> 02:30:10,304
saying,
I think white people are better than 

3422
02:30:11,541 --> 02:30:12,830
black people today.
I mean,

3423
02:30:12,831 --> 02:30:14,870
it would be to do that and use it as a 
quote.

3424
02:30:14,930 --> 02:30:15,700
Yeah,
exactly.

3425
02:30:15,700 --> 02:30:16,580
You're gonna get in trouble.
I know.

3426
02:30:16,581 --> 02:30:17,414
I know.
They're going to isolate him and say 

3427
02:30:17,931 --> 02:30:19,550
that with you.
You have to pause in between each one,

3428
02:30:19,551 --> 02:30:21,320
so in other words,
God to speak,

3429
02:30:21,350 --> 02:30:23,480
speaking.
You're right.

3430
02:30:23,481 --> 02:30:24,840
I worry about that stuff,
but you.

3431
02:30:24,850 --> 02:30:29,330
You would not do that.
But that created an incredible order and

3432
02:30:29,331 --> 02:30:32,540
it created a very,
very good system to get shit done.

3433
02:30:32,780 --> 02:30:36,170
When people all were in their place 
doing their duty.

3434
02:30:36,171 --> 02:30:38,570
It was very easy to organize,
right,

3435
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:43,600
but not to innovate changes like America
has done.

3436
02:30:44,960 --> 02:30:47,370
No,
but the Brits were vendors because they.

3437
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:48,233
They did fine,
but what I'm saying is they don't have 

3438
02:30:49,611 --> 02:30:52,790
the freedom that they had over here.

3439
02:30:52,790 --> 02:30:53,623
If you don't have caste system,
you have the ability to rise from the 

3440
02:30:56,241 --> 02:30:57,680
bottom to the top.
Now we're here.

3441
02:30:57,770 --> 02:30:58,730
That's right.
Like that.

3442
02:30:58,820 --> 02:31:03,200
That is what is most attractive about 
America as potential potential.

3443
02:31:03,230 --> 02:31:04,063
That's why we haven't had revolutions.
That's why we don't have the poor 

3444
02:31:06,171 --> 02:31:07,004
confiscating the wealth of the rich 
because a lot of for him to believe 

3445
02:31:09,231 --> 02:31:12,230
they're going to be rich.
That's a huge.

3446
02:31:12,231 --> 02:31:13,064
That's a huge issue.
Now I have a lot of friends that have 

3447
02:31:14,181 --> 02:31:15,140
come over from England,
man,

3448
02:31:15,141 --> 02:31:19,100
and they just talk about that,
like how you could actually do something

3449
02:31:19,110 --> 02:31:21,510
here and people are supportive.
Yeah.

3450
02:31:21,630 --> 02:31:23,430
They don't shoot you down.
Like he said,

3451
02:31:23,431 --> 02:31:25,460
there's a thing that happens over there 
where they.

3452
02:31:25,770 --> 02:31:26,603
They don't want to see anybody succeed.
They try to put you in your place and 

3453
02:31:29,461 --> 02:31:32,790
they try to downplay the possibility of 
your success.

3454
02:31:32,910 --> 02:31:33,300
Right.

3455
02:31:33,300 --> 02:31:33,960
Right.
To your face.

3456
02:31:33,960 --> 02:31:38,960
It's very gauche to try to aspire.
Scandinavia has the same issue.

3457
02:31:39,610 --> 02:31:41,370
It's it's old Europe thinking,
right?

3458
02:31:41,371 --> 02:31:41,870
It's,
it's,

3459
02:31:41,870 --> 02:31:43,590
it's,
it's got to be exhausting.

3460
02:31:43,650 --> 02:31:48,650
It's why when along a France started 
talking about taxing the rich,

3461
02:31:48,661 --> 02:31:49,494
75 percent of their income,
it was met with a great deal of support 

3462
02:31:52,831 --> 02:31:55,560
because it wasn't workable,
but it was,

3463
02:31:55,700 --> 02:31:56,533
you know,
there's always been a real suspicion 

3464
02:32:00,631 --> 02:32:05,490
Europe of people with too much money 
because they become aristocracy and they

3465
02:32:05,491 --> 02:32:06,570
become oppressive.
Well,

3466
02:32:07,010 --> 02:32:07,843
that's the echoed,
but what you're hearing today about the 

3467
02:32:09,271 --> 02:32:10,830
elite,
the one percenters,

3468
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:12,270
you know,
the,

3469
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:12,931
the,
the,

3470
02:32:12,931 --> 02:32:15,120
the problem with wealth inequality in 
this country,

3471
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:17,820
it's called Marxism wealth inequality,
man.

3472
02:32:18,270 --> 02:32:19,103
It's called.
It's called a march where we're dealing 

3473
02:32:21,211 --> 02:32:23,100
with cultural Marxism and,
and you know,

3474
02:32:24,270 --> 02:32:26,210
that's always going to be there.
It's always gonna be the,

3475
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:27,960
it's a very easy,
good guy,

3476
02:32:27,961 --> 02:32:28,794
bad guy thing.

3477
02:32:28,920 --> 02:32:29,753
What?
People don't realize that wealth is 

3478
02:32:30,391 --> 02:32:31,840
always changing,
so you,

3479
02:32:32,130 --> 02:32:33,630
you don't,
you don't start wealthy.

3480
02:32:33,631 --> 02:32:37,110
A lot of people started poor then that 
got wealthy than they lost their money.

3481
02:32:37,111 --> 02:32:39,240
They got wealthy again.
There is however,

3482
02:32:39,241 --> 02:32:42,990
a concentration of have a great deal of 
wealth and in very few hands,

3483
02:32:43,230 --> 02:32:44,280
you know,
if you look at Google,

3484
02:32:44,281 --> 02:32:49,281
Amazon and apple and facebook,
I think the only employ about 500,000

3485
02:32:50,041 --> 02:32:52,920
people total and they have so much 
wealth.

3486
02:32:52,921 --> 02:32:53,970
So you know,
the,

3487
02:32:53,971 --> 02:32:54,804
the,
the question is what do we do about 

3488
02:32:55,561 --> 02:32:57,090
universal income?
Yeah,

3489
02:32:57,091 --> 02:33:00,480
it's crazy and I think this is all going
to come to a head with Ai.

3490
02:33:00,810 --> 02:33:03,150
I really do.
I think things are going to be automated

3491
02:33:03,151 --> 02:33:05,220
in a way that nobody has a job.
Yeah,

3492
02:33:05,310 --> 02:33:07,380
I think it's going to eliminate all 
driving jobs.

3493
02:33:07,530 --> 02:33:08,363
I think that's within 20 years of our 
life we're going to be looking back at 

3494
02:33:10,530 --> 02:33:11,580
driving your own car.

3495
02:33:11,580 --> 02:33:13,530
The way we look back at drum brakes.
I know.

3496
02:33:13,531 --> 02:33:15,630
So now what,
what do we do with human question?

3497
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:17,910
Very good question.
With an outdated piece of machinery.

3498
02:33:18,210 --> 02:33:19,620
Very good question.
Like,

3499
02:33:19,621 --> 02:33:22,650
um,
is it manufacturing,

3500
02:33:22,760 --> 02:33:23,593
you know,
that we need robots for and maybe 

3501
02:33:25,141 --> 02:33:28,350
there's other things other than driving 
manufacturing and driving.

3502
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:33,560
Maybe there's other people will be to 
put your tray into a,

3503
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:35,490
you know thing.
Burger flipping robot.

3504
02:33:35,491 --> 02:33:37,380
Flippy starts shifted.
Kally Burger.

3505
02:33:37,770 --> 02:33:38,603
There you go.
You got a burger flipping robot so it 

3506
02:33:40,291 --> 02:33:41,124
was going to get a perfect burger.
You're not going to have some kid 

3507
02:33:42,151 --> 02:33:43,920
talking about pussy.
Forgetting about your burger.

3508
02:33:44,270 --> 02:33:45,840
You get to Overcook Burger.
Yeah,

3509
02:33:46,130 --> 02:33:47,400
right.
There you go.

3510
02:33:47,880 --> 02:33:50,820
So if that's the case,
then it seems to me that we are.

3511
02:33:51,180 --> 02:33:53,550
We have to figure out what to do with 
all this leisure time,

3512
02:33:53,551 --> 02:33:54,450
but we have to pay people.

3513
02:33:54,540 --> 02:33:56,010
It could be real weird man.
It can.

3514
02:33:56,070 --> 02:33:57,990
I think it's one of those things.
It's creeping up on us.

3515
02:33:57,991 --> 02:33:59,550
Show to like the Internet creeped up on 
us.

3516
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:00,593
Like the Internet came out of nowhere.
All of a sudden everyone had access to 

3517
02:34:04,710 --> 02:34:06,470
any answer to any question you ever 
wanted.

3518
02:34:06,480 --> 02:34:07,313
You could watch videos on anything.
You could learn how to do anything 

3519
02:34:10,021 --> 02:34:12,090
online.
I mean there's a youtube video where you

3520
02:34:12,091 --> 02:34:12,924
can learn basically how to crochet.
You could learn how to Tan your own 

3521
02:34:15,960 --> 02:34:18,190
leather.
You could learn how to build a bomb.

3522
02:34:18,230 --> 02:34:19,063
You can fucking do anything.
You can just constantly be taking in 

3523
02:34:22,081 --> 02:34:24,700
information.
That's just the beginning.

3524
02:34:24,730 --> 02:34:28,840
I think one day within the next 10,
20 years,

3525
02:34:28,970 --> 02:34:29,803
they are going to have everything 
automated before it's artificial 

3526
02:34:32,951 --> 02:34:33,784
intelligence.
It's just going to be in a super 

3527
02:34:34,961 --> 02:34:38,830
efficient robot that can do whatever 
task you program it to do.

3528
02:34:39,010 --> 02:34:40,540
It's going to be way better at it than 
people.

3529
02:34:40,541 --> 02:34:41,374
It'd be pointless to have a person do 
that thing and then we got to decide 

3530
02:34:43,571 --> 02:34:45,900
what to do with all these people and 
there's got to be.

3531
02:34:45,910 --> 02:34:46,743
It could be.
A lot of us are going to be a lot of 

3532
02:34:49,080 --> 02:34:50,200
clips.
Yeah,

3533
02:34:50,500 --> 02:34:52,190
so what do we do?
Is that what they're calling it?

3534
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:56,080
Forty seven percent of a cover of a 
magazine.

3535
02:34:56,530 --> 02:34:57,363
What is it?
Humility is the new smart is this book 

3536
02:34:58,780 --> 02:35:03,610
about this 47 percent of all jobs that 
we know of now,

3537
02:35:03,611 --> 02:35:06,400
at least in this country are going to be
obsolete in the next 20 years.

3538
02:35:06,550 --> 02:35:08,380
Do you think we'll adapt?
Yes.

3539
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:09,400
Human beings are.
Yeah,

3540
02:35:09,401 --> 02:35:12,330
we'll adaptable.
I hope we just get more creative.

3541
02:35:12,370 --> 02:35:13,203
I hope people start doing things more 
with their hands already are we already 

3542
02:35:17,351 --> 02:35:17,831
are.
I mean there's,

3543
02:35:17,831 --> 02:35:19,780
there's more access to expressing 
yourself.

3544
02:35:19,780 --> 02:35:20,613
The problem is it becomes like the call 
to the amateur where you just got a lot 

3545
02:35:22,421 --> 02:35:23,254
of bullshit out there,
but I do think that we will be in a 

3546
02:35:28,031 --> 02:35:29,300
place.
Well,

3547
02:35:29,320 --> 02:35:30,153
like,
like,

3548
02:35:30,340 --> 02:35:32,050
you know,
if you look at where our philosophy.

3549
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:32,681
So,
so,

3550
02:35:32,681 --> 02:35:34,920
uh,
what was it the rise of,

3551
02:35:34,990 --> 02:35:39,100
of European Western civilization.
What the fuck was it?

3552
02:35:39,640 --> 02:35:40,473
Oh,
uh,

3553
02:35:40,810 --> 02:35:41,643
anyway,
if you look at like how the Greeks were 

3554
02:35:44,051 --> 02:35:49,051
able to export timber wine and olive 
oil,

3555
02:35:50,730 --> 02:35:54,370
it gave their economy some money and 
they had leisure time.

3556
02:35:54,371 --> 02:35:55,204
They didn't have to live on subsistence.
They could trade for things that they 

3557
02:35:57,221 --> 02:35:58,990
needed as opposed to making them 
themselves.

3558
02:35:59,230 --> 02:36:00,063
So the Greece,
ancient Greece was fairly wealthy and 

3559
02:36:01,901 --> 02:36:05,740
comparison and it gave a large sector of
their population,

3560
02:36:05,741 --> 02:36:06,574
at least the Richard population time to 
do things like not be in the fields all 

3561
02:36:12,430 --> 02:36:13,930
day,
but rather time to sit around,

3562
02:36:13,960 --> 02:36:15,340
eat and think and talk.

3563
02:36:15,730 --> 02:36:16,563
Right?
Which,

3564
02:36:16,900 --> 02:36:17,733
sure.
Which is probably where a lot of like 

3565
02:36:19,691 --> 02:36:21,850
socrates and Plato and Aristotle 
benefited from.

3566
02:36:21,851 --> 02:36:22,570
Right?
Sure.

3567
02:36:22,570 --> 02:36:26,320
So you wonder like as as we get to a 
point where we don't have to so much,

3568
02:36:26,380 --> 02:36:30,490
it becomes very easy to keep our bodies 
in homeostasis,

3569
02:36:30,491 --> 02:36:31,324
right?
Keep our bodies when they're at the 

3570
02:36:32,201 --> 02:36:35,860
right temperature and we just need a 
certain amount of food and shelter and,

3571
02:36:36,130 --> 02:36:38,620
and then you've look a cheap 
entertainment is.

3572
02:36:38,621 --> 02:36:40,450
I mean look at Netflix man.
It's 10 bucks a month.

3573
02:36:40,451 --> 02:36:43,120
You can watch anything you want forever.
Sure.

3574
02:36:43,570 --> 02:36:46,840
So then like what do we do man?
What do we do with our time?

3575
02:36:47,230 --> 02:36:50,370
Well we,
we didn't have to think about what we're

3576
02:36:50,380 --> 02:36:54,280
going to do from 18,
20 to 2020.

3577
02:36:54,490 --> 02:36:55,323
We didn't have to think about it.
It just sort of happened and I think 

3578
02:36:57,041 --> 02:36:57,874
that's going to happen as well,
but I think we're going to have to 

3579
02:36:59,501 --> 02:36:59,980
adjust.

3580
02:36:59,980 --> 02:37:03,430
Obviously the advice we give to children
as far as what's necessary,

3581
02:37:03,431 --> 02:37:04,264
what's not necessarily tell them,
I don't know what to tell your kids 

3582
02:37:05,831 --> 02:37:06,670
either.
That's the thing.

3583
02:37:06,880 --> 02:37:08,620
They're going to have to figure it out 
as they go along,

3584
02:37:08,621 --> 02:37:10,600
but they got to be flexible.
You know,

3585
02:37:10,890 --> 02:37:11,723
and I also think,
and this is why I've been thinking this 

3586
02:37:13,780 --> 02:37:16,310
a lot lately,
I think we have to move.

3587
02:37:16,610 --> 02:37:17,443
I think California is over fucking 
populated and I think it's going to get 

3588
02:37:20,211 --> 02:37:23,270
to a point in our lifetime or it's not a
smart place to be.

3589
02:37:23,750 --> 02:37:24,650
Really.
Yeah.

3590
02:37:24,860 --> 02:37:26,840
This way too many people.
I mean,

3591
02:37:26,841 --> 02:37:28,640
you know,
you go to the airport all the time,

3592
02:37:29,030 --> 02:37:29,990
you know,
that drive.

3593
02:37:30,110 --> 02:37:32,120
I had to do it the other day at 8:00
in the morning,

3594
02:37:32,121 --> 02:37:34,160
I was like,
this is hilarious.

3595
02:37:34,340 --> 02:37:35,940
Or you'll get to a point where you don't
have to fly.

3596
02:37:35,990 --> 02:37:38,480
You want to fly.
You'll get to a point where that's true,

3597
02:37:38,481 --> 02:37:39,314
but the sheer number of people,
if anything goes wrong all in this one 

3598
02:37:42,711 --> 02:37:44,390
spot,
it's just not wise.

3599
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:46,340
It doesn't feel good.
Yeah.

3600
02:37:47,150 --> 02:37:49,490
I always feel unsafe.
It doesn't feel good.

3601
02:37:49,640 --> 02:37:51,500
It feels like people aren't that 
valuable.

3602
02:37:51,530 --> 02:37:52,363
They're everywhere.
There were infested with the a futurist 

3603
02:37:57,490 --> 02:37:59,480
who said,
you've got to learn how to learn,

3604
02:37:59,690 --> 02:38:00,890
unlearn,
and relearn.

3605
02:38:01,100 --> 02:38:03,650
And that's the only way we're going to 
survive in the 21st century.

3606
02:38:03,710 --> 02:38:04,543
I'm not really worried about pupils 
survive and I think we're going to be 

3607
02:38:06,921 --> 02:38:08,380
okay in that regard.
The lungs,

3608
02:38:08,390 --> 02:38:09,223
we don't get hit by anything like we 
don't get potent or we don't get hit by 

3609
02:38:12,111 --> 02:38:14,510
an asteroid or we don't get hit by a 
super volcano,

3610
02:38:14,550 --> 02:38:15,383
which are all.
All those things are actually really 

3611
02:38:16,791 --> 02:38:18,110
possible.
I mean,

3612
02:38:18,111 --> 02:38:20,000
no one wants to think that we can get 
attacked by Russia,

3613
02:38:20,001 --> 02:38:24,020
but for sure we can.
All sorts of weird scenarios can present

3614
02:38:24,021 --> 02:38:24,854
themselves in this wacky life with a 
bunch of things falling into place and 

3615
02:38:26,871 --> 02:38:29,230
the wrong way.
All of a sudden you got World War Two.

3616
02:38:29,270 --> 02:38:30,500
It's happened.
I mean,

3617
02:38:30,501 --> 02:38:34,340
that's just the nature of humans.
And if we deny the past,

3618
02:38:34,580 --> 02:38:36,110
we don't have that was then we're 
different.

3619
02:38:36,111 --> 02:38:37,820
Now.
If we don't look at this rationally,

3620
02:38:38,030 --> 02:38:40,910
we can realize how precarious we are 
now.

3621
02:38:40,911 --> 02:38:43,490
That is just one thing that we can kind 
of control.

3622
02:38:43,670 --> 02:38:47,600
Hopefully human beings can control their
impulses to fucking hit the button.

3623
02:38:49,850 --> 02:38:52,730
Now they have.
What's his name?

3624
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:53,953
Nassim Taleb talks about the Black Swan,
so know that there's always a black 

3625
02:38:58,581 --> 02:38:59,414
swan,
know that the aberration know that 

3626
02:39:00,980 --> 02:39:03,530
history is full of things you never saw 
coming.

3627
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:05,150
Hitler,
Hitler,

3628
02:39:05,220 --> 02:39:07,730
a financial crisis,
the housing crisis,

3629
02:39:07,731 --> 02:39:10,340
I mean it goes on and on and history is 
full of that.

3630
02:39:10,341 --> 02:39:11,174
Most wars start as a weekend skirmish 
and people kind of leave for the 

3631
02:39:15,500 --> 02:39:16,333
weekend,
leave all this stuff and it's going to 

3632
02:39:16,851 --> 02:39:17,900
be over.
And before you know it,

3633
02:39:17,901 --> 02:39:18,191
it,
it's,

3634
02:39:18,191 --> 02:39:20,390
it's a 30 year civil war that happened 
in Lebanon.

3635
02:39:20,391 --> 02:39:25,391
That's where tellabs from,
so that you've got to at least know that

3636
02:39:25,671 --> 02:39:26,840
you're going be able to predict the 
future,

3637
02:39:26,841 --> 02:39:27,674
but know that they're the unpredictable.
Always be present and we'll always take 

3638
02:39:31,310 --> 02:39:35,090
what you took to be reality and flip it 
on it's fucking head.

3639
02:39:35,390 --> 02:39:39,920
And I think robotics and I think ai are 
certainly,

3640
02:39:40,760 --> 02:39:42,050
you know,
that tidal wave.

3641
02:39:42,200 --> 02:39:43,033
Do you worry at all about super power 
struggles between the United States and 

3642
02:39:45,471 --> 02:39:46,304
China and United States and Russia?
Way less only because I think that 

3643
02:39:49,131 --> 02:39:54,080
there's less,
there's less profit in violent warfare.

3644
02:39:54,350 --> 02:39:56,690
Uh,
it just doesn't profit anybody this way,

3645
02:39:56,691 --> 02:39:59,330
more profit in trade and dealing with,
you know,

3646
02:39:59,480 --> 02:40:01,430
you're going to have issues like this 
tariff issue,

3647
02:40:01,431 --> 02:40:03,110
but for the most part,
the,

3648
02:40:03,200 --> 02:40:03,741
so,
so,

3649
02:40:03,741 --> 02:40:04,574
so the biggest advantage is that there 
isn't a whole lot of advantage for a 

3650
02:40:08,601 --> 02:40:13,601
country to take over territory because 
that's not what makes you

3651
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:14,873
wealthier.
So if Russia came in and took over 

3652
02:40:18,300 --> 02:40:19,133
silicon valley,
there's nothing that take off about 

3653
02:40:20,550 --> 02:40:21,870
doing that,
I think.

3654
02:40:21,871 --> 02:40:24,390
But that's typically what dropping a 
bomb somewhere.

3655
02:40:24,420 --> 02:40:25,253
What they're saying is essentially that 
they're not talking about invading the 

3656
02:40:28,380 --> 02:40:29,220
United States.
That's ridiculous.

3657
02:40:29,260 --> 02:40:30,510
Yeah.
They would never do that.

3658
02:40:30,511 --> 02:40:31,344
The real question is what unless they 
nuked us for why would they drop a bomb 

3659
02:40:34,140 --> 02:40:34,973
where there might be some reason why 
they feel backed into a corner to 

3660
02:40:38,910 --> 02:40:40,380
interest in the United States?
Sure.

3661
02:40:40,440 --> 02:40:41,273
Yeah.
It's not likely unless they feel like 

3662
02:40:42,541 --> 02:40:43,374
there was some way where they would 
benefit extremely well from having us 

3663
02:40:46,411 --> 02:40:47,244
debilitate it.
It's not likely because we would attack 

3664
02:40:49,711 --> 02:40:51,420
back and it's mutually assured 
destruction.

3665
02:40:51,421 --> 02:40:52,254
Right.
But the fact that a person could make 

3666
02:40:54,211 --> 02:40:55,044
the decision whether or not to do that 
or whether or not that's logical and 

3667
02:40:57,511 --> 02:41:00,810
you're relying on a person who's 
essentially a murderous dictator running

3668
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:03,960
this fucking crazy halfass government 
over there.

3669
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:05,730
I mean,
what is he doing over there?

3670
02:41:06,150 --> 02:41:09,580
I mean,
you just from what you know about Russia

3671
02:41:09,581 --> 02:41:13,680
state sponsored doping program with that
guy and went straight up to Putin,

3672
02:41:13,710 --> 02:41:15,090
everybody knew what the fuck they were 
doing.

3673
02:41:15,091 --> 02:41:16,320
They were doing it on purpose because 
like,

3674
02:41:16,730 --> 02:41:17,420
I mean,
there's,

3675
02:41:17,420 --> 02:41:20,850
that's a crazy country band.
It's crazy and it's 2018.

3676
02:41:20,860 --> 02:41:22,350
It's still crazy.
It's A.

3677
02:41:22,351 --> 02:41:23,184
Well,
it's run by the one idea which is might 

3678
02:41:25,441 --> 02:41:28,680
makes right that the male with the 
biggest club is the male that,

3679
02:41:28,730 --> 02:41:30,670
that calls all the shots.
My,

3680
02:41:30,710 --> 02:41:32,730
my.
That's a big concern with me.

3681
02:41:32,850 --> 02:41:33,683
Um,
but my real big concern are natural 

3682
02:41:35,401 --> 02:41:37,380
things,
pandemics,

3683
02:41:37,470 --> 02:41:39,300
pandemic,
virus or accidents,

3684
02:41:39,301 --> 02:41:43,260
nuclear accidents and earthquakes,
earthquakes.

3685
02:41:43,560 --> 02:41:45,330
Um,
the big one for me,

3686
02:41:45,331 --> 02:41:49,170
super volcano,
that is an inevitable reality that we're

3687
02:41:49,171 --> 02:41:50,004
going to have to face one day.
Whether it's 100 years from now or 10 

3688
02:41:52,351 --> 02:41:53,184
years from now.

3689
02:41:53,190 --> 02:41:55,830
Yellowstone is going to blow,
they don't know when,

3690
02:41:56,040 --> 02:41:59,910
but it could be anytime and it could 
take out the entire.

3691
02:42:00,060 --> 02:42:01,000
The whole continent.
Then.

3692
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:02,870
Yeah,
if the yellowstone blows,

3693
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:05,010
they say every six to 800,000
years.

3694
02:42:05,130 --> 02:42:09,090
It's a continent killer.
It just blows and everybody's fucked and

3695
02:42:09,150 --> 02:42:11,340
it last time it happened was 600,000
years ago,

3696
02:42:12,270 --> 02:42:13,103
so it might be 200,000
years before it happens again and who 

3697
02:42:15,121 --> 02:42:16,830
knows?
We might figure out how to drill hole in

3698
02:42:16,831 --> 02:42:20,850
there and pop it like Dr Pimple Popper.
They received that instagram page.

3699
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:22,500
Sure half.
She's drills a hole in there,

3700
02:42:22,501 --> 02:42:25,220
like a pimple on sports.
All that love out and maybe it's okay.

3701
02:42:25,270 --> 02:42:26,070
Get outta here.
Yeah,

3702
02:42:26,070 --> 02:42:26,903
maybe that'll keep it from blowing up,
but if it blows to the thousands of 

3703
02:42:30,660 --> 02:42:31,980
earthquakes every year,
thousands,

3704
02:42:32,490 --> 02:42:34,890
thousands,
just constantly moving and rumbling.

3705
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:35,753
It's just loose crust.
And underneath is Chai fantic reservoir 

3706
02:42:39,300 --> 02:42:42,330
of Melton Rock,
melted rock,

3707
02:42:42,630 --> 02:42:45,490
melted rock that shoots into the fucking
Scott giant,

3708
02:42:45,560 --> 02:42:47,070
very blood of the earth.

3709
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:48,061
Oh,
it's so big.

3710
02:42:48,061 --> 02:42:50,820
They didn't even know it was a volcano 
until like,

3711
02:42:51,390 --> 02:42:54,630
I think it was 20,
maybe 20 years ago,

3712
02:42:54,680 --> 02:42:58,260
they started doing overhead satellite 
photos and they're like,

3713
02:42:58,290 --> 02:42:59,770
oh Jesus.
And they,

3714
02:42:59,771 --> 02:43:00,604
they thought it was just like a hotbed 
of Geo solar activity or what it would 

3715
02:43:04,110 --> 02:43:05,040
be,
not geo solar,

3716
02:43:06,480 --> 02:43:08,430
geothermal,
geothermal activity,

3717
02:43:08,431 --> 02:43:09,264
you know,
they had an old faithful spray water up 

3718
02:43:10,411 --> 02:43:11,500
in the sky.
They realized,

3719
02:43:11,860 --> 02:43:12,693
oh,
this is something going on underneath 

3720
02:43:13,090 --> 02:43:16,060
the surface,
and then they get these satellite photos

3721
02:43:16,061 --> 02:43:18,130
and they realized,
Holy Shit,

3722
02:43:18,131 --> 02:43:20,350
this is a,
this is a crater.

3723
02:43:20,740 --> 02:43:21,573
This thing is a crater that used to be a
mountain had exploded and I want to say 

3724
02:43:26,561 --> 02:43:27,670
it.
Something like,

3725
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:31,780
how wide is the called?
I don't want to mess this up.

3726
02:43:32,410 --> 02:43:35,230
I want to say it's like 600 kilometers 
wide.

3727
02:43:35,320 --> 02:43:36,940
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

3728
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:37,833
It's an enormous.
We know is a molten lava as the 

3729
02:43:41,460 --> 02:43:43,600
coordinator of this.
A bunch of shit down then it's not good.

3730
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:46,410
What is it?
Okay,

3731
02:43:46,470 --> 02:43:47,081
got it.
Okay.

3732
02:43:47,081 --> 02:43:48,820
No,
it's 35 miles.

3733
02:43:48,850 --> 02:43:50,620
Fifty Mile Long.
Okay.

3734
02:43:50,700 --> 02:43:52,320
Currently has appeared that you can 
read.

3735
02:43:52,321 --> 02:43:53,880
There are so many different kinds of 
reality.

3736
02:43:53,881 --> 02:43:57,330
So the reality that that if you go up 
into the stars,

3737
02:43:57,331 --> 02:44:00,990
it's a different reality and if you go 
wait in the microscopic level,

3738
02:44:00,991 --> 02:44:03,810
it's a totally different reality.
Then you can go to the subatomic level.

3739
02:44:04,390 --> 02:44:07,120
Look at this.
The region's most recent caldera forming

3740
02:44:07,121 --> 02:44:09,400
eruption was 640,000
years ago,

3741
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:14,220
creating the 35 mile wide,
50 mile long yellowstone Caldera.

3742
02:44:14,230 --> 02:44:15,760
Okay.
I fucked up the distance,

3743
02:44:15,940 --> 02:44:17,440
but still,
that's pretty God damn big.

3744
02:44:17,650 --> 02:44:22,180
So a 50 mile long,
35 mile wide volcano.

3745
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:23,073
That just blows up to the point where 
the tops not there anymore and just 

3746
02:44:25,901 --> 02:44:30,400
shoots off shit a mile into the sky.
And then you get nuclear winter all over

3747
02:44:30,401 --> 02:44:32,410
the globe in anything even remotely 
near.

3748
02:44:32,411 --> 02:44:34,420
It gets cooked instantly.
Is that right?

3749
02:44:34,540 --> 02:44:35,410
Oh yeah.
You fucked.

3750
02:44:35,411 --> 02:44:36,700
So we're all dead.
Oh,

3751
02:44:36,701 --> 02:44:37,840
we're dead.
It's fuck.

3752
02:44:38,080 --> 02:44:40,990
We're dead as fuck.
If yellow's don't blows,

3753
02:44:41,140 --> 02:44:44,090
we don't have a chance that people will 
talk to the dikes.

3754
02:44:44,660 --> 02:44:45,493
I talk to that like Kinda like,
like they'll lose a leg of this bias to 

3755
02:44:47,811 --> 02:44:49,930
a shark or something or.
And they.

3756
02:44:49,931 --> 02:44:51,810
And they ended up dying like,
you know,

3757
02:44:51,830 --> 02:44:52,460
they,
they,

3758
02:44:52,460 --> 02:44:54,300
they pass out.
Um,

3759
02:44:55,040 --> 02:44:57,800
they all said that it was a super 
peaceful,

3760
02:44:58,330 --> 02:45:01,190
like they just got this overwhelming 
sense of peace and they were like,

3761
02:45:01,191 --> 02:45:02,030
oh,
I'm going to die now.

3762
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:05,720
Oh yeah.
It's the brain.

3763
02:45:05,721 --> 02:45:06,554
The brain's pumping out that dopamine 
and dimethyltryptamine and all these 

3764
02:45:09,771 --> 02:45:12,020
different things to try to transition 
you.

3765
02:45:12,830 --> 02:45:14,810
Yeah.
But like existence is a weird thing.

3766
02:45:14,811 --> 02:45:16,640
What do you think happens?
I don't know,

3767
02:45:16,641 --> 02:45:17,120
man.
Oh,

3768
02:45:17,120 --> 02:45:18,380
well,
when you go,

3769
02:45:18,470 --> 02:45:21,350
my feeling is that talking to this 
quantum physicists,

3770
02:45:21,351 --> 02:45:22,730
this bad ass dude,
um,

3771
02:45:23,210 --> 02:45:24,043
I feel like there must be this idea that
existence is a question of he was 

3772
02:45:31,701 --> 02:45:33,860
talking about existence is a question of
the question,

3773
02:45:33,910 --> 02:45:35,960
what question you,
you're asking or were you standing?

3774
02:45:36,520 --> 02:45:39,440
So there,
there are different forms of existence,

3775
02:45:39,441 --> 02:45:41,390
right?
So there are different forms of reality.

3776
02:45:41,810 --> 02:45:44,090
Like a,
there's the subatomic reality,

3777
02:45:44,091 --> 02:45:48,170
there's the Newtonian reality that you 
can measure and see we're here.

3778
02:45:48,320 --> 02:45:51,980
If I was looking at Los Angeles from a 
plane that's a different perspective.

3779
02:45:51,981 --> 02:45:54,530
It might be a different kind of reality.
And I think he,

3780
02:45:54,580 --> 02:45:55,413
he kinda like said most physicists,
he was trying to explain what existence 

3781
02:45:58,400 --> 02:46:00,860
is right and how it's meaningless.
And I was like,

3782
02:46:00,861 --> 02:46:03,770
what the fuck he talking about,
he's talking about mathematics.

3783
02:46:03,771 --> 02:46:04,820
And he said,
he said,

3784
02:46:04,821 --> 02:46:08,360
well,
this is a reality to us because of where

3785
02:46:08,361 --> 02:46:13,361
we are and the space time continuum that
we're occupying right now.

3786
02:46:14,720 --> 02:46:15,553
So we are here and all that you are 
experiencing may not may very well not 

3787
02:46:21,381 --> 02:46:25,100
even be a reality right over in this 
direction.

3788
02:46:26,020 --> 02:46:26,853
What the would mean.
Say when they sit around with legal 

3789
02:46:28,971 --> 02:46:29,804
papers all day,
we'll write a bunch of shit and nobody 

3790
02:46:31,671 --> 02:46:32,150
fucks up.

3791
02:46:32,150 --> 02:46:34,760
Well that's,
well,

3792
02:46:34,761 --> 02:46:36,080
that's what I mean.
And I said,

3793
02:46:36,081 --> 02:46:36,771
what's up?
I go,

3794
02:46:36,771 --> 02:46:37,604
what the fuck are you talking about?
And he said he's going to win a Nobel 

3795
02:46:40,131 --> 02:46:41,450
prize.
And he said,

3796
02:46:41,451 --> 02:46:43,640
I'm okay.
I guess the best way to put it,

3797
02:46:43,641 --> 02:46:48,641
as think of you having a virtual reality
goggles on and you know,

3798
02:46:49,761 --> 02:46:50,594
people just splashing water on you as 
you're in the water and you're getting 

3799
02:46:52,791 --> 02:46:53,624
rocked back and forth.
I guess that's the best way to describe 

3800
02:46:55,281 --> 02:46:57,740
what you,
what you consider to be your reality.

3801
02:46:58,640 --> 02:46:59,650
I was like,
all right,

3802
02:46:59,940 --> 02:47:01,250
all right.
Maybe,

3803
02:47:01,280 --> 02:47:03,020
I dunno.
Maybe,

3804
02:47:03,140 --> 02:47:03,973
maybe,
but they seem to be able to prove a lot 

3805
02:47:05,031 --> 02:47:10,031
of this in like what's fascinating to me
is I didn't know how to get into this,

3806
02:47:10,341 --> 02:47:11,174
but like he was talking about how 
electrons can communicate with each 

3807
02:47:13,491 --> 02:47:14,324
other.
I'm like got a sheet of metal and they 

3808
02:47:16,251 --> 02:47:16,550
don't.

3809
02:47:16,550 --> 02:47:19,970
They don't see each other like in terms 
of the actions are light years away,

3810
02:47:19,971 --> 02:47:23,400
but they completely all work together 
and he was talking about how to do.

3811
02:47:23,760 --> 02:47:26,650
There's a mathematical way of proving 
halls.

3812
02:47:26,651 --> 02:47:31,280
There is a mathematical sort of 
algorithm that proves that they are.

3813
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:34,460
The answer to that is that there an 
invisible conductor,

3814
02:47:34,490 --> 02:47:35,323
like something,
a higher intelligence and immersion 

3815
02:47:38,721 --> 02:47:39,554
intelligence is dictating that 
communication intelligence or order an 

3816
02:47:44,780 --> 02:47:46,160
order.
Right.

3817
02:47:46,161 --> 02:47:49,190
But not an intelligence as well.
So it tells us the wrong way to say it.

3818
02:47:49,191 --> 02:47:50,024
And he said that to me too,
because I sit intelligent and he said 

3819
02:47:51,201 --> 02:47:53,810
order and you're right.
So there's an order,

3820
02:47:53,811 --> 02:47:54,970
right?
So there's a,

3821
02:47:55,130 --> 02:47:57,550
there's an order to the chaos,
right?

3822
02:47:57,650 --> 02:47:59,840
So the way schools of fish,
but you know,

3823
02:47:59,841 --> 02:48:01,460
schools of fish and birds,
a bird,

3824
02:48:01,490 --> 02:48:03,560
guess what else behaves that way,
inert matter,

3825
02:48:03,890 --> 02:48:04,723
electrons.

3826
02:48:04,980 --> 02:48:07,940
That's one of the things that they think
is going on with birds.

3827
02:48:07,941 --> 02:48:08,774
It's one of the reasons why birds have 
some sort of internal compass and that 

3828
02:48:11,361 --> 02:48:15,380
they literally mentality.
They react to the poles of the earth.

3829
02:48:15,770 --> 02:48:20,000
Like they know when migrating birds,
they know which way to go.

3830
02:48:20,240 --> 02:48:21,073
Like they really do somehow or another,
but they also know not to fly into each 

3831
02:48:23,511 --> 02:48:24,344
other.
Like when you see them all flying 

3832
02:48:25,761 --> 02:48:28,700
together and they move in tandem,
it's insane.

3833
02:48:28,760 --> 02:48:30,470
It's insane.
It's gorgeous.

3834
02:48:30,620 --> 02:48:32,180
And you know,
your brain's the same way.

3835
02:48:32,181 --> 02:48:34,430
So the neurons,
there's no reason.

3836
02:48:34,431 --> 02:48:37,610
It makes no sense that the neurons.
So each neuron is just essentially an on

3837
02:48:37,611 --> 02:48:39,330
off switch or a,
you know,

3838
02:48:39,430 --> 02:48:42,770
it's a whatever it is.
But for whatever reason,

3839
02:48:42,771 --> 02:48:45,380
all of those neurons have self 
organized,

3840
02:48:46,370 --> 02:48:48,140
organized,
and they self organized.

3841
02:48:48,920 --> 02:48:51,260
Okay.
That's what's fascinating.

3842
02:48:51,500 --> 02:48:53,660
And the way your brain has self 
organized,

3843
02:48:53,690 --> 02:48:58,690
so has this sheet of metal and he kind 
of proved he sat around and I think he's

3844
02:48:59,961 --> 02:49:03,530
38 or 39 and he and he solved this,
this theorem called wholesale,

3845
02:49:03,590 --> 02:49:05,480
took them three years to make sure he 
was right.

3846
02:49:05,750 --> 02:49:08,000
Don't you think that happens?
There's like

3847
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:08,833
a,
like a big mass event like like mob 

3848
02:49:13,021 --> 02:49:15,150
mentality,
don't you think that's part of what what

3849
02:49:15,151 --> 02:49:19,590
is going on with mob mentality and that 
things happen and things can get chaotic

3850
02:49:19,591 --> 02:49:22,680
and people just go with it.
They'd go with it in mob and I think.

3851
02:49:23,370 --> 02:49:24,203
I think the origin of that is probably 
survival instincts in war that in war 

3852
02:49:29,100 --> 02:49:29,933
you have to accept unbelievably barbaric
reality and so you have to be able to 

3853
02:49:35,371 --> 02:49:38,130
slide into that wherever we're killing 
everybody with axes,

3854
02:49:38,131 --> 02:49:40,500
let's go and then everybody else is 
doing it.

3855
02:49:40,501 --> 02:49:41,334
I guess I'm in.
And then he started hacking people up 

3856
02:49:42,841 --> 02:49:46,900
where you would never do it by yourself 
if it was just totally up to you,

3857
02:49:47,250 --> 02:49:48,083
but you find yourself getting caught up 
in the way in the hive where the human 

3858
02:49:52,051 --> 02:49:54,660
hive is moving,
that all these people are moving towards

3859
02:49:54,661 --> 02:49:55,494
violence or moving towards chaos like 
people get wrapped up in these mob 

3860
02:49:59,401 --> 02:50:01,790
mentality moments in a very,
very bad.

3861
02:50:01,791 --> 02:50:01,980
Well

3862
02:50:01,980 --> 02:50:03,870
you can also go,
you can actually,

3863
02:50:04,200 --> 02:50:05,033
you can step back from that and actually
you can explain that actually when you 

3864
02:50:10,561 --> 02:50:11,394
look at bacteria,
certain bacteria and certain insect 

3865
02:50:14,811 --> 02:50:15,980
colonies.
And let me explain.

3866
02:50:16,410 --> 02:50:17,243
So somebody like Antonio Damasio who is 
a behavioral scientist who wrote a 

3867
02:50:22,951 --> 02:50:23,784
fucking great book but very dense,
called the strange order of things and 

3868
02:50:26,960 --> 02:50:31,960
he talks about how human beings behave 
in a certain way,

3869
02:50:32,460 --> 02:50:33,293
like their feelings are directly related
to their biology because their feelings 

3870
02:50:38,490 --> 02:50:40,890
are essentially the,
uh,

3871
02:50:41,010 --> 02:50:44,010
the voices or the mechanism by which you
know,

3872
02:50:44,011 --> 02:50:44,844
whether or not to bring your body back 
into homeostasis when it's out of 

3873
02:50:48,091 --> 02:50:51,420
homeostasis.
Homeodynamic actually stay right?

3874
02:50:51,421 --> 02:50:55,800
So in other words,
that mob is probably going in there with

3875
02:50:55,810 --> 02:51:00,810
access because they perceive the 
feelings are they perceive a threat from

3876
02:51:02,521 --> 02:51:03,354
that other group because that other 
group is going to take something from 

3877
02:51:05,491 --> 02:51:06,390
them,
okay,

3878
02:51:06,450 --> 02:51:09,150
it's going to either take their 
resources,

3879
02:51:09,151 --> 02:51:10,410
their children,
whatever it might be,

3880
02:51:10,411 --> 02:51:11,610
and take over their territory.

3881
02:51:11,800 --> 02:51:12,633
So,
so watch bacteria actually behave the 

3882
02:51:15,601 --> 02:51:19,650
exact same way and you can put bacteria 
into certain like,

3883
02:51:19,651 --> 02:51:20,484
um,
and there's a scientist who does this a 

3884
02:51:21,631 --> 02:51:23,520
lot.
You can put them into certain conditions

3885
02:51:23,521 --> 02:51:27,240
where the bacterial behave like that.
They'll do some fascinating things.

3886
02:51:27,720 --> 02:51:28,553
Not only will they fucking take over the
other bacteria and go out into an all 

3887
02:51:31,321 --> 02:51:34,110
out war and kill mercilessly the other 
bacteria,

3888
02:51:34,350 --> 02:51:37,200
but sometimes when they find they can't 
kill that bacteria,

3889
02:51:37,440 --> 02:51:39,540
they'll actually cooperate with that 
bacteria.

3890
02:51:40,290 --> 02:51:41,280
Now,
how about this?

3891
02:51:41,460 --> 02:51:42,293
Within the ranks of their own bacteria,
the bacteria that are not pulling their 

3892
02:51:45,751 --> 02:51:46,584
weight,
that tend to be lazier than the other 

3893
02:51:48,301 --> 02:51:50,760
bacteria that are the same.
They're the same species.

3894
02:51:51,480 --> 02:51:55,110
Those bacteria will be fucking shunned.
There'll be pushed out.

3895
02:51:55,560 --> 02:51:57,120
They will not.
People like people,

3896
02:51:57,580 --> 02:51:58,130
they're,
they're,

3897
02:51:58,130 --> 02:52:02,970
they're the weak link insects.
If you look at insect colonies,

3898
02:52:03,090 --> 02:52:05,950
they behave very much like human 
cultures do.

3899
02:52:06,400 --> 02:52:07,480
You got,
uh,

3900
02:52:07,750 --> 02:52:11,620
an aunt that's protecting the queen ant 
or a b that's protecting the Queen Bee.

3901
02:52:11,830 --> 02:52:16,830
You have soldiers that do the fighting.
You have workers that do the working and

3902
02:52:17,261 --> 02:52:21,100
they self organize in this incredible 
way and nobody's really.

3903
02:52:21,240 --> 02:52:23,290
No,
it's not like it's somebody.

3904
02:52:23,380 --> 02:52:24,213
It's not a top down thing.
It's sort of a genetically programmed 

3905
02:52:26,281 --> 02:52:29,530
thing,
but their behavior is very similar.

3906
02:52:29,890 --> 02:52:31,780
Their behavior.
So even with bacteria,

3907
02:52:31,960 --> 02:52:32,793
when they can't beat this bacteria,
they'll join forces with that bacteria 

3908
02:52:35,770 --> 02:52:39,250
to defeat the other bacteria that's 
weaker and it's fascinating.

3909
02:52:39,430 --> 02:52:40,263
So even on the uni cellular level,
you see striking similarities between 

3910
02:52:45,311 --> 02:52:49,600
humans and even bacteria.
Now add to that the fact that one,

3911
02:52:49,960 --> 02:52:50,793
only one in 10 of yourselves as a human 
being is actually human and the rest is 

3912
02:52:54,371 --> 02:52:58,870
bacteria back on it,
that you as a human might be the Patina.

3913
02:52:59,080 --> 02:53:02,980
You're just the Patina on a,
on a background of bacteria.

3914
02:53:03,550 --> 02:53:07,240
So maybe bacteria is dictating how the 
fuck you behave.

3915
02:53:07,300 --> 02:53:09,580
Well,
the bacteria is also the outside skin,

3916
02:53:09,640 --> 02:53:12,100
inside and outside skin.
Flora is incredibly important.

3917
02:53:12,220 --> 02:53:14,890
Yes.
That's why I always recommend people eat

3918
02:53:14,950 --> 02:53:18,010
probiotics is one of the things that 
helps you with diseases.

3919
02:53:18,070 --> 02:53:18,903
Um,
and then natural oil soaps that not non 

3920
02:53:21,761 --> 02:53:23,710
antibacterial soaps.
That's very important.

3921
02:53:23,770 --> 02:53:25,180
So,
so that's right.

3922
02:53:25,181 --> 02:53:27,760
So keeping your,
your biodome yeah.

3923
02:53:27,850 --> 02:53:28,683
In order,
which is the new science might also be 

3924
02:53:31,811 --> 02:53:34,480
dictating your very behavior because it 
does.

3925
02:53:34,600 --> 02:53:37,660
I think when I eat healthier and I eat a
lot of probiotics,

3926
02:53:37,661 --> 02:53:40,270
I feel more at ease.
I feel more comfortable.

3927
02:53:40,300 --> 02:53:41,133
I heard you have to be careful with 
probiotics because you can throw off 

3928
02:53:43,121 --> 02:53:45,220
your gut level two.
And what are you eating now?

3929
02:53:45,221 --> 02:53:46,650
I'm eating it.
Food Miles.

3930
02:53:46,870 --> 02:53:47,703
I've decided a long time ago that you 
can take some probiotic pills and stuff 

3931
02:53:52,001 --> 02:53:52,330
like that.

3932
02:53:52,330 --> 02:53:54,100
And I definitely take someone on the 
road.

3933
02:53:54,790 --> 02:53:56,580
I bring that on a total gut health 
because I'm,

3934
02:53:56,581 --> 02:53:57,580
I'm on the road.
I know what the fuck.

3935
02:53:57,800 --> 02:53:59,530
I want to make sure I'm getting good 
food.

3936
02:53:59,531 --> 02:54:02,410
But a mom at home,
I eat a lot of fermented vegetables.

3937
02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:03,840
I've been,
I've been to the,

3938
02:54:03,841 --> 02:54:04,674
a lot of that,
I eat Kimchi like almost everyday 

3939
02:54:06,450 --> 02:54:07,980
because you're an extremist and I know,
you know,

3940
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:10,240
but it's,
it is good if you feel good,

3941
02:54:10,330 --> 02:54:13,040
drink a lot of that shit.
That Kombucha is fucking phenomenal.

3942
02:54:13,041 --> 02:54:15,930
That gts Kombucha.
I heard a uh,

3943
02:54:16,590 --> 02:54:17,423
some oh,
somebody in my family got a endometrial 

3944
02:54:19,931 --> 02:54:24,931
cancer and the doctor said the surgeon 
who deals with this exclusively said,

3945
02:54:26,170 --> 02:54:27,720
do me a favor,
just don't drink these for awhile.

3946
02:54:28,220 --> 02:54:29,380
Whoa.
And she goes,

3947
02:54:29,381 --> 02:54:30,850
why?
And he said,

3948
02:54:30,910 --> 02:54:31,743
I can't prove this yet,
but I see a direct link between this 

3949
02:54:35,290 --> 02:54:38,620
type of cancer and women who drink a lot
of probiotic drinks like this.

3950
02:54:38,800 --> 02:54:40,120
No Shit.
Yes.

3951
02:54:40,420 --> 02:54:41,770
CV,
find anything on that.

3952
02:54:42,130 --> 02:54:45,760
Women drink probiotic drinks cause 
cancer.

3953
02:54:45,761 --> 02:54:49,140
And this is a women's drinks martinis.
Blowjobs.

3954
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:51,220
Put that all together.
Hey man,

3955
02:54:51,520 --> 02:54:53,650
come on dude.
That's too much.

3956
02:54:53,770 --> 02:54:56,050
Just kidding.
Just kidding.

3957
02:54:56,680 --> 02:54:58,750
That would be terrifying man.
If that was the case.

3958
02:54:59,520 --> 02:55:02,320
Well I would think maybe there's a 
certain level,

3959
02:55:02,530 --> 02:55:03,980
like if you,
a nutty person

3960
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:07,640
who drank like really powerful Kombucha 
all day.

3961
02:55:07,880 --> 02:55:09,480
Like all you drank is Kombucha.
Yeah.

3962
02:55:10,090 --> 02:55:12,800
Like your body might be overwhelmed,
extremist and anything,

3963
02:55:12,801 --> 02:55:14,210
right?
I mean you gotta have balance.

3964
02:55:15,260 --> 02:55:16,093
The question is this to what's the 
metric for how many vitamins you need 

3965
02:55:19,700 --> 02:55:21,320
and then on top of that,
if you have enough,

3966
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:26,540
what is adding more to that do?
Does it help you or doesn't do?

3967
02:55:26,541 --> 02:55:27,770
Nothing.
Does do harm.

3968
02:55:28,130 --> 02:55:28,963
Is it,
is it the same for you as it is for 

3969
02:55:31,581 --> 02:55:33,140
Brendan?
Is it the same for me?

3970
02:55:33,170 --> 02:55:34,003
Like how is there a US da when 
everybody's body so radically different 

3971
02:55:37,791 --> 02:55:38,624
size,
different know like w how come a 

3972
02:55:40,820 --> 02:55:42,680
thousand milligrams is good for this guy
and it's not good for him.

3973
02:55:43,610 --> 02:55:44,443
I think that there's a lot of people too
that are probably just not getting the 

3974
02:55:47,061 --> 02:55:50,450
right fucking combinations of food too,
you know,

3975
02:55:50,570 --> 02:55:55,570
like just need to experiment,
figure out what's the right combinations

3976
02:55:55,791 --> 02:55:56,624
of things for you.

3977
02:55:56,930 --> 02:55:59,600
Like that was what the whole gracie diet
was based on.

3978
02:55:59,930 --> 02:56:01,940
The gracie diet was based on,
um,

3979
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:05,850
you shouldn't eat certain foods and 
combination because the enzymes that are

3980
02:56:05,910 --> 02:56:10,000
to breakdown fruit or not good to mix 
with the enzymes that break down meat,

3981
02:56:10,060 --> 02:56:13,730
you should eat them separate from each 
other and like they had a bunch of whole

3982
02:56:14,120 --> 02:56:15,620
theories about that stuff.
What's your,

3983
02:56:15,630 --> 02:56:17,060
what do you,
what do you think if you,

3984
02:56:17,061 --> 02:56:21,050
if there were certain truths about diet 
after all this time,

3985
02:56:21,830 --> 02:56:22,820
like certain truths,
right?

3986
02:56:23,060 --> 02:56:26,090
Giant variations between human 
requirements.

3987
02:56:26,480 --> 02:56:27,313
That's what I found the truth.
I've stopped saying for a long time ago 

3988
02:56:30,051 --> 02:56:30,884
that you should do this.
One thing you should definitely do is 

3989
02:56:32,121 --> 02:56:33,030
eat healthy.
Right?

3990
02:56:33,380 --> 02:56:34,213
So what's eating healthy?
I don't think there's anything wrong 

3991
02:56:35,751 --> 02:56:36,584
unless you have some sort of a disease.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

3992
02:56:38,301 --> 02:56:40,850
with eating a bunch of green leafy 
vegetables.

3993
02:56:40,850 --> 02:56:42,410
I think that Shit's very important for 
you.

3994
02:56:42,490 --> 02:56:43,970
I do it.
I feel better when I do it.

3995
02:56:44,330 --> 02:56:46,880
My body feels like when I eat like a big
ass salad,

3996
02:56:46,881 --> 02:56:47,714
like a spinach salad,
my body was feeling like this was like 

3997
02:56:50,240 --> 02:56:51,270
he got it in there.
Yeah.

3998
02:56:51,460 --> 02:56:52,310
You like,
you got it in there.

3999
02:56:52,311 --> 02:56:53,630
That's what I was looking for.
I was looking for them.

4000
02:56:53,631 --> 02:56:57,110
Some of that green leafy stuff.
All those Fido nutrients that.

4001
02:56:57,170 --> 02:56:58,760
That to me,
that just.

4002
02:56:58,820 --> 02:57:01,640
It feels like my body jives with that.
Yep.

4003
02:57:02,030 --> 02:57:05,150
Elk Wild game.
Meat tastes better.

4004
02:57:05,151 --> 02:57:06,730
Feels differently.
Evolved.

4005
02:57:06,770 --> 02:57:08,450
It's different.
It's just different.

4006
02:57:08,480 --> 02:57:09,313
I know it is.
Everybody's been saying it forever and 

4007
02:57:10,761 --> 02:57:11,780
then want to eat it.
I go,

4008
02:57:11,840 --> 02:57:15,260
oh whew.
Like it gives you that salad thing times

4009
02:57:15,261 --> 02:57:16,094
five.
Right?

4010
02:57:16,220 --> 02:57:18,860
It's like woo.
Like when I eat a nice steak,

4011
02:57:18,861 --> 02:57:20,510
it feels good.
I like a nice steak,

4012
02:57:20,511 --> 02:57:21,890
but it's a lazy nice.

4013
02:57:22,220 --> 02:57:23,053
It's a lazy meat.
If I eat a cut into nice American corn 

4014
02:57:25,971 --> 02:57:28,790
fed steak tastes delicious,
but it's a lazy meat.

4015
02:57:29,120 --> 02:57:32,330
I cut into a piece of elk or go like,
oh,

4016
02:57:32,720 --> 02:57:35,180
it just rumbles somewhere.
Deepen your DNA.

4017
02:57:35,181 --> 02:57:37,680
You eat a deer.
If some of US eating deer,

4018
02:57:37,710 --> 02:57:38,543
you're.
Your body's like this motherfucker was 

4019
02:57:39,721 --> 02:57:40,554
sprinting all day.
You know there's something in there 

4020
02:57:42,501 --> 02:57:43,334
that's different.
You're eating an animal that has this 

4021
02:57:45,021 --> 02:57:47,190
vitality to it.
A wild Vitas,

4022
02:57:47,210 --> 02:57:48,043
Charles pollock.
When you know the strength coach talks 

4023
02:57:49,551 --> 02:57:50,570
about,
he goes,

4024
02:57:50,660 --> 02:57:52,190
for me,
I have to eat.

4025
02:57:52,880 --> 02:57:56,540
My favorite made is the longhorn 
antelope in the north of Canada.

4026
02:57:56,541 --> 02:57:58,400
They spent a lot of time running away 
from wolves,

4027
02:57:58,760 --> 02:58:02,070
so you know the glycogen in the is 
always there,

4028
02:58:02,070 --> 02:58:02,903
always have a high level.
There's a guy who like a meat fudge and 

4029
02:58:04,891 --> 02:58:06,600
of course you have to kill them from 
helicopter.

4030
02:58:06,601 --> 02:58:08,240
You can't.
You're not allowed to kill them anywhere

4031
02:58:08,241 --> 02:58:09,074
else.
So you should have a helicopter and 

4032
02:58:10,381 --> 02:58:12,430
there's only one meets two in Toronto 
that I go to.

4033
02:58:12,431 --> 02:58:13,021
I'm like,
all right,

4034
02:58:13,021 --> 02:58:14,250
dude,
take it easy,

4035
02:58:14,251 --> 02:58:16,950
but it does sound delicious.
Canada is antelope.

4036
02:58:16,951 --> 02:58:18,380
Maybe it's a type of antelope.
Yeah.

4037
02:58:18,540 --> 02:58:21,300
It's not Caribou now.
It's a type of antelope I think.

4038
02:58:21,420 --> 02:58:22,250
Wow.
Yeah,

4039
02:58:22,250 --> 02:58:23,083
and they're.
And they.

4040
02:58:23,330 --> 02:58:25,050
Maybe it's terrible,
but I think it's handled up.

4041
02:58:25,230 --> 02:58:25,921
Maybe.
I don't know,

4042
02:58:25,921 --> 02:58:29,700
but either way they run away from wolves
all day and the glycogen is really high.

4043
02:58:30,080 --> 02:58:33,710
We're going axis deer hunting.
Maybe that's going to Hawaii.

4044
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:35,350
It's probably not,
but acts,

4045
02:58:35,420 --> 02:58:36,253
deer,
they evolved in India running away from 

4046
02:58:38,661 --> 02:58:39,494
tigers.
They're an Asian deer and their natural 

4047
02:58:42,741 --> 02:58:43,580
enemies.
Tigers.

4048
02:58:43,940 --> 02:58:48,350
You have never seen an animal.
I shot a deer that was 40 yards away.

4049
02:58:48,740 --> 02:58:50,600
It looked at me.
I let the Arrow go.

4050
02:58:50,601 --> 02:58:54,650
By the time the Arrow got to it,
it was nowhere near where it was.

4051
02:58:55,340 --> 02:58:59,330
My Arrow goes 280 feet per second.
The Arrow,

4052
02:58:59,331 --> 02:59:01,910
once it left,
the string was headed towards that thing

4053
02:59:01,911 --> 02:59:04,910
at 280 feet per second.
And that deer was nowhere near it.

4054
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:06,360
Wow.
He was six,

4055
02:59:06,361 --> 02:59:07,540
seven,
six,

4056
02:59:07,550 --> 02:59:09,770
seven feet away,
like gone.

4057
02:59:09,771 --> 02:59:12,080
The Arrow went right into the bushes and
he was over there.

4058
02:59:13,550 --> 02:59:16,280
You ain't seen nothing like it.
They like from the Matrix.

4059
02:59:16,310 --> 02:59:17,143
Let me see an access to your big.
It's about a hundred and 30 to 150 

4060
02:59:22,131 --> 02:59:23,120
pounds for a big one.

4061
02:59:23,510 --> 02:59:24,343
Not quite as big as a white tail,
like a northern White Tilak we hunted 

4062
02:59:27,981 --> 02:59:28,814
in,
um,

4063
02:59:28,820 --> 02:59:29,653
that looks,
that looks a lot bigger than it really 

4064
02:59:31,401 --> 02:59:32,234
is.
There's like saving and find the 

4065
02:59:34,071 --> 02:59:35,300
picture.
The one that I shot,

4066
02:59:35,650 --> 02:59:38,300
it's online on Cameron Hanes,
instagram page.

4067
02:59:38,540 --> 02:59:40,250
I try to keep them off all the dead 
animals,

4068
02:59:40,251 --> 02:59:42,830
off my instagram page,
send them to my hunter friends.

4069
02:59:42,831 --> 02:59:44,540
They post them,
they get so mad.

4070
02:59:44,541 --> 02:59:46,610
Right.
They definitely get mad.

4071
02:59:46,970 --> 02:59:49,100
People get mad at me while they have a 
burger on their page.

4072
02:59:49,670 --> 02:59:53,690
People are just goofy.
That's my access to you that I shot.

4073
02:59:55,490 --> 02:59:58,190
That's amazing.
That's why that's in Hawaii.

4074
02:59:58,191 --> 03:00:00,320
That was why a lot of bugs?
No,

4075
03:00:00,560 --> 03:00:02,840
no little tiny ones.
Little bit,

4076
03:00:03,020 --> 03:00:04,370
but no.
What it really is,

4077
03:00:04,371 --> 03:00:07,340
is a,
a giant that's a pronghorn antelope.

4078
03:00:07,341 --> 03:00:09,320
That's a different animal.
It's not an antelope in Canada.

4079
03:00:09,830 --> 03:00:10,663
Okay.
Because I know they're in Montana and 

4080
03:00:11,991 --> 03:00:12,420
Wyoming.

4081
03:00:12,420 --> 03:00:13,670
One Shit.
Okay.

4082
03:00:13,671 --> 03:00:16,910
Oh,
they're on a coin down the south.

4083
03:00:18,350 --> 03:00:20,480
No,
I don't think so.

4084
03:00:20,570 --> 03:00:22,700
I don't think I've been.
No,

4085
03:00:23,090 --> 03:00:24,830
nope.
Just Texas.

4086
03:00:25,400 --> 03:00:27,910
Texas is not the south though.
Um,

4087
03:00:28,310 --> 03:00:30,460
so if we could organize something for 
Mexico urine,

4088
03:00:30,520 --> 03:00:32,840
I'm down.
I think it will use rifles.

4089
03:00:33,050 --> 03:00:34,800
So it'd be easy for me now.
Yeah,

4090
03:00:35,030 --> 03:00:36,800
you brought me that bowl.
Have yet to know.

4091
03:00:36,890 --> 03:00:39,890
But you can't go bow hunting without.
Especially if we go.

4092
03:00:39,891 --> 03:00:40,970
Yeah,
after dear.

4093
03:00:41,270 --> 03:00:44,120
Like I said with that thing one,
if you don't do it the right way,

4094
03:00:44,121 --> 03:00:46,730
yeah,
well it's just,

4095
03:00:47,390 --> 03:00:49,790
it's just something.
If you want to really do it,

4096
03:00:49,791 --> 03:00:52,850
you got to get obsessed with it the 
first time you do it.

4097
03:00:52,851 --> 03:00:54,410
It should be in a controlled 
environment,

4098
03:00:54,411 --> 03:00:55,244
like one of the first way would really 
be a good way would be wild pigs over 

4099
03:01:00,191 --> 03:01:01,024
bait because there's a lot of places 
where they try to eradicate these wild 

4100
03:01:03,941 --> 03:01:04,774
pigs so they have feeders and the 
feeders of go off in the wild pigs are 

4101
03:01:07,391 --> 03:01:08,224
almost like conditioned to go near the 
feeder and then when they go near the 

4102
03:01:11,291 --> 03:01:12,124
feeder,
you know exactly the distance because 

4103
03:01:13,211 --> 03:01:14,044
they're right underneath the feet are 
the feeders 20 yards away from you and 

4104
03:01:15,701 --> 03:01:19,570
you have a controlled shot and it's easy
and it's an animal that they must kill,

4105
03:01:19,810 --> 03:01:22,330
so there's not like a number of them 
that you can hunt.

4106
03:01:22,460 --> 03:01:24,220
Can't believe how many there are.
There's so many.

4107
03:01:24,460 --> 03:01:27,370
If you're in Texas,
they shoot them out of helicopters.

4108
03:01:27,371 --> 03:01:29,100
They fly around in helicopters and gun 
the.

4109
03:01:29,310 --> 03:01:31,180
They still say you can't shoot your way 
out of the problem.

4110
03:01:32,050 --> 03:01:32,883
Well,
they're doing their best to at least do 

4111
03:01:34,121 --> 03:01:36,640
something about it.
They're not going to shoot their way out

4112
03:01:36,641 --> 03:01:38,230
of the problem to the point of 
extinction.

4113
03:01:38,260 --> 03:01:39,910
They.
They move so quick.

4114
03:01:39,940 --> 03:01:41,590
There's so many of them.
They're smart,

4115
03:01:41,591 --> 03:01:42,424
tough as shit,
and they have litters three or four 

4116
03:01:43,541 --> 03:01:45,450
times a year.
Yeah.

4117
03:01:45,640 --> 03:01:50,640
They just constantly running around 
other moms.

4118
03:01:51,220 --> 03:01:52,053
What are the ones that I saw?
There's one eating out of a garbage can 

4119
03:01:53,921 --> 03:01:55,610
in the Asia.
Those got to be in.

4120
03:01:55,690 --> 03:01:58,960
Those are not wild pigs.
Those are wild boars.

4121
03:01:59,020 --> 03:01:59,853
Well,
board just means a male of female is a 

4122
03:02:02,380 --> 03:02:03,760
sound.
Some of those ones that you see,

4123
03:02:03,770 --> 03:02:04,820
they have got a razorback.

4124
03:02:04,880 --> 03:02:05,713
They're just like those.
They look like they're not as big as 

4125
03:02:08,531 --> 03:02:10,390
pigs,
but they're just fierce looking at.

4126
03:02:10,391 --> 03:02:12,040
Well,
it's just because the supply of food,

4127
03:02:12,041 --> 03:02:17,041
if they had as much pigs as wild boar,
right.

4128
03:02:17,081 --> 03:02:18,100
That's.
Oh yeah.

4129
03:02:18,101 --> 03:02:19,360
That's a real wild boar,
man.

4130
03:02:19,390 --> 03:02:22,030
That's a big ass pig.
That doesn't look like a real pig,

4131
03:02:22,100 --> 03:02:23,970
honestly.
That almost looks like a wart hog.

4132
03:02:24,180 --> 03:02:24,640
Yeah,
it does.

4133
03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:28,330
So big.
But here's the thing about wild pigs,

4134
03:02:28,331 --> 03:02:30,520
man.
This is something I learned from my pal,

4135
03:02:30,521 --> 03:02:33,370
Steve Rinella.
They are literally all the same animal,

4136
03:02:34,180 --> 03:02:37,300
wild pigs and domestic pigs.
They're the same animal.

4137
03:02:37,301 --> 03:02:38,134
It's called [inaudible].
They're all part of one gigantic 

4138
03:02:41,381 --> 03:02:42,214
species.
Poor capturing the size of that thing 

4139
03:02:46,660 --> 03:02:48,710
that looks like a power lifter.
Yeah.

4140
03:02:48,711 --> 03:02:49,544
The thing is it looks like it's like 400
pounds as long as snout is just tiny 

4141
03:02:52,721 --> 03:02:55,630
little bitch ass feet,
tiny feet.

4142
03:02:55,690 --> 03:02:56,710
That doesn't even seem real.

4143
03:02:56,860 --> 03:02:58,390
That seems like an animal.
And like,

4144
03:02:58,391 --> 03:03:00,370
um,
like a Beatles cartoon.

4145
03:03:00,371 --> 03:03:02,080
Like the nowhere man,
you know,

4146
03:03:02,081 --> 03:03:02,914
his proportions were all I think about 
John Jones and how skinny his legs are 

4147
03:03:05,831 --> 03:03:08,290
and what a fucking beast he is.
And then you look at his legs was like,

4148
03:03:08,291 --> 03:03:11,510
you got some pencil legs strong as shit 
too.

4149
03:03:12,210 --> 03:03:14,430
He's strong as shit with her legs.
Yeah.

4150
03:03:14,500 --> 03:03:16,810
Chael and said he'd be cradled him.
Said it was.

4151
03:03:16,930 --> 03:03:17,471
He did.
Didn't he?

4152
03:03:17,471 --> 03:03:19,180
Cradle Ryan Bader.
Yeah.

4153
03:03:19,410 --> 03:03:21,340
He smoked Ryan Bader.
He smoked.

4154
03:03:21,580 --> 03:03:22,870
He choked out.
Ryan Bader.

4155
03:03:22,871 --> 03:03:24,370
He smokes everybody.
He's.

4156
03:03:24,390 --> 03:03:25,223
He's ridiculously strong.
He's ridiculously strong too when it 

4157
03:03:27,491 --> 03:03:28,324
comes to like dead lifting and shit too.
He does a lot of power lifting now so 

4158
03:03:30,521 --> 03:03:32,350
strong when he was going to happen with 
him.

4159
03:03:32,680 --> 03:03:34,620
I don't know.
I want to see him fight Steve Bay.

4160
03:03:35,310 --> 03:03:38,200
I want to see them fight brock.
That's what I'm saying.

4161
03:03:38,230 --> 03:03:39,580
That's what Brendan and I were just 
saying.

4162
03:03:40,120 --> 03:03:43,360
This is the card.
Steep a DC.

4163
03:03:43,540 --> 03:03:46,780
John Jones,
Brock Floyd Mayweather,

4164
03:03:46,810 --> 03:03:51,760
cm punk Hoffeld dose on Joe's Tyron 
Woodley.

4165
03:03:51,800 --> 03:03:54,320
There's your paper view.
Here's your papers.

4166
03:03:54,380 --> 03:03:55,540
You.
You're welcome.

4167
03:03:55,541 --> 03:03:57,110
It's kind of crazy.
You will go.

4168
03:03:57,120 --> 03:03:58,130
I want to see the Khabib.

4169
03:03:58,160 --> 03:03:59,540
Tony Ferguson.
I'm very excited.

4170
03:03:59,541 --> 03:04:00,374
Once you come to Brooklyn,
what do you do in April seventh if I'm 

4171
03:04:02,391 --> 03:04:04,220
not.
Actually,

4172
03:04:04,221 --> 03:04:05,750
I shouldn't plug some dates.
Come on,

4173
03:04:05,751 --> 03:04:07,640
you can come see me this weekend.
Okay.

4174
03:04:08,990 --> 03:04:10,850
Alabama.
I'm a stand up live in Huntsville,

4175
03:04:10,851 --> 03:04:14,480
Alabama with April around April seventh 
because I'll be at the uh,

4176
03:04:14,540 --> 03:04:17,000
New York West Palm to New York,
West Palm Improv.

4177
03:04:17,030 --> 03:04:18,290
April twelfth,
13th.

4178
03:04:18,291 --> 03:04:19,150
14th,
everybody.

4179
03:04:19,210 --> 03:04:20,090
So come see me.
But wait,

4180
03:04:20,091 --> 03:04:20,771
April seventh.
Yeah,

4181
03:04:20,771 --> 03:04:22,670
I can come to.
Then I can come to that.

4182
03:04:22,671 --> 03:04:24,350
I think Brendan's going to be in town 
too,

4183
03:04:24,410 --> 03:04:26,410
so hold on.
It's doing something for up.

4184
03:04:26,610 --> 03:04:29,660
And then we'll do,
I'll do it.

4185
03:04:30,630 --> 03:04:31,580
I would come.
Alright.

4186
03:04:31,640 --> 03:04:32,920
We're coming for real,
uh,

4187
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:34,910
is going to be there too,
although I'm not supposed to say.

4188
03:04:35,060 --> 03:04:35,990
All right.
What's that?

4189
03:04:36,940 --> 03:04:37,820
Oh yeah.
Oh,

4190
03:04:37,821 --> 03:04:39,830
we'll leave with this.
This is a,

4191
03:04:40,220 --> 03:04:44,360
we have this thing we're doing.
Our friend Paulie tune is a,

4192
03:04:44,420 --> 03:04:45,253
a guy that is now taking.
We've hired him to take sections of the 

4193
03:04:50,631 --> 03:04:51,464
podcasts that are funny and turn them 
into these animated clips and they're 

4194
03:04:53,240 --> 03:04:55,520
fucking amazing.
He's really talented.

4195
03:04:55,940 --> 03:04:59,210
And you can get them on the powerful jre
youtube channel.

4196
03:04:59,570 --> 03:05:00,403
I think there's like a whole group of 
them is a playlist for them and he's 

4197
03:05:03,681 --> 03:05:06,320
made a ton of them and they're awesome.
So here's one,

4198
03:05:06,490 --> 03:05:10,130
it's a bad breath moment.
This is with a,

4199
03:05:10,190 --> 03:05:13,040
from a fight companion with Callan,
Jimmy Smith,

4200
03:05:13,130 --> 03:05:14,970
Eddie and you boom.
Right.

4201
03:05:15,020 --> 03:05:18,350
And we're going to wrap this up folks.
So that's it for now.

4202
03:05:18,380 --> 03:05:21,380
My next gigs are.
The only thing that I have where there's

4203
03:05:21,381 --> 03:05:25,280
some tickets available is New Orleans,
New Orleans,

4204
03:05:25,370 --> 03:05:26,540
which is,
um,

4205
03:05:26,990 --> 03:05:29,030
March 15th,
I think.

4206
03:05:29,330 --> 03:05:30,410
Said it.
Yes.

4207
03:05:30,770 --> 03:05:32,330
Thursday night,
March 15th.

4208
03:05:32,331 --> 03:05:34,130
There's some tickets available for the 
second show.

4209
03:05:34,131 --> 03:05:34,964
Everything else is.
I think it's down to like single 

4210
03:05:37,071 --> 03:05:37,851
tickets.
Oh,

4211
03:05:37,851 --> 03:05:40,430
the Ice House in Pasadena.
I still haven't put this on twitter.

4212
03:05:40,431 --> 03:05:43,850
I'm going to eventually,
but the 23rd and the 24th,

4213
03:05:44,140 --> 03:05:45,650
uh,
two shows each night.

4214
03:05:45,651 --> 03:05:47,780
Twenty third and the 24th was a Friday 
and a Saturday.

4215
03:05:47,781 --> 03:05:50,440
It's a rare weekend at the ice house.
But um,

4216
03:05:50,720 --> 03:05:53,100
Nashville or New Orleans.
Yeah.

4217
03:05:53,101 --> 03:05:55,610
I'm doing Nashville too.
But New Orleans in the 15th.

4218
03:05:56,320 --> 03:05:58,820
Did I say Nashville early on the 15th 
and I say New Orleans.

4219
03:05:58,940 --> 03:06:00,950
I said New Orleans,
New Orleans,

4220
03:06:01,130 --> 03:06:05,150
New Orleans on the 15th of March,
which is a little over a week from now.

4221
03:06:05,650 --> 03:06:08,270
And then the 30th of March.
Nashville,

4222
03:06:08,630 --> 03:06:10,460
two shows at the Ryman.
I think they're sold out.

4223
03:06:10,730 --> 03:06:11,563
And then two shows in Charlotte.
I don't know how many tickets left to 

4224
03:06:13,551 --> 03:06:15,660
that either kind of scenario.
It's 10 of Vr this week.

4225
03:06:15,700 --> 03:06:17,990
I mean stand up live and Moundsville,
Alabama.

4226
03:06:17,991 --> 03:06:18,500
Yeah.
Course.

4227
03:06:18,500 --> 03:06:20,240
What are you doing?
You're going to the wrong place.

4228
03:06:20,640 --> 03:06:22,530
I live in Huntsville,
Alabama,

4229
03:06:22,540 --> 03:06:26,050
so definitely a third this Thursday,
Friday,

4230
03:06:26,051 --> 03:06:29,410
Saturday,
and then West Palm Beach Improv,

4231
03:06:29,500 --> 03:06:30,940
April 12,
13,

4232
03:06:30,941 --> 03:06:31,460
14.

4233
03:06:31,460 --> 03:06:32,293
Maybe they should go to Brian 
[inaudible] dot com and there can make 

4234
03:06:35,360 --> 03:06:38,600
plans or set k.k.com.
All right.

4235
03:06:38,930 --> 03:06:42,490
This is a bad breath moment from jre 
tunes.

4236
03:06:42,830 --> 03:06:43,663
Thank you everybody and we'll be back 
tomorrow with the great and powerful 

4237
03:06:45,531 --> 03:06:47,090
John Dudley.
Maybe Brian could come.

4238
03:06:47,091 --> 03:06:47,924
We'll teach them how to shoot a bow.
I'll do it later by everybody and I had 

4239
03:06:50,121 --> 03:06:50,954
a cracked filling and they took the 
filling out and the fucking smell that 

4240
03:06:55,410 --> 03:06:56,130
came out of my

4241
03:06:56,130 --> 03:06:56,963
mouth.
I was like,

4242
03:06:56,970 --> 03:07:00,200
Holy Shit.
Because there was an infection.

4243
03:07:00,220 --> 03:07:01,053
I had to wind up getting a root canal.
It like you could hear it like pop 

4244
03:07:04,081 --> 03:07:07,460
through and then just this fucking shit 
breath that.

4245
03:07:07,710 --> 03:07:10,050
My father's,
my father's friend,

4246
03:07:10,080 --> 03:07:12,630
he was sleeping.
His wife said you have to go to.

4247
03:07:12,631 --> 03:07:13,464
The dentist said,
why does your breath is so out of 

4248
03:07:16,801 --> 03:07:21,480
control?
So apparently he had an abscess,

4249
03:07:21,481 --> 03:07:24,270
a sack of bacteria in the back of his 
mouth.

4250
03:07:24,540 --> 03:07:25,373
Well,
when they took the feeling out and they 

4251
03:07:27,720 --> 03:07:30,000
popped by accident,
the sac,

4252
03:07:30,870 --> 03:07:32,790
the nurse

4253
03:07:33,150 --> 03:07:38,150
through a fucking dentist moment,
a double vomit fest.

4254
03:07:52,550 --> 03:07:57,550
So did she puke on him or shouldn't be 
gone if she just puked went.

4255
03:08:01,990 --> 03:08:02,080
I

4256
03:08:02,080 --> 03:08:02,913
like that.
I never have the balls to tell someone 

4257
03:08:05,771 --> 03:08:06,604
their breaths.
Testing.

4258
03:08:07,610 --> 03:08:09,660
You work with them.
You have.

4259
03:08:09,730 --> 03:08:11,150
If you work with them,
you have to tell.

4260
03:08:11,170 --> 03:08:14,320
Friends would want them to tell me like,
your breath stinks.

4261
03:08:14,321 --> 03:08:16,930
I'm going to tell you that one cool 
thing about black people,

4262
03:08:16,960 --> 03:08:21,960
they'll tell you if Jesus Christ,
that's great.
