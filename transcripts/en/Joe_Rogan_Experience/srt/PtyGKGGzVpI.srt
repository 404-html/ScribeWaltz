1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,230
Three,

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,060
what is that other thing that you have 
saved their chunk.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,070
That's John Mayer.
What is it?

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,760
John Mayer won't sue us.
He likes us.

5
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:23,190
You could play.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,030
Let's start from scratch.
Why?

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,870
Because there can be three.
Three quarter was.

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,040
Oh,
okay.

9
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,000
Ready?
Go.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,330
Do you open your shell with a.
your body is wonderland.

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,920
Yes.
My body is one.

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,830
Don't hate the Joe Rogan experience.

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,710
Take three folks.
This is a fucking ghetto podcast.

14
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:57,351
All right.
This is how we rock it plays the 

15
00:00:57,351 --> 00:00:57,351
gentlemen,
the one and only Eddie F dot.

16
00:00:57,351 --> 00:00:57,950
Join us.
Ladies and gentlemen,

17
00:00:57,951 --> 00:00:59,860
please give it up for Eddie.
F I F

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,840
tea.
You can find him on twitter.

19
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:06,841
He's a hilarious standup comedian and a 
good pal of mine and we are sponsored by

20
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:08,800
the fleshlight.
Before we go any further,

21
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:14,190
go to Joe Rogan.net.
Click the link and type in the name 

22
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,611
Rogan and you get 15 percent off.
It's fogging a fabulous masturbation to 

23
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:17,611
have Mr.
Jeff,

24
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,110
I know you're not into those things.
You know you're a wholesome gentlemen.

25
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:25,111
You're not.
You're not the type of boy didn't go 

26
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:25,111
dry.
You go drive.

27
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:28,050
I go drive high.
I feel like when I put lube on my hand 

28
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:28,330
that I'm really committing to beating 
off and it's like,

29
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:31,240
what's wrong with me?
I ain't even do dry dry.

30
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,650
I feel like I can just get in and get 
out when I need to,

31
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,890
but when I do the flashlight,
you have to use a loop.

32
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:36,910
What did the flashlight.

33
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,010
Do they have like a celebrity vaginas 
and parsley.

34
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,280
Do they've thought of it all?
Yeah,

35
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,550
they have alien vaginas.
Like blue ones will go to your Avatar 

36
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:47,550
bitches,
but it's not avatar.

37
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,721
Of course.
It's alien as if his avatar that you 

38
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:53,731
have to pay.
I hung out with the flashlight guy last 

39
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:53,731
night.
I had a great time.

40
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:55,120
So a checklist.
Dow was cool.

41
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,920
Yeah.
If he's in town next week we're going to

42
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:57,350
get him.
He's.

43
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,960
He doesn't work for flush live anymore.
He quit.

44
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,460
He's opened up his own company.
Yeah,

45
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:02,170
that's right.
Did they have any like really,

46
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:05,170
really obscure,
like people like skewer porn stars?

47
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:10,290
I'm sure they do like weird.
I haven't looked through the catalog 

48
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:10,510
that you can like even though I'm a part
of the company,

49
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:13,120
I have not looked through the catalog 
and Luca,

50
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,470
you know,
like how I was flesh lighting with 

51
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,470
Roseanne.
Barr's vagina.

52
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,360
Oh God.
I bet she would do it.

53
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:22,510
Roseanne would probably do it.
Bet Rosie O'donnell might do it too,

54
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,180
but there's a lot of lesbians.
It would do it just to throw someone's 

55
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,610
out there using their vagina properly 
with Rosie's,

56
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,240
you'd have to take two flashlights and 
just rub them together.

57
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,280
Humana,
when Eddie,

58
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,380
you have to is also on a podcast called 
you guys call it talking shit.

59
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,590
Just talking shit with Jim Jefferies and
Jim Jefferies and Eddie eft.

60
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,270
And recently you guys get fucked because
I guess you swore in your itunes.

61
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:50,470
Yeah,
just start title.

62
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,830
Like we ask for the episode.
We had one title once that was called 

63
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,551
at.
I guess I'm going to have to eat this 

64
00:02:59,551 --> 00:02:59,551
dude's can't.
Was one of them.

65
00:02:59,551 --> 00:02:59,551
A

66
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,980
guy named Brian Mccarthy told us a story
about how he fucked a postop 

67
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,180
transsexual.
And uh,

68
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,280
he was telling the story about how she 
told them she used to be a dude before 

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,121
he fucked her before he fucked her,
but he said he was already like so into 

70
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:15,121
it that he was like,
all right,

71
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:19,860
and then they're having a threesome with
her and the dude's getting a blow job 

72
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,190
and he's like,
I'm looking at the back and he goes and 

73
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,351
I realize,
I guess I'm going to have to eat this 

74
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:27,130
dude's content.
And so we titled it that.

75
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,170
And so he did.
Yeah,

76
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:30,650
he did.
He tells his thoughts.

77
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,490
Episode three,
we still think it's our funniest.

78
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,470
What is this guy's name again?
Brian McCarthy.

79
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:37,990
He actually lives right out here.
He's Caroline McCarthy.

80
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:41,410
Is he a comic and sort of.
He hosts all these things.

81
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:44,680
He's got a show on a national lampoon 
radio.

82
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,860
He's the funniest.
If he came in a room with a bunch of 

83
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:49,860
comics,
every comic would go.

84
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,580
That's the funniest guy in the.
Really fucking wait a minute.

85
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:53,980
Where he would have joey is in that 
room.

86
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,980
I'm telling you,
you can't tell me there's a guy alive.

87
00:03:56,981 --> 00:04:01,030
It's funny than God is like a challenge.
So Joey nonsense as would,

88
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,920
uh,
would find this guy really.

89
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,320
Is he doing?
He's fucking weird.

90
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:06,560
There's no way to explain them.
Me,

91
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,600
I believe you,
but I don't believe he's funnier than 

92
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Joey Diaz.
I don't think that's possible.

93
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,790
He's like this fat guy that he's got a 
wife and kids normal life,

94
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:17,791
but he drilling worn on the side and he 
wears pink polo shirts and like white 

95
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,020
box and any,
you know,

96
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,920
he's got like the secret life that he 
leads and maybe you shouldn't be talking

97
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:28,921
about it on the podcast,
he told her story about smuggling weed 

98
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:31,921
from Jamaica in boom boxes and getting 
arrested and having to go to jail for 

99
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:32,350
two and a half months in Jamaica.

100
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,420
You know,
when he got to America and he went to 

101
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,451
jail.
He stayed in jail for two and a half 

102
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:41,011
months rather than tell.
Call his parents to get them bailed out 

103
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:44,401
because he didn't want his mom to know.
So it was just going to sit it out and 

104
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:45,680
let his mom think he was in Jamaica.
Oh my gosh.

105
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,890
Just a fucked up.
How old was he when this happened?

106
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:51,850
Like 20 years old and Oh my God,
I just rather take two and a half months

107
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:53,650
in prison.
Jesus Christ.

108
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,770
So he's just wired crazy yet and yeah,
that's a dude that will fucking keep a 

109
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,851
secret though.
That's a guy that I'd want working for 

110
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:02,851
me.
Yeah.

111
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:03,700
Two and a half months.
Two and a half months in jail instead of

112
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:06,280
telling his mom,
that's a fucking soldier right there.

113
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:11,310
Yeah.
We got to soldier Ryan Mccarthy in 

114
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,030
episode three of your podcasts and I 
need to hear this now and then we have 

115
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,000
on our show on our,
on our.

116
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,660
Yeah,
it's the.

117
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,160
It's one of the funniest stories you'll 
ever hear in your real.

118
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,660
I swear to God he's talking about 
fucking pussy and he's like,

119
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,100
oh,
it felt like frozen gummy bears.

120
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:28,270
That's the only thing I can describe 
because I think I can get rid of all the

121
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:30,990
dick meat.
They just like,

122
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,710
so I'm fucking.
And he goes,

123
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:37,770
no.
If I tell you this pussy just looked 

124
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:37,770
like a sloppy mess.
You should have seen the asshole,

125
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,210
but I couldn't get any friction in the 
pussy because I guess the doctor didn't 

126
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,481
do a good job,
so I'm pinching the pussy down and I'm 

127
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,840
fucking fuck this guy and his asshole.
He did everything.

128
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,700
Oh my God,
Jesus Christ and he's not even gay.

129
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,740
Not at all.
What the fuck is that about?

130
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:58,741
Told a story about how he led a guy 
below him one time because he was out 

131
00:05:58,741 --> 00:05:58,741
with this and he's.

132
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:02,770
He's not a good looking dude.
He was out with this like supermodel 

133
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:02,770
chick,
like really hot,

134
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,101
like famous playboy model and they were 
out and they were all doing coke and 

135
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:09,611
partying and she goes,
I'll let you do anything you want to me 

136
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:11,930
if you let this guy suck your Dick.
And he went,

137
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,120
well,
he goes,

138
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,770
what do I have to lose?
He goes,

139
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:16,880
if I,
if I like it,

140
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:21,140
then I'm gay because that solves a lot 
of problems for me in life.

141
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,120
He's like,
so I,

142
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:27,121
I let the guy do it,
and apparently the guy that did it's 

143
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,201
this famous writer for Vanity Fair and 
he let the guy suck his dick and he 

144
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:29,201
said,
as soon as he goes,

145
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:32,660
as soon as I felt the growth,
the stubble of his beard hit the base of

146
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:33,380
my cock.
He goes,

147
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:35,300
I've never gone so limp in my life.

148
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,410
And he goes,
I went,

149
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:41,330
I'm not gay now.
Did he fucked a chick afterwards?

150
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:42,640
He did.
Fuck the chick afterwards.

151
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,840
Maybe it was two coked up the fucker 
that night.

152
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:47,120
But he got to afterwards.
But so the guy went,

153
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,150
he went limp.
Meaning that he was hard before the 

154
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,150
stubble hit him.
He,

155
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,150
yeah,
he,

156
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,150
well,
he was,

157
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,070
she got them hard or something.
It was a crazy fucking story.

158
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,470
This dude knows how to party.
You know?

159
00:06:57,471 --> 00:07:02,471
He doesn't know.
I do not want to know how to put it as 

160
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:02,471
an idiot.
She sucked.

161
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:07,370
Had a guy suck his dick.
That's not a guy who knows how to party 

162
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:07,370
now.
Silly.

163
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,060
He's A.
I would rather not.

164
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,310
Fuck that girl has a lot of outrageous 
demands.

165
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:11,180
You know,
he's friends with,

166
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,090
he's friends with the dude who's a 
pretty amazing dude to me,

167
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:15,920
to that own consumption junction.

168
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,650
Do you remember that?
Yeah.

169
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,630
Well I went to Arizona to do crazy 
stuff,

170
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:23,190
right?
And assumption junctions all around.

171
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:28,410
I don't know if it is,
but the dude sold the website and made 

172
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:28,410
millions of dollars but powerful.
I went,

173
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,620
he's his best friend and I went to 
Arizona to Scottsdale or whatever tempe 

174
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:32,620
to do,
shows that.

175
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:32,840
Right.
And he's like,

176
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:35,000
let me call my friend.
He'll show up at your show.

177
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,390
So the dude shows up and sits down and 
starts telling me stories.

178
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,880
He's like,
so I'm in Panama and uh,

179
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,060
because you know,
there was no extradition laws there and 

180
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,911
we're doing mountains at coke and we're 
fucking these girls and I'm pissing all 

181
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:50,540
over them and we're all in the shower 
and there's eight girls for me and eight

182
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,010
girls from my friend.
And like,

183
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,540
these guys just live in a world that 
like they make movies about and shit and

184
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,580
they tell me these stories and I'm like,
are they just,

185
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,900
are they lying to me?

186
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,290
That impress me because comic and then 
you see his website and you go,

187
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,800
oh,
okay.

188
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,550
There's guys that are doing that.
There's Joe Frances type characters that

189
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:09,500
are like that guy.
He's notorious.

190
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:14,501
I think these guys are beyond that.
This deal now owns a website called 

191
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:15,110
sugar sugar.
It depends on how much money you have.

192
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:20,111
It really does.
If you're a sociopath and you got a 

193
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:20,111
billion dollars,
you can do some damage.

194
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:22,130
You can just go out there and,
and ball all the time.

195
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,720
I know some people that are,
uh,

196
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:28,721
that are big finance people that I'm 
back in the early days of the UFC and 

197
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:31,010
these guys are tons and tons of money 
and Scott was ugly as fuck.

198
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,990
This guy used to travel all over the 
country,

199
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:37,991
just banging chicks and he was always 
telling me stories about being in a 

200
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:40,361
Baeza and being in Russia and being here
and he's just a fucking 20th century 

201
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:42,680
baller.
Sky was just roaming the country.

202
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:45,070
Roman the world rather just everywhere 
party.

203
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:50,071
And it,
especially if you go to other countries 

204
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:50,071
in other countries,
people just fuck.

205
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,370
I toured.
America is a different rap and you know 

206
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,791
that because you,
you go to Australia like six months a 

207
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:57,791
year.
I toured

208
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:58,920
for about six years extensively around 
the world,

209
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:03,921
like doing China and Dubai and all these
South Africa and I saw some shady shady 

210
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:08,841
shit,
like you just start finding out like a 

211
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:11,180
prostitutes or $50 around the world.
And I was at a party one night in Dubai 

212
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,970
where everyone was so fucked up.
They went all,

213
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,980
let's get hookers.
And when we found out they were $50,

214
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,320
we're like,
well let's get 10 each.

215
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:25,150
And uh,
and it was like we didn't even want to 

216
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,150
have sex with them.
It was like,

217
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,650
just to like,
you know,

218
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:27,180
like it,
it started with,

219
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,980
well I don't know,
$50.

220
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,900
I just want them to come over and listen
to my jokes,

221
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,350
like creating your own audience.
And then everybody gets 10.

222
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:36,330
We've got 30 people.
That's a decent night in the are.

223
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,580
Imagine having the audience you could 
fuck afterwards.

224
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:39,270
That's awesome.

225
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,010
Well,
that's,

226
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,280
that's what happened.
I'm not going to mention the names 

227
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,280
because some of them are,
you know,

228
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,281
comics that work here,
but there was a whole bunch of comics 

229
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:49,281
and everybody started upping the ante.
They're like,

230
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:53,600
I want to just have them come over and 
fucking poor maple syrup all over them 

231
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,230
and we're going to swim around the 
fucking bathroom floor.

232
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,860
I want to put pringles on this is in 
Dubai.

233
00:09:57,861 --> 00:10:02,861
And Dubai's,
you guys worried about being arrested 

234
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:05,540
because they have some really crazy laws
from the minute we got there until the 

235
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,020
minute we left on this trip,
we were so fucked up that it never 

236
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,600
occurred to me.
And then my next trip over I,

237
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,800
I got fucked up in customs and thought I
was never coming back.

238
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,880
What happen?
I,

239
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:15,660
uh,
I had,

240
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:18,210
didn't have the proper visa and I tried 
to leave.

241
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,640
Uh,
I missed my flight because I was all 

242
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:23,640
fucked up.

243
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:23,640
Oh,
this was the same trip on the way back.

244
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,920
Uh,
I tried to leave like the other two 

245
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:27,920
comics got on,
got on the plane.

246
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,180
I missed the plane out of just being so 
fucked up.

247
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:33,840
I was in an Internet cafe,
I missed the plane and then I'm like,

248
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:38,841
fuck,
the next flight's not for 24 hours to 

249
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:38,850
London,
so I try to leave the airport to go to a

250
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:43,851
hotel and my,
my visa was only good for like three or 

251
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,570
four days or whatever.
So they checked my visa,

252
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:50,571
they checked my,
my passport and they didn't match 

253
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:53,310
because my agent fucked up.
Oh my agent put my,

254
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,760
put my middle name or something on it 
somehow.

255
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,020
And you easily could be a spy to look at
you and spy looked to him.

256
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,110
God just took my passport,
walked away and I never saw my passport 

257
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,330
again till 24 hours later.

258
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,480
So I'm without a passport.
The next thing I know I'm in an office 

259
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,150
next.
I know fucking strip search I've done.

260
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,130
They've gone through everything in my 
bag.

261
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,220
They've gone through my computer.
When they opened up my computer on my 

262
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,100
heart started beating so fast that I'm 
like,

263
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,450
because pornography is illegal in the 
Middle East and they tell you don't buy.

264
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,470
The guys are going to try to sell it to 
you in the streets.

265
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:26,830
Don't buy it,
they can be spa.

266
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,790
So they looked on an every folder and 
your laptop,

267
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,240
they opened my laptop and when they 
opened it I was just like,

268
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:36,390
this is it.
I'm going to be in fucking prison and be

269
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,430
a Middle Eastern prison for the rest of 
my life because I downloaded like 

270
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,430
topless carwash angels,
you know,

271
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,630
like that's like,
this is fucked.

272
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,960
And uh,
I had called my girlfriend at the time 

273
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,390
because they kept making me go like 
before they,

274
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:50,370
like Kinda held me in this office.

275
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,520
They were like,
go to this office and I'd go to this 

276
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:55,520
office,
they'd be like,

277
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,111
go to this office.
And I kept walking down hallways and 

278
00:11:58,111 --> 00:12:00,871
they're like,
go down this hallway and they make me 

279
00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:02,401
walk down this hallway and there's a big
sign that says like nobody is allowed 

280
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,440
past this point.
No one at all.

281
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:07,570
Like whatever in English it said it.
And I'm like,

282
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,360
they told me go down that hall and I'm 
like,

283
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,930
I'm not going down that hall.
Like they're setting me up or something.

284
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:15,910
Right.
So I call her on the phone,

285
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,070
I've got my cell phone.
Oh,

286
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,460
that's crazy.
And I go,

287
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,840
listen,
I'm in,

288
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,030
I'm fucked.
I don't know what's going on,

289
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:23,920
but if you don't hear from me in two 
hours,

290
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:26,470
call the US embassy and tell them I'm in
trouble.

291
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,100
I said something's fucked up here.
And Dubai's supposed to be like the most

292
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:31,820
progressive place in the world.
What?

293
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,870
But I know it's not in the world,
but I mean in the middle of the Middle 

294
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,690
East countries,
just because they want the money.

295
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,750
Exactly.
Want tourism and need to be the biggest 

296
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:42,750
of the desert.
Yeah.

297
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,871
They look the other way.
You see shit like Russian hookers 

298
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:46,210
barbecuing sausages on the beach like 
topless.

299
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,470
And you're like,
wait a minute,

300
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,800
there's Muslim.
Come.

301
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,890
Yeah,
tried it.

302
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,900
People been arrested.
They were making out there.

303
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:55,050
So it is just subjective.
They decide when to enforce with sex and

304
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:55,770
the city,
wasn't it?

305
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,720
No,
no it was real.

306
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,960
Real couple real.
A couple of weeks.

307
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,880
Weird fucking shit.
Like we had,

308
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,640
we had drinks,
beers on our van and uh,

309
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:07,641
I was over there another time shooting a
documentary and we had beers on the van 

310
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:08,180
after we shot one night and we had a,
uh,

311
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,030
a female like that worked for the,
for the Emirates with us.

312
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,150
And the next day we find out like we're 
in big trouble.

313
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:17,310
We drank around a female.
Uh,

314
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,930
we were swearing,
uh,

315
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,390
there was all kinds of shit in there.
Like they're like,

316
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:24,540
you broke every,
like sharia law possible,

317
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,060
don't you fuck those evidence of this?
Well,

318
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,930
it was kind of like I was over there 
with like a guy who's really his,

319
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,860
his father is like the attorney for the 
Emirates.

320
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,240
And so it was Kinda like,
you guys are okay but don't fuck up 

321
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,110
again like you.
So do you have a mark against you now?

322
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,940
So if you go to Dubai now not,
I'm not,

323
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:50,030
I'm never going again.
We filmed one thing where I put on a 

324
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,720
dish dash,
which is the Islamic will,

325
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:56,721
not Islamic,
but just the garb that they were in 

326
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:58,260
Dubai and you know,
it's the white gown and the hat and they

327
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,800
gave me one of those when I did the UFC 
and I with abby.

328
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:05,930
Yeah.
And a buddy of mine just wore them 

329
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,311
around town.
We thought it was kind of funny and 

330
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:07,311
we're just.
And we kept asking.

331
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:07,311
People were like,
well,

332
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:07,560
we're okay,
right?

333
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:09,030
We're not breaking any law.
And they're like,

334
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:09,330
no,
no,

335
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:12,030
it's not religious.
It's just the clothing that people wear.

336
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,480
And then the girl that worked for the 
Emirates left the Emirates and sent me 

337
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,280
an email telling me that there were 
spies watching us the whole time.

338
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,230
I was like,
fuck this shit.

339
00:14:22,231 --> 00:14:23,860
I don't need to go back there.
Yeah.

340
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,330
Who was,
who's

341
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,880
there was telling us.
Pete Johansen was telling us that he did

342
00:14:26,881 --> 00:14:31,881
gigs in Dubai and there was members of 
the secret police would sit in the 

343
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,490
audience and watch.
Yeah,

344
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:33,800
yeah,
yeah.

345
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,450
And it will be in the front row and 
they'd be totally obvious,

346
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:41,451
I think is actually,
I don't remember if he said the front 

347
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:41,451
row,
he might've said that back row,

348
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:45,080
whatever he said.
They were super obvious and they were 

349
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,080
standing there with their arms crossed 
just staring at him the whole time.

350
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,170
So He's trying not to cross any lines.
Try not to say anything.

351
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,380
The lines.
You can't cuss.

352
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:49,790
No,
no.

353
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,540
You can say they don't want you making 
fun of Islam.

354
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,730
They don't remember when we had.
What's his face,

355
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:01,090
how sparks.
And he was talking about almost getting 

356
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,101
arrested who's doing gigs with Jon 
Lovitz and he made the mistake of 

357
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:05,140
calling the speaking of the.

358
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,490
One of the sultans or one of the shakes 
and he called them.

359
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,860
What do you call Ms Dot Moore?
Ms Dot Moore.

360
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,950
Ms Dot Moore.
I think he said that.

361
00:15:14,951 --> 00:15:19,951
I called them the French name for Mr.
and apparently one guy got incredibly 

362
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:22,390
offended and called the religious police
and people showed up and they were going

363
00:15:22,391 --> 00:15:23,660
to fuck him and put them in jail for 
this.

364
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,690
I seriously think I could make a movie 
about my weekend.

365
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:31,750
The one weekend I went there,
the risk area when there's other parts 

366
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,160
of the country where you travel like 
that where the dues,

367
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,780
we get used to behaving and thinking you
have a certain amount of freedom.

368
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:38,360
You know what you do here.
This is an entirely free country.

369
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:39,560
You know,
we'd still illegal.

370
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:42,050
You can't say I want to kill the 
president or if you do,

371
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:43,410
they'll lock you up.
You know,

372
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,610
obviously it was in character when I 
said that the president of the Kentucky 

373
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:48,610
Fried Chicken,
you know,

374
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,310
you can't do certain things.

375
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,470
You can say it's not completely and 
totally free,

376
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,930
but for the most part it's pretty easy 
to get along here.

377
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,490
But if you go to other parts of the 
world,

378
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:57,620
they're incredibly suppressive.
Incredible.

379
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,490
Especially the Middle East.
Terrifying.

380
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:04,570
You know?
That's one of the things like when 

381
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:04,570
people like,
you know,

382
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,260
I am most certainly not for war and not 
into this war,

383
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:08,780
which I think is a fucking shady war and
shady as fuck her.

384
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:13,781
We got into it.
But you have to be very careful about 

385
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,460
the rise of Islamic power all around the
world.

386
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:20,150
The rise of [inaudible] was sharia,
sharia law.

387
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,580
We have to be careful of any kind of 
religious zealots,

388
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,520
whether Christian zealots are Muslims,
Muslims,

389
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:29,521
ups or anytime.
People that think they can lock you up 

390
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:29,870
and they have the right to because you 
were having fun,

391
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,110
you know,
you were out dancing when you were out 

392
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,110
drinking.

393
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,480
I have to say that's some scary shit.
I've always been,

394
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,540
not anti American,
but I always rebel against the 

395
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,600
government on all things when I get over
there and this should happen.

396
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,600
That's when you start to really 
appreciate your country that you go,

397
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,810
you know,
I could call the embassy and they would 

398
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:49,810
take care like they fight for you at the
shore.

399
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,560
That's what they're supposed to do.
And they're United States citizens,

400
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:52,250
you know,
I mean,

401
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:53,780
we pay taxes.
That's what it's all about.

402
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:58,781
You know,
that's the benefits of being a part of 

403
00:16:58,781 --> 00:17:00,581
the team,
but it's just fucked up that we have to 

404
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:00,581
think about that anywhere.
You know?

405
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:00,581
I mean,
yeah,

406
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,110
it's not perfect.
It's fuck corruptive shit,

407
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:04,310
you know,
super corrupt.

408
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:07,310
The fucking,
the business of government is gigantic.

409
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:12,311
You know,
there's a billion different jobs out 

410
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:12,311
there that are literally don't need to 
exist.

411
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:15,960
They exist to keep jobs going to keep 
the business of government going and it 

412
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,620
creates quagmires and fucking complex 
little social situations.

413
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,090
That's very.
That's why I always say to people,

414
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:22,610
I think it's funny when people criticize
the president.

415
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,650
I'm like,
I'm not an Obama Fan,

416
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:29,651
but I'm not against them.
I don't believe in the whole political 

417
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:29,651
system,
but I love people that criticize,

418
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:32,770
but he's the one who's in charge now.
He fucked everything up.

419
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,710
He's so silly.
He's like ww raw,

420
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,420
that whole political system and Vince 
Mcmahon's,

421
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:41,600
the corporations running it all and.
But,

422
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,010
but people that criticize like a guy 
like,

423
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,660
you know,
a Baldwin is healthcare Douglas.

424
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,340
I'm like,
dude,

425
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:49,830
you can't even fucking return your 
videos to blockbuster on time.

426
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,110
How

427
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,890
it's a general lack of understanding of 
what the system,

428
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:55,050
which I think most people have.
And even me,

429
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:55,680
I,
I'll,

430
00:17:55,681 --> 00:18:00,681
I'll get into it,
we'll focus on for like a couple of 

431
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:00,681
months and then I'll go,
what am I doing?

432
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:03,000
What am I paying attention to on paying 
attention to this stupid hustle,

433
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,210
this fake thing that barely know what 
goes on in Washington,

434
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,030
barely affects your day to day life.
What goes on in your neighborhood,

435
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:11,250
what goes on with your friends?
It goes on in your world,

436
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,590
the people that you interact with,
that's it affects your life.

437
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,800
If you get really too hung up and 
dealing with like Washington and 

438
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,370
politics and Democrats and Republicans 
and and thinking.

439
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:22,880
You understand that system.
That's what's ridiculous.

440
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,890
Used to work for a senator and yeah,
it was my first job where I worked for 

441
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:27,890
Ireland.
Specter,

442
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,820
get the fuck out of here to God that 
evil cunt.

443
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,410
You know,
that guy was on the warrant commission.

444
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,900
I can tell you,
I just,

445
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,910
I started interning for him in college 
and it was like I thought I wanted to go

446
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:40,590
into politics or something and then I 
realized like I'm the.

447
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,100
I thought that I had the shady side that
was good for politics,

448
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,820
but I was like,
there's no fun involved.

449
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,850
It's just a fucking torture is horrible,
and they are that like everyone says 

450
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,440
it's poor man's Hollywood specter had 
like hair plugs,

451
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,930
facelift,
fucking horse.

452
00:18:57,931 --> 00:19:00,230
You have to appear virile too.
And it was just like.

453
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,850
And he was the ugliest dude in the world
and he was over evil.

454
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,280
Fuck man.
But when he would explain his,

455
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:10,330
his single bullet theory,
if he would sit and explain it to you 

456
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:10,330
after he does it,
you would believe him?

457
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:10,330
No,
I wouldn't.

458
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,270
You know,
I wouldn't because I've seen the bullet.

459
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,550
The dumbest thing about the single 
bullet is the bullet itself,

460
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:16,490
but there's almost no damage went 
through to people.

461
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:20,400
Shattered bone and it's barely dentist,
but I'm telling you in his presence,

462
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:21,960
he has this way of Cain.
Correct.

463
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,380
Incorrect.
I would not be amused or affected by 

464
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:27,870
that dummy,
but it's no way that guy's an evil.

465
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,550
Fuck.
There's no way I would listen to him and

466
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:32,160
being charming or is he not in the 
least.

467
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,750
It was one of those things where I was 
like,

468
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:36,240
how the fuck did this guy get into 
politics?

469
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:40,050
He was on her and all you have to do is 
be in dude,

470
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:42,210
once you're in,
it's like being a writer on a Sitcom.

471
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,480
You know when you work on a Sitcom,
one of the things you find out about 

472
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,791
working on sitcoms is there's usually a 
few brilliant writers and these fucking 

473
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:49,791
fakes.

474
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,990
These people that aren't really funny at
all,

475
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:56,991
like they would never stand up comedian 
someone somehow or another got them a 

476
00:19:56,991 --> 00:20:00,270
job as a comedy writer and now here they
are on sitcoms and I would you deal with

477
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:05,271
them over and over and over again and 
you realize all you have to do is just 

478
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:05,271
get into the system.
Once you get into the system,

479
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,140
then you get other jobs.
I gave that speech once.

480
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:12,150
I got a deal a long time ago with a for 
to do a sitcom and it was going to be 

481
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,251
about my life and I used to live with my
sister in New York for awhile and they 

482
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:16,251
thought that was funny.
You know,

483
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:17,130
to the point of view will make a show 
about it.

484
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,630
And um,
so I met with writers or first I met 

485
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,820
with the all the development guys and 
they were like showing me the writers.

486
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,210
They were gonna give me and they gave me
the script of these guys and I went,

487
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,350
this is shit,
this is shit.

488
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,230
And my manager at the time was like,
shut the fuck up,

489
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,610
take the money.
Who's your man?

490
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,000
Got Up the time it was kary Hoffman 
Carry Hoffman had in New York.

491
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,400
He owned standup New York.
Oh my God.

492
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,140
Stand up.
New York didn't carry,

493
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:45,141
like he would get,
like people would get sitcoms and he 

494
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:45,141
would want a piece of the Sitcom because
they used to work out in this club.

495
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,250
Do that.
Yeah.

496
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,920
And that's hilarious.
He listened to the

497
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,250
stouffer's or listen to that guy was a 
manager of a fucking calm or owned a 

498
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,671
comedy club.
Comics would go up and then performance 

499
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:59,191
club and they've got to develop.
One guy got a development deal and he 

500
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,611
wanted like a certain percentage of this
Guy Sitcom because he used to practice 

501
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:02,800
at his club.
Oh,

502
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:04,720
that's fucking stupid.
So amazing.

503
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,240
Of course not.
Of course.

504
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:12,250
Try really hard.
Amazing that he would even chase after 

505
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:12,250
that.
So I'm sorry.

506
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:12,400
So this guy tells you to shut the fuck 
up,

507
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,730
shut the fuck up and take the money and 
I'm sitting in the meeting.

508
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,650
No offense.
I said,

509
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:22,651
I understand,
you know that you think these guys are 

510
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:22,651
good writers and everything.
I said,

511
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:22,900
but I know this whole system,
what goes on,

512
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,120
guys get in and they'd get their buddy 
in and he can't write and.

513
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:31,170
But then they've been there for 10 years
and you don't realize they never wrote 

514
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:31,170
anything good.

515
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,020
They were just there and now they get to
be a show runner.

516
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:37,021
I said,
I've got millions of friends that write 

517
00:21:37,021 --> 00:21:37,021
funnier than this,
can I?

518
00:21:37,021 --> 00:21:38,010
Can I just go out and get one of them?
And we're.

519
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:43,050
Jim and I are in that situation right 
now where they're trying to do a show 

520
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,680
with us right now and it's like we feel 
like we,

521
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,880
we,
we could write the show.

522
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,820
There was a time when,
uh,

523
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,000
I had a development deal where there's 
two guys that were,

524
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:49,740
uh,
uh,

525
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,780
writing for friends.
They were the creators of friends and 

526
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:54,780
one of them branched out on his own and 
uh,

527
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,450
I got this development deal and it was 
for Fox and was,

528
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,280
it was a good amount of money.
And so they really wanted this guy to do

529
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:02,740
it because this guy has such as great 
background will.

530
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:05,200
Often what happens is when there's a 
team of writers,

531
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,270
you got one brilliant guy and the other 
guys,

532
00:22:08,271 --> 00:22:10,980
this fucking buddy that you bounce shit 
off of,

533
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:11,910
you know.

534
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,920
And so the brilliant guys bouncing shit 
off the other guy and then they put it 

535
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,860
all together like maybe the other guy 
types and they become a team.

536
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:22,890
So you didn't want.
Somewhere along the line the other guy 

537
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:22,890
says,
you know what?

538
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,180
I think I'm unrecognized.
My talent from a much broader.

539
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,430
So this fucking idiot decides he's going
to go out on his own.

540
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:30,590
So he gets his giant development deal.
It was for um,

541
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,950
it was Michael Eisner's company and it 
was a fucking huge development deal.

542
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:38,110
Millions and millions of dollars.
Everybody was like banking on this guy.

543
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,210
And so I go to meet with the guy.
They wanted me to meet with them.

544
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,300
I meet with them and he's wearing 
bowling shoes.

545
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,730
And whenever I see a guy who was trying 
to be wacky,

546
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,970
you know,
you're wearing bone bone shoes aren't 

547
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:50,970
comfortable.
Those are uncomfortable as fuck.

548
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,870
Like why you wearing those and wearing 
those to let me know that you're nutty.

549
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,850
You know,
I might be a multimillionaire,

550
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:58,170
but I were bowling shoes to the office.
Did you just get done bowling?

551
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,590
No.
You're trying to send a message.

552
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,010
The message is you're dressing like you 
think a funny person would dress.

553
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,530
That tells me you're probably not 
fucking funny.

554
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,390
So I immediately get terrified and I'm 
like,

555
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:09,820
Oh,
this guy is a fucking faker.

556
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,010
He snuck through and there's no way.
There's no way.

557
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,040
How can you get this fucking gigantic 
multi-multi million dollar dear if you 

558
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,040
snuck through?
So I meet with the guy,

559
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,010
um,
we talk,

560
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,630
he has an idea.
He wants me to be a part of it.

561
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:23,050
And Bubba Bubba,
we meet and then they give me one of the

562
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:28,051
scripts.
The script that I read is fucking 

563
00:23:28,051 --> 00:23:28,051
terrible.
I mean,

564
00:23:28,051 --> 00:23:28,270
it was just God awful.
There's nothing funny in there at all.

565
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:28,960
And I'm like,
well,

566
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:30,150
maybe this is just,
you know,

567
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,050
just a shit script.
Maybe he's got some other ones,

568
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:34,420
maybe there's a Spec,
maybe they had him write this,

569
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:39,421
you know,
and it wasn't a subject that he was 

570
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:39,421
interested in.
So this guy comes up with the,

571
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:39,460
uh,
this is this idea for a sitcom.

572
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,870
Sitcom is about an immortal.
It's about a man who's immortal.

573
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,350
Okay.
And uh,

574
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:46,040
he,
uh,

575
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,510
existence like Egyptian days and all he 
does is like get laid.

576
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,560
It's fucking devoid of comedy.
Who wants to watch a sitcom about an 

577
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:03,521
immortal,
a guy who was in mortal has been a more 

578
00:24:03,521 --> 00:24:03,521
general sense the Egyptian days.
And all he does is try to get.

579
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:08,530
I don't understand all these hooks and 
these sitcoms when you look at like the 

580
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,960
best sitcoms that have ever existed,
that the jobs or whatever they do it.

581
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,770
It's,
it's so like superifilous.

582
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,780
It's all you need is a group of people 
that hang out together and have 

583
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,540
relationships with each other and the 
interesting relationships.

584
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:25,010
If you look at like taxi and cheers and 
you could move them to any other setting

585
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:30,011
and they would be funny.
You put them in an office if you didn't 

586
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:30,180
matter what this guy did.
Oh,

587
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:35,181
this guy was not funny.
It doesn't matter if he wrote about 

588
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:37,991
three people hanging out at a laundromat
or three people who work on the moon 

589
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:37,991
just in that.

590
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:38,540
He's a fucking idiot.
He just snuck in.

591
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,950
That show never made it out though,
right?

592
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,970
Oh,
of course it didn't.

593
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:45,971
And I,
I had to tell them we had a meeting and 

594
00:24:45,971 --> 00:24:48,020
it was a real controversial meaning.
It was like they were upset at me 

595
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,020
because I was like,
this guy sucks,

596
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,230
and they're like,
this guy does not suck.

597
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,090
This guy is Bubba Bubba.
He's this,

598
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:52,190
he's that.
He's done all these things and I'm like,

599
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,330
he's not funny.
I'm telling you,

600
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:54,800
this guy is not funny.
This is a mistake.

601
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,910
They'll like you don't understand.
There's more to writing and just being 

602
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,041
funny.
There's character development and story 

603
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,291
arts and he's a guy who really 
understands that and we can bring in 

604
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:08,981
more funny later,
but what he's really concerned with is 

605
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:08,981
what we're concerned.
We want a really good story.

606
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:10,220
The story was deaf.
It was terrible.

607
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,960
It was stupid.
It didn't make any sense.

608
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:17,110
It was just like a guy who's pretending 
to be a comedy writer who got a job 

609
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,440
writing comedy.
I like if you took some fucking guy,

610
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,450
worked for a fence company and I was.
I'm tired of renting Francis other 

611
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,180
organ.
I think I'm a good writer.

612
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,210
I've done it.
I've been doing standup for 15 years and

613
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,010
I.
It only,

614
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,060
it took me 15,
14 and about 14 and a half years to 

615
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,501
finally realize that 95 percent of the 
people in the business don't know 

616
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,010
anything about comedy.
Like,

617
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:39,020
well,
you can't really truly understand unless

618
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:40,580
you're doing it.
I mean,

619
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,210
I and I've lately been putting them to 
the test where I'll say,

620
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:47,180
well,
explain to me why and when you put them,

621
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,840
like when you put them on the hotspot 
anymore or like I'll say something like,

622
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,220
why is that comic doing that?

623
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:57,220
Or why should he,
why do you think he's good at what he 

624
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,220
does?
Or why isn't he,

625
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,770
you asking agents,
managers with development people,

626
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:05,771
talent scouts.
I always do it and I put them to it and 

627
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:05,771
they'll go,
well,

628
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:09,071
you know,
he does this really interesting thing 

629
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:09,890
where he's kind of like,
not really observational,

630
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:13,390
but he's kind of political buddies.
He's more on a surreal.

631
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,380
I'm like,
you have no fucking idea.

632
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,980
You have no idea.
You all are sheep and you just file.

633
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It's not that I don't think they,
I think agents and managers are really 

634
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,371
important,
but I think they really can't truly 

635
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:27,371
understand what common is all about 
unless they do it.

636
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,580
You know,
unless you do it,

637
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:30,590
you really never going to be an expert 
on it.

638
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:35,591
You might know a lot about it,
but you're never going to really truly 

639
00:26:35,591 --> 00:26:35,591
understand it unless you can recreate 
it.

640
00:26:35,591 --> 00:26:37,340
I have an agent out of Australia,
I think you might have.

641
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,700
I think he might've worked with you when
you were down there already,

642
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:40,820
Lang.
Yeah.

643
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,680
Yeah.
Same name as the Howard's Guy,

644
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:44,100
but st

645
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:48,000
already is fucking like the greatest 
agent that has been a great guy.

646
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:52,380
He's fucking amazing and he knows comedy
comedy a little bit and like you'll do a

647
00:26:52,381 --> 00:26:53,850
bit and he'll go,
why don't you say this?

648
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:55,080
And you're like,
yeah,

649
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:57,720
that,
that would actually work better and I'll

650
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:00,150
run my sets by him before I go on TV.
And he's like,

651
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:00,460
no,
no.

652
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,090
Take that out.
Put that in any shit.

653
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:08,091
We're not saying that he can have some 
understanding of comedy without doing 

654
00:27:08,091 --> 00:27:10,641
it.
You just can't really truly understand 

655
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:10,641
it.
You know?

656
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:10,641
You're never gonna understand it.
The way it comic understands it.

657
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:12,240
It's all theoretical until you put it in
practice.

658
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:15,010
It's like a guy who does caught it and 
the gym is pretty sure he could farewell

659
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,920
in a street fight.
Yeah.

660
00:27:15,921 --> 00:27:16,420
Yeah.
No,

661
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,690
but really he's not really sure it's 
theoretical.

662
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,820
You know,
a guy who was actually fought a bunch of

663
00:27:20,821 --> 00:27:21,480
times was like,
yeah,

664
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:22,410
I've been through this shit before.

665
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,820
I know what I'm going to do.
You know,

666
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,860
there's,
there's a difference and,

667
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:30,870
but there's nothing wrong with agents 
and managers that don't understand it 

668
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,530
totally because they do a great job.
You know,

669
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,920
I wouldn't do it and you wouldn't do it.
We're not going to sell ourselves or 

670
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:36,920
we're not going to go out and get 
development deals.

671
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,940
We can't do it anyway.
You can't negotiate for yourself.

672
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:43,941
It's impossible,
especially that end be creative like 

673
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:43,950
it's important to have managers and 
agents,

674
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:46,590
you know,
but they don't have to know everything.

675
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,440
They just have to shut the fuck up and 
push in the right direction.

676
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:51,960
If you're talented,
you know what the problem is when you're

677
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,390
not that talented or when you're not 
doing that,

678
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:56,160
well,
you haven't become successful yet.

679
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,380
Then they start tweaking you.
Then they start,

680
00:27:58,381 --> 00:28:03,381
well,
we've got to figure out what's going on 

681
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:03,381
here.

682
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:03,381
Well,
you need as a new look.

683
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,440
You know,
the Jamie Masada told my friend Todd 

684
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:06,440
Parker that,
uh,

685
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,740
he had to be the generation x guy.
That's what he was saying by the younger

686
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,350
generation x guy.
This is your new hook.

687
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:15,351
You go on stage,
everything come out of your mouth that 

688
00:28:15,351 --> 00:28:15,480
gen x,
I am generation x guy.

689
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,900
Have you imdbs that guy now?
Lately that got the friends writer it 

690
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,510
just to see what.
I don't even remember his name.

691
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,570
I don't remember his name,
but I've met a couple of those guys.

692
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:29,571
I,
I wrote something with one of those 

693
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:29,571
guys,
a guy who wrote on Seinfeld.

694
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:33,320
It was fucking terrible.
He couldn't write anything funny and 

695
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:33,630
wound up meeting me writing the funny 
stuff and him writing it down.

696
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,330
It was a terrible relationship with 
Carrie Hoffman.

697
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:39,420
Did that to uh,
to me that once he tried to change me,

698
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:40,420
it's like I could have no idea.

699
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,920
Oh,
you never see comedy duos anymore.

700
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:48,380
You and a girl and a girl and you'd do 
like stiller in Mira.

701
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,180
Oh God.
Oh my God.

702
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:52,340
What an idiot.
Yeah.

703
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:57,590
But uh,
what does that guy still in the 

704
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,001
business?
I think actually he's doing really well 

705
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:01,980
because he's got Mike Royce and Tom hurt
to a really good writers and I think,

706
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,330
I think tom might be on.
I always liked the guy I'm doing.

707
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:07,820
This club is always nice to me.
Tom,

708
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,170
I heard that shit about him to 15 
percent from.

709
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,950
He was kind of like a father to me.
He was that.

710
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,620
He was really good and he actually did 
shit.

711
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:18,621
That was amazing.
Some of the shit he did was the best 

712
00:29:18,621 --> 00:29:19,110
stuff a manager ever did for me.
When I went to Montreal to do new faces,

713
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:24,350
he sent a tape of me to every single 
person that wasn't going to Montreal and

714
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:29,811
I bombed at Montreal,
bombed and so I was fucked and then all 

715
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:31,920
the people that didn't go to Montreal 
saw a tape.

716
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:33,860
That was great and we're like,
he's all.

717
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,330
What year was this?
This is 2000 or so.

718
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:38,130
People were stopping and going to 
Montreal.

719
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:41,010
By then it was Montreal kind of died 
either on my.

720
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,130
My Year of new

721
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,620
faces was listening to this.
It was me.

722
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,720
Tony Rock,
I believe was in it.

723
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,260
A Dean Edwards who got Saturday night 
live that year,

724
00:29:50,261 --> 00:29:52,360
Demitri Martin,
Mike Birbiglia,

725
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,750
a Russman,
neve like everybody got something big 

726
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,190
out of it.
And uh,

727
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,720
and it was like the last year though.
It was the last year because chicken was

728
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,360
the year before.
Yeah,

729
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,740
that was when I was going to bring up,
when we're talking about this,

730
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:07,500
I think we brought up chicken on the 
podcast before,

731
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,000
didn't we?
Well,

732
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:14,100
chicken,
God rest his soul is the most amazing 

733
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,861
phenomenon.
And this is the proof that agents and 

734
00:30:16,861 --> 00:30:16,861
managers have no fucking idea.
They just don't get it.

735
00:30:16,861 --> 00:30:17,620
They don't know what's funny and what's 
not funny.

736
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,240
This was,
some of them don't.

737
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,230
I should say this guy,
um,

738
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,990
he was this young kid who was just real 
boyishly handsome and he had this really

739
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:29,110
wacky act like there was,
there's a screw loose in them and he had

740
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:31,910
this like really,
like completely over the top act.

741
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,330
It just would baffle comedian.
So we'll go.

742
00:30:34,331 --> 00:30:36,570
This is not funny at all.
I don't get it too.

743
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,180
It was all like,
give you one.

744
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,740
I remember

745
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,660
I auditioned for snl with them.
He,

746
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:45,661
uh,
he went on stage and said so and so when

747
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:47,500
they hit a home run,
do you ever see him?

748
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:50,050
They just jog around the bases.
He's like,

749
00:30:50,051 --> 00:30:52,390
they just casually jog around.
If they hit a home run,

750
00:30:52,391 --> 00:30:53,410
he's like,
that was me.

751
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,790
If I hit a home run,
it'd be like what the fuck?

752
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,400
And he'd like do like flips on stage and
run around the audience and like throw 

753
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,431
his arms in the air and be like,
I'd be flicking shit in the air out of 

754
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,571
my life.
Would almost like if you just see a 

755
00:31:09,571 --> 00:31:11,250
crazy man jumping up and down in a 
nightclub,

756
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,390
a dude's pretty crazy.
That's what he was.

757
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,670
Awesome.
Yeah,

758
00:31:14,671 --> 00:31:16,500
he wasn't,
it wasn't that talented.

759
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:21,530
We tried really hard anyway.
He wound up getting this giant 

760
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,901
development deal and just being a 
complete total bust like they couldn't 

761
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:25,440
do anything with was just not talented.
It was just awful.

762
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:30,590
And so um,
he went into this sort of dark 

763
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,230
depression and then comics hated them.
Like he was a punchline for Comedians,

764
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,410
a bunch of them who just shit all over 
him,

765
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,110
you know,
I mean,

766
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:35,610
come,
you know,

767
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,620
comics are,
if one guy's doing better than you and 

768
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:40,910
you think he's not as good as you,
it's just fucking phantom is the.

769
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,400
So this kid one up killing himself in 
front of a school.

770
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,750
We hung himself on a tree in front of 
us.

771
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,250
Cool.
I know that.

772
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:54,400
I'm pretty sure that part of it.
I know I heard the story when he was at 

773
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,061
Montreal though,
like there was so much hype on them 

774
00:31:58,061 --> 00:32:00,731
going into Montreal that uh,
like that they were bidding on him 

775
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:05,291
before he even went on stage.
And I think he did as he was going on 

776
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:05,480
stage,
someone said to his manager,

777
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,370
like,
one of the networks goes like,

778
00:32:07,371 --> 00:32:12,371
we'll give you a million dollars if he 
doesn't step on that stage because they 

779
00:32:12,371 --> 00:32:14,940
knew his price would even go up once he 
went on stage and a million dollars.

780
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,390
His development deal was a half a 
million.

781
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,890
Oh,
that was pretty sure that's what he got.

782
00:32:18,891 --> 00:32:20,720
So they said,
we'll give you half a million for lease.

783
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,740
That's what the rumor was.
Go on stage because they didn't want the

784
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:26,850
bidding to even go up further.
So I don't say

785
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,540
lot of hype.
Yeah.

786
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,030
I don't think that really happened.
That doesn't really.

787
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:36,060
Nobody does that.
But there was a lot of people that were 

788
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,060
into this kid and comics.
We'd be standing in the back of the room

789
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,320
watching this kid who flail around on 
stage and you know,

790
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:40,670
like literally flail,

791
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,130
you know,
and like he was on fire and go,

792
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:45,830
what the fuck is going on?
Let's look at clips of him online.

793
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:48,530
You think that's a good question?
Michael Ruth was his name.

794
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:51,320
I think I've met him the night we did 
snl.

795
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:56,510
We're,
we were auditioning at Carolina and 

796
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,991
we're all in the green room and he comes
into the green room and all the comics 

797
00:32:58,991 --> 00:33:01,811
kind of know each other and then he 
shows up in the green room and he's got 

798
00:33:01,811 --> 00:33:03,170
this energy,
you know those energy vampires that just

799
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,390
suck all the energy away from everyone 
else.

800
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:10,100
He started bouncing around the room 
going fucking crazy.

801
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:11,990
I don't know what I'm fucking doing 
here.

802
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:15,050
This is like snls here and I'm fucking 
like,

803
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,360
I'm not even a comedian.
I don't know what,

804
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:22,510
like this is crazy.
You guys like do your shit and I just 

805
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:22,910
get up on stage and I'm like wacky and 
fucking crazy.

806
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,770
And,
and everyone was just kind of,

807
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:29,830
you know,
comics were all looking at each other 

808
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,691
like did you.
It was almost like he was psyching us 

809
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:32,870
out too because we're all trying to,
you know,

810
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:35,850
this is a big deal for us.
We're all trying to get on and uh,

811
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,910
he's bringing you into his head.
Yeah.

812
00:33:37,911 --> 00:33:39,770
And I thought that's what he was doing 
and I'm like,

813
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:44,771
you're fucking with me right now and I'm
about to punch you in the face like 

814
00:33:44,771 --> 00:33:48,130
that.
So you thought he was doing it on 

815
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:48,130
purpose?
Yeah.

816
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:48,130
And I'm,
I'm like,

817
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:48,130
I'm not going to put someone really do 
that.

818
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,780
I think there are guys that are,
they kind of do that railing.

819
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,100
Yeah.
How would that work though?

820
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,290
That's a weird strategy to go out and do
anything.

821
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:55,700
I've found some videos if you want to 
listen to one.

822
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,490
Yeah,
no one.

823
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,900
I don't like comics that go.
Yeah,

824
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,540
that's him,
man.

825
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,620
You go to the room.
Does it say anything about him?

826
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,840
How He's dead.
He didn't say how he killed himself.

827
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,280
No,

828
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,210
you guys got a lot of white suburban 
gangster kids here.

829
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:10,670
I ain't got a voice.
You guys got little white suburb against

830
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,360
your kids here.
Not a gangster kids.

831
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,140
Seventeen year old Caucasian boys that 
looked like me.

832
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:23,890
Fuck you there.
A black girl walking around the mall 

833
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,020
here.
They got the pants hanging off their 

834
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,020
ass.
Got The adults were going.

835
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,020
Oh Shit.

836
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,950
He pulled his pants down.
It looked like a thong he had on

837
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,320
dangerous,
but she 45 pounds of gold.

838
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:54,740
Gold chain.
Three gold to go in the whole fucking 

839
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:54,740
time.
His name's Bradley.

840
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,670
Cue The plane that rap music loud as 
shit.

841
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:07,450
Driving his mom minivan.
No thank you.

842
00:35:07,621 --> 00:35:11,060
To want them to dance clubs.
Doing all those boody dances.

843
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,500
You know.
Fuck you,

844
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:16,460
dude.
You can't do it.

845
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,570
He pulled his pants down again.

846
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,310
His name is Michael Roof.
R O f.

847
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,270
So anyway,
that's enough of that.

848
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,790
Anyway,
that's not terrible.

849
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:49,110
I mean that's.
Yeah,

850
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,970
I mean it's not the worst comment I've 
ever heard.

851
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:56,180
Funny,
when he was going down his pants the 

852
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,000
first time he had taken his underwear 
and I gave himself a Wedgie so it looked

853
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:59,620
like he had a thong on.
It was like a little touch,

854
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:01,800
a little extra touch.
It was nice

855
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,510
jazzed up the bit.
I like the Tagline,

856
00:36:04,511 --> 00:36:07,570
the new crack tagline you added,
you know,

857
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,010
whatever man.
Nothing wrong with that.

858
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:14,220
I mean,
I mean it's not my style so I'm not 

859
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,700
into,
was in closing down really well.

860
00:36:15,701 --> 00:36:16,260
He,
um,

861
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:16,890
you know,
he,

862
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:19,510
he had that big development deal and 
then nothing happened for it.

863
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,390
And then,
um,

864
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,550
I remember like,
um,

865
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,220
so many people are so fucking happy when
nothing happened to it,

866
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:29,530
you know,
and that's when it got really ugly for 

867
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,241
him.
Like comics were happy that he was 

868
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:31,241
failing,
you know,

869
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:33,870
and then we'll just,
there was like a lot of negative energy 

870
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:33,870
towards it,
but they used him as an example.

871
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,840
They said like,
he killed the development.

872
00:36:34,841 --> 00:36:36,730
Yes he did.
He did kill it.

873
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:40,900
They gave him a ton of money and that 
was it really killed.

874
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:45,460
It was their lack of real talent and 
ability to recognize talent,

875
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,240
you know,
these,

876
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,970
these comics or these agents and 
managers,

877
00:36:48,971 --> 00:36:51,850
they're really just taking guesses and 
that's what killed that were killed.

878
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:56,850
It was all these big people that spend a
lot of money and the people that were 

879
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:56,850
the head of studios that people that,
you know,

880
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,810
they had a budget and then they're like,
why did we spend half a million dollars 

881
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:00,810
on this fucking thing?
Like,

882
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,470
what is this?
There's a lot of that going on,

883
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:03,220
man.
You know,

884
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,500
like this the friends guy,
if they sat that guy down.

885
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:07,360
So just write us a couple of scripture 
real quick.

886
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,000
Now let's look at your scripts.
Let's look at your scripts.

887
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:15,060
They read their scripts and then didn't 
read anything from this guy before he 

888
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,060
got this deal.
I know they didn't.

889
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,780
I know the whole story behind it.
Everybody was so high on them.

890
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,180
They just want to.
We're willing to throw this guy money.

891
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,430
I've looked at a bunch of scripts lately
and I'm like,

892
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,210
death,
death,

893
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,040
right?
I can't do it.

894
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:24,700
I've,
I've,

895
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,520
I've read a couple of them and I saw and
I looked down to that and I go,

896
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:28,420
no,
I'm not even going in.

897
00:37:28,421 --> 00:37:29,770
I can't go in.
I can't do this,

898
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,640
you know?
Yeah.

899
00:37:30,641 --> 00:37:33,220
It would be nice to do a sitcom again.
I love doing news radio.

900
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:35,950
It was a lot of fun.
But good luck trying to find another one

901
00:37:35,951 --> 00:37:36,640
of those.
By the way,

902
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:37,870
Dave [inaudible] was going to do the 
podcast.

903
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,690
Don't touch with Dave Pollino very 
excited.

904
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,250
Um,
but you know,

905
00:37:42,251 --> 00:37:47,251
it's like getting a hold of one of those
sitcoms as like a fucking one of the 

906
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:47,251
million and it's.
So if you don't do that,

907
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:48,150
what are you dealing with?
Well,

908
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,370
you're dealing with a bunch of producers
that don't really know how to do comedy.

909
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,520
You're dealing with a bunch of writers.
Most of them are not going to be 

910
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,681
talented because if they were talented 
they'd be working for modern family or 

911
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:01,861
some of those big shows and there's not 
that many really good ones that are out 

912
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:01,861
there free,
you know?

913
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,230
So it's like your odds of finding a good
one or like one in 10,

914
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,880
you know,
maybe maybe one in 20.

915
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,940
Yeah.
I uh,

916
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,790
Paul prevents and I started writing a 
movie together on this idea that I had 

917
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,210
and I met Paul and Edinburgh.
I was doing the Edinburgh festival and I

918
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,580
kind of did the thing is a bit.
And he's like,

919
00:38:19,581 --> 00:38:20,330
what?
I said,

920
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,860
Oh yeah,
I've tried to write a movie about that.

921
00:38:21,861 --> 00:38:23,180
And he's like,
Hey,

922
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:23,920
you should write that fucking

923
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:28,950
movie.
This is the bit that you said is the 

924
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:28,950
same as my bed.
The one that I talked about on the show,

925
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,230
very similar as A.
I had a bit that I used to do.

926
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:36,370
I did it back in the nineties.
I just talked about it on the show the 

927
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,711
other day because we were,
we were both on the green room show 

928
00:38:39,711 --> 00:38:42,571
together and there was um,
we were talking about like being booed 

929
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:43,510
off stage and like when people want you 
to change the subject,

930
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:45,040
you're talking about like how people get
upset at you.

931
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:50,460
And I said that I used to do this joke 
about cloning Jesus because there was a 

932
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,880
thing called a second coming project.
And the second project was.

933
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,780
That's funny that that's what we named 
the script was the second coming because

934
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:57,910
it's all about the guy jerking off is 
the opening scene.

935
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,900
Really?
Yeah.

936
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,080
Okay.
Um,

937
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,000
there was a real thing.
It was in the news about this many,

938
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:04,960
many years ago.
Anyway,

939
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:10,890
the idea was they were going to take dna
from the shroud of Turin and they were 

940
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,280
going to recreate Jesus.
They were going to clone Jesus.

941
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,230
But I,
one of my job was like,

942
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,380
and this is a real thing,
like they really think,

943
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,060
I'm not sure it might've been a parody,
you know,

944
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:20,110
there's a lot of those.
The sneak through.

945
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:22,630
By the way,
Rachel maddow got busted on a parody the

946
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:24,970
other day.
She was a reading a parody.

947
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,100
This Christian,
it's a fake website.

948
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:32,340
And she was reading it as if it was news
that Palin's supporters really believe 

949
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:32,340
that,
you know,

950
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,890
we have to inject Christianity into 
North Africa.

951
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,260
And it's really funny.
And some of my bid was,

952
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:39,460
you know,
like Dolly the sheep,

953
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,600
you know,
when they cloned Dolly the sheep,

954
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:41,790
that Shit didn't come out perfect.

955
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,100
Like cloning is not an exact science.
Like what if they,

956
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,760
what do they do with the first Jesus if 
the clone,

957
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,780
when it comes out retarded,
do you kill them and start from scratch 

958
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:50,780
or do you just,
you know.

959
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,960
And so this whole bit about it.
And when I did it at the comedy store,

960
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:57,961
someone was yelling out fat white woman 
with blonde hair and fat blond fingers,

961
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,430
just that,
you know,

962
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:07,510
I'm a Christian next subject.
Like she was so firm and her wonky 

963
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:13,810
beliefs that she wanted a styling.
Just theoretical idea.

964
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,440
I mean it's not a real Jesus we're 
talking about this is a.

965
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,900
and it's a real legit question.
If they really do clone Jesus,

966
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:25,110
that's a God legit question.
Like what if they found Jesus's bones 

967
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:25,750
and there was some DNA inside of it and 
they could extract it.

968
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:27,280
They knew for sure it was de Jesus.

969
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,900
They knew it was his DNA.
Well,

970
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:33,901
that's a real legit question.
What if he does come back retarded 

971
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:33,901
because he could come back all fucked 
up.

972
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:38,580
There could be all sorts of.
He could be autistic and psychopath 

973
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,470
could be black as fuck with you.
What if he was my,

974
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,500
I think it was black.
Yeah.

975
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,270
Because you can't start off white and 
then go put there.

976
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:49,370
Well,
there's a lot of evidence that Jesus 

977
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,180
wasn't even real.
It was a lot of evidence that there was 

978
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,641
no Jesus started mythologized and that 
this same mythology repeats itself over 

979
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:54,280
and over and over again.
So Jesus,

980
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:56,680
even as a historical figures in 
question,

981
00:40:56,681 --> 00:40:57,790
you know,
there's like,

982
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,730
there's like,
you know,

983
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:03,750
volumes of,
of pages written about certain Caesar's 

984
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:03,750
and certain,
you know,

985
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,550
rulers of,
uh,

986
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,310
of,
of Greece and Rome.

987
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:08,590
And so the,
the stuff that's on Jesus's,

988
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,640
so it's really hard to tell whether it's
real well and also all those biblical 

989
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:13,970
fucking,
you know,

990
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:16,090
like everything from all the matthew,
mark,

991
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:17,280
Luke and John.
There was like,

992
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,060
there was the bulk of q two,
you know,

993
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:21,460
but that there's a,
there was a fifth book of the Gospels.

994
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:24,970
Apparently that was luke based.
His book on,

995
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,130
I'm not completely accurate and all this
stuff,

996
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:32,131
but if you start reading about it,
you'll find out that like all four of 

997
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:34,520
them didn't live at the same time,
so some of them base their account

998
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,490
on the other ones because they'll say 
it's like identical of the other one.

999
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,100
So it's like they just heard a story.
Yeah,

1000
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:45,101
and just rewrote it,
which could have happened from the 

1001
00:41:45,101 --> 00:41:47,201
beginning and then there was also like 
the council of nicea where these guys 

1002
00:41:47,201 --> 00:41:48,260
went in and decided the bishops all 
went,

1003
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:49,850
okay,
well we've got all these books.

1004
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:51,830
We're going to throw out these ones.
We don't like these.

1005
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:56,980
We're going to keep the.
They just rewrote history the way they 

1006
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,261
wanted it.
So I mean it's like shit like that on 

1007
00:41:59,261 --> 00:41:59,261
there for you.
If you find out about the New Testament,

1008
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:04,001
that's where things get really weird 
because constantine and a bunch of 

1009
00:42:04,001 --> 00:42:06,641
bishops create that New Testament.
That's the know what you're talking 

1010
00:42:06,641 --> 00:42:10,451
about.
Something that was way after Jesus's 

1011
00:42:10,451 --> 00:42:10,451
death.
You know,

1012
00:42:10,451 --> 00:42:11,570
if Jesus was a real figure,
the whole thing is fucking squirrely.

1013
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:16,870
You know,
the historical account just mean not 

1014
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:16,980
even saying the religious accompany 
historical accounts various quarterly.

1015
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:22,430
I don't know about it.
Like Dolly being retarded.

1016
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,230
I've often wondered like,
you know,

1017
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:26,180
when like a dog bite someone,
everybody's like,

1018
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:27,260
oh,
he's a bad dog or whatever.

1019
00:42:27,261 --> 00:42:29,690
I'm like,
you see people all the time,

1020
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:33,430
like people with down syndrome.
Are there like down syndrome dogs?

1021
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:38,580
Yes.
I'm going through minds where your 

1022
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:38,580
fucking dogs retire.
Yeah.

1023
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,380
It's totally retarded dogs.
Just really,

1024
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:41,820
really overbred you know,
you have uh,

1025
00:42:41,821 --> 00:42:44,840
uh,
one of those little dogs.

1026
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,940
What's it called again?
A Pekinese.

1027
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,870
Yeah,
those dogs,

1028
00:42:47,871 --> 00:42:48,830
man.
Guess what?

1029
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,230
That came from a wolf.
Yeah.

1030
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,630
There's no way you get a good example if
that is what you get from a wolf.

1031
00:42:54,631 --> 00:42:56,690
I think my dog might be part wolf.
Really?

1032
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,290
Yeah.
It's,

1033
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,790
she's,
she's a,

1034
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,730
she's an ozzy cattle dog and cheese.

1035
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,600
I grew up with Jack Russell terriers.
You ever see those little short locking 

1036
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:07,600
the assholes?
And they,

1037
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,891
uh,
the really aggressive because they used 

1038
00:43:11,891 --> 00:43:13,211
to kill rats.
Fucking solo aggressed send them after 

1039
00:43:13,211 --> 00:43:13,550
we lived out in the woods and these 
things would do one of them.

1040
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,220
One of them went down a A.
I couldn't find him.

1041
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:19,400
One night I find them down a sewer under
the road and there's A.

1042
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:24,401
I'm looking down the sewer grate.
I see them and there's a pipe way down 

1043
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,460
underneath it runs out to a creek and 
I'm like,

1044
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:30,461
fuck.
He ran up the pipe and he's under the 

1045
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:30,461
sewer.
There's no way for me to get him.

1046
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:30,461
I looked down,
he's got a raccoon cornered.

1047
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:31,550
Oh my God.
And I'm like,

1048
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:32,270
fuck,
he's dead.

1049
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:37,330
He's dead,
this raccoon and she's going to an all 

1050
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:37,330
and I'm just going,
come on,

1051
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:37,330
like try to coach them out the.

1052
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,120
And I'm screaming,
screaming,

1053
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:42,410
and all of a sudden I hear and it goes 
and I'm like,

1054
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,760
fuck,
my dog's dead.

1055
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,220
My Dog's dead.
And I'm shining a flashlight and I don't

1056
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:51,221
see anything.
Next thing I know my Jack Russell drags 

1057
00:43:51,221 --> 00:43:53,801
the raccoon out of the pipe on Jack 
Russell killed a raccoon cut to about a 

1058
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,000
year ago.
I,

1059
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,010
my dog's leash lists all the time.
People you can call me an asshole,

1060
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:00,050
but I don't believe in putting a dog on 
a leash.

1061
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:02,770
And my dogs well behaved and she's 
amazing.

1062
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:08,130
I saw the dogs won't be hey,
as long as you really know the dog as 

1063
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:10,900
well behaved.
Just when people walk around with like 

1064
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:10,900
pitbulls without just.
Yeah,

1065
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:10,900
my dogs.
Amazing.

1066
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,950
And so the way I used to do that,
like a retard when I,

1067
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,890
when I,
when I get close to home,

1068
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:16,580
I'll go,
go,

1069
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,430
go home and she'll run like 200 meters 
up the road.

1070
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,100
So I one I'd see this cat and she 
chased,

1071
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,050
she never would hurt a cat but you'll 
play with them.

1072
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:24,650
So I go,
go,

1073
00:44:24,651 --> 00:44:25,580
go.
There's a cat.

1074
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,400
You told him to chase the kid and she 
just plays with the cat.

1075
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,280
And uh,
so she goes running up the road

1076
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,010
and all of a sudden I hear her go ma and
I'm like,

1077
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,320
oh fuck,
she's,

1078
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:41,680
you know,
she's now fighting with a cat and she's 

1079
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,390
never fought before.
And I come around the corner.

1080
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:44,160
It's not a cat,
it's a fucking raccoon.

1081
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,690
And I'm like,
fuck.

1082
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:47,730
And the cat takes or the raccoon takes 
off.

1083
00:44:47,731 --> 00:44:50,550
So you totally chase after a raccoon 
thinking it was a cat.

1084
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,540
And how did you mistake the,
it was so far away.

1085
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:59,590
It was like 200 yards away.
So I wake up the next day and they see 

1086
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:01,740
my dog sitting there and the eyes are 
crusted shut.

1087
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,420
And I'm like,
what the fuck?

1088
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,400
So I take her to the vets and uh,
the record scratch both their corneas.

1089
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,110
Yeah.
Oh God.

1090
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:15,230
And he said,
the vet said these things will rip your 

1091
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,130
dog apart.
They,

1092
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,040
they will fucking junkie texting and 
tweeting while he's trying to have some 

1093
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,070
convoluted conversation.

1094
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,790
They said they'll rip your dog apart.
And I said,

1095
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:27,750
well,
what about the rabies?

1096
00:45:27,751 --> 00:45:29,490
And he said that rabies aren't bad in 
California,

1097
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,130
but uh,
it's not bad.

1098
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:33,880
But the rackets fucking fucking scary 
man recommended.

1099
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,490
There was when I lived in new Rochelle,
New York,

1100
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:38,400
I had a big one in my neighborhood.
He used to fuck up trash cans.

1101
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,410
He was gigantic.
I mean,

1102
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:43,170
it was like a dog.
I couldn't believe how big he was.

1103
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:48,171
And I,
I got a blow gun just so I can try to 

1104
00:45:48,171 --> 00:45:48,171
kill him.
And I was terrified.

1105
00:45:48,171 --> 00:45:48,360
I opened the door,
it was a small,

1106
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:53,361
I had a small little yard and I would 
open the door and he would literally be 

1107
00:45:53,361 --> 00:45:53,730
fucking 10 feet from me.
I panic and slam the door.

1108
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,020
I'm like,
get out of here,

1109
00:45:55,021 --> 00:45:55,470
bitch.

1110
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,790
My,
my old dog Cabo at one site level,

1111
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,840
Islam out the backyard and just to go to
the bathroom and I'd let them out and 

1112
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,280
instead of going around like,
oh,

1113
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,740
what's going on?
So I go outside and it's two skunks,

1114
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,310
like corner did my little backyard and 
the dogs about to attack them.

1115
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:14,460
And I'm just thinking I don't want to 
get sprayed and want the dog to get 

1116
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:14,700
sprayed.
Takes forever to clean.

1117
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:17,770
My dog got sprayed when I was a little 
kid.

1118
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,830
It's the worst.
It takes forever.

1119
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:26,050
You use tomato juice.
Apparently there's an enzyme and 

1120
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,090
tomatoes that helps break it down,
but not much tomato and it doesn't work.

1121
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,290
You got to keep doing it over and over 
and over again.

1122
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,440
The stuck for weeks.
Have you ever heard the Billy Burger bit

1123
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:37,460
about raccoons?
Was the raccoon and the little hand 

1124
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:37,460
stealing the cat.
The youtube video.

1125
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,870
It's the hardest I've ever laughed at a 
joke in my life.

1126
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:42,420
I don't think I met a Mustang.
I saw him at the Improv one night.

1127
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:44,580
It was recently,
so it's probably like in his new set,

1128
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,500
but it's billy shelly,
you know,

1129
00:46:46,501 --> 00:46:51,501
angry billy gets.
He's still angry watching this youtube 

1130
00:46:51,501 --> 00:46:53,310
video where a raccoon keeps stealing 
like cat food,

1131
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:58,340
like it comes over and keep stealing the
food from the cat or from the dog or 

1132
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,221
something and he keeps going.
This little fucking raccoon hands and 

1133
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,180
tears were coming out of my eyes.

1134
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:08,180
I was laughing.
I've never laughed that hard at a comic 

1135
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:08,220
store.
Check it out because he's so angry about

1136
00:47:08,221 --> 00:47:13,221
the little hands and he's like,
I'm the fucking little mask on this 

1137
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:13,221
room.
It's pretty crazy that all.

1138
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:14,830
And all dogs came from wolves.
Yeah.

1139
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,370
You know when they figured out that 
genetic lineage of dogs,

1140
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:19,710
they expected to be a bunch of wild 
candidates in there.

1141
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,170
A bunch of different kinds of canines.
Nope.

1142
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,510
Wolves.
All.

1143
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:25,590
Originally it was a wolf or what about a
Dingo?

1144
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:27,760
It's a different kind of dog and 
welcoming.

1145
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:28,890
It's a candidate.
A wild.

1146
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,670
Okay.
I know if there's specific ones,

1147
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,590
that Dingo doesn't come from a wolf,
does it?

1148
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:33,580
I don't know.
That's a good question.

1149
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:36,330
It's an Australian thing.
Yeah.

1150
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,000
The dingoes eat babies Australia.
My dog looks like a Dingo.

1151
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:45,120
Do Kangaroos kill people?
There was a recycling of discussion one 

1152
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,170
time I got out of a car and uh,
I thought it was a fucking,

1153
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,760
like,
we're driving through this neighborhood.

1154
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,780
I don't know why we're in this 
neighborhood.

1155
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:53,110
Simple yes or no hair.
I don't know,

1156
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:58,111
but I've heard stories that yes,
because when we went to the zoo in 

1157
00:47:58,111 --> 00:47:59,260
Australia,
they told us the big ones,

1158
00:47:59,261 --> 00:48:00,670
the big.
There's big Kangaroos.

1159
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:02,620
I forget which kinds of the big ones.
What are the red ones?

1160
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:04,360
The gray ones.
The big ones.

1161
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:06,130
Kill people.
And they have a bunch of times.

1162
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,340
They said you have to be very careful if
you approach them in the wild.

1163
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:12,280
This thing I read the other day,
it said like a hundred people die a year

1164
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:13,990
from it.
And then this other website,

1165
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:19,010
it's like a,
there's been a few known attacks in the 

1166
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:19,010
history of,
you know,

1167
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:20,530
yeah.
There was one woman recently,

1168
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:23,080
her dogs were killed.
The most recent attack that I could find

1169
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:25,570
online.
And this kangaroo drowned her dogs.

1170
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,590
That's pretty high.

1171
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:29,230
Fuck gangster IRA's grout.
Drown your dog.

1172
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,500
I saw the biggest fucking kangaroo and I
thought it was a statue in these 

1173
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:34,750
people's yard.
And I was like,

1174
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:37,020
fuck,
who has this giant kangaroo statue?

1175
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,880
I mean like 10 foot tall white.
Looked like it was.

1176
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:44,881
No,
once they get to be like seven feet 

1177
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:44,881
tall,
as tall as your ceiling and come off,

1178
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:46,710
I swear to God.
And I got out of the car.

1179
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,980
So this is like a 10 foot ceiling.
How many feet?

1180
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,440
Ten feet.
I was,

1181
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:55,441
uh,
two other comics and I see this thing 

1182
00:48:55,441 --> 00:48:55,441
over by these garbage cans.
I'm like,

1183
00:48:55,441 --> 00:48:55,690
Holy Shit.
Look at this fucking thing.

1184
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:59,470
And I start walking towards it and this 
comic named Tommy Johnson goes,

1185
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,660
get out,
fuck back in the car,

1186
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:04,510
make fucking get in the fucking car.
And I'm like,

1187
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:06,220
what?
And I'm walking towards it.

1188
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,680
And all of a sudden I see it move and 
now he's like,

1189
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:10,780
Hey,
don't fucking dishes made it.

1190
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,000
I'll fucking gun.
Wow.

1191
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:18,420
That's what they claim.
I think it's like an urban myth that 

1192
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:18,590
they just fucking rip your stomach.
Oh No,

1193
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,630
no.
It's not an urban myth.

1194
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,940
People definitely have been attacked in 
that manner.

1195
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,350
They just got punched in the red.
The red kangaroo is the big one.

1196
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:31,560
I'm just trying to find out how that 
would fucking freak me out if I saw a 

1197
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:31,570
kangaroo that big.
Yeah,

1198
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,280
no shit.
I don't think they're that big though.

1199
00:49:33,281 --> 00:49:34,720
I think you were afraid they were that 
big.

1200
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,240
I love to try to like ride around in 
your ceiling.

1201
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,220
I didn't think it was 10.
I thought it was about seven.

1202
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,020
I'd say seven,
seven feet tall.

1203
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:42,430
This fucking thing.
Yeah,

1204
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:46,840
that's what they told us when we went to
the zoo and in Australia it was fucking.

1205
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:47,560
Oh,
okay.

1206
00:49:47,561 --> 00:49:52,561
Here we go.
They can go to eight feet tall and 

1207
00:49:52,561 --> 00:49:52,561
weighed 200 pounds.

1208
00:49:52,561 --> 00:49:53,020
Wow.
Holy Shit.

1209
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:56,800
Why ever seen those videos?
Week leaking feet.

1210
00:49:56,801 --> 00:49:58,490
Fucking tall.
Terrified.

1211
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:02,190
That's insane.
I've seen herds of them down and Donna's

1212
00:50:02,191 --> 00:50:07,191
is amazing.
You ever seen those videos of the 

1213
00:50:07,191 --> 00:50:07,191
kangaroos fighting on like the golf 
courses in Australia?

1214
00:50:07,191 --> 00:50:11,520
Yeah.
That's where you see them on the golf 

1215
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,871
course.
It's not the red kangaroo with a gray 

1216
00:50:12,871 --> 00:50:12,871
kangaroos.
A big one,

1217
00:50:12,871 --> 00:50:12,871
right?
Isn't that the Big One?

1218
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:14,800
I don't know if you ever see guys fight 
them.

1219
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:19,980
The eastern gray,
the boxing love Jesus Christ did know 

1220
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:20,770
the red kangaroo does grow to nine feet.
Fucking tall.

1221
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,540
Holy Shit,
dude.

1222
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:26,910
It doesn't weigh as much as the gray,
but the red grows to nine fucking food.

1223
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,250
It the scariest thing because I got.
I got,

1224
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,200
I got from here to the curtain.
I was 10 feet away from it.

1225
00:50:33,201 --> 00:50:38,201
Fuck that.
And I was walking to it because I swear 

1226
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,020
to God it looked like a statue and all 
of a sudden moved to town and I went,

1227
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:42,200
oh my God,
that's fucking alive and Holy Shit.

1228
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:47,980
That is so big yet.
And this comic was just start yelling 

1229
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,450
out the gas fuck in the car.
Whoa man.

1230
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,040
Wow.
Yeah.

1231
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:53,750
That's scary thing.
And they apparently,

1232
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,360
while people are content to them,
I'm sure that's probably why people hate

1233
00:50:56,361 --> 00:50:57,470
them.
They think they're rodents.

1234
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,120
Will they kind of are?
Yeah.

1235
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:01,420
I mean they,
they're kind of girls.

1236
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,520
I think they're kind of cooldowns girls 
must feel so fortunate that are not 

1237
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,761
rats.
All they needed was just a fluffy tail 

1238
00:51:09,761 --> 00:51:10,880
and groovy and no plague will just eat 
nuts.

1239
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:11,950
You don't have to eat garbage.
Okay,

1240
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,380
cool.
Cool.

1241
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:15,320
Have you seen the viral video yet?
Or the rat that goes up the guy's face?

1242
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:16,670
What?
Oh yes.

1243
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:21,671
On the subway.
You get everybody to tell me about New 

1244
00:51:21,671 --> 00:51:21,671
York City.
Rents are fucking terrifying.

1245
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,990
I remember when I lived in New York,
I think I've told this story,

1246
00:51:23,991 --> 00:51:24,920
but I'll tell it again for this.

1247
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:27,940
I was at a gas station once and I went 
to use up sofa a payphone.

1248
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,690
This is how old this story is.
You know,

1249
00:51:29,691 --> 00:51:30,860
there was no,
I didn't have a cell phone,

1250
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,720
so I stepped away from my car.
Well,

1251
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:37,721
my car is pumping gas and I go to the 
payphone and I'm on the payphone and 

1252
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:38,450
while I'm on the payphone I'm watching 
rats,

1253
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:42,380
big ones like cats jumped in the wheel 
housing of my car,

1254
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,240
climb on the tires,
climbed down,

1255
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,950
and I am your car.
Yes,

1256
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:51,040
I'm fucking 15 feet away.
I stepped over to use the payphone and 

1257
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,701
as I'm standing there on the phone,
I've watched these rats and they keep 

1258
00:51:54,701 --> 00:51:57,431
going down this opening in the manhole.
There must have been thousands of them 

1259
00:51:57,431 --> 00:51:59,900
down there the way they were coming up 
so quickly and in,

1260
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:00,270
in,
in,

1261
00:52:00,271 --> 00:52:02,030
in such rapid succession.

1262
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:03,440
One after the other,
one after the other,

1263
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,150
and then down one after the other one.
I'm like,

1264
00:52:05,151 --> 00:52:10,151
there's just a train of them down there.
And I went and reported my car stolen.

1265
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,340
So scary dude.
More rats than people in the air.

1266
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:15,500
Like for.
I think it's for rats for every person.

1267
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:20,530
Oh my God.
I was walking down macdougal street one 

1268
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:20,880
time hump from the seller one night and 
I'm just walking through it and then you

1269
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:25,890
know,
people with their garbage out in the 

1270
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:25,890
street for the garbage men to pick them 
up.

1271
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:28,660
I'm going between garbage and a building
and all of a sudden a rat just will runs

1272
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:31,760
out from the garbage and uses.
My foot is like a hurdle.

1273
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:37,150
Little feet touched my foot and it was 
the most I've ever been like a woman in 

1274
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:42,101
my life.
I started like jumping up and down like 

1275
00:52:42,101 --> 00:52:45,041
screaming because it's like,
it's like that fucking like adrenaline 

1276
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:45,590
rush goes and you can't fight.

1277
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:47,960
You're just like,
ah,

1278
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,460
what the fuck.
It was as big as you were.

1279
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:57,461
Such pussies were such pussies compared 
to animals were so soft and mushy and 

1280
00:52:58,881 --> 00:53:01,970
fleshy.
I think it's the the filth though of the

1281
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:03,260
rats.
That's just the film.

1282
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,280
They're furious.
They're fucking army as much as the 

1283
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,131
filth of those.
They you feel like they carry hepatitis 

1284
00:53:12,131 --> 00:53:15,610
and aids and the black plague isn't that
connected to rants is not all my rent's 

1285
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:17,310
not a bunch of plagues had been about 
ransom.

1286
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:20,260
They're horrible carriers of diseases.
Who is it?

1287
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:25,450
Jim Norton and uh,
I think as Jim Norton and rich Vos used 

1288
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:25,980
to go to this one park in New York and 
sit there and watch

1289
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,350
the rats and they said you'd see like 
thousands of these racks.

1290
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,990
There's so many of them.
Manhattan,

1291
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,810
Manhattan is so crazy with rats.
I was at a pool hall,

1292
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:38,811
wants a New Jersey and this is the 
scariest read I ever saw was with my 

1293
00:53:38,811 --> 00:53:38,811
friend John.
We went,

1294
00:53:38,811 --> 00:53:40,230
we were doing a Gig and we stopped home 
from the Gig to play some pool.

1295
00:53:40,231 --> 00:53:45,231
We stopped this pool,
get out of the car and as I'm walking 

1296
00:53:45,231 --> 00:53:45,750
towards the door,
there's a dumpster like outside.

1297
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,960
And as I passed by the dumpster,
there's the biggest rat I've ever seen 

1298
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,680
in my life.
I mean it is like a raccoon.

1299
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:55,890
It was gigantic.
No bullshit.

1300
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:57,900
I'm not bullshitting.
It was two and a half,

1301
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:02,900
maybe three feet long in the body.
It was enormous and it had these shoes,

1302
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:07,920
huge fucking nasty yellow teeth.
And I don't know if it was sick or 

1303
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:07,920
dying.

1304
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,590
I mean,
it might have been old age because it 

1305
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:12,590
was so big,
it might've been the end of the line for

1306
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,561
this fucking thing,
but it was up on its back legs and was 

1307
00:54:15,561 --> 00:54:17,871
going like this to me and I was 
thinking,

1308
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:20,730
do I kick this thing?
Do I get a rock?

1309
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,720
What the fuck?
I was just such a little girly man.

1310
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:30,980
I'll never forget that noise.
When you got to think with all the 

1311
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:30,980
poison.
They lay down,

1312
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:31,440
like you'll see the signs of the subway 
saying,

1313
00:54:31,441 --> 00:54:32,490
you know,
careful,

1314
00:54:32,491 --> 00:54:34,070
there's like poison everywhere.
Ran with.

1315
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:39,650
They've got to be adapting and mutating 
and we're making some fucking scary rat 

1316
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,300
just chorus,
right?

1317
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:47,330
Yeah.
I mean that's what happens with 

1318
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:47,330
bacteria,
right?

1319
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:50,181
That's where we're at.
Murcia know that staph infection that 

1320
00:54:50,181 --> 00:54:52,240
people get this antibiotic resistant.
That's what it is from fucking.

1321
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:53,550
Is that like the superbug?

1322
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,890
Yeah.
Well the mercer has the super staff.

1323
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,920
It said Mike,
I don't know what it actually stands 

1324
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,220
for,
but it's something resistant staff.

1325
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,160
So it's a antibiotic resistance.
So when people get it,

1326
00:55:05,161 --> 00:55:10,161
it's like really,
really dangerous and it's really just 

1327
00:55:10,161 --> 00:55:10,161
created by human beings,
by,

1328
00:55:10,161 --> 00:55:14,300
you know,
I was fighting off different versions 

1329
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:14,300
until the only ones who survive are 
super fucking strong.

1330
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,640
It's why it just read the other day that
80 percent of all the antibiotics in 

1331
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,131
America are given to animals like they 
pump them full of antibiotics and the 

1332
00:55:22,131 --> 00:55:24,660
same bacteria that we've used 
antibiotics to fight off.

1333
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:29,040
So do animals.
So all the antibiotics they're taking is

1334
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:34,041
causing the bacteria to butyrate,
which is making us immune to these 

1335
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:34,620
antibiotics to live.
Is that true?

1336
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,340
Because,
um,

1337
00:55:35,341 --> 00:55:36,600
I was on a,
on a,

1338
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,870
I did a thing about,
um,

1339
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:44,290
uh,
talked about food inc and I got 

1340
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:45,810
contacted and this is one of the coolest
fucking things about this podcast.

1341
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:50,160
I got contacted by a bunch of scientists
fuck food scientists,

1342
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,510
you know,
people who are,

1343
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:52,150
um,
you know,

1344
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:57,200
involved in the farms and one guy who 
worked for a poultry company.

1345
00:55:58,170 --> 00:55:58,980
And uh,
he was,

1346
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,240
uh,
talking to me about it.

1347
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:05,600
Let me find it here.
That shows the difference between your 

1348
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,671
listeners in ours.
You have all these intelligent people 

1349
00:56:07,671 --> 00:56:07,671
that are really interested.
We get guys who were like,

1350
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,970
you guys are fucked guns.
Well I get those to watch corn too.

1351
00:56:11,971 --> 00:56:16,971
By the way.
Have you ever get the chance to watch 

1352
00:56:16,971 --> 00:56:18,261
the documentary that that's where they 
even go into more detail about having 

1353
00:56:18,261 --> 00:56:19,470
like having holes on the side of the 
cows.

1354
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,940
So creepy and Food Inc.
There's a whole.

1355
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:24,040
Well,
well iT's according to this guy.

1356
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:26,410
First of all when he wanted it and his 
name is Jacob Kim.

1357
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:31,411
So thank you jacob.
At one of the things that he explained 

1358
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:34,861
to me is that chickens are not on 
steroids and then what it is is just 

1359
00:56:34,861 --> 00:56:38,581
genetic selection and they've naturally 
selected birds with bigger and bigger 

1360
00:56:38,581 --> 00:56:38,950
breasts to the point where they're 
freaks.

1361
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,500
So they wouldn't have survive if they 
were a real animal,

1362
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:46,501
but you know,
because we grow them just for their 

1363
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:46,501
tits.
So.

1364
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:49,331
And he also said that What they're 
supposed to do is they're supposed to 

1365
00:56:49,331 --> 00:56:50,650
cycle the antibiotics.
So when a bird is sick,

1366
00:56:50,651 --> 00:56:52,960
so like they have a cycle,
like there's 49 days,

1367
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:55,270
he says to grow a bird.
So in business terms,

1368
00:56:55,271 --> 00:56:58,150
the pharmacy's profits go down as the 
flock stays longer than that.

1369
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:02,080
So in the instance that a 30 day old 
flock get sick while they're supposed to

1370
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:06,640
wait 21 days before they killed them.
So when they,

1371
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:10,030
when they get sick,
they're going to lose like 10 or 11 days

1372
00:57:10,031 --> 00:57:15,031
of profit.
So if they do something like that and 

1373
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:15,031
lose these days a prophet,
you know,

1374
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:18,961
it's like a problem with them.
So some unscrupulous companies don't 

1375
00:57:18,961 --> 00:57:20,200
follow that.
And then they send out the bird,

1376
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:25,260
you know,
like 15 days later in the birds still 

1377
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:25,260
pumped up with antibiotics and has a 
process to your system.

1378
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,400
You're saying,
I can't believe you know,

1379
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:30,390
I fucking data one thing that I didn't 
do right code for.

1380
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:35,420
shut it off your fucking cops.
My new phone number.

1381
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:43,240
you fuckheads for giving out at all to 
one 800 faggots.

1382
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:44,170
Oops.
I said that shit.

1383
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:47,310
A retiree.
Stay away From that word.

1384
00:57:47,311 --> 00:57:48,360
Yeah,
he retired it.

1385
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:50,760
It's been a,
it's been feeding.

1386
00:57:50,761 --> 00:57:53,730
It's been growing in him lately.
I find it a funny word.

1387
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:54,780
Yeah,
I,

1388
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:55,920
I don't.
I mean,

1389
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,890
I'm never going to retire a word,
kind of like.

1390
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Yeah,
I always said like when they tried to 

1391
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,000
retire the n word,
I go,

1392
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,000
what are they going to do?
Put it on a banner and raise it into the

1393
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,791
rafters at like the apollo theater,
right number that's retired United 

1394
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,430
States,
something that were,

1395
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:14,450
some gay guy gets mad at me and I'll 
just flirt with them alone.

1396
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,640
So he goes to site,
don't be mad.

1397
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,680
I don't get right now where I say it,
I go,

1398
00:58:19,681 --> 00:58:20,250
uh,
you know,

1399
00:58:20,251 --> 00:58:25,251
like the,
the reason that like gay men are more 

1400
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:27,771
sexually promiscuous than men and women 
is the [inaudible] because they've got 

1401
00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:29,160
time and energy from not fighting all 
the time because a gay fight,

1402
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:30,030
you know,
it's Just like,

1403
00:58:30,031 --> 00:58:31,830
hey,
those shoes don't match your belt.

1404
00:58:31,831 --> 00:58:32,460
And he's liKe,
really?

1405
00:58:32,461 --> 00:58:33,800
Let's fuck,
you know,

1406
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:36,450
like that's gay guys beat the shit out.
And that's the other thing.

1407
00:58:36,451 --> 00:58:39,030
Gay guys can beat the shit out of each 
other and the cops show up.

1408
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,080
Like what happened?
He punched me,

1409
00:58:40,081 --> 00:58:41,100
will hit them back.
Faggot.

1410
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:42,690
That'S funny.

1411
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:43,750
Um,
so anyway,

1412
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:45,880
back to this guy.
So the guy was explaining to me,

1413
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,580
so no steroids for chickens,
that's not true.

1414
00:58:48,581 --> 00:58:51,760
But there it is true for cows.
So cows are jacked,

1415
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:57,180
cows are totally jacked up on hormones,
no hormones at all or no hormones,

1416
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:00,030
no steroids on chickens because I,
I eat,

1417
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,780
I eat all grass fed stuff.
Yeah.

1418
00:59:01,781 --> 00:59:04,210
I order all my meat from us.
Wellness meats.

1419
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:05,340
Yeah.
Uh,

1420
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,040
no,
no.

1421
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:07,970
It's good.
Grass fed beef tastes really good.

1422
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:10,510
Fucking had a strip last night.
And pork chops,

1423
00:59:10,511 --> 00:59:12,100
grass fed pork chops,
you know,

1424
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:17,210
I agree.
We need pop shields by the way because 

1425
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,310
pork chops makes a big terrible noise in
people's ears.

1426
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,220
I ordered those.
I'm soon.

1427
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,710
But I uh,
yeah.

1428
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:22,040
I eat

1429
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,230
a paleo diet.
Do you know that?

1430
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:25,960
Yeah.
So I eat that diet and,

1431
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:28,490
and um,
in all the grass fed shit and my chicken

1432
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:32,210
breasts that I get are grass fed and 
they're fucking massive.

1433
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,520
And I'm like,
this is weird.

1434
00:59:34,521 --> 00:59:36,990
I heard the whole thing was when you buy
organic and grass,

1435
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,280
that you're Just not getting the fuck 
they're bigger chemicals on the grass.

1436
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:47,780
How is that possible?
I don't know what's going on in that 

1437
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:48,600
grass.
Oh,

1438
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,930
hey.
So what did you think about that movie

1439
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,860
to avoid?
I saw it last night.

1440
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:56,700
I shut it off after the car accident 
when the fucking the parents were killed

1441
00:59:56,701 --> 00:59:57,510
in a car accident.
I'm like,

1442
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,130
first of all,
you've just,

1443
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,740
you showed me a girl who's a prostitute 
and a stripper.

1444
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:03,780
Okay.
And then you showed her happy family.

1445
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:08,930
Fuck you.
That's more science fiction in the dmt 

1446
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:09,150
shit because that's just shitty writing 
to me.

1447
01:00:09,151 --> 01:00:11,460
You're showing me this.
This girl loves her brother.

1448
01:00:11,461 --> 01:00:13,020
And how much do you love me?
I love you so much.

1449
01:00:13,021 --> 01:00:14,520
You're just jerking with my emotions,
man.

1450
01:00:14,521 --> 01:00:16,440
This isn't good story writing.
This is nonsense.

1451
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:19,380
What I liked about the movie was the 
first person perspective.

1452
01:00:19,381 --> 01:00:21,090
It was like I was in a video game that 
was cool.

1453
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:26,450
King of the.
I even remember like you could actually 

1454
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:26,730
see it where the character blinks.
They would have it like every,

1455
01:00:26,731 --> 01:00:28,650
like randomly every five,
10 seconds.

1456
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:34,070
And then when he goes into the dmt trip,
did you think that was a pretty 

1457
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:34,070
realistic?

1458
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:35,410
No,
I thought it was interesting.

1459
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,670
Yeah.
But it wasn't realistic.

1460
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:42,030
First of all,
you couldn't explain what the dmt trip 

1461
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:45,631
looks to a person.
You couldn't recreate it with like cgi.

1462
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:48,130
Right.
Because what it is isn't possible.

1463
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:50,170
What your will.
You'll see.

1464
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,700
It doesn't make any sense what I'm 
saying.

1465
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:57,030
But when you have a dmt trip,
you're not seeing anything that can be 

1466
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,240
recreated.
It's impossible to recreate.

1467
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:03,270
It's like when I'm watching there was 
just some swirly cool shit and like 

1468
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:04,330
really interesting.
But when you see it,

1469
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:06,490
when you see a dmt trip,
it's just,

1470
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:11,910
first of all,
it's a million things at the same time 

1471
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:12,280
it's a bunch of different things.
It's no matter how you,

1472
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:14,370
depending how you look at it,
it's a different

1473
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:19,440
thing.
I really liked how there was so much 

1474
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,160
detail too because I've noticed this on 
past hallucinate trips before,

1475
01:01:20,161 --> 01:01:25,161
like,
like little things like after he was 

1476
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:25,161
tripping,
like he shut this door and the door kind

1477
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:27,030
of have like a red pulse when he showed 
it and stuff like that.

1478
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:28,830
Now,
what did you think about the big,

1479
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:33,950
even at the very beginning where you 
were hypnotized in a seizure where it's 

1480
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:38,361
just flashing all those logos crazy like
that happens throughout the movie and 

1481
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:38,640
some points you're just like,
all right,

1482
01:01:38,641 --> 01:01:40,270
they're brainwashing me right now.
This is,

1483
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,020
this is from the government or google.
Hey dom,

1484
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:48,060
that kind of shit though.
I'm starting to wonder about that with 

1485
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:48,060
every.
I'm such a,

1486
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,130
I'm not a conspiracy theorist,
but I am paranoid.

1487
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:55,520
So really I'm completely paranoid and a 
or I can get there and I've got to like 

1488
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,880
a close the neuropathways,
you know,

1489
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:02,881
and just fucking try to bring myself 
back from it because I can go totally 

1490
01:02:02,881 --> 01:02:05,940
into that where I'll start thinking like
anything like a fucking sitcom,

1491
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:06,450
you know,
like,

1492
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,650
well,
you had a real freakout recently.

1493
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,460
We talked about this on the green room,
uh,

1494
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:12,400
where you,
you,

1495
01:02:12,401 --> 01:02:14,350
uh,
you got super paranoid from weed.

1496
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,490
Yeah.
And I've had,

1497
01:02:15,491 --> 01:02:17,350
it happened.
It was the second time it happened.

1498
01:02:17,351 --> 01:02:18,940
The first time I had a pot cookie in 
Australia.

1499
01:02:18,941 --> 01:02:20,340
The second time I just smoked.

1500
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,590
But you said something really 
interesting to me and he said,

1501
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:23,460
I can't smoke pot.
I said,

1502
01:02:23,461 --> 01:02:24,480
yes you can.
He said,

1503
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:26,350
I have to go to therapy first.
Yeah,

1504
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,040
like what do you have to go therapy 
about breathing exercises?

1505
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:34,041
I don't fucking know,
but it just put me into panic attacks 

1506
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:34,041
and.
Well,

1507
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:34,980
I thought,
I thought it was just the wheat.

1508
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:36,830
The first time it happened.
It didn't happen.

1509
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:39,180
We smoked weed before.
Didn't we smoke weed in Florida?

1510
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,260
You know,
it's another funny story.

1511
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:45,660
Know what's a funny story.
One time I was at a medicinal marijuana 

1512
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,490
benefit that you were like playing.
You were like doing a show at the comedy

1513
01:02:47,491 --> 01:02:48,630
store for him.
Calico,

1514
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:53,280
brian kaylin and I came over and uh,
some girl was with you like,

1515
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:55,530
like that was in charge of it or 
something.

1516
01:02:55,531 --> 01:03:00,531
and she goes,
she had these muffins and I had no idea 

1517
01:03:00,531 --> 01:03:00,920
that I didn't know that you were a big 
pothead.

1518
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:02,370
I didn't know that.
What it was.

1519
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,250
And I was starving and she goes,
do you want a muffin?

1520
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:05,940
And unlike,
yeah,

1521
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,370
have a muffin.
So I ate the muffin and I'm like,

1522
01:03:08,371 --> 01:03:09,630
these are really good,
and she's like,

1523
01:03:09,631 --> 01:03:11,720
yes.
And then I count goes,

1524
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,600
what's a show?
And you go,

1525
01:03:12,601 --> 01:03:14,460
oh,
it's a benefit for medicinal marijuana.

1526
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:15,810
And I go,
it clicked.

1527
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,110
I went,
did I just fucking eat a pot muffin?

1528
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:20,880
And she says,
yeah.

1529
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,200
And I went like this,
I can't go.

1530
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,240
I gotta go,
I gotta go,

1531
01:03:24,241 --> 01:03:29,241
I gotta get home right now.
And I drove home as fast as I could 

1532
01:03:29,241 --> 01:03:31,680
because I knew it would take 20 minutes 
for it to kick in and I just didn't want

1533
01:03:31,681 --> 01:03:35,070
to be out with it going on and just be.
And I was like,

1534
01:03:35,071 --> 01:03:35,610
fuck,
I got it.

1535
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:40,611
Because I had done.
I'd eaten pot cookies before and I was 

1536
01:03:40,611 --> 01:03:40,611
like,
I gotta get the fuck what happened?

1537
01:03:40,611 --> 01:03:45,320
So I drove home as fast as I could.
I get home and it kicks in and I just 

1538
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,470
didn't have the fucking greatest 
experience all alone.

1539
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,900
And I'm having like a wonderful night 
and I called a girl.

1540
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:50,250
I know,
can you go to 7:11

1541
01:03:50,251 --> 01:03:51,120
for me?
I need this,

1542
01:03:51,121 --> 01:03:51,690
this,
this,

1543
01:03:51,691 --> 01:03:54,150
this,
and I just was laughing and she's like,

1544
01:03:54,151 --> 01:03:55,490
you use your high and like,
yeah,

1545
01:03:55,491 --> 01:04:00,491
yeah.
But the first time I did it was in 

1546
01:04:00,491 --> 01:04:02,661
Australia and I had such a great time.
I had to do a show three nights in a row

1547
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:05,220
by the third night.
The same exact audience.

1548
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,870
Oh my god.
Every night.

1549
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,870
That's ridiculous.
So by the third show I'm out of shit,

1550
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:10,500
you know,
I've,

1551
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:14,960
I'm down to my worst stuff and I'm like.
So right before I went onstage,

1552
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:19,970
I hit a pot cooking thinking be,
and I did like an hour and 45 minutes 

1553
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:22,530
and they're like,
it was fucking brilliant.

1554
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:24,060
And unlike,
what did I talk about?

1555
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:26,370
They're like,
you've talked about the mach three razor

1556
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,380
for an hour.
And I'm like,

1557
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:29,370
really?
And they're like,

1558
01:04:29,371 --> 01:04:33,810
we don't even have it here.
That's ready to record yourself.

1559
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:34,550
I would have been

1560
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:39,550
great.
I've had a two freakouts were one went 

1561
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:40,100
to the hospital and it wasn't related 
top related.

1562
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:45,180
Uh,
and once we're in the ambulance came to 

1563
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:45,180
my house and I,
I,

1564
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:48,430
but now I don't get that anymore.
I don't get that anxiety or anything 

1565
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:48,710
like that unless I eat it and then when 
I eat it,

1566
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:49,700
it's not good.
Well,

1567
01:04:49,701 --> 01:04:54,701
also,
I mean it depends on what's going on in 

1568
01:04:54,701 --> 01:04:55,460
your life at the time.
you think I should be getting paranoid.

1569
01:04:55,461 --> 01:04:57,860
I should be dead right now because I 
smoke pot every day.

1570
01:04:57,861 --> 01:04:59,130
My life's crazy.
You know?

1571
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:00,380
Life's crazy.
Yeah.

1572
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:00,920
Well,
you know,

1573
01:05:00,921 --> 01:05:03,490
just all the shit lately,
if that's what you're saying.

1574
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:05,780
No,
I don't think you're crazy,

1575
01:05:05,781 --> 01:05:08,210
man.
I think your life is saying her now than

1576
01:05:08,211 --> 01:05:11,110
it was just a couple of years ago.
Do you remember you.

1577
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:11,860
Well,
you know,

1578
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,330
I don't wanna get into personal details,
but you know what I'm talking about.

1579
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,350
Um,
the,

1580
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,440
the,
the problem is all right and here's the 

1581
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:20,440
number

1582
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,190
one problem with eating it is it nobody 
knows what the fuck it does to you.

1583
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:27,270
You know,
nobody tells you they just sell these 

1584
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:27,270
things at the pot stores.
What was that?

1585
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:27,270
A pot brownie.
Oh,

1586
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:31,180
I'll try eating it.
Not knowing that it's way more powerful.

1587
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:36,860
Way more powerful and it lasts forever.
I hate a pot brownie wants and I swear 

1588
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:41,221
to god it lasted 12 hours,
so this first one lasted about 12 

1589
01:05:41,221 --> 01:05:43,390
fucking and they told me it was funny.
I was having a great time.

1590
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:44,650
I was in adelaide,
Australia.

1591
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:49,800
I'd been drinking all day and then I ate
half a cookie and they said just eat 

1592
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,620
half.
Nothing happened.

1593
01:05:50,621 --> 01:05:51,760
I go,
I'm going to have the other half.

1594
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:52,840
And they were like,
all right.

1595
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:56,890
I did the other half having a great time
and all of a sudden I turned around.

1596
01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:02,070
I got up to go to the kitchen.
I turned around and looked at theSe 

1597
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:03,841
girls and I go make it stop.
WhAtever we have to do to stop this.

1598
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:06,070
Let's stop your trip.
Yeah.

1599
01:06:06,071 --> 01:06:06,940
I was like,
can we,

1600
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,250
is there any way to like abort right 
now?

1601
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:10,900
And they're like,
all right,

1602
01:06:10,901 --> 01:06:12,010
calm down.
And I'm like,

1603
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:12,520
no,
no,

1604
01:06:12,521 --> 01:06:14,230
no.
We need to fucking stop this.

1605
01:06:14,231 --> 01:06:15,820
and they're like,
why are you being such a bitch?

1606
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,180
I don't know.
But.

1607
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:19,840
But what started happening,
it was around a bunch of girls,

1608
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:21,190
man,
let's pull it together.

1609
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:26,290
Hey,
remember when excerpt out of fear 

1610
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:26,290
factor,
I had to sit with all those girl interns

1611
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:30,281
in their car and put it together though 
he didn't yell at anybody to make it 

1612
01:06:30,281 --> 01:06:33,551
stop.
I thought my eyeballs were trapped and 

1613
01:06:33,551 --> 01:06:33,551
when he first came here from Ohio,
he had nothing.

1614
01:06:33,551 --> 01:06:34,940
He had no resistance.
He was used to this Ohio.

1615
01:06:34,941 --> 01:06:39,941
We'd,
which you might as well been mixed 

1616
01:06:39,941 --> 01:06:42,340
mexican brick weed,
might've well been smoking talcum 

1617
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:42,340
powder.
It's nonsense.

1618
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,720
That's a terrible example.
Gold bond and I gave him a lollipop.

1619
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,580
These,
these fucking beyond bomb.

1620
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:51,820
Before beyond bomb went to jail.
They were operating a multimillion 

1621
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:56,471
dollar operation at oakland and the dea 
rated them during the bush 

1622
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:59,261
administration and we had to.
We had one on the way there and then 

1623
01:06:59,261 --> 01:06:59,261
half hour later you're like,
you feel anything?

1624
01:06:59,261 --> 01:06:59,261
I'm like,
no,

1625
01:06:59,261 --> 01:07:01,000
not relating.
And so we took another one because we.

1626
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:06,160
I think you were new to the lollipops to
at the time we didn't really know the 

1627
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,550
length of how long the wait may panic 
attack right now.

1628
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:10,310
sitting in where he drops me and goes,
oh,

1629
01:07:10,311 --> 01:07:15,311
hang out here in this trailer.
It was like the trailer with all the 

1630
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:17,501
managers and directors and producers and
stuff like that and I'm just thinking 

1631
01:07:17,501 --> 01:07:21,571
about not knowing anybody and it hits me
were all super friendly but they're 

1632
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:22,670
totally cool,
but I mean my heart started pounding.

1633
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:27,671
I started freaking out.
I go and sit on the curb and then in 

1634
01:07:27,671 --> 01:07:27,671
between breaks you come on and like,
how are you doing?

1635
01:07:27,671 --> 01:07:27,790
I'm like,
dude,

1636
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:30,260
I'm so fucking stone and having a panic 
attack,

1637
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:30,980
and you're like,
dude,

1638
01:07:30,981 --> 01:07:33,000
I still have a mic on her when it's a 
now everything.

1639
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:39,280
Everybody in the trailer now hearS me 
and he like dropped me off in these 

1640
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,660
interns car and just sat there and 
talked about fucking sex and the city or

1641
01:07:41,661 --> 01:07:44,120
something.
I think

1642
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,290
I told you this.
I know this,

1643
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:50,291
these,
these little dudes that I used to kind 

1644
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:52,241
of.
It was a girl that was friends with her 

1645
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:54,281
little brothers and they were big 
potheads in high school and we used to 

1646
01:07:54,281 --> 01:07:55,160
hang around.
We're in college at their house and they

1647
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,840
always.
They were up to no,

1648
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:00,440
like they grow it in their backyard.
They tried everything so they were.

1649
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:02,890
They were making pot cookies one night 
and they make them,

1650
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:05,120
they leave them out,
that kind of a wealthy family.

1651
01:08:05,121 --> 01:08:10,121
They have like a maid and everything.
They leave the pot cookies out because 

1652
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:13,000
parents are always out of town.
The maid puts them in baggies and puts 

1653
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,580
them in the.
In the cookie canister.

1654
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,280
Dad comes,
grabs

1655
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:21,310
two cookies,
cookies and eat some rushed to the 

1656
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:22,730
hospital thinking he's having a heart 
attack.

1657
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:25,760
So I say to the kid like,
they're telling me the story.

1658
01:08:25,761 --> 01:08:26,720
I'm like,
so did you tell them?

1659
01:08:26,721 --> 01:08:27,530
They're like,
fuck,

1660
01:08:27,531 --> 01:08:29,270
no,
that's hilarious.

1661
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:31,790
So did he ever figure out that he was a.
I don't medicate it.

1662
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:33,290
Like the whole family had a panic 
attack.

1663
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:33,800
Hey,
yeah,

1664
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,850
you know,
I'm one kid went to jail because a,

1665
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:40,640
they dose their teacher up in school.
They gave the teacher pot cookies.

1666
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:45,700
I remember in high school used to always
try to sneak in a laxatives and our 

1667
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:47,150
teachers coffees and stuff and I look 
back and I'm like,

1668
01:08:47,151 --> 01:08:52,151
that's fucking rude because I mean,
I remember getting dangerous too.

1669
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:57,380
It's an evil I heard of.
I heard about a fraternity wanting all 

1670
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:57,810
these dumb fraternity price.
I forget where it was his college at,

1671
01:08:57,811 --> 01:08:59,600
like George Mason when I was doing a 
show there.

1672
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,200
They go,
oh yeah,

1673
01:09:00,201 --> 01:09:03,800
we got this fraternity that at the end 
of hell week they,

1674
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:05,930
uh,
they feed them spaghetti.

1675
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:11,020
They give them this big spaghetti dinner
that the lake little sisters make for 

1676
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:11,300
them and then they feed them like 
chocolate pudding,

1677
01:09:11,301 --> 01:09:16,301
but it's full of x slacks and then they 
make them climb a tree and they've got 

1678
01:09:16,301 --> 01:09:20,921
to spend the night in a tree.
Like the top guy gets to go to the top 

1679
01:09:20,921 --> 01:09:22,610
of the tree and all the way down.
So like if you're an asshole,

1680
01:09:22,611 --> 01:09:27,611
you're down at the bottom shitty.
Just all shitty things are so 

1681
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:33,251
disgusting.
They're juSt preparing you for just to 

1682
01:09:33,251 --> 01:09:35,951
be fucked with and to be in some country
group where you get to fuck with new 

1683
01:09:35,951 --> 01:09:37,280
people.
Just taking advantage of the people that

1684
01:09:37,281 --> 01:09:40,070
have the least amount of power and the 
people that want the most from you.

1685
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:45,280
The other good thing about fraternities 
was going to their parties and like 

1686
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,730
fucking those sorority girls stand up at
a fraternity wants.

1687
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:50,200
I'm pretty sure I know as opposed to a.
I did a lot of college,

1688
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:55,340
a lot of college gigs and like weird 
spots like cafeterias and shit rec rooms

1689
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:59,530
and did one in the cafeteria where I had
to stand on actual cafeteria tables.

1690
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,270
It was like,
that was the stage.

1691
01:10:01,271 --> 01:10:03,650
It was a table and still on a cafeteria 
table.

1692
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,060
But um,
one,

1693
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:10,180
one fraternity stunt that I heard that 
was the craziest was they made this guy 

1694
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,920
drink water and he died from water.
Oh,

1695
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,880
water.
What's that called?

1696
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:14,610
Hitting a tree.
Mia.

1697
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:17,000
Yeah.
pretty much are drowning yourself.

1698
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,100
Yeah.
It's not nuts style,

1699
01:10:18,101 --> 01:10:21,970
but just turns out all your salt and 
then you know,

1700
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:24,230
this happens with this new starbucks 
size.

1701
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:29,290
Jesus christ.
I've been drinking this ice tea forever 

1702
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:31,310
and I'm still only like bulletins.
Hold it up to the camera.

1703
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:33,050
It's for folks that don't see it at 
home.

1704
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:35,990
This is the new starbucks.
Thirty two ounce and this is a,

1705
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:38,880
this is just an ice coffee or an iced 
tea rather.

1706
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:39,840
Yeah.
Here's the,

1707
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:43,170
here's the old size,
here's the other side.

1708
01:10:43,171 --> 01:10:44,850
And it's thicker too or bigger.

1709
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,060
It's not only tolerant,
but it's wider,

1710
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:51,350
wider.
I got that hit in a marathon.

1711
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:53,300
I ran a marathon.
You drank too much water.

1712
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:58,690
I panicked like,
you just shouldn't change your fucking 

1713
01:10:58,690 --> 01:10:58,690
habits,
but everybody goes,

1714
01:10:58,690 --> 01:10:58,690
oh,
you know,

1715
01:10:58,690 --> 01:10:58,990
make sure you hydrate,
make sure you're hydrated,

1716
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,590
make sure you hydrate.
So I drank like,

1717
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,440
fucking like 10 bottles of water before 
the race.

1718
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:04,610
Like,
oh wow.

1719
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:09,700
And uh,
I knew I started pissing like so much 

1720
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:10,340
that I went,
fuck,

1721
01:11:10,341 --> 01:11:12,890
I'm going to piss all my salt out.
So I went up to.

1722
01:11:12,891 --> 01:11:17,891
I never thought about that.
Every day in my life I went up to the 

1723
01:11:17,891 --> 01:11:19,560
coffee table and a coffee and I go,
I go to this woman.

1724
01:11:19,561 --> 01:11:20,610
I go,
do you have salt packets?

1725
01:11:20,611 --> 01:11:22,980
I need fucking salt.
I just wanted to down some salt,

1726
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:28,350
just big fat black woman goes,
who puts salt in their coffee?

1727
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:30,960
And I'm like,
just get me fucking salt.

1728
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:35,070
And I knew it was going to fucking 
happen and sure enough I hit like the 16

1729
01:11:35,071 --> 01:11:39,750
mile mark and I hit a wall.
I'd never hit my life because I was just

1730
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:42,130
nothing left in.
Never heard of anybody doing it.

1731
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,890
I never even thought about.
I know a woman,

1732
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:45,030
um,
died in,

1733
01:11:45,031 --> 01:11:50,031
I think it was sacramento.
I want to Say there was a radio stuff 

1734
01:11:50,031 --> 01:11:50,031
they did was,
she had a drink,

1735
01:11:50,031 --> 01:11:51,690
a lot of water.
That was like a year and a half ago,

1736
01:11:51,691 --> 01:11:56,691
two years.
And it was like we were on the cross 

1737
01:11:56,691 --> 01:11:56,870
town radio station,
you know,

1738
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,880
we were on like one of their competitors
stations and they were telling us a 

1739
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:01,880
story.
Like,

1740
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:01,880
how fucked up it was,
you know,

1741
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:02,330
that's,
that's.

1742
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,450
I remember that shit man.
Death,

1743
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:08,130
some water woman who is trying to win 
like on xbox for kids.

1744
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:11,820
I think some northern California 
sacramento,

1745
01:12:11,821 --> 01:12:12,660
I thought it was,
but yeah,

1746
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:14,850
it might be san jose,
but in northern California,

1747
01:12:14,851 --> 01:12:15,990
whatever it is,
but it's just like,

1748
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:18,120
fuck man,
drinking water,

1749
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,580
drinking water were so bitchy.
Were so fragile.

1750
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:22,320
This is there a dog out there that could
die.

1751
01:12:22,321 --> 01:12:24,090
Because he drinks too much water.
No,

1752
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:26,910
we suck.
We're such pussies.

1753
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:27,870
You have it.
It's,

1754
01:12:27,871 --> 01:12:29,520
that's an anomaly.
That's like a.

1755
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,340
Then you see guys that I know,
dude,

1756
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:36,420
who this fucking crazy dude that I know 
from New Jersey who drank bleach and 

1757
01:12:36,781 --> 01:12:41,781
he's a lot.
He's the dumb is this guy went to penn 

1758
01:12:41,781 --> 01:12:42,570
state and my friends all know him and 
they all talked about him.

1759
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:45,450
I finally got to meet him and he's just 
a fucking maniac.

1760
01:12:45,451 --> 01:12:50,451
He sells mack trucks now.
I think that's what he does for a 

1761
01:12:50,451 --> 01:12:50,451
living.
And uh,

1762
01:12:50,451 --> 01:12:50,790
they,
they knew him from this fraternity.

1763
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:53,220
They're like,
this dude fell off the roof for time.

1764
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,720
Everybody knows a guy like that.
And I'm like,

1765
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,550
why would you keep climbing up there?
And they're like,

1766
01:12:56,551 --> 01:12:58,770
they put,
they would like put like signs don't let

1767
01:12:58,771 --> 01:13:01,560
them on the roof to still go up there 
and fall off.

1768
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:04,230
So they tell me he chugged bleach and 
I'm like,

1769
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,540
I get a shot of it or something.
And I go,

1770
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:11,541
I don't believe it.
I don't believe until I need them one 

1771
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:11,541
night or I see him and I go,
hey dude,

1772
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:11,541
uh,
I go,

1773
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:16,131
hey dude,
I think his name is reagan or something 

1774
01:13:16,131 --> 01:13:16,131
like that.
Is it true you,

1775
01:13:16,131 --> 01:13:16,131
you drank bleach?
And he's like,

1776
01:13:16,131 --> 01:13:17,400
yeah.
And I go,

1777
01:13:17,401 --> 01:13:18,690
well,
why?

1778
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:24,050
and he goes,
because it said on the bottle if you 

1779
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:24,930
drink this you will die.
Am I dead?

1780
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,440
no.
And that was like his whole point,

1781
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:30,390
like a philosopher.

1782
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:35,800
I know homeless people used to drink 
rubbing alcohol when they couldn't get 

1783
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,950
real alcohol or something like that.
You remember michael dukakis?

1784
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:39,510
yeah.
Michael dukakis.

1785
01:13:39,511 --> 01:13:42,180
When he ran for president who's running 
for president and his wife,

1786
01:13:42,181 --> 01:13:47,181
kitty dukakis was such an alcoholic that
she'd be began drinking shaving cream 

1787
01:13:47,181 --> 01:13:48,750
and shit like that.
Yeah,

1788
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,490
she,
she was drinking like nutty shit and she

1789
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:56,510
got rushed to the hospital.
I believe he was shaving cream or 

1790
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:56,510
something,
you know,

1791
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:59,360
shave something nutty.
Do you work the stress factory in New 

1792
01:13:59,360 --> 01:13:59,550
Jersey?
I have vinnie brand told me a story.

1793
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:04,551
I forget the comic.
I think he was one of those like famous 

1794
01:14:04,551 --> 01:14:07,221
prop comics,
but in his day was like a really bad 

1795
01:14:07,221 --> 01:14:09,690
alcoholic and I'm like,
I could be wrong with who the comic is,

1796
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:11,650
but a lenny shoultz lenny,

1797
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,950
I don't think it was lenny because I 
think the guys did is not that izzy,

1798
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:16,870
I don't know whoever it is I think is 
dead now.

1799
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:21,871
But glen,
he was really old fucking vinnie's 

1800
01:14:21,871 --> 01:14:24,181
office and drank cologne.
Like he came out and it smelled his 

1801
01:14:24,181 --> 01:14:25,190
breath and was like,
what the,

1802
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,650
like he was that much of an alcoholic 
like chicks.

1803
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:33,660
Have you ever heard of it?
Like when girlS fall asleep with a 

1804
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:34,780
hairdryers in their beds,
that's like an actual,

1805
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:39,860
you know,
a lot of girls do that to keep warm or 

1806
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:39,900
something like that or a sound of it.
And they,

1807
01:14:39,901 --> 01:14:42,130
uh,
if you ever heard of that before,

1808
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,800
they just full blast hairdryer and they 
stay in their bed,

1809
01:14:44,801 --> 01:14:48,640
in their bed and it's actually a 
condition that's awesome.

1810
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:49,960
People are so nuts,
man.

1811
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,810
This kitty dukakis thing,
um,

1812
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:53,980
she was rubbing alcohol.
that's what she drank,

1813
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,220
you know,
um,

1814
01:14:56,210 --> 01:14:58,300
I guess she was rushed to the hospital.

1815
01:14:58,330 --> 01:14:59,440
I mean,
I guess you can die,

1816
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,780
but how crazy is that this guy was 
running for president,

1817
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,960
which just goes to show you how much 
your world is falling apart when you're 

1818
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:07,060
running for president.
You know what I mean?

1819
01:15:07,061 --> 01:15:08,490
How much effort do you have to put into 
it?

1820
01:15:08,491 --> 01:15:11,740
It's a reason why these guys go gray 
like a year after they get into office,

1821
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:13,730
you know,
the amount of stress and the,

1822
01:15:13,731 --> 01:15:15,370
the.
I mean he wasn't paying attention to his

1823
01:15:15,371 --> 01:15:16,420
wife at all.
You don't.

1824
01:15:16,421 --> 01:15:19,210
You think you'd know if your wife was 
ready to drink rubbing alcohol.

1825
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:19,930
I just,
baby.

1826
01:15:19,931 --> 01:15:22,210
How you feeling or thinking about 
drinking some.

1827
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:26,410
let's talk.
Hold on.

1828
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,510
Listen,
I can't talk to run for president,

1829
01:15:28,511 --> 01:15:31,270
but don't drink alone.
I'll be back in 20 days.

1830
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:33,800
Maybe I'm talking about drinking some 
room clean.

1831
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:39,950
Don't drink my perfume.
She was apparently she was taking 

1832
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:42,310
antidepressants or something too.
She had been taking an antidepressant,

1833
01:15:42,311 --> 01:15:44,890
prescribed antidepressants back in the 
eighties.

1834
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:50,070
You know,
where they want to make a ground up 

1835
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:50,070
leeches.
What did they,

1836
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:51,160
would they serve you in 1989 for 
antidepressants?

1837
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:57,410
Cocaine killed the whole.
What can I enter the questions they 

1838
01:15:57,410 --> 01:15:57,410
have?
They didn't have the good shit.

1839
01:15:57,410 --> 01:15:58,360
Just drink a coke.
Thorazine?

1840
01:15:58,380 --> 01:15:58,970
No,
that was for.

1841
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:00,870
Listen,
that list gets a friend or something.

1842
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:02,290
I dunno.
prozac,

1843
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:07,291
right?
Wasn't prozac and whether the early 

1844
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:07,291
ones.
Dude,

1845
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:08,020
I know so many fucking parents that dope
up their kids.

1846
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:11,230
I know two parentS where their kids are 
just wild.

1847
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,930
They're crazy and the parents don't pay 
much attention to the kids.

1848
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:19,110
So the kids are on drugs.
I have to put the kids on some 

1849
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:19,110
medications.
Dogs.

1850
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:22,630
People give dogs depressant.
So fucking anxiety drugs and my old 

1851
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:24,100
neighbor,
she used to live down the street from me

1852
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:29,340
and you know,
I didn't know her that much but he was 

1853
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:29,340
just,
hi,

1854
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:29,340
how you doing?
What's going on?

1855
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:29,350
And her kid was,
you know,

1856
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:34,351
always running around and you know,
playing fucking dragons and swords like 

1857
01:16:34,351 --> 01:16:34,820
kids,
do you know,

1858
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:37,170
I was kinda gotta get them on something.
There's something wrong with my baby.

1859
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:38,530
I'm like,
there's nothing wrong with your kid as a

1860
01:16:38,531 --> 01:16:42,460
kid when kids are fucking four and you 
work all day and you come home,

1861
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,080
they're wired to the gills.
Okay.

1862
01:16:44,081 --> 01:16:47,230
no one's watching what they're eating or
eating candy all day and they want to go

1863
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,180
crazy and go nutty.
You're just old.

1864
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,980
You forgot what it's like to be a five 
year old.

1865
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,990
This is how five year olds are.
They're fucking crazy.

1866
01:16:52,991 --> 01:16:56,410
Five year old boys are crazy and she had
them doped up and then this other lady I

1867
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:58,600
know,
same fucking thing or kid was wild.

1868
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:00,940
He was running around crashing cars into
everything.

1869
01:17:00,941 --> 01:17:01,860
She's like,
something wrong with them.

1870
01:17:01,861 --> 01:17:02,710
I got to take him to the doctor.
I'm like,

1871
01:17:02,711 --> 01:17:05,170
there's nothing wrong with a fucking kid
fucking kid.

1872
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,920
So she's got them doped up to,
you know,

1873
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:09,500
it's like jay jeffrey.
It's amazing that that's even an option.

1874
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:10,050
Jim jeffrey

1875
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:13,310
said his mom used to wake them up every 
morning with a glass of orange juice and

1876
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:17,450
ritalin and she would just open up,
like he said,

1877
01:17:17,451 --> 01:17:22,451
he didn't even know what it was.
She'd just be like open up and just pop 

1878
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:22,451
them in his mouth and make them drink it
down.

1879
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:22,520
Well,
you know,

1880
01:17:22,521 --> 01:17:27,521
when you develop a kid incorrectly,
some people are just mentally 

1881
01:17:27,521 --> 01:17:27,521
imbalanced.
That is a fact.

1882
01:17:27,521 --> 01:17:31,871
There's some people that their hormone 
levels are the chemical levels of the 

1883
01:17:31,871 --> 01:17:32,270
brand or just fucked up and they do need
some help,

1884
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:35,660
but there's other people that just were.
Somebody raised them shitty,

1885
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:38,720
just did a terrible job,
barely fucking paid attention to him and

1886
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:42,560
the kid developed all this nutty 
behavior and getting it out of someone.

1887
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:46,040
It's way harder to get something out of 
something.

1888
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:51,070
Someone once it's in there,
once they've already developed some 

1889
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:51,740
wacky patterns of behavior and they have
like certain associations,

1890
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,680
very difficult to get that to change,
but if you could just,

1891
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:59,860
you know,
it's way easier to raise on correctly 

1892
01:17:59,860 --> 01:17:59,860
from the beginning to try to turn 
someone around once they're fucked up.

1893
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:02,150
It'S like how many people that you know,
that are a mess,

1894
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:05,210
that have fucked up lives ever.
Pull it together ever.

1895
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,280
You know,
ever so few,

1896
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:12,300
but so few people quit anything.
I know a chick who used to prostitute 

1897
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,530
herself and she was like the nicest girl
in the world.

1898
01:18:15,531 --> 01:18:18,550
I knew two girls that kinda like went to
prostitution and they,

1899
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:23,570
you wouldn't think either these girls,
but she was doing like craig little 

1900
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:25,910
craigslist hooking and shit and um,
she had,

1901
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:30,930
you know,
it had like the molestation thing and 

1902
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:32,030
all that fucked up stuff and she went to
therapy and jay and I said,

1903
01:18:32,031 --> 01:18:34,100
why don't you tell what your therapist 
say about it?

1904
01:18:34,101 --> 01:18:35,270
And she's like,
I don't tell them.

1905
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:36,230
I'm like,
well,

1906
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:41,680
you need to tell your therapist that you
were molested and all this stuff and 

1907
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:45,250
work on that shit.
And she did eventually and she's like 

1908
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:46,730
married and I think she's had in her 
life is good.

1909
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:48,740
It,
she really is a product of like,

1910
01:18:48,741 --> 01:18:51,890
it actually cleaned up that problem.
people can do it,

1911
01:18:51,891 --> 01:18:53,160
man.
You can change it.

1912
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:56,990
Just you've got to be fucking goddamn 
committed staying on that track.

1913
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:59,930
You almost have to become addicted to 
changing,

1914
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:05,060
you know,
you have to like get and it has to get 

1915
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:07,160
ingrained in you so deeply after so long
a time that it actually becomes your new

1916
01:19:07,161 --> 01:19:09,170
way of thinking and you new behavior.
I mean,

1917
01:19:09,171 --> 01:19:10,610
if you just go back and look at 
yourself.

1918
01:19:10,611 --> 01:19:13,160
I mean,
if I had to be myself at 21,

1919
01:19:13,161 --> 01:19:18,161
I mean,
I couldn't imagine if I had my 21 year 

1920
01:19:18,161 --> 01:19:20,411
old brain today,
I would be fucking insane out of 

1921
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:21,530
nothing.
I would never,

1922
01:19:21,531 --> 01:19:26,531
I would have liked the house on fire 
with fucking to drive my cars over 

1923
01:19:26,531 --> 01:19:26,531
cliffs.
I mean,

1924
01:19:26,531 --> 01:19:26,840
I feel like last night what happened in 
my house,

1925
01:19:26,841 --> 01:19:28,040
I had my 21 year old brand.

1926
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:30,920
You guys hAd some nutty as podcast on.

1927
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:34,280
I'm going to ask you.
I'm afraid to go to my house.

1928
01:19:34,281 --> 01:19:36,530
It's so you never finished what happened
to you?

1929
01:19:36,531 --> 01:19:41,531
Um,

1932
01:19:41,531 --> 01:19:43,090
I was in New Zealand and um,

01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:43,850

01:19:45,951 --> 01:19:48,620
Our arch barker and I are really good 
friends.

1936
01:19:48,621 --> 01:19:50,570

Australia.

1938
01:19:52,491 --> 01:19:54,830
Massive.
He's in Australia.

1939
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:56,160
He's like,

1940
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:57,260

1949
01:20:13,210 --> 01:20:14,640

And he was doing well in America.

1950
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:16,020
He's on flight of the conchords,
you know,

1951
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:17,110
he's got a career here.
Yeah.

1952
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:20,370
It's not that he's doing bad,
but just superstar superstar there.

1953
01:20:20,371 --> 01:20:23,730
And he loves it and it's a great place.
He splits his time there.

1954
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:24,750
No,
he's there now.

1955
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:25,800
Permanently.
Permanently.

1956
01:20:25,801 --> 01:20:26,730
Yeah.
It's so crazy.

1957
01:20:26,731 --> 01:20:31,731
He said fuck it.
He bought this great house up in the 

1958
01:20:31,731 --> 01:20:34,101
middle of like,
it's out there and he's got a farm and 

1959
01:20:34,101 --> 01:20:35,630

You're a huge in Australia too,

1960
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:38,400
but you want to be over here more?
Yeah,

1961
01:20:38,401 --> 01:20:40,230
I'd much rather be here.
Why is that?

1962
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:41,400
Just,
you know,

1963
01:20:41,401 --> 01:20:44,570
I've got family here and stuff and 
getting back the 15 hour flights.

1964
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:46,590
not easy.
It's brutal.

1965
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:51,210
It is brutal to fucking crush you.
The crusher spirit that I fly.

1966
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:53,250
I've got,
you have to throw it in three weeks.

1967
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:54,870
I'm going in.
I'm done too.

1968
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,150
Are you going to be in,
in town?

1969
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,070
Um,
I leave sydney like the day you show up.

1970
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,180
Oh really?
Shit dude.

1971
01:21:00,181 --> 01:21:01,020
I could hook you up.
What's,

1972
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:01,950
what's,
what,

1973
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:02,880
what,
what days?

1974
01:21:02,881 --> 01:21:04,680
You're um,
um,

1975
01:21:04,681 --> 01:21:07,260
I got two shows because the first show 
sold out you at the end.

1976
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:08,270
And morgan?
No,

1977
01:21:08,271 --> 01:21:11,070
no I couldn't get in there.
There was a band because the ufc,

1978
01:21:11,071 --> 01:21:16,071
the what happens is the ufc books their 
stuff kinda like late in comparison to 

1979
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:18,990
like stand up and concerts.
Like if you go to a concert venue,

1980
01:21:18,991 --> 01:21:21,480
most concert venues are booked six 
months to a year out.

1981
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:25,710
So for ufc it's not that far out.
Like we're,

1982
01:21:25,711 --> 01:21:28,740
we don't and we haven't announced yet.
We got some shit announce right now.

1983
01:21:28,741 --> 01:21:33,741
It's in april,
but there's some still some stuff in 

1984
01:21:33,741 --> 01:21:35,631
marx's up in the air and the may stuffs 
up in the air and the june stuff is up 

1985
01:21:35,631 --> 01:21:35,631
in the air.

1986
01:21:35,631 --> 01:21:37,170
Some of them get confirmed and some of 
them are still up in the air.

1987
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:41,520
And the problem is sometimes I don't 
find out until like maybe the latest,

1988
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:44,100
the earliest is three months out,
three months out.

1989
01:21:44,101 --> 01:21:45,390
It's tough to get a gig because they're 
all,

1990
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,460
all the venues are booked friday and 
saturday nights.

1991
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,800
So it's saturday night and met rudy

1992

1994
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:55,890

1995
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:57,700
is a list promoting,
uh,

1996
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,370
the same people that promoted the last 
time.

1997
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:00,830
So those are my guys.
Yeah,

1998
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:01,740
they're great.
Yeah.

1999
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:04,030
Same guys pack that place.
Yeah,

2000
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,670
sort of the first one is already sold 
out in the second one.

2001
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,760
And by the way,
if you want to go to mandalay bay this 

2002
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:10,760
weekend,
it's almost sold out friday night.

2003
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:10,760
Um,
uh,

2004
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:14,130
at the mandalay bay theater and uh,
there's gonna be a,

2005
01:22:14,131 --> 01:22:16,550
it's going to be arusha fear and joe 
dhea,

2006
01:22:16,551 --> 01:22:17,670
so it's going to be fucking crazy.

2007
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:22,670
It's a big giant place,
but I've been pimping the tickets for a 

2008
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:23,400
long time so it's almost sold out.
So,

2009
01:22:23,401 --> 01:22:25,230
um,
this is the place I'm doing it.

2010
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:26,700
SYdney as the rsl club.
You ever,

2011
01:22:26,701 --> 01:22:27,440
were you ever working on?
Yeah,

2012
01:22:27,441 --> 01:22:28,410
I think there's a good.
Yeah,

2013
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:28,830
yeah,
yeah.

2014
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:31,470
You're like,
it's an rsl ourselves,

2015
01:22:31,471 --> 01:22:36,471
like they're retired service league,
which means it's like they're veterans 

2016
01:22:36,471 --> 01:22:36,960
clubs until it's like a vfw.
Your plane.

2017
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:39,510
So how come you didn't tell me to get 
the fuck out of the neighborhood?

2018
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,500
You think you think you're like,
fuck,

2019
01:22:41,501 --> 01:22:43,860
I'm playing a vfw,
be in that place.

2020
01:22:43,861 --> 01:22:46,080
They'll have a big fucking,
it must be pretty big.

2021
01:22:46,081 --> 01:22:47,880
What's it?
The capacity?

2022
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:51,180
I think it's like $800.
So I have like the theater within there,

2023
01:22:51,181 --> 01:22:55,350
like,
but in every little town they have these

2024
01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:00,440
rsls and it's where you go to drink 
cheap before you go out at night and 

2025
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,710
they got poker machines club.
Yeah.

2026
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:06,820
So what,
but why are they tellIng me to get out 

2027
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:06,820
of town?
Because it's probably a.

2028
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:06,820
They sent us a shitty neighborhood.

2029
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:06,970
Yeah.
They're like,

2030
01:23:06,971 --> 01:23:08,050
if you're going to party,
don't party there.

2031
01:23:08,051 --> 01:23:09,670
I get the fuck out of there.
Get back into the city.

2032
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,950
Why is it creepy?
It's just a fucking suburb.

2033
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:13,250
It's like playing like,
you know,

2034
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:15,610
like if you were in clifton,
clifton,

2035
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:20,640
New Jersey and you're not.
and sometimes it's fun being in the 

2036
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,281
suburbs.
So sometimes it's fun being those weird 

2037
01:23:23,281 --> 01:23:23,281
fringe places.
Well they've got,

2038
01:23:23,281 --> 01:23:23,281

2040
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:27,541

So they're like,

2041
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:29,950
I'm crocodile dundee is that they're 
more like,

01:23:45,881 --> 01:23:46,600
fucking,
you know,

2049
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:48,520
guys like to have fun and adventure 
seekers.

2050
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:54,680
A lot of guys in Australia fucking ride 
motorcycles and they drove units which 

2051
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:54,680
are like pickup trucks.

2052
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:58,920
I'll start as a goddamn manly country,
yet extremely goddamn mentally.

2053
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,210
Was that about,
was it the prison colony thing?

2054
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:05,340
I think it has a lot to do with that 
task to fucking beautiful place,

2055
01:24:05,341 --> 01:24:06,240
man.
Australia.

2056
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:07,480
So gorgeous.
And,

2057
01:24:07,481 --> 01:24:09,940
and I Saw like I saw down there and the 
surfers,

2058
01:24:09,941 --> 01:24:14,590
they're just crush americans are really.
Every dude there.

2059
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:18,190
You think he's a pro real,
you'll just go to like some guy like,

2060
01:24:18,191 --> 01:24:19,330
hey,
you do you serve?

2061
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,540
And he'll be like,
hey,

2062
01:24:20,541 --> 01:24:22,300
I did a little and you want to go 
tomorrow?

2063
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:23,800
You'll go to the next day and be like,
dude,

2064
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:27,940
you should be on tour.
Like really fucking all amazing.

2065
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:33,360
Well they love the ufc.
Mma and ufc sells out there in like 15 

2066
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:33,700
minutes time every,
every single time we've been there.

2067
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:36,160
We've been there twice,
but every single time it breaks,

2068
01:24:36,161 --> 01:24:38,080
records sells out quicker than anything.

2069
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:41,170
It's fucking nutty.
And they love george sada apolis there.

2070
01:24:41,171 --> 01:24:43,510
One guy that got a little,
one famous australian guy.

2071
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,810
He's a fucking great dude.
Yeah,

2072
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,010
he's a top contender right now in the 
ufc.

2073
01:24:48,011 --> 01:24:53,011
Two nicest fucking guy in the world,
but he's a perfect ozzy just so fucking 

2074
01:24:53,011 --> 01:24:53,020
savage.
They have a,

2075
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:56,050
they have a real fucking like they call 
theM blokes,

2076
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:59,740
like a guy's a bloke and they're very 
blokey and women complain about it.

2077
01:24:59,741 --> 01:25:01,600
Like in sydney,
I always say that like,

2078
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:06,840
you can't even talk to a woman in a bar 
because the guys have fucked them over 

2079
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:06,840
so badly.
You go up to go and be like,

2080
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:07,150
hi.
She was like,

2081
01:25:07,151 --> 01:25:09,020
go fuck yourself can't.
And You're like,

2082
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:10,510
whoa,
what did I do?

2083
01:25:10,511 --> 01:25:15,511
And it's not like you did.
It's what the last 20 guys that dealt 

2084
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:18,241
with her did.
So the girls are on the defensive and 

2085
01:25:18,241 --> 01:25:18,241
uh,
because the guy is just,

2086
01:25:18,241 --> 01:25:20,590
it's all about your boys,
but don't they have a different attitude

2087
01:25:20,591 --> 01:25:21,860
towards sex and Australia?

2088
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,860
The much more permissive?
Much more.

2089
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:26,380
I would say there are a lot of much 
musculus everywhere.

2090
01:25:26,381 --> 01:25:28,420
But America,
that's one thing you don't realize about

2091
01:25:28,421 --> 01:25:29,140
America.
How,

2092
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:32,500
I mean obviously the middle east is 
worse unless you're a little boy,

2093
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:33,790
but in the,
in the middle east,

2094
01:25:33,791 --> 01:25:35,140
they love to fuck little boys.
That's,

2095
01:25:35,141 --> 01:25:40,141
that's an awesome time for them,
but as far as like like european 

2096
01:25:40,141 --> 01:25:44,041
countries,
we are so fucked up in comparison to 

2097
01:25:44,041 --> 01:25:45,100
them like our,
our whole repression,

2098
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,900
all that shit that doesn't exist over 
there.

2099
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:49,090
They're like in Argentina and south 
America,

2100
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,730
the commercials,
there's super life hurt.

2101
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:53,230
I've heard,
I don't know how true this is.

2102
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:57,460
I read or it was in a.
It was a statistic in jesus camp.

2103
01:25:57,490 --> 01:26:02,490
Did you see that film?
They said two thirds of americans born 

2104
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,251
again.
Christians know that's what it said in 

2105
01:26:05,251 --> 01:26:05,251
the beginning of that film.
I don't think that's correct.

2106
01:26:05,251 --> 01:26:10,030
I think probably two thirds of the 
people that they talked to or 

2107
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:10,030
evangelical,
you know,

2108
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:13,520
finding the numbers of for $300,
million people.

2109
01:26:13,521 --> 01:26:15,860
that's so problematic.
Not only that,

2110
01:26:15,861 --> 01:26:17,570
you've got to add in mexicans,
you know,

2111
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,480
because there's a lot of undocumented 
people in this country and who knows how

2112
01:26:20,481 --> 01:26:21,230
many it is.
I mean,

2113
01:26:21,231 --> 01:26:24,020
I've heard millions and millions in 
California alone,

2114
01:26:24,021 --> 01:26:29,021
so who knows how many it is nationwide,
so knowing how many people are actually 

2115
01:26:29,021 --> 01:26:33,551
christians and evangelical evangelical 
christians or people who believe the 

2116
01:26:33,551 --> 01:26:34,250
earth is less than 10,000
years old.

2117
01:26:34,251 --> 01:26:37,240
You know the numbers are.
Who the fuck knows what they are?

2118
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:39,950
I've heard 51 percent believed the earth
is less than 10,000

2119
01:26:39,951 --> 01:26:44,951
years old.
Fifty one percent believe in a biblical 

2120
01:26:44,951 --> 01:26:44,951
version of the bible that's fucked up 
there.

2121
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,450
But which by the way,
play that fucking clip.

2122
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:48,890
Yeah.
god,

2123
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:49,910
we have to play this clip.

2124
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:51,050
Bill O'reilly,
man.

2125
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:52,310
Now,
by the way,

2126
01:26:52,311 --> 01:26:56,390
bill o'reilly went to fucking harvard.
I also think he's a troll.

2127
01:26:56,391 --> 01:26:58,660
I think he's playing a character.
I think you might be wrong.

2128
01:26:58,710 --> 01:26:59,950
Almost pause.
Thank.

2129
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:00,560
He's,
uh,

2130
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:05,590
he's very clever as to lIke the kind of 
shit that he supports in the way 

2131
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:10,211
supports.
It is so asinine that it's almost like 

2132
01:27:10,211 --> 01:27:10,410
he's trolling.
It's almost like subtle parody.

2133
01:27:10,411 --> 01:27:15,411
Yeah.
Here's why I think that I used to do 

2134
01:27:15,411 --> 01:27:15,411
sports radio in New York city.
I was on w new,

2135
01:27:15,411 --> 01:27:16,650
which is the station,
opie and anthony.

2136
01:27:16,651 --> 01:27:21,651
Ron And all that,
I was the morning show with this guy 

2137
01:27:21,651 --> 01:27:21,651
named sid rosenberg's sids.
Sure.

2138
01:27:21,651 --> 01:27:21,651
I know.
Said rosenberg.

2139
01:27:21,651 --> 01:27:23,690
I do a show in miami all the time.
Sports expert.

2140
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:28,860
I knew fucking nothing.
It waS supposed to be like love lines 

2141
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:31,600
where he was the expert and I was the 
comedian and sid wanted me to be an 

2142
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,320
expert in sports and I don't give a shit
about,

2143
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:35,150
you know,
what fucking guy stats.

2144
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:37,040
So did he ask you to like learn the 
stats?

2145
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:42,300
No,
but there was constant conflict between 

2146
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:42,300
the two of us because you worked there 
for six months and I was like,

2147
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,460
I'm getting the fuck out of here.
So he was telling you,

2148
01:27:43,461 --> 01:27:44,640
hey,
read the sports book,

2149
01:27:44,641 --> 01:27:45,830
read it.
You'd be like,

2150
01:27:45,831 --> 01:27:47,000
did you watch the game last night?
And like,

2151
01:27:47,001 --> 01:27:47,960
no.
And he's like,

2152
01:27:47,961 --> 01:27:48,560
why not?
I'm like,

2153
01:27:48,561 --> 01:27:51,380
I didn't fucking want to fucking be 
funny.

2154
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,390
I'll be funny.
And he's like,

2155
01:27:53,391 --> 01:27:54,770
but you got to be funny about sports.
I'm like,

2156
01:27:54,771 --> 01:27:55,430
no,
I don't.

2157
01:27:55,431 --> 01:27:57,410
I just have to be funnY.
So man,

2158
01:27:57,411 --> 01:27:59,330
that always bugs me when I listen to 
sports radio.

2159
01:27:59,331 --> 01:28:04,331
And they were like,
and how bout mchenry with the play in 

2160
01:28:04,331 --> 01:28:07,811
the night?
Does he think that dad's gonna get his 

2161
01:28:07,811 --> 01:28:10,061
contract extension but don't bump.
But it made me fucking like crazy 

2162
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:15,340
because I realized the only way you're 
going to get ratings and be interesting 

2163
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:18,640
is I had to basically take on a 
character and I would sit there and 

2164
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:22,750
criticize these athletes and these 
coaches that I didn't even watch the 

2165
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:24,140
fuck below to that.

2166
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:25,910
By the way,
I wouldn't even watch the game.

2167
01:28:25,911 --> 01:28:26,930
And I'd be like,
jim fossil,

2168
01:28:26,931 --> 01:28:29,210
he's a fucking pussy.
Did you see what he did?

2169
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,890
Just say fuck,
I wouldn't say that,

2170
01:28:30,891 --> 01:28:32,720
but I'd be like,
can you put.

2171
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:33,790
I said pussy.
I'd go,

2172
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:35,240
he's a pussy,
he's a pussy.

2173
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:37,160
And the next thing you know,
you know,

2174
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:39,800
all his fans are called,
I'm going to kick your roads,

2175
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:41,420
man.
How could you say that?

2176
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:44,510
How could it.
And I would just try to incite people to

2177
01:28:44,511 --> 01:28:49,511
create radio.
And I watch fucking bill o'reilly and 

2178
01:28:49,511 --> 01:28:50,870
I'm like,
he's doing the same shit.

2179
01:28:50,871 --> 01:28:53,280
There's no possible way he might be.
He,

2180
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:58,430
you know,
I definitely think he's playing towards 

2181
01:28:58,430 --> 01:28:58,430
his market.
He has a market and he's concocted this,

2182
01:28:58,430 --> 01:29:01,830
this gigantic conglomeration of retards 
and old people

2183
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:07,010
that think that he makes sense,
but this is one of the most troll like 

2184
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:07,780
things that he's ever said.
BrIan,

2185
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:14,090
check this out.
It's talking about the moon is on bill 

2186
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:17,991
o'reilly dot com.
Could find on youtube backstage 

2187
01:29:17,991 --> 01:29:19,020
conversation backstage with bill 
o'reilly,

2188
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:20,050
david,
beverly hills,

2189
01:29:20,051 --> 01:29:25,051
Florida,
or what do you mean when you refer to 

2190
01:29:25,051 --> 01:29:26,971
the ties?
When you asked about the existence of 

2191
01:29:26,971 --> 01:29:26,971
god?
Science explains the tides.

2192
01:29:26,971 --> 01:29:27,430
The moon's gravity pulls on the ocean.
Okay,

2193
01:29:27,431 --> 01:29:30,910
I had pneumonia then.
How'd you get there?

2194
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:33,790
look,
you pinheads who attacked me for this?

2195
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:36,850
You guys are just desperate.
Had sImone get there.

2196
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:39,190
I just wanted to get there.
I get there.

2197
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:44,790
Can you explain that to me?
How come we have that and maurice 

2198
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:45,210
doesn't happen.
Venus doesn't happen.

2199
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:49,690
How come mars has two moons by now?
How'd I get here?

2200
01:29:51,190 --> 01:29:53,440
How did that little amoeba get here?
Cool out there.

2201
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:55,300
How to do it?
Come on.

2202
01:29:56,770 --> 01:29:59,350
You have order in this universe.
You have an order in the universe.

2203
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:00,610
Tide comes in,
tide goes out.

2204
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:01,240
Okay.
Yeah,

2205
01:30:01,241 --> 01:30:03,190
the moon does it fine,
and the moon get there.

2206
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,670
Who put it there?
It just happened.

2207
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,130
Okay.
If we have existence,

2208
01:30:09,131 --> 01:30:11,830
if we have life on earth,
how come they don't have it on the other

2209
01:30:11,831 --> 01:30:16,000
plants?
We just lucky some media and do this.

2210
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:18,160
Come on.
you know,

2211
01:30:18,161 --> 01:30:22,050
I see this stuff.
It's desperate times.

2212
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:27,390
It takes more faith to not believe and 
just think that this was all luck.

2213
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:33,600
EverY oldest human body,
the intricacies of it and everything 

2214
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:33,600
else,
all luck.

2215
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:36,590
Then It does it to believe in a deity.

2216
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:38,900
Is there a positive I want you to do 
right now?

2217
01:30:38,901 --> 01:30:39,890
Two things I want you to do.
One,

2218
01:30:39,891 --> 01:30:43,220
I want you to go look up a bill 
o'reilly,

2219
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:48,350
a scandalous voicemails because he left 
a bunch of voicemails on his assistance.

2220
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:54,700
His assistant's fallen about a rubbing 
her down with a loofa sponge and fucking

2221
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:58,910
all kinds of creepy shit.
He wound up payIng her off,

2222
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:01,830
don't you?
Don't you think that bill o'reilly's the

2223
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:05,090
kind of guy that really needs to get 
really high?

2224
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,820
Yeah,
and then he might go,

2225
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:13,090
holy shit back.
I take back almost everything I've ever 

2226
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:13,610
said.
She,

2227
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,650
yeah,
for sure he would because he would allow

2228
01:31:15,651 --> 01:31:20,651
hIm a different perception that he 
probably has never entered into if he 

2229
01:31:20,651 --> 01:31:21,050
does believe that shit,
but it's,

2230
01:31:21,051 --> 01:31:26,051
I don't know if he does or doesn't.
I think he does and this is why I think 

2231
01:31:26,051 --> 01:31:26,051
he does.

2232
01:31:26,051 --> 01:31:28,220
I think he does because he's got a 
tremendous ego and I think,

2233
01:31:28,221 --> 01:31:30,440
you know,
he's one of those guys that he's,

2234
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:35,470
he's saying something all the time.
I don't think you would say something 

2235
01:31:35,470 --> 01:31:36,230
all the time unless he believed it,
you know,

2236
01:31:36,231 --> 01:31:37,070
this,
this whole thing.

2237
01:31:37,071 --> 01:31:38,270
I think,
you know,

2238
01:31:38,271 --> 01:31:41,120
I think he's definitely preaching to the
choir and I definitely think he's,

2239
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,770
you know,
trying to fit a,

2240
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,040
fit a mold and,
and trying to appease his constituents,

2241
01:31:46,041 --> 01:31:48,800
all the people that listen to his show.
But I think there's,

2242
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:53,920
it can't be contrary to what he really 
believes because he's got too big of an 

2243
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,310
ego for him to be on tv talking about it
all the time.

2244
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:57,650
Eventually he'd implode.
He wouldn't be able to deal with that.

2245
01:31:57,651 --> 01:32:00,100
If you really did have a,
an intelligent

2246
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,900
argument that was contrary to what we've
saying,

2247
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:03,580
I don't think you would be saying it on 
the air.

2248
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:06,310
I just think his ego's too big.
I don't think he's that genius.

2249
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:11,400
He's not.
He's not andy kaufman and he's not some 

2250
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:11,400
brilliant trickster that's fucking 
fooling the world.

2251
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:16,500
I think these guYs,
they start playing a character and then 

2252
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:17,800
they sort of like dice clay it.
They become the character.

2253
01:32:17,801 --> 01:32:19,930
Yeah.
Whatever one dice clay onto the dice.

2254
01:32:19,931 --> 01:32:21,670
Clay used to be andrew silverstein,
by the way.

2255
01:32:21,671 --> 01:32:23,410
We're goIng to try to get dice on the 
podcast too.

2256
01:32:23,530 --> 01:32:26,560
I'm not hating.
I love dies down a great talk with dice.

2257
01:32:26,561 --> 01:32:27,240
Ella.
Date diocese.

2258
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:30,850
Kid is doing comedy.
Dices kid is 20 and diocese so proud and

2259
01:32:30,851 --> 01:32:32,980
his kid is fucking killing.
It's kids like learning.

2260
01:32:32,981 --> 01:32:34,150
Yeah,
and it's fucking great.

2261
01:32:34,151 --> 01:32:35,320
what's his name?
What's he go by?

2262
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:38,290
What's his name was max.

2263
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,060
Max.
Max clay.

2264
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:42,280
No,
I don't think goodby silverstein.

2265
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:47,940
Anyway,
he'd seen his name around dice used to 

2266
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:48,070
be a andrew silverstein and then he 
would.

2267
01:32:48,071 --> 01:32:53,071
The dice man was like this character 
that he would do on stage along with a 

2268
01:32:53,071 --> 01:32:56,731
bunch of other characters.
He would do like stallone and he would 

2269
01:32:56,731 --> 01:32:56,731
do deniro.
He would do like all these characters,

2270
01:32:56,731 --> 01:32:59,260
like all these impressions and the dice 
man was one of his characters.

2271
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:04,410
Well,
the dIce man just became his main 

2272
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:07,051
character that became his thing.
He done on stage and then it became him 

2273
01:33:07,051 --> 01:33:07,051
offstage.
You know,

2274
01:33:07,051 --> 01:33:07,990
and I think that happens to guys like 
Glenn Beck.

2275
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:13,260
I think what happens is they start out 
with this character and they start out 

2276
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:13,510
and then they get all these people.
Thank you,

2277
01:33:13,511 --> 01:33:14,100
Mr.
Beck.

2278
01:33:14,101 --> 01:33:19,101
You make me so happy.
And what you said about jesus is so 

2279
01:33:19,101 --> 01:33:20,350
important to me and my family and what 
you say about our troops so important to

2280
01:33:20,351 --> 01:33:24,340
me and our family and he,
this guy's soaking in this love and he's

2281
01:33:24,341 --> 01:33:25,930
putting out a book every three days.

2282
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:30,930
This motherfucker and all of them are 
about what's wrong with the left and 

2283
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:34,321
what's wrong with society and what's 
wrong with being godless and what's 

2284
01:33:34,321 --> 01:33:37,201
wrong with this.
And sarah palin's the only hope for our 

2285
01:33:37,201 --> 01:33:39,541
country,
and then they start fucking believe in 

2286
01:33:39,541 --> 01:33:39,541
it,
man,

2287
01:33:39,541 --> 01:33:42,031
because the human ego,
when you're the type of person that's 

2288
01:33:42,031 --> 01:33:43,150
really selling something and pitching 
something and getting all this adulation

2289
01:33:43,151 --> 01:33:44,710
for it,
if you're an egomaniac,

2290
01:33:44,711 --> 01:33:46,840
which most people get into the public 
eye are,

2291
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:51,990
you know,
most people that get into a position 

2292
01:33:51,990 --> 01:33:51,990
where like a guy like that where they 
have a,

2293
01:33:51,990 --> 01:33:56,540
an opinion show where they're onstage 
every day talking to people and 

2294
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:58,030
broadcasting to millions.
They get all this love and fan mail.

2295
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:00,550
It's very difficult to be objective 
about that.

2296
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:02,000
You know,
it's very difficult to like,

2297
01:34:02,001 --> 01:34:04,180
you know,
have a real honest way of looking at the

2298
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:06,550
way you start looking at it the way they
want you to look out.

2299
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:07,990
Because this is where the love's coming 
from.

2300
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:13,190
You know,
and then you start back turned into a 

2301
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:13,190
fucking mormon.
Okay?

2302
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:13,570
As an adult,
as an adult,

2303
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:15,730
who by the way is obviously,
look,

2304
01:34:15,731 --> 01:34:18,400
you can say he's crazy and I do,
but that has got a high iq.

2305
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:20,290
There's no question in my mind.
I guarantee you,

2306
01:34:20,291 --> 01:34:23,400
if you sat that guy down,
he's won 20 Plus iq,

2307
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:24,880
you know,
he's a smart guy.

2308
01:34:24,881 --> 01:34:27,580
There's no way you could do that.
Free ball mormonIsm,

2309
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:29,240
he's fucked up.
No,

2310
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:30,090
he's not.
Look,

2311
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:35,140
the,
the intelligence and balance are two 

2312
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:36,490
totally different things.
I've met some brilliant people.

2313
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:38,740
I'm one of the,
I don't want to say his name,

2314
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:41,950
a guy who used to design my website so 
fucking brilliant,

2315
01:34:41,951 --> 01:34:45,010
but completely insane and totally 
imbalanced.

2316
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:47,620
I know a bunch of people like that,
that are really,

2317
01:34:47,621 --> 01:34:51,490
really brilliant people,
but I mean mathematically brilliant,

2318
01:34:51,491 --> 01:34:52,990
you know,
structurally brilliant,

2319
01:34:52,991 --> 01:34:53,380
brilliant.

2320
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:55,850
The way they can break down a complex,
uh,

2321
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,930
orders in all,
in their own life is just chaos.

2322
01:34:59,931 --> 01:35:02,630
And you're saying becky is brilliant.
Yes.

2323
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:04,070
I think he's absolutely brilliant.
Brilliant.

2324
01:35:04,071 --> 01:35:09,071
And being a cunt,
he's what he's doing is I think he's a 

2325
01:35:09,071 --> 01:35:09,071
brilliant manipulation.
Yeah,

2326
01:35:09,071 --> 01:35:11,270
brilliant manipulation,
brilliant at acting,

2327
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:16,480
brilliant at playing apart,
brilliant at becoming the perfect 

2328
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:16,940
version of this guide thAt all these 
retards need.

2329
01:35:16,941 --> 01:35:21,941
Because I don't,
I don't think it takes intelligence to 

2330
01:35:21,941 --> 01:35:21,941
be a manipulator.
What he's doing takes intelligence.

2331
01:35:21,941 --> 01:35:26,801
He's free balling every day.
He's got like a big screen and is 

2332
01:35:26,801 --> 01:35:28,370
breaking things down and some of it 
makes sense.

2333
01:35:28,371 --> 01:35:30,020
It's like 20 or 30 percent of it.
I go,

2334
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:31,920
god dammit.
I agree with glen beck.

2335
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:35,570
This is ridiculous.
But I think that those guys,

2336
01:35:35,571 --> 01:35:40,571
when they get to that position where the
extraordinary amount of success that 

2337
01:35:40,571 --> 01:35:44,550
they achieve in one certain area meet 
glenn beck's houses for sale in 

2338
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:44,780
Connecticut and I looked at that shit 
online.

2339
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:49,980
There's a fucking giant and it's 
probably only for sale because he got a 

2340
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:49,980
bigger one.
You know,

2341
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:50,600
you've got a bigger crazier when that 
guy selling.

2342
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:55,750
Literally every time I go to the 
bookstore there's a new Glenn Beck book 

2343
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,971
and nobody makes me feel lazier than 
glenn bUck because I've been writing 

2344
01:35:57,971 --> 01:36:00,440
this god damn book for a year and I 
can't ha Glenn Beck putS out one every 

2345
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:01,010
15 days.
It's fucking insane,

2346
01:36:01,011 --> 01:36:02,660
you know.
But these guys,

2347
01:36:02,661 --> 01:36:07,661
I really truly believe as a person who's
been affected by fame and had been 

2348
01:36:08,121 --> 01:36:13,121
affected like my war.
If I had to look at my own behavior and 

2349
01:36:13,121 --> 01:36:16,660
analyze it and then you know,
that's one of the reasons why I really 

2350
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:18,851
got into psychedelics and the,
the isolation tank is because I felt 

2351
01:36:18,851 --> 01:36:22,511
like there was an overwhelming influence
that that fame and the pursuit of fame 

2352
01:36:22,511 --> 01:36:24,050
has on a person,
especially in hollywood where you're,

2353
01:36:24,051 --> 01:36:29,051
you're trying to make things happen 
where you can lose yourself in this 

2354
01:36:29,051 --> 01:36:29,570
quest and I take it happens to a lot of 
people.

2355
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:32,730
So I wanted to kind of analyze it in 
myself and,

2356
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:37,010
and it took a long time for me to get 
ahold of it from like fear factor on.

2357
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:39,470
There was like a long time in there 
where I was like,

2358
01:36:39,471 --> 01:36:44,471
this is a crazy thing here.
Like how do you make sure that what 

2359
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:44,471
you're doing is really what you want to 
be doing?

2360
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:44,660
How do you,
how do you,

2361
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:49,870
how do you know that you know what 
you're doing is not what you think 

2362
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:51,260
people would like to hear from you or 
what you think is gonna you're gonna say

2363
01:36:51,261 --> 01:36:54,050
and do to get more work and to get more 
people to like you.

2364
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:59,310
I mean,
I've had conversatIons with really 

2365
01:36:59,310 --> 01:36:59,310
successful people.
They say,

2366
01:36:59,310 --> 01:37:02,650
you know,
I can't do that because I'm this and 

2367
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:02,650
that and my image is that and this and 
like,

2368
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:02,650
okay,
you're,

2369
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:07,121
you're not even doing you,
you're pretending to be something else 

2370
01:37:07,121 --> 01:37:08,690
just so that you can get more of the 
positive reaction that you've gotten.

2371
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,910
That permeates into your real life,

2372
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,520
but what if,
what if that's like,

2373
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:15,090
like I'm the kind of person I vacillate.
Often I'll,

2374
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:20,130
I'll look at one thing and then all have
a different opinion maybe a year later 

2375
01:37:20,130 --> 01:37:22,720
on how I felt about it and been in the 
seat and as a,

2376
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:24,340
as a performer,
as a comedian,

2377
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:27,880
my ax constantly changing.
Sometimes I can't do bits that I used to

2378
01:37:27,881 --> 01:37:32,881
do because I've changed as a person.
I don't feel that way and I can't 

2379
01:37:32,881 --> 01:37:36,001
deliver them with truth and I'm like,
that would suck to fucking be locked 

2380
01:37:36,001 --> 01:37:40,320
into accounts.
We're off air Says we're off the air use

2381
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:42,580
drink keeps on fucking up,
but it's on here.

2382
01:37:42,581 --> 01:37:45,850
It says we're on here,
so it's going off and on and it's choppy

2383
01:37:45,851 --> 01:37:47,830
for people,
but I can't get on right now.

2384
01:37:48,490 --> 01:37:49,690
It's on you see it.
Yeah,

2385
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:52,120
it's on.
You see online.

2386
01:37:52,170 --> 01:37:53,950
Where do you see online?
We have 13,

2387
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:56,010
17 viewers.
It's broadcasting.

2388
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,610
It's recording.
See if you can see it on a.

2389
01:37:57,611 --> 01:37:58,940
On a browser.
All right.

2390
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:01,330
Anyways,
who cares?

2391
01:38:01,331 --> 01:38:03,090
We're talking about use you,
you know.

2392
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:03,870
Well,
I'm just my.

2393
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:06,240
I accidentally unclicked it and I can't 
get back to.

2394
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:07,770
Sorry,
go ahead.

2395
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:12,960
So people lIke that,
the ability to like change while you're 

2396
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,630
and to get locked into that character 
would be terrifying for me.

2397
01:38:16,631 --> 01:38:20,080
I'm a control freak and if that's where 
your income and I don't have the,

2398
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:25,680
you know,
I'm lucky enough that I don't have like 

2399
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,101
a life and kids.
But imagine if you got into that where 

2400
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:27,880
then you've got a house and mortgages 
and schools and you've,

2401
01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:32,970
you've bought into this character and 
all of a sudden you've changed as a 

2402
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:32,970
character and you're like,
fuck,

2403
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:33,850
I'm not that guy anymore.
I don't feel that way.

2404
01:38:33,851 --> 01:38:35,530
I've changed my way of thinking,
but fuck,

2405
01:38:35,531 --> 01:38:37,990
I gotta I gotta still do that because 
people do change.

2406
01:38:37,991 --> 01:38:41,290
People either become more conservatIve 
as they get older or you know,

2407
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:43,090
start to realize shit,
you know,

2408
01:38:43,091 --> 01:38:45,510
I've become more liberal as I get older.
Yeah,

2409
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:46,570
yeah.
Well,

2410
01:38:46,571 --> 01:38:48,940
I think as you become more intelligent,
you know,

2411
01:38:48,941 --> 01:38:53,070
you realize that there's a lot more.
There's a lot more to things than people

2412
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:53,900
think.
Now.

2413
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,150
Everybody likes to think it's black and 
white.

2414
01:38:55,151 --> 01:38:58,600
I have a lot of conservative now,
a lot of them about gun control,

2415
01:38:58,601 --> 01:38:59,140
about,
uh,

2416
01:38:59,150 --> 01:39:01,030
about taxes,
about a lot of different things.

2417
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,520
But I also have a lot of liberal points 
of view to,

2418
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:08,580
you know,
especially when it comes to things like 

2419
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:08,580
gay marriage and,
you know,

2420
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:10,180
and that to me is one of the most 
frustrating things when I see people get

2421
01:39:10,181 --> 01:39:11,670
upset about gay marriage,
you know,

2422
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:13,990
as if it's somehow another fucking 
effects.

2423
01:39:13,991 --> 01:39:16,870
You have two guys who obviously want to 
be gay.

2424
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:19,000
No one's got a gun to their head.
No one's saying,

2425
01:39:19,001 --> 01:39:20,800
if you're not gay,
I'm fucking killing your family.

2426
01:39:20,801 --> 01:39:21,790
You know?
No one's doing that.

2427
01:39:21,791 --> 01:39:22,160
They're just,

2428
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,800
I find the people that are afraid of 
life,

2429
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:26,050
bro.
This shit is offline,

2430
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:27,640
man.
It's on everyday.

2431
01:39:27,641 --> 01:39:28,700
I can take it on.
You know,

2432
01:39:28,701 --> 01:39:29,100
I,
it's,

2433
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:31,800
it's having pro ustream.
Ustream has some problems,

2434
01:39:31,801 --> 01:39:36,801
man,
when there's like you're trying to get 

2435
01:39:36,801 --> 01:39:36,801
on it,
you have to refresh it a few times,

2436
01:39:36,801 --> 01:39:36,801
whatever.
It's on those,

2437
01:39:36,801 --> 01:39:37,050
so don't worry about it.
That's crazy.

2438
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:38,610
I,
I walked out of the.

2439
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:43,460
Actually it was when I worked with you 
down in tampa or I was doing the,

2440
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:47,220
the early and then you did like friday 
night and you came in tampa improv.

2441
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:51,840
I came out like my first night,
it was like a wednesday or something and

2442
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:56,860
they're these guys out in the street 
holding up signs and it was like almost 

2443
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:57,900
like that church from Nebraska or 
wherever.

2444
01:39:57,901 --> 01:40:00,900
Those crazy fuckers that protest 
funerals is that.

2445
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:05,400
And they were holding up signs,
god hates fags and blah blah blah.

2446
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,280
And I just walked out.
So the audiences out there with me and I

2447
01:40:08,281 --> 01:40:09,930
thought I'm just going to fuck with 
these people.

2448
01:40:09,931 --> 01:40:11,790
And I went up to this kid and I'm like,
how old are you?

2449
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:13,530
And he's like,
I'm 16 years old.

2450
01:40:13,531 --> 01:40:16,680
I'm like,
you're 16 and you're to go to an arcade.

2451
01:40:16,681 --> 01:40:21,681
Go try to get laid.
Go fucking have a life the fuck's wrong 

2452
01:40:21,681 --> 01:40:21,681
with you.
Don't listen to your parents.

2453
01:40:21,681 --> 01:40:23,340
They're assholes.
And I'm making everybody laugh.

2454
01:40:23,341 --> 01:40:25,410
Just making fun of this kid.
But then I started,

2455
01:40:25,411 --> 01:40:27,360
some older guy starts yelling at me and 
I go,

2456
01:40:27,361 --> 01:40:29,010
dude,
stop.

2457
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:34,040
You want to caulk in your ass so badly.
Was the old guy your here right now 

2458
01:40:35,311 --> 01:40:37,240
because you hate yourself.
I'm like,

2459
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:40,050
you want to make it easy?
Just go suck a cock.

2460
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,600
It's going to change your whole life.
You're out here,

2461
01:40:42,601 --> 01:40:47,601
you're doing this shit because you're a 
homo and you just don't want to admit 

2462
01:40:47,601 --> 01:40:47,601
it.
And I'm like,

2463
01:40:47,601 --> 01:40:49,140
leave them the fuck alone.
And go join them.

2464
01:40:49,141 --> 01:40:51,690
That's your deep down.
You know you're gay.

2465
01:40:51,870 --> 01:40:53,500
And he's like,
you're the devil.

2466
01:40:53,501 --> 01:40:54,220
You're the devil.

2467
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:55,210
You're here to.
And I'm like,

2468
01:40:55,211 --> 01:40:56,230
no,
I'm here to help you.

2469
01:40:56,231 --> 01:40:58,330
Dude.
Go fucking suck a cock.

2470
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:01,060
It's going to change your life.
I'm not joking.

2471
01:41:01,061 --> 01:41:06,061
The next night I walk out,
it's the atheists holding up signs 

2472
01:41:06,061 --> 01:41:06,080
going.
You know,

2473
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:09,580
there is no god and god is bad and god 
created,

2474
01:41:09,581 --> 01:41:14,581
you know,
there's death and bob and I go up to 

2475
01:41:14,581 --> 01:41:14,581
them and I go,
you're just fucking bad.

2476
01:41:14,581 --> 01:41:18,220
Just fucking shut up and go fucking have
a beer somewhere.

2477
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:20,720
You're.
Why are you out of here with a.

2478
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:23,230
You've got your own religion of atheism.
Like,

2479
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:25,240
I get it.
I get your belief.

2480
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:30,270
You know,
I don't believe in any kind of fucking 

2481
01:41:30,270 --> 01:41:30,270
order,
anything.

2482
01:41:30,270 --> 01:41:32,470
I don't know what I believe,
but go away.

2483
01:41:32,890 --> 01:41:36,880
Fucking stop your religion of people 
want to believe anything.

2484
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:38,950
Whether it's they want to believe in 
republicans.

2485
01:41:38,951 --> 01:41:39,970
They want to believe in god.

2486
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:41,290
They want to believe in.
No god.

2487
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:44,260
I've had arguments with acs where it's 
so ridiculous.

2488
01:41:44,261 --> 01:41:44,890
You know,
like they're,

2489
01:41:44,891 --> 01:41:48,190
they're saying scientists.
Science disproves the existence of god.

2490
01:41:48,191 --> 01:41:48,940
Like,
no,

2491
01:41:48,941 --> 01:41:50,920
it doesn't scientists and disprove 
anything.

2492
01:41:50,921 --> 01:41:53,650
What what science does is it shows it's.
Well,

2493
01:41:53,651 --> 01:41:58,651
first of all,
it's statistics and things that can be 

2494
01:41:58,651 --> 01:41:58,651
measured.
You know,

2495
01:41:58,651 --> 01:41:58,651
how can you measure what happens in the 
afterlife?

2496
01:41:58,651 --> 01:42:03,481
That's nonsense.
How can you measure what happened with 

2497
01:42:03,481 --> 01:42:03,481
the birth of the universe is and how do 
you mean?

2498
01:42:03,481 --> 01:42:05,950
How do we not know that there's 
something that's far more comp?

2499
01:42:05,951 --> 01:42:07,540
I mean,
I'm not saying that there's a guy in the

2500
01:42:07,541 --> 01:42:10,270
clouds with a harp,
but what I am saying is it after smoking

2501
01:42:10,271 --> 01:42:15,271
dmt seven times and doing mushrooms,
all the times I've done and all the 

2502
01:42:15,271 --> 01:42:19,051
times in the isolation tank,
I've seen shit way crazier than a dude 

2503
01:42:19,051 --> 01:42:19,660
with a harp and the clouds.

2504
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:21,160
Okay.
And I've seen it many,

2505
01:42:21,161 --> 01:42:22,060
many,
many times.

2506
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:27,100
I,
I think that the idea that you can tell 

2507
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:28,180
me what does and doesn't exist is 
fucking ridiculous.

2508
01:42:28,181 --> 01:42:30,610
I cannot believe people actually try to 
do that.

2509
01:42:30,611 --> 01:42:35,611
And I'm like,
how do we know that we're here right 

2510
01:42:35,611 --> 01:42:35,611
now?
Or that were,

2511
01:42:35,611 --> 01:42:37,720
you know,
there could be something so complex.

2512
01:42:37,870 --> 01:42:39,790
I always tell people when they go,
what's your belief on god?

2513
01:42:39,791 --> 01:42:42,910
I go,
when my dog looks at my computer,

2514
01:42:42,911 --> 01:42:47,911
my mac book,
she can't comprehend the operating 

2515
01:42:47,911 --> 01:42:47,911
system she has.
No.

2516
01:42:47,911 --> 01:42:50,920
She does not have the capability.
And I believe that as humans,

2517
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:55,150
that's how we are with the universe.
We don't have the fucking capability,

2518
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:57,220
we might be the most intelligent 
species,

2519
01:42:57,370 --> 01:43:01,600
but we're not intelligent enough to 
understand something that's doesn't mean

2520
01:43:01,601 --> 01:43:03,880
anything.
It's like being the baddest worm.

2521
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:07,480
This worm is so smart.
He knows how to get around this pebble,

2522
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:08,500
you know,
it's really,

2523
01:43:08,510 --> 01:43:09,460
it's ridiculous.

2524
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:10,630
The idea that we can figure it out.
I mean,

2525
01:43:10,631 --> 01:43:15,631
this is complete and total stoner talk,
but the idea that we can figure out the 

2526
01:43:15,631 --> 01:43:16,030
fucking universe,
you know.

2527
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:19,020
Did you find the bill o'reilly?
I'm the stuff now.

2528
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:20,560
It's not on there.
What's not a video,

2529
01:43:20,561 --> 01:43:21,550
bro?
So on a video,

2530
01:43:21,551 --> 01:43:22,870
it's an audio.
Well,

2531
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:26,710
I think they just transcribed it.
I saw it on a Washington post and stuff,

2532
01:43:26,711 --> 01:43:29,860
but it just kind of talked about it.
Did they have the transcriptions though?

2533
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:31,860
Hey,
I want to change the subject for said,

2534
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:34,660
did you Bobby Leon here yesterday did to
get naked for you.

2535
01:43:35,670 --> 01:43:40,670
Fuck it.
It got on our podcasts and we could not 

2536
01:43:40,670 --> 01:43:43,501
get him to keep his clothes on.
He was just fucking rubbing his dick on 

2537
01:43:43,501 --> 01:43:46,390
everything and wow.
So fucking much more sedate and what you

2538
01:43:46,391 --> 01:43:48,520
guys fed them over there?
Uh,

2539
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:49,850
I think he was,
you know,

2540
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:52,130
I can,
have you ever told your story

2541
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:55,720
that you did at the storyteller a 
anywhere else other than that show?

2542
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:58,020
That was the first time I ever told him 
you should talk with,

2543
01:43:58,530 --> 01:43:59,360
uh,
the whole,

2544
01:43:59,390 --> 01:44:01,790
uh,
the whole time we use that urban,

2545
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:04,460
all of the black show.
You want to tell that story?

2546
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:05,390
I'm not afraid.
I mean,

2547
01:44:05,391 --> 01:44:08,240
it's not,
it's not racist on my part with apps not

2548
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:09,770
just took a chance.
Yeah.

2549
01:44:09,790 --> 01:44:11,300
I,
I went to a suny,

2550
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:14,930
it was called suny farmingdale.
It was a state university of New York in

2551
01:44:14,931 --> 01:44:15,920
farmingdale,
long island.

2552
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,320
And uh,
my manager at the time,

2553
01:44:18,321 --> 01:44:20,450
I think I'd only been doing comedy maybe
three years,

2554
01:44:20,451 --> 01:44:24,890
three or four at the most.
I was in New York city and my manager at

2555
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:26,150
the time,
jason steinburge.

2556
01:44:26,151 --> 01:44:27,320
Do you know jason?
Yes.

2557
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:32,560
Jason.
And I'm only telling you his name 

2558
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:34,721
because I want to burn them on this.
Jason at the time had mostly black 

2559
01:44:34,721 --> 01:44:39,230
comics and all it's comics were like def
jam didn't doing really well.

2560
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:41,660
And so like some great great comics he 
had,

2561
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:44,210
he represented a lot of really good 
guys.

2562
01:44:44,211 --> 01:44:45,860
Tony woods,
greer barnes,

2563
01:44:45,861 --> 01:44:49,010
all these guys were doing really well 
time and we're big in that.

2564
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:54,040
Like so he was always booking these 
events for like black shows and I get a 

2565
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:58,240
c,
I'm begging for work because I don't 

2566
01:44:58,240 --> 01:44:58,240
have any work at the time.
And I hear him,

2567
01:44:58,240 --> 01:44:58,940
I'm in his office,
I hear him go,

2568
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,090
oh,
oh yeah,

2569
01:45:00,091 --> 01:45:03,050
so you need a comment yet yet?
And it's not a def jam show,

2570
01:45:03,070 --> 01:45:04,570
right?
Ensure.

2571
01:45:04,610 --> 01:45:05,450
Yeah.
Okay.

2572
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:09,380
I think I got the 500 bucks and I'm like
500 bucks.

2573
01:45:09,381 --> 01:45:14,381
Fuck,
that's the most I've ever gotten paid 

2574
01:45:14,381 --> 01:45:14,381
for a gig.
And I was like,

2575
01:45:14,381 --> 01:45:15,470
I want this fucking gig.
And he goes,

2576
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,610
all right,
you're going to have to.

2577
01:45:16,611 --> 01:45:19,520
Suny farmingdale train takes you right 
out there.

2578
01:45:19,521 --> 01:45:20,960
It'll be like $10 train ride.

2579
01:45:21,170 --> 01:45:22,250
He's like,
it's your,

2580
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:25,250
you're the intermission of an auction.
And I'm like,

2581
01:45:25,251 --> 01:45:25,820
what?
He's like,

2582
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:27,080
yeah,
it's traditionally,

2583
01:45:27,081 --> 01:45:30,050
this is like an urban room,
but it's just this auction.

2584
01:45:30,051 --> 01:45:32,390
It's going to be like alumni and stuff.
And I'm like,

2585
01:45:32,391 --> 01:45:33,920
all right.
I will,

2586
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:36,230
I go out there on the way out.
Tony woods.

2587
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:41,260
Do you know tony?
Tony and I are sharing and somebody 

2588
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:41,260
who's really good friend of mine,
he's going,

2589
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:42,770
dog,
don't fucking go dog.

2590
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:47,030
They beat up Ralph Harris.
They beat him up on stage and I'm like,

2591
01:45:47,031 --> 01:45:47,630
what?
He's like,

2592
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:51,530
they're gonna kill you guys.
Sam the hog don't go,

2593
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:53,600
so why don't you listen is 500 bucks.
I go,

2594
01:45:53,601 --> 01:45:54,560
no,
but it's an auction.

2595
01:45:54,561 --> 01:45:56,000
It's different.
I'm in the intermission.

2596
01:45:56,001 --> 01:45:58,190
It's an alumni thing.
So I go,

2597
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:03,310
I get there.
I see the line of people waiting to go 

2598
01:46:03,310 --> 01:46:03,310
in and it's not just an urban show.

2599
01:46:03,310 --> 01:46:06,410
This is fucking like urban.
Tony told me,

2600
01:46:06,411 --> 01:46:07,640
he goes,
dude bro.

2601
01:46:07,641 --> 01:46:09,260
He goes there,
their caribbean,

2602
01:46:09,261 --> 01:46:11,060
black,
caribbean,

2603
01:46:11,061 --> 01:46:14,690
black are the guys that they killed me 
because I'm american black.

2604
01:46:14,691 --> 01:46:16,340
He's like,
they're gonna fuck you up.

2605
01:46:16,341 --> 01:46:16,970
And I'm like,
no,

2606
01:46:16,971 --> 01:46:17,330
no,
no.

2607
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:18,590
He's like,
trust me.

2608
01:46:19,130 --> 01:46:22,100
So I see the line of guys going in.
Everybody's gone on fubu,

2609
01:46:22,130 --> 01:46:24,860
you know,
like jerseys and timberlands.

2610
01:46:24,890 --> 01:46:29,890
Every single dude in the crowd,
baggy jeans by the way of fubu stands 

2611
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:29,890
for,
for us,

2612
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:32,490
by us.
And unlike funches,

2613
01:46:32,670 --> 01:46:37,670
you know,
kinda like separatist as it is and it's 

2614
01:46:37,670 --> 01:46:37,910
pretty funny when joey diaz whereas 
that.

2615
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:38,570
Yeah,
sure.

2616
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:41,210
So I go,
this is how long ago this was,

2617
01:46:41,211 --> 01:46:45,200
I go to the payphone and r and r I page 
jason steinburge,

2618
01:46:45,201 --> 01:46:47,120
and he calls me on the payphone and I 
go,

2619
01:46:47,121 --> 01:46:48,860
jason,
I'm fucking outta here.

2620
01:46:49,290 --> 01:46:50,430
I'm outta here.
And he goes,

2621
01:46:50,431 --> 01:46:51,780
you're fine,
you're fine.

2622
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:52,950
It would just be funny.
I'm like,

2623
01:46:52,951 --> 01:46:53,850
no,
this doesn't look good.

2624
01:46:53,851 --> 01:46:54,240
He goes,
no,

2625
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:56,850
you're gonna be fine.
So I go into the auditorium.

2626
01:46:57,090 --> 01:46:57,930
Security goes,
well,

2627
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:58,800
what are you doing?
I go,

2628
01:46:58,801 --> 01:47:01,260
I'm the comedian.
Security goes,

2629
01:47:01,261 --> 01:47:02,670
fuck,
you're the comedian.

2630
01:47:02,671 --> 01:47:07,671
I quit because I'm outta here about here
because he knows what's going to happen.

2631
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:10,200
The security guys saw you as a black 
guy.

2632
01:47:10,201 --> 01:47:10,900
That was.
Yeah.

2633
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:12,120
And he said,
he just says,

2634
01:47:12,121 --> 01:47:13,340
fuck,
this was serious.

2635
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:16,680
It was serious.
They call this gig the little apollo.

2636
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:18,960
Oh my god.
And so I'm like,

2637
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:20,310
fuck.
So I go back to the phone.

2638
01:47:20,311 --> 01:47:21,210
I called jason again.
I go,

2639
01:47:21,211 --> 01:47:21,930
jason,
I'm leaving,

2640
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:23,450
I'm leaving.
I'm just not doing it.

2641
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:24,570
I'm going to die.
He's like,

2642
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:26,010
eddie,
you're funny.

2643
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,680
He's like,
just get up there and do what you do.

2644
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:31,320
And I'm like,
so I,

2645
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:32,590
I'm so nervous,
you know,

2646
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:36,690
when you're so new there's no chance of 
you doing well and awkward.

2647
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:39,090
So I go down and the,
the mc goes,

2648
01:47:39,091 --> 01:47:39,600
uh,
what do you,

2649
01:47:39,601 --> 01:47:43,050
what do you want to come out to?
And I never come out to music before.

2650
01:47:43,051 --> 01:47:45,730
I'm like,
what do you mean you got any led zepplin

2651
01:47:46,910 --> 01:47:48,060
free bird,
you know,

2652
01:47:48,061 --> 01:47:53,061
like fuck,
like a puff the magic dragon.

2653
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:58,350
I don't fucking know what.
And they've got a dj on the side and I'm

2654
01:47:58,351 --> 01:47:59,140
like,
fuck.

2655
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:02,250
And come out too.
Well I don't follow any rap music.

2656
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:02,990
Right?
All at the.

2657
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,480
Especially at that time I came from a 
place called fox chapel and I would come

2658
01:48:06,481 --> 01:48:09,440
out to fuck the police.
I didn't know what that.

2659
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:15,040
And at the time I think knight rider is 
a good one.

2660
01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:18,150
I had the shitty nightrider joke about 
how kid was gay.

2661
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:23,180
It was a gay car because they like l or 
ellen at the time was like coming out 

2662
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:28,101
and I go,
she's not the first gay character kit 

2663
01:48:28,101 --> 01:48:28,170
from nightrider was gay and uh,
it made me.

2664
01:48:28,190 --> 01:48:29,070
He's like,
michael,

2665
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:31,260
michael,
I'm going to pick you up in a minute.

2666
01:48:31,530 --> 01:48:33,030
And uh,
so I was like,

2667
01:48:33,031 --> 01:48:38,031
I'll do the kitchen and I'll come out to
the knight rider like rap song by the 

2668
01:48:38,031 --> 01:48:38,310
way.
Get our kelly the zoo,

2669
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:39,870
get that,
pull that shit up.

2670
01:48:41,410 --> 01:48:42,320
I know.
We'll just,

2671
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:44,260
we'll edit it out later.
Do you need,

2672
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:45,510
we need this,
just trust me.

2673
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:50,580
Just pull it up on the side.
So I go backstage and what they're doing

2674
01:48:50,581 --> 01:48:53,670
is they're auctioning off dates with 
students from the school,

2675
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:58,880
so girls or guys like a guy will come 
out and heal and all the dudes are 

2676
01:49:00,301 --> 01:49:03,570
backstage lifting,
doing foot pumping up,

2677
01:49:03,571 --> 01:49:06,030
doing pushups and they've got dumbbells.
So they're,

2678
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:11,040
they're getting swole and they're 
putting baby oil all over their bottles 

2679
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:11,880
and taking their shirts off.
And they're black as tar.

2680
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:16,910
Yeah.
And they are no one ever making them 

2681
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:16,910
black.

2682
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:19,580
Everyone's ignoring me.
Like what the fuck are you doing back 

2683
01:49:19,580 --> 01:49:22,191
here?
And I swear to god I grabbed one of the 

2684
01:49:22,191 --> 01:49:25,701
bottles of rum that they're drinking and
I just start chugging rum because I'm 

2685
01:49:25,701 --> 01:49:25,701
like,
this is.

2686
01:49:25,701 --> 01:49:29,700
I'm terrified so I shouldn't.
I just start scrolling down this rum and

2687
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:33,230
there.
I saw one chick there,

2688
01:49:33,231 --> 01:49:34,350
the one white chicken.
I'm like,

2689
01:49:34,351 --> 01:49:39,351
she's really fucking hot.
So they're auction dates with the guys 

2690
01:49:39,351 --> 01:49:39,420
and the girls.
The guys will come out,

2691
01:49:39,421 --> 01:49:44,421
they'll just like flex and everybody 
will bid and then the girls will come 

2692
01:49:44,421 --> 01:49:45,030
out and do like a strip tease act.
They'll bring a guy,

2693
01:49:45,031 --> 01:49:50,031
I'll put them in a chair and grind on 
them and do like a lap dance or whipped 

2694
01:49:50,031 --> 01:49:51,180
cream and do all this shit,
you know?

2695
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,020
And they'll go crazy,
but they're bidding.

2696
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:55,360
They get dinner at puff daddy's 
restaurant.

2697
01:49:55,361 --> 01:49:56,890
P diddy had a restaurant in New York.

2698
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:02,040
They had dinner at his place.
They get a limo ride to New York and a 

2699
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:04,741
broadway show.
If they win the date and they're 

2700
01:50:04,741 --> 01:50:04,741
bidding.
And I swear to god,

2701
01:50:04,741 --> 01:50:09,090
dates are going for like $7 and watch 
five sold.

2702
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:14,500
Who could,
you know know,

2703
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:16,510
and I'm looking at the hot fucking white
chick going,

2704
01:50:16,511 --> 01:50:21,511
I want a bit,
we'll backstage this and she has to go 

2705
01:50:21,511 --> 01:50:21,511
out on a date with a guy.
Hey,

2706
01:50:21,511 --> 01:50:23,140
the guys just discussed it.
Well,

2707
01:50:23,141 --> 01:50:26,620
this is where it gets creepy.
So the finale,

2708
01:50:26,621 --> 01:50:31,621
I'm going to be the intermission.
Then the finales is black stripper and 

2709
01:50:31,621 --> 01:50:31,990
she comes up to me and she said,
hey,

2710
01:50:31,991 --> 01:50:33,070
you're the comedian.
I'm like,

2711
01:50:33,071 --> 01:50:33,400
yeah,
she's like,

2712
01:50:33,401 --> 01:50:35,200
my name's heaven.
And I'm like,

2713
01:50:35,201 --> 01:50:38,080
hey heaven.
And so we start talking.

2714
01:50:38,081 --> 01:50:43,081
She goes,
you're going to stick around and bid on 

2715
01:50:43,081 --> 01:50:43,081
me.
And I'm like,

2716
01:50:43,081 --> 01:50:43,081
and she thinks I'm like this 
professional,

2717
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:48,150
you know,
rich comedian and I'm going to be able 

2718
01:50:48,150 --> 01:50:48,150
to bid a lot of money.

2719
01:50:48,150 --> 01:50:49,630
And because you told her that,
I don't know,

2720
01:50:49,660 --> 01:50:51,730
I'm like,
I can't think about her.

2721
01:50:51,731 --> 01:50:53,860
She starts talking to me.
I just want to get a little taste.

2722
01:50:53,861 --> 01:50:57,010
I actually said to her,
get away from me because I was so scared

2723
01:50:57,011 --> 01:50:58,510
because all the guys were checking her 
out and I'm like,

2724
01:50:58,570 --> 01:51:03,570
I just don't want any problems here.
So you thought you were going to get 

2725
01:51:03,570 --> 01:51:03,570
problems because you were talking to the
bikes in front of black,

2726
01:51:03,570 --> 01:51:05,980
kind of given you the mad dog look.
So I'm just like,

2727
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:11,040
I'm just going to fuck.
So has anybody said anything to any 

2728
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:11,040
guys?
No one was just white fear.

2729
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,250
They forget.
Total has been negative to you.

2730
01:51:12,251 --> 01:51:13,000
Got it.
You got to understand,

2731
01:51:13,001 --> 01:51:18,001
I grew up in a place where there was 
like my high school probably had like 

2732
01:51:18,001 --> 01:51:19,990
one black guy and you know,
his last name was huxtable and uh,

2733
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:21,040
we,
we,

2734
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:23,530
I ran track all through college and I 
was a sprinter,

2735
01:51:23,531 --> 01:51:25,870
but I was separate,
like I didn't hang out.

2736
01:51:25,870 --> 01:51:28,390
I hung out with my white friends and I 
wasn't.

2737
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:33,540
So when I moved to New York and I 
started to become friends with all the 

2738
01:51:33,540 --> 01:51:33,540
black comics,
it was like a total new world for me.

2739
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:37,630
But this was like putting me in.
I was out of my comfort zone.

2740
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:40,270
So what's your opening line?
My opening line,

2741
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:45,320
I,
I miss my cue to go out and they're 

2742
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:46,090
yelling for me.
Oh god.

2743
01:51:46,330 --> 01:51:48,100
And I've rewritten all my jokes.
You know,

2744
01:51:48,130 --> 01:51:51,400
when you do that,
I read and I go as not good.

2745
01:51:51,401 --> 01:51:56,401
I'm not confident in this.
And I like stumble almost trip on the 

2746
01:51:56,401 --> 01:51:58,270
stage and they're already.
The emc had been go where my dogs at and

2747
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,320
goes,
ooh.

2748
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:04,500
And they're running to the front of the 
stage when he does it and all putting 

2749
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:04,990
their hands up in the air and I come out
and I go,

2750
01:52:04,991 --> 01:52:07,750
hey,
uh oh,

2751
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:08,950
what happened before I came out?

2752
01:52:08,950 --> 01:52:10,920
They auction off the white chick,
right?

2753
01:52:11,890 --> 01:52:16,890
The bidding goes up to like $350 and 
every black chicken,

2754
01:52:17,591 --> 01:52:21,400
the place is about to fucking rush the 
stage stabber.

2755
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:26,430
And I'm like,
there's going to be a ride in here and 

2756
01:52:26,430 --> 01:52:26,430
the black church,
southern white guy.

2757
01:52:26,430 --> 01:52:28,870
So I'm going down with her.
So black girl saying there,

2758
01:52:28,871 --> 01:52:33,871
they're pissed off.
They're screaming and they're going to 

2759
01:52:33,871 --> 01:52:35,230
get a here.
And so caner mission happens.

2760
01:52:35,231 --> 01:52:37,570
They call me out and I think my opening 
line,

2761
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:42,600
I think I said something about they're 
going to be a riot when they did it on 

2762
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:46,021
the,
when they were bidding on the white 

2763
01:52:46,021 --> 01:52:46,021
chick.
And I go,

2764
01:52:46,021 --> 01:52:46,021
you know,
I was like,

2765
01:52:46,021 --> 01:52:49,790
and I get a little,
I get a little bit of a laugh and there 

2766
01:52:49,790 --> 01:52:51,980
was some creepy dude that was like an 
older dude who was bidding.

2767
01:52:51,981 --> 01:52:53,540
I made a black guy though.

2768
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:58,540
I said it's like a pedophile.
And they kind of laughed at that and 

2769
01:52:58,540 --> 01:52:58,540
then I said,
you guys,

2770
01:52:58,540 --> 01:53:02,651
what are you doing with auctions?
Didn't you learn your lesson with 

2771
01:53:02,651 --> 01:53:04,841
auction years ago?
And I think it's kind of funny and I 

2772
01:53:04,841 --> 01:53:05,700
think like I'm going to get a laugh.
Like,

2773
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:10,900
like kind of like,
oh he's an insult comic and I hear like 

2774
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:14,060
a womb and all of a sudden another who 
and I wasn't quick enough to keep going 

2775
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:20,260
and I just said he paused,
I paused and then you let them just 

2776
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:23,810
started building.
It was like a wave of booing to started 

2777
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:26,900
to like get this mother fucker off the 
stage and people start throwing shit.

2778
01:53:26,901 --> 01:53:28,750
And I swear to god,
I hear it,

2779
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:33,790
get that fucking wait,
get your white motherfucker ass off the 

2780
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:34,880
stage before I kick your white 
motherfuckers.

2781
01:53:35,140 --> 01:53:39,290
And I'm like standing there and I'm,
I'm kind of like in this,

2782
01:53:39,291 --> 01:53:41,210
like all of a sudden I get hit in the 
head with a cup,

2783
01:53:41,450 --> 01:53:45,140
a crumpled up coke cup and he pisses me 
off and I go,

2784
01:53:45,141 --> 01:53:46,310
who the fuck through that?

2785
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:47,510
Who?
And I don't know why,

2786
01:53:47,511 --> 01:53:49,400
but you know,
you get that rage and it's like,

2787
01:53:49,401 --> 01:53:51,260
all this shit's happening to me.
And I'm like a dog.

2788
01:53:51,261 --> 01:53:53,660
That's been so much.
I just started biting everyone.

2789
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,210
Who the fuck?
Who the fuck through that?

2790
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:57,620
And some guy goes,
I did.

2791
01:53:57,710 --> 01:53:58,340
I go,
fuck you.

2792
01:53:58,341 --> 01:54:00,740
You want to throw something?
Come on fucking throw something at me.

2793
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:05,980
Fuck.
The kids starts running towards the 

2794
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:05,980
stage and there are fold out chairs in 
the front.

2795
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:07,520
He picks one of them up and throws it on
the stage.

2796
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:10,670
And unlike at that moment,
I go,

2797
01:54:10,671 --> 01:54:15,671
I'm going to fucking die like a.
And they're pulling cushioning out of 

2798
01:54:15,671 --> 01:54:17,480
the seats and throwing it at me.
And they're booing so loud.

2799
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:19,630
Now here's what's hilarious about eddie 
left.

2800
01:54:20,030 --> 01:54:25,030
This is what he says to me,
that when he tells me the story at the 

2801
01:54:25,030 --> 01:54:25,030
beginning of the day,
he goes,

2802
01:54:25,030 --> 01:54:28,080
now if it happened today,
I totally be able to be like,

2803
01:54:28,081 --> 01:54:33,081
I told the to make it funny.
Comedians always want to think that I 

2804
01:54:33,081 --> 01:54:33,081
have so some.

2805
01:54:33,081 --> 01:54:38,000
I have some ruthless bombs in my past 
and I have gone over these bombings and 

2806
01:54:38,191 --> 01:54:38,730
said,
man,

2807
01:54:38,731 --> 01:54:43,731
if I could just go back and redo it is 
one time I bombed after jim breuer 

2808
01:54:43,731 --> 01:54:45,750
zwiers bottom of my entire career.
It was devastation.

2809
01:54:45,930 --> 01:54:47,190
I think I've talked about this for,
I don't remember.

2810
01:54:47,191 --> 01:54:49,680
I've talked about on the podcast,
didn't brewer.

2811
01:54:49,860 --> 01:54:52,320
We worked together all weekend and I 
could barely follow them.

2812
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:53,430
You know,
this is like,

2813
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,470
I only been doing comedy maybe three 
years,

2814
01:54:55,590 --> 01:55:00,590
maybe three or four years and he was 
just too strong to the middle and I 

2815
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:01,080
really wasn't a headliner.
It was a fake headliner.

2816
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:03,000
I like,
I could do 45 minutes,

2817
01:55:03,001 --> 01:55:05,160
but I would tell my jokes slow,
you know what I mean?

2818
01:55:05,210 --> 01:55:06,170
I couldn't,
you know,

2819
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:11,180
so like when he was on stage and he's.
Bruce has been about going home and he 

2820
01:55:11,311 --> 01:55:16,311
was being,
he was hammered and his mother turned 

2821
01:55:16,311 --> 01:55:16,311
into a demon and it was like really loud
and really animated and he was just,

2822
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:21,380
you know,
sometimes it just gets in the zone and 

2823
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:21,380
brewer used to get in these crazy zones.
Man.

2824
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:24,380
I used to really enjoy watching him 
perform because he could just,

2825
01:55:24,510 --> 01:55:27,150
just as physical performances,
physical,

2826
01:55:27,151 --> 01:55:27,660
you know,
his,

2827
01:55:27,661 --> 01:55:28,140
his,
his,

2828
01:55:28,141 --> 01:55:30,210
his presence on stage.
Fuck.

2829
01:55:30,211 --> 01:55:32,820
He just would nail it.
And this is one time man,

2830
01:55:32,970 --> 01:55:35,670
we had been doing all weekend,
so we'd done two shows friday,

2831
01:55:35,790 --> 01:55:38,190
one show saturday.
This was a late show saturday and brewer

2832
01:55:38,191 --> 01:55:43,191
just knocks it out of the park and there
was a bunch of shit going wrong in my 

2833
01:55:43,191 --> 01:55:43,191
life at the time.
One,

2834
01:55:43,191 --> 01:55:44,580
I just torn my acl.

2835
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:46,800
So it was for the first time in my life 
I couldn't work out.

2836
01:55:46,830 --> 01:55:51,830
I've had never not worked out.
So I had all this tension that I didn't 

2837
01:55:51,830 --> 01:55:51,830
know how to deal with,
you know,

2838
01:55:51,830 --> 01:55:52,720
like for me,
my,

2839
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:54,760
my whole body from the time I was like,
you know,

2840
01:55:54,810 --> 01:55:58,440
14 years old to the time I was,
this was happening when I was 22 or 23,

2841
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:03,270
my body had been designed just to 
fucking to constantly be working,

2842
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:08,300
constantly be exerting all this energy,
whether it's in kickboxing or wrestling 

2843
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:08,300
or something.
There was like,

2844
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:13,170
there's this constant.
Then that was the only way I coped with 

2845
01:56:13,170 --> 01:56:13,210
stress that was gone.
Okay.

2846
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:16,440
And I had moved from New York to boston.
So no acl.

2847
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:19,320
It blows out and moved to New York or 
from boston to New York.

2848
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:20,820
I have no friends.
I don't know anybody there.

2849
01:56:20,821 --> 01:56:22,560
I'm living with my grandfather and my 
grandmother.

2850
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:25,200
My grandmother was dying of an aneurysm.
She had an aneurysm.

2851
01:56:25,201 --> 01:56:27,810
They gave her 72 hours to live.
She lived for 12 years.

2852
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:33,100
Okay.
And I'm staying in their old house that 

2853
01:56:33,100 --> 01:56:33,100
they bought in 1945 and north New 
Jersey,

2854
01:56:33,100 --> 01:56:34,630
which is now in a war zone.
I mean,

2855
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:39,860
while I'm there,
the next door neighbor's door gets 

2856
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:39,860
broken down with a battering ram.
They arrest him for selling crack.

2857
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:40,920
I mean,
no joke,

2858
01:56:40,921 --> 01:56:42,120
man.
It was a scary,

2859
01:56:42,121 --> 01:56:43,920
scary neighborhood.
It used to be an italian neighborhood.

2860
01:56:43,921 --> 01:56:48,921
Then it went just total total chaos.
So I'm staying in the house and my 

2861
01:56:48,921 --> 01:56:48,921
grandma,
like,

2862
01:56:48,921 --> 01:56:49,470
she,
she,

2863
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:51,360
she died.
Both of them are dead now,

2864
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:53,970
but back then she um,
she couldn't move.

2865
01:56:53,971 --> 01:56:58,971
She was completely paralyzed.
She would get bedsores and she could 

2866
01:56:58,971 --> 01:57:01,881
feel some things and sometimes she would
just let out these soul,

2867
01:57:02,670 --> 01:57:07,670
like almost like she was emptying 
herself of the pain and the only way to 

2868
01:57:08,611 --> 01:57:11,250
do it was to let out this horrible 
screech.

2869
01:57:11,490 --> 01:57:14,070
So I'd be in the house and I'd be like 
wandering around,

2870
01:57:14,071 --> 01:57:15,700
maybe I go to the kitchen and grab 
something to eat.

2871
01:57:15,701 --> 01:57:16,020
And here

2872
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:23,070
it was like an animal,
like a wounded animal.

2873
01:57:23,071 --> 01:57:24,510
She couldn't die.
It just,

2874
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:29,720
she was so resilient.
She had those italian peasant jeans and 

2875
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:33,621
she was just so fucked up,
but yet she hung in there for like 12 

2876
01:57:33,621 --> 01:57:33,621
years.
So I'm living in this house.

2877
01:57:33,621 --> 01:57:38,001
Right.
And I'd just broken up with my 

2878
01:57:38,001 --> 01:57:38,001
girlfriend and my manager,
god bless him,

2879
01:57:38,001 --> 01:57:42,320
great guy.
But it was back in the day where we 

2880
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:44,061
talked about like,
when you're not doing so well then 

2881
01:57:44,061 --> 01:57:45,951
everybody has advice for you.
And his advice was you should dress 

2882
01:57:45,951 --> 01:57:45,951
nice,
like,

2883
01:57:45,951 --> 01:57:46,260
you know,
you're a good dress.

2884
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,240
Nice on stage.
So my stupid ass,

2885
01:57:48,330 --> 01:57:53,330
I'm wearing these like nice pants and a 
nice belt and like a club shirt that you

2886
01:57:53,671 --> 01:57:56,070
would go out clubbing.
And I had a nice head of hair back then.

2887
01:57:56,071 --> 01:57:59,190
It was delicious and I'm wearing shiny 
shoes and shit.

2888
01:57:59,490 --> 01:58:03,180
And I just looked like the fucking 
biggest asshole.

2889
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:05,700
I just looked like some club,
shithead,

2890
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:08,430
some goofy italian con.
It's 22 years old.

2891
01:58:08,431 --> 01:58:09,930
It doesn't know anything about the 
world.

2892
01:58:09,931 --> 01:58:11,330
Right?
And I'm onstage and,

2893
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:13,620
and I fucking,
I am panicking.

2894
01:58:13,621 --> 01:58:18,621
I remember brewer got off stage and the 
mc was good about to bring me up and I 

2895
01:58:18,621 --> 01:58:19,560
was off stage when brewer came up.
And I remember he said,

2896
01:58:19,710 --> 01:58:20,150
he said,
hey,

2897
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:20,930
I fucked up that.
How fun.

2898
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:22,000
They're great.
And I go,

2899
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:24,510
I'm going to fucking eat it.
And I remember saying it to him like,

2900
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:26,280
dude,
I'm not fucking confident right now.

2901
01:58:26,281 --> 01:58:27,330
I'm not feeling good right now.
Oh,

2902
01:58:27,331 --> 01:58:28,170
you'll be fine.
You'll be fine.

2903
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:30,240
And I just,
I just was not prepared.

2904
01:58:30,241 --> 01:58:32,520
I just went up there and I went into 
flames.

2905
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:34,940
Just went into one girl.
I remember what girl in the audit,

2906
01:58:34,950 --> 01:58:36,900
she goes,
I was just eating dick up there.

2907
01:58:36,901 --> 01:58:40,600
And I was editing my material and 
chopping the jokes as I go along and one

2908
01:58:40,610 --> 01:58:42,190
girl goes,
you kinda hot,

2909
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:44,650
but you're not funny.
Oh.

2910
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:47,470
And there's nothing you can say when you
know that that's true.

2911
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:52,500
Not that I'm kind of hot,
but that I'm not funny in another guy 

2912
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:52,500
goes,
you're fucking suck.

2913
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:53,640
You fucking suck.
He's just big meat heads,

2914
01:58:53,770 --> 01:58:56,080
snap and nothing.
I could say he was right.

2915
01:58:56,081 --> 01:58:57,880
I fucking sucked.
I knew I fucking suck.

2916
01:58:58,010 --> 01:59:00,550
There was nothing I can do.
And I was supposed to do 45 minutes.

2917
01:59:00,551 --> 01:59:02,950
I wound up doing like 30.
I got a few laughs.

2918
01:59:02,951 --> 01:59:05,500
I started getting a few laughs,
but there were so shaky.

2919
01:59:05,501 --> 01:59:08,110
It was just the worst set ever,
the worst bombing ever.

2920
01:59:08,111 --> 01:59:11,560
And I still to this day,
we'll go back in my head that fucking 20

2921
01:59:11,561 --> 01:59:14,110
years ago,
that's my gig still to this day,

2922
01:59:14,111 --> 01:59:17,350
the worst one I've ever had.
And you'll go back and replay it over in

2923
01:59:17,351 --> 01:59:18,110
your head.
Okay.

2924
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:23,130
I could've said this,
the heat that goes through your body 

2925
01:59:23,130 --> 01:59:23,130
when you're bombing,
there's like,

2926
01:59:23,130 --> 01:59:23,710
people don't understand when you're 
bombing,

2927
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:26,470
there's a,
there's a hot flash.

2928
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:28,750
You almost get hot flashes.
So I'm having it.

2929
01:59:28,751 --> 01:59:30,310
When the guy through the,
the,

2930
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:31,270
the,
the,

2931
01:59:31,630 --> 01:59:34,600
that knocked me out of my aggression.
When the chair came up onto the stage,

2932
01:59:34,601 --> 01:59:35,620
I was like,
okay,

2933
01:59:35,621 --> 01:59:38,290
I'm not going to fight a crowd.
And uh,

2934
01:59:38,710 --> 01:59:41,880
and I gotta get the fuck out of here.
The girl on the side of the stage that,

2935
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:44,980
that booked me is going to get off,
get off.

2936
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:49,780
And I think this is,
I was supposed to do like 40 minutes and

2937
01:59:49,781 --> 01:59:53,560
I think I'm at 45 seconds or something 
or four minutes.

2938
01:59:53,561 --> 01:59:54,850
I forget.
It was so short.

2939
01:59:55,060 --> 01:59:56,740
She's going to get off,
get off.

2940
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:59,860
And I go,
this is how badly I wanted the money.

2941
01:59:59,861 --> 02:00:02,140
I go,
where's my check?

2942
02:00:02,670 --> 02:00:04,540
Oh my gosh,
from the stage,

2943
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:07,120
but no one could hear me even with the 
microphone there.

2944
02:00:07,121 --> 02:00:08,940
Bullying that loud.
I just looked aside.

2945
02:00:09,060 --> 02:00:10,240
I go,
where's my check?

2946
02:00:10,241 --> 02:00:12,100
I go,
I'm still getting paid.

2947
02:00:12,610 --> 02:00:14,500
And she's like,
yes,

2948
02:00:14,530 --> 02:00:15,430
yes.
And I went,

2949
02:00:15,431 --> 02:00:16,510
no,
I want to see the check.

2950
02:00:16,511 --> 02:00:18,360
I want to make sure while you're 
onstage.

2951
02:00:18,370 --> 02:00:23,370
And I always was under the impression 
like you have to do your time to get 

2952
02:00:23,370 --> 02:00:25,030
paid and they're getting me off before 
my time.

2953
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:30,300
So are they going to like not paying?
So I want that $500 a month and I'm 

2954
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:34,621
going.
I was willing to stand up there for 35 

2955
02:00:34,621 --> 02:00:35,530
minutes and take the abuse.
I wanted the money so bad.

2956
02:00:36,010 --> 02:00:39,760
And don't you think though that you 
learn so much about those,

2957
02:00:39,910 --> 02:00:43,060
about your comedy from bombing?
So that just like fall to me.

2958
02:00:43,061 --> 02:00:44,710
Yeah,
it's the ultimate school.

2959
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:46,240
Fuck you and I.
Right.

2960
02:00:46,241 --> 02:00:46,990
Then I said,
uh,

2961
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:47,970
I go,
uh,

2962
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:50,500
let me see the checks.
And they went and got the check.

2963
02:00:50,530 --> 02:00:55,530
That's it.
That's why I was up there four and a 

2964
02:00:55,530 --> 02:00:55,530
half minutes.
They had to go get the check,

2965
02:00:55,530 --> 02:00:58,180
come back and then you got off offstage.
I get off stage and they rush me out the

2966
02:00:58,181 --> 02:01:01,630
back door like people around me because 
they're afraid to riots going to start.

2967
02:01:01,810 --> 02:01:06,810
We go up the back door,
the stripper is waiting there and she 

2968
02:01:06,810 --> 02:01:08,440
smoking weed with a couple of guys out 
there and she goes,

2969
02:01:08,441 --> 02:01:09,490
hey,
where are you going?

2970
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:15,060
And I'm like,
you didn't see what just fucking 

2971
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:15,060
happened?
She goes,

2972
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:15,060
yeah,
that was some bullshit.

2973
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:16,510
And I'm like,
so she can stick around though,

2974
02:01:16,740 --> 02:01:17,530
you know,
in bid on me.

2975
02:01:17,531 --> 02:01:19,400
I go,
are you fucking kidding me?

2976
02:01:20,260 --> 02:01:22,540
Kidding me?
Do you think they would have let it go?

2977
02:01:22,550 --> 02:01:24,760
They were,
the audience members would have forgot.

2978
02:01:24,761 --> 02:01:27,190
I don't know she,
but I got her phone number.

2979
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:29,000
She gave me her phone number.
She said,

2980
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:31,510
give me a call sometime and I get in the
car.

2981
02:01:31,530 --> 02:01:36,530
Do you remember?
This is like 1997 or 98 that this 

2982
02:01:36,530 --> 02:01:40,831
happened or whatever.
The guy drives me to the train station 

2983
02:01:40,831 --> 02:01:40,831
in a tr.
Nice in it.

2984
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:43,700
In this little black triumph.
Any so fucked up.

2985
02:01:43,701 --> 02:01:48,701
He's been drinking so much rom and he's 
driving like 100 miles an hour and I'm 

2986
02:01:48,701 --> 02:01:48,950
going because he wants to get back and 
I'm like,

2987
02:01:48,951 --> 02:01:50,660
dude,
slow the fuck down.

2988
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:52,940
Slow the you're going to kill us.
And he goes,

2989
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:54,500
man,
you suck.

2990
02:01:54,710 --> 02:01:56,330
He's like,
you are terrible.

2991
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:57,740
And I'm like,
shut the fuck up.

2992
02:01:57,741 --> 02:01:58,970
And he's like,
no man,

2993
02:01:58,971 --> 02:02:01,970
like I've seen comedians.
You're the worst I've ever seen.

2994
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:03,830
And he's driving me to the train 
station.

2995
02:02:03,831 --> 02:02:06,980
Tell me how bad I am.
And it was a black dude.

2996
02:02:06,981 --> 02:02:08,330
Yeah.
And I get on the train.

2997
02:02:08,330 --> 02:02:13,330
It was the most racist I've ever been in
my life because I'm just looking at 

2998
02:02:13,330 --> 02:02:13,330
every black person,
like blaming them for what happened.

2999
02:02:14,060 --> 02:02:15,920
But I imagine it live in your whole life
like that.

3000
02:02:15,921 --> 02:02:20,921
But welcome to being black.
I get home and at the time I was living 

3001
02:02:20,921 --> 02:02:20,921
with him constantly fucking with him.
I mean,

3002
02:02:20,921 --> 02:02:22,790
it was like the river I learned,
right?

3003
02:02:22,791 --> 02:02:24,050
That,
that was a great learning experience.

3004
02:02:24,051 --> 02:02:26,840
I get home,
I'm living with my sister and uh,

3005
02:02:26,990 --> 02:02:31,990
at the time,
and this goes back to like answering 

3006
02:02:31,990 --> 02:02:34,721
machine time,
like people had answered machines and 

3007
02:02:34,721 --> 02:02:34,721
the cell phone.
Well I,

3008
02:02:34,721 --> 02:02:36,170
I,
I must've called street.

3009
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:37,760
I don't even remember calling the 
stripper,

3010
02:02:37,761 --> 02:02:42,761
but I must've because my grandfather 
dies and we're on the way to my 

3011
02:02:43,131 --> 02:02:48,131
grandfather's funeral.
We had already just done the viewing or 

3012
02:02:48,131 --> 02:02:50,681
whatever.
When you go then from church and you go 

3013
02:02:50,681 --> 02:02:50,681
to the cemetery,
we're going to the cemetery.

3014
02:02:50,681 --> 02:02:51,950
I'm in.
My dad had one of those,

3015
02:02:51,951 --> 02:02:56,000
like he had a cadillac I remember with a
car phone built into the car.

3016
02:02:56,030 --> 02:02:57,350
Nice.
And my dad,

3017
02:02:57,351 --> 02:03:01,990
my mom and like two of my sisters and me
and uh,

3018
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:07,600
uh,
my sister decides to check her 

3019
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:07,600
voicemail,
uh,

3020
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:11,710
the answer machine at home and puts it 
on speaker and she listens to the 

3021
02:03:11,710 --> 02:03:13,110
stripper and I swear to god it comes on 
and goes.

3022
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:15,800
It's like next message.
Beep.

3023
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:20,000
Hi eddie.
This is heaven because stripper.

3024
02:03:20,001 --> 02:03:22,730
You met out at suny farmingdale itself,
a stripper.

3025
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:25,160
I'm just returning your call.

3026
02:03:28,190 --> 02:03:31,790
My sister looks at me and goes at pap 
apps.

3027
02:03:31,791 --> 02:03:36,791
Funeral dad's funeral.
That's hilarious.

3028
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:39,190
That's great.
Don't you?

3029
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:44,260
Don't you think though that you like 
your comedy makes these big leaps after 

3030
02:03:44,260 --> 02:03:44,260
these horrible,
disastrous bombings?

3031
02:03:44,260 --> 02:03:45,930
Yeah,
you absolutely have to go through it.

3032
02:03:45,980 --> 02:03:46,760
Check it,
fired up.

3033
02:03:46,761 --> 02:03:51,761
Even if I see like a bad review online,
like I'll read 10 great reviews of like 

3034
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:54,560
a show that I was at and then one guy 
says,

3035
02:03:54,561 --> 02:03:56,990
I'm still waiting for my first love 
that.

3036
02:03:57,290 --> 02:03:59,060
Can I just get like a little anxiety?
Like,

3037
02:03:59,061 --> 02:03:59,990
man,
I got to work harder.

3038
02:04:00,050 --> 02:04:02,930
But see I'm for one,
like one bad one will.

3039
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:05,300
I think that shit's good for you.
I really do.

3040
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:07,580
I'm different.
I and I don't want to blow smoke up your

3041
02:04:07,581 --> 02:04:12,581
ass,
but I like I've said I need good comics 

3042
02:04:12,581 --> 02:04:15,521
to inspire me and I see so much shit 
comic and I saw you one night working 

3043
02:04:15,521 --> 02:04:16,430
out and I was like fuck,

3044
02:04:16,431 --> 02:04:21,431
He's going deep.
He's going deep and he's not afraid and 

3045
02:04:21,431 --> 02:04:21,740
he's fucking like when you're doing.
The monkeys were just a bunch of monkeys

3046
02:04:21,741 --> 02:04:23,810
on a rock spinning through and I'm like 
fuck.

3047
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:25,250
And I just went,

3048
02:04:25,251 --> 02:04:26,720
I gotta go home and write,

3049
02:04:26,721 --> 02:04:28,440
I look like one of those lights.
Awesome.

3050
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:30,440
I said to you have to show I go fuck 
you.

3051
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:33,170
And I like had to hurry home and start 
like,

3052
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:36,920
just like.
And I like to watch really good comp.

3053
02:04:36,990 --> 02:04:38,040
Like I'm one of these comics

3054
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:43,040
I love when I get to pick my middle act.
I love to bring the best fucking 

3055
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:46,551
comedian I can bring.
Did I go on the road with joey diaz and 

3056
02:04:46,551 --> 02:04:49,401
does he just show ideas?
Is the funniest guy that's ever walked 

3057
02:04:49,401 --> 02:04:51,591
the face.
I've never laughed more at anybody ever 

3058
02:04:51,591 --> 02:04:51,720
in my life.
Twenty three years of being a comic.

3059
02:04:51,721 --> 02:04:53,130
Have you ever met anybody funnier than 
joey?

3060
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:55,050
I mean it's like a cartoon.
He's just,

3061
02:04:55,051 --> 02:04:57,790
he's just explosive with energy.
Just makes you happy.

3062
02:04:57,791 --> 02:04:58,980
You know?
He just ridiculous.

3063
02:04:58,981 --> 02:05:01,490
It makes you funny or two.
He makes me funnier and funnier with our

3064
02:05:01,491 --> 02:05:02,800
work with joe.
That's how I feel better.

3065
02:05:02,801 --> 02:05:05,460
And that's how Brian Mccarthy,
I feel the same way.

3066
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:08,370
But what you said,
like I saw dave chappelle once at the,

3067
02:05:08,371 --> 02:05:09,840
at the comedy store and I felt the same 
way.

3068
02:05:09,841 --> 02:05:10,680
I want to go home and write.

3069
02:05:10,890 --> 02:05:12,690
I'm totally inspired by great comics 
too.

3070
02:05:12,691 --> 02:05:14,520
Like I saw louis at the,
um,

3071
02:05:14,670 --> 02:05:19,670
at the improv and hollywood,
lucy kay and I wanted to go home and 

3072
02:05:19,670 --> 02:05:21,951
write.
It was really great performance in 

3073
02:05:21,951 --> 02:05:22,170
norton recently I saw norton at the cap 
city and austin fucking great.

3074
02:05:22,171 --> 02:05:23,670
And that same feeling I want to go 
right.

3075
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:27,120
But I also get inspired by people who 
don't like me.

3076
02:05:28,110 --> 02:05:29,370
Yeah.
Even fucking,

3077
02:05:29,371 --> 02:05:30,500
you know,
haters online.

3078
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:35,720
I can get a million people who love me.
Dude is the greatest fucking show I've 

3079
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:35,720
ever seen.
Some amazing.

3080
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:38,370
And one person who's like,
you know,

3081
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,080
fucking hang it up,
streak two ufc.

3082
02:05:40,110 --> 02:05:41,460
Oh,
what bitch,

3083
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:42,360
you know,
I'll get,

3084
02:05:42,570 --> 02:05:44,720
I'll get like fired up to.
I have to zone them,

3085
02:05:44,730 --> 02:05:46,710
work harder.
It gets good to zone them out.

3086
02:05:46,711 --> 02:05:48,990
But it's good to be humble.
I really believe.

3087
02:05:49,010 --> 02:05:54,010
I mean,
it's a bad feeling to have someone 

3088
02:05:54,010 --> 02:05:54,010
negatively critique your work.

3089
02:05:54,010 --> 02:05:57,290
It's a terrible feeling,
but I think there's something to it 

3090
02:05:57,290 --> 02:05:58,530
that's good for an artist.
There's something that keeps you sort of

3091
02:05:58,531 --> 02:06:03,531
humble and balanced,
especially in this either direct 

3092
02:06:03,531 --> 02:06:04,650
adulation relationship that you have 
with an audience.

3093
02:06:04,651 --> 02:06:06,780
You know,
you're immediately giving them what they

3094
02:06:06,781 --> 02:06:11,781
want to hear and they immediately laugh 
and they tell you how much they love 

3095
02:06:11,781 --> 02:06:11,781
you.
I mean,

3096
02:06:11,781 --> 02:06:11,820
you can get imbalanced by that.
You can get lazy.

3097
02:06:11,821 --> 02:06:16,821
I mean,
we both know comics had got fucking 

3098
02:06:16,821 --> 02:06:18,770
super,
super lazy and one of the reasons is 

3099
02:06:18,770 --> 02:06:18,770
like,
you know,

3100
02:06:18,770 --> 02:06:18,900
they're not for whatever reason,
there's not,

3101
02:06:18,930 --> 02:06:20,340
there's not enough balance.
You know,

3102
02:06:20,341 --> 02:06:25,341
they just got to a point where it was 
too easy for them to many people being 

3103
02:06:25,341 --> 02:06:26,190
nice to them and they just,
they lose it.

3104
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:31,240
Know chris rock once had a really 
important thing that I read where he's 

3105
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:31,240
talking about how he bombed really hard.

3106
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:33,720
What's going on after martin Lawrence 
Martin lawrence,

3107
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:35,340
which I did too,
by the way,

3108
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,550
a bunch of times at the comedy store 
when I was a fucking.

3109
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:42,330
When I was on hardball to show that 
nobody ever saw on fox,

3110
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:45,360
I would go on after a lot of guys to 
comments are mitzi shore.

3111
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:48,600
God bless her.
She did a tremendous amount for me early

3112
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:50,460
in my career and one of the things that 
she did for me,

3113
02:06:50,461 --> 02:06:54,600
she always put me on the most 
devastating comedians in the night right

3114
02:06:54,601 --> 02:06:56,340
on after them,
like dice clay.

3115
02:06:56,370 --> 02:06:59,500
I went off to dice clay 100 times.
Richard pryor have to.

3116
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:04,720
Richard pryor when he was in a 
wheelchair when he couldn't even talk 

3117
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:07,131
for five weeks.
Every time martin lawrence would have a 

3118
02:07:07,131 --> 02:07:10,251
set.
This is back when martin law into that 

3119
02:07:10,251 --> 02:07:10,251
tv show.
He was all fucking destroy your.

3120
02:07:10,251 --> 02:07:14,990
I'd never seen an aston martin either.
Martin lawrence is in the back parking 

3121
02:07:14,990 --> 02:07:14,990
lot with an aston martin.
I was like,

3122
02:07:14,990 --> 02:07:19,401
what the fuck is this thing like me and 
a couple other comics like circling 

3123
02:07:19,401 --> 02:07:19,401
around.
I was driving a volkswagen.

3124
02:07:19,401 --> 02:07:21,150
Sure rocco.
It's like scratching my chin.

3125
02:07:21,151 --> 02:07:23,400
Like what the fuck is this man?
This thing's crazy.

3126
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:26,670
And martin would just devastate the main
room.

3127
02:07:26,671 --> 02:07:29,460
I mean devastate when martin lawrence 
was in his prime,

3128
02:07:29,610 --> 02:07:33,270
that guy does not get enough respect 
because if you go back and watch some of

3129
02:07:33,271 --> 02:07:36,190
his old standup,
he's just fucking

3130
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:37,420
funny.
And that show,

3131
02:07:37,421 --> 02:07:41,080
martin do that shows that the writing 
was like nonexistent,

3132
02:07:41,230 --> 02:07:46,230
but he carried the whole show with all 
his characters and he pretended to be 

3133
02:07:46,230 --> 02:07:47,530
women.
He's fucking funny.

3134
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:50,260
I would be a backstage st just like the 
brewer night.

3135
02:07:50,261 --> 02:07:52,030
I mean at least I had been past the 
brewer thing.

3136
02:07:52,031 --> 02:07:53,740
Like it happened like a couple years 
before that.

3137
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:58,920
So I had recovered and I knew how to 
like get out of the gate strong because 

3138
02:07:58,920 --> 02:07:59,020
90 percent black audience,
you know,

3139
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:04,440
and I'm just ready to go on after him 
and he's crushing and then he's like,

3140
02:08:04,901 --> 02:08:06,010
who's coming up next?
You know,

3141
02:08:06,011 --> 02:08:08,500
he has to bring me up.
So martin lawrence brings me up,

3142
02:08:08,710 --> 02:08:10,330
you know,
he calls over to the piano guy.

3143
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:12,400
Piano guy says joe rogan.
And he goes,

3144
02:08:12,401 --> 02:08:14,170
all right,
y'all give it up for this next comedian,

3145
02:08:14,171 --> 02:08:16,140
mr joe rogan,
very nice guy says,

3146
02:08:16,270 --> 02:08:19,270
and I just go up and eat a bag of shit 
up.

3147
02:08:19,270 --> 02:08:22,420
Just a,
a big manure bag that you would buy like

3148
02:08:22,421 --> 02:08:25,450
at a fucking farm depot know,
just filled with shit.

3149
02:08:25,451 --> 02:08:29,050
I'm just chilling and people are getting
up in droves and leaving.

3150
02:08:29,290 --> 02:08:34,290
But all that stuff makes you way better.
It makes you a way better comic because 

3151
02:08:34,290 --> 02:08:35,170
you realize you don't ever want to make 
that feel,

3152
02:08:35,171 --> 02:08:40,171
that feeling.
It's like you feel the fire behind your 

3153
02:08:40,171 --> 02:08:42,841
feet and it makes you run faster.
Like you're only going to run a certain 

3154
02:08:42,841 --> 02:08:42,841
amount when you're not pushed that.
No,

3155
02:08:42,970 --> 02:08:45,320
I feel like it's funny.
Like you said,

3156
02:08:45,340 --> 02:08:46,630
sometimes I just go,
I'm shit,

3157
02:08:46,631 --> 02:08:47,890
I suck now,
blah blah blah.

3158
02:08:48,190 --> 02:08:52,360
But I don't realize that I don't have 
the ability to bomb like that anymore.

3159
02:08:52,570 --> 02:08:54,730
I mean it can happen in a bad situation 
now.

3160
02:08:54,731 --> 02:08:56,500
Like something really fucked up 
happening.

3161
02:08:57,010 --> 02:09:01,060
But like I used to have to New York,
you know,

3162
02:09:01,061 --> 02:09:02,920
million times sde used to the seller.

3163
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:05,290
She just wait and put you up after the 
hardest person to,

3164
02:09:05,350 --> 02:09:07,330
to,
to make sure you were ready for it.

3165
02:09:07,350 --> 02:09:10,860
I had to tell forever,
every night in the cellar and that's all

3166
02:09:10,861 --> 02:09:15,861
I got so dark because patel would just.
His jokes were so amazing and so dark to

3167
02:09:17,681 --> 02:09:22,681
that.
It was like I had to go to a darker 

3168
02:09:22,681 --> 02:09:23,540
place than him pick up the frequency 
where he leaves.

3169
02:09:23,860 --> 02:09:27,610
And I remember just bombing so bad in 
the seller that I would just start,

3170
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:32,370
start just like,
what's the fucking freestyling,

3171
02:09:32,410 --> 02:09:37,410
just saying the worst things I could say
like talking about killing babies and 

3172
02:09:37,410 --> 02:09:41,161
shit,
like trying to get out of this horrible 

3173
02:09:41,161 --> 02:09:41,890
that I would just shock the fuck out of 
the audience and it never works.

3174
02:09:41,980 --> 02:09:43,550
And it was like,
that never worked.

3175
02:09:43,570 --> 02:09:46,150
It was almost like if you go into a zone
though of like,

3176
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:51,300
I'm going to pretend like they're not 
here and I'm just going to just keep 

3177
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:53,701
saying this shit and hopefully they're 
going to come around because this is so 

3178
02:09:53,701 --> 02:09:53,701
painful.

3179
02:09:53,701 --> 02:09:54,280
I'm in this terrible,
terrible bomb.

3180
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:57,040
But I mean I had,
like I watched you on,

3181
02:09:57,041 --> 02:09:57,910
what was it,
a,

3182
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:59,800
any evening at the caroline's comedy 
hour.

3183
02:09:59,801 --> 02:10:01,830
That's where I saw you first when I was 
like a little kid.

3184
02:10:01,890 --> 02:10:06,890
I didn't even do comedy.
And I'm like watching you and you were 

3185
02:10:06,890 --> 02:10:09,781
dirty.
I remember you and sarah were on it and 

3186
02:10:09,781 --> 02:10:09,781
sarah was dirty and so he's a little 
kid.

3187
02:10:09,781 --> 02:10:10,520
I'm like,
these are good comics.

3188
02:10:10,570 --> 02:10:12,460
These two,
these are convenient.

3189
02:10:12,461 --> 02:10:17,461
It was so hard for me back then.
They even come up with seven minutes of 

3190
02:10:17,461 --> 02:10:20,071
material that I could do on tv.
I would have to sit down and go over my 

3191
02:10:20,071 --> 02:10:20,071
shit.
I was like,

3192
02:10:20,071 --> 02:10:20,380
god,
I can't do that bit.

3193
02:10:20,381 --> 02:10:25,381
I can't do this,
but I might have had an hour of 

3194
02:10:25,381 --> 02:10:25,381
material.
I might have had five.

3195
02:10:25,381 --> 02:10:28,321
I could do it.
I couldn't imagine you bombing because 

3196
02:10:28,321 --> 02:10:30,931
of the way your act was like you had the
competence and the dirtiness and 

3197
02:10:30,931 --> 02:10:30,931
everything.

3198
02:10:30,931 --> 02:10:31,660
So I was like,
this guy can't bomb.

3199
02:10:31,661 --> 02:10:36,661
It's not.
So you probably a lot less bombs than 

3200
02:10:36,661 --> 02:10:36,740
I've had.
Wow.

3201
02:10:36,980 --> 02:10:37,880
Well,
yeah.

3202
02:10:37,940 --> 02:10:38,360
Was it.
Well,

3203
02:10:38,361 --> 02:10:39,490
you know,
I've had a bunch man.

3204
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:41,300
I don't know about that.
I don't know how many you've had,

3205
02:10:41,301 --> 02:10:46,301
but especially the store.
I had a gang of them in the early days 

3206
02:10:46,301 --> 02:10:46,301
when I was going on after,
you know,

3207
02:10:46,301 --> 02:10:48,260
like really good comics over and over 
and over again.

3208
02:10:48,290 --> 02:10:50,060
I had a.
I had a quite a few bombings.

3209
02:10:50,090 --> 02:10:52,790
Yeah,
but the early days were way worse.

3210
02:10:52,820 --> 02:10:57,140
The open mic days were fucking brutal 
because you're really not supposed to be

3211
02:10:57,141 --> 02:10:59,390
up there talking,
you really not good enough.

3212
02:10:59,450 --> 02:11:02,840
And then look,
brian has been doing standup.

3213
02:11:02,860 --> 02:11:05,840
He's been doing open mic nights just for
a short period of time.

3214
02:11:06,020 --> 02:11:10,610
So you're in that kind of zone area 
where you're learning it and figuring it

3215
02:11:10,611 --> 02:11:15,611
out.
You're in that stage of your life where 

3216
02:11:15,611 --> 02:11:15,611
sometimes,
you know,

3217
02:11:15,611 --> 02:11:18,370
I've seen you go on stage and you're 
trying out new joke and it just doesn't 

3218
02:11:18,370 --> 02:11:18,370
work and you're just fucked.
You know,

3219
02:11:18,370 --> 02:11:20,030
you're just stuck in this rut.
You know,

3220
02:11:20,060 --> 02:11:21,290
you're right there right now.
Right.

3221
02:11:21,610 --> 02:11:26,610
Well,
I had a horrible thing the other day 

3222
02:11:26,610 --> 02:11:27,880
where somebody I knew a was sitting in 
the front row and they thought,

3223
02:11:27,940 --> 02:11:29,200
oh,
this is awesome.

3224
02:11:29,201 --> 02:11:29,620
I,
you know,

3225
02:11:29,621 --> 02:11:34,621
I,
I could say talk to brian while he's on 

3226
02:11:34,621 --> 02:11:34,621
stage.
He said the whole time she's just like,

3227
02:11:34,621 --> 02:11:38,740
making me going like that,
or she like I said something like,

3228
02:11:38,741 --> 02:11:40,000
oh,
I just broke up with my ex.

3229
02:11:40,300 --> 02:11:41,440
I hate that bitch.
And she's like,

3230
02:11:41,470 --> 02:11:42,670
oh,
whenever you're not over her.

3231
02:11:42,671 --> 02:11:44,110
And like I said,
it loud enough where like,

3232
02:11:44,170 --> 02:11:48,880
it kept on like fucking me up and then 
it just throws you off and I felt it.

3233
02:11:48,881 --> 02:11:51,070
I felt I felt way off my tracks,
you know,

3234
02:11:51,071 --> 02:11:52,680
but I didn't,
I never feel.

3235
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:55,090
I haven't really felt like bomb.

3236
02:11:55,110 --> 02:12:00,090
Well you gave me anxiety so I had to go 
on afterwards and I was like,

3237
02:12:00,091 --> 02:12:02,160
this bitch going to talk to me.
Fuck.

3238
02:12:02,190 --> 02:12:05,430
She going to talk to me too though?
Yeah.

3239
02:12:05,431 --> 02:12:06,720
But I don't want to.
I don't want.

3240
02:12:06,721 --> 02:12:07,710
I'd rather not.
You know,

3241
02:12:07,711 --> 02:12:08,400
people say,
oh,

3242
02:12:08,401 --> 02:12:09,480
you know,
you're so good with hecklers.

3243
02:12:09,481 --> 02:12:10,770
You must love it when people talk.
Shit.

3244
02:12:10,771 --> 02:12:12,870
No,
I want everybody to have fun.

3245
02:12:12,871 --> 02:12:15,000
I don't want to have to ruin someone's 
mind.

3246
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:20,160
Bob hope joke.
That one that talked a few times on the 

3247
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:21,340
podcast before when I did that and I was
booed and hissed.

3248
02:12:21,341 --> 02:12:23,080
I took off comedy for five years

3249
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,180
to find joe.
Bob hope died.

3250
02:12:26,181 --> 02:12:27,710
He goes to hear bob hope died.
Yeah.

3251
02:12:27,711 --> 02:12:30,110
They're going to fly out his body to 
entertain all the dead troops.

3252
02:12:30,270 --> 02:12:34,250
That's great.
It was the day he died though,

3253
02:12:34,251 --> 02:12:35,930
and it was like during like,
you know,

3254
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:40,960
after he got some orange and I say,
what my favorite joke of yours is the 

3255
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:42,050
one that you're doing right now,
but your dog?

3256
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:43,210
He goes,
uh,

3257
02:12:43,211 --> 02:12:45,950
I have a bunch of cats and dogs from 
other relationships.

3258
02:12:46,130 --> 02:12:48,230
It's like whenever we break up,
I keep their cat,

3259
02:12:48,231 --> 02:12:53,231
I keep the dog.
He goes and they all have the same 

3260
02:12:53,231 --> 02:12:53,600
personality as the girls that I was 
dating.

3261
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:58,660
It's really funny,
like all of them hate it when I come in 

3262
02:12:58,660 --> 02:13:00,791
their face.
Now I break it down to each and chris 

3263
02:13:00,791 --> 02:13:01,940
white house from Australia.
I think he's a kiwi,

3264
02:13:01,941 --> 02:13:04,580
but he lives in Australia and he's 
really dark and really funny.

3265
02:13:04,730 --> 02:13:06,140
Really good job.
What's a kiwi?

3266
02:13:06,380 --> 02:13:09,020
A new zealander and a.
His name's chris.

3267
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:12,260
When he writes jokes,
he writes a ton.

3268
02:13:12,261 --> 02:13:13,160
He on twitter.
He's right.

3269
02:13:13,161 --> 02:13:18,161
I don't know his name on twitter,
but he writes tons of jokes all the 

3270
02:13:18,161 --> 02:13:20,351
time.
He did a joke about the crocodile 

3271
02:13:20,351 --> 02:13:22,331
hunter.
The day the crocodile hunter died and 

3272
02:13:22,331 --> 02:13:24,050
somebody in the audience yells out too 
soon and he goes to soon.

3273
02:13:24,290 --> 02:13:26,630
I would have done that joke on the 
fucking boat.

3274
02:13:29,560 --> 02:13:34,560
I said something about the crocodile 
hunter when he died and I actually felt 

3275
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:34,590
bad about it and the reason why I felt 
bad about it,

3276
02:13:34,591 --> 02:13:35,240
but some,
you know,

3277
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:38,370
what I said was I go,
he dies,

3278
02:13:38,371 --> 02:13:40,140
I go,
my act gains 10 minutes.

3279
02:13:40,141 --> 02:13:42,960
I don't see the loss.
That's what I wrote on a message board.

3280
02:13:43,650 --> 02:13:45,230
And I just flippantly,
you know,

3281
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:48,000
comics will say shit like that just to 
fuck with each other.

3282
02:13:48,001 --> 02:13:49,700
Like have you ever done the open anthony
show now?

3283
02:13:49,770 --> 02:13:51,760
Never done great fucking show.
And it's,

3284
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:56,960
everyone tries to say that like louis,
c k will say the mean is shit to norton 

3285
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:57,030
who will say the meaning shit to ob what
they say,

3286
02:13:57,031 --> 02:14:02,031
the mediumship active but it's not real.
It's like you're trying to get laughs 

3287
02:14:02,031 --> 02:14:02,031
and someone said,
you know,

3288
02:14:02,031 --> 02:14:06,440
hey man,
this guy has like a family and children 

3289
02:14:06,440 --> 02:14:06,440
with his children read that.

3290
02:14:06,440 --> 02:14:06,440
And I went,
oh shit.

3291
02:14:06,440 --> 02:14:06,630
And then I thought about it.
I'm like,

3292
02:14:06,631 --> 02:14:11,631
okay.
I don't even really think that I don't 

3293
02:14:11,631 --> 02:14:11,631
even really believe that,
and I was really mad at myself because I

3294
02:14:11,631 --> 02:14:16,401
would have totally written a crocodile 
hunter bit if it wasn't for the fact 

3295
02:14:16,401 --> 02:14:17,640
that I felt bad that I wrote that I said
that,

3296
02:14:17,641 --> 02:14:21,060
which was our very short sighted and it 
wasn't really even funny.

3297
02:14:21,061 --> 02:14:22,830
It was just like a quick,
easy,

3298
02:14:22,831 --> 02:14:25,200
cheap like jive.
And I thought about it.

3299
02:14:25,201 --> 02:14:25,950
I said,
god damn it,

3300
02:14:25,951 --> 02:14:30,951
I fucked myself out of a good crocodile 
hunter because for sure that's like 

3301
02:14:30,951 --> 02:14:31,390
right up my alley,
you know,

3302
02:14:31,391 --> 02:14:36,391
like I'm fucking.
No one's more fascinated by predatory 

3303
02:14:36,391 --> 02:14:39,681
animals than me.
And when a dude who fucks with animals 

3304
02:14:39,681 --> 02:14:40,090
his entire career,
look it.

3305
02:14:41,130 --> 02:14:44,310
When a guy like that fucking gets killed
by an animal,

3306
02:14:44,430 --> 02:14:49,430
I mean there's a,
there's a fucking wealth of material 

3307
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:49,430
there.

3308
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:51,510
I said in earlier in Australia,
I said before he died,

3309
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:53,160
uh,
I watched the show.

3310
02:14:53,190 --> 02:14:54,170
I go,
I mean,

3311
02:14:54,230 --> 02:14:56,060
they all think America loves the 
crocodile hunter.

3312
02:14:56,110 --> 02:14:58,530
They think we all do,
but it wasn't like,

3313
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:00,690
because they're not as into them as we 
are.

3314
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:01,530
Really.
No,

3315
02:15:01,531 --> 02:15:06,531
not at all.
They all kind of think he's a freak and 

3316
02:15:06,531 --> 02:15:08,841
they're not that australians have a 
thing about australians who become 

3317
02:15:08,841 --> 02:15:09,660
famous somewhere else.
It's called tall poppy syndrome.

3318
02:15:09,690 --> 02:15:10,320
They,
uh,

3319
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:15,680
they try to cut down the tall flower you
because jeffrey's was pissed because he 

3320
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:17,130
would go back to Australia and people 
wouldn't buy tickets to a show,

3321
02:15:17,380 --> 02:15:17,880
you know?
He's like,

3322
02:15:17,881 --> 02:15:20,780
I've got a fucking.
Hbo is bash it.

3323
02:15:20,990 --> 02:15:22,070
It's my worst.
Jeffrey,

3324
02:15:23,190 --> 02:15:25,080
he doesn't have a lot to complain about 
right now.

3325
02:15:25,081 --> 02:15:27,410
Things are going great,
but the eye,

3326
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:29,070
my joke was,
I'm watching the show.

3327
02:15:29,130 --> 02:15:34,130
I go,
I admit I watch the show and I watch it 

3328
02:15:34,130 --> 02:15:34,130
every day.

3329
02:15:34,130 --> 02:15:35,550
Hoping every day will be that day since 
it's gonna happen,

3330
02:15:35,710 --> 02:15:37,410
you know,
you put your head in fucking crocodile's

3331
02:15:37,420 --> 02:15:42,420
mouth now.
And then when he died it was like a 

3332
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:42,420
funny joke.
Everyone used to laugh at it.

3333
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:43,770
Then when he died,
my,

3334
02:15:44,130 --> 02:15:46,110
my agent over in Australia call me,
he goes,

3335
02:15:46,111 --> 02:15:46,970
mate,
you're fucked.

3336
02:15:46,980 --> 02:15:47,430
I go,
what?

3337
02:15:47,431 --> 02:15:49,800
He goes,
they're playing your clip on the radio.

3338
02:15:50,190 --> 02:15:52,230
And I was like,
oh no.

3339
02:15:52,470 --> 02:15:57,470
So they were playing it like these two,
like a discharge djs were playing at 

3340
02:15:57,470 --> 02:16:01,641
this one station.
They thought it was kind of funny just 

3341
02:16:01,641 --> 02:16:01,641
playing my bid over and over.
So I got.

3342
02:16:01,641 --> 02:16:01,710
I thought,
oh,

3343
02:16:01,711 --> 02:16:04,050
this is fucking.
I'm dead in America.

3344
02:16:04,051 --> 02:16:04,680
You know,
I would have been,

3345
02:16:04,681 --> 02:16:06,870
had gone into hiding.
Yeah,

3346
02:16:07,490 --> 02:16:08,580
me like,
mate,

3347
02:16:08,581 --> 02:16:10,620
you're fucking,
you're fucking champion.

3348
02:16:10,630 --> 02:16:12,930
May hilarious.
And I was like,

3349
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:15,990
I want to go to Australia more.
These guys are fucking cool fun man.

3350
02:16:15,991 --> 02:16:20,991
You know what?
I love the color legend champion and a 

3351
02:16:20,991 --> 02:16:21,390
legend that sit in england all the time.
Your legend,

3352
02:16:21,710 --> 02:16:23,610
the legend.
Your legend mate.

3353
02:16:24,090 --> 02:16:25,020
Alright,
speaking of legend,

3354
02:16:25,021 --> 02:16:26,100
before we get out of here,
I got it.

3355
02:16:26,101 --> 02:16:31,101
I found the bill o'reilly thing and I 
got to read it because it's so 

3356
02:16:31,101 --> 02:16:31,101
ridiculous.

3357
02:16:31,101 --> 02:16:31,750
Then when everything about bill 
o'reilly,

3358
02:16:31,751 --> 02:16:34,720
no matter what you think about his 
opinions,

3359
02:16:34,990 --> 02:16:37,150
this is what you need to know and this 
is some,

3360
02:16:37,180 --> 02:16:40,240
some fucking voicemail that he left from
some woman.

3361
02:16:40,510 --> 02:16:45,510
Her name was andrea charisse and she 
sued him for sexual harassment and this 

3362
02:16:45,821 --> 02:16:49,000
is what he goes.
You would basically be in the shower and

3363
02:16:49,001 --> 02:16:54,001
then I would come in and you would have 
your back to me and I would take the 

3364
02:16:54,001 --> 02:16:55,210
loofa thing and kind of soap up your 
back,

3365
02:16:55,330 --> 02:16:59,230
rub it all over you,
get you to relax hot water and um,

3366
02:16:59,350 --> 02:17:04,350
you know,
you'd feel the tension drain out of you 

3367
02:17:04,350 --> 02:17:06,730
and you'd still be with your back to me.
And then I would kind of put my arm.

3368
02:17:07,060 --> 02:17:09,010
It's one of those myths,
one of those loofa mints,

3369
02:17:09,011 --> 02:17:14,011
you know,
so I got my hand in it and I would put 

3370
02:17:14,011 --> 02:17:14,011
it around in front,
kind of rubbed your,

3371
02:17:14,011 --> 02:17:18,361
tell me a little bit within and then my 
other hand would start to massage your 

3372
02:17:18,361 --> 02:17:22,080
boobs,
get your nipples really hard because I 

3373
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:22,080
like that.

3374
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:23,620
And you have really spectacular boobs.
So anyway,

3375
02:17:23,710 --> 02:17:27,010
I'd be rubbing your big boobs and 
getting your nipples really hard,

3376
02:17:27,011 --> 02:17:31,130
kind of kissing your neck from behind.
And then the other right?

3377
02:17:31,420 --> 02:17:36,420
Yes it is.
And then I would take the other hand 

3378
02:17:36,420 --> 02:17:37,820
with the falafel thing,
the falafels.

3379
02:17:37,830 --> 02:17:40,980
I don't know what that means and just 
put it on your pussy and.

3380
02:17:41,110 --> 02:17:46,000
But you'd have to do it real light,
just kind of a tease business.

3381
02:17:46,270 --> 02:17:49,750
What a fucking goofy like any chick is 
going to hear that and go,

3382
02:17:49,751 --> 02:17:54,751
oh yeah,
I was just thinking it was going to get 

3383
02:17:54,751 --> 02:17:56,950
off on this shit.
Old broken people trying to romance her.

3384
02:17:57,670 --> 02:17:58,960
I'm like,
can I choke you?

3385
02:17:58,961 --> 02:18:03,500
And delirious jewish food.
Falafel apples.

3386
02:18:03,520 --> 02:18:04,240
Yeah,
middle eastern food.

3387
02:18:04,241 --> 02:18:09,241
But I don't think that's what he meant 
was sloppy with some hummus and falafel 

3388
02:18:09,241 --> 02:18:09,680
thing and that's not what you meant.
Chefs and cheap phase up here.

3389
02:18:09,810 --> 02:18:12,100
You just used the wrong word.
Maybe I dunno,

3390
02:18:12,370 --> 02:18:17,370
but that's it.
Understand that this is the kind of 

3391
02:18:17,370 --> 02:18:17,470
human being you're dealing with and all 
this shit that you see on the fucking in

3392
02:18:17,471 --> 02:18:18,910
the public guys.
Just nonsense.

3393
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:20,680
You know?
It's just what we said before,

3394
02:18:20,681 --> 02:18:25,681
that people,
when they become famous and they get 

3395
02:18:25,681 --> 02:18:25,681
adulation,
they start all of a sudden believing the

3396
02:18:25,681 --> 02:18:26,860
bullshit.
They believe their own hype.

3397
02:18:27,190 --> 02:18:31,300
It's step one to to losing it all like r
kelly and it's fuckin xuesong.

3398
02:18:31,330 --> 02:18:31,960
You got that bitch.

3399
02:18:32,050 --> 02:18:33,100
Yeah.
You want to play at the end.

3400
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:35,130
We can cut it out the very end.
Yeah,

3401
02:18:35,250 --> 02:18:40,250
let's cue it up.
Cue it up and we'll play it at the very 

3402
02:18:40,250 --> 02:18:40,250
end.
Do you know the angelica houston?

3403
02:18:40,250 --> 02:18:40,480
I think he heard that.
Said it.

3404
02:18:40,510 --> 02:18:41,200
She goes,
uh,

3405
02:18:41,620 --> 02:18:43,870
uh,
I go by the motto.

3406
02:18:43,871 --> 02:18:45,580
Never pick it up.
Never put it down.

3407
02:18:46,030 --> 02:18:47,650
Like,
if you don't take the adulation,

3408
02:18:47,710 --> 02:18:50,350
you can't take the criticism,
like focus on yourself.

3409
02:18:50,351 --> 02:18:52,330
Don't focus on like what other people 
say.

3410
02:18:52,510 --> 02:18:55,390
And I try to do that because if I can 
get on people,

3411
02:18:55,550 --> 02:18:57,040
but when you walk out of a show and 
people,

3412
02:18:57,041 --> 02:18:57,910
you're great,
you're great.

3413
02:18:57,940 --> 02:19:02,940
What do you know?
That's just your opinion because you're 

3414
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:02,940
going to hear you suck too.
Right?

3415
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:04,060
And so that way I don't take the.
You're great.

3416
02:19:04,061 --> 02:19:04,630
You're,
I just go.

3417
02:19:04,631 --> 02:19:09,631
Oh thanks.
But I don't let it soak in because 

3418
02:19:09,631 --> 02:19:09,631
otherwise

3419
02:19:09,631 --> 02:19:10,020
what I like,
I like hearing we had a great time.

3420
02:19:10,980 --> 02:19:12,420
I don't want to hear your great.
I mean,

3421
02:19:12,421 --> 02:19:13,860
if you think that.
Thank you very much.

3422
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:14,880
Um,
I'm trying,

3423
02:19:14,881 --> 02:19:16,470
I'm working hard.
Keep going.

3424
02:19:16,471 --> 02:19:19,560
I do it all for whoever likes to see the
comedy.

3425
02:19:19,561 --> 02:19:22,110
That's what I'm doing it for.
I mean that's you,

3426
02:19:22,170 --> 02:19:22,980
I think you,
you,

3427
02:19:23,010 --> 02:19:26,790
you alter your motivation as you get 
older and as you get more successful and

3428
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:29,540
as you kind of get a better 
understanding of what you're doing.

3429
02:19:29,541 --> 02:19:34,541
Like as an artist.
And I think initially I just wanted to 

3430
02:19:34,541 --> 02:19:34,541
get laughs.
I just wanted to,

3431
02:19:34,541 --> 02:19:38,380
for me,
I wanted to prove that I could be good 

3432
02:19:38,380 --> 02:19:38,380
at this.
I wanted to get some success.

3433
02:19:38,380 --> 02:19:38,380
I wanted it,
I wanted to do it for me.

3434
02:19:38,420 --> 02:19:40,130
But then once you get the success,
then it has.

3435
02:19:40,190 --> 02:19:41,780
You have to change your,
your,

3436
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:46,430
your rational or your um,
rather your motivation has to change and

3437
02:19:46,431 --> 02:19:51,431
it has to become,
in order to stay good and to stay 

3438
02:19:51,431 --> 02:19:52,280
relevant you have to,
it has to become about the art.

3439
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:54,530
You have to be obsessed with creating 
good stuff.

3440
02:19:54,531 --> 02:19:59,531
You have to be obsessed with doing 
something that people are going to 

3441
02:19:59,531 --> 02:20:01,931
enjoy.
Those pops of brilliance when a new bit 

3442
02:20:01,931 --> 02:20:01,931
comes to light in.
Did you go through a change though?

3443
02:20:01,931 --> 02:20:04,070
Because I remember like when I watched 
you when I was younger and I was like,

3444
02:20:04,071 --> 02:20:07,930
oh I liked you because at that point in 
my life I was into like island here,

3445
02:20:07,940 --> 02:20:11,840
like tits and ass and fucking pussy and 
that's to me you were that kind of comic

3446
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:16,700
and evening at the improv was guys with 
their sleeves rolled up going what's the

3447
02:20:16,701 --> 02:20:18,230
deal with and you,
you're gone,

3448
02:20:18,231 --> 02:20:23,231
you know,
fuck that pussy and a while I was a 

3449
02:20:23,231 --> 02:20:25,631
savage.
And then you think about how I got into 

3450
02:20:25,631 --> 02:20:25,631
standup comedy.
I was a fucking kickbox.

3451
02:20:25,631 --> 02:20:29,350
But then you changed.
Now you do this kind of intellectual 

3452
02:20:29,350 --> 02:20:29,450
type material that's like,
you know,

3453
02:20:29,451 --> 02:20:30,800
like what you talked about now.

3454
02:20:30,920 --> 02:20:33,380
Well when I was 21,
I'm still have a million dick jokes.

3455
02:20:33,381 --> 02:20:36,650
But when I was 21 I had nothing to say 
about anything else.

3456
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:39,710
I had no opinions.
I had no opinions on society.

3457
02:20:39,820 --> 02:20:44,820
I had no opinions on life.
I didn't think about religion at all 

3458
02:20:44,820 --> 02:20:45,710
except it scared me because I went to 
catholic school when I was little.

3459
02:20:45,770 --> 02:20:48,200
All I thought about when I was 21 and 
was pussy,

3460
02:20:48,470 --> 02:20:52,370
that is all I was a fucking savage.
That's all I thought about.

3461
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:57,520
I was here.
I was a former martial arts teacher and 

3462
02:20:57,520 --> 02:21:01,241
fighter who is now a professional comic 
and I was making my living working in 

3463
02:21:01,241 --> 02:21:02,510
bars and doing standup and trying to 
make girls like me.

3464
02:21:02,570 --> 02:21:03,630
I mean that's what I was doing.
Yeah.

3465
02:21:03,660 --> 02:21:05,420
And all I was obsessed with.
Yeah.

3466
02:21:05,421 --> 02:21:10,421
And all I was obsessed with was fucking.
And people would say that to me like 

3467
02:21:10,421 --> 02:21:10,820
your act is all about sex and is your 
act all about sex?

3468
02:21:11,070 --> 02:21:16,070
Um,
because I'm fucking 22 and my hormones 

3469
02:21:16,070 --> 02:21:17,860
are blasting inside of my body,
like a broken fire hydrant,

3470
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:21,290
slamming against the walls of my heart.
Like what are you talking about?

3471
02:21:21,410 --> 02:21:23,090
That's all I'm thinking about.
I don't know.

3472
02:21:23,091 --> 02:21:25,160
Anything else?
I had no opinions.

3473
02:21:25,161 --> 02:21:28,160
I could say sex jokes onstage and people
could laugh.

3474
02:21:28,161 --> 02:21:28,790
You know?
Why?

3475
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:31,040
Because these are things that I was 
actually thinking about.

3476
02:21:31,041 --> 02:21:33,830
So I had actual humorous points of view 
on it and people would say,

3477
02:21:33,831 --> 02:21:35,030
well,
you're acting so dirty.

3478
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:37,880
Well,
am I supposed to not talk about what I'm

3479
02:21:37,881 --> 02:21:40,130
obsessed with?
Should I talk about what you're obsessed

3480
02:21:40,131 --> 02:21:40,540
with?
I,

3481
02:21:40,541 --> 02:21:44,270
I guess I should have balanced.
It did go through a long time where,

3482
02:21:44,510 --> 02:21:49,510
you know,
especially if I do like a half an hour 

3483
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:49,510
set,
it was too much.

3484
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:49,510
Sex talk was like,
it was like enough already,

3485
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:49,510
dude,
you knew me,

3486
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:51,290
you must have something else,
you know,

3487
02:21:51,291 --> 02:21:53,300
how many come shot jokes can you have,
you know,

3488
02:21:53,301 --> 02:21:56,270
but it's,
as I got older then I started,

3489
02:21:56,300 --> 02:21:58,580
you know,
looking at the world and you know,

3490
02:21:58,820 --> 02:22:03,820
then you know,
actually thinking about things and then 

3491
02:22:03,820 --> 02:22:06,520
actually forming opinions and you know,
and it can deeply considering those 

3492
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:07,310
opinions before I ever thought about 
taking them to the stage.

3493
02:22:07,490 --> 02:22:12,490
And then I had opinions about things for
years and years before I ever tried to 

3494
02:22:12,490 --> 02:22:15,851
like put them in a humorous situation.
It's just a matter of developing as a 

3495
02:22:15,851 --> 02:22:17,090
human being.
But you know,

3496
02:22:17,180 --> 02:22:20,000
as your motivation changes and as your 
perception changes,

3497
02:22:20,001 --> 02:22:20,570
I mean it's just,
you,

3498
02:22:20,571 --> 02:22:22,070
you just mature,
you grow,

3499
02:22:22,071 --> 02:22:24,200
you think about things differently.
But as your audience,

3500
02:22:24,201 --> 02:22:24,860
your,
your,

3501
02:22:24,910 --> 02:22:26,190
your ufc audience,

3502
02:22:26,190 --> 02:22:29,250
the guys that are like mma guys and like
that kind of stuff,

3503
02:22:29,550 --> 02:22:33,070
are they on the same mindset as you now 
with your customers

3504
02:22:33,170 --> 02:22:34,640
cereal?
Or you'd be amazed,

3505
02:22:34,730 --> 02:22:37,430
first of all about ufc fans.
The first of all,

3506
02:22:37,431 --> 02:22:42,431
the broad spectrum of fence.
There's some fucking brilliant 

3507
02:22:42,431 --> 02:22:46,001
intelligent ufc fans.
I've met some people in the mixed 

3508
02:22:46,001 --> 02:22:49,211
martial arts business,
whether they're trainers or competitors 

3509
02:22:49,211 --> 02:22:49,300
or you know,
people who just do it,

3510
02:22:49,301 --> 02:22:54,301
you know,
as a hobby or involved in a management 

3511
02:22:54,301 --> 02:22:57,101
aspect.
Fucking brilliant people who are huge 

3512
02:22:57,101 --> 02:22:57,101
fans of the sport,
you know,

3513
02:22:57,101 --> 02:22:58,760
I met a bunch of them are really like 
the guys who own the ufc there.

3514
02:22:58,761 --> 02:23:00,350
Fucking smart people,
man.

3515
02:23:00,820 --> 02:23:05,820
They're not caveman.
I mean dana white's crazy and he swears 

3516
02:23:05,820 --> 02:23:06,320
a lot stuff,
but he's a fucking really introspective,

3517
02:23:06,321 --> 02:23:09,320
like a very considerate and 
compassionate person.

3518
02:23:09,321 --> 02:23:12,440
Like these guys like dana white recently
saved some Thailand girl.

3519
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:13,730
There was a girl who needed to,
like,

3520
02:23:13,880 --> 02:23:18,880
I believe it was liver surgery and she,
she was the daughter of a trainer at 

3521
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:18,880
tiger moitai.

3522
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:23,560
Somebody put a thread about it on the 
underground and this girl is going to 

3523
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:23,900
die unless she gets this surgery within 
the next eight weeks.

3524
02:23:23,930 --> 02:23:26,210
Dana white fucking paid for all of it.
You know,

3525
02:23:26,240 --> 02:23:27,860
he's like one of those guys.
He's not an asshole.

3526
02:23:27,861 --> 02:23:28,790
He's not a meathead,
you know,

3527
02:23:28,791 --> 02:23:30,770
he's a.
He's a really good dude.

3528
02:23:30,790 --> 02:23:32,450
Well I guess people that,
you know,

3529
02:23:32,451 --> 02:23:34,880
everybody looks at like cage fighting 
fans and they think,

3530
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:40,020
oh,
they must be assholes with skulls on 

3531
02:23:40,020 --> 02:23:40,020
their shirts.
A lot of them are,

3532
02:23:40,020 --> 02:23:41,870
but a lot of martin and even in the 
assholes with skulls and their shots,

3533
02:23:42,020 --> 02:23:43,670
they can be lead.
They can all be.

3534
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:46,310
Everybody can look at things in a more 
compact,

3535
02:23:46,330 --> 02:23:47,260
more fun,
friendly.

3536
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:52,280
Well I'd imagine that like cage fighters
to themselves or kind of perfectionist 

3537
02:23:52,280 --> 02:23:52,800
kind of guys.
And then like,

3538
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:54,930
what was that thing?
I texted you one day and asked you about

3539
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:58,840
the quote about if you can do one thing,
well you can do me a moto massage you.

3540
02:23:58,841 --> 02:24:03,841
That's why I got this tattoo.
See that shit is because I find sashi 

3541
02:24:03,841 --> 02:24:07,221
versus a tiger like those that I do that
crossfit stuff and all the guys I do 

3542
02:24:07,221 --> 02:24:10,300
crossfit with our obsessive compulsive 
and very intellectual,

3543
02:24:10,301 --> 02:24:15,301
uh,
you find these guys are great athletes 

3544
02:24:15,301 --> 02:24:15,301
and you would think they're just dumb 
fucking,

3545
02:24:15,301 --> 02:24:16,140
you know,
can climb a rope and fucking power lift,

3546
02:24:16,141 --> 02:24:17,850
you know,
deadlift 500 pounds,

3547
02:24:18,210 --> 02:24:23,210
but you start finding out they know 
everything about nutrition and then 

3548
02:24:23,210 --> 02:24:24,350
everything about this and then it goes 
to supplant transcendent.

3549
02:24:24,390 --> 02:24:26,040
People are not disciplined,
right?

3550
02:24:26,190 --> 02:24:29,420
Dumb people can work hard if they're 
like in a football camp and the coach is

3551
02:24:29,430 --> 02:24:31,800
screaming at you every day or you know,
if you have to,

3552
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:37,000
you know,
what you're in the army or something 

3553
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:37,000
like that.

3554
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:38,810
But when you have to motivate yourself 
to go to the gym and you have to 

3555
02:24:38,810 --> 02:24:39,960
motivate yourself to buy the proper 
nutrition and that takes intelligence,

3556
02:24:39,961 --> 02:24:41,550
it takes a certain amount of discipline.
Yeah.

3557
02:24:41,551 --> 02:24:43,610
So I've seen that these mixed martial 
arts I've said,

3558
02:24:43,650 --> 02:24:46,100
because I would say that them,
the guys that,

3559
02:24:46,140 --> 02:24:51,140
that do fight and are really into it are
probably good fans that really get all 

3560
02:24:51,140 --> 02:24:53,580
your material and,
and get into like the intellectual shit.

3561
02:24:53,581 --> 02:24:56,820
But I'm thinking like the average guy,
wwf foam and goes,

3562
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,720
hey,
I just want to see some broken blood.

3563
02:25:00,430 --> 02:25:02,340
This.
Does he come to your show and be like,

3564
02:25:02,341 --> 02:25:03,390
don't be a dick joke.

3565
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:05,250
There's that.
But you know what man,

3566
02:25:05,251 --> 02:25:08,250
I,
I make sure I try very hard to make sure

3567
02:25:08,251 --> 02:25:10,350
that my jokes are first and foremost 
funny.

3568
02:25:10,580 --> 02:25:15,580
You know,
whatever my point of view is on 

3569
02:25:15,580 --> 02:25:15,580
something.
It has to be,

3570
02:25:15,580 --> 02:25:16,650
it has to be digestible to a lot of 
people.

3571
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:18,450
But there's some weird shit that I might
think.

3572
02:25:18,451 --> 02:25:19,900
It's funny that if I had an audience 
audience filled

3573
02:25:19,900 --> 02:25:20,240
with,
you know,

3574
02:25:20,590 --> 02:25:23,950
only like guys like you or dunk in or 
you know,

3575
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:25,930
someone who's like a very smart person 
that's,

3576
02:25:25,931 --> 02:25:27,040
you know,
of a certain age.

3577
02:25:27,041 --> 02:25:30,150
I could talk to about almost anything I 
would do different materials.

3578
02:25:30,420 --> 02:25:31,750
It was just you guys,
you know,

3579
02:25:31,930 --> 02:25:34,270
but to an audience full of a bunch of 
people.

3580
02:25:34,271 --> 02:25:35,710
First of all,
I want everybody to have fun.

3581
02:25:35,980 --> 02:25:36,640
You know,
I want,

3582
02:25:36,641 --> 02:25:38,860
I want like a,
a julius fun,

3583
02:25:38,861 --> 02:25:40,720
festive atmosphere.
I want,

3584
02:25:40,721 --> 02:25:43,690
I want,
I wanted to be like an hour long party,

3585
02:25:43,990 --> 02:25:48,990
you know,
and the party filled with ideas and 

3586
02:25:48,990 --> 02:25:50,560
thoughts and then you know that I'm not 
coming from coming from a place of ego.

3587
02:25:50,561 --> 02:25:51,890
I'm not a egomania I'm,
I'm,

3588
02:25:52,020 --> 02:25:54,040
I'm calling for a place to just,
let's just figure this out.

3589
02:25:54,041 --> 02:25:55,750
Let's try to put this all together.
It's not me,

3590
02:25:55,751 --> 02:25:57,970
it's not about me.
It's about these ideas.

3591
02:25:57,971 --> 02:26:00,910
It's about fun.
It's about having a good goddamn time up

3592
02:26:00,911 --> 02:26:01,180
there.

3593
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:04,240
So it's the ideas.
But I've got a lot of weird shit.

3594
02:26:04,241 --> 02:26:07,530
My act about time travel and the large 
hadron collider and there's like,

3595
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:09,570
there's some shit that,
there's some songs.

3596
02:26:09,610 --> 02:26:11,350
Sometimes when I'm on stage I go,
god damn,

3597
02:26:11,351 --> 02:26:13,960
I'm taking these motherfuckers don't 
fucking twisty road here.

3598
02:26:13,961 --> 02:26:18,961
I hope there with me no hope there with 
me when the punchlines come because 

3599
02:26:18,961 --> 02:26:18,961
there might've been like,
you know,

3600
02:26:18,961 --> 02:26:21,290
after five minutes of large hadron 
collider rant when I get to the end,

3601
02:26:21,291 --> 02:26:23,140
they're like,
what the fuck is he talking about?

3602
02:26:23,480 --> 02:26:24,850
You know,
people are taking notes.

3603
02:26:24,851 --> 02:26:26,740
I better go home and read about this 
shit.

3604
02:26:26,830 --> 02:26:27,450
I think,
you know,

3605
02:26:27,460 --> 02:26:31,360
I initially I sort of,
you know,

3606
02:26:31,361 --> 02:26:36,361
did comedy just to try to get labs and 
this is what I always say that there's 

3607
02:26:36,361 --> 02:26:36,361
like a bunch of different stages of 
comedy.

3608
02:26:36,361 --> 02:26:38,920
I think the first age that you do 
anything you can to get a laugh,

3609
02:26:39,100 --> 02:26:39,550
you know,
I mean,

3610
02:26:39,580 --> 02:26:44,580
I'm sure you've said that some hacky 
lines in your life that you're not lost 

3611
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:44,580
about.

3612
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:48,130
I mean I look back the last time,
I think in 1997 or 90.

3613
02:26:48,250 --> 02:26:50,120
No earlier than that.
I was on newsradio though.

3614
02:26:50,121 --> 02:26:51,190
It was like 95,
96.

3615
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:52,630
I told some woman,
hey,

3616
02:26:52,631 --> 02:26:54,520
I don't come to your job and slap the 
dicks out of your mouth.

3617
02:26:54,700 --> 02:26:58,660
I can't believe I still use that.
Like in 90 I used it one time.

3618
02:26:58,690 --> 02:27:01,750
It was in montreal at the comedy works.
Some chick said something right after.

3619
02:27:01,751 --> 02:27:02,230
I said,
I'm like,

3620
02:27:02,231 --> 02:27:03,220
man,
really?

3621
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:07,450
You didn't even dig into your bag.
You just grabbed the most obvious stupid

3622
02:27:07,451 --> 02:27:09,550
hacky law.
I still think about that to this day.

3623
02:27:09,880 --> 02:27:14,880
You know?
I think initially you're just trying to 

3624
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:17,551
get laughs and then once you get good 
then it goes from what makes me laugh,

3625
02:27:17,800 --> 02:27:22,800
you know?
Instead of just trying to make anybody 

3626
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:22,800
laugh with like a tool,
like I have a hammer,

3627
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:23,230
look at my hammer,
I'm going to hit the nail dong.

3628
02:27:23,410 --> 02:27:26,290
Then it becomes your perspective.
It's like becomes,

3629
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:27,570
you know,
this is that,

3630
02:27:27,580 --> 02:27:32,580
this actually is funny to me,
and then it becomes how do you make 

3631
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:32,860
someone laugh with your opinions on 
things like what,

3632
02:27:32,870 --> 02:27:37,870
what are your unique points of view that
you can somehow or another turn into 

3633
02:27:37,870 --> 02:27:41,761
comedy.
So to me there's like been three stages 

3634
02:27:41,761 --> 02:27:41,890
in my life.
The first stage was just say anything.

3635
02:27:42,010 --> 02:27:44,980
Even if you didn't believe in it.
I said a lot of stupid shit about,

3636
02:27:45,220 --> 02:27:47,560
about gay people,
about whatever the fuck I was,

3637
02:27:47,620 --> 02:27:49,180
if I thought it would work,
you know,

3638
02:27:49,181 --> 02:27:50,740
to me it was like,
is this a brick?

3639
02:27:50,770 --> 02:27:52,990
Can I kill a rat with it?
Let's kill her at,

3640
02:27:53,020 --> 02:27:54,600
you know,
it was just a tool.

3641
02:27:54,670 --> 02:27:56,770
I think I followed your model and I'm 
just,

3642
02:27:56,850 --> 02:28:01,850
you know,
years behind you doing the same thing 

3643
02:28:01,850 --> 02:28:01,850
where it's the analogy,
good analogy.

3644
02:28:01,850 --> 02:28:03,190
Hired was golf.
They said when you learn to golf,

3645
02:28:03,550 --> 02:28:08,550
just fucking hit the ball as far as you 
can fucking hit it and then hone your 

3646
02:28:08,550 --> 02:28:11,500
swing and bring it in instead of trying 
to hit it right.

3647
02:28:11,530 --> 02:28:14,950
And then trying to hit it far so like 
try to kill it first.

3648
02:28:15,540 --> 02:28:20,540
Try to learn how to kill and once you 
kill you'll get all that confidence and 

3649
02:28:20,540 --> 02:28:22,220
you'll never be scared and then hone it 
in the good,

3650
02:28:22,370 --> 02:28:23,780
you know,
really creative,

3651
02:28:23,781 --> 02:28:25,850
interesting jokes with your point of 
view.

3652
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:27,890
But you can't go out there initially 
with that.

3653
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:30,010
Some guys probably have,
they try,

3654
02:28:30,011 --> 02:28:35,011
but they seem so pretentious and 
especially when you're 20 and you're 

3655
02:28:35,011 --> 02:28:35,480
breaking down the government police shut
the fuck up.

3656
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:37,880
Yeah,
please go get hit in the head by a ball,

3657
02:28:38,030 --> 02:28:39,530
you know,
please get punched.

3658
02:28:39,620 --> 02:28:40,090
You know,
go,

3659
02:28:40,130 --> 02:28:45,130
go do something.
We develop some character to talk about 

3660
02:28:45,130 --> 02:28:45,130
this off air.
Someone who does that.

3661
02:28:45,130 --> 02:28:46,650
Right.
I'm sure there's a lot of people will do

3662
02:28:46,651 --> 02:28:47,190
it.
Just,

3663
02:28:47,470 --> 02:28:48,770
you know,
you want to be somebody,

3664
02:28:48,771 --> 02:28:49,430
man.
You want to be.

3665
02:28:49,431 --> 02:28:54,431
Bill hicks,
you know is a great fucking lana 

3666
02:28:54,431 --> 02:28:57,130
punchline.
One of the great clubs you ever worked 

3667
02:28:57,130 --> 02:28:57,130
there.
One of the best jobs on country.

3668
02:28:57,130 --> 02:28:57,130
Fucking fantastic club.
Anyway,

3669
02:28:57,130 --> 02:28:59,270
the atlanta punchline has a,
a back room,

3670
02:28:59,271 --> 02:29:04,271
like a green room and it's got a bunch 
of shit written on the wall and one 

3671
02:29:04,271 --> 02:29:07,511
thing that I took a picture of a,
put it on my mobile log back when I had 

3672
02:29:07,511 --> 02:29:07,511
a mobile log.

3673
02:29:07,511 --> 02:29:07,670
I've got to find it.
It must be on my.

3674
02:29:07,780 --> 02:29:11,450
It said it's quit trying to be hicks 
fragment.

3675
02:29:11,500 --> 02:29:12,880
You started the at friend.
Oh,

3676

Well go check that shit up.

3677
02:29:14,631 --> 02:29:16,880
It's just check this out,

3678
02:29:17,110 --> 02:29:20,480
read pancake,
pancake.net.

3679
02:29:20,510 --> 02:29:23,420
I don't think I need to see that,
but don't go to red pancake.net.

3680
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:26,570
It's some sort of horrible venereal 
diseases and poor fuck has.

3681
02:29:26,571 --> 02:29:29,080
And brian wants you to look at it.
Eddie f dot.

3682
02:29:29,090 --> 02:29:32,540
Where are you going to be next man?
I am in Australia.

3683
02:29:32,690 --> 02:29:34,340
Pretty much all a.
Yeah,

3684
02:29:34,341 --> 02:29:39,341
I got it.
We got a lot of australian people that 

3685
02:29:39,341 --> 02:29:40,841
listen to the show.
So tell us where I'm doing the adelaide 

3686
02:29:40,841 --> 02:29:43,601
fringe festival.
I'll be at the arts theater for 10 

3687
02:29:43,601 --> 02:29:47,231
nights only.
And then I'm doing brisbane only 10 

3688
02:29:47,231 --> 02:29:47,231
nights in a row.
Jesus christ.

3689
02:29:47,231 --> 02:29:48,320
I've never done 10 nights anywhere.
That's incredible.

3690
02:29:48,340 --> 02:29:48,680
Okay,
cool.

3691
02:29:48,740 --> 02:29:50,930
Four hundred 50 seats.
So start buying tickets.

3692
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:53,870
Holy shit.
And then unpack places in Australia.

3693
02:29:53,871 --> 02:29:55,370
Huh?
It's going well.

3694
02:29:55,390 --> 02:30:00,390
I'm really happy.
Is that weird to be super famous in 

3695
02:30:00,390 --> 02:30:00,390
another country?
I'm not super famous at all.

3696
02:30:00,390 --> 02:30:01,340
I mean are just super famous.
I'm at.

3697
02:30:01,350 --> 02:30:04,340
I'm happy with how it's going,
but I would like to see the same.

3698
02:30:04,430 --> 02:30:09,430
I told you yesterday I go,
it's not like I love Australia to great 

3699
02:30:09,430 --> 02:30:09,800
fucking place.
I love to serve,

3700
02:30:09,801 --> 02:30:11,460
but you want to do the same thing here.
They just,

3701
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:16,480
you know,
I like being around my family and I 

3702
02:30:16,480 --> 02:30:16,480
want.
My parents did not think I'm a failure.

3703
02:30:16,480 --> 02:30:17,390
Holla at your boy.
So,

3704
02:30:17,391 --> 02:30:18,230
um,
what is your website?

3705
02:30:18,390 --> 02:30:19,310

3708
02:30:24,890 --> 02:30:27,290
The facebook and facebook is easy to 
find.

3709
02:30:27,380 --> 02:30:29,900
And our podcast is talking shit.

3710
02:30:29,930 --> 02:30:31,040
Yeah.
And your podcast.

3711
02:30:31,041 --> 02:30:32,570
Is it backup now?
It's,

3712
02:30:32,660 --> 02:30:35,870
if you google you will find it.
You don't have to go through itunes.

3713
02:30:35,871 --> 02:30:38,120
Everybody thinks you have to go through.
So libsyn,

3714
02:30:38,570 --> 02:30:39,560
libsyn,
available.

3715
02:30:39,561 --> 02:30:44,561
No matter what.
All the episodes are available and you 

3716
02:30:44,561 --> 02:30:44,561
can get to libsyn,
I assume from eddie f.com.

3717
02:30:44,580 --> 02:30:46,520
And if you just took it down because of 
the name,

3718
02:30:46,640 --> 02:30:48,050
they took it down a title.
Yeah.

3719
02:30:48,090 --> 02:30:52,220
In the titles.
And we fucked up and took it down from,

3720
02:30:52,310 --> 02:30:57,310
I guess I have to eat this guy's cunt.
Well they should've taken a down for 

3721
02:30:57,310 --> 02:30:57,310
that.
Yeah,

3722
02:30:57,310 --> 02:30:59,810
we just do a podcast number one and he 
actually had it done and I just have the

3723
02:30:59,811 --> 02:31:00,860
guests,
I understand their thing,

3724
02:31:00,861 --> 02:31:05,861
trying to keep children away from 
explicit stuff and understand if we 

3725
02:31:05,861 --> 02:31:08,801
fucked up,
we fucked up and they have a filter 

3726
02:31:08,801 --> 02:31:10,601
though.
You think they would have some kind of 

3727
02:31:10,601 --> 02:31:11,360
say they do and that's what they did.
They bumped us off or breaking the rules

3728
02:31:11,361 --> 02:31:15,440
and we just didn't know.
And so they killed all your feed and now

3729
02:31:15,441 --> 02:31:17,390
you have to get a whole new feed.
Yeah,

02:31:17,391 --> 02:31:19,440
we're going to have to get a whole new 
feel all your subscribers.

You have 35,000

3732
02:31:20,700 --> 02:31:24,930

We're going to lose all our subscribers.

3768
02:32:41,491 --> 02:32:43,590
I'm getting some messages where people 
are saying it's sold out,

3769
02:32:43,591 --> 02:32:44,460

And exactly what we're talking about 

3779
02:33:11,991 --> 02:33:13,500
when it comes to a celebrity turning 
someone into a crazy person.
