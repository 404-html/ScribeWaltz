1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,570
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,501
What did you mean Brian?

3
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:03,334
Like what were you saying?

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:04,441
No,

5
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:06,900
I mean it's just like you're saying
about how bad the government is,

6
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:08,790
how many bad things they've done,

7
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,180
you know,

8
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:09,721
in the past.

9
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:12,060
But everyone never looks at the good shit,

10
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:12,361
you know?

11
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:14,940
And no one's ever looking at
all the good shit they do.

12
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,830
They're not going to
tell on the bad stuff.

13
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,570
I don't think that's
necessarily the Grand Canyon.

14
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:19,291
It's bad ass.

15
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,550
Did you ever read watership down?

16
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:21,960
Government didn't make the grand canyon,

17
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,660
bro Fucking Bust your bubble.

18
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,051
Hey,

19
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:25,801
will you do me a favor?

20
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:26,280
I know we're not

21
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,061
plus to play music,

22
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:28,350
but there's a song that we have to play.

23
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,950
We have to play because I really liked
the song and it's a super appropriate and

24
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:32,970
we'll just talk over it.

25
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:33,601
Okay.

26
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:34,640
We're not like selling it.

27
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,110
It's Aaron Lewis country boy.

28
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,700
You know the dude from stained.

29
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,330
Okay,

30
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,130
well he's reinvented himself as
a country music singer and yes,

31
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:44,311
yes,

32
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:44,461
yes.

33
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,170
I want you to think it's important.

34
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,040
It's really important.

35
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,660
It's really important for two reasons.

36
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:51,300
One because I honestly like this song.

37
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,290
I like the sound a lot.

38
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,101
I really do.

39
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:55,020
It's a fucking good song
and guys got a great voice.

40
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:55,840
I loved him and that,

41
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,880
that band stained,

42
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,190
I think he's a bad motherfucker.

43
00:00:59,210 --> 00:00:59,340
He's,

44
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,550
he's got a great voice and a apparel.

45
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,740
It's just so fascinating
because it's a super,

46
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:06,150
super patriotic song.

47
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,890
Let's hear it.

48
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:07,723
And it's,

49
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,210
it's so patriotic.

50
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:10,860
It's like almost like a parody.

51
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,030
Oh,

52
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,870
big toe from the beginning.

53
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:13,530
From the beginning.

54
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,363
Hit it from the beginning.

55
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,330
Here we go.

56
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,163
Ready?

57
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,850
It's about being a country boy

58
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,743
that's hearing.

59
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,930
We never play songs anymore,

60
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:23,610
but fuck it man.

61
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,473
I love this song.

62
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,330
No dirt around.

63
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,333
And

64
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,693
how do you know,

65
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:31,990
do the spin.

66
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,020
Listen how good his voice,

67
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:35,660
his 1500 bucks back in,

68
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,450
man.

69
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,300
I sound like a home.

70
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:38,061
I'll put down,

71
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:39,710
motherfuckers got a bad ass voice.

72
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,230
He could talk me in bed
at night with that voice.

73
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,813
Listen to this

74
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,523
man.

75
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,203
What is,

76
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,690
that's not the h wearing gray.

77
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,080
This is a great fucking song,

78
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:01,914
Dude.

79
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,040
Rarely drink smoke.

80
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,211
He has.

81
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:13,080
Don't tread on me.

82
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:14,400
Tattooed on his neck

83
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,240
tense.

84
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,580
That's intense right across his neck.

85
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:23,030
It says don't tread on me and this song
is talking about how he never leaves his

86
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:26,480
house without his nine or is 45
it's like sort of gangster rap.

87
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,060
Tried to know the word
for calm outlaw country.

88
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,260
Damn.

89
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,820
He sold his soul to the devil in La.

90
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,410
This is talking about when
he was in that other band.

91
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,173
Yeah,

92
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,830
set up shop

93
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,220
in fact spinal saying the devil hooked
him up in La with a like a regular guy

94
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,730
check ever see spinal tap.

95
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:53,061
He's like,

96
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:56,910
what he's doing is he's making up for
his time as a rockstar now remembering a

97
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,681
spinal tap.

98
00:02:57,681 --> 00:02:58,880
When they sit like that,

99
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,770
there's a great thing where it shows all
the pictures of the band and they tried

100
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:03,940
every demographic.

101
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:08,090
They kept changing demographics according
to what was popular and so like he

102
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:09,730
just swapped demographics,

103
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,250
countries,

104
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,190
publicists and was like,

105
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:12,641
hey listen.

106
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:13,240
I think,

107
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,580
I think the country
markets trying to be legit,

108
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:18,520
just like a gangster rappers trying to
be legit because in the video there's a

109
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:20,860
picture of him like get to holding a gun.

110
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,050
He's two and he's got a gun in his hand.

111
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:24,100
I am not bullshitting.

112
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:26,110
I bill it says me age too.

113
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:29,290
He's holding a gun and there's another
picture where he's got a large mouth

114
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:29,710
bass.

115
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,570
See I used a fish,

116
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,620
you know,

117
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,210
so it's like all these pictures of him.

118
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,690
All that shit is like so manipulative
and silly and not whole thing.

119
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:37,930
Man.

120
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,763
It gets way better.

121
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,550
I grew up on a country in a place,

122
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:46,000
you never know the last few seconds of it.

123
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:46,631
I'll tell you Brian,

124
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:48,760
exactly where to go
because it's so ridiculous.

125
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,983
It was one of my,

126
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,570
it's,

127
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:50,870
it's,

128
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,620
it's just really interesting cause
you know there's a miss hands.

129
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,840
No,

130
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,600
and it's way worse than Mr. Go
to four minutes and 14 seconds.

131
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,610
Go do at a four minutes and 14 seconds.

132
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:02,170
We'll just end this
because it's fascinating.

133
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:02,501
By the way,

134
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:05,500
I'm not dissing this guy at all and
I fucking love this music and I love,

135
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,630
I love his song and I
love that kind of music.

136
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:07,961
I like it.

137
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,130
A lot of Toby Keith Song,

138
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,301
I don't have anything wrong.

139
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:12,490
A patriotic songs at the end of it.

140
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:12,761
Listen,

141
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:15,970
this guy does this little speech
and this is like this old old dude

142
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:16,560
that's like,

143
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,393
I love my country.

144
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,930
I love my guns,

145
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,843
my family.

146
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,410
I love the way it is now.

147
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,070
And anybody that tried to change
it has to come through me.

148
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,780
I should be on our end.

149
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,650
It's this isn't America and a country
boy was good enough from Mason.

150
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,710
Okay,

151
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,040
play that back again because that
might be a terrorist message.

152
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:37,791
Okay.

153
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,710
That retarded fucking speech.

154
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:40,141
Back it up.

155
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:40,350
Right

156
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,030
listening,

157
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,863
listening.

158
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,400
Is that a bag?

159
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:47,234
Listen,

160
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,313
I love my country.

161
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,880
I love my guns,

162
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,773
my family.

163
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,340
I love the way it is now.

164
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,000
And anybody that tried to change
it has to come through me.

165
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,400
That's some music,

166
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,930
our attitude.

167
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,860
That should be all of our answers.

168
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,111
That's,

169
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:01,070
this is America.

170
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,520
And a contigo is good
enough to make sense.

171
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,810
And she boys getting enough for me like

Anybody else talk and he exactly.

that's what I sound like.

176
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,990
It's just so fucking stupid.

177
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,460
It's like a little more guns.

178
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,323

I love my family a lot more guns.

190
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,410
He brought a trash pick
those or they'll come to me.

191
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,281
Let's take a look.

192
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:37,690
I'm not saying I want to take your guns,

193
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:38,180
dude.

194
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,560
All right.

195
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,910
I don't want to talk about guns too.

196
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,050
I love my family too.

197
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:41,411
All right.

198
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:42,430
Settle the fuck down.

199
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,480
Every time in history,

200
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:43,990
Christ,

201
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,160

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,030

203
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:46,360
bro.

204
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,980
But every period in history,

205
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,300
he's got those human anchors desperately
trying to dig their claws into the

206
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,373
fucking,

207
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,740

evolution from happening.

208
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,620
Desperately fight.

00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,480
They'll kill for kill for it.

210
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,603
Inquisition.

211
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,400
What do you mean?

212
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,233
Wait a minute.

213
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,410
You can't be serious.

214
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:04,940
Do you everyone gather around?

215
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:06,410
Did you hear Galileo?

216
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,061

217
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:09,470

speak of not being on top.

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,540
I love my earth in the
center of the universe.

221
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,230

I don't need to ride any horses
need domesticated animals.

234
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,870
That's complicated.

235
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,190
Nobody wants to domesticate.

236
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,090
Horse has got to come through me.

237

240
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,170

241
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,640
Anybody wants to change that?

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,480
We've got to come through me.

243
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,190
