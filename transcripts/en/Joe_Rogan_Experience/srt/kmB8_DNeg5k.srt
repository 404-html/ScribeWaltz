00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,410
Hello freaks.
That's right.

of us,

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,890
Some of you out there will say,

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,830
Other ones.
This will be the first one for you.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,980
One day you'll get sick of me.
It happens.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,050
Everybody gets sick of everything folks,
you know,

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,780
eat meatloaf every day fucking tastes 
like shit,

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,020
but if you were lost in the woods and 
you hadn't seen meatloaf for months and 

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,750
you're living off frogs,
fucking pond water,

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,260
meatloaf would be awesome.

We're also brought to you by legalzoom 
and legal zoom.

45
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,100
Much like stamps.com
allows you to do a lot of shit from 

46
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,950
home.
That's what today's all about folks.

47
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,380
It's about saving time,
being convenient,

48
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,350
optimizing your,
your,

49
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,450
your minutes here on this earth and with
legal zoom allows you to do is do a lot 

50
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,760
of shit from home naked that you would 
have to do at a lawyers office.

51
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,320
You'd have to make an appointment,
go in there with clothes on.

52
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,150
You couldn't be drunk,
but you can be drunk and naked and still

53
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:59,151
do legal shit.
Like incorporate form an llc for just 

54
00:02:59,151 --> 00:03:03,261
99.
You can do a lot of things with legal 

55
00:03:03,261 --> 00:03:04,900
zoom that you would ordinarily have to 
make appointments for and spent a ton of

56
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,930
money.
It's a very easy and convenient service 

57
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,991
and if I correctly,
I believe you used it to incorporate on 

58
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:16,881
it.com
is that labs llc was formed originally 

59
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:19,891
by legalzoom.com.
If you're thinking about starting a 

60
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:21,070
business,
you can do that from legal zoom.

61
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:26,071
You can also protect your family with a 
last will for just 69 bucks or get a 

62
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:31,231
living trust power of attorney and more 
legal zoom gets the job right?

63
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:36,331
Nine out of 10 customers would recommend
the service to their friends and family 

64
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:39,970
and we all know that at least one out of
10 people is a fucking whiny bitch,

65
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,040
so that's basically.

66
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,470
It's awesome.
Nine out of 10 says it's awesome.

67
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,140
Nothing.
If Jesus came back today,

68
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,890
his youtube comments would be atrocious.
Okay?

69
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,260
No one rides for free in this world.
This world is overrun by cons were like 

70
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:56,950
rats on a boat.
Okay?

71
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:02,490
You get personalized,
affordable service that you can trust 

72
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,810
and that's why they earned an a plus 
from the better business bureau.

73
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,630
I'll say that again.
Legalzoom.com

74
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,300
earned an a plus.
That's right.

75
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:13,630
That one out of 10.
You fuckhead you're wrong.

76
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,530
You're wrong.
No,

77
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:17,530
you're wrong.
They can help you with trademarks,

78
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:18,610
copyrights,
patents,

79
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:20,230
all that good shit.
In the past 12 years,

80
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:25,231
over 2 million Americans have used legal
zoom and they've saved a ton of money.

81
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Legalzoom is not a law firm,
but they can connect you with the third 

82
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,070
party attorney and provide you with self
help services.

83
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,060
The third party attorney thing is very 
important because if you're one of those

84
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:38,650
people that you're in the middle of this
and you're like,

85
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:39,350
oh,
I'm panicking.

86
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,890
This is not where going to go to jail.
You don't have to worry.

87
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:46,891
Legal Zoom will connect you with someone
that lets you know that everything's 

88
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:46,891

93
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,210
There you go.
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]

94
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:04,900
dot com.
Hey,

95
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:08,410
what a coincidence.
Today we happen to have Aubrey,

96
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,190
the CEO of [inaudible] dot com with us,
so he could tell us lots of groovy shit 

97
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:17,740
about on it.
I'm on on it right now.

98
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:20,240
I'm wearing a tee shirt and I'm hopped 
up on Alpha brain,

99
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,740
some fucking Alpha brain dreams.
Last night,

100
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,350
son,
go good googly moonlight.

101
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,920
I took Alpha brain with dinner and uh,
I went to bed about four hours later and

102
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:37,291
had paula deen wrestling dreams.
I was wrestling Paula Paula Dean on a 

103
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:43,351
psychedelic rainbow is the most bizarre 
shit there was skateboards involved and 

104
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,280
it was the drippings at.
Even if you're going to get an animation

105
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,970
of that now,
the birth of that into the ether,

106
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,930
one can only hope if I'm even if Alpha 
brain didn't,

107
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,060
it didn't enhance your cognitive 
function,

108
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:04,061
which it does,
and now it's been clinically proven to 

109
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:06,521
do so.
It's worth taking just for the fucking 

110
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:06,521
dreams,
man.

111
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:06,790
I believe it's Coleen is a Columbian.

112
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,330
Coleen helps regulate the rem state in 
your sleep.

113
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:13,930
And Rem state is the dream state.
So the more acetylcholine you have,

114
00:06:13,931 --> 00:06:17,590
generally the longer and deeper your rem
states going to be.

115
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:19,180
So the crazier dreams can get,

116
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,800
so whether or not even want to take 
Alpha brain,

117
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,920
double up on that Acetylcholine and go 
for a wild ride and it's a safe ride 

118
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:28,940
folks.
Okay.

119
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:30,830
You're not going to die.
You might think you're going to die,

120
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:32,660
but I'm pretty sure you can die in your 
dreams.

121
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,150
Has that ever been proven can die in 
your dreams?

122
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:35,930
Right?
You just wake up.

123
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,970
That works.
I don't know if that's a fact.

124
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,840
Yeah.
No.

125
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,170
Yeah,
because you could lie about it.

126
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:44,000
I thought in my dream people will be 
like,

127
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,320
well the fucking.
But if.

128
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,360
Well usually the adrenaline of the pre 
death moment usually wakes you up.

129
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,840
Okay.
Yeah.

130
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,000
Like,

131
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,780
yeah.
Yeah.

132
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,900
The other thing I've found with Alpha 
brain that's really interesting is that 

133
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,560
lucid dreams are much more.
They're much more durable.

134
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,940
Like I've always found that whatever.
I've never taken any lucid dream,

135
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,930
uh,
courses.

136
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,460
I've never read any books and lucid 
dreams.

137
00:07:06,461 --> 00:07:11,461
Apparently there's a lot of strategies 
that you can use and one of them have 

138
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:12,700
done that I saw in one of those silly 
movies,

139
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:16,290
like the secret one of those movies.
What was the rabbit hole or whatever,

140
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,060
what the bleep do we know?
I think it was where a guy was saying,

141
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,440
go to every door that you walk through 
and before you walked through a knock on

142
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:24,610
the wall and say,
am I dreaming?

143
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,720
And do it as a habit so that every time 
you go through a door you go,

144
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,960
am I dreaming?
One time I did it my dream and it was 

145
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:33,960
like,
whoosh.

146
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Oh fuck.
Um,

147
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,290
and so,
uh,

148
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,980
I really did wake up in the middle of a 
dream and it was,

149
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,690
but it was very,
very durable.

150
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:41,590
It was really interesting.

151
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Yeah.
You can stay in it and play with it and 

152
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:46,640
see what,
see where you can take it.

153
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Yeah.
That's not normal.

154
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,390
Usually I go,
oh my God,

155
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:52,200
I'm dreaming and I wake up and then it's
gone parties over instantly.

156
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:57,350
Like I've had a few where I was flying 
for like 15 seconds or something like 

157
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,100
that.
But the Alpha brain dream.

158
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,020
How long does it take for you to turn to
lucid dream into sex?

159
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,310
Because all,
instantly,

160
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,680
instantly I find someone and just start 
a rape fast.

161
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,690
You know,
in the dreams they all want to fuck,

162
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,720
which has reared in your mind.
It's my dreams.

163
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,110
Very exciting since

164
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:21,170
I've been here last.
We were finally able to publish some of 

165
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:21,170
the,
uh,

166
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,480
the first of a series of clinical tests 
and the first one on Alpha brain.

167
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:26,370
So tell,
tell some people about that because it's

168
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,070
pretty exciting.

169
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:32,250
Yeah.
We did a pilot study just to kind of 

170
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,231
prove the concept with the Boston Center
for memory and a double blind placebo 

171
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:36,250
controlled study.
People took to Alpha brain pills,

172
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:41,251
which was kind of hard to figure out 
because we did a survey and a lot of 

173
00:08:41,251 --> 00:08:44,341
people take three,
but the majority is still take to some 

174
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:45,870
people or some people take one.
A few savages take for you in J.

175
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,930
Hawk take for fees.
Averages take four.

176
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,030
So we went with two and um,
you know,

177
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,060
and did a study testing a bunch of 
cognitive markers and even with a small 

178
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,320
sample size we had 17 people total go 
through.

179
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,920
We're able to achieve statistical 
significance in a couple of key tests,

180
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,510
stroop inhibition,
test,

181
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,500
executive cognitive functioning,
some verbal memory tests.

182
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,580
So some really good indications that the
Alpha brain is having the desired effect

183
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:13,720
that you know all the people who take it
and you know,

184
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,740
everybody who likes it as has been 
talking about now we have some science 

185
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,761
to back it up.
So we're currently in a followup study 

186
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:24,060
with about 80 patients that's halfway 
through right now.

187
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:28,200
It's kind of a rolling enrollment and so
hopefully we'll get some of that data at

188
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:31,620
least to us by the summer.
And then you look at the publication and

189
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,690
presentation scheduled,
but they're stoked.

190
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:38,691
I actually found out after the results 
came out that they didn't expect it to 

191
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:39,360
work.
Not The people who are doing it.

192
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,580
They're like,
Whoa,

193
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:40,950
shit.

194
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,700
It's really worked well for folks who 
don't know before we did any studies on 

195
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,230
on it.
There have been studies done on the 

196
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,661
individual individual ingredients of 
Alpha brain and that's something like 

197
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,640
people go,
there's no forgiveness is snake oil.

198
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,200
It's not at all.
Snake oil did the.

199
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,940
The concept behind Alpha brain was just 
that they would work synergistically,

200
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,300
which has proven to be correct,
but the ingredients,

201
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:09,120
the individual ingredients,
there is science behind it.

202
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:12,330
There's research and references.
All of it's available at [inaudible] dot

203
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:14,240
com,
so go there if you're interested,

204
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,170
what on it is.
Even if you go there,

205
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:17,560
you're like,
what the fuck are these guys doing?

206
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,580
They're preparing for war were a human 
optimization website and what that means

207
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:28,320
is we're trying to sell you things that 
can enhance your cognitive function,

208
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:30,750
enhance your mood,
enhance your physical fitness,

209
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:35,700
enhance your body's ability to do work,
enhance the way your body functions,

210
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,220
and there's a lot of stuff out there 
that does that,

211
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,490
whether it's new mood,
which is a five htp and l tryptophan 

212
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,571
supplement that actually can enhance 
your brain's ability to produce 

213
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:47,571
serotonin.

214
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:51,380
It's pretty spectacular stuff.
It really does make your mood better or 

215
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,371
whether it's strength and conditioning 
equipment like the Zombie bells and 

216
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:58,710
kettlebells are a primal bells,
which are kettlebells that we had 

217
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,390
designed by Steven Steuben Junior.
That's how I say his name.

218
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,890
You got it.
Steven Shubin Junior.

219
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:06,891
That's fucking awesome.
Artists has made us these incredible 

220
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:07,680
kettle bells that are also works of art.
I know people that have these that don't

221
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:12,681
even work out.
They just have them because they're 

222
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:14,331
fucking cool.
It's just a cool thing to have laying 

223
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:14,331
around your house,
especially the gorilla.

224
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:17,900
He's my all time favorite.
I just love working out with that 

225
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,190
gorilla man.
It makes me feel like,

226
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,350
like I'm doing something special.
I just set the top secret monster bell 

227
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,810
series.
I know that that's coming out in 2014 by

228
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,870
lots of bells.
I've seen some of that.

229
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,000
I've seen some of that.
Go to [inaudible] Dot Com,

230
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,730
o n n I t,
if you use the Codeword Rogan,

231
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:35,730
you will save 10 percent off any end.
All supplements.

232
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,290
All right,
ladies and gents.

233
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,960
Robert Greene is here and we're going to
get busy.

234
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:41,370
We're going to talk about some shit.

00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:46,371
Cue The music.
Jamie,

238
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,400
the Joe Rogan experience.

239
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,110
Try My podcast by all day.

240
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,000
First of all,
Robert Greene.

241
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:00,370
Thank you very much for doing the 
podcast.

242
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:02,150
I really appreciate it.
Pleasure to meet you.

243
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,740
Pleasure to have you in here.
Um,

244
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:04,640
I've heard many,
many,

245
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,820
many fantastic things about you,
but this guy over here raves,

246
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,970
rants and raves and I know you were 
recently on the warrior poet project 

247
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,900
podcast,
which is his podcast and he couldn't say

248
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,340
enough good things.
So,

249
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,660
uh,
had to have you in here,

250
00:12:17,661 --> 00:12:20,000
man.
Had to have to learn some stuff.

251
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:25,010
Have to figure out what you've 
accumulated for all your years of 

252
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,931
research and writing books and your 
books all seemed to be about getting 

253
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:31,970
your shit together.
About producing results.

254
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,210
Yeah.
Starting with the 48 laws of power,

255
00:12:36,211 --> 00:12:41,211
I basically decided to enter the self 
help genre with a lot of trepidation 

256
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:43,470
because I think it's full of a lot of 
bullshit.

257
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,720
Wait a minute,
hold on.

258
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:46,830
What are you saying?

259
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,720
I'm saying that it's filled with a lot 
of tree stuff that's gonna make you feel

260
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:58,100
good about yourself.
That's going to boost your ego a bit,

261
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:03,101
but doesn't get anything.
There's nothing real behind it that 

262
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:06,490
there's,
there's some things about life that are 

263
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,131
harsh.
There are people out there that are 

264
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:09,131
dirty and mean that you need to know 
about.

265
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:14,190
There's all sorts of things that aren't 
being discussed in these books.

266
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,890
And I know for instance,
when I started out,

267
00:13:18,891 --> 00:13:20,690
like in Hollywood,
I used to work in Hollywood,

268
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:26,070
um,
I was really shocked by all of the kind 

269
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,120
of power maneuvers and the kind of 
passive aggressive games that were going

270
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:30,560
on.
What did you do in Hollywood?

271
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,150
I wasn't horribly successful.
I was a writer.

272
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:38,720
I was assistant to a producer,
assistant to a director or a researcher,

273
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:41,360
a story developer.
I basically did everything.

274
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,520
So you were where you were connected to 
the machine,

275
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:48,521
you were in there?
Very much so you got to see the gear 

276
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:48,521
span.
Very much so.

277
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:50,030
And nobody writes about what really goes
on in the world.

278
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:51,980
I got so sick of it.
I see,

279
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,530
you know,
all sorts of weird games being played.

280
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:59,531
The one director,
this one producer who wanted to direct 

281
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:03,461
his first film and basically it would 
look bad if he was the director of 

282
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:06,860
something that he had sort of put 
together,

283
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,920
just wouldn't look good politically.
So what he did is he hired somebody he 

284
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,370
knew would do a terrible job,
a director,

285
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,400
first time director,
he knew the guy would fail and then he 

286
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,580
could go in and rescue him and become 
the director on the project.

287
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,910
But in the meantime,
totally destroying this other person's 

288
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,911
reputation on and on.
I could list 100 other sorts of games 

289
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:27,911
like that.
That's quite clever.

290
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:29,870
Move all sorts of things right out of 
the art of war.

291
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,350
That's basically,
that's just what I can jump in here and 

292
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,510
give a bit of my story.
I found that book,

293
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:40,511
Robert Greene's 48 laws of power before 
I had met you and I was in kind of a 

294
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:44,861
dark time in my own work climate and I 
started reading it and I started 

295
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:47,930
realizing all of the things that were 
happening.

296
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:49,040
Like,
Oh shit,

297
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,280
that's what's going on.
That's why this bad shit is happening.

298
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,990
That's why I'm being thwarted in this,
in this goal that I have.

299
00:14:56,991 --> 00:15:01,991
You know,
because you go in with these good 

300
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:01,991
natured intentions thinking,
I'm just going to do my best.

301
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:04,760
I'm gonna wear my heart on my sleeve.
And it's all gonna work out bullshit,

302
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,000
it doesn't work out,
it's all his.

303
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:11,560
But you can kind of get lucky and get in
touch with the right people to be,

304
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,570
yeah,
or be in the right in the right 

305
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,191
situation.
But a lot of times if you're in a kind 

306
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:18,350
of politically charged situation or a 
situation with a lot of ego,

307
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,070
uh,
his book was like this,

308
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,360
this wake up call of just sheer,
unabated truth about what the fuck is 

309
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:28,400
going on.
It's not so that I could do it myself,

310
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:32,090
but at least so I could see myself and 
see it and identify it.

311
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,420
So the,
this,

312
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,370
this move that this producer did in 
order to.

313
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,830
And that surprise you at all when you 
were,

314
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,110
you like,
oh,

315
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:40,510
you must have

316
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,350
fucker completely.
Because he never told me.

317
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,840
Obviously it wasn't going to confide 
that this was going on.

318
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:47,490
I,
it's my interpretation later on.

319
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,200
So you're sure that that's what 
happened?

320
00:15:49,201 --> 00:15:51,180
Or completely,
100 percent.

321
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,150
And I've seen him do other things.
So I saw,

322
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,440
what's his name?
What's that?

323
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,590
I can't date you,
shouldn't he?

324
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,270
He's,
he's no longer among us.

325
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:05,271
So I don't want to fuck around and he 
wasn't,

326
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,140
it wasn't a totally awful person,
you know,

327
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,410
he had a good side to him that is ripe 
with that stuff though.

328
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:17,411
What really annoyed the hell out of me 
about the Hollywood businesses that 

329
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:18,900
people would pretend to be so liberal 
and wonderful and good.

330
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:20,460
I love your project.
You're wonderful,

331
00:16:20,461 --> 00:16:25,461
you're great.
But at the same time they were so 

332
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:25,461
fucking power hungry.
Yeah.

333
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:29,421
Then nobody really talks about the power
hungry side and about what people are 

334
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:29,520
really up.

335
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,300
I worked with a guy on my very first 
sitcoms.

336
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:34,050
The first time I ever did any acting at 
all.

337
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,640
I was like 20 something,
25 I guess,

338
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,420
or 26 and I was on the show on Fox 
called hardball and there was a guy that

339
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:49,421
was on the show that would insult people
right before it was their time to 

340
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:55,601
perform.
Like you would say something about what 

341
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:55,601
are you fucking gaining Wayne here?
Like something,

342
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:56,750
what's going on with the gut?
And the guy would be like,

343
00:16:56,751 --> 00:17:01,751
what?
And then you'd see the guy perform with 

344
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:02,600
this.
Like he would fuck with you.

345
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,270
It's pretty good.
I've seen it.

346
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,940
It was really interesting to watch.
It was bizarre,

347
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,030
but it wasn't pretty good.
It was really shitty of them,

348
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,590
you know,
you did it to me once and I went,

349
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:14,060
what,
what the fuck did you say?

350
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,550
And then I cornered him and I said,
dude,

351
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:18,020
I go,
don't insult me.

352
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,550
I go,
because you're an ugly fuck,

353
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,470
you understand who you are.
I go,

354
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:23,540
we could just start talking about what's
wrong with you?

355
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,130
Fuck this in.
The guy would go,

356
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:26,270
come on,
we got to film the scene.

357
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,660
I go,
no,

358
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,920
I go,
this guy's a dick.

359
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,020
I just kinda likes to talk shit to be.
But right before they.

360
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,310
And everybody was like,
what is he doing?

361
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:33,390
He's calling out the thing that,
you know,

362
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,600
this guy's doing like,
you're not supposed to do that.

363
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,550
But he would be like really subtle about
it.

364
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,480
You know?
He'd be like,

365
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:42,380
who picked out that shirt?
Like weird shit to girls to man.

366
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:44,570
It wasn't just a guys,
but this was his thing.

367
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,590
He would be like really catty and he was
always reading like entertainment 

368
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,590
weekly.
He was always reading,

369
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,340
I would call the devil's rag,

370
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,530
like the Hollywood reporter,
all that Shitty,

371
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:57,531
but read those things and you'll see the
little fucking power wheels spinning in 

372
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:58,890
his devious mind.
Luckily he's dropped off the face of the

373
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:01,950
planet fortunately.
So you could read some of Robert Green's

374
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:06,951
books,
like strategies of war maybe and 

375
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:08,640
probably find some tactic in there that 
this guy was applying in order to weaken

376
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:11,070
his,
his people that gain power probably.

377
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,700
Right?
I mean,

378
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:12,900
does anything come to mind Robert?

379
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,390
Oh,
several come to mind.

380
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,010
Mostly passive aggression

381
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:20,980
creatively though that stuff is very 
ineffective because I firmly,

382
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,040
absolutely,
wholeheartedly believe that if you put 

383
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,040
your effort into diminishing others 
creatively,

384
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,530
it diminishes your own creative ability.
I really do believe that.

385
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,780
I also believed that performance wise,
if you try to diminish someone's 

386
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:33,780
performance,
like as an actor,

387
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,560
this is one of the reasons why this guy 
sucked.

388
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:38,830
He was so transparent,
like he's such a shitty person.

389
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,700
You know the guy that he did it with,
a guy called fat to wanting to kill him.

390
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:46,120
I had to talk the guy out a calender 
like you want this big fucking guy,

391
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:47,930
like you know,
it shouldn't call them fat.

392
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,990
Even if he is fat,
like he was doing it to fuck with the 

393
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,500
guy right before it's seen because he 
wanted to shine.

394
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:58,501
He wanted to.
He wanted to be the guy in the scene 

395
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:58,501
that was really on top of the ball.
Yeah,

396
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:03,350
so the key thing is to know these 
strategies so you can do with what he 

397
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,350
puts in there.
It's called the reversal,

398
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,520
you know,
like how to be aware of it and then 

399
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:08,520
reverse it.

400
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:08,690
Well,
the main thing is to never get emotional

401
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:11,870
in these situations.
If you're in control of yourself and you

402
00:19:11,871 --> 00:19:16,871
can do like Joe did,
you can sort of see the game behind the 

403
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:19,421
game.
Then you're in the position to do 

404
00:19:19,421 --> 00:19:21,310
something that strategic like he did to 
to play the same game back at.

405
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:27,310
It's mostly like a warrior.
I call it kind of a warrior pose where 

406
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:31,421
if you're calm and centered and you're 
aware and in the moment of what the 

407
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:35,441
other person is doing,
then you've got strategic options to 

408
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:35,450
play the game back.
But if you get emotional,

409
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,790
you get angry,
you get intimidated,

410
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,500
then forget about it.

411
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,540
So yeah,
I would probably today respond very 

412
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:44,540
differently,
but when I was in my early twenties,

413
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,120
it was scorched earth.
Every time I was,

414
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,320
I was going to def con nine.
Every time I'm like,

415
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,880
let's see who can hold their breath the 
longest.

416
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:55,290
I'll drag him in a pool.
That was always my strategy just because

417
00:19:55,291 --> 00:20:00,291
I was always nice to people,
but as soon as people weren't nice to 

418
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:00,930
me,
I just said that's a good way to be very

419
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:02,750
bad way of handling it.
Um,

420
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,910
but that,
that thing that people do seems to be 

421
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,550
not just calculated,
but it seems to be something that's been

422
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:16,551
going on since the beginning of time.
As soon as people invented language and 

423
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:17,250
they invented the ability to deceive,

424
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,450
you're touching upon the subject of my 
next book.

425
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,430
That's why I'm smiling.
What is that?

426
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,950
It's tentatively called the laws of 
human nature and essentially I'm saying 

427
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,230
that somewhere around 10,000
years ago,

428
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,430
maybe 6,000
are nature was set because we've started

429
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:36,190
living in groups that were larger than 
10,

430
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:37,750
23,
the size of a tribe,

431
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:43,020
and once you put 100 people together,
all sorts of political game start 

432
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,041
happening and things like envy and 
passive aggression and basic

433
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,850
irrational responses.
They already occurred in the time of the

434
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:56,851
Bible and so there are these laws of 
human nature that are so deeply 

435
00:20:56,851 --> 00:21:00,811
ingrained in the third grade,
just like a chimpanzee will react a 

436
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:04,171
certain way under certain circumstances,
and I'm going to show you what these 

437
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:08,980
were.
These laws come from why people are 

438
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:08,980
envious.
Wife,

439
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:08,980
people are insecure.
Why?

440
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,351
Somebody who has a certain exterior of 
face that they present to the world 

441
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:18,441
wide,
it's generally hiding the opposite on 

442
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:18,441
and on and on,
so you have.

443
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:22,060
You can understand where people's 
behavior comes from and not be surprised

444
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:23,320
by it anymore.
So

445
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,310
what you present is steps to recognize 
cons.

446
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,610
Yeah,
but you know what?

447
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:31,590
There's a little bit of cut and everyone
and all of us,

448
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:33,660
including myself and you guys.
Yeah,

449
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:34,470
yeah,
yeah.

450
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:36,540
And those who deny it and I hopefully 
you're not.

451
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:40,980
One of them deny our are actually are 
actually crypto club.

452
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:48,390
I was so excited.
That's a greatest word.

453
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,140
That's a great band name by the way.
You can use a crypto conscious.

454
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,440
Yeah.
If I was going to start a band,

455
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:58,441
it might be the crypto can just end up 
getting arrested just so they'd have to 

456
00:21:58,441 --> 00:21:59,110
talk about it on CNN.
Like they did pussy riot,

457
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:04,180
but it was my favorite thing.
Favorite thing about pussy riot was 

458
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,890
great.
Them talking about it.

459
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,650
I can name see riot.
The members of pussy riot.

460
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:09,400
I was like,
stop.

461
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,030
This can't be real.
This is a beautiful time.

462
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,780
Beautiful time in history.
Those girls are fucking bad ass man.

463
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,260
Not just bad ass for their.
Their ability to come up with an awesome

464
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:21,940
name,
but they get arrested.

465
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:26,941
They spent fucking how many months in 
Siberia they get out and start 

466
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:27,880
protesting at the Olympics.
Horse whipped.

467
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,950
Those chicks are fucking gangster.

468
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,290
They're so gangster.
I love pussy riot.

469
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,200
I'm a huge fan of their music sucks and 
I don't even know if it does.

470
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,040
It probably does live performance on 
Jerry Pussy riot make it happen.

471
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,970
So the crypto con,
so that's just my next book.

472
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:43,750
Yeah,
everyone.

473
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:50,070
Does everyone have content in them 
because they're reacting to other cons 

474
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:55,231
or do you think that everyone has like a
selfish aspect to them that's 

475
00:22:55,231 --> 00:22:55,660
undeniable?
I mean,

476
00:22:55,661 --> 00:23:00,661
what?
What is it about people that you think 

477
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:01,060
everyone has a little bit of continuity?
Is it reactionary or is it.

478
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,680
Is it actionary set?

479
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,800
Both.
It's both.

480
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,400
I suppose there might've been one 
saintly figure in our history who 

481
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,030
doesn't have any of this,
maybe a Jesus or something,

482
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,480
but pretty much the.
The underlying philosophy of all my 

483
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,861
books,
particularly the 48 laws of power is it 

484
00:23:21,861 --> 00:23:22,530
human beings have a primal need for 
power and we've.

485
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,570
We've used that word power in the wrong 
way.

486
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:29,571
When we think of power,
we think of white men up in the White 

487
00:23:29,571 --> 00:23:33,110
House controlling the world.
I try and bring power down to an 

488
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,721
everyday level and say the feeling that 
you have no control over your life,

489
00:23:35,911 --> 00:23:37,890
over your destiny,
over the people around you,

490
00:23:37,891 --> 00:23:42,891
your children,
your wife is the most miserable feeling 

491
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:43,950
that any human can have,
that you have no power over them,

492
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:47,600
no ability to them and so stunned in the
age of one,

493
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,410
two years old,
we have had this feeling of insecurity,

494
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:56,411
of weakness and we want to have control 
and power over the people around us,

495
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,320
the events that go on in life,
and that is the source for a lot of our 

496
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,440
manipulative behavior.
Some people are overtly manipulative and

497
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:08,870
very dangerous that way,
but all of us,

498
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,960
all of us engage at some point or 
another in something that teeters on 

499
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,810
manipulation and my books are about.
Let's just be honest about who we are.

500
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:22,811
Instead of trying to imagine that we 
were somehow descended from angels 

501
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:23,210
instead of primates.
No,

502
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:28,211
we're descended from chimpanzees.
If you studied chimpanzees that are 

503
00:24:28,211 --> 00:24:30,470
pretty machiavellian creatures,
that's where we come from.

504
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:35,471
Let's be honest about the human being.
Instead of trying to pretend that we're 

505
00:24:35,471 --> 00:24:35,660
all born like Gandhi,

506
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,220
well the the chimpanzee has one thing 
that we don't and that's language or we 

507
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:46,501
have one thing that they don't rather,
which is language and language is where 

508
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:47,620
things get weird because you get 
deception.

509
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,600
Yes,
and you also get strategy.

510
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,480
You were chimps,
have some strategy,

511
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:54,640
like you ever seen the videos where they
chased monkeys,

512
00:24:54,641 --> 00:24:59,641
where they,
they corner him on the sides and then 

513
00:24:59,641 --> 00:24:59,650
other chimps rush them towards them and 
they climb up and they eat them.

514
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,980
It's pretty radical stuff and until the 
19 nineties,

515
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:05,350
people didn't even know that champs 
eight monkeys,

516
00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:10,351
you know,
they thought these beautiful berry 

517
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:10,351
eating friends and they eat bananas.
Like curious George.

518
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,650
No,
not really.

519
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,970
They fucking rip monkeys apart.
Needham alive and engaged in warfare.

520
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Yes they do.
They engage in warfare against other 

521
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,401
chimps.
They get engaged in it in a very 

522
00:25:23,401 --> 00:25:26,281
strategic sense.
They have lines where they're not 

523
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:26,310
allowed to cross and when they do cross,
they they,

524
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,490
they take action.
This is actually an interesting topic 

525
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,081
because if you read Chris Ryan,
he's had proposes a theory that this 

526
00:25:34,081 --> 00:25:38,011
behavior that they've observed,
the chimp warring was created by the 

527
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:41,750
artificial production of this food box 
in the,

528
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,900
in the chimps habitat.
When they were observing them,

529
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,390
they would have food around that.
They were giving the chimps.

530
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,180
Right,
so this is this.

531
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,040
This is pretty well done.
They didn't see any of that prior to the

532
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:51,580
food box.

533
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,610
Oh No,
no,

534
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:53,090
no,
no.

535
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,630
I don't know who Chris Ryan is,
but I,

536
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,970
I think that's very wrong.

537
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,980
Well,
Jane Goodall observed this,

538
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,890
but to keep the chimps around,
she had a box of food.

539
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,300
So this is a fact.
Right?

540
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:08,450
And after that it created this zero sum 
game where the chimps were competing for

541
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:12,040
a limited resource of food,
which actually goes to the argument that

542
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:17,041
when you create a civilization and it's 
not just tribal and it becomes a zero 

543
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:21,541
sum game,
that's when the war and the strategy 

544
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:22,360
gets to a peak because you're creating a
zero sum game.

545
00:26:22,361 --> 00:26:25,240
There's a limited amount of resource,
a limited amount of crop,

546
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:30,420
or in the case of the chimpanzees a 
limited amount of food that was coming 

547
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,110
out of this box,
so only a certain number of the chimps 

548
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,080
would get the food.
So kind of interesting.

549
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:37,900
I just thought I'd bring that up and 
when Dr Ryan's on here,

550
00:26:37,901 --> 00:26:39,850
you can certainly bring that up next 
week.

551
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,820
He'll be on the 11th.
What was your issue with what he said?

552
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,100
Well,

553
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:49,100
it's always a zero sum game.
Why isn't it a zero sum game and it's 

554
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,470
always limited foods,
but there's always.

555
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,500
There's more resource you can go to.
You're not competing for one very 

556
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,460
specific section.
You can go to more acres,

557
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:01,461
more hectares of land and find the grubs
or the fruits or whatever of that,

558
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,450
of that area rather than competing over.
I don't want to argue with somebody that

559
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:07,580
had on red,
so maybe he has a very valid point.

560
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,330
I haven't read it so it's not fair for 
me to.

561
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,040
But it does.
It doesn't affect your.

562
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,590
It doesn't affect your theory that once 
you're in civilization,

563
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,710
these games begin and the tighter the 
resources in that civilization I bigger 

564
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,820
cities and the more closely people 
working together,

565
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,610
the more fever pitch these games.
Well,

566
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:26,070
I don't want to,
I don't want to get on a tangent here,

567
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:28,890
but there's a writer,
a scientist named Eo Wilson.

568
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:34,420
I'm a biologist and he's pretty much 
demonstrated that are our earliest human

569
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:38,000
ancestors going back to 
Australopithecines.

570
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,400
Um,
we're engaging in forms of warfare.

571
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,280
Sure.
So he wants to sort of debunk the notion

572
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:49,610
of the happy,
peaceful savage that that goes back to 

573
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:49,690
Jacques Rousseau,
etc.

574
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,450
That we do have very violent roots.
And so maybe chimpanzees,

575
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,380
iT becomes a zero sum if there's 
overpopulation and they're fighting over

576
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,590
smaller territories,
which we humans we're doing as we became

577
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:06,591
more populous.
So he was trying to debunk the notion 

578
00:28:06,591 --> 00:28:10,640
that it's only at the advent of 
agriculture where we started living in 

579
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,910
settlements and became civilized at 
warfare began.

580
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:16,911
And he shows very clearly that the 
beginnings of warfare go back hundreds 

581
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:18,400
of thousands of years.
Well,

582
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,420
it seems unavoidable.
It seems like all animals who compete 

583
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:23,670
for breeding rights,
who compete for food,

584
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,700
they,
they engage in some form of combat.

585
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,660
Deers regularly kill each other,
you know,

586
00:28:29,661 --> 00:28:32,100
that happens with elk.
It happens with stables,

587
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:37,101
stables,
with those crazy big horns that they 

588
00:28:37,101 --> 00:28:37,101
have.
They fucking,

589
00:28:37,101 --> 00:28:37,590
they spear each other and they kill each
other.

590
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:42,830
Um,
I had louis throw on the podcast 

591
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:42,830
yesterday and uh,
he,

592
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:47,060
one of his documentaries,
he had this african hunting camp where 

593
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,470
they sort of,
these canned hunts where they have these

594
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:54,471
high fence operations and they breed all
these animals and they have these 

595
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:54,540
samples in their fucking murdering each 
other.

596
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,380
They knew eAch other and gouge each 
other when,

597
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,940
when the females are invalid,
are staples that they're like,

598
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,820
it's one of those crazy fucking deer 
things.

599
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,610
You pull up a picture of a sable jamie.
It's a one of those african dear,

600
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,140
like creatures with big crazy horns.

601
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:14,310
They have these fucking murder weapons 
or if they have built in their face,

602
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,130
you know,
that's really what they have.

603
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,950
Um,
but the point being is that yeah,

604
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:21,690
there they are.
Those guys murder each other.

605
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,960
It looks like an oryx similar.
Yeah,

606
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:29,961
there's a.
There's a lot of those different types 

607
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:32,211
of antlered horned animals that they 
clash heads.

608
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,240
I mean that's what they do.
They go to war with each other.

609
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,980
It's.
It seems to be a part.

610
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:40,470
I mean it's also part of genetic 
selection.

611
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,500
It seems be unavoidable and I've always 
felt that when we look at the timeframe 

612
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,670
between now and 6,000,
10,000

613
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:49,480
years,
whatever it was,

614
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:53,070
when we started having these 
civilizations,

615
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,080
these were wearing a very small window 
between then and now in such radical 

616
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:02,320
change has taken place between them and 
now then and now,

617
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,760
but yet genetically not much.
A few variations,

618
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:11,790
variations have been observed between us
and people that live thousands of years 

619
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:16,110
ago,
but god not that much when it comes to 

620
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,110
need,
when it comes to sexual desire,

621
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,220
when it comes to greed,
when it comes to automotive,

622
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,750
motivating factors,
it all of the reward systems that are in

623
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:27,751
place and the other thing being that we 
don't have release anymore.

624
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,590
The physical release that a human being 
is essentially hard wired.

625
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:35,600
Every chimp there swinging from branches
and they're.

626
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,600
They're working out all day,
I mean they're,

627
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:40,330
they're constantly getting this release 
of energy

628
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,630
and they're also getting a release of 
some of their aggressive energy as well,

629
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:45,460
which we don't seem to have.
Have a lot of

630
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:50,530
exactly what I'm talking about.
I think people are essentially leaky 

631
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,291
batteries of aggressive energy mean when
someone's in their car and they start 

632
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:57,311
fucking freaking out because you got in 
front of them and fucking honking their 

633
00:30:57,311 --> 00:31:00,281
horns.
That's a leaky battery of aggressive 

634
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:00,281
manner.

635
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:02,740
The other day this mild mannered woman 
in her forties or fifties cut me off and

636
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:06,580
she just turned around and get.
I'd never seen a woman show that kind of

637
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,620
absolute chimp like aggressive bearing 
where teeth at me in a car.

638
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:12,310
It was shocking.

639
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,590
I haven't been to the post office 
stamps.com.

640
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,480
Yeah,
it's a.

641
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:22,320
It's a weird thing and it's also.
There's the cars,

642
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:25,910
a very unique environment in that 
because of the fact that you don't,

643
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,760
even though you see people,
you don't feel them.

644
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,230
You know,
you're not in front of them.

645
00:31:30,231 --> 00:31:35,231
Like I'm looking at you right now,
and if I said something that hurt your 

646
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:35,231
feelings,
it would bother me,

647
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:35,270
but if I didn't know you when you're in 
a car,

648
00:31:35,271 --> 00:31:36,470
I'm like,
fuck you dude.

649
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:37,550
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

650
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:39,610
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

651
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,760
You know people do that all the time.
I've seen people cut in front of each 

652
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,831
other and raced down the street in front
of each other and just madness that you 

653
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:52,391
wouldn't see in a line you wouldn't see.
If you're waiting in line to go to a 

654
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:52,391
movie.
It's very rare,

655
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:57,140
but you see it there because this,
all the social cues are missing.

656
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,600
All the human interaction that is 
missing.

657
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:02,210
It's like there's this wall and this 
filter up.

658
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,070
Same thing on the internet.
Yes,

659
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,100
more so on the internet because you 
don't even see the person and they're 

660
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,100
hiding behind.
You know,

661
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,790
dick fuck.
Sixty nine is their name and whatever it

662
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:12,440
is,
they're not real,

663
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,260
and so they can reach out to Robert 
Greene and go,

664
00:32:15,261 --> 00:32:19,000
you're fucking bugs.
Or for faggots posts,

665
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:22,990
youtube comments,
and go fucking crazy on your block.

666
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,120
Like people,
like a friend of mine writes a blog and 

667
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,220
someone was like,
why don't you have comments on your 

668
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:31,220
blogs?
Like,

669
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:31,220
well,
what do you read comments?

670
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,340
Do you read comments on blogs?
Why would you want anybody to write 

671
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:36,340
where you're writing?
You know,

672
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,480
if you had a painting,
would you allow people to,

673
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,910
you know,
paint underneath your painting what they

674
00:32:40,911 --> 00:32:45,911
think about your painting.
You'd be a lot of dick's pointing to 

675
00:32:45,911 --> 00:32:46,160
your painting,
piles of shit with flies.

676
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,910
That's what they would draw in.
Not not all people,

677
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:55,030
but enough people to where it's a 
problem because they haven't earned the 

678
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,960
ability to communicate with you like 
that you,

679
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,110
you choose who you communicate with in 
real life for the most part,

680
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,900
especially who you surround yourself 
with on a regular basis,

681
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,450
but online,
you choose nothing online.

682
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:10,451
It's the beautiful thing about being 
online is that everyone gets to say 

683
00:33:10,451 --> 00:33:11,720
something and it's the horrible thing 
about being online is that everyone gets

684
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:13,960
to say something and do so anonymously.
Yep.

685
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:19,210
Which is another part of what's weird 
about our progression from this ancient 

686
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,591
society where we hunted and gathered to 
eventually agriculture and then 

687
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:27,260
civilization in quotes to where we find 
ourselves today.

688
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:32,710
So your books essentially,
and this new book especially is sort of 

689
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,270
recognizing these traits so that you can
move away from them.

690
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:44,330
Well,
you're talking about my new book that 

691
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,861
hasn't been written yet.
The point of the book is that this is 

692
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:50,721
human nature and it's an animal nature,
and to be truly human,

693
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,140
we have to overcome these traits in us 
to be truly rational,

694
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,590
reasonable.
I'm empathetic,

695
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:03,860
abbott creatures.
We have to overcome these various 

696
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,300
aspects of our own nature which are 
embedded in each one of us biologically,

697
00:34:06,301 --> 00:34:09,570
genetically,
such as our propensity to feel envy.

698
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,600
The propensity that envy is basically at
its root.

699
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:16,560
The fact that we humans are constantly 
comparing ourselves to other people.

700
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:21,770
Look at your own life on a day to day 
basis and be honest with yourself and 

701
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,881
try and calculate how many times during 
a day you're actually comparing yourself

702
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,170
to another person.
He's got more money.

703
00:34:28,171 --> 00:34:31,350
She's prettier,
he's got a better job.

704
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:35,760
You're doing that's so completely human 
for various reasons,

705
00:34:35,761 --> 00:34:39,120
which I'll explain in the book to reach 
a higher nature,

706
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:44,121
which is the goal of my book.
You have to be aware that that's 

707
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:45,510
happening and you and you have to find a
way to disengage yourself from that need

708
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:50,550
to constantly compare yourself to others
to find your own value,

709
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,510
your own self worth from within on.
These are all kinds of cliches,

710
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,520
but I'm going to show you in a very real
fashion how you can overcome them once 

711
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:58,890
you're aware that they're inside of you.

712
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,090
Yeah,
but the book is not written yet.

713
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:06,470
It's a beautiful point though.
That's the beautiful point of being 

714
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,751
aware of them instead of denying them 
instead of getting all fufu chimes and 

715
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,030
indian chance.
Thank you.

716
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,350
being aware of them.
Yes.

717
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:19,890
So when you started reading all of the 
self help books and started recognizing 

718
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:22,570
that there was all this horse shit going
on,

719
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,900
what was your immediate reaction to try 
to write something that you thought was 

720
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,250
more realistic and beneficial or did 
you.

721
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,200
How did you.
How did you deal with it?

722
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,170
Well,
there's a lot of anger.

723
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,150
I have,
you know,

724
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,620
I have less now.
I'm older,

725
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:42,621
but I had a lot of anger back then 
because it really pissed me off that no 

726
00:35:42,621 --> 00:35:43,350
one was talking about it.
people were pretending that this was the

727
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:46,140
world we lived in.
There'd be books in the business section

728
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:48,120
about management,
how to manage people,

729
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:52,200
which is a very primal,
a topic of discussion.

730
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:53,820
You have a group of people and you're a 
leader.

731
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:58,170
How do you manage all of theSe insecure 
egos who are thinking of themselves,

732
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,630
and these books were essentially 
dishonest.

733
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:04,470
They weren't confronting the fact that 
when you put 10 people together,

734
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,110
those people generally have their own 
agendas.

735
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:12,111
they're thinking first and primarily of 
themselves and their future and their 

736
00:36:12,111 --> 00:36:12,960
careers and what they can get for 
themselves,

737
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,140
and if you start from a basic false 
premise,

738
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,430
you're not gonna get anywhere.

739
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:22,670
So I was dealing with.
I wanted to cut my soar through all of 

740
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,821
this thick bullshit and say this is what
really happens in business,

741
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,100
in the music industry,
in hollywood,

742
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:34,310
among lawyers in politics,
and if some of it was a little brutal,

743
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:39,710
maybe I gave myself a little bit of 
literary licensed to exaggerate ever so 

744
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,500
slightly,
but for instance,

745
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:43,050
I have a chapter in there about how to 
create a cult.

746
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,790
Um,
and it's obviously ironic.

747
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:49,020
I'm not telling you you need to go out 
there and create a cult.

748
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:54,350
What I'm saying is we humans are very 
gullible and we're very easy to mislead 

749
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:57,000
and we're very easy.
We want to believe in something.

750
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:59,710
We want to believe in a cause.
This is,

751
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,770
these are the strategies that people 
have used in history to create a cult 

752
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,601
like following.
and I'm going to sort of reveal that to 

753
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:08,601
you.
Um,

754
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,760
these are things that just aren't in 
self help books at least in 1998 when 

755
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:13,760
the book came out.

756
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,290
So when [inaudible] writing about 
creating a cult.

757
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,670
Yeah,
what do you,

758
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,620
what are your strategies?
How do you go about doing that?

759
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,950
Well,
you're trying to wrap yourself up in 

760
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,531
this sort of mystical vale.
The chapter originally already fucked 

761
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:35,391
that part up.
You probably haven't because you have a 

762
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:38,911
cult following and therefore you like 
different though from what then called 

763
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:43,750
cult like is different than cult because
I'm not,

764
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,780
there's no organization whatsoever.
Not trying to get anything out of 

765
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:48,780
anybody.
Trying to tell them what to do.

766
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:48,960
Oh,
there's,

767
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,040
it's different.
I'm not trying to benefit from it.

768
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,740
What you'd want to have as many 
followers as possible,

769
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:55,870
as many people shouldn't have as many as
possible.

770
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,440
Quality over quantity is very important 
business.

771
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,240
And I'm sure you're right though.
I keep hearing you say content,

772
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,770
colton,
that we're done with con,

773
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,090
you know,
once you,

774
00:38:07,091 --> 00:38:08,440
uh,
what was your term again?

775
00:38:08,441 --> 00:38:09,460
Crypto.
Crypto con?

776
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,660
Yeah.
You fucking knocked it out of the park.

777
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,940
Uh,
basically if,

778
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,970
if somebody is using numbers,
now I know I have the 48 laws of power 

779
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:20,860
so I couldn't be guilty of it.
Thirty years.

780
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,920
Three strategies.
Law probably

781
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:29,950
starting to create a cult because that 
goes back hundreds and thousands of 

782
00:38:30,591 --> 00:38:32,190
years.
Not that I'm not hundreds,

783
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,260
thousands,
but hundreds and thousands take you.

784
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:35,580
Yes,

785
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:41,150
uh,
giving us sort of mystical edge to what 

786
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:44,671
you're doing.
You're trying to make people think that 

787
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:45,130
you're creating a religion without a 
religion.

788
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,230
Um,
and they're,

789
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:46,680
you know,
I,

790
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,840
I show you the steps that people go 
through five steps in order and you can 

791
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:54,250
pretty much,
if you see those steps happening,

792
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:56,470
you know,
that this person is creating a cult like

793
00:38:56,471 --> 00:39:01,471
following and one of the steps towards 
near the end is creating an us versus 

794
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:05,140
them dynamic.
It's us 1000 followers against the whole

795
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:10,141
world that doesn't believe in our theory
of how the know of how aliens landed on 

796
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:12,840
the planet and started the human race.
So whenever there's,

797
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,910
they're creating this false dichotomy of
us versus the nonbelievers and you know,

798
00:39:18,011 --> 00:39:19,240
that you're on your way to a coat.

799
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,320
That the.
Yeah,

800
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,540
that cult of thinking is very common,
isn't it?

801
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,120
Yes.
The us versus them is really a,

802
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,790
that's the big one that is the big.

803
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,160
And that goes back,
I'm going to say in my new book,

804
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:31,000
which hasn't been written yet,
um,

805
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:36,390
that,
that goes back to our hunter gatherer 

806
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,920
ancestors where we're separating 
ourselves very violently from us,

807
00:39:37,921 --> 00:39:40,050
from them.
That tribe over there,

808
00:39:40,051 --> 00:39:42,140
they're evil.
They don't believe in the same gods that

809
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,520
we believe in.
They don't practice the same rituals.

810
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,010
We have to go kill them.
It's a very primal human thing.

811
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,150
Yeah.
That seems people have this really seems

812
00:39:50,151 --> 00:39:52,460
inescapable.
Need to be a part of a group.

813
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,580
Yes.
Whether it's a group of mac users or you

814
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:57,680
know,
whether it's a whatever the fuck it is.

815
00:39:57,681 --> 00:39:59,360
So I like fords.
I like chevy.

816
00:39:59,361 --> 00:40:00,200
You know,
if people get,

817
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:05,500
they get really crazy about that and 
it's a very weird aspect of human 

818
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,241
nature.
People want you to be on the same cell 

819
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,691
phone provider as them.
Like what are you doing with t mobile 

820
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:13,830
man?
Come on over to the t and t.

821
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,610
Well the,
the,

822
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,930
the companies have used some of those 
strategies.

823
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:23,120
They've created this us versus them 
mentality to help make people feel like 

824
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:23,950
that,
you know,

825
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:26,410
all of these advertising practices that 
you see,

826
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,640
you know,
generally you can find a lot of their 

827
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,451
roots and you know,
some of these larger scale strategies 

828
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:37,290
like look at this map versus this map 
creating this antagonism that actually 

829
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,840
probably helps both sides and it's,
they're all just shaking hands like that

830
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:44,440
plane ride where the republicans and 
democrats were playing yahtzee with each

831
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:45,670
other and having a big laugh.

832
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:50,790
I remember the think different Ads.
Do you remember the things she ants for 

833
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,030
apple where they use all these dead 
people.

834
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:52,780
It was like,
does that guy,

835
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:56,260
even though he's in an ad dead,
this is weird,

836
00:40:56,261 --> 00:41:01,261
you know,
think different with the apple logo and 

837
00:41:01,261 --> 00:41:01,510
that everybody wanted to think 
different.

838
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,880
Effective,
very effective,

839
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,620
but almost,
you know,

840
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,280
kind of deceptively so in some weird 
sort of a way.

841
00:41:09,281 --> 00:41:11,000
You know,
you will.

842
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,450
You're just fucking computer man.
Yeah.

843
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,300
Which you have is a computer.
It's not thinking for you.

844
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,030
It doesn't.
You could write the most racist,

845
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:21,980
horrible shit on a mac and it doesn't 
stop you.

846
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:27,670
You can totally plot your agenda against
whatever and they fill in the blank,

847
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,800
anti homosexual,
anti woman,

848
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:30,550
anti,
whatever.

849
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,950
You could just write the worst shit ever
on a mac.

850
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,960
It doesn't discriminate.
It doesn't have any effect on how you 

851
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:37,960
think.
Like it's,

852
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,980
it's such a dumb ad.
You think different.

853
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:45,460
Think different.
How was sitting in front of this thing 

854
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:45,460
going?
I'm not thinking any different.

855
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,520
I think it's also grammatically 
incorrect.

856
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,290
It is differently.
Think you're right.

857
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,360
Yeah.
It's fucking dead wrong,

858
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,970
but yet effective.
Yeah.

859
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,590
I guess it's that the need to be a part 
of a group is a,

860
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,340
it's one of the things that people 
definitely play against

861
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,560
that was completely social animals.
Um,

862
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,980
and uh,
that's the source.

863
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:10,981
If you think about the human being,
go back a million years ago where we 

864
00:42:10,981 --> 00:42:14,110
were incredibly the one of the weakest 
animals on the planet.

865
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,570
um,
you know,

866
00:42:15,571 --> 00:42:18,610
we were just barely learning how to 
stand up on our two legs.

867
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,740
We were slow,
couldn't run very fast,

868
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:24,070
didn't have teeth to kill another animal
with no poison,

869
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:29,071
no clause.
We were the maybe one of the weakest 

870
00:42:29,071 --> 00:42:29,071
animals on,
in,

871
00:42:29,071 --> 00:42:29,071
you know,
in the,

872
00:42:29,071 --> 00:42:29,590
in,
in africa,

873
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:32,150
and yet look at us now.
It was from our,

874
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,140
so becoming the preeminent social 
animal.

875
00:42:35,141 --> 00:42:40,141
We learn how to work in groups to hunt 
in groups to cooperate out of that came 

876
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:45,120
language eventually so you can't divorce
are extreme social nature from who we 

877
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:49,450
are.
And because of that,

878
00:42:49,451 --> 00:42:52,860
we have a tremendous propensity to 
conform to,

879
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,000
to want to think like other people.

880
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,480
I don't know if you're familiar with the
milgram experiments about authority and 

881
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:02,170
obedience.
It Was in the sixties.

882
00:43:02,171 --> 00:43:07,171
A yale professor had people come in for 
an experiment where they were made to 

883
00:43:07,171 --> 00:43:11,580
give electric shocks to other people.
If they didn't answer a question 

884
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,750
correctly,
they weren't really giving a shock.

885
00:43:13,751 --> 00:43:17,740
It was all a plant that he was trying to
see how they would respond to authority.

886
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,280
And the most mild manner housewife would
be given those shocks to people when 

887
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,800
they gave the wrong answer.
And he was showing how inbred rna,

888
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,780
how we are all wired to obey authority.
Um,

889
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:35,530
so these are things embedded deeply in 
us as a social animal for the good,

890
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,190
for,
for,

891
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,470
for a good thing or our ability to 
cooperate,

892
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,630
but also it's a very dark and negative 
side,

893
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:45,631
which is our ability to engage in group 
think and are mindless obedience.

894
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,300
40.
Is that where that's coming from?

895
00:43:49,301 --> 00:43:54,301
When someone with a mild mannered 
housewives are hitting that button and 

896
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:57,750
shocking people,
is that worth coming from or is it they 

897
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,811
finally have some power over something 
because I feel like there's a lot of 

898
00:44:00,811 --> 00:44:01,450
people out there that feel incredibly 
power,

899
00:44:01,451 --> 00:44:04,480
less and frustrated and they feel like 
they have this backlog,

900
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,860
they have a leaky battery for that.
Like they want to have some fucking 

901
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:09,860
power over people.
and when you finally do,

902
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:14,461
like,
what was the stanford prison experiment 

903
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:14,461
was the same?
Was it the same thing?

904
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:16,430
There were two professors who were 
friends and they kind of,

905
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:21,730
oh,
bullshit heads pointing out how to make 

906
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:22,790
people evil.
The stanford prison experiment,

907
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:26,060
I mean they caught them off after they 
cut the experiments short because people

908
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:31,061
were being so evil.
they had fake prison guards and 

909
00:44:31,061 --> 00:44:31,061
prisoners.
Um,

910
00:44:31,061 --> 00:44:31,210
I,
I,

911
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:36,240
I personally experienced that on a 
personal level when I was a security 

912
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,731
guard.
I worked as a security guard at great 

913
00:44:40,731 --> 00:44:43,431
woods,
which is a concert center for the 

914
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:43,431
performing arts in Massachusetts to 
nashville,

915
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,100
man manfield,
I think,

916
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:45,840
man,
man,

917
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,030
mass,
wherever the fuck it is man field,

918
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,470
I think it is,
it's a,

919
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:54,330
this outdoor venue and there was a lot 
of crazy shit going on.

920
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:58,410
They had all these nutty concerts there 
and all these fights would break out and

921
00:44:58,411 --> 00:45:01,980
it became us versus them,
us as a security guard versus them.

922
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:06,981
And I saw some really mild mannered 
people do some mean shit to the people 

923
00:45:06,981 --> 00:45:07,380
that were,
uh,

924
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:07,950
were guests.

925
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,900
They're very interesting.
You know,

926
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:12,900
I saw a guy that would never hurt 
anybody,

927
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,330
punch somebody in the stomach because 
the guy,

928
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:18,060
I forget what the guy did,
but I remember watching him hit this guy

929
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:18,750
going,
wow,

930
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:20,340
this is crazy.
Yeah.

931
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,950
And it was because of that,
it was because he was wearing a security

932
00:45:22,951 --> 00:45:24,630
jacket.
He was security.

933
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:27,870
The guy was a drunk asshole.
And but where he would normally,

934
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:30,240
if you ran into this guy in the street 
would never hit him,

935
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,960
but because he was in this position of 
power in quotes,

936
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,090
you know,
he,

937
00:45:35,091 --> 00:45:36,090
he hit this guy.
I mean,

938
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:37,890
I don't know if the guy pushed someone 
or something,

939
00:45:37,891 --> 00:45:39,180
but it would,
it was avoidable.

940
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:40,270
He didn't have to hit them.
Yeah.

941
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,700
And I remember that mentality being very
clear,

942
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:46,350
the us versus them mentality.

943
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,380
So the key to avoiding these dark 
characteristics is you have to be 

944
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:51,600
honest,
number one,

945
00:45:51,601 --> 00:45:56,601
which I think he's very good at doing,
but then also understand and identify 

946
00:45:56,601 --> 00:45:57,270
him,
not be able to look and say,

947
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,140
this is why this is happening.
We have this us versus them dynamic.

948
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:02,940
It's creating this,
this thing.

949
00:46:02,941 --> 00:46:05,460
And unless you can identify it and 
become aware of it,

950
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:10,461
it's pretty much powerless to break it.
So the knowledge that these books give 

951
00:46:10,461 --> 00:46:12,430
give you,
at least in my opinion of,

952
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,460
of one of the reasons I loved him so 
much,

953
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,640
they give you the power back by saying 
you're not just a leaf at the mercy of 

954
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,120
the wind,
of these forces of human nature.

955
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:26,210
And the forces of other people wielding 
these power games and the forces of 

956
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,931
seduction by these people who are 
desperately trying to date and how 

957
00:46:29,931 --> 00:46:33,141
they've got you all wound up inside.
You're no longer powerless because you 

958
00:46:33,141 --> 00:46:33,570
can see,
aha,

959
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,900
this is what's happening.
And you can take some of that back and 

960
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,510
then chart your course with your own 
intent,

961
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,280
with your own morality.
How you want to Do it.

962
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:41,770
Yeah,
that's,

963
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,590
that's fair.
Thank you.

964
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,230
That was very well put.
But I have a book.

965
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,840
I should have you just do all the 
answer.

966
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:51,841
All the questions plugs busy.
I did a book with fifty cent a rapper 

967
00:46:55,671 --> 00:47:00,671
called the 50th law.
And basically what I did in that book 

968
00:47:00,671 --> 00:47:03,350
was I wanted to figure out what made 50 
so interesting,

969
00:47:03,351 --> 00:47:08,351
so powerful.
And after hanging out with them I 

970
00:47:08,351 --> 00:47:10,901
decided that the guy was fearless.
He had a just incredible fearless 

971
00:47:10,901 --> 00:47:15,010
quality and philosophy of life.
So the book that we wrote together was 

972
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:19,091
sort of a meditation on fearlessness and
the and the whole point of the book was 

973
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,730
being fearless isn't a question of just 
going out there and saying,

974
00:47:22,731 --> 00:47:24,710
fuck you.
I don't care what anybody does,

975
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:28,490
I'm going to push you around and I'm not
afraid.

976
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,760
That's about fearlessness

977
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,390
is first coming to terms with the fact 
that you are afraid,

978
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:39,600
you are afraid of death,
you are afraid of other people getting 

979
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,760
one up on you.
You are afraid of being alone.

980
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,460
You are afraid of people thinking that 
you're different.

981
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,950
Okay?
Look at it in yourself.

982
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,310
Be aware that that's existing,
that it's.

983
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:54,460
It's happening in your body before it 
even hits your mind.

984
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,960
Now that you're aware of it,
now you can start conquering your fears.

985
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,510
So I say we say it in that book,
for instance,

986
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:06,511
napoleon bonaparte or general patent,
two men who were incredibly brave who 

987
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:10,540
would be on the front line of battle,
take bullets flying past them.

988
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:15,900
These were men who were very afraId in 
the beginning when they first went into 

989
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,171
battle and we're quite ashamed of the 
fear that they saw in themselves and 

990
00:48:19,171 --> 00:48:23,551
they became aware of it and then slowly 
they overcame it by exposing themselves 

991
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,370
to the very thing that they were afraid 
of.

992
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,470
So that's sort of the paradigm you're 
talking about.

993
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:31,770
Becoming aware of the process of these,
these sorts of qualities we don't want 

994
00:48:32,081 --> 00:48:35,140
in ourselves.
Seeing how they operate inside of you.

995
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,610
Instead of saying,
oh,

996
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,340
it's always the other person.
It's not me.

997
00:48:39,341 --> 00:48:41,770
I'm not afraid.
I don't have these problems.

998
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,210
No,
you do have them.

999
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,880
Let's,
let's confront it and let's show you how

1000
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:50,560
you can rationally and in a intellectual
and mindful way.

1001
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:52,120
Overcome.
Overcome them.

1002
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:57,310
Yeah,
because it truly is no managing of 

1003
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:57,310
anything that you're denying.
If you're denying that it exists,

1004
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,730
you cannot manage.
That was well.

1005
00:48:58,731 --> 00:49:02,450
Put two guys are much more eloquent than
I am.

1006
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,720
We take a lot of mushrooms.
Robert grant helps us confront these 

1007
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:07,720
interference.
Ever.

1008
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,450
Taken mushrooms.
Robert?

1009
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:10,910
Yes.
Deep breath.

1010
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:14,570
Of course he has,
but I took a lot of pot.

1011
00:49:14,571 --> 00:49:16,730
That was my drug of choice.
That injustice.

1012
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:17,660
Good?
Yeah.

1013
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,720
Go.
Just talk about a way to show you the 

1014
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,350
fears that you didn't realize you have 
and help you confront them.

1015
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,890
You know these things.
They're really a great mirror to reflect

1016
00:49:27,891 --> 00:49:29,940
upon yourself.
Hallucinogenics.

1017
00:49:29,941 --> 00:49:34,941
I mean,
I think that's one of the great values 

1018
00:49:34,941 --> 00:49:34,941
that it brings is,
you know,

1019
00:49:34,941 --> 00:49:38,581
you don't know exactly what our deepest 
fear is until you do iowasca and then 

1020
00:49:38,581 --> 00:49:38,581
it's like,
oh yeah,

1021
00:49:38,581 --> 00:49:43,481
that's it.
The thing that you've been showing me 

1022
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:43,481
for the last three hours,
I guess I'm most afraid of that.

1023
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:47,830
Well,
the thing with pod is you never knew 

1024
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:49,631
what was going to happen.
You never knew whaT one trip was never 

1025
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:49,631
the same as another.
So you always had like,

1026
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,540
trepidation,
like,

1027
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:52,190
whoa,
this could be really ugly.

1028
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,010
I don't know what's going to happen.
And you had to deal with it.

1029
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,600
How did you do it?
Do it in traditional native american 

1030
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:00,600
setting?

1031
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:00,660
Uh,
no,

1032
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:04,100
no,
I was in berkeley college.

1033
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:09,630
Uh,
we would take the buttons and you take 

1034
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:12,561
off all the little white,
stringy poisonous bits and then you cut 

1035
00:50:13,501 --> 00:50:17,940
it up and you either put it in a shake 
or a peanut butter sandwich and then you

1036
00:50:17,941 --> 00:50:20,810
go find a nice safe place.
Traditional peanut butter sandwich.

1037
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,050
Exactly.
I mean,

1038
00:50:22,051 --> 00:50:23,880
they would eat,
they would eat it.

1039
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,430
They taste horrible.
It's just,

1040
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:30,980
it's not the taste is that consistency 
and unless you're a native american,

1041
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:36,220
it's hard to stomach it,
you're just going to vomit it straight 

1042
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:36,350
up and you don't want to vomit it 
because then you're not going to get the

1043
00:50:36,351 --> 00:50:41,351
trip.
So you got to trick your body into like 

1044
00:50:41,351 --> 00:50:42,440
digesting it and so you have to put it 
in a smoothie.

1045
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,800
If you brominated it doesn't work.
No,

1046
00:50:44,801 --> 00:50:49,801
you're vomiting out immediately.
All of the stuff you just didn't pay 

1047
00:50:49,801 --> 00:50:51,970
attention because it works well if you 
vomit based on the taste,

1048
00:50:51,971 --> 00:50:56,971
it hasn't had time to assault it later 
in the trip based on it trying to clear 

1049
00:50:57,251 --> 00:50:58,810
your body.
that's a different.

1050
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,030
It's already assimilated.
So,

1051
00:51:01,031 --> 00:51:01,840
um,
anyway,

1052
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:07,080
so do you feel like those pod 
experiences help form your view of 

1053
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,080
things?

1054
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,610
Very much so.
Very much so.

1055
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:13,680
And you know,
it just made you kind of put,

1056
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:18,681
connects you to reality where there's 
things where you're just in a fog all 

1057
00:51:19,111 --> 00:51:24,111
the time because we're so conditioned to
think in certain ways and to have 

1058
00:51:24,111 --> 00:51:28,251
something that draws you out of the same
rut of thinking and confront you with 

1059
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,490
really the real world.
This amazing world.

1060
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:32,740
It's aroUnd you,
uh,

1061
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,880
has had a huge influence on my writing 
and I know this next book hasn't been 

1062
00:51:38,611 --> 00:51:43,611
written,
but I have another book after that that 

1063
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:43,611
has not even begun to be even thought of
as written.

1064
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:48,180
And that's going to bring together all 
of my experiences on that level of book,

1065
00:51:48,181 --> 00:51:53,181
on what I call the sublime,
which I've written about in the 50th 

1066
00:51:53,181 --> 00:51:56,781
law.
And we'll write a whole book about at 

1067
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:56,781
one point.

1068
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:57,090
so the 50th law is the one that you 
wrote with fifty cent?

1069
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:00,360
Yes sir.
Now what was the motivation behind that?

1070
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,410
Well,
basically my early books,

1071
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:08,790
meaning the 48 laws,
seduction and war to some extent were 

1072
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:10,740
very popular among hip hop artists.
Yeah.

1073
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,510
Basically because you know,
the music industry,

1074
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:16,040
I described you hollywood.
Well,

1075
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:20,630
hollywood is kind of like kindergarten 
compared to the music business that they

1076
00:52:20,631 --> 00:52:25,631
are.
The real sharks are in the music 

1077
00:52:25,631 --> 00:52:25,850
business.
They are pretty nasty,

1078
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:28,290
pretty machiavellian.
Um,

1079
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,760
and people like 50 jay z and their 
managers in the late nineties,

1080
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:38,570
early two thousands were coming to grasp
with the fact that they,

1081
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:43,750
they wanted to control their own work to
have some power and some money and 

1082
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:48,071
become entrepreneurs and,
and dealing with these sharks in the 

1083
00:52:48,071 --> 00:52:48,640
music business was something that 
nothing,

1084
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:51,950
not even any kind of street life 
prepared them for 50 would tell me.

1085
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:58,150
He hustled on the streets dealing crack,
saw people being knives and killed and 

1086
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:02,950
dealt with a lot of danger and nothing 
prepared him for the sharkey horrific 

1087
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:05,870
games that he saw in the music industry 
with columbia and interscope,

1088
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:06,380
etc.

1089
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:09,820
So they were reading my book to help 
them deal with this.

1090
00:53:09,821 --> 00:53:11,870
They did.
These are not people who went to harvard

1091
00:53:11,871 --> 00:53:16,871
business school,
they didn't have a book out there to 

1092
00:53:16,871 --> 00:53:18,230
help them understand how manipulative 
these people could be.

1093
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:20,180
And so they gravitated the 48 laws of 
power.

1094
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,980
Fifty was one of them and he contacted 
me at some point I think,

1095
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:30,200
oh,
five or six wanting to meet me because 

1096
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,520
he liked the book a lot and then we met 
and we had a really interesting synergy.

1097
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:35,250
Obviously we're not,
we don't come from similar backgrounds.

1098
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:37,440
We don't look alike.
They don't see that on the street.

1099
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:43,250
I'm from history,
but I'm not the street or you're born in

1100
00:53:43,351 --> 00:53:45,780
the field.
Everybody's born from the street.

1101
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:47,490
Uh,
I'm uh,

1102
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,270
you know,
I come from a middle class jew,

1103
00:53:49,271 --> 00:53:51,540
jewish background,
so I'm not quite the same as,

1104
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,340
you know,
south side queens.

1105
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,940
But uh,
but we had a really nice energy 

1106
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:58,940
together.
Like we think alike.

1107
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,630
Like I told you about,
that hollywood director,

1108
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:05,930
most people in hollywood were getting so
angry with him and so angry about the 

1109
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,290
games that they never took a step back 
to figure out,

1110
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:12,320
oh,
this is the strategy that this guy 

1111
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:12,320
applied and 50 was the same way.
He said,

1112
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:17,420
I took a step back and said,
this is what the guide in her scope is 

1113
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,380
really doing.
So we thought alike and we thought let's

1114
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:22,440
bring two minds together that think 
alike,

1115
00:54:22,441 --> 00:54:24,990
but from totally different backgrounds 
and see what happens.

1116
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,510
Fascinating.
The,

1117
00:54:26,511 --> 00:54:31,511
um,
the music business for folks who don't 

1118
00:54:31,511 --> 00:54:31,511
know,
it's been a,

1119
00:54:31,511 --> 00:54:35,570
it's really a fascinating operation and 
it's kinda been gutted because of the 

1120
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:41,110
mp3 influx and napster was the first 
blow.

1121
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:46,111
And then from there it's like,
really now it's kind of interesting 

1122
00:54:46,111 --> 00:54:49,471
because the performers actually make 
their money from performing more than 

1123
00:54:49,471 --> 00:54:52,090
anything else.
It's very difficult to make the millions

1124
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:54,880
and millions of dollars that the rolling
stones and what have you.

1125
00:54:54,881 --> 00:54:58,010
All those bands in the past made from 
selling records.

1126
00:54:58,011 --> 00:54:58,920
he,
there's not really that,

1127
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,030
that doesn't exist anymore in the same 
way.

1128
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:06,510
But courtney love wrote a piece about.
I'm sure she probably didn't really 

1129
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:07,600
write it.
Probably they said it was ghost written.

1130
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,770
I agree.
It's pretty fucking smart.

1131
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:12,010
And I've smart woman.
Yeah.

1132
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:12,730
Okay.
I believe you,

1133
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,950
but I don't know,
maybe not anyway,

1134
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,600
whether she.
Let's say she wrote it.

1135
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:17,130
Okay.

1136
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,580
Let's say she wrote it.
It's,

1137
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,530
it's insane.
If you've ever read it,

1138
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:25,710
that piece that she wrote on the music 
business and how it really works and how

1139
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:29,680
they extract everything from your 
profits,

1140
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:31,720
everything,
promotion,

1141
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:34,930
expenses,
all these different things.

1142
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,540
By the time the artist gets paid for the
records,

1143
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,800
they have all this weird way of doing 
math where it shows like no money,

1144
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:47,550
no money has been made and they use that
for not just the music business but 

1145
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:51,511
hollywood trudeau.
I have a friend who produced a 

1146
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:54,691
television show and it's a very 
successful television show and it's not 

1147
00:55:54,691 --> 00:55:57,991
just,
can you stop doing that start crunching 

1148
00:55:57,991 --> 00:55:57,991
thing,
sorry.

1149
00:55:57,991 --> 00:56:01,120
It's really distracting.
The television shows not just successful

1150
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:04,510
nationwide.
It's syndicated across the world and the

1151
00:56:04,511 --> 00:56:09,511
company that made this show,
the production company is claiming that 

1152
00:56:09,511 --> 00:56:10,930
it doesn't turn a profit.
I mean,

1153
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,200
I'm not talking about one country,
it's in 16 different countries and 

1154
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,910
there's like several versions of it with
different hosts all throughout the world

1155
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:24,240
and they're trying to tell him that it's
not always suing them and there's like 

1156
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:24,240
this crazy fucking lost.

1157
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,080
Lawsuits are just course for business.
It doesn't even scare.

1158
00:56:27,081 --> 00:56:29,240
It doesn't even make people bad an eye 
in those industries,

1159
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,740
but it's pretty sad.
It's weird,

1160
00:56:30,741 --> 00:56:33,230
like how has it not making a profit?
Did you get paid?

1161
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,210
Did you get paid?
like where's there's got to be a fucking

1162
00:56:38,211 --> 00:56:40,130
profit here because there's all this 
money,

1163
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:44,750
like a movie that can make $100,000,000
can be said to have turned no profit.

1164
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,560
Yeah.
Wow.

1165
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,140
That's bizarre.
Where's that money going to?

1166
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,880
But this fuckery,
this,

1167
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:57,910
these shenanigans are sort of a lot of 
the stuff that you're talking about in 

1168
00:56:58,281 --> 00:56:59,590
48 laws.
Yep.

1169
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,670
Yeah.
Courtney love was a big reader of the 48

1170
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:08,671
laws of power.
She used it in one of her lawsuits 

1171
00:57:08,671 --> 00:57:09,580
against the music industry.
She held up a copy of the book and said,

1172
00:57:09,581 --> 00:57:11,440
this is what you guys are using against 
us.

1173
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:16,550
You bad motherfucker according lab.
Did you ever see that documentary that 

1174
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:18,240
claims that she killed kurt cobain or 
had kurt cobain killed?

1175
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,640
No.
One of Them was fucking bizarre 

1176
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,171
documentaries ever.
Like someone fucking set out to prove 

1177
00:57:27,171 --> 00:57:29,160
that courtney love was responsible for 
kurt cobain's death.

1178
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:30,120
Oh,
all right.

1179
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:33,480
Are you sure you're not sure?
Yeah.

1180
00:57:33,481 --> 00:57:36,420
That's a pretty fucking crazy statement.
You know?

1181
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:41,660
How can you just.
You can just do that and you can just 

1182
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:41,660
say that.
Yeah.

1183
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:44,650
Nobody tried her for that.
Like can you sue someone who says that 

1184
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:46,380
you're responsible for the suicide of 
your fucking husband.

1185
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:51,270
Awful off track.
Obviously back to the book.

1186
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,510
So this,
this business,

1187
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:59,540
this music business is just an example 
really of what happens when power 

1188
00:57:59,761 --> 00:58:04,761
structures are created.
When people who were in these power 

1189
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:08,421
structures understand the game and then 
take these people that are just coming 

1190
00:58:08,421 --> 00:58:10,980
into it fresh and especially artistic 
types.

1191
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,950
People who are creative,
people who are artistic types,

1192
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:19,160
oftentimes not very good with money,
not not sound financial thinkers,

1193
00:58:19,231 --> 00:58:24,231
and just the opposite of these business 
sharks that are involved in interscope 

1194
00:58:24,231 --> 00:58:26,500
or whatever the whatever the label is,

1195
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:31,310
katie themselves to the mastery of their
craft and this whole other craft.

1196
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:36,330
This business sharkey genus is this 
other whole skillset that it's 

1197
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:37,950
challenging to be able to master both.
You know,

1198
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
so getting the cliff notes is awfully 
helpful to be able to sort that out 

1199
00:58:43,011 --> 00:58:48,011
because that is to be as where they are 
at that point and obviously he'll go 

1200
00:58:48,501 --> 00:58:53,501
into his book mastery,
but that is a relentless pursuit of 

1201
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:57,581
excellence in a well defined niche that 
doesn't allow for a lot of time to 

1202
00:58:57,581 --> 00:59:00,950
explore these other things unless you 
know you're forming some bridge.

1203
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:03,440
If you were going to recommend your 
books to someone,

1204
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:05,450
what,
what order would you recommend them in?

1205
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:10,510
Well,
it depends on what business you're in 

1206
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:10,510
and what point you are in life.
Okay.

1207
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:10,510
How about you?

1208
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:10,680
How about me?
I'm a comedian.

1209
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:11,430
Yeah.
Which I do

1210
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,230
you,
you who are already so successful.

1211
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:20,080
Well probably mastery in some ways 
because maybe it'll take you to the next

1212
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:25,081
level,
but I don't know if you're dealing with 

1213
00:59:25,081 --> 00:59:25,081
a

1214
00:59:25,081 --> 00:59:25,081
lot of political stuff.
If you are,

1215
00:59:25,081 --> 00:59:27,830
then you're going to want 48 laws or 
maybe the strategies of war.

1216
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,050
Uh,
it depends on who you are,

1217
00:59:30,051 --> 00:59:32,630
what your weaknesses are,
what your strengths are,

1218
00:59:32,631 --> 00:59:37,631
where you are in life.
If you're 22 years old and you're just 

1219
00:59:37,631 --> 00:59:39,140
graduating college and you're about to 
enter the real world,

1220
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:44,420
um,
I'd say mastery for reasons that maybe 

1221
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:44,420
will.
Hopefully we'll get into a.

1222
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:47,330
But if you're a 25 and you're now 
working at goldman sachs,

1223
00:59:47,331 --> 00:59:49,810
god bless you.
If you are ever saved you,

1224
00:59:49,811 --> 00:59:53,810
I think you're gonna probably want the 
48 laws of power because man,

1225
00:59:53,811 --> 00:59:56,060
that's a power hungry,
nasty,

1226
00:59:56,061 --> 00:59:57,950
manipulative,
machiavellian environment.

1227
00:59:57,951 --> 01:00:02,951
If you're in the music industry as well,
if you're a person leaves a fairy 

1228
01:00:02,951 --> 01:00:06,101
afraid,
you've got all sorts of great creative 

1229
01:00:06,101 --> 01:00:08,111
ideas,
but you're never going to the next step 

1230
01:00:08,111 --> 01:00:08,120
and starting that great movie or project
you have,

1231
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:13,300
maybe the 50th law would be good for you
so you can get over some of those fears 

1232
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:13,300
that are holding you back.

1233
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,950
If you're some guy who just can't find 
a,

1234
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,890
you know,
ken is really bad with women.

1235
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:24,210
Art of seduction,
obviously it would probably be just so 

1236
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:26,380
it depends a little bit on who you are.
Now you wrote the artists deduction to 

1237
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:26,380
help people get laid.
Is that the idea of.

1238
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,650
No,
I didn't know.

1239
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:32,710
I know it sound great.
I know I probably have 8 million people 

1240
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,790
buying the book tomorrow and now I'm 
only going to get like 15,

1241
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,480
but the truth of the matter is artists 
deduction is about how to seduce people,

1242
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:42,110
how to get them to like you or love you.
It's all about creating a spell,

1243
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:46,190
so if you want to just get laid,
you know,

1244
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,170
maybe neil strauss or the pickup 
artists,

1245
01:00:48,171 --> 01:00:51,860
that's probably more your speed.
It's got all sorts of gimmicks about how

1246
01:00:51,861 --> 01:00:55,910
to sell a woman's something in a bar and
melt her resistance and etc.

1247
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:00,350
I'm more about the longterm,
how you can take that woman or it can be

1248
01:01:00,351 --> 01:01:04,670
a woman seducing a man obviously and get
and play a mind game on her.

1249
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,420
So in the course of three months,
she doesn't want to just sleep with you.

1250
01:01:08,421 --> 01:01:11,210
She wants to give you everything she 
has.

1251
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:16,040
She creating stalkers a could be and I 
have and I'm afraid I'm ashamed of it,

1252
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:19,640
but more likely I don't believe you at 
all.

1253
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,540
When you say I'm ashamed of it,
you're fucking proud of that shit.

1254
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:24,220
I said,
oh,

1255
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,830
I don't like stalkers because really the
book is about casting a spell.

1256
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:29,910
Okay.
You know,

1257
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,330
let's say,
let's say this is the goal of seduction.

1258
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:36,550
When that woman leaves you after the 
whatever night you had together,

1259
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,630
the date or whatever,
or just an encounter,

1260
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:41,510
she's going home and thinking about you.
Okay,

1261
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:43,380
now you're starting to seducer you.

1262
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,560
It's a mind game.
It's a mental thing.

1263
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:51,040
We humans are sex drive and our mental 
process are really interconnected and 

1264
01:01:52,191 --> 01:01:57,191
I'm kidding you to play on that and you 
play on psychology and melting other 

1265
01:01:57,191 --> 01:02:01,691
people's resistance is getting them to 
lower their guard because everybody's 

1266
01:02:01,691 --> 01:02:03,950
very got their guard up constantly.
Particularly in this modern world.

1267
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:07,820
Nobody is opening up to you or nobody 
wants to show vulnerability.

1268
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:12,170
It's just you're just dealing with a 
million porcupines out there showing you

1269
01:02:12,171 --> 01:02:17,171
how to get those resistance levels down 
and give room to finagle your way into 

1270
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:20,010
their head.
And the converse

1271
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,120
of course too,
you know,

1272
01:02:21,121 --> 01:02:26,121
which is a lot of people are getting 
these things played upon them 

1273
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:26,160
constantly.
And again,

1274
01:02:26,161 --> 01:02:31,161
it goes back to the same thing.
If you're not aware of the tactics that 

1275
01:02:31,161 --> 01:02:34,791
somebody is using,
you know you're defenseless against 

1276
01:02:34,791 --> 01:02:37,521
them,
you're just completely vulnerable and 

1277
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:39,150
you'll get sucked into this lure of this
spell that they're creating by this push

1278
01:02:39,151 --> 01:02:43,350
pull tactic that they're using and 
whatever strategy that they're using and

1279
01:02:43,351 --> 01:02:48,351
you'll just be helpless to it.
And you see guys fall for these all the 

1280
01:02:48,351 --> 01:02:48,351
time.
You know,

1281
01:02:48,351 --> 01:02:50,610
it's something that bums me in you out 
personally a lot.

1282
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:55,611
When we see friends and people we love 
caught in this spell that someone's 

1283
01:02:55,611 --> 01:03:00,111
woven where they can't let go despite so
many other things going bad in their 

1284
01:03:00,111 --> 01:03:04,761
life.
They're just trapped in it and reading 

1285
01:03:04,761 --> 01:03:04,761
something like the artist's deduction 
says,

1286
01:03:04,761 --> 01:03:09,230
oh,
she's using law number seven as her 

1287
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:11,490
primary means and 13 and 17 and now I 
see you now.

1288
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:12,840
I got you a bitch.
You know,

1289
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:15,870
like you can switch it back and say,
okay,

1290
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,270
now what do I want?
Do I want to keep you around?

1291
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,270
Do I want to or do I want to just 
release myself,

1292
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,770
you know,
remove these hooks,

1293
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,840
these invisible hooks that you've 
created,

1294
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:27,360
and just be free to chart my own course.
Well,

1295
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:27,960
thank you all for you.

1296
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:33,500
I find that a lot of people enjoy the 
struggle of relationship struggle 

1297
01:03:33,891 --> 01:03:35,750
because it distracts them from their own
life,

1298
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:41,190
just distracts rama,
distract them from their shortcomings 

1299
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,700
and achieving their goals.
They put up obstacles almost on purpose.

1300
01:03:43,701 --> 01:03:48,701
They create these inner personal 
relationships that are going to ensure 

1301
01:03:48,701 --> 01:03:51,590
conflict so they don't have to deal with
success,

1302
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:56,830
so they don't have to deal with a fee.
They have like a built in excuse for 

1303
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:57,810
failure.
Yeah.

1304
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,250
That's very common.
Yep.

1305
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:05,240
Freud called that air full angst.
I'm basically.

1306
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,700
That means fear of success,
which is something I talk a lot about in

1307
01:04:08,701 --> 01:04:08,870
my book.

1308
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:09,760
That's real,
right?

1309
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:14,170
It sounds like it sounds ridiculous.
It sounds like an oxymoron,

1310
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:15,670
but it's real.

1311
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:17,500
Yep.
That's a main main.

1312
01:04:17,501 --> 01:04:22,501
One of the main points in mastery about 
mastery is basically a book that's 

1313
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:28,200
trying to get away from all of the 
political stuff I've described in my 

1314
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,681
previous books,
and here I'm going to show you how we 

1315
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:31,681
humans can attain excellence in this 
world,

1316
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:36,601
how we can be really,
really the best at what we do because I 

1317
01:04:36,601 --> 01:04:40,590
think that's the highest form of power 
we humans can reach when we're so good 

1318
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:45,571
at what we do,
then all the political games in the 

1319
01:04:45,571 --> 01:04:46,050
world can't topple us from where we are.
Um,

1320
01:04:46,051 --> 01:04:51,051
and what holds a lot of people back is 
that they're really self sabotaging,

1321
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:56,050
their finding all kinds of excuses why 
they can't go through this process.

1322
01:04:56,870 --> 01:05:00,430
They believe in the myth that people are
born talented,

1323
01:05:00,431 --> 01:05:05,431
are geniuses,
are simply born that way or that they 

1324
01:05:05,431 --> 01:05:07,750
didn't get to go to the right school 
where their parents were mean to them or

1325
01:05:07,751 --> 01:05:10,400
yada yada yada.
Or my girlfriend is that,

1326
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:11,260
you know,
whatever.

1327
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,110
As you said,
they get involved in drama games that.

1328
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:16,450
So fill up their mind that can't think 
of anything else.

1329
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,060
So I'm going to make you

1330
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:23,060
as this book as well aware of what's 
holding you back and these fears that 

1331
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,490
you're using to sabotage yourself.

1332
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:28,600
That is one of the most frustrating 
things to me when I'm talking to someone

1333
01:05:28,601 --> 01:05:31,970
and they have these built in excuses for
why they can't do what they want to do.

1334
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,010
Give me some of these excuses that you 
hear.

1335
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:39,080
Well,
I have a friend who wanted to be a 

1336
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:39,080
comedian.
He wound up not being a comedian.

1337
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:40,590
He doesn't have children,
he doesn't have a wife,

1338
01:05:40,591 --> 01:05:42,540
doesn't have a mortgage,
so he's not.

1339
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:47,600
It's not like he has this job that he 
has these responsibilities to feed his 

1340
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:47,600
family.
So he stuck in his job,

1341
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:49,230
but he was like,
well,

1342
01:05:49,231 --> 01:05:50,240
you know what man,
I.

1343
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:53,040
I've missed the boat with comedy.
If I had started in the nineties,

1344
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:53,940
everything would've been great.
I go,

1345
01:05:53,941 --> 01:05:56,680
what are you talking about?
Is people that start right now?

1346
01:05:56,681 --> 01:05:58,260
There's,
there's open mics right now.

1347
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:03,410
Good.
The tuesday night to the laugh factory 

1348
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:03,410
is a fucking line around the block.
They get there at 9:00

1349
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:03,810
AM and they wait in line.
You should do that too.

1350
01:06:03,811 --> 01:06:05,630
If you want to do comedy.
A mannequin,

1351
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:06,660
do that.
I'm 30 years old.

1352
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,690
Do you think the orion gives a shit and 
how old you are?

1353
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:12,360
Man,
the line has no idea about your age.

1354
01:06:12,361 --> 01:06:17,361
The line is there.
The microphone is on for an 80 year old 

1355
01:06:17,361 --> 01:06:20,241
man.
If an 80 year old man talks in that 

1356
01:06:20,241 --> 01:06:20,490
microphone,
it makes noise just like a baby.

1357
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:23,940
If a baby cries into that microphone,
it also makes noise like,

1358
01:06:23,941 --> 01:06:25,110
what are you talking about?
And they're like,

1359
01:06:25,111 --> 01:06:27,060
he and I got into this crazy debate 
about.

1360
01:06:27,061 --> 01:06:27,690
He's like,
look man,

1361
01:06:27,691 --> 01:06:29,730
it's easy for you to say you're already 
successful.

1362
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,020
I'm like,
look dude,

1363
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:36,080
it's not easy for me to say.
It's hard for me to hear because you're 

1364
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:39,831
fucking yourself.
You're you want to be a comedian and if 

1365
01:06:39,831 --> 01:06:39,900
you think you're funny,
and by the way,

1366
01:06:39,901 --> 01:06:44,901
you don't even really have to be funny.
You just have to have the ability to 

1367
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:46,080
figure out how to become funny and that 
self analysis,

1368
01:06:46,081 --> 01:06:48,660
objectivity and work,
that's what it is,

1369
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:52,590
but you are already creating this 
insurmountable barrier.

1370
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:54,000
You didn't start in the nineties,
like,

1371
01:06:54,001 --> 01:06:55,530
what are you fucking talking about it

1372
01:06:55,820 --> 01:07:00,820
in the book mastery,
I interviewed nine modern masters to 

1373
01:07:01,421 --> 01:07:06,421
sort of embed them in months.
All the ancient masters that I talk 

1374
01:07:06,421 --> 01:07:08,440
about and one of the nine modern masters
I interviewed as a woman named temple.

1375
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,880
Granted,
I don't know if you've heard of her.

1376
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,000
No,
to emigrate and it's like a very famous 

1377
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,350
animal behavior scientist.
um,

1378
01:07:15,351 --> 01:07:20,351
and she was born with autism and at the 
age of two was basically going to be put

1379
01:07:20,501 --> 01:07:25,501
in a mental institution for the rest of 
her life because she was a severe 

1380
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:26,110
autistic.
She couldn't learn language.

1381
01:07:26,111 --> 01:07:31,111
He was just the kind of kid you see.
It was just banging their head against 

1382
01:07:31,111 --> 01:07:32,380
the wall.
She was severely autistic.

1383
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:37,740
And through a process I describe in the 
book with her mother's help and the 

1384
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:41,851
speech therapist,
she slowly got to the age of four to be 

1385
01:07:41,851 --> 01:07:42,310
able to start speaking and going to 
schools.

1386
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:47,170
And I show the process that eventually 
led her to become a great scientist.

1387
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:50,440
Now,
if somebody's born with severe autism,

1388
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:53,260
at the age of two is going to be 
institutionalized for their whole life,

1389
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:58,470
can become a master,
then there's no fucking excuse for some 

1390
01:07:58,470 --> 01:08:02,440
30 year old who has nothing,
no barriers like that at all to ever get

1391
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:07,441
to that point.
It's really the reason I put it in 

1392
01:08:07,441 --> 01:08:07,441
there.
If any.

1393
01:08:07,441 --> 01:08:09,080
If somebody like that can overcome their
limitations and there's no more excuses.

1394
01:08:09,081 --> 01:08:09,150
Okay,

1395
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,470
well there is one excuse.
He's a weak bitch.

1396
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:17,060
Well,
that's the excuse and my eyes don't be 

1397
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:17,060
weak,
bitch.

1398
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,170
It's so simple.
Break it down to that.

1399
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,680
Yeah.
My other advice that I always give out 

1400
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:24,020
is be the person that you pretend to be 
when you're trying to get laid.

1401
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,400
If you can Just do that and just be that
guy,

1402
01:08:28,401 --> 01:08:30,890
what would that guy be?
That guy and let it become you.

1403
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:32,990
That was something I never covered in 
the artist seduction.

1404
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,760
Damn.
Be the person.

1405
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:40,360
Be the hero of your own movIe.
that's the other thing I say to people 

1406
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:40,360
when people were there,
feel like their life.

1407
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:42,740
Pretend you're a fucking loser in A 
movie.

1408
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:46,490
You woke up today the same scenarios.
You always see guy wakes up,

1409
01:08:46,491 --> 01:08:49,280
makes a fucking blender full of pizza or
whatever they do,

1410
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:54,500
you know,
get their life together and smoke a 

1411
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:54,500
cigarette and realize that you're a 
failure.

1412
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,370
You're,
you're the bills are piling up.

1413
01:08:55,371 --> 01:08:57,440
The phone's ringing off the hook from 
bill collectors.

1414
01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:00,080
What would the hero in the movie do 
right now?

1415
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:03,230
Do that shit and it works.
It works at some people,

1416
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,330
other people that find excuses to not do
it.

1417
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:06,120
I got that

1418
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:09,710
vice from a,
from a family friend one time and I was.

1419
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:12,980
I was terrible at dating until I was 
about 22 or so,

1420
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,120
21.
I was awful.

1421
01:09:14,121 --> 01:09:19,121
I was way too nice.
It was so doting and it wasn't even the 

1422
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:19,730
real me.
I was just being playing this overnights

1423
01:09:19,731 --> 01:09:23,680
person and people hated it.
It was the most repulsive being nice,

1424
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:25,760
the most repulsive thing I could have 
done.

1425
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,150
And so he told me,
he's like,

1426
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:30,470
just analyze your actions and what 
you're saying.

1427
01:09:30,471 --> 01:09:32,180
And ask what would Bruce Willis too

1428
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:34,490
at that time?
At the time it was,

1429
01:09:34,491 --> 01:09:38,320
that's who is like the big action hero 
or whatever.

1430
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:40,600
My advice That helped changed the game 
for me.

1431
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:45,660
Stay nice,
but be willing to walk away as soon as 

1432
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:45,820
you expose that someone else is not nice
back,

1433
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:51,270
be nice always,
but then as soon as someone's not nice 

1434
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:51,270
backside.
All right,

1435
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:51,270
good luck.
Take it easy.

1436
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,870
Not need them at all.
If you don't need them to know.

1437
01:09:52,871 --> 01:09:55,450
The problem with nice people is they're 
needy motherfuckers.

1438
01:09:55,780 --> 01:10:00,780
It's not just nice.
The reason why they're being nice is 

1439
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,901
they need you to like them.
You can be really nice and not need 

1440
01:10:03,901 --> 01:10:07,261
people to like you and if they don't 
like you or they didn't want to be 

1441
01:10:07,261 --> 01:10:07,261
around you,
you're fine with it.

1442
01:10:07,261 --> 01:10:09,000
Then they freak out.
They don't know how to handle that.

1443
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:10,540
Like shit,
I missed a nice guy.

1444
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:13,270
He was nice.
It slipped through my fingers.

1445
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:17,590
Personal sovereignty.
It's one of the most important things to

1446
01:10:17,591 --> 01:10:20,980
have in this life.
The ability to be yourself,

1447
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:26,160
to be by yourself and why would other 
people like you if you don't even like 

1448
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:30,481
yourself.
You got to do things in life that you 

1449
01:10:30,481 --> 01:10:33,991
would admire.
You got to be the kind of person that 

1450
01:10:33,991 --> 01:10:35,200
you would like and if you're not,
why would you expect anyone to like you?

1451
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:40,650
I have this argument with guys all the 
time where the talk about women and you 

1452
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:42,160
know,
the fucking girls want money.

1453
01:10:42,161 --> 01:10:43,990
They want this,
they want that.

1454
01:10:43,991 --> 01:10:45,220
You know,
women always like,

1455
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:45,930
you know,
I just,

1456
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,040
I'm not so good with women's.
I always say this,

1457
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:53,110
would you fuck you?
Fuck you.

1458
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:59,030
How dare you,
you know,

1459
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,970
it's not just physical,
it's mental.

1460
01:11:00,971 --> 01:11:03,940
It's the way you behave.
Or are you a kind of person?

1461
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:07,600
Are you fun to be around?
There are people that are just genuinely

1462
01:11:07,601 --> 01:11:09,480
great to be around.
You know,

1463
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:11,230
they don't have to be good looking,
you know,

1464
01:11:11,231 --> 01:11:13,060
they don't have to be,
they don't have to be,

1465
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:13,980
they don't have to be

1466
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,380
well read,
they just have a quality.

1467
01:11:16,381 --> 01:11:21,381
They have quality.
And do you not have that quality and if 

1468
01:11:21,381 --> 01:11:21,381
you don't have that quality,
can you,

1469
01:11:21,381 --> 01:11:22,140
can you acquire it?

1470
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:25,540
Well,
what I try to do in our seduction is a.

1471
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:29,200
I'm saying people who read a book and 
try to seduce,

1472
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:33,870
so usually the worst seducers or who've 
taken some advice because they're not in

1473
01:11:33,871 --> 01:11:35,540
the moment.
Um,

1474
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:40,480
and there seemed like they're kind of 
being cold and calculating and the trick

1475
01:11:40,481 --> 01:11:45,481
to seduction is to appear or to be as 
natural as possible and to at least 

1476
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:46,120
appear natural.
Um,

1477
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:51,260
so everybody has a different style.
Some people are funny and great to be 

1478
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:52,740
around,
but maybe you're just not born that way.

1479
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:54,820
Maybe you're just not widi.
Uh,

1480
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,490
maybe you,
but you have other strengths.

1481
01:11:56,491 --> 01:12:00,420
You have other qualities,
something naturally seductive about you.

1482
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:04,410
Um,
that could be you're very social and you

1483
01:12:04,411 --> 01:12:09,411
know,
you can think about what the other 

1484
01:12:09,411 --> 01:12:09,411
person wants.
It could be.

1485
01:12:09,411 --> 01:12:11,460
I have one of the types in the,
in the book.

1486
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:14,670
Maybe you do have coquettish qualities.
What does that mean?

1487
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:16,560
You can blow hot and cold

1488
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,160
coquettish ooh,
new word.

1489
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:19,750
Cocaine,
cocaine,

1490
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:20,730
reddish.
Never,

1491
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:22,180
never heard anybody say that.
Tree.

1492
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:23,830
French coquette.
Isn't that amazing?

1493
01:12:23,831 --> 01:12:27,160
You could live 46 years on this world.
I've taught you several words.

1494
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,840
You have.
Thank you so much.

1495
01:12:28,841 --> 01:12:32,290
Crypto.
Contemplate a favorite word.

1496
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:37,390
Everything you're free to use it,
use it,

1497
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:40,510
announced in the world that kind of what
you're saying,

1498
01:12:40,511 --> 01:12:43,180
it kind of reminds me of what you talk 
about it,

1499
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:44,510
but go ahead.
Sorry.

1500
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:45,670
No,
go ahead.

1501
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:48,850
You can finish what it reminds me a 
little bit of what you're talking about.

1502
01:12:48,851 --> 01:12:52,060
In mastery of going with your natural 
inclination,

1503
01:12:52,061 --> 01:12:55,780
that is going to be the best thing.
Like going with that vocation.

1504
01:12:55,781 --> 01:12:58,540
Whatever makes you that unique 
individual,

1505
01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:01,660
it's almost the same and seduction as it
is in mastery,

1506
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:05,770
pursuing that channel,
that venue of what is going to bring you

1507
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:10,800
out,
your highest qualities is going to lead 

1508
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:10,800
to the greatest success.
No matter what it is.

1509
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,440
SedUction or mastery.
Yeah,

1510
01:13:11,441 --> 01:13:11,980
I've tried.
I make

1511
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:16,980
the point in mastery that you have.
You're born with a key to success.

1512
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,980
Every single human being is born that 
way.

1513
01:13:20,981 --> 01:13:25,981
I'm not tried.
This isn't some new age bullshit that 

1514
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:26,770
I'm trying to pedal here.
What that key is,

1515
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:27,900
the fact that you're,
you,

1516
01:13:27,901 --> 01:13:29,710
you're,
there's something unique about you.

1517
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:31,000
Uh,
your,

1518
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:34,360
your dna is unique.
Your brain is wired in a unique way.

1519
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:39,660
They've done these really interesting 
studies on newborns and infants one 

1520
01:13:40,421 --> 01:13:45,421
month to six months and they've been 
able to show that an extremely early 

1521
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:49,890
age,
infants are already distinguishing 

1522
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:49,890
between things that they like and don't 
like.

1523
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:54,100
I'm very particular levels like foods 
and colors and sounds,

1524
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:56,950
so when you were really,
really young,

1525
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:59,890
you had what are recalls,
and I call them the book,

1526
01:13:59,891 --> 01:14:01,930
primal inclinations.
These,

1527
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:04,810
there were things you were attracted to 
that are very,

1528
01:14:04,811 --> 01:14:06,880
very unique and distinctive about you.

1529
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:11,170
IT could be sports,
it could be competing and winning.

1530
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:15,250
It could be working with people and 
social situations.

1531
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,350
It could be music.
Whatever it is,

1532
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:23,250
if you're able to stay true to that or 
rediscover it when you're older and 

1533
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:27,870
mine,
what's unique about you and your tastes 

1534
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:27,940
and your way of thinking and your whole 
spirit,

1535
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:30,400
you are going to fucking succeed in this
life.

1536
01:14:30,401 --> 01:14:33,460
You're going to create a business.
You're going to create a book.

1537
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:38,440
Some have a podcast that reflects your 
weirdness,

1538
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:41,800
your uniqueness and people will come to 
you because it's true.

1539
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:44,830
It's authentic and it is nothing else 
out there like it.

1540
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,110
How do you do that?
How do you stay true to that?

1541
01:14:47,111 --> 01:14:49,160
How do you fIgure out what your life's 
task is,

1542
01:14:49,161 --> 01:14:54,161
as I call it?
How do you keep connected to those 

1543
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:55,030
primal inclination set what that's what 
the book mastery is about,

1544
01:14:55,510 --> 01:15:00,510
but you first have to be at least aware 
of what the root of your possible 

1545
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:04,981
success in life is,
and I try to make the point that if you 

1546
01:15:04,981 --> 01:15:08,101
aren't pursuing something that's 
personally and emotionally connected to 

1547
01:15:08,101 --> 01:15:12,091
you,
you're never going to actually succeed 

1548
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:12,091
in life.

1549
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,300
If you go into law and you are meant to 
be a writer,

1550
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:18,480
you might be able to bullshit your way 
for 10 years or so and be a pretty good 

1551
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,811
lawyer,
but eventually because it's not 

1552
01:15:21,811 --> 01:15:22,600
something you were meant to do,
you're going to disconnect.

1553
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:25,480
You're not going to be into it.
You're going to emotionally disengage.

1554
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:28,630
You're going to start drinking.
Your hair's gonna fall out.

1555
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:30,270
You're gonna.
Start seeing hookers

1556
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:31,820
getting on drugs.
Wait a minute.

1557
01:15:31,821 --> 01:15:33,000
Wait a minute.
You were good.

1558
01:15:33,001 --> 01:15:34,620
Up until that point.
I lost ya.

1559
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,490
Well,
because you're not

1560
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:39,690
pursuing what you were meant to pursue 
and your life's going to fall apart.

1561
01:15:39,691 --> 01:15:39,970
You're not

1562
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:43,150
have a good time with hookers and drugs.
Well,

1563
01:15:43,151 --> 01:15:45,520
you can.
I see.

1564
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:47,290
That was.
You're right.

1565
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:49,690
I probably lost you there.
People are probably going.

1566
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:54,691
That's what I really want to mastery is 
you become a lawyer when you're really 

1567
01:15:55,330 --> 01:16:00,330
supposed to be a writer.
Then you get hookers and drugs and 

1568
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:00,700
hookers and drugs are fun.
No,

1569
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:02,560
no,
no.

1570
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:03,720
I'm just playing.
I,

1571
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:08,890
I fully see what you're doing.
And I do think that that is a very 

1572
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:11,320
important point that people do sabotage 
when they're unhappy.

1573
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:14,440
And I find a lot of people that tend to 
work jobs,

1574
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:19,450
they find very unrewarding to be 
exceptionally materialistic because 

1575
01:16:19,691 --> 01:16:24,691
they're trying to reward themselves with
these material items in these material 

1576
01:16:24,691 --> 01:16:26,350
items.
Become goals for plowing through another

1577
01:16:26,351 --> 01:16:28,690
daY doing this shitty job.
So

1578
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:33,850
it's a real dead end.
That's like one of the worst traps that 

1579
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:33,850
people fall into.
Now.

1580
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:35,510
I have nothing against money.
I like making money.

1581
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:39,260
Um,
but the goal of your life when you're in

1582
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:40,790
your twenties,
for instAnce,

1583
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:45,560
should be learning as much as possible.
Developing skills in differenT areas and

1584
01:16:45,561 --> 01:16:48,170
not worrying about how much money you're
making,

1585
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:51,080
giving yourself the freedom to make 
mistakes,

1586
01:16:51,081 --> 01:16:53,030
to explore,
to have some adventures,

1587
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:56,000
to try things out that don't quite work 
for you.

1588
01:16:56,150 --> 01:17:01,150
And then when you reach your thirties,
you've got all these skills and 

1589
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,150
experiences and you're going to make 
that money eventually.

1590
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:06,350
But the path to mastery,
you look at somebody like steve jobs,

1591
01:17:06,351 --> 01:17:08,780
you can hate them or you can like him.
You can think he's great or not,

1592
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:14,140
but he ended up being one of the 
wealthiest men that ever existed in on 

1593
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:14,140
our planet.

1594
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,590
Um,
he never thought about money.

1595
01:17:15,591 --> 01:17:18,190
He never cared about it.
He lived in a,

1596
01:17:18,191 --> 01:17:21,290
in a house that was hardly decorated.
He just,

1597
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:22,120
you know,
it was just,

1598
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:25,580
was never on his hierarchy of values to 
quote maslow there.

1599
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:29,180
So if you're,
if you're obsessed with money,

1600
01:17:29,181 --> 01:17:32,180
you're actually going to find all sorts 
of problems in life.

1601
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,340
you're going to become hooked to that 
paycheck.

1602
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:39,580
Let's say you're 32 years old and 
suddenly you're downsized or you're 

1603
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,990
fired from your job and you've been 
addicted to that $80,000.

1604
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:46,991
100,000
dollars a years that you've been 

1605
01:17:46,991 --> 01:17:47,450
getting,
now you don't have the mental freedom to

1606
01:17:47,451 --> 01:17:51,770
take a job for half that price where you
can now maybe start learning some skills

1607
01:17:51,771 --> 01:17:56,771
and moving on and really finding your 
way because you're addicted to all that 

1608
01:17:56,771 --> 01:18:01,361
luxury to the things,
into the ego that you have connected to 

1609
01:18:01,361 --> 01:18:01,361
that paycheck.

1610
01:18:01,361 --> 01:18:06,130
So money is one of the worst chaps and 
the reason people get into that trap 

1611
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:07,880
generally is because of their parents.
Their parents tell them,

1612
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:09,620
johnny,
susan,

1613
01:18:09,621 --> 01:18:11,720
I have whatever your name is.
You've got to make a living.

1614
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:12,530
You gotta,
you gotta,

1615
01:18:12,531 --> 01:18:14,040
go get a job.
That's luca.

1616
01:18:14,041 --> 01:18:15,710
If you've got to become a doctor or a 
lawyer,

1617
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:21,040
you know,
you got to go to yale and get this 

1618
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:21,040
degree and go into the business school,
et cetera,

1619
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,250
and then you're not listening to 
yourself.

1620
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:24,670
You're lIstening to other people in 
their and their values.

1621
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:27,200
So you call that a counterforce in the 
book.

1622
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:32,201
It's things that work against you and to
pushing work against you from finding 

1623
01:18:32,201 --> 01:18:36,671
what you call your vocation,
which is like what is going to make you 

1624
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:38,900
the most happy and doing and being and 
when you're in your vocation versus just

1625
01:18:38,901 --> 01:18:39,560
doing a work.

1626
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:42,140
When you're in your vocation,
your passionate about it,

1627
01:18:42,141 --> 01:18:47,141
you love what you're doing and so you're
going to naturally be more inclined to 

1628
01:18:47,141 --> 01:18:49,100
be great at it because you're going to 
put way more energy,

1629
01:18:49,101 --> 01:18:50,630
way more passionate into it.
I mean,

1630
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:55,631
think about the people who have achieved
greatness and in any different field.

1631
01:18:56,211 --> 01:18:57,520
All the people we know,
you know,

1632
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:59,900
even the bowhunter,
he loves it.

1633
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:04,640
He loves whaT he's doing.
He's found success in doing it,

1634
01:19:04,641 --> 01:19:09,641
but yeah,
he found his vocation and he's just 

1635
01:19:09,641 --> 01:19:09,641
stuck with it and so he's become a 
master,

1636
01:19:09,641 --> 01:19:12,890
but if he was trying to do some legal 
job or some accounting job,

1637
01:19:12,891 --> 01:19:13,570
he would suck.
Suck

1638
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:15,760
at it.
Probably actually has a day job which he

1639
01:19:15,761 --> 01:19:17,290
fucking hates.
And when he describes it,

1640
01:19:17,291 --> 01:19:22,291
he talks about dying there.
Feels like he's dying every day when 

1641
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:22,830
he's at work.
Yeah.

1642
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,370
But yeah,
you're absolutely right.

1643
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,260
Um,
is,

1644
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:30,360
is there a benefit in experiencing that 
resistance early in life so that you 

1645
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:33,190
stay,
you steal your resolve against it?

1646
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:38,370
Which resistance?
The resistance to do what you actually 

1647
01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:38,370
want to do.
I mean,

1648
01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:40,330
I feel like a big part of my motivation 
in life and the,

1649
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:45,390
the strength of my resistance to getting
other people happy or to doing what 

1650
01:19:47,021 --> 01:19:52,021
other people wanted me to do was that I 
was pressured in a way that I didn't 

1651
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:54,500
towards the direction that I didn't want
to go.

1652
01:19:54,501 --> 01:19:56,530
And It was all the course.
Yeah.

1653
01:19:56,531 --> 01:20:01,531
I mean,
one of the things that I would hear all 

1654
01:20:01,531 --> 01:20:04,831
the time when I was starting out and 
stand up is my mom telling me that I 

1655
01:20:04,831 --> 01:20:05,740
wasn't funny.
My mom was like,

1656
01:20:05,741 --> 01:20:07,090
why are you doing this?
You're not funny.

1657
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:07,980
Like this is not a smart.

1658
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:13,530
And I would bite down on my mouthpiece 
and fucking plow forward because of 

1659
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:15,030
that,
because I didn't want.

1660
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,250
I didn't want to hear that.
I didn't want to hear,

1661
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:19,520
finish your college degree,
get a,

1662
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,660
get a normal job.
Stop being a dreamer.

1663
01:20:21,661 --> 01:20:25,620
I didn't want to hear that because I had
heard it and it strengthened my resolve.

1664
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,790
Yeah,
very much so.

1665
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:28,920
It's definitely a theme in the book.
I mean,

1666
01:20:28,921 --> 01:20:33,921
if your path is too easy,
if you just fall out of the womb and 

1667
01:20:33,921 --> 01:20:37,131
suddenly you'll note this is what you 
were meant to do and that 18 year doing 

1668
01:20:37,131 --> 01:20:37,860
it,
you're going to have other problems down

1669
01:20:37,861 --> 01:20:39,630
the road.
It's good to have resistance.

1670
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:43,140
It's good to have people's fucking with 
you and saying you're not good at this,

1671
01:20:43,141 --> 01:20:44,190
et cetera.
Um,

1672
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:46,110
I know,
for instance,

1673
01:20:46,111 --> 01:20:49,470
in my path to writing the 48 laws of 
power,

1674
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:54,680
I kind of knew I wanted to be a writer,
but I went into forms of writing that 

1675
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,420
didn't suit me.
I started off in journalism,

1676
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,760
did that for several years and really 
kind of hated it.

1677
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:02,580
And at one point an editor,
um,

1678
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:05,400
had lunch with me and he pointedly said,
robert,

1679
01:21:05,401 --> 01:21:07,050
you never going to be a good writer.

1680
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:09,870
You just don't have the chemIstry for 
it.

1681
01:21:09,871 --> 01:21:11,970
You're just all over the place.
You're not disciplined.

1682
01:21:11,971 --> 01:21:16,971
maybe go to law school or something.
And that got me out of journalism 

1683
01:21:16,971 --> 01:21:19,200
because I've made me realize I really 
hate the assholes who worked there,

1684
01:21:19,201 --> 01:21:24,201
who was just got to stick up their butt 
and can't think about what real writing 

1685
01:21:24,201 --> 01:21:27,891
might be like.
Got out of that and wandered around 

1686
01:21:27,891 --> 01:21:30,981
europe and tried writing novels and all 
sorts of things that didn't work either 

1687
01:21:30,981 --> 01:21:30,981
that I tried hollywood and I tried 
television.

1688
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:34,860
That through that process I discovered 
what I loved.

1689
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:39,920
When it came to the chance to do a book,
I suddenly the heavens blew open for me.

1690
01:21:39,931 --> 01:21:43,610
Yeah,
a book I can have total control over it.

1691
01:21:43,611 --> 01:21:48,611
There are no assholes telling me coming 
in like in hollywood and changIng 

1692
01:21:48,611 --> 01:21:52,341
everything that I write.
There's no writing for an article for 

1693
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:52,800
one week that disappears.

1694
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,800
I've a book,
but it was only through this process of 

1695
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,981
finding what I hated.
So when people come and tell me I don't 

1696
01:22:00,981 --> 01:22:05,181
know what my vocation is,
I don't know what it is I should be 

1697
01:22:05,181 --> 01:22:05,181
doing.
I often say,

1698
01:22:05,181 --> 01:22:05,940
well,
what is it that you hate?

1699
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:08,760
what are those things in life that you 
don't like?

1700
01:22:08,761 --> 01:22:12,540
what are those jobs that you've had that
suck the life out of you?

1701
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:17,900
They're going to.
They're sort of indications of maybe 

1702
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:20,031
something that you should like.
You don't like working for large groups 

1703
01:22:20,031 --> 01:22:20,640
of people.
You should be an entrepreneur.

1704
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,190
You should be working for yourself.
You're.

1705
01:22:22,191 --> 01:22:24,330
You're shaking your head.
You look very skeptical.

1706
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:24,880
No,
no,

1707
01:22:24,881 --> 01:22:26,510
not at all.
I'm agreeing with you wholeheartedly.

1708
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,100
The total opposite.
Okay,

1709
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:28,990
so I'm like,
no,

1710
01:22:28,991 --> 01:22:29,890
please on.
No,

1711
01:22:29,891 --> 01:22:30,470
no.
I'm just.

1712
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:31,840
Yeah,
so I love it.

1713
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:33,760
You got to have the resistance

1714
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:38,890
and the worst thing that happens are 
people who get successful at 25 and then

1715
01:22:39,411 --> 01:22:44,411
think that they've got the golden touch 
and they don't realize that they don't 

1716
01:22:44,411 --> 01:22:46,220
have the golden touch that,
that they were.

1717
01:22:46,221 --> 01:22:51,221
They were kind of lucky and then they 
keep thinking that they have to repeat 

1718
01:22:51,221 --> 01:22:53,750
the same thing that they did.
Let's say they became a comic at the age

1719
01:22:53,751 --> 01:22:56,450
of 25,
became hugely successful,

1720
01:22:57,410 --> 01:23:00,170
but they didn't have the resistance that
you had.

1721
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:05,680
Now they start not listening to their 
audience or to other people or to their 

1722
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:06,190
who says they're not really

1723
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,320
that funny and they just think 
everything.

1724
01:23:08,321 --> 01:23:09,640
They do,
everything they should.

1725
01:23:09,641 --> 01:23:10,870
It's just wonderful.
By the way,

1726
01:23:10,871 --> 01:23:12,490
that's very common.
Very common.

1727
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,360
That's a huge issue with comics.
Yeah.

1728
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:16,690
A huge issue with comics.
As they become successful,

1729
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:21,691
then they start to suck.
It's a real issue with some of the 

1730
01:23:21,691 --> 01:23:21,900
greats.
I won't name names,

1731
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:24,700
but what happened to woody allen?
I mean he's an older guy,

1732
01:23:24,701 --> 01:23:29,701
but you know,
I disagree with you there because his 

1733
01:23:29,701 --> 01:23:29,701
movies,
his,

1734
01:23:29,701 --> 01:23:30,940
his movies are fucking brilliant,
man.

1735
01:23:30,941 --> 01:23:33,340
Blue jasmine was great.
It was a great movie.

1736
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:36,640
Midnight in paris was fucking fantastic.
It was a really good movie.

1737
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:39,670
I think he's just a crazy pervert and 
then that's the problem.

1738
01:23:39,671 --> 01:23:44,671
I think what we don't like to admit it,
but what fuels woody allen is he likes 

1739
01:23:44,671 --> 01:23:44,671
getting his dick sucked,
you know,

1740
01:23:44,671 --> 01:23:45,790
and he likes.
He's a freak.

1741
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:51,240
You go back and you ever seen woody 
allen's young standup when he was 

1742
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:51,240
hilarious.

1743
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:55,560
He was really good.
I thought he was much funnier back then 

1744
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:55,560
than he is now.
He certainly is,

1745
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,580
but he also wasn't exposed like you is 
now.

1746
01:23:57,790 --> 01:24:00,580
He isn't hated and vilified like he is 
now.

1747
01:24:00,581 --> 01:24:03,220
I mean,
he became a pariah.

1748
01:24:03,221 --> 01:24:05,720
I mean he became like a real freak.
Yeah.

1749
01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:10,210
We were talking before the podcast,
I was saying that the sound of clicking,

1750
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:12,820
I was putting something on twitter and I
was like,

1751
01:24:12,821 --> 01:24:14,710
I'm going to miss that.
If they ever get rid of that,

1752
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:19,920
like the sound of clicking.
It's like so a real rewarding to me or 

1753
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,691
something like that.
Woody allen does all of his typing all 

1754
01:24:24,691 --> 01:24:26,740
of scripts on an old typewriter and the 
way he edits,

1755
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:31,090
he takes pieces of paper and if he 
changes a scene,

1756
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:36,330
he'll print it on a piece of paper and 
then cut it and then staple it to the 

1757
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:37,330
other thing or tape it to the other 
thing.

1758
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:40,300
Like he's like so old school in his 
approach,

1759
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:44,590
he uses the same typewriter that he's 
always used for everything.

1760
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:49,770
Yeah.
Well it's probably because he's fucking 

1761
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:51,340
terrified to go on the internet if he 
googles woody allen is a.

1762
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,370
I mean,
you know,

1763
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:54,780
whoever you are,
jesus is a first word,

1764
01:24:54,781 --> 01:24:55,780
is going to be con.
You know,

1765
01:24:55,781 --> 01:24:57,670
if jesus ever gets online and googles 
his name,

1766
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:03,060
but for woody allen,
I mean the fucking hate and the vitriol 

1767
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:04,150
that that guy must experience on a daily
basis.

1768
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:09,360
Just looking people in the eyes at a 
restaurant must be like really pretty 

1769
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:09,490
fucking intense.
Yeah.

1770
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:12,100
I think that phenomenon that you're 
talking about with comics,

1771
01:25:12,101 --> 01:25:14,470
it applies to pretty much everything.
Athletes,

1772
01:25:14,471 --> 01:25:19,471
entrepreneurs,
because if you use this resistance of 

1773
01:25:19,471 --> 01:25:20,170
your struggling trying to get to the 
top,

1774
01:25:20,171 --> 01:25:21,430
people telling you you're not going to 
make.

1775
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:22,630
You'll never be a champion.

1776
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:25,000
You'll never start on the basketball 
team.

1777
01:25:25,001 --> 01:25:27,700
You'll never do this,
and then once you get there and once you

1778
01:25:27,701 --> 01:25:32,701
achieve that,
that kind of opposing force that allows 

1779
01:25:32,701 --> 01:25:33,850
you to bring out the best can can kind 
of go away.

1780
01:25:33,851 --> 01:25:38,410
It's why it's hard for teams to repeat 
championships and things like that.

1781
01:25:38,411 --> 01:25:40,280
It's,
it's an interesting phenomenon.

1782
01:25:40,281 --> 01:25:45,281
It's almost like you need this kind of 
heat and resistance to create the 

1783
01:25:45,281 --> 01:25:47,410
greatest out of yourself and when that 
goes,

1784
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:50,530
you have to look elsewhere and find it 
and other things.

1785
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:52,210
Yeah.
You can't make steel without fire.

1786
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:57,820
That's right.
I have a story in the book of freddie 

1787
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:00,960
roach.
He was one of the modern masters that I 

1788
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,810
love.
Freddy freddy's amazing guy and the 

1789
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:04,130
story of freddy's really kind of a

1790
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:09,180
a model for mastery in a way and 
basically I'll summarize it quickly.

1791
01:26:09,381 --> 01:26:14,381
He,
his father was a fighter and he got all 

1792
01:26:14,381 --> 01:26:14,381
his boys into boxing and the age of 
four.

1793
01:26:14,381 --> 01:26:19,330
They were already in a ring boxing away 
at the age of four and so matt,

1794
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:24,700
age onward.
Freddy was boxing and an amateur level 

1795
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:25,580
and at one point in high school,
just like your mom,

1796
01:26:25,790 --> 01:26:27,110
his mom said to him,
freddy,

1797
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,810
you're not really very good at boxing.
why are you doing this?

1798
01:26:29,811 --> 01:26:33,470
Your brother is so much better than you.
And I got him really pissed.

1799
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:38,680
So he went back into the gym and he 
started training twice as hard and he 

1800
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,160
suddenly got better than his brother and
not only he started getting really good,

1801
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:43,100
got on the olympic team,
became a professional,

1802
01:26:43,101 --> 01:26:48,101
I think it's around age of 18 or so,
and he had a boxing career as a 

1803
01:26:48,101 --> 01:26:49,850
professional for about eight years and 
he was good,

1804
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:51,320
but he wasn't great.

1805
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:57,040
He was kind of slow and he started 
taking a lot of punches and it had an 

1806
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,510
effect on him.
And finally at the age of 26 people were

1807
01:26:59,511 --> 01:26:59,960
saying,
freddy,

1808
01:26:59,961 --> 01:27:02,540
you better retire.
Something really bad's going to happen.

1809
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:06,530
And so he retired at the age of 26 and 
if you think about it,

1810
01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:10,790
for 22 years,
boxing was his whole life.

1811
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:14,120
That's all he ever did.
And now it's finished.

1812
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:17,900
It's over.
His career is over and it's just,

1813
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:22,550
he's ready to go on a downward spiral to
suicide or something bad.

1814
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:27,740
And he gets a job in vegas as a 
telemarketer because he'd been living in

1815
01:27:27,741 --> 01:27:32,741
vegas and fighting and he's drinking 
heavily and in the day in the daytime 

1816
01:27:32,741 --> 01:27:33,890
because his jobs at night.
And then he goes,

1817
01:27:33,891 --> 01:27:38,891
does it tell me it's,
he's on a fast track to suicide and one 

1818
01:27:38,891 --> 01:27:42,761
day he decides to go back to the gym 
where he used to train under his old 

1819
01:27:42,761 --> 01:27:43,130
trainer eddie fudge.

1820
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:46,430
And he's just watching the fighters.
They're like,

1821
01:27:46,431 --> 01:27:48,500
he used to be trained and he decides,
hey,

1822
01:27:48,501 --> 01:27:50,240
I'm going to maybe help this one guy 
out.

1823
01:27:50,241 --> 01:27:52,070
He's not getting any attention right 
now.

1824
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:55,880
And in that moment he just,
he sort of realizes,

1825
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:58,250
wow,
I like teaching.

1826
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:01,670
Like maybe this is what I was meant to 
be.

1827
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:04,220
and he starts coming back every single 
day.

1828
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:07,730
He's not getting paid.
The trainer isn't hiring him.

1829
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:12,940
He comes on his own and he starts 
helping out the fighters and he slowly 

1830
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:15,920
realizes that training is the ultimate 
job for him.

1831
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:18,020
He loves competition.
he loves winning,

1832
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:21,350
but he doesn't have to take a punch as 
the trainer.

1833
01:28:21,351 --> 01:28:24,020
He can in the training area with his 
large myths,

1834
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:27,320
but no punches to the head.
He can strategize,

1835
01:28:27,321 --> 01:28:28,820
he can win,
he can compete,

1836
01:28:28,821 --> 01:28:33,821
you can do all the mind games that he 
loves and he can give these years of 

1837
01:28:33,821 --> 01:28:33,830
experience.

1838
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:39,130
The reason why I consider this a model 
is it took him a path where he sort of 

1839
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:44,630
looked like he was going downhill where 
there was nothing left for him to do and

1840
01:28:44,631 --> 01:28:49,631
suddenly just a chance encounter,
made him realize what is real task in 

1841
01:28:50,181 --> 01:28:55,181
life was and all that experience that he
had now could be applied to becoming the

1842
01:28:55,791 --> 01:28:58,400
greatest trainer,
a boxing trainer of our era,

1843
01:28:58,401 --> 01:29:01,270
and also a mixed martial arts trainer.
Um,

1844
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:03,840
and so people always say,
well,

1845
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:05,410
you know,
I,

1846
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:08,340
I can't make it.
I don't know what my path is.

1847
01:29:08,341 --> 01:29:09,300
I,
I don't,

1848
01:29:09,301 --> 01:29:11,220
I can't figure it out.
I'm too old,

1849
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:14,760
etc.
It's not a question of what age you are.

1850
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:20,290
This,
you can always take the experiences and 

1851
01:29:20,290 --> 01:29:22,521
mistakes that you've had in life.
And if you still got some guts and 

1852
01:29:22,521 --> 01:29:25,971
you're not a whiner,
you can find a way to apply those 

1853
01:29:25,971 --> 01:29:25,971
skills.

1854
01:29:25,971 --> 01:29:30,230
In a new way that's going to be 
something that more engaged as you 

1855
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:31,080
personally and emotionally because in 
fact,

1856
01:29:31,081 --> 01:29:34,800
he really wasn't meant to be a boxer.
His father had pushed him into it.

1857
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:39,150
What he was meant to be was a teacher 
because he's fucking brilliant at it,

1858
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:43,920
so that's sort of like the model of the 
path that god has for you.

1859
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:49,070
It's not all rosy.
It's not all instantly finding the 

1860
01:29:49,070 --> 01:29:50,220
perfect job.
It requires some pain,

1861
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:52,320
some defeat,
some loss,

1862
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:55,800
some really tough moments,
and then it's going to click together.

1863
01:29:55,801 --> 01:29:56,880
As long as you don't give up

1864
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:57,980
here,
here,

1865
01:29:57,981 --> 01:30:01,310
and it is important to to experience the
loss.

1866
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:04,490
It's exploring.
It's very important to feel the lows.

1867
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:07,220
If you don't feel the lows you want 
appreciate the highs.

1868
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,060
People in this day and age,
they want instant coffee.

1869
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,460
You know they.
They want instant gratification.

1870
01:30:13,461 --> 01:30:15,650
They want everything to come to them 
with very little work.

1871
01:30:15,651 --> 01:30:18,050
They want to win the lottery.
Winning the lottery.

1872
01:30:18,051 --> 01:30:20,540
It's probably the worst fucking thing 
that could ever happen to you as a human

1873
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:22,310
being.
I think bAck,

1874
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:24,290
I played the lottery wants.
I want a free ticket.

1875
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:25,730
I played it again.
I lost.

1876
01:30:25,731 --> 01:30:26,900
I'm done.
That was it.

1877
01:30:26,901 --> 01:30:28,700
I never played the lottery again in the 
same way,

1878
01:30:28,730 --> 01:30:33,730
but what if I fucking one man,
what if I want 100 million dollars when 

1879
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:36,461
I was 21?
I would be the biggest fucking loser of 

1880
01:30:36,461 --> 01:30:36,461
all time.
Now I probably would.

1881
01:30:36,461 --> 01:30:38,120
I would.
The money would be gone.

1882
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,270
I'd be suicidal because I blew through 
$100,000,000.

1883
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:46,540
But it's what happens.
There's a reason why so many lottery 

1884
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:50,240
winners burned through that money and 
it's because you don't know what it is.

1885
01:30:50,330 --> 01:30:53,000
You didn't earn it.
It's not yours.

1886
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:58,030
It's crazy.
What you've done is you've found a 

1887
01:30:58,030 --> 01:31:01,091
weakness in the system.
You've exploited it because the system 

1888
01:31:01,091 --> 01:31:04,901
is designed to steal money from people 
and get those dummies to spend all this 

1889
01:31:04,901 --> 01:31:09,191
money on a fucking lottery ticket.
It's legalized gambling and the state 

1890
01:31:09,191 --> 01:31:13,211
profits from it.
Not just once but twice because they 

1891
01:31:13,211 --> 01:31:14,090
don't just take the money.
Your tax dollars.

1892
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:19,210
Okay?
The money that you received after you 

1893
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:19,210
spent all your money on taxes and all 
that,

1894
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:21,230
just what you've got left over.
Then you buy a lottery ticket.

1895
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:23,840
Well guess what?
All that money goes into a pool.

1896
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:26,540
The government takes a piece of it 
always,

1897
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:30,080
and then when you get paid,
they take half of that.

1898
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:33,920
They fuck you every way coming and 
going,

1899
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:37,070
and you get all that money and you still
blow it.

1900
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:42,250
You still blow it.
You can't keep it with almost no one 

1901
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:46,121
does.
You can have a million other fucking 

1902
01:31:46,121 --> 01:31:48,491
parasites trying to steal it from you 
and because they know you don't deserve 

1903
01:31:48,491 --> 01:31:48,491
it,
it's a.

1904
01:31:48,491 --> 01:31:50,180
It's a mad,
mad pursuit.

1905
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:55,600
The way you appreciate money,
whether it's a dollar or a million 

1906
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,810
dollars is when you earn it,
you work hard,

1907
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:59,150
you experienced the loss,
you go through the trials,

1908
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:01,060
tribulations,
and then you get it.

1909
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:03,610
when I look back at my path,
I'll just say real quick,

1910
01:32:03,611 --> 01:32:08,611
when I looked back at my path,
you know I've got out of school and I 

1911
01:32:08,611 --> 01:32:10,120
didn't know what the hell I was.
Gonna do and already felt terrible.

1912
01:32:10,121 --> 01:32:14,230
I had some idea that I was already gonna
be in my vocation doing something great.

1913
01:32:14,231 --> 01:32:15,760
By the time I finished college.
Well,

1914
01:32:15,761 --> 01:32:16,720
that didn't happen,
you know,

1915
01:32:16,721 --> 01:32:19,210
I was successful in a variety of 
different things.

1916
01:32:19,211 --> 01:32:22,510
I kept trying but not really nothing 
that I could really hang my hat on.

1917
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:26,020
So I was really anxious and antsy and I 
kept trying things.

1918
01:32:26,021 --> 01:32:28,690
I started a marketing company.
I sold fake vaginas.

1919
01:32:28,691 --> 01:32:33,020
I worked for a pharmaceutical company,
plus fleshlight,

1920
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:36,740
the largest fake vagina company.
This is a tangent we don't need to go to

1921
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:41,240
for what?
For stick your penis in them,

1922
01:32:42,230 --> 01:32:47,230
you know,
and I was working with oil and gas 

1923
01:32:47,230 --> 01:32:49,231
companies,
but every single thing it was like the 

1924
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:49,231
universe came and just bashed me on the 
head.

1925
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:50,260
Something didn't work out,
you know,

1926
01:32:50,261 --> 01:32:53,620
I'd even get options in this company 
that was going to strike,

1927
01:32:53,621 --> 01:32:56,110
you know,
they were fracking some gas or something

1928
01:32:56,111 --> 01:33:01,111
like that.
I didn't really understand it at that 

1929
01:33:01,111 --> 01:33:02,521
point,
but if that would have been successful 

1930
01:33:02,521 --> 01:33:04,771
and worked,
I would've made a huge amount of money 

1931
01:33:04,771 --> 01:33:05,620
and that would have deterred me from 
this path I am now.

1932
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:08,470
Which now I truly feel I'm in my 
vocation.

1933
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:13,710
But if I look back,
all of these things that I was fighting 

1934
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:16,681
for for success,
if they would have come and they would 

1935
01:33:16,681 --> 01:33:18,370
have come lucratively,
they might have deterred me from what my

1936
01:33:18,371 --> 01:33:20,830
real vocation is.
So all of these things,

1937
01:33:20,831 --> 01:33:25,831
all these bashes on the head,
like the universe takinG a fucking 

1938
01:33:25,831 --> 01:33:28,681
hammer and saying,
wack not going to work has kind of led 

1939
01:33:28,681 --> 01:33:32,611
me in this weird path to actually doing 
something that I truly now feel is my 

1940
01:33:32,611 --> 01:33:33,850
vocation.
But those things are blessings.

1941
01:33:33,851 --> 01:33:38,851
Those failures.
I think eventually you would have found 

1942
01:33:38,851 --> 01:33:39,970
your way because it's just who you are.
Maybe.

1943
01:33:39,971 --> 01:33:41,200
So like maybe

1944
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:44,710
it's easy for say when to say when 
someone's successful.

1945
01:33:44,770 --> 01:33:49,770
I know that's like the secret.
My issue with the secret is they only 

1946
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:53,851
talk to the ones who worked.
Like I was hanging out at the comedy 

1947
01:33:53,851 --> 01:33:55,090
store once and my friend kelly,
kirsten,

1948
01:33:55,120 --> 01:34:00,120
very funny,
standup comic had a friend that came 

1949
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,060
with her to the comedy show.
She seemed like a very nice person.

1950
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:06,190
And she was talking about the secret and
this is the first time I met her and she

1951
01:34:06,191 --> 01:34:07,600
was going on about,
you know,

1952
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:12,601
I'm going to have this and I'm going to 
have that and because I discovered the 

1953
01:34:12,601 --> 01:34:16,651
secret and you know that movie where it 
tells you to manifest your own destiny 

1954
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,070
with your imagination and you can make 
things happen.

1955
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:21,790
She had decided that because she had 
this belief in this system,

1956
01:34:21,791 --> 01:34:23,020
this,
this secret thing,

1957
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:28,230
that she was going to somehow or another
be super successful and find the man of 

1958
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:30,160
her dreams and be rich beyond our 
wildest imagination.

1959
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:35,940
Then I ran into her many years later.
She came to another comedy show that I 

1960
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:37,840
had a at the ucb and I remember she was 
very nice.

1961
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,730
So I was talking to her.
I was like,

1962
01:34:39,731 --> 01:34:40,450
hey,
how you doing?

1963
01:34:40,451 --> 01:34:45,451
I hadn't.
I talked to her once and then I talked 

1964
01:34:45,451 --> 01:34:47,791
to her twice.
Those are the only two times I ever had 

1965
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:47,791
an interaction with this woman.
She seemed very nice,

1966
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:51,990
but I'm talking to her and she's like,
I don't know why it's not working like 

1967
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:57,240
my relationships with terrible.
I can't cut myself off of these bad 

1968
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:01,741
relationships.
My father is always wants money from me 

1969
01:35:01,741 --> 01:35:02,510
and he's always broke and he drinks and 
it's like she had.

1970
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,000
She was like,
I thought that I was going to be able to

1971
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,820
create my own life and it's just not 
working.

1972
01:35:07,821 --> 01:35:11,600
And the secret,
when you watch those fucking shows,

1973
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,920
it's only the people that succeeded 
there.

1974
01:35:13,921 --> 01:35:18,440
Like I drew a picture of the house that 
I wanted in 10 years later,

1975
01:35:18,441 --> 01:35:21,050
I'm living in that house.
I set a goal.

1976
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:24,530
My goal was $10,000,000.
I have $10,000,000.

1977
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,330
The secret is real.
Well,

1978
01:35:26,331 --> 01:35:31,331
there's a person out there that drew a 
picture of a fucking castle on the moon 

1979
01:35:31,331 --> 01:35:31,331
and they're still in pasadena.
They're like,

1980
01:35:31,331 --> 01:35:32,930
where's my fucking castle on the moon?
He ain't getting there,

1981
01:35:32,931 --> 01:35:33,710
bitch.
Okay.

1982
01:35:33,711 --> 01:35:35,420
It's not that simple.
And when you,

1983
01:35:35,421 --> 01:35:40,421
you're,
you're dealing with a very biased 

1984
01:35:40,421 --> 01:35:44,200
profile.
You're only talking to the people that 

1985
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:44,200
are successful.

1986
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:44,200
Yeah.
Well,

1987
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:48,011
I mean,
one of the things in the laws of human 

1988
01:35:48,011 --> 01:35:50,201
nature coming up is this idea that if 
there's something that's easy,

1989
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:54,480
uh,
that someone's trying to pedal,

1990
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:58,850
it's a deception.
It's a con game.

1991
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:04,300
We want to believe we humans wanting to 
believe in something quick and easy and 

1992
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:08,981
simple.
And if we believe in something that 

1993
01:36:08,981 --> 01:36:09,590
means it can't really be real.
If we believe that because of that,

1994
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:10,790
um,
in other words,

1995
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:14,930
we want to believe that we can,
that god will grace us with,

1996
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:18,560
you know,
if we do perform certain rituals or that

1997
01:36:18,561 --> 01:36:21,620
we can make a lot of money by just 
following the secret.

1998
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:25,340
The truth of the matter is that to get 
really successful,

1999
01:36:25,341 --> 01:36:28,460
to make money that lasts,
it takes hours.

2000
01:36:28,461 --> 01:36:29,600
It takes 10,000
hours,

2001
01:36:29,601 --> 01:36:30,890
it takes 20,000
hours.

2002
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:33,350
It takes a lot of work,
tedious work,

2003
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,300
drudgery,
boredom,

2004
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:37,910
moments of challenge,
two feet.

2005
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:43,360
That's the reality.
So anybody that's trying to tell you 

2006
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:43,360
that,
that is not the case,

2007
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,200
that there are shortcuts.
They're con artists,

2008
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,970
okay?
That's just pure and simple there,

2009
01:36:46,971 --> 01:36:51,971
connors.
And one thing I'm trying to tell show 

2010
01:36:51,971 --> 01:36:51,971
in,
in,

2011
01:36:51,971 --> 01:36:54,860
in mastery is that we humans are geared 
towards pleasure.

2012
01:36:55,341 --> 01:36:58,310
We don't want to do things that are 
naturally painful.

2013
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:03,460
We are immediately attracted to things 
that offer us some kind of pleasure or 

2014
01:37:03,471 --> 01:37:08,471
reward.
And the problem is too many things 

2015
01:37:08,471 --> 01:37:09,290
nowadays offer pleasures that are 
immediate,

2016
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:11,700
instant rewards,
um,

2017
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:16,930
you know,
a movie or a video game or something 

2018
01:37:16,930 --> 01:37:17,750
like that,
or a drug where without much effort,

2019
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:20,930
we get a feeling of relaxation,
pleasure.

2020
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:26,470
and what I'm trying to show in mastery 
is that there's a different kind of 

2021
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:27,500
pleasure that you want to train your 
body towards,

2022
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:33,490
aiming at.
And that's a pleasure that comes from 

2023
01:37:33,490 --> 01:37:35,810
conquering yourself,
from learning something deeply as you're

2024
01:37:35,811 --> 01:37:39,860
taking up a or you've been doing archery
for some time.

2025
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:45,220
It's probably not too satisfying the 
first few days that you were doing at 

2026
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:45,620
our first few weeks.
It was a challenge.

2027
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:49,370
There wasn't much creativity involved,
et cetera.

2028
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:51,920
But if you keep doing this for five 
years,

2029
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:55,890
10 years,
suddenly it's reach a level pleasure

2030
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:59,340
that no video game could ever,
ever begin to supply you.

2031
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:04,580
And I want to reorient your whole value 
system towards this other kind of 

2032
01:38:05,041 --> 01:38:08,640
pleasure that comes from conquering your
yourself,

2033
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:12,000
getting discipline,
getting skilled at something,

2034
01:38:12,270 --> 01:38:17,270
becoming really good at it and feeling 
incredible sense of fulfillment as 

2035
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:21,090
opposed to all those immediate rushes 
that our culture tries to pedal.

2036
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:25,240
That's such a huge point for 
satisfaction in life.

2037
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:30,450
I feel most relaxed after I've worked 
out really hard and not just physically 

2038
01:38:31,211 --> 01:38:33,610
because I've blown off all this steam,
but because I did it,

2039
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:34,850
you know,
I'm,

2040
01:38:34,851 --> 01:38:39,220
I'm a big fan of being uncomfortable and
I tell that to people and I go,

2041
01:38:39,221 --> 01:38:40,060
what are you talking about?
Like,

2042
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,100
look,
nobody likes sleeping in more than me.

2043
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:43,360
I mean,
maybe you do,

2044
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:46,060
but I doubt it.
I love it.

2045
01:38:46,270 --> 01:38:48,190
I love sleeping in,
but I don't do it.

2046
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,510
Okay.
I get up,

2047
01:38:49,511 --> 01:38:51,430
I get up and a half to get up unless I 
can,

2048
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:53,230
you know,
did all my shit.

2049
01:38:53,530 --> 01:38:58,530
But my point is in when I have something
that I have to do when I do it,

2050
01:38:59,321 --> 01:39:02,450
if I don't want to do it,
it feels even better once I've done it.

2051
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:05,170
And that's,
that's the fan,

2052
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:09,490
that's the fan of being uncomfortable,
that I liked that feeling.

2053
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:11,740
I liked that feeling because that 
feeling of shaped me.

2054
01:39:11,741 --> 01:39:16,741
It's rewarded me.
It's one of the reasons why pursue so 

2055
01:39:16,741 --> 01:39:18,190
many things that I've never done before.
Why I got into archery.

2056
01:39:18,191 --> 01:39:19,360
Why,
why I'm enjoying it.

2057
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,370
I'm enjoying it because I fucking suck 
at it.

2058
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,710
You know,
I like sucking at something.

2059
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:25,150
Yeah.
Because you suck at it.

2060
01:39:25,151 --> 01:39:27,460
And now I don't suck out as much as I 
did three weeks,

2061
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:28,810
three months ago.
Whatever the hell it is.

2062
01:39:28,811 --> 01:39:31,300
When I first bought a bow,
I'm better at it now for sure.

2063
01:39:31,301 --> 01:39:36,301
I put pictures online of my,
my fucking my patterns that I can hit 

2064
01:39:36,970 --> 01:39:37,600
my,
um,

2065
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:38,930
the uh,
you know,

2066
01:39:39,430 --> 01:39:44,430
arrows in the bull's eyes and shit 
because I want to reinforce that in my 

2067
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:48,241
head to keep doing that.
And also there's a discipline involved 

2068
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:52,210
in something that's very difficult to do
that requires all of your concentration.

2069
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:55,840
That clears the mind.
And I think that that's.

2070
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:57,970
You can get that in gardening.
You know,

2071
01:39:57,971 --> 01:40:00,580
you can get them running up hills,
whatever it is.

2072
01:40:00,581 --> 01:40:03,070
When you're running up hills,
you're not thinking about too much other

2073
01:40:03,071 --> 01:40:06,310
shit when you're absolutely exhausted 
and your heart's pounding your chest and

2074
01:40:06,311 --> 01:40:09,130
you know you've got 300 yards to go and 
you don't think you can make it.

2075
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:10,650
There's,
there's a.

2076
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:12,280
there's a beauty in that.

2077
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:17,930
Yeah.
You're talking a lot about zen 

2078
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:19,491
philosophy almost too,
as well as using some modality of 

2079
01:40:19,491 --> 01:40:21,000
movement,
which is often it is or anything to find

2080
01:40:21,001 --> 01:40:23,340
a,
a sort of presence of mind,

2081
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:28,370
you know,
returning to that state of openness of 

2082
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:30,891
consciousness and archery is one of 
those main channels and in the art of 

2083
01:40:30,891 --> 01:40:31,170
archery,
great book,

2084
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:33,370
I've read that and you know,
you,

2085
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:38,380
you work for these moments,
they call it satori where it's these 

2086
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:41,060
moments where you have this really 
mindless shot that you take in archery 

2087
01:40:41,371 --> 01:40:44,370
and everything is just completely in the
moment.

2088
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:48,090
And I think the masters have found a way
to duplicate that more.

2089
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:49,980
You know,
more often more.

2090
01:40:50,690 --> 01:40:54,190
They have a almost a formula that can 
allow them to get

2091
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:57,300
these moments where they're really in 
the zone as you would call it,

2092
01:40:57,310 --> 01:40:58,930
or flow the flow.
Yeah,

2093
01:40:58,931 --> 01:41:00,700
getting these flow states,
which is really,

2094
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:05,800
you know,
hearkening back to that old zen 

2095
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,891
philosophy of being of no mind and that 
is the the experience that best 

2096
01:41:08,441 --> 01:41:11,470
describes martial arts at its best as 
well.

2097
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:13,630
When you're fighting,
when you're competing,

2098
01:41:13,631 --> 01:41:16,090
especially if there's anything on your 
mind,

2099
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:21,360
anything else besides the task at hand,
besides dealing with the other skilled 

2100
01:41:21,941 --> 01:41:24,370
person,
you're going to be diminished.

2101
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:26,710
You will be diminished.
Your skills will be diminished.

2102
01:41:26,711 --> 01:41:31,711
Your mind will be diminished.
It's one of the reasons why so many 

2103
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:33,931
people talk trash.
They talk trash to fill your mind up 

2104
01:41:33,931 --> 01:41:36,871
with other tasks.
They fill your mind up with insecurity 

2105
01:41:36,871 --> 01:41:37,180
and doubt or anger,
which is just as bad.

2106
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:39,160
Fill your mind up with all those 
emotions.

2107
01:41:39,370 --> 01:41:44,370
You might be able to win with anger if 
you're fighting a less than skilled 

2108
01:41:44,370 --> 01:41:47,371
opponent,
but if you fight a real master and you 

2109
01:41:47,371 --> 01:41:47,371
have anger,
you're going to make mistakes.

2110
01:41:47,371 --> 01:41:50,320
You're going to open yourself up,
you're going to fight with that anger,

2111
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:52,890
and in fighting with that anger,
you're gonna.

2112
01:41:52,910 --> 01:41:57,910
Expose yourself.
You're not gonna fight with perfect 

2113
01:41:57,910 --> 01:42:00,211
strategy,
unless you're Mike Tyson versus michael 

2114
01:42:00,211 --> 01:42:03,361
spinks were is fuck.
No maTter what he does to tyson could 

2115
01:42:03,361 --> 01:42:04,390
come into that fight on cocaine,
angry,

2116
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:06,190
didn't matter.
He's going to kill you because he's just

2117
01:42:06,191 --> 01:42:10,240
so much better and less that,
but when you have to mike tyson's,

2118
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:15,390
you know what you get,
you get Mike Tyson versus evander 

2119
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:17,491
holyfield.
You get a guy who was fighting with 

2120
01:42:17,491 --> 01:42:17,491
purity and a guy who's going to beat 
your fucking ass.

2121
01:42:17,491 --> 01:42:22,381
You're not going to take him out of 
there with one big rush in the first 

2122
01:42:22,381 --> 01:42:22,840
round and you know you're going to wind 
up getting knocked the fuck out,

2123
01:42:22,841 --> 01:42:24,850
and that's what happened to holy wood to
tyson.

2124
01:42:25,030 --> 01:42:27,160
When he fought holyfield,
he fought a real master.

2125
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:29,680
He fought a master when he wasn't a 
master anymore.

2126
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:30,570
Yeah.
This.

2127
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:34,260
I didn't include them in the mastery of 
an inclusive in my next book,

2128
01:42:34,261 --> 01:42:38,990
but I was reading phil jackson's most 
recent book and he said,

2129
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:44,000
master himself,
and he discovered then dealing with all 

2130
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,651
these incredible egos on the team as he 
did with the polls and later with the 

2131
01:42:48,651 --> 01:42:52,161
lakers that if he tried to get them all 
wired up before a game and emotional,

2132
01:42:52,561 --> 01:42:54,300
which is what a lot of coaches would do,
gala,

2133
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:57,390
we're going to rip the guts out of them.
Let's go kill the lake or whatever,

2134
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:02,800
that they would play much worse.
So his job was to imbibe in them 

2135
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:07,640
incredible peacefulness and calm this so
they would meditate before a game which 

2136
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:12,141
no other coach ever did before.
And he wanted them completely to be 

2137
01:43:12,141 --> 01:43:16,971
mindful in the game so that they could 
focus on the task and not use all that 

2138
01:43:16,971 --> 01:43:18,090
anger to push them.

2139
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:20,550
And some players could use the anger a 
little bit,

2140
01:43:20,551 --> 01:43:25,551
but most people like dennis rodman.
He would make them do all sorts of 

2141
01:43:25,551 --> 01:43:27,180
terrible mistakes and look at the 
results.

2142
01:43:27,181 --> 01:43:32,181
you know,
there's no coach who's had more 

2143
01:43:32,181 --> 01:43:32,181
championships or more success than 
someone like phil jackson,

2144
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:34,350
but the thing that I tried show in 
mastery,

2145
01:43:34,351 --> 01:43:36,840
because I have a story of a great zen 
master,

2146
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:39,210
a man named hakuin,
uh,

2147
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:42,960
because I myself practice zen meditation
had been for many years.

2148
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:47,340
This man,
if this was in sEventeenth century,

2149
01:43:47,341 --> 01:43:48,600
18th century,
Japan,

2150
01:43:49,530 --> 01:43:54,530
he was reacting against all the zen 
practices that were going on in Japan 

2151
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:58,331
that we're trying to promise you 
enlightenment through something very 

2152
01:43:58,331 --> 01:44:02,501
simple.
All you had to do was sit in what's 

2153
01:44:02,501 --> 01:44:04,250
called zaza and seated meditation and 
enlightenment would come to you.

2154
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:06,050
And he said,
this is such bullshit.

2155
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:07,820
I hate this.
This isn't the way to mass,

2156
01:44:07,821 --> 01:44:08,840
to enlightenment.

2157
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:11,780
They've gotten away from the true 
essence of zen.

2158
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:14,570
You have to have pain.
You have to go through 10,

2159
01:44:14,571 --> 01:44:16,940
20,
30 years of tortured doubt,

2160
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:20,150
misery.
The zen master hitting you over the head

2161
01:44:20,151 --> 01:44:25,151
with that stupid stick.
Every time he saw that you weren't 

2162
01:44:25,151 --> 01:44:25,151
concentrating and then you would be 
enlightened.

2163
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:27,650
And so I'm trying to show you,
even if it's enlightenment,

2164
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:32,860
which seems like the most material thing
you could think of requires the same 

2165
01:44:34,371 --> 01:44:38,540
process of going through a practice of 
having pain,

2166
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:41,630
of having resistance,
of having a teacher tell you that you're

2167
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:42,920
fucked up,
you're wrong,

2168
01:44:43,070 --> 01:44:45,410
hitting you on the head,
on and on.

2169
01:44:45,411 --> 01:44:46,870
It's a life.
Is that okay?

2170
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:49,150
Greatest teacher of all life will hit 
you on the head.

2171
01:44:49,151 --> 01:44:51,940
It's sure if you don't have any teacher 
with an actual stick,

2172
01:44:51,941 --> 01:44:54,820
you better believe that you know life 
itself will handle that.

2173
01:44:57,020 --> 01:44:58,730
No,
I mean the.

2174
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:03,820
What I try and say is I'm grounding you 
in what the human brain was evolved for 

2175
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:08,830
because our brains aren't,
weren't wired for ipods and iphones and 

2176
01:45:08,841 --> 01:45:13,841
twitter.
They were wired over hundreds of 

2177
01:45:13,841 --> 01:45:15,350
thousands of years of hunting,
of dealing with extremely radical,

2178
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:18,710
dangerous situations in which it the one
moment,

2179
01:45:18,711 --> 01:45:20,900
if we're not careful,
the leopard will come and eat.

2180
01:45:20,901 --> 01:45:25,901
Us and early humans were being eaTen 
quite often by large cats.

2181
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:31,850
I'm very dangerous environment in which 
your awareness,

2182
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:36,970
your focus,
your ability to understand your 

2183
01:45:36,970 --> 01:45:37,160
environment as if it were on your 
fingertips,

2184
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:42,340
to know every square foot of that very 
dangerous african savanna that you're 

2185
01:45:42,531 --> 01:45:45,200
on.
That's what the brain was wired for.

2186
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:48,080
Focus,
seeing something deeply,

2187
01:45:48,081 --> 01:45:53,081
understanding your environment,
not being distracted here and there and 

2188
01:45:53,081 --> 01:45:54,620
looking over there.
That's not how the brain was evolved,

2189
01:45:54,830 --> 01:45:59,420
so all of these disciplines,
from boxing to zen enlightenment,

2190
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,400
to archery,
to music,

2191
01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:06,610
to whatever,
they're all connected with the same 

2192
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:09,490
brain process that we all have to go 
through in order to reach this point 

2193
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:12,920
where we've mastered our environment.
Whatever that might be.

2194
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:15,990
your work in meditation,
what,

2195
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:21,020
what type of may saId zen meditation.
What type of zen meditation do you 

2196
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:21,020
practice?

2197
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:25,740
Well,
I've done mostly renza was called 

2198
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:25,740
rinzai.
There's soto and rinzai.

2199
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:31,320
I used to go to a place where I was 
trained and now I do it on my own.

2200
01:46:31,630 --> 01:46:33,220
What's the difference between the two 
schools of thought?

2201
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:38,910
One of them is more of a passive process
where you're just sitting there trying 

2202
01:46:39,281 --> 01:46:42,820
to completely empty your mind and that's
sort of the easier,

2203
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:47,830
slightly easier path and the concept is 
if you're able to reach a state where 

2204
01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:50,040
you're not thinking at all and you've 
your mind,

2205
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:54,780
enlightenment will come to you.
The other school is more active.

2206
01:46:54,810 --> 01:46:56,400
You can't just,
not just so passive.

2207
01:46:56,401 --> 01:46:58,740
You just can't empty your mind.
You have to do something else.

2208
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:01,980
And that something else is.
I'm simplifying it my junior,

2209
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:07,280
but that's something else is,
is more discipline and going through 

2210
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:08,470
learning these various coeds,
uh,

2211
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:13,670
for instance,
the most famous koan is these are 

2212
01:47:13,670 --> 01:47:14,910
usually a series of questions they'll 
sound of one hand clapping,

2213
01:47:14,911 --> 01:47:18,990
but the one that I've used for years is.
The question is,

2214
01:47:18,991 --> 01:47:23,991
does the dog have buddha nature?
And the answer from the zen master is 

2215
01:47:23,991 --> 01:47:24,750
move,
move,

2216
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:28,290
meaning no,
but it means more than no.

2217
01:47:28,291 --> 01:47:33,291
It means like nothing just nothingness.
And it's the most powerful zen koan ever

2218
01:47:33,991 --> 01:47:38,991
written.
If you ever try and think about it 

2219
01:47:38,991 --> 01:47:38,991
deeply,
you will reach enlightenment.

2220
01:47:38,991 --> 01:47:43,550
The different school of thought is you 
meditate on that koann almost like a 

2221
01:47:43,550 --> 01:47:47,271
mantra and try and figure it out until 
it opens up a gate in your head.

2222
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:53,900
Um,
that's a simplified version of the two 

2223
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:53,900
different types.

2224
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:58,060
So the idea being that this preposterous
question becomes sort of a pattern that 

2225
01:47:58,911 --> 01:48:03,890
your thoughts go into and you become 
empty because there's,

2226
01:48:03,891 --> 01:48:08,891
this pattern becomes you.
You say it over and over and over and 

2227
01:48:08,891 --> 01:48:09,440
over again.
You recite it.

2228
01:48:09,441 --> 01:48:14,330
You think about it over and over again 
until you reach a state of mind,

2229
01:48:14,870 --> 01:48:18,590
until you become so absurd that the 
words fall off of you.

2230
01:48:18,830 --> 01:48:21,560
Zen is trying to teach you something 
that's wordless.

2231
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:26,310
We're so trapped in language and words 
and thinking that that's,

2232
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:31,750
it separates us from our natural state 
of know of original mind,

2233
01:48:33,141 --> 01:48:36,470
of the nonthinking mind.
I know that sounds strange idea,

2234
01:48:36,471 --> 01:48:39,950
but um,
so through words,

2235
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:42,950
you're going to realize the absurdity of
words that they're not.

2236
01:48:42,951 --> 01:48:47,951
They're disconnecting you from reality.
And so at that point you realize that 

2237
01:48:47,951 --> 01:48:52,361
move means everything.
There's absolutely nothing real in this 

2238
01:48:52,911 --> 01:48:55,490
universe that can be encompassed by a 
word.

2239
01:48:56,120 --> 01:49:01,120
My talking about it here is absolutely 
completely counterproductive and and 

2240
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:01,880
ridiculous because people are going to 
think,

2241
01:49:01,881 --> 01:49:06,881
oh,
I'll just repeat the word move over and 

2242
01:49:06,881 --> 01:49:06,881
over again.
No,

2243
01:49:06,881 --> 01:49:09,911
it takes months of,
of thinking very deeply about this is 

2244
01:49:09,911 --> 01:49:14,060
trying to cut you off from that chatter 
in your head from,

2245
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:18,680
from thinking constantly,
linguistically about.

2246
01:49:18,730 --> 01:49:21,950
It's a total physical form of 
enlightenment,

2247
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:22,560
zen.
It's,

2248
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:25,490
it's most physical form of enlightenment
you could reach.

2249
01:49:25,780 --> 01:49:29,500
I keep getting reminded of that bill 
bradley story that you told,

2250
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:34,630
you know,
and kind of repeating the same thing 

2251
01:49:34,630 --> 01:49:36,600
bill bradley was,
he was a terrible basketball player to 

2252
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:36,600
start big,
gangly,

2253
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:36,600
slow,
not,

2254
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:38,050
not terrible,
but it wasn't good,

2255
01:49:38,350 --> 01:49:43,350
but he had the most relentless pursuit 
of improvement of anybody that I've ever

2256
01:49:43,481 --> 01:49:45,760
read.
You can probably pick up the story,

2257
01:49:45,761 --> 01:49:46,960
but he,
you know,

2258
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:48,040
dress,
dribbling the

2259
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,500
ball constantly.
Eight hours,

2260
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:52,240
nine hours a day,
you know,

2261
01:49:52,241 --> 01:49:54,610
again,
over and over and over again.

2262
01:49:54,611 --> 01:49:56,380
And that kind of repetition,
you know,

2263
01:49:56,381 --> 01:50:01,381
it's,
it's all part of this same pattern of 

2264
01:50:01,381 --> 01:50:01,381
doing the same thing over and over 
again.

2265
01:50:01,381 --> 01:50:06,210
well,
I'm glad you bring up music is a great 

2266
01:50:06,210 --> 01:50:07,591
story.
It's kind of another like freddie roach 

2267
01:50:07,591 --> 01:50:07,591
type thing.
You take the skis,

2268
01:50:07,591 --> 01:50:11,080
he's a white guy who happens to be tall,
but he loves basketball.

2269
01:50:11,410 --> 01:50:16,410
He's like nine years old,
and I know this myself because I love 

2270
01:50:16,410 --> 01:50:19,441
basketball when I was a kid,
just the sound of the ball swishing 

2271
01:50:19,441 --> 01:50:19,960
through the net.
He just loved that,

2272
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:22,420
that side of the sound of that,
the feel of it.

2273
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:24,730
So we had this sort of visceral love of 
the game,

2274
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:26,980
but he stunk at it.
He was tall,

2275
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:28,150
awkward,
slow.

2276
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:33,550
There's no way he'd become good at it.
so he decided he was gonna train himself

2277
01:50:33,551 --> 01:50:36,800
from a very early age and I call it,
um,

2278
01:50:36,910 --> 01:50:39,400
you know,
they have a concept in called deliberate

2279
01:50:39,401 --> 01:50:44,401
practice where you learned to practice 
what you're not good at because we 

2280
01:50:44,401 --> 01:50:49,081
often,
if we're taking up archery or 

2281
01:50:49,081 --> 01:50:49,081
basketball,
we find something that we're good at and

2282
01:50:49,081 --> 01:50:50,110
we tend to just repeat that.

2283
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:52,930
And tHen our practice becomes very one 
sided,

2284
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:56,680
deliberate practices to practice on what
you're not good at.

2285
01:50:56,920 --> 01:51:00,970
I call it resistance practice,
actually practicing it.

2286
01:51:00,971 --> 01:51:05,560
What is painful in enjoying the pain?
And that's bill bradley.

2287
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:10,980
He put these special glasses on his head
that prevented him from looking down so 

2288
01:51:12,521 --> 01:51:16,180
he could.
He would dribble on a court for 10 hours

2289
01:51:16,181 --> 01:51:18,130
or 10 hours,
three or four hours,

2290
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:21,730
and he couldn't look down at his feet 
which trained him to dribble.

2291
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:23,920
That's the worst thing.
You can have fear always looking down.

2292
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:26,410
You're not able to see where what's 
going on on the court.

2293
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:28,030
So he did.
He did that.

2294
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:33,180
He went on a cruise with his parents 
across to england and he didn't.

2295
01:51:33,641 --> 01:51:38,641
He wanted to build a practice there.
He brought his basketball and below 

2296
01:51:38,641 --> 01:51:42,301
deck.
There were these incredibly long alleys 

2297
01:51:42,301 --> 01:51:43,240
that would go from one end of the shift 
to the other that were very narrow.

2298
01:51:43,450 --> 01:51:48,450
He would put on a special glasses and he
would dribble back and forth in this 

2299
01:51:48,450 --> 01:51:50,980
narrow area so that he could dribble 
with absolute complete control.

2300
01:51:51,190 --> 01:51:56,190
He devised all of these other exercises 
where he could train himself to see 

2301
01:51:56,770 --> 01:52:01,770
almost behind himself or at least way 
over to the side on and on and on until 

2302
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:08,220
he became so good that by the time he 
got into college at princeton and then 

2303
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:12,661
later he played for the New York knicks 
in the seventies with all the great 

2304
01:52:12,661 --> 01:52:13,040
champIonship teams.
People would look at bill and they go,

2305
01:52:13,041 --> 01:52:14,860
my god,
this guy is.

2306
01:52:14,950 --> 01:52:19,950
He's a born.
He was born with a basketball in his 

2307
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:19,950
hand.
He's naturally gifted.

2308
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:22,210
He is so graceful.
He has eyes in the back of his head.

2309
01:52:22,211 --> 01:52:24,610
He could make a pass to walt frazier 
without even looking.

2310
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:30,090
They didn't realize that he had gone 
through the most insanely rigorous,

2311
01:52:30,341 --> 01:52:35,341
painful,
deliberate form of practice ever 

2312
01:52:35,341 --> 01:52:37,630
invented by a single human athlete.
I'm at a very early age,

2313
01:52:38,130 --> 01:52:40,450
um,
and it made,

2314
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:42,250
it,
made the game fun for him.

2315
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:47,340
It was sure it was a lot of pain,
but by the time got good and he was in 

2316
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:49,160
high school.
All the girls were admiring him.

2317
01:52:49,490 --> 01:52:51,860
You know,
he got invited to go to princeton.

2318
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:53,090
I mean,
it paid off.

2319
01:52:53,091 --> 01:52:56,990
And he got a huge level of pleasure and 
the game became incredibly fun,

2320
01:52:57,260 --> 01:53:02,260
but it was all based on these insane 
moments and periods of of pain that he 

2321
01:53:02,361 --> 01:53:03,230
put himself through.

2322
01:53:03,550 --> 01:53:06,340
That's a beautiful story.
I love that story.

2323
01:53:06,341 --> 01:53:11,341
That's amazing.
That's such a huge lesson for young 

2324
01:53:11,341 --> 01:53:15,061
people coming up to learn and here to 
instill that into your mind and to use 

2325
01:53:15,061 --> 01:53:15,400
that as a template.

2326
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:20,850
Yeah.
Particularly nowadays when you're just 

2327
01:53:20,850 --> 01:53:24,301
so inundated with immediate pleasures 
and so many young people are 

2328
01:53:24,301 --> 01:53:25,690
disconnected from what I call,
you know,

2329
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:26,880
the,
the,

2330
01:53:26,970 --> 01:53:29,290
the pattern that our brains were built 
for.

2331
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:35,070
If you're going against that pattern and
trying to get things quickly or 

2332
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:35,140
immediately,
you're just going to fail.

2333
01:53:35,141 --> 01:53:37,720
You're just going to be a loser in life.
there's no you can't.

2334
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:43,330
You in your short life,
can't suddenly move against 2 million,

2335
01:53:43,390 --> 01:53:45,370
3 million years of evolution.
I'm sorry.

2336
01:53:45,371 --> 01:53:46,600
It's just can't be done.

2337
01:53:47,490 --> 01:53:49,140
That's a beautiful statement,
man.

2338
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:54,000
That's so that what you said is so 
important and that story,

2339
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:59,120
that bill bradley story is such a 
powerful story because anyone can do 

2340
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:00,450
that with whatever you're trying to do.
Exactly.

2341
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:02,430
I mean,
he just happened to be born tall,

2342
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:06,240
so if you hadn't ended up being six foot
six or seven and he wouldn't know,

2343
01:54:06,241 --> 01:54:07,100
but that's all.

2344
01:54:07,450 --> 01:54:10,990
What about muggsy bogues,
he was a great bass player.

2345
01:54:11,260 --> 01:54:13,300
There's plenty of examples of people who
exactly.

2346
01:54:13,330 --> 01:54:14,980
They physically weren't built for.
I mean,

2347
01:54:14,981 --> 01:54:19,981
Mike Tyson was one of the smallest 
heavyweight champions of that modern 

2348
01:54:19,981 --> 01:54:19,981
era.
You know,

2349
01:54:19,981 --> 01:54:20,110
he was five foot 10.
He,

2350
01:54:20,111 --> 01:54:23,550
you know,
he weighed 215 pounds in his prime look,

2351
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:28,600
go back to primo carnera who was a 
heavyweight champion and the fucking 

2352
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:28,600
twenties or thirties or whatever the 
hell it was.

2353
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:30,130
He was like 300 pounds,
you know,

2354
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:31,170
I mean,
mike tyson's,

2355
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:33,040
in my opinion,
the greatest heavyweight of all time,

2356
01:54:33,041 --> 01:54:34,870
and it wasn't that big.
It wasn't a big guy,

2357
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:36,220
you know,
and the,

2358
01:54:36,310 --> 01:54:38,790
the cool part is that ultimately,
you know,

2359
01:54:38,850 --> 01:54:41,350
we've talked about it before.
Any master that you meet,

2360
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:44,560
they're generally a real true pleasure 
to be around.

2361
01:54:44,650 --> 01:54:49,650
You know,
if they've worked through all of these 

2362
01:54:49,650 --> 01:54:49,870
country egoistic attitudes that they may
carry along.

2363
01:54:50,110 --> 01:54:55,110
And it's through this,
almost overcoming this physical 

2364
01:54:55,110 --> 01:54:56,140
resistance in the very heart of the 
mastery that they're doing.

2365
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:57,610
It doesn't matter,
ping pong,

2366
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:59,410
bowhunting,
comedy,

2367
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:01,420
whatever,
basketball,

2368
01:55:01,421 --> 01:55:06,421
whatever it is,
you reach a certain place by pushing 

2369
01:55:06,421 --> 01:55:09,601
through that pain and going through 
those hours and doing those things that 

2370
01:55:09,601 --> 01:55:12,340
almost tempers your spirit as the,
as the main thing that's happening.

2371
01:55:12,341 --> 01:55:17,341
And it just,
the skill kind of comes along with it 

2372
01:55:17,341 --> 01:55:19,711
sometimes been focused on the sometimes 
not though unfortunately sometimes 

2373
01:55:19,711 --> 01:55:23,400
focusing on that skill becomes to the 
detriment of all other aspects of your 

2374
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:27,481
life.
And there are people that achieved 

2375
01:55:27,481 --> 01:55:29,341
mastery in very specific things that are
fucking total shitheads ty cobb.

2376
01:55:29,650 --> 01:55:32,830
Great example.
It was famous shithead.

2377
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,110
You know what I mean?
There's a lot of people,

2378
01:55:35,111 --> 01:55:37,320
Mike Tyson in his prime,
you know,

2379
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,700
went to jail for rape.
There was a lot of.

2380
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:40,930
I mean,
I don't think he did it.

2381
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:44,010
He says he didn't do it and he's really 
honest pretty much everything else in

2382
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,990
his life.
But the point being,

2383
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:47,940
you know,
he was a wild,

2384
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:52,941
crazy fuck.
And that was one of the reasons why he 

2385
01:55:52,941 --> 01:55:55,281
was being successful.
There are very many examples of people 

2386
01:55:55,281 --> 01:55:59,301
who become so selective in what they're 
trying to do and so obsessed and focused

2387
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:05,060
to the detriment of personal 
relationships to the detriment of their 

2388
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:05,760
own personality.
I mean,

2389
01:56:05,761 --> 01:56:07,370
steve jobs would definitely fall under 
that.

2390
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:10,050
I agree.
It doesn't have to be that way though.

2391
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:15,180
it doesn't have to be that way.
Then I always say I'm even with ty cobb 

2392
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:19,360
or steve jobs,
they were probably miserable to be 

2393
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:22,151
around,
but he had a pretty hugely satisfying 

2394
01:56:22,151 --> 01:56:22,151
life.

2395
01:56:22,151 --> 01:56:22,720
Maybe.
I don't know man.

2396
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:24,430
I don't know that guy now.
I don't know.

2397
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:27,160
I think it kinda goes to your.
Use the bathroom real quick,

2398
01:56:27,161 --> 01:56:32,161
please tell you.
Hey goes to kind of one of your final 

2399
01:56:32,161 --> 01:56:34,801
points which is on that path to mastery.
The final level is building bridges back

2400
01:56:35,561 --> 01:56:40,561
to nature,
back to different and making other 

2401
01:56:40,561 --> 01:56:40,561
connections.
You know.

2402
01:56:40,561 --> 01:56:40,660
So if you stay too focused in that one 
thing,

2403
01:56:40,690 --> 01:56:45,220
he never looked to build a bridge to 
anything else you can probably result in

2404
01:56:45,221 --> 01:56:45,970
some of these issues.

2405
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:46,980
Yeah,
I mean,

2406
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:52,020
for those who don't know the book,
essentially I've laid out kind of five 

2407
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:54,460
or six steps towards this ultimate form 
of mastery.

2408
01:56:54,730 --> 01:56:59,440
It's like a path and it involves first 
discovering who you are,

2409
01:56:59,441 --> 01:57:04,441
what you were meant to do,
then going through what I call the 

2410
01:57:04,441 --> 01:57:07,660
apprenticeship in which you develop all 
of the proper skills later in life.

2411
01:57:08,741 --> 01:57:12,310
You have like a real firm basis for 
becoming creative.

2412
01:57:12,550 --> 01:57:17,550
And part of that apprenticeship involves
working with mentors and masters and it 

2413
01:57:17,801 --> 01:57:22,801
also involves learning how to work with 
other people and deal with their 

2414
01:57:22,801 --> 01:57:26,491
weirdness and their political games and 
then showing you then how you reached 

2415
01:57:26,491 --> 01:57:28,390
the creative level and then the mastery 
level.

2416
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:31,960
And it's a loose path.
It's not like a straight line,

2417
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:37,380
uh,
but I'm sort of showing you the various 

2418
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:38,860
steps that get you there.
And as he poinTs out,

2419
01:57:39,350 --> 01:57:42,190
um,
particularly nowadays,

2420
01:57:42,260 --> 01:57:47,260
uh,
it involves the kind of a 

2421
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:47,260
well-roundedness.

2422
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:51,690
You're not just some asperger's guy in 
silicon valley who's great at a 

2423
01:57:53,740 --> 01:57:56,830
logarithms and creating the ultimate,
you know,

2424
01:57:56,831 --> 01:58:00,490
facebook or whatever.
you also have to have social skills.

2425
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:04,390
And I have a whole chapter in mastery of
social intelligence.

2426
01:58:04,750 --> 01:58:06,400
You have to learn how to deal with 
people.

2427
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:10,930
You have to be socially fluid,
you have to know how to be empathetic,

2428
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:13,420
how to understand what other people's 
feelings are,

2429
01:58:13,690 --> 01:58:17,350
how to handle the assholes that will 
inevitably cross your path.

2430
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:22,920
So sort of the people that that joe's 
talking about who are a little bit one 

2431
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:27,121
sided,
they've kind of bypassed some of these 

2432
01:58:27,121 --> 01:58:29,641
other things that I'm talking about 
because I'm trying to get you to that 

2433
01:58:29,641 --> 01:58:31,000
well rounded form of mastery,

2434
01:58:31,290 --> 01:58:33,900
which is true mastery mastery over your 
whole life,

2435
01:58:33,901 --> 01:58:35,790
not just a specific task.
very much so.

2436
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:38,850
Do you.
You were talking a lot about meditation.

2437
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:41,470
Did you ever spend anytime in an 
isolation tank?

2438
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:42,400
I have.

2439
01:58:42,990 --> 01:58:47,990
Do you do iT on regular basis?
When I was living in New York years ago 

2440
01:58:47,990 --> 01:58:52,831
as a journalist,
they asked me to write an article about 

2441
01:58:52,831 --> 01:58:56,011
isolation takes.
This was when they were just starting 

2442
01:58:56,011 --> 01:58:56,011
out early eighties.
They were around before that.

2443
01:58:56,011 --> 01:59:00,810
They were,
but they became a recreational thing in 

2444
01:59:00,810 --> 01:59:00,810
the early eighties.
The yeah,

2445
01:59:00,810 --> 01:59:04,930
they were around as a cia experiment and
the people know john lilly,

2446
01:59:05,110 --> 01:59:06,870
the guy john lilly,
but,

2447
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:11,880
but for the general public,
it really became like a fad in the early

2448
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,470
eighties.
Uh,

2449
01:59:13,510 --> 01:59:18,510
so I,
I was asked to cover and I got kinda 

2450
01:59:18,510 --> 01:59:19,690
hooked and I did it for awhile.
I haven't done it since then,

2451
01:59:19,691 --> 01:59:21,190
but I was quite.
It's a great experience.

2452
01:59:21,190 --> 01:59:23,510
I think that was because of the movie 
altered states.

2453
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:28,980
When did that movie come out?
Because that was how I found out about 

2454
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:28,990
this.
I think you're right.

2455
01:59:28,991 --> 01:59:29,720
81.
No.

2456
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:31,360
Nineteen 80,
80 altered states.

2457
01:59:31,570 --> 01:59:33,430
Exactly.
Yeah.

2458
01:59:33,450 --> 01:59:38,450
It's,
isn't it funny how a movie can just 

2459
01:59:38,450 --> 01:59:38,450
start a trend like that?
Um,

2460
01:59:38,450 --> 01:59:40,330
I found out about altered states when I 
was in high school.

2461
01:59:40,331 --> 01:59:43,900
I watched the movie in high school or 
right after it came out.

2462
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:46,750
I actually saw in junior high because 
there's 80.

2463
01:59:46,751 --> 01:59:48,520
I wasn't in high school yet,
but uh,

2464
01:59:48,521 --> 01:59:53,320
I got into isolation tanks when I first 
came to California because they had them

2465
01:59:53,321 --> 01:59:58,321
here and I never knew that there was a 
place where you could get into one and 

2466
01:59:58,321 --> 02:00:00,000
through talking about it on the podcast,
the,

2467
02:00:00,020 --> 02:00:05,020
the entire industry has got this massive
bump now and there's isolation tank 

2468
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:09,421
centers opening up all over the world 
that credit me talking about it on the 

2469
02:00:09,421 --> 02:00:10,660
podcast and youtube videos that I talk 
about it.

2470
02:00:11,290 --> 02:00:12,960
I have one of my banks meant,
oh man.

2471
02:00:13,810 --> 02:00:15,460
I think it's.
How often do you do it?

2472
02:00:15,490 --> 02:00:17,560
All the time.
I think I was in yesterday.

2473
02:00:17,770 --> 02:00:19,810
I think it's the most important tool.
Actually,

2474
02:00:19,811 --> 02:00:21,850
yesterday,
not online day before yesterday.

2475
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:26,880
I didn't go yesterday.
I think it's the most important tool 

2476
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:27,520
that I've ever discovered.
How often should it?

2477
02:00:28,010 --> 02:00:33,010
I at least an hour.
I think an hour is the right amount of 

2478
02:00:33,010 --> 02:00:33,010
time.

2479
02:00:33,010 --> 02:00:34,440
Is there somebody that wakes you up and 
gets you out?

2480
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,520
No.
I have a timer.

2481
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:40,720
I set a timer if I have to,
but sometimes I go in there if I don't 

2482
02:00:40,951 --> 02:00:41,280
have

2483
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:43,940
sense of time.
You have no idea,

2484
02:00:43,941 --> 02:00:44,870
but an hour is

2485
02:00:46,050 --> 02:00:47,240
kind of.
Yeah,

2486
02:00:47,241 --> 02:00:48,130
maybe.
I don't know.

2487
02:00:48,140 --> 02:00:53,140
My brain seems to know when to hours is 
two hours seems pretty standard for me.

2488
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:55,970
Like if I,
if I don't have any time constraints,

2489
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,850
two hours seems to be what I really,
depending on whether or not I'm sober or

2490
02:00:59,851 --> 02:01:01,490
not when I go into it,
never drunk.

2491
02:01:01,491 --> 02:01:03,360
But marijuana is usually the,
uh,

2492
02:01:03,380 --> 02:01:06,620
intoxicant of choice,
especially edible marijuana,

2493
02:01:06,621 --> 02:01:09,860
which provides a much more 
hallucinogenic effect.

2494
02:01:09,950 --> 02:01:10,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

2495
02:01:10,461 --> 02:01:14,150
I think it enhances the experience of 
the psychedelic state inside the tank.

2496
02:01:14,151 --> 02:01:16,700
You don't freak out or.
I like figuring out,

2497
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:19,140
freaking out,
freaking out.

2498
02:01:19,141 --> 02:01:24,141
It's important.
I'm a big fan of freaking out because 

2499
02:01:24,141 --> 02:01:24,141
then much like,
you know,

2500
02:01:24,141 --> 02:01:29,121
the stress of exercise or discipline 
through the experience of complete 

2501
02:01:29,361 --> 02:01:31,900
freaking out you.
There's lessons to be learned.

2502
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:34,430
Confront your demons and stuff.
Yeah.

2503
02:01:34,431 --> 02:01:37,250
The psychedelic state that you can 
achieve inside an isolation tank.

2504
02:01:37,251 --> 02:01:38,830
I'm edible.
Marijuana is pretty,

2505
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:40,040
pretty

2506
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:41,360
fucking intense.
Wow.

2507
02:01:41,490 --> 02:01:46,490
But it's just the data environment for 
meditation.

2508
02:01:46,730 --> 02:01:51,730
I mean,
there's no better environment ever 

2509
02:01:51,730 --> 02:01:51,730
created for meditation.
In fact,

2510
02:01:51,730 --> 02:01:51,730
it's the only environment like it on 
earth.

2511
02:01:51,890 --> 02:01:53,510
You're a successful man.
How come you don't have one of those?

2512
02:01:54,710 --> 02:01:57,320
I don't have a basement,
but the basement.

2513
02:01:57,770 --> 02:01:58,580
well,
I don't know.

2514
02:01:58,640 --> 02:01:59,570
my girlfriend would want

2515
02:01:59,770 --> 02:02:01,540
edit our hub shit.
Get a new one.

2516
02:02:02,210 --> 02:02:03,340
New girlfriend.
Moving on.

2517
02:02:05,220 --> 02:02:07,450
She tried to keep you from having an 
isolation tank.

2518
02:02:07,451 --> 02:02:09,010
What's she trying to do to keep you from
enlightenment?

2519
02:02:09,150 --> 02:02:10,180
Yeah.
All right.

2520
02:02:10,181 --> 02:02:15,181
I'll try that.
Honor the artist talking about your own 

2521
02:02:16,691 --> 02:02:21,691
laws.
You're violating them right now by 

2522
02:02:21,691 --> 02:02:23,731
saying that.
Did your girlfriend tell you what kind 

2523
02:02:23,731 --> 02:02:23,731
of car you can drive to?

2524
02:02:23,731 --> 02:02:24,020
No.
Oh,

2525
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:26,320
but sometimes you got give in to the 
other person.

2526
02:02:26,321 --> 02:02:27,790
You know relationships a little bit 
about that.

2527
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:30,140
Compromise.
Not if it's about an isolation tank.

2528
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:31,160
No,
you're right.

2529
02:02:31,161 --> 02:02:32,690
You're right.
and no fucking reason.

2530
02:02:32,990 --> 02:02:37,990
I'm sorry.
I'm beating you over the head with your 

2531
02:02:37,990 --> 02:02:37,990
own work.
That's all right.

2532
02:02:37,990 --> 02:02:37,990
Everybody does that.

2533
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:44,860
But zen meditation is sort of like the 
the isolation because the point of it 

2534
02:02:44,860 --> 02:02:48,851
is,
is to cut off all stimuli and you're 

2535
02:02:48,851 --> 02:02:52,151
not.
You don't have to rely on this 

2536
02:02:52,151 --> 02:02:52,151
environment that you're putting yourself
into.

2537
02:02:52,151 --> 02:02:56,270
So your eyes are open when you're 
meditating,

2538
02:02:57,290 --> 02:03:02,290
but you're not looking at anything and 
you're not getting in any stimuli at 

2539
02:03:02,290 --> 02:03:03,980
all,
so you're not hearing anything.

2540
02:03:03,981 --> 02:03:08,981
I mean there can be sounds outside,
but you're not paying attention to them 

2541
02:03:08,981 --> 02:03:12,320
and you enter the state that's similar 
to what the isolation take is.

2542
02:03:12,321 --> 02:03:17,321
I can enter a state like the isolation 
tank without the isolation tank because 

2543
02:03:17,321 --> 02:03:21,911
I cut off all stimuli and I enter my own
mental space and incredible things can 

2544
02:03:21,911 --> 02:03:22,770
happen.
So you just,

2545
02:03:22,950 --> 02:03:26,160
nor the stimuli until the point where 
it's not reaching the mind,

2546
02:03:26,161 --> 02:03:27,200
is that the idea behind it

2547
02:03:27,580 --> 02:03:32,580
training it's years of meditation where 
you're not good at it and still to this 

2548
02:03:32,580 --> 02:03:33,520
day,
thoughts invade your head,

2549
02:03:33,550 --> 02:03:36,460
which probably don't so much.
Well they do when you're In an isolation

2550
02:03:36,461 --> 02:03:37,990
tank of course to do.
Um,

2551
02:03:38,530 --> 02:03:40,710
but if you go,
uh,

2552
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:45,880
it's called samadhi and somadi is a 
state where your samadhi tanks.

2553
02:03:46,190 --> 02:03:46,720
No.
Yeah,

2554
02:03:46,721 --> 02:03:48,430
that's the name of the company,
right?

2555
02:03:48,431 --> 02:03:49,630
That's right.
I remember tanks.

2556
02:03:49,900 --> 02:03:51,160
I remember that.
Well,

2557
02:03:51,161 --> 02:03:56,110
somebody is a kind of mindless state or 
that's not exactly the word,

2558
02:03:56,111 --> 02:03:58,270
but you're,
you're,

2559
02:03:58,420 --> 02:04:02,650
there's no thinking going on and it's 
just incredibly euphoric.

2560
02:04:03,250 --> 02:04:08,250
You could reach that through medItation,
but it maybe after 20 minutes or 25 

2561
02:04:08,250 --> 02:04:11,920
minutes you get to that state,
but you're cutting off all stimuli

2562
02:04:12,900 --> 02:04:17,900
and the reasons they founded yoga was to
make it so that there was less stimuli 

2563
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:20,390
coming from your seated ass,
you know,

2564
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:25,400
and the law,
the way that your legs were folded when 

2565
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:28,041
you're meditating because all of that 
noise that an isolation tank filters 

2566
02:04:28,041 --> 02:04:28,041
out.
And I love,

2567
02:04:28,041 --> 02:04:29,670
I love the tank.
It's most effective for me.

2568
02:04:29,671 --> 02:04:34,671
but you know,
they would do yoga so that they could 

2569
02:04:34,671 --> 02:04:36,120
sit in that pose and have less of that 
stimuli yelling for longer so they could

2570
02:04:36,121 --> 02:04:38,070
reach those in which they

2571
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:43,070
could find that wow.
So personally find that yoga releases 

2572
02:04:43,070 --> 02:04:44,600
some form psychedelic chemicals in the 
mind that it's,

2573
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:49,610
its own practice and gotten high,
like legitimately high from yoga to the 

2574
02:04:49,610 --> 02:04:53,721
point where uh,
not I don't want to say intoxicated 

2575
02:04:53,721 --> 02:04:53,721
like,
um,

2576
02:04:53,721 --> 02:04:58,310
like diminished in some way or affected 
like I can't form sentences or anything 

2577
02:04:58,310 --> 02:05:03,171
like that,
but like I feel like a chemical effect 

2578
02:05:03,450 --> 02:05:07,650
or a biological effect,
some sort of a real tangible effect from

2579
02:05:07,651 --> 02:05:10,800
yoga definitely.
Which I have always wondered.

2580
02:05:10,801 --> 02:05:15,801
I mean,
my thought process was why would these 

2581
02:05:15,801 --> 02:05:15,801
people do all this for so long?
Like what,

2582
02:05:15,870 --> 02:05:20,870
why would they have this practice for 
thousands of years unless there was 

2583
02:05:20,870 --> 02:05:21,120
something to it and there's something to
it.

2584
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:26,800
I do a lot of swimming and I find 
swimming the x absolute ultimate form of

2585
02:05:27,401 --> 02:05:31,090
exercise because there's nothing,
there's no stimuli.

2586
02:05:31,730 --> 02:05:36,730
I mean You're not sitting there thinking
about the water anymore and your brain 

2587
02:05:36,730 --> 02:05:38,380
just zones out and after you do long 
distance swimming,

2588
02:05:38,381 --> 02:05:41,470
you can reach very interesting alpha 
states.

2589
02:05:41,650 --> 02:05:42,430
Yeah,
I agree.

2590
02:05:42,431 --> 02:05:47,431
I find it incredibly,
I'm not just beautiful in that sense 

2591
02:05:47,441 --> 02:05:51,550
where you achieve states,
but it's really taxing.

2592
02:05:52,270 --> 02:05:57,270
it's really hard to swim like most 
people think of swimming is like 

2593
02:05:57,270 --> 02:05:57,820
recreational activity,
like I do a lot of swimming with my kids

2594
02:05:57,821 --> 02:06:01,540
and we play around,
but when I do laps like fuck.

2595
02:06:01,541 --> 02:06:02,830
It's fucking hard.
Yeah,

2596
02:06:02,950 --> 02:06:04,360
swimming is hard to do,
man.

2597
02:06:04,361 --> 02:06:05,890
You look at it dude,
like Michael Phelps.

2598
02:06:06,370 --> 02:06:11,370
That's a bad man.
That guy has achieved this incredible 

2599
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:13,240
ability to move through the water.
Like a fucking fish.

2600
02:06:13,810 --> 02:06:18,810
That's not an easy.
That is a real legit difficult 

2601
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:18,810
accomplishment.

2602
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:20,600
Yep.
I like the pain,

2603
02:06:20,660 --> 02:06:25,660
the mental pain involved in swimming 
because I like to swim long distances 

2604
02:06:25,660 --> 02:06:26,510
where you're like,
I just can't do this anymore.

2605
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:31,900
It's so boring and it's so painful and 
I'm just going to drown.

2606
02:06:32,271 --> 02:06:33,830
I kept.
I'm taking whatever,

2607
02:06:33,831 --> 02:06:37,550
and then you just push past that and you
swim two miles and you get out.

2608
02:06:37,790 --> 02:06:38,840
Man.
What a great feeling.

2609
02:06:39,450 --> 02:06:42,030
Do laps in the pool over and over and 
over again.

2610
02:06:42,650 --> 02:06:44,490
You're not one of those crazy fox.
It gets in the ocean.

2611
02:06:44,491 --> 02:06:44,760
Are you?

2612
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:50,500
I would love to,
but I live close to the ocean and it's 

2613
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:54,170
cold and polluted.
If I lived in Hawaii,

2614
02:06:54,171 --> 02:06:59,171
I'd be swimming in the ocean and then 
they get radioactive shit come from 

2615
02:06:59,171 --> 02:07:01,250
Japan.
Says if I lived in the yucatan,

2616
02:07:01,251 --> 02:07:01,370
I'd.

2617
02:07:01,900 --> 02:07:02,920
Ah,
there you go.

2618
02:07:03,130 --> 02:07:04,480
That's it.
That's the spot.

2619
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:10,330
Long ocean swims moved to the uk.
That is a beautiful patch of water 

2620
02:07:10,330 --> 02:07:10,330
though,
by the way,

2621
02:07:10,330 --> 02:07:11,760
to loom you ever been into loom?
No,

2622
02:07:11,770 --> 02:07:14,290
I've been to teach an eatsa chinita.
Yeah,

2623
02:07:14,510 --> 02:07:15,530
it's amazing.
Yeah.

2624
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:16,540
Incredible.
Yeah,

2625
02:07:16,541 --> 02:07:18,320
that's freaky spot.
You know,

2626
02:07:18,580 --> 02:07:22,780
being around those ancient ruins is one 
of the most bizarre moments I think I've

2627
02:07:22,781 --> 02:07:27,781
ever had.
Just walking around knowing that people 

2628
02:07:27,781 --> 02:07:30,421
were playing football with human heads 
where I was standing scant 1500 plus 

2629
02:07:31,151 --> 02:07:33,030
years ago or whatever it was.
Um,

2630
02:07:33,670 --> 02:07:35,000
so this,
uh,

2631
02:07:35,050 --> 02:07:37,480
these,
these altered states that,

2632
02:07:37,481 --> 02:07:39,610
uh,
you achieve with zen meditation,

2633
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:42,250
do you,
do you find them to be psychedelic?

2634
02:07:42,251 --> 02:07:44,800
Do you find like that you can 
hallucinate,

2635
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:45,280
do you?

2636
02:07:46,180 --> 02:07:46,560
Well,
they,

2637
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:48,880
you're not supposed to.
That's not the goal.

2638
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:53,140
They have this word called,
which means a demon.

2639
02:07:53,470 --> 02:07:56,150
And what it means is after a certain 
point in,

2640
02:07:56,151 --> 02:08:01,151
in meditation,
demons start appearing in your brain 

2641
02:08:01,151 --> 02:08:05,460
where you've cut out all sensory stimuli
and suddenly images start coming up that

2642
02:08:07,061 --> 02:08:09,820
are just weird and random and somewhat 
frightening.

2643
02:08:10,140 --> 02:08:10,990
Uh,
and I,

2644
02:08:10,991 --> 02:08:14,980
that happens to me all the time,
like a almost or like in a dream state,

2645
02:08:14,981 --> 02:08:19,981
you know,
how in dreams their thoughts and images 

2646
02:08:19,981 --> 02:08:21,730
that it seems so random and sometimes 
scary by how random they are.

2647
02:08:21,910 --> 02:08:26,910
You're consciously getting that in your 
head as you're entering deeper and 

2648
02:08:26,910 --> 02:08:29,440
deeper into this state,
but you're trying to push past that.

2649
02:08:29,441 --> 02:08:33,790
You're trying to push to the state where
there's nothing coming in at all and you

2650
02:08:33,791 --> 02:08:38,791
kind of transcend the,
this sort of thinking state that you're 

2651
02:08:39,431 --> 02:08:42,010
constantly in.
Can't really put it in words.

2652
02:08:42,011 --> 02:08:43,720
I don't even want to try and put it in 
words.

2653
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:48,790
So the goal isn't really to have these 
vivid hallucinations,

2654
02:08:48,791 --> 02:08:51,010
but they happen and they're very 
interesting.

2655
02:08:51,070 --> 02:08:53,850
That's fascinating though,
that it's thought to be demons.

2656
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:58,320
Yeah.
And in the traditional zen form,

2657
02:08:58,321 --> 02:08:59,640
they,
that's what they call them.

2658
02:08:59,970 --> 02:09:02,670
Um,
and uh,

2659
02:09:03,180 --> 02:09:05,120
I know that,
um,

2660
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:10,520
they have in japanese iconography these 
very frightening looking demon like 

2661
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:13,290
figures and then they do actually have a
concept of hell,

2662
02:09:13,730 --> 02:09:14,450
uh,
in,

2663
02:09:14,460 --> 02:09:19,460
in japanese culture that came into zen 
buddhism and I know hakuin talks about 

2664
02:09:20,610 --> 02:09:25,610
these very vivid images of demons that 
he had when he was a child that he was 

2665
02:09:25,681 --> 02:09:29,790
so afraid of them that he decided he had
to get into buddhism and zen to overcome

2666
02:09:29,791 --> 02:09:32,400
them.
So I don't know exactly.

2667
02:09:32,401 --> 02:09:37,401
I'm not going to be hallucinating these 
japanese demons that were probably very 

2668
02:09:37,401 --> 02:09:38,790
much in their minds and in their 
culture.

2669
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:40,680
Uh,
but if,

2670
02:09:41,310 --> 02:09:42,510
you know,
it's interesting.

2671
02:09:42,511 --> 02:09:47,511
This is a total,
I don't know how far we're getting away 

2672
02:09:47,511 --> 02:09:47,511
from things here,
but there's no getting away.

2673
02:09:47,511 --> 02:09:50,360
Okay.
This is concept in ancient times.

2674
02:09:50,360 --> 02:09:52,710
So there's a great book called the 
bicameral mind.

2675
02:09:52,711 --> 02:09:54,810
I don't know if you're familiar with it.
I never read it though.

2676
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:57,600
The ideal is in this book is that for 
ancient people,

2677
02:09:57,870 --> 02:10:02,870
consciousness was almost like a voice in
their head and it flipped them out and 

2678
02:10:02,870 --> 02:10:05,640
they couldn't understand it and they 
were constantly like on drugs.

2679
02:10:05,790 --> 02:10:10,260
Hearing their own thoughts and that's 
why they had to project it onto gods and

2680
02:10:10,261 --> 02:10:12,660
demons and other things that are out 
there in the world,

2681
02:10:12,810 --> 02:10:17,810
but literally hearing their own thoughts
was almost like a continual trip for 

2682
02:10:18,721 --> 02:10:23,721
them.
It's hard for us to imagine because 

2683
02:10:23,721 --> 02:10:23,721
we're so used to the chatter in our 
minds,

2684
02:10:23,721 --> 02:10:24,600
but originally,
according to this man,

2685
02:10:25,650 --> 02:10:30,650
this was how they experienced 
consciousness with this in the early 

2686
02:10:30,650 --> 02:10:31,870
days of language.
Is this a

2687
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:34,250
fairly recent?
Is that was the idea

2688
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:38,180
behind it is 6,000,
7,000,

2689
02:10:38,181 --> 02:10:39,350
10,000
bc.

2690
02:10:39,950 --> 02:10:42,140
It's a,
I can't remember the writer's name.

2691
02:10:42,150 --> 02:10:44,720
Julian something or his last name is 
julian.

2692
02:10:44,990 --> 02:10:46,390
Great book.
Um,

2693
02:10:47,330 --> 02:10:50,540
but if you read books like about 
buddhism,

2694
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:52,520
which I do for racially,
uh,

2695
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:54,010
the history of it,
uh,

2696
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:57,170
early people in meditation,
early adherence to buddhism,

2697
02:10:57,171 --> 02:11:02,171
we're constantly talking about that 
chatter in their mind as if it were 

2698
02:11:02,171 --> 02:11:05,411
hell.
It was like hearing this noise of 

2699
02:11:05,411 --> 02:11:08,681
thoughts was just awful.
It was claustrophobic and frightening 

2700
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:14,920
and they had to get into meditation and 
buddhism just to calm the mind down and 

2701
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:16,220
not hear that voice in their heads.
Now,

2702
02:11:16,221 --> 02:11:21,221
this is a totally alien notion to us 
because we're so used to it and it's 

2703
02:11:21,221 --> 02:11:22,640
almost not a good thing that we're so 
used to it.

2704
02:11:23,070 --> 02:11:24,980
Um,
but I think that that's sort of the idea

2705
02:11:24,981 --> 02:11:28,460
of the demons constantly hearing this 
voice,

2706
02:11:28,461 --> 02:11:32,270
these things in your head that aren't,
you're not willing them,

2707
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:38,260
you know,
like you're not willing these thoughts 

2708
02:11:38,260 --> 02:11:38,260
that are constantly coming up into your 
mind.

2709
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:42,620
Where are they coming from?
There's a great zen cohen called,

2710
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:46,610
who is the master?
Where are your thoughts coming from?

2711
02:11:46,611 --> 02:11:49,520
Who is the master calling up these 
thoughts in your head,

2712
02:11:49,521 --> 02:11:52,280
particularly in your dreams or 
particularly when you're not,

2713
02:11:52,730 --> 02:11:56,060
when you're maybe tired and suddenly 
this image comes up,

2714
02:11:56,270 --> 02:11:57,470
you're not calling it up.
Well,

2715
02:11:57,471 --> 02:12:00,920
where is it coming from?
That's where I think this idea of demons

2716
02:12:00,921 --> 02:12:01,940
is,
is connected.

2717
02:12:01,941 --> 02:12:06,880
This reminds me a lot of going through a
psychedelic experience like iowasca in,

2718
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:11,920
in that path,
you reach this very visual point in the 

2719
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:12,830
experience,
which is generally,

2720
02:12:12,831 --> 02:12:16,730
it can either be incredibly beautiful or
it can be incredibly hellish.

2721
02:12:16,810 --> 02:12:20,270
Like would make well incredibly hellish.
For example,

2722
02:12:20,271 --> 02:12:20,890
I'm,
I'm,

2723
02:12:21,410 --> 02:12:26,410
I have different spiders going inside of
me and laying eggs and exploding and 

2724
02:12:26,410 --> 02:12:28,490
bugs are coming out of me.
There's eels coming inside,

2725
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:32,270
eating through my intestines and eating 
all my organs coming out.

2726
02:12:32,450 --> 02:12:35,690
I'm sliding naked through a va,
down a vine of thorns.

2727
02:12:35,691 --> 02:12:40,691
It's ripping up my flesh.
These are all images that happened in 

2728
02:12:40,691 --> 02:12:44,330
moscow trip or incredibly beautiful,
the most beautiful colors you've ever 

2729
02:12:44,330 --> 02:12:44,600
seen.
The most beautiful lights,

2730
02:12:44,630 --> 02:12:46,730
images,
things and you know,

2731
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:50,990
I get a lot of people asking me about 
these trips and for them that is,

2732
02:12:51,590 --> 02:12:53,420
you know,
who haven't done it very much.

2733
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:58,660
They focus very much on those visions,
but those visions are almost like the 

2734
02:12:58,660 --> 02:13:02,270
fireworks and the chatter to what's 
going to come after and what comes after

2735
02:13:02,271 --> 02:13:05,390
is this kind of oneness with your 
thoughts and your,

2736
02:13:05,630 --> 02:13:10,630
your highest consciousness in your 
highest being that has passed all that 

2737
02:13:10,630 --> 02:13:12,920
and maybe that brings up resistances.
Things you can overcome.

2738
02:13:12,921 --> 02:13:16,420
Maybe it helps you with some thoughts,
but the real value of it in Iowa,

2739
02:13:16,421 --> 02:13:21,380
oscar dmt or any kind of psychedelic is 
that period after were these demons,

2740
02:13:21,381 --> 02:13:26,381
are these visions.
And everything goes away and to me 

2741
02:13:26,381 --> 02:13:26,381
that's the real end goal.
That's the real gem.

2742
02:13:26,381 --> 02:13:29,690
Well that's really similar to the zen 
meditation because you're going through.

2743
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:32,100
So I meditate for 35,

2744
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:34,560
40 minutes,
the first 25,

2745
02:13:35,050 --> 02:13:37,140
I'm having those demons.
I'm hearing my thoughts.

2746
02:13:37,141 --> 02:13:42,141
I'm trying to get over.
And then I finally reached that state 

2747
02:13:42,141 --> 02:13:43,140
only lasts for 15 minutes.
That's the best state.

2748
02:13:43,141 --> 02:13:45,270
It also sent a similar process.
That's it.

2749
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:47,940
Yeah.
So it's not so much about the visions,

2750
02:13:47,941 --> 02:13:49,950
it's about what happens after the 
vision.

2751
02:13:49,951 --> 02:13:51,750
So it seems to me very much like what 
you're saying.

2752
02:13:52,450 --> 02:13:55,180
Yeah,
the that state after very difficult yoga

2753
02:13:55,181 --> 02:13:57,820
sessions,
it doesn't last very long,

2754
02:13:57,821 --> 02:14:02,821
but there's a period of intense 
relaxation and enlightenment that you 

2755
02:14:03,161 --> 02:14:06,280
achieve where you kind of have a better 
perspective of things,

2756
02:14:06,281 --> 02:14:09,940
but it only comes through this very 
difficult work of the hour and a half of

2757
02:14:09,941 --> 02:14:11,980
yoga that you have to do to get to that 
spot.

2758
02:14:12,430 --> 02:14:14,380
And if you have acid anywhere along the 
way,

2759
02:14:14,381 --> 02:14:17,500
you don't reach that spot.
I don't reach that spot every time.

2760
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:19,150
You know,
I reached it a lot,

2761
02:14:19,151 --> 02:14:21,790
but I don't reach it every time.
It's very tricky,

2762
02:14:21,791 --> 02:14:22,210
isn't it?

2763
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:24,540
Yeah.
You'd ever know and they're like,

2764
02:14:25,170 --> 02:14:30,170
I don't know if it's the same with 
archery or the things that you do like 

2765
02:14:30,170 --> 02:14:33,021
that,
but when you start the meditation you 

2766
02:14:33,021 --> 02:14:35,160
bring a mood and it's never the same 
sunday for no reason.

2767
02:14:35,550 --> 02:14:40,550
I just falls into place and some days 
you don't know why this anxiety is not 

2768
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:46,100
on your inside.
You never could figure out what you 

2769
02:14:46,100 --> 02:14:46,100
bring to it.
It's interesting.

2770
02:14:46,100 --> 02:14:50,290
It really is.
What do you have a very rigid schedule 

2771
02:14:50,691 --> 02:14:53,510
when it comes to your meditation and 
your discipline?

2772
02:14:53,511 --> 02:14:58,180
Like how do you structure your days?
You're obviously self employed,

2773
02:14:58,240 --> 02:15:00,350
you know you're a writer.
So do you.

2774
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:05,400
Do you have a structure?
Like I must write for this amount of 

2775
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:05,400
time.
I must meditate.

2776
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:05,400
Like how do you,
how do you do it?

2777
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:07,770
No,
I every morning I wake up and I meditate

2778
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:13,220
for 35 minutes and nothing will stop me.
I'm sick.

2779
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:17,360
Or even if I'm traveling or whatever,
every day.

2780
02:15:18,050 --> 02:15:23,050
Do you sit in a particular way?
I have the proper pillows and I have a 

2781
02:15:24,151 --> 02:15:29,151
little place and I have a little clock 
that goes off with bells and I sit in 

2782
02:15:29,151 --> 02:15:32,400
the lotus position until my legs are 
like screaming

2783
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:34,050
really,
that you can pull your legs up.

2784
02:15:35,300 --> 02:15:36,270
Yeah.
It's hard to do,

2785
02:15:36,271 --> 02:15:36,460
huh?

2786
02:15:37,170 --> 02:15:38,170
Yeah.
I've been doing it for many,

2787
02:15:38,171 --> 02:15:43,171
many years,
but then I recently broke my foot and I 

2788
02:15:43,171 --> 02:15:44,530
couldn't do it for about three months,
so now I'm fine and I can do it.

2789
02:15:44,710 --> 02:15:47,310
So I'm back to having some pain again.
Uh,

2790
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:49,870
but the pain is good as we all know.
Um,

2791
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:51,100
and then I,
uh,

2792
02:15:51,101 --> 02:15:54,070
then I,
I'm not usually writing because my books

2793
02:15:54,071 --> 02:15:56,440
require so much research.
Uh,

2794
02:15:56,441 --> 02:16:01,030
so right now I'm in a research period 
where I'm reading for racial sleep books

2795
02:16:01,031 --> 02:16:02,890
about human nature,
psychology,

2796
02:16:02,900 --> 02:16:07,900
etc.
And then in Nevada year I'm going to 

2797
02:16:07,900 --> 02:16:09,710
start writing and then I go onto a kind 
of a different routine where I'm a,

2798
02:16:09,711 --> 02:16:12,550
I'm a little more crazed and hard to be 
around.

2799
02:16:13,070 --> 02:16:16,310
That's fascinating.
So you researched for a full year before

2800
02:16:16,311 --> 02:16:16,580
then,
right?

2801
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:21,920
Yeah.
You discipline the research aspect of 

2802
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:21,920
it.

2803
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:21,920
Oh man,
I'm so disciplined.

2804
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:26,020
It's probably bordering on ocd.
I read,

2805
02:16:26,070 --> 02:16:27,250
you know,
three,

2806
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:29,560
400 books and I read them,
I don't them.

2807
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:35,100
And then I go back and I do these note 
cards and it's the note cards that's 

2808
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:35,890
excruciating.
That's like the bill bradley part.

2809
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:39,610
I put every book onto maybe 10,
20,

2810
02:16:39,611 --> 02:16:41,800
30 cards depending on how good a book it
is.

2811
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:47,160
And at the end I'll have two,
3000 cards and I can written handwritten

2812
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:51,670
and I can take these cards and move them
around and in the book is created out of

2813
02:16:51,671 --> 02:16:52,300
the cards.

2814
02:16:52,670 --> 02:16:57,670
So the cards are the beneficial aspects 
of whatever book you're reading or what 

2815
02:16:57,670 --> 02:16:58,340
strikes you or.

2816
02:16:58,470 --> 02:17:01,500
But I'm able to break a book down that 
can be chaotic.

2817
02:17:01,501 --> 02:17:04,080
So for instance,
for this new book,

2818
02:17:04,380 --> 02:17:06,480
uh,
I have it a love a niche,

2819
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:08,460
a lot.
I've never loved them since I was a kid.

2820
02:17:08,550 --> 02:17:11,940
Uber manch the uber manch.
This is a book about the uber match.

2821
02:17:11,941 --> 02:17:16,941
My next book,
and there's a book that I've read for 

2822
02:17:16,941 --> 02:17:16,941
him,
uh,

2823
02:17:16,941 --> 02:17:19,710
early book called human all too human.
That's just the most amazing book,

2824
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:22,650
but it's chaotic.
It's all over the place.

2825
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:27,680
He's got all these aphorisms and these 
thoughts and it's just like entering a 

2826
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:32,040
rat's maze.
I with my cards can organize all of his 

2827
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:36,441
ideas and all of his thoughts and bring 
some order and show you the amazing 

2828
02:17:36,750 --> 02:17:41,220
pearls of wisdom this guy has gleaned 
out of his mad syphilitic brain.

2829
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:43,020
The syphilis.
Oh yeah.

2830
02:17:43,021 --> 02:17:43,420
He,
yeah.

2831
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:48,440
He went mad at the age of like 44 and 
the best spent his last eight years and 

2832
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:49,590
basically too much pussy,
huh?

2833
02:17:50,100 --> 02:17:51,390
no crazy.
Well,

2834
02:17:51,690 --> 02:17:54,300
he probably not enough pussy really?
So you got syphilis.

2835
02:17:54,301 --> 02:17:55,620
Pussy.
He got.

2836
02:17:55,650 --> 02:18:00,650
He probably went to a prostitute when he
was in the prussian war and then got 

2837
02:18:00,650 --> 02:18:01,530
syphilis and then he.
He didn't get laid enough.

2838
02:18:01,531 --> 02:18:05,160
I was certainly probably his problem.
That was why he was obsessed with uber.

2839
02:18:05,161 --> 02:18:09,300
Manch a syphilis.
That's probably why he got.

2840
02:18:10,030 --> 02:18:12,210
It's probably not the not getting laid.

2841
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:17,640
What'd they do?
Back in those days when you had 

2842
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:17,640
syphilis,
there was no cure,

2843
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:19,570
right?
You an apple or something like that.

2844
02:18:21,190 --> 02:18:23,050
That was before penicillin,
right?

2845
02:18:23,051 --> 02:18:24,120
Yeah.
Nothing much to do.

2846
02:18:24,130 --> 02:18:29,130
I think some,
some people were smart enough to start 

2847
02:18:29,130 --> 02:18:32,490
trying silver.
I think silver had some use in some of 

2848
02:18:32,490 --> 02:18:32,920
these things,
but it's not verY effective.

2849
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:35,320
Not like,
not like an antibiotic.

2850
02:18:35,510 --> 02:18:38,350
Yeah.
It's fascinating because I was trying to

2851
02:18:38,351 --> 02:18:43,351
explain to my kids the plague because 
we're reading a book and my five year 

2852
02:18:43,351 --> 02:18:48,241
old and my three year old,
we're sitting in bed reading before 

2853
02:18:48,241 --> 02:18:50,911
bedtime.
And the story involved the plague a 

2854
02:18:50,911 --> 02:18:51,310
plague upon you was one of the lines and
uh,

2855
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:52,540
you know,
they were like,

2856
02:18:52,541 --> 02:18:54,970
what's a plug?
That's shit.

2857
02:18:54,971 --> 02:18:57,880
Before doctors,
when they didn't really have doctors,

2858
02:18:57,881 --> 02:19:00,850
when all doctors could do is like cutoff
broken limbs.

2859
02:19:01,230 --> 02:19:01,690
They,
uh,

2860
02:19:01,710 --> 02:19:04,540
they had diseases that would kill giant 
chunks of people.

2861
02:19:04,541 --> 02:19:05,860
My kids are like,
what the fuck?

2862
02:19:05,861 --> 02:19:06,520
I'm like,
yeah,

2863
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:09,160
not that long ago by the way.
They wrote about it.

2864
02:19:09,161 --> 02:19:12,130
So they had language and we were,
were,

2865
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:17,160
were,
were talking about earlier about the 

2866
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:17,160
evolution of civilization and the amount
of time,

2867
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:21,571
the very brief window between us and 
when we were animals in relationship to 

2868
02:19:21,641 --> 02:19:26,110
the length of time that things have been
alive on earth.

2869
02:19:26,140 --> 02:19:27,560
It's smaLl.

2870
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:32,330
We're going through the most crazy and 
chaotic time pretty much ever.

2871
02:19:32,331 --> 02:19:34,670
When the wheel,
you know,

2872
02:19:34,671 --> 02:19:39,671
descrIption that mckenna used to use 
about the exponential growth of 

2873
02:19:39,671 --> 02:19:42,641
technology was about sending a ball 
around the top of a funnel and then it 

2874
02:19:42,891 --> 02:19:47,891
takes a long time to get around the top,
but that we're somewhere towards the 

2875
02:19:48,531 --> 02:19:51,350
bottom of the funnel now where that 
fucking thing is going around the tunnel

2876
02:19:51,590 --> 02:19:53,690
going around the funnel so quickly.
it's just,

2877
02:19:54,170 --> 02:19:57,020
it's hard for us to really wrap our 
heads around.

2878
02:19:57,021 --> 02:20:02,021
But when we talk to children about it,
when I talk to children about it really 

2879
02:20:02,021 --> 02:20:04,040
sends it home.
When I tried to describe to my kids what

2880
02:20:04,340 --> 02:20:05,530
would a fucking plague is,

2881
02:20:05,570 --> 02:20:08,870
as you know,
and just.

2882
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:14,170
I just remind,
reminded myself of when you read actual 

2883
02:20:14,170 --> 02:20:15,530
accounts of the true pirates like 
blackbeard and things like that.

2884
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:18,170
One of the things that they would barter
with for the most,

2885
02:20:18,171 --> 02:20:20,520
like when they were making deals with,
you know,

2886
02:20:20,730 --> 02:20:25,730
the british ships or different thIngs 
and striking deals was venereal disease 

2887
02:20:25,730 --> 02:20:27,290
medicine.
Like syphilis medicine.

2888
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:29,870
Like it'd be like we'll give you all the
gold,

2889
02:20:29,900 --> 02:20:34,340
but you have to bring over a chest of,
of a medicine to cure that.

2890
02:20:34,341 --> 02:20:39,341
Venereal disease,
I think that was a probably a much 

2891
02:20:39,341 --> 02:20:40,210
bigger problem in ancient history than 
not.

2892
02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:43,370
We're not completely ancient,
but in past civilization than we give it

2893
02:20:43,371 --> 02:20:47,030
credit people first venereal disease.
I don't know.

2894
02:20:47,031 --> 02:20:48,860
I have no idea how fucking dirty trick,

2895
02:20:50,020 --> 02:20:52,760
you know.
I mean think about how few diseases kill

2896
02:20:52,761 --> 02:20:55,520
you that you catch it just walking 
around like the flu,

2897
02:20:56,060 --> 02:20:59,000
but you know,
I think it might be nature's way to keep

2898
02:20:59,001 --> 02:21:01,280
the population down a little bit.
Most likely,

2899
02:21:01,281 --> 02:21:01,860
right?
Yeah.

2900
02:21:01,970 --> 02:21:05,270
I mean it seems like what's going on,
there's always a battle,

2901
02:21:05,271 --> 02:21:10,271
right?
Just like we were talking about the 

2902
02:21:10,271 --> 02:21:11,921
battle between discipline and success,
the battle between being uncomfortable 

2903
02:21:11,921 --> 02:21:13,070
and doing things that are hard to do and
the reaping,

2904
02:21:13,071 --> 02:21:18,071
the rewards of that seems to be a battle
nature of trying to fucking kill us so 

2905
02:21:18,071 --> 02:21:18,710
we get stronger.
You know?

2906
02:21:18,711 --> 02:21:20,540
I mean,
we don't like to think that,

2907
02:21:20,541 --> 02:21:25,541
but it's been directly proven that many 
plagues and many diseases have certain 

2908
02:21:26,181 --> 02:21:31,181
traits have risen through those,
through those diseases which have made 

2909
02:21:31,181 --> 02:21:31,190
the human race actually stronger.

2910
02:21:31,640 --> 02:21:36,640
Although they say our cro,
magnon ancestors,

2911
02:21:36,861 --> 02:21:39,050
for Instance,
lived longer than we do.

2912
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:40,080
Really?
Yeah.

2913
02:21:40,550 --> 02:21:41,780
I've never heard that.
Wow.

2914
02:21:41,781 --> 02:21:44,510
That's amazing.
And they've died at like 12.

2915
02:21:45,830 --> 02:21:46,850
Um,
I mean,

2916
02:21:46,910 --> 02:21:49,160
I know in the bible,
but who believes the bible?

2917
02:21:49,190 --> 02:21:50,470
Oh,
600 years ago,

2918
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:54,740
like moses died at the age of 193.
That's a little shaky.

2919
02:21:55,050 --> 02:21:55,760
I know.
It is.

2920
02:21:55,770 --> 02:21:57,210
They didn't know what a year was back 
then.

2921
02:21:57,211 --> 02:22:02,211
Now they're making shit up now.
The calendar suck written on a rock that

2922
02:22:03,931 --> 02:22:04,790
you can't really.
Yeah.

2923
02:22:04,860 --> 02:22:07,920
That's a lot of shit in the bible.
It's fucking tough to swallow.

2924
02:22:08,600 --> 02:22:09,900
Yeah.
Um,

2925
02:22:10,680 --> 02:22:13,110
so where did you read the cro?
Magnon lived longer than us.

2926
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:15,180
Uh,
well,

2927
02:22:15,181 --> 02:22:19,800
for one thIng that's for certain,
they were bigger than we were real.

2928
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:21,940
Uh,
they had a,

2929
02:22:22,290 --> 02:22:24,840
they were taller.
That's a known fact.

2930
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:27,210
Agriculture.
Uh,

2931
02:22:27,211 --> 02:22:32,211
we did not have certain diseases that we
have now talked to the paleo people and 

2932
02:22:32,221 --> 02:22:34,110
they can fill you with,
with all that stuff.

2933
02:22:34,610 --> 02:22:39,610
Uh,
but before we started having grains and 

2934
02:22:39,610 --> 02:22:41,700
all that bad stuff,
people were perhaps living longer.

2935
02:22:41,701 --> 02:22:42,870
They were certainly bigger.

2936
02:22:43,780 --> 02:22:45,940
magnum was five foot seven,
five foot nine.

2937
02:22:46,770 --> 02:22:47,350
Oh you're,
you're,

2938
02:22:47,360 --> 02:22:48,640
you're,
you're showing me wrong.

2939
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:52,260
But they were taller than the people 
that came after them.

2940
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:53,400
Oh,
okay.

2941
02:22:53,800 --> 02:22:55,360
Well,
there are.

2942
02:22:55,361 --> 02:23:00,361
That's the average,
but large males stood as tall six foot 

2943
02:23:00,361 --> 02:23:01,330
five.
Not really taller than us.

2944
02:23:01,720 --> 02:23:06,720
Okay.
But taller then the people living than 

2945
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:06,830
the humans of those after

2946
02:23:07,510 --> 02:23:12,510
in ancient Greece or whatever.
Nothing like the internet to be able to 

2947
02:23:12,510 --> 02:23:12,510
show that

2948
02:23:12,510 --> 02:23:12,930
wrong.
You know,

2949
02:23:13,160 --> 02:23:15,490
10 years ago there was no way you 
would've been able to prove me wrong.

2950
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:18,880
We've had many examples of people 
stating,

2951
02:23:19,260 --> 02:23:24,260
I know you're not doing it,
but there's been a lot of people that 

2952
02:23:24,260 --> 02:23:24,260
have bullshitted us.
Yeah.

2953
02:23:24,260 --> 02:23:26,080
Unfortunately,
and I've spread information,

2954
02:23:26,081 --> 02:23:29,050
so now I have to be diligent about that.
What does that wikipedia.

2955
02:23:29,830 --> 02:23:32,320
This is wikipedia,
but it has references.

2956
02:23:32,350 --> 02:23:35,560
If you'd like me to find the scientific 
references there in there as well.

2957
02:23:35,561 --> 02:23:37,980
Don't get crazy.
I think that.

2958
02:23:38,010 --> 02:23:43,010
I think the path back between what we're
talking about is that life itself needs 

2959
02:23:43,010 --> 02:23:44,950
resistance.
Just as masters need resistance,

2960
02:23:44,951 --> 02:23:46,240
you know?
I mean there is no,

2961
02:23:46,570 --> 02:23:51,570
there is no life that's worth living.
IF everything is like that Alan Watts 

2962
02:23:51,570 --> 02:23:55,741
video,
if we could make everything absolutely 

2963
02:23:55,741 --> 02:23:56,260
perfect and nothing is a surprise and 
there's no resistance out there,

2964
02:23:56,440 --> 02:23:58,450
it doesn't become what it is.

2965
02:23:58,450 --> 02:24:01,630
It's not as rich anymore.
It's not filled with the magic that life

2966
02:24:01,810 --> 02:24:02,680
can be.
I mean,

2967
02:24:02,681 --> 02:24:07,681
resistance is an intrinsic part of that.
And the fact that nature is constantly 

2968
02:24:07,681 --> 02:24:07,960
looking to,
you know,

2969
02:24:08,350 --> 02:24:13,350
pick us off is part of that resistance 
and the fact that all of these forces 

2970
02:24:13,350 --> 02:24:16,450
are aligned against someone who's trying
to become a master.

2971
02:24:16,451 --> 02:24:19,510
The pain sacriFice,
whatever people are saying,

2972
02:24:19,511 --> 02:24:24,511
all of that,
that is required for a master to be 

2973
02:24:24,511 --> 02:24:24,511
created,
you know,

2974
02:24:24,511 --> 02:24:25,870
that's,
it's all part of the same thing.

2975
02:24:25,871 --> 02:24:30,871
you know,
it's this kind of dualism of force and 

2976
02:24:30,871 --> 02:24:34,111
opposition.
The average liFe expectancy of cro 

2977
02:24:34,111 --> 02:24:34,510
magnon was 35 years.
Alright.

2978
02:24:34,570 --> 02:24:35,260
Alright.
So I met,

2979
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:37,500
I meant the high.
Sorry,

2980
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:41,680
did most of them.
I've got something.

2981
02:24:41,681 --> 02:24:43,270
I've got something that's maybe on 
chromat.

2982
02:24:44,490 --> 02:24:48,240
I better shut up.
40th five would be exceptionally old for

2983
02:24:48,241 --> 02:24:49,090
cro,
magnon math.

2984
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:52,120
So if I was crow bag now,
might be the fucking old wise man in the

2985
02:24:52,121 --> 02:24:57,121
village she gets compared to the people 
who got into agricultural settlements 

2986
02:24:57,121 --> 02:25:00,160
after cro magnon they didn't live to be 
35 years old.

2987
02:25:01,160 --> 02:25:05,560
That age is also factoring or infant 
mortality for things like that.

2988
02:25:05,561 --> 02:25:07,780
Things don't happen.
Disease mortality,

2989
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:09,220
you know,
it doesn't mean that the,

2990
02:25:09,480 --> 02:25:11,530
a healthy crow bangin wouldn't live 
longer.

2991
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:12,740
That's the,
that's the big things.

2992
02:25:12,760 --> 02:25:14,980
Factoring infant mortality.
That's a big one,

2993
02:25:14,981 --> 02:25:15,710
right?
Yeah.

2994
02:25:15,740 --> 02:25:18,460
Mother's dying in childbirth.
Shit that doesn't happen anymore.

2995
02:25:18,490 --> 02:25:20,590
You know,
that raises or as much.

2996
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:21,100
Yeah.

2997
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:26,760
Um,
but when I came back to what you were 

2998
02:25:26,760 --> 02:25:28,850
saying in the preface to mastery,
I try and say the times that we live in,

2999
02:25:28,860 --> 02:25:29,370
first of all,
I,

3000
02:25:29,371 --> 02:25:31,960
I make the point that we need masters in
the world now.

3001
02:25:33,010 --> 02:25:38,010
This is a time where we have incredible 
opportunitY largely through the internet

3002
02:25:39,310 --> 02:25:42,550
where access to information,
the ability to learn things,

3003
02:25:42,551 --> 02:25:45,580
to develop skills,
to have an isolation tank,

3004
02:25:45,581 --> 02:25:48,340
to learn archery,
to do all of these things.

3005
02:25:48,670 --> 02:25:53,670
The world is opened up and the ability 
to develop skills and master something 

3006
02:25:53,670 --> 02:25:58,501
and create something is just completely 
unprecedented at the same time.

3007
02:25:59,290 --> 02:26:04,290
The distractions and the resistance that
we have to go through is equally 

3008
02:26:04,290 --> 02:26:07,420
unprecedented with the internet,
with iphones,

3009
02:26:07,421 --> 02:26:12,421
with all the other things that are 
making it so much harder for us to 

3010
02:26:12,421 --> 02:26:16,891
focus,
and I want you to think of all of these 

3011
02:26:16,891 --> 02:26:19,741
things as the kind of the water that you
have to swim against and if you're able 

3012
02:26:19,741 --> 02:26:24,631
to swim against all of these 
distractions that the world throws at 

3013
02:26:24,631 --> 02:26:27,841
you,
you're going to become a real kick ass 

3014
02:26:27,841 --> 02:26:30,961
master in whatever it is because you've 
overcome something that 90 percent of 

3015
02:26:31,541 --> 02:26:35,260
the people in this world just submerges 
them under because they're too weak.

3016
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:40,680
But there's also the clIche and it's 
very important to point out that there 

3017
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:44,301
is no end result.
That it's a journey and this journey 

3018
02:26:44,301 --> 02:26:45,510
does not mean becoming a master.
There's not.

3019
02:26:45,870 --> 02:26:48,720
There's no end point.
You continue to get better at everything

3020
02:26:48,721 --> 02:26:52,350
you do or you start to suck and that 
that's what happens.

3021
02:26:52,590 --> 02:26:55,860
You will get better if you do not 
continue to get better.

3022
02:26:55,861 --> 02:26:56,940
You are getting worse.

3023
02:26:57,350 --> 02:26:58,280
Yeah.
Yeah,

3024
02:26:58,400 --> 02:26:59,390
it's true.
And uh,

3025
02:27:00,020 --> 02:27:01,460
you know,
you take someone like einstein,

3026
02:27:01,461 --> 02:27:06,461
one of the greatest masters,
he discovers the second theory of 

3027
02:27:06,461 --> 02:27:08,630
relativity at the age of 26 and nothing 
after that,

3028
02:27:09,740 --> 02:27:11,430
he tried to do his unified theory.

3029
02:27:11,770 --> 02:27:12,330
You know,
why?

3030
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:17,770
Why posey again?
All that scientist was too much.

3031
02:27:17,860 --> 02:27:19,120
oh,
you mean he had too much?

3032
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:22,690
So I was a famous pussy out.
A lot of people don't know that.

3033
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:24,340
It's true.
It is true.

3034
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:25,480
Yeah.
Einstein loved it.

3035
02:27:25,720 --> 02:27:26,970
He was smart.
So it was fine.

3036
02:27:26,980 --> 02:27:31,980
When you know,
two guys with the most brilliant minds 

3037
02:27:31,980 --> 02:27:32,020
of the 20th century,
love pussy,

3038
02:27:32,710 --> 02:27:36,250
don't want to go to baptist.
A big old smile on einstein's face,

3039
02:27:37,220 --> 02:27:40,510
wacky fucking image going on him and 
loved him.

3040
02:27:41,140 --> 02:27:42,050
He was like,
yeah,

3041
02:27:42,130 --> 02:27:43,180
why wouldn't you?
I mean,

3042
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:48,600
you talk about all the favorable traits 
for evolutionary success talking about 

3043
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:50,830
one of the most brilliant men 
scientifically ever.

3044
02:27:51,100 --> 02:27:56,100
Yeah.
I would think that a lot of women will 

3045
02:27:56,100 --> 02:27:56,100
want that seed inside of them.
You know,

3046
02:27:56,100 --> 02:27:56,100
look at it.
He's like,

3047
02:27:56,100 --> 02:27:58,240
see this,
look at that lady's fuck gene simmons.

3048
02:27:58,340 --> 02:28:02,140
Look at that as the tongue of a fucking 
super genius with his own hair.

3049
02:28:04,430 --> 02:28:06,370
He was,
excuse me.

3050
02:28:06,371 --> 02:28:11,110
He was a very unique individual in that 
that uniqueness.

3051
02:28:11,111 --> 02:28:13,540
I'm sure there was some motivation 
behind that,

3052
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:18,720
not just the scientific motivation,
but the actual natural motivation to be 

3053
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:21,330
exceptional for breeding purposes that 
you know,

3054
02:28:21,350 --> 02:28:23,000
women would find him exceptional.
Yeah,

3055
02:28:23,001 --> 02:28:24,440
absolutely.
Yeah,

3056
02:28:24,660 --> 02:28:29,660
but you're right,
it is a process so that you never can 

3057
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:29,660
sort of rest on your laurels and say,
oh,

3058
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:32,700
so the way I do it,
I'm not saying that I'm a master,

3059
02:28:32,701 --> 02:28:37,701
so don't misinterpret me,
but the way I do it for myself is every 

3060
02:28:37,701 --> 02:28:39,300
book that I write,
I'm back at square one.

3061
02:28:39,940 --> 02:28:41,100
I,
I'm nobody.

3062
02:28:41,220 --> 02:28:45,390
I have no history of no fault readers.
I'm not successful.

3063
02:28:45,780 --> 02:28:49,240
I have to make it's death ground.
I have to make my next book work or I'm.

3064
02:28:49,241 --> 02:28:51,060
I'm a total loser.
So

3065
02:28:51,190 --> 02:28:55,630
that's exactly the same process involved
in standup comedy,

3066
02:28:56,530 --> 02:29:01,530
standup comedy.
You put out a new special and then once 

3067
02:29:01,530 --> 02:29:05,851
you have that new special,
you throw all that material out and you 

3068
02:29:05,851 --> 02:29:08,410
start from scratch and you write all new
material and if you do it that way,

3069
02:29:08,490 --> 02:29:11,590
and that's the only real way to do it in
this day and age,

3070
02:29:11,591 --> 02:29:13,210
because too many people have the 
internet.

3071
02:29:13,211 --> 02:29:14,800
Too many people.
I mean everyone has the internet.

3072
02:29:14,801 --> 02:29:17,350
Obviously too many people have access to
your previous work,

3073
02:29:17,351 --> 02:29:22,351
I should say,
and in comedy you constantly need new 

3074
02:29:22,351 --> 02:29:22,600
material unlike in music.
So rough.

3075
02:29:23,050 --> 02:29:24,100
It's not.
It's great.

3076
02:29:24,160 --> 02:29:25,300
It's rough,
but it's great.

3077
02:29:25,630 --> 02:29:27,550
The roughness is the great part of it.
yeah,

3078
02:29:28,070 --> 02:29:30,820
but that,
that whole process of mastery,

3079
02:29:31,390 --> 02:29:32,950
you know,
you say you're not a master.

3080
02:29:33,370 --> 02:29:36,160
I think you are,
but I think there is none.

3081
02:29:36,610 --> 02:29:40,540
This is what I think you are a master,
but there's no ultimate mastery.

3082
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:44,800
A master is someone who is very good at 
the process,

3083
02:29:45,220 --> 02:29:47,860
but there's no end.
Yeah.

3084
02:29:48,460 --> 02:29:50,200
The end doesn't exist.
There's no.

3085
02:29:50,350 --> 02:29:53,800
There's no where it becomes easy.
There's no golden age of retirement.

3086
02:29:53,801 --> 02:29:58,801
That's a bunch of horse shit that they 
fucking sell you to keep you in your 

3087
02:29:58,801 --> 02:29:58,801
job.
There's no golden age.

3088
02:29:58,801 --> 02:29:59,110
You're fucking dying,
man.

3089
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:04,120
You're going to get old and you're going
to reach that point where you know you 

3090
02:30:04,120 --> 02:30:04,210
can't really work anymore so you don't 
have to work anymore,

3091
02:30:04,211 --> 02:30:06,230
and then you've got to watch your money.
You know this,

3092
02:30:06,310 --> 02:30:09,970
this selling point of one day and you'll
retire and everything will be groovy the

3093
02:30:09,971 --> 02:30:11,800
fuck it will.
It's not going to be groovy.

3094
02:30:11,830 --> 02:30:15,100
There's that whole half waiting for 
something to drop on you.

3095
02:30:15,101 --> 02:30:20,101
Even the religious belief that you go 
through this life and just do your work 

3096
02:30:20,101 --> 02:30:20,101
and then you get to heaven.

3097
02:30:20,101 --> 02:30:20,350
Yay.
You know,

3098
02:30:20,351 --> 02:30:22,240
or you go through.
If it's not religious,

3099
02:30:22,241 --> 02:30:27,241
this capitalist belief you,
you work in this job and it's gonna 

3100
02:30:27,241 --> 02:30:27,241
suck,
but then you get to retire.

3101
02:30:27,250 --> 02:30:30,340
No bullshit.
You got to enjoy that every minute along

3102
02:30:30,341 --> 02:30:32,950
that path that you're going on or choose
a different path.

3103
02:30:32,951 --> 02:30:34,690
Fuck the money.
Fuck everything else.

3104
02:30:34,870 --> 02:30:38,830
Do what you love to do the whole time 
and you'll smile at the end when your,

3105
02:30:38,920 --> 02:30:40,240
when your time is up.
Yeah,

3106
02:30:40,241 --> 02:30:45,241
and if you do use the wrong motivations,
you will not get the results you desire.

3107
02:30:45,880 --> 02:30:50,880
You know,
I know a guy who has been trying to get 

3108
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:53,371
famous forever and he's trying to do it 
in all the wrong ways,

3109
02:30:54,030 --> 02:30:59,030
you know,
it's trying to become famous instead of 

3110
02:30:59,030 --> 02:31:01,681
focusing on whatever art form you choose
to make you famous just wants fame and 

3111
02:31:02,410 --> 02:31:04,930
it just escapes them like sand through 
your fingers.

3112
02:31:04,931 --> 02:31:06,640
You just can't hold onto it.
You just can't,

3113
02:31:06,970 --> 02:31:11,560
can't get a quantifiable amount in your 
hands and the motivation is incorrect.

3114
02:31:11,620 --> 02:31:15,550
It's like the motivation was just on his
art.

3115
02:31:15,850 --> 02:31:18,370
I think probably he would be far more 
successful,

3116
02:31:18,550 --> 02:31:23,550
but instead the motivation is based on 
the green demon of looking at all these 

3117
02:31:23,550 --> 02:31:27,501
other people becoming successful and not
being able to find out why he can't 

3118
02:31:27,501 --> 02:31:27,501
achieve it himself.

3119
02:31:27,501 --> 02:31:29,560
I mean it.
Attention is never the goal in.

3120
02:31:29,570 --> 02:31:31,570
In mastery,
it is actually a negative.

3121
02:31:31,630 --> 02:31:33,220
Yes,
but learning,

3122
02:31:33,250 --> 02:31:35,680
learning is what gets you high.
LeArning is what you love.

3123
02:31:35,681 --> 02:31:38,170
If you love the attention more than the 
learning,

3124
02:31:38,171 --> 02:31:39,700
then you're fucked.
You're never gonna make it.

3125
02:31:39,950 --> 02:31:42,250
Yeah,
and that need,

3126
02:31:42,610 --> 02:31:43,020
that need

3127
02:31:43,130 --> 02:31:48,130
for acceptance and it's like,
it's the very opposite of what you 

3128
02:31:48,130 --> 02:31:48,600
should be striving for.
Yeah.

3129
02:31:49,010 --> 02:31:54,010
You know,
and we were talking about people that 

3130
02:31:54,010 --> 02:31:56,320
become really successful and then lose 
their way and how you can learn so much 

3131
02:31:56,421 --> 02:31:58,340
from that.
And in comedy.

3132
02:31:58,341 --> 02:32:03,341
My um,
my guide for that was always sam 

3133
02:32:03,341 --> 02:32:06,041
kennison because I think that sam 
kennison was the greatest comedian of 

3134
02:32:06,041 --> 02:32:08,880
all time from 1986 to 1987.
I mean,

3135
02:32:08,900 --> 02:32:11,450
I'm not kidding.
I think maybe before that,

3136
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:13,410
you know,
I found out about 86.

3137
02:32:13,420 --> 02:32:16,310
I mean probably it was the greatest and 
85 and maybe even in a four,

3138
02:32:16,580 --> 02:32:21,580
but that's it from then on it's dog shit
if you try to listen to sam kinison from

3139
02:32:21,711 --> 02:32:24,320
89 or 88,
it's terrible comedy.

3140
02:32:24,321 --> 02:32:26,330
I went to see him alive.
He was awful.

3141
02:32:26,930 --> 02:32:30,500
I saw him live several times because it 
was such a huge fan of his work and 86,

3142
02:32:30,890 --> 02:32:31,990
but the dropoff was.

3143
02:32:31,990 --> 02:32:35,000
So there's guys who have good cd's and 
you know,

3144
02:32:35,001 --> 02:32:37,310
they'll have hills and valleys.
I myself,

3145
02:32:37,311 --> 02:32:39,500
I have stuff that I really love and then
stuff I was like,

3146
02:32:39,530 --> 02:32:44,530
well that wasn't my best one,
but then more motivation to do better 

3147
02:32:44,530 --> 02:32:47,270
than the next one.
There's just sometimes creative glitches

3148
02:32:47,271 --> 02:32:49,100
or what have you.
A part of the process,

3149
02:32:49,490 --> 02:32:54,490
but with kennison there's this fucking 
monster peak and then this crazy drop 

3150
02:32:54,640 --> 02:32:58,220
off of coke and hookers.
A coke,

3151
02:32:58,250 --> 02:32:59,780
a lot booze,
a lot.

3152
02:32:59,810 --> 02:33:02,210
You know,
we had mark marin on the podcast who was

3153
02:33:02,450 --> 02:33:07,450
palling around with kennison in the hay 
day at the comedy store when mark was a 

3154
02:33:07,450 --> 02:33:11,150
young kid and he told some amazing 
stories about this,

3155
02:33:11,151 --> 02:33:16,151
the amount of substances.
Mark hung out with kennison and he had 

3156
02:33:16,151 --> 02:33:19,880
to escape.
He left la and he hit it So hard that he

3157
02:33:19,881 --> 02:33:23,330
was hearing voices in his head for like 
almost a year.

3158
02:33:23,540 --> 02:33:28,540
Like literally he was psychotic and I 
met mark soon after that I met mark in 

3159
02:33:28,540 --> 02:33:32,600
boston like after he had been hanging 
out with kennis and after kennison was,

3160
02:33:32,601 --> 02:33:34,850
you know,
riding the wave and you know,

3161
02:33:34,851 --> 02:33:36,460
he,
I met mark I think in [inaudible].

3162
02:33:36,461 --> 02:33:39,050
80 eight was when I started and I met 
him soon after that,

3163
02:33:39,051 --> 02:33:44,051
so he had already gone through all this 
and he was a young guy working at the 

3164
02:33:44,051 --> 02:33:48,401
comedy store and he got to see this,
the overwhelming amount of substances 

3165
02:33:49,221 --> 02:33:52,790
that kinison was consuming and massive 
and it just destroyed him.

3166
02:33:52,791 --> 02:33:55,050
He never recovered from this cocaine,
alcohol.

3167
02:33:55,051 --> 02:33:57,140
I mean that.
It wasn't writing either.

3168
02:33:57,141 --> 02:33:58,850
His brother,
his brother wrote about it.

3169
02:33:58,851 --> 02:34:03,851
There's a book called mY brother sam was
a great book about kennison written by 

3170
02:34:03,851 --> 02:34:03,950
his brother,
who was,

3171
02:34:03,951 --> 02:34:08,040
I think also his manager at the time who
wrote about how there was a.

3172
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:12,440
He wrote about the tangible,
tangible dropoff in his writing.

3173
02:34:12,730 --> 02:34:15,260
It didn't write new materIal anymore and
was sort of like,

3174
02:34:15,330 --> 02:34:16,190
just partying.

3175
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:17,560
Yeah,
I mean there's,

3176
02:34:17,561 --> 02:34:18,040
I talk in

3177
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:23,040
the book about this myth that drugs will
just instantly make you more creative.

3178
02:34:23,591 --> 02:34:25,660
In fact,
it's often the opposite.

3179
02:34:26,150 --> 02:34:31,150
um,
and I have example of coltrane who was 

3180
02:34:31,150 --> 02:34:35,430
probably maybe one of the greatest jazz 
artist who ever lived and he got hooked 

3181
02:34:35,430 --> 02:34:40,261
on heroin for awhile.
When people have this myth that that's 

3182
02:34:40,261 --> 02:34:43,231
what made coltrane so great was the 
drugs and the heroin and the coke and in

3183
02:34:43,391 --> 02:34:45,610
fact he,
he said it was the worst.

3184
02:34:45,611 --> 02:34:50,611
He did his worst work in that period and
he got off of it like in 58 and never 

3185
02:34:50,611 --> 02:34:52,960
touched the drugs or drinking after that
and did is better.

3186
02:34:52,961 --> 02:34:57,961
Workout is much better.
Work to create something requires so 

3187
02:34:57,961 --> 02:35:02,731
much discipline and so much mindfulness 
and focus that you just can't do it if 

3188
02:35:03,341 --> 02:35:05,430
you're constantly drugged out.
Yeah.

3189
02:35:05,431 --> 02:35:09,570
Especially those to those very 
depressive ones and very like.

3190
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:12,090
Coke and heroin are probably two of the 
worst,

3191
02:35:12,510 --> 02:35:16,680
but there seems to be a connection 
between heroin and deep soulful music.

3192
02:35:16,681 --> 02:35:19,700
Like maybe it helps them for a small 
time,

3193
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:25,160
reach a state,
but then ultimately the abuse of it 

3194
02:35:25,160 --> 02:35:26,670
destroys your body so much that you 
can't keep it up.

3195
02:35:26,840 --> 02:35:31,840
Yeah.
You mean like a velvet underground or 

3196
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:31,840
something like that?

3197
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:34,020
yeah,
like there's something will hendricks 

3198
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:35,290
and well people will argue dangerous 
wasn't really into heroin,

3199
02:35:35,291 --> 02:35:37,740
but if you look at that photo behind me 
of his mugshot,

3200
02:35:37,780 --> 02:35:42,780
that is from the fucking toronto police 
department when he was arrested for 

3201
02:35:42,780 --> 02:35:46,801
heroin,
so it was a little problem with that 

3202
02:35:46,801 --> 02:35:48,730
little heroin in his system.
I don't know what drugs.

3203
02:35:48,731 --> 02:35:53,731
I mean,
I know he was also involved in acid and 

3204
02:35:53,731 --> 02:35:53,731
You know,
morrison was into heroin.

3205
02:35:53,731 --> 02:35:56,290
There was a lot of alcohol involveD with
a lot of those guys as well.

3206
02:35:56,291 --> 02:36:01,291
But the ability to escape your 
inhibitions was they were chasing the 

3207
02:36:01,291 --> 02:36:01,630
dragon in a sense.
Yeah,

3208
02:36:01,631 --> 02:36:03,580
but look how long it lasts.
Twenty seven.

3209
02:36:04,590 --> 02:36:07,270
They're all died at 27.
Janice joplin,

3210
02:36:07,271 --> 02:36:08,490
hendrix,
morrison.

3211
02:36:08,620 --> 02:36:10,410
It seems to be the most dangerous

3212
02:36:10,480 --> 02:36:13,480
path to embark upon iF you're looking to
gain something.

3213
02:36:13,481 --> 02:36:18,481
I think one of the things I got from one
of your books was the story about 

3214
02:36:18,481 --> 02:36:21,561
theater or dusty was that in was that in
48 laws of power where it gets in the 33

3215
02:36:21,941 --> 02:36:24,100
strikes for add in the 40 lows.
Well,

3216
02:36:24,101 --> 02:36:26,560
basically after he would be successful 
with a book,

3217
02:36:26,561 --> 02:36:31,561
you would find that he was unable to 
really write and he didn't have that 

3218
02:36:31,561 --> 02:36:34,831
creative fire anymore to create another 
great work so he would take all of his 

3219
02:36:34,831 --> 02:36:39,721
life savings and go to the casino and 
just gamble it away in the night so that

3220
02:36:39,821 --> 02:36:42,760
he was desperate and hungry again.
He waS penniless,

3221
02:36:42,850 --> 02:36:47,850
penniless,
and at that point he had to write 

3222
02:36:47,850 --> 02:36:48,190
something great to get himself out.
You know,

3223
02:36:48,191 --> 02:36:53,191
so these,
these people use these different 

3224
02:36:53,191 --> 02:36:53,191
strategies and he did that over and over
again.

3225
02:36:53,191 --> 02:36:55,560
That takes guts.
You got to be a fucking crazy person.

3226
02:36:56,590 --> 02:36:59,560
That death ground,
putting yourself on death ground.

3227
02:36:59,561 --> 02:37:04,561
It comes from sun tzu says a general 
with deliberately put his army on death 

3228
02:37:04,561 --> 02:37:08,911
ground,
meaning he would deliberately put their 

3229
02:37:08,911 --> 02:37:10,621
back against an ocean or a mountain and 
they either had to defeat the enemy 

3230
02:37:10,751 --> 02:37:13,840
that's confronting them or they would 
die because they had no escape route,

3231
02:37:13,870 --> 02:37:15,620
no safety net,
no safety net,

3232
02:37:15,621 --> 02:37:16,130
no escape

3233
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:20,180
route safety nets or something that I've
argued against ever since I was a child,

3234
02:37:20,181 --> 02:37:25,181
which was another thing that my parents 
instilled in me that I had to have a 

3235
02:37:25,181 --> 02:37:25,370
safety net.
And I've always told everybody who would

3236
02:37:25,371 --> 02:37:30,371
listen,
don't ever have a fucking safety net 

3237
02:37:30,371 --> 02:37:31,430
because if you have a net you will fall.
You might not make it without the net,

3238
02:37:31,431 --> 02:37:36,010
but you will not make it within that.
So there's that.

3239
02:37:36,540 --> 02:37:37,170
There's that.

3240
02:37:37,630 --> 02:37:42,630
Uh,
I had an interesting experience with 

3241
02:37:42,630 --> 02:37:42,630
mastery,
uh,

3242
02:37:42,630 --> 02:37:46,300
were in writing the book where I've 
written four of the six chapters,

3243
02:37:46,510 --> 02:37:49,840
but I was getting really late in 
delivering the final result.

3244
02:37:50,080 --> 02:37:55,080
And the publisher basically said,
you have like 11 weeks to finish the 

3245
02:37:55,901 --> 02:37:58,030
book,
or we're canceling the project or,

3246
02:37:58,031 --> 02:38:00,880
or postponing it.
And they were,

3247
02:38:00,881 --> 02:38:03,040
the,
the two chapters left were the longest,

3248
02:38:03,041 --> 02:38:08,041
the hardest,
the most abstract and the most 

3249
02:38:08,041 --> 02:38:08,041
important.
And it was like,

3250
02:38:08,041 --> 02:38:09,850
there's no way I'm exhausted,
I just can't do it.

3251
02:38:10,390 --> 02:38:13,360
But I had no choice because if they 
cancel or postpone it,

3252
02:38:13,750 --> 02:38:16,450
all of my hard work would be thrown out 
the window.

3253
02:38:16,690 --> 02:38:18,940
So that was death ground.
And finally,

3254
02:38:18,941 --> 02:38:23,080
after three days of torturing myself and
whining and bitching at myself,

3255
02:38:23,560 --> 02:38:24,190
I decided,
all right,

3256
02:38:24,191 --> 02:38:25,770
I'm going to do it.
I'm just going to try.

3257
02:38:25,800 --> 02:38:26,980
Let's just do what I can.

3258
02:38:27,640 --> 02:38:31,150
And it was the most incredible writing 
experience I've ever had in my life.

3259
02:38:31,510 --> 02:38:36,510
I was,
I had to work harder than I've ever had 

3260
02:38:36,510 --> 02:38:38,911
to work.
I got on this high where thoughts were 

3261
02:38:38,911 --> 02:38:40,190
just coming to me and my dreams and my,
you know,

3262
02:38:40,200 --> 02:38:42,190
I'm having sex every.
It's just the most amazing.

3263
02:38:42,550 --> 02:38:47,550
And they worked.
And I was sitting there writing about 

3264
02:38:47,550 --> 02:38:50,020
creativity and intuition while they,
while this was happening to me.

3265
02:38:50,290 --> 02:38:55,290
And it just demonstrated to me that the 
limits that I thought I had are just 

3266
02:38:55,290 --> 02:38:59,971
sort of self imposed.
And if I stop complaining and stop 

3267
02:38:59,971 --> 02:39:03,931
saying that I had these limits,
I could explore beyond them and explore 

3268
02:39:03,931 --> 02:39:06,820
what I was capable of that I never 
thought I was capable of.

3269
02:39:07,450 --> 02:39:08,170
Prior to that.

3270
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:10,940
You know,
hunter thompson wrote hell's angels.

3271
02:39:10,970 --> 02:39:15,970
You finished the last x amount of 
chapters in like two days on cocaine?

3272
02:39:16,690 --> 02:39:18,890
Yeah.
Like you just got cooked up and fucking,

3273
02:39:19,050 --> 02:39:24,050
he like,
he had a deadline and maybe I should 

3274
02:39:24,050 --> 02:39:24,050
have tried that.
Have you ever seen.

3275
02:39:24,050 --> 02:39:26,840
I could have written it in two days.
Me being maybe need adderall.

3276
02:39:27,080 --> 02:39:28,630
Have you ever seen,
um,

3277
02:39:28,790 --> 02:39:30,980
the uh,
the hunter s thompson documentary.

3278
02:39:31,550 --> 02:39:32,990
Fear.
not fear and loathing.

3279
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:36,140
Fucking was it called what?
Yeah,

3280
02:39:36,141 --> 02:39:38,210
gonzo years ago.
Like what is it?

3281
02:39:38,211 --> 02:39:40,790
The life and times of a hunter?
S thompson is of the name of it.

3282
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,610
I got it saved on itunes.
I should just pull it up on itunes.

3283
02:39:44,310 --> 02:39:46,220
The documentary just from a couple of 
years ago.

3284
02:39:46,420 --> 02:39:47,910
Have you seen that a couple years ago?
No,

3285
02:39:47,911 --> 02:39:50,540
I have.
It is a fairly recent documentary,

3286
02:39:50,541 --> 02:39:51,860
but god damn,
it's good.

3287
02:39:52,290 --> 02:39:57,290
God damn.
It's good thing it's gone though the 

3288
02:39:57,290 --> 02:39:57,290
life and work of hunter s thompson.
Is that it?

3289
02:39:57,290 --> 02:40:00,971
Yeah.
I watched it in a hotel in seattle and 

3290
02:40:00,971 --> 02:40:00,971
fucking spent it.
That's it.

3291
02:40:00,971 --> 02:40:02,920
I'm liking the woRk of dr.
Hunter s thompson.

3292
02:40:02,921 --> 02:40:04,880
I'm so good.
It's so good.

3293
02:40:04,960 --> 02:40:08,120
A seven point eight kit.
That fucking blast me off there.

3294
02:40:08,150 --> 02:40:13,150
It's not a 10 that just shows you.
There's constant matter what you do in 

3295
02:40:13,150 --> 02:40:13,690
this life.
That's that documentary,

3296
02:40:13,710 --> 02:40:14,220
that Goddamn

3297
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:19,250
10 and incredibly inspirational and I 
watched it in seattle at a hotel room 

3298
02:40:19,250 --> 02:40:20,970
and just on a whim,
just larry will watch this.

3299
02:40:20,971 --> 02:40:23,280
I was alone.
I was doing some work and you know,

3300
02:40:23,281 --> 02:40:28,281
I,
I fucking wrote all night because of 

3301
02:40:28,281 --> 02:40:30,801
that documentary.
Got on the keyboard and just smashed 

3302
02:40:30,801 --> 02:40:30,801
keys all night.
Oh nice.

3303
02:40:30,801 --> 02:40:32,250
It's those things that,
you know,

3304
02:40:32,251 --> 02:40:37,251
you catch these bursts of inspiration 
and thompson who's a personal hero of 

3305
02:40:37,861 --> 02:40:39,630
mine,
used to call them fuel,

3306
02:40:40,190 --> 02:40:45,190
you know,
and he said that he personally believed 

3307
02:40:45,190 --> 02:40:47,211
that with the right song you could drive
further in your car and your car would 

3308
02:40:47,211 --> 02:40:52,011
figure out a way if the right song was 
playing to go to go miles past the and 

3309
02:40:52,920 --> 02:40:57,600
theoretically obviously not even 
theoretically he was a,

3310
02:40:58,140 --> 02:40:59,760
it was just a metaphor.
Metaphor.

3311
02:40:59,910 --> 02:41:00,450
Metaphor,
right.

3312
02:41:00,610 --> 02:41:01,590
Thank you.
Thank you.

3313
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:03,850
Metaphorically he was,
you know,

3314
02:41:04,050 --> 02:41:09,050
just great at figuring out how to put 
these abstract ideas into a tangible 

3315
02:41:09,811 --> 02:41:14,400
form that you mind accepted and never 
met a deadline.

3316
02:41:14,850 --> 02:41:18,360
And his whOle thing was like putting 
things off until the last minute.

3317
02:41:18,540 --> 02:41:22,410
And then this fury of fucking teeth 
gnashing,

3318
02:41:22,950 --> 02:41:25,470
slamming against the keys and this 
fucking.

3319
02:41:25,650 --> 02:41:28,070
But it's almost like he forced himself 
into this,

3320
02:41:28,580 --> 02:41:31,500
this back against the wall.
What would you call it?

3321
02:41:31,530 --> 02:41:35,070
The death ground.
He forced himself into a death ground.

3322
02:41:35,320 --> 02:41:36,570
Well,
in order to complete.

3323
02:41:36,571 --> 02:41:38,410
I wish I'd done that.
I would've included it among you.

3324
02:41:38,411 --> 02:41:39,470
Do so.
You know,

3325
02:41:39,550 --> 02:41:44,550
I've know you've talking about comedy,
you like following someone like joey 

3326
02:41:44,550 --> 02:41:46,120
diaz who is hilarious,
right?

3327
02:41:46,121 --> 02:41:48,280
Because you've talked about how that 
makes,

3328
02:41:48,450 --> 02:41:51,070
you know,
that would make some people a little bit

3329
02:41:51,071 --> 02:41:56,071
scared and a little bit nervous,
but you like it because it's going to 

3330
02:41:56,071 --> 02:41:57,220
bring out your best following somebody.
That's that great.

3331
02:41:57,670 --> 02:42:02,670
You know what I mean?
Haven't you kind of mentioned isn't 

3332
02:42:02,670 --> 02:42:02,670
there something there in that same 
philosophy?

3333
02:42:02,670 --> 02:42:07,630
Maybe,
but my philosophy in that is that I 

3334
02:42:07,630 --> 02:42:10,190
think that not foe,
not working with funny really,

3335
02:42:10,191 --> 02:42:12,830
really funny people is a twofold 
problem.

3336
02:42:12,831 --> 02:42:17,831
One,
it's famine thinking like they think 

3337
02:42:17,831 --> 02:42:20,111
that there's,
there's a lot of really selfish 

3338
02:42:20,111 --> 02:42:21,620
comedians out there and one of the 
things that they like to do is they like

3339
02:42:21,621 --> 02:42:25,370
to stack the deck so they'll bring this 
guys had a national touring headliners.

3340
02:42:25,371 --> 02:42:30,371
They bring the worst fucking comedians 
you've ever seen in your life to open 

3341
02:42:30,371 --> 02:42:33,911
for them because these guys go up there 
and eat dick for half an hour and then 

3342
02:42:33,911 --> 02:42:34,610
you go on stage.
The crowd has been tortured,

3343
02:42:34,611 --> 02:42:36,950
waiting for actual entertainment and 
you're the hero.

3344
02:42:37,010 --> 02:42:39,320
You're the conquering hero.
So nobody out shines you this,

3345
02:42:39,321 --> 02:42:42,440
but it is incredibly common and I think 
it's gross.

3346
02:42:42,770 --> 02:42:44,990
I think a disrespect to the audience,
first of all,

3347
02:42:45,020 --> 02:42:48,020
I think it disrespects the fact that 
these people have paid money to see you.

3348
02:42:48,260 --> 02:42:53,260
They deserve entertainment,
not just from you but from other people 

3349
02:42:53,260 --> 02:42:56,111
as well.
And you shouldn't be scared of other 

3350
02:42:56,111 --> 02:42:59,711
people being funny.
It doesn't take away from you being 

3351
02:42:59,711 --> 02:43:02,051
funny.
The only way it would take away is if 

3352
02:43:02,051 --> 02:43:03,200
the person on before you is stealing 
your material or what it's called,

3353
02:43:03,201 --> 02:43:08,201
stepping on your material.
Like say if you know you had a very 

3354
02:43:08,201 --> 02:43:08,201
particular subject that you were famous 
for.

3355
02:43:08,201 --> 02:43:10,220
Like jim gaffigan likes.
Talk about hot pockets.

3356
02:43:10,221 --> 02:43:12,160
He does this whole hot pocket bits.
Really hilarious.

3357
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:14,730
If you went on before I even started 
talking about hot pockets,

3358
02:43:14,740 --> 02:43:19,740
you would kind of step on his bit.
You know you would and people will do 

3359
02:43:19,740 --> 02:43:20,680
that.
The same shit heads like that actor that

3360
02:43:20,681 --> 02:43:25,681
I told you that we'd like to go up to my
friend and say it was fat right before 

3361
02:43:25,681 --> 02:43:25,681
he would go and read his lines.

3362
02:43:26,020 --> 02:43:31,020
That's that same sort of thinking,
that same sort of famine thinking you 

3363
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:33,220
like another person.
Success should be inspirational to you.

3364
02:43:33,250 --> 02:43:37,390
It shouldn't be detrimental to you.
And so I.

3365
02:43:37,391 --> 02:43:40,540
Um,
and then the other thing is I'm a fan of

3366
02:43:40,541 --> 02:43:42,040
comedy.
I want to laugh.

3367
02:43:42,130 --> 02:43:47,130
So I bring joey diaz who I personally 
think is the funniest guy who's ever 

3368
02:43:47,130 --> 02:43:50,131
lived.
I bring him to open for me because I 

3369
02:43:50,131 --> 02:43:51,220
want to be.
I want to be in a hilarious state before

3370
02:43:51,221 --> 02:43:52,660
I go onstage.
I want to be laughing.

3371
02:43:52,661 --> 02:43:57,130
I'm not worried about not being funny 
because if I've done my job,

3372
02:43:57,820 --> 02:43:59,740
I've done the work,
it's going to be good.

3373
02:43:59,770 --> 02:44:02,260
Like don't worry,
you can't worry about that.

3374
02:44:02,261 --> 02:44:05,050
That worrying is the enemy of comedy 
here.

3375
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:06,030
Yeah.
It's just,

3376
02:44:06,040 --> 02:44:11,040
it's pathetic.
I bring murderers with main man 

3377
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:11,040
everywhere I go,
duncan,

3378
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:11,620
ari,
jo.

3379
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:14,920
I just bring the biggest killers that I 
could find.

3380
02:44:14,990 --> 02:44:19,990
I take headliners at me.
I've taken greg fitzsimmons on the road 

3381
02:44:19,990 --> 02:44:19,990
with me.
I mean,

3382
02:44:19,990 --> 02:44:21,730
I like doing shows with guys who were 
fucking awesome.

3383
02:44:21,731 --> 02:44:23,680
I think it's reaLly important.
It's,

3384
02:44:24,040 --> 02:44:28,840
but it's not because I want to die 
something because we want to put my back

3385
02:44:28,841 --> 02:44:31,570
up against the wall.
I want the audience to get their money's

3386
02:44:31,571 --> 02:44:35,200
worth and I want to be around my friends
and I also want to support my friends.

3387
02:44:35,830 --> 02:44:40,830
Part of the reason to bring in joey and 
ari and duncan on the road with me all 

3388
02:44:40,830 --> 02:44:43,951
these years is it's selfish because I 
want to have a good time and I want to 

3389
02:44:43,951 --> 02:44:45,100
be with them and I want to enjoy myself.
So there's that.

3390
02:44:45,250 --> 02:44:50,250
But also I want people to know how good 
these guys are and a lot of these guys 

3391
02:44:50,250 --> 02:44:51,100
are good in a really fucked up way.

3392
02:44:51,100 --> 02:44:56,100
That's not it.
It's not really palatable for comedy 

3393
02:44:56,100 --> 02:44:58,150
central.
It's really hard for them to get on hbo.

3394
02:44:58,360 --> 02:44:59,890
You know,
for a guy like joey diaz,

3395
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:02,350
the only way for that guy to get famous 
as the internet.

3396
02:45:02,530 --> 02:45:05,170
That's what made him famous and my help,
you know,

3397
02:45:05,171 --> 02:45:10,171
helping get him out there in front of 
thousands of people that would never 

3398
02:45:10,171 --> 02:45:13,591
have had an opportunity to see him and 
telling people as I introduced him 

3399
02:45:14,080 --> 02:45:14,720
basin.
Gentlemen,

3400
02:45:14,730 --> 02:45:17,290
please welcome the funniest motherfucker
that ever stepped foot on earth,

3401
02:45:17,470 --> 02:45:20,380
joey diaz and I would bring on stage 
like that all the time.

3402
02:45:20,980 --> 02:45:24,160
I tell everybody is funnier than me.
He's the funniest guy ever.

3403
02:45:24,620 --> 02:45:26,110
Doesn't mean I'm not funny.
You know,

3404
02:45:26,111 --> 02:45:31,111
it's just,
it's not bad for things to be great 

3405
02:45:31,111 --> 02:45:31,111
other than you.
It's good.

3406
02:45:31,111 --> 02:45:32,800
There's this.
You should be inspired.

3407
02:45:32,910 --> 02:45:37,070
The greatest people want those people 
who are great alongside them to push us.

3408
02:45:37,560 --> 02:45:41,070
Although bird and magic were nemeses,
you know,

3409
02:45:41,140 --> 02:45:46,140
you talked to him now how thankful they 
were that they had each other on 

3410
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:46,140
opposing teams.
Oh,

3411
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:47,950
for sure.
Which are all of these.

3412
02:45:47,951 --> 02:45:50,170
All of these people you know,
you need greatness around you.

3413
02:45:50,500 --> 02:45:53,260
You need them.
You need going to get to have yang.

3414
02:45:53,290 --> 02:45:55,570
You need which one's good,
which one's negative,

3415
02:45:55,571 --> 02:45:58,000
and which ones pumping.
This once again is passive.

3416
02:45:58,001 --> 02:45:59,560
Gang is active,
man.

3417
02:45:59,590 --> 02:46:01,490
You need that yang to have.
Again.

3418
02:46:02,960 --> 02:46:03,950
You need both.
Yeah,

3419
02:46:04,060 --> 02:46:06,040
it makes yang.
The university has,

3420
02:46:06,100 --> 02:46:07,900
you know,
the tide comes in and goes out.

3421
02:46:07,901 --> 02:46:09,070
Bill o'reilly,
you know,

3422
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:09,580
it's,
it's,

3423
02:46:09,680 --> 02:46:10,390
there's something.

3424
02:46:10,760 --> 02:46:13,430
don't talk to me about bill o'reilly is 
not the greatest fucking.

3425
02:46:13,540 --> 02:46:14,050
Okay.
Carrie,

3426
02:46:14,051 --> 02:46:15,300
you can't.
You can't explain it yet.

3427
02:46:15,301 --> 02:46:16,790
She can't you fuck.
It's called gravity.

3428
02:46:16,791 --> 02:46:19,160
They figured out a long time ago.
Shit you've ever seen.

3429
02:46:19,161 --> 02:46:24,161
That thing that he did where he's 
talking about god talking about the tie 

3430
02:46:24,161 --> 02:46:24,161
goes in.
The tide goes out.

3431
02:46:24,161 --> 02:46:26,390
You can't explain it like,
you know I'm going with god.

3432
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:30,200
It was the so disingenuous from a 
harvard graduate.

3433
02:46:30,201 --> 02:46:30,420
He said,
yeah,

3434
02:46:30,420 --> 02:46:30,420
to

3435
02:46:30,500 --> 02:46:34,490
fucking have.
I have my own bill riley's story.

3436
02:46:34,820 --> 02:46:36,430
Please tell it to me.
Well,

3437
02:46:36,450 --> 02:46:40,490
48 laws of power just come out in 
[inaudible] 98 and bill o'reilly decides

3438
02:46:40,491 --> 02:46:43,640
to have me on the if o'reilly factor,
which was big then,

3439
02:46:43,641 --> 02:46:47,070
but not as big as it became later on.
And so I'm like,

3440
02:46:47,230 --> 02:46:49,610
this is like one of my first shows I've 
ever been on you.

3441
02:46:49,611 --> 02:46:50,120
No,
no,

3442
02:46:50,150 --> 02:46:50,960
no,
no.

3443
02:46:53,090 --> 02:46:54,770
Nothing like this ever happened to me 
before.

3444
02:46:54,980 --> 02:46:59,980
And basically you go to a studio in los 
angeles where he's in New York and 

3445
02:47:01,250 --> 02:47:04,490
you're in this room and there's nothing 
around you,

3446
02:47:04,491 --> 02:47:08,150
and they put an earphone in your head 
and you're staring at a camera.

3447
02:47:08,270 --> 02:47:13,270
You don't see anything.
You just hear bill o'reilly's stupid 

3448
02:47:13,270 --> 02:47:13,520
fucking voice in your ear asking you 
questions.

3449
02:47:13,670 --> 02:47:16,160
It's like you're on drugs and it's so 
disconcerting.

3450
02:47:16,310 --> 02:47:21,310
It's like the guy who's trying to put 
you off your game before and you're 

3451
02:47:21,310 --> 02:47:21,470
already put off your game the moment you
start.

3452
02:47:21,620 --> 02:47:26,620
Anyway,
he interviews me and I prepared like 

3453
02:47:26,620 --> 02:47:26,620
shit for this interview because I knew 
the questions coming.

3454
02:47:26,690 --> 02:47:31,690
It was all about monica lewinsky and 
clinton and the scandal and the 48 laws 

3455
02:47:31,690 --> 02:47:33,830
and I nailed it.
And he said,

3456
02:47:33,980 --> 02:47:35,030
oh,
that was a great interview,

3457
02:47:35,031 --> 02:47:36,320
robert.
I'm going to have you on again.

3458
02:47:37,150 --> 02:47:37,970
Okay,
wow.

3459
02:47:38,030 --> 02:47:40,610
And so I'm feeling pretty good about 
myself.

3460
02:47:40,640 --> 02:47:44,570
So four weeks later I trudged back to 
that office and I sit in that same chair

3461
02:47:44,571 --> 02:47:49,571
with the little earphone in my head and 
he proceeds to just rip me to shreds 

3462
02:47:49,790 --> 02:47:52,120
about what a.
Well,

3463
02:47:52,130 --> 02:47:54,920
essentially he hated the 48 laws of 
power,

3464
02:47:54,921 --> 02:47:59,120
he liked the writing or whatever,
but he was just using his game.

3465
02:47:59,420 --> 02:48:04,420
He was completely,
he was just using it as a way to attack 

3466
02:48:04,420 --> 02:48:07,070
clinton,
which I wasn't wanting to do that.

3467
02:48:07,220 --> 02:48:08,750
So anyway,
sorry.

3468
02:48:08,751 --> 02:48:12,980
He was just like totally messing with me
and I was so expecting the opposite that

3469
02:48:12,981 --> 02:48:14,150
I was like woo.

3470
02:48:14,420 --> 02:48:15,870
And then he goes,
uh,

3471
02:48:16,110 --> 02:48:17,090
and then he says,
well,

3472
02:48:17,630 --> 02:48:20,390
what about this law about use selective 
honesty?

3473
02:48:20,391 --> 02:48:20,930
And I said,
weLl,

3474
02:48:20,931 --> 02:48:24,170
it's something that politicians and 
business people use all the time.

3475
02:48:24,171 --> 02:48:29,171
Like lyndon johnson for instance.
And then I was about to explain how 

3476
02:48:29,171 --> 02:48:29,330
lyndon johnson,
he cuts me off.

3477
02:48:29,331 --> 02:48:30,260
Yes,
yes.

3478
02:48:30,261 --> 02:48:35,261
The same man who said 58,000
men of our young men to death in 

3479
02:48:35,261 --> 02:48:36,110
Vietnam,
let's break for a commercial.

3480
02:48:36,650 --> 02:48:41,480
And that was the end of the interview.
So he like made me look like a.

3481
02:48:41,481 --> 02:48:46,190
I was supporting lyndon johnson,
massacring 58,000

3482
02:48:46,191 --> 02:48:51,191
americans in Vietnam.
He manipulated me and humiliated me and 

3483
02:48:51,191 --> 02:48:53,500
like,
and um,

3484
02:48:53,990 --> 02:48:58,990
the whole thing was he hates the 48 laws
of power because it's all about 

3485
02:48:58,990 --> 02:49:02,921
manipulation and ugliness and he's the 
most fucking manipulative interview you 

3486
02:49:02,921 --> 02:49:05,210
could ever imagine.
Look how he manipulated me,

3487
02:49:05,350 --> 02:49:08,040
be completely set me up by making me

3488
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:11,700
think this was going to be like a 
softball interview where we were just,

3489
02:49:11,730 --> 02:49:12,360
you know,
well,

3490
02:49:12,361 --> 02:49:17,361
he's a hater.
He just hated that someone else wrote 

3491
02:49:17,361 --> 02:49:17,361
something brilliant.
That's all it is.

3492
02:49:17,361 --> 02:49:17,810
That guys a fucking hater.
He's,

3493
02:49:17,850 --> 02:49:20,740
he's the ultimate hater.
And it was a,

3494
02:49:20,750 --> 02:49:24,990
it was a special type of looking glass 
that allowed people to see bill o'reilly

3495
02:49:24,991 --> 02:49:26,760
for the fucking monster that he was.
Yeah.

3496
02:49:26,761 --> 02:49:31,761
And I find it just the book incredibly 
ridiculous that that guy got to 

3497
02:49:31,761 --> 02:49:32,010
interview a obama,
you know,

3498
02:49:32,011 --> 02:49:37,011
not that I think obama's particularly 
unique and special human being 

3499
02:49:37,140 --> 02:49:42,140
relatively to what his position is and 
what could have been done by a guy like 

3500
02:49:42,140 --> 02:49:43,110
that in that position.
But I think that,

3501
02:49:43,360 --> 02:49:48,360
you know,
having an obama being interviewed by 

3502
02:49:48,360 --> 02:49:49,170
this fucking buffoon,
I think obama has the most thankless job

3503
02:49:49,171 --> 02:49:52,620
probably in the history of the world and
maybe the most impossible job.

3504
02:49:52,920 --> 02:49:55,260
I don't think he's done the best that he
could with it,

3505
02:49:55,261 --> 02:49:58,050
but I don't think anybody can.
I think you're set up.

3506
02:49:58,350 --> 02:50:01,560
That's what I've come to.
The more I think about being a president

3507
02:50:01,561 --> 02:50:06,561
and more think about dealing with the 
house and dealing with congress and the 

3508
02:50:06,561 --> 02:50:10,221
senate and all the fucking laws and just
just look at what's happened to his 

3509
02:50:10,221 --> 02:50:11,280
hair.
The gray.

3510
02:50:11,340 --> 02:50:13,080
Yeah.
Well that happens all the and gray.

3511
02:50:13,081 --> 02:50:14,610
But like in this course,
it's like a year.

3512
02:50:14,611 --> 02:50:19,611
It just suddenly turned gray.
I don't think we can even imagine the 

3513
02:50:19,611 --> 02:50:22,311
kind of pressure that you'd have to be 
to be the leader or the supposedly 

3514
02:50:22,311 --> 02:50:23,700
commander in chief of the greatest 
superpower of the world has ever known,

3515
02:50:23,701 --> 02:50:25,920
which wants to consume the earth.
You know,

3516
02:50:25,930 --> 02:50:29,310
this crazy super power that literally 
thrives on consuming the earth.

3517
02:50:29,610 --> 02:50:34,350
I think we can gain so much from 
listening to eisenhower speech about the

3518
02:50:34,351 --> 02:50:36,600
military industrial complex when he was 
leaving office,

3519
02:50:36,720 --> 02:50:41,720
that intense speech warning the people 
about the military industrial complex 

3520
02:50:42,210 --> 02:50:44,340
and the dangers of it and the influence 
of it.

3521
02:50:44,340 --> 02:50:49,340
I don't think we could even imagine what
that is actually like when you're in 

3522
02:50:49,340 --> 02:50:49,530
office.
I mean,

3523
02:50:50,360 --> 02:50:55,360
I'd like to think that obama,
one day we'll write a book explaining 

3524
02:50:55,360 --> 02:50:55,620
everything and we'll be like,
oh,

3525
02:50:55,621 --> 02:51:00,621
I get it because I don't get it.
I don't get how he could have made the 

3526
02:51:00,621 --> 02:51:02,790
decisions that he's made based on what 
he said before he got into office,

3527
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:08,000
unless he's totally full of shit,
which I'd like to think that he's not 

3528
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,720
that set him getting interviewed by a 
fucking buffoon like bill riley.

3529
02:51:10,721 --> 02:51:15,721
It's just like it's watching that and 
just that he's one of the most popular 

3530
02:51:16,681 --> 02:51:18,480
people,
but it's so silly.

3531
02:51:18,481 --> 02:51:21,210
It's so silly that he's one of the most 
popular people on television.

3532
02:51:21,211 --> 02:51:23,250
It's so fucking silly.
It's just,

3533
02:51:23,310 --> 02:51:25,440
it's just you'll get no argument from 
me.

3534
02:51:25,910 --> 02:51:27,060
Well,
it's,

3535
02:51:27,150 --> 02:51:32,150
it's unnecessary and I think I 
personally believe that that style of 

3536
02:51:32,150 --> 02:51:35,721
television is like fucking silent films 
where you debate a very important issue 

3537
02:51:36,660 --> 02:51:39,800
on a split screen for six minutes and 
you know,

3538
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:41,330
people yell over yell,
yeah,

3539
02:51:41,340 --> 02:51:42,900
well bill,
that's not the case.

3540
02:51:42,901 --> 02:51:45,630
And rambam fracking doesn't produce any 
negative results.

3541
02:51:47,360 --> 02:51:48,600
We'll be right back.
No,

3542
02:51:48,601 --> 02:51:50,760
we won't be right back.
This is not the way to talk.

3543
02:51:50,850 --> 02:51:52,660
This is not the way to address complex 
issues.

3544
02:51:52,661 --> 02:51:54,900
It's just not the way to have 
interesting discussions.

3545
02:51:54,901 --> 02:51:57,930
Did you ever see John Stewart on the 
firing line years ago?

3546
02:51:57,990 --> 02:51:59,910
We almost five minutes.
Yeah.

3547
02:52:02,210 --> 02:52:04,920
I was supposeD to pimp something that I 
forgot to.

3548
02:52:05,470 --> 02:52:07,350
What he supposed to been,
um,

3549
02:52:08,050 --> 02:52:10,360
some special offers for getting the book
mastery.

3550
02:52:10,670 --> 02:52:11,300
Yeah,
that's right.

3551
02:52:11,320 --> 02:52:12,790
Didn't somebody emailing that or 
something like that?

3552
02:52:12,850 --> 02:52:14,350
Is it too late to do now?
No,

3553
02:52:14,351 --> 02:52:19,351
not at all.
Now we've probably lost everybody by 

3554
02:52:19,351 --> 02:52:19,351
now.
Everybody's still here.

3555
02:52:19,351 --> 02:52:21,040
If people still about still in,
you'd be amazed.

3556
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:26,120
These people sticking into the end,
most of the people listening to this or 

3557
02:52:26,120 --> 02:52:29,260
commuting or they're on the treadmill or
on a plane or something like that,

3558
02:52:29,590 --> 02:52:34,120
but a huge majority of them are,
are hanging out to the very end.

3559
02:52:34,150 --> 02:52:37,170
You'd be completely and it's like 
archived.

3560
02:52:37,171 --> 02:52:37,980
And they listen.
Oh yeah,

3561
02:52:37,981 --> 02:52:38,310
yeah,
yeah,

3562
02:52:38,311 --> 02:52:43,311
yeah.
For this will reach fucking probably 

3563
02:52:43,311 --> 02:52:46,171
close to them,
but we have all sorts of offers for the 

3564
02:52:46,171 --> 02:52:48,361
book and for special bonus things that I
used to give away when the book first 

3565
02:52:48,361 --> 02:52:52,231
came out and you need to go to power 
seduction and wore the and is spelled 

3566
02:52:53,051 --> 02:52:58,051
out power reduction in war.com/joe.

3567
02:52:58,360 --> 02:52:59,620
Yes,
I got it right here.

3568
02:52:59,990 --> 02:53:03,370
Um,
I'll put this up on twitter right now.

3569
02:53:03,610 --> 02:53:07,810
A copy link address and what is the 
special offer that people get?

3570
02:53:08,500 --> 02:53:13,500
Um,
there's some things that are not 

3571
02:53:13,500 --> 02:53:16,831
included in the actual book itself.
So the full intervieWs that I had with 

3572
02:53:16,831 --> 02:53:19,330
some of the contemporary masters like 
freddie roach,

3573
02:53:19,900 --> 02:53:23,170
uh,
some material that never got included in

3574
02:53:23,171 --> 02:53:25,900
the book for reasons that don't have 
anything to do with the quality of it.

3575
02:53:26,610 --> 02:53:29,380
um,
and then this kind of essay that I wrote

3576
02:53:29,410 --> 02:53:34,410
about the writing of the book itself and
things that I explained today about my 

3577
02:53:34,410 --> 02:53:36,730
deadline and how would you explain it?
a tweet to give it to people.

3578
02:53:37,180 --> 02:53:38,650
Like,
I'm writing a tweet right now.

3579
02:53:38,680 --> 02:53:40,150
How would you explain it?
Explain what,

3580
02:53:40,180 --> 02:53:43,750
explain what this offer is.
What is like free.

3581
02:53:43,780 --> 02:53:48,490
You're getting free bonus material 
that's not in the book itself.

3582
02:53:48,960 --> 02:53:53,960
Okay.
He really gives insight into some of 

3583
02:53:53,960 --> 02:53:54,750
robert's process because I've looked at 
some of these,

3584
02:53:54,751 --> 02:53:59,751
gives insight into his process,
how he did this plus bonus content and 

3585
02:53:59,751 --> 02:54:02,460
stories that almost didn't make the cut.
Kind of like the director's cut.

3586
02:54:02,580 --> 02:54:04,860
Thank you.
It just got out to one point,

3587
02:54:04,861 --> 02:54:06,540
two,
8 million people.

3588
02:54:07,240 --> 02:54:09,380
For those of you thinking about more 
than five,

3589
02:54:09,420 --> 02:54:11,130
for those of you thinking about reading 
mastery,

3590
02:54:11,131 --> 02:54:14,910
I've read it and it's been an invaluable
tool along with the rest of your books.

3591
02:54:15,140 --> 02:54:16,260
I'm really,
you know,

3592
02:54:16,261 --> 02:54:20,490
you allow people to get the best out of 
themselves and that's something that I'm

3593
02:54:20,491 --> 02:54:25,491
incredibly passionate about and I think 
these are incredible tools to have and 

3594
02:54:25,491 --> 02:54:28,020
you decide what to do with these tools.
You're a unique individual,

3595
02:54:28,140 --> 02:54:33,140
but there's no doubt that knowledge is 
power in itself and you can use that.

3596
02:54:33,271 --> 02:54:35,730
Power for however,
however means you want to do it.

3597
02:54:35,940 --> 02:54:40,940
It's up to you,
but the books have knowledge and when 

3598
02:54:40,940 --> 02:54:44,271
you consume those books,
that knowledge will translate into your 

3599
02:54:44,271 --> 02:54:44,271
own personal power cliches.

3600
02:54:45,080 --> 02:54:47,510
Ladies and gentlemen,
Robert Green,

3601
02:54:47,511 --> 02:54:48,890
you're a bad motherfucker.
Aubrey.
