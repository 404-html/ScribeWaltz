1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,290
Hello Freak bitches ragdoll pull up.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:04,950
Poor,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,420
poor Mark Hunt fucking,

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,070
but mark has never been
the kind of grappling.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,360
Steve Bay is way better at defending tape.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,251
Oh No,

7
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:12,130
I think Steve Bay beach.

8
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:12,910
You know what?

9
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,310
If he punches steep in the face,

10
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:17,520
it's going to get more steam out
of his fucking he is and like not

11
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,680
coming back my last name that because
he's not going to come back and fight for

12
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:23,820
a world title right away.

13
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,220
I think it'd be all.

14
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,330
That was the biggest
embarrassed for the floor.

15
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,740
That would be a crazy for the biggest
fucking embarrassment of the year that you

16
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:32,850
would that be embarrassment.

17
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:33,684
But it was embarrassing.

18
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,720
But just come back with saying it.

19
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:35,580
We've got smart con.

20
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,260
They knew he was on the juice.

21
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,180
He went in there loaded to the gills.

22
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,430
It was just an imbalance.

23
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,390
Joe.

24
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,330
It was an embarrassing thing for everybody
and mark contact every fucking right

25
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:46,050
to be mad.

26
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,500
They put him in there with a guy
that's coming off rocket fucking fuel.

27
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,390
That dude don't just only deep ball.

28
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,890
What is the size of his fucking head?

29
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,420
He's taking shit that makes
you a fucking head grow.

30
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,410
Gets a fucking pit bulls.

31
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,270
I hope they put them against my yo check.

32
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,270
I will fly to fucking clean back gum.

33
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,640
It's climate con climate.

34
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,720
I found the snot in my nose.

35
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:07,620
It was bigger than this gum,

36
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,510
the Ed that I take the
gum out to eat it anyway.

37
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,110
Oh it was so long.

38
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:13,944
It was like a cookbook.

39
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,340
I got a flashback from the
hell that motherfucker.

40
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:18,174
Anyway,

41
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,543
cause I love him.

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,151
I love him.

43
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:22,650
From time to time I have a little pimple

44
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:29,370
and it just comes out like a stream and
it's got like a little clamp on board

45
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:31,470
with you with all this Steve Shit.

46
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,750
From time to time.

47
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,830
Oh when you eat,

48
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:36,110
when you do coke for 30 years,

49
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:36,631
it's a habit.

50
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:38,040
You'll wake up in the
morning and pick one out.

51
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,320
It's like a fucking candy cane with code.

52
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,410
You inhale that motherfucker.

53
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,800
It's like going to the dentist for free.

54
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,160
I will throw up on this fucking table.

55
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,703
I feel like

56
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,420
that's to be honest with ourselves.

57
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,620
We're all friends here.

58
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:54,930
That was the most embarrassing
fucking thing I ever seen.

59
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,500
I agree.

60
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,590
They knew he was on it and they
put that fucking animal in there.

61
00:01:58,591 --> 00:01:59,310
Okay.

62
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,971
And you know what,

63
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:00,690
man?

64
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,290
Go ahead.

65
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,460
Keep doing those steroids.

66
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:03,430
Put them a Nigga and Spiel,

67
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:04,264
but whatever.

68
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,990
I love that Cleveland motherfucker.

69
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,040
Dude just got killed.

70
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,700
He killed him.

71
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,730
He'll fucking kill him.

72
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:14,350
And General Stevia think they would
ever be able to have him come off a

73
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:15,810
suspension and fight for the title.

74
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,010
That's not how it goes.

75
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,120
Oh,

76
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,370
$4 billion though.

77
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:22,350
Even scab off and Iranians head right now.

78
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,381
Right now.

79
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:26,420
They're fucking Shit Nigga though.

80
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:27,241
And we lost Ron.

81
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:28,430
Take the gum out of your mouth.

82
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,940
They lost Rhonda.

83
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,110
And the only other thing,

84
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:36,150
we got his fucking condom
and he's having a baby.

85
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,620
He don't want to fucking come back now.

86
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:39,390
You know what he's talking about.

87
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:40,224
He might come back,

88
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,870
but they don't want to give
him who he supposed to fight.

89
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,200
Who is he supposed to be supposed to
fight that silicon collar beep and happy

90
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,270
and have stories.

91
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,050
One of the let's do it.

92
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,190
Let's set it up.

93
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,701
No,

94
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:54,534
that's not

95
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,623
the shit.

96
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,950
You don't need to find out though.

97
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,460
He don't need to fight nobody.

98
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:01,271
He's number one,

99
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:01,660
right?

100
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,160
Or is this your boy number one?

101
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,570
It Tony Khabib's number.

102
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,080
Okay.

103
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,660
Then that's the fight NF.

104
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,570
However,

105
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,630
I will say had it not
been for the fat shaming,

106
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,950
I wouldn't have lost.

107
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,170
I'm going to guess I've
probably lost 30 pounds.

108
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,880
You do definitely look
better and feel better,

109
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:16,150
right?

110
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,620
Dude,

111
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:16,940
wait,

112
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,340
am I take off these lower layers?

113
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:20,980
I look so I feel so much better.

114
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,180
I feel I do.

115
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,240
I jogged eight miles today.

116
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,440
Like I just like,

117
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:29,730
that wasn't happening when I was two
50 some Thanksgiving outside or I don't

118
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,240
want my treadmill that
everything's on my treadmill.

119
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,060
I get in and do I watch
one of those rock rocks,

120
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:35,920
workout videos and get inspired?

121
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,150
The rock dude,

122
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,160
his workout videos are fucking awesome.

123
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:40,150
Do you not follow them on Instagram?

124
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:41,800
He's the best dude when he hit me up.

125
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:42,311
Do you,

126
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:44,350
does anyone remember this day in my life

127
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,960
I post,

128
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,280
I work out in the rock shirt.

129
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:49,360
I always have the rock shirt on,

130
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,440
which was the bull.

131
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:50,711
No,

132
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,760
it's the under Armour shirt.

133
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,061
Oh No,

134
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:52,631
they're not out yet.

135
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:53,200
They're coming out soon.

136
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,770
I'm getting all of the,

137
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,603
oh Geez.

138
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,620
I have a man crush on the rock.

139
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,670
He's also in a part of this thing
is finding inspiration and workout.

140
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,960
That credence Clearwater thing.

141
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,943
That's real.

142
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,491
That's what I do.

143
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:05,800
I play that to crank and then you
get on the thing and you're like,

144
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:06,191
fuck it.

145
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,024
Let's just start running.

146
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,460
Let them midnights past
show shine a lot on me.

147
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:12,371
What was it?

148
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,210
Kind of just the rock he,

149
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:13,900
anyway,

150
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,090
I would wear a shirt and I would,

151
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,670
it would,

152
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,480
I would do videos for the rock to
see and in the process I'd work out.

153
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,380
I'd work out because I'd want the rock cm.

154
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,560
Then he saw one and he was like,

155
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,330
I've made a video where I made a line.

156
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,130
I was like,

157
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,963
you know,

158
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,851
that's fine.

159
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,684
As I go,

160
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,400
I today I'm doing two a days.

161
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,290
For those of you who didn't
play football in high school,

162
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:32,830
two days,

163
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,570
for those of you who didn't
get pussy back in high school,

164
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,301
two days of what?

165
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:39,310
As bad as it did to put hair on our
balls and they loved it and he goes,

166
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:39,661
that too.

167
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:41,620
It is line had me Roland and then he goes,

168
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:42,454
