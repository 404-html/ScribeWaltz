1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,750
Oh Shit,
we're live beatboxing.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:09,790
Brian Cowen shows another hidden skill 
and this last weekend we just learned he

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:15,051
speaks fluent gay rapist.
French said play when I'm in the hardest

4
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:20,841
things I ever laughed at.
Is You doing your French rapist 

5
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:20,841
character?
Yeah,

6
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:23,970
I'm talking to Steven about.
Explained to him how to.

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,240
I'm assuming you were saying tightened 
up his ass because you are going to come

8
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:28,850
inside of it something.
You're doing it all.

9
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,280
Did it all in perfectly.
Enunciated French.

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,750
That's right.
I think he shocked him.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,010
I think he did.
He was crying.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,040
He was laughing so hard.
He was actually the does the camera guy 

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,120
who the camera guys who are pros.
These guys are Goddamn pros.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,650
They.
They keep it together.

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,310
The guy gave in and was laughing out 
loud while holding the camera,

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,360
like he couldn't help it.
We were all crying and also he knew this

17
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:53,300
was never gonna.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,120
Get on the fucking sportsmans channel.
It's not going to get on channel,

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,950
but I wish they would release it on the 
web.

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,210
The ravine comer.
Why don't we have the we there?

21
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:08,211
The footage is there.
I think there's some concern that the 

22
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:11,901
hunt and folk would abandon us all 
because French rapists folk don't like 

23
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:16,890
these Goddamn comedians coming in and 
gang up are fine.

24
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:20,340
American pastime,
hunting folk,

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,840
some of the hunting folk look,
most hunting people are like most 

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,500
people,
most people are cool as fuck.

27
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,990
I maintain this.
I really do believe this.

28
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,430
I believe that most people are great.
It is a very small percentage of people.

29
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,130
It took me a long ass time to figure 
this out.

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Just the sheer numbers.
It's just that when something goes 

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,761
wrong,
it's so disturbing for us that we get 

32
00:01:46,761 --> 00:01:49,281
upset and we lump all other folks into 
the same category that that person came 

33
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:54,441
from almost to protect ourselves and we 
know it's a prejudice and like having a 

34
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:59,240
prejudice towards people who live in the
south or having a prejudice towards 

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,250
anything.

36
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,250
It's all the same.
Any kind of prejudice like it's not 

37
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,261
going to spend another 10 team.
Their fans is not a nicer prejudice 

38
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:10,520
because they just have a southern accent
and they lived down there and you just 

39
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:10,710
think it's cute to think they're 
retarded.

40
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,390
No,
that's Goddamn prejudice.

41
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:13,350
Those are people,
right?

42
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,510
If you thought they were tardy because 
they were black,

43
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,440
you'd be as a piece of shit.
Right?

44
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,490
Right.
But you can think that they're retarded 

45
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,501
just because they talk like this.
Like some of them that talk like this 

46
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:26,910
are actually super intelligent people as
they choose to keep their accent.

47
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,390
I've spoken to professors that are like 
a strong Houston,

48
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:35,391
Texas accent and guy was genius as fuck.
Exactly smarter than me.

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,650
We are.
We are tribal.

50
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,290
People are just trial and it's really 
easy to do that.

51
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,320
Those guys over there,
I don't like people from West Virginia 

52
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,320
or whatever.

53
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,320
I don't like them.
God Damn.

54
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,641
Comedians are smoking weed and they're 
talking hunting and that's not what 

55
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:50,160
hunting is about.
What hunting is about is how I do it.

56
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,560
I get up in the morning and I faced the 
east and it was that Muslims.

57
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:57,050
Now that's Muslim.
See now you're a trader and now you just

58
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,080
expose yourself.
No,

59
00:02:58,081 --> 00:02:58,410
no,
no,

60
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:02,050
no.
I meant I praise Jesus to the east,

61
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:02,710
west,
north,

62
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,640
and south.
You said ease major.

63
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,060
I'm not an.
I swear to God.

64
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:11,810
I am not a pale face.
Terrorists was that expression.

65
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,700
There's an expression,
oh,

66
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:14,200
clean skin,
clean face,

67
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,370
clean,
clean skin,

68
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,120
and terrorists.
I don't know.

69
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:21,121
I haven't heard of that.
Expression is for like the Timothy 

70
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:23,950
Mcveigh,
the ones that you don't see coming 

71
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,760
because they look like,
like fashion American boys.

72
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,830
Yep.
What is the term so you can find with 

73
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,830
that term?

74
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,830
As chairman?
Alicia is a good thing.

75
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,450
It's called clean skin terrorist.
That's what they.

76
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,900
They think of as like some homegrown 
nutty dude.

77
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,680
I was listening to this fucking radiolab
podcast about these dudes.

78
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,770
These white supremacists do that.
We're planning this mass murder and they

79
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:43,870
were infiltrated by the FBI.
Jesus.

80
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,340
It was fascinating,
man.

81
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,640
God Damn that National Public Radio 
podcasts,

82
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:51,340
radio labs.
One of the best things ever.

83
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,020
Not just like on podcasts,
but as far as like as move.

84
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,050
If it was a movie,
it would be one of the best things that 

85
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,050
it was a TV show.
It'd be one of the best things I you.

86
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,591
You turned me on to.
Things were haunting Dan Carlin's 

87
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:05,591
hardcore history.
I'm obsessed.

88
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:10,470
By the way.
Do you want to talk about a guy doing 

89
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,301
the world of service?
If you want to learn history and you're 

90
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:12,301
talking to a history major,
I read all the books,

91
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:12,310
blah,
blah,

92
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:12,490
blah.

93
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,350
I take courses from the teaching 
company.

94
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:17,380
If you want to learn history,
go to Dan Carlin's.

95
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,450
Hardcore history.
I have never.

96
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:24,451
I've listened to great professors.
I've never heard anybody kind of break 

97
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:26,980
down the history as a story where you 
just can't wait for the next podcast and

98
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:31,981
then radio lab,
which I've always listened to npr and 

99
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:32,890
sometimes they have those on there,
but radiolab is pretty amazing.

100
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,080
It's off the charts.
Amazing.

101
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,510
It's so good.
So it is cleaned skinned.

102
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,690
A clean skin terrorist is a potential 
attacker with a spotless record whose 

103
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,190
documents don't arouse suspicion.
Wow.

104
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,230
Well you gotta think like every 
terrorist,

105
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:52,231
every dude who blows a fuse,
there has to be like there's a moment 

106
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,750
where you could get to a certain age,
you can be like pretty nutty and get to 

107
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,520
a certain age without a criminal record 
and then you all the time.

108
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,710
You're like building up for the one big 
nutty event.

109
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Those are the scary guys that inside 
live inside and then they're just 

110
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,350
waiting for action.
Yeah,

111
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,760
they.
They're terrified and they just.

112
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,700
They're fantasizing that going over in 
her head,

113
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,420
going over their head and then they 
finally explode.

114
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,840
Now how did those guys get made?
Is that nature and nurture?

115
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,120
Isn't that?
Isn't that the ultimate question?

116
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Because if we could stop all people that
would wantonly want to create war for 

117
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:31,141
profit.
If we could stop all people that would 

118
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:33,850
act in the name of global aggression for
financial gain.

119
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:38,851
If we can stop all that,
we would all do it and then we'd have a 

120
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:41,581
way crazier world if we had a world 
where everybody was basically really 

121
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:42,160
nice.
Yeah.

122
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,000
I mean,
although,

123
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:48,001
although you're,
you're suggesting in the way you framed 

124
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:50,511
that as you're.
You're assuming that people that are 

125
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:55,261
aggressive or create aggression or the 
are the aggressors are doing it only 

126
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:59,701
for.
A lot of people think this only for 

127
00:05:59,701 --> 00:05:59,701
certain

128
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:03,190
negative things like a money conquest 
territory that the problem is that 

129
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,740
aggression,
a lot of times can be fostered in groups

130
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:11,741
of people if they think that another 
country is actually going to hurt them 

131
00:06:11,741 --> 00:06:16,571
in the future.
It can be very much useful in a self 

132
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:18,890
defense capacity or at least justified 
that way and always has been.

133
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:21,110
Absolutely.
And so I don't think you'll ever get.

134
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,560
I don't think you'll ever get rid of 
aggression and you probably shouldn't.

135
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,640
I think it's part of the order of the 
universe I bought.

136
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,070
What I think you have to do is this.
The biggest threat is,

137
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,370
you know,
one thing that's always kind of 

138
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,430
confounding about life is that it takes 
so long to build something.

139
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,280
It takes so long to build a complete 
human being.

140
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,520
It takes so long to build something like
the Sistine Chapel and it's so easy to 

141
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,200
destroy one motivated fanatic with a,
you know,

142
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,210
a large enough bomb on his back.

143
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,770
He could blow up,
you know,

144
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,250
St Peter's Cathedral or could kill.
I don't know how many people.

145
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,780
And that's what's so hard is that the 
things that take so long to build are so

146
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:04,540
easy to destroy and it,
as technology grows it,

147
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,660
it's going to become more and more a 
factor in more and more of a reality 

148
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,451
where one person or a small group can 
get their hands on devastating 

149
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:14,490
technology to destroy,
you know,

150
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,450
something impossibly huge.
So that's the bigger question.

151
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:19,910
I think aggression is always going to be
around.

152
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,950
And when you say,
you know,

153
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:26,951
I wonder how those people are made,
I don't know that it's going to be done 

154
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:29,471
by that one.
Crazy because one crazy can't get his 

155
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:32,021
hands on massive amounts of weaponry.
He's usually one guy and he carries a 

156
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:33,320
gun and he does enough damage.
Well,

157
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:35,180
how about these kids in the Boston 
bombings?

158
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,640
I mean,
they were fairly clean skinned.

159
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,620
They were and they didn't.
Do they,

160
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,180
they killed,
I think six people.

161
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:44,990
I can remember what the thing is,
but that's always tragic.

162
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,020
What I'm saying is that the,
the bigger threat is less aggression and

163
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:55,031
more sort of warped ideology then moves 
and motivates a large group of people 

164
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:55,750
into aggression.
Right.

165
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,190
That that's what I worry about and 
that's where I think,

166
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,230
you know,
when you say aggression,

167
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:05,231
you don't mean aggression,
like hostile takeover of countries type 

168
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:06,590
of aggression.
You mean just like male behavior?

169
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,880
Like what do you mean when you say 
aggression?

170
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,930
Aggression in this context is a military
sense.

171
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:17,090
Something that causes massive 
destruction,

172
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,360
irreparable harm to infrastructure and 
two populations and for example,

173
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,510
what's going on in Iraq with them,
like with Isis,

174
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:27,800
right?
When you hear the news,

175
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:30,770
if you just listen to the news,
Isis is this terrible group of fanatics.

176
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,510
Yes they are and they kill lots of 
people.

177
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,700
It's a much deeper problem.
You know,

178
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:35,990
they're talking about what do you do 
about isis?

179
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:37,100
Well,
do you bomb the shit out of him?

180
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:40,280
Problem is they're,
they're ingrained in the Sunni towns and

181
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:42,620
population and they have a lot of 
support by the Sunni's.

182
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,100
Why?
Why do these fanatical guys have support

183
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:51,101
from the Sunni population?
Has nothing to do with whether those 

184
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:51,700
Sunni people who are good people,
like you just said,

185
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,950
most people are really good people.
They are.

186
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,110
They are giving support to a fanatical 
group of people because they are their 

187
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:04,101
best hedge and their best bet against 
what's called Shia aggression in their 

188
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:04,860
eyes.
So the Shia,

189
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,670
the Shia who dominate the south of Iraq,
who sit on most of the oil down there.

190
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:14,270
If the Sunni's don't cut out a little 
place for themselves using this crazy 

191
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,951
group called Isis,
they could be left in there in the 

192
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:20,370
future,
in real fucking trouble.

193
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,790
And so again,
now we're talking about they're using 

194
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,150
aggression as a form in their eyes as a 
form of self defense.

195
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,420
If you are a Sunni Iraq,
you'd have a very different idea and 

196
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,360
context of what's,
what Isis is as as opposed to uni who 

197
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,900
get our information.
And again,

198
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,460
there's nothing to admire about those 
guys.

199
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:41,370
They are ruthless killers,
but it's just interesting that you and I

200
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:44,140
look at that as aggression on a ones.
You know,

201
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,770
one side is a lot of those people using 
ice as his health defense.

202
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,780
Aggression is justified.
Yeah,

203
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:50,490
they're terrible.
But we need them against the Shia.

204
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,300
So it's hard for someone who lives in 
California in 2015 to wrap their head 

205
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:01,320
around what's going on in other parts of
the world right now,

206
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,770
unless you.
I mean even what I've seen of it,

207
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,780
I haven't seen enough.
My,

208
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,270
my,
my seeing of it as all two dimensional.

209
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,680
No,
I couldn't imagine I couldn't fucking 

210
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,080
mansion.
It's one of the biggest problems we were

211
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:19,800
going to have with people that have seen
it and don't have to imagine it anymore.

212
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,500
Trying to forget it.
Trying to be normal again.

213
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,210
When you ask a fucking hell of a lot of 
people and,

214
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,000
and how do you help them through that 
and what kind of counseling?

215
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,550
Mental health counseling.
I hope it's comprehensive.

216
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,580
It's a really good question because they
always say after a war and after the 

217
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,840
revolution and after whatever happens in
a country settles,

218
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,940
everybody always forgets about the 
victims.

219
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,180
There's never really any kind of 
infrastructure to help people in Sierra 

220
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,480
Leone that got their arms hacked off.
That's the other kids killed in front of

221
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:53,481
them and stuff like that.
Is it possible that because of the 

222
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:55,770
ability that we have right now translate
languages so quickly,

223
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,120
you know,
it just really unprecedented something 

224
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,831
that people don't think about that much,
but there's all sorts of software now 

225
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:07,250
just on a regular phone that can look at
images and translate them into English 

226
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:07,250
on your screen.

227
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,400
The you could have asked questions and 
have those questions immediately 

228
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,960
translated into Spanish.
There's all these programs they have now

229
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,200
like it's way easier to understand under
other languages than it ever has been 

230
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,151
before.
To decipher actual texts in real time 

231
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:29,990
that really never existed before and 
that kind of technology is going to 

232
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,251
slowly but surely break down a lot of 
barriers and a lot of ideas that we have

233
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:35,520
about each other.
Well,

234
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:37,710
let's.
So language and I think more so the fact

235
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:41,250
that we can not only see suffering and 
realtime with cameras and the Internet,

236
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,700
but we can also.
We are also starting to see the 

237
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,231
cultures,
whether they're Indian or South Korea 

238
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:51,300
are really similar to Americans,
you know,

239
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:51,850
with,
with,

240
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,580
with K pop.
I mean Korea has got all their k pop and

241
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,480
stuff.
More importantly,

242
00:11:55,481 --> 00:12:00,481
when you see their artistic expressions,
they're making movie slumdog 

243
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:00,481
millionaire.

244
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:03,250
You see an Indian kid who has the same 
dreams and aspirations as anybody does.

245
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,550
I think that goes a longer way in 
bringing people into sort of a 

246
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,661
collective notion and it already has 
people like Steven pinker would argue 

247
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:16,770
that that it's becoming easier to 
identify with other people's suffering 

248
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:23,941
because we identify with a lot of 
aspects of how they live their lives to 

249
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:28,681
begin with.
It's no longer like who are those 

250
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,320
strange people with dark skin nowadays.
You know,

251
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,200
people are dressing the same no matter 
where you go,

252
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:37,430
you know,
and I kind of recognized on the plane 

253
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,230
from a woman from Bombay,
from Mumbai because she watches how I 

254
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,981
met your mother and telling me all her 
friends love how I met your mother and 

255
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:48,181
she was flipping out that the guy from 
how I met your mother was sitting next 

256
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:48,820
to her and she had a heavy accent.

257
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,140
She was talking like I couldn't.
I can't believe I'm watching all my 

258
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,250
friends.
I could.

259
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,260
I take a big step.
She was so excited and she had this 

260
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,480
heavy Indian accent and I thought that 
is,

261
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,690
that never would have happened.
No,

262
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,930
you never would have happened.
And so we are sharing artistic 

263
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,531
experience was sharing experience in 
high relief usually in movies and TV.

264
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,560
And that's in a lot of ways that's going
to go a lot farther than being able to 

265
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,790
download a language because I think 
that's always going to take more time.

266
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,920
Well,
if we all just spoke the same language,

267
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:23,470
it will be really fucking boring.
That's true.

268
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,500
But it would be really cool if we 
understood what the fuck everybody was 

269
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,970
saying all the time.
You know,

270
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,060
I think it would smooth out a lot of 
shit between people.

271
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:39,530
I really got to think that like if we 
could have like real time conversations 

272
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,270
with like Kim Jong,
uhm,

273
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,440
you know,
if you could have a real time 

274
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:46,440
conversation with that dude and sit down
and go,

275
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:46,640
what is your life like?

276
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,870
Like explained to me like what was,
what was childhood like for you?

277
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,430
What's the environment around you all 
the time.

278
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,840
He's a real,
he's a real life king and he's like,

279
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,850
he's a monarch.
One of the few remaining is not that he 

280
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,590
lives like a king and it was raised like
a prince and Dennis Rodman's,

281
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,750
his homeboy that problems,
a great,

282
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,260
great spokesman for him,
wasn't he?

283
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:11,261
Dennis Rodman comes down things with 
that dude and plays basketball and shit 

284
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:15,871
and then leaves like what kind of 
fucking bizarro reality TV world are we 

285
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:21,511
living in,
or Dennis Rodman just hops on private 

286
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:21,900
jets and hangs out with the king of 
North Korea.

287
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,520
Be the greatest reality show I ever 
made.

288
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,250
I mean him and Kim Jong Un,
me and me and me and the Canada.

289
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,750
It's like rocky Marciano hanging you and
Mussolini.

290
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,270
What do they talk about?
What do they talk about?

291
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,290
Look at them.
They're together.

292
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:40,530
Having a good old time.
Do you think he's freaked out at all 

293
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,020
about the middle amount of metal that's 
in Rodman's face?

294
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,490
I know.
Freaks them out.

295
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,480
God,
look at that.

296
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,720
That is such a strange thing.
Yeah.

297
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:47,890
Look at him.
He's a king.

298
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,040
I mean,
didn't he have his own uncle eaten wild 

299
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,040
dogs or something?
Why?

300
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,630
Yeah.
Oh,

301
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:54,740
that's right.
Yeah.

302
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,900
He assassinated him.
That says,

303
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,990
I was thinking about a Rodman.
Rodman did that had his uncle killed.

304
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,130
His uncle apparently was trying to 
organize a coup,

305
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,740
so he killed,
I believe he killed everyone in the 

306
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,540
family.
Everyone in the family except the wife,

307
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:20,110
and he gave the wife like a raise really
promoted her to a better position.

308
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,190
Real true.
Killed her husband.

309
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,480
Yeah.
Interesting.

310
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,190
You know,
something along those lines.

311
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:28,220
I'm going to be making that up.
It's real game of thrones shit.

312
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,060
Yeah,
it is.

313
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:34,270
I mean,
he really did kill his uncle and then 

314
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,971
his uncle's sons,
so his uncle's sons couldn't take 

315
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:36,971
revenge on him.
Yeah.

316
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:40,040
The Russians were good at that.
She used to do that and Stalin,

317
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,520
you get rid of.
Everybody needs to do that.

318
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:45,100
So I'm saying,
who was it?

319
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:46,950
It was talking about that.
I was at helmet shoulder.

320
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,270
One of the ex German premiers went to 
meet.

321
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,900
He said,
I want it.

322
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,240
Whereas the,
I want to say hi to the ambassador,

323
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,720
these different D German ambassador who 
I've known for 10 years,

324
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,980
and they said he was.
He was,

325
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:59,110
unfortunately,
he was,

326
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,190
he was executed for,
um,

327
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,670
for treason and he was like,
he'd known him for a long time and it 

328
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:06,830
was really kind of taken aback and I was
like,

329
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:07,250
oh,
that's,

330
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,720
that really makes me upset.
And he goes,

331
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:10,130
well,
can I see the family?

332
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:15,130
I got to know the family,
I'd like to give them my condolences to 

333
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,440
the family is no longer around either.
And uh,

334
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,290
he told that story.
I think it was on that.

335
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,070
Oh,
Charlie rose or something where.

336
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,830
Oh,
they killed his whole family.

337
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:23,660
That's real.
I mean.

338
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,220
And,
and again,

339
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,230
like you were saying,
we have no idea what it's like.

340
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:32,231
We're so lucky.
We're so lucky we can walk away from 

341
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:35,411
things we don't like because most of the
world has to live with something they 

342
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,531
don't like.
Concluding a government that tells them 

343
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,730
what to do and tells them where to live 
until some where they're going.

344
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,160
I don't know if this is propaganda or 
not.

345
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,490
I don't know if it's bullshit or not,
but I'm just telling you what I read,

346
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,170
that they were putting people in jail if
they didn't cry hard enough.

347
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,130
When Kim Jong Il died,
they.

348
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,770
Some of them were getting six months of 
hard labor from what?

349
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:01,130
I'm not crying hard because they were 
not grieving hard enough.

350
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:06,131
So you see these pictures that I'm 
beating their chest and crying party 

351
00:17:06,131 --> 00:17:08,750
members crying for know nobody wanted to
be.

352
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:12,410
The first person has stopped crying,
so they're crying for hours.

353
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,110
Oh my God.
This is madness.

354
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,690
That's like group madness.
Whether that's what North Korea is.

355
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,660
Group madness.
Yeah.

356
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:27,440
It's like you're watching what happens 
when you allow these really ancient,

357
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,830
horrific methods of dictatorship and 
they do even worse.

358
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:33,470
Hey,
if you really fucked up,

359
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,290
they'll put you in the coal mines and 
you never leave.

360
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,290
You never come out of the coal mine so 
you don't get any sunlight,

361
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,630
so your skin starts to fall off,
but you don't leave.

362
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,770
You're not getting up.
You're,

363
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,220
you're living in the coal mine.
Oh my God.

364
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,260
It's so bad for not crying.
Thousands of North Koreans face labor 

365
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,200
can't response in Labor yet.
Oh my God.

366
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,160
Upset enough about the death of Kim Jong
Il.

367
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,190
That is insane.
It's amazing.

368
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:02,880
Like I guess that's the only way to run 
a cultural.

369
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,880
Like if you're going to run it that way 
as a dictator,

370
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:08,700
you have to have everybody absolutely 
terrified all the time.

371
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,010
So no one takes a chance.
Wow.

372
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,910
How can you maintain that?
Uh,

373
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,790
fuck.
Are they maintaining that?

374
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,110
If your family might get put in jail or 
kill you,

375
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,280
you'll do it.
I know,

376
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:21,390
but I mean,
it's amazing.

377
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,730
I mean,
it has to be at like a boiling point.

378
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,290
Could you imagine?
Look at that.

379
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,330
These poor people,
even the kids,

380
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,970
they move you and they move.
They move.

381
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,540
You like your designated.
Where do you live in North Korea?

382
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:38,541
The neighborhood you live in,
if your family was against or for the 

383
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:42,710
original founder of North Korea,
Kim Jong,

384
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:44,370
UN's father,
if he was,

385
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:47,640
if they were in opposition to him,
you live in a very shitty neighborhood.

386
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,910
If they were allowed to have your three 
generations later,

387
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:52,910
you live in a good neighborhood.
Oh my gosh.

388
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,510
Yeah,
that's crazy.

389
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:56,220
Good stuff.
They're nice guy.

390
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:01,930
He apparently was mad during the famine 
and the nineties that people were 

391
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,540
eating.
The dogs were eating Korean dogs.

392
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,950
He's like,
there are national,

393
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:05,340
you know,
the,

394
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,360
the agenda has like one of our national 
treasures and these people are eating 

395
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,400
the dogs.
He was all irritated.

396
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,300
It's a good guy.

397
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:19,330
Yeah.
That's the worst country in the world 

398
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,350
and it's always read into that that way.
It's just so crazy to think that 

399
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,160
someone's able to pull that off in this 
day and age.

400
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,620
Well,
he's got nuclear weapons.

401
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,020
Thank you.
Pakistan.

402
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,480
It's just,
uh,

403
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:33,210
I just have a hard time believing that 
that can be maintained.

404
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:38,270
But yet here it is.
It the fact that it's still here in 

405
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:38,490
2015.
It's pretty nuts.

406
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
This is like really late in the terms of
civilization to have a full on dictator 

407
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:46,830
like that where we look,
look at those pills.

408
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:51,831
People crying again.
Could you imagine any sort of a scene 

409
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:54,630
like that in America?
If a guy died who was the king?

410
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,760
Can look at that,
look at all that.

411
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,960
So these poor people are just faking 
crying.

412
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,260
Everybody's terrified to not.
They all have handkerchiefs to stop 

413
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,860
crying too soon.
God.

414
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,850
Oh my God.

415
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,890
It is.
It's it's madness.

416
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:15,891
It's probably what a lot of history was 
about when you had a king and he was 

417
00:20:15,891 --> 00:20:18,210
absolute ruler and if he was a 
sociopath.

418
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,590
Luckily if you.
If you're lucky,

419
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:22,650
you got a good king.
Somebody who wasn't crazy,

420
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:27,651
God damn dude.
That is the nuttiest shit of all nutty 

421
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:30,171
shit.
The fact that there's a still a country 

422
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:30,171
of millions of people that live like 
that.

423
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:31,740
Yeah,
I know God damn.

424
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:37,430
That's terrifying.
And whenever people talk about 

425
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,130
privilege,
white privilege,

426
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:43,430
black privilege,
whatever kind of privilege you might 

427
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,430
have,
heterosexual privilege.

428
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,650
Here's the biggest privilege not having 
to live like those folks.

429
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,190
Exactly.
That's number

430
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,110
one.
Above all else that isn't that,

431
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,140
isn't that the reason?
One of the big reasons to at least read 

432
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,620
the newspaper or a little history or 
know what's going on in the world.

433
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:58,360
Have some perspective anyway.
You can get it.

434
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,400
Yeah.
You know?

435
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,080
Yeah.
That mean that the term white privilege,

436
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:04,300
like people don't like that term.
People get mad,

437
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,340
which usually means there's some 
validity to it,

438
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,640
but everybody's.
Everybody says like white privilege and 

439
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,370
you see a white dude role in his eyes.
You might have a little racist.

440
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:20,371
Anybody?
I might have a weird conversation with 

441
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:20,371
you and have to go,
wait,

442
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:20,420
what?
No.

443
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,380
Is Not a Muslim.
No,

444
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,770
no,
no,

445
00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:27,771
no.
I had a conversation with a friend like 

446
00:21:27,771 --> 00:21:30,010
that.
He's in the middle of the conversation 

447
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,640
goes,
I'm on Obama's biggest Muslim in the 

448
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:32,640
country.
I go,

449
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:32,640
no,
he's not.

450
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:32,640
What are you talking about?

451
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,730
Why you saying Shit like that?
Man?

452
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:35,920
There's no evidence that he's a Muslim 
at all.

453
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,580
No,
none.

454
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,870
Zero.
By the way,

455
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:40,610
his dad was a Kenyan and Muslim,
but he didn't know his dad very well.

456
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,830
He grew up in Hawaii,
right,

457
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:47,050
but the two is not living like some 
secret life where he's ready to blow up 

458
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,610
America from the inside that says these 
dumb ass thing,

459
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,920
callus on the middle of his head where 
he prays every day,

460
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,950
which is to really get.
You're supposed to that if you're very 

461
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:55,950
pious in Islam,
you get a.

462
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,660
You get a dark darker.
The skin in that area where you touch 

463
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,720
your head to the floor is darker than 
the rest of your skin.

464
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:04,000
That's when you know somebody really,
really religious.

465
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,320
So it's like the cauliflower ear of the 
Islam world.

466
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,240
Wow.
It's a badge of courage,

467
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:13,510
right?
What happens if you're a pussy and want 

468
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,281
like a little little pillow,
a little soft pillow or they get mad at 

469
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:15,281
John.

470
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:16,900
Don't the orthodox Jews were something 
like that when they pray.

471
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,000
Um,
I don't know.

472
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,440
I do not know what their practices.
Well,

473
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,100
but they want to get showing these guys 
with dark spots on their forehead.

474
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:28,140
Oh my God.
Well,

475
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,780
I just pulled up all these photos of 
these guys,

476
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,800
these super dark spots in there for.
That's when you know that you got to 

477
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,310
just,
just know that he's very religious.

478
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,170
He'll be that old dude with the glasses 
down there.

479
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:40,630
He's got like a hole in his head.
Well that is.

480
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,620
Yes.
A scroll down a little bit.

481
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,040
Some of bin Laden's righthand man,
that guy,

482
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,600
he's got his head.
It was our hearing.

483
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:54,360
That's the Egyptian Dr who is a Osama 
bin Laden's right hand man.

484
00:22:54,361 --> 00:22:56,650
And he's still at large and you make 
that photo larger.

485
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,610
Is that possible?
Fill at large by Jesus Christ.

486
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,960
Access forbidden.
Yeah.

487
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,140
He's a doctor to Jesus Christ.
Look at his forehead,

488
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:06,910
dude.
That that.

489
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:09,220
Man.
I never heard of this before.

490
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,930
This is insane.
Brian,

491
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,170
can you teach me something new?
Every time we talk.

492
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,370
Smart Bitch.
Come on.

493
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,380
Look at that forehead,
man.

494
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:22,381
That's crazy.
That dude has worn a hole in his head 

495
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:22,381
that's like,
it looks.

496
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:24,850
I mean it's hard to tell because it's 
fairly low resolution,

497
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,180
but whatever.
That is not a good guy by the way.

498
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,180
He's,
he's.

499
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,080
He,
he and assignment were good buddies.

500
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:33,430
He's still alive.
He's still out there.

501
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,920
They don't know where he is.
Whoa.

502
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,450
Egyptian doctor.
That's what we're using.

503
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,190
Very religious and very violent.
We live in a movie.

504
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,890
We really do.
We really live in a movie.

505
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:45,980
We live in a

506
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,870
movie and it's a weird one.
You mean?

507
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,090
You mean just the fact that we're 
Americans are in general.

508
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,150
The whole world is theater and it really
is.

509
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,190
I mean,
obviously it's real,

510
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,710
but what I'm saying is the way it's 
playing out,

511
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,190
it's so goofy.
It seems like a work of fiction.

512
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,250
The North Korea thing seems like a work 
of fiction.

513
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,640
The Uber pious gentleman dressed like a 
genie who's worn a hole in his head from

514
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:15,641
praying.
That guy is a character in a fucking 

515
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:15,641
movie.
Oh,

516
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:17,980
and by the way,
they can't find them phase out there and

517
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:19,730
make is out there.
He's a doctor.

518
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:24,731
He's evil.
He's probably got millions of dollars 

519
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:24,731
and they can't find.
Yeah.

520
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:28,240
When his Batman coming in were his 
Batman is.

521
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,570
It's true.
Right?

522
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,990
It's also weird,
like people have plans and they pull 

523
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:34,990
them off,
like they just get together and go,

524
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,981
listen,
you guys were gonna hijack planes and 

525
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:38,981
fly them into buildings.

526
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:40,940
You know,
people do Bengazi.

527
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,690
Yeah.
Anyway,

528
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:45,050
I mean there's a bunch of different 
things,

529
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,080
bitch,
bit different events that have happened 

530
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,080
all over the world where people kept 
their mouth shut,

531
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,690
plotted them and executed them.
Dan Carlin and says this beautifully,

532
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,960
he talks about,
we always talk about they live in the 

533
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:58,960
age of terrorism.
He said,

534
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:58,960
well,
the lineage Tara,

535
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,580
Tara was actually since 1914,
and he tells me a fascinating story.

536
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:03,170
If you don't know the origins of World 
War One,

537
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,850
it's very important because the world 
war one and World War Two,

538
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:11,890
our connected World War Two is the 
continuation of World War One and about 

539
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,640
80 or 90 million people lost their lives
because of those two wars.

540
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,800
And Oh,
and it destroyed all of old Europe.

541
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,830
Oh.
And it changed the entire map of the 

542
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:20,830
world.
Oh.

543
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,090
And all of us live in its wake in a much
deeper and more turbulent way.

544
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:24,530
Then you can imagine,
uh,

545
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,910
uh,
that in fact,

546
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:26,630
let me keep going.

547
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,130
If you want to know about the Middle 
East,

548
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:29,710
really,
you got to study World War II.

549
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,190
If you don't,
you know,

550
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:36,191
historian will take you seriously.
And Dan Carlin says something 

551
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:38,981
fascinating.
I don't know if you know the story said 

552
00:25:38,981 --> 00:25:40,650
it did.
World War One and the world you live in 

553
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,380
was changed by one man and his name was 
carvello princess.

554
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:47,650
And he was a Serbian terrorist.
And he found out that the archduke 

555
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,300
ferdinand of the ostrow,
Hungarian Empire doesn't matter,

556
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,450
was coming to town and they had control 
of Serbia and Serbia was looking for 

557
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:55,910
their independence.
So they said,

558
00:25:55,911 --> 00:26:00,911
we're going to kill this guy.
And he was in an open car with his wife 

559
00:26:00,911 --> 00:26:02,210
and he was in a parade and one of the 
Serbian terrorists came running out with

560
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:06,210
a grenade or a bomb through it at the 
car and it went it.

561
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,020
It had a faulty thing and it blew up 
under the other car.

562
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,960
And six out of six people were very 
badly injured.

563
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:14,180
I think one person was killed.
But guess what?

564
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:15,110
Our stoop,
Ferdinand,

565
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,330
he survives.
He goes,

566
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:19,790
he makes a full account.
They apologize to him.

567
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,370
And it remember,
this was in Serbia,

568
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,620
it was in Syria.
I Sara Aviel,

569
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,110
which was a sort of a colony,
if you will,

570
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,750
of the Servo Hungarian,
of the Austrian Hungarian Empire.

571
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:34,751
Here was the next in line for the,
the in charge of the Austrian Hungarian 

572
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:35,120
Empire.
Now check this out.

573
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,980
This crazy.
That's another story.

574
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:39,950
I've sat and listened to the podcast.
Maybe go ahead and keep saying it if you

575
00:26:39,951 --> 00:26:41,810
want.
So it's just awesome.

576
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:44,880
Because so,
so now they say,

577
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:46,560
well,
we missed our assassination attempt.

578
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,950
This Guy Carvello Prinsep who was part 
of this whole group,

579
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:55,010
goes in for a sandwich and as the arts 
duke for advanced and let's get you out 

580
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:55,880
of here.

581
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,370
Says,
no,

582
00:26:56,371 --> 00:27:01,371
I want to go to the hospital and I want 
to check on all the survivors of this 

583
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:01,371
bombing.
They said,

584
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:05,631
okay.
So they go down a road and the guy 

585
00:27:05,631 --> 00:27:07,731
misses his turn and he misses his turn 
and now he decides to back up and as 

586
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:10,620
he's backing up the car stalls and they 
got to kind of figure it out.

587
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,780
And as the car stalls,
because he missed a turn,

588
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,770
a guy named Carvello Prinsep,
part of this Serbian thing comes walking

589
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:18,510
out with a sandwich and he goes,
oh fuck.

590
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,480
There's the archduke Ferdinand.
He just right in front of me.

591
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,210
And he shoots him and he shoots his 
wife.

592
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,440
And that was because the driver missed a
turn and was backing up.

593
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:33,441
And carvello by coincidence,
just sees the archduke and shoots him 

594
00:27:33,441 --> 00:27:36,740
and that pin as Dan Collins has that 
created the hand grenade that was World 

595
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,210
War One and World War Two was because a 
driver missed a turn and because one 

596
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,320
terrorist,
1:20

597
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:45,660
year old guy had a gun in his hand and 
said,

598
00:27:45,661 --> 00:27:47,400
that guy's a bad guy and shot him.

599
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,530
And our world has changed forever 
because of that strange missed turn.

600
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,260
That's part of what's fascinating about 
history.

601
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,270
That's an amazing podcast.
Which one is the.

602
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,350
It's called the name,
it's called.

603
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,600
Yes.
It's called countdown to Armageddon.

604
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:05,601
Yes.
And it is awesome and I'm glad we got a 

605
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,060
chance to blueprint for getting 
blueprint farmer.

606
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,760
Good.
I'm so glad I had a chance to drive in a

607
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:13,761
car with you.
We had a long trip and we could listen 

608
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:13,761
to Dan Carlin's,
the Mongoltauge.

609
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,800
You opened a whole can of worms for me.
I've been telling you how crazy that 

610
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,080
was.
Like forever.

611
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,580
I'm like,
you just got to listen to this podcast.

612
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:23,310
When people say that to me though,
it's hard to take them seriously while I

613
00:28:23,311 --> 00:28:28,311
just got to listen to another podcast,
but if you listened to wrath of the 

614
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,720
cons,
you will be a changed human being,

615
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,290
100 percent.

616
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,320
You will understand what it was like to 
live in that time as best as anybody 

617
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,301
could ever describe it in a way that is 
so ultimately paralyzingly,

618
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:46,911
terrifying,
900 years old or whatever the fuck it 

619
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:46,911
is.
You mean because you're in your.

620
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:49,840
You're huddled in your church with your 
family and they're at the direct,

621
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,640
the gates in there.
They're bashing your gates down.

622
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,940
You know they're going to come in and 
kill everybody.

623
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,570
That was like,
what?

624
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:57,390
Eight hundred years ago,
700 years ago,

625
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,540
Jesus fucking Christ.
We're going to get your head cut off.

626
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:03,270
You're going to die by by stabbing or 
cutting.

627
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,940
It's going to suck,
and they were launching bodies.

628
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:10,941
They would light bodies on fire and 
launched them with catapults and that 

629
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:15,650
human fat burns better.
Apparently when you really light it on 

630
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,020
fire,
it can catch things on fire better.

631
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,990
They were so fucking ruthless.

632
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,670
While I was thinking about how they 
live,

633
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:22,110
like you know,
you and I,

634
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,200
we'd go hunting,
so we live outside and for four days or 

635
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,621
three days sometimes and it's miserable 
and we wake up and we're freezing and 

636
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:34,691
we're wet and we're like,
this pillows can wait to get back to 

637
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:34,691
civilization,
but we do it because we love it.

638
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,740
It brings us a close to objective 
reality where like I feel a little 

639
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:39,740
tougher,
a little more manly,

640
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,340
you know,
the Mongols I was thinking about how 

641
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,340
they,
I was kind of trying to picture it there

642
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,890
on a horse by the time they're three.
They live in the.

643
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,800
Yeah.
To stop and think about that.

644
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:47,650
Yeah.
Let's just start there.

645
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,720
Three,
throw the kid on a horse and I have a 

646
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:52,720
four year old.
She's not running any fucking horse.

647
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,090
Looks no fuck.
Especially wild horse in the tar tars.

648
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:01,680
Fairly broken and these still have like 
20 of them per Pi Whistle.

649
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,670
They'd be like,
no idea their horses show up.

650
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,200
I,
no,

651
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,390
I never had heard that.
I didn't know how the.

652
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:11,610
That was one of the most terrifying 
things is like how well organized they 

653
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:11,610
were.
Well,

654
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,630
because that's how they would hunt,
so they would hunt on horseback.

655
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,660
They were such trick riders.
Have you been on a horse since you were 

656
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:18,660
three?
You can do anything on a horse,

657
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,140
right?
You can shoot an Arrow on her horse.

658
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,650
You're just much faster,
but he was.

659
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:23,290
What was the were the clinical reality 
came in?

660
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:28,560
I thought to myself,
their lives were so violent to begin 

661
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:28,560
with.
First of all,

662
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,880
they lived.
The staple was mayor milk and blood from

663
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:32,530
their horse,
which they would mix.

664
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,680
They had mixed the milk and the blood 
and they would drink it and I wonder 

665
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,710
what that does to chemically what that 
tastes good.

666
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,920
Probably knocking Christ.
How many parasites did they have in 

667
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,320
their body?
By the time they were like 10 years,

668
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:49,350
God knows or none,
and they would chase because they would 

669
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,350
ferment the milk and they would.
They would.

670
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,210
The way they would hunt animals,
if they would do the same with humans,

671
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:57,211
they would.
They would sort of push them all into 

672
00:30:57,211 --> 00:30:59,821
one area.
Then create an opening for them to run 

673
00:30:59,821 --> 00:30:59,821
through and then they'd been waiting 
with a party there.

674
00:30:59,821 --> 00:31:04,680
They were so just daily existence was so
physical and violent and they had 

675
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,940
ultimate disdain for people that live 
behind walls.

676
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,110
They lived in felt tense and that was 
like their whole thing.

677
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:16,111
It's like the actual description of what
they were calling Genghis Khan,

678
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,800
something about ruler of all who dwell 
in the tents.

679
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:25,000
It's nothing crazy that they would show 
up in town and they would say,

680
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:30,001
look,
I guess you guys weren't aware that you 

681
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:30,001
owe gingiss con money.

682
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:30,280
Yeah.
So or jingles.

683
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,280
They like to say genius.
It was gang is when John Wayne did it.

684
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:38,281
I grew up with gangs.
I swear to got to go hang with Dan 

685
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:38,281
Carlin.
I was like,

686
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:39,970
dude,
this holiday Gangas Ching is gone.

687
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,640
His real name is [inaudible],
but Dan Carlin,

688
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:47,170
what he does so good is make it utterly 
fascinating.

689
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,770
He's such an expert narrator 
storyteller.

690
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,490
He's an expert.
I mean like a real master at it.

691
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:57,670
So when he's telling you these stories,
it's not just.

692
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,630
It's not just really cool information,
which most absolutely is,

693
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,650
but it's the ways written it all and put
it together and worded it.

694
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:08,440
It's just fucking.
He lives in Portland.

695
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,380
Don't give him his fucking address with 
the Mongols.

696
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:12,070
Come here.
Right.

697
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,060
Shit,
man.

698
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,380
I'm just going to be important that a 
little bit.

699
00:32:14,381 --> 00:32:16,150
I want to try to him man,
getting.

700
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:17,200
We're Dan,
if you're listening to this,

701
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,180
come to my show in Portland.
He's a great guy.

702
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,940
You'll love tweeting with them.
Super Cool Guy.

703
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,400
Real fun.
I've had him on the podcast a few times.

704
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,330
Yeah,
I'd love to meet.

705
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,380
He's doing a goddamn national service 
with that 100 percent of world's 

706
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:31,380
service,
I should say.

707
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,170
I shouldn't say interpersonal.
It's on the Internet.

708
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:37,410
Could not agree more.
It's so much more entertaining than any 

709
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:40,580
other history thing I've ever witnessed 
and watched.

710
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Listened to.
I mean I've spent enough time over the 

711
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,280
past 20 years at least listening to 
different kinds of like the turning 

712
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,490
points in European history and you know 
from the teaching company,

713
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:51,920
really good professors and nothing 
compares to that guy.

714
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,670
Nothing.
Well,

715
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:54,990
there's so many good podcasts right now.
It's just like there's a,

716
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,220
you know,
I was talking with someone yesterday 

717
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,831
about how many good tv shows there are 
today as opposed to like when we were 

718
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,570
kids,
like we were kids.

719
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,380
Like what was a really good show on TV?
I Mash,

720
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:14,290
I guess mash was a really good.
What was it like a really good drama was

721
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,010
running.
Oh,

722
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,400
Hill street blues.
Hill street blues was great,

723
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,630
but that's the only one I can think of 
off the hill street blues is later.

724
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,970
That was like,
wasn't that.

725
00:33:21,971 --> 00:33:23,910
It was 85.
What does it really?

726
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,160
Actually it was 80,
81.

727
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:27,020
Why do I have that all fucked up in my 
head?

728
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,080
Oh,
I think I haven't fucked up with NYP ed 

729
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,080
blue.
That's what it is.

730
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,080
Yeah.
That's what it is.

731
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,410
What else?
What's that?

732
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,520
A good drama.
I can't think of a good drama right now.

733
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:39,590
Compare that to what's available today.
Compare that to game of thrones.

734
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:43,730
Walking dead mad men breaking bad.
Better.

735
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,970
Call Saul.
Yeah.

736
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,260
House of cards.
Homeland.

737
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,050
Jesus Christ.
It's not.

738
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:56,051
I can't even keep up.
Salt of wizard shows they're so goddamn 

739
00:33:56,051 --> 00:33:58,640
good and you got to be good because they
have those hbo shows.

740
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:03,641
Now,
those hbo shows took everything to a 

741
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:04,490
totally different level.
When they put out the soprano's,

742
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:08,120
the whole game changed.
All of a sudden you're like,

743
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:09,980
Jesus,
this is better than a movie.

744
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,680
This is a movie that's forever because 
they made a character.

745
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,680
It used to be.
The rule was that character has to be 

746
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,631
somebody you like,
who you want to bring in your living 

747
00:34:19,631 --> 00:34:22,271
room every week.
That was the rule and when you went to 

748
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:22,580
pitch a show and your character wasn't 
quote unquote likable,

749
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,040
people were like,
Nah,

750
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,690
it's not going to work.
Along comes Tony Soprano,

751
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,630
huge adulterer,
murderer,

752
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:34,860
kill his friend,
his friend and tells his son to do his 

753
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,540
homework.
In the same breath,

754
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:39,950
talk about a dichotomy and and of course
as human beings,

755
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:40,400
we're like,
well,

756
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:42,410
that's real life.
That's how I feel sometimes.

757
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,500
He was the courageous mob character in 
the history of mob characters over the 

758
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:51,980
top,
down the hill,

759
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,500
through the valley,
up the mountain,

760
00:34:54,501 --> 00:34:57,200
through the ocean.
Everyone else can suck his dick.

761
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,400
All of them,
they all can suck his dead.

762
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,220
We were talking about the greatest of 
all time.

763
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,280
I think me and shop and a couple other 
people were talking about the best 

764
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,730
overall character on TV ever.
Yeah,

765
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,640
I think it's got to be Tony Soprano.
I vet or Walter White.

766
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,110
The felons or why?
It's a good bet.

767
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,060
Yeah,
I was.

768
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,770
I was torn between the two and I think I
ultimately went with Walter,

769
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:18,260
but I might say now because of peer 
pressure.

770
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,210
Tony Soprano.
Yeah.

771
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:20,780
You know,
there's,

772
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,650
there's been some goddamn good ones.
There's like,

773
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:29,060
but that his character had.
We had so much time to get to know him.

774
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,930
Yeah.
You know,

775
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:32,630
and that's just so different was that it
was,

776
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:37,870
wasn't like television style,
like show making.

777
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,280
It was movie making,
but it was a new thing because it was 

778
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,840
really complex and you could do it over 
a long time.

779
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,090
You could have a season and you're 
going,

780
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:53,091
you know,
you're telling a story over months and 

781
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:53,091
months and you're getting people 
addicted.

782
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:57,410
It's a completely different experience.
And you realized like at a certain 

783
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:57,410
level,
like they,

784
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:02,070
that show changed everything.
That changed everything.

785
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,970
It was just so next level.
It was.

786
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,580
I never gave a fuck about mob shows.
Yeah,

787
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,080
it was one before that.
In a way.

788
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:12,870
It wasn't even a mach show in a way.
It was a guy running two families,

789
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,060
a crime family and his own family.
That was.

790
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:20,270
That was the idea.
So you were looking at a human being and

791
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:23,610
what I think they did an amazing job was
as evil as he was,

792
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:25,500
they were putting them in impossible 
situations.

793
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,500
You couldn't run that fucking crime 
family without being a complete 

794
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,460
motherfucker.
Yet he had to run his own family,

795
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:34,020
make marriage work.
That's it.

796
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,680
I didn't know a lot of people identified
with the impossible life is that way.

797
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,960
Yeah.
It's an extreme example,

798
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:40,840
but you know,
it's,

799
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,020
it is really.
It's like we could almost,

800
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,260
if you were born that guy and that guy's
family and that guy's life and that 

801
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:48,810
guy's neighborhood with that guys 
experiences,

802
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:53,490
you would be in the exact same situation
as he is right now at chain of events.

803
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:55,650
From the time you were shot out of your 
mother's,

804
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:58,290
Vijay,
Jj has led you to where you're at.

805
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,300
It's just like looking at those North 
Korean people.

806
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:05,301
Man,
should they pull themselves up by their 

807
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:07,161
bootstraps?
Like what should they do to anyone to 

808
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:07,161
say,
hey,

809
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:07,960
hey,
you know what?

810
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,360
Hey,
where everybody's got to hug.

811
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,670
My friend Mike,
he was born in Africa,

812
00:37:11,671 --> 00:37:14,000
but he said I want to be American.
So he got in the car.

813
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,020
He drove to the airport,
you know,

814
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,570
you know those guys.
If they wanted to,

815
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:19,240
they could do it.
Like,

816
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,110
do you know what the fuck you said?
You anecdotal asshole.

817
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:27,380
He told one shitty story about some 
supposed friend that probably doesn't 

818
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:27,960
even exist.
It was born in the step.

819
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,930
I remember the argument with them.
It's like if you make.

820
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:36,110
If you make the sanction strong enough,
his people will get so miserable that 

821
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,291
Delta overthrow the go.
You try overthrown that guy when he 

822
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:39,291
kills your whole family.
Yeah.

823
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:41,910
They're the ruthlessness that these 
people operate under.

824
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:46,911
Like if you live in American,
you haven't experienced war and you 

825
00:37:46,911 --> 00:37:49,170
start talking about stuff like that.
Like start talking crazy,

826
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,060
but do you remember there was a time 
during the debates that John Mccain,

827
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:59,120
I think,
I think anytime you've got Sarah Pailin 

828
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,030
as your fucking running mate,
you're hamstrung,

829
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:00,570
right?

830
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,890
I mean you're basically over because no 
one,

831
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,890
no one rational is going to say yes to 
that.

832
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:10,190
Like you've got someone have really 
clearly marginal marginable 

833
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,400
intelligence.
Yeah.

834
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,460
It's a very marginal right.
If you look at the way she communicates,

835
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,170
she's.
She's obviously not very bright.

836
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:21,230
She's certainly very myopic in her 
experience and her perspective.

837
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:24,270
She's got that down home,
folksy thing going on,

838
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:25,440
but it's.
It seems,

839
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,130
which is very poorly thought out.
Like there are people that are down home

840
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:31,950
and folks when you talk to them their 
way of communicating,

841
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,880
you can.
You can,

842
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,710
you can still get through that to that 
like,

843
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:35,980
well,
this

844
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,600
is an intelligent nuanced person with a 
lot of depth to what they're saying.

845
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:43,870
This is just the way they they talk to 
maybe from Wisconsin.

846
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:45,970
Maybe it's like Doug Durant,
our friend Doug.

847
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,470
Yeah.
From Wisconsin.

848
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:49,780
Very,
very smart guy and brilliant.

849
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:50,770
Yeah.
Brilliant guy.

850
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,760
If you underestimate him because he's a 
farmer in Wisconsin,

851
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,100
we'd be in for a surprise.
Yeah,

852
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:02,101
exactly.
Like the idea that some someone has to 

853
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:05,041
fit into any particular style of 
communication just to Napa and we were 

854
00:39:07,451 --> 00:39:09,940
talking about what was the wine,
it was canvas,

855
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:14,941
which is a high end wine,
like $200 a bottle and she was saying 

856
00:39:14,941 --> 00:39:18,120
that the guy who makes the wine,
I mean when you buy a winery and a 

857
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,701
restaurant,
please be ready to spend if it's 

858
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:20,701
special,
select 325 bucks and you'd think this is

859
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:22,870
a genius winemaker,
and she was like,

860
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:25,330
he's a farmer at parties,
piece of farmer.

861
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:28,720
He grows good grapes and then kind of 
does the thing that he was told,

862
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:33,721
but at the end of the day,
Wagner is a farmer and and you had 

863
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:34,030
underestimated him.
You saw him in his overalls and you'd be

864
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:39,031
like,
well that guy's one of the best 

865
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:39,031
winemakers in the world.
Will those folks that we were talking to

866
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:40,780
up in Napa,
the Rainelle is friends.

867
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:41,500
Friends.
Yeah.

868
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:45,800
They were all farmers are grape farmers.
The noises people.

869
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,170
They were.
How about that was so cool.

870
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,470
The food was delicious.
As soon as I saw that guy and I saw that

871
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,550
he was cooking,
tried tips.

872
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:52,600
I'm like,
this motherfucker.

873
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:54,910
I guarantee you could cook the shit out 
of a tri tip.

874
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,210
However you said old California dudes,
old rancher,

875
00:39:58,211 --> 00:40:01,630
California.
Do they know how to cook those tri tips?

876
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,270
Because it tried.
Tip is a very peculiar type of meat.

877
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,070
It's very lean.
You can't overcook it.

878
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,320
You got to cook it the right amount.
It's not a lot of fat on it,

879
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,870
but if you know how to nail it and for 
whatever reason,

880
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:12,310
California ranchers,
dude,

881
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,590
special ed,
they had like a special grill for it.

882
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,360
I think it's called Santa Maria Grill 
and it cranks and as you're cranking,

883
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:24,390
you're like raise or lower it above,
above the heat and you want to make it 

884
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:24,640
you.
It's like you have to.

885
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:29,770
This is back.
They learned how to do this shit before 

886
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:29,770
they have thermometers was just how the 
fork would go into it.

887
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,830
They could figure out like how done it 
was just by how the fork felt,

888
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:38,010
how it slid into it.
So I saw that dude and I saw he was 

889
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,010
cooking tips.
I'm like,

890
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,680
Oh,
where we were eating here dude,

891
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,570
because we were thinking about going to 
a restaurant.

892
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,690
I was like,
restaurants in the world.

893
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,720
We actually forego or went down because 
it was so god damn boy,

894
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,140
that guy was cool as fuck.
And we started talking to him.

895
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,220
Damn it.
Do you remember his name?

896
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:53,670
And now I want to say Mike,
I know his son is a model for rick or 

897
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:58,831
Mike.
His son who was a nice guy was there is 

898
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:58,831
a model,
I forgot to give him shit for it.

899
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,881
But if someone's a model for a romance 
novel Vampire Romance on a lot of 

900
00:41:02,881 --> 00:41:03,250
vampire was ah,
you know,

901
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:06,430
you've made it when you're a model for 
vampire romance novels.

902
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,260
And I forgot his name too,
but he was cool.

903
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:12,490
Very friendly guy,
but he's just some guy.

904
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,640
I interrupted you with my,
my tangential story about that because 

905
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,310
you reminded me of it and you were,
you were making a larger point.

906
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,000
What was I saying?

907
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,400
Fuck me.
Whatever it was,

908
00:41:21,401 --> 00:41:22,960
it couldn't be that unfortunately.
Exactly.

909
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:25,860
Keep it rolling.
Keep it rolling here.

910
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,580
I don't even remember at all.
Hey Man.

911
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:28,930
We went.
We went Turkey hunting.

912
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:31,630
You guys look at this quote from the 
Denver police,

913
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,770
the Denver police.
They put out a tweet.

914
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,030
I'm.
No,

915
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:36,260
that's not what it was,
Jamie.

916
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:38,300
There was one.
It was more hilarious.

917
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,060
Scroll down a little bit.
It was the four slash 20 tweet.

918
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,330
Does it like there is.
No.

919
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,850
They had like a,
like Roland,

920
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:48,050
Roland,
Roland put it.

921
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:48,950
It's on my twitter.
Dude.

922
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,900
Just go to my twitter and you'll find 
it,

923
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,710
but it's.
It's actually kind of hilarious.

924
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,260
I retweeted it.
I think it's a good patient.

925
00:41:57,261 --> 00:41:58,910
I their there.
Fuck,

926
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,360
look at that in Denver said,
I said even the police or high end for 

927
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:04,360
20.
Look at this.

928
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:04,640
This is the police.

929
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,030
We see you Roland,
but we ain't hate and ha ha.

930
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,580
Seriously though.
Hashtag Denver.

931
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,390
Please remember to Hashtag consume 
responsibly this for 20 weekend.

932
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,410
Good fats and the police department,
like the police department in Denver,

933
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,780
they have little music things there.
What are those?

934
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:23,270
Emojis?
A little music kimojis for them.

935
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:28,540
Good for them.
I love it was not the nicest police 

936
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:28,540
department of all time.
They might be.

937
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,660
See,
ladies and gentlemen,

938
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:32,750
this is what happens when you let a 
state gets stoned.

939
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,740
This is what happens.
This is exactly what I've been telling 

940
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:38,740
you forever and it's an action right 
now.

941
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:43,030
This is the police are nicer first 
cylinder and nobody was getting 

942
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,730
cavities.
Now it's we'd.

943
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:46,280
Where'd it go?
Colorado is Colorado.

944
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,810
Is Florida in the water.
Good Dude.

945
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:48,730
Is that,
is that real?

946
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,420
Well,
that's what I think in the fifties,

947
00:42:50,421 --> 00:42:55,421
what they found with certain communities
in Colorado that we're not getting 

948
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:55,421
cavities thing.

949
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:56,290
It's in Colorado and they couldn't 
figure out why.

950
00:42:56,291 --> 00:43:01,291
Why aren't the kids getting cavities?
And they found there's a high level of 

951
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:01,291
Florida and the water naturally.
Yeah.

952
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:01,910
Yeah.
That does happen,

953
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:03,010
right?
Like if you have a.

954
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,900
there's some waters that have higher 
levels of fluoride,

955
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:07,720
like natural fluoride.
Yeah.

956
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,020
And apparently there's.
That's one of the things it's supposed 

957
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,550
to be not good.
When you drink distilled water,

958
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:18,020
they say don't know because you want all
those minerals and all that other jazz.

959
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:19,280
It's in water.
Very much so.

960
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:24,281
I think,
and I believe you used distilled water 

961
00:43:24,281 --> 00:43:24,281
on a plant,
a lot of times the plant dies.

962
00:43:24,281 --> 00:43:28,610
That's what I was told from a farmer,
but some people think that fluoride 

963
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:32,350
ultimately is not good for your body.
Is there any science that goes with 

964
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:32,720
that?
Because people love to quote.

965
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,450
They always say this one thing,
hey man,

966
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:37,400
calcifies your pineal gland,
and I'm like,

967
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:39,740
have you done any lab biopsies?

968
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,290
If we have a pretty good big control 
group,

969
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:44,870
like,
like the entire population of the United

970
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:49,870
States over the past 50 years,
I don't see a lot of people with 

971
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:50,470
calcified pineal gland,
pineal gland.

972
00:43:50,471 --> 00:43:52,580
I don't know if that's even a real thing
for Sarah.

973
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:57,610
I don't know.
Is it possible guy isn't the pineal 

974
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:57,610
gland?
Yeah,

975
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,970
that's what they're saying is that it 
always feels a little stiff.

976
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:00,500
I can't see out of it.
I'll tell you that much.

977
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,530
And then there's this other one that 
they say that maybe snopes this Jamie.

978
00:44:03,531 --> 00:44:08,531
They said you do that fluoride in the 
water was pioneered by the Nazis for 

979
00:44:08,531 --> 00:44:09,620
mind control,
Dude.

980
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,250
Well get you knew that man.
So with think about that.

981
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,120
Think about that man.
I drink green water wilting in that 

982
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,770
because you haven't thought about it.
Big Dude.

983
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,410
You don't even know fucking I'm online.
It was the last time you read about,

984
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,480
besides twilight decides to Info wars 
manual of life infowars.com

985
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:31,330
book.

986
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:37,050
Besides twilight.
If you're a guy and you're reading 

987
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,670
twilight number clauses,
I come out of the closet.

988
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,100
You can be like what you like.
It's all right.

989
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:46,310
Like what you'd like man,
I was at the Chateau Marmont and that 

990
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:49,191
guy sat and sat at the table with me and
my buddy Frank Grillo or at the guy the 

991
00:44:49,191 --> 00:44:52,560
main vampire that throw the fucking guy 
from twilight.

992
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,790
Robert Pattinson.
Yes.

993
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,950
And he sat at my table and I stared at 
him.

994
00:44:58,951 --> 00:45:03,951
I didn't say hi.
He was very nice and he got up and it's 

995
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:03,951
like nice to meet everybody and I was 
like,

996
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,870
see you later.
That's my story about him.

997
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,450
That's an amazing story.
Thank you buddy.

998
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,230
Dude,
you should.

999
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,150
You should write that down.
I met him.

1000
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,800
Um,
there's a guy named John Stewart that I 

1001
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,271
used to work with a on fear factor.
The greatest hilarious dude,

1002
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:25,780
just a guy who had been in show business
forever and he was a straight total pro.

1003
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,280
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,
it can't get any better than.

1004
00:45:29,281 --> 00:45:32,910
This is just one of those guys.
He would move the contestants through.

1005
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:34,770
Everybody was smiling when they talked 
to them.

1006
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,880
Just one of those motherfuckers.
He's Kristen Stewart's dad.

1007
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,790
Oh Wow.
Makes Sense.

1008
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,820
Of course she was raised by a wild man.
He's a cool motherfucker.

1009
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,910
He's the coolest long hair,
scraggly hair.

1010
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,720
His daughter's school dude,
man has been around forever.

1011
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,960
Just a super sweet guy.
I grew up around sets acting.

1012
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:55,590
Yeah,
probably,

1013
00:45:55,591 --> 00:45:58,080
but back then like she did a couple 
movies and I was like,

1014
00:45:58,081 --> 00:46:03,081
dude,
why are you letting your daughter do 

1015
00:46:03,081 --> 00:46:03,081
that?
Isn't it freak you out?

1016
00:46:03,081 --> 00:46:03,330
And she's like,
can I get famous at a young age?

1017
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:08,331
And she wasn't worried about it and then
obviously she became this giant fucking 

1018
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:08,340
movie store.
So I'm like,

1019
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,170
dude,
lucky he didn't listen to me.

1020
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,620
Yeah,
get her out of Alistair.

1021
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:16,410
I was telling you to pull your daughter 
selling insurance right now,

1022
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,080
the gigantic fucking movie star.
So don't listen to me ever,

1023
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,530
or how about that if I give you advice,
but who knows,

1024
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:24,630
man,
truth about fluoride doesn't include the

1025
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:25,770
Nazi myth.
Okay.

1026
00:46:25,771 --> 00:46:28,830
So the Nazis a minute.
If history shows,

1027
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:33,831
I actually didn't Nazi Germany and one 
of the first things they did was add 

1028
00:46:33,831 --> 00:46:35,130
fluoride to the water and the ghettos 
were the Jews stayed.

1029
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:39,090
Matt Leffler of Cleveland told the 
county commissioner Tuesday before.

1030
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,080
Well,
what does it say here?

1031
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,640
Well,
if he's saying,

1032
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
okay,
what is this is not saying whether it's 

1033
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,860
real or not real or who knows.
It's just a story on it.

1034
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,920
We should figure out like what is the 
actual truth?

1035
00:46:52,921 --> 00:46:54,360
Where's the story come from?
Here it goes.

1036
00:46:54,361 --> 00:46:56,130
What is the story?
Cause no teeth to this claim.

1037
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,760
Yeah.
I can almost guarantee you that it is 

1038
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,260
indeed in the urban myth said,
and the whole injury.

1039
00:47:03,261 --> 00:47:06,450
Who handles the media relations with the
US Holocaust memorial museum.

1040
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,500
Well,
okay.

1041
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,220
Hmm.
Okay.

1042
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,110
It seems like it's not real done right.
Or could be.

1043
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,710
Wasn't about Nazis,
Florida in water.

1044
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,420
It was communist,
but okay.

1045
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:24,030
So it seems like more than likely it was
an urban myth.

1046
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,010
Well,
now what about,

1047
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:30,550
this is the thing,
Jamie Google this fluoride calcifies the

1048
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:33,160
pineal gland,
because I just want to get to the bottom

1049
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:34,480
of this.
Get to the bottom of this.

1050
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:38,080
Studies have been done on the pineal 
gland.

1051
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:39,520
What happens if,
what's floor?

1052
00:47:39,521 --> 00:47:41,800
I do it in there.
When are they going to clone hair?

1053
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:43,930
That's what I want to know.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1054
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,070
you can get hairier fluoride,
deposition age,

1055
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:50,590
human pineal gland.
Ooh.

1056
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,770
So is it saying to pot?

1057
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,840
The purpose was discover.
That purpose was to discover whether 

1058
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,150
fluoride accumulates in the aged human 
pineal gland.

1059
00:48:01,151 --> 00:48:05,920
The aims were to determine a f 
concentrations of the pineal gland,

1060
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,570
wet,
whatever that means.

1061
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,310
Corresponding muscle,
wet and bone ash be counseling.

1062
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:15,760
Calcium,
concentration of the pineal,

1063
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:21,330
pineal,
muscle and bone were dissected from 11 

1064
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:21,910
aged cadavers.
Okay.

1065
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:25,440
What does it say to or too much reading?
I'll take A.

1066
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,600
I'll take a calcium pineal gland then 
hold her teeth.

1067
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,700
My teeth suck.
Here it goes right here.

1068
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:34,210
Fluoride does not accumulate in the 
brain who.

1069
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:35,040
Wait a minute.
Okay,

1070
00:48:35,041 --> 00:48:36,940
so it's not,
so you would really do that though.

1071
00:48:36,941 --> 00:48:39,790
You would take of calcium and your 
pineal gland.

1072
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,980
It means saying it's not real,
but what if it was real?

1073
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,890
Yeah.
You knew t.

1074
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,770
that's right.
Well,

1075
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:46,810
I don't want holes in my teeth.
Go with dentists.

1076
00:48:46,811 --> 00:48:48,280
Dentists,
pineal gland.

1077
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:54,950
I do makes Melatonin Shit.
They believe now that it makes 

1078
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,830
dimethyltryptamine that really heavy 
duty psychedelic.

1079
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:00,310
They uh,
it makes a bunch of different things.

1080
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:05,620
Shit,
take Melatonin pills and have good 

1081
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:05,620
teeth.
You know what it looks like.

1082
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,720
The weird thing about the pineal gland,
have you ever seen the look,

1083
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,440
look up a Egyptian image,
pineal gland.

1084
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:14,880
The actual like side,
um,

1085
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,280
view of the pineal gland.
I didn't even know it was actually a 

1086
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,581
real.
I always thought it was like the third 

1087
00:49:23,581 --> 00:49:23,581
item is,
yeah,

1088
00:49:23,581 --> 00:49:23,581
it's a real.
That's what's really fucked up.

1089
00:49:23,581 --> 00:49:26,110
Look what it looks like.
It looks like that thing a lot,

1090
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:31,830
that Egyptian solo a lot.
And if you look at the actual structure 

1091
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,550
of the pineal gland and that I,
what does that,

1092
00:49:33,551 --> 00:49:37,570
I suppose to represent?
Probably someone super smart is watching

1093
00:49:37,571 --> 00:49:39,490
you bitch too.
It looks like to me,

1094
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:44,940
I mean it's super,
super similar in appearance with the 

1095
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,240
pineal gland looks like and what that 
thing looks like.

1096
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,240
If it's dissected and cut.
I'm sure that the Egyptians did their 

1097
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,450
sheriff cutting brains up and being.
You look at that thing nest.

1098
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,050
That's where the pineal gland is way in 
the side of the brain.

1099
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:58,000
I thought it was right to write in your 
forehead.

1100
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:58,840
No,
it's like,

1101
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,970
it's like look where your eyeballs are,
right?

1102
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:07,190
Yeah.
And then it's like literally like right 

1103
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:09,220
here and back like right where your 
brainstem right in there.

1104
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:13,750
Apparently they think that this 
uncertain,

1105
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:17,740
like lower animals like snakes I think 
or reptiles.

1106
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,190
That thing actually has a retina and a 
lens.

1107
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:24,550
I don't see where it says pineal gland 
on this thing.

1108
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:29,180
I think that's a backup there,
Jamie.

1109
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,650
That's what the gland is and that's 
where it is.

1110
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:35,210
Let's see.
You know,

1111
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,640
see where.
Where does it show it?

1112
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Does it have a buddy?
That's the thalamus buddy was acquitted 

1113
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,000
of that

1114
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,920
pineal gland part one right there.
See pineal gland on the right and there 

1115
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,490
they are.
Okay.

1116
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,760
That's what they're saying here.
Neither of us know what the fucking 

1117
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,350
pineal gland looks like.
There is a pineal gland is looks like I 

1118
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,200
said at the base.
How freaky is that?

1119
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:04,160
I don't know.
It's all this.

1120
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:09,170
There's just the.
The knowledge that your brain is making 

1121
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,211
all these weird chemicals all the time 
and keeping them in balance is super 

1122
00:51:12,211 --> 00:51:15,601
important and you can do it with 
exercise and you can do it with like 

1123
00:51:15,601 --> 00:51:20,400
having positive thinking and getting 
outside and the sun and it's also what 

1124
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,481
is the brain?
That's what sort of what really is it 

1125
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:24,481
really is it,
you know,

1126
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:27,820
what kind of some sort of blows my mind.
Some sort of a.

1127
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:31,280
As it's functioning as it's all lit up,
right?

1128
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:36,780
It's some sort of a portal to everything
in the universe and that's really what 

1129
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:41,431
the brain is and eventually that,
that thing will get to a point where 

1130
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:49,680
it's capable of communicating with 
anybody within any reasonable distance 

1131
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,110
instantaneously.

1132
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:54,340
So as this brain continues to get 
stronger,

1133
00:51:54,341 --> 00:51:59,341
accumulate more information,
accumulate more technological 

1134
00:51:59,341 --> 00:52:03,130
breakthroughs that allow it to do more 
things and manipulate matter more.

1135
00:52:03,131 --> 00:52:08,131
As long as it stays alive,
as long as the human organism stays 

1136
00:52:08,131 --> 00:52:11,401
alive,
you've thought of it as a giant super 

1137
00:52:11,401 --> 00:52:11,401
thing.
Yeah.

1138
00:52:11,401 --> 00:52:14,500
It's something that if you're looking at
the in terms of the creation of the 

1139
00:52:14,561 --> 00:52:17,170
earth,
the earth is billions of years old.

1140
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:22,171
It took a long fucking time to go from 
the first version of the earth.

1141
00:52:22,421 --> 00:52:26,590
All the rocks and the lava and the water
and shit to what we have today.

1142
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,570
It takes a long ass time.
Well,

1143
00:52:28,571 --> 00:52:33,571
I think the human organism takes a long 
ass time to become what it really is and

1144
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:39,301
what it really is,
is the universe figured out how to build

1145
00:52:39,671 --> 00:52:44,671
something that can make a universe.
While I was going to say that the human 

1146
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:48,361
brand is going to get to a point where 
it's able to replicate itself and then 

1147
00:52:48,361 --> 00:52:51,421
improve on itself and you'll be able to 
download other people's brains and 

1148
00:52:51,731 --> 00:52:55,150
you'll be able to send your download to 
other people's brands and you'll have an

1149
00:52:55,151 --> 00:53:00,151
experience of what it's like to be that 
person and there's some people that 

1150
00:53:00,151 --> 00:53:00,151
resist this because they say,
look,

1151
00:53:00,151 --> 00:53:03,050
we already right now don't know nearly 
enough about the biological functions of

1152
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:03,700
human body.

1153
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:08,470
We already right now don't know.
I absolutely understand that and I agree

1154
00:53:08,471 --> 00:53:09,500
that they're right.
I,

1155
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:09,880
I,
you know,

1156
00:53:09,881 --> 00:53:14,881
I'm not disputing that at all.
What I am saying though is it might not 

1157
00:53:14,881 --> 00:53:18,541
even matter.
They might be able to come up with 

1158
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:20,110
technology that completely circumvents 
all the biological bullshit that we have

1159
00:53:20,111 --> 00:53:25,111
to deal with as far as like processing 
proteins and vital nutrients and all 

1160
00:53:25,111 --> 00:53:26,040
that horseshit.
We could possibly

1161
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,310
bypass that one day by meshing with 
machines.

1162
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:32,130
I think it's going to happen.
I really do.

1163
00:53:32,131 --> 00:53:34,500
I know you had to.
Aubrey de Grey on your podcast.

1164
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:36,330
I had in my mind,
I'm having them on again,

1165
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,720
I had him on my show,
but I'm having them on the podcast real 

1166
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:41,720
soon.
Yeah,

1167
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,441
because I was talking to him.
He was talking about there are seven 

1168
00:53:45,441 --> 00:53:45,441
different,
I guess a cell.

1169
00:53:45,441 --> 00:53:49,360
There are seven different ways of self 
degenerates and they're working on 

1170
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,370
figuring out ways to stop that 
degeneration.

1171
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:52,300
It's a mechanical issue at this point 
that they're.

1172
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:57,310
They're isolating how cell breaks down,
why it does and they're going to try to 

1173
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,170
figure out a way to stop it,
but you know,

1174
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,760
I said nanotechnology and stuff.
Wow.

1175
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:05,160
There's a chance that all your work 
could be circled circumnavigated by just

1176
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:07,830
that,
that inexorable rise toward,

1177
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:12,831
you know,
just kind of pushing us way beyond our 

1178
00:54:12,831 --> 00:54:12,831
biology with machines.
And he was like,

1179
00:54:12,831 --> 00:54:12,831
yeah,
maybe.

1180
00:54:12,831 --> 00:54:12,831
You know,
I just,

1181
00:54:12,831 --> 00:54:15,800
I think if you look at it in terms of 
the long haul,

1182
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,960
well let's just assume that people are 
able to stay alive and not below each 

1183
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,360
other up or not get hit by a meteor for 
the long haul.

1184
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:28,390
Let's give us a 100 years to have any 
idea how goddamn crazy technology is 

1185
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:34,631
going to be in a hundred years.
So anybody looks at it's pooling is we 

1186
00:54:34,631 --> 00:54:38,351
don't have the capabilities.
Don't you think that that's what they 

1187
00:54:38,351 --> 00:54:41,030
said back when they lived in caves?
How would we got to block that hole?

1188
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:43,550
We can't do it.
We don't know how they had to figure out

1189
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:45,020
how to make a fucking door.
Okay,

1190
00:54:45,021 --> 00:54:47,030
so when you had to figure out how to 
make a door to a cave,

1191
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:52,240
somebody had to figure out fire.
Somebody had to figure out stone tools 

1192
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,270
and then we learned from them.
It all keep steam rolling and apparently

1193
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:58,040
the brain is evolving as well.

1194
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,520
The brain is evolving in the way that it
interfaces with computers.

1195
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:06,670
The way we process information,
it's all directly with our way of the 

1196
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,880
allocation of resources mentally is very
different now than it was before.

1197
00:55:10,881 --> 00:55:14,510
You could just ask Google a question is 
this is some weird.

1198
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,910
Shit's going to happen to the brain 
itself.

1199
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:22,060
If we start adding things to it,
if we start putting in little 

1200
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,370
transmitters or little things,
little little way,

1201
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,760
ways to wireless interface with each 
other,

1202
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:28,040
you know,
you and I've talked about this,

1203
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,610
that experiment that they did where they
sent a word,

1204
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:36,640
they sent a couple of words from one 
person to the other person through the 

1205
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,710
Internet and they received the word.
They were blindfolded.

1206
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:39,440
They,
they,

1207
00:55:39,441 --> 00:55:44,441
they put take all these steps to make 
sure that the way they're receiving it 

1208
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:44,840
was only brain to brain.
Like,

1209
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:45,870
dude,
we're,

1210
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:50,880
we're getting like,
these are the baby steps of some really 

1211
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,330
crazy shit.
If we could just stay alive.

1212
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:55,250
If you can stay alive for like a hundred
years,

1213
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:57,680
the world will be unrecognizable.

1214
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,900
Well,
they say that's the case in 40 or 50.

1215
00:55:59,901 --> 00:56:02,240
Ray Kurzweil says in 40 or 50 years it's
going to be.

1216
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,260
He might be right.
Yeah.

1217
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:08,420
Because it's moving so exponentially and
the minute machine start replicating 

1218
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,030
themselves are building better machines.
Yeah.

1219
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:15,170
Comes with a very dark side,
but also comes from a very promising 

1220
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:15,170
sign.
Just reject it.

1221
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,360
Biologist reject it.
That makes a lot of them do.

1222
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:19,970
But a lot of them do because they think 
that they don't.

1223
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:25,150
We don't know enough about the human 
mind to even come close to saying that 

1224
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:29,641
we could replicate it or download 
consciousness into a computer and that 

1225
00:56:29,641 --> 00:56:32,590
seems to be the truth.
And what I think is it's,

1226
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:37,950
it's going to be the case of technology 
reaching a level of capability that we 

1227
00:56:40,871 --> 00:56:43,630
can't even fathom.
We can't fathom it.

1228
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:49,040
It's.
It's too far away from our little pea 

1229
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,040
brains right now.

1230
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,240
So there could be kind of an interface 
that we can't even imagine.

1231
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,520
I think that they have to,
if you can imagine it,

1232
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,760
I think that human,
the human imagination exists because 

1233
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,930
that is a window into what is actually 
possible.

1234
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:03,150
In other words,
you know,

1235
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:06,880
I think that if you can imagine it,
it's going to be a matter of time before

1236
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:11,380
it actually becomes something you can 
measure and see with your eye,

1237
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:12,700
your ear,
or an instrument.

1238
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,890
I think it's going to be something that 
you can actually touch.

1239
00:57:14,891 --> 00:57:19,891
I think anything that like where you're 
talking about downloading the human 

1240
00:57:19,891 --> 00:57:23,521
brain,
communicating the way we communicate 

1241
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:26,341
with radio waves,
the way we text texting each other with 

1242
00:57:26,341 --> 00:57:26,530
our brains.
I don't think that's magic.

1243
00:57:26,531 --> 00:57:31,531
I don't think it's far fetched.
I think if you look at the way science 

1244
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,350
seems to be developing,
it's a matter of when,

1245
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,030
not if it's so weird.

1246
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:36,250
If you think about what a human being 
is,

1247
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:40,450
if you think about like I've been 
watching nature documentaries lately,

1248
00:57:40,451 --> 00:57:45,451
man had gone through this one of these 
weird stages while I just started 

1249
00:57:45,451 --> 00:57:46,070
watching documentaries on,
you know,

1250
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:51,160
various animals and the just the cruelty
of the environment that they live in,

1251
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:56,350
the cannibalism and the attacking each 
other and life eats life.

1252
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:58,270
Oh,
it's fucking chaos,

1253
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,790
man.
We watched this documentary on baboons.

1254
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,190
These baboons fucking each other up and 
you're like,

1255
00:58:03,191 --> 00:58:08,191
Jesus Christ,
trying to protect their babies in the 

1256
00:58:08,191 --> 00:58:11,760
baboons should the show should have been
called dead baby babble because they 

1257
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,680
showed us like 10 fucking dead baby 
baboons.

1258
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:18,940
This scientist on Ted,
the Ted talk was talking about how 

1259
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,800
humans are not the only animals that 
just kill each other because you know,

1260
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:25,810
because you know the animals kill out of
dominance or our food and stuff,

1261
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,340
and he said,
let me tell you something.

1262
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:32,490
This baboons showed up.
He studies baboons babbling shows up in 

1263
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:32,530
this whole group and he's kind of an 
asshole.

1264
00:58:32,531 --> 00:58:37,531
He's just loud.
He's just not being respectful to the 

1265
00:58:37,531 --> 00:58:37,750
other males.
He just running around because I kind of

1266
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:42,760
tried to fuck the the women without 
going through the necessary baboons 

1267
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,350
steps you got to and he's just loud and 
being a pain in the ass.

1268
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,210
Well,
the next morning he said,

1269
00:58:46,211 --> 00:58:47,020
he said,
he goes,

1270
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:48,640
I knew this bat boom was going to get 
it.

1271
00:58:48,641 --> 00:58:50,950
I just didn't know how.
Next morning he shows the picture.

1272
00:58:50,951 --> 00:58:55,951
All they find is the baboon's face,
the baboon's face basically torn asunder

1273
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:01,710
through whatever,
every direction and just his perfect 

1274
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,871
face going like that.
Just a silent scream was left on the 

1275
00:59:03,871 --> 00:59:04,040
ground.
Whoa.

1276
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:07,510
That's what they do.
Cut His face off his face off with what?

1277
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:08,220
Their teeth?
Yeah,

1278
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:10,930
they just bit his head off.
They've been as head away from his face.

1279
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:14,140
Basically.
You've got some big deals.

1280
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,810
They do.
They have ferocious looking teeth,

1281
00:59:16,811 --> 00:59:17,640
man.
They're.

1282
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,940
They're like a dog fucked a monkey.
Yeah,

1283
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:22,040
that's exactly.
It's really what it's

1284
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,660
like.
It doesn't look like any other animal.

1285
00:59:23,661 --> 00:59:25,850
It's such a weird dog monkey 
combination.

1286
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,040
Shake pet.
They,

1287
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:31,670
if they,
if the baboons was in a movie,

1288
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:34,430
like if they didn't exist,
but they were in like Lord of the rings,

1289
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:39,520
it would be a terrifying animal.
Like an animal that lived in the forest 

1290
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:39,870
that was thinking about like stealing 
your babies.

1291
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,830
You know,
they eat human babies,

1292
00:59:42,831 --> 00:59:45,110
man.
Well my soul champs too,

1293
00:59:45,111 --> 00:59:47,030
by the way.
We throw a birthday party for my,

1294
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:52,060
my,
one of my kids and they brought a 

1295
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:52,060
baboons.
Oh No.

1296
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:52,550
And I was like,
Oh yeah,

1297
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,180
we'll just make it a pattern.
She tends.

1298
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:55,940
She was,
she was a very submissive.

1299
00:59:55,941 --> 00:59:58,190
She would fall to the ground and let you
pick bugs from her back.

1300
00:59:58,191 --> 01:00:00,650
That's how they show submissive 
submission,

1301
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:03,530
but nervous.
She was nervous.

1302
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,750
She had big teeth and she was large.

1303
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:07,090
That's all.
Let's,

1304
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,780
let's keep about 10,
10 yards back.

1305
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:10,280
Fuck that.
Yeah.

1306
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:12,980
Well that's not fair.
That animals shouldn't be there.

1307
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:18,270
Software,
the animal you're putting the animal 

1308
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:20,501
without even understanding its language.
You putting it in this incredible 

1309
01:00:20,501 --> 01:00:24,020
stressful situation where it's around 
kids look at the fucking teeth on that.

1310
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,110
That's a male.
Oh my God.

1311
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:30,500
The monsters.
Just monsters.

1312
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,230
Look at the teeth.
It's like a werewolf.

1313
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:37,490
It is that what it insanely crazy 
looking animal.

1314
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:41,870
Like if that was in a movie and they 
always chasing after Bilbo Baggins,

1315
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:45,110
you would totally buy it.
You'd be like,

1316
01:00:45,111 --> 01:00:46,820
oh my God,
that's a werewolf.

1317
01:00:46,821 --> 01:00:49,070
How is that not a werewolf?
I mean,

1318
01:00:49,071 --> 01:00:54,071
look at the fucking teat on that thing.
Those are stills are giant teeth,

1319
01:00:54,141 --> 01:00:59,141
man.
Those fangs are so disproportionately 

1320
01:00:59,141 --> 01:00:59,141
large.
Yeah.

1321
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:02,180
Do the females have teeth like that?
Probably.

1322
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:03,620
Probably.
Damn.

1323
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:04,280
Look at that thing.

1324
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,820
Jesus Christ color.
Oh my God.

1325
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:09,680
Dude.
Below that picture up.

1326
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:13,350
Look at the fucking face on that thing.
Yeah.

1327
01:01:13,351 --> 01:01:14,210
But look at the,
uh,

1328
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:17,680
female genitalia and the other picture.
And that's what I'm looking at.

1329
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:20,210
Look at that.
That's just retarded.

1330
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:23,480
But with a face to like,
this is real,

1331
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:24,170
like,
okay,

1332
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:29,380
if human beings didn't exist,
if we just didn't exist at all on earth,

1333
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:36,820
this fucking thing would be out there 
just like it is now if we never would 

1334
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:38,930
never existed.
Yeah.

1335
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,360
If we just.
We never figured out houses.

1336
01:01:41,361 --> 01:01:42,140
We never,
we just.

1337
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:47,190
We died off a long fucking time ago.
That thing would be out there just like 

1338
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:50,921
that.
That thing would be out there a million 

1339
01:01:50,921 --> 01:01:50,921
years from now.
Just like that.

1340
01:01:50,921 --> 01:01:55,510
Look at that fucking monster.
I mean we made it to 2015 with cell 

1341
01:01:55,821 --> 01:02:00,821
phones and jet airplanes and microwave 
ovens and tvs and laptops and that 

1342
01:02:01,941 --> 01:02:04,550
fucking primate that came up with us.

1343
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:07,020
This fucker didn't make it out of the 
neighborhood.

1344
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:12,040
That's what they always say is the 
fundamental difference between human 

1345
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:12,040
beings and animals.
Even though we're an animal,

1346
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:16,900
we're the only animal with potential,
with the only animal that continues to 

1347
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,200
evolve.
We evolve within our own lives.

1348
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:18,880
Yeah.
We,

1349
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:23,950
we can see in the future,
you're really observant of yourself and 

1350
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:25,110
correcting of yourself.
You'll continually evolve.

1351
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:30,130
Yeah.
You're going to be smarter and 10 

1352
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:32,271
generations and that baboons,
they're all going to be the same way 

1353
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:35,530
they will have.
That's interesting that you said that 

1354
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:35,530
because I want to keep hate,
keep saying radiolab,

1355
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:40,790
but there was another podcast they did 
about instincts and how you could change

1356
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,180
the entire behavior of a tribe of 
baboons.

1357
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:49,560
If they got rid of this one alpha male.
That was like fucking everybody up.

1358
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:50,430
Really?
Yeah.

1359
01:02:50,431 --> 01:02:51,290
They got rid of twitter.

1360
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:56,390
Yeah.
They got rid of one alpha male that was 

1361
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:56,390
fucking everybody up and then something 
happened.

1362
01:02:56,390 --> 01:03:00,801
I forget what the actual event was that 
caused them to be submissive to each 

1363
01:03:00,961 --> 01:03:05,961
other and grooming each other and then 
they just kind of kept up with it and 

1364
01:03:05,961 --> 01:03:09,411
then they came back years later 
expecting to see the same sort of 

1365
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:10,080
violent behavior that they've witnessed 
before,

1366
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,570
but no,
they had this.

1367
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:15,060
They had developed this like peaceful 
baboons tribe,

1368
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,260
which is.
There is no.

1369
01:03:16,261 --> 01:03:17,530
There was no threat.
What was it?

1370
01:03:17,531 --> 01:03:18,750
A way?
Lesser Threat.

1371
01:03:18,751 --> 01:03:23,751
They're still fucking baboons,
but apparently the way they dealt with 

1372
01:03:23,751 --> 01:03:25,300
each other was way more relaxed like and
they.

1373
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:28,290
That was really confusing to these 
biologists who observed it.

1374
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,000
It was very unexpected,
I should say.

1375
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:32,850
Shouldn't say confusing.
I mean it was a welcomed discovery.

1376
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,890
I'm sure he realizing like,
wow,

1377
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,810
how much of behavior,
okay.

1378
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:40,920
Like we're talking about North Korea and
we're talking about America in 2015.

1379
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:44,730
Look at the difference between the way 
that cultures are allowed to communicate

1380
01:03:44,731 --> 01:03:47,340
and express themselves.
Just by this podcast.

1381
01:03:47,341 --> 01:03:51,840
You could see the difference between 
someone who lives in a crazy,

1382
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:56,070
crazy dictatorship that they're living 
in is happening in the same timeline.

1383
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,420
Yeah,
it's happening right now.

1384
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:02,450
Well,
it goes back to also when you first 

1385
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:02,450
started this podcast about talking about
most people that are great and there's a

1386
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:06,591
couple of assholes.
It takes only a couple of assholes in 

1387
01:04:06,591 --> 01:04:09,501
charge to change the character of an 
entire society to and make people behave

1388
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:13,380
in a very crazy way.
Those baboons changed when you took away

1389
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:18,381
the alpha.
I wonder if North Koreans would be 

1390
01:04:18,381 --> 01:04:19,860
crying for three hours straight if they 
didn't have a fucking alpha male running

1391
01:04:19,861 --> 01:04:22,410
their tribe.
Who is that much of a fucking monster?

1392
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:23,370
Obviously not.

1393
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:28,400
I wish I could remember the exact 
specifics of what caused them to chill 

1394
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,881
out.
Didn't remember too much information in 

1395
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:35,211
my head.
I'm having a real problem with that 

1396
01:04:35,211 --> 01:04:36,501
lately.
I got to regulate the amount of 

1397
01:04:36,501 --> 01:04:37,830
information that's going in my head and 
then go over it with a fine tooth comb.

1398
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:42,390
I think I feel like I'm taking in all 
day way too much data.

1399
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,070
I feel that way too.
Like I forgot.

1400
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:46,680
I can't really remember names and 
specifics.

1401
01:04:46,681 --> 01:04:50,550
I have to start talking in general terms
because I'm afraid I'll make a mistake.

1402
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:55,580
I'm talking really about individual 
stories and individual subjects of news 

1403
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:01,280
especially because I feel like if you 
got online every day and start scouring 

1404
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,841
the news and looking for interesting 
things and seeing the latest video to 

1405
01:05:05,841 --> 01:05:07,380
see the silver back gorilla that slammed
into the cage at the zoo.

1406
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,960
No.
Oh,

1407
01:05:08,961 --> 01:05:10,000
ready?
Tight.

1408
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:11,610
Tighten up your belt.
My favorite day.

1409
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:14,190
There's a little kid that starts doing 
some chest thumps.

1410
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:16,290
No.
Yes she does.

1411
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:19,900
And the silverback ain't hearing it.
Watch this.

1412
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,140
This is fucking crazy dude.
So you see the little kid.

1413
01:05:23,141 --> 01:05:28,141
You could see her in the corner.
She's pounding are her hands on her 

1414
01:05:28,141 --> 01:05:30,541
chest and this why we never fixed that.
The shitty video quality thing.

1415
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,380
Those little things we bought didn't fix
it.

1416
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:37,420
Okay.
Coco the gorilla with Robin Williams.

1417
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:41,110
We still have that really super shaky 
video for some reason.

1418
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:42,340
Yeah.
Coco the gorilla.

1419
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:45,100
I can't believe he let that thing touch 
them.

1420
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:50,700
They're a lot less dangerous than a.
They say gorillas have their own 

1421
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:50,700
personality,
so some can be really mean.

1422
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,990
It's not going to be really sweet.
She was super sweet,

1423
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:56,110
but if she wanted to just pull your dick
off stuff at through your eyeball.

1424
01:05:56,950 --> 01:06:00,010
She could anytime she wanted to.
It might be a guy,

1425
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:00,810
isn't it?
Is it?

1426
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,100
I think it's a girl.
How thick.

1427
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Oh Wow.
So he just pulls him down to look at 

1428
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,460
that.
Oh my God.

1429
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:12,160
Can you go full screen on that or is 
that when screws up.

1430
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:15,240
Oh,
good God.

1431
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,740
Well that's like an alien dude.
You know?

1432
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:20,260
Look at that.
Wow kisses his hand.

1433
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:24,040
Oh Shit.
This is an amazing time.

1434
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:29,130
This is a bizarre video.
I guess I wouldn't be so nervous that 

1435
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:31,050
things really peaceful.
Look at him.

1436
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:36,330
Wow.
It took his glasses and put his glasses 

1437
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:36,330
on.
Whoa.

1438
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:38,290
See that's when it gets really weird.
Nigo what?

1439
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:40,060
What do you mean?
What are we dealing with here?

1440
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:45,330
This is like a life form that speaks a 
some sort of a sign language with human 

1441
01:06:46,721 --> 01:06:48,580
beings so it understands what you're 
saying.

1442
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:53,680
It just can't vocalize the noises that 
we wanted to in order to communicate,

1443
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,540
but man,
that is a crazy animal right there.

1444
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:01,420
If that thing didn't exist,
fuck big foot.

1445
01:07:01,421 --> 01:07:02,980
I'll just say it right now.
Fuck.

1446
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:06,510
Big Foot and his dirty crusty ass.
Big flips.

1447
01:07:06,511 --> 01:07:08,890
Not nearly as cool as a Goddamn St.
tickle me.

1448
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:13,420
You're going to take all the girl isn't 
a Nazi signs.

1449
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,000
Tickle guys want to see stronger.
That thing is to me.

1450
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,560
Oh,
what are you talking about?

1451
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:20,080
You can't even fathom it at a different 
level.

1452
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,090
It's not even the same.
It's just not fair.

1453
01:07:22,091 --> 01:07:24,460
It's like how much stronger you then a 
flower.

1454
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,570
Well,
how about just Brennan?

1455
01:07:25,571 --> 01:07:28,840
Who grabbed me around the waist the 
other day and he was like yesterday.

1456
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:29,730
I was trying to get out.
First of all,

1457
01:07:29,731 --> 01:07:31,690
I try to shoot a single leg on him.
Look at that.

1458
01:07:31,691 --> 01:07:32,230
No,
keep it.

1459
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:35,290
Give it to look at this.
This is so crazy.

1460
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:38,890
It's just looking at that body.
Get them laughing.

1461
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:39,730
It's so.

1462
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,870
It's nuts that each other with great 
pet.

1463
01:07:43,871 --> 01:07:48,871
You're hilarious.
Stupid gorilla in your house until he 

1464
01:07:48,871 --> 01:07:52,111
decides that he wants to eat your food.
Right now they actually are a strict 

1465
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:54,520
vegetarians.
Which people find a shocking.

1466
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,800
Yeah,
there and people are like,

1467
01:07:56,801 --> 01:08:01,801
hey man,
this is totally evidence that you can 

1468
01:08:01,801 --> 01:08:06,781
eat in all plant diet and you can be 
immensely massive muscular or it's 

1469
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:11,170
evidenced that gorillas are different 
than people.

1470
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:12,640
They always say,
well,

1471
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:14,740
both are so strong and their total 
vegetarians.

1472
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:17,180
Go eat grass and then run a mile.
See how you feel.

1473
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,010
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

1474
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:20,900
You have four stomachs.
Whatever the fuck it is.

1475
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:22,670
Yeah.
We're different men.

1476
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:25,020
That's a gorilla to different than a 
person doesn't.

1477
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,890
It needs only Broccoli.
Coco checks his ID.

1478
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:31,640
That is hilarious.
Science tickles.

1479
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:36,560
I went to the Santa Barbara Zoo like 
maybe six months ago or so,

1480
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:41,490
and they have gorillas there and uh,
you just get right up next to him in the

1481
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:44,970
glass and you look in and you see them 
walking around and they're,

1482
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:50,010
you know,
they're essentially just a few yards 

1483
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:50,270
from you just right there walking 
around.

1484
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,600
It's kind of fucked up in San Diego.
Santa Barbara.

1485
01:08:53,601 --> 01:08:58,601
Yeah.
It's kind of fucked up because you 

1486
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,281
really shouldn't be able to just look at
a gorilla because if you just look at 

1487
01:09:00,281 --> 01:09:00,800
them in real life,
they run at you,

1488
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:06,310
they'd make them.
You ever seen that bluff charge they 

1489
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:06,610
make that is pull a video of that 
terrorism.

1490
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,680
Makes Silver.
Black silverback.

1491
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:13,780
Makes Bluff charge.
Do we figure out why this is so crammed 

1492
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:14,690
the shape?
D glass after?

1493
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,560
Yeah.
Here he goes.

1494
01:09:15,561 --> 01:09:20,561
Look at this boom day.
Do you have any idea how fucking strong 

1495
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:25,970
he must be a south.
And that was just because she was on her

1496
01:09:25,971 --> 01:09:30,971
chest and then nuts,
man gets charged by Ma.

1497
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:34,520
What does that say?
Gorilla those second one down?

1498
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:39,940
Is that the one that.
I think one of the largest silver back 

1499
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:39,940
500 pounds.
Try that one.

1500
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:42,950
Bluff,
charge 500 pounds silver,

1501
01:09:42,951 --> 01:09:45,110
but we'll get the belly to belly.

1502
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:46,280
That's parasites,
Bro.

1503
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,690
Is that what that is?
I don't know,

1504
01:09:47,691 --> 01:09:50,060
but that's a crazy belly.
I'm disgusted and ashamed.

1505
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:53,450
Do you think that gorilla cares about 
his gut?

1506
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:56,810
I don't freak them out.
Is that a girl you think or a guy?

1507
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:02,360
Um,
I think it's a guy that looked very 

1508
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:02,360
girl,
like for some reason,

1509
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:02,630
like maybe she was pregnant.
Oh,

1510
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:03,860
maybe she was.
Yeah.

1511
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:05,840
I feel like that's probably the silver 
back.

1512
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:08,270
That's probably why the silver box going
to bum rush the show.

1513
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:11,450
That is the silver.
You imagine these assholes are actually,

1514
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:15,230
I say assholes with all due affection 
and admiration,

1515
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:18,830
but these dudes are in the middle of the
fucking jungle.

1516
01:10:18,831 --> 01:10:22,730
Just walking around with cameras in 
front of wild gorillas.

1517
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:26,300
Not to mention there a bunch of really 
bad people in the Rwandan juggles.

1518
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:29,000
I think Joseph Kony hangs out there 
sometimes.

1519
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:33,970
Yeah.
And his Hutu militia is what?

1520
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:38,990
A freaking animal.
A gorilla is super intelligent thing.

1521
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,820
It's enormous.
Possibly strong.

1522
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:46,040
Just strong eats vegetation and is so 
strong,

1523
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:50,480
it could just rip you apart with the 
hands and that's how it gets by.

1524
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:54,080
It gets by,
not by killing everything around it gets

1525
01:10:54,081 --> 01:10:59,081
by,
by being able to kill so many things 

1526
01:10:59,081 --> 01:11:01,190
that everybody just goes fuck that.
That's why they nest on the ground.

1527
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:02,760
It's unbelievable gorillas.
They could,

1528
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:04,730
if a gorilla wanted to pull himself up a
tree,

1529
01:11:04,731 --> 01:11:09,731
it would be pretty fucking easy.
But they don't nest in trees and proud 

1530
01:11:09,731 --> 01:11:09,731
of it.
I'm sure that's a great.

1531
01:11:09,731 --> 01:11:11,090
That's a pregnant girl.
Is pregnant part of it.

1532
01:11:11,091 --> 01:11:13,170
Um,
because she looks like a female looks.

1533
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,290
She's because I'm a biologist.
I don't know if you know,

1534
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,080
she just looks less horrifically strong 
than the male is.

1535
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,960
She's more like soft and fuzzy.
I didn't.

1536
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,460
They find out originally they used 
tools.

1537
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:31,980
They definitely like will dig with 
sticks to dig,

1538
01:11:31,981 --> 01:11:33,170
to get roots and shit.
No,

1539
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:34,680
they're all,
they all vegetation.

1540
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:37,230
That's what they,
they're all about vegetation.

1541
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:43,220
I'm sure that they have probably figured
out some sort of tool to do something 

1542
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:46,650
and we just make sense man.
I mean,

1543
01:11:46,651 --> 01:11:48,520
it's not like they're building the 
wheel,

1544
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:53,010
constructing houses.
I think it's still food to a bear.

1545
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:57,210
Look at the size of grizzly bears,
size of that thing.

1546
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:00,270
I don't know about all that.
Five hundred pounds.

1547
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:02,040
How much do they weigh?
A lot more.

1548
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:05,160
A lot more,
but it's a different kind of weight,

1549
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:07,110
is it?
Yeah.

1550
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,030
I mean,
no grizzly bears are ridiculous.

1551
01:12:09,031 --> 01:12:14,031
Strong animal,
but a fucking big five slash 600 pound 

1552
01:12:14,491 --> 01:12:18,600
gorilla.
He might fuck a grizzly bear up.

1553
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:20,820
He might smack a grizzly bear and his 
head,

1554
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:23,790
grizzly bear might be stupid to tangle 
with this thing.

1555
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:26,520
Hard to hurt.
He looks like his head was well.

1556
01:12:26,521 --> 01:12:29,700
The grizzly bears are impossible to her.
He ever seen them fight each other.

1557
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:31,970
It's insane.
So what's the bear going to do it?

1558
01:12:31,971 --> 01:12:33,240
Unless he knows the Jujitsu,
he's kind of.

1559
01:12:33,241 --> 01:12:35,270
I mean the girls got to get behind them 
and choke them with the grill.

1560
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,680
Going to do the grills.
Going to just smack them in the head.

1561
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:40,710
Just pound them,
bite and throw them.

1562
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:46,160
Maybe freak the fucking bear out into 
thinking that this thing is way scarier 

1563
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,670
though a bear.
Yeah,

1564
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:53,120
but as far as if they went to the death,
depends on how big the barriers and how 

1565
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:53,460
big the gorillas.
Oh,

1566
01:12:53,461 --> 01:12:56,880
guess what?
Those are so fucking smart though.

1567
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:58,890
I would think that they would figure out
a way.

1568
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:01,530
What would you fuck a.
either where they are,

1569
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:07,160
because they're wild too.
I mean the reason why they have those 

1570
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,621
giant canines,
that's the fight they fight other 

1571
01:13:09,621 --> 01:13:09,621
gorillas.

1572
01:13:09,621 --> 01:13:11,460
Yeah.
It's just a matter of does he have like,

1573
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:16,950
like a grizzly bear.
You know what's interesting about the 

1574
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:16,950
way grizzly bears kill?
So we were.

1575
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:21,330
It was really kind of creepy.
It seems that animals that kill a 

1576
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,100
variety of things or animals that eat a 
variety of things,

1577
01:13:23,101 --> 01:13:26,340
I should say a real omnivores which 
bears are real.

1578
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:31,390
I'm no worse.
They don't necessarily kill things 

1579
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:31,390
before they start eating them.
Right.

1580
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:36,410
They just hold them down.
I know there've been a lot of like in 

1581
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:40,010
grizzly man,
I think the guys start getting his legs 

1582
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:40,010
eaten first.
Yeah,

1583
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:42,981
and for like seven minutes the video 
goes on lens caps on what you just 

1584
01:13:42,981 --> 01:13:44,520
hearing the sound of him screaming.
Oh,

1585
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:49,730
and her screaming and this is going on 
for seven fucking eating him alive in 

1586
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,530
Christ and that's how they kill you.
They eat you alive.

1587
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:57,830
Fuck.
That's not at all they want to do is 

1588
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:58,290
hold you because there is so much 
bigger.

1589
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:03,650
There is so much bigger than you.
So the thing has pawned my chest and 

1590
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:06,810
he's just wilson down on my quads.
Mostly your gut or your asshole,

1591
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:08,430
they'll.
They'll go asshole first.

1592
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:14,110
Yeah.
Apparently that's how coyotes kill the 

1593
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:14,110
kill asshole.
First.

1594
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:17,110
A deer like they've found deer that were
locked up together.

1595
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,270
I mean it's like sometimes when deer 
for.

1596
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,370
I know you know this,
they will.

1597
01:14:21,371 --> 01:14:26,371
They're the men are fighting and the men
their horns because they slam heads 

1598
01:14:26,371 --> 01:14:31,081
together.
Sometimes they wedged their horns 

1599
01:14:31,081 --> 01:14:33,841
together in a way that they literally 
can't get out and there's a video of 

1600
01:14:33,841 --> 01:14:38,071
these.
You find this video of these two bucks 

1601
01:14:38,071 --> 01:14:40,650
that are connected together and one of 
them dead because it was eaten alive by 

1602
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:43,870
these coyotes in the coyotes ate it,
asshole first.

1603
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:49,130
So the whole back legs and the haunches 
and the assholes all torn out like they 

1604
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:53,881
ate all of that and,
and this other deer is still connected 

1605
01:14:53,881 --> 01:14:54,820
to him.
Well then he must have been like,

1606
01:14:54,821 --> 01:14:56,080
eat a little more please.
No,

1607
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:56,550
it's,
it's,

1608
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:59,090
it's like that.
But the,

1609
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,660
the,
it's a video and they're,

1610
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:06,460
the actual carcass is still attached to 
the other one.

1611
01:15:06,461 --> 01:15:08,410
Like it's not like that.
It looks awful.

1612
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:13,560
It doesn't look like a full deer.
It looks like the bottom half is 

1613
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,860
halfway.
No,

1614
01:15:14,861 --> 01:15:16,540
that's not it.
No.

1615
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:18,640
I guess you start to see if you could 
find it.

1616
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:23,680
Um,
I forget the exact way it was phrased in

1617
01:15:23,681 --> 01:15:28,681
the title.
Something about a hunter's rescue.

1618
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,030
Buck.
One Dead,

1619
01:15:31,031 --> 01:15:32,950
one alive.
I don't know.

1620
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,780
It might be it.
That's weird.

1621
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:41,070
It might be it so weird.
It's hard to tell God that video looks 

1622
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:41,070
like Shit.

1623
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:43,790
It was wobbly.
Okay.

1624
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:47,050
It's just pictures.
That's why I was like,

1625
01:15:47,051 --> 01:15:49,330
that's ridiculous video ever.
Uh,

1626
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:51,440
that's not it.
The actual one was these two.

1627
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,860
Doesn't matter.
You can find it folks if you've got more

1628
01:15:53,861 --> 01:15:55,120
time than us,
but they,

1629
01:15:55,121 --> 01:15:56,110
um,
they lock horns,

1630
01:15:56,111 --> 01:15:58,030
they get stuck in the coyotes.
Just eat them,

1631
01:15:58,031 --> 01:15:59,920
asshole first.
That's how they do it.

1632
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:04,970
I don't want,
I don't want it to turn me over and eat 

1633
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:06,901
my,
but how about you going to stare and 

1634
01:16:06,901 --> 01:16:08,581
your buddy's eyes while you're connected
together by the head while he's getting 

1635
01:16:08,581 --> 01:16:12,361
his asshole eaten?
You got to wear a fucking stuck because 

1636
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:15,580
coyotes never.
They mean they catch Fonz.

1637
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,830
They never catch a full grown buck like 
that.

1638
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:23,210
A full grown buck,
a big 150 pound animal with giant Horn 

1639
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:23,210
licious.
Coyotes are like,

1640
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:24,050
that's too much work.
Yeah,

1641
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,230
for the most part,
I bet you a diet already.

1642
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:28,420
And then came in here because the other 
one was kicking them away.

1643
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:29,440
They were like,
let's eat this.

1644
01:16:29,441 --> 01:16:34,441
End of wonder doesn't move.
But they're connected together by the 

1645
01:16:34,441 --> 01:16:35,540
head.
I don't know.

1646
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:39,310
Who knows?
Interesting point being.

1647
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:42,160
This is my whole point at the beginning 
of all this nonsense.

1648
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:48,570
I think that the need for separateness,
like the need to defend yourself,

1649
01:16:50,591 --> 01:16:55,591
the need to attack the need for 
aggression was all instilled and 

1650
01:16:56,471 --> 01:17:01,210
whatever animal to human being 
ultimately became all instilled to allow

1651
01:17:01,211 --> 01:17:04,360
it to stay alive through the darkest 
times,

1652
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:07,540
the most primal times.
Because without that aggression,

1653
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:08,950
guess what?
Fuck face.

1654
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:14,110
You're not going to make it to 2015.
If you remove aggression from human 

1655
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:15,350
history were bare food.
We're coyote food.

1656
01:17:15,351 --> 01:17:16,840
We're mountain lion.
Food were,

1657
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:22,030
fill in the blank.
If you remove the need to figure out a 

1658
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:23,990
way to stop the world around you from 
swallowing you up,

1659
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:29,410
you need to have a certain amount of 
personal sovereignty and a certain 

1660
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:29,410
amount of aggression.

1661
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:32,960
You have to fight off anything that is 
predatory.

1662
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:37,961
Anything that has to threaten the 
survival of your very species until you 

1663
01:17:37,961 --> 01:17:42,011
figure out how to get it together.
So go from the beginning when people 

1664
01:17:42,011 --> 01:17:46,241
made the first houses to figuring out 
how to make it gates to keep other 

1665
01:17:46,241 --> 01:17:46,940
people out,
to figuring out how to,

1666
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:52,180
how to keep themselves safe from 
predatory animals and all those steps 

1667
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:53,720
were like super necessary to get to 
today,

1668
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:58,930
but at a certain point in time,
when do we outgrow that expression that 

1669
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:01,970
were so dominant over all the other 
animals?

1670
01:18:01,971 --> 01:18:06,971
We don't have to worry about that 
anymore and the only problem we have 

1671
01:18:06,971 --> 01:18:09,551
with each other,
it seems to be like allocation of 

1672
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:09,551
resources.
I was about to say that's the big one.

1673
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:11,250
You Watch how fast people devolve.
As soon as there's a.

1674
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:15,690
there's a limited source of water and 
you're going in their car or whatever,

1675
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:18,320
may not have enough water for the day.

1676
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:20,180
That's when things get really 
interesting.

1677
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:22,640
It's all a question of this.
What I mean,

1678
01:18:22,641 --> 01:18:26,000
most of most tribes that fought there 
was always that situation.

1679
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:28,940
It was a fight over resources or water 
rights or whatever it might.

1680
01:18:28,941 --> 01:18:33,770
You know that they're pioneering a new,
a desalination plant in San Diego.

1681
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:38,160
They're going to spend some untold 
buckets,

1682
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:40,130
a load of cash.
Yeah,

1683
01:18:40,131 --> 01:18:42,920
and they're going to make this 
desalination plant.

1684
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:48,220
If that's true.
What you want to do is buy real estate 

1685
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:51,761
on Catalina island because it's going to
be a road that leads out to the 

1686
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:51,860
[inaudible].
We're going to dry out the ocean.

1687
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:57,110
People are creeps desalinization.
Once they figured out desalinization,

1688
01:18:57,111 --> 01:19:00,620
we're just going to be sucking the ocean
off every day.

1689
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:03,560
We're just going to be pulling billions 
of gallons.

1690
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:08,710
People are like,
if we don't stop drinking out of the 

1691
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:08,710
ocean,
it will be dry by 20,

1692
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:10,160
75 by 20,
75.

1693
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:15,160
All the water will be in like golf 
courses and bottled water facilities.

1694
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:19,940
There'll be no water in the whole ocean.
Just big dry hole.

1695
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:20,960
Well,
they did that.

1696
01:19:20,961 --> 01:19:25,961
Went to the LLC.
The LLC was the the ecological disaster.

1697
01:19:26,871 --> 01:19:31,871
That was the llc and then it dried up in
Russia and they dried up because people 

1698
01:19:33,051 --> 01:19:34,670
pulled the water out of it.
It just.

1699
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:38,820
It would be a logical disaster for a lot
of reasons and apparently the algae grew

1700
01:19:38,821 --> 01:19:43,821
so much and there's too much hydrogen in
the water and then it is a thousand 

1701
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,750
things and they were siphoning the water
off with dams and rivers and it became a

1702
01:19:45,751 --> 01:19:47,560
disaster.
Dried up articles,

1703
01:19:47,561 --> 01:19:50,120
see eco disaster and saying,
hey,

1704
01:19:50,121 --> 01:19:51,840
go arrow,
arrow,

1705
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:54,330
Arrow,
Arrow,

1706
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:58,250
look out there and you can just see 
boats that are just on dry land.

1707
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:03,251
Huge Ocean liners.
Now these things like how quick does do 

1708
01:20:03,251 --> 01:20:04,010
these things happen?

1709
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:04,910
Like when,
when,

1710
01:20:04,911 --> 01:20:05,960
uh,
see dries up,

1711
01:20:05,961 --> 01:20:08,650
do they get a 10 year window?
Do like,

1712
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:14,090
well,
I think the LLC took about 40 years to 

1713
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:14,090
dry out,
but look at the boats out there that you

1714
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:15,600
still see that was all,
see all of it.

1715
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,890
And,
and because of mismanagement and,

1716
01:20:19,891 --> 01:20:24,891
and,
and using the water irresponsibly for 

1717
01:20:24,891 --> 01:20:24,891
agriculture.
And so damming up parts of it,

1718
01:20:24,891 --> 01:20:29,751
running off parts of it,
they literally got rid of the C and 

1719
01:20:29,751 --> 01:20:31,410
that's,
that's the eco disaster.

1720
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:33,990
So this was all because of human 
engineering?

1721
01:20:33,991 --> 01:20:35,520
Yes.
Oh my God.

1722
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:39,510
So that was a natural sea and human 
engineering lead it to dry up.

1723
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,400
That's.
That's insane.

1724
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,500
Yeah.
It's also very common,

1725
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:48,501
that kind of shortsighted thinking.
But it is also fascinating because 

1726
01:20:48,501 --> 01:20:52,731
you're looking at the underlying 
mechanisms of the very thing we were 

1727
01:20:52,731 --> 01:20:56,211
talking about that this human animal is 
like figuring out all kinds of shit all 

1728
01:20:57,421 --> 01:21:02,070
the time and it has the power to reshape
land now.

1729
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,970
Make areas uninhabitable with an error,
you know,

1730
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,820
or bring them to life with an error.
Right.

1731
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:13,380
The salt and sea,
the salt and sea for like a long time,

1732
01:21:13,381 --> 01:21:18,381
like a couple of decades was this 
amazing spot where people would go on 

1733
01:21:18,381 --> 01:21:23,121
vacation.
They called it like California's 

1734
01:21:23,121 --> 01:21:26,331
Riviera.
There was a seed that they created by 

1735
01:21:26,331 --> 01:21:27,420
opening up the Colorado River.
It was an accident.

1736
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,330
The whole thing was an accident.
Well,

1737
01:21:29,331 --> 01:21:32,520
you know,
so now it's an eco disaster to it is.

1738
01:21:32,610 --> 01:21:37,610
Oh yeah,
now it's horrifically salty and filled 

1739
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:42,111
with runoff from all the agriculture all
across the state and all that shit 

1740
01:21:42,601 --> 01:21:46,890
that's trickling down from up north and 
all the water systems.

1741
01:21:46,891 --> 01:21:51,891
It's going into there a lot of you 
getting runoff from farms and getting 

1742
01:21:51,891 --> 01:21:52,910
all sorts of fish.
That's,

1743
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,270
that's where it is,
man.

1744
01:21:54,271 --> 01:21:57,600
They have millions of fish die off the 
salt and sea.

1745
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:02,640
That's millions.
The Salton Sea has so many dead bones on

1746
01:22:02,641 --> 01:22:06,240
its beaches that its beaches are 
actually dried fish bones.

1747
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:11,310
Wow is beaches.
There's entire beaches that are 

1748
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:14,631
completely covered with white dead fish 
bones and you're walking in it and you 

1749
01:22:15,271 --> 01:22:17,880
don't realize until you look down on 
that gray.

1750
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:22,920
That is all that is.
Fish bones to see that that person's 

1751
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:27,741
walking,
taking footsteps in fish bones that are 

1752
01:22:28,021 --> 01:22:33,021
so plentiful that they looked like sand 
and this is still efficient.

1753
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:38,190
It.
Saddam Hussein was empower in Iraq.

1754
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:39,860
There was an area,
um,

1755
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:42,960
I think in the south of Iraq.
It was in their lives.

1756
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:45,690
People called.
They called the Marsh Arabs who had been

1757
01:22:45,691 --> 01:22:48,770
there for Millennia.
And when he did,

1758
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,160
he found out that a lot of Iranian,
you know,

1759
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,760
a lot of the Iranian forces were using 
it as sort of a hotbed of insurgency and

1760
01:22:56,761 --> 01:22:59,250
also using it for our strategic stuff 
for the Iran,

1761
01:22:59,251 --> 01:22:59,880
Iraq war.

1762
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:05,180
He in one of the greatest ecological 
disasters ever committed by one man 

1763
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:08,740
drained the entire marsh and go,
if you go to pictures,

1764
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:13,741
good pictures of the Marsh Arabs in Iraq
in the seventies and you'll see what it 

1765
01:23:13,741 --> 01:23:13,950
looked like.
They,

1766
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:16,030
they'd been living there for thousands 
of years.

1767
01:23:16,031 --> 01:23:21,031
Thousands.
It goes all the way back to Alexander 

1768
01:23:21,031 --> 01:23:22,861
the Great and he drained it in the 
course of less than a year and burned.

1769
01:23:22,991 --> 01:23:26,170
It gets back to what we were talking 
about when we were,

1770
01:23:26,171 --> 01:23:27,100
um,
in the car.

1771
01:23:27,101 --> 01:23:31,240
We're talking about hardcore history in 
the Mongols at that,

1772
01:23:31,241 --> 01:23:36,241
the way they used to live.
Some people just take things that's a 

1773
01:23:36,241 --> 01:23:39,990
painting though.
Some people just take things to a 

1774
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:44,911
completely different level when it comes
to like aggression and psychotic 

1775
01:23:44,911 --> 01:23:46,780
behavior and it becomes a total game 
changer.

1776
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:51,870
It just like no one knows what to do,
takes hundreds of years to recover from 

1777
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:51,870
what this person does.

1778
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:56,580
Say that the Middle East never really 
recovered from what the Mongols did in 

1779
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:59,420
2012,
2012 slash six or 12 slash 20 or 

1780
01:23:59,420 --> 01:23:59,420
something,
whatever it was,

1781
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:00,940
somewhere in the 1200 they were saying 
about Iraq.

1782
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:05,020
That was one of the big ones at Baghdad 
at one point in time was like one of the

1783
01:24:05,021 --> 01:24:08,350
cultural centers of the world filled 
with intellectuals,

1784
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:13,500
but after the Mongols came to 
description was that the river ran red 

1785
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:17,161
with blood and black with ink,
so all of these scholars who at the time

1786
01:24:17,621 --> 01:24:22,621
like people have this idea of Islam,
especially when it comes to history like

1787
01:24:22,781 --> 01:24:27,781
the history of the world as being just 
like barbaric or very violent group 

1788
01:24:27,781 --> 01:24:29,730
that's willing to kill you because they 
draw their.

1789
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:33,070
Their cartoon character guy was 
obviously.

1790
01:24:33,071 --> 01:24:37,000
There are people like that out there 
that are because of that that believe in

1791
01:24:37,001 --> 01:24:40,090
that.
But if you go back to the history of the

1792
01:24:40,091 --> 01:24:45,091
religion,
like at one point in time they were at 

1793
01:24:45,091 --> 01:24:46,150
the front of the line when it came to 
science and philosophy.

1794
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:51,390
They were at the front of the line and a
lot of people argue that what the 

1795
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:53,920
Mongols did literally changed the age of
the enlightenment for them,

1796
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:55,510
right,
because what it does,

1797
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,120
but it allowed what they did,
the Chinese and the end,

1798
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:03,140
the Middle East,
the allowed the Europeans who are 

1799
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:06,400
nowhere close to as technologically 
advanced as philosophically or even as,

1800
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:07,120
as,
um,

1801
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:09,550
culturally advanced as say the Middle 
East.

1802
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:14,700
It allowed them to gain ground on both 
China and the Middle East because of 

1803
01:25:15,341 --> 01:25:18,310
what the Mongols did to them because 
they destroyed in the course of,

1804
01:25:18,311 --> 01:25:20,470
you know,
over the years just destroyed that.

1805
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:22,960
The centers of their civilization,
their infrastructure,

1806
01:25:22,961 --> 01:25:24,370
their,
their canals for,

1807
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:25,800
uh,
agriculture,

1808
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:30,820
all of their.
Essentially their culture killed their 

1809
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:31,540
best and their brightest.
Yeah,

1810
01:25:31,541 --> 01:25:34,000
it's really amazing how many people were
killed.

1811
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:36,040
When you look at the,
the,

1812
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:39,190
the number that Dan Carlin site to 
somewhere around $50 million.

1813
01:25:39,191 --> 01:25:44,191
They believe God the died within his 
lifetime as a result of the decisions 

1814
01:25:44,191 --> 01:25:47,821
that he made and the orders that he had 
carried out somewhere on 50 million 

1815
01:25:48,071 --> 01:25:49,090
people.
He believed,

1816
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:50,590
you know,
one of the things he ends up,

1817
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:53,750
he ends the thing with saying,
I'm say we will,

1818
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,350
his,
his for the force of his nature,

1819
01:25:56,620 --> 01:26:01,620
the strength of his nature.
He truly believed he was this divine 

1820
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:04,040
spirit who had a mission

1821
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:08,930
to remake the world in his,
in his mind's eye,

1822
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:14,240
like he was the center of the universe 
and everything belonged to him and his 

1823
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,220
legacy.
So what a,

1824
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:18,380
what a,
what a crazy way to think to begin with.

1825
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:21,170
And the fact that it worked and he did 
it all on horseback.

1826
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:26,230
Yeah.
Did it all on horseback and he had an 

1827
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:26,230
amazing ability,
which one of the.

1828
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:27,500
One of the things I found most unique 
about this,

1829
01:26:27,501 --> 01:26:32,501
a narration by Dan Carlin was when he 
was talking about how the guy would win,

1830
01:26:33,471 --> 01:26:35,540
he would find people that were really 
talented,

1831
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:40,541
that were the enemy.
He would recruit them like a guy shot 

1832
01:26:40,541 --> 01:26:41,660
him off of his fucking horse,
shot his horse from under him,

1833
01:26:41,661 --> 01:26:46,661
and then he made him one of his generals
and he named him the Arrow call this Guy

1834
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:47,660
Chubby,
chubby.

1835
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:52,661
The Arrow.
Like the idea that you would take a guy 

1836
01:26:52,661 --> 01:26:55,241
who tried to fucking kill you and shot 
your horse out from under you and then 

1837
01:26:55,241 --> 01:26:55,241
say,
dude,

1838
01:26:55,241 --> 01:26:55,610
you're a pretty fucking good shot.

1839
01:26:55,610 --> 01:27:00,610
You give him some knuckles and you want 
to fucking kill everybody in the world 

1840
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:04,241
together.
Like our item in these guys know I had 

1841
01:27:04,241 --> 01:27:06,410
an orgy together or something.
Did some opium and had a good old time.

1842
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,660
Yeah.
He felt that he could spot talent.

1843
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,730
Well,
he would take people that were.

1844
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:13,130
You would capture people and he would 
find out.

1845
01:27:13,131 --> 01:27:18,131
Does anybody do anything?
Any you motherfuckers have any skills 

1846
01:27:18,131 --> 01:27:18,131
because if you don't have any skills I'm
going to kill you.

1847
01:27:18,131 --> 01:27:19,550
But if you've got some skills,
let me know what you do.

1848
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:20,250
Right.
You know,

1849
01:27:20,270 --> 01:27:25,270
and people would say I'm a surgeon or 
hey I don't whether even surgeons back 

1850
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:28,811
then probably I could have been a.
and how with that you would have been 

1851
01:27:28,811 --> 01:27:28,811
like,
I'm a black belt in Jujitsu.

1852
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:30,200
What's that?
Come roll with me.

1853
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:31,720
I'll show you some shit.
C'Mon.

1854
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:32,740
Survive.

1855
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:33,820
Oh,
I would have to.

1856
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:35,300
That's what I would have to do.
Blood.

1857
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:38,900
Come on when you bitches with Russell,
just get them to see a team.

1858
01:27:38,901 --> 01:27:43,901
Real quick bar.
I bet they knew some shit actually need 

1859
01:27:43,901 --> 01:27:47,810
to think about it like in wrestling,
but do you think it went back as far as 

1860
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:48,410
$1,200?
It had to have.

1861
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:53,650
It had to have been the.
I don't know if much of they talked 

1862
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:56,741
about it because they were so busy 
killing each other with arrows and 

1863
01:27:56,741 --> 01:27:57,560
swords and shit and spears and 
catapults.

1864
01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:00,060
I don't think the wrestling was 
paramount.

1865
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:04,430
You're talking about a group of people 
though that that fought with their hands

1866
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:06,080
up close,
eyeball to eyeball.

1867
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:11,350
Did it and I'm all the guys that we're 
talking about who are coming into your 

1868
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:14,591
village or your town had had plenty of 
experience with that in that space.

1869
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,750
When you're fighting for your life,
when you're really killing somebody,

1870
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:20,600
I'd imagine it it.
It's a very different muscle.

1871
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,870
If you're using very different muscles,
you're using a very different mindset.

1872
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:27,290
So I would imagine they had a lot of 
Marshall Sense.

1873
01:28:27,291 --> 01:28:30,620
They probably were pretty,
pretty good with hand to hand combat.

1874
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,270
Yeah,
they probably knew like.

1875
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:33,410
I mean,
you think about like the,

1876
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:38,300
the early days of martial arts,
there was most certainly a lot of faulty

1877
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:42,620
technique and faulty ideas that they had
not taken the most,

1878
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:47,750
the most effortless path or the most 
technical path.

1879
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:49,420
They hadn't figured it out yet.
Like there's,

1880
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:54,660
there's certainly some evidence that 
indicates that because by the time we 

1881
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:57,860
got like the highest versions of martial
arts in like the fifties and the sixties

1882
01:28:57,861 --> 01:29:02,861
and seventies,
if you really compare some of the top 

1883
01:29:02,861 --> 01:29:04,320
guys to like what's,
what's possible today.

1884
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:06,600
It seems like it's evolved like many,
many,

1885
01:29:06,601 --> 01:29:07,050
many,
many,

1886
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:07,530
many,
many,

1887
01:29:07,531 --> 01:29:08,250
many times.

1888
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:08,800
You know,
like.

1889
01:29:08,990 --> 01:29:11,980
So I think Hector Lombard me down on any
fucking Mongols,

1890
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:17,030
every one that ever walked there 
punching through your fucking stupid 

1891
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:21,080
Mongols.
But those Ruslan providing the cough 

1892
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,410
type dudes does like the same type of 
dude.

1893
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:26,520
It's like that guy's an animal.
Do you see those pictures of him and the

1894
01:29:26,521 --> 01:29:29,160
post fight where he pissed black?
No.

1895
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:31,110
Yes,
he put it on his instagram.

1896
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:33,510
He's doing his urine sample and he 
pissed black.

1897
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:34,670
God.
Yeah,

1898
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,870
him and Lucas.
But I haven't even seen the fight yet.

1899
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:42,110
I got it saved on my dvr on the road.
They went to war apparently is fucking 

1900
01:29:43,081 --> 01:29:45,270
unbelievable fight apparently.
I haven't seen it.

1901
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:47,700
Is this,
was this use Hbo Boxing?

1902
01:29:47,730 --> 01:29:50,100
Oh,
I'm sorry.

1903
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:54,150
Black urine shows.
Real brutality of boxing.

1904
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:57,270
Like look at his instagram.
He's this total is instagram.

1905
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,860
Look at that.
Look at that picture,

1906
01:29:58,861 --> 01:29:59,160
man.

1907
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,480
That's it.
That's on a diet coke.

1908
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:01,710
That's his piss.
What?

1909
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:04,320
Yup.
That's what his urine came out like.

1910
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:07,200
Oh No.
After 12 arounds of.

1911
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:09,930
Whoa.
God Damn it.

1912
01:30:09,931 --> 01:30:10,970
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1913
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:11,820
He's,
he took.

1914
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:16,870
How about that fight with Bradley?
It was the craziest one I've ever seen 

1915
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:16,890
him.
Amazing fight and I think that uh,

1916
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:22,110
that the genetics that come from that 
area from Siberia and from the step and 

1917
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:31,070
Mongols and the genetics of survivors of
hundreds of years,

1918
01:30:31,831 --> 01:30:36,831
thousands of years of oppression and war
and he's like almost a distillation of 

1919
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:41,630
like the strongest,
strongest survive just to be born and 

1920
01:30:41,630 --> 01:30:45,681
lived to maturity.
People don't like that because it seems 

1921
01:30:45,681 --> 01:30:46,380
to like to indicate some sort of cruelty
of nature,

1922
01:30:46,381 --> 01:30:51,381
but I think to really not be objective 
about it is real cruelty because then 

1923
01:30:51,631 --> 01:30:52,500
you're.
If you're not,

1924
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:54,990
if you're not expressing it for what it 
really is,

1925
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:55,250
you're not.

1926
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:59,760
You're not seeing it for what it really 
is and expressing it in an honest way.

1927
01:30:59,761 --> 01:31:02,040
If you're expressing it through an 
ideology,

1928
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:07,370
you doing everybody a massive disservice
because it's pretty obvious that 

1929
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:10,770
aggression was necessary and beneficial 
to get us to here.

1930
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:16,080
I think everybody recognizing that would
help the idea of like,

1931
01:31:16,081 --> 01:31:21,081
okay,
so if we really did need to do certain 

1932
01:31:21,081 --> 01:31:24,110
military actions in order to stop 
certain psychos from,

1933
01:31:24,170 --> 01:31:29,170
from growing and marching forward and 
taking over giant chunks of land just 

1934
01:31:29,170 --> 01:31:33,261
like they have throughout the Mongol 
days and this person and Filipinos and 

1935
01:31:33,261 --> 01:31:37,130
the grain,
there's always been someone that does 

1936
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:37,130
that.
Right?

1937
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:39,710
So you need some sort of defense to hold
that off or we agreed and then anybody 

1938
01:31:39,710 --> 01:31:44,151
who doesn't agree,
then you've got a real Koombaya problem 

1939
01:31:44,151 --> 01:31:44,151
because he got to go,
listen,

1940
01:31:44,151 --> 01:31:46,050
dude,
have you ever seen really crazy people?

1941
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:49,710
Have you ever been around someone who's 
willing to kill you for money,

1942
01:31:49,711 --> 01:31:51,990
for fame,
for women,

1943
01:31:51,991 --> 01:31:54,300
for women,
and for your water?

1944
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:55,690
Water rights.
There's.

1945
01:31:55,691 --> 01:31:58,470
There's people out there that aren't 
playing by the rules.

1946
01:31:58,471 --> 01:32:00,200
You're playing.
Where did you grow up?

1947
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,110
Pasadena.
That's a great place.

1948
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:04,390
Pasadena is a great plant.
The Tar tar steps.

1949
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,160
It's not Istanbul.
You fuck.

1950
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:11,050
It's not in the middle of.
It's on the middle of Baghdad in a place

1951
01:32:11,051 --> 01:32:16,051
that doesn't even have a roof anymore 
because the soldiers blew it off with 

1952
01:32:16,051 --> 01:32:17,440
their robot flying thing.
No changes you.

1953
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,150
Yeah,
of course it does.

1954
01:32:19,151 --> 01:32:24,151
Of course it does.
So anybody that doesn't think you need 

1955
01:32:24,151 --> 01:32:24,850
some sort of military force until that 
is all eradicated.

1956
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:30,030
So that becomes the real question.
You've got to figure out how do you 

1957
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:32,200
eradicate all the shitty pockets of life
on earth.

1958
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:33,730
And I don't mean like eradicate the 
peep.

1959
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:37,750
I mean eradicate the problems that make 
those people shitty and that seems to be

1960
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:38,620
by the way,
because you,

1961
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:42,130
you have to eradicate the problems and 
the way a country,

1962
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:45,940
the institutions that that give rise to 
evil people.

1963
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:50,941
If you have a society that's structured,
if you have institutions that are 

1964
01:32:50,941 --> 01:32:53,620
structured so that the only way to get 
ahead is if you're a bad.

1965
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:58,650
If you're.
If you're an amoral motherfucker that 

1966
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:00,250
then you're going to have people like 
gang gangs con at all.

1967
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,530
Rise to the top.
You can't.

1968
01:33:02,531 --> 01:33:05,140
It's the way society is structured,
you know,

1969
01:33:05,141 --> 01:33:07,360
they always talk about we have to cure 
poverty or whatever.

1970
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:10,390
The United States is powerful because of
its strength of institution.

1971
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:15,900
It's powerful because we have courts 
that mean something because we have 

1972
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:19,801
property rights where you own a house 
and you actually are secure as an 

1973
01:33:19,801 --> 01:33:20,230
American that somebody's not going to 
come in and take your house.

1974
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:25,470
Very few countries share that luxury 
today in 2015 and courts that are 

1975
01:33:26,981 --> 01:33:29,410
objective that just because you have a 
lot of money,

1976
01:33:29,411 --> 01:33:31,090
and I know this is there exceptions to 
this,

1977
01:33:31,091 --> 01:33:32,380
but just because you have a lot of 
money,

1978
01:33:32,381 --> 01:33:34,180
you're getting off for sure.
No,

1979
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:39,420
we have courts where if you have a lot 
of money and you kill somebody and you 

1980
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:39,420
get caught,
you have big problems.

1981
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:40,870
If you're a cop and you're caught on 
video shooting,

1982
01:33:40,871 --> 01:33:43,150
somebody you have big problem with.
Cops don't have a lot of money,

1983
01:33:43,151 --> 01:33:45,940
but rich people have been able to really
finagle systems,

1984
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:51,180
good lawyers.
That is a problem and it certainly is a 

1985
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:53,701
problem,
but not to the extent that it is in so 

1986
01:33:53,701 --> 01:33:55,591
many other countries.
The corruption is not as blatant as it 

1987
01:33:55,591 --> 01:33:55,870
is in so many other countries.
I think there's no denying that.

1988
01:33:55,871 --> 01:33:57,940
I think the real question becomes,
um,

1989
01:33:58,190 --> 01:34:03,190
of,
of one of the customary actions that 

1990
01:34:03,190 --> 01:34:03,190
we've taken.

1991
01:34:03,190 --> 01:34:07,290
Because W,
what I mean by that is if you look at 

1992
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:09,850
people from where we are right now at 
the 21st century,

1993
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:15,030
2015,
and you consider what people were like 

1994
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:18,430
just maybe a 100 years ago,
200 years ago,

1995
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:23,700
like there's never really been a time 
where people have had this method of 

1996
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:27,910
communicating with each other.
So when we used to,

1997
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:33,180
we didn't,
not only do we not know what was going 

1998
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:33,180
on in Japan,
we had no connection to it.

1999
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:38,010
You would read some stuff on paper.
There's a guy from Japan and what's a 

2000
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:41,071
fuck us up?
This is crazy and you would have no 

2001
01:34:41,071 --> 01:34:44,430
connection to those people and you just 
knew there's a people over there just 

2002
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:45,430
just like Lord of the rings,
just like,

2003
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:46,720
you know,
fill in the blank.

2004
01:34:46,721 --> 01:34:48,640
Any war movie from the,
you know,

2005
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:52,590
the mon goals to whatever the Romans,
the,

2006
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:57,710
this idea that you would have this group
of people that was waiting to come over 

2007
01:34:57,710 --> 01:34:58,340
and fuck you up.
That

2008
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:00,380
doesn't really work anymore.
It does.

2009
01:35:00,381 --> 01:35:03,410
Because there's satellites everywhere.
We see everything.

2010
01:35:03,411 --> 01:35:05,240
We send information,
everybody.

2011
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,290
But this has all happened inside of our 
lifetime,

2012
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:12,320
so there's been a change that's taken 
place that I don't think we're really 

2013
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,350
fully aware of yet.
There's this weird connection thing that

2014
01:35:15,351 --> 01:35:20,351
we have to literally,
everybody on the world will also 

2015
01:35:20,351 --> 01:35:23,111
remember that when you had an enemy,
even as far as even in World War II with

2016
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:27,020
the first thing you did was you got your
soldiers to believe that,

2017
01:35:27,021 --> 01:35:29,840
that that enemy they were.
They were subhuman,

2018
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:34,990
they weren't human,
they were subhuman and you see it over 

2019
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:34,990
and over again.
Again,

2020
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:37,520
that's becoming harder and harder to do.
Dan Carlin not to bring it back to him,

2021
01:35:37,521 --> 01:35:42,521
was also talking about how when you 
fought them enemy in world war one and 

2022
01:35:42,521 --> 01:35:46,961
you,
you encountered your first line of 

2023
01:35:46,961 --> 01:35:46,961
Germans or whatever.

2024
01:35:46,961 --> 01:35:49,970
You didn't know how far back that line 
went.

2025
01:35:49,971 --> 01:35:53,930
You didn't know if there are a million 
of them or if there were 100,000

2026
01:35:53,931 --> 01:35:58,931
or 2000.
So you just fought sort of not knowing 

2027
01:35:58,931 --> 01:36:00,500
to not only the effect you're having on 
their,

2028
01:36:00,830 --> 01:36:05,830
on their forward momentum,
but also on their general population to 

2029
01:36:06,561 --> 01:36:11,561
begin with.
Like you were fighting and when they 

2030
01:36:11,561 --> 01:36:11,561
stopped fighting it,
then you find out,

2031
01:36:11,561 --> 01:36:12,260
Holy Shit,
there were a million of them.

2032
01:36:12,261 --> 01:36:14,960
We just fought these guys,
so just think about that.

2033
01:36:14,961 --> 01:36:17,960
Now we know where their regiments are.
We know how far back they go.

2034
01:36:17,961 --> 01:36:19,550
We know exactly how many people there 
are.

2035
01:36:19,551 --> 01:36:22,460
We can plan accordingly and not only 
that we can talk to each other.

2036
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:27,560
That's what was missing was missing was 
the only people that are talking to each

2037
01:36:27,561 --> 01:36:32,561
other with generals.
The generals and presidents were like 

2038
01:36:32,561 --> 01:36:32,690
the only people talking to each other.

2039
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:33,830
Listen Bitch,
we're gonna fuck you up.

2040
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:35,510
Nope,
we're going to fuck you up for God,

2041
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:36,920
Bitch.
God's on our side.

2042
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:40,190
And wars would start because of these 
alliances and they would just,

2043
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:41,630
they would just be like,
well,

2044
01:36:41,631 --> 01:36:46,631
we're going to fight and break this 
alliance and then you'd find out about 

2045
01:36:46,631 --> 01:36:46,631
it as a,
as a citizen,

2046
01:36:46,631 --> 01:36:46,940
you'd be like,
but I'm farming my land.

2047
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:47,500
No,
no.

2048
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:51,650
How the fuck that Japanese got together 
with the Germans and the Italians.

2049
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:53,510
How the fuck did that happen?
Which war?

2050
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,040
World War II.
Like would it be.

2051
01:36:55,110 --> 01:36:56,360
I mean,
I know how it happened,

2052
01:36:56,361 --> 01:36:59,420
but how the fuck if you look at the 
personalities of the different groups of

2053
01:36:59,421 --> 01:37:04,421
people and the languages they speak 
three completely different fucking 

2054
01:37:04,421 --> 01:37:04,850
languages,
three complete,

2055
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:10,090
completely different types of people and
all their dictated had a lot of trade 

2056
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:10,280
and a lot of connection.
I mean,

2057
01:37:10,281 --> 01:37:12,740
but,
but one of the things that the Germans,

2058
01:37:12,741 --> 01:37:16,040
I mean,
Hitler wanted to create an access,

2059
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:21,070
sort of an access to a sort of a new 
world order and he had a great deal of 

2060
01:37:21,070 --> 01:37:21,260
respect for the Japanese.

2061
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:24,380
He considered the Japanese,
the Ariens of the east,

2062
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:29,010
and he had enormous respect for the 
British really areas of the.

2063
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,090
He loved their yellow fever,
Szeto,

2064
01:37:32,091 --> 01:37:34,160
which was the idea that way of the 
warrior.

2065
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:39,400
Japan had been in a low grade war for a 
civil war for really a thousand years.

2066
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:44,771
I mean,
it was just constant battles between 

2067
01:37:44,771 --> 01:37:44,771
Laura feudal shoguns like these,
these,

2068
01:37:44,771 --> 01:37:47,000
these fiefdoms shogun would run 
fiefdoms.

2069
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:49,490
He'd hire mercenaries and they would 
just fight for land.

2070
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:54,700
And that went on for a really 310 years,
about a thousand.

2071
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:58,020
That's why the swordsman and their 
ability,

2072
01:37:58,021 --> 01:38:03,021
they're there,
they were legendary archers and they 

2073
01:38:03,021 --> 01:38:03,540
were just legendary and ferocious.
I mean,

2074
01:38:03,690 --> 01:38:06,660
when the Portuguese were trading with 
them,

2075
01:38:06,661 --> 01:38:11,661
they came back and the first thing they 
said to their European rulers is they 

2076
01:38:11,661 --> 01:38:11,661
said,
hey,

2077
01:38:11,661 --> 01:38:16,520
couple things you don't want them doing,
learning how to sail long distances and 

2078
01:38:16,591 --> 01:38:19,350
learning about a little something we 
call gunpowder.

2079
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:24,590
Don't give them gunpowder.
They are straight up the most ferocious 

2080
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:25,800
group of motherfuckers on the planet.
If they're late for something,

2081
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:30,950
they immediately request to kill 
themselves because they've dishonored 

2082
01:38:30,950 --> 01:38:30,950
their,
their,

2083
01:38:30,950 --> 01:38:32,940
their fanatical to authority.
And you know,

2084
01:38:32,941 --> 01:38:33,450
that,
that,

2085
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,760
that Plu,
this tiny island took up,

2086
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:38,570
took over a great deal of the world.
Um,

2087
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:39,210
they,
they,

2088
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:44,240
there,
they were insanely warlike and 

2089
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:44,240
impossibly disciplined

2090
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:48,500
and their version of martial arts.
So this day is being taught.

2091
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:50,720
I mean,
once you understand all the,

2092
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:54,050
like Leo Machida who lost this weekend,
but still,

2093
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:59,240
you know,
a great all time fighter and he's an 

2094
01:38:59,240 --> 01:38:59,270
amazing martial artist and his styles 
showed,

2095
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:00,060
oh,
con based.

2096
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:03,850
It's based on that style is another two 
dozen Japanese mentioned.

2097
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:08,720
So really Jujitsu is as well,
I mean Brazilian Jujitsu was modified by

2098
01:39:08,721 --> 01:39:11,530
the gracies,
modified by Helio and,

2099
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:16,570
and Carlos Carlos,
they modified it in turned Jujitsu into 

2100
01:39:16,570 --> 01:39:21,431
what it would ultimately become.
They spent much more time on the ground 

2101
01:39:21,431 --> 01:39:24,701
fighting then the judoka cause.
But a lot of the judo cause even like a 

2102
01:39:24,701 --> 01:39:28,391
lot of their techniques came from,
there was an infusion of techniques 

2103
01:39:28,391 --> 01:39:33,041
where there's some sort of a blurry 
crossroads between catch wrestling and 

2104
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:35,840
judo and some catch wrestlers.
I'm also taught in Japan,

2105
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:41,050
like Karl gotch and Billy Robinson,
those guys taught a lot of people in 

2106
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:44,681
Japan,
like Sakharova was a student of catch 

2107
01:39:44,681 --> 01:39:44,681
wrestling.

2108
01:39:44,681 --> 01:39:45,090
And so he imparted that like sort of,
uh,

2109
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:50,100
a lot of catch wrestling,
submission holds that style of 

2110
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:54,341
attacking.
He incorporated that in a lot of MMA 

2111
01:39:54,341 --> 01:39:55,190
fights and started a lot of people,
not just in Japan but all over the world

2112
01:39:55,430 --> 01:39:57,590
fighting that style.
So I think there's like,

2113
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:02,480
there's many different versions of what 
Japan has brought out to the rest of the

2114
01:40:02,481 --> 01:40:04,010
world.
There's many different versions.

2115
01:40:04,011 --> 01:40:08,240
But as far as like martial arts,
it's one of the biggest contributors.

2116
01:40:08,241 --> 01:40:11,480
Like ever,
they just figured out I quito,

2117
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:16,540
they figured out judo that figured out 
Jujitsu and figured out submissions in a

2118
01:40:16,581 --> 01:40:20,270
way that you really can't find parallel 
at the time.

2119
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:25,330
I definitely think that the Jujitsu is 
better now than ever before and I think 

2120
01:40:25,330 --> 01:40:29,050
I credit that to the Brazilians.
I credit that to the gracies in Brazil 

2121
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:33,701
to this day still has a huge number of 
super high level Jujitsu guys worldwide.

2122
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:37,490
It's evening out way more than it ever 
has before,

2123
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:42,640
but I mean just the overall output and 
the origins of it in the fact that it's 

2124
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:44,250
still called Brazilian Jujitsu.
Everybody calls a Bjj for a reason.

2125
01:40:44,251 --> 01:40:44,800
Yep.
You know,

2126
01:40:44,810 --> 01:40:45,460
they,
they,

2127
01:40:45,461 --> 01:40:50,461
they deserve all the credit.
And then there's still guys like Jocko 

2128
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:53,311
ray with jock already did this weekend 
and Chris Kamozi that armbar setup that 

2129
01:40:53,311 --> 01:40:54,380
transition,
like it's such a hero magician,

2130
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:55,510
artistic,
artistic.

2131
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:59,140
It was one of the most spectacular forms
of,

2132
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:04,360
of like a submission of applying a 
submission in a scramble that I've ever 

2133
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:04,360
seen.
Me Too.

2134
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:05,440
I was just,
I didn't even know that he's doing.

2135
01:41:05,450 --> 01:41:06,430
And what,
um,

2136
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:09,160
how do you defend against that?
You can't defend against that.

2137
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:14,230
He's an artist.
I was going to put it on my twitter 

2138
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:14,500
feed.
I'll re a retweet it earlier today,

2139
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:18,670
but I think grappling world on twitter,
I think that's the ones who put it up.

2140
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:19,940
It's uh,
they,

2141
01:41:19,941 --> 01:41:24,730
they put up a little 15 second gif.
I guess it is.

2142
01:41:24,731 --> 01:41:27,160
Whatever it is on instagram and you get 
to watch it.

2143
01:41:27,161 --> 01:41:28,060
It's,
it's insane.

2144
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:30,460
He's so good.
He's so God damn good.

2145
01:41:30,461 --> 01:41:35,461
It makes you wonder though,
like with the Japanese going back to 

2146
01:41:35,461 --> 01:41:36,910
them how good they were at as swordsmen,
like what they could've done.

2147
01:41:36,911 --> 01:41:38,740
The Samurai.
So that's again,

2148
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:40,630
I think what we were talking about,
what the Mongols like,

2149
01:41:40,631 --> 01:41:45,631
they spent so much time on weapons 
because that's how you fought most of 

2150
01:41:45,881 --> 01:41:50,881
the time.
Like how much time are they really 

2151
01:41:50,881 --> 01:41:50,881
spending on learning how to kick people 
in the face?

2152
01:41:50,881 --> 01:41:55,191
Yeah.
It's probably like a lot of what we 

2153
01:41:55,191 --> 01:41:58,531
think about the way people used to kick 
and punch and it's based on movie 

2154
01:41:58,531 --> 01:42:03,151
depictions of it and in movies like 
enter the dragon or in these kind of 

2155
01:42:03,151 --> 01:42:03,170
crazy movies there.

2156
01:42:03,170 --> 01:42:05,860
They're trying to do the most impressive
stuff so they're throwing.

2157
01:42:05,861 --> 01:42:10,861
We'll kicks and jumping,
roundhouse kicks and jumping side kicks 

2158
01:42:10,861 --> 01:42:14,670
butt in real combat.
Like Bruce Lee wrote very extensively 

2159
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:17,851
about real combat situations.
Like he was always like completely 

2160
01:42:17,851 --> 01:42:21,490
fascinated by the concept of utilizing 
minimum effort,

2161
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,970
incorporating all the best techniques 
from all different martial arts and only

2162
01:42:24,971 --> 01:42:28,000
doing what's effective in discarding 
what's useless.

2163
01:42:28,001 --> 01:42:28,810
And He,
you know,

2164
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:32,770
the Tao of Jeet Kune Doe he wrote like 
extensively,

2165
01:42:32,771 --> 01:42:37,771
but all sorts of different martial arts 
even like lifted whole packages like 

2166
01:42:37,771 --> 01:42:41,701
paragraphs from other martial arts books
and put them in there and people will 

2167
01:42:41,701 --> 01:42:41,701
say like,
oh,

2168
01:42:41,701 --> 01:42:41,701
he's plagiarizing.
Well,

2169
01:42:41,701 --> 01:42:41,701
no,
no,

2170
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:44,080
no.
This is what he was doing was collecting

2171
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:49,081
all the information.
Now whether he attributed it to this 

2172
01:42:49,081 --> 01:42:49,200
book or it should have or I don't know.
Yeah,

2173
01:42:49,210 --> 01:42:52,960
I agree intellectually probably it's not
the most honest thing to do.

2174
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:54,940
To not credit,
maybe he did credit,

2175
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:59,410
but my point is what his art was,
was absorbing everything.

2176
01:42:59,411 --> 01:43:04,411
He didn't invent any new techniques,
but what he did was he took the best 

2177
01:43:04,411 --> 01:43:08,461
stuff out of everywhere and he 
incorporated a system based on his 

2178
01:43:08,461 --> 01:43:12,841
knowledge at the time who took in judo 
from Jean lift arm bars and I don't like

2179
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:16,180
the way you're talking about him in the 
past tense.

2180
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:18,920
He suggested there's dead person's dead 
brother.

2181
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:23,110
I guess you haven't read the secret 
history of a lot of these.

2182
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:27,280
Yeah,
but my point was that like that guy,

2183
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:30,920
what he had done is really kind of,
um,

2184
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:36,060
not just unprecedented,
but he was like the first big blip of 

2185
01:43:36,161 --> 01:43:41,161
this new concept,
this new concept of just do what you 

2186
01:43:41,161 --> 01:43:41,950
want,
what was possible and do what's useful.

2187
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:46,450
Everybody else before was in a tribe.
I was in the shadow con karate tribe.

2188
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:47,560
You're in the,
you know,

2189
01:43:47,561 --> 01:43:52,561
Gung Fu tribe.
This guy's in the judo tribe and there 

2190
01:43:52,561 --> 01:43:53,540
was very little exchanging of 
information.

2191
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:54,500
You know,
I,

2192
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:59,590
I only started exchanging information 
when I got started getting involved in 

2193
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:00,470
kickboxing because I didn't have good 
boxing technique,

2194
01:44:00,650 --> 01:44:05,650
so I started working at a boxing gym and
then I started hanging out with a dude 

2195
01:44:05,650 --> 01:44:08,230
who's doing some Moitai as well,
and then I started learning about like 

2196
01:44:08,230 --> 01:44:08,810
leg kicks and all these different things
and I remember thinking,

2197
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:10,490
God damn,
I was so wrong.

2198
01:44:10,670 --> 01:44:13,550
Like the camp of taekwondo was good for 
a bunch of things,

2199
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,150
but it wasn't good for any of these 
things these guys were doing to me.

2200
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:16,850
I'm like,
dammit,

2201
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:22,300
there's some holes in this motherfucker 
and that's the only way you would find 

2202
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:25,451
out.
The only way you would find out is by 

2203
01:44:25,451 --> 01:44:25,451
exploring these other martial arts.

2204
01:44:25,451 --> 01:44:27,470
But until Bruce Lee came along,
that was taboo.

2205
01:44:27,471 --> 01:44:30,890
You were a trader.
If you went to a different gym to train,

2206
01:44:30,891 --> 01:44:33,590
you are a fucking trader.
I know.

2207
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:36,200
I remember having been a wrestler and 
then I went to Iowa,

2208
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:38,510
Dan Gables camp for,
I think it was two weeks.

2209
01:44:38,511 --> 01:44:41,670
It was a nightmare and three weeks and 
you know,

2210
01:44:41,770 --> 01:44:45,620
and I got to wrestle with some of that.
Those Ncaa like Jim's Alaska,

2211
01:44:45,621 --> 01:44:46,090
those,
those,

2212
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:50,700
those hawkeyes as like as a 17 year old 
and having wrestled I,

2213
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:55,710
I kind of,
I knew I had a real appreciation for 

2214
01:44:55,710 --> 01:44:55,880
what are really good [inaudible] college
wrestler was about,

2215
01:44:55,881 --> 01:44:59,120
you know,
and not because not because I ever.

2216
01:44:59,121 --> 01:45:01,720
I rolled around with those guys but not 
because I was just hit,

2217
01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:03,560
they were teaching us,
but I knew,

2218
01:45:03,561 --> 01:45:08,561
I knew what tough high school wrestlers 
were like and then to think about don 

2219
01:45:08,561 --> 01:45:12,800
wrestlers and then I started taking 
taekwondo when I went to Washington dc 

2220
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:13,520
and I say someone of my friends,
I'd be like,

2221
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:18,580
just know that if you're in a bar and 
you see a dude with closed up here and 

2222
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:20,270
he looks like he wrestled in college,
that's the guy to be afraid of it.

2223
01:45:20,290 --> 01:45:22,120
I'm a beer.
Buy Him a beer man.

2224
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:24,590
Buy Him a beer because even if you punch
him,

2225
01:45:24,850 --> 01:45:25,460
punch them.
Right.

2226
01:45:25,461 --> 01:45:27,260
I may have gone.
I love knowing.

2227
01:45:27,261 --> 01:45:32,261
I was like,
I don't know if my kicks are going to 

2228
01:45:32,261 --> 01:45:32,261
work.
He has to do with it.

2229
01:45:32,261 --> 01:45:32,540
In a way,
it's kind of what we're talking about.

2230
01:45:32,541 --> 01:45:37,541
We were talking about the Mongols were 
the mongols lived this life of constant 

2231
01:45:37,611 --> 01:45:42,611
strain and effort and they were so 
strong and the strong survive anyway,

2232
01:45:44,311 --> 01:45:46,520
like as far as like how many people 
lived in tents?

2233
01:45:46,521 --> 01:45:51,521
Man,
these motherfuckers were constantly at 

2234
01:45:51,521 --> 01:45:51,590
war.
I'm sure their genes that with what they

2235
01:45:51,591 --> 01:45:56,591
had was warrior genetics and those 
people when they encountered regular 

2236
01:45:56,991 --> 01:46:00,470
soft people that lived inside these 
cities like they were,

2237
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:02,720
they were like predators to them.
I mean they,

2238
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:04,680
they,
they had disdain for these people,

2239
01:46:04,681 --> 01:46:09,681
like they were sheep,
like they were cattle because they were 

2240
01:46:09,681 --> 01:46:09,681
so fucking strong.

2241
01:46:09,681 --> 01:46:14,310
I mean,
when you're dealing with a guy who's 

2242
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:14,310
goddamn amateur wrestler,
a serious competitive amateur wrestler,

2243
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:17,020
you're dealing with acute has probably 
been wrestling since he was a bay.

2244
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:19,500
It's all reaction for him.
Everything's reaction.

2245
01:46:19,501 --> 01:46:24,501
Not only that his body has developed by 
throwing bodies around dented and much 

2246
01:46:25,641 --> 01:46:29,380
like you can't understand what it's like
to lock up with that gorilla you.

2247
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:33,980
You can understand how much stronger a 
division one wrestler is the new.

2248
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:35,320
You really don't know.
No.

2249
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:40,360
Like you really probably have no.
Unless you ever wrestled with one of 

2250
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:41,240
those dudes and it has them grab,
grab them,

2251
01:46:41,241 --> 01:46:43,790
grab a hold your wrists and pin you down
and,

2252
01:46:43,810 --> 01:46:45,860
and get out of submissions like it's 
nothing.

2253
01:46:45,861 --> 01:46:50,480
Or you feel their posture power there 
like several times stronger than times.

2254
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:52,920
That's right.
If you get a guy who's like,

2255
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:54,480
look,
here's a perfect example,

2256
01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:56,190
Habib Neuroma gamete off.

2257
01:46:56,520 --> 01:47:01,520
Okay.
That motherfucker's a world samba 

2258
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:01,520
champion.
It's a different kind of wrestling,

2259
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:03,870
but the point is he uses all wrestling.
If you watch him fight,

2260
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:08,460
he's a relentless grappler and when he 
gets a hold of dudes,

2261
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:13,600
they were shocked at how fucking strong 
I rewatched that does Tanya's fight and 

2262
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:18,471
the way he was,
the science is a monster monster and he 

2263
01:47:18,471 --> 01:47:18,471
was just.
He was like a,

2264
01:47:18,471 --> 01:47:20,250
like an octopus,
just like a fucking,

2265
01:47:20,251 --> 01:47:22,590
just wouldn't get off his back.
He's a motherfucker to it.

2266
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,600
Any motherfuckers,
everybody like that.

2267
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:26,130
He motherfuckers,
everybody liked.

2268
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:30,210
I'm so excited about this fight with 
cowboy because I really want to see what

2269
01:47:30,211 --> 01:47:35,211
cowboy does to stop him and I really 
want to see how he does with cowboy 

2270
01:47:35,211 --> 01:47:39,530
fighting.
Cowboy on top because cowboys guard is 

2271
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:39,530
fucking nasty.
No,

2272
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:43,500
I don't.
I don't think we've ever seen anybody 

2273
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,411
threatened Habib with any sort of 
submission attempts before and I wonder 

2274
01:47:45,411 --> 01:47:47,070
what would happen in Dos Anjos didn't 
get a chance man,

2275
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:49,380
but dos Anjos has never been like a 
guard player.

2276
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:51,330
You know,
he's not a big time guard player is more

2277
01:47:51,331 --> 01:47:53,220
of a top smash you guys.
Yeah,

2278
01:47:53,221 --> 01:47:55,620
he's really good man.
He's so God damn good.

2279
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:58,040
Like what he did to pettis was like,
yeah,

2280
01:47:58,530 --> 01:48:01,650
that mother strong too.
He's strong.

2281
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:04,980
Aggressive.
But with Donald and cubby.

2282
01:48:04,981 --> 01:48:06,840
But I wonder if.
First of all,

2283
01:48:06,841 --> 01:48:08,340
I think Donald has better hands and 
feet.

2284
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:09,540
Well,
he definitely does.

2285
01:48:09,541 --> 01:48:11,070
Yeah.
He definitely is a better striker,

2286
01:48:11,071 --> 01:48:15,000
but Habib is just so much stronger when 
it comes to grappling.

2287
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:20,390
But Donald,
unlike the other guys is dangerous off 

2288
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:21,620
his back.
Donald has a nasty triangle.

2289
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:23,220
Sounds throws down.
Yes he is.

2290
01:48:23,221 --> 01:48:25,740
He's a long.
He's got an awesome check.

2291
01:48:25,741 --> 01:48:27,480
Need.
The body throws that check knee with the

2292
01:48:27,481 --> 01:48:29,430
left side.
He fucks guys up and he,

2293
01:48:29,450 --> 01:48:32,370
he mirrors it a lot of times or hides it
behind punches.

2294
01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:33,630
Like Donald,
you'll see,

2295
01:48:33,631 --> 01:48:36,210
we'll throw punches where he's not even 
intended to hit you.

2296
01:48:36,450 --> 01:48:40,280
He just getting you look at these and if
you think of moving in and then boom,

2297
01:48:40,290 --> 01:48:43,260
that need comes to the body.
He fucks guys up with that.

2298
01:48:43,261 --> 01:48:45,900
He's putting on a show for you.
Manage dancing like a cobra.

2299
01:48:46,230 --> 01:48:51,230
Know he hides,
kicks behind punches like he did that 

2300
01:48:51,230 --> 01:48:51,230
when he fought.
Um,

2301
01:48:51,230 --> 01:48:54,300
Jim Miller,
he showed him the right hand and boom,

2302
01:48:54,301 --> 01:48:56,400
the net kick was right behind it.
You know,

2303
01:48:56,450 --> 01:48:59,280
you're looking at that right hand and 
his fucking neck kit comes along,

2304
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:01,230
Bang,
and your legs go out.

2305
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:04,110
He's a cubby and this is going to be 
crazy.

2306
01:49:04,111 --> 01:49:09,111
He's a motherfucker.
Motherfuckers Donald's a motherfucker 

2307
01:49:09,111 --> 01:49:13,011
and Habib's a motherfucker that isn't a 
mate that could be easily a world 

2308
01:49:13,011 --> 01:49:15,120
championship fight.
That's easily world championship caliber

2309
01:49:15,121 --> 01:49:20,121
fighter.
They asked him about conor mcgregor and 

2310
01:49:20,121 --> 01:49:22,821
caboose is a very good fighter,
but if he wants to come to one of the 

2311
01:49:22,821 --> 01:49:24,210
55,
his welcome.

2312
01:49:24,690 --> 01:49:29,690
I make him welcome,
swell job keeping that guy off you.

2313
01:49:31,281 --> 01:49:32,780
If you're supposed to be fighting 10 
pounds lighter,

2314
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:34,770
look,
especially if you don't.

2315
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,180
If you're not arrested first.
Yeah,

2316
01:49:36,181 --> 01:49:37,180
well you listen man,
I'm not.

2317
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:42,200
I don't.
I wouldn't say that connor can't fight 

2318
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:44,301
at 1:55.
What I would say that if he's competing 

2319
01:49:44,301 --> 01:49:44,301
successfully at the top,
at 1:55,

2320
01:49:44,301 --> 01:49:45,240
45,
like he is right now,

2321
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:48,400
the transition time,
unless he's some Mexicans supplements,

2322
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:50,870
there's gonna be a long transition time 
to put on the,

2323
01:49:50,871 --> 01:49:53,590
the right amount of weight to compete at
that level.

2324
01:49:53,591 --> 01:49:54,660
World of difference,
right?

2325
01:49:54,730 --> 01:49:57,070
Yeah.
Because he's pretty elite at 1:45

2326
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:59,170
in his movement,
in his endurance,

2327
01:49:59,171 --> 01:50:01,780
like he's not having any problems and he
hasn't.

2328
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:06,810
Granted he hasn't been in a real war and
that's what everybody really wants to 

2329
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:10,081
see.
Everybody really wants to see him 

2330
01:50:10,081 --> 01:50:10,300
against a wrestler because everybody 
we've seen is tried to stand up with him

2331
01:50:10,301 --> 01:50:13,330
and he's got nasty hands man,
nasty power,

2332
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:14,980
nasty accuracy,
super,

2333
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:20,010
super aggressive with his striking 
disdainful almost with his stance and 

2334
01:50:20,010 --> 01:50:20,800
his movement towards you.

2335
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:25,950
It's shocking his confidence.
I think that fucks with a lot of 

2336
01:50:25,950 --> 01:50:25,950
people's heads,
man.

2337
01:50:25,950 --> 01:50:29,970
A lot of people when he comes at you and
he's been talking shit about you for 

2338
01:50:29,970 --> 01:50:30,700
months already made you feel like an 
asshole,

2339
01:50:30,701 --> 01:50:32,980
you can't give you the courage,
you know,

2340
01:50:32,981 --> 01:50:37,981
everybody's thinking like,
and then by the time you get in there 

2341
01:50:37,981 --> 01:50:38,950
like you've suffered a mental beating 
already,

2342
01:50:38,951 --> 01:50:40,720
whether you know it or not,
like you're,

2343
01:50:40,730 --> 01:50:41,920
you're at a deficit.
I said,

2344
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:44,080
I asked him where his confidence comes 
from.

2345
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:45,700
So why,
how did you like,

2346
01:50:45,730 --> 01:50:46,040
uh,
you know,

2347
01:50:46,110 --> 01:50:46,710
he said,
Tj,

2348
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:51,730
he's how it has two belts.
He was a European national champion in 

2349
01:50:51,730 --> 01:50:51,730
boxing,
has got another belt for something else.

2350
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:53,080
But I said,
where does this come from?

2351
01:50:53,081 --> 01:50:55,150
This is my work ethic.
I said,

2352
01:50:55,151 --> 01:51:00,151
I know,
but a lot of guys were crying because 

2353
01:51:00,151 --> 01:51:00,151
they tanked.
They work hard,

2354
01:51:00,151 --> 01:51:00,151
but they don't.

2355
01:51:00,151 --> 01:51:01,570
I my eye,
if it does not involve the fight game,

2356
01:51:01,571 --> 01:51:04,570
it does not involve me.
And that was it.

2357
01:51:04,571 --> 01:51:09,571
He goes,
other guys have extracurricular 

2358
01:51:09,571 --> 01:51:09,571
activities.
I don't.

2359
01:51:09,571 --> 01:51:12,270
I count my money and I fight.
And those are the two things I like to 

2360
01:51:12,270 --> 01:51:12,310
do.
He's a game changer,

2361
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:16,210
game changer.
He's like shale times to best thing that

2362
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:18,430
ever happened to Jose.
Aldo is career profile.

2363
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:24,060
It'll,
unless it goes down the way connor 

2364
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:26,431
thinks it's going to go down,
then it's probably the worst thing to 

2365
01:51:26,431 --> 01:51:28,501
have some guy come along and humiliate 
and then fuck you up and you leave with 

2366
01:51:28,501 --> 01:51:29,140
a check.
You were one of the best pound for pound

2367
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:34,141
fighters in the world,
but if connor could do to him what he 

2368
01:51:34,141 --> 01:51:34,141
did,
the Dustin Poirier,

2369
01:51:34,141 --> 01:51:35,230
that would be the most shocking thing 
we've ever seen inside the.

2370
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:40,320
It'll be crazy.
Do you compare a dozen poirier as a 

2371
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:40,320
fighter to Jose?

2372
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:40,320
Aldo is not.
No,

2373
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,670
and that's no disrespect to dustin 
because I think Dustin was doing himself

2374
01:51:42,671 --> 01:51:46,030
a disservice by cutting down at 1:45.
I thought you look fucking sensational.

2375
01:51:46,031 --> 01:51:48,580
His last fight,
he looked amazing at 55.

2376
01:51:48,581 --> 01:51:49,860
He looked,
look comfortable.

2377
01:51:49,861 --> 01:51:52,900
They look thick,
was moving while he still fast as shit.

2378
01:51:53,230 --> 01:51:58,230
I think Dustin's a big boy and I think 
those guys had cut down to 45 like that 

2379
01:51:58,230 --> 01:52:02,350
or fuck,
it's your body's getting tortured and 

2380
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:04,030
you can kind of bounce back from it.
And when you're younger,

2381
01:52:04,031 --> 01:52:07,420
it's easier than when you get older,
when you've been in the game a long time

2382
01:52:07,421 --> 01:52:12,421
and your body has been taken kicks and 
punches and you know you're dehydrating 

2383
01:52:12,421 --> 01:52:13,990
and every few months and then 
rehydrating it,

2384
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,140
like after a while that's shit is going 
to pay.

2385
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,210
You're going to pay a price,
it's going to pay its toll.

2386
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:21,540
And um,
you,

2387
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:26,580
I think that a guy who is a really good 
fighter that cuts less weight and has a 

2388
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:33,300
less great advantage but has a full 
healthy body and all of the endurance 

2389
01:52:34,271 --> 01:52:39,271
that comes with that and all the peace 
of mind knowing that you slept well and 

2390
01:52:39,271 --> 01:52:42,961
ate well and your body feels really 
rested and you probably are better off 

2391
01:52:42,961 --> 01:52:46,210
somewhere on the comfortable side of 
that than in the comfortable side of too

2392
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:49,370
dehydrated because those are the people 
that wind up looking almost like there's

2393
01:52:49,371 --> 01:52:54,371
points where they're almost like 
helpless because their body has 

2394
01:52:54,371 --> 01:52:54,620
dehydrated so much.

2395
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:58,630
And the grueling newness of the fight.
There's some guys you never see do it.

2396
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:00,470
Some guys pull it off like Benson 
Henderson.

2397
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:01,730
He pulls it off,
man.

2398
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:03,920
He pulls it off like you never see that 
guy tired,

2399
01:53:04,250 --> 01:53:07,400
you never see that guy worn out and he 
loses a lot of weight.

2400
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:10,250
But then when you saw him fight against 
brandon batch,

2401
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:15,580
what you saw is one guy who was enormous
batch who's a huge for one seven.

2402
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:18,370
He cuts a lot of weight so big and 
Benson wasn't cotton,

2403
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:20,030
hardly any weight at all,
if any,

2404
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:25,120
to fight at one 70 because usually 
fights it time especially and great and 

2405
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:29,951
part of it you have to consider is that 
Benson is a guy with way more 

2406
01:53:29,951 --> 01:53:33,731
experience,
way more ways to win and a way better 

2407
01:53:33,731 --> 01:53:34,790
ground game.
I mean Benson has a legitimate blackbelt

2408
01:53:34,910 --> 01:53:36,440
ground game and his,
his,

2409
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:38,990
his manager and trainer,
John Crouch,

2410
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:40,820
he's legit as they come.

2411
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:45,110
Like Benson is super good on the ground.
He's very good on the ground despite the

2412
01:53:45,111 --> 01:53:50,111
fact that pet is condom in that arm bar.
That was just so God damn quick and 

2413
01:53:50,111 --> 01:53:50,111
perfect.
Yeah.

2414
01:53:50,111 --> 01:53:50,600
But when you look at his real ground 
game,

2415
01:53:50,601 --> 01:53:52,010
like when he fucked that,
she realized like,

2416
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:53,150
you know what man?
It'd be like,

2417
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:57,140
it might be better if he fought bigger 
guys and he was healthy.

2418
01:53:57,350 --> 01:53:58,970
It might be better because he's so 
technical,

2419
01:53:59,190 --> 01:54:04,190
like it's not a big,
it's like the guys who rely on slugging 

2420
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:04,880
it out and smashing and hulk smashing 
dudes.

2421
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:06,980
Those guys have to be really big for 
their way class.

2422
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:09,920
But the guys who fight like Benson or 
like Frankie,

2423
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:13,300
super technical,
super endurance constantly on you,

2424
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:15,080
you know,
always cutting angles,

2425
01:54:15,081 --> 01:54:16,270
always making you work,
always pushing.

2426
01:54:16,271 --> 01:54:17,480
You.
Always putting pressure on you.

2427
01:54:17,870 --> 01:54:19,940
I think Benson Henderson is,
is,

2428
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,940
you know,
can keep me with anybody in 70.

2429
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:25,760
Certainly Robbie lawler and,
and uh,

2430
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:28,730
any of those guys and Johnny Hendricks,
he's kind of very similar.

2431
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,550
He's just as tall,
might be a little shorter.

2432
01:54:31,551 --> 01:54:36,551
But for the most part I think that 
there's nobody in the 70 pound weight 

2433
01:54:36,551 --> 01:54:37,490
class that I think gives him a beating,
including Carlos.

2434
01:54:37,850 --> 01:54:38,380
Well,
you know,

2435
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:43,470
he mean he could be a champion at one 
seven and everybody says that's 

2436
01:54:43,470 --> 01:54:43,470
ridiculous because it's so.
But look,

2437
01:54:43,470 --> 01:54:44,600
man,
that fucking weight classes,

2438
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:45,690
nuts,
right?

2439
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:48,590
Anybody in any given night in that 
weight class could be a champion.

2440
01:54:48,591 --> 01:54:51,050
Same with 55.
Rory Macdonald can be a champion.

2441
01:54:51,110 --> 01:54:53,660
Robbie lawler is the champion.
I mean,

2442
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,150
either one of those guys could be 
champion,

2443
01:54:56,210 --> 01:54:58,430
you know,
I mean condit could still.

2444
01:54:58,431 --> 01:55:01,700
He champion Woodley could be championed,
hugged her lumbar,

2445
01:55:01,701 --> 01:55:02,750
could be champion.
I forgot.

2446
01:55:02,980 --> 01:55:05,080
I keep forgetting about it.
Guys like hector,

2447
01:55:05,150 --> 01:55:06,590
he's out for a year.

2448
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:11,650
Yeah.
Steroids for the juice is my friend had 

2449
01:55:11,650 --> 01:55:12,990
the juices study said that anybody who 
does steroids should be banned for life.

2450
01:55:12,991 --> 01:55:15,470
And he says my.
Someone gave him a drink.

2451
01:55:15,471 --> 01:55:20,471
My friend rubbed oil on his body.
I think it was looking a.

2452
01:55:20,630 --> 01:55:25,630
This is some translation issues between 
Spanish and English or the pharmacy man.

2453
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:30,950
Fucking nose gave him something.
We talk about the 85 pound weight class.

2454
01:55:30,951 --> 01:55:35,951
Seventy pounds.
I forget about him and I forgot about 

2455
01:55:35,951 --> 01:55:35,951
guys like Yoel Romero and.
Well he's 70 now.

2456
01:55:35,951 --> 01:55:38,870
He went down to 17 hectors at one 70.
Um,

2457
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:40,960
but you'll all Romero,
he's another one.

2458
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,860
That was a bummer that he didn't get to 
Rey this weekend.

2459
01:55:45,310 --> 01:55:47,910
What happened to him is he got hurt,
he hurt his knee,

2460
01:55:47,980 --> 01:55:49,290
dammit.
Fuck.

2461
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:54,000
That was an insane fight.
And then became an insane demonstration.

2462
01:55:54,180 --> 01:55:59,180
See if you could find that.
That Jeff of Jacques Rey Armbar and 

2463
01:55:59,180 --> 01:55:59,180
Chris Kamozi I think.

2464
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:01,950
I think if I had to put money on the 
Yoel Romero shocker,

2465
01:56:01,970 --> 01:56:06,390
a fight I go with,
with A.

2466
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:11,390
Because I,
I still think your morale or if he's 

2467
01:56:11,390 --> 01:56:12,090
fighting five rounds,
if it's four and five,

2468
01:56:12,091 --> 01:56:14,790
he starts to gas because he's just,
there's so much muscle to feet.

2469
01:56:14,791 --> 01:56:19,791
So the top one is the guard pass,
which was equally ridiculously 

2470
01:56:19,791 --> 01:56:23,781
impressive.
And the bottom one is the actual arm 

2471
01:56:23,781 --> 01:56:23,781
bar.
Jamie.

2472
01:56:23,781 --> 01:56:24,000
Yeah,
that's the guard pass.

2473
01:56:24,001 --> 01:56:28,020
We just look all the weight he put on 
them with a one shoulder.

2474
01:56:28,021 --> 01:56:30,660
Whereas whole bodies up priest turn off 
ad block.

2475
01:56:30,661 --> 01:56:35,570
Fuck you man.
Bitches running scripts on your ships,

2476
01:56:36,630 --> 01:56:39,090
find it on another,
go to another website.

2477
01:56:39,870 --> 01:56:41,130
Um,
but anyway,

2478
01:56:41,190 --> 01:56:43,010
point being this,
uh,

2479
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:48,280
this,
this era that we're living in right now 

2480
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:48,390
was like greatest ever for martial arts 
I think.

2481
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:53,420
I don't think there's ever been a time 
ever in my life where I've seen this 

2482
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:54,990
level of execution on a scale like this.

2483
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:57,180
It just didn't exist before.
It didn't exist.

2484
01:56:57,181 --> 01:57:01,410
When you combine the skill level of the 
kickboxers,

2485
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:06,440
like the glory kickboxers skill level of
the guys that are coming out of 

2486
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:06,440
Thailand,
you know,

2487
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:09,690
it's just all right.
Everybody sharing their own techniques,

2488
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:11,040
we will call.
Well,

2489
01:57:11,041 --> 01:57:13,830
you can watch them online now too.
That helps a lot.

2490
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:17,340
And there's.
I just think that overall Jujitsu,

2491
01:57:17,550 --> 01:57:20,280
Muay Thai,
kickboxing and mma,

2492
01:57:20,281 --> 01:57:25,281
I don't think there's ever been a time 
that has been even close to be 

2493
01:57:25,281 --> 01:57:28,290
represented the way martial arts to 
represent it today.

2494
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:31,300
But that's just part of it.
The real impressive thing was the,

2495
01:57:31,301 --> 01:57:33,090
uh,
the transition to that.

2496
01:57:33,270 --> 01:57:35,730
They were going a scramble.
That's just the end of it.

2497
01:57:36,210 --> 01:57:41,210
They were in a scramble and jock array,
a dove on his arm and threw a leg over 

2498
01:57:41,851 --> 01:57:46,851
and then hooked him under his leg to 
keep them from rolling out of it and 

2499
01:57:47,010 --> 01:57:49,290
then scoot his hips to the left and I 
was watching.

2500
01:57:49,290 --> 01:57:50,870
I was like,
that is art.

2501
01:57:50,970 --> 01:57:52,890
That's ballet.
He's a master.

2502
01:57:52,891 --> 01:57:54,630
I think something else was happening 
right away,

2503
01:57:54,631 --> 01:57:55,380
right?
Yeah.

2504
01:57:55,381 --> 01:57:57,750
I knew it was going for the arm.
As soon as I saw him,

2505
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:00,300
I think I probably yelled at how he's 
diving for an arm,

2506
01:58:00,510 --> 01:58:02,250
but I could tell that he,
he does that all the time.

2507
01:58:02,251 --> 01:58:07,251
Some guys don't like to do that because 
it's a tricky transition between like 

2508
01:58:07,251 --> 01:58:08,190
sometimes from the back.
Some guys will say,

2509
01:58:08,191 --> 01:58:10,170
you know what?
This guy is defending the choke to good.

2510
01:58:10,171 --> 01:58:11,820
I'm going to set up the arm bar.
Like,

2511
01:58:11,821 --> 01:58:16,821
um,
who smart Paul Horez did that to Ivan 

2512
01:58:16,821 --> 01:58:19,140
salivary.
He went from the back to an arm bar.

2513
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:23,580
There's a video of him doing that same 
exact transition to a gym to.

2514
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:26,400
I'm Jason Miller.
I think that,

2515
01:58:26,401 --> 01:58:31,401
uh,
he's got a lot of techniques like that 

2516
01:58:31,401 --> 01:58:33,420
where he can transition from the back to
something else.

2517
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:37,200
Jaggery does like,
he's got like levels of transitions that

2518
01:58:37,201 --> 01:58:42,201
other people just don't know.
Like I was watching combos and OSC 

2519
01:58:42,201 --> 01:58:46,650
Kamozi trying to figure out what Rey was
doing while he was doing it and it was 

2520
01:58:46,650 --> 01:58:47,980
just,
it was so high level.

2521
01:58:47,981 --> 01:58:49,930
Dude.
It was so high level,

2522
01:58:50,230 --> 01:58:54,610
like if you're a guy who does Jujitsu 
and you watch how,

2523
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:57,640
how this transitioned flows.
This is not it.

2524
01:58:57,641 --> 01:58:59,320
You got to go through.
It's before that.

2525
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:01,540
Yeah.
But it's before that.

2526
01:59:01,570 --> 01:59:03,670
It's not,
it's they missed the whole thing.

2527
01:59:04,090 --> 01:59:07,450
So this is just an arm bar.
This is an bar and it's impressive,

2528
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:12,630
but that's not what's impressive.
What was impressive was the full 

2529
01:59:12,630 --> 01:59:12,630
transition go to that grappling world,
uh,

2530
01:59:12,630 --> 01:59:16,480
instagram grappling world on instagram.
That's where I said it was a,

2531
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:18,850
you could see the whole thing,
but the way he does it,

2532
01:59:18,851 --> 01:59:23,851
it's like you have to have this insane 
knowledge of where to put your legs in 

2533
01:59:23,851 --> 01:59:28,261
the transition where he's going to 
likely wind up where his legs going to 

2534
01:59:28,261 --> 01:59:32,461
kick and there's so much data that he's 
calculating and it's all based on 

2535
01:59:32,461 --> 01:59:32,461
technique.

2536
01:59:32,461 --> 01:59:36,900
Just like very minimal effort,
like none of that that he did with 

2537
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:38,350
strength.
And that's like the most pure expression

2538
01:59:38,351 --> 01:59:43,351
of martial arts.
I mean certainly strong as fuck 

2539
01:59:43,351 --> 01:59:43,351
strengths certainly aided him and 
pulling off the moon.

2540
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:48,360
Don't get me wrong,
but what I'm saying is that move was 

2541
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:48,360
pulled off because of his perfect 
technique.

2542
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:52,910
I mean,
you have to be physically strong person 

2543
01:59:52,910 --> 01:59:55,210
to do anything to a Jujitsu person,
but there was no resistance there.

2544
01:59:55,270 --> 01:59:56,800
If you look,
there was defense,

2545
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:02,040
but the way he moved into that position,
he was never resisted because he was so 

2546
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:06,481
far ahead of Kamozi.
Technically like in the dive 

2547
02:00:06,481 --> 02:00:06,481
commodities,
like,

2548
02:00:06,481 --> 02:00:06,481
Oh shit.
He's diving going,

2549
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:07,940
oh fuck.
He was already set.

2550
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:09,490
He was adamant.
He was way ahead of.

2551
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:14,510
Yeah,
he's way ahead of when you roll with 

2552
02:00:14,510 --> 02:00:14,510
really good guys,
they.

2553
02:00:14,510 --> 02:00:14,510
They are ahead of you.

2554
02:00:14,510 --> 02:00:15,940
They've been there before.
They've seen what you're going to do.

2555
02:00:15,941 --> 02:00:18,850
They can predict what you're going to do
and sometimes if they're really good,

2556
02:00:18,851 --> 02:00:22,570
they can get you to think you're going 
to do something you do that.

2557
02:00:22,571 --> 02:00:23,680
They already know you're going to do 
that,

2558
02:00:23,681 --> 02:00:28,681
and then they capitalize.
That's what makes shocker a truly 

2559
02:00:28,681 --> 02:00:28,681
special.
No,

2560
02:00:28,681 --> 02:00:32,250
there's two.
There's two running right now for the 

2561
02:00:32,250 --> 02:00:32,250
number one contender after this,
Chris Weidman,

2562
02:00:32,250 --> 02:00:36,661
Vito Belfort fight.
There's shock array and who won on the 

2563
02:00:36,661 --> 02:00:36,661
quote and then Luke rockhold.
Yeah,

2564
02:00:36,661 --> 02:00:41,460
and I think Luke rockhold made a giant 
statement by beating Machida and 

2565
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:42,240
smashing them with a choke hold.
Beat.

2566
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:42,930
Shocker,
right?

2567
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:44,080
Yes.
Yes,

2568
02:00:44,081 --> 02:00:46,480
he did.
He did your take on that,

2569
02:00:46,570 --> 02:00:47,500
but there's a very good fight.
Look,

2570
02:00:47,501 --> 02:00:50,020
I think rockhold against anybody is a 
very good fight.

2571
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:51,670
Rockhold is a mother fucker,
dude.

2572
02:00:51,671 --> 02:00:53,670
There's no denying it now after what?

2573
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:57,030
He did a good looking guy either.
The only reason why anybody gets laid is

2574
02:00:57,040 --> 02:01:00,700
because rockhold didn't get their first 
got there.

2575
02:01:00,701 --> 02:01:02,710
First do.
It'd be no pussy for anybody else.

2576
02:01:02,711 --> 02:01:04,510
That's the bottom line is hansel 
bastard,

2577
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:09,250
but more importantly what it does inside
the octagon is super unusual.

2578
02:01:09,251 --> 02:01:14,251
Man.
He's a long guy is like Javier Mendez 

2579
02:01:14,251 --> 02:01:17,131
explained it to me in the cage after the
fight and I was congratulating him and 

2580
02:01:17,131 --> 02:01:20,790
Bob Cook.
Javier said he's long and he's strong 

2581
02:01:20,790 --> 02:01:20,790
and usually don't get those two 
together.

2582
02:01:20,790 --> 02:01:22,210
Oh,
because he's a long dude,

2583
02:01:22,211 --> 02:01:25,060
but he's also yoked as fuck.
He's not like a long,

2584
02:01:25,061 --> 02:01:30,061
skinny Roger Gracie type grappler.
He's long and he's yoked and he trains 

2585
02:01:30,961 --> 02:01:34,650
on a daily basis with Kane motherfucking
full last name.

2586
02:01:34,790 --> 02:01:35,360
Oh,
that's right.

2587
02:01:35,361 --> 02:01:38,890
It's in Daniel motherfucking.
Call me every everyday.

2588
02:01:39,110 --> 02:01:42,740
These guys going to war with the biggest
killer the heavyweight division has ever

2589
02:01:42,741 --> 02:01:43,890
known outside of Baltimore.

2590
02:01:44,050 --> 02:01:49,050
This is just two guys that you would 
never consider to be the greatest 

2591
02:01:49,050 --> 02:01:50,060
heavyweight cyber.
There's one who's in the UFC.

2592
02:01:50,061 --> 02:01:52,610
He came to Alaska as in one from pride,
fader politics.

2593
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,060
Both of them are.
Don't have.

2594
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,430
If I saw them on the beach,
I would be like,

2595
02:01:58,460 --> 02:02:02,420
that guy used to work out perfect.
Say perfect way of describing fader.

2596
02:02:02,510 --> 02:02:04,610
Yeah.
He used to work out well in the day.

2597
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:07,160
The earlier days of his career,
he was a little thicker.

2598
02:02:07,190 --> 02:02:10,540
Like there's been this picture of him 
standing in front of the Kettlebell is.

2599
02:02:10,541 --> 02:02:12,570
Yeah.
What a great picture to jerk off to.

2600
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:16,500
I've dropped the number of loads,
straightened loads,

2601
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:21,020
but still I'm like,
are you rushing?

2602
02:02:22,260 --> 02:02:25,070
Rushing,
bear size of your tendons are bigger,

2603
02:02:25,071 --> 02:02:25,980
right?
Your trash.

2604
02:02:26,230 --> 02:02:31,230
Oh Gosh.
Dog Legs Stud all time greats insertion 

2605
02:02:31,230 --> 02:02:31,230
cabs.
I mean,

2606
02:02:31,230 --> 02:02:31,510
uh,
it's,

2607
02:02:31,620 --> 02:02:33,560
it's hard to say.
He doesn't shave his chest,

2608
02:02:33,561 --> 02:02:35,560
he does,
he does he fuck.

2609
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:40,780
It's hard to say like who would have won
in a fight in his prime versus cane in 

2610
02:02:40,780 --> 02:02:43,250
his prime because they came in in two 
totally different errors and if you want

2611
02:02:43,251 --> 02:02:46,100
to look at accomplishments,
boy,

2612
02:02:46,670 --> 02:02:50,640
it's really hard to discount cro,
cop beat and or fate or being cro,

2613
02:02:50,641 --> 02:02:54,830
cop fate or beaten pretty much everybody
they put in front of them and in pride,

2614
02:02:55,190 --> 02:03:00,190
I mean he really beat some of the best 
in the world and the heavyweight 

2615
02:03:00,190 --> 02:03:03,161
division in pride back then was probably
outside of Tim Silvia and Frank Mir,

2616
02:03:04,370 --> 02:03:06,500
who in their prime could give anybody a 
hard time.

2617
02:03:07,100 --> 02:03:12,100
That was probably the strongest 
heavyweight division the world has ever 

2618
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:13,010
known because everybody,
first of all,

2619
02:03:13,011 --> 02:03:15,080
I was allowed to do all sorts of 
Mexicans.

2620
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:21,160
She can do whatever the fuck you wanted 
and you were dealing with guys who were 

2621
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:21,500
fighting for a lot of fucking money.

2622
02:03:21,890 --> 02:03:23,660
I mean there was a.
You got.

2623
02:03:23,661 --> 02:03:25,700
Think about it.
You Got Alexander Million Inco,

2624
02:03:25,701 --> 02:03:26,720
you've got cro,
cop,

2625
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:31,760
you got cro cop in his prime when he was
head kick and ventilate asleep,

2626
02:03:32,180 --> 02:03:34,780
you know.
Oh my cookie mooglie.

2627
02:03:34,781 --> 02:03:39,680
You've got Minataro who was fighting off
his back and triangling Mark Cole,

2628
02:03:39,681 --> 02:03:43,590
but off his back,
like call in in his prime crazy.

2629
02:03:43,820 --> 02:03:46,910
Coleman was strong as fuck.
It was nothing to triangle.

2630
02:03:47,150 --> 02:03:52,150
Just a head and shoulders.
Minataro when he was off his back was 

2631
02:03:52,150 --> 02:03:52,150
special dude.
He,

2632
02:03:52,150 --> 02:03:56,451
he was.
He represented a thing that no one had 

2633
02:03:56,451 --> 02:03:59,021
ever seen before.
A real legit Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black 

2634
02:03:59,021 --> 02:04:00,570
belt.
Who's a fucking bonafide heavyweight who

2635
02:04:00,571 --> 02:04:04,700
strangles guys off his back because he 
was the mentor.

2636
02:04:04,701 --> 02:04:05,120
He.
You,

2637
02:04:05,121 --> 02:04:08,000
you got lost in the maze of his Jujitsu 
or what was it?

2638
02:04:08,540 --> 02:04:09,790
That's a good question.
I don't know.

2639
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:14,800
I'm going to guess that's what it is 
because you don't want to get lost in 

2640
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:14,800
minute.

2641
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:15,510
Charles Mayes,
maybe it's just like he's half bull.

2642
02:04:16,890 --> 02:04:18,270
So fucking strong.
Yes,

2643
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:19,730
it's tough.
She was tough.

2644
02:04:20,010 --> 02:04:22,370
Shit.
Just started another lap.

2645
02:04:22,790 --> 02:04:25,690
Just another level of toughness.
So you think about minotauro.

2646
02:04:25,730 --> 02:04:30,730
Okay.
Fate or beat him in his prime and fader 

2647
02:04:30,730 --> 02:04:32,890
beat cro cop in his prime.
They never.

2648
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:35,510
Josh Barnett and him never fought.
When he was in Josh.

2649
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:37,980
Josh was in his prime.
Kevin Randleman.

2650
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,580
Remember that he beat Kevin Randleman 
flex.

2651
02:04:40,970 --> 02:04:41,580
No,
Kevin,

2652
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:44,670
right.
Got an arm bar just moments later.

2653
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,190
So it's not good enough.
I'll break this.

2654
02:04:47,220 --> 02:04:47,830
Okay.
Top.

2655
02:04:48,770 --> 02:04:51,780
That was the craziest transition dude.
He was a motherfucker.

2656
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:54,000
He was a motherfucker.
Fader was a motherfucker,

2657
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:56,700
but if I like it,
it's timing with those shots.

2658
02:04:56,701 --> 02:05:01,701
Fantastic.
And his ability to knock guys out and 

2659
02:05:01,701 --> 02:05:04,071
he's saying uh,
and Andre Arlovski knocked him out in 

2660
02:05:04,071 --> 02:05:07,401
the air,
but that was by the way a fight where 

2661
02:05:07,401 --> 02:05:07,401
our last,
he was picking them apart and that was a

2662
02:05:07,401 --> 02:05:08,130
fight where a lot of people looked at 
what?

2663
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:14,300
This guy's got some holes and it was 
also a fight where he was criticized by 

2664
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:14,300
his old trainers.
Trainer was saying,

2665
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:15,390
you know,
he's up to his old tricks.

2666
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:20,600
He won with a trick like,
but they didn't prepare for this 

2667
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:20,880
properly.
His trainer was vocal about that.

2668
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:23,160
That training with Freddie Roach,
I think.

2669
02:05:23,550 --> 02:05:24,590
I think you're right.
Yeah,

2670
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:29,630
well Arloski got crazy and went with 
that flying knee and if he didn't go 

2671
02:05:29,630 --> 02:05:32,571
with the flying knee,
who knows what would happen if you 

2672
02:05:32,571 --> 02:05:33,750
continue to pick them apart like that.
It could have been crazy.

2673
02:05:34,050 --> 02:05:36,600
It could have been crazy to watch fate 
or get kick boxed,

2674
02:05:36,890 --> 02:05:38,280
you know,
but Arlovski,

2675
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:40,580
at least on paper was a,
you know,

2676
02:05:40,650 --> 02:05:45,650
very formidable kickbox and threatened.
He had like one punch knockout power 

2677
02:05:45,650 --> 02:05:48,900
lasers straight right hand me through a 
right hand that when he knocked out Paul

2678
02:05:48,901 --> 02:05:51,450
blend like early in the first round,
he threw a right hand.

2679
02:05:51,450 --> 02:05:55,140
It was like a bolt.
So to really comes off his shoulder hits

2680
02:05:55,141 --> 02:05:56,940
you in your genuine.
You know what the fuck happened?

2681
02:05:56,941 --> 02:06:00,870
He's so fast.
When Arlovski was in his prime dude,

2682
02:06:00,930 --> 02:06:05,930
people were terrified of him.
Remember the first time he came in 

2683
02:06:05,930 --> 02:06:06,090
there,
they get this 240 pound guy moved like a

2684
02:06:06,091 --> 02:06:08,510
small man.
Would that pony tail?

2685
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,380
Well,
when fader or gone to him,

2686
02:06:10,381 --> 02:06:14,580
he had lost a few and he'd been out of 
the UFC in fighting for affliction,

2687
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:20,280
you know,
but I'm still still was pretty 

2688
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:21,600
formidable five rounds.
Who knows,

2689
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:26,690
that's the problem.
It's like you'd have to have a time 

2690
02:06:26,690 --> 02:06:28,641
machine.
You'd have to coordinate like you know 

2691
02:06:28,641 --> 02:06:31,080
when,
what version of cane before the first 

2692
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:32,670
fight with junior dos Santos before the 
second fight with junior dos Santos,

2693
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:35,160
you know,
I mean junior dos Santos knocked him out

2694
02:06:35,161 --> 02:06:39,840
in the first fight and then they went to
fucking war for two fights in a row.

2695
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:41,700
And those fights,
you got to think like,

2696
02:06:41,701 --> 02:06:46,701
man,
you fade or obviously lost a step 

2697
02:06:46,701 --> 02:06:50,090
somewhere along the way and you have to 
attribute it if you don't attribute it 

2698
02:06:50,090 --> 02:06:54,831
to his focus.
I don't know what his focus wasn't 

2699
02:06:54,831 --> 02:06:54,831
training his coaches saying something 
like that.

2700
02:06:54,831 --> 02:06:58,540
It could be that he was kind of getting 
tired of fighting or it could be the god

2701
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:00,630
wars he went through.
I mean,

2702
02:07:00,660 --> 02:07:05,660
nobody rides for free when it comes to 
those crazy fucking 10 minute rounds of 

2703
02:07:05,730 --> 02:07:07,440
sparring sessions that he would go 
through,

2704
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:08,220
you know,
meet me.

2705
02:07:08,221 --> 02:07:12,750
We were talking to Tony Jeffries about 
this and he was calculating and he was.

2706
02:07:12,810 --> 02:07:15,840
He had 106 fights,
26 of which were pro I think.

2707
02:07:16,350 --> 02:07:20,790
And he said if you look at all the 
rounds I fought to prepare for those 106

2708
02:07:20,791 --> 02:07:23,730
fights and this is when I became an 
amateur is not when I was a kid.

2709
02:07:24,270 --> 02:07:25,800
He calculated it.
He takes about.

2710
02:07:26,110 --> 02:07:29,570
He took over 55,000
shots that God to him,

2711
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:34,580
$5,000
and so crazy and call for a lot of 

2712
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:35,140
boxers because you've got to take into 
account the,

2713
02:07:35,210 --> 02:07:35,980
the,
the five

2714
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,500
jabs.
Just the five jobs you'd take around.

2715
02:07:38,501 --> 02:07:40,840
Even if they're light when you're 
sparring.

2716
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:44,380
It's so crazy,
so crazy when you know,

2717
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:49,770
when you just think about all the 
different micro injuries and different 

2718
02:07:50,651 --> 02:07:52,820
times that Brian's rattling against the 
skull.

2719
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:57,900
Different little things that have the 
connective tissue that's separating or 

2720
02:07:57,900 --> 02:08:00,610
twisting or popping or I know,
but don't you need some of that in life?

2721
02:08:00,611 --> 02:08:02,410
Like I was going to ask you,
you know trauma?

2722
02:08:02,630 --> 02:08:03,090
No,
I.

2723
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:08,100
well somebody didn't call his pockets.
This French general I think are a 

2724
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:11,701
British general said we have to have war
because if a man doesn't have war will 

2725
02:08:11,701 --> 02:08:12,070
will,
will dissolve into materialism.

2726
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:14,470
I thought all right,
whatever that sounds like a general but.

2727
02:08:14,980 --> 02:08:19,840
But there is something to be said about 
a conflict free world as we were talking

2728
02:08:19,841 --> 02:08:24,841
about and I was wondering like,
and I was just trying to like draw a 

2729
02:08:24,841 --> 02:08:24,841
through line to the people.

2730
02:08:24,841 --> 02:08:26,320
I really connect with my really good 
friends,

2731
02:08:26,321 --> 02:08:29,590
the friends that I have and it's not 
that there will be on their list,

2732
02:08:29,591 --> 02:08:34,591
but you are,
but it's not that they're all fighters 

2733
02:08:34,591 --> 02:08:37,090
and unnecessarily,
but they definitely have and continue to

2734
02:08:37,630 --> 02:08:42,310
sort of live in a world that is not,
of course like the Mongols,

2735
02:08:42,311 --> 02:08:44,920
but they keep themselves a little 
uncomfortable.

2736
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:48,190
They are always in touch with kind of 
coming up with their own,

2737
02:08:48,191 --> 02:08:49,870
with a sense of reality.
Well,

2738
02:08:49,871 --> 02:08:52,000
that's what I told you that before.
You're the only dude that I'd ever asked

2739
02:08:52,001 --> 02:08:57,001
to go to Montana to sleep when it's 90 
degrees outside in a little cloth house 

2740
02:08:58,330 --> 02:09:00,330
was horrible that nobody,
none of nobody other.

2741
02:09:00,340 --> 02:09:03,040
None of the other comics we know are 
really good at are going to hack that.

2742
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:04,680
I don't think Duncan and I love him.
And,

2743
02:09:04,681 --> 02:09:09,681
and,
and Tony Hinchcliffe are gonna Kinda 

2744
02:09:09,681 --> 02:09:09,681
like hiking up those mountains in that 
cold.

2745
02:09:09,710 --> 02:09:11,860
Tony might get down with it.
I'm telling you,

2746
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:14,550
Tony Micah done with it.
That little fucker is.

2747
02:09:14,590 --> 02:09:16,480
He's,
he's a little weasel.

2748
02:09:16,510 --> 02:09:18,450
Really shouldn't say weasel.
It should say uh,

2749
02:09:18,451 --> 02:09:23,451
I meant to say he's a golden pony.
I meant badger and he's a determined 

2750
02:09:23,451 --> 02:09:23,890
little.
He's like,

2751
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:26,170
weasels are tough little fucking animals
by the way.

2752
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:31,380
That's a weird thing.
Like weasel became somehow or another 

2753
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:32,320
toughest shame.
An asshole like weasels killed cobras,

2754
02:09:32,321 --> 02:09:33,290
don't they?
Well,

2755
02:09:33,450 --> 02:09:36,550
I think family,
they're,

2756
02:09:36,620 --> 02:09:41,620
they're tough little fuckers.
You say weasley like all the dudes 

2757
02:09:41,620 --> 02:09:41,620
Weasley,
right?

2758
02:09:41,620 --> 02:09:41,620
I mean,
he's,

2759
02:09:41,620 --> 02:09:42,940
he's,
he's not to be fucked with.

2760
02:09:43,090 --> 02:09:46,360
Tony will rise up.
He will figure it out with a pack on his

2761
02:09:46,361 --> 02:09:48,370
back and that cult.
You know what man?

2762
02:09:48,700 --> 02:09:50,830
Physically,
not exactly designed for it.

2763
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:54,130
He's not designed for it,
but he's a tough little fucker.

2764
02:09:54,490 --> 02:09:57,850
Look at that.
This photo of a baby weezer flying.

2765
02:09:57,970 --> 02:10:00,400
That's at Photoshop.
Oh,

2766
02:10:00,401 --> 02:10:03,850
come on.
Someone caught this.

2767
02:10:03,851 --> 02:10:05,920
A baby weasel.
How did he get on his bird?

2768
02:10:05,921 --> 02:10:07,590
I don't believe it.
Well,

2769
02:10:07,620 --> 02:10:08,920
why don't you believe it?
It can happen.

2770
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:10,090
Really?
Yeah.

2771
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:13,330
The world's crazy.
Why is that so weird?

2772
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:14,050
Hats.
Amazed.

2773
02:10:14,051 --> 02:10:17,110
Some baby weasel figured out how to jump
on this fucking birds back.

2774
02:10:17,111 --> 02:10:19,090
Tell me right now.
I think it's completely photoshop.

2775
02:10:19,130 --> 02:10:21,100
Listen,
we know weasels exist.

2776
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:26,160
We know birds can fly.
Why would it be so hard to imagine 

2777
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:28,390
perhaps the weasel jump on his back and 
they went home with venture.

2778
02:10:28,460 --> 02:10:32,980
All the fucking variables in the luck in
the world when it comes to wildlife that

2779
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:34,470
couldn't take place.
Watch this.

2780
02:10:34,670 --> 02:10:36,690
I don't think that bird would be able to
have the,

2781
02:10:36,810 --> 02:10:38,240
uh,
to be able to.

2782
02:10:38,241 --> 02:10:39,450
Hang on.
Let's look at this little,

2783
02:10:39,480 --> 02:10:41,510
but also that weasel doesn't have any 
strength.

2784
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:44,190
That's a baby at parts.
Not letting that reason a him.

2785
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:49,720
Jamie,
please snopes this and get back to us 

2786
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:49,720
with the final results.
It's actually real.

2787
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:50,450
Wow.
Come on.

2788
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:51,770
Jimmy says,
it's actually real.

2789
02:10:51,870 --> 02:10:53,480
Still crying.
I'm still calling bullshit.

2790
02:10:53,630 --> 02:10:54,650
Don't call bullshit.
Wow.

2791
02:10:54,651 --> 02:10:59,651
There's another picture of it.
Weasel catches a ride on a woodpecker 

2792
02:10:59,651 --> 02:10:59,651
was that guy.
That guy's a liar.

2793
02:10:59,651 --> 02:10:59,760
That's fucked up.

2794
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:04,230
That's the guy who caught it on camera.
Wow.

2795
02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:06,830
Better not be lying dude.
Phase lines.

2796
02:11:06,831 --> 02:11:07,640
Those hacks.
Sores.

2797
02:11:07,641 --> 02:11:08,720
Dudes are gonna.
Find you.

2798
02:11:10,010 --> 02:11:12,590
They'll find you can't lie to them.
Yeah.

2799
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:15,800
They have elite skills with the 
photoshop layers.

2800
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:21,340
Remember that like these photoshop guys 
were going over the fucking image that 

2801
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:21,760
Obama's birth certificate.
It's clearly been Dr.

2802
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:24,850
and photoshop.
Photoshop the.

2803
02:11:25,190 --> 02:11:30,190
Do you know anything about that Jamie?
The layers of the photoshop argument 

2804
02:11:30,190 --> 02:11:34,210
when it comes to Obama's.
Obama's birth certificate was doctored 

2805
02:11:34,210 --> 02:11:36,170
in Photoshop.
I'll show you doctor,

2806
02:11:36,171 --> 02:11:37,580
if you watch,
if you.

2807
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:42,050
If you take it apart,
the image is several files.

2808
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:47,560
Some of them fucking Kenya.
Several from several.

2809
02:11:48,690 --> 02:11:50,030
Five.
How about this?

2810
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:52,790
How about he's from Hawaii,
which is not America anyway.

2811
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,230
How about that?
You know,

2812
02:11:54,250 --> 02:11:59,250
buys from a fucking.
He's from a country we stole from a 

2813
02:11:59,250 --> 02:11:59,960
tropical island.
Really Nice Group of people.

2814
02:11:59,990 --> 02:12:00,710
Yeah,
they were sweet.

2815
02:12:00,740 --> 02:12:03,530
We say it's an island.
It's just a small country.

2816
02:12:03,770 --> 02:12:04,970
That's what it is.
I agree.

2817
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,670
Hawaiians are Hawaiians.
They're not Americans.

2818
02:12:07,880 --> 02:12:12,880
They are American and since they will 
take the meal and protect them with the 

2819
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:14,990
constitution in the military of the 
United States of America,

2820
02:12:15,950 --> 02:12:19,430
never forget the nr there in our 
protectorate.

2821
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:22,970
Look at Brock,
but what I'm saying is Hawaii.

2822
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:28,240
Oh Shit.
There's two different pictures and they 

2823
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:29,430
photo shopped him in there maybe.
Hm.

2824
02:12:29,830 --> 02:12:31,010
Huh?
Where's the hand?

2825
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:36,250
Where's that left hand?
He's got an upper ass in that second 

2826
02:12:36,250 --> 02:12:36,710
picture.
Just this is not real.

2827
02:12:37,910 --> 02:12:39,140
Oh,
these are hilarious.

2828
02:12:39,650 --> 02:12:42,050
These are hilarious.
Chunk of your edge missing.

2829
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:44,510
Oh Jesus Christ.
It's not even a high resolution photo.

2830
02:12:44,511 --> 02:12:49,511
You fucking Weirdos till they understand
the difference between looking at 

2831
02:12:49,511 --> 02:12:53,621
something with a white background and 
looking at something with a black 

2832
02:12:53,621 --> 02:12:53,621
background.
Go up to that ear.

2833
02:12:53,621 --> 02:12:53,910
I'll just prove this right now.
You fucking dummy.

2834
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:56,030
They see the difference.
See where the transition is.

2835
02:12:56,031 --> 02:12:57,830
The transition is right where the white 
meats,

2836
02:12:57,831 --> 02:13:02,831
the black,
you know why it happened because the 

2837
02:13:02,831 --> 02:13:02,831
camera picks it up again to bring it 
back.

2838
02:13:02,831 --> 02:13:04,400
This is becoming the Dan Carlin 
podcasts,

2839
02:13:04,401 --> 02:13:09,401
but he said something really cool about 
how people like conspiracy theories 

2840
02:13:09,401 --> 02:13:13,661
because it's really hard to believe that
the random just happens where that one 

2841
02:13:13,661 --> 02:13:17,321
man like Lee Harvey Oswald can change 
the course of history with a bullet and 

2842
02:13:17,321 --> 02:13:18,980
that's a lot harder to believe than you 
know,

2843
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:24,400
a group of people who were very 
organized ended up doing what they did 

2844
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:24,400
and it's human.
We all want.

2845
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:27,140
We want to a logical explanation,
not a random one,

2846
02:13:27,350 --> 02:13:31,530
not the fact that we're fragile enough 
that one man can fuck everything up with

2847
02:13:32,060 --> 02:13:34,650
with a good bullet or a good bomb.
It's just,

2848
02:13:34,651 --> 02:13:39,651
it's that time where that was possible.
I wonder if that's possible today and 

2849
02:13:39,651 --> 02:13:43,110
it's certainly to a lesser extent,
like there's certainly there's a weirder

2850
02:13:43,350 --> 02:13:48,350
connection that people share today than 
they've ever done before and I wonder 

2851
02:13:48,541 --> 02:13:53,541
how much we realize about how that's 
shaping society's shaping.

2852
02:13:54,181 --> 02:13:56,790
Just human civilization as a human,
you know,

2853
02:13:56,791 --> 02:13:59,740
we were talking about before as a 
gigantic super organism,

2854
02:13:59,930 --> 02:14:04,930
super organism that relied on aggression
to get to a certain point of innovation 

2855
02:14:04,930 --> 02:14:06,720
and then once it got to that certain 
point of innovation,

2856
02:14:06,721 --> 02:14:11,721
what,
when does it no longer need aggression 

2857
02:14:11,721 --> 02:14:15,740
and when does it need like a realization
of what it actually is instead of 

2858
02:14:15,740 --> 02:14:19,011
aggression.
When does it need a real realization 

2859
02:14:19,011 --> 02:14:19,011
like,
listen,

2860
02:14:19,011 --> 02:14:19,011
listen,
the only way that's going gonna work out

2861
02:14:19,011 --> 02:14:21,150
for everybody as we got to act for 
everybody.

2862
02:14:21,180 --> 02:14:26,180
That's the only way.
If the human race just treats everybody 

2863
02:14:26,180 --> 02:14:29,481
that way,
like you have to find where the weak 

2864
02:14:29,481 --> 02:14:29,481
spots are.
Prop them up,

2865
02:14:29,481 --> 02:14:31,410
figure out why they're fucked up,
engineered correctly.

2866
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:33,180
You know,
as far as social engineering,

2867
02:14:33,210 --> 02:14:36,270
education,
counseling are you saying that we should

2868
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:41,300
do unto others as you'd have them do 
unto us as rabbi hello and a guy named 

2869
02:14:41,300 --> 02:14:46,011
Jesus Christ said,
and once you get to a point where you 

2870
02:14:46,011 --> 02:14:49,161
have something called the Internet and 
people can exchange these ideas and 

2871
02:14:49,161 --> 02:14:54,051
exchange these,
these points of view and these 

2872
02:14:54,051 --> 02:14:54,051
expressions like,
this is how I feel about you,

2873
02:14:54,051 --> 02:14:55,980
is how you feel about me.
When you communication like this,

2874
02:14:56,330 --> 02:15:01,330
you can communicate like this in real 
time in a way that's never happened 

2875
02:15:01,330 --> 02:15:05,181
before.
So they're not like these weird people 

2876
02:15:05,181 --> 02:15:06,360
in Germany that you don't know that.
Or they have this guy standing on top of

2877
02:15:06,361 --> 02:15:08,160
a podium and he's screaming shit out and
you're like,

2878
02:15:08,161 --> 02:15:09,180
what's going on over there?

2879
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:12,420
Why are they all marching?
Why they all goose step in like that?

2880
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:14,400
What are they doing with the Jews?
Like,

2881
02:15:14,401 --> 02:15:19,401
what the fuck is going on over there?
And you're reading things about it in 

2882
02:15:19,401 --> 02:15:22,191
the paper and you're trying to take 
these little printed words and piece 

2883
02:15:22,191 --> 02:15:23,520
them into a narrative that makes sense 
in your head.

2884
02:15:23,730 --> 02:15:26,550
You're reading the New York Times every 
morning to find out what's the news,

2885
02:15:26,551 --> 02:15:31,551
what the with Europe,
what's going on over there without boys 

2886
02:15:31,551 --> 02:15:34,880
and you want to look into the paper 
trying to find out how the score is the 

2887
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:36,090
war and you're listening to the radio at
night,

2888
02:15:36,240 --> 02:15:41,240
the fucking radio.
You're listening to the radio to 

2889
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:44,500
Kranich's blaming.
You would go to the movies and they 

2890
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:44,500
would show a clip,
a highlight war,

2891
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:47,730
real clip of the news while you're 
waiting for your movie to start.

2892
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:49,430
I know what the fuck.

2893
02:15:49,430 --> 02:15:52,800
I'm very controlled to the.
Your information was controlled.

2894
02:15:52,860 --> 02:15:57,860
War was actually was actually kind of 
presented in a very sanitized way as 

2895
02:16:01,081 --> 02:16:06,081
well and in many ways still is like the 
idea that when you get hit with heavy 

2896
02:16:06,081 --> 02:16:06,090
artillery,
you come apart.

2897
02:16:06,120 --> 02:16:09,420
There are not holes in your body.
We don't show a lot of that stuff.

2898
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:12,300
Probably shouldn't lonely,
shouldn't.

2899
02:16:12,301 --> 02:16:13,690
We?
Wouldn't.

2900
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:15,750
Wouldn't be.
It'd be good for people to know what the

2901
02:16:15,751 --> 02:16:17,060
fuck they're signing.
I know.

2902
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:22,360
I know that the.
I know that the logic was always that 

2903
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:24,660
you censored media during war time and 
didn't let them show the really horrific

2904
02:16:24,661 --> 02:16:29,661
stuff because it was bad for morale 
among troops and at home.

2905
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:31,480
Now,
does that make sense to you?

2906
02:16:32,290 --> 02:16:37,290
I don't know enough about what it's like
to motivate young men to go to battle.

2907
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:43,170
I don't know enough about what it's like
to be a general or a person in power 

2908
02:16:43,170 --> 02:16:44,950
when I'm in a war time situation.
I don't know what it's like to be.

2909
02:16:44,951 --> 02:16:49,951
To have the very existence of my country
under threat the way we were in world 

2910
02:16:49,951 --> 02:16:49,951
war two,
when that,

2911
02:16:49,951 --> 02:16:53,650
when those kinds of policies were made,
so I don't know,

2912
02:16:53,651 --> 02:16:58,651
man.
I think I'd have think I'd have a very 

2913
02:16:58,651 --> 02:17:01,021
different point of view if I was.
That's all and I think we'd all have 

2914
02:17:01,021 --> 02:17:01,390
very different points of view and would 
do very,

2915
02:17:01,391 --> 02:17:06,391
very different things and behave maybe a
lot like the leaders we criticized if we

2916
02:17:07,631 --> 02:17:12,631
were under the kinds of responsibilities
and pressures that the leaders we talk 

2917
02:17:14,591 --> 02:17:15,460
about we're under.

2918
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:19,750
I think that if I were the emir,
the caliphate of Baghdad,

2919
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:25,080
and I knew that the Mongols were doing 
what they were doing to people and they 

2920
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:29,671
were on the way to see me,
I'd be pretty ruthless with any kind of 

2921
02:17:29,671 --> 02:17:32,380
dissent,
any kind of a Mongol sympathy,

2922
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:37,880
and I would be pretty ruthless with 
anybody who wasn't pitching in for the 

2923
02:17:37,880 --> 02:17:41,821
very survival of my my town because the 
consequences are so high have not taken 

2924
02:17:41,821 --> 02:17:44,350
seriously,
not being aggressively prepared.

2925
02:17:44,370 --> 02:17:47,890
Yes.
The question becomes like how if ever is

2926
02:17:47,891 --> 02:17:52,891
it possible that because of the fact 
that we can communicate with each other 

2927
02:17:52,891 --> 02:17:55,861
all across the world instantaneously,
how is it possible that we move past the

2928
02:17:56,111 --> 02:17:59,320
idea of armed conflicts entirely?
Like isn't it possible?

2929
02:17:59,380 --> 02:18:01,810
It is possible and it's already kind of 
happening?

2930
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:04,540
How is it?
How can you say that when we're going to

2931
02:18:04,541 --> 02:18:04,990
war?

2932
02:18:05,110 --> 02:18:10,110
I mean we're.
We're in the middle of like pulling out 

2933
02:18:10,110 --> 02:18:10,900
of Iraq and Afghanistan while 
maintaining thousands of troops.

2934
02:18:10,901 --> 02:18:13,030
Yes,
we have bases all over the world.

2935
02:18:13,060 --> 02:18:15,070
Yes,
there's this isis shit that's going on.

2936
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:20,100
There's this overall,
if you look at the number of violent 

2937
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:23,851
deaths from 2000 until 2015,
according to Steven pinker in his very 

2938
02:18:24,671 --> 02:18:29,671
well researched book called the angels 
of our better nature essentially said it

2939
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:35,100
proves and and makes the case that fewer
people have died violently in that span 

2940
02:18:35,711 --> 02:18:37,120
of time.
Even with the Congo,

2941
02:18:37,121 --> 02:18:42,121
even with the Middle East,
even with all the things that go on in 

2942
02:18:42,121 --> 02:18:43,540
comparison to any other time of epoch,
any other time in history,

2943
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:47,800
and it seems that a lot of countries 
like China,

2944
02:18:47,801 --> 02:18:48,970
for example,
China,

2945
02:18:48,971 --> 02:18:51,550
yes,
rattles sort of Taiwan and things,

2946
02:18:51,551 --> 02:18:55,450
but China gains a great deal more from 
being an economic powerhouse.

2947
02:18:55,780 --> 02:18:59,890
Military Power House just isn't,
and I maintain this case with Iran.

2948
02:18:59,890 --> 02:19:04,890
Iran wants to Gemini,
Iran wants control over parts of the 

2949
02:19:04,890 --> 02:19:08,250
Middle East.
Iran has a lot of influence with the 

2950
02:19:08,250 --> 02:19:08,250
Shia,
the Shia,

2951
02:19:08,250 --> 02:19:08,250
Sunni schism in the Middle East,
et cetera.

2952
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:13,350
I think Iran gains a lot more and we 
could create incentives for Iran and we 

2953
02:19:13,350 --> 02:19:18,151
are trying to at least parts of the 
government or some people disagree with 

2954
02:19:18,151 --> 02:19:21,091
this.
I feel like if you created a situation 

2955
02:19:21,091 --> 02:19:25,231
where Iran saw that there was much more 
to be gained from joining the Economic 

2956
02:19:25,231 --> 02:19:29,460
Community and playing ball in accordance
with its laws is an in getting weapons 

2957
02:19:29,541 --> 02:19:32,600
of mass destructions.
They're all scared that those chicks are

2958
02:19:32,601 --> 02:19:34,790
going to find out they don't have to 
wear burkas in America.

2959
02:19:35,870 --> 02:19:40,870
Votes cover your come over on boats and 
then seek out black dick like a magnet,

2960
02:19:42,310 --> 02:19:47,310
like a magnet to steal filings.
Perhaps they're tired of being 

2961
02:19:47,310 --> 02:19:51,071
suppressed.
They want a torque on some dude in a 

2962
02:19:51,071 --> 02:19:51,071
club,
maybe no crazy,

2963
02:19:51,071 --> 02:19:52,160
funky religious outfit on and they can 
escape.

2964
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:53,450
You know why?
Because no one knows to fuck.

2965
02:19:53,451 --> 02:19:55,190
They look like they could just blend 
right in.

2966
02:19:55,220 --> 02:20:00,220
Good luck with your passport photo when 
it's looking through a fucking lit of a 

2967
02:20:00,220 --> 02:20:02,861
garbage can.
Like Oscar the grouch and that's who 

2968
02:20:02,861 --> 02:20:03,530
you're fucking passport.
It looks like you see your eyeballs.

2969
02:20:03,750 --> 02:20:08,750
I mean,
did they have to take this shit out for 

2970
02:20:08,750 --> 02:20:08,750
their passport?
Right?

2971
02:20:08,750 --> 02:20:08,750
Don't they?
Are they allowed to?

2972
02:20:08,750 --> 02:20:09,560
It's like stealing their soul or 
something.

2973
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:10,760
Right?
Well,

2974
02:20:10,910 --> 02:20:14,740
the minute that a lot of Saudi women go 
to places like London and quake,

2975
02:20:14,780 --> 02:20:17,160
guess what comes off immediately?
Their headrest,

2976
02:20:17,180 --> 02:20:22,180
the whole thing,
and I was shopping and they dress in 

2977
02:20:22,180 --> 02:20:22,670
sexy outfits and they're just like,
yeah,

2978
02:20:22,671 --> 02:20:27,671
cause see impression man.
It's just amazing that you've got 

2979
02:20:27,671 --> 02:20:30,821
countries that in 2015 still make women 
dressed like they're in star wars.

2980
02:20:32,841 --> 02:20:34,010
This is not a reason for it.

2981
02:20:34,370 --> 02:20:39,370
Another reason for it.
There was another very logical reason 

2982
02:20:39,370 --> 02:20:39,370
for it.
Logical.

2983
02:20:39,370 --> 02:20:39,370
Well,
I'm just saying if you're,

2984
02:20:39,370 --> 02:20:40,020
if you're,
if you're really,

2985
02:20:40,050 --> 02:20:43,660
if you're,
if you're just saying,

2986
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:48,200
if you're a religious man and if you are
trying to create a productive society,

2987
02:20:48,201 --> 02:20:52,790
the logic went.
If you have women walking around looking

2988
02:20:52,791 --> 02:20:56,510
all sexy and naked,
which was a lot of the Middle East,

2989
02:20:57,050 --> 02:21:02,050
well if you have that,
what happens is we're thinking about 

2990
02:21:02,050 --> 02:21:05,591
fucking not producing year.
So you've got to cover your chicks up.

2991
02:21:06,410 --> 02:21:08,240
Jasmine,
if she wanted to get any work done.

2992
02:21:08,450 --> 02:21:13,450
That's not true though.
I kurzweil miracle producers like a 

2993
02:21:13,450 --> 02:21:14,060
model for that.
How about that?

2994
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:17,300
Hot fruits over.
It's so true.

2995
02:21:17,390 --> 02:21:18,410
Freedom.
Freedom.

2996
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:20,810
Is that what she looked like?
Prince,

2997
02:21:20,870 --> 02:21:22,400
Princess Leia.
Is that a real body?

2998
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:23,210
Yeah.
Damn.

2999
02:21:23,230 --> 02:21:26,570
Should've banging body as she did.
That was real to those pre,

3000
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:28,160
pre sucking.

3001
02:21:28,190 --> 02:21:29,480
Tuck.
God bless her.

3002
02:21:29,700 --> 02:21:31,670
You know,
she didn't have no light pole,

3003
02:21:31,730 --> 02:21:34,040
couldn't look more board.
Um,

3004
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:36,680
she was beautiful at the time.
Very exotic.

3005
02:21:37,470 --> 02:21:41,330
Leo steelbrick made older brother 
remember that shit.

3006
02:21:41,540 --> 02:21:43,650
I love it.
She kissed her brother in Ellipsis tick.

3007
02:21:44,330 --> 02:21:45,930
Is that true?
It had to.

3008
02:21:46,550 --> 02:21:48,630
He didn't know that it was his sister.
That's rude.

3009
02:21:48,631 --> 02:21:53,631
Your sister comes and gives you a real 
kiss with a body like that since he got 

3010
02:21:53,631 --> 02:21:57,221
some unit.
She's even bother telling you that 

3011
02:21:57,221 --> 02:21:59,081
she's.
Did she know at the time that she knows 

3012
02:21:59,081 --> 02:21:59,081
she was?
No,

3013
02:21:59,081 --> 02:22:00,170
no one knew how to do a love scene when 
you were an actor back in the day.

3014
02:22:00,260 --> 02:22:02,180
I wasn't an actor.
I was never really an actor.

3015
02:22:02,181 --> 02:22:04,250
I did acting work.
I had to.

3016
02:22:04,370 --> 02:22:08,360
I had to do some serious love scenes.
Awkward and weird.

3017
02:22:08,361 --> 02:22:10,790
I bet man,
because I was awkward and weird as it is

3018
02:22:11,030 --> 02:22:13,730
being in a car with you for six hours 
trying to Turkey hunt.

3019
02:22:14,210 --> 02:22:14,930
How about that?
Huh?

3020
02:22:15,470 --> 02:22:16,430
We made time,
dude.

3021
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:18,560
We did have a good time.
We always have.

3022
02:22:18,660 --> 02:22:23,660
I will always haunt because it's just 
like white going has nothing to do with 

3023
02:22:23,660 --> 02:22:27,431
killing the animals.
For me it's I get to hang with you get 

3024
02:22:27,431 --> 02:22:27,431
to be idiots and laugh.

3025
02:22:27,431 --> 02:22:31,250
It was like I was saying like,
there's not a whole lot of dudes I'd 

3026
02:22:31,250 --> 02:22:31,250
asked to sleep in a tent,
you know?

3027
02:22:31,250 --> 02:22:31,290
Come on man.
We're going to go.

3028
02:22:31,470 --> 02:22:36,470
We're going to go to someplace like I'm 
calling my tv star famous comedian 

3029
02:22:36,470 --> 02:22:36,470
friend going,
come on,

3030
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:39,330
we're going to go.
We're going to sleep under the stars and

3031
02:22:39,331 --> 02:22:40,600
Montana,
Napa Valley.

3032
02:22:40,601 --> 02:22:44,010
We're going to go shoot deer and then 
we're going to eat them over a campfire.

3033
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:47,340
You in Turkey hunting was interesting.
I can't give it away,

3034
02:22:47,341 --> 02:22:50,760
but I will say that I killed between 
zero and 10 birds.

3035
02:22:51,090 --> 02:22:52,500
That's a good number.
You know,

3036
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:55,230
the Turkey hunting is very exciting.
It's fun,

3037
02:22:55,290 --> 02:22:58,730
but it.
The only issue that I have,

3038
02:22:58,731 --> 02:23:00,180
and I don't really have an issue with 
it,

3039
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:05,600
but the only thing that I would save,
it came to like preference of time that 

3040
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:05,600
I would spend hunting.

3041
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:07,950
I would spend less time,
Turkey hunting and more time doing other

3042
02:23:07,951 --> 02:23:11,880
things because the fact that you can't 
get anything more than a Turkey.

3043
02:23:12,320 --> 02:23:15,780
Yeah.
You stayed there all day.

3044
02:23:16,050 --> 02:23:19,260
You shoot this Turkey,
you've got one Turkey and that's great.

3045
02:23:19,261 --> 02:23:21,450
I mean there'll be delicious.
I'm sure I haven't cooked it yet.

3046
02:23:21,451 --> 02:23:26,451
I've got it in the open.
I told everybody I killed a Turkey or 

3047
02:23:26,451 --> 02:23:26,451
did you know this is where now I had a 
picture of it.

3048
02:23:26,451 --> 02:23:27,550
He put it on his instagram so I'm fine.
Um,

3049
02:23:27,870 --> 02:23:30,150
but it,
it's just a Turkey.

3050
02:23:30,670 --> 02:23:35,670
We tasted some of it.
We ate some Turkey and tasted like 

3051
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:35,670
Turkey.
It was good,

3052
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:39,860
but the breast tasted identical Turkey.
Apparently the legs are like a little 

3053
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:43,881
tougher and the one that I got was 
apparently a good one to eat because it 

3054
02:23:43,881 --> 02:23:47,511
was fairly young and those are like more
10 called Jake wasn't a top a jake and 

3055
02:23:48,091 --> 02:23:49,170
um,
they just don't.

3056
02:23:49,230 --> 02:23:50,340
Here's the deal,
you know,

3057
02:23:50,341 --> 02:23:52,080
there's not that much food there,
you know,

3058
02:23:52,100 --> 02:23:55,830
it's like it'll feed a family and then 
maybe you might have sandwiches the next

3059
02:23:55,830 --> 02:23:57,090
day.
If you shoot a deer,

3060
02:23:57,091 --> 02:24:02,091
like if you go out and you shoot a deer 
and you spend those those nights 

3061
02:24:02,091 --> 02:24:03,570
sleeping in the tent in Montana and 
you're successful,

3062
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:08,290
you're kind of come back with 50 or 60 
pounds of meat credible.

3063
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:13,380
I mean you've got backstraps and loins 
and Burger and you're making sausage out

3064
02:24:13,381 --> 02:24:16,980
of it and you got just butchering it.
Just portraying it as a bitch.

3065
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:21,120
We did it for her,
we butchered it and we joked around.

3066
02:24:21,121 --> 02:24:25,350
We had a great time or that Moose.
See if I shoot one of those that moves,

3067
02:24:25,351 --> 02:24:27,000
I'm going to be eating.
That moves forever.

3068
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:32,030
One of the greatest pictures I've ever 
seen that picture and the fade or 

3069
02:24:32,030 --> 02:24:34,950
picture with kettlebells are the two 
pictures I use in my fantasy violence.

3070
02:24:34,980 --> 02:24:35,550
Well,
this is.

3071
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:36,600
Listen this,
that,

3072
02:24:36,630 --> 02:24:41,190
that picture is like what it means to 
eat animals.

3073
02:24:41,490 --> 02:24:44,610
That is a moose leg.
I don't know how much that way,

3074
02:24:44,611 --> 02:24:48,210
but it was heavy as 100 pounds.
Well over 100 pounds.

3075
02:24:48,340 --> 02:24:51,170
Well over a hundred pounds.
What was the 900 pound Moose?

3076
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:53,970
Which isn't even that big.
Look at that.

3077
02:24:53,971 --> 02:24:58,230
My phoner Ben.
He shot one that was about 1400 pounds.

3078
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:01,500
Was much bigger than mine.
It's huge antlers.

3079
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:05,850
It was ridiculous,
but that moves is going to feed me for a

3080
02:25:05,850 --> 02:25:09,330
year to come over here.
Come on.

3081
02:25:09,380 --> 02:25:10,620
Okay.
Do you have good cuts?

3082
02:25:10,650 --> 02:25:11,220
Yeah.
Well,

3083
02:25:11,230 --> 02:25:13,320
I'll let me show you how to cook it 
because it's not easy.

3084
02:25:13,690 --> 02:25:15,750
It's a different thing.
It's different than dear.

3085
02:25:15,910 --> 02:25:18,420
This gladiator animal that you're 
eating,

3086
02:25:18,860 --> 02:25:20,970
like first of all,
when you eat the meat,

3087
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:26,120
I'm going to have you over come over to 
the house and you and I will sit down 

3088
02:25:26,120 --> 02:25:26,650
and have a meal together,
Cook you a real moose steak.

3089
02:25:26,860 --> 02:25:28,300
You're going to eat it and I'll bring 
the one.

3090
02:25:28,340 --> 02:25:29,860
You're going to be like,
Holy Shit,

3091
02:25:30,070 --> 02:25:31,930
because it makes you.
It's almost like a stimulant.

3092
02:25:32,590 --> 02:25:35,470
There's so much energy in that meat.
Listen,

3093
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:39,670
I've done that with deer meat.
I ate deer meat every day for 10 days.

3094
02:25:39,671 --> 02:25:42,220
I am telling you,
and I'm not hokey.

3095
02:25:42,670 --> 02:25:44,300
You get,
you get it.

3096
02:25:44,350 --> 02:25:46,180
You get a rush.
Like I had an.

3097
02:25:46,270 --> 02:25:49,030
I had an extra kick in my,
in my body.

3098
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:51,070
It only makes sense if you look at their
body.

3099
02:25:51,190 --> 02:25:56,190
Their flesh is so healthy,
like their tissue is so rich and red and

3100
02:25:56,231 --> 02:25:56,870
dark.
Yeah.

3101
02:25:57,070 --> 02:26:02,070
Like you're dealing with an extremely 
healthy animal that is surviving against

3102
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:04,540
really hardcore predators.
I mean,

3103
02:26:04,541 --> 02:26:07,000
it's running away from mountain lions 
and wolves.

3104
02:26:07,001 --> 02:26:10,210
Like this is existence for a moose.
It's wolf packs.

3105
02:26:10,270 --> 02:26:15,270
If you make it from the time you're a 
calf to the time you're a full grown 

3106
02:26:15,270 --> 02:26:15,270
moves.

3107
02:26:15,270 --> 02:26:19,980
Good luck.
We never started that picture that I 

3108
02:26:19,980 --> 02:26:22,531
had.
We came across one that had been torn 

3109
02:26:22,531 --> 02:26:22,531
apart by wolves.
No.

3110
02:26:22,531 --> 02:26:23,620
Yeah,
well we were up there hunting.

3111
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:26,290
We came across a moose calf.
Wow.

3112
02:26:26,291 --> 02:26:27,020
When we're,
we're,

3113
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:32,040
we're actually moose hunting and uh,
this thing had been torn apart Europe 

3114
02:26:32,081 --> 02:26:33,520
and wolf country.
Oh yeah.

3115
02:26:33,820 --> 02:26:38,820
Not only was I opened wolf country,
I was up in a place where they don't 

3116
02:26:38,820 --> 02:26:40,000
even have a limit on how many wolves you
can kill because they're just so many.

3117
02:26:40,001 --> 02:26:42,190
They want you to kill wolves all day 
dam.

3118
02:26:42,250 --> 02:26:45,200
They want you to set up bait.
You can do whatever you want.

3119
02:26:45,210 --> 02:26:50,210
There's such a motherfucker,
there's just such a motherfucker and 

3120
02:26:50,210 --> 02:26:50,210
there's,
they don't have a handle on them at all.

3121
02:26:50,210 --> 02:26:50,670
The guy that I lived up there,
uh,

3122
02:26:50,700 --> 02:26:52,540
the state of displays,
brother that lives up there,

3123
02:26:52,930 --> 02:26:56,830
he's neighbor lost a cow to a wolf.

3124
02:26:56,920 --> 02:26:57,610
Well,
when we were,

3125
02:26:57,611 --> 02:27:00,400
when we were in Napa vow,
we were in Napa Valley,

3126
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:04,740
the farmers I was talking to,
they used to keep emos emos like,

3127
02:27:04,870 --> 02:27:09,870
which are miniature ostriches and lambs 
and said the mountain lions wreak havoc.

3128
02:27:10,751 --> 02:27:14,320
The mountain lion would come in and pull
those emails over the fence,

3129
02:27:14,321 --> 02:27:19,321
the seven foot fence,
and they just find feathers on the top 

3130
02:27:19,321 --> 02:27:22,921
of the fence that goes our emo and lambs
to just eat the shit out of land where 

3131
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:24,970
the place where you and I were standing 
up in.

3132
02:27:25,230 --> 02:27:26,240
That's where it was.
Yeah.

3133
02:27:26,260 --> 02:27:31,260
The place where you and I were staying,
they they've lost all their sheep to 

3134
02:27:31,260 --> 02:27:31,260
mountain lions,
mountain lions,

3135
02:27:31,260 --> 02:27:36,060
this farm that we were at,
I mean they had all these cows and shit 

3136
02:27:36,060 --> 02:27:38,521
and they think about you have to survive
the winter and a mountain lion and 

3137
02:27:38,521 --> 02:27:40,180
wolves or you'll start hating mountain 
lions and wolves content.

3138
02:27:40,250 --> 02:27:43,150
There's a totally different idea that 
you and I have about them.

3139
02:27:43,151 --> 02:27:44,440
Like you know,
you look at a wolf,

3140
02:27:44,441 --> 02:27:45,550
you look at it,
it's like a dog.

3141
02:27:46,060 --> 02:27:47,710
They don't.
That's not a dog to them.

3142
02:27:47,740 --> 02:27:50,290
That's a danger of starvation thing,
that starvation.

3143
02:27:50,291 --> 02:27:55,291
It's a dangerous fucking thing.
I'm trying to find when you're in the 

3144
02:27:55,291 --> 02:27:55,291
frontier and we'll take care of all your
livestock.

3145
02:27:55,291 --> 02:27:58,210
You and your kids couldn't eat.
Yeah,

3146
02:27:58,211 --> 02:27:58,750
man.
Well,

3147
02:27:58,751 --> 02:28:00,040
it's.
It hasn't been.

3148
02:28:00,041 --> 02:28:00,910
Okay.
I found the pictures.

3149
02:28:01,060 --> 02:28:06,060
It hasn't been that long ago that human 
beings really had to worry about wolves.

3150
02:28:06,251 --> 02:28:09,340
That's why those big bad wolf and all 
those different,

3151
02:28:10,020 --> 02:28:10,480
you know,
those,

3152
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:13,150
those legends go on in Europe.
That's what we're found.

3153
02:28:13,300 --> 02:28:18,300
That was probably.
We had gotten there probably the night 

3154
02:28:18,300 --> 02:28:21,290
after or they still have like lots of 
meat on it.

3155
02:28:21,820 --> 02:28:22,400
Yeah.

3156
02:28:22,410 --> 02:28:27,410
And what you didn't expect.
What I didn't expect was the hair 

3157
02:28:27,410 --> 02:28:27,410
everywhere.
Oh,

3158
02:28:27,410 --> 02:28:29,900
that's stuff that you see on the ground.
And that picture jamie could pull it up.

3159
02:28:29,901 --> 02:28:31,650
It's on my instance care.
Find A,

3160
02:28:32,190 --> 02:28:32,850
a,
um,

3161
02:28:33,010 --> 02:28:34,640
a,
a body of a moose calf.

3162
02:28:34,641 --> 02:28:37,380
It's from four or five months ago.
The,

3163
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:37,840
um,
the,

3164
02:28:38,600 --> 02:28:40,150
the legs still has,
you know,

3165
02:28:40,151 --> 02:28:41,300
there's still,
they would come back,

3166
02:28:41,301 --> 02:28:46,301
they're probably going to come back and 
finish off the rest or they were just 

3167
02:28:46,301 --> 02:28:47,300
full and they were going to go somewhere
else and get something else,

3168
02:28:47,301 --> 02:28:48,950
but they always know where it is.
They'll come back.

3169
02:28:49,130 --> 02:28:51,100
Where was that?
That was NBC.

3170
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:52,820
Like northern British Columbia.
Yeah.

3171
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:57,210
Do when you meet people at the airport?
Just A,

3172
02:28:57,450 --> 02:29:02,450
just a random guy at the airport saw 
that I had a cammo jacket on and asked 

3173
02:29:02,450 --> 02:29:03,740
me if I was hunting to talk to me about 
how much he likes to kill wolves.

3174
02:29:05,310 --> 02:29:07,100
These city people,
they just don't understand.

3175
02:29:07,101 --> 02:29:07,570
You know,
the,

3176
02:29:07,580 --> 02:29:12,580
they lived down there in Vancouver and 
they're making all the laws for up here 

3177
02:29:12,580 --> 02:29:12,580
and you know,
we're,

3178
02:29:12,580 --> 02:29:14,570
we're the ones who have to hear them 
howl and you know,

3179
02:29:14,580 --> 02:29:19,580
and wonder how many of them there are 
out there and they kill your livestock 

3180
02:29:19,580 --> 02:29:22,280
and they kill your dogs and the 
different perspective.

3181
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:24,050
They're wolves.
Like the movies,

3182
02:29:24,051 --> 02:29:26,960
like Little Red Riding Hood.
Look out little girl.

3183
02:29:26,961 --> 02:29:30,990
Don't go off in the woods alone because 
there's wolves out there too.

3184
02:29:31,540 --> 02:29:33,430
They're so smart.
They know.

3185
02:29:33,560 --> 02:29:38,550
What's our next Honda we're going to on 
to know we could pay current.

3186
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:43,720
You know what I was thinking?
I was thinking we should go go caribou 

3187
02:29:43,720 --> 02:29:44,180
hunting.
Oh cool.

3188
02:29:44,390 --> 02:29:47,860
We'll call Alaska us too cold to going 
in.

3189
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:49,850
You're going in August.
I'll go then.

3190
02:29:50,060 --> 02:29:51,310
Yeah,
they migrate in August.

3191
02:29:51,340 --> 02:29:54,560
Right.
What about before that?

3192
02:29:54,590 --> 02:29:56,450
I don't know.
We'll figure someone to kill a pig up.

3193
02:29:56,451 --> 02:29:57,230
Oh,
you're crazy.

3194
02:29:57,231 --> 02:29:59,090
You're violent.
What happened to you?

3195
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:00,340
I want to eat a pig.
Oh,

3196
02:30:00,410 --> 02:30:01,680
I need some pig and eat them.
I love.

3197
02:30:01,750 --> 02:30:03,540
I still have some from the pig I shot.
You do?

3198
02:30:03,570 --> 02:30:04,510
Yeah.
I'll cook some.

3199
02:30:04,530 --> 02:30:08,900
At the House I made a ham,
like maybe you still have all my hunting

3200
02:30:08,901 --> 02:30:10,470
gear or your house.
Some of you.

3201
02:30:11,570 --> 02:30:13,400
I made a ham.
That's us were Turkey hunting.

3202
02:30:13,700 --> 02:30:17,660
Look if you look at me,
but I made this ham that I a slow,

3203
02:30:17,661 --> 02:30:20,480
a slow cooked on the smoker for like 
six,

3204
02:30:20,481 --> 02:30:25,481
seven hours.
I brightened it for like four or five 

3205
02:30:25,481 --> 02:30:26,390
days.
Chase Brian it like he'll take ice,

3206
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:30,050
put it in a cooler.
You take this bronx mostly like salt and

3207
02:30:30,051 --> 02:30:35,051
sugar and some spices and you dunk this 
ham in there and then surround 

3208
02:30:35,091 --> 02:30:38,990
everything with ice and put it in like a
Yeti cooler and then look at that.

3209
02:30:39,590 --> 02:30:44,590
Wow.
You're getting to be quite the meat 

3210
02:30:44,590 --> 02:30:47,561
cooker.
I'm getting good at cooking meat like 

3211
02:30:47,561 --> 02:30:47,561
I've.
I'm no chef.

3212
02:30:47,561 --> 02:30:47,750
I don't have skills.
I don't know what I'm doing,

3213
02:30:48,020 --> 02:30:50,900
but I do know how to smoke me.
I knew how to grill steaks.

3214
02:30:51,020 --> 02:30:54,170
I cooked a written out last night.
Yeah,

3215
02:30:54,171 --> 02:30:57,830
he's like a real chef.
Like he could be like a real chef.

3216
02:30:57,890 --> 02:31:02,890
I tell people he made me beaver.
I said some of the best meals I've ever 

3217
02:31:02,890 --> 02:31:02,890
had.
Get out of here.

3218
02:31:02,890 --> 02:31:04,760
Those are some.
Those are some ribs that I cooked.

3219
02:31:04,840 --> 02:31:06,560
I was.
You're so funny that you post.

3220
02:31:06,680 --> 02:31:08,060
I always.
I finally went in instagram.

3221
02:31:08,061 --> 02:31:11,600
Obviously posting meat.
That's where cooked last night.

3222
02:31:11,660 --> 02:31:16,660
Cowboy cut of goodbye.
That was when his son that's artwork to 

3223
02:31:16,660 --> 02:31:16,660
me.
Is that boosie?

3224
02:31:16,660 --> 02:31:17,450
No,
that's Ribeye steak.

3225
02:31:17,650 --> 02:31:18,780
Could,
that's a regular steak.

3226
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:22,500
I got a cowboy cut a big thick.

3227
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:24,870
It was probably like maybe three inches 
thick.

3228
02:31:25,050 --> 02:31:29,700
At least one to two and a half.
Maybe it was a fat thick one where I had

3229
02:31:29,701 --> 02:31:31,860
to use a thermometer to cook it.
So,

3230
02:31:31,861 --> 02:31:33,660
uh,
I cook it on the outside.

3231
02:31:33,690 --> 02:31:36,480
You see are the outside on these things 
called Grill grates.

3232
02:31:36,810 --> 02:31:38,730
I gotta I gotTa show you the smoker I 
got.

3233
02:31:39,290 --> 02:31:41,040
It's a yoder.
It's,

3234
02:31:41,041 --> 02:31:41,460
uh,
it,

3235
02:31:41,510 --> 02:31:46,510
it,
it uses direct heat as well as indirect 

3236
02:31:46,510 --> 02:31:46,510
heat.
You ever seen those things?

3237
02:31:46,510 --> 02:31:47,280
Those pellet smokers know?
Well,

3238
02:31:47,281 --> 02:31:52,281
this one you can sear it on one side.
Then you move it over to the other side 

3239
02:31:52,281 --> 02:31:52,320
and then you just leave the temperature 
of what you want it.

3240
02:31:52,321 --> 02:31:57,321
For me it was like 400 degrees,
so I dropped it down to 400 degrees and 

3241
02:31:57,321 --> 02:31:58,080
I have a thermometer in it.
It's tells me when the temperature,

3242
02:31:58,081 --> 02:32:01,590
the internal temperature hits like 1:25
and then I watch it carefully.

3243
02:32:01,590 --> 02:32:02,880
Took it to be about 1:30
in there,

3244
02:32:02,910 --> 02:32:05,760
pop that bitch out and let it sit for 
roasting it.

3245
02:32:06,360 --> 02:32:09,120
You're starting off grilling it.
You're starting enough grilling.

3246
02:32:09,150 --> 02:32:12,340
It's direct fire like fire literally 
below these greats.

3247
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:14,820
Yeah,
and you see are the shit out of it.

3248
02:32:15,270 --> 02:32:16,800
I don't mean the shit out of it.
You don't want to burn it,

3249
02:32:17,130 --> 02:32:20,610
but you want to sear it for.
Depending upon the thickness of the meat

3250
02:32:20,700 --> 02:32:22,510
and the temperature that you're searing 
it.

3251
02:32:22,700 --> 02:32:27,700
I don't do it for more than like two and
a half minutes aside and I just really 

3252
02:32:27,700 --> 02:32:28,650
just like cooked the outside,
you know,

3253
02:32:28,651 --> 02:32:31,410
you're,
you're burning off any possible bacteria

3254
02:32:31,411 --> 02:32:33,720
that's on the outside.
You get a nice crust and a good,

3255
02:32:34,220 --> 02:32:37,530
like a delicious,
like top area of it where it's like real

3256
02:32:37,531 --> 02:32:42,531
crispy and you got like kosher salt and 
black pepper and a little bit of garlic 

3257
02:32:42,531 --> 02:32:42,720
powder.

3258
02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:45,870
I mix on there and I let it sit for like
an hour before I put it on the grill.

3259
02:32:46,020 --> 02:32:47,570
It's an art form to.
It magnifies.

3260
02:32:47,780 --> 02:32:50,520
It is because like I,
I put post pictures of it because I like

3261
02:32:50,521 --> 02:32:51,540
when other people do too,
like,

3262
02:32:51,880 --> 02:32:54,180
like looking at people's instagrams and 
shit that they're making.

3263
02:32:54,560 --> 02:32:59,560
My,
my father in law can cook the greatest 

3264
02:32:59,560 --> 02:33:02,211
stakes.
He put Hughes's hickory chips and he 

3265
02:33:02,211 --> 02:33:04,260
smokes it that way on the.
Well he's just a master with a grill.

3266
02:33:04,330 --> 02:33:06,780
I try to replicate replicated.
I just can't do it.

3267
02:33:06,860 --> 02:33:08,580
There's two different styles of cooking 
steaks.

3268
02:33:08,581 --> 02:33:10,530
Like some people like the Argentine 
style,

3269
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:13,920
which is like a slow grill.
Slow and low.

3270
02:33:13,980 --> 02:33:18,980
They'll cook like a steak slowly.
I like my meat to be a little raw 

3271
02:33:18,980 --> 02:33:19,310
though.
Like rare.

3272
02:33:19,410 --> 02:33:20,430
No,
but I mean they don't.

3273
02:33:20,460 --> 02:33:22,200
I mean they can certainly still cook it 
rare.

3274
02:33:22,230 --> 02:33:24,680
They just cook it at a low temperature.
They don't like,

3275
02:33:25,330 --> 02:33:27,360
like American style grilling a steak,
you know,

3276
02:33:27,361 --> 02:33:32,361
you see that stake hit the thing and you
flip it or you move it a little and then

3277
02:33:33,030 --> 02:33:38,030
you flip it and then you push it off to 
the side and you always put the lid on 

3278
02:33:38,030 --> 02:33:41,631
it and you let it rest.
Like you got to let it sit like you 

3279
02:33:41,631 --> 02:33:44,601
grill the top of it.
But unless it's a really thin steak 

3280
02:33:44,601 --> 02:33:45,090
that's not going to really get the 
center where you want it.

3281
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:47,940
It'll be really rare in the center.
So what you do is you put it like if you

3282
02:33:47,941 --> 02:33:49,300
have a,
um,

3283
02:33:49,350 --> 02:33:52,260
like either one of those Weber's or I 
have a Kamado,

3284
02:33:52,590 --> 02:33:57,590
you put a top layer lever to it so that 
the heat is not really underneath and 

3285
02:33:57,590 --> 02:34:02,031
anymore cooking it from the bottom.
It's cooking all around it and then you 

3286
02:34:02,031 --> 02:34:05,151
put it on the top,
close the lid and it'll drop down like 

3287
02:34:05,151 --> 02:34:05,151
maybe 350 degrees or somewhere around 
there.

3288
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:07,560
And then you cook it slowly for the 
next,

3289
02:34:07,561 --> 02:34:09,930
like depending upon the thickness of the
steak,

3290
02:34:09,931 --> 02:34:14,931
I don't usually like to go more than 
five minutes and then I pull it off of 

3291
02:34:14,931 --> 02:34:17,691
there.
So what I've done is I've seen her the 

3292
02:34:17,691 --> 02:34:18,310
shit out of the outside with like really
odd flames and a hot grill

3293
02:34:18,310 --> 02:34:22,420
grate and it's.
Everything is just like really cooking.

3294
02:34:22,421 --> 02:34:25,690
The outside of it would then slow 
cooking it after that.

3295
02:34:25,691 --> 02:34:27,330
So you get that.
They do it all kinds of stuff.

3296
02:34:27,331 --> 02:34:28,480
On the outside.
I had,

3297
02:34:28,481 --> 02:34:33,481
I had a big stake in Utah where they,
they put it in a plastic bag and they 

3298
02:34:34,120 --> 02:34:35,370
boil it.
Oh yeah,

3299
02:34:35,371 --> 02:34:38,260
yeah.
That's a new thing that God damn.

3300
02:34:38,261 --> 02:34:43,261
It was good.
That's the thing that snake river farms 

3301
02:34:43,261 --> 02:34:43,261
is really popular right now.
They're,

3302
02:34:43,261 --> 02:34:47,631
they're,
they have new ones that they sell that 

3303
02:34:47,631 --> 02:34:48,190
you put like you put a pot of water,
you know,

3304
02:34:48,191 --> 02:34:52,090
and then you stick this heater element 
in it and it cooks it for you.

3305
02:34:52,091 --> 02:34:53,350
You just sit it on the,
on the,

3306
02:34:53,351 --> 02:34:55,960
on the counter,
but it's not the sitter on your stove,

3307
02:34:55,961 --> 02:34:57,400
but it's not the stove that took cooking
it.

3308
02:34:57,580 --> 02:35:01,180
It's this device that you have in the 
water so it'll keep the water steady.

3309
02:35:01,210 --> 02:35:03,220
Hundred and 35 degrees,
which is like medium,

3310
02:35:03,250 --> 02:35:08,250
medium rare.
So you would just do that and it would 

3311
02:35:08,250 --> 02:35:08,250
cook it perfectly.
Like you couldn't fuck it up.

3312
02:35:08,250 --> 02:35:12,991
It couldn't overcook and then you take 
it and they cook the outside of it with 

3313
02:35:12,991 --> 02:35:13,900
like a torch.
Right.

3314
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:18,960
I could take a butane torch and they 
crispy sear or the outside of it and 

3315
02:35:18,960 --> 02:35:18,960
it's supposed to be amazing.
Yeah,

3316
02:35:18,960 --> 02:35:20,590
I've had it.
It's incredible.

3317
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:25,680
I don't like that shit though.
I had a wagon was sent to me from snake 

3318
02:35:26,651 --> 02:35:29,130
river farms,
which apparently like I went to Mastro's

3319
02:35:29,140 --> 02:35:29,680
and God goes,
well,

3320
02:35:29,681 --> 02:35:32,890
snake river farms is the best dude.
I don't know what they do there.

3321
02:35:32,891 --> 02:35:34,150
I don't know what they do at those cows.
I,

3322
02:35:34,151 --> 02:35:36,100
I'm,
I'm just telling you is the best steak.

3323
02:35:36,470 --> 02:35:41,470
I.
It's better than Venice spending 

3324
02:35:41,470 --> 02:35:43,200
anything you might like.
Different things that I like because 

3325
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:43,200
I've,
I've tried that Wagyu.

3326
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:45,600
I've given a bunch of tries.
I've had coby fatty tissue,

3327
02:35:45,601 --> 02:35:49,000
fatty I liked about this is what I like 
about like that,

3328
02:35:49,180 --> 02:35:52,540
that I'm what the fuck tri tip that we 
had.

3329
02:35:52,570 --> 02:35:54,670
I like lean to.
I'm more of a lean guy.

3330
02:35:54,671 --> 02:35:57,160
I don't like a lot of fat and this was.
This was an exception.

3331
02:35:57,400 --> 02:36:01,150
Maybe they're just the preparation.
The chef just nailed it now because they

3332
02:36:01,151 --> 02:36:06,151
sent me my own stakes and I just cooked 
it and fucking butter and I was just 

3333
02:36:06,151 --> 02:36:07,560
still like the best steak I've ever had.
Well,

3334
02:36:07,561 --> 02:36:09,400
I'll give it another shot.
I've had it before.

3335
02:36:09,401 --> 02:36:10,760
I didn't like it.
I felt like I was eating.

3336
02:36:11,180 --> 02:36:13,540
I'll call them the guy.
I think I know the guy.

3337
02:36:13,640 --> 02:36:18,640
I'll have him send you some steaks.
I felt like I was eating a bedridden 

3338
02:36:18,640 --> 02:36:18,790
patient.
If you took a cow stuff,

3339
02:36:18,820 --> 02:36:23,820
froot loops,
duck fat face and getting drunk every 

3340
02:36:23,820 --> 02:36:23,820
night and then killed it.

3341
02:36:23,820 --> 02:36:24,130
I'm curious what you think of this snake
rivers.

3342
02:36:24,350 --> 02:36:25,690
Well,
I'll try and have it to a size.

3343
02:36:25,691 --> 02:36:27,880
Apparently there are these day are like,
there's,

3344
02:36:27,970 --> 02:36:31,540
there's other places that do Wagyu and 
then the snake river farms.

3345
02:36:31,541 --> 02:36:32,770
Like everybody,
everybody who's in the,

3346
02:36:32,890 --> 02:36:33,910
they all say,
well that's,

3347
02:36:34,010 --> 02:36:37,380
that's the Cadillac.
That's the Mercedes Ferrari of snakes.

3348
02:36:37,420 --> 02:36:39,460
Again,
another Japanese invention,

3349
02:36:39,461 --> 02:36:41,620
those slick bastards.
Robin with peer,

3350
02:36:41,621 --> 02:36:43,540
don't they?
And they do all kinds of weird shit with

3351
02:36:43,541 --> 02:36:45,040
the cow.
They don't let it move.

3352
02:36:45,800 --> 02:36:47,170
Nice.
The whole culture,

3353
02:36:47,171 --> 02:36:52,171
when you think about one small island,
just thinking about what they did to 

3354
02:36:52,171 --> 02:36:54,721
revolutionize the car industry,
they made cars reliable with insane,

3355
02:36:55,870 --> 02:36:57,200
with insane,
um,

3356
02:36:57,400 --> 02:37:02,400
cooperation.
And I'll give you an example with fully 

3357
02:37:02,400 --> 02:37:02,400
contemplated a plant.
This is back in the day.

3358
02:37:02,400 --> 02:37:04,780
This was 20 years ago in twitter 
company.

3359
02:37:04,781 --> 02:37:09,781
They could start from,
from when they started with the one 

3360
02:37:09,781 --> 02:37:13,590
piece that was,
they were going to put the car together 

3361
02:37:13,590 --> 02:37:13,590
on the assembly line.

3362
02:37:13,590 --> 02:37:15,750
It took five minutes to assemble an 
entire Toyota dollars.

3363
02:37:15,770 --> 02:37:20,770
You take 10 guys,
just make sure the bolts are tightened 

3364
02:37:20,770 --> 02:37:20,770
down.
What the fuck man,

3365
02:37:20,770 --> 02:37:24,440
don't rush my car.
No bolts on five minutes.

3366
02:37:24,500 --> 02:37:26,450
That seems like a little quick.
Maybe.

3367
02:37:26,451 --> 02:37:28,040
Slow down.
I think so,

3368
02:37:28,041 --> 02:37:33,041
but they have it down to a science.
They always say that Japan was so 

3369
02:37:33,041 --> 02:37:36,881
heavily influenced by one factor,
a lot of people in a very small area and

3370
02:37:37,671 --> 02:37:42,671
it required a great deal of cooperation,
but even more importantly because of 

3371
02:37:43,161 --> 02:37:44,820
typhoons,
their,

3372
02:37:44,950 --> 02:37:49,950
their,
their architecture was made from rice 

3373
02:37:49,950 --> 02:37:51,650
because you didn't want a wind to blow 
stone on you and die.

3374
02:37:51,980 --> 02:37:53,730
So the reason that the origami,
like,

3375
02:37:53,750 --> 02:37:55,820
you know,
they have like sliding glass doors and I

3376
02:37:55,821 --> 02:37:57,160
mean paper,
a lot of their,

3377
02:37:57,230 --> 02:37:59,900
their houses were made if the inside was
made of paper.

3378
02:37:59,901 --> 02:38:03,110
Well the problem with that is when you 
have walls that separate you,

3379
02:38:03,111 --> 02:38:08,111
that are made of paper,
you can hear what goes on in the room 

3380
02:38:08,111 --> 02:38:10,640
next to you and if you have a couple 
that's fucking or whatever,

3381
02:38:10,641 --> 02:38:14,870
or crying or arguing,
now you're privy to their business.

3382
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:20,290
And what that did was they said,
how are we going to run a society like 

3383
02:38:20,290 --> 02:38:20,290
this?
This is weird.

3384
02:38:20,290 --> 02:38:20,580
I mean,
I,

3385
02:38:21,150 --> 02:38:23,810
I,
I know he's listening to me and then I'm

3386
02:38:23,811 --> 02:38:28,811
listening to him and what a lot of 
social scientists talk about is this 

3387
02:38:28,811 --> 02:38:32,351
idea that the Japanese got super good at
actively not hearing things they're not 

3388
02:38:33,921 --> 02:38:37,680
supposed to and it was like this sort of
social contract where,

3389
02:38:37,740 --> 02:38:42,740
first of all,
you never mentioned that you heard 

3390
02:38:42,740 --> 02:38:42,740
anything.
Second of all,

3391
02:38:42,740 --> 02:38:43,070
you didn't even gossip because you 
didn't hear it.

3392
02:38:43,180 --> 02:38:44,700
Hi.
Hi.

3393
02:38:44,980 --> 02:38:46,180
Hi.
Hi.

3394
02:38:46,620 --> 02:38:49,810
Hi.
Hi.

3395
02:38:50,170 --> 02:38:51,910
Not Listening.
I'm not listening.

3396
02:38:51,970 --> 02:38:53,530
I am jacking off.
I'm not listening.

3397
02:38:53,531 --> 02:38:58,531
What a bizarre culture that they 
exhibited so many unique traits and 

3398
02:38:59,771 --> 02:39:02,890
characteristics and at so many unique 
strengths.

3399
02:39:03,490 --> 02:39:04,870
You know,
I mean if you,

3400
02:39:05,110 --> 02:39:10,110
if you think about their contributions 
just to martial arts alone for one 

3401
02:39:10,110 --> 02:39:10,690
island like that,
it's unprecedented.

3402
02:39:10,990 --> 02:39:12,160
I mean,
the other island,

3403
02:39:12,161 --> 02:39:17,161
I mean Brazil is obviously an enormous 
country and there they had a massive 

3404
02:39:17,161 --> 02:39:19,150
influence on as well.
Holland is a small country.

3405
02:39:19,151 --> 02:39:24,151
They had a massive influence on 
kickboxing and Muay Thai and on the 

3406
02:39:24,401 --> 02:39:27,260
economy of the world.
I mean a lot of,

3407
02:39:27,610 --> 02:39:32,610
a lot of,
a lot of that day they're an economic 

3408
02:39:32,610 --> 02:39:35,551
powerhouse responsible for setting up 
shop in Africa and and I believe in a 

3409
02:39:36,401 --> 02:39:41,401
place called New York and that's right.
If the kit there,

3410
02:39:44,460 --> 02:39:46,780
I was just there.
I was confused.

3411
02:39:47,050 --> 02:39:48,710
Denmark.
Holly Hallmark.

3412
02:39:48,940 --> 02:39:50,900
The Netherlands is the same as 
volunteer.

3413
02:39:51,060 --> 02:39:52,300
Yeah.
All of that area.

3414
02:39:52,360 --> 02:39:54,040
You can fuck up.
You're a Dane.

3415
02:39:54,070 --> 02:39:55,760
You're from Denmark.
What does that mean now you.

3416
02:39:55,950 --> 02:39:57,270
Okay.
Are You Dutch?

3417
02:39:57,530 --> 02:39:59,440
English,
history from the Netherlands.

3418
02:39:59,441 --> 02:40:00,900
You're Dutch.
You're here from how I.

3419
02:40:00,910 --> 02:40:05,910
it's always confusing,
but they also figured out we'd and 

3420
02:40:05,910 --> 02:40:05,910
hookers a long time ago.
They're great.

3421
02:40:05,910 --> 02:40:06,940
They figured out a lot of shit.
They're like,

3422
02:40:06,941 --> 02:40:11,941
let's just like how about you just get 
tested and do whatever you want to do 

3423
02:40:11,941 --> 02:40:15,661
and the only issue with the Japanese is 
their challenge has always been 

3424
02:40:15,661 --> 02:40:15,661
innovation.

3425
02:40:15,661 --> 02:40:16,710
Like they're really good at mimicry and 
making things better,

3426
02:40:17,070 --> 02:40:22,070
but as far as.
And the reason for that is because of 

3427
02:40:22,070 --> 02:40:24,891
the way their society is structured so 
that if you are someone who comes up 

3428
02:40:24,891 --> 02:40:25,410
with a better way to do something,
then your boss,

3429
02:40:25,440 --> 02:40:29,070
your boss would lose face.
And so that's why a lot of things stayed

3430
02:40:29,100 --> 02:40:31,440
rather stagnant.
Even though they were good.

3431
02:40:31,800 --> 02:40:34,270
It was very hard for them to sort of 
keep up with the in.

3432
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:37,530
So not as much innovation comes out of 
Japan.

3433
02:40:37,531 --> 02:40:40,020
They don't really have a silicon valley 
the way we do.

3434
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:41,260
Uh,
and that's,

3435
02:40:41,261 --> 02:40:46,261
uh,
that's an interesting way of describing 

3436
02:40:46,261 --> 02:40:48,981
it.
If you have a boss and you go out to 

3437
02:40:48,981 --> 02:40:50,460
drink the boss strings,
a higher higher caliber whiskey than you

3438
02:40:50,461 --> 02:40:55,461
do really,
cutty Sark and you'll drink something 

3439
02:40:55,461 --> 02:40:56,580
shithead,
give up the good booze son.

3440
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:58,230
This man,
come on Bro,

3441
02:40:58,231 --> 02:40:59,130
you make more money.

3442
02:40:59,320 --> 02:41:01,430
He's up.
Come on,

3443
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:03,300
we work together.
Let's be friends here.

3444
02:41:04,200 --> 02:41:09,200
And also very chauvinistic.
But they did some amazing improvements 

3445
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:13,701
on existing things.
Like that's what their unique 

3446
02:41:13,701 --> 02:41:14,070
characteristic,
their unique traits,

3447
02:41:14,440 --> 02:41:18,480
especially when it comes to automobiles,
automobile electronics,

3448
02:41:18,481 --> 02:41:23,481
phonics,
like the NSX forced Ferrari and Porsche 

3449
02:41:23,481 --> 02:41:27,921
to change the way they were making cars.
Like they came out with this fucking 

3450
02:41:27,921 --> 02:41:31,550
Nsx,
I want to say like 91 or 92 was the 

3451
02:41:31,550 --> 02:41:34,581
first NSX and it was basically like a 
super evolved sports car for the time it

3452
02:41:36,120 --> 02:41:40,380
like had these ridiculous things that 
they'd built into it like baffles in the

3453
02:41:40,381 --> 02:41:44,610
fuel lines to make sure that the weight 
always stayed completely central.

3454
02:41:44,940 --> 02:41:47,850
Like they wanted to have like a pure 50 
slash 50 weight balance.

3455
02:41:47,851 --> 02:41:51,570
So it's a mid engine car so the engine 
is behind the passenger seat.

3456
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:57,020
All these unique innovations to the 
suspension geometry and the way it 

3457
02:41:57,020 --> 02:41:59,760
handled was just like,
like it was on rails man.

3458
02:42:00,030 --> 02:42:02,730
And it was not even a high horsepower 
car.

3459
02:42:02,731 --> 02:42:07,731
It was like 275.
I think initially maybe two to 90 

3460
02:42:07,731 --> 02:42:10,490
towards the end of its production line.
It wasn't like that speed.

3461
02:42:10,530 --> 02:42:14,190
It was just bulletproof.
Who's all aluminum?

3462
02:42:14,250 --> 02:42:19,250
No one had ever done that before.
No one had ever made an all aluminum 

3463
02:42:19,250 --> 02:42:22,041
sports car.
I remember getting in that car with you 

3464
02:42:22,041 --> 02:42:24,230
when you first got it.
So amazing and you were just like you 

3465
02:42:24,230 --> 02:42:27,051
were telling me about it.
The engineering is unprecedented and 

3466
02:42:27,051 --> 02:42:29,190
they lost money on every one they sold.
They didn't make money on that car.

3467
02:42:29,250 --> 02:42:34,250
Why?
That makes a flagship car just to show 

3468
02:42:34,250 --> 02:42:34,250
you,
look,

3469
02:42:34,250 --> 02:42:36,180
not only are we going to make something 
that's better than any of your shit.

3470
02:42:36,360 --> 02:42:41,360
It's not going to break down ever.
It looks awesome and we're going to lose

3471
02:42:42,331 --> 02:42:43,860
money selling it.
Fuck you.

3472
02:42:44,860 --> 02:42:46,170
Shut.
You shut your mouth.

3473
02:42:46,260 --> 02:42:49,530
Damn,
and they kind of do that with the Nissan

3474
02:42:49,531 --> 02:42:51,570
does that now with this thing called the
GTR.

3475
02:42:52,260 --> 02:42:53,340
They have this car,
that GTR.

3476
02:42:53,341 --> 02:42:55,540
It's actually more expensive now than it
used to be for awhile.

3477
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:57,150
It's like they were barely breaking even
on it,

3478
02:42:57,151 --> 02:43:00,210
but I think now they realize that has 
such a demand that it's.

3479
02:43:00,211 --> 02:43:03,210
You can kind of charge more money and 
they've continued to innovate it.

3480
02:43:03,240 --> 02:43:05,520
They continue to.
It's like a Samurai sword.

3481
02:43:05,550 --> 02:43:10,550
They built the Samurai sword and I want 
to say the NSX came out like 2007 or 

3482
02:43:10,550 --> 02:43:10,550
something like that.
I might be off,

3483
02:43:10,770 --> 02:43:14,500
but that time they've just made a better
version every year.

3484
02:43:14,650 --> 02:43:16,150
Every year,
every year.

3485
02:43:16,270 --> 02:43:17,650
Every year.
That's what it looks like now.

3486
02:43:18,220 --> 02:43:22,570
Two thousand and 15 cost.
That's a hundred and something thousand,

3487
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:26,940
but it is a fucking spaceship.
Really.

3488
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:32,040
I rented one of those when I was in 
Austin at budget know Hertz.

3489
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:34,840
Hertz rent a car will let you run a 
fucking NSX.

3490
02:43:34,870 --> 02:43:39,870
Hilarious.
So I rented an Nsx and me and the 

3491
02:43:39,870 --> 02:43:40,800
Hinchcliffe machine,
we're fucking tooling around.

3492
02:43:41,400 --> 02:43:44,860
That thing is the fastest fucking thing 
I've ever done look like.

3493
02:43:45,240 --> 02:43:46,660
That's what I like about it.
It's such a,

3494
02:43:47,170 --> 02:43:52,170
you know,
it's kind of an understated sports car 

3495
02:43:52,170 --> 02:43:52,170
that's not a GTR.
What is that?

3496
02:43:52,170 --> 02:43:53,530
That's got different tale laws.
Unless it's got.

3497
02:43:53,531 --> 02:43:55,390
No,
I think it's just unique tail lights.

3498
02:43:55,420 --> 02:43:56,320
Is that a real one?

3499
02:43:58,750 --> 02:44:02,320
Maybe the real tail lights or go back to
the previous image that you had.

3500
02:44:02,710 --> 02:44:04,720
That's the real tail lights.
They're really cool looking.

3501
02:44:04,750 --> 02:44:07,570
It's a spaceship man.
The way it handles,

3502
02:44:07,571 --> 02:44:10,690
it's all like the thing that people 
don't like about it.

3503
02:44:10,990 --> 02:44:12,760
The people that don't like it,
most people love it,

3504
02:44:12,910 --> 02:44:15,100
but the thing that people are a little 
perturbed about it.

3505
02:44:15,101 --> 02:44:16,220
Look at that.
That's the answer.

3506
02:44:16,290 --> 02:44:21,290
That's the Nissan.
I kept thinking we were looking at an 

3507
02:44:21,290 --> 02:44:21,290
Acura.
I know there's a new ACURA NSX is coming

3508
02:44:21,290 --> 02:44:22,490
out as well,
but it probably won't be,

3509
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:27,500
but go back to that image,
that rear end image that you just show 

3510
02:44:27,500 --> 02:44:27,500
him.
Look at that fucking thing.

3511
02:44:27,500 --> 02:44:28,660
I mean that might as well be in star 
wars.

3512
02:44:29,260 --> 02:44:32,890
Look at the fucking the way it's built 
and all of that is aerodynamics.

3513
02:44:32,891 --> 02:44:34,930
Like all that shit you see around the 
back end,

3514
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:36,610
all that shit around the pipes.

3515
02:44:36,790 --> 02:44:41,790
That's all designed for downforce.
Extreme amounts of downtown Florence is 

3516
02:44:41,790 --> 02:44:41,790
super important to me.
Well,

3517
02:44:41,790 --> 02:44:43,810
that's why it has that.
Tailoring it in the back of it.

3518
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:48,280
That's all about keeping the ass end 
down because this thing has such fucking

3519
02:44:48,281 --> 02:44:51,970
insane power that sometimes they can 
catch a flight.

3520
02:44:52,770 --> 02:44:55,460
Like there's one of the nerves have that
Goddamn,

3521
02:44:56,170 --> 02:44:57,370
uh,
the wing,

3522
02:44:57,400 --> 02:44:58,540
yes,
yes.

3523
02:44:58,690 --> 02:44:59,830
But still,
because of that,

3524
02:44:59,831 --> 02:45:04,831
sometimes they get back end heavy,
which means the front end comes off the 

3525
02:45:04,831 --> 02:45:05,950
ground and they go flying through the 
air.

3526
02:45:06,350 --> 02:45:08,860
Yeah,
it happened recently at the nurburgring.

3527
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:12,520
So Nurburgring look up this gtr crash at
nurburgring.

3528
02:45:12,550 --> 02:45:16,270
It's a crazy thing to watch because you 
realize this is not just a crash.

3529
02:45:16,271 --> 02:45:21,271
This is a guy that has no control of his
car because the cars wheels aren't 

3530
02:45:21,271 --> 02:45:21,910
touching the ground.
It's flying.

3531
02:45:22,910 --> 02:45:25,290
It's crash.
Not Grad.

3532
02:45:25,780 --> 02:45:27,190
Okay,
let go to videos.

3533
02:45:27,490 --> 02:45:29,110
That's it right there.
Bam.

3534
02:45:29,111 --> 02:45:30,220
Watch this shit.
Oh,

3535
02:45:30,221 --> 02:45:32,590
you motherfucker.
Watch this shit.

3536
02:45:32,890 --> 02:45:33,730
This hurts my,
like,

3537
02:45:33,970 --> 02:45:38,960
my anticipation hurts my adrenal glands.
Oh whoa.

3538
02:45:38,961 --> 02:45:39,490
Whoa,
Whoa,

3539
02:45:39,491 --> 02:45:40,390
whoa.
Yep.

3540
02:45:40,910 --> 02:45:43,300
Look washed out again.
He's going around the corner.

3541
02:45:43,450 --> 02:45:45,010
That's what it kills.
So many died man.

3542
02:45:45,070 --> 02:45:46,120
So he died in this.
Yes,

3543
02:45:46,130 --> 02:45:48,460
they did not hit.
Was hit by the car.

3544
02:45:48,600 --> 02:45:53,600
Look at this shit.
He's coming over the hill and it just 

3545
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:53,600
catches flight.
Like he's,

3546
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:56,620
he's scraping along the back bumper.
Like just skipping through the air.

3547
02:45:57,190 --> 02:46:01,900
Fucking crazy.
The front end came so far off the ground

3548
02:46:02,260 --> 02:46:06,100
that the car literally was bumper to the
ground.

3549
02:46:06,101 --> 02:46:11,101
Like look at that,
the bumpers on the ground to the wind 

3550
02:46:11,101 --> 02:46:11,101
upside down.
How fast is he?

3551
02:46:11,101 --> 02:46:12,650
The wheel actually caught it from going 
upside down.

3552
02:46:12,651 --> 02:46:14,660
It goes back forward again and it flips.
Oh,

3553
02:46:14,661 --> 02:46:17,030
he's going ridiculously fast,
but that's not what the problem was.

3554
02:46:17,300 --> 02:46:20,510
The problem was he lost control.
I mean it's not about going fast.

3555
02:46:20,511 --> 02:46:23,480
It's about when do you go fast and when 
do you slow down and you got to know,

3556
02:46:23,910 --> 02:46:26,810
look,
I'm a circuit.

3557
02:46:26,811 --> 02:46:29,900
Like the Nurburgring,
the Nuremberg ring is the most famous of

3558
02:46:29,901 --> 02:46:33,350
all circuits when it comes to testing a 
car's lap time.

3559
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:36,110
Like if you can get a really fast lap 
times the nurburgring,

3560
02:46:36,111 --> 02:46:41,111
it's worth millions of dollars because 
that car will be the new king of the 

3561
02:46:41,111 --> 02:46:41,210
Nuremberg ring.
The GCR was like,

3562
02:46:41,211 --> 02:46:46,211
I think one of the best production cars 
in terms of lap times the fastest for 

3563
02:46:46,211 --> 02:46:51,011
the longest time was a corvette Zr one 
this fucking insane 650 horsepower 

3564
02:46:52,821 --> 02:46:54,260
corvette.
But now the new corvette,

3565
02:46:54,261 --> 02:46:59,261
z o six is even faster than that.
And every year everyone's trying to get 

3566
02:46:59,261 --> 02:47:01,910
a faster lap time on that track.
But here's the problem with that track,

3567
02:47:01,911 --> 02:47:06,911
that track sort of mimics the real world
and a sense that it's not like a flat 

3568
02:47:06,911 --> 02:47:06,911
line.

3569
02:47:06,911 --> 02:47:08,870
It's not like a flat circle,
like a nascar thing,

3570
02:47:09,320 --> 02:47:12,080
but there's ups and downs and twists and
turns.

3571
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:13,730
When you.
You're changing levels,

3572
02:47:13,731 --> 02:47:16,370
you're going down.
It's what you get from a real.

3573
02:47:16,371 --> 02:47:21,371
It's a real test,
the real test of the car's ability in 

3574
02:47:21,371 --> 02:47:23,951
the real world.
So that is particularly disturbing 

3575
02:47:23,951 --> 02:47:26,470
because that guy's coming off that hill 
like that with the kind of power that a 

3576
02:47:26,470 --> 02:47:29,921
real gtr that you could buy in a store 
has and he's going flying through the 

3577
02:47:29,921 --> 02:47:31,910
air.
So you have to stop and think,

3578
02:47:32,090 --> 02:47:34,210
look how beautiful that is.
God,

3579
02:47:34,340 --> 02:47:37,550
is that where the crash took place?
That's the nerve again.

3580
02:47:37,640 --> 02:47:40,520
Oh my God,
look how beautiful it is around it.

3581
02:47:40,910 --> 02:47:45,910
It's amazing.
I've never seen when people stand too 

3582
02:47:45,910 --> 02:47:45,910
close to car races like that with no 
protection.

3583
02:47:45,910 --> 02:47:48,800
Other guys who are golf watching golf,
when the guy tees off and what are they?

3584
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:52,220
Right in the line of fire.
You as a good point this,

3585
02:47:52,221 --> 02:47:53,180
especially though,
right?

3586
02:47:53,780 --> 02:47:55,180
Look how beautiful that is,
man.

3587
02:47:55,700 --> 02:47:59,180
You're flying around next to this 
unbelievable countryside,

3588
02:47:59,240 --> 02:48:04,240
so gorgeous parts of Germany and parts 
of Switzerland and parts of France that 

3589
02:48:04,240 --> 02:48:05,060
are just like that,
that blow your mind.

3590
02:48:05,330 --> 02:48:08,600
Then you go into these little towns and 
they'd been there for a thousand years.

3591
02:48:08,960 --> 02:48:13,960
The issue with this racetrack though 
apparently is that a lot of inclement 

3592
02:48:13,960 --> 02:48:16,730
weather,
like you'll watch a bunch of labs,

3593
02:48:16,731 --> 02:48:19,490
they'll do what's raining out and shit 
like in the UK,

3594
02:48:19,491 --> 02:48:20,570
you know,
like top gear.

3595
02:48:20,970 --> 02:48:23,180
One of the hilarious things about top 
gear,

3596
02:48:23,460 --> 02:48:28,460
um,
is that so often they're testing cars 

3597
02:48:28,460 --> 02:48:31,871
and it's raining.
Like Chris Harris I've had on the 

3598
02:48:31,871 --> 02:48:33,020
podcast before is like one of my 
favorite automotive journalists.

3599
02:48:33,260 --> 02:48:37,040
So many times he's driving a car and 
it's raining out really.

3600
02:48:37,041 --> 02:48:38,550
And these tests.
Yeah,

3601
02:48:38,640 --> 02:48:40,240
she's in the UK.
It rains all the fucking time.

3602
02:48:40,460 --> 02:48:45,460
Think and maybe this is maybe not so,
but it's raised card racecar driving 

3603
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:47,290
more popular in Europe than it is in the
United States.

3604
02:48:47,291 --> 02:48:48,150
That I would say so,
yeah.

3605
02:48:48,170 --> 02:48:53,140
Formula One,
they're just like dumb racing nascar.

3606
02:48:53,290 --> 02:48:58,290
He's got swag man.
And swapping bank is why does he have a 

3607
02:48:58,401 --> 02:49:00,090
southern accent is most of the people 
that will listen to.

3608
02:49:00,290 --> 02:49:02,570
What if I did it like a contradicting 
yourself?

3609
02:49:02,950 --> 02:49:05,110
What if I would accidentally be 
sophisticated?

3610
02:49:05,800 --> 02:49:08,070
It looks like the swabbing paint that 
moment

3611
02:49:08,120 --> 02:49:10,560
they're going left.
I'm Lin love with this.

3612
02:49:10,561 --> 02:49:13,170
Chevron is gaining ground on him.
I tell you,

3613
02:49:13,171 --> 02:49:18,171
man,
it's unbelievable the way he continues 

3614
02:49:18,171 --> 02:49:20,751
to turn left baffles the mind of razor.
He's doing a reparable damage to his 

3615
02:49:20,761 --> 02:49:25,440
reputation and to his chassis.
How can he do it with such accuracy?

3616
02:49:25,800 --> 02:49:28,380
The art form outrageous.
Now they're fighting.

3617
02:49:28,630 --> 02:49:30,150
They're.
There's a weird culture.

3618
02:49:30,151 --> 02:49:31,380
The English man,
they they.

3619
02:49:31,450 --> 02:49:34,110
They're also the regal illness and their
their way.

3620
02:49:34,111 --> 02:49:39,111
They have like set up all these 
different sorts of patterns that they 

3621
02:49:39,111 --> 02:49:41,700
follow.
All the rest and behavior of control.

3622
02:49:42,180 --> 02:49:47,180
Do you play snooker?
A madden play snooker of a hooligan will

3623
02:49:48,331 --> 02:49:52,940
be playing eight ball at the ball,
but a gentleman prefers Nuka.

3624
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:55,140
Knowing your place,
knowing your place,

3625
02:49:55,470 --> 02:49:57,810
discipline.
The British were always very disciplined

3626
02:49:57,811 --> 02:50:00,870
about protocol.
What's to be done,

3627
02:50:00,871 --> 02:50:05,871
what's not to be done made good soldiers
or home until they've figured out 

3628
02:50:05,871 --> 02:50:06,270
Americans figured out.

3629
02:50:06,270 --> 02:50:11,270
Just shoot it.
That white stripe that they're keeping 

3630
02:50:11,270 --> 02:50:11,270
the middle of their chest.
That was a long time ago.

3631
02:50:11,270 --> 02:50:12,720
Domino's was a shit.
It ain't gonna work,

3632
02:50:12,990 --> 02:50:14,480
but it's all the same thing.
Yeah.

3633
02:50:14,580 --> 02:50:19,580
People from their folly,
they need to learn what they were 

3634
02:50:19,580 --> 02:50:19,580
wearing wigs and they had wool coats on 
in the.

3635
02:50:19,580 --> 02:50:20,070
In the heat.
It sucked.

3636
02:50:20,190 --> 02:50:22,770
Was that about like what was the wig 
thing and protocol.

3637
02:50:22,771 --> 02:50:25,200
Powdered wigs.
Like why did they have powdered wigs?

3638
02:50:25,230 --> 02:50:28,860
There was always a form of even the 
French up until World War One war,

3639
02:50:29,270 --> 02:50:32,370
you know,
lots of like very like feathers and very

3640
02:50:32,400 --> 02:50:34,860
brightly colored clothing.
Peacocks,

3641
02:50:34,920 --> 02:50:35,740
yeah.
As a.

3642
02:50:35,750 --> 02:50:37,020
As a soldier,
you are.

3643
02:50:37,021 --> 02:50:37,740
You,
first of all,

3644
02:50:37,741 --> 02:50:40,560
you had a uniform and our uniform is 
going to be much more grandiose.

3645
02:50:40,561 --> 02:50:42,680
We have more money than you people do.
We're.

3646
02:50:42,681 --> 02:50:46,880
We're a higher birth so our soldiers are
decorated with the honor that that is,

3647
02:50:46,920 --> 02:50:48,630
that is bestowed on the greatest army.

3648
02:50:48,630 --> 02:50:51,830
There is where a sparkling jewel.
All of that.

3649
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:54,810
Our sabers are are polished,
shiny,

3650
02:50:55,080 --> 02:50:56,970
shiny,
and bright colors.

3651
02:50:57,180 --> 02:51:00,600
Think about how birds.
It's the same thing until Vietnam.

3652
02:51:00,690 --> 02:51:05,690
Those motherfuckers started heightened 
and holes in the ground shooting at us 

3653
02:51:05,690 --> 02:51:07,530
and the Brits always just wear khaki.
The breads would just fucking down home.

3654
02:51:07,560 --> 02:51:09,360
Khaki motherfuckers.
They were just like,

3655
02:51:09,361 --> 02:51:10,560
yeah,
you guys were all your stuff.

3656
02:51:10,561 --> 02:51:12,630
We're going to look.
Had to wear Khakis.

3657
02:51:12,840 --> 02:51:15,570
I wonder who figured out hunting like 
Cammo for hunting.

3658
02:51:15,930 --> 02:51:19,470
Like who's the first person to invent?
He goes back to millennials I think,

3659
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:21,270
think so.
Fuck leaves and shit.

3660
02:51:21,271 --> 02:51:26,271
Right?
As they were covering themselves and 

3661
02:51:26,271 --> 02:51:27,300
leaves waiting in the cold for dinner.
Fuck yeah,

3662
02:51:27,360 --> 02:51:29,130
they made it.
You didn't.

3663
02:51:30,180 --> 02:51:32,130
You didn't get to this point.
Trust me,

3664
02:51:32,520 --> 02:51:37,520
trust me.
You with your fucking ironic glasses on 

3665
02:51:37,520 --> 02:51:38,280
that don't even have a real lens.

3666
02:51:38,310 --> 02:51:43,310
Like people were like clear glass.
Fashion has always been another thing 

3667
02:51:43,411 --> 02:51:45,620
that we.
Fashion has always been there fast,

3668
02:51:45,850 --> 02:51:47,520
but people's appearance.
I mean,

3669
02:51:47,610 --> 02:51:52,610
you know,
if you look at indigenous cultures that 

3670
02:51:52,610 --> 02:51:52,820
have had very little contact,
they're still putting bones there.

3671
02:51:52,821 --> 02:51:56,340
Knows I'm wearing feathers and 
peacocking men and women,

3672
02:51:56,550 --> 02:51:59,040
but the eyeglass one is one of the 
weirdest ones.

3673
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:01,920
Well,
because it's a friend of mine's mother.

3674
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:04,050
He couldn't get a job.
It wasn't a friend of mine.

3675
02:52:04,051 --> 02:52:05,520
It's a friend of mine told me this story
about this kid.

3676
02:52:05,521 --> 02:52:09,630
He's Puerto Rican and he couldn't get a 
job and his mother said he'd been on.

3677
02:52:09,660 --> 02:52:11,110
He was a great student.
He's a great guy.

3678
02:52:11,111 --> 02:52:12,910
Just couldn't get a job.
I was trying to work on Wall Street.

3679
02:52:12,970 --> 02:52:14,920
His mother went out and bought him a 
pair of glasses,

3680
02:52:15,670 --> 02:52:18,820
just clear glasses and he got us.
I got every job we went in for.

3681
02:52:18,820 --> 02:52:19,960
He had glasses on.
They went,

3682
02:52:19,961 --> 02:52:22,350
this guy must read and he got every 
fucking job.

3683
02:52:22,780 --> 02:52:23,980
His mother was genius.
He said,

3684
02:52:23,981 --> 02:52:25,570
I'm going to put some glasses on your 
watch this.

3685
02:52:25,870 --> 02:52:30,870
It's also the only a candy cap that is 
sexually arousing 100 percent.

3686
02:52:31,181 --> 02:52:36,181
Like men,
like a secretary looking chick with 

3687
02:52:36,181 --> 02:52:38,461
glasses on.
Women like with classes really do 

3688
02:52:38,461 --> 02:52:38,461
though.
Yeah.

3689
02:52:38,461 --> 02:52:38,960
Tell me about it.
When you do put glass on style,

3690
02:52:39,010 --> 02:52:40,690
I have to use my reading glasses 
sometimes.

3691
02:52:40,700 --> 02:52:44,440
We resist all the time and my wife went,
that's really sexy,

3692
02:52:44,700 --> 02:52:46,660
just looks old.
She likes gray in my beard.

3693
02:52:46,990 --> 02:52:47,770
Guys,
they're dying.

3694
02:52:47,830 --> 02:52:49,690
Loves old guy.
She loves the old men.

3695
02:52:50,830 --> 02:52:51,880
She loves him.
Wrinkly.

3696
02:52:51,940 --> 02:52:52,480
Dude.
Rankles.

3697
02:52:52,630 --> 02:52:57,630
We're almost out of time.
I understand that you're going to be in 

3698
02:52:57,630 --> 02:52:57,630
Sacramento doing your standup comedy 
this weekend.

3699
02:52:57,630 --> 02:53:00,490
Brian tells them about it and they're 
actually expect that the punch line.

3700
02:53:00,520 --> 02:53:05,520
I'm glad you asked Joe.
I'm going to be at the Sacramento 

3701
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:06,430
punchline tearing it up this Thursday,
Friday,

3702
02:53:06,430 --> 02:53:11,430
Saturday,
and I am under the impression I've been 

3703
02:53:11,430 --> 02:53:11,430
talking to Tj dillashaw and your 
favorite.

3704
02:53:11,430 --> 02:53:15,440
There's a chance they might come out and
see me because they're friends of mine 

3705
02:53:15,440 --> 02:53:15,440
and I couldn't be more excited about 
that.

3706
02:53:15,440 --> 02:53:15,940
Yes.
Thursday,

3707
02:53:15,941 --> 02:53:16,690
Friday,
Saturday.

3708
02:53:16,691 --> 02:53:19,200
Joe,
and I want to say one more thing I,

3709
02:53:19,210 --> 02:53:24,210
you know,
I've got a podcast called the fighter 

3710
02:53:24,210 --> 02:53:24,210
and the kid heard that it gets one point
$5,

3711
02:53:24,210 --> 02:53:25,070
million downloads a month.
That's,

3712
02:53:25,290 --> 02:53:27,280
that's the rumor and it just to end in 
the rumors.

3713
02:53:27,281 --> 02:53:28,150
True.
Wow.

3714
02:53:28,151 --> 02:53:31,050
More importantly,
I'm going to be having A.

3715
02:53:31,050 --> 02:53:36,050
There's a.
There was a documentary called Lady 

3716
02:53:36,050 --> 02:53:36,050
Valor and I'm going to be having the 
navy seal who became a woman,

3717
02:53:36,320 --> 02:53:41,320
uh,
Kristen Beck on our podcast and I am 

3718
02:53:41,320 --> 02:53:41,320
very excited.
That is.

3719
02:53:41,380 --> 02:53:43,870
We're going to keep the camera on him.

3720
02:53:43,870 --> 02:53:45,370
Jamie.
This is a surprise.

3721
02:53:45,400 --> 02:53:46,390
That's right.
Gentlemen,

3722
02:53:46,450 --> 02:53:51,450
we're going to record it soon.
She's just taking the shirt off and 

3723
02:53:51,450 --> 02:53:54,290
you've got,
you've got a body looked like a naked 

3724
02:53:54,290 --> 02:53:54,290
silverback is a surprise dude.
Oh,

3725
02:53:54,290 --> 02:53:54,310
sorry buddy.
Oh,

3726
02:53:54,311 --> 02:53:55,060
I love it.
Oh,

3727
02:53:55,080 --> 02:53:56,800
okay.
Here we got the surprise coming.

3728
02:53:56,801 --> 02:53:58,750
You guys.
Christmas comes early.

3729
02:53:59,110 --> 02:54:04,110
Those gentlemen are biggest promoter.
Looking at not just the shirt but a 

3730
02:54:04,110 --> 02:54:05,200
cultural phenomenon.
This shirt,

3731
02:54:05,260 --> 02:54:10,260
this master,
Ken's 1984 taekwondo national champions 

3732
02:54:10,260 --> 02:54:14,061
shirt from the fighter and the kid,
they sold 800 of them in about six 

3733
02:54:14,061 --> 02:54:14,380
minutes,
right?

3734
02:54:14,860 --> 02:54:17,410
They flew off the shelves.
Just keep them in stock.

3735
02:54:17,440 --> 02:54:19,960
They bought new ones.
They were gone by the end of the day.

3736
02:54:20,010 --> 02:54:23,830
They're twice restocked shirt.
This motherfucker right here.

3737
02:54:23,890 --> 02:54:25,900
A cultural phenomenon that is the 
fighter and the kid.

3738
02:54:26,200 --> 02:54:26,920
Now,
what does that feel?

3739
02:54:26,921 --> 02:54:31,921
We're running out of time,
but that's kind of trippy like to know 

3740
02:54:31,921 --> 02:54:32,140
that you guys like yours or like pet 
show is taken off.

3741
02:54:32,140 --> 02:54:34,870
It really is.
It really is a good fucking podcast.

3742
02:54:34,960 --> 02:54:39,960
I appreciate it.
And a lot of it has to do with your 

3743
02:54:39,960 --> 02:54:40,060
support and we just try to keep it 
inspiring and funny and uh,

3744
02:54:40,080 --> 02:54:41,120
and I,
you know,

3745
02:54:41,121 --> 02:54:41,980
it's,
it's one of those things,

3746
02:54:41,981 --> 02:54:46,981
I think it's chemistry,
I'm just doing it and showing up and 

3747
02:54:46,981 --> 02:54:46,981
it's just a,
you never expect it to be.

3748
02:54:46,981 --> 02:54:48,010
You don't,
you're not managing success.

3749
02:54:48,011 --> 02:54:53,011
I just show up and do it.
But I think Brendan and I have a great 

3750
02:54:53,011 --> 02:54:53,011
chemistry.
It's very unusual.

3751
02:54:53,011 --> 02:54:54,730
Hilarious.
You guys were together too.

3752
02:54:54,740 --> 02:54:55,240
Yeah,
it's,

3753
02:54:55,270 --> 02:54:57,280
it's a very,
very funny chemistry.

3754
02:54:57,281 --> 02:55:00,550
We crack each other up and try to stay 
as authentic as we can.

3755
02:55:00,610 --> 02:55:03,800
That's,
that's rare and both really good dudes

3756
02:55:04,310 --> 02:55:06,980
that comes through in the show.
Like I know a lot of people that like on

3757
02:55:06,981 --> 02:55:11,981
the underground,
especially like that guy won me over 

3758
02:55:11,981 --> 02:55:14,420
fucker.
Like they listen to a fighter and the 

3759
02:55:14,420 --> 02:55:14,420
kid can't used to them.
I'm telling you,

3760
02:55:14,420 --> 02:55:17,780
like I was telling,
I've been telling Dana white this 

3761
02:55:17,780 --> 02:55:17,780
forever.
I'm like,

3762
02:55:17,780 --> 02:55:17,780
the guy,
he's a great guy.

3763
02:55:17,780 --> 02:55:19,640
Like I gotta get to take himself 
seriously.

3764
02:55:19,641 --> 02:55:24,641
He's very aware of his faults and he's 
always working on that to rose.

3765
02:55:25,440 --> 02:55:28,280
He's so silly.
Hilarious Shit.

3766
02:55:28,370 --> 02:55:30,780
Did you see the instagram?
I posted of him wearing that hat.

3767
02:55:31,630 --> 02:55:32,900
I was like,
I can't be friends with him.

3768
02:55:32,920 --> 02:55:36,050
He kept going all hands on deck,
all hands on deck.

3769
02:55:36,051 --> 02:55:41,051
Everybody like,
we don't know that people were playing 

3770
02:55:41,051 --> 02:55:41,051
volleyball with these.
He's got his hands on his knees,

3771
02:55:41,051 --> 02:55:44,180
this giant UFC fighter all hands on 
deck.

3772
02:55:44,810 --> 02:55:49,810
That's always fun for everybody else who
falls outside trying to figure out 

3773
02:55:49,810 --> 02:55:52,160
what's happening on making.

3774
02:55:52,160 --> 02:55:55,510
His motto was cauliflower ear.
He's so silly.

3775
02:55:55,580 --> 02:55:56,840
Yeah.
He's a funny dude,

3776
02:55:57,060 --> 02:55:59,180
a fighter and the kid.
It's available on itunes.

3777
02:55:59,181 --> 02:56:00,320
It's hilarious.
Podcast.

3778
02:56:00,321 --> 02:56:03,410
It really is fun and you guys get some 
great guests and lady valor.

3779
02:56:03,411 --> 02:56:06,290
That's going to be very interesting.
I want to talk to her.

3780
02:56:06,291 --> 02:56:07,580
I want to have her on.
That's a.

3781
02:56:07,850 --> 02:56:09,920
that's an insane story and I'll ask 
better questions to you.

3782
02:56:09,921 --> 02:56:12,170
So what I'll do is I'll just watch you 
guys fuck it up first.

3783
02:56:12,770 --> 02:56:17,770
I'll come in.
