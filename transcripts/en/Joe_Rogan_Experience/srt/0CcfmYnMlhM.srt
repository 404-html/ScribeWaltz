1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:01,951
Well,

3
00:00:01,951 --> 00:00:03,810
I'm glad over all the years though,

4
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,110
although all the stupid ideas that
have had about arguments in my head,

5
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:09,480
I've avoided all physical altercations.

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,460
I've never had a physical altercation.

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,210
I've kid,

8
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,890
I've had situations where,

9
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,251
you know,

10
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:14,821
a long time ago,

11
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:17,130
I wish I told this guy that
or I wish I told them this,

12
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,210
but the reality is it's way better than
I didn't cause then what if he went,

13
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:22,140
well fuck you.

14
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:25,290
And then he fucking throws a rock at me
and then all of a sudden were two men

15
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,153
biting each other.

16
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,571
You want to get on it?

17
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:28,170
Go that route.

18
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,630
Wrestling in the street
like fucking children.

19
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,580
You know what the fuck is that?

20
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,601
When I was a kid,

21
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:37,380
my dad came home from work
once with a fucking black eye.

22
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,750
My stepdad's business was going,

23
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,920
it was falling apart and at one point
she got squirrelly in him and his partner

24
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:45,270
fucking duked it out.

25
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,490
It's crazy.

26
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:47,941
Yeah,

27
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:48,290
he been,

28
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,410
youtube wasn't around then.

29
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:49,621
You know,

30
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:50,760
there'd be some sort of security.

31
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:51,570
So it was like,

32
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:51,901
Whoa,

33
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:54,450
aren't you like in your fucking forties?

34
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,210
It's like what is happening here?

35
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:56,700
It was,

36
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,170
it was disappointing.

37
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,280
Embarrassing.

38
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,031
It was sad.

39
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:01,710
It was a bunch of different
things all at once.

40
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:04,470
You don't think it was bad ass on any
level that your stepdad could still throw

41
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:04,910
now?

42
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,370
No,

43
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:05,701
he could.

44
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:06,870
I think he got his ass kicked.

45
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,640
I'm pretty sure that's embarrassing.

46
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:09,090
I'm sure.

47
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,960
I'm pretty sure he got
sucker punched and then uh,

48
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,930
he hit the guy back.

49
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:14,010
He punched the guy in the stomach,

50
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:15,390
but I dunno who punched who first,

51
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,950
but it's just fucking pathetic.

52
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,160
This guy was his friend and this guy used
to come over to the house and we used

53
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:20,640
to,

54
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:20,821
you know,

55
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:23,040
we all still have family dinners together.

56
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,331
Like the,

57
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:25,380
him and his wife would come
over the house and was,

58
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:26,640
this is my dad's partner.

59
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,010
And then all of a sudden they're
fucking duking it out at work.

60
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:29,360
Cause the,

61
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,480
the business fell apart.

62
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,770
It was very,

63
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:33,980
very straight and come over
for dinner again or no,

64
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,380
it was,

65
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,460
they became friends again.

66
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:35,731
Yeah,

67
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:35,901
they,

68
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:36,391
they just,

69
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:37,290
they stayed friends,

70
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,660
you know,

71
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,160
they just,

72
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,710
they've duked it out as friends
and then they stayed friends,

73
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,080
but it was just embarrassing
and he was embarrassed to,

74
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:44,310
he felt like such a fucking idiot.

75
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:45,570
He came home with a black eye,

76
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,231
you know,

77
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:46,531
it's like,

78
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:47,364
what am I dealt with?

79
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,840
Hi Roni man to read,

80
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,040
pick up the friendship.

81
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,080
It'd be easier if I won the fight,

82
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,730
if I lost the fight.

83
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:54,910
That would be in the back of my,

84
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,100
he went the rematch point.

85
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,110
And you get used to,

86
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,420
when you do Jujitsu a lot,

87
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,580
you get used to getting beat can get,

88
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,450
that's a different thing.

89
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,780
There's someone wanting
to fight and then like,

90
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:05,911
okay,

91
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:06,151
let's,

92
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:07,590
let's try these techniques.

93
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:07,920
It,

94
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,221
you know,

95
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:11,580
if like what if we had some big argument
about we were going to combine our

96
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:14,820
podcasts and then it just didn't go well
and I didn't give you the money for the

97
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:18,510
microphones and then we duked
it out and you somehow lost.

98
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:22,980
I somehow surprise you and had always
feel like one in a million chance.

99
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:24,210
I somehow caught you.

100
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,790
I would feel way stupid
or that we're fighting.

101
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,640
I would feel way stupider than that.

102
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,121
I know,

103
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:31,220
but you're a martial artist.

104
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,980
I get it.

105
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,100
But just right now

106
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,371
go in peace.

107
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:36,204
He got Doug's.

108
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,100
It's always worth it.

109
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,200
You wouldn't see me in there and like
I got my back turned to get down the

110
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,270
amperage shaking my head.

111
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:42,690
I'd be like,

112
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,381
what bill?

113
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:44,790
How can they punched me in the face?

114
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,590
And that Ron Howard look at jackass.

115
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:47,460
That wouldn't bug you.

116
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,040
Depends on if you really
just tooled me up.

117
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,360
Like all of a sudden you just fucking
unload like a one to leg kick combination

118
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:55,194
on me and

119
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,360
hit me with a liver shot
and dropped me and uh,

120
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,590
and then I had tap out.

121
00:02:59,591 --> 00:02:59,771
Yeah.

122
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:00,040
Then I'd

123
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,360
probably want some sort of a rematch.

124
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,190
Let me ask you this,

125
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,200
which really upset would
you lose a belt class?

126
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:09,020
Would you have to go back down
to Brown belt and you'll lose?

127
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,370
I mean,

128
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,910
the only way you get to the ideas that
you're a certain level of proficiency,

129
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:14,410
but it doesn't mean that
someone can't get you.

130
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,650
What if I started Fluxx helps
get tapped all the time.

131
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,130
If my face to your Dojo,

132
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,600
you'd have to lose just when a UTI bill

133
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,510
who's next and I'm just sitting
there with a stupid look on my face.

134
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,110
Oh van.

135
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,943
You know,

136
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,600
competition is healthy.

137
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,310
I think it's fun and everything,

138
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:35,110
but when it gets in the real world,

139
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,480
like as far as like fighting
people and shit like that,

140
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,290
it's too spoiled because you
don't just fight someone.

141
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,270
They'd get mad and then they come back
and they want to bring a baseball bat or

142
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:44,650
fucking stab you or shoot you.

143
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,870
I never fought outside
my family past June,

144
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,490
outside flashy when junior high
started getting to be like,

145
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:51,681
you know,

146
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:55,210
a buck and a quarter and like new
hot becoming coordinated dude.

147
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:57,460
I saw one kid take a
pounding and I was just like,

148
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:57,551
yeah,

149
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:58,690
I'm sticking with the jokes.

150
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,770
It was this kid who was,

151
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,521
he was jacked.

152
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:02,010
He's one of those up man childs,

153
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:02,630
you know,

154
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,940
and like in like eighth grade,

155
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:04,091
you know,

156
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:04,380
they art,

157
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,420
they could like beat up the teacher but
then they get to high school and they

158
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:08,231
just stop growing.

159
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:08,511
And then the,

160
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:11,450
just this little fireplug but
eighth grade that's like the,

161
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,430
that's their peak.

162
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,520
And this kid was at his apex of,

163
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,990
of physical fitness and he
was fighting this doughy.

164
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,190
There's baby who we look in kid and they
go to get off the bus and baby Hueys

165
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,400
behind Manchild and he just,

166
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:25,150
you know,

167
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,890
he just pushed him down from behind,

168
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,371
jumped,

169
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:29,350
got on his chest and it was just,

170
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,870
he just started teeing off on
his head and it was one of those,

171
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,341
you know,

172
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:34,480
when people go crazy and
then it becomes disgusting.

173
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,680
Like the crowd was just like,

174
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,320
ah.

175
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,400
And he's just like,

176
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,670
he was just beating the fuck out of him.

177
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,400
He didn't come to school for the rest
of the week and he came back the next

178
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,430
week.

179
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,440
And the swelling in his face,

180
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,500
he had come down probably 80% but he
misses manchild still didn't look,

181
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,460
and he had a look in his eye.

182
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,900
I remember his confidence was shaken.

183
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:54,100
I'm,

184
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,340
I,

185
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:54,761
it was,

186
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,481
it was amazing man.

187
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:55,721
I was like,

188
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:56,620
you saw it was a,

189
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,690
it was a moment in his life.

190
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:00,070
And I remember just looking at that going,

191
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:00,371
yeah,

192
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:00,790
yeah.

193
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,510
Have,

194
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,130
it was funny because I almost
went out of with that baby.

195
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:03,521
He would kid,

196
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:04,360
I would have got killed.

197
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,300
He's like,

198
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,980
he just,

199
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,460
he would have stabbed
me with the fucking kid.

200
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:10,901
No,

201
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:12,640
he used to get bullied and he just,

202
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:13,474
I dunno,

203
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,340
he was used to getting the crap kicked
out of him by people like two years

204
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:18,701
older,

205
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:20,410
which is basic when
you're in seventh grade,

206
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,220
like that two years is
a huge jump physically.

207
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,320
And it's like you're sitting there,

208
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:27,154
you know,

209
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,401
like,

210
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:27,641
okay,

211
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,070
I'm going to find you and the other guys,

212
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,330
like,

213
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,310
we've got like a beard,

214
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,233
you know,

215
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,270
smashing you over the head.

216
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:34,730
So,

217
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,560
um,

218
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:35,861
yeah,

219
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:39,160
so all my fights were basically within
my family and I had four brothers,

220
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:42,490
so I used to practice on my three younger
ones and then try to take my older

221
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:44,320
brother who had the
psychological advantage over me.

222
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:46,420
So older brothers always
have an advantage.

223
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,060
I had a friend who's a older brother,

224
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:54,061
used to beat the fuck out of them and
it tortured him late into adulthood.

225
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,920
He was in his late
thirties and it was fucked.

226
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,040
It fucked his head

227
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,580
up.

228
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,380
He always wanted to get
back at his brother.

229
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,750
He used to go over his brother's house
and his brother wasn't home and steal

230
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,584
shit from them.

231
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,850
Like he would go like his wife,

232
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,050
his brother's wife was there.

233
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,043
He'd say hi.

234
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,140
And again I got,

235
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,700
John told me to go pick something up
and he'd go in and just steal from his

236
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:11,090
brother.

237
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,200
What's still kinds of shit?

238
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,150
Beat the fuck out of him.

239
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:17,030
His brother beat the fuck out of him
and his brother was like two years older

240
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,980
and just use to just box him up.

241
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,060
He's to fucking really hurt them
and intimidate the shit out of.

242
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,910
I got one for,

243
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,330
I went last time I fought
my youngest brother,

244
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,531
uh,

245
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:30,190
I forget when we went out and about my
dad came in to break it up and like a

246
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:31,030
piece of shit.

247
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:35,140
I did one more over my dad's shoulder
caught him and it made that classic like

248
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:39,140
Hollywood should have rec recorded the
sound for like the punch in the face is

249
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:42,940
that classic but like with a little bit
of lip sound kind of right in the mouth.

250
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,440
And uh,

251
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,610
I knew what bugged them and then what
would hit for like 15 years we would be

252
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:49,270
out drinking.

253
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,070
And like when he got on his third drink,

254
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,990
I would feel him sizing me up.

255
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,213
I felt it,

256
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,331
I felt it.

257
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:55,781
I was just going,

258
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:57,700
is this in my head or is
this dude sizing me up?

259
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,880
And then like years later I'm drink with
my other brother and we were talking

260
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:01,160
about,

261
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,780
and I'm going,

262
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:01,961
yeah,

263
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:02,950
he doesn't think I noticed,

264
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:04,120
but I feel him size and up.

265
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,540
He goes,

266
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,141
Oh yeah dude.

267
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:05,321
He goes,

268
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:06,250
every time I drink with them,

269
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:11,251
he brings that and like by then he was
a little bit taller than me and he had

270
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:11,681
that,

271
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:11,951
that,

272
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:13,030
that anger and stuff.

273
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:13,864
But uh,

274
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,531
I just want to,

275
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:15,670
I want to just tie them up.

276
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,320
Like I got to a point where I just,

277
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:17,561
you know,

278
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:19,480
I'll get a strategy
planned out in your head.

279
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,860
Don't go to the sucker punch.

280
00:07:20,861 --> 00:07:21,760
Get the clench.

281
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,031
Yeah.

282
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:26,920
My older brother came at me a bit about
11 years ago and like a red roof inn,

283
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,600
some,

284
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,250
some sort of bullshit
and he came flying at me.

285
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,061
You know,

286
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:34,540
my brother,

287
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,051
no joke.

288
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:37,180
He can fight and I just tied them up.

289
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,780
I had been,

290
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,060
but I had the advantage
where he has a real job,

291
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:41,020
so he has to work.

292
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,930
I can sit here going on hikes
and going to the gym and stuff.

293
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,470
So I was in,

294
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,161
I've cardio,

295
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:45,971
I was in better shape,

296
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:46,750
so I just,

297
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,740
I just tied them up.

298
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,280
Hello Jeff.

299
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,810
The time up for not,

300
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,850
not long ago and he was like
one of these past 15 seconds.

301
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:54,250
It's like in cubicle shape.

302
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,220
Like that initial I'm going to,

303
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,211
I'm going to kill you.

304
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,260
But this is the thing though,

305
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:00,310
if he would have,

306
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,391
if I didn't,

307
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:01,750
uh,

308
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,210
tie him up.

309
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:02,410
Yeah,

310
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:02,771
that's all.

311
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:02,950
Like,

312
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,221
it's,

313
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,200
it's like in hockey when,

314
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,260
when someone does not have a fight,

315
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:06,910
they just grabbed the guy
and like bear hug them.

316
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,130
I just thought it did that and I was uh,

317
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,301
how was it?

318
00:08:10,301 --> 00:08:11,230
He was kind of on top of me,

319
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:11,561
but I just,

320
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:12,031
I just sat,

321
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,120
I'm sorta smothered in there.

322
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:13,361
I was like,

323
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:13,541
dude,

324
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,100
I'm not going to fight.

325
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,410
I can fight.

326
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,310
He didn't talk to me for a year.

327
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,180
Wow.

328
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,170
You didn't talk to me for a year.

329
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:18,250
And what was he mad about?

330
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,240
I don't,

331
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,780
it was,

332
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,080
dude,

333
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,970
it's that family shit.

334
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:22,840
I Dunno.

335
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,310
Something from 1974.

336
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:24,711
I'm glad.

337
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:25,530
I don't know.

338
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,100
I would not want to grow up with
someone like me if I was a brother,

339
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,993
if I had be like it,

340
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,580
one or two things would have happened
would have been either we would join an

341
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:38,581
alliance and fucking start a team take
on the world and tag team checks or we

342
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:40,420
would fight to the death.

343
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,410
It's going to be one or the other.

344
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,470
I don't really see any,

345
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,301
the other options.

346
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:43,690
Yeah,

347
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,930
so which one's going to be fucking,

348
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,030
you know,

349
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,890
I think there's a reason why
you didn't have a brother.

350
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,521
Cause I,

351
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:49,420
whenever I talked to him,

352
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:49,870
he has like,

353
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,080
you'll have a couple of parakeets and
they somehow have a fight to the death.

354
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:53,591
Like,

355
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:54,250
dude,

356
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,083
what's with parking?

357
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,090
They just go at it too.

358
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,020
Ah,

359
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,681
freaks and Geeks.

360
00:09:30,681 --> 00:09:31,431
Lovers and children.

361
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:32,000
What's going on?
