1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,401
So,

3
00:00:02,401 --> 00:00:02,551
uh,

4
00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:04,830
what is it like working with the
vice guys were fucking loved it.

5
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,760
I love vice man vices there.

6
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,210
I've worked with so many people and vice
just let you do your thing and that's

7
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:13,044
the best part.

8
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,640
And like I just went through a whole week.

9
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,331
I was at Ted,

10
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:18,990
I'm a ted fellow this year and I went
through a whole week of people telling me

11
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:19,531
what to do,

12
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:23,100
where to be and it was like being at
a fucking Scientology summer camp.

13
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:23,730
It was horrible.

14
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:23,941
Yeah.

15
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,470
Tell me what the fuck happened.

16
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,000
They told you that you,

17
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:27,271
you,

18
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:28,680
you can't leave.

19
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,950
Yeah.

20
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,880
Like before you go there,

21
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:31,530
like you need to participate in Ted,

22
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,111
you need to beat them.

23
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:32,461
Like all right,

24
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:32,730
cool.

25
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,880
Like I figure like mines are reasonable.

26
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,560
If you have to do something in La,

27
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:38,371
you can go do something.

28
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,180
In La,

29
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,970
I gave them like four
or five days of my time.

30
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,160
Like I was there every single 13 hours.

31
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:47,010
Like every day they have 13
hours of fucking activities.

32
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:48,690
They have mapped out for you some days,

33
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:50,160
like 1516 hours.

34
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:50,760
Right.

35
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,700
If you go to their after events and I'm
like that's way too much fucking human

36
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,160
interaction days.

37
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,000
Explain this.

38
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,170
So you go there and you're going
to go and do your own Ted speech,

39
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:01,440
right?

40
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,800
Yeah.

41
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,300
So you do your own Ted speech.

42
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,070
What does the other
stuff they have for you?

43
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:08,250
They want you to be available
for like networking,

44
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,430
cocktail events like
attendees want to talk to you,

45
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,750
you need to be available.

46
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:13,261
And I was like,

47
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:13,620
look,

48
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:13,980
I,

49
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,820
I've done a lot.

50
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:16,140
Like I put people on,

51
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,750
like I put them in touch
with ad agency people,

52
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:21,600
I put them in touch with other people
to do business with other artists,

53
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,300
introducing everyone and
I thought I was good.

54
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,810
So I went yesterday to go do
DVD asa and when I met up Cho,

55
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:32,550
I met up Assa then I went and now they
called me today on the way over here and

56
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:32,881
they were like,

57
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:34,920
we're taking your fed Ted
Fellowship where I was like,

58
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,540
why are you taking the Ted Fellowship?

59
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,430
Like because you went to la.

60
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,210
I was like,

61
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,230
you're in Long Beach.

62
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,680
I just went to La for the afternoon
to do the fucking podcast.

63
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:44,730
You're fucking crazy.

64
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,540
And they're like,

65
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,990
you took this spot from somebody who
would have gone to every talk and been in

66
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:49,321
everything.

67
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:49,561
I was like,

68
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:49,741
Yo,

69
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:51,510
the other people weren't
there for everything.

70
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,100
But you're also just crazy.

71
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,450
Like you're fucking crazy.

72
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:55,110
Crazy.

73
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,130
They're not paying you.

74
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,521
No,

75
00:01:56,521 --> 00:02:00,150
they don't pay that's incense and go to
do it for the love and they want you for

76
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:01,170
seven days,

77
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,760
12 to 15 hours a day,

78
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,520
and you can't just leave
to go do something.

79
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,780
Some work that you have to do.

80
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:06,970
Yeah.

81
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,880
It's fucked up.

82
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,150
Yeah.

83
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,470
What,

84
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,730
what is it where people
fuck up everything.

85
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,980
Even something as amazing as Ted,

86
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,000
because Ted,

87
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:19,530
I remember the first Ted talk that I ever
saw on the Internet a couple of years

88
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:19,650
ago.

89
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,830
We have a whole ted thread on
my message board about great,

90
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,250
uh,

91
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,630
great ted episodes.

92
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:24,781
Yeah.

93
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:26,430
Like the one how to be happy is great.

94
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:26,731
Oh,

95
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:28,050
there's so many of them all.

96
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:33,051
But Graham Hancock just gave one in the
war and consciousness about Iowasca and,

97
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:35,310
and his own problems with,

98
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:35,760
uh,

99
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,870
kicking cannabis.

100
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,760
He had like a crazy weed habit where
he's high all day every day for like

101
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:41,940
decades.

102
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,690
And then electra was,

103
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,630
it was a crutch for them.

104
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:44,640
It was like a real problem.

105
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,480
Um,

106
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:45,841
great.

107
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:46,770
Ted Talk about it though.

108
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:47,910
There's so much good stuff,

109
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:49,980
but then you hear shit
like this and you're like,

110
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,810
even they suck.

111
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,660
Like even if someone
finds a way to fuck up,

112
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,370
even something as amazing as Ted.

113
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,670
Yeah,

114
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,750
the speakers are great.

115
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,350
I quit.

116
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,860
I can't say damn bad thing.

117
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,320
Every single one of the
fellows is like inspirational,

118
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:02,711
amazing,

119
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:03,544
doing great work.

120
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,443
The thing is though,

121
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,020
something gets so good and people feel
the power that they have and then they

122
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,930
impose rules and that's how society
got created in the beginning.

123
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,010
Somebody got so liked and got so much
power that they could force you to do

124
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,170
things that were entirely
unnatural than inhuman.

125
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,050
That's so ridiculous too.

126
00:03:19,051 --> 00:03:24,051
To think that a guy like you who's as
busy as you could give up that time and be

127
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:28,450
angry if you vary from
their schedule at all,

128
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:29,990
that that sounds like it's more to,

129
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,300
I think Ted's a racist
[inaudible] kind of crazy too.

130
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:36,700
Cause other people missed and
they kind of picked on me for it.

131
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,320
But even before I got out here I was like,

132
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:38,471
Yo,

133
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:39,610
my birthday is Friday.

134
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:41,020
You want me to stay till Saturday?

135
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,060
Can I at least have my girls stay with me?

136
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:43,610
Like,

137
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,070
and I'll just use the room like,

138
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,470
oh we can't because you
have a roommate at tet,

139
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:50,740
so you're like 30 40 year old
people staying with a roommate.

140
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:51,400
I was like,

141
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,030
wait a minute,

142
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,481
wait a minute.

143
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:52,651
Wait.

144
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:54,220
They make you room with people?

145
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,083
Wait a minute,

146
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,020
how can they do that?

147
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,650
They won't tell you who to sleep with.

148
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,181
They were,

149
00:03:58,181 --> 00:03:58,840
yes.

150
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
And they were like,

151
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,610
you have to room.

152
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:01,990
It's part of the Ted experience.

153
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,381
And I was like,

154
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:04,990
this is a court at this point
you have crossed the threshold.

155
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,550
You're now fucking Scientology.

156
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,450
Yes.

157
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,320
That's crazy.

158
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,150
So they assign you,

159
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:10,481
they say,

160
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:11,314
you know what,

161
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,620
we think that Eddie would grow if
he lived with Sasha for a week.

162
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,080
Yeah.

163
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,310
So some crazy fuck.

164
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,500
Who's a Sasha Shogun,

165
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,250
who's in there cooking up crystal
meth and whatever the fuck he's doing.

166
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:24,700
He,

167
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,820
you would have to stay with that guy.

168
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:26,230
Yes.

169
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,500
I mean luckily they put me with
this dude software who is amazing.

170
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:30,170
Cool cat.

171
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,340
I was calling software.

172
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:32,140
Yeah,

173
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,340
you were really to be able to pull
the name of the dude is amazing.

174
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:37,960
His name was software
and I stayed with him,

175
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:38,590
but I was like,

176
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,560
I'm 30 I haven't stayed in a
hotel with people in a minute.

177
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,240
You know how big is the hotel?

178
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,590
It's a small shitty hotel.

179
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:47,200
It's the highest reasons he looks
like a fucking airport hotel in La.

180
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:47,710
So you bought,

181
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,330
you're like in the bed next to this guy,

182
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,800
so you got to hear each other snore.

183
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,570
Oh fuck.

184
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,280
What the fuck is that?

185
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:57,970
And they also hold this shit at long beach
and it's like next to like across the

186
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:58,211
street,

187
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:03,070
literally you have back to back
outback pf Chang's and like subway.

188
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,241
It's ridiculous,

189
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:06,130
but the whole thing is just weird.

190
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:06,580
I was like,

191
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,550
I'll pay for my own room.

192
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:07,990
And they're like,

193
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,201
no,

194
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:09,034
you're not allowed.

195
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,760
I was like,

196
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,310
you're not allowed to
pay for your own room.

197
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:12,850
Yeah,

198
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,720
they're crazy.

199
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:15,010
They just want to control you.

200
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,240
That is amazing.

201
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:17,380
So I still love the talks.

202
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:18,400
I love all the speakers,

203
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,380
but the organization is fucked.

204
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,800
That's hilarious that they think that
they can have that kind of influence over

205
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,150
you.

206
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,900
That's part of the Ted experience.

207
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:27,280
Eddie is part of the Ted experience.

208
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,750
It's part of the Ted Experience to get
Paul that no one's talked about this

209
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:33,970
before because this seems
like straight up boy scouts.

210
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,160
You know what is the thing is most people,

211
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,440
they need 10 they need Ted to put you on.

212
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:39,340
They want the co sign.

213
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:39,851
And most people,

214
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:40,270
it's like,

215
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,440
if you do something for me,

216
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,520
I won't say anything about you.

217
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,390
But that's,

218
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:43,661
I mean,

219
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:44,141
I think Joe,

220
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:44,974
you're the same way.

221
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,480
I don't give a fuck what you do for me.

222
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,220
If you're a fucking Weirdo and you're
about to start some new Colt conference

223
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:51,700
religion,

224
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,540
I'm going to say something.

225
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:52,940
Right.

226
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,160
I'm not going to follow your rules.

227
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,950
I would write a book about this if I try.

228
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,530
They actually tried to get me to do
what they wanted me to do for four,

229
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,371
five,

230
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:01,701
six,

231
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,151
seven days,

232
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:04,070
whatever it was and not paying you.

233
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,580
They send packets to to be like this
is how to network with billionaires.

234
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:08,570
Wow.

235
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,150
Like how to go to a
network with billionaires,

236
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:15,080
how to go to a network and talk to people
and like talk to potential people who

237
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:16,340
could collaborate and work with you.

238
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:16,850
They're like,

239
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,620
don't just go ask them for money.

240
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:19,130
And I'm like,

241
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,030
this is crazy.

242
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,923
Oh my God.

243
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,940
Just go ask them for money and it's in
the packets and you're a grown ass man

244
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:28,910
and they pick you like you're obviously
intelligent if you're getting picked for

245
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:32,420
10 and they're like today when
it rains you should pack a punch.

246
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,230
It's wild.

247
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,441
I see.

248
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:33,851
That holds.

249
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:34,870
That is harder.

250
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,091
Okay.

251
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:39,860
What that is is exactly the opposite of
the vehicle that got them there and the

252
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:42,170
vehicle that got them
there is the Internet.

253
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,860
What got them there is the fact that the
freedom of the Internet allows people

254
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:48,350
to exchange interesting
conversations like that.

255
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:48,561
Hey,

256
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:49,460
you got to listen to this.

257
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:50,121
You got to wash us.

258
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:51,770
This lady gave the speech on monkeys.

259
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:52,461
It was amazing.

260
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:56,480
Whatever you and what they did
is the exact opposite of that.

261
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,970
And that's why even though Obama
was focusing on gun control,

262
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:02,270
the most important debate that Americans
will face in the next five years is

263
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,163
internet freedom.

264
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,350
Internet freedom is the most
important debate we will face.

265
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:10,310
And we heard so fucking blind to it
because the lobbyists are doing it under

266
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:11,600
like under our noses.

267
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:11,811
Yeah,

268
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:11,991
you,

269
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:16,991
you surely should have the right and
ability to put your own website up and

270
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:20,900
control your own content and express
yourself any in any way shape,

271
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:22,070
form you choose.

272
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,310
And the benefits of that have been
staggering to our culture over the last

273
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,530
couple of years,

274
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,500
just over the last 10 you know,

275
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,590
and the idea that corporations might
have the ability to step in and stop that

276
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,650
or regulate that or restrict that or
sensor you if in anything that you do and

277
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:46,580
somehow or another if anything you do
in somehow or another one way or a forms

278
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,330
cost them money and they decide that
this is something that has to be stopped,

279
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,170
they're going to be able to do that
unless we do something and once somebody

280
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,320
realizes that they have their hand on
the faucet and they have the ability to

281
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:58,460
turn it on and turn it off,

282
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,480
people get crazy.

283
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,940
You've seen that study
guide like these 10 people,

284
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,920
they even BlocPower yeah,

285
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:07,400
they do this shit where they invite
these people to go talk and they actually

286
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:09,770
don't put up everybody's
talks until this year.

287
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,850
They used to pick and choose and cherry
pick the talks they'd put up and you

288
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:15,080
would go there for a week,

289
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,550
15 hours a day,

290
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,840
do all their shit,

291
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,120
and then imagine if they
didn't put up your talk,

292
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,230
but what have you talk socks.

293
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,520
If you're talk sucked,

294
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:24,620
I feel like it should just
go suck on the Internet.

295
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:26,510
Like it'll go hide in a
corner on the Internet.

296
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,530
Right.

297
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,720
But maybe yes and no,

298
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,490
because if you like,

299
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:34,910
say if you had a comedy conference and uh,

300
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,560
you had all these comedians do sets,

301
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:38,090
but some of them were just dog shit.

302
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,330
You want that set to represent your,

303
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:42,081
your company.

304
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:42,441
No,

305
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:42,951
you would,

306
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:43,784
you know,

307
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,683
you wouldn't do it.

308
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,081
Yeah,

309
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:45,914
I wouldn't,

310
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:46,700
you know,

311
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,570
if I did though,

312
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:50,600
invite someone and they stayed
for a week and I didn't pay them,

313
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,201
I would be like,

314
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:54,830
the least I owe you is the opportunity
that quite possibly there's three people

315
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:56,600
on the planet at that enjoy your stuff.

316
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,570
You know what I mean?

317
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:57,871
Yeah.

318
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,621
That's one point.

319
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:58,801
Yeah.

320
00:08:58,801 --> 00:08:59,401
That's a point.

321
00:08:59,401 --> 00:08:59,730
I guess.

322
00:08:59,730 --> 00:08:59,910
Again,

323
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,410
I know what you're saying
to protect the brand.

324
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:02,310
It makes a little sense,

325
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:03,210
but you know,

326
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:03,871
for the most part,

327
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:05,370
most people's talks are fucking good.

328
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:05,761
Yeah.

329
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:06,690
They're there for a reason.

330
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:07,860
So it's probably really different.

331
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:10,500
They're not going to get
an open miker Ted talker.

332
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,780
Yeah,

333
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,940
but it's not a bringer show.

334
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,893
Right.

335
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,410
But they give opportunities to a lot
of weird people mean it's absolutely

336
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:16,810
possible.

337
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,643
There must be,

338
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,930
I bet if we just ask,

339
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,070
I bet we're ignorant to it.

340
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:20,880
But we just say,

341
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,960
show me the Ted talks,

342
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,100
that sucker fat Dick,

343
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,100
they're going to,

344
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,050
it's okay.

345
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,680
Twitter,

346
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,020
Twitter people please show me the
Ted talks that soccer fat Dick,

347
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,290
everyone wants to see the Sarah Silverman,

348
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:31,950
ted talk.

349
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,000
There was never let out.

350
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,720
She got us.

351
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,553
She gave us,

352
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,050
they never let it out
cause she made fun of Ted.

353
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,670
See I would have fucking wanted to watch
that to meet your weekly and the thing

354
00:09:40,671 --> 00:09:42,460
is if your confidence
that you're allow you,

355
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,560
you can laugh at yourself.

356
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:45,000
They don't know how to
laugh at themselves.

357
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:45,781
She made fun of Ted.

358
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:46,560
In what way?

359
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,610
Like during her talk,

360
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,170
it's like the mythology of it.

361
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,610
I didn't see the talk obviously,

362
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:52,080
but how was the Sarah Silverman,

363
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:52,531
Ted Talk?

364
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:53,364
They never let out.

365
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,353
Wow.

366
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,193
We need to get serious.

367
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,290
I need to run into her somewhere.

368
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,730
I could,

369
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,580
I couldn't make it happen.

370
00:09:59,610 --> 00:09:59,791
Okay.

371
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,624
Am I going to happen hurt?

372
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,140
Um,

373
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,770
I,

374
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,330
uh,

375
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,770
I've never heard anything
bad about ted before,

376
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,750
so that's why this is such a shock.

377
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,800
It is weird though.

378
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:11,100
You meet the donors and stuff and
they can't tell Asian people apart.

379
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,470
They can't tell African
people apart and it's just,

380
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,460
it's weird man.

381
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:16,530
Like they're nice and
everybody means well.

382
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,880
Did they call you David Cho?

383
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,281
No.

384
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:24,480
They just mistake you for other fellows
because so many of them are Asian.

385
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:25,470
Really?

386
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,041
That's funny.

387
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,820
Yeah.

388
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,560
How many different
people do it every year?

389
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,340
Uh,

390
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,370
every year they pick like 20 fellows and
then they pick a bunch of other people

391
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:33,270
for the main stage.

392
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,380
So yeah.

393
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:34,711
I mean,

394
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:34,861
no,

395
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:35,550
it is,

396
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,020
it is a ill organization.

397
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,381
I still,

398
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:38,670
even though they booted me today,

399
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,150
I,

400
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,200
I love the speakers.

401
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,270
I love the talks and
I want it to continue,

402
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:43,620
but I hope that they,

403
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:44,390
at least,

404
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:44,730
you know,

405
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,350
they can say I suck and that's fine.

406
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:46,780
They can be like,

407
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,580
Eddie's a shithead.

408
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,301
He went to la,

409
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:50,280
he did the fucking podcast and he sucks,

410
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,800
but I hope they just changed
the rules for future people.

411
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:54,300
So you didn't do anything wrong.

412
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,360
They're crazy and all they represent is
a distribution method for the greatest

413
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:01,080
minds on earth.

414
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,250
That's all they represent.

415
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,410
It's not that they are the
greatest minds on earth,

416
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,990
it's just there's so many
interesting people today.

417
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,850
We live in an amazing time.

418
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,620
And just when you good,

419
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:11,730
something like Ted,

420
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,830
whatever the Ted stands for,

421
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,950
it became synonymous on the
Internet with fascinating talks.

422
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:17,370
Yeah,

423
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,060
boom.

424
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,893
And then it's off.

425
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,990
But if you want you
could do to Eddie Wong's,

426
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,770
you know,

427
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,460
fascinating motherfuckers on
vice and do the exact same thing.

428
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,560
I think there's a lot of room for that.

429
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:32,010
Cause conferences like I would
love to hear more people from,

430
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,520
you know,

431
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,151
downtown La,

432
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,850
downtown New York and talking and doing
these ideas because they don't find

433
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:36,301
those dudes.

434
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:37,380
They find academics,

435
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,450
they find people playing
ancient instruments.

436
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:40,800
They find people that are,

437
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:41,161
you know,

438
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:44,910
working nature things and they have
their kind of like cultural sect,

439
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,690
you know.

440
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,330
But there is a lot of room to
find genius in other places,

441
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:49,110
geniuses everywhere.

442
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,943
You know this,

443
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,030
you travel around the world,

444
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:52,290
you find genius anywhere.

445
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:56,080
So there's room for conferences that
like look under different cultures cause

446
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:58,060
they're kind of looking under
the same stones all the time.

447
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:58,841
Right.

448
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:00,370
And they're going to run out of bugs.

449
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:00,670
Yeah.

450
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,503
And I'm one of the,

451
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,760
I'm one of the first time
they've stepped out to be like,

452
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:04,500
all right,

453
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,350
there's this dude,

454
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,101
he's Chinese,

455
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:06,821
he's into hip hop.

456
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:07,960
He lives in downtown New York.

457
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:08,980
He used to sell drugs.

458
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:10,420
He now has a restaurant.

459
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:10,580
Um,

460
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,380
I think I was the only working
chef that was a ted fellow.

461
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,250
So I,

462
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,350
I was one of their choices
that was really out there,

463
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:20,350
but it just didn't work out but didn't
work out because you're not willing to be

464
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,980
a fucking slave and sleep in a hotel
room with a stranger for a week.

465
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:24,370
Yeah.

466
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,121
That's insane.

467
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:25,540
They had me.

468
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,860
I rehearsed for two days.

469
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:27,760
I fucking did the tour.

470
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,990
I did everything I'm supposed to do,

471
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:29,560
and then I was like,

472
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,870
I'm going to just piece out for
like a half day and they bugged.

473
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,471
Wow.

474
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:33,304
You know you.

475
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:33,910
That's,

476
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,743
that's crazy.

477
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,980
And it's fact that they don't pay you.

478
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:36,700
It's crazy.

479
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,380
You guys need to do a vice show.

480
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:39,670
Exposing Ted how?

481
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:40,600
Loony tabs.

482
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,310
I told vice that I told,

483
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,750
I said before I got booted,

484
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:44,650
I sent them an email like,

485
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:44,861
Yo,

486
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:45,730
you got to see this shit.

487
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,770
It's like the beginnings of Scientology.

488
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,810
Wow.

489
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,730
It is so true that once people have a
position of power and influence and people

490
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:56,020
want to be a part of them,

491
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,610
people go corrupt.

492
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,513
Yup.

493
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,890
What is the threshold at which
something becomes a religion?

494
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:03,760
You know,

495
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,810
it's kind of insane.

496
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,090
It's so easy to start a cult today.

497
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:07,780
Yeah.

498
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,790
There's so many people
looking at jump on board.

499
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,390
You know?

500
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,810
All the people that would have a
hundred years ago become Catholics now.

501
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:14,111
They're like,

502
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,944
man,

503
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,930
I just won't stop fucking kids.

504
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:17,920
I can't do this.

505
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,450
I needed a new cult.

506
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,231
I don't know why.

507
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,460
People still believe in these.

508
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:23,440
Really like you look at
what these people are doing.

509
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,430
Like what these,

510
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,230
what's happening in the Catholic church.

511
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,100
It's insane.

512
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:28,330
Fucking popes resigning.

513
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,840
Cause the first time it's gotten so hot
that the pope's like I'm Outta here.

514
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,000
He's asked for immunity from the Catholic,

515
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:34,511
from the,

516
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:34,970
uh,

517
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,890
Italian government,

518
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,150
from prosecution because he's
responsible for shielding pedophiles.

519
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,320
He personally,

520
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,760
and a lot of people don't know this,

521
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,820
the pope personally responsible for taking
pedophiles and shifting them away to

522
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:50,020
another place where they molested markets.

523
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,130
And what would you expect?

524
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:51,610
You don't,

525
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,320
these people aren't allowed to have sex.

526
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,120
It's natural to want to have sex.

527
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,430
It's natural to want to
go to La and do podcasts.

528
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:57,720
You know,

529
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,030
soon you cannot come to Ted
and have sex without condoms.

530
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:01,391
I'd be like,

531
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:01,930
fuck that.

532
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,140
You could imagine no unprotected sex.

533
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:05,980
No raw dogging.

534
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,000
Attend illegal.

535
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,920
No Ass fucking while you're here.

536
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:09,783
Oh Man.

537
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,073
Ted Fellow.

538
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,943
There'll be a mutiny.

539
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,540
I wonder if they would have like you,

540
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,140
you could slowly start
imposing behavior standards,

541
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:17,411
you know,

542
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:18,071
on fellows,

543
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:18,221
you know,

544
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:19,960
if you want to call it
like a ted fellow or,

545
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:22,030
or whatever new organization
you want to start,

546
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,691
they do shit.

547
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:23,800
Like you should have a standing,

548
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:25,890
you should give a standing
ovation when this person comes,

549
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,800
you should do this and that.

550
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:27,643
It's easy.

551
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:28,830
It's all,

552
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,291
wait a minute,

553
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:29,860
wait a minute.

554
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,300
Fake standing ovations.

555
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:31,490
Yeah.

556
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,680
And they were also saying like,

557
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,981
you know,

558
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:33,791
when the founder comes,

559
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,770
Chris Anderson comes like,

560
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,760
you don't have to give
him a standing ovation.

561
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:37,120
Like,

562
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,541
you know,

563
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,470
it's nice if you want to,

564
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:40,300
but he doesn't actually need you to do it.

565
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,080
I'm like,

566
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,710
the fact that you needed to give me this
fake halfway disclaimer is so fucking

567
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:45,370
strange.

568
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:45,821
Wow.

569
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:47,130
That's so strange.

570
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,070
Yeah.

571
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,310
They tell you who to and not to give
standing ovations to who's allowed to

572
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:52,761
apply.

573
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:55,090
You have to apply to go to Ted to attend.

574
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,420
And then once you're accepted,

575
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:57,860
you pay $8,000.

576
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,013
Well,

577
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,590
that's a mind fuck.

578
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,520
Wait a minute.

579
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,690
You had to pay.

580
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:02,991
No.

581
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:03,441
Hell No.

582
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:03,650
I did.

583
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,670
But the people who do it,

584
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,533
they applied.

585
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,291
Okay.

586
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,260
So the people that attend
these strict audience members,

587
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:12,410
you're saying you got to want
to be so down so bad to do that,

588
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,780
to go through an application
process and then fucking pay.

589
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,680
That's a lot of money.

590
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,210
How many people are going now?

591
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:17,790
Maybe we'll go.

592
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,140
I don't know.

593
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,471
I think,

594
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:18,830
uh,

595
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,910
like 2000,

596
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:20,270
3000.

597
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,530
Whoa.

598
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,820
Holy Shit.

599
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,420
Yeah.

600
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,320
That's a lot of money.

601
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:25,910
They make holy shit.

602
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,600
Yeah.

603
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,530
That's a lot of money.

604
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,070
Yeah.

605
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,581
They make off it.

606
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:29,414
Yeah.

607
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:29,960
Yeah.

608
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,780
2000 people paying $8,000 is how much?

609
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,733
Uh,

610
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,573
six,

611
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,121
300.

612
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:35,780
60,000?

613
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,111
No,

614
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:37,090
1600.

615
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:37,963
What is it?

616
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,080
160,000?

617
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:39,460
No.

618
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:39,560
Oh,

619
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,490
is that we're going to be more,

620
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:40,701
no,

621
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:41,690
it's way more than that.

622
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,280
It's like 16 million I think,

623
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,450
but yeah,

624
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,500
2000,

625
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,350
2000 and 16 million.

626
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,243
2000 Times.

627
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,280
You don't know shit about your numbers
and I didn't even bother counting gay

628
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,160
Asian always.

629
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:58,360
I'm asking agents from now on
January 16 million in Miami.

630
00:15:58,361 --> 00:15:59,450
You silly bitch.

631
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,121
What is it,

632
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:02,480
Brian?

633
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:02,841
Do you,

634
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:04,480
do you ever calculate a builtin?

635
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,750
What's the number?

636
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,260
What's number 2000 times
8,000 got gotta be 16 million.

637
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,310
What's 2000 times 8,000

638
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,190
this might answer your question.

639
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,180
Uh,

640
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,150
it is 1.6 million I think.

641
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,590
Oh,

642
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,770
1.6 million.

643
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,850
That was one off.

644
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,683
I was excited.

645
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,380
Okay.

646
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,580
That makes a lot of bread.

647
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,500
So they made 1.6 million.

648
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:30,680
Oh No,

649
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,550
it's 16 million.

650
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,461
16 million.

651
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:32,610
Okay.

652
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,010
Yeah.

653
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:33,351
All right,

654
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:35,330
so human calculator was fast.

655
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,193
Very nice.

656
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,771
So,

657
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:37,070
um,

658
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,060
they made 16 million,

659
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:39,080
which is even crazier.

660
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,420
And they did this in this time where
you were there and no one got paid.

661
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:44,960
Paid.

662
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,890
Nobody got paid.

663
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,300
Wow.

664
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,070
Yup.

665
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:48,980
We are suckers,

666
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:49,814
dude.

667
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,631
Why suckers?

668
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:52,820
And they're always telling you
like you're going to get exposure.

669
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:53,654
It was like no lie.

670
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,700
More people listen to
the Joe Rogan experience.

671
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:56,721
That's true.

672
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:57,140
Ted.

673
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,860
Suck it.

674
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,550
Yeah.

675
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,383
Ted,

676
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,950
we got you beat by like a million.

677
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,640
Yup.

678
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,840
But that's still nuts,

679
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:03,410
man.

680
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,400
That's a lot of money.

681
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:05,390
We're not making that money.

682
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,290
We need to make that money.

683
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,820
We got to get 80,000 people.

684
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,920
Joe Rogan had $1 million each.

685
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,933
I know how to do it.

686
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:11,720
All right.

687
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,710
I'm going to just raise the bar and
only get really stupid rich people.
