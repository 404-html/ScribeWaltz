1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,461
Dum,
dum,

2
00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:00,911
dum,
dum,

3
00:00:00,911 --> 00:00:03,330
dum,
[inaudible].

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,120
Yes.
We're live John Dudley.

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,940
Phone away.
And let's get popping.

6
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:10,720
No,
I got,

7
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,710
I,
I have some,

8
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,290
some important subjects that I wanted to
vent about.

9
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,920
So did you put them on a little note?
Yeah,

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,010
I've got a notepad.
I'm pretty good about doing homework.

11
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:24,640
So I love your podcast.
So listening through there is craft you

12
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:25,660
talked about.
I was like,

13
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,640
Oh yeah,
I got to get on.

14
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,820
Are you got to bring it up?
Yeah.

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,670
So John Dudley,
world famous archery coach.

16
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,780
Uh,
he's got a TV show.

17
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,280
He's got a podcast,
uh,

18
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,360
found out about you because of the TV
show first,

19
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,380
the podcast Sacramento.
I became obsessed with.

20
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,020
If you're in the archery,
like I know some of these people that

21
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:44,110
are listening to this podcast,
they get into archery because it sounds

22
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:44,560
fun.
Like,

23
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,730
Ooh,
maybe I need a new hobby.

24
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,490
And then you go down that crazy rabbit
hole.

25
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,750
Well,
what I found you,

26
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,330
you're,
you're down the rabbit hole like a few

27
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:53,710
light years.
You're gone,

28
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:55,130
man.
Freaking Johnny Depp.

29
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,660
Then Johnny,
you're gone.

30
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,790
You're gone down though.
The archery rabbit hole.

31
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,680
I had no idea the rabbit hole goes so
deep,

32
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:05,320
but let's show this video.
We're going to play this video.

33
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:08,060
This is before John came up here.
He did.

34
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,670
Now I just set need to explain how
difficult it is just to even hit a

35
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:15,790
target at 100 yards.
This is at a hundred.

36
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,540
Yeah.
One hundred yards is a football length

37
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,340
of a football field and I'm gonna.
Shut that thing off.

38
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,690
It's just shut the volume off there.
I'm 100 yards of length of a football

39
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:30,691
field and for archery is just.
It's so hard to hit something as wide as

40
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:35,320
your wingspan at 100 yards for the
average person,

41
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,620
and so John made this ridiculous shot on
one of the gorilla kettlebells from

42
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,960
onnit.
Yeah,

43
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,440
this was a solo play.
This here,

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,320
unbelievable challenge.
I've got Joe Rogan's favorite workout

45
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:51,960
tool.
I've got an onnit kettle,

46
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:56,430
Bell,
primal and Kong is going to have to make

47
00:01:56,431 --> 00:02:00,270
a decision whether he's going to let
this era pass or not.

48
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,300
I'm going to try to put an Arrow through
that two inch handle right there and

49
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:10,671
actually at this distance of a hundred
yards and the angle that arrows to come

50
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,860
in,
I bet it's even smaller.

51
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,440
This is going to be an unbelievable
challenge.

52
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:18,360
Definitely going to have to defy the
odds,

53
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,170
my ideas.
There it is right here on this shelf and

54
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:27,171
I've got a curtain right behind so
hopefully it'll stop the Arrow but also

55
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,800
let it do its thing so that would
capture all this on tape right at dark.

56
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,300
I'm going to put an Arrow through a two
inch gap and the handle if calm lets it

57
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:41,934
pass.

58
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,770
There it is.
Check it out.

59
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,160
Just so ridiculous

60
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,090
that that actually went in that little
hole at 100 yards.

61
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,570
Did you have to try more than one
attempt at.

62
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,610
This was actually my first shot with
everything set up because I had to do a

63
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:16,540
little bit of homework.
What I did was I knew I couldn't see the

64
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:21,040
hole in the handle good enough to aim at
it,

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,280
so I actually cited my bow into where I
hit four and a half inches high from

66
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,030
Kong's face,
so I literally aimed right at Kong shiny

67
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:35,290
face and I had my both cited in to hit
four and a half inches high to make it

68
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,940
through the gap.
That's insane.

69
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,200
Yup.
Yeah.

70
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,590
Spellman right here.
Sharon was running the iphone but I had

71
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:46,530
four cameras out so we can get some cool
angles and stuff and I wanted to wait

72
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:50,020
till night so that that lighted nock
could give a little bit more.

73
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:55,021
Wow factor for everyone watching this.
It's such a ridiculous shot,

74
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,020
but this is a hundred yards thanks to
the audit people to for that was awesome

75
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:04,480
and getting that thing look at that and
it was pretty crazy.

76
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,230
There you go,
Joe.

77
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,880
How awesome is that?

78
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,750
It's pretty amazing.
And you guys watch that on Youtube.

79
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:15,760
It just went off on youtube.
On the knock on archery.

80
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:16,750
Yeah.
Not.

81
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,370
Did you guys put it up to you?
We'll put a link up.

82
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:19,400
Okay.
Jamie just put you,

83
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,120
if you can tweet it and I'll,
I'll retweet it when we get a chance.

84
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,780
That is insanely hard to do.
It's A.

85
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,160
I mean,
I never did any archery whatsoever until

86
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:29,590
about three years ago.
I mean,

87
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:33,160
maybe I might've done it.
I think I might've done it in the boy

88
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:34,060
scouts.
Yeah.

89
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:38,170
Everyone says that.
You know what's funny is every person

90
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,470
that finds out one,
they're in disbelief that there's

91
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:44,890
actually like professional archers,
but then they say,

92
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,560
oh,
I tried archery like back in school on

93
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:50,710
time and Jim and I loved it and,
but then everyone says,

94
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,750
but I hit my arm.
Right.

95
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,080
Remember that they tried it once and
they loved it,

96
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:57,190
but they hit their arm.

97
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,740
That's what they always say.
Yeah.

98
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,700
That's.
I always thought you had to wear those

99
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,750
risk.
Things.

100
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,580
Like when I would see people that were
shooting bows without those risks

101
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:06,170
things.
I'm like,

102
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,020
they're like riding a motorcycle without
a helmet.

103
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,630
These people are crazy.
They're loose people.

104
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,730
Well,
the way some people shoot it is like

105
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:15,170
riding a bike without a helmet,
appeal some skin off.

106
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,350
You do it the wrong way.
Well,

107
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,300
that's what I've been going into over
these last couple of days with you and

108
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:22,630
this one more more fascinating aspects
about this.

109
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,150
I want to.
I don't want to call it a sport because

110
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:27,760
I think archery is a lot of different
things.

111
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:33,030
It's a discipline for sure,
but in when it's done correctly in lot

112
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:35,850
of ways it's almost like a martial art.
It's like learning.

113
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,540
It's like a weapon.
Art,

114
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,750
like in martial arts,
when you see someone do something,

115
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:42,910
like if someone's like really good at
judo or something like that,

116
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,200
like when they execute throw and it's
just perfect position and perfect

117
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:47,680
technique.

118
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,910
It's beautiful.
You know,

119
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,350
this is like a beauty to it.
Yeah.

120
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,150
And when you see an an archer like I was
talking to you about that this when I

121
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:57,290
was watching and trying to get it in my
head,

122
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,470
this sort of follow that you have in
what you do and it's super similar in a

123
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:06,260
lot of ways and something that I really
didn't predict.

124
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,620
Like I guess I just always assumed that
I kind of know what something is.

125
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:13,680
If it seems pretty straightforward,
like,

126
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:16,100
oh yeah,
you pull the string back and then you

127
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:18,010
let the Arrow fly.
Pretty straightforward,

128
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,980
like I think that's most people's idea
of what archery is,

129
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,310
but then when you really pay attention
to the technical aspects of all the

130
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:31,510
different stuff that's going on and all
the different things you think about and

131
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,140
how you literally can not have anything
on your mind other than all the

132
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:38,300
technique involved,
your foot placement,

133
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:39,980
your technique,
and standing,

134
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:42,680
your breathing,
where you're drawing it back,

135
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:46,130
the position of your front shoulder,
the position of your rear elbow,

136
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,410
how you're pulling,
where it,

137
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,110
how,
what do you,

138
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,940
how do you respond after the hour was
released?

139
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,910
There's so much going on that like when
you put it all together like it,

140
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:58,160
it has.
It leaves no room for homework.

141
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,410
There's no room for relationship
bullshit.

142
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:02,660
There's no room for taxes.
There's no room in there.

143
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:04,460
Man.
If you want to make a nice shot like

144
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:05,930
that,
like I guarantee you,

145
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:10,931
if we can have a brain scan of your head
the second you release that Arrow at a

146
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,160
hundred yards to go in that two inch
gap,

147
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,360
there would be nothing in there other
than what you did.

148
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,420
It would be no other.
No other cells would be fired up.

149
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,040
Nope.

150
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,180
No.
That's one thing.

151
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:24,970
And actually like yesterday when we were
shooting

152
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,863
there,

153
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,400
the end of the day,
you got to the point where you almost,

154
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,410
your mind was clear.
It's almost like for me,

155
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,540
you know,
your family came home,

156
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,380
like things are winding down.
You knew that like work was over and we.

157
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,780
It was like right before dark and like
for me,

158
00:07:42,781 --> 00:07:47,280
I love shooting at first light and it
lasts light because it seems like that's

159
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:50,580
what I'm not really worried about.
Someone texting me or calling me.

160
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:55,440
I'm not worried about problem at home
and I shoot with a clear mind and I am

161
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:59,700
way more efficient in my practice and it
is a form of meditation.

162
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:01,590
I mean,
it's like you said,

163
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:06,150
it's an art and if you're clouded than
you,

164
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,210
it will reflect that on the target.
I mean it's like if your arrows are in

165
00:08:11,341 --> 00:08:14,550
one spot,
then you know you have a single focus

166
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,550
and it's almost like the more those
arrows are spread,

167
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:22,551
that's a representation of how many
other thoughts and distractions you have

168
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,030
going in your mind.
I mean,

169
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:29,031
and I look at it that way when I shoot,
I'm trying to narrow everything down to

170
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:32,910
just a movement and you look at good
golfers,

171
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,410
the ones that swing easy and it just
literally looks like flow.

172
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,120
There's such good strikers and there's
so much more efficient when you see

173
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,290
people that are trying to be robotic
and,

174
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,400
and almost like hack something.
Then it's like too systematic.

175
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,840
You know,
you see someone like that does

176
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:54,960
professional karate or something.
If they're in a forums competition,

177
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:55,980
if they're like

178
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,340
real rigid going around.
It's just not what it's meant to be.

179
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:03,690
I mean it's supposed to be a dance.
It's supposed to be like literally a

180
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:08,691
mental musical that's plan and if your
mind is clear then it's,

181
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,770
it's a form of meditation really is no
question about it.

182
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:18,771
And that same state of total complete
concentration exists in a bunch of

183
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:21,980
different disciplines and I,
you know,

184
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,920
finding it in archery now rec or I
should say recognizing it,

185
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:29,130
I definitely haven't hit it.
But finding that,

186
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,160
seeing it and recognizing that sort of a
super high level flow that comes into

187
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:38,850
play when someone's excellent at what
they do.

188
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,590
Um,
I've seen that in pool.

189
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:44,670
I've seen that watching professional
pool players like perfect example of

190
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:47,730
what you were talking about,
striking the ball really hard as a

191
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:50,600
golfer.
There's a guy named Francisco Bustamante

192
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,450
is one of the best pool players in the
world and he's from the Philippines and

193
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:59,451
Francisco Bustamante has the most
ridiculous break you would think if you

194
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:03,990
watch his break shot,
that he weighs 400 pounds and has arms

195
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:04,920
like tree trunks.

196
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,180
You watch that break just blah,
blah,

197
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:10,310
blah.
It all just the triangle.

198
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:13,110
If you watch them,
just watch the speed of the ball and

199
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,420
it's effortless.
The way he does it,

200
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:18,120
he's just,
he has this perfect amount of timing and

201
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:19,980
flow here.
You could see him do it here.

202
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,410
This isn't him.
This is a different guy.

203
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:27,010
It just look up a Bustamante Francisco
Bustamante breaking.

204
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,740
That's what it says that there.
Well,

205
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,770
there's definitely not him.
This is a some overweight gentlemen.

206
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,630
What if it gained.
Oh,

207
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,463
that is him.
That is.

208
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,760
He was just.
It's a weird.

209
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,110
He's in a weird pose.
Oh,

210
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:40,110
that's what it is.
It's just a weird pose.

211
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,050
I thought when he was bent over,
I thought that was his whole body.

212
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,670
Yeah,
it's loading,

213
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,730
but he's a tiny guy.
Like if you see him physically.

214
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,600
Yeah.
I mean he.

215
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,390
It might weigh like,
well he's a little fat now he's getting

216
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:53,340
older,
but when he was young he probably

217
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:55,470
weighed like 140 pounds,
but he was like,

218
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,260
oh my goodness.

219
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,330
Those balls,
they go flying everywhere.

220
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,480
No one's like him.
Jihad dog.

221
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,000
He's excited.
I think he just one on the break or

222
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:09,630
something like that.
I've seen him make six balls on the

223
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:11,160
brake,
like he's playing nine ball.

224
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:13,830
He make six balls in the break.
He's got three balls to run out.

225
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,050
It's just insanely good,
but he's just a devastating player all

226
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:21,360
around.
And one of the things when you watch him

227
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:24,600
play and a lot of the Filipinos,
Filipinos are so good.

228
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,850
There's so many really good Filipino
pool players,

229
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:30,240
but they have this gentle flow to what
they're doing.

230
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,350
Like everything is like a ballet,
like effortless.

231
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,120
Deloitte of the q does like all the work
and everything looks like it looks like

232
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:42,290
so flowing.
Like a dance,

233
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,710
like a dance.
Well,

234
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,270
the one thing that's so cool about,
well the one thing I'm really proud of

235
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:51,420
is an archer,
is that I've got to the point where I

236
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:54,220
have a platform to get people involved.
And that was

237
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,190
when I found out that you really liked
my podcasts,

238
00:11:57,191 --> 00:12:02,191
which the podcasts are totally geared
around education and learning.

239
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,980
You know,
that's what that I got to a platform to

240
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:07,840
where I could help people.
And now there's people like you that are

241
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:12,520
coming in that never really have
considered that whole world.

242
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,980
And they come in and I look at people
that like,

243
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,320
you know,
they go to the YMC A,

244
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:19,480
they want to take like touchy or they
want to take yoga.

245
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,850
They're looking for a stress free type
of hobby.

246
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,490
And archery is a great sport for that.
It's growing so much.

247
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,800
I mean Hollywood's embracing it
obviously with a lot of the movies,

248
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,160
but they're,
they're not portraying it as an art

249
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:39,370
form.
When that movie the hell's it called,

250
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,580
where's the girl who go hungry again

251
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,500
when she started becoming more famous or
that movie rather became popular.

252
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,160
Archery took off.

253
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,950
Oh yeah.
A lot of people got involved.

254
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:51,461
Yeah.
I mean,

255
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:52,550
you look at,
um,

256
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,380
you look at the avengers,
you look at hunger games,

257
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,420
there's,
there's actually so many,

258
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:00,620
even a lot of the sitcoms now p,
you know,

259
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,700
obviously crossbows are popular because
of the walking dead,

260
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:08,460
but when it comes to like true archery,
you just see a lot more archers coming

261
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:09,460
in.
Lord of the rings,

262
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:11,850
you know,
legless was so popular because of,

263
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,510
because of that.
And it's really such a cool sport.

264
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:18,220
I mean,
it's an Olympic sport and we've.

265
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,450
We've actually have a phenomenal Olympic
team here in the US.

266
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,270
Our men's team is definitely going to be
contenders for another metal.

267
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:29,170
They were silver medalist last year and
so you were saying that compound bows

268
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:30,910
are not in the Olympics and the recurve
bows,

269
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:36,270
it's recurve bows and that's kind of a
tradition and honestly it's a different

270
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:39,790
style of art,
but it's super graceful to.

271
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,740
And I mean I think it's everyone has
something that they like to do.

272
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,680
Some people like the simplicity of a
sport.

273
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,800
It's like there's people that go and
want to only have a long bow or they

274
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:56,290
don't want sites.
They just want the zen part of trying to

275
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:00,100
pull back with with no sites,
but then there's also people like us

276
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,960
that want to see how finite and accurate
you can become.

277
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,790
So they liked the techie side,
which is where compound bows come in and

278
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,050
they're just.
They're much more efficient and

279
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:16,051
obviously the accuracy as we seen is,
is almost mindblowing mindblowing

280
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,520
guy like me because I'm a gadget dork.
So it combines both things.

281
00:14:23,191 --> 00:14:28,110
It combines the zen aspect of complete
and total discipline and focus and

282
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,980
looking at one task and be drowning out
the rest of the world,

283
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,960
but it also has like geeky stuff,
like different kinds of sites and this

284
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:40,080
is a new cam that they just came out
with and these are different kinds of

285
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:43,470
strings and when you do this,
that makes this better and this is so

286
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:44,550
much going on with it.

287
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,690
Oh yeah.
You can,

288
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,600
you know,
if I look back at the bose I started

289
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:53,210
with and I've,
I've only been shooting since 97,

290
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,360
so 19 years I guess it seemed.
I'm getting old now,

291
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,830
but um,
that's a long time.

292
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,670
The bose that I use then that are at the
house.

293
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,630
You wonder how in the heck he shot that
good with.

294
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:07,280
Um,
and actually,

295
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,010
um,
two months ago I was at the Olympic

296
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,050
headquarters,
like the Olympic Museum.

297
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,490
So they have all these awesome Olympic
artifacts of like swim trunks,

298
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:18,460
people oil or like,
you know,

299
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,640
the javelin.
I got to see the original recurve bow,

300
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,000
like Jay bars was actually on display
and they constantly change them.

301
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:29,150
So if you're visiting the museum,
you're not seeing the same things all

302
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:32,180
the time,
but you look at those pieces of

303
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,740
equipment,
the bikes,

304
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,770
the bikes that people wrote in the
Olympic Games,

305
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:37,820
it's like,
holy cow,

306
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,380
how are they that efficient?

307
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:44,650
It's almost more impressive because now
we've gotten so advanced in our

308
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:49,640
equipment that it's easier to be at the
level,

309
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,620
I think than 20 years ago because the
equipment just wasn't there.

310
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,370
You know,
I almost wonder if those people didn't

311
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:03,371
have to put in two or three times the
time and be just that much more elegant

312
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:09,530
at what they did because their equipment
was almost a handicap back then.

313
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,240
Could they perform the same kind of
feats?

314
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:13,370
Like could someone shoot an Arrow like
that?

315
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:17,840
Like was it a common thing to be able to
shoot what you did 100 yards and

316
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:20,450
shooting through that two inch opening
into the Kettlebell handle?

317
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,780
Um,
I'm sure there are people that were,

318
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:26,030
there's a lot,
there's actually a lot of people in

319
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:28,100
archery now that are pushing this
envelope.

320
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:31,070
I mean,
long distance shooting is becoming super

321
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:36,071
popular and you know,
to a lot of the real target archers that

322
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,480
are out there that are listening to this
podcast.

323
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,970
See,
when we go to a full feed of tournament,

324
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,460
we shoot 30 feet,
fetus stand for um,

325
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,300
well now it's world archery.
So a world archery event.

326
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,870
If you shot a,
a full target round,

327
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,380
you would shoot arrows at 30 or 30
meters,

328
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:57,230
50 meters,
70 meters and 90 meters.

329
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,190
So I found out from you that 90 meters
is 99 yards.

330
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,280
It's one of the easiest metric
conversions that do.

331
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:07,760
You take the first number and you add it
to the second.

332
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,820
So if you've got 40,
take the floor and added behind the 40,

333
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,100
you got 44 yards.
If it's 40 meters.

334
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:16,040
So yeah,
that's one of the one metric system that

335
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:20,930
I never forget,
but I'm so 99 yards is where we would

336
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:23,360
stand on the line and shoot at,
you know,

337
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:26,960
and I,
I think I told you that back in 2005,

338
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:31,961
I was really focused on shooting well
for the u s team when I was on the

339
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,330
compound team and there were several
tournaments that I was really focused

340
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:35,570
on.

341
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,400
I knew that I was going to be shooting.
I'm a national championship and in

342
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,550
Britain and in Australia,
I was going to be going.

343
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:46,940
I think I shot one in Poland,
um,

344
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,320
had won one or two here in the.
But you know,

345
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:55,800
in that year I think I logged.
I mean I shot two,

346
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,980
three,
$400 a day and 90 meters for me,

347
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:02,940
the further you go out,
it's like putting a bigger microscope on

348
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,130
things that you're doing wrong.
You know,

349
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:06,990
it's,
it's just like an art or um,

350
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,770
if you look at a golfer that's making
long putts,

351
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,750
obviously it's magnifying mistakes and
they're swinging or golfers that are

352
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:16,800
drivers,
you know,

353
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:20,400
people that really are just sitting
there trying to be accurate at the long

354
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:22,230
game.
It magnifies mistakes.

355
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:24,720
So I really like shooting at longer
distances.

356
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:29,721
I know you do too because it magnifies a
mistake and you can correct it easier

357
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:33,090
and it really helps bring things
together.

358
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:38,090
But that year I shot well over 30,000
arrows at 99 yards during steering

359
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,240
training things.
Yeah.

360
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,430
I mean,
and there's professional archers,

361
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:47,610
there's archery,
there's archers right now somewhere

362
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:50,400
that's preparing for a world cup event
or something.

363
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,550
And there's people that literally have
calluses thicker and most weightlifters

364
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,070
just from grabbing a hold of that
release or you know,

365
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:03,480
I remember looking at an Olympic recurve
shooters fingers one time,

366
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,090
um,
and I remember his,

367
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,060
his hands,
his three fingers that he grabs a string

368
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:12,540
with.
It looked like a frog hand because the

369
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:17,130
tips were so big from pulling blood
because he,

370
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,800
and I mean these guys,
you look at the people that are like the

371
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:22,470
Olympic training centers that are just
there,

372
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:25,680
they get up,
they go eat and then they shoot until

373
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:29,880
five or six at night and they eat and
then they go and do a weight training

374
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:30,714
session.

375
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,260
I bet you there's people that do a
thousand errors a day.

376
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,060
So you know,
you can build up some stamina.

377
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:41,310
Yeah,
it's really impressive.

378
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,830
Um,
but in saying that,

379
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:46,970
I think with archery it's,
you know,

380
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,380
you know that I'm really big into
fitness as well.

381
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:54,381
I credit my fitness and my story is an
athlete prior to being an archer as part

382
00:19:57,091 --> 00:20:02,010
of what's helped me be successful and
there's a big difference between

383
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,280
quantity and quality and a lot of people
make the mistake I think with any sport

384
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:13,500
of just trying to practice more or train
more.

385
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,140
And even weightlifters,
you know,

386
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:20,490
I see people that I go in the gym and
they're like on one exercise and then

387
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:25,491
when I leave the gym in 50 minutes or an
hour were like maybe done two different

388
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:28,950
types of exercise and it's just,
it's not efficient,

389
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,220
you know,
I think a lot of people as athletes

390
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,230
sometimes miss the boat of quality over
over the quantity in.

391
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:42,130
And I was always that way.
There's days where I go practice and I

392
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,960
may only make 100 shots,
but once I started realizing that I'm

393
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:48,250
breaking down,
I know to step away.

394
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,890
You don't try to push through it.
Yeah.

395
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,200
And I told you that yesterday too.
There was a time where I said,

396
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,970
you know,
if,

397
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,060
if we're just out here getting
repetition,

398
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,210
I guess that's one thing,
but we really don't need to do that.

399
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:04,060
Aiming at a target.
We had a really good point too about

400
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:09,090
those bad shots and bad repetitions.
You gotta you gotta get those out of

401
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,980
your head.
So it's not just that you made a bad

402
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:14,020
shot.
Now you have to make a bunch of good

403
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:17,470
shots to try to get away with you from
the effect of the bad shot.

404
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,200
It's not as simple as the one bad shot.
No,

405
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:21,070
it's imprinting.

406
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,820
I mean it's,
it's an imprint and I think with any

407
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:26,590
type of athletic,
you know,

408
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:28,060
and it's probably that way with
fighters.

409
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:33,061
I'm sure too if you get someone that's
just really in a rhythm and a flow,

410
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,560
if also when they start making a mistake
or doing something bad as a coach,

411
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:43,561
he try to get them back into that rhythm
again so that you can weed out that

412
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,190
imprint.
You know,

413
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:47,290
and that's tough as an athlete sometimes
you know,

414
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,900
people that,
and I'm sure for fighters,

415
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:51,370
you know,
you look at people that come out and

416
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:54,460
have a disappointing loss.
It's almost like that's an imprint.

417
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,380
It is.
And that's why that statement and you're

418
00:21:56,381 --> 00:22:00,490
only as good as your last fight.
It was so disturbing to fighters.

419
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,260
Yeah.
And and that's one thing,

420
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:07,290
one of the most important things that I
learned as a competitive archer and I

421
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:12,850
was,
I had a temper when I first started as a

422
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:14,620
pro,
if I made a bad shot,

423
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,770
you know,
Kinda like when you kind of put one in

424
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:22,270
the pool
when you put one of the pool and you

425
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:23,710
were like,
frigate,

426
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,480
you are pissed off.

427
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,400
I,
that's how I would be on a,

428
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,170
on a,
on a tournament,

429
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,930
you know,
I would freak and ran my stabilizer

430
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:35,740
under the ground so hard that I would
crack it in my mind problem was.

431
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:39,760
And that just did it once I did a,
this is really complicated,

432
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:43,390
Geeky sort of an explanation folks,
but there's a certain type of release

433
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,050
where it's attention based release and
as we're practicing with and difference

434
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:49,990
between pulling a trigger and then
allowing the tension,

435
00:22:49,991 --> 00:22:52,450
but you have to hold the safety while
you pull it back.

436
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,090
Otherwise the Arrow just,
it just fly.

437
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,820
It means it's not like,
it's not like it's going to shoot

438
00:22:57,821 --> 00:22:59,140
anything.
It's going really slow,

439
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:04,290
but it logs in a very embarrassing and
just very disappointing when this book

440
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:07,180
comes off your thing,
as you're pulling the bow back,

441
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:09,730
it goes blank and you go,
what the fuck?

442
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,650
I did this.
I did it three times,

443
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,040
did it yesterday and today.
Super.

444
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,140
It's super embarrassing.
But uh,

445
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:17,921
so that's,
uh,

446
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:20,350
yeah,
I was definitely annoyed myself.

447
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,010
Well,
when I would make something like that,

448
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:26,950
that would really trigger me into a
pissed off realm,

449
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,580
I would let one mistake affect
everything else after that.

450
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:37,240
And a lot of athletes,
they're really good athletes that I

451
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:41,320
watch and any sport tennis players,
golfers,

452
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:46,650
the key is when you have a negative
moment to not let it affect what hasn't

453
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:52,040
happened yet.
So I'm a guy came up to me one time

454
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,640
after I made a bad shot and he could
tell I was getting hot and he looked at

455
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:57,200
me and he said,
you know,

456
00:23:57,201 --> 00:24:01,460
the only arrows you have control on
right now are the ones that are still in

457
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:04,610
that quiver.
And for me that,

458
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:09,611
like,
it completely changed my outcome as a

459
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:11,120
professional archer.

460
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,140
And I've,
I've brought so much of what archery has

461
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:20,141
done to me as an athlete into my life
and there's times were you just

462
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,040
something really torques you off and you
have to just like look at,

463
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,610
okay,
everything I do from here on out is the

464
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:32,990
only thing I have control on because
that's history.

465
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,420
There's no,
I haven't figured out a way.

466
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:40,100
Once that released,
glows playing to actually grab that

467
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,720
Arrow and pull it back and stick it back
in the quiver or put it back on the

468
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,260
string.
It's like a perfect representation of

469
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:50,480
life.
You make a decision.

470
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,920
If it was shit,
you have to reset and say,

471
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:59,120
what do I need to do with myself to get
back on track in life?

472
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:04,660
We make bad decisions at times,
but how do we make a good decision to

473
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,440
get back on,
get back online?

474
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:06,831
Yeah.
It's,

475
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:09,550
it's management of the mind in a lot of
ways.

476
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,950
Yup.
And it's one of the things that I also

477
00:25:11,951 --> 00:25:15,970
like about our true love about archery
is that it's absolute like you,

478
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:19,780
you can't pull that Arrow back like it's
flying through the air.

479
00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:22,240
And either it hits the Bullseye or you
missed.

480
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,500
It's just it is what it is.
It doesn't care about where you live.

481
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,180
It doesn't care who your uncle is,
it doesn't care how much money you make

482
00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:32,320
you here,
it doesn't care like the the arrows

483
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:35,530
going to go.
It's an absolute discipline and I think

484
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:39,320
you coming from professionals or coming
from sports or other sports background,

485
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,540
we played a lot of football
when you play sports,

486
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,360
but especially insanely competitive
sports,

487
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,480
you learn where all the edges are to be
had.

488
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,720
You learn with all the edges are to be
had as far as technique,

489
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,300
as far as conditioning,
so it all the different things you have

490
00:25:55,301 --> 00:25:57,400
to do in order to be successful and to
win.

491
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,210
And everyone knows that in most sports,
especially in the physical sport like

492
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:03,490
football,
there's a fucking lot of work involved.

493
00:26:03,491 --> 00:26:07,090
There's not a single person who jumps
off the bench who doesn't have any

494
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:09,370
training whatsoever and kicks ass and
football.

495
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,670
You just don't.
You gotta learn and you have to learn

496
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:16,210
how to move.
You have to learn all the different

497
00:26:16,211 --> 00:26:17,440
plays.
You have to learn.

498
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,480
Technique involved in different aspects
of the sport and I think coming from a

499
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:26,410
competitive background in athletics,
you've kind of translated that

500
00:26:26,411 --> 00:26:31,411
understanding of where all the problems
are in archery because there's a lot of

501
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:35,350
people that are like,
they don't have good coaching and so

502
00:26:35,351 --> 00:26:39,250
they start off with a lot of really bad
habits and then they have to figure out

503
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:42,190
a way to either break those habits or
they live with those habits and then

504
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:47,191
they do the best they with this sort of
limited path that they've carved in and

505
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:49,140
they seem to not be able to escape.

506
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,160
The same thing exists in martial arts.
One of the hardest things for me when I

507
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:58,161
used to teach was teaching people that
already had a bad technique imprinted in

508
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:01,770
their brain.
Like they would have one way of throwing

509
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:03,870
a kick or something like that and that
would have to go,

510
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:06,420
oh Jesus.
I got to figure out a way to break this

511
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:07,860
guy.
Have this thing.

512
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:10,590
Because as soon as he gets tired or as
soon as he panics,

513
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,390
the Nigos down,
the foot goes up.

514
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,100
It loses all the power of the hips,
don't engage.

515
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,420
It's like,
but if I could take a kid like a five

516
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:20,280
year old kid and show them that from the
beginning,

517
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,590
their instinct would be to throw it
correctly.

518
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:25,380
The instinct,
even when tired knee comes up,

519
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:30,410
hip turns over,
body extends full power and those things

520
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:35,280
are so hard to unlearn once you get like
a bad path.

521
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,480
That's why it's.
I really do think that archery and a lot

522
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:41,010
of ways is a martial art.

523
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,180
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

524
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,180
Well you look at the whole Asian culture
and I've said time and time again,

525
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:52,260
I've coached all over the world and you
know,

526
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:56,340
that's Kinda what I do now.
I do a lot of coaching that most people

527
00:27:56,341 --> 00:28:01,341
don't even know about with teams that
just would rather have confidentiality

528
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:05,610
and whether or not they're working with
an outside source,

529
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:07,080
which is great.
But when I,

530
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,810
the probably the best place I ever
taught was when I went to India because

531
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,900
I actually taught those a Ha.
I was supposed to have 16 archers.

532
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,450
Once I got there,
there was about 140.

533
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,720
I mean,
it was unbelievable the anyone they

534
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:28,920
thought could be a potential winner for
their team was there and there was so

535
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:33,690
many kids and you know,
adults that were there and I remember I

536
00:28:33,691 --> 00:28:38,430
took several members of the team that
had a bad habit of punching the trigger

537
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:43,170
and anticipating the shot,
which is a big negative in our tree and

538
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:44,220
I gave them a device.

539
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,140
Same one I gave you.
I gave him a release that forces them to

540
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:53,760
not think about actually aiming the
front side of the boat.

541
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,820
It's a device that makes them focus on
the movement of archery,

542
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,000
pulling through the bowl,
letting the front arm go for the back

543
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:06,540
arm to come back.
And I remember I gave him string and

544
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,910
that release.
I took all their bones away and locked

545
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:09,471
him up.
[inaudible].

546
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:11,550
I said,
until you can do this,

547
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,410
we're not going any further.
So I took those eight and I had them do

548
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:19,650
that to the side and then I came over
and I started trying to work on all

549
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:23,160
these other people and there was like
this person needed their boat,

550
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,430
worked on this person needed to watch me
shoot this,

551
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,860
people want to,
you know,

552
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,210
to take pictures or video of me
shooting.

553
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,160
Then we went to lunch.

554
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:37,310
Then the whole thing started over again.
Then when it came to dinnertime,

555
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,470
I told them,
you guys all go ahead.

556
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:42,100
I'm going to like,
pack up my gear.

557
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,740
Well,
once the whole big crowd left,

558
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:50,190
those same eight kids were still over
there with strings pulling on that

559
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:56,470
release and almost every one of them
were damn near bloody in their hand from

560
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:59,890
just executing.
And I came over.

561
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,000
I'm like,
oh my goodness.

562
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:03,130
Have you guys been here the whole day?
Yes sir.

563
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:05,350
Yes sir.
There is like,

564
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:11,070
there's there that culture.
There's just no wonder to me why.

565
00:30:11,261 --> 00:30:16,261
Like martial arts is such a discipline
because that culture teaches discipline

566
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,940
and hard work within that art better
than anything.

567
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,650
And I think that archery coming out of,
you know,

568
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,240
out of Asia,
I think all the like the Korean team are

569
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:36,160
so strong because of their disciplines
and I'm sure with the martial arts it's

570
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:37,390
exact same thing.

571
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:42,930
They're not afraid to take what the
coach says and just do it until the

572
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:48,511
coach Says No.
And a lot of people here in any sport

573
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,620
are looking for the shortcut.
People at the gym,

574
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,130
they want the show.
Yeah,

575
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:01,350
they want to shake that melts fat.
They want to be able to go in and get

576
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:05,170
the machine that does four minute abs or
whatever.

577
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:10,171
And the reality is you have to have
commitment and you have to have

578
00:31:10,271 --> 00:31:14,860
discipline in anything in life.
Otherwise if you don't,

579
00:31:14,861 --> 00:31:17,980
you're just going to be another person
bitching about while someone else has

580
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:21,580
something you don't because you're not
willing to put the effort in for it.

581
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,610
Yeah.
And then on the other hand,

582
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,720
it's not a good idea to cut your hands
with the.

583
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,720
You take some time off.
Kids

584
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,960
get slow,
slow down.

585
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:32,460
Don't be afraid to raise your hand and
say,

586
00:31:32,461 --> 00:31:34,440
coach,
can we take a break here?

587
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,720
And then I pointed out to a lot of
people that,

588
00:31:36,721 --> 00:31:37,680
um,
you know,

589
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:40,290
there's a lot of people that don't want
to get involved in anything like archery

590
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,300
that I'm interested in it because they
feel like,

591
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:44,160
uh,
they don't want to hunt,

592
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,590
they don't want to be a bow hunter.
I've,

593
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,250
I've heard that before.
I'm not interested in that.

594
00:31:47,251 --> 00:31:50,490
And I'm like,
if even if you don't have to be

595
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,370
interested in that,
like that is the furthest end of the

596
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:55,200
extreme spectrum when it comes to
archery.

597
00:31:55,201 --> 00:31:58,350
You could enjoy archery with just a
yard,

598
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,540
a yard and a target.
I mean,

599
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:02,370
you can,
you don't need to shoot anything other

600
00:32:02,371 --> 00:32:04,320
than a target to,
to get like,

601
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,090
you know,
yesterday and today we're just shooting

602
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,970
targets and very fun,
super fulfilling.

603
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,130
Like at the end of the day,
you know,

604
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,890
especially because yesterday made a lot
of progress.

605
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,510
At the end of the day I was like,
wow,

606
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,890
you know,
this feels great.

607
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,680
Cleansing.

608
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,170
You've made a dramatic improvement.
I mean,

609
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm,
I'm really pumped with how you are,

610
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:28,001
but what I love about archery is
hopefully you can't hear that they can.

611
00:32:28,011 --> 00:32:30,050
This is Dang good by the way.
When,

612
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,810
when?
When Joe does his commercials,

613
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:35,270
which actually it's the only thing on
TV.

614
00:32:35,271 --> 00:32:38,420
I don't fast forward through the
commercials because I love how you do

615
00:32:38,421 --> 00:32:40,520
them,
but when he talks about the butter

616
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:42,650
coffee,
take his advice on it.

617
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:44,990
It's good.
I've enjoyed it.

618
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,720
Yeah.
Get some good coffee,

619
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,170
good grass fed butter and mct oil.
It was lined it all up.

620
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,100
It was.
Yeah,

621
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,520
it was awesome.
I think what's so cool about archery too

622
00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:00,610
is it's not a sport that is limited by
your age and for that matter,

623
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:06,050
it's not totally limited by your
physical physique.

624
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,030
Well,
how about that guy that has no arms?

625
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,260
Oh yeah.
Matt,

626
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:10,910
is that believable and credible?

627
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,470
Yeah.
Matt Stutzman is.

628
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,870
I mean he should be Matt studs.
Minis.

629
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,750
I mean the armless archer,
he's so inspiring.

630
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,110
I mean is kind of.
His nickname is it's inspirational

631
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:26,111
archer and he's definitely just that for
someone to be able to shoot with their

632
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:29,480
legs is amazing.
And Actually Matt,

633
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,710
we haven't talked about this,
but matt and another pair archer here

634
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:37,460
from the u s named Jeff February that
she eats with his mouth.

635
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:41,060
He was in a motorcycle accident and now
he's a pair of archer.

636
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,710
Yeah,
there's Matt Stutzman right there.

637
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,730
So how does Matt.
He holds the ball with his right foot

638
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,870
and then his left foot's on the ground.
And how does he release the bow?

639
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,190
So.
Well,

640
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:54,150
he's,
he's actually um,

641
00:33:54,151 --> 00:33:57,650
design jeff favor is next I think two on
to the right.

642
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:01,730
But so he's developed a release to where
he's actually able to push on it with

643
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:05,240
his chin and he's a,
he actually activates from back tension.

644
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,240
Now they've designed a release for where
he can hook on and he slowly starts to

645
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:15,110
continue to move back until it triggers
the string to fire them as he moves

646
00:34:15,111 --> 00:34:16,880
back.
Who's still looking through his peep

647
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:17,990
site?
Yep.

648
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,060
Yeah,
it's a small movement.

649
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:21,740
You know how small the movement is.
I mean,

650
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:24,320
when I talk about that movement,
it's very finite.

651
00:34:24,321 --> 00:34:27,260
It's a matter of an inch or two that I
think that's jeff right there.

652
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,910
Yeah,
there's Jeff Avery.

653
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,500
So yeah,
when I did,

654
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,500
um,
last year when I had to have my

655
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:35,360
shoulder,
my shoulder redone,

656
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:41,110
I did not want to miss archery season
and just really took it as a personal

657
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:46,211
challenge to not put my head down and I
learned to shoot.

658
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,760
It was actually my bow arm was the one I
had worked on,

659
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:54,761
so I had to learn to shoot with my mouth
using my opposite arm in my,

660
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:59,330
in my non dominant eye,
which was,

661
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,820
I'm thankful for it.

662
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,260
People always,
you know,

663
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,880
people ask me all the time if I regret
this or if I would do that different and

664
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,020
screw that.
I mean,

665
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:11,330
you can't.
The past is the past.

666
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,910
I just want to look forward on
everything.

667
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,950
When I,
when I messed up my shoulder,

668
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:18,080
I was bummed about it,
but in all fairness,

669
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,920
I thought it was a really good challenge
to look at a sport that I love from a

670
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:27,920
new direction,
to look at the technique involved.

671
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,551
Yep.
You know,

672
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:29,384
I think,
um,

673
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,470
someone said it,
I forget who it was that one of the best

674
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:37,650
ways to get good at something is to do
it with your opposite hand

675
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,370
and that not just doing it,
like say if like you,

676
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,650
you're boxing and you're working on
your,

677
00:35:43,651 --> 00:35:44,290
uh,
your,

678
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:48,300
your straight right hand.
A lot of times when you do your straight

679
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:53,160
lefthand and actually improves your
straight right hand because in learning

680
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:57,120
how to do it in an awkward way,
what you're doing is sort of programming

681
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,000
into your mind the critical aspects of
the technique.

682
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,000
How to throw the hips in window to
plant.

683
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,110
And then when you go over to your more
coordinated side,

684
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,310
it's just like super tuned in to the
critical aspects of the movement.

685
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,550
So then when you throw a left hand,
then he switched over to your right

686
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:15,230
side.
You're like,

687
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,063
damn,
it's just,

688
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,730
it's even better.
It's even faster.

689
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:21,750
It's even cleaner and I think that that
probably makes sense to the archery as

690
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:23,430
well.
I've been a lot of people would probably

691
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,350
benefit,
although it's not a traditional thing to

692
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,490
do.
Probably benefit from having both a

693
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,810
lefthanded bow and a right hand and ball
learning how to shoot lefthanded

694
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,630
well,
look at how many skateboarders get

695
00:36:32,631 --> 00:36:34,640
better when they learn to skate goofy,
you know,

696
00:36:34,641 --> 00:36:39,641
if they learn to skate with the opposite
foot back back when I was a skater,

697
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,700
you know,
either skated like straight footer.

698
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:47,660
He skated Goofy,
but then people didn't really switch

699
00:36:47,661 --> 00:36:51,830
back and forth a lot at that time and
less like the freestyle skaters did back

700
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:55,160
then.
But then when I got away from skating

701
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,460
and started playing football for awhile
and then archery and then all of a

702
00:36:58,461 --> 00:37:01,100
sudden you know,
the x games happen and you start seeing

703
00:37:01,101 --> 00:37:05,960
guys like Tony Hawk or whatever.
You realize that the whole skating world

704
00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:10,460
just completely went to like with the
freestyle skaters were and just being

705
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:15,461
able to switch either way and still
perform the exact same tricks.

706
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:19,310
And I think any athlete that's
listening,

707
00:37:19,311 --> 00:37:23,270
and you know what's funny is sometimes
I've seen you say,

708
00:37:23,271 --> 00:37:23,811
you know,
hey,

709
00:37:23,811 --> 00:37:26,240
I'm talking about hunting today,
but some of your listeners might get

710
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:27,140
pissed,
but whatever,

711
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:30,590
because some people just want UFC or
some people don't like to hear the kid.

712
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,770
Never worry about that.
Yeah.

713
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:36,710
But what's super important is that
people need to take some of these

714
00:37:36,711 --> 00:37:41,630
elements and apply them to their life.
And what I really believe is when I get

715
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:45,680
better as an athlete is when I recognize
whatever my biggest weakness is,

716
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,560
and that's what I focus on making my
strength.

717
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,490
I call it selective cycling.
I work on this with a lot of my

718
00:37:52,491 --> 00:37:54,680
students.
I'll literally take the one thing that

719
00:37:54,681 --> 00:37:59,681
they do the worst and that's all I want
them to do for almost a month because a

720
00:38:01,491 --> 00:38:05,150
lot of psychology has shown that if you
have a negative habit,

721
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:10,180
it normally takes about 21 days to
recreate a positive habit,

722
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:15,260
right?
So you have to be able to take your

723
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:20,261
weakness and mentally be tough enough as
an athlete to be willing to make that

724
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:25,340
your strength.
And I've had several things in my career

725
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:29,900
that were my weakness that are now my
strongest aspect.

726
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,260
Field archery was my biggest weakness.
Now,

727
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,950
my biggest strength is the difference
between feel archery.

728
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,720
Well,
it's not on flat ground,

729
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,770
you know,
once you start changing angles and once

730
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:45,070
you start having to make shots and
canyons you have to learn.

731
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:48,760
When do you have to learn trajectory.
So field archery is,

732
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:53,290
you have like a course that you have to
run and it's all outdoors in the woods.

733
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,630
Yup.
It would be outdoors.

734
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:56,710
It would be,
you know,

735
00:38:56,711 --> 00:39:01,150
the really difficult field courses are
like throughout like cliffs and

736
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:03,620
mountainous areas to where,
you know,

737
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:08,060
you have shots where they're straight up
way over your shoulder where you're

738
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,190
aiming non,
you know,

739
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,430
50 degree angles and then you're aiming
down or somewhere.

740
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:15,010
I've even had to aim straight down
between my legs.

741
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,580
Um,
those types of things are extremely

742
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,930
technical.
You know,

743
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:24,220
if you had golfers that had to play in
really difficult terrain,

744
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:28,930
obviously they have to start learning
draws and fades and they have to start

745
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:31,780
learning clubs that play differently in
the wind.

746
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,860
It would,
it would be the same thing it pointed

747
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:37,960
out,
just like when we shoot at longer

748
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,670
distances,
like I mean you were,

749
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,580
you were shooting amazing at eight
period,

750
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:46,320
80 yards on your rubber,
dear you rubber l key call it,

751
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,260
he's laughing the rubber.
It's,

752
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,200
but um,
you are shooting amazing and then you

753
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:55,930
would have one shot where something
wasn't right,

754
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,630
but it would show up.
And that's what field archery did to me.

755
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:01,540
It really started to open up my
weaknesses.

756
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,580
And for me as an athlete,
I'm always so competitive that I want to

757
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:11,200
know what I suck at because I think if
you're really going to master something,

758
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:16,090
regardless of the craft,
you have to be so well rounded.

759
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,970
And I mean the UFC is that way.
Even as a spectator.

760
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:21,430
I'm not a,
I'm not like a fight specialist by any

761
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:22,264
means,
but I,

762
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:27,510
I've always loved watching the UFC and
it's funny how the people who won the

763
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:33,150
early ufc vs how rounded you have to be
now to when you can't afford to have a

764
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:36,880
weakness.

765
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,430
So ignoring it isn't doing you any
favors.

766
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,990
Yeah,
it's a different world now,

767
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,100
completely different world and he also,
much like we were talking about before

768
00:40:45,101 --> 00:40:46,690
in the UFC,
you have to be able to pretty much

769
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:49,810
execute from both sides.
It's very rare that someone only has

770
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:51,990
like a good right kick,
you know,

771
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,770
you have to learn how to kick with the
left side too.

772
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,950
But in Jujitsu that,
that exists as well.

773
00:40:55,951 --> 00:40:57,850
Like there's a lot of guys that have a
strong side,

774
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,130
like the only,
like the past to the left or they don't

775
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:02,920
want it to pass through the ride.
They only submit guys off the right arm.

776
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:06,640
It's like it's real common to have a
side where you're really good at it.

777
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,893
What really,
uh,

778
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,800
one thing you said that the other day
when we were sitting there talking and

779
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:15,810
you were talking about setting up moves
for Jujitsu and how evolving it is,

780
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:21,210
how it continually evolves and all of a
sudden a new move we'll get invented and

781
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:26,230
you'll be practicing that.
And then someone just notices like,

782
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,650
wait,
there's a big weakness right there,

783
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,830
do this.
And we've kind of eliminated someone

784
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:34,040
getting

785
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,720
that moved done on you and then it's
like,

786
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,400
holy crap.
Well,

787
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:42,230
so how do we,
how do we actually combat that?

788
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,840
Right.
It's just a continual chess game.

789
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,980
Yeah.
It really is.

790
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:48,230
And the body can move and so many
different ways.

791
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:50,360
It's one of the more interesting aspects
of Jujitsu's.

792
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,120
There's so many different ways the body
can move.

793
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,210
So when two people are engaged in each
other,

794
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,570
where there's the possibilities of
attacks and counterattacks are near

795
00:41:59,571 --> 00:42:01,280
infinite.
It's a,

796
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,540
it's,
it's a spectacular example of like an

797
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:10,541
extreme discipline and was something
that becomes just for a lot of people,

798
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,100
becomes a massive,
massive obsession.

799
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:16,160
You see the Anthony Bourdain thing that
he wanted to do through tournament.

800
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,350
Anthony Bourdain starts Jujitsu at 58
years old.

801
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:22,820
Okay.
He,

802
00:42:22,821 --> 00:42:23,640
uh,
was,

803
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,690
I think he had quit smoking,
wasn't smoking anymore because he

804
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:28,250
stopped smoking when his daughter was
born,

805
00:42:28,251 --> 00:42:29,084
I think.

806
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,490
But still,
it still was hitting the booze,

807
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,320
you know,
still wasn't eating healthy.

808
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:37,580
He was on statens for his blood pressure
or cholesterol,

809
00:42:37,581 --> 00:42:39,000
I guess he just,
you know,

810
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,850
just wasn't healthy.
Yeah.

811
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:45,050
Gets into Jujitsu because of his wife.
His wife is a maniac.

812
00:42:45,051 --> 00:42:46,820
She loves Jujitsu,
gets into it,

813
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:48,830
and now he's obsessed.
Trains every day,

814
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,070
often twice a day.
And he just wanted you to,

815
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:53,500
to tournament as a blue belt at.
What is it?

816
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:56,120
Fifty nine or something like that.
Fucking incredible.

817
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,750
Fifty nine year old Anthony Bourdain
took home the goal that is first Jujitsu

818
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:00,380
tournament.
I mean,

819
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,880
get the fuck Outta here.
That's awesome.

820
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:06,740
As someone who loves Jujitsu,
I'm just blown away.

821
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:11,060
I'm blown away.
I just love seeing a guy like him who is

822
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:13,100
a madman man.
So many different things.

823
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:18,610
And also a guy who was an artist and he,
his art being culinary,

824
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,373
being a chef.

825
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,580
I learned from watching his show that
that's an art form.

826
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:28,400
I didn't really consider it before I
watched.

827
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:30,470
Um,
no reservations is old show.

828
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:34,100
I watched him interact with all these
cooks and the like,

829
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:35,300
a light bulb went off.
I'm like,

830
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:36,860
oh,
cooking is art.

831
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,460
I never thought of it that way.
I thought it was like,

832
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,960
oh,
that guy now has a cook.

833
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,230
This guy makes some good this and that
guy cooked some good that,

834
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,750
but I didn't think of it in the same
way.

835
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:50,180
I look at like a maybe a guy who was an
amazing sculptor.

836
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,580
I didn't think about it that way and
then I realized that when I watched a

837
00:43:53,581 --> 00:43:54,670
show it was like,
yeah,

838
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,550
really?
I never did.

839
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,600
I was just thought,
oh,

840
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:58,010
this guy's a good kick,
you know,

841
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:01,460
this guy knows how to make sausages or
this guy's really good at Lasagna or

842
00:44:01,461 --> 00:44:02,000
something,
you know,

843
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,350
it didn't,
didn't,

844
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,510
didn't seem like an art.

845
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,770
So seeing him,
a guy who highlighted that there is an

846
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:14,330
art and cooking food.
Then become obsessed with this art of

847
00:44:14,331 --> 00:44:17,510
Jujitsu,
which I think in a lot of ways,

848
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:20,090
like we were saying about archery
archery,

849
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:21,830
there's parallels.
I mean,

850
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:24,770
people think of Kendo,
which is a Japanese sword fighting art

851
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,640
that's unquestionably a martial art,
but then so is our strike archery and we

852
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:29,780
have.
Kendall is a martial art,

853
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:34,470
so his archery 100 percent because
archery involves a weapon involved,

854
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,560
but it's so much more than that man.
So much more than that.

855
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:42,561
At some weird,
crazy moving meditation that I feel like

856
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,280
when it goes well,
like yesterday when we shot really well

857
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:50,340
and we shot like tight groups at 80
yards.

858
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,030
Well after it's over.
Like physically,

859
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,000
you feel better.
You feel like charged up,

860
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,270
you feel elevated,
you feel better than if you did nothing.

861
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,050
Like there's like if you could take a
drug that makes you feel the way you

862
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:08,250
feel when you hit a perfect acts at 80
yards like that,

863
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,410
like you'd take that drug all day.
Oh yeah.

864
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,320
That was a cigarette.
Yeah,

865
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:19,850
and high on both side.
I've been pounded,

866
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,680
pounded that crap all lit up right now.
My Skin's Tingley.

867
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,050
Yeah.
It's very strange.

868
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,140
I guess discipline,
a martial art discipline,

869
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,790
but I think almost labeling these things
in any other way than just calling them

870
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:35,900
what they mean.
That is just.

871
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,910
It is archery.
You know when you put them in

872
00:45:37,911 --> 00:45:40,220
categories,
when you categorize things as this is a

873
00:45:40,221 --> 00:45:45,221
sport or this is a hobby or this is a.
It almost trivializes the benefits,

874
00:45:45,531 --> 00:45:48,680
the positive benefits of it.
It's funny that you say that because now

875
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:53,681
I know I could never pull you away
because I love as an athlete to step

876
00:45:56,121 --> 00:46:01,121
away with perfection and you would shoot
a group that was like perfect and I knew

877
00:46:04,101 --> 00:46:06,950
that we were close to being done for the
day and I'd be like,

878
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,480
all right,
let's end on that.

879
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,130
And you're like,
no way dude,

880
00:46:10,131 --> 00:46:12,140
I'm doing another one.
But then.

881
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,500
But then if you make one negative shot
in that group,

882
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:18,740
you were pissed again.
Which I can understand too because I'm

883
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,570
so competitive that way.
But I also love that feeling that you're

884
00:46:23,571 --> 00:46:28,040
talking about.
It's awesome sometimes to have that and

885
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:32,690
it's important and that's what I was
trying to like work with you on is it

886
00:46:32,691 --> 00:46:34,940
doesn't get better than what you just
did.

887
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:37,060
You're on a high.
Let's,

888
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:42,220
I want you to like step away thinking
about your trip all night.

889
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:44,790
So tomorrow,
you know,

890
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:49,220
you visualize it long enough.
I'm the way I think is tomorrow you're

891
00:46:49,221 --> 00:46:54,221
more likely to be able to duplicate.
I don't like to go.

892
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,440
I don't ever like to go to bed on a
negative.

893
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,730
Right.
So that's actually what I was trying to

894
00:47:01,731 --> 00:47:03,710
do,
but you know,

895
00:47:03,711 --> 00:47:05,600
we're not good enough friends where I
can be like,

896
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,220
listen,
give me your.

897
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:07,911
Well,
I don't know.

898
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:12,440
I guess I did take some stuff away from
probably some of the releases that I was

899
00:47:12,441 --> 00:47:15,840
using.
He won't let me use in house.

900
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,690
Well,
this is very geeky stuff.

901
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,010
So for people that are listening to
this,

902
00:47:19,011 --> 00:47:22,940
they didn't understand,
but because there's so many different

903
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:26,030
aspects of archery,
there's where you're standing,

904
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,130
what your posture is,
how you're,

905
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,340
how you're focusing,
what you're looking

906
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,540
at,
what are your concentrating on.

907
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:33,780
Because of that,
there is.

908
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:39,050
There's a tendency to anticipate the
shot and it becomes sort of overwhelming

909
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:41,050
because you're managing all these
different things.

910
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:46,350
So what a lot of people try to
concentrate now in the world of archery

911
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:48,730
is getting what you call it,
a surprise shot.

912
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,830
Meaning that this is just for the people
at home,

913
00:47:50,831 --> 00:47:55,150
obviously not for you,
meaning that when you pull back,

914
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,140
the thing that you concentrating on is
just focusing on the target.

915
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:04,530
All of your technique as far as keeping
the bulb balanced and level and keeping

916
00:48:04,661 --> 00:48:08,230
it onto all that stuff is something
you've already worked on.

917
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:11,890
All you're working on now is pulling
through the shot so you don't think

918
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:16,330
about executing the shot like ready go,
and when you think of that ready go that

919
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:20,140
pressing that button,
you have a tendency or possibility of

920
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,360
punching it,
of hitting it wrong,

921
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:25,480
of tweaking and twisting,
and we talked about that today because

922
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:28,120
it's in a lot of ways,
it's like a fight.

923
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:31,090
You know that when a fighter trains for
a fight,

924
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:36,420
you're training for something that is
going to be a moment that's like months

925
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:40,330
away from now.
So all of this work and effort then

926
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:42,970
comes to fruition in this one moment.
Fighter number one,

927
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:44,410
are you ready?
Fire number two.

928
00:48:44,411 --> 00:48:45,160
Oh,
you're ready.

929
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,600
Fight.
Holy Shit.

930
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:47,590
Here it is.
It's happening,

931
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:51,040
but at least in a fight you're,
you know,

932
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:54,580
you've got a few rounds.
You can kind of settle in after the

933
00:48:54,581 --> 00:48:57,130
first minute or so.
You can relax and get into the groove of

934
00:48:57,131 --> 00:49:02,131
everything in archery.
Oftentimes that all that training and

935
00:49:02,141 --> 00:49:04,120
preparation,
whether it's for a tournament or even

936
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:05,620
more critically,
if you're hunting,

937
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:10,900
it comes down to that one moment in that
moment sometimes can be completely

938
00:49:10,901 --> 00:49:15,901
overwhelming because that moment,
although your practice has been constant

939
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:20,050
and diligent,
that moment is entirely alien.

940
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,020
This moment didn't exist during any of
the practice.

941
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:25,750
There was never the elevated heart rate.
There's never the freakout.

942
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,480
There's never the massive consequences
if you make an error,

943
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,720
everything has to be in place,
and those,

944
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:36,310
those things are what make a discipline
so rewarding.

945
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:41,410
When you actually pull it off.
All of those things like knowing that

946
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:45,460
there's so many different factors
involved and then this alien moment,

947
00:49:45,461 --> 00:49:48,310
so those factors involve all the
discipline factors.

948
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:52,840
You have to drill them into a point
where they become a part of you.

949
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,540
They become like ingrained in your
genetics.

950
00:49:55,770 --> 00:50:00,770
They become a part of your DNA so that
in that one insane heart pounding

951
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:04,900
moment,
you can execute it flawlessly and the

952
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:07,210
best way to do it,
which I'm learning from you,

953
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,060
is by figuring out how to do it with a
surprise shot.

954
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:14,260
So that way you take out that the
anticipation aspect of it.

955
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:17,050
Yeah,
it's less you think about it,

956
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,450
the more likely it is for things to
happen,

957
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:24,830
you know you have to be so focused on
the process that the prize happens

958
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:27,860
without your expectation.

959
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:33,460
The really interesting part about what
I've learned as a competitive archer is

960
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:40,270
it's the fastest buzz kill of any sport
I've ever had,

961
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:45,730
and what I mean by that is there's times
where you're standing on the line,

962
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,860
you realize,
okay,

963
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,140
archer number one,
one Arrow,

964
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:51,921
archer,
number two,

965
00:50:51,921 --> 00:50:55,070
one Arrow closest to center decides the
gold medal match.

966
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:59,420
You literally let go and you're,
you know,

967
00:50:59,421 --> 00:51:02,480
you're sitting there,
you know shit and pickles.

968
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,120
Your heart rate's beaten out,
your neck.

969
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,940
You know you're trying not to.
I actually had this,

970
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:13,060
I've had this feeling go both ways,
but you let that Arrow go and you,

971
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:18,251
you have so much adrenaline that you can
barely manage it and then you're,

972
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:24,230
you shoot and you see the shadow of that
Arrow hit out like out of the gold to

973
00:51:25,281 --> 00:51:30,170
where you know you lost and it's
instantly gone.

974
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,680
You have,
you're not nervous,

975
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,140
you're sweating or shaking.

976
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:41,030
You just knew you blew it and it's like
wiped so fast.

977
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:45,800
It's really,
really strange that the release of one

978
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:50,801
product of an art form can just,
you instantly know that you screwed up

979
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:57,500
and you know,
and I've been that way as a hunter too,

980
00:51:57,501 --> 00:52:02,330
where you get nervous and all of a
sudden that shot happens and then you

981
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:04,100
almost can't.
You know,

982
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:07,670
for some people they make the shot and
then they get like that.

983
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:13,360
But sometimes you make that shot and
it's amazing how fast it's just gone and

984
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:19,450
it's such a rewarding thing when you can
take that ball of just emotion and just

985
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:27,680
say,
I got this and you fricking clamped down

986
00:52:27,681 --> 00:52:32,681
on it and then you see that Arrow going
to the gold and it's just like,

987
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,280
it's such a reward.
Like for me,

988
00:52:37,281 --> 00:52:40,280
that's what I think for you and your
mentality,

989
00:52:40,281 --> 00:52:44,060
me and mine,
you get so much reward for that.

990
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,120
That for me,
I never really worried about it.

991
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,780
I never worried about a trophy or metal
or for that matter than checks never

992
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:53,510
really mattered either when I was
younger I needed them.

993
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,410
But you know,
I've just came to the realization that,

994
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:00,500
you know,
every trophy I have at home is

995
00:53:00,501 --> 00:53:01,520
tarnished.
You know,

996
00:53:01,521 --> 00:53:03,110
they need cleaning,
you know,

997
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:08,111
they just wilt away.
But what imprints I have in my mind of

998
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:13,121
moments like that's what pulls me
through as a person and it's positive or

999
00:53:15,321 --> 00:53:17,690
that I can reflect on,
you know,

1000
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,900
I know that what's satisfying to me and
I feel so content with life is these

1001
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:27,930
small little goals and accomplishments
that I've had where I've controlled

1002
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,870
myself,
not the situation.

1003
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:34,890
I was in a gold medal match in Poland
and

1004
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,410
they had the,
the gold medal match in this square,

1005
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,460
like in the square of the main town.

1006
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:45,710
You're shooting from the,
from the beach into the main square of

1007
00:53:45,711 --> 00:53:49,080
the town.
And our match was first and I was the

1008
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:50,760
first archer.
So I stepped up.

1009
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:54,510
We were in a team round and there was so
many people.

1010
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:57,720
I raised my bow,
I pulled back,

1011
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:02,700
I was going into my shot.
And as I'm looking through my scope at

1012
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:07,500
the target,
about four people's heads come,

1013
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:12,501
like looking in like this because there
are people lined all the way down and

1014
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:18,360
this is 70 meters.
So everyone's evidently was shuffling to

1015
00:54:18,361 --> 00:54:22,290
try to get to see the archer.
Not Realizing in like,

1016
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:24,510
okay,
there's an arrow going over your head.

1017
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,650
So I'm going from like mentally having a
sight picture that I'm not nervous about

1018
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:32,430
to all of a sudden thinking if I shoot
someone in the face,

1019
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,380
I don't want to spend the rest of my
life.

1020
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:34,980
And uh,
Poland,

1021
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:39,630
Polish prison and I remember like
someone like keep cleaning the line,

1022
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:40,830
getting the people to back.
No,

1023
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:43,320
it was just like they did.
I don't think they really thought that

1024
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:46,610
people were going to come in.
And I remember I drew back and I was so,

1025
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,870
I mean you've seen me shoot in my
element.

1026
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,860
It's very smooth.
So then all of a sudden there was like,

1027
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,080
my front arm was like,
you know,

1028
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:57,180
I got into that tremor mode.
Like,

1029
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,940
you know what you have when you,
when the anxiety sets in.

1030
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,970
And I remember I shot and they're like,
you know,

1031
00:55:02,971 --> 00:55:07,680
they called 10 and I came off the line
and my other teammate that was with me,

1032
00:55:07,681 --> 00:55:09,540
he goes,
what the hell,

1033
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:11,820
dude?
Why are you shaking so bad?

1034
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,810
If he's like,
what the hell,

1035
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:14,460
dude,
you almost miss what's up with you,

1036
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,040
like as we're passing one another and I
go,

1037
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:21,480
you'll see a fricken pulls back and he
goes,

1038
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,130
what the f?

1039
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,950
So that next round my gift,
freaking people out of the way,

1040
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:33,360
like I had people's faces in my scope.
That's a youtube video waiting to

1041
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:35,880
happen.
Somebody catching one of the temple

1042
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:38,720
leaning into the path.
That's just so ridiculous.

1043
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:40,750
Don't want one to 10 if anybody doesn't
it,

1044
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,140
if you don't know,
like when you're looking through a site

1045
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,070
of a,
um,

1046
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,050
uh,
on archer and oboe,

1047
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:49,740
archery sites have very small.
So you're looking at a very narrow

1048
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:52,080
window.
So for these people to actually be in

1049
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:54,750
your site,
they had to be extremely close to the

1050
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,210
path of the era.
It's a one.

1051
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,500
Well,
the Arrow was arguing over there melon,

1052
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:03,530
but
because they were between me and the

1053
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:05,430
target.
So crazy though.

1054
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,860
It was very crazy.
Um,

1055
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,540
yeah.
I was like,

1056
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,680
what is this?
Did what I did at the pool today?

1057
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,750
Throwing
safety of that.

1058
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,510
Yeah,
it's easy when you're concentrating all

1059
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:19,440
the other things you.
It weirds me out.

1060
00:56:19,441 --> 00:56:21,930
I've been at.
I've been at places where I'm practicing

1061
00:56:21,931 --> 00:56:25,870
and you're like shooting and someone
else's at this club and you like go down

1062
00:56:25,871 --> 00:56:28,300
to pull your Arrow and then all of a
sudden you're like sitting there like

1063
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,390
pulling the arrows and it's like.
And you're like,

1064
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,290
Yo,
what's up?

1065
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:33,360
Oh God.
Oh,

1066
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,380
I'm just saying.
I mean even at that other targets like,

1067
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:36,580
okay,
well yeah,

1068
00:56:36,581 --> 00:56:38,850
you know,
how many Joe Rogan pool shots I've seen

1069
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:43,210
I might
want to be on the receiving end of that

1070
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:44,980
certainly can happen.
You know,

1071
00:56:44,981 --> 00:56:47,320
what you've got set up is,
is really cool.

1072
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:52,321
That giant long range at your house.
So you could practice like in your yard

1073
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:54,400
like that.
Like there's a video that you put up.

1074
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:58,110
John set up my bow.
I got this bowl from hoyt.

1075
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:01,870
John set it up perfect.
And he took these crazy shots and one of

1076
00:57:01,871 --> 00:57:05,590
them we took was 122 yards.
And um,

1077
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,780
to,
to be able to do that and to have like

1078
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:10,750
this big open space like that.
In your yard,

1079
00:57:10,751 --> 00:57:12,900
it's got to be fucking awesome.
It's weak.

1080
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:13,731
Cool.
Yeah.

1081
00:57:13,731 --> 00:57:14,750
Actually,
um,

1082
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:18,830
when we bought my house,
my wife Sharon,

1083
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:22,760
she knew that we wanted to move out to a
farm because we're.

1084
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,830
When I.
Before I moved to Iowa

1085
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,020
so that could get more deer tags.
You laugh about that.

1086
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:32,130
That's hilarious.
Fuck moves to a state so they can get

1087
00:57:32,131 --> 00:57:34,660
more deer tags.
You can get an extra dear.

1088
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,200
Doesn't
guarantee you right now.

1089
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,790
Campaigns could get to elk tags.
If he crossed the state line,

1090
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,290
I'll guarantee it.
He would do it.

1091
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,510
He loves Oregon.
He travels a lot.

1092
00:57:45,511 --> 00:57:48,450
Anyway.
He might see I get three buck tags.

1093
00:57:48,451 --> 00:57:51,450
Actually three different situation
though,

1094
00:57:51,451 --> 00:57:54,420
like a white tail hunting and I was just
so different.

1095
00:57:54,421 --> 00:57:59,160
And plus it's,
is for folks who aren't aware if it's

1096
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,530
like a tradition,
it's a,

1097
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,930
it's an American thing,
like a white tail.

1098
00:58:03,931 --> 00:58:08,931
Hunting is probably the biggest hunting
pastime in America.

1099
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,140
More people hunt white tails.
More people spend more time hunting,

1100
00:58:13,141 --> 00:58:17,490
white tails than anything.
And it's also like probably some of the

1101
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:20,100
best meat you're ever going to eat in
your life.

1102
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,870
Oh yeah.
I've been crushing mind.

1103
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,160
I'm making.
Yeah,

1104
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:28,260
I love.
That's why I was so surprised when you

1105
00:58:28,261 --> 00:58:30,690
said you don't,
you didn't see like cooking as an art.

1106
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,840
I actually went,
when I go someplace nice,

1107
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:35,783
I'm,

1108
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:39,180
I take pictures of my food because to me
I see it that way.

1109
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:44,070
And actually I cook some backstraps the
other night and you know,

1110
00:58:44,071 --> 00:58:46,280
I cook some backstrap so like,
you know,

1111
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:50,670
Cook some vegetables and like a coconut
oil or something and then,

1112
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,550
you know,
I like slice through that tenderloin and

1113
00:58:53,551 --> 00:58:58,140
like kind of folded them all down and
then like stacked my little half strap

1114
00:58:58,141 --> 00:59:01,590
up and Kinda lean them against there.
And I was just like looking at it like

1115
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:06,510
why would people not want to do this?
Like why would people not want to be

1116
00:59:06,511 --> 00:59:10,650
able to do this for themselves to make a
nice meal and make a nice meal.

1117
00:59:10,651 --> 00:59:12,210
And obviously it's something that

1118
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:15,820
is a reward of hard work,
work

1119
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,890
and dedication that I've put in through
the year.

1120
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:19,120
You know,
my saying,

1121
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:24,121
one saying that I made on my TV during
the first few seasons is I'm,

1122
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:29,330
I'm in target archery to become a better
hunter and I'm a better hunter because

1123
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:34,160
I'm a target archer.
I got into professional archery 100

1124
00:59:34,161 --> 00:59:39,161
percent because I wanted to be more
proficient and ethical knowing that I

1125
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:46,480
was a bow hunter and I kind of had the.
I was actually the same type of feeling.

1126
00:59:46,761 --> 00:59:50,240
I was,
I was only 10 but it or I mean when I

1127
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,910
started competing I started hunting when
I was 10,

1128
00:59:52,911 --> 00:59:56,600
so there was like six or seven years
there where I wasn't competing.

1129
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:02,410
But I remember having one hunt where I
felt so much anxiety and I like blue is

1130
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:07,580
shot and I just completely missed and I
couldn't explain why.

1131
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,220
And it was at that moment that I'm like,
you know what,

1132
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:14,600
if I'm going to do this,
I need to be able to be ethical at it.

1133
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:20,440
So at that point I was kind of looking
for a way to become better.

1134
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:24,950
And I was actually,
it was right before I was supposed to

1135
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:27,650
leave for my first football camps or
college,

1136
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:32,300
I was driving down a road and there was
a sign on the road that said,

1137
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,690
um,
three d archery shoots and it was just

1138
01:00:35,691 --> 01:00:40,691
an Arrow pointing down and I pulled in,
I had like my hunting bow in the back of

1139
01:00:40,701 --> 01:00:41,660
my truck,
you know,

1140
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:46,370
kind of drive in and I see all these
people like shooting on this practice

1141
01:00:46,371 --> 01:00:48,710
range.
And then I see like groups of four going

1142
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:53,711
into this course to like shoot and it
was all foam animal targets with scoring

1143
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:57,830
rings on them.
And you step up to the line,

1144
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:00,560
you look at the target,
you try to figure out how far it is

1145
01:01:00,561 --> 01:01:02,810
without having a range finder.

1146
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,530
And then you make a shot.
And depending on,

1147
01:01:06,531 --> 01:01:09,260
you know,
all the scoring is within the ethical

1148
01:01:09,261 --> 01:01:14,261
kill zone of the animal.
So after I think,

1149
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:20,000
I think it was 15 targets,
it was a 40 target course after 15

1150
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:22,580
targets.
I didn't have a single Arrow left in my

1151
01:01:22,581 --> 01:01:25,910
quiver.
I had lost all of them and it was like a

1152
01:01:25,911 --> 01:01:30,260
wake up call.
It was the first time that I had ever

1153
01:01:30,261 --> 01:01:35,240
felt defeated at something.
It was the first time that I had a very

1154
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:40,720
clear wakeup call of maybe you're not
good enough to be doing this,

1155
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:44,870
you know,
and for me that was a trigger as a

1156
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:49,250
competitor.
I think the standout athletes in any

1157
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:54,251
sport are the ones that take those
moments very personal and change the

1158
01:01:55,421 --> 01:02:00,421
direction to make it their best or
either realized I'm either going to be

1159
01:02:02,031 --> 01:02:05,180
good at this or I need to find something
else to be good at,

1160
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:07,490
you know,
to focus all your energy to.

1161
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:12,890
And one thing led to another.
I went to an archery shop were I saw a

1162
01:02:12,891 --> 01:02:16,340
lot of guys with shirts on that said
like the name of a shop.

1163
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:20,970
So I knew they were like kind of local
shooters representing this store.

1164
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:25,230
So the next day I was in that store and
I said,

1165
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:26,880
hey,
I want to get better.

1166
01:02:26,881 --> 01:02:29,460
I know a lot of guys here,
we're shooting and a lot of those guys

1167
01:02:29,461 --> 01:02:32,790
were in the range and I just started
asking questions.

1168
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:37,380
A lot of people didn't want to help,
which is why I really want to help the

1169
01:02:37,381 --> 01:02:39,990
archery world.
It's my way of giving back because there

1170
01:02:39,991 --> 01:02:44,991
were people that didn't want to help me,
but then I remember the guy came in and

1171
01:02:45,601 --> 01:02:47,550
said,
are my arrows done?

1172
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:50,670
And the guy behind the counter said,
let me check in the back,

1173
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:52,380
and he kind of walked past me and he
goes,

1174
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:53,214
come here kid.

1175
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,710
And uh,
because I had hung out in that store for

1176
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:57,870
about four days,
just kind of watching and looking

1177
01:02:57,871 --> 01:03:00,690
around.
I didn't really have any importance.

1178
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,320
So he takes me in the back room and he
says,

1179
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:09,420
you got to build these guys arrows for
me because I forgot to do them.

1180
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,460
And I said,
I don't know how to build arrows.

1181
01:03:11,461 --> 01:03:12,290
And he goes,
okay,

1182
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:14,550
you take this feather,
you put it in this clamp,

1183
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:17,130
put glue right down this feather,
like this.

1184
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:20,160
Put the Arrow in this Jig.
You push down on it.

1185
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:22,770
Then you turn the wheel,
go to the next Arrow after you get to

1186
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:24,720
the end,
take the clamp off,

1187
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:25,930
put another feather in,
you know,

1188
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:29,190
and he literally gave me the thing.
So I was in there like trying to figure

1189
01:03:29,191 --> 01:03:31,410
out how to do this.
Even work there.

1190
01:03:31,411 --> 01:03:33,020
No,
I was there like,

1191
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,700
like literally stalking people in the
range.

1192
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,910
I was like the weird guy in the corner
with like the hunting bow that was

1193
01:03:38,911 --> 01:03:43,380
probably my dad's hand me down.
I'm like stocking all the shooters and

1194
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:46,120
about an hour later I came out with,
you know,

1195
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:50,420
this guy's arrows that he probably paid
100 bucks for and some like snot nosed

1196
01:03:50,421 --> 01:03:53,100
kid that had never even built them,
built them for the guy.

1197
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:55,650
And so he goes,
all right,

1198
01:03:55,651 --> 01:03:56,880
good job.
And he goes here,

1199
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:01,910
now go do these.
And two weeks later I remember telling

1200
01:04:01,981 --> 01:04:02,880
my dad,
Hey,

1201
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:04,950
I think I'm gonna.
Um,

1202
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,410
I'm not going to do that.
The football thing.

1203
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,120
And he's like,
what do you mean?

1204
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:13,170
I said,
I got offered a job at this archery

1205
01:04:13,171 --> 01:04:14,220
shop.
I'm going to do it.

1206
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,770
And my dad's like,
so you're not going to play college

1207
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:19,590
football and get a get a,
um,

1208
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,840
an education,
you're going to work at an archery shop.

1209
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:23,630
And he goes,
what's this archery shop pay?

1210
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,350
And I said,
for 10 an hour.

1211
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:31,620
Yeah,
that was my dad's been so good.

1212
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:34,530
My both my parents have been so
supportive on everything in life.

1213
01:04:34,531 --> 01:04:37,530
But that was the one time where he
looked me in the face and just said,

1214
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:43,160
this is a really stupid decision.
But Hey,

1215
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:44,310
I mean,
you know,

1216
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:48,660
it's,
I just think it's a great story because

1217
01:04:48,661 --> 01:04:52,530
it shows that if someone's willing to
commit to a dream,

1218
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:58,610
then as long as you're able to put in
the work and stay focused on it,

1219
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:03,000
there's so many people that make
businesses out of dreams are,

1220
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,370
you know,
careers out of sports that you would

1221
01:05:05,371 --> 01:05:09,030
never even consider.
We'll just think of that story.

1222
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:12,960
Now you're traveling all over the world
coaching international teams and

1223
01:05:12,961 --> 01:05:14,280
archery.
I mean,

1224
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,040
it's a crazy story.
It really stop.

1225
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:19,000
Think about it.
It's really weird.

1226
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,620
You know,
I have some very.

1227
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:25,870
I have some friends that are very
successful according to the business

1228
01:05:25,871 --> 01:05:30,871
world and there's times where I'm with
those people and then they're

1229
01:05:31,991 --> 01:05:36,130
introducing me to like a senator or
governor,

1230
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,130
and then they're like,
well,

1231
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:40,210
John,
you know,

1232
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:40,811
it's like,
Hey,

1233
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:45,430
this is my personal friend John and I'm
with the president of the university or

1234
01:05:45,431 --> 01:05:46,264
something.

1235
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,520
And they're like,
so John,

1236
01:05:48,521 --> 01:05:50,950
what do you do?
And it's one of these,

1237
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,240
you want to be able to say,
Oh,

1238
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:54,400
I have an mba or you know,
yeah,

1239
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:55,150
do,
um,

1240
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:58,270
rocket science stuff,
but it's like a,

1241
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,540
I'm an archer.
Yeah.

1242
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:01,870
I shoot a bow for living and they're
just like,

1243
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:04,300
really?
I'm a slingshot master.

1244
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,650
Yeah,
exactly.

1245
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:10,390
But then you start,
you start explaining what you're

1246
01:06:10,391 --> 01:06:12,610
actually doing and you realize this is
a,

1247
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:17,710
it's a really big world and it's,
there's such great people there,

1248
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:18,603
you know,
I have,

1249
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:21,850
I literally.
It's really nice to be able to say I

1250
01:06:21,851 --> 01:06:26,851
don't have any regrets in life because
I'm in an industry that I love.

1251
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:32,200
I'm doing something that I really,
really love and they're such good people

1252
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:37,201
around it.
And all you have to do is get up every

1253
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:42,360
morning when the alarm goes off.
Mine goes off pretty early and then just

1254
01:06:42,551 --> 01:06:44,380
put in the work and,
you know,

1255
01:06:44,381 --> 01:06:49,290
I just think it's so cool to know that
there's opportunity like that and

1256
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,060
there's a different path,
a path that maybe perhaps other people

1257
01:06:52,061 --> 01:06:52,750
hadn't considered.

1258
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:53,710
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1259
01:06:53,711 --> 01:06:54,790
And just,
you know,

1260
01:06:55,420 --> 01:07:00,420
it's such a great country to live in to
here in the states because you can take

1261
01:07:00,701 --> 01:07:03,880
something that no one really might not
believe in yourself.

1262
01:07:03,881 --> 01:07:06,970
And if you apply the work to it,
you can make it happen.

1263
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:11,770
And in traveling through all the
different parts of the world that I've

1264
01:07:11,771 --> 01:07:14,680
traveled,
I've gone to places where you just,

1265
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,920
you know,
you really wish you could give some of

1266
01:07:17,921 --> 01:07:22,630
those people a chance because you can
tell that they have such heart and such

1267
01:07:22,631 --> 01:07:25,150
desire,
but they don't have opportunity.

1268
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,370
And that's sad to me.
That's,

1269
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:31,210
that's really sad that there's not
opportunity everywhere.

1270
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:36,420
And then you come here and you see
someone that has potential or

1271
01:07:37,271 --> 01:07:40,990
opportunity,
but they're lazy and they won't put in

1272
01:07:40,991 --> 01:07:43,780
the work.
They don't have the desperation,

1273
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,300
they don't have the desire,
they don't have the drive,

1274
01:07:46,301 --> 01:07:46,660
they don't.

1275
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:47,580
They don't.
You know?

1276
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:50,800
I think a lot of times for some people
when they're young,

1277
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:55,600
it's not enforced early on that when you
work hard at something,

1278
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:58,240
it's really rewarding.
When it's over and it's difficult to

1279
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,610
work hard at something,
it's difficult to get your ass out of

1280
01:08:00,611 --> 01:08:02,650
bed.
It's difficult to force yourself to get

1281
01:08:02,651 --> 01:08:04,200
up off the couch.
It's difficult,

1282
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,970
but once you do it,
it's always good.

1283
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,810
It always feels good and even if you do
something and it doesn't work out well,

1284
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,690
like even if you are practicing archery
in the shots,

1285
01:08:13,691 --> 01:08:14,880
don't go well.
It's silly.

1286
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,100
You're involved

1287
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,190
in the discipline has given you
something to concentrate on and that'll

1288
01:08:19,191 --> 01:08:22,520
translate that energy and momentum will
translate to the rest of your life.

1289
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:24,770
If you're working to improve at
something,

1290
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:29,360
whether it's archery or Jujitsu or
anything when you working to improve,

1291
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:33,290
improve on it.
I firmly believe that that motivation

1292
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:37,850
and that momentum of improvement applies
to the rest of your life and it's one of

1293
01:08:37,851 --> 01:08:42,030
the things that people love about any
particular discipline is the,

1294
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:46,700
the aspects of it and the qualities of
it that sort of transfer onto your

1295
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:47,534
everyday life.

1296
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:51,620
You know,
it's weird because until you and I

1297
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:57,110
communicated some on the phone when I
worked for an archery company and I was

1298
01:08:57,111 --> 01:09:00,350
just a sales guy making calls.
I never got to see faces.

1299
01:09:00,351 --> 01:09:03,980
All ever heard was voices.
So voices for me are always triggers

1300
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:09,010
because for 10 years I was just making
calls when you and I first talked on the

1301
01:09:09,801 --> 01:09:14,300
phone and I like heard your voice
directly.

1302
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:19,280
Like from my device I actually realized
I haven't even told you this,

1303
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:24,281
but I when I work out or when I shoot
and a lot of times when I'm just working

1304
01:09:26,271 --> 01:09:31,271
in my building,
I've comprised like about five hours of

1305
01:09:32,841 --> 01:09:37,490
a MP3.
That's nothing but motivational sayings

1306
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,960
that I've heard someone say whether it's
and I,

1307
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:47,020
that's all I play.
It's my ambient sound and you are on

1308
01:09:47,181 --> 01:09:52,181
there twice about just almost like what
you just talked about,

1309
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:55,010
just a positive.

1310
01:09:55,610 --> 01:10:00,610
It was just a positive rant that you had
about all people have to do is make a

1311
01:10:01,251 --> 01:10:05,030
step in a direction and you might,
you might look in the mirror one time

1312
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,920
and you don't like what's there,
but you know,

1313
01:10:06,921 --> 01:10:11,360
you have the opportunity to turn around
and go a different way.

1314
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:16,420
And one thing that I really try to drive
to people because there's times you talk

1315
01:10:16,801 --> 01:10:20,180
to someone and you know that they're
down in the dumps.

1316
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,030
You know,
any one thing I tell people is,

1317
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,870
you know,
motivation gets you going.

1318
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:31,070
Commitment keeps you going.
You know,

1319
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:33,890
it's,
it's no different than the new year's

1320
01:10:33,891 --> 01:10:35,600
resolution.
I fricking hate that.

1321
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:40,750
I hate if there's any time a,
I don't want to go to the gym.

1322
01:10:41,061 --> 01:10:46,061
It's two weeks after New Year's because
it's like this swarm of people and all

1323
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:50,090
to me,
there's people in there were like,

1324
01:10:50,091 --> 01:10:51,200
you know what?
Good for them.

1325
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:52,963
You know,
they're,

1326
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:56,030
they're not in shape.
Good for them to come here.

1327
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:01,750
But then it's so disappointing when it's
like two days and they're gone.

1328
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,233
Yup.
Yup.

1329
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,070
And you know,
if you're,

1330
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:10,220
if you're at that stage and you're at
the point where you're like,

1331
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,620
you know what,
I want to change myself physically.

1332
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:13,980
It's funny how many

1333
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,980
people won't even.
It's funny how many people are going to

1334
01:11:18,991 --> 01:11:23,730
the gym to work out,
but they'll circle the gym parking lot

1335
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:29,150
like 10 times because they want the
first row to open up.

1336
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:35,360
Your work is far away from the front
door as you can and warm up by walking.

1337
01:11:35,451 --> 01:11:37,830
You skip,
skip to the loo.

1338
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,850
Well,
I think a lot of people need a life

1339
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:44,760
coach.
I think this is what I'm the conclusion.

1340
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:47,820
One of the things that I'm coming to in
life is that,

1341
01:11:47,821 --> 01:11:52,440
um,
people need to either find a way to

1342
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:56,070
motivate themselves through all the
different stuff that's available online.

1343
01:11:56,071 --> 01:11:57,660
I mean,
there's a million different websites and

1344
01:11:57,661 --> 01:12:01,310
instagram pages and lots of youtube
videos that show some motivation and

1345
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,320
they can help you.
But we,

1346
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:09,440
human beings learn from each other.
And I think most of the cultures in the

1347
01:12:09,691 --> 01:12:13,080
past,
not trying to glorify the past and say

1348
01:12:13,081 --> 01:12:15,840
they had it nailed and we don't,
but most of them were entitled knit

1349
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:20,730
groups and the emulated the behavior and
the patterns of the successful members

1350
01:12:20,731 --> 01:12:21,420
of that group.

1351
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:26,420
The leaders of that tribe.
That's where traditions and came from.

1352
01:12:26,821 --> 01:12:31,440
That's where skills were passed on and
that's where ethics and that's where

1353
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:35,010
certain philosophies were passed down
from generation to generation.

1354
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:40,040
These were the most beneficial to the
community as a whole to the individual,

1355
01:12:40,081 --> 01:12:43,230
to the culture,
whatever the whatever it is.

1356
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:49,050
This world that we're living in today,
we're almost in a lot of ways,

1357
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:53,670
like you were saying,
people with so much opportunity but to

1358
01:12:53,671 --> 01:12:56,370
lazy.
We're almost in a lot of ways just

1359
01:12:56,371 --> 01:13:01,371
lacking in a pattern,
a correct pattern and a coach or a

1360
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,880
mentor or a person who is ahead of you,
but honest like ahead of you as far as

1361
01:13:09,661 --> 01:13:12,540
like maybe been alive longer or maybe
had more experiences,

1362
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:16,440
but very honest about the difference
between you and them.

1363
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:19,530
Because a lot of people think that you,
you see some.

1364
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:23,970
Like we're talking about today,
this is a ridiculous analogy,

1365
01:13:23,971 --> 01:13:28,350
but when I was on MTV,
we're talking about downtown Julie Brown

1366
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:33,090
because I was singing on the line and I
remember thinking while you were saying

1367
01:13:33,091 --> 01:13:33,730
that,
like you,

1368
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:37,710
you go downtown,
Julie Brown was probably on MTV back

1369
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:39,600
when you were unhappy.
And I was like,

1370
01:13:39,601 --> 01:13:41,210
yeah,
but I was a peon.

1371
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,010
Like she wouldn't know who I was.
I was on one of,

1372
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,980
you know,
x amount of Comedians on the MTV half

1373
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,780
hour comedy hour.
Like I couldn't probably couldn't even

1374
01:13:48,781 --> 01:13:50,340
talk to her,
say hi to her.

1375
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:55,730
And then I remember thinking like I put
myself in that state of mind that I had

1376
01:13:56,071 --> 01:14:00,330
back when I was 23 or whatever I was
when I was on that show and I felt like

1377
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,540
insignificant and like,
well that's downtown Julie Brown.

1378
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:08,130
And then I realized like now that that's
nonsense.

1379
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:13,190
Like now I know that's nonsense,
but in my head thinking about that time

1380
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:16,580
I felt like I did when I was 23.
That like,

1381
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,420
yeah,
that was your first reply.

1382
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:19,991
You're like,
yeah,

1383
01:14:19,991 --> 01:14:21,970
but I was just a p on that.
And then all of a sudden,

1384
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:25,060
I think once you thought about first few
seconds you're like,

1385
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:26,810
you know what,
f that,

1386
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:31,270
well it's so ridiculous.
But I did think that way back then.

1387
01:14:31,271 --> 01:14:33,730
I think a lot of other people think that
way now.

1388
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:36,310
You know,
and whether it's a someone who's an

1389
01:14:36,311 --> 01:14:39,880
aspiring archer that looks at your
accomplishments and then looks at you

1390
01:14:39,881 --> 01:14:43,020
back when you were this stalker kid
hanging around a bowshot yeah.

1391
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:47,740
In comparison to how they are.
And I think that that's a big,

1392
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:51,760
that's a big help to people to hear a
story like that and to know that now you

1393
01:14:51,761 --> 01:14:56,761
travel all over the world and you coach
international teams and to see someone

1394
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:01,960
it admit that I think is very important
to see someone discussed that I think is

1395
01:15:01,961 --> 01:15:05,800
very important to a lot of us because we
don't really.

1396
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:10,150
Most people don't have fucking mentors
and most people aren't even involved in

1397
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:13,090
like a discipline that tests them in
that manner.

1398
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:15,100
We're involved.
A lot of people are involved in

1399
01:15:15,101 --> 01:15:16,090
education,
right?

1400
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,920
You go through high school,
you go to college,

1401
01:15:17,921 --> 01:15:19,040
get a degree,
you're studying,

1402
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:22,330
you're practicing.
But how much of that what you're doing

1403
01:15:22,331 --> 01:15:27,331
has the aspects of the obsession with a
discipline like archery or like Jujitsu

1404
01:15:28,331 --> 01:15:31,750
or something along those lines.
You're not getting the same intensity

1405
01:15:31,751 --> 01:15:34,240
and focus.
You're reluctant to do the work.

1406
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:37,000
You're doing it because you have to
because you got to get a degree because

1407
01:15:37,001 --> 01:15:39,760
you got to get a job because you don't
want to be a loser and so you're

1408
01:15:39,761 --> 01:15:43,600
pursuing these things with a lack of
passion and then you enter into the

1409
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:46,600
workforce.
Hopefully you're doing what you love.

1410
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,070
Most of the time people are not.

1411
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:50,980
Most of the time people are doing what
they think is a good job that they can

1412
01:15:50,981 --> 01:15:55,981
get by with and so they're committed to
this path of not being excited,

1413
01:15:56,801 --> 01:15:59,890
not being obsessed,
and then not challenging themselves and

1414
01:15:59,891 --> 01:16:04,891
not rising above and not gathering up
some of the possible lessons that you

1415
01:16:05,441 --> 01:16:08,800
can and it could be anything.
It could be anything.

1416
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:12,610
If you want to make knives,
if you love making jackets,

1417
01:16:12,611 --> 01:16:14,680
if you like painting,
it doesn't.

1418
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:18,910
There's no one particular thing that it
should be for you.

1419
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:22,600
You just have to find out whatever
starts that spark in you.

1420
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:23,790
For you.
It was archery.

1421
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,180
For me,
it was standup comedy,

1422
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:26,950
you know,
or martial arts,

1423
01:16:26,951 --> 01:16:27,760
you know,
it could be,

1424
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,420
it could really be anything,
but I think we need things like that.

1425
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:35,150
If people don't have things like that,
if they just work and then they go home

1426
01:16:35,151 --> 01:16:37,480
and they watch TV and they work and they
go home and watch tv,

1427
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:41,710
you're not,
you're not fucking living life at level

1428
01:16:41,711 --> 01:16:43,510
10,
you're not going to hit it.

1429
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:45,460
You're never gonna feel that.
And I'm not saying you're gonna be at

1430
01:16:45,461 --> 01:16:48,130
level 10 every day,
but there's going to be some moments

1431
01:16:48,131 --> 01:16:49,660
like when you were talking about,
you know,

1432
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:51,550
being on the line,
you know,

1433
01:16:51,551 --> 01:16:55,030
wha to archers,
this is the for one shot,

1434
01:16:55,031 --> 01:16:59,260
for the gold medal and alert that,
that feeling,

1435
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:03,460
those,
those feelings are integral to being a

1436
01:17:03,461 --> 01:17:06,310
human being.
The feelings of being challenged and of

1437
01:17:06,311 --> 01:17:10,130
learning what you're capable of and what
you're not capable of through

1438
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,080
those challenges.
Absolutely.

1439
01:17:12,081 --> 01:17:15,710
And the thing is too,
you have to be able,

1440
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:20,540
when you've made that decision,
the next thing that you should come to

1441
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:22,370
terms with is say,
you know what?

1442
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:26,810
I'm going to push myself further and
I've ever pushed myself and I know damn

1443
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:29,510
good and well there's going to be a
block.

1444
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:33,020
There's gonna be resistance.
I heard in a podcast for me long ago,

1445
01:17:33,021 --> 01:17:36,110
you talked about the book,
the war of art.

1446
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,060
I bought it,
Steven Pressfield.

1447
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,480
I bought it.
So you know,

1448
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,220
it talks about resistance and actually
you know,

1449
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:46,490
with you learning this new release for
your archery,

1450
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:50,090
I told you before you even made your
first shot,

1451
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:54,710
there is going to be a point where
you're not going to like this and you

1452
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:57,680
need to know right now that we're going
to push through it.

1453
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:02,510
So a lot of times when people make that
determination and that decision in life,

1454
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,261
have,
you know what?

1455
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:05,750
I'm going to go to the gym.
I'm going to get ready.

1456
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:10,010
You need to also think you know what?
There's going to be.

1457
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:13,400
I'm going to have a voice in my head
that's going to tell me this is too hard

1458
01:18:13,401 --> 01:18:15,380
and I'm going to have a point of
resistance,

1459
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,410
but I'm telling myself right now when I
get that,

1460
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:22,310
that's my opportunity to go further than
I've ever had in the past.

1461
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:27,080
I know right now that when I get to that
I am pushing through it.

1462
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:33,630
If you're only focused on one particular
goal and not seeing the obvious

1463
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:37,870
distractions or things that are going
to,

1464
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,380
that you know are going to be in that
path and mentally build,

1465
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:46,060
build up yourself to know when I get to
that resistance,

1466
01:18:46,061 --> 01:18:47,540
I am driving through.
You know,

1467
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:50,440
I listen to that podcast with Steve
[inaudible] and he talked about.

1468
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:55,620
He knew he was ready to beat his habits
and when he was in there and they're

1469
01:18:58,091 --> 01:19:00,370
like telling him that he should be
going.

1470
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:01,390
He's like,
no,

1471
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:03,300
I want.
Like,

1472
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,090
he probably knew deep down inside that
if he left,

1473
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:08,230
he was.
That was,

1474
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,750
it was gonna be an opportunity for him
to fail.

1475
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:14,650
So he had already made up his mind that
he was going through that.

1476
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:20,340
And so many people in life just don't
push that one time and then they never

1477
01:19:22,601 --> 01:19:26,000
really see how far they can go.
You know,

1478
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,100
I heard like,
um,

1479
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:30,460
one time I heard Les Brown say,
um,

1480
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,850
you know,
would you rather go through life?

1481
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:39,180
I'm aiming too high and miss or aiming
too low and hit.

1482
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:45,680
I mean,
I would rather aim high and fall short

1483
01:19:45,681 --> 01:19:50,681
and still be further ahead then aiming
too low and hitting exactly a low goal.

1484
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:57,140
You know,
I think you have to be willing to fail

1485
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:01,010
and get good at it.
I lost way more tournaments than I've

1486
01:20:01,011 --> 01:20:04,190
ever won.
And some of the people that like

1487
01:20:04,191 --> 01:20:06,910
question why I'm at where I'm at in
archery that are,

1488
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,340
well,
we never won that much.

1489
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,320
You know what?
I'm probably lost more than anybody.

1490
01:20:10,321 --> 01:20:13,890
That's good.
But I dang sure know that it made me a

1491
01:20:13,891 --> 01:20:16,470
better person.
And then when I lost,

1492
01:20:16,471 --> 01:20:21,270
I was at the tournament the next week
making sure that I worked on whatever it

1493
01:20:21,271 --> 01:20:23,520
was that caused me to lose.
You know,

1494
01:20:23,521 --> 01:20:27,390
I think I remember a guy one time
saying,

1495
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:30,630
you know,
you haven't really figured out how to

1496
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:32,520
win yet,
but,

1497
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,410
and that's critical for an athlete.

1498
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,960
Well,
it's critical that that moment that

1499
01:20:36,961 --> 01:20:41,490
happens in any competition where you're
worried about the event,

1500
01:20:41,491 --> 01:20:46,491
you're worried about the outcome and
that worry can overwhelm your abilities.

1501
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:46,940
Yup.

1502
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:48,230
Yeah,
absolutely.

1503
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:52,220
And when you get to that point,
you have to be willing to dig deep down

1504
01:20:52,221 --> 01:20:53,210
and say,
you know what?

1505
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:57,170
This is what I've worked for.
I knew this was coming.

1506
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,180
You know,
if it,

1507
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:04,330
if there wasn't nervousness and the
possibility of defeat or victory,

1508
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:11,360
then there probably wouldn't be any
sense of inner accomplishment to it.

1509
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:14,720
You've literally done everything you can
to get to that moment.

1510
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:18,140
That's a defining moment.
So which way are you going to go,

1511
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:20,060
you know?
Then you have a decision to make.

1512
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:25,510
And for me,
my victories were so much sweeter

1513
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:31,540
because I had failed a lot before that
and it got to the point where I remember

1514
01:21:31,851 --> 01:21:36,851
being in a match one time and I had
taken like several second thirds leading

1515
01:21:37,401 --> 01:21:40,220
up to that and I remember getting there
and I just,

1516
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:44,120
I closed my eyes on that last Arrow and
I just am like,

1517
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:47,330
I'm freaking sick.
Have blown it,

1518
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:51,020
screw that.
I'm not doing it again.

1519
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:53,150
I'm going to make a good shot.

1520
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,940
Visual rocky movie.
Yeah.

1521
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:58,260
Yeah.
And then.

1522
01:21:58,261 --> 01:22:02,170
So I just closed my eyes
and made

1523
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,630
the shot.
And then when I made it,

1524
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:10,090
the victory seems so much sweeter
because I had pushed through adversity

1525
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:11,550
to get there.
You know?

1526
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,830
I think that's,
that's what I love about archery is

1527
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:15,581
that,
you know,

1528
01:22:15,581 --> 01:22:18,610
one day you're so good and then the next
day you know,

1529
01:22:18,611 --> 01:22:20,530
you see flaws and you see mistake.

1530
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:24,640
What's a long rabbit hole too?
That's the weirdest thing about archery.

1531
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,590
You wouldn't think it's such a long
rabbit hole.

1532
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:29,230
There's so much to learn.
So many different places to go.

1533
01:22:29,231 --> 01:22:30,670
And there's so many people that your
watch,

1534
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,380
you watch TV.
I've,

1535
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:35,620
I've taken to,
I watch hunting shows much to the

1536
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:37,570
Chagrin of my family.
I think it's Hilarious,

1537
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:41,080
but some of them are so bad.
They're so,

1538
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:44,080
they're such bad production.
Like if you want to learn bad

1539
01:22:44,081 --> 01:22:45,760
television,
like say if you're a person out there

1540
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:48,850
that's aspiring to do a TV show,
there's some,

1541
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,990
there's some hunting shows out there
that look like they were made by blind

1542
01:22:52,991 --> 01:22:57,520
people that were drunk and the animals,
like they,

1543
01:22:57,530 --> 01:22:58,363
they,
they,

1544
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:01,810
especially the archery shows they
fucking miss more than they hit them.

1545
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:07,140
I mean if someone from like if wanted to
make an argument against the ethical use

1546
01:23:08,561 --> 01:23:12,000
of archery for hunting,
all they need to do and where to go

1547
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:15,420
watch some of those fucking shows.
But it's this.

1548
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,080
I think it's,
you know,

1549
01:23:17,090 --> 01:23:21,190
it's a difficult thing to do and some
people kind of half asset and some of

1550
01:23:21,191 --> 01:23:23,770
those people that do have acid,
they're on television.

1551
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,240
Well,
and that brings up a really good point

1552
01:23:26,241 --> 01:23:30,290
because I know a lot of people that
probably are listening that you either

1553
01:23:30,291 --> 01:23:34,190
know myself or know that you're a
hunting advocate and a conservationist

1554
01:23:34,191 --> 01:23:39,191
like myself.
We owe it to ourselves as an art,

1555
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:42,500
you know,
as a hunting community to realize that

1556
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:47,650
there's a big opposition pushing back
and we have a responsibility to

1557
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:54,640
represent ourselves ethically and also
appreciate other people's feelings and

1558
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:59,210
you know,
appreciate that there are people that

1559
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:04,240
might not like it and you really have an
opportunity to either do something

1560
01:24:04,401 --> 01:24:08,600
that's going to really piss them off.
Or if you're going to maybe do something

1561
01:24:08,601 --> 01:24:11,480
to where it'll at least let them keep an
open mind.

1562
01:24:11,481 --> 01:24:12,314
Now.

1563
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:14,620
Well,
the best way to do that I think is have

1564
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:16,090
conversations about it.
Oh yeah.

1565
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,040
I mean,
I can't tell you how many facebook

1566
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:20,740
messages and twitter messages I've
gotten from people that have told me

1567
01:24:20,741 --> 01:24:24,940
that they had a particular view,
a negative view about hunting and until

1568
01:24:24,941 --> 01:24:28,960
they listen to like maybe a podcast with
Steve Rinella or Cameron Hanes or Jim

1569
01:24:28,961 --> 01:24:30,850
shockey,
and they realize like,

1570
01:24:30,851 --> 01:24:33,010
oh,
this is not what I think it is.

1571
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:38,160
Not only is it not what I think it is,
you must do something to control these

1572
01:24:38,921 --> 01:24:41,350
animal populations.
And the one thing,

1573
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:42,250
I've said this before,
but I'm gonna.

1574
01:24:42,251 --> 01:24:46,390
Say it again to anybody that thinks
there's no reason to ever kill wild

1575
01:24:46,391 --> 01:24:48,670
animals.
I have two words for you.

1576
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:51,610
Feral pigs.
You can't.

1577
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:54,550
You better do something because if you
don't do something,

1578
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:58,600
they will fucking overwhelmed the earth.
What about people?

1579
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:00,760
Man?
People are overwhelming.

1580
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,840
Earth team that.
Yeah,

1581
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:04,720
I like people.
You can have sex with them,

1582
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:06,700
you can talk to them and you go to the
movies with them.

1583
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:09,100
They make cars.
I'm a big fan of Pete,

1584
01:25:09,410 --> 01:25:13,070
except people that make parking lots.
They're making some narrow parking.

1585
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:13,610
Listen.
Oh,

1586
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:14,443
foreign.
Okay.

1587
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:17,630
Somewhere in the.
Somewhere in the last 10 years,

1588
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:22,660
whoever was working for like American
and United Airlines that made economy

1589
01:25:22,941 --> 01:25:27,941
plus and then took the big dump on the
regular economy seats for someone

1590
01:25:28,401 --> 01:25:32,480
finally fired those people and then they
started designing parking lots because

1591
01:25:32,481 --> 01:25:35,330
fricking you can't park your junk in
anything anymore.

1592
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:39,320
They never have an obvious way to like
get to the Strip mall.

1593
01:25:39,321 --> 01:25:42,750
That's right next door.
They make you like exit the Fricken Pac

1594
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,430
man exit or like you have to go around
all the ghosts and shit to like finally

1595
01:25:46,431 --> 01:25:50,510
get to the one way to get out and then
turn and go down to get into the next

1596
01:25:50,511 --> 01:25:52,100
one.
Well they definitely try to shove

1597
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:55,490
too many spots in places like,
uh,

1598
01:25:55,491 --> 01:25:59,480
I was somewhere recently.
Oh Santa Barbara where it's real nice,

1599
01:25:59,481 --> 01:26:02,210
but there's not that many people.
And one of the things I noticed when I

1600
01:26:02,211 --> 01:26:02,781
was there,
it was like,

1601
01:26:02,781 --> 01:26:07,520
well how the parking spots are the nice
and wide because they're not overwhelmed

1602
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:11,540
by the same amount of people.
There's only like a 100,000 people in

1603
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:14,880
all of Santa Barbara.
It's like an easier way to get around

1604
01:26:14,881 --> 01:26:15,650
down there.
Yeah.

1605
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:18,030
Like that Cam and there's too many.
God.

1606
01:26:18,031 --> 01:26:19,540
Damn.
I don't want to remember.

1607
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:22,040
You ready to move Jamie's thumbs up from
Jamie.

1608
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,230
What's that?
We're moving to Santa Barbara.

1609
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:25,880
Fuck it.
Let's do that.

1610
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:31,280
Do you need a person to like you need a
full time range manager?

1611
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:34,490
They need to build a range.
That's the next step.

1612
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:37,550
If I get deeper and deeper with this
amount of open up an archery shop.

1613
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:39,380
I think so for sure.
I think,

1614
01:26:39,381 --> 01:26:41,420
uh,
an archery school would be the way to

1615
01:26:41,421 --> 01:26:42,230
go.
Honestly.

1616
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:45,890
I really think that there were a lot of
different martial arts schools and I've

1617
01:26:45,891 --> 01:26:49,530
been involved in a bunch of them and I
think that a teaching martial arts is

1618
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:52,250
gigantic,
but one of the things that's a problem

1619
01:26:52,251 --> 01:26:56,930
with archery and most particularly with
bow hunting is the learning curve is

1620
01:26:56,931 --> 01:27:00,230
extremely steep and it's not obvious at
all as to where to start.

1621
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:04,760
The learning curve to start archery is
just go to an archery store,

1622
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:06,830
go to a shop.
But I mean,

1623
01:27:06,831 --> 01:27:09,700
I've had experience with shops that
didn't know what they were doing and

1624
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:13,160
went there and I got bad advice from
them and I saw people that really didn't

1625
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:15,200
exactly know what they were doing and
they were telling me,

1626
01:27:15,201 --> 01:27:16,250
Oh,
you don't need that.

1627
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:21,280
Oh you don't need this.
And there's so many people out there

1628
01:27:21,651 --> 01:27:25,880
that probably would be interested in,
in archery.

1629
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,370
And I know there's a lot of people that
are interested in hunting as well.

1630
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:33,170
They just don't know where to start.
And I think having like classes in a

1631
01:27:33,190 --> 01:27:36,740
liquor shop is probably a really good
idea and probably something I'm going to

1632
01:27:36,741 --> 01:27:39,650
get into in the future.
Well I want to see that.

1633
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:40,610
Yeah,
no I wouldn't let them in,

1634
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:43,670
but I would have to a grand open.
Alright man you're in.

1635
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:48,770
But I would have to most certainly have
people that were there that were really

1636
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,200
good,
that could teach classes and teach

1637
01:27:51,201 --> 01:27:52,520
people how to do it.
You know,

1638
01:27:52,521 --> 01:27:55,850
like we were showing you show me the
video of your son hunting alligators.

1639
01:27:56,210 --> 01:27:58,340
And I said it right as you were saying.
I was like,

1640
01:27:58,341 --> 01:28:01,520
look at his form,
like your kid is like,

1641
01:28:01,521 --> 01:28:04,130
it's perfect form like a world champion
archer,

1642
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:09,310
like the ways God has his posture,
the way he released and when you know

1643
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:10,470
we're,
we're,

1644
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:11,570
we're,
we're watching that.

1645
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:11,991
I was thinking,
well,

1646
01:28:11,991 --> 01:28:16,730
here's a kid that has learned from the
beginning how to do it correctly.

1647
01:28:16,731 --> 01:28:20,510
So when you look at him as opposed to
that picture that you sent me of the

1648
01:28:20,511 --> 01:28:22,610
archer that's on television,
that as a,

1649
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,280
uh,
an arrow that he's pulling back his

1650
01:28:25,281 --> 01:28:28,730
string is deep,
tucked into his face were for sure.

1651
01:28:28,731 --> 01:28:32,300
When you're pulling your string back and
it's digging into your face,

1652
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:35,270
the,
the pressure of your face on that string

1653
01:28:35,271 --> 01:28:37,970
is going to change the path of the hour.
You should never supposed to dig it into

1654
01:28:37,971 --> 01:28:39,170
your face.
Like this guy has it.

1655
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:43,250
Then you look down,
his Arrow is not even attached to the

1656
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:45,680
string.
It's like hanging off and he doesn't

1657
01:28:45,681 --> 01:28:47,450
even know it.
It is the most.

1658
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:51,090
And this guy is on television and that
fucking picture was used for an ad.

1659
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:54,770
The picture was on an ad,
which means they took the picture,

1660
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:58,730
somebody looked at it and they were so
careless that they weren't good enough.

1661
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,170
Keep going.
We got it,

1662
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:03,930
nailed it,
and they took that and they put it on

1663
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:06,360
television.
I'm ordered to put it in a magazine or

1664
01:29:06,361 --> 01:29:09,300
what have you.
But when you see someone who started

1665
01:29:09,301 --> 01:29:11,650
from the beginning,
like your son with perfect form it.

1666
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,290
How old was he in?
At like 10.

1667
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:15,390
Yeah,
he started when he was nine.

1668
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:17,600
So in that picture,
what would that video with the alligator

1669
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:21,150
tab,
when you see that as opposed to someone

1670
01:29:21,151 --> 01:29:23,040
who's been doing it wrong their whole
life.

1671
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:26,760
You realize the importance of original
technique,

1672
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:29,490
like having it like the original
lessons.

1673
01:29:29,491 --> 01:29:31,920
The first lesson is you get imprinting
correctly,

1674
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:32,810
yo.
Yeah.

1675
01:29:32,810 --> 01:29:35,570
Yeah.
And that's a big part of what I'm doing.

1676
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:37,700
Can I plug the fuck?
Yeah.

1677
01:29:37,730 --> 01:29:38,380
Yeah.
Well your,

1678
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:39,210
your show,

1679
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:42,230
which is called knock on TV.
It's on a sport.

1680
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:45,120
What's not departments channel
sportsmans channel.

1681
01:29:45,121 --> 01:29:46,650
And they're both owned by the same
people.

1682
01:29:46,651 --> 01:29:49,920
Now the outdoor channel and the
sportsman channel are both owned by the

1683
01:29:49,921 --> 01:29:50,290
same people.

1684
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:51,300
And then,
you know,

1685
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:53,320
the youtube site,
knock on archery,

1686
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,960
there's a lot of,
if you go through there and if you're

1687
01:29:55,961 --> 01:29:59,020
not a hunter,
then move past that because there's a

1688
01:29:59,021 --> 01:30:02,800
lot of how to stuff and that's the
direction that I'm really going to be

1689
01:30:02,801 --> 01:30:05,140
going.
The whole focus on this brand.

1690
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:07,100
Um,
knock on which I think I had,

1691
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:08,900
I think I have a hat on.
Um,

1692
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:10,120
you know,
it's,

1693
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:15,120
it was a brand intended for people that
aren't really necessarily wanting to say

1694
01:30:16,721 --> 01:30:19,960
I'm a hunter,
but I'm an archer and so much of what

1695
01:30:19,961 --> 01:30:24,961
this show is geared around and it took a
long time for me to convince the network

1696
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:28,000
for me to dedicate.
You know,

1697
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:30,220
right now I have three segments that
are,

1698
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:34,210
how to be better with your form when the
dead center segment.

1699
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:39,190
Then the field recon segment is how to
be better in the field as an hunter,

1700
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:40,570
you know,
some type of a technique.

1701
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:43,750
And then I have the third segment called
knocked and ready to rock,

1702
01:30:43,751 --> 01:30:48,751
which last year was literally how to buy
a bow and completely set up the boat,

1703
01:30:48,961 --> 01:30:50,390
start to finish throughout the whole.

1704
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:51,870
And there's a video of that.
Oh,

1705
01:30:51,871 --> 01:30:54,280
it's over an hour long.
It's on Youtube,

1706
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:59,310
which is a very difficult time consuming
and involved process.

1707
01:30:59,381 --> 01:30:59,750
Yep.

1708
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:03,800
And then this year the knocked and ready
to rock segment is all about learning to

1709
01:31:03,801 --> 01:31:07,640
build your own arrows.
But as I move forward through the

1710
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:10,130
seasons and through the,
through the Youtube Channel,

1711
01:31:10,610 --> 01:31:14,390
I'm going to continue to try to work on
building all these fundamentals to

1712
01:31:14,391 --> 01:31:18,950
become a good shooter.
And Harry and my wife,

1713
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:22,100
they both started out with no experience
at all.

1714
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:27,080
And it's funny how if you show the basic
fundamentals and you're taught right

1715
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:32,090
from the very beginning,
how easy you can get to perfect form.

1716
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:35,930
It's when you go into it with like,
you know,

1717
01:31:35,931 --> 01:31:38,370
I always say women and kids are way
easier to teach.

1718
01:31:38,371 --> 01:31:41,300
And then guys,
because there's not the macho factor,

1719
01:31:41,390 --> 01:31:42,250
you know,
guys are like,

1720
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,000
Shit Dude,
I know how to grab care.

1721
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:45,320
Give me that.
I'll show you how to do it.

1722
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:48,350
Also do being a loser.
Yup.

1723
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:49,080
Whereas

1724
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,730
people who are not worried about,
man,

1725
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:55,170
if I fuck this up,
damn dude,

1726
01:31:55,171 --> 01:31:58,080
I'm a loser in this cause of winter.
Like there's a lot of people that don't

1727
01:31:58,081 --> 01:32:00,160
like learning things because they don't
want to fuck

1728
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,150
up.
You know,

1729
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,140
and I think when you,
you teach a,

1730
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:07,420
a woman or a young person,
they have less ego.

1731
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,120
They don't think of themselves as being
this shit yet.

1732
01:32:10,410 --> 01:32:12,230
Oh,
well there were women don't just say,

1733
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:14,890
just don't have as many ego problems has
been do in that regard.

1734
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:17,100
Well there's two.
There's two t,

1735
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:17,740
you know,
I've,

1736
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:20,980
I've,
I've looked a lot into sports psychology

1737
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:23,320
and I won the first time I talked to
you.

1738
01:32:23,321 --> 01:32:26,380
One of the things where I was really
hoping you could help me with and if

1739
01:32:26,381 --> 01:32:29,380
anyone's listening out there that's like
a sports psychologist.

1740
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:31,660
I actually,
I have a,

1741
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:35,110
I have a big add problem.
I'm very.

1742
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:41,010
But it also has been a huge part of my
success as an archer because I zone

1743
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:44,500
things out.
There's times where I've been in

1744
01:32:44,501 --> 01:32:46,360
competitions,
people come up to me and say,

1745
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:47,021
Hey,
sorry,

1746
01:32:47,021 --> 01:32:48,580
I bumped you with the camera or
whatever.

1747
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:51,100
It's like when.
Because I like,

1748
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:54,790
I don't like,
you're so tunnel visioned on stuff.

1749
01:32:54,791 --> 01:32:56,740
So you see heads in those tunnels.
Yeah.

1750
01:32:56,741 --> 01:32:59,740
The head's kind of was a distraction.
That was my adderall.

1751
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:01,060
But yeah,
I've,

1752
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,860
I've really wondered,
you know,

1753
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:07,030
is is a d,
d or You know that.

1754
01:33:07,031 --> 01:33:10,000
Is that like an asset to get in the zone
faster?

1755
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:12,650
But yeah,
we talked about that and my,

1756
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:16,810
my issue is what is add,
you know,

1757
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:21,850
I'm not exactly sure that everyone who
has add is really has a disorder,

1758
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:24,190
a lot of that.
Right.

1759
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:27,670
I think a lot of is a style of thinking
or way of thinking.

1760
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:32,710
You know right now,
like my dad's a psychologist and it's

1761
01:33:32,711 --> 01:33:36,730
amazing to me how many people will,
you know,

1762
01:33:36,731 --> 01:33:39,580
I've got friends that will like go to
the shrink for a 30 minute session.

1763
01:33:39,581 --> 01:33:40,340
Then they're like,
oh,

1764
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:41,140
I got some adderall.

1765
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:45,730
Do to get add really bad when I got,
when I got diagnosed with mine,

1766
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:50,620
I went for three different days and
almost did like a psychological

1767
01:33:50,621 --> 01:33:53,380
evaluation.
I mean it was like questioning,

1768
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:54,850
questioning,
questioning,

1769
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:58,110
and I remember like reading through this
thing that,

1770
01:33:58,290 --> 01:34:01,150
that uh,
that a true psychologist did to diagnose

1771
01:34:01,151 --> 01:34:03,970
what I had.
And I remember one of the lines said it

1772
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:07,900
was like one of the beginning lines.
It's like John has always been a fairly

1773
01:34:07,901 --> 01:34:11,830
normal boy.
He never had a problem soiling his

1774
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,770
linens or something like that.
It was.

1775
01:34:13,771 --> 01:34:17,230
That sounds like someone became a serial
killer.

1776
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:20,920
John has always been a normal boy until
we found the one hand sticking out of

1777
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:23,060
the dirt in the backyard.
We never suspected anything.

1778
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:24,940
That's kind of what it was like.
But,

1779
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:29,830
but it's a d and D is add recognized a
hundred percent.

1780
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:33,430
Like is it a universally recognized?
Like there's an issue with add?

1781
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:35,350
I would say.
So they argue,

1782
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:38,140
they argue that it's the case against
add.

1783
01:34:38,141 --> 01:34:41,800
How about that Google that they shot?
They argue that there's more,

1784
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:44,930
there's more people coming,
you know,

1785
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:49,870
that are saying they have add and I
think because doctors are so quick to

1786
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:52,130
prescribe nowadays,
but what does it,

1787
01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:54,220
what does it mean?
It means attention deficit disorder.

1788
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:56,370
So what is exactly that mean?
Well,

1789
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:57,770
for me,
sometimes

1790
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:01,460
people are talking to maybe when I'm so
zoned out on something else,

1791
01:35:01,461 --> 01:35:02,540
I never hear it.
You know,

1792
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:06,200
there's just constant distraction.
There's constant distraction.

1793
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:11,240
If I'm tuned into you then you know,
a lot of times like,

1794
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:14,390
you know,
I'll be focused on something and my wife

1795
01:35:14,391 --> 01:35:19,340
like has to snap at me like a dog see,
but that to me is not attention deficit

1796
01:35:19,341 --> 01:35:21,170
disorder.
That's not attention deficit it.

1797
01:35:21,171 --> 01:35:23,660
Oh,
that's extreme attention on one thing.

1798
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:28,280
Just an unwillingness to engage with
distractions,

1799
01:35:28,281 --> 01:35:31,850
but then there's times what's weird
about it is then there's times where

1800
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:36,851
you're trying to focus on something and
it's like every stimuli comes into play.

1801
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,720
One of those things that you're trying
to focus on,

1802
01:35:41,721 --> 01:35:45,260
is it ever anything that you're really
interested in or is it just some shit

1803
01:35:45,261 --> 01:35:48,220
you have to do,
like fix a pipe or you know,

1804
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:51,650
certainly there's times where people are
talking to you and you really don't want

1805
01:35:51,651 --> 01:35:52,250
to listen to them.

1806
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:55,100
That's the.
I have a feeling that's what attention

1807
01:35:55,101 --> 01:36:00,101
deficit disorder is.
People are bored as fuck or that is what

1808
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:05,420
every casino.
There's this wide range of the way

1809
01:36:05,421 --> 01:36:10,010
people think and the way people address
situations like you couldn't even see it

1810
01:36:10,011 --> 01:36:13,670
in your children.
Like have my middle child is very

1811
01:36:13,671 --> 01:36:17,930
outgoing and very loud and silly and
she'll talk to anybody but my youngest

1812
01:36:17,931 --> 01:36:18,631
child,
she.

1813
01:36:18,631 --> 01:36:21,290
If she doesn't know you,
she ain't saying shit.

1814
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:22,940
I know.
Say Hi to her and she was like,

1815
01:36:22,941 --> 01:36:24,620
whatever dude,
she'll hide behind me.

1816
01:36:24,621 --> 01:36:27,950
I can talk to this guy.
Like she just has her own style of

1817
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:32,980
engaging with people and they both also
have their own very distinct likes and

1818
01:36:34,611 --> 01:36:36,890
dislikes.
As far as like the kind of TV shows they

1819
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:40,760
like or the kind of toys they like or
the kind of art that they do and I just

1820
01:36:40,761 --> 01:36:45,761
think that that same variety applies to
things that people are interested in and

1821
01:36:47,751 --> 01:36:49,310
not interested in in life.

1822
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:52,850
And we take these fucking kids,
man,

1823
01:36:52,851 --> 01:36:55,970
and this is a big part of the problem
with education.

1824
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:00,410
There's a lot of different jobs out
there and the path for a guy who wants

1825
01:37:00,411 --> 01:37:04,040
to be a professional archer versus the
path for a guy wants to be an audio

1826
01:37:04,041 --> 01:37:06,410
engineer.
These are very different paths and they

1827
01:37:06,411 --> 01:37:09,230
involve very different amounts of data,
different,

1828
01:37:09,231 --> 01:37:11,420
different kinds of data,
different stimuli.

1829
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:14,600
And we take people and especially when
they're young,

1830
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:18,830
we make them pay attention to shit they
don't give a fuck about and I don't

1831
01:37:18,831 --> 01:37:21,530
think it's good for them.
And I think we see like when I was in

1832
01:37:21,531 --> 01:37:22,341
high school they always said,
oh,

1833
01:37:22,341 --> 01:37:23,650
he doesn't pay attention.
He's got no pr.

1834
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:28,580
Put something in front of me that I care
about and that's all I pay attention to.

1835
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,920
So it's not that I'm a fucking Ne'er do
well,

1836
01:37:31,070 --> 01:37:33,380
but you,
you make me feel like I am made me feel

1837
01:37:33,381 --> 01:37:37,550
like I'm a loser because I don't give a
fuck about math or Spanish history.

1838
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:40,190
Sorry,
it's not ringing my 13 year old head.

1839
01:37:40,191 --> 01:37:43,310
I'm thinking about tits right now and I
have time for Spanish history.

1840
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:46,010
I don't give a fuck,
but you might talk to me about pirates

1841
01:37:46,011 --> 01:37:49,850
and all of a sudden for whatever reason
that spark gets lead and now I'm

1842
01:37:49,851 --> 01:37:52,940
interested and now I'm obsessed with
pirates and I want to read books about

1843
01:37:52,941 --> 01:37:57,240
pirates and I want to talk about pirates
is sorts of different things that people

1844
01:37:57,241 --> 01:38:00,660
get excited about and interested in.
But the problem I think,

1845
01:38:00,661 --> 01:38:05,661
or one of the problems with formalized
education and are some for some strange

1846
01:38:06,241 --> 01:38:09,570
reason,
our need to diagnose certain styles of

1847
01:38:09,571 --> 01:38:14,571
thinking and certain styles of
approaching life as problematic as add

1848
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:16,610
or he's got,
you know,

1849
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:18,490
he's got adhd.
Oh,

1850
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:19,950
he's just,
he can't stop.

1851
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:23,700
He's in a fucking classroom.
They're teaching nonsense.

1852
01:38:23,701 --> 01:38:25,170
He's sitting on a plastic chair.

1853
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:26,940
He wants to run through the fucking
wall.

1854
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:28,650
It's everything.
I could do,

1855
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:31,110
I have a neighbor and sometimes it's got
corners me,

1856
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:33,150
okay.
And he'll tell me some stupid shit about

1857
01:38:33,151 --> 01:38:37,080
his son's basketball game or some other
shit and I literally want to run up a

1858
01:38:37,081 --> 01:38:40,800
tree.
I just want to and I don't have add.

1859
01:38:40,801 --> 01:38:43,020
I'm not,
I'm not unwilling Adhd,

1860
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:46,680
I'm fucking bored man.
And you're kidnapping me with this

1861
01:38:46,681 --> 01:38:49,750
stupid goddamn conversation.
And I'm like Yay,

1862
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:50,760
look at the time,
got to go.

1863
01:38:50,761 --> 01:38:52,110
So I told him,
you know,

1864
01:38:52,111 --> 01:38:54,030
if you're going to get some time on that
bench.

1865
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,780
And that's how I felt when I was in
school.

1866
01:38:57,781 --> 01:39:01,260
I felt a lot of that in school and I
think that that's a lot of what's going

1867
01:39:01,261 --> 01:39:03,930
on.
We're all interested in different shit

1868
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:07,950
and formalized education in a lot of
circles and a lot of schools.

1869
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:10,920
It's just too limited for some of the
kids in class.

1870
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:13,410
I remember Harry,
his first football team,

1871
01:39:13,411 --> 01:39:18,090
I'm thinking he was like nine or 10 and
one of the kid shows up with like a big

1872
01:39:18,091 --> 01:39:21,180
can of monster and he's drinking it in
the.

1873
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:25,680
And we were trying to control the kid
and I went over to mom and I said like,

1874
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:27,750
you know,
and it was every day,

1875
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:29,760
how old is this kid?
He was 10.

1876
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:33,690
All My.
And I remember going over and the mom

1877
01:39:33,691 --> 01:39:35,010
said,
the mom goes,

1878
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:37,950
yeah,
we just have such a problem control.

1879
01:39:37,951 --> 01:39:42,030
And the thing is it was eight in the
morning for a football game.

1880
01:39:42,210 --> 01:39:43,530
And she goes,
we just,

1881
01:39:43,730 --> 01:39:47,400
he just never listened.
I mean the doctor says he has add and

1882
01:39:47,401 --> 01:39:50,190
I'm like,
you just gave him a green monster at

1883
01:39:50,191 --> 01:39:53,640
eight in the morning.
He's 10 and he had like a double can of

1884
01:39:53,641 --> 01:39:55,740
monster.
I'm talking the big ones.

1885
01:39:56,550 --> 01:40:00,720
How much do you think he weighed?
A hundred pounds.

1886
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:04,350
Cheeses.
That's.

1887
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:08,740
I could be wrong,
but that's more than two adult size

1888
01:40:08,741 --> 01:40:12,040
servings could be wrong,
but I think I know the problem.

1889
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:14,020
Yeah.
It might be your kids on crank.

1890
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:18,550
I mean that's crank.
That's like extreme doses of caffeine

1891
01:40:18,790 --> 01:40:22,060
and sugar and sugar in those things.
And you don't even know what else.

1892
01:40:22,061 --> 01:40:22,661
Really.
Yeah.

1893
01:40:22,661 --> 01:40:25,990
And you know what man,
they gotta stop selling you some Shit

1894
01:40:25,991 --> 01:40:30,340
and saying it's more than one serving
five that you can't do that anymore.

1895
01:40:30,341 --> 01:40:33,400
You got to stop doing that.
If it's in one package and it's like a

1896
01:40:33,401 --> 01:40:35,890
drink,
that's a fucking serving.

1897
01:40:35,891 --> 01:40:36,724
Stop saying it

1898
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:37,630
to servant.
Yeah.

1899
01:40:37,780 --> 01:40:41,470
Unless it's like a box of like
something.

1900
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:46,070
You know that you're going to cook.
If it's a box that's multiple surveys,

1901
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:49,420
don't tell me this bottle of waters to
fricking service.

1902
01:40:49,490 --> 01:40:50,660
Well that's fine.
Well,

1903
01:40:50,661 --> 01:40:53,210
he'd say it well you could say that.
No,

1904
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,810
that's fine.
Because there's no.

1905
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:59,230
There's no negative consequences and
drinking a bottle of water.

1906
01:40:59,231 --> 01:41:02,460
It's universally agreed that an eight
ounce bottle of water or it's not going

1907
01:41:02,461 --> 01:41:05,410
to hurt anybody,
but one of those fucking monster energy

1908
01:41:05,411 --> 01:41:09,970
drinks,
or my trainer had a protein bar the

1909
01:41:09,971 --> 01:41:12,040
other day.
It was like a small one to men.

1910
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:13,990
It was only like maybe three inches
long.

1911
01:41:13,991 --> 01:41:16,780
It was a small protein bar.
And he goes,

1912
01:41:16,781 --> 01:41:17,710
oh,
I gotta get my protein bar.

1913
01:41:17,711 --> 01:41:19,720
Go your candy bar.
I'm fucking with him.

1914
01:41:19,721 --> 01:41:20,071
I go,
Dude,

1915
01:41:20,071 --> 01:41:21,130
you're eating candy.
He goes,

1916
01:41:21,131 --> 01:41:22,050
no man.
I go,

1917
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:24,550
how many grams of sugar in that?
And he goes,

1918
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:25,870
nine.
I go,

1919
01:41:25,871 --> 01:41:26,800
really?
I go,

1920
01:41:26,801 --> 01:41:29,080
how many servings in each bar goes,
no way.

1921
01:41:29,081 --> 01:41:30,610
I go check.
He goes,

1922
01:41:30,611 --> 01:41:32,540
fuck.
I go,

1923
01:41:32,541 --> 01:41:35,260
that's 18 grams of sugar in that little
tiny thing.

1924
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:36,243
It's a candy.

1925
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:37,011
Yeah,
absolutely.

1926
01:41:37,011 --> 01:41:40,250
I coached that with teams actually
because when I competed,

1927
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:43,220
the one thing that I think was that I
found really,

1928
01:41:43,221 --> 01:41:48,221
really helpful is to be able to travel
and keep yourself in your same daily

1929
01:41:49,431 --> 01:41:54,431
routine with your rest and your diet and
more importantly your garbage intake

1930
01:41:55,790 --> 01:42:00,790
because people will go to a tournament
and then they'll pop in and they'll grab

1931
01:42:00,891 --> 01:42:02,180
like,
you know,

1932
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,760
a power bar,
you know,

1933
01:42:04,761 --> 01:42:07,610
like the chocolate covered power bar.
And then they go to a tournament and

1934
01:42:07,611 --> 01:42:10,970
they're like having a snack and then all
of a sudden like two targets that either

1935
01:42:10,971 --> 01:42:12,410
like,
I don't know what's up,

1936
01:42:12,411 --> 01:42:14,810
I'm kind of like bouncing all over the
place and I'm thinking,

1937
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:17,870
you're on your own.
You just had 40 grams of sugar.

1938
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:19,100
And they're like,
when?

1939
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,031
And I go,
well,

1940
01:42:20,031 --> 01:42:21,340
you just say that,
um,

1941
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:23,390
marathon bar,
you know,

1942
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:26,960
19 grams of sugar per serving.
Yeah,

1943
01:42:26,961 --> 01:42:28,030
double it.
You know,

1944
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:31,670
you just like totally had a full blown
insulin drop,

1945
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:32,533
you know.

1946
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:34,610
And you do have one too.
You know,

1947
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:38,240
I've been on this crazy diet now for two
months and I stepped off of the other

1948
01:42:38,241 --> 01:42:40,490
day.
I had a cheeseburger and a chocolate

1949
01:42:40,491 --> 01:42:42,080
shake.
Ooh,

1950
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:44,200
wait,
wasn't worth it.

1951
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:45,620
It wasn't worth it.
But it was,

1952
01:42:45,710 --> 01:42:47,720
it was worth,
it was worth something.

1953
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:49,340
It was worth something while I was
eating it.

1954
01:42:49,370 --> 01:42:51,770
It was glorious.
It was a wonderful cheeseburger with

1955
01:42:51,771 --> 01:42:54,020
blue cheese and bacon.
It was very good.

1956
01:42:54,021 --> 01:42:56,330
And the chocolate shake,
it was pretty God damn good.

1957
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:58,460
And the chocolate shake,
it was a chocolate malt.

1958
01:42:58,461 --> 01:43:02,360
In fact,
pretty God damn good but good Lord

1959
01:43:02,361 --> 01:43:06,800
because I haven't been eating that way.
The crash after it was over,

1960
01:43:06,801 --> 01:43:09,920
it was devastating.
Like I could barely stay awake an hour

1961
01:43:09,921 --> 01:43:13,970
later because my insulin level,
just my whole body was just like,

1962
01:43:13,971 --> 01:43:18,560
what did you do after months?
Two months of eating clean.

1963
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:24,760
You just took a shit in your mouth.
And I recognized that that had probably

1964
01:43:25,491 --> 01:43:29,300
been been in normal thing for me for
most of my life.

1965
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:34,850
If I'd eaten a cheeseburger and a shake
within an hour afterwards,

1966
01:43:34,851 --> 01:43:37,130
I just was crashed.
I was just done.

1967
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:40,160
But that's most people,
the way they eat all the time,

1968
01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:42,320
they just get used to that terrible
feeling.

1969
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:44,740
When I.
When I give seminars,

1970
01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:46,870
you know,
a lot of times you have a lunch break

1971
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:52,020
and I pay attention to the people when
they hit the lunch break.

1972
01:43:52,430 --> 01:43:56,090
I pay attention to like what some people
are eating because you can tell a lot by

1973
01:43:56,091 --> 01:43:57,860
a person,
by what they're throwing.

1974
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:01,910
If you've got an option of something
good or something crap.

1975
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:05,360
There's some people that just like go
right for the crap.

1976
01:44:05,361 --> 01:44:07,220
Then there's some people that go for the
good stuff.

1977
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:10,250
As soon as like your session starts back
up,

1978
01:44:10,251 --> 01:44:15,251
and I'm sure you've done this where you
give like speeches or seminars after

1979
01:44:15,381 --> 01:44:18,470
meals,
there's always like for people that are

1980
01:44:18,471 --> 01:44:21,750
like out and they can't help it,
right?

1981
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:26,860
Because they ate a bunch of garbage and
they had this huge insulin dump and you

1982
01:44:28,671 --> 01:44:30,830
know,
they've their bodies like trying to

1983
01:44:30,831 --> 01:44:35,831
fight off all that and then they crash
and a lot of times I'll like wake people

1984
01:44:36,111 --> 01:44:37,520
up and I'll say,
okay,

1985
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:41,660
I was waiting for that to happen because
now is what I want to talk about the

1986
01:44:41,661 --> 01:44:46,661
importance of nutrition during
performance because the reason several

1987
01:44:47,091 --> 01:44:50,750
people in here can't stay awake right
now is because of what they did during

1988
01:44:50,751 --> 01:44:51,620
their lunch break.

1989
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:55,190
A lot of,
a lot of events,

1990
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:58,280
sports related events that are like all
day events.

1991
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:01,730
They have breaks.
Archery always had a break at noon.

1992
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:05,870
I never wanted to be hungry at the
break.

1993
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:11,200
I tried to continually pick and hydrate
throughout the whole event just like I

1994
01:45:11,991 --> 01:45:15,470
do at home during the day so that I
wasn't starving.

1995
01:45:15,471 --> 01:45:19,580
You see competitors that are leading the
pack and they run to the fricking

1996
01:45:19,581 --> 01:45:23,480
concession stand and they want to like
pound two or three burgers because they

1997
01:45:23,481 --> 01:45:26,660
know that they're not going to get to
eat til 5:00 and then all of a sudden

1998
01:45:26,661 --> 01:45:31,661
their scores just start to peter out and
they start making mistakes and then all

1999
01:45:31,881 --> 01:45:35,710
of a sudden towards the end they come
back again and they're saying like,

2000
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:38,060
Hey,
I just had that fricking though several

2001
01:45:38,061 --> 01:45:39,860
ends.
I just struggled and it's like,

2002
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:41,990
how do you think?
Yeah.

2003
01:45:42,110 --> 01:45:44,360
Well,
at the time I wasn't like telling all my

2004
01:45:44,361 --> 01:45:46,710
competitors online.
I saw that cover

2005
01:45:46,830 --> 01:45:51,830
well until you try to live clean,
until you try to eat clean and you don't

2006
01:45:52,231 --> 01:45:55,770
eat cheeseburgers and shakes.
You don't understand how much of an

2007
01:45:55,771 --> 01:45:59,850
impact it really has because I think
people associate how they feel with just

2008
01:45:59,851 --> 01:46:01,320
normalcy.
They think that,

2009
01:46:01,321 --> 01:46:02,310
well,
this is just what happens.

2010
01:46:02,370 --> 01:46:03,210
You know,
at the end of the day,

2011
01:46:03,211 --> 01:46:03,841
I get tired,
man.

2012
01:46:03,841 --> 01:46:07,410
I need naps.
When I started drawing this primal diet,

2013
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:11,160
the MERC system diet and I started,
I brought my body into a state of

2014
01:46:11,161 --> 01:46:12,230
ketosis.
Yep.

2015
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,790
Was the first time ever that in between
meals.

2016
01:46:14,791 --> 01:46:18,840
I didn't have that crash.
Why didn't feel terrible where like I

2017
01:46:18,841 --> 01:46:22,050
could go six,
seven hours and not feel bad at all

2018
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:25,020
because your body,
when it hits that state is starting to

2019
01:46:25,021 --> 01:46:28,890
burn off the fat and so your body has a
supply of fat,

2020
01:46:28,891 --> 01:46:32,070
so it just starts converting the fat in
your body to energy.

2021
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:37,140
It's amazing.
It's amazing that so few people eat and

2022
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:38,070
live like this.
Yeah.

2023
01:46:38,071 --> 01:46:38,904
That was a.

2024
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,090
That was really interesting because the
one thing I asked you was I said,

2025
01:46:43,110 --> 01:46:45,900
what's really the difference between
that and the Adkins?

2026
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:48,150
Right.
More fats and that was,

2027
01:46:48,210 --> 01:46:49,140
to me,
it made.

2028
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:50,221
Then,
you know,

2029
01:46:50,221 --> 01:46:52,500
where the Atkins,
there's a lot more focused on the

2030
01:46:52,501 --> 01:46:54,510
protein.
You know,

2031
01:46:54,511 --> 01:46:57,690
I get people that are uneducated on
eating clean,

2032
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:58,940
you know,
we look at what we,

2033
01:46:58,950 --> 01:47:02,820
you and I just ate for lunch.
I mean we like knocked back and avocado,

2034
01:47:02,821 --> 01:47:05,460
like nothing.
Some people are afraid of anomaly ocado

2035
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:09,330
because they say it's fattening.
I mean talk about not knowing what's up.

2036
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:09,910
Yeah,

2037
01:47:09,910 --> 01:47:14,910
they don't understand what dietary fats
and the importance of certain amounts of

2038
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:20,350
healthy fats,
of getting the amount of oils and fats

2039
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:23,680
that your body needs.
Healthy oils super important and avocado

2040
01:47:23,681 --> 01:47:27,010
oil and Avocados in general,
one of the most healthy fats you can

2041
01:47:27,011 --> 01:47:28,330
consume,
super,

2042
01:47:28,331 --> 01:47:29,900
super good for you.
You know,

2043
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:34,920
and getting the right amount of
nutrients in your body has just such a

2044
01:47:35,771 --> 01:47:39,250
massive effect on how the whole goddamn
thing works.

2045
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:42,820
And again,
I go back to the mentor thing and the

2046
01:47:42,821 --> 01:47:47,821
life coach thing because until you have
talked to someone that you trust that

2047
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:50,440
that's done it and is there,
you know,

2048
01:47:50,441 --> 01:47:54,850
until you know some guy who's a
competitive marathon or something like

2049
01:47:54,851 --> 01:47:55,511
that.
And he says,

2050
01:47:55,511 --> 01:47:56,710
listen,
you know,

2051
01:47:56,950 --> 01:47:59,410
if you do this,
your body will work better.

2052
01:47:59,411 --> 01:48:02,470
You got to trust me.
You got to trust me and try to clean up

2053
01:48:02,471 --> 01:48:03,880
your diet and try to,
you know,

2054
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,110
just if most people just cut out just
one thing at a time,

2055
01:48:08,350 --> 01:48:09,760
they would see a big difference.

2056
01:48:09,930 --> 01:48:12,210
I actually have a thing that I call
having,

2057
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:16,050
um,
I've got a ton of success stories of

2058
01:48:16,051 --> 01:48:21,051
hunters that were motivated by posts
that I made with like food or,

2059
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:23,550
you know,
they just see a post that I do and

2060
01:48:23,551 --> 01:48:24,330
they're like,
I really,

2061
01:48:24,330 --> 01:48:26,190
I'm just tired of where I'm at.
As,

2062
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:29,190
you know,
billy bob the bow hunter or you know,

2063
01:48:29,191 --> 01:48:31,140
I'm tired of where,
where I'm at archery.

2064
01:48:31,141 --> 01:48:34,230
I've never been in it 10 years and I've
never made progress.

2065
01:48:34,231 --> 01:48:35,910
What do I need to do?
You know,

2066
01:48:35,911 --> 01:48:38,970
I'll get some photos of them in.
A lot of times I notice that they're out

2067
01:48:38,971 --> 01:48:40,350
of shape and I'm like,
listen,

2068
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:45,060
if you're shooting on a line and you
look down and you can't see your feet

2069
01:48:45,061 --> 01:48:45,481
because,
you know,

2070
01:48:45,481 --> 01:48:50,481
a big part of my shot routine is,
is the first step is really your feet.

2071
01:48:51,631 --> 01:48:52,770
You know,
your stance.

2072
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:55,100
I mean like imagine martial arts,
you're,

2073
01:48:55,101 --> 01:48:56,520
you know,
you're trying to talk someone about

2074
01:48:56,521 --> 01:48:58,230
their stance.
I can't even see their feet.

2075
01:48:58,231 --> 01:48:59,070
Well it's like,
okay,

2076
01:48:59,071 --> 01:49:01,410
well we need to address another problem
as well,

2077
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:03,750
you know,
you might not want to hear this but we

2078
01:49:03,751 --> 01:49:07,800
need to address this problem.
And for me when I started down that

2079
01:49:07,801 --> 01:49:09,720
path,
because I had about three years of my

2080
01:49:09,721 --> 01:49:11,160
life where I,
you know,

2081
01:49:11,161 --> 01:49:15,660
it's funny how when it comes to like the
path of an Arrow or the path of life,

2082
01:49:16,110 --> 01:49:21,110
all it takes is the smallest movement to
get you going a certain direction and

2083
01:49:22,231 --> 01:49:26,040
then all sudden before you know it,
you're like so far off the course and

2084
01:49:26,041 --> 01:49:27,750
you're like,
how the hell did I get here?

2085
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:30,280
And,
and I had a point in my career,

2086
01:49:30,281 --> 01:49:31,320
I was that way.
I was like,

2087
01:49:31,321 --> 01:49:32,430
you know,
I was like,

2088
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:36,360
I remember I had to,
I put on like a pair of 38 underwear and

2089
01:49:36,361 --> 01:49:38,790
I was like,
what the hell?

2090
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:41,000
You know,
I used to wear like 30,

2091
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:43,850
38 pants.
Now I'm in a 38 freaking.

2092
01:49:43,970 --> 01:49:46,470
And then I look at my legs because,
you know,

2093
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:49,720
I've got a good story about big bird,
but I always like,

2094
01:49:49,721 --> 01:49:51,400
I've got big bird legs,
you know,

2095
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:55,180
and I'm thinking frick,
that's how round my waist is,

2096
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:58,900
as long as that fricking leg,
that's how big around I am.

2097
01:49:59,290 --> 01:50:04,290
So what I started doing was just having.
And every time I ordered my normal meal

2098
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:08,560
at a restaurant,
if it comes out and there's a burger,

2099
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:12,640
I took half the bun and I just like.
And then half the fries fricking slit

2100
01:50:12,641 --> 01:50:14,320
them off and I gave them to the lady and
said,

2101
01:50:14,321 --> 01:50:18,490
can you take that?
And I would literally eat half the carbs

2102
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:22,000
that was on my plate.
I just have everything as soon as it

2103
01:50:22,001 --> 01:50:25,360
came out.
So I was in my normal routine in life.

2104
01:50:25,390 --> 01:50:30,250
If Sharon and I went to applebee's or
whatever and I ordered my normal little

2105
01:50:30,251 --> 01:50:33,010
meal.
If it was a carb or junk,

2106
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:36,070
whatever they gave me as a portion,
I halved it.

2107
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:41,490
And I mean just that.
And then getting rid of like soda and

2108
01:50:42,821 --> 01:50:45,970
all of a sudden it was just like zoom in
a matter of months.

2109
01:50:45,971 --> 01:50:50,971
You've just completely like change your
directional path and once you've done

2110
01:50:51,041 --> 01:50:54,460
the amount of calories and once you get
to that point,

2111
01:50:54,850 --> 01:50:58,990
you're motivated by what you're seeing.
And then it's like,

2112
01:50:59,710 --> 01:51:03,370
I'm going to have that again.
Like normally I'm used to having this,

2113
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:05,950
I'm going to have that again.
And you know,

2114
01:51:05,951 --> 01:51:08,200
there's times where I might feel like
bread,

2115
01:51:08,230 --> 01:51:11,050
like I told you that for the most part I
don't like,

2116
01:51:11,070 --> 01:51:13,120
you know,
I feel really good when I'm not eating

2117
01:51:13,121 --> 01:51:16,060
starch or carbs.
I feel way better that way.

2118
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:19,840
However,
certain carbs or I think really critical

2119
01:51:19,841 --> 01:51:21,400
for times where,
you know,

2120
01:51:21,401 --> 01:51:25,870
there's times where I'm needing to write
or I'm needing to speak and I kinda just

2121
01:51:25,871 --> 01:51:29,050
feel fuzzy in the head.
And for me it sometimes I think it's

2122
01:51:29,051 --> 01:51:33,730
like your cognitive is like craving some
brain foods so we should try some

2123
01:51:33,731 --> 01:51:35,660
ketones to.
I'm going to get you some exemptions.

2124
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:38,130
Ketones for digging,
trying your,

2125
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:40,130
your dietary routine.
It's

2126
01:51:40,430 --> 01:51:42,800
good.
Exonerations ketones have a big effect

2127
01:51:42,801 --> 01:51:45,530
on mental function is very,
very healthy for you too.

2128
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:46,670
It's all,
it's not,

2129
01:51:46,970 --> 01:51:48,860
not junk,
not stimulants,

2130
01:51:48,890 --> 01:51:50,960
you know,
just just healthy foods.

2131
01:51:51,170 --> 01:51:52,003
You know,
one of the things,

2132
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:53,070
one of the ways that,
uh,

2133
01:51:53,071 --> 01:51:56,450
I got to know Cameron Hanes is um,
because uh,

2134
01:51:56,600 --> 01:52:01,400
in being on a few hunts and going into
the mountains and experiencing what it's

2135
01:52:01,401 --> 01:52:06,260
like just to hike at high altitude,
just really underestimated the amount of

2136
01:52:06,261 --> 01:52:10,040
stress that it takes on your body,
how difficult it is to do.

2137
01:52:10,340 --> 01:52:15,140
And so then I started researching
fitness and fitness and hunting.

2138
01:52:15,790 --> 01:52:17,120
I'm like,
there's got to be someone out there

2139
01:52:17,121 --> 01:52:18,800
that's like really into it.
And then I found cam,

2140
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:22,940
just a fitness fucking nut does ultra
marathons and all that jazz.

2141
01:52:22,941 --> 01:52:26,690
And that's how cam and I became friends
is by looking at his,

2142
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:29,990
his sort of style of getting ready for
the mountains.

2143
01:52:29,990 --> 01:52:33,530
Like pretty much all of what he does
with his weight training,

2144
01:52:33,531 --> 01:52:35,240
whether it's just running,
running mountains.

2145
01:52:35,510 --> 01:52:37,910
It's preparing him to be a better
hunter.

2146
01:52:38,450 --> 01:52:43,010
And I don't think many people that view
hunting considered that they think of

2147
01:52:43,011 --> 01:52:47,300
hunting as being a fat guy who's beer
waiting for a deer to pass by so he

2148
01:52:47,301 --> 01:52:48,920
could shoot it in the Dick.
You know what I mean?

2149
01:52:48,921 --> 01:52:49,754
That's,
that's.

2150
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:52,400
That's how a lot of people look at
hunting.

2151
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:56,330
They look at as a bunch of cruel
assholes or that dentist guy who goes

2152
01:52:56,331 --> 01:52:58,400
over to Africa and shoots a line and
fucks it up.

2153
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:01,880
That's how a lot of people look at
hunting and that's one of the reasons

2154
01:53:01,881 --> 01:53:06,881
why hunting has a bad rap,
especially in terms of its benefit and

2155
01:53:07,530 --> 01:53:11,750
as a tool for conservation.
People will say,

2156
01:53:11,751 --> 01:53:12,584
well,
that's.

2157
01:53:12,730 --> 01:53:15,570
That's bullshit.
The only reason why people call it a

2158
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:18,530
conservation tool because it gives them
an excuse to kill animals.

2159
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:22,850
Most of the money,
most of the money to preserve wetlands,

2160
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:26,510
to preserve wildlife habitat.
Most of that money is a direct result of

2161
01:53:26,511 --> 01:53:28,620
hunting mostly lately.
Totally.

2162
01:53:28,630 --> 01:53:30,770
That's a fact.
It's an undeniable fact.

2163
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:33,530
So all these people out there that are
calling themselves conservationists that

2164
01:53:33,531 --> 01:53:37,340
never donate and then they'll say
something mean and rude about hunting

2165
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:39,680
and even eat a cheeseburger after they
say it.

2166
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:44,150
Like there's a lot of fucking crazy
intellectual dishonesty out there when

2167
01:53:44,151 --> 01:53:49,151
it comes to this subject and also in
terms of what we should or shouldn't do

2168
01:53:49,670 --> 01:53:51,440
in terms of being the stewards of the
earth.

2169
01:53:51,441 --> 01:53:53,270
Like we were talking about like wild
pigs.

2170
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:56,960
If you don't think that we should do
something to control the population of

2171
01:53:56,961 --> 01:53:59,120
wild pigs,
it's because you've never been around

2172
01:53:59,121 --> 01:54:01,250
wild pigs.
They have two,

2173
01:54:01,251 --> 01:54:04,250
three litters a year.
They'll have three or four babies every

2174
01:54:04,251 --> 01:54:07,100
litter,
litter and they fucking keep going and

2175
01:54:07,101 --> 01:54:09,350
get more than that.
How many of you they get and what is it

2176
01:54:09,351 --> 01:54:10,130
like,
hey eggs,

2177
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:15,130
I'm guessing seven to 10 in the litter
and how many liters a year?

2178
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:16,173
At least two,
right?

2179
01:54:16,510 --> 01:54:18,370
Yeah.
I think it's a,

2180
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:20,740
what is it?
Every three months I can chuck them out.

2181
01:54:20,770 --> 01:54:21,071
Well,
they can.

2182
01:54:21,071 --> 01:54:23,050
Chuck went out and six months after
being born,

2183
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:24,550
which is saying,
oh yeah,

2184
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:25,930
yeah,
it's there.

2185
01:54:25,990 --> 01:54:27,340
I mean,
it's,

2186
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:32,460
it's amazing how one or two pigs turns
into an absolute problem really fast and

2187
01:54:33,521 --> 01:54:35,290
even even at your house,
you know,

2188
01:54:35,291 --> 01:54:37,960
people,
there's people that give me slack if I,

2189
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:40,150
you know,
I posted that video of that coyote I

2190
01:54:40,151 --> 01:54:43,510
shot and then you know about the wolf
thing,

2191
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:46,300
but people have a problem with that and
it's like,

2192
01:54:46,690 --> 01:54:49,390
dude,
we were in your yard and your wife comes

2193
01:54:49,391 --> 01:54:52,330
out and there's like two Qa to coyotes
in the yard,

2194
01:54:52,331 --> 01:54:55,840
like scoping out your chicken house.
And then when she took the kids to

2195
01:54:55,841 --> 01:54:57,010
school,
she ends up telling us,

2196
01:54:57,011 --> 01:54:58,630
yeah,
there's a coyote running down the road

2197
01:54:58,631 --> 01:55:00,520
with the fricking rooster hanging out of
it's mouth.

2198
01:55:00,570 --> 01:55:01,450
Yeah,
they're common.

2199
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:02,860
I mean,
they're like,

2200
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:06,460
you have to,
you have to control some of that.

2201
01:55:06,461 --> 01:55:09,550
And I have to control Predator
populations because nothing else does.

2202
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:11,230
And white tails.
I'm telling you,

2203
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:13,300
I'm frank.
Zane,

2204
01:55:13,301 --> 01:55:18,301
he was a three time Mr Olympia frank
used to do are you still does?

2205
01:55:18,311 --> 01:55:21,130
He still does,
but frank and arnold used to do archery

2206
01:55:21,131 --> 01:55:23,710
as kind of an rnr,
you know,

2207
01:55:23,890 --> 01:55:26,390
from their bodybuilding.
That was kind of there.

2208
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:29,980
There's in their stress relief was
shooting and um,

2209
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:35,220
when I went to the Arnold and competed a
frank and Anne frank and Arnold ended up

2210
01:55:36,761 --> 01:55:39,850
coming in to have like a,
an old cow,

2211
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:42,280
like a competition like from the old
days,

2212
01:55:42,580 --> 01:55:46,200
so they into the hall to like each of
them shoot.

2213
01:55:46,230 --> 01:55:50,430
Well,
what Arnold didn't know was frank was so

2214
01:55:50,431 --> 01:55:55,431
competitive that frank actually talked
to the coordinator of the event and he

2215
01:55:57,541 --> 01:56:02,220
called her and said who are there any
really good archers coming that can

2216
01:56:02,221 --> 01:56:03,054
coach.

2217
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:07,110
So she asked around and ended up
connecting frank to me.

2218
01:56:07,111 --> 01:56:11,610
So when frank and I talked,
I was like a big fan of them because I

2219
01:56:11,611 --> 01:56:16,611
was a fitness guy for my stress relief
and he wanted coaching because he goes,

2220
01:56:17,310 --> 01:56:19,950
when Arnold Nice shoot together,
I don't want them to think that I've

2221
01:56:19,951 --> 01:56:21,900
practiced but I want to fricking beat
him.

2222
01:56:22,530 --> 01:56:26,640
So I actually like worked with them a
little bit and he did end up,

2223
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:29,730
you know,
he ended up shooting and then frank and

2224
01:56:29,731 --> 01:56:32,040
I became friends and he's,
you know,

2225
01:56:32,041 --> 01:56:35,670
he's an animal he's from.
He's down from San Francisco,

2226
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:37,440
South San Francisco.
I think,

2227
01:56:38,130 --> 01:56:42,690
and he never really talked negative
about me when he knew that I was a

2228
01:56:42,691 --> 01:56:46,320
hunter and stuff,
but I could tell it wasn't necessarily

2229
01:56:46,321 --> 01:56:48,220
something that he favored,
but I

2230
01:56:49,910 --> 01:56:51,280
will absolutely.
But he,

2231
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:54,000
he wasn't against it.
He wasn't like dead set against it.

2232
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,220
I think he just isn't interested in.
Right.

2233
01:56:56,280 --> 01:57:01,280
So I pick them up at the airport and
we're driving back and he said,

2234
01:57:01,291 --> 01:57:03,780
so do you like hunt deer all the time?
And I said,

2235
01:57:03,781 --> 01:57:04,950
yeah,
I have them all the time.

2236
01:57:04,951 --> 01:57:06,600
And he's like,
he's like,

2237
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:07,410
well,
how Kinda,

2238
01:57:07,410 --> 01:57:09,990
how do you,
how do you feel about it?

2239
01:57:09,991 --> 01:57:12,420
And I said,
you have to do it.

2240
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:13,800
And he's just like,
really?

2241
01:57:14,190 --> 01:57:18,090
And he never said anything negative,
but I remember we were three miles from

2242
01:57:18,091 --> 01:57:23,070
my house in a fricking deer comes across
the road and we're like in my little

2243
01:57:23,071 --> 01:57:26,130
Hyundai accent and I fricking smoke this
thing.

2244
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:28,400
And he's like,
he's just like,

2245
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:30,020
oh shit.
Like,

2246
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:33,040
he's like,
he's never seen like a fricking animals

2247
01:57:33,041 --> 01:57:35,310
smashed the car.
And um,

2248
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:37,980
and he's just like,
that was a freaking deal.

2249
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:39,300
We just hit a deer.
And I said,

2250
01:57:39,390 --> 01:57:44,390
yeah dude,
imagine if 850,000 people in the state

2251
01:57:44,701 --> 01:57:49,270
of Wisconsin weren't out hunting a year.
Eight hundred and $50,000.

2252
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:51,300
Is that how many?
Yeah,

2253
01:57:51,430 --> 01:57:53,680
between Bowen gun owners,
you can look it up.

2254
01:57:53,690 --> 01:57:56,650
I was in Wisconsin for opening season
not last year,

2255
01:57:56,651 --> 01:58:01,060
but the year before last and the morning
light is like a war just started.

2256
01:58:02,770 --> 01:58:05,080
It was like,
remember when we used to watch like

2257
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:07,720
shocking all,
like when the shock and all happen.

2258
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:09,360
That's what it sounds like.
Well,

2259
01:58:09,370 --> 01:58:13,840
we talked about Michigan on the podcast
before that in last year or every year,

2260
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:19,140
50,000 car accidents involving deer a
year just in Michigan alone.

2261
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:22,180
And so people that think,
well,

2262
01:58:22,181 --> 01:58:23,470
there's no other way to take care of
that.

2263
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:26,290
This is what people have to understand.
Unless you want to bring in wolves and

2264
01:58:26,291 --> 01:58:27,700
guess what?
You don't want to bring in wolves,

2265
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:30,940
wolves in your neighborhood.
You don't want to look that in the face.

2266
01:58:30,941 --> 01:58:32,020
Yeah.
Well you did.

2267
01:58:32,210 --> 01:58:32,700
You know,
I've,

2268
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:34,930
I've talked.
That story's crazy.

2269
01:58:34,931 --> 01:58:37,750
I was telling a friend of mine about it,
the,

2270
01:58:37,751 --> 01:58:38,860
uh,
the story of you,

2271
01:58:38,861 --> 01:58:42,430
you were in Alberta and you shot elk and
these wolves

2272
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:44,430
circled the elk.
How many,

2273
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:47,140
how many wolves were there?
Well,

2274
01:58:47,141 --> 01:58:52,141
at first there was just the one,
the one came in and you know,

2275
01:58:52,541 --> 01:58:55,300
the one came in on us and I,
and I,

2276
01:58:55,330 --> 01:58:57,730
and that's what I do want to say off the
beginning.

2277
01:58:57,731 --> 01:59:02,731
One thing that I always do as a hunter
is I always buy or Predator tag if it's

2278
01:59:03,161 --> 01:59:07,030
available,
if I know that I can get that I can buy

2279
01:59:07,031 --> 01:59:10,900
a tag for coyotes or wolves.
I always have one in my pocket because

2280
01:59:11,410 --> 01:59:12,580
you do see,
you know,

2281
01:59:12,610 --> 01:59:15,790
they're out there and they're out there
way more now and this.

2282
01:59:15,970 --> 01:59:20,970
And this is an exact reason why he got
to do it because literally we had an elk

2283
01:59:21,370 --> 01:59:24,760
down and next thing you know,
we're out there kind of,

2284
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:26,240
you know,
getting it ready to like,

2285
01:59:26,530 --> 01:59:29,890
you know,
to cut it up and stuff and get it out of

2286
01:59:29,891 --> 01:59:32,720
there and all sudden this big wolf comes
through,

2287
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:33,610
you know,
comes in.

2288
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:36,550
And I had spotted it and we weren't
really being noisy,

2289
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:42,000
so I ended up shooting that wolf and it
kind of went off and you know,

2290
01:59:42,161 --> 01:59:47,161
with a bow there's no noise.
So what we didn't realize was there was

2291
01:59:47,351 --> 01:59:49,870
a pack there and that,
that was actually,

2292
01:59:49,871 --> 01:59:53,110
it was an Alpha female is because of the
size of it.

2293
01:59:53,111 --> 01:59:58,111
I mean you saw the size of it is as big
as me and it actually went off and then

2294
02:00:00,010 --> 02:00:00,930
we kinda thought,
oh,

2295
02:00:00,980 --> 02:00:02,140
was freaky.
Freaky will.

2296
02:00:02,141 --> 02:00:06,580
Then about 20 minutes later all of a
sudden we see another one and we see

2297
02:00:06,581 --> 02:00:09,370
another one and we're kinda like,
holy crap.

2298
02:00:09,910 --> 02:00:14,910
So we start moving into this draw.
And one of them was like making a noise,

2299
02:00:15,251 --> 02:00:18,610
almost like it was injured or something.
I was whimpering.

2300
02:00:18,611 --> 02:00:20,050
So we're like,
what is the deal?

2301
02:00:20,051 --> 02:00:24,670
So we were on high ground with the elk
and then we started moving down into

2302
02:00:24,671 --> 02:00:28,240
this ravine because we saw the,
the wolves down in there.

2303
02:00:28,990 --> 02:00:33,280
And next thing you know,
we get down in there and I start looking

2304
02:00:33,281 --> 02:00:35,860
around and there's like hair on the
trees.

2305
02:00:35,861 --> 02:00:37,000
There's like,
I mean,

2306
02:00:37,090 --> 02:00:39,970
it looked like that movie into the gray,
the gray,

2307
02:00:40,030 --> 02:00:42,730
the gray,
that's exactly what it looked like.

2308
02:00:42,731 --> 02:00:45,640
Liam Neeson.
There was like frick and Harry turds

2309
02:00:45,641 --> 02:00:47,080
everywhere.
It was just,

2310
02:00:47,081 --> 02:00:50,380
there was like beds,
there was hair rubbed on the trees and I

2311
02:00:50,381 --> 02:00:54,040
start looking around,
there's like holes dug in and I'm like,

2312
02:00:54,130 --> 02:00:59,130
I literally look at my two buddies that
were there with me and I said right in

2313
02:00:59,321 --> 02:01:01,240
their fricking den,
like,

2314
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:03,790
you know,
and I think we had that elk was not too

2315
02:01:03,791 --> 02:01:04,590
far,
you know,

2316
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:08,640
our elk wasn't too far when you shot an
elk that they probably thought of as

2317
02:01:08,641 --> 02:01:10,960
there's.
Oh they definitely thought of it was

2318
02:01:10,961 --> 02:01:11,770
there.
So yeah,

2319
02:01:11,770 --> 02:01:13,960
they,
they definitely thought that was theirs.

2320
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:18,640
So then once we're down there,
all of a sudden we hear this.

2321
02:01:18,730 --> 02:01:21,210
How were like down there,
we hear this how,

2322
02:01:21,211 --> 02:01:25,270
and it was definitely an Alpha because
an Alphas the how.

2323
02:01:25,570 --> 02:01:30,570
It literally turns your blood instantly
cold if you're right in on a true wolf

2324
02:01:32,021 --> 02:01:32,860
howl.
It's,

2325
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:38,230
I mean it's like so freaking low and
deep and it's just like chills your

2326
02:01:38,231 --> 02:01:39,380
blood,
what you realize.

2327
02:01:39,381 --> 02:01:40,230
It's not a game.
Yeah.

2328
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:43,340
Then I realized I'm like,
we're in their fricking Dan and you

2329
02:01:43,341 --> 02:01:44,360
know,
I'm kind of looking down.

2330
02:01:44,361 --> 02:01:44,961
I'm like,
okay,

2331
02:01:44,961 --> 02:01:47,060
well I shot an elk.
Then I shot that.

2332
02:01:47,090 --> 02:01:50,210
I've got two arrows left.
So,

2333
02:01:50,450 --> 02:01:52,880
and you know,
both my guides kind of had,

2334
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:54,140
you know,
once we said,

2335
02:01:54,170 --> 02:01:56,030
oh there's wolves.
They like grabbed a gun.

2336
02:01:56,031 --> 02:01:58,250
We kind of went down in there to see
what was up.

2337
02:01:58,700 --> 02:02:02,630
Well now this happens and next thing
after that Alpha sounded off,

2338
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:03,553
it was like,

2339
02:02:07,150 --> 02:02:09,560
and I mean 12,
I think it was 12,

2340
02:02:09,561 --> 02:02:12,680
sounded off all the way around us.
We're in a,

2341
02:02:12,710 --> 02:02:14,240
we're,
we're literally down.

2342
02:02:14,241 --> 02:02:15,980
Anyone who's been in Alberta,
you know,

2343
02:02:15,981 --> 02:02:20,150
that the farm land is level and then it
falls into the river system.

2344
02:02:20,151 --> 02:02:23,420
So we're literally,
they have the high ground,

2345
02:02:23,570 --> 02:02:26,690
there's a dozen wolves and we're in the
middle and we're like,

2346
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:28,300
what the crap.
So I just,

2347
02:02:28,301 --> 02:02:32,150
I'm like get you back to a tree.
So we kinda all spin around and we're

2348
02:02:32,151 --> 02:02:37,151
sitting there and next thing you know
here comes to dogs on a full blown.

2349
02:02:37,251 --> 02:02:40,880
I'm talking like full blown like this
running,

2350
02:02:40,881 --> 02:02:45,881
coming and I mean it turned into chaos.
There was like bullets flying.

2351
02:02:46,281 --> 02:02:48,710
I mean there's freaking arrows skipping
off junk.

2352
02:02:48,711 --> 02:02:53,711
And we ended up shooting both of those
wolves dead and there's a few gunfire

2353
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:59,010
going off while I'm down to like one
Arrow left and I told the guy,

2354
02:02:59,011 --> 02:03:00,320
I said how many bullets you got?

2355
02:03:00,770 --> 02:03:03,740
And he goes,
well I didn't,

2356
02:03:03,790 --> 02:03:04,161
I,
you know,

2357
02:03:04,161 --> 02:03:06,470
I just grabbed the gun to a couple of
bullets.

2358
02:03:06,471 --> 02:03:09,170
Like I didn't know where this was all
going down.

2359
02:03:09,171 --> 02:03:11,990
So count,
we're kind of like we need to get out of

2360
02:03:11,991 --> 02:03:14,120
here.
So we started backing up and next thing

2361
02:03:14,121 --> 02:03:14,810
you know,
they,

2362
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:19,810
the Alpha sounded off again and they all
reported this time there's only two or

2363
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:25,100
two less.
So next thing I know,

2364
02:03:25,101 --> 02:03:27,050
I'm like kind of we're trying to back
out.

2365
02:03:27,051 --> 02:03:28,180
So when you say,
hold on a second,

2366
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:30,230
you say they reported there.
So there's,

2367
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:32,710
they know that two were dead.
Yeah.

2368
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:37,070
So all of them are howling.
I'm certain that the first.

2369
02:03:37,071 --> 02:03:42,071
How was the Alpha male pretty much
saying in is everyone in position

2370
02:03:45,170 --> 02:03:47,000
because then they all like.
Yes,

2371
02:03:47,001 --> 02:03:48,590
yes.
All the way around.

2372
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:52,880
Then all of a sudden the to come,
all hell breaks loose.

2373
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:58,220
Then we're like the alpha sounds again,
but he's in a different location.

2374
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:03,280
He was actually to my left like right
here and it really close and I mean it's

2375
02:04:03,981 --> 02:04:05,540
thick in there.
You've been there,

2376
02:04:05,570 --> 02:04:08,750
you know how thick it gets.
So then they sound awful.

2377
02:04:08,751 --> 02:04:11,930
Now this time there's two less,
so

2378
02:04:14,210 --> 02:04:18,170
I'm kind of looking because I know this
wolf that sounded was and I know it's

2379
02:04:18,171 --> 02:04:22,640
the Alpha so I like grabbed my boa and I
start kinda creeping over there and as

2380
02:04:22,641 --> 02:04:27,641
soon as I get to where I can see he's
like fricking standing right there.

2381
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:32,150
And how far our
30 yards

2382
02:04:33,780 --> 02:04:37,890
wolf can cover jamie.
Pull up that picture from Joe's

2383
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:41,100
instagram.
Like it was about a week ago.

2384
02:04:41,130 --> 02:04:43,110
You found those pictures of those
wolves?

2385
02:04:43,190 --> 02:04:44,780
Yeah.
I forget who the photographer was.

2386
02:04:44,790 --> 02:04:47,760
There got some amazing photographs or.
Yeah,

2387
02:04:47,820 --> 02:04:51,060
it was.
It was like not the most recent one that

2388
02:04:51,061 --> 02:04:52,380
was on that dead Moose.

2389
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:55,110
But it was from national geographic.
That was actually a bison.

2390
02:04:55,111 --> 02:04:56,820
Those from yesterday.
That's right.

2391
02:04:57,300 --> 02:04:58,860
Yesterday or the day before.
Look at that.

2392
02:04:59,330 --> 02:05:04,330
That right there.
That is exactly the face that I saw in

2393
02:05:05,791 --> 02:05:07,290
the.
Anybody was head on.

2394
02:05:07,291 --> 02:05:11,010
He wasn't broad side,
but that face where he was literally

2395
02:05:11,011 --> 02:05:14,580
looking at me like that.
And I mean you're in a fight or flight

2396
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:16,890
like I'm in.
Totally in a fight or flight.

2397
02:05:16,891 --> 02:05:21,090
I had one arrow left on my string.
I fricking grabbed my bow.

2398
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:22,650
I literally,
I like,

2399
02:05:22,710 --> 02:05:24,600
I just,
I kinda looked at him.

2400
02:05:24,601 --> 02:05:27,750
I knew at that moment it was like he was
coming.

2401
02:05:27,780 --> 02:05:30,850
Yeah.
That's like fricken Deja Vu,

2402
02:05:30,910 --> 02:05:32,130
right?
The twitter,

2403
02:05:32,131 --> 02:05:33,800
the instagram page.
Jamie

2404
02:05:33,870 --> 02:05:38,870
do go back up a little bit is c j I m
underscore photography and if you go to

2405
02:05:39,271 --> 02:05:42,780
that guy's instagram page has got
amazing photographs just.

2406
02:05:43,050 --> 02:05:46,250
And he's out there with them.
There was another one that I had and

2407
02:05:46,251 --> 02:05:48,000
it's just right before that,
Jamie,

2408
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:49,680
the.
Before that Wolf picture,

2409
02:05:49,681 --> 02:05:51,480
there was another wolf picture.
That one.

2410
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:54,660
Look at that one man,
he's got snow all over his face and his

2411
02:05:54,661 --> 02:05:55,300
teeth are.

2412
02:05:55,300 --> 02:05:56,600
That's cool.
Yeah,

2413
02:05:56,601 --> 02:05:59,750
that's a cool picture.
Like to me that's pretty cool.

2414
02:06:00,570 --> 02:06:02,480
Those are amazing.
They're amazing.

2415
02:06:02,510 --> 02:06:05,900
And the one thing people underestimate
about hunters is our respect for

2416
02:06:05,901 --> 02:06:07,310
animals.
I love him.

2417
02:06:07,311 --> 02:06:09,230
Why did you kill?
I freaking,

2418
02:06:09,290 --> 02:06:10,910
I totally respect him.
I love him,

2419
02:06:10,911 --> 02:06:14,420
but I can tell you that other picture
right there when you have that looking

2420
02:06:14,421 --> 02:06:17,690
at you in the face.
I mean I knew it was like freaking do or

2421
02:06:17,691 --> 02:06:21,080
die and I,
I literally looked at that thing and I

2422
02:06:21,081 --> 02:06:24,440
said out loud,
I said I'm going to shoot you in the F

2423
02:06:24,441 --> 02:06:27,320
and face because you don't swear.
Yeah,

2424
02:06:27,350 --> 02:06:28,280
sorry.
It's cute.

2425
02:06:28,340 --> 02:06:32,130
And
my boy might listen.

2426
02:06:32,930 --> 02:06:34,370
Remember I drew back.
Oh,

2427
02:06:34,371 --> 02:06:39,371
like I literally drew back and I
anchored and that came into my peep and

2428
02:06:41,230 --> 02:06:44,190
means for people don't know.
There's like a little circle that you

2429
02:06:44,191 --> 02:06:47,160
look at through the string.
We line lining up with the site.

2430
02:06:47,161 --> 02:06:52,161
So I was literally lining up the shot,
lining up the shot and as soon as I kind

2431
02:06:52,190 --> 02:06:55,320
of brought my shot down to where that
wolf was,

2432
02:06:55,410 --> 02:06:57,510
there was nothing there.
He bolted.

2433
02:06:57,560 --> 02:06:58,830
No,
I think he just like,

2434
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:00,830
yeah,
like Ninja.

2435
02:07:01,090 --> 02:07:05,080
Well he if there that wise and that big
in that old,

2436
02:07:05,140 --> 02:07:08,280
they've got to know what they mean.
Smart.

2437
02:07:08,310 --> 02:07:11,440
We had to have known that you killed the
elk and they had to have known that you

2438
02:07:11,441 --> 02:07:13,030
killed those other two wolves which
chased you.

2439
02:07:13,150 --> 02:07:15,040
That went after this to try and get the
ELC.

2440
02:07:15,070 --> 02:07:18,250
I think he came in to to think,
okay,

2441
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:21,430
we've.
You called a fight.

2442
02:07:22,420 --> 02:07:26,500
We responded,
now he's like sizing up.

2443
02:07:26,501 --> 02:07:28,510
Okay,
I've lost.

2444
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:33,010
Here's what I've lost.
I want to know what I'm going against.

2445
02:07:33,011 --> 02:07:35,500
He kinda came in and he freaking looked
at all

2446
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:40,250
and then that was it.
Good thing they can count for you.

2447
02:07:40,251 --> 02:07:43,390
Who you only had two hours left here.
Yeah.

2448
02:07:43,590 --> 02:07:44,860
Two hours.
Two bullets.

2449
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:46,820
Bullets.
That guy pick up and picked up.

2450
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:48,400
Three.
It was bone chilling.

2451
02:07:48,450 --> 02:07:49,630
I'm,
I mean I have,

2452
02:07:49,930 --> 02:07:54,550
you and I both have friends that are
grizzlies cats.

2453
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:57,160
I mean,
cats are notorious for stocking hunters

2454
02:07:57,161 --> 02:07:59,260
too,
because I mean they are the ultimate

2455
02:07:59,261 --> 02:08:03,250
hunter,
but grizzlies and wolves,

2456
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:06,270
I mean there you have to be on guard
that,

2457
02:08:06,271 --> 02:08:08,100
you know,
there's places now we're,

2458
02:08:08,140 --> 02:08:13,030
you know,
grizzlies are strongly becoming such a

2459
02:08:13,420 --> 02:08:15,910
problem when it comes to,
you know,

2460
02:08:15,911 --> 02:08:18,580
they have to be controlled.
They're just starting to get to be too

2461
02:08:18,581 --> 02:08:20,680
many for,
especially for the food source.

2462
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:25,090
Well there's people that worry about
them being wiped out and I read this

2463
02:08:25,091 --> 02:08:28,750
article about it recently and it was
just so filled with misunderstanding or

2464
02:08:28,751 --> 02:08:31,960
misinformation and we're talking about
wiping out grizzlies that if they did

2465
02:08:31,961 --> 02:08:34,840
open up back to grizzlies,
grizzlies back to hunting again,

2466
02:08:34,841 --> 02:08:35,740
they will be wiped out.

2467
02:08:35,980 --> 02:08:39,100
People don't understand how it works.
There's a lot meant a certain amount of

2468
02:08:39,101 --> 02:08:44,101
tags that get distributed because
wildlife biologist deemed that there's

2469
02:08:44,201 --> 02:08:48,400
too many of them and then it's
problematic for all the other animals

2470
02:08:48,401 --> 02:08:51,010
that live in the area.
You have to understand like when they

2471
02:08:51,011 --> 02:08:53,950
try to do,
when they put tag limits on white tail

2472
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:56,410
deer or would they put tag limits on
wolves?

2473
02:08:56,680 --> 02:09:00,760
They do it because they've deemed that
there's an issue and there's obviously

2474
02:09:00,761 --> 02:09:04,330
people want to hunt deer,
but there's also an issue,

2475
02:09:04,390 --> 02:09:06,300
like we were talking about the state of
Pennsylvania.

2476
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:08,140
There's some areas,
I don't know if it's still the case,

2477
02:09:08,141 --> 02:09:11,080
but there were some areas in
Pennsylvania where they brought in

2478
02:09:11,090 --> 02:09:14,050
hunter's year round,
no tag limits.

2479
02:09:14,230 --> 02:09:16,890
They were like,
just please come on down and shoot.

2480
02:09:16,930 --> 02:09:19,230
And it was on Michael Waddell,
uh,

2481
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:20,440
his show.
Oh yeah.

2482
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:22,090
T bone was there.

2483
02:09:22,090 --> 02:09:25,630
There was a shot like three or four deer
in a day and it was in the middle of

2484
02:09:25,631 --> 02:09:27,670
summer.
It's just went down there and shot deer

2485
02:09:27,671 --> 02:09:30,250
because there's just so many of them.
And they were shooting them in like a

2486
02:09:30,251 --> 02:09:33,430
residential area.
They were in a tree stand in like this

2487
02:09:33,431 --> 02:09:36,760
dude's fucking yard.
And it's overwhelmed with deers.

2488
02:09:36,820 --> 02:09:41,080
I think I,
I met a guy that was literally begging

2489
02:09:41,081 --> 02:09:43,720
me to come.
He said there's a deer season in the

2490
02:09:43,721 --> 02:09:48,721
residential areas I think in New Jersey.
And he said there's like so many deer in

2491
02:09:48,821 --> 02:09:53,440
people's backyards and the timber.
So he just said it's like there's just

2492
02:09:53,441 --> 02:09:58,130
so many that they're issuing a lot of
urban tags and they are wanting to.

2493
02:09:58,140 --> 02:09:59,290
Yeah.
And they have to.

2494
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:02,170
And they have.
Did you see the bears fighting in far

2495
02:10:02,171 --> 02:10:03,160
rockaway?
New Jersey.

2496
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:04,060
Did you see that video?

2497
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:09,190
Yeah,
bring up that video to no bullshit.

2498
02:10:09,340 --> 02:10:14,340
Bonafide seven foot 400 plus pound
bear's going to war in a residential

2499
02:10:15,670 --> 02:10:19,270
community.
Knocking over fucking mailboxes and

2500
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:22,870
garbage cans.
Roll it out into the street for flying.

2501
02:10:23,080 --> 02:10:25,750
Biting each other.
Look at the size of these fuckers.

2502
02:10:25,780 --> 02:10:28,930
But are they there?
Try to pet them or anything?

2503
02:10:28,931 --> 02:10:30,070
Yeah,
they should just be friends.

2504
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:34,260
But look at these guys going at it.
These are big fucking bears too.

2505
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:39,290
Big Boars the size of these guys.
And so we kind of move.

2506
02:10:39,291 --> 02:10:40,210
Is that.
What was the,

2507
02:10:40,211 --> 02:10:42,830
what was that a judo?
Throw his shitty Jujitsu.

2508
02:10:43,960 --> 02:10:45,740
Looking at.
He's reaching for a back leg.

2509
02:10:45,770 --> 02:10:48,590
It's like more than the answer.
Trying to ankle pick.

2510
02:10:49,770 --> 02:10:54,140
It went in for a back leg.
Well this goes on for a long time too.

2511
02:10:54,141 --> 02:10:56,720
In the guy who's filming it is filming
it from his car.

2512
02:10:57,170 --> 02:11:00,650
I guess he's got his hand out the window
and so they go crashing through the

2513
02:11:00,651 --> 02:11:02,990
bushes.
They go tumbling down to the street.

2514
02:11:02,991 --> 02:11:05,840
They take out some mailboxes.
I mean there's a mailbox.

2515
02:11:05,870 --> 02:11:08,720
Good Dude.
These fuckers are big man.

2516
02:11:08,750 --> 02:11:10,250
They're big ass bears.

2517
02:11:11,290 --> 02:11:12,310
Those are really big

2518
02:11:12,470 --> 02:11:14,150
and they,
they keep going back.

2519
02:11:14,151 --> 02:11:16,970
See this one guy wants the garbage and
that's where it is.

2520
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:19,970
Funny.
Have a lady just came out to go

2521
02:11:19,971 --> 02:11:22,550
shopping.
Well I fucking easily could happen.

2522
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:24,680
That's how people die.
Oh yeah.

2523
02:11:24,681 --> 02:11:27,240
This is lady got killed in Florida last
year by one of these fuckers.

2524
02:11:27,530 --> 02:11:28,363
Yeah,
they're,

2525
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:29,960
they're serious.
They mean,

2526
02:11:30,190 --> 02:11:32,610
I mean,
you're not bear barriers.

2527
02:11:32,790 --> 02:11:35,760
What a lot of people don't realize too.
I every year I go up,

2528
02:11:35,790 --> 02:11:36,930
you know,
you always catch,

2529
02:11:37,140 --> 02:11:40,800
you catch flack for being a bear hunter.
But I go up to British Columbia every

2530
02:11:40,801 --> 02:11:45,801
year and bear hunt and during and it's
all spot and stalk there.

2531
02:11:45,871 --> 02:11:48,000
It's all fair chase.
Um,

2532
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:53,810
but during the course of a six day hunt,
I remember one year I saw 82 bears on a

2533
02:11:57,241 --> 02:11:59,250
six day hunt.
That's insane.

2534
02:11:59,700 --> 02:12:02,310
I mean in some of the barriers you might
see twice,

2535
02:12:02,970 --> 02:12:05,850
but there was so many barriers and it's
like,

2536
02:12:05,851 --> 02:12:07,920
you know what,
you have to manage that.

2537
02:12:07,980 --> 02:12:11,340
It's healthy for them to.
Otherwise this happens and you want to

2538
02:12:11,341 --> 02:12:12,960
watch this in your yard.

2539
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:15,660
Well,
this is what could happen and what's

2540
02:12:15,661 --> 02:12:18,300
interesting is Jamie and I,
we were laughing because we found this

2541
02:12:18,330 --> 02:12:21,480
fucking poster,
this billboard that said they're all

2542
02:12:21,481 --> 02:12:26,160
cecil and it's a bear and a lion hugging
each other and it said,

2543
02:12:26,190 --> 02:12:31,190
stop the New Jersey Bear Hunt.
Like there are people out there that are

2544
02:12:31,590 --> 02:12:35,780
emotionally wreck there.
There are children there.

2545
02:12:35,781 --> 02:12:39,690
They're an emotional wreck there.
A child who doesn't understand that

2546
02:12:39,691 --> 02:12:42,570
nature is a ruthless,
vicious,

2547
02:12:42,750 --> 02:12:46,560
beautiful,
majestic thing and wildlife biologists

2548
02:12:46,561 --> 02:12:51,561
were the ones who know the best you.
You see these crazy emotional people

2549
02:12:51,991 --> 02:12:54,540
that get so wrapped up in this idea that
these things are.

2550
02:12:54,750 --> 02:12:58,080
These animals are like people.
They have this fucking picture of this

2551
02:12:58,290 --> 02:13:03,290
bear and this lion hugging each other
and the bear has tiers and the lion is

2552
02:13:03,331 --> 02:13:04,590
tears.
Look at this.

2553
02:13:05,190 --> 02:13:07,830
They're hugging each other.
It says they are a band.

2554
02:13:07,831 --> 02:13:10,470
The bear hunt,
they are all cecil saved,

2555
02:13:10,471 --> 02:13:13,980
New Jersey bears.com.
You guys were out of your fucking mind.

2556
02:13:14,010 --> 02:13:16,650
Wow.
These bears didn't exist.

2557
02:13:17,310 --> 02:13:18,990
They didn't exist and they were in a
movie.

2558
02:13:18,991 --> 02:13:21,840
They would be a monster.
Be some based living in the woods.

2559
02:13:21,841 --> 02:13:26,700
That fucking eats eats baby deer right
out of the vagina of the deer.

2560
02:13:26,701 --> 02:13:30,600
When they pull them out and they
literally catch a deer that's giving

2561
02:13:30,601 --> 02:13:32,100
birth to a and they pull them

2562
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:35,340
out of each other.
They eat cubs on a regular basis.

2563
02:13:35,341 --> 02:13:38,110
There's so much cannibalism and the bear
community.

2564
02:13:40,540 --> 02:13:42,260
It could be.
I'm thinking,

2565
02:13:42,750 --> 02:13:44,400
well,
they equal rights.

2566
02:13:44,430 --> 02:13:47,490
Tell me that fucking story that you were
telling me yesterday about the grizzly

2567
02:13:47,491 --> 02:13:50,730
bear that got into the shed or got into
the cabin.

2568
02:13:50,790 --> 02:13:53,610
Oh yeah,
and just the sheer power.

2569
02:13:53,850 --> 02:13:55,590
I actually have a.
my,

2570
02:13:55,780 --> 02:13:58,560
my like wilderness father,
his name is burt.

2571
02:13:58,650 --> 02:14:03,650
He's up up there where I hunt and BC.
He has stories of the wilderness.

2572
02:14:03,810 --> 02:14:07,620
He'd be the ultimate character for you
to have on and he's like a real life.

2573
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:09,930
Grizzly Adams.
He's got stories,

2574
02:14:09,931 --> 02:14:14,931
but there was a bear that kept
destroying the camps and the cabins.

2575
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:18,090
They ended up,
they ended up like just kind of calling

2576
02:14:18,100 --> 02:14:23,100
the bear earl big earl or something and
they would come to the camps.

2577
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,990
He would come in and they would have
like a huge big door,

2578
02:14:28,170 --> 02:14:29,610
you know,
and they would nail in,

2579
02:14:29,790 --> 02:14:30,511
you know,
nine,

2580
02:14:30,511 --> 02:14:35,190
10 inch spikes through the doorframe in
three spots down the sides.

2581
02:14:35,190 --> 02:14:38,430
And then through the top they'd nail 10
inch spikes,

2582
02:14:38,431 --> 02:14:42,700
pound them through the logs,
have a log home to hold the doorframe

2583
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:43,620
in.
Well,

2584
02:14:43,621 --> 02:14:47,160
they came to camp and they figured,
well this is going to keep him out

2585
02:14:47,161 --> 02:14:49,440
because he was blowing through all the
windows.

2586
02:14:49,740 --> 02:14:51,420
Every year he'd blow through the
windows,

2587
02:14:51,421 --> 02:14:54,480
so they boarded the windows up and they
had this door.

2588
02:14:54,780 --> 02:14:57,690
So evidently he got mad.
They could see where he was really mad

2589
02:14:57,691 --> 02:15:00,090
about how they boarded the door,
the windows up.

2590
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:05,480
So he literally grabbed the door and the
whole door and we'll.

2591
02:15:05,911 --> 02:15:10,590
The whole frame with the door was like
freaking laying off to the side of the

2592
02:15:10,591 --> 02:15:15,591
cabin with 10 inch spikes bent on 90
degree angles and there was one claw

2593
02:15:19,051 --> 02:15:22,140
there.
He had evidently reached in with two

2594
02:15:22,141 --> 02:15:27,141
claws and freaking hook the backside of
that doorframe and ripped a fricken door

2595
02:15:28,170 --> 02:15:32,070
out of a log home and pulled one of his
own closet and pulled his claw.

2596
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:35,340
That's how they knew they got the bear
because they ended up getting a permit

2597
02:15:35,341 --> 02:15:38,750
to get the bear and he had nine clause.
Wow.

2598
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:44,030
So he fricking through that to the side.
When in the cabin he licked the fricken

2599
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:49,740
oven clean,
but he could still smell that there's

2600
02:15:49,741 --> 02:15:53,400
like Greece somewhere inside there that
he like wanted to get to.

2601
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:59,000
So the whole fricken.
The whole stove was smashed about this

2602
02:16:00,211 --> 02:16:03,510
high off the ground,
so a couple inches a couple inches off

2603
02:16:03,511 --> 02:16:06,480
the ground.
He literally just got on it and squish

2604
02:16:06,481 --> 02:16:11,481
that fricking a fullblown stove just
like we would a pop can under our foot

2605
02:16:13,590 --> 02:16:17,940
to like squirt some extra grease up the
side of that big Oreo cookie that he

2606
02:16:17,941 --> 02:16:20,130
thought it was.
Oh my and licked it clean,

2607
02:16:20,131 --> 02:16:25,131
we'll it gets better.
So there was curtains over the sink and

2608
02:16:25,831 --> 02:16:29,380
the Cabinet and the curtains were all
gone.

2609
02:16:29,470 --> 02:16:31,060
And,
and um,

2610
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:34,300
the other thing too,
I think there was like there was two big

2611
02:16:34,301 --> 02:16:37,630
five gallon things of like cooking oil
that were in the camp.

2612
02:16:38,230 --> 02:16:43,230
So burt told me that there was like one
claw mark in the cooking oil and then

2613
02:16:43,421 --> 02:16:46,140
the fricken things like a Capri Sun,
he had freaked out,

2614
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:48,480
popped a hole in these five gallon
things,

2615
02:16:48,490 --> 02:16:52,210
a cooking oil and freaking squirt them
dry like a,

2616
02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:55,830
like an old capri sun through those to
the side we'll,

2617
02:16:55,831 --> 02:17:00,831
the curtains were gone to because burt
thinks because of cooking,

2618
02:17:01,450 --> 02:17:04,630
like the grease and crap that got on the
curtains.

2619
02:17:04,900 --> 02:17:07,960
He liked freaking they were gone.
Yeah.

2620
02:17:07,990 --> 02:17:09,910
Well at the time they didn't know.
They just,

2621
02:17:09,970 --> 02:17:12,970
you know,
I'm his wife Mary Jane was like,

2622
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:16,600
What happened to the curtains?
And he's like I have no idea.

2623
02:17:16,601 --> 02:17:20,110
But he had lived in there.
So I mean he had like piled the couch up

2624
02:17:20,111 --> 02:17:22,030
and I mean he like lived in that cabin.

2625
02:17:22,570 --> 02:17:25,900
Will there.
The bear did a full blown 10 foot

2626
02:17:25,930 --> 02:17:30,930
fricking grizzly mountain grizzly,
so then they went down to the next camp

2627
02:17:31,481 --> 02:17:34,210
which was 20 miles away and I didn't
tell you this part,

2628
02:17:34,570 --> 02:17:38,980
so they get in there and it's just an
absolute freaking wreck.

2629
02:17:38,981 --> 02:17:43,981
It looks like a life size mouse home,
just crap everywhere.

2630
02:17:46,210 --> 02:17:50,470
So Mary Jane's like cut a snow shovel
and she's like scooping all this

2631
02:17:50,471 --> 02:17:54,760
freaking shit off the ground and there
was all these like material

2632
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:59,800
dingleberry's in and she's like,
what are those dingleberry things?

2633
02:18:00,221 --> 02:18:03,670
And burt goes,
that's all the balls off the curtains

2634
02:18:03,671 --> 02:18:07,360
from Griz camp the frick and buried like
eight.

2635
02:18:07,361 --> 02:18:09,720
The curtains in the other camp.
Once he destroyed,

2636
02:18:09,730 --> 02:18:13,750
he kept walking down the road 20 miles
to the next brick and cabin.

2637
02:18:14,470 --> 02:18:18,010
Destroyed that one and freaking shit.
Only miles.

2638
02:18:18,060 --> 02:18:18,900
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

2639
02:18:18,901 --> 02:18:20,560
he was,
he was the king of the mountain.

2640
02:18:20,620 --> 02:18:22,510
Oh yeah.
They have a huge range,

2641
02:18:22,750 --> 02:18:23,620
but yeah,
he like,

2642
02:18:23,810 --> 02:18:28,450
you know,
fricking slung dingleberry juice and 10

2643
02:18:28,451 --> 02:18:31,060
gallons of fricking oil all across the
next can.

2644
02:18:31,061 --> 02:18:33,280
Just to prove a point might have been
kind of diarrhea.

2645
02:18:33,310 --> 02:18:38,310
Bear gets after 10 gallons of oil,
just drink oil and eat curtains was

2646
02:18:38,831 --> 02:18:42,670
probably about the same kind I get after
like six chicken mcnuggets.

2647
02:18:43,090 --> 02:18:45,460
It's hard out there for a bear to hard
world.

2648
02:18:45,490 --> 02:18:47,530
It is this a crazy animal.

2649
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:51,680
It's such a majestic.
We're super lucky that they're alive.

2650
02:18:51,681 --> 02:18:55,520
We're super lucky that they're around.
And that's the difference between,

2651
02:18:55,850 --> 02:18:56,830
I think,
um,

2652
02:18:57,350 --> 02:19:02,350
people who were like really hardcore
animal rights activists and people who

2653
02:19:03,111 --> 02:19:05,900
are wildlife biologists and
conservationists.

2654
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:10,340
They both agree that bears are amazing
and that's where I think that these

2655
02:19:10,341 --> 02:19:12,860
people are,
they have a misconception.

2656
02:19:12,861 --> 02:19:15,850
They think that hunter's want to kill
animals and they're,

2657
02:19:15,880 --> 02:19:19,880
they're vicious and they're mean and
cruel and they have little dicks and uh,

2658
02:19:19,910 --> 02:19:21,380
some of them do.
I'm sure.

2659
02:19:21,470 --> 02:19:25,080
I'm sure someone small for you if you
admitted that well,

2660
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:27,590
like small,
but you're a giant guy like six,

2661
02:19:27,610 --> 02:19:28,730
five.
It could be.

2662
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:31,100
That could be it.
Maybe it's just small compared to

2663
02:19:31,101 --> 02:19:33,020
everything else.
I hope so.

2664
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:34,870
I hope so too for you.
I mean,

2665
02:19:35,460 --> 02:19:37,820
you got to admit your problem if you're
going to move on,

2666
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:38,070
right?

2667
02:19:38,070 --> 02:19:41,270
So you get better at archery is how you
get better at dealing with your Dick.

2668
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:46,550
But this but both.
My point was that like both love bears.

2669
02:19:46,940 --> 02:19:47,810
Oh yeah.
They just,

2670
02:19:48,110 --> 02:19:50,930
they just don't want them to be a
problem.

2671
02:19:51,110 --> 02:19:53,540
So when you're looking at what this bear
did,

2672
02:19:53,541 --> 02:19:57,370
that cabin you said Woo.
Cam is in his name.

2673
02:19:57,430 --> 02:19:59,750
Rude.
So nothing's his neighborhood.

2674
02:19:59,780 --> 02:20:02,570
How about that?
I just said it that it's all.

2675
02:20:02,571 --> 02:20:05,510
If people live out there and the bear
comes in their house,

2676
02:20:05,511 --> 02:20:08,030
it's not that the bear came into his own
house,

2677
02:20:08,350 --> 02:20:11,650
it's a fucking person's house.
And if you don't think that way then

2678
02:20:11,651 --> 02:20:12,830
you're,
you're a problem.

2679
02:20:12,850 --> 02:20:16,250
You're your problem.
The bears are fucking bears.

2680
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:18,710
All right?
And if you don't differentiate the

2681
02:20:18,711 --> 02:20:19,750
difference between,
uh,

2682
02:20:19,950 --> 02:20:24,020
the value of a person and controlling
populations of bear,

2683
02:20:24,021 --> 02:20:25,880
well you're a ridiculous person.
You,

2684
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:27,500
you,
you're not looking at this thing

2685
02:20:27,501 --> 02:20:28,280
correctly.

2686
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:30,260
No one saying the bear should be wiped
out.

2687
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:32,480
But when you talk about an animal that
can,

2688
02:20:32,780 --> 02:20:34,880
from a stove,
flatness,

2689
02:20:34,881 --> 02:20:39,881
stove and pull a door out of the frame
with nine foot long spikes surround,

2690
02:20:41,981 --> 02:20:43,400
I mean nine inch,
nine inch,

2691
02:20:43,460 --> 02:20:45,690
nine foot.
How crazy that some kind of nails,

2692
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:47,910
nails,
nails as big as the band,

2693
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:51,380
nine inch long spikes.
You're talking about an insane animal

2694
02:20:51,381 --> 02:20:53,600
that if you don't control their
populations,

2695
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:55,580
they're going to decimate everything.
They're gonna.

2696
02:20:55,730 --> 02:20:58,520
They're gonna debt.
The only thing that's saving them is

2697
02:20:58,521 --> 02:21:00,350
them,
them eating cubs.

2698
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:02,600
That's the only thing that controls the
population of them.

2699
02:21:02,601 --> 02:21:03,520
If they're not,
if they're no.

2700
02:21:03,521 --> 02:21:03,790
Huh?

2701
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:05,260
Yeah.
The only thing controlling the

2702
02:21:05,261 --> 02:21:07,770
population is the food chain.
And you know,

2703
02:21:07,780 --> 02:21:10,390
I told you this the other day,
I,

2704
02:21:10,980 --> 02:21:15,980
I feel like as a hunter,
I love what I've got to witness as a

2705
02:21:16,181 --> 02:21:21,181
hunter because I feel like I've spent,
I've spent way more time enjoying the

2706
02:21:22,511 --> 02:21:26,080
creations of the wild because I've been
out there

2707
02:21:26,550 --> 02:21:27,690
really out there.
Yeah.

2708
02:21:27,691 --> 02:21:29,730
I'm like,
how else would you have gotten a chance

2709
02:21:29,731 --> 02:21:32,430
to see wolves in that environment that
you saw them?

2710
02:21:32,431 --> 02:21:34,430
I mean,
that's a confrontational.

2711
02:21:34,730 --> 02:21:35,210
Yeah.
Well,

2712
02:21:35,210 --> 02:21:36,390
I mean,
yeah,

2713
02:21:36,391 --> 02:21:40,230
I wouldn't prefer to be in the middle of
a freaking wolf attack to see them,

2714
02:21:40,770 --> 02:21:44,160
but you see things like I told you the
time we're like,

2715
02:21:44,490 --> 02:21:47,370
you know,
we're the time were a freaking bull

2716
02:21:47,371 --> 02:21:49,830
moose,
like probably about the size of the one

2717
02:21:49,831 --> 02:21:52,170
that you've got over there.
You know,

2718
02:21:52,171 --> 02:21:57,150
literally watched this fricking grizzly
square off to this bull Moose and hit

2719
02:21:57,151 --> 02:21:59,640
it.
The grizzly literally just hit the

2720
02:21:59,641 --> 02:22:03,690
fricken top back part of a full blown
Mousse and just broke it.

2721
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:06,680
And it's like dinnertime snapped.
It's back.

2722
02:22:06,690 --> 02:22:07,523
Yes.
Snapped it.

2723
02:22:07,550 --> 02:22:09,000
I mean,
just the sheer power.

2724
02:22:09,001 --> 02:22:11,130
Yeah.
Where was this up in BC.

2725
02:22:11,310 --> 02:22:12,630
Wow.
I mean,

2726
02:22:12,900 --> 02:22:15,090
you look,
how far away was it from you?

2727
02:22:15,750 --> 02:22:17,100
It was a ways off.
I mean,

2728
02:22:17,101 --> 02:22:20,520
it was like a binocular watch,
but still there's things like that.

2729
02:22:20,970 --> 02:22:22,700
There's things like,
you know,

2730
02:22:23,130 --> 02:22:27,840
you talked about how um,
the rivets up in Alberta where they have

2731
02:22:27,841 --> 02:22:28,950
the bear camp,
you know,

2732
02:22:28,951 --> 02:22:30,970
you saw like a boar.

2733
02:22:30,990 --> 02:22:34,530
Maybe they were telling you the story I
saw bore and the south fighting.

2734
02:22:34,531 --> 02:22:35,490
Okay.
Going at it.

2735
02:22:35,500 --> 02:22:36,390
Yeah.
Well,

2736
02:22:36,391 --> 02:22:40,410
I've seen,
and I told you this and I actually,

2737
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:45,500
I shot the bore,
but I spotted a big bear and a field and

2738
02:22:46,681 --> 02:22:51,681
I was hunting and it was spot and stalk
and as I'm starting to stock all sudden

2739
02:22:52,561 --> 02:22:56,880
the sow comes out and starts freaking
like posture and to the,

2740
02:22:57,180 --> 02:23:01,920
to the mail and then all heck broke
loose just like that.

2741
02:23:02,010 --> 02:23:04,830
That's what it was like.
And I mean I'm within 100 yards of it.

2742
02:23:04,831 --> 02:23:09,831
I mean it's ferociously loud.
And then after they like break up,

2743
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:14,250
the board goes running to this huge.
You've seen the timber up there,

2744
02:23:14,251 --> 02:23:16,800
the timbers gigantic.
Then a couple stories,

2745
02:23:16,801 --> 02:23:21,801
high fricking jumps on this tree and
starts going and I mean I'm talking like

2746
02:23:21,931 --> 02:23:23,340
full speed,
full speed.

2747
02:23:23,610 --> 02:23:27,900
I mean it's like if it's an incredible
chase and fight,

2748
02:23:28,320 --> 02:23:32,670
he freaking hits this tree and he's
fricking going up at like bark is just

2749
02:23:32,671 --> 02:23:37,410
ripping out and the,
the black female is going right behind

2750
02:23:37,411 --> 02:23:39,480
him.
And at the time I still didn't realize

2751
02:23:39,481 --> 02:23:43,350
what's up until I.
until he gets almost to the top and I

2752
02:23:43,351 --> 02:23:47,040
see two colored cubs up there and he's
free,

2753
02:23:47,070 --> 02:23:50,880
I mean like branches or coming off like
nothing is stopping.

2754
02:23:50,881 --> 02:23:54,600
This dude,
he's fricking going and right before he

2755
02:23:54,601 --> 02:23:59,130
gets to the cubs,
the frick and female launches and grabs

2756
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:04,280
the ham hock and just let's go the tree
and just fricking let's both of them and

2757
02:24:06,181 --> 02:24:10,270
let's the weight frick and bring them
down and just Ooh,

2758
02:24:10,490 --> 02:24:15,150
you hear like boom.
And then all heck breaks loose.

2759
02:24:15,210 --> 02:24:17,580
They go up into the timber and it's just
like,

2760
02:24:17,610 --> 02:24:19,710
you know,
a crazy fight.

2761
02:24:20,130 --> 02:24:24,330
We were in a similar situation when
there was a mother with her cubs and

2762
02:24:24,331 --> 02:24:27,420
then the board came in looking to kill
and eat the cubs.

2763
02:24:27,450 --> 02:24:28,380
Yep.
Oh yeah.

2764
02:24:28,440 --> 02:24:30,480
Yeah.
And we talked about there's argument to

2765
02:24:30,481 --> 02:24:33,580
why I haven't seen the evidence on,
you know,

2766
02:24:33,610 --> 02:24:38,610
you feel like it's just was Rinella said
that there's recent evidence that shows

2767
02:24:39,151 --> 02:24:43,590
that these bears are looking to eat
these things like almost immediately

2768
02:24:43,591 --> 02:24:46,230
when they come out of hibernate because
of ease of riot.

2769
02:24:46,290 --> 02:24:48,480
Yeah,
because they're just food I've,

2770
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:52,650
I personally think because they always
tend to be more aggressive on the cubs

2771
02:24:52,651 --> 02:24:57,651
from what I've experienced the further
into may then the rug,

2772
02:24:58,490 --> 02:25:00,150
right?
The closer you get to run,

2773
02:25:00,180 --> 02:25:02,070
the more likely,
you know,

2774
02:25:02,071 --> 02:25:05,340
I kinda think those boards might have
bred one or two styles.

2775
02:25:05,820 --> 02:25:10,260
They're Horny,
I mean so horny and then they,

2776
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:15,090
they're wanting another one and they
know that's the only thing that's going

2777
02:25:15,091 --> 02:25:18,540
to trigger to for them to come back in.
But I,

2778
02:25:18,550 --> 02:25:22,350
you know,
after that fight broke up in the sow,

2779
02:25:22,850 --> 02:25:25,690
she ended up standing guard.
She kind of called her cubs down and

2780
02:25:25,691 --> 02:25:30,190
they hauled will,
that big bore ended up coming out and he

2781
02:25:30,191 --> 02:25:30,780
was,
you know,

2782
02:25:30,780 --> 02:25:35,260
it was like a seven foot chocolate and
that's the one I got,

2783
02:25:35,710 --> 02:25:36,543
you know.
So,

2784
02:25:37,620 --> 02:25:38,890
you know,
some people might be like,

2785
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:40,780
oh,
he was trying to kill the babies and

2786
02:25:40,781 --> 02:25:42,760
then you know,
next thing you know,

2787
02:25:42,761 --> 02:25:46,920
I got it.
So I kind of feel like I did babies.

2788
02:25:47,370 --> 02:25:50,180
You're constantly definitely
conservationists in that

2789
02:25:50,420 --> 02:25:53,270
and that people also don't realize that
you eat bears too.

2790
02:25:53,300 --> 02:25:55,670
People have been eating bears forever
and it tastes good.

2791
02:25:55,910 --> 02:25:56,570
Yup.
You know,

2792
02:25:56,570 --> 02:25:59,570
they think the.
You only eat deer and elk and everything

2793
02:25:59,571 --> 02:26:01,070
else is trophy hunting,
you know?

2794
02:26:01,960 --> 02:26:02,793
Yeah.
It's,

2795
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:05,050
it's amazing.
To me the,

2796
02:26:05,110 --> 02:26:05,943
the,
the,

2797
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:08,170
just the beauties that I've seen,
I've been,

2798
02:26:08,290 --> 02:26:10,600
I've been,
I love sitting in a white tail stand and

2799
02:26:10,601 --> 02:26:15,601
I spent a lot of time in a white tail
stand just sitting quiet and you know,

2800
02:26:16,451 --> 02:26:20,950
for me it's,
it's like meditation because it is so

2801
02:26:20,951 --> 02:26:24,040
quiet at times.
There's like sometimes I've heard like

2802
02:26:24,100 --> 02:26:28,810
birds and noises where I'm like,
I've literally never ever hurt.

2803
02:26:28,811 --> 02:26:31,570
Like what is that?
Like I've never heard that.

2804
02:26:31,571 --> 02:26:34,090
And I.
One of the coolest things that I've

2805
02:26:34,091 --> 02:26:39,091
experienced is I've been in the timber
during the fall or there's just colors,

2806
02:26:41,150 --> 02:26:42,310
like,
like a painting,

2807
02:26:42,580 --> 02:26:43,720
just colors,
you know,

2808
02:26:43,721 --> 02:26:48,721
you know how it is in the Midwest and
there's days when like the first fall

2809
02:26:49,181 --> 02:26:54,181
snap really happens when I believe trees
just decided to let go.

2810
02:26:57,390 --> 02:26:59,650
I did.
Have you ever watched any of the Harry

2811
02:26:59,650 --> 02:27:03,580
Potter movies you ever see that move?
That tree that just like fricking cleans

2812
02:27:03,581 --> 02:27:06,400
itself off and then all of a sudden he
just decides,

2813
02:27:06,940 --> 02:27:09,670
well,
I've been in the timber where it was

2814
02:27:09,671 --> 02:27:14,290
like the trees are almost communicating
and everyone just said let go.

2815
02:27:14,291 --> 02:27:18,730
And literally the like someone just
moved a fresh canvas,

2816
02:27:19,030 --> 02:27:24,030
just all the colors of fall just let go
and you literally watched the whole

2817
02:27:25,870 --> 02:27:29,200
color of fall go to the ground and it's
bare

2818
02:27:30,270 --> 02:27:32,760
who can say they've seen that?
Pretty rare.

2819
02:27:33,630 --> 02:27:36,810
It is amazing to see these cycles of
nature,

2820
02:27:36,900 --> 02:27:39,660
the see them in person and I think
that's one of the things that a lot of

2821
02:27:39,661 --> 02:27:43,830
people are missing by living in cities.
There's a lot of really cool shit that

2822
02:27:43,831 --> 02:27:46,740
you could see out in the woods.
There's so much.

2823
02:27:46,770 --> 02:27:51,770
So much of it is just like inherently
fascinating or like it appeals to us

2824
02:27:52,890 --> 02:27:56,220
some sort of a primal way.
You remember that Squirrel I sent you

2825
02:27:56,221 --> 02:27:57,380
the other day?
Yeah,

2826
02:27:57,910 --> 02:27:59,150
I got.

2827
02:27:59,570 --> 02:28:00,590
Yeah,
that was crazy.

2828
02:28:00,591 --> 02:28:04,760
I mean,
I was out for a little walk and I came

2829
02:28:04,761 --> 02:28:08,150
across a really nice buck and awesome
buck,

2830
02:28:08,370 --> 02:28:13,370
literally dead and eaten by coyotes and
it was a deer that I know was,

2831
02:28:15,290 --> 02:28:17,210
you know,
I'd seen earlier in the season and it

2832
02:28:17,211 --> 02:28:22,010
was perfectly healthy and next thing I
know a month later here it is dead.

2833
02:28:22,490 --> 02:28:25,610
Just a decade carcass eaten.
What do you think happened?

2834
02:28:25,611 --> 02:28:28,820
You think the coyote is captured it?
Are you tired from the Rut?

2835
02:28:28,850 --> 02:28:30,380
It's hard to say.
I think,

2836
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:33,200
you know,
I think with any type of animal,

2837
02:28:33,201 --> 02:28:37,700
especially when the males have such a
limited time to breed,

2838
02:28:37,701 --> 02:28:40,190
they've really exert themselves.
I mean it's like,

2839
02:28:40,700 --> 02:28:44,300
it's like looking.
I've seen books that literally look

2840
02:28:44,301 --> 02:28:45,134
like,

2841
02:28:45,410 --> 02:28:47,870
like that.
You got that fighter that fought Kimbo

2842
02:28:47,871 --> 02:28:48,740
or whatever,
you know,

2843
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:51,140
$5,000.
I literally seen them,

2844
02:28:51,470 --> 02:28:56,470
I've seen them walking in there like a
fricking fully skins Zombie just because

2845
02:28:59,211 --> 02:29:01,730
they've just been running.
They came too much.

2846
02:29:01,770 --> 02:29:02,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

2847
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:05,340
They don't look like that a few times I
heard

2848
02:29:07,090 --> 02:29:08,080
you get,
you get,

2849
02:29:08,330 --> 02:29:09,163
you get tired,
man.

2850
02:29:09,230 --> 02:29:12,770
Yeah.
And I think when they get that run down,

2851
02:29:12,771 --> 02:29:15,170
it's no different than me when I'm
traveling a lot,

2852
02:29:15,171 --> 02:29:19,670
especially when I'm skipping time zones
and I really have a hard time getting

2853
02:29:19,671 --> 02:29:22,280
into a sleep pattern and a recovery
pattern.

2854
02:29:22,760 --> 02:29:25,070
You just get sick,
you get the flu,

2855
02:29:25,130 --> 02:29:26,360
you know,
you get the flu,

2856
02:29:26,361 --> 02:29:30,230
you get some fricking stupid little bug
that's on an airplane from some guy like

2857
02:29:30,231 --> 02:29:32,540
three seats over that's coughing,
you know,

2858
02:29:32,541 --> 02:29:36,530
I think he just where your immune system
down and you're vulnerable.

2859
02:29:36,770 --> 02:29:41,000
And then when winter comes in and it's,
it's a fricking,

2860
02:29:41,230 --> 02:29:42,320
you know,
it's tough on.

2861
02:29:42,321 --> 02:29:45,080
So they don't eat for days sometimes.
Oh yeah.

2862
02:29:45,110 --> 02:29:47,060
Days.
I remember it after it.

2863
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:50,270
I saw a book one time.
He was just,

2864
02:29:50,420 --> 02:29:54,560
I mean I see him like as far as I could
see with the binoculars over here.

2865
02:29:54,561 --> 02:29:55,420
And then I,
you know,

2866
02:29:55,550 --> 02:29:58,820
30 minutes later it seem as far as I
could see with binoculars go through

2867
02:29:58,821 --> 02:30:02,810
this creek bottom in this creek bottom.
And I was actually sitting on this like

2868
02:30:02,990 --> 02:30:07,990
Pond Dam and about 11 in the morning.
Here he comes.

2869
02:30:08,061 --> 02:30:09,140
He's just like,
fricking,

2870
02:30:09,350 --> 02:30:14,350
he's just walking with the Zombie walk,
like he's trying to find a scent trail

2871
02:30:14,601 --> 02:30:19,220
of a dough that's in estrus and he's
just been breeding for weeks and I

2872
02:30:19,221 --> 02:30:24,110
remember he was just freaking comment in
any literally just comes running any

2873
02:30:24,111 --> 02:30:29,111
hits the pond and he's sitting in the
pond like with just as head sitting out

2874
02:30:30,530 --> 02:30:35,530
and he's like,
and then he comes up out and he's just

2875
02:30:38,231 --> 02:30:39,280
like,
he goes like

2876
02:30:43,890 --> 02:30:47,010
shakes and he's gone again.
It's just like,

2877
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:50,820
holy crap,
this poor dude is just like running this

2878
02:30:50,821 --> 02:30:55,680
like marathon of the Rut and well
there's so much competition.

2879
02:30:55,710 --> 02:30:58,680
Oh yes.
Well that's part of what ramps them all

2880
02:30:58,681 --> 02:31:00,390
up.
This is so many other deer there.

2881
02:31:00,420 --> 02:31:01,380
Yeah,
yeah.

2882
02:31:01,381 --> 02:31:02,220
I mean,
and it's,

2883
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,710
you know,
so to watch so many die that way.

2884
02:31:04,711 --> 02:31:08,580
Well I found that,
but that buck that day and then

2885
02:31:09,630 --> 02:31:12,060
two minutes later I'm walking through
the forest like,

2886
02:31:12,090 --> 02:31:13,800
oh,
here's a cute little squirrel.

2887
02:31:14,130 --> 02:31:16,230
You know,
I see this girl like any,

2888
02:31:16,250 --> 02:31:19,560
like Kinda like,
he's like looking at me on side of this

2889
02:31:19,561 --> 02:31:20,394
tree.
Like,

2890
02:31:20,490 --> 02:31:25,490
is this person going to hurt me?
And all of a sudden like fricking boom,

2891
02:31:25,711 --> 02:31:29,040
this like red tail hawk,
just fricking pounds of this thing.

2892
02:31:29,041 --> 02:31:31,680
And I'm like looking around like,
what the heck?

2893
02:31:31,681 --> 02:31:36,180
And then the Hawk looks at me and starts
to fly and then drops a squirrel and I.

2894
02:31:36,390 --> 02:31:38,940
and that's the.
I went over and here's this girl with

2895
02:31:38,941 --> 02:31:43,941
like to talent marks one through.
It's either through its mouth and one

2896
02:31:44,401 --> 02:31:46,800
like.
Did you put that picture on?

2897
02:31:46,940 --> 02:31:47,580
No,
I can,

2898
02:31:47,580 --> 02:31:51,240
I can send it to Jamie though if you put
it on your instagram page because crazy

2899
02:31:51,241 --> 02:31:52,074
picture.
Yeah.

2900
02:31:52,350 --> 02:31:54,050
It's a weird thing to see.
Yeah,

2901
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:54,901
it's,
you know,

2902
02:31:54,901 --> 02:31:59,730
nature's nature is interesting,
but it's,

2903
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:01,230
you know,
I'm a conservationist.

2904
02:32:01,230 --> 02:32:03,480
I'm a,
I'm a huge supporter to the boone and

2905
02:32:03,481 --> 02:32:04,710
Crockett club.
I've,

2906
02:32:04,770 --> 02:32:06,610
you know,
I've uh,

2907
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:08,640
you know,
really tried to become,

2908
02:32:08,850 --> 02:32:09,683
you know,
I've,

2909
02:32:09,900 --> 02:32:14,190
I've done what it takes to become a
professional member now of the Boone and

2910
02:32:14,191 --> 02:32:18,540
Crockett club and you know,
I'm really focused on trying to give

2911
02:32:18,541 --> 02:32:23,220
more back on the conservation side
because there are so many important

2912
02:32:23,221 --> 02:32:28,170
things that these organizations do for
wildlife.

2913
02:32:28,171 --> 02:32:30,480
As much as people want to say they,
you know,

2914
02:32:31,620 --> 02:32:32,291
I've,
I've,

2915
02:32:32,291 --> 02:32:36,930
I've just never seen an,
an anti hunting community

2916
02:32:38,970 --> 02:32:43,970
come anywhere where I'm at and put in
time establishing habitat and actually

2917
02:32:46,561 --> 02:32:50,850
doing things that grow the population
and you know,

2918
02:32:51,750 --> 02:32:56,750
I plant food and I probably leave 5,000
bucks a year worth of food in my dirt to

2919
02:32:56,881 --> 02:33:01,580
like help grow deer and like help my
dear,

2920
02:33:01,980 --> 02:33:03,430
don't,
don't you think though that there's a

2921
02:33:03,431 --> 02:33:06,370
lot of people that have opinions about,
uh,

2922
02:33:06,371 --> 02:33:11,290
about animals and about wildlife that
really spend very little time with

2923
02:33:11,291 --> 02:33:15,610
animals and in wildlife they have this
very convenient idea.

2924
02:33:15,770 --> 02:33:16,870
Like,
like when I,

2925
02:33:16,940 --> 02:33:20,290
I told a friend of mine the number,
the more we discussed on the podcast

2926
02:33:20,291 --> 02:33:24,460
earlier about Michigan having 50,000 car
accidents a year and he was like,

2927
02:33:24,461 --> 02:33:25,630
you're lying.
I'm like,

2928
02:33:25,690 --> 02:33:26,560
dude,
Google it.

2929
02:33:26,860 --> 02:33:30,030
And he looked at it and he just sat,
like literally looked at his phone and

2930
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:31,450
sat like,
plop down.

2931
02:33:31,451 --> 02:33:32,860
Holy Shit.
I go,

2932
02:33:33,250 --> 02:33:36,020
you're not there.
If you're there you would know like

2933
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:39,640
it's,
it's overwhelming because his opinion or

2934
02:33:39,641 --> 02:33:43,360
his point of view was that these hunters
are just these people that are just

2935
02:33:43,361 --> 02:33:47,950
assholes that liked to shoot animals,
like they do need to do this,

2936
02:33:48,010 --> 02:33:51,340
like they need to do this and you might
not think it,

2937
02:33:51,700 --> 02:33:53,080
but you just.
No Way.

2938
02:33:53,081 --> 02:33:56,620
You have a survey of the whole world or
the whole country.

2939
02:33:56,621 --> 02:33:58,330
You just don't.
And if you did,

2940
02:33:58,331 --> 02:33:59,400
I bet you'd have a different pace.

2941
02:33:59,580 --> 02:34:03,300
Have you seen some of the numbers,
like what allstate insurance posts about

2942
02:34:03,301 --> 02:34:08,301
how many vehicle deaths and like dollars
and vehicle collisions are,

2943
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:14,610
are just with white tail deer with one
insurance company?

2944
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:16,740
Let's find out.
I have it on my laptop.

2945
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:18,340
If you want me to grab Jamie could pull
it up.

2946
02:34:18,341 --> 02:34:20,180
I'm sure it's on Google.
It just google.

2947
02:34:20,390 --> 02:34:24,080
How many car accidents involve dear
nationwide?

2948
02:34:24,130 --> 02:34:28,020
Yup.
I bet if Michigan has 50,000.

2949
02:34:28,021 --> 02:34:28,120
Yeah,

2950
02:34:28,120 --> 02:34:32,560
mind blowing the even the number of
deaths would is

2951
02:34:33,100 --> 02:34:35,980
well in campaigns is hometown.
Some guy just died,

2952
02:34:36,490 --> 02:34:40,420
some guy hit a deer and then the guy in
front of them died because.

2953
02:34:40,590 --> 02:34:43,180
Or the guy behind him,
the guy hit a deer when flying through

2954
02:34:43,181 --> 02:34:47,140
the air,
175 to 200 fatalities every year and

2955
02:34:47,141 --> 02:34:50,950
10,000 injuries.
There's approximately one point 5

2956
02:34:50,950 --> 02:34:53,230
million deer related car accidents
annually.

2957
02:34:53,470 --> 02:34:58,470
I'm going to say that again.
There are one point 5 million deer

2958
02:34:58,511 --> 02:35:02,950
related car accidents annually.
You didn't know that,

2959
02:35:02,951 --> 02:35:03,880
did you?
Nope.

2960
02:35:03,940 --> 02:35:08,940
Over $1,000,000,000 in vehicle damage
and 175 to 200 fate totalities as well

2961
02:35:11,561 --> 02:35:13,210
as 10,000 injuries.

2962
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:16,350
Oh my God.
And

2963
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:20,680
200 deaths in 2012,
it said 200 deaths.

2964
02:35:20,710 --> 02:35:21,770
$4,000,000,000

2965
02:35:21,940 --> 02:35:22,773
year.
Yup.

2966
02:35:22,920 --> 02:35:25,030
Fucking Christ.
Exactly.

2967
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:29,430
And a lot of people don't know that the
continent is large and that.

2968
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:31,710
You know what?
Let me ask you this.

2969
02:35:31,711 --> 02:35:32,880
It's funny.
People,

2970
02:35:33,480 --> 02:35:37,650
people whine and cry about how much
insurance goes up.

2971
02:35:38,370 --> 02:35:41,570
How much do you think it would go up if
we didn't help that?

2972
02:35:42,570 --> 02:35:43,530
Well also

2973
02:35:43,830 --> 02:35:47,280
does that have about health insurance?
Because it ticks and lyme lyme disease.

2974
02:35:47,380 --> 02:35:48,820
Oh yeah.
There was this end.

2975
02:35:48,821 --> 02:35:51,610
Just your injuries.
More people going in for hitting one.

2976
02:35:51,611 --> 02:35:52,480
Yeah,
absolutely.

2977
02:35:52,510 --> 02:35:55,060
My Dad,
my dad actually,

2978
02:35:55,450 --> 02:35:59,350
he,
he always wanted to have his teeth

2979
02:35:59,410 --> 02:36:04,410
perfect and I remember he wore braces
for a long time to get his teeth fixed

2980
02:36:07,390 --> 02:36:12,390
and like no sooner than he had them done
and was wearing a retainer and my dad's

2981
02:36:13,481 --> 02:36:15,340
like,
he's got a truck at home,

2982
02:36:15,341 --> 02:36:17,770
like a big truck,
but he never drives it because he

2983
02:36:17,771 --> 02:36:18,670
always,
he liked,

2984
02:36:18,671 --> 02:36:22,060
drove a little bitty Honda and fricking
hit a deer.

2985
02:36:22,061 --> 02:36:27,061
He hit a buck like a month after getting
like finally the dentist saying,

2986
02:36:27,721 --> 02:36:31,090
you don't have to wear your retainer.
He hit a buck.

2987
02:36:31,630 --> 02:36:36,630
The horns stuck through his windshield
and the horn stopped on a steering wheel

2988
02:36:38,200 --> 02:36:41,050
and the body came in and hit him in the
face.

2989
02:36:41,170 --> 02:36:43,330
Oh my God.
And he had to like get.

2990
02:36:43,570 --> 02:36:47,350
He literally is fake teeth in the front.
Wow.

2991
02:36:47,700 --> 02:36:49,750
Ha.
So

2992
02:36:51,520 --> 02:36:53,720
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

2993
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:57,100
I had no idea that one point $5 million
I told you.

2994
02:36:57,330 --> 02:37:00,310
That's crazy.
That's a way better statistic.

2995
02:37:00,550 --> 02:37:01,810
50,000 in Michigan.
Yeah.

2996
02:37:01,811 --> 02:37:03,430
That's nothing.
I mean,

2997
02:37:03,480 --> 02:37:04,570
I mean,
well wow,

2998
02:37:04,571 --> 02:37:07,000
that's a lot.
It's a lot.

2999
02:37:07,001 --> 02:37:09,940
But in the,
in the whole scheme of things,

3000
02:37:09,941 --> 02:37:10,960
you know,
my wife,

3001
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:13,910
my wife's from Rangeland,
um,

3002
02:37:14,170 --> 02:37:17,990
and she had never hunted her family,
never have.

3003
02:37:18,020 --> 02:37:18,711
I mean,
they're just,

3004
02:37:18,711 --> 02:37:20,780
they have no idea about that stuff.
It's,

3005
02:37:20,870 --> 02:37:21,610
you know,
they,

3006
02:37:21,610 --> 02:37:23,870
they have no relation to hunting.
Right.

3007
02:37:24,530 --> 02:37:27,680
So when she came over,
she was,

3008
02:37:28,150 --> 02:37:30,440
you know,
she knew I hunted and she was open

3009
02:37:30,441 --> 02:37:33,860
minded to it because I,
I showed her numbers like this.

3010
02:37:34,040 --> 02:37:35,090
I said,
okay,

3011
02:37:35,660 --> 02:37:39,740
I understand you don't understand it,
so let's talk about some of this stuff.

3012
02:37:39,741 --> 02:37:43,850
Do you realize this?
Do you know that at our house if you

3013
02:37:43,851 --> 02:37:46,880
drive around,
you're gonna see a deer from your car,

3014
02:37:46,881 --> 02:37:51,881
like almost anytime you're driving
around our area after dark or waiting to

3015
02:37:52,570 --> 02:37:55,730
see how many dead deer on the side of
the road during the first three weeks in

3016
02:37:55,731 --> 02:37:58,010
November,
driving down the highway in Iowa.

3017
02:37:58,100 --> 02:38:01,910
You know what I mean?
So she kept an open mind and she

3018
02:38:01,911 --> 02:38:05,450
realized really quick.
We couldn't grow a garden,

3019
02:38:06,130 --> 02:38:08,010
you know,
in Wisconsin,

3020
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:10,580
they were like eaten us all the time.
I mean,

3021
02:38:10,581 --> 02:38:12,740
they were everywhere and she's just
like,

3022
02:38:12,741 --> 02:38:13,940
you know what,
I get it.

3023
02:38:14,270 --> 02:38:18,530
I never saw this.
I didn't see this much stuff in in

3024
02:38:18,570 --> 02:38:20,060
England.
We didn't have it.

3025
02:38:20,061 --> 02:38:24,410
That's why we weren't hunting there.
It's not because people aren't

3026
02:38:24,411 --> 02:38:29,150
necessarily hunters.
It wasn't in some areas it isn't a

3027
02:38:29,151 --> 02:38:33,380
needed conservation.
It is here.

3028
02:38:33,440 --> 02:38:34,400
That's the reality.

3029
02:38:34,680 --> 02:38:39,680
Imagine if you could see all one point
$5 million car accidents in like a scene

3030
02:38:41,430 --> 02:38:43,050
one after the other.
Bang,

3031
02:38:43,350 --> 02:38:44,010
Bang,
Bang,

3032
02:38:44,010 --> 02:38:44,750
Bang,
Bang.

3033
02:38:44,750 --> 02:38:46,650
Because you've got to think there's
three and 65 days.

3034
02:38:46,660 --> 02:38:49,320
Use Twenty four days in a 24 hours in a
day.

3035
02:38:49,710 --> 02:38:54,710
So if you could look at all the footage
that's accumulated every year in one

3036
02:38:56,191 --> 02:38:59,850
giant loop,
the highlight reel of car accidents,

3037
02:38:59,880 --> 02:39:02,040
you couldn't watch it in a year.
Well you couldn't.

3038
02:39:02,220 --> 02:39:04,980
Well you would watch two people die.
Two or 200 people die too,

3039
02:39:05,220 --> 02:39:09,840
but just the sheer volume would kind of
wake people up.

3040
02:39:10,110 --> 02:39:15,110
If you could watch the sheer volume.
If they put together a movie that was

3041
02:39:15,181 --> 02:39:18,600
three hours long,
that was just all the car accidents in

3042
02:39:18,601 --> 02:39:21,210
the last six months with deere,
people would go,

3043
02:39:21,270 --> 02:39:22,680
oh my God,
we're at war.

3044
02:39:22,890 --> 02:39:24,690
We're at war,
and they're attacking cars.

3045
02:39:24,870 --> 02:39:29,010
They're literally suicide bombing cars
to jumping out in the street and taking

3046
02:39:29,011 --> 02:39:29,750
out drivers.

3047
02:39:29,750 --> 02:39:31,730
Well,
for over three hours you would see

3048
02:39:31,731 --> 02:39:33,700
someone die every minute.
Yeah.

3049
02:39:33,890 --> 02:39:34,770
In that compile.

3050
02:39:35,170 --> 02:39:36,370
Yeah.
You just see boom,

3051
02:39:36,400 --> 02:39:37,330
boom,
boom,

3052
02:39:37,360 --> 02:39:40,660
boom,
smash hook to the face of antlers to the

3053
02:39:40,661 --> 02:39:42,880
neck.
It was over and over and over again.

3054
02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:44,990
You'd have a lot more candidates for
that.

3055
02:39:44,991 --> 02:39:47,540
LSD.
A trial for.

3056
02:39:47,541 --> 02:39:49,780
I mean there'd be some serious
traumatic.

3057
02:39:50,090 --> 02:39:51,190
Sorry.
Mgma.

3058
02:39:51,690 --> 02:39:53,480
MGMA trial.
Yeah.

3059
02:39:53,550 --> 02:39:55,810
That would flip people over in the end.
Listen,

3060
02:39:55,811 --> 02:39:57,550
we gotta get the fuck out of here.
It's 4:00.

3061
02:39:57,580 --> 02:39:59,770
Oh yeah,
you did the shoot and just we just bang

3062
02:39:59,771 --> 02:40:01,560
through three hours.
How about this buddy?

3063
02:40:01,990 --> 02:40:03,700
Thanks Jamie.
Thanks for coming down here and thank

man.

3065
02:40:05,291 --> 02:40:08,020

I've learned so much from you and

3066
02:40:08,021 --> 02:40:10,450

3067
