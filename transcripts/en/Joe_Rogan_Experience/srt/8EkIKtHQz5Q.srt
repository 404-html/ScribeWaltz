00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,880
Four,
three,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,830
two,
one.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,630
Hello,
Michael.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,400
Welcome.
Thanks man.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,720
Thanks for doing this.
Thanks for coming in.

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,500
One hundred percent,
man.

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,710
People don't know the story.
Will Give them the brief synopsis.

8
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:18,711
I found out about your story online 
because there was this viral thing that 

9
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:22,251
was going on about a chef who was 
getting protested by a bunch of animal 

10
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:26,931
rights activists and Vegans who decided 
to camp out in front of your business 

11
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:31,350
and try to a restaurant called antler 
and Toronto try to.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,360
I don't know what the fuck they were 
trying to do,

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,570
but you decided to butcher a a leg of 
deer in front of them and it became this

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,380
horrific thing like how could you do 
that and a place that serves meat.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,500
How could you prepare the meat right in 
front of them?

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,650
Like how did this all get started?
How did it become such a crazy viral 

17
00:00:55,771 --> 00:01:00,771
story and why?
Why were they mad at you when there's a 

18
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:01,230
million other restaurants around you?
All right,

19
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:06,231
so it started in about December of a 
clue.

20
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:08,240
Number one,
Canadian,

21
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,150
the crazy Canadian besides being nice,
but that's why

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,970
viral,
because I wasn't being nice.

23
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:16,640
I wasn't the stereotypical Canadian.
No,

24
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,940
you weren't even being mean.
You're just doing your job and doing my 

25
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,731
thing.
So they started in December and they 

26
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:26,840
really is right in front of your face.
They really got pissed off with our.

27
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:28,610
We have a little chalkboard sign out 
front.

28
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,280
Um,
I'll give you the,

29
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,750
we have a 45 seat restaurant,
so we're a small,

30
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,020
uh,
have one business partner who's a,

31
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,090
my best friend and family friend.
And we had a little chalkboard sign out 

32
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,850
front that said Venison is the new Kale 
and you know,

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,920
we get cute with our sign.
We tease other restaurants around us 

34
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:46,920
like we have fun with the sign and it's 
fun.

35
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:52,330
And the cyclist Vegan rode by and took 
huge offense to our sign and all of a 

36
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,810
sudden one day these protesters just 
showed up.

37
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,840
So I'm originally,
I was just kind of frustrated because 

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,040
they're totally misguided because um,
we take a lot of pride in where our food

39
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:11,291
comes from.
We have Vegan and vegetarian dishes on 

40
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,430
the menu.
And I really respect that type of diet,

41
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,180
so we were just totally floored with why
this was happening.

42
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,330
And so they started going,
they'd started come every week and they 

43
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,990
went from like two or three people being
kind of peaceful to being like 10,

44
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:28,820
15 people,
not so peaceful.

45
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,480
So a is when it turned not so peaceful.
They were shouting at our,

46
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:37,010
at our guests and shouting in our door 
and really trying to harm our business.

47
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:37,610
That,
uh,

48
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,830
I just kind of got fed up.
Last resort,

49
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,280
went down,
we get a whole deer a couple times a 

50
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,280
month and we,
we butchered ourselves.

51
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,160
And uh,
I just said,

52
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:46,790
screw it,
screw it.

53
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,050
I'm like,
I'm going to get these people to get out

54
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:50,480
of here.
So I thought that that would

55
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,250
make them go away.
How did you think that was going to make

56
00:02:54,251 --> 00:02:55,600
them go away and not escalate it?

57
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,170
Uh,
I don't know.

58
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:59,440
I was,
it was just totally like last resort,

59
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,310
a totally

60
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,660
fed up.
Um,

61
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,790
I wanted to defend myself,
defend our customers,

62
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:08,791
you know,
you could see people walking in visibly 

63
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:08,791
upset,
um,

64
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,950
you know,
they're being shouted at being screamed 

65
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,731
at,
called a murderer as they're walking in 

66
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:14,731
for dinner,
like you're going on a date,

67
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:15,580
you want to have this time and then 
people are screaming at you,

68
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,060
uh,
you know,

69
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,580
just for eating.
So,

70
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,790
uh,
I was just fed up and I just kinda 

71
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:23,790
thought like,
you know,

72
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,730
buzz off and why.
So just one sign once I send is the new 

73
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:31,170
Kale one sign set this whole thing off.
Yeah.

74
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,480
And you're surrounded by restaurants.
I mean,

75
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,310
I know where you are.
So we're surrounded by restaurants until

76
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,150
there's an actual butcher shop across 
the street and if you go in,

77
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,820
there's like whole cattle hanging.
That's okay.

78
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:45,940
And the butcher shop,
you're a problem with your comparison to

79
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:46,240
Kale.

80
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,240
You attack their sacred tail.
We're promoting a meet.

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,680
I don't know,
that's really bizarre because you are 

82
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:56,680
promoting and we were promoting it or 
uh,

83
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,560
yeah.
So I just didn't promote anything and 

84
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,030
they were allowed to cycle by and dream 
of Broccoli without interference.

85
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,770
Yeah.
Man,

86
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,270
I have no idea.
It's totally bizarre.

87
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,100
I'm sorry,
how many times did they protest you?

88
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,710
Um,
I think it's about eight now.

89
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,090
Eight.
They're coming in weekly.

90
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,590
They still do.
They still do.

91
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:16,490
There's one this Friday.
Oh Jesus.

92
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:18,400
So they organize,
they organize them.

93
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,470
There's like facebook groups,
there's a,

94
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,480
they're basically giving us an 
ultimatum.

95
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:26,470
We have to put their slogan in our 
window and they'll go away.

96
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,740
But yeah,
what's their slogan?

97
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,840
Um,
there's,

98
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,700
there's like,
I can't remember it word for word,

99
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:37,160
but it's,
you know,

100
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,410
like killing animals is wrong and they 
have feelings while.

101
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:40,700
Yeah.

102
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,580
Do you have to put that in your window?
We don't,

103
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,680
we're not going to.
There's no way they want.

104
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,470
That's what they want.
Yeah.

105
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,910
So eco terrorism,
extortion,

106
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,680
wherever you want to call it.
Wow.

107
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,360
Well,
the part,

108
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,930
the part of this that drives you the 
most crazy is the fact that you're 

109
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,580
surrounded by restaurant.
We're surrounded by restaurants you're 

110
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:02,580
surrounded by,
like you said,

111
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,760
you're across cross street from a 
butcher shop.

112
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,050
90 seven percent of the people in the 
world eat meat.

113
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,420
It's something,
something crazy like that.

114
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:15,450
I mean,
I'm sure everyone hasn't really been 

115
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:15,450
pulled.
I'm sure it's not that accurate,

116
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,040
but it's somewhere between 95 and $97.
It's big.

117
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,140
It's big.
And I think we know we're an easy 

118
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,140
target,
you know,

119
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,840
her name is antler.
We were,

120
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:25,440
I think they're mad because,
um,

121
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,290
you know,
their,

122
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,300
their thing is that we're promoting 
ethical farming and their beliefs is 

123
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,570
there is no such thing as ethical 
farming that all meat is murder.

124
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,010
And um,
you know,

125
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:38,380
if you look up murder in the dictionary,
it has to do with humans,

126
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,000
you know,
it has nothing to do with animals.

127
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,180
And um,
there is such a thing as ethical farming

128
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:48,181
and sustainable farming and we work 
really hard to make sure that where we 

129
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:48,790
get our meat from,
his,

130
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:53,791
uh,
from the best possible place we can and 

131
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,941
it's local.
So it's supporting our local farmers 

132
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:57,320
that are within hours of our restaurant.
Now,

133
00:05:57,321 --> 00:06:02,321
when you say that they started out nice 
like how many people were there in the 

134
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:02,321
beginning?
Two,

135
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,200
three,
four.

136
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,380
And they had signs and they were just 
kind of,

137
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,970
you know,
promoting their message,

138
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:11,210
but they weren't really yelling and 
screaming and what escalated it.

139
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,670
Um,
so we would call the police.

140
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:16,070
We kind of got wind of it on their 
facebook groups,

141
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:21,071
so we would call the police and have the
police there to make sure everyone's 

142
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:21,200
safe because one thing like customers 
are scared,

143
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,310
our staffers scared.

144
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,320
Like,
no one's dealt with this before.

145
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:26,120
I've never dealt with this before.
Um,

146
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,080
so we would have the police there they 
were,

147
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,440
the police were amazing.
Um,

148
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,670
and then one time we kind of,
okay,

149
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:36,250
let's not call the police,
let's see what happens.

150
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,700
Maybe it'll just,
they'll go away.

151
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,540
And so then like a megaphone came out,
uh,

152
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,270
our neighbors were coming down and 
getting in fights with them.

153
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,290
And it was,
it was ugly.

154
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,800
So we called the police to come and 
Jesus Christ keeps the peace.

155
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,270
Yeah.
A megaphone.

156
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,570
Yeah.
Part of the problem with these kinds of 

157
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,960
things is it becomes a contest,
becomes a battle,

158
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,970
you know,
trying to see who's gonna win.

159
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,690
And they're absolutely on a team.
I mean,

160
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,700
this,
that's one of the things that happens 

161
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:07,760
with veganism and I think it happens 
with hunters to,

162
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,910
excuse me,
people become very tribal,

163
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,260
you know,
and you know,

164
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:17,261
it's us versus them and they want to win
and then it becomes this thing where,

165
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,950
you know,
look,

166
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,160
the reality is a lot of people are 
idiots and they don't have a lot going 

167
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,890
on in their life.

168
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,940
And so when something comes up where it 
becomes a primary focus of their life,

169
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,180
one restaurant is a logical is,
it might be that becomes the battle 

170
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,600
ground and it's an ideological battle 
ground for,

171
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:40,601
you know,
don't eat meat ever versus sustainable 

172
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:41,300
farming.
You know,

173
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,370
this the look,
I'm sure,

174
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:48,371
I know you're a hunter,
I'm sure you feel a certain amount of 

175
00:07:48,371 --> 00:07:50,450
remorse when an animal dies a hundred 
percent.

176
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,690
That's a big part of sort of my beliefs 
and my philosophy and why I'm working on

177
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,170
this cookbook right now is because,
uh,

178
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,850
I think that if you do eat meat,
you should be able to kill an animal and

179
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:02,900
experience that.
And I,

180
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:05,960
I think that if people were to actually 
kill an animal,

181
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,700
they would see,
you know,

182
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,700
what goes into that and I don't think 
people would consume as much,

183
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:12,470
meaning I don't think people would 
definitely,

184
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,860
certainly wouldn't waste as much meat as
they do and it's just really upsetting.

185
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,300
And I think it's totally misguided.
You know,

186
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:23,030
why we were targeted.
Well,

187
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,230
I mean,
like I said,

188
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:25,630
I think it just becomes a game.
Yeah.

189
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,730
It becomes a big tribal game.
You know,

190
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,580
there's,
there's a real argument,

191
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:36,590
a real argument that I support against 
factory farming and factory farming is 

192
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:41,351
the way most people are getting their 
meat in terms of like in terms of like 

193
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,300
cheeseburgers and fast food and stuff 
along those lines.

194
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,710
I mean,
you're not getting it from the most 

195
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,510
ethical sources.
It's just not financially sustainable to

196
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:52,880
do it that way.
Everything would cost more money.

197
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,020
Yep.
And,

198
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,040
uh,
that's a real.

199
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,210
That we,
as a society,

200
00:08:57,211 --> 00:09:00,450
it's not obviously not you or I that set
up the system,

201
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,380
but that this system is a system that we
find ourselves a part of.

202
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,100
It's a real problem.
I've removed myself from it for the most

203
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:10,680
part,
but occasionally I'm on the road and I'm

204
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:12,660
hungry and you know,
I'll eat some meat.

205
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,730
That's just whatever.
Totally.

206
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,380
It's,
it's a necessary evil,

207
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:18,160
you know,
in sort of sorts.

208
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,890
It's not really necessary at all that 
maybe that's the wrong way to describe 

209
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,301
it,
but it's how the system has been set up 

210
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:28,581
and it's,
it's actually why I started hunting and 

211
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:30,890
doing what I do because I watched these 
documentaries like food inc and these 

212
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,010
things that kind of shine a light on,
you know,

213
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:35,190
the system and how this stuff is 
actually being produced.

214
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,460
And it's horrible.
It's a,

215
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,520
it's terrible.
Yes.

216
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,560
Yeah.
And I think that's the real number one 

217
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,391
problem and you know,
and this Vegan activist message to go 

218
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:46,360
after these types of farming,
you know,

219
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,000
we support as well.
We agree with.

220
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,900
So the fact that we were targeted for 
this was really,

221
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:53,280
really frustrating.
Yeah.

222
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:55,370
I think vegans,
um,

223
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,410
I understand where they're coming from,
but I don't think that they have seen 

224
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,500
the big picture.

225
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,310
And the big picture is there's some 
animals that need to be harvested.

226
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,150
They're not sustainable.
Wild pigs is the best example.

227
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,840
There is no way you are going to stop 
wild pigs without killing them.

228
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:18,030
There's no way.
You're not going to give them birth 

229
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,030
control.
You're not going to,

230
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,870
unless you've gotta let loose fucking 
packs of wolves.

231
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,590
And I mean packs to deal with like 
what's going on in Texas.

232
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,900
I mean,
they,

233
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,950
they're forced to shoot them out of 
helicopters.

234
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:33,951
They hot crazy.
They hire people to come in with 

235
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:33,951
helicopters and shoot them from this 
guy.

236
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:35,820
It's that bad.
And this is farmers.

237
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,800
There's companies called Hella hunting 
where they have it on the side,

238
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:43,920
like they have a wild boar and a fucking
helicopter blade on their logo.

239
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,400
They have to do it.
Yeah,

240
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,070
know.
And I,

241
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:52,071
I don't,
I don't have a lot of experience with 

242
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:52,071
that because where I am,
we don't have that wild boar problem.

243
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:52,670
But uh,
I,

244
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:57,671
I hunt with these guys from,
from Moscow yoke and I've gone down 

245
00:10:57,671 --> 00:11:00,891
there and done one of these pig hunts 
and they've shown me their fields and 

246
00:11:00,891 --> 00:11:02,520
like one third of their cornfield is 
just destroyed,

247
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:07,590
destroyed.
And they have to hunt them at night or 

248
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,071
they hunt them with dogs and uh,
it's a huge problem for farmers trying 

249
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,790
to make a living.
It is a huge problem.

250
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,970
And vegans themselves need to understand
that's your food supply.

251
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,770
Totally.
You're not growing your own food.

252
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:21,771
Mostly.
Most people listening to this that are 

253
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:23,631
Vegan or not growing their own food.
You're getting your own food from a 

254
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:23,730
farm.
That farm is getting attacked by pigs.

255
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:26,640
That's the only one animal.
The other one is dear.

256
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,520
I mean there's a shitload of deer in 
North America.

257
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,970
What's interesting is California has a 
very weird way of handling it and I kind

258
00:11:33,971 --> 00:11:35,070
of get it in some ways.

259
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:40,340
The weird way that we handle it in 
California is we don't hunt mountain 

260
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:40,340
lions.
Okay.

261
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,950
There's no mountain lion hunting.
This is very few deer.

262
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,560
I mean,
I see deer in my neighborhood.

263
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,830
I've lived in a fairly rural area.
Yup.

264
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,500
I see deer,
you know,

265
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,080
couple of times a week.
But it's nothing like if you go to the 

266
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,381
east coast,
have you ever been in the east coast of 

267
00:11:57,381 --> 00:11:58,690
California or the United States?
Like New York state,

268
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,310
that kind of area,
but near New York City.

269
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:03,160
I had been to the east coast.
Now the state,

270
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,750
if you go upstate like New York state,
there's so many fucking deer up there.

271
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:10,270
It's one of the reasons why lyme disease
is so horrible up there.

272
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,280
It's comes from the ticks that were on 
the deer and people get these terrible,

273
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,670
terrible cases of lyme disease and it's 
fucking everywhere up there,

274
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:23,671
man.
I have several friends that have really 

275
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:23,671
bad lyme disease.

276
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:26,380
Have to take 'em,
go to Jim Miller's instagram.

277
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:31,381
Jim Miller is a fighter in the UFC,
a high level fighter who's been 

278
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,200
competing at the highest level for a 
long time and he has serious lyme 

279
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:40,390
disease to the point where it's 
debilitating,

280
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,050
it's scary.
He has to take a fat bag of pills and he

281
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:48,280
held up his pills the other day.
What he takes while he's looking at this

282
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:50,260
is what he takes wally's in training 
camp.

283
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,620
That's insane.
Nineteen days of medication supplements.

284
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,540
He said,
he said,

285
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,840
fuck Lee.
Me Thirty one capsules a day.

286
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:04,070
You do the math.
Remember the carry to seven a and it 

287
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,710
just says lyme disease is one of the 
hashtags.

288
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:08,260
Yeah,
he's got it really bad and I mean,

289
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,080
what's crazy is the guy could not be 
healthier,

290
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,020
works out,
constantly eats right.

291
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:19,050
He's not booze and his body's just 
falling apart because of fucking lyme 

292
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,630
disease and it's being carried by these.

293
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,660
These deer overpopulation of wild 
animals is handled in one of two ways.

294
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,950
Either you introduced predators or you 
manage them with hunting.

295
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,030
Um,
there's a place in Maui,

296
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,300
in Maui where they are,
um,

297
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,660
the at Maui has no predators,
you know,

298
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,730
and,
but they also have a bunch of wild game 

299
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,420
that was brought in for King Kamehameha,
I think it was in the 18 hundreds.

300
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:48,670
They brought it in,
I'm not sure when,

301
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:53,671
but there's tons of access deer on,
on Maui and Lanai and on Molokai and a 

302
00:13:55,151 --> 00:14:00,151
couple of different islands.
And one of the things they've started 

303
00:14:00,151 --> 00:14:02,710
doing is they were trying to figure out 
how to eradicate them from this area.

304
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,240
So a bunch of hunters got together and 
they're hunting these access deer.

305
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,870
Then giving the meat to poor people.
Like making it free for them and it's a,

306
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,990
it's a really cool program,
but that's another sort of situation 

307
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:19,290
where you kind of have to hunt you.

308
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,460
There's no other,
unless you're just going to poison them 

309
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,420
or you're going to somehow or another 
capture them all and neuter and spay a 

310
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,251
certain amount of them every month.
There's really no other way to handle 

311
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:32,251
it.
Yeah.

312
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:36,421
And I think that's a big misconception 
that people that don't educate 

313
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:36,820
themselves about hunting,
hunting is bad.

314
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:41,821
Killing animals is bad and they'd get on
this bandwagon but they don't have 

315
00:14:41,821 --> 00:14:42,180
enough information about it know.
Um,

316
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:47,460
and I think people confuse trophy 
hunting with like they see cecil the 

317
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,980
lion and everyone goes after,
okay,

318
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:49,510
it's hunting is the,
is the problem,

319
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:50,230
but,
you know,

320
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:55,231
trophy hunting is the problem.
But the hunters that hunt for food and 

321
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,660
that hunt to help the,
uh,

322
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,840
the sort of environmental impacts that 
they're having.

323
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:04,841
Like people don't like snow geese.
I don't know if you know much about 

324
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:07,090
snow.
You read that article that you 

325
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,090
retweeted.

326
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,090
Actually,
yeah.

327
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,151
They like a nat Geo article that I 
posted these birds fly in flocks of 20,

328
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:15,671
30,000
birds and they land in a farmer's field 

329
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:17,891
and they eat everything,
everything and they destroy it and you 

330
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:17,891
know,
like 10,

331
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:20,450
15 years ago these populations of birds,
they weren't like they are now.

332
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:25,451
So I'm well large scale agriculture is 
also responsible for the boom and the 

333
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:29,240
population of deer,
deer and in America,

334
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,990
particularly like in the midwest where 
all the farms are.

335
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,230
What is it a fucking coincidence that 
there's all the deer were all the farms 

336
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,230
are?
No,

337
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,771
it's not by my good friend Doug Darren,
he has a big ass farm in Wisconsin.

338
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,530
Beautiful place in the driftless area.
Do you know what that is?

339
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,930
It's where the glaciers didn't pass 
through,

340
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,040
so it's not flat.
It was all these hills and it's very 

341
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,690
beautiful and lakes.
It's a phenomenal place,

342
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,230
but essentially he's got the deer that 
he hunts and that,

343
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,280
that he and his friends hunt on his 
property.

344
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,170
They're farm animals.
Totally.

345
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,820
Corn grows corn.
He's a farmer,

346
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:12,910
so he grows all this corn.
The deer are eating all this corn and 

347
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,510
they're fucking delicious.
Man.

348
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,850
They're huge.
They're so good.

349
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:21,050
But there's a reality to a population 
control.

350
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:26,110
Now in Wisconsin,
they get it because they're around them 

351
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,630
every day.
They're hitting them with their cars.

352
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:28,310
They see them everywhere.
They look.

353
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,460
There's,
this is not like the idealistic view of 

354
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,700
someone who lives in a city street in 
Toronto and is driving around their bike

355
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,820
looking for signs that are criticizing 
Kale or whatever the fuck they're doing.

356
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:45,710
They're not in the real natural world 
that these animals are present.

357
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,510
They don't get it.
They don't understand,

358
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,070
uh,
you know,

359
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,080
they live in their bubble and you know,
another thing they don't understand is 

360
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,080
that hunter is actually,
you know,

361
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,670
we have to buy tags.
We have to buy our licenses that were 

362
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,670
rules and laws that we have to follow.

363
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,440
And those fees actually pay for the 
wildlife conservation.

364
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,470
And I'm pretty sure it's the same in the
states as well from talking to my 

365
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,621
friends and it is Pitman Robertson Act 
and they don't understand been percent 

366
00:17:08,621 --> 00:17:13,450
of all the proceeds from hunting gear go
to wildlife conservation.

367
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,220
And that turns out to be billions and 
billions of dollars.

368
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:21,200
It's far more than any other 
conservation group,

369
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:25,490
far more than any wildlife conservation 
group or animal activist group,

370
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:30,491
and no one contributes more to 
conservation than hunting because we 

371
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:34,691
want.
We want it to be there for our kids and 

372
00:17:34,691 --> 00:17:34,691
their kids and it's nature.
It's,

373
00:17:34,691 --> 00:17:38,320
it's how the world is supposed to be.
It's also this contradictory thing that 

374
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:38,320
seems.
It seems like it doesn't make sense,

375
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,630
but we love the wildlife.
I love the animals.

376
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,210
Just because you eat them doesn't mean 
you don't love them,

377
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,630
but you recognize them as.
This is a weird way to look at it,

378
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:49,410
but it is a renewable resource.

379
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,630
Right?
And it is also a magical,

380
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:56,631
beautiful thing.
Just because of that doesn't mean you 

381
00:17:56,631 --> 00:17:56,631
shouldn't eat it.
Yeah,

382
00:17:56,631 --> 00:18:00,650
I mean it's this,
this disconnect that people have with 

383
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,220
the wild,
I think is a real part of it.

384
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:06,000
A real part of the problem.
Good luck finding a Vegan in Alaska.

385
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,240
You know,
there's not a whole lot of them that 

386
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,570
live out in the bush that are vegans,
salmon and they're eating and you can,

387
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,560
you can bring in vegetables.
I mean,

388
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,650
I'm sure there are some of them just 
talking shit,

389
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:20,430
but the reality is if you're,
if you're embedded in that world,

390
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:24,000
you understand it and you appreciate it 
and it's very humbling.

391
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,220
I mean,
killing an animal is very humbling.

392
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:31,221
I mean,
it sounds like somewhat as an animal 

393
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:31,221
lover,
that sounds fucking crazy.

394
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:31,350
It's hard.
It's also really hard.

395
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:36,351
Like when I see a deer come out,
I hunt with a bow crossbow and I see a 

396
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:36,351
deer come out.

397
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:37,950
It's,
I'm trembling.

398
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,770
The hair on my back is standing up.
There are these beautiful,

399
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:44,370
majestic creatures and I'm going to kill
it and it's really,

400
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:48,210
really difficult and I don't think that 
people understand that,

401
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,100
that don't hunt and then haven't killed 
an animal.

402
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:55,101
They don't understand the respect and 
the amount of effort that goes into 

403
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:55,500
that.
No,

404
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,330
they definitely don't,
but they don't care.

405
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:02,590
I mean,
what they have an idea and the is 

406
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,000
animals should not die,
but they're going to die.

407
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,590
It's,
they're going to die of old age.

408
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:06,480
They're going to die of starvation.
They're gonna freeze to death.

409
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:07,770
They're gonna,
they're gonna be eaten alive.

410
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,990
They're going to be eaten alive,
and people think that animals,

411
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:13,530
they die peacefully in the wild.
It's absolutely incorrect.

412
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:19,010
If you google anything about how animals
dying well and they're being eaten 

413
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,301
alive,
like deer being taken down and eaten 

414
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:23,301
alive by wolves or coyotes or whatever 
it is,

415
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:24,810
there's bears and it's horrific.

416
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,540
And to be shot with an Arrow to be shot 
with a bullet,

417
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,150
it's a way more humane way to go,
uh,

418
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:31,410
in my,
in my opinion,

419
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,080
oh,
it's unquestionably a more humane way to

420
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:34,770
go.
I mean,

421
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:39,540
it's one of the reasons why I hunt and I
practiced so much.

422
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:44,570
I practice every day.
I have one of the reasons why we got 

423
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:44,570
this building,
so I could put a $45 dollars.

424
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,500
I want to shoot it to practice.
Well,

425
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,200
we could shoot afterwards,
but I was have to fucking practice.

426
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:54,290
You have to be,
you have to be able to make an ethical 

427
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,441
shot,
but now when I sit down and I cook 

428
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:59,010
something for my family,
I know where that came from.

429
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,380
If we have vegetables that we grow in 
our garden,

430
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,070
there's a great satisfaction for serving
up some cucumbers or some,

431
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,640
some Kale or whatever it is that we grow
in our garden.

432
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,640
It tastes better when you.
When you go out there and you cut that 

433
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:12,660
cucumber off the planet and you cut that
Kale down,

434
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,070
it is like half an hour old,
like nothing compares to that freshness 

435
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,070
that you go to the grocery store that 
may be a couple of days a week,

436
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:23,010
a month old.
You have no idea and for me as a chef,

437
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,790
that's why I love hunting and foraging 
and having a garden in my backyard 

438
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,710
because when you go and pick something,
nothing tastes as good as that.

439
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,990
Right?
Yeah.

440
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:38,270
I mean I appreciate were vegans and 
animal rights activists are coming from 

441
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:43,170
because it's coming from.
I think there's a lot of distortion with

442
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:48,190
like really angry ones,
but this is my take on a lot of this is 

443
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,171
you get a group of 100 people,
one of them for sure is a fucking idiot 

444
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:54,130
just out of just sheer odds,
right?

445
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:59,340
Like what are the odds?
One of them is a fucking gets pretty 

446
00:20:59,340 --> 00:20:59,340
strong,
right?

447
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,100
Well if you're going to get a group of 
100 vegans,

448
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:01,660
you're going to get at least one of 
them.

449
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,240
That's fucking idiot.
And they're going to be.

450
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:09,270
Some of them are violent,
some of them are super aggressive about 

451
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,270
it.
I mean there's a ton of them online.

452
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,350
You can go.
They.

453
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,280
Their identity is completely wrapped 
around veganism.

454
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:14,530
These vegan in their name,
it's always,

455
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:18,400
I'm the Vegan this or the Vegan that 
that is 100 percent of their name,

456
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,010
so a 100 percent of their identity,
so they can't.

457
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,070
They can't separate from it ever.
Like that is who they are forever and 

458
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,840
they have been some serious problems.
What was the name of that cafe again?

459
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,820
Cafe gratitude.
There were some people that were running

460
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:36,820
a Vegan restaurant,
I think they have a couple of them right

461
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,120
in La and um,
they were having health issues and some 

462
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:47,281
people,
the Vegan Diet just doesn't agree with 

463
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:48,940
them and maybe they were doing it wrong,
maybe they have unique dietary needs,

464
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,970
but they started raising cattle and they
started eating those cattle and the 

465
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,790
fucking vegans freaked out.

466
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Death threats,
all this crazy shit coming after them 

467
00:21:59,880 --> 00:21:59,880
protesting.
And,

468
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,550
you know,
these people were terrified.

469
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:01,610
They're older folks,
they're,

470
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,020
they're,
you know,

471
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:02,980
they're elderly.
They're,

472
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:07,981
it is Vegan restaurant owners received 
death threats over animal slaughter 

473
00:22:07,981 --> 00:22:08,830
scandal.
Yeah,

474
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,190
I mean this is the bad ones,
right?

475
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,570
And it's not,
most of them,

476
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,840
most vegans I think are vegans for all 
the right reasons.

477
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,690
You're misinformed if you choose to,
to not,

478
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,920
uh,
to not eat meat and choose that kind of 

479
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:24,920
lifestyle like power to.
It's amazing.

480
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,970
And I think that it,
you know,

481
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,510
if,
if,

482
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,140
if it works for you in your body,
that's great.

483
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,580
And for me it doesn't work for me.
Like I've,

484
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,170
I've done Vegan cleanses,
I've done the juice cleanses,

485
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:35,860
I've,
I've done,

486
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,100
I've gone out for,
as a chef to Vegan restaurants and I'm 

487
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,230
not full,
you know,

488
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,920
I'll,
I'll,

489
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,940
I'll eat three or four courses,
I'll spend tons of money and half an 

490
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,490
hour later I'm starving,
starving and I need to eat something 

491
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,500
with protein and lots of protein and 
it's meat or fish or I've made tofu from

492
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:58,180
scratch,
from soybeans and it's just,

493
00:22:58,181 --> 00:22:59,800
it doesn't,
it's not the same.

494
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,290
Yeah.
Well right now people are screaming,

495
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,560
you're doing every vegan food is tasty,
but I'm not selling of it is.

496
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,740
Some of it's good.
I mean,

497
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:14,740
I eat vegan raw all the time there.
There's a Vegan restaurant near me.

498
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:16,720
I go to all the time.
Sometimes you get dirty looks,

499
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,870
this motherfucker's here.
Why are you here?

500
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,330
You're not allowed to.
You're not one of us.

501
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,710
You're not allowed to eat our food.
Um,

502
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,510
it's just,
it's very unfortunate that I think these

503
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,210
ideological groups get tainted by the 
most extreme members.

504
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,280
And I think that's true on the hunting 
side too.

505
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,040
And you got guys like fucking Ted 
Nugent,

506
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:43,060
you know,
and all the people that I think that 

507
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,810
they distort the real sort of

508
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,790
fascinating in mystical qualities of 
wildlife and harvesting wildlife and 

509
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:58,181
being out there and experiencing nature.
It said it's an almost psychedelic 

510
00:23:58,181 --> 00:24:01,100
experience to to,
to hunt and be in the wild.

511
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,280
That sounds so counterintuitive to 
someone who's never experienced it,

512
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,990
but the world of these animals,
when you're away from your cell phone,

513
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:13,340
when you're away from television and all
the bullshit and the computer,

514
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,860
when you're.
When you're out there in the wild,

515
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:20,861
you are almost in another dimension.
If you're in complete silence in the 

516
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:21,830
forest,
in you,

517
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:27,070
your mind goes into a completely 
different sort of mode that is familiar,

518
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,890
but yet alien.
It's familiar in a way that your body's 

519
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:35,890
like,
oh,

520
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,941
this is hunting.
This is what humans have done for 

521
00:24:39,941 --> 00:24:41,000
hundreds of thousands of years.
This is why we became human.

522
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:46,180
I mean,
this is literally one of the reasons 

523
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,090
that scientists believed that our brains
grew is because we started eating meat.

524
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,090
We started cooking meat.
The nutrition became more accessible and

525
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:53,210
also we started thinking about how to 
hunt,

526
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:58,270
developing tools to hunt with.
I mean all of this is the reason why 

527
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,590
humans are humans today and I'm sure the
Vegan argument against that would be,

528
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:02,750
well,
that's then and we're past that now.

529
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,040
While we're not.
No,

530
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:04,910
we're not.
We're not.

531
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:07,370
Because of controlling the population of
animals,

532
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:12,550
we're certainly not because of 
controlling the population of predators 

533
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:12,920
and that's another thing that people 
need to accept and understand.

534
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:18,310
There's a reason why they eradicated all
the wolves in North America before they 

535
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,641
reintroduced them to yellowstone and now
they're thriving and many parts of the 

536
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:25,031
northwest,
it's because they were fucking killing 

537
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:26,951
everything and there's.
They don't have any predators and the 

538
00:25:26,951 --> 00:25:29,680
predators that they have are humans,
and if we don't keep the populations in 

539
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,001
check of them and have grizzly bears 
have black bears and all the other 

540
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:35,030
predators,
they start eating each other.

541
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,120
They start tearing each other apart.
They start coming after us to start 

542
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,120
encroaching on p.
well,

543
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,360
we're in their territory.
We shouldn't be in their place.

544
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,830
We humans.
Incredible.

545
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,950
Look,
I'm on team people so I don't know what 

546
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:47,950
the fuck you're saying here.
You're saying that we should move out of

547
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,400
San Francisco and give it to the wolves.
You can go fuck yourself.

548
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,800
Right,
and this is literally what it boils down

549
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:56,801
to because you have to draw some line in
the sand somewhere because if someone 

550
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:58,580
doesn't control the population of 
animals,

551
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,400
then what's going to happen?
Well,

552
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,460
you know,
you can leave them to their own devices 

553
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:06,770
and they can sort of sort it out,
but you know how they sorted out through

554
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:11,771
disease and starvation.
I mean what happens is there's too many 

555
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,720
animals and not enough food.
So they get horrific diseases.

556
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:16,340
That's where mange comes from.

557
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,340
That's where a lot of serious diseases 
that infect wildlife come from.

558
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,230
They come from a lack of food or 
overpopulation.

559
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,510
That's how nature sorts it out,
you know?

560
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:28,070
And that's how nature sorts of that with
people too.

561
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:33,071
Which just sneaky.
We've used vaccines and shit and we're 

562
00:26:33,071 --> 00:26:33,560
at the top of food chain.
We've worked hard to get there.

563
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:38,650
We are and I think we it comes with a 
certain responsibility and that 

564
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:42,521
responsibility is really.
We were really doing a disservice to 

565
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:45,810
that responsibility with factory farming
and that's one of the main arguments for

566
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:50,811
veganism that one of the main arguments 
is the horrific treatment of those 

567
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:54,591
animals,
whether it's veganism or or or or 

568
00:26:54,591 --> 00:26:56,970
whether it's rather factory farming or 
whether it's a large skill,

569
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:02,210
dairy farms where they mistreat their 
cows or the chicken farms are all these 

570
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:06,111
different factory farms with a treat 
these animals not as a living being but 

571
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:07,080
as a commodity.

572
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,780
Then it becomes a giant problem.
But if you look at guys like,

573
00:27:09,781 --> 00:27:14,130
do you know Joel Salitan is Joel South,
tends very fascinating guy.

574
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:19,490
He runs a farm called polyface farms and
what he is essentially done is made 

575
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,880
large scale animal agriculture possible 
in a humane and very natural way.

576
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,990
He has enormous electric fences that he 
uses for his pigs and he just moves them

577
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:39,321
around,
moves the fences around so the pigs 

578
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:39,840
wander around.
Here's a huge rolling chicken coop.

579
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:42,960
I mean it's fucking huge and he pushes 
that thing around.

580
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,390
He moves it to a new space,
the chickens go out,

581
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:46,560
they wander around and blah,
blah,

582
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:46,800
blah,
blah,

583
00:27:46,801 --> 00:27:51,801
blah.
They do the chicken thing and they go 

584
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:51,801
right back into the chicken house and 
this is where it gets the eggs from.

585
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:54,810
This is how they raised chickens.
This is how they raise cattle.

586
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,960
They do it with all these different 
animals and his perspective on all this 

587
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,610
is that if you.
If you do it right,

588
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,670
it's not horrific.
It's not an evil thing,

589
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,010
and that these animals are living the 
way they've.

590
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,620
They're meant to live.
Right,

591
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:15,310
and that's why.
That's one of the things that we do at 

592
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,340
Antler is to,
is to find those farmers and guys like 

593
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,221
that.
One of the farms that we get our deer 

594
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:20,221
from,
they have thousand acres.

595
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:20,560
The deer roam as they pleased they're 
eating,

596
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,620
not an apples and acorns and grass and 
everything they're supposed to eat and 

597
00:28:25,691 --> 00:28:30,691
then when it's time they're,
they're collected and harvested and 

598
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:33,901
that.
That is where we get our meat from and 

599
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:34,570
we try really hard not to buy from these
facts.

600
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,880
We don't serve chicken,
beef or pork.

601
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:42,090
We have bison pheasant duck well bore 
because these game farms,

602
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,880
they don't have these massive large 
scale operations and I buy direct from 

603
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,790
the farmer and they can tell me what 
their diet is,

604
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,000
you know,
they're good months,

605
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:56,010
they're bad months.
We know all about these animals that 

606
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:56,410
we're bringing to the restaurant and,
and you know,

607
00:28:56,411 --> 00:28:57,220
we're really proud of that.

608
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:02,670
I have an,
an issue with people that keep saying 

609
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,521
wild boar.
Why did they say wild boar when it's 

610
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:05,790
wild pig.
So if it's a male,

611
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:10,830
it actually is a different breed.
So the pigs that are in these factory 

612
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,430
farms or even regular regular pigs,
there's,

613
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:17,570
there's,
there's many different breeds and a lot 

614
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:17,570
of them are hybrid.
Hybrid breeds.

615
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:22,010
The wild boar breed has long black hair 
and tusks that actually come out so I 

616
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:25,600
can buy whole pigs and they don't have 
those tusks.

617
00:29:25,601 --> 00:29:28,780
And when I buy the well bore breed,
the meat is darker,

618
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,680
hair is black,
but we're,

619
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:31,410
we're getting um,
you know,

620
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,930
there's no hair by the time we get them 
and they've got the tusks in the jaw.

621
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,970
Right.
But my point is that a board is a male,

622
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,550
right?
You definitely eating females too.

623
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,570
That's true.
Yeah.

624
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,100
So why do call it a wild boar?

625
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,390
Because it's just.
Yeah,

626
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:48,391
it's just the breed.
But do you know that they're all the 

627
00:29:48,391 --> 00:29:48,391
same breed?
I did not know that.

628
00:29:48,391 --> 00:29:50,950
All [inaudible] is the,
the,

629
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,480
the,
I guess the genus,

630
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:57,510
is that what you say?
They're all sort of interchangeable 

631
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,290
breed with each other.
I do know there's,

632
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,670
there's tons of different varieties like
the Berkshire,

633
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:05,671
there's Tamworth,
there's all these different kinds of 

634
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:05,671
shorts.
Breeds of hogs is variations.

635
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:06,250
Yeah.
But they're all the same animal.

636
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,910
What's crazy about wild pigs is you took
a domestic pig,

637
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:15,420
you know,
like babe release babe out into the 

638
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,661
forest.
They morph right a very short amount of 

639
00:30:18,661 --> 00:30:18,661
time.
Now it extends.

640
00:30:18,661 --> 00:30:22,420
Their hair becomes darker and thicker.
Their tusks lengthen.

641
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,860
Interesting.
It's very weird.

642
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:28,861
There are weird animal.
Pigs are a weird animal because where 

643
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:29,350
we're at a weird animal when they're 
domestic,

644
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,170
they're sweethearts.
Unless you fall in the cage when they're

645
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:34,810
hungry and they fucking eat you,
which is crazy.

646
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:39,730
It's one of the main ways that farmers 
die falling into cages that eaten by.

647
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,280
Some happens all the time.
It does.

648
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:45,940
It happens every year.
Guy will fuck up and fall into a pig pen

649
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,310
and the pigs just fuck him up.
That's crazy.

650
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:53,340
Yeah.
Especially if you're dealing with those 

651
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,891
really enormous pigs mean those pigs 
need a lot of food and they're fucking 

652
00:30:55,891 --> 00:31:00,661
big and once they start chewing you,
that's your ass is just an aside.

653
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,590
Have you been pig hunting?
Yeah.

654
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,650
Yeah,
yeah.

655
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,550
I've been hunting.
I've shot a couple of pigs.

656
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,470
Yeah.
The meat is definitely different.

657
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,760
It's a lot darker.
Darker.

658
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,320
Yeah.
It's delicious though.

659
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,270
And um,
where I do it.

660
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,390
What's really interesting is in 
California,

661
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,600
a lot of the pigs were introduced by 
William Randolph hearst,

662
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,580
that crazy asshole that ran from the 
movie citizen Kane,

663
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:29,670
of course in wells depiction of him.
He was this crazy guy that ran hearst 

664
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:29,800
publications in the 19 thirties.

665
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,710
He's literally one of the reasons why 
marijuana is illegal.

666
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:38,070
Right?
William Randolph hearst decided that 

667
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,740
when there was a cover of a believe as 
popular science magazine that said hemp 

668
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,480
is the new billion dollar crop,
and they were,

669
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:48,510
they had invented a machine called the 
decorticator and when a decorticator 

670
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,900
does is it effectively processes hemp 
fiber.

671
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:55,330
I'm much more efficiently and for the 
longest time they use slaves to process 

672
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:00,121
hemp fiber,
but then Eli Whitney came around with 

673
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:01,270
the cotton gin and they switch from hemp
clothing to cotton.

674
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,750
Cotton is easier to produce with the 
cotton gin,

675
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:08,590
but it's just an inferior cloth.
Hamp makes better paper.

676
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,740
A hemp makes cloth.
You could make houses with it.

677
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:15,100
Henry Ford made the first fenders for 
the first model t out of hemp.

678
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,630
I mean,
that's a crazy thing.

679
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,550
William Randolph hearst read this 
article,

680
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:25,551
saw what was coming and realized that he
was going to have to transition all of 

681
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:29,491
his paper mills and he owned forest,
that they would cut down the trees and 

682
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:32,791
make paper with.
They will have to transition those to 

683
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:35,041
hemp if people were demanding hemp.
So instead he undercut the entire 

684
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:39,691
industry by saying that there was a new 
drug that blacks and were smoking

685
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,910
and they were raping white women and he 
called this drug marijuana,

686
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,960
which was really just the name of them.
It was a Mexican slang for wild tobacco.

687
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,590
So we start printing these stories.
Congress made it illegal.

688
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,460
They didn't even thought of people that 
were voting on it,

689
00:32:53,461 --> 00:32:57,680
didn't even know that they were making 
cannabis or hemp,

690
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,320
the,
the,

691
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,760
the,
the textile.

692
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,070
And the commodity.
Him,

693
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,600
they didn't know they were making it 
illegal.

694
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,690
They thought they were stopping a drug 
scourge that was forcing blacks and 

695
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,871
Mexicans to rape white women.
It was all William Randolph hearst is 

696
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:12,980
one crazy asshole with Harry anslinger 
in the fucking 19 thirties.

697
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,840
That's when it became illegal.
Well,

698
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:19,841
this is the same crazy asshole.
Let a bunch of wild pigs loose on his 

699
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:21,500
property so he can hunt them because he 
was a gentlemen hunter.

700
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,680
So the pigs that I hunt in California,
when I go pig hunting probably are 

701
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:31,610
direct descendants from the pigs that 
were let loose by this asshole.

702
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,390
And I think a lot of people don't 
understand is how fast they breed.

703
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,650
Um,
you know,

704
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:41,651
my,
my friends and Mississippi were telling 

705
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:41,651
me,
you know,

706
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:41,651
a pig can lay a litter three times a 
year,

707
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:44,570
four times a year up to 10,
12 piglets per litter,

708
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,150
and they have no natural predators.
So what are these farmers going to do?

709
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,880
And they start decimating their crops.
Yeah.

710
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:51,890
They're not a native North American 
species.

711
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,790
No.
Yeah.

712
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,780
And it's,
uh,

713
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,230
it's one of the most destructive 
invasive species.

714
00:33:57,231 --> 00:33:59,750
And if you,
if you've never seen them before,

715
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:01,490
you see them on tv,
they look,

716
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,510
you know,
it's a pig.

717
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:05,360
Pigs are cute.
I've seen my friend has a potbelly pit.

718
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,370
I pet it.
That's great.

719
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:12,610
What they are as adults,
when they're wild boars covered in mud 

720
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,750
and disease,
they're fucking a mammal.

721
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:15,920
Plague.
They're vicious.

722
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,530
And they,
they go through everything.

723
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:23,810
They will spread across the country.
They'll destroy your garden that still 

724
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:23,810
eat your dog.
I mean,

725
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,700
no bullshit.
They're fucking dangerous.

726
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,180
There's a lot of farmers actually asked 
me if I'll come hunt on their property.

727
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,520
A lot of vineyards will ask me to come 
in and they have a problem with the 

728
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Turkeys.
The Turkeys are eating all their grapes,

729
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,230
you know,
stuff like that,

730
00:34:36,231 --> 00:34:36,630
that,
you know,

731
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:41,650
a lot of these,
a lot of regular kind of city people 

732
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:41,650
live in the city that don't understand.
Yeah.

733
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:46,331
The Turkey population.
Some places are exploding too because 

734
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:46,331
they've realized that it was just go to 
the suburbs.

735
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:47,930
I even hunts us.
There was one running down the street in

736
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:52,931
Toronto last week at Turkey.
People were filming it and sending me 

737
00:34:52,931 --> 00:34:52,931
the.
Wow.

738
00:34:52,931 --> 00:34:52,931
See?
Yeah,

739
00:34:52,931 --> 00:34:54,220
they're delicious too.
Yeah,

740
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:59,440
that's actually the first bird I hunted.
I didn't actually start hunting until I 

741
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,310
was in my twenties and I had grown up 
cooking.

742
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:06,370
Um,
I was interested in becoming a chef and 

743
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,070
a family friend told me he was going 
Turkey hunting and I said,

744
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:12,071
well,
what do you mean you're going Turkey 

745
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:12,071
hunting?
Like I thought Turkeys were.

746
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:12,071
I didn't know there was such thing as 
well.

747
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:14,270
Turkey,
I thought they were a domesticated bird,

748
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:17,280
like a chicken.
So he takes me Turkey hunting and um,

749
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,010
I actually,
I couldn't believe it.

750
00:35:19,011 --> 00:35:19,390
We,
you know,

751
00:35:19,391 --> 00:35:21,120
we shot a couple of birds,
um,

752
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:26,140
you know,
we plucked them out and then the skin 

753
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,250
was yellow and the meat is dark,
like,

754
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,460
like the chicken leg meat is like the 
breast,

755
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:30,220
like it's dark and I just thought like,
wow,

756
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,760
this is incredible.
And then when I tasted it,

757
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,770
I just couldn't believe that this is 
what Turkey was supposed to taste,

758
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:39,700
like blessed flavor and you grow up,
you know,

759
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,830
at least I grew up,
you know,

760
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:42,000
Christmas,
thanksgiving,

761
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:43,380
these,
these important holidays,

762
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:46,770
eating Turkey and you see it and it's 
this big white blob and it's humongous.

763
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,320
And then,
you know,

764
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:48,480
the wild bird,
it's leaner.

765
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,200
It's not like super round.
It's,

766
00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:50,820
it's,
it's lean,

767
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:52,740
it's how it's supposed to be in there.
For me,

768
00:35:52,741 --> 00:35:57,741
that was like the light bulb moment that
this is what we're supposed to be 

769
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:01,491
eating.
We're not supposed to be eating that 

770
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:01,491
shit.
Yeah,

771
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:01,560
that shit that,
that really white meat,

772
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:02,280
Turkey,
look at them.

773
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,450
Here's the Turkey,
Toronto,

774
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:09,020
Toronto running down the street.
I'm so thankful to be here because it's 

775
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,930
still snowing and so it's still snowing 
and I,

776
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:14,490
I love winter and snowboarding and going
out and enjoying the snow,

777
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:15,930
but I'm done.
California.

778
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,450
Come on down.
Yeah man.

779
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,030
I was talking to a buddy of mine from 
Montana on the phone yesterday.

780
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:25,050
It was fucking freezing cold up there.
Thick snow everywhere and you know,

781
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,800
they're about to open up their bear 
season and he's like,

782
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:29,550
Jesus Christ.

783
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,500
It's snow's everywhere.
And I'm like,

784
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:33,450
dude,
I'm in my underwear right now outside.

785
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:37,090
I love it here man.
I have a soft spot for a for California.

786
00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:42,091
I've been,
I've been coming here since I was a 

787
00:36:42,091 --> 00:36:42,170
little kid to visit my dad in the 
summers and I come here two,

788
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,370
three times a year and I love it.
I love it too.

789
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,030
Uh,
you know,

790
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:50,031
the mountain lion thing is a weird thing
with California because I see their 

791
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:50,031
point.
What would they be,

792
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:54,760
is essentially done is.
And this is one of the weird things 

793
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,661
about California is like California is 
one of the places that doesn't have a 

794
00:36:59,661 --> 00:37:01,560
fishing game department.
Really?

795
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,720
Yeah.
It's like they don't call it that,

796
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,770
call it wildlife,
they don't call it like a,

797
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:11,100
like they don't think of it as like you 
have to hunt them.

798
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:16,370
Like if you say like fishing game or 
Arizona calls it game and fish because 

799
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,960
there's more game in Arizona and there 
are fish desert.

800
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:24,020
Yeah.
It's kind of interesting way they've 

801
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,560
switched it around,
but I think the way California calls it,

802
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:29,570
it's fish and wildlife,
so we call it the Ministry of natural 

803
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,240
resources.
That's a good way to look at it,

804
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,690
but you know,
I can't argue with the effectiveness of 

805
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,481
their approach because you do not find a
lot of deer in California and deer 

806
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:40,770
hunters are extremely frustrated by that
and I get it.

807
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,240
If you're like a local guy and you want 
to be able to hunt your own deer,

808
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,040
it's hard going,
man.

809
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,780
It's crazy.
I actually didn't know there was hunting

810
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:53,781
here.
I had no idea and through through 

811
00:37:53,781 --> 00:37:53,781
hanging out with my friends at Mtsu 
Yolk,

812
00:37:53,781 --> 00:37:58,131
I met this guy that lives actually in 
Orange County is named Jeremiah Dowdy 

813
00:37:58,131 --> 00:37:58,940
from field to plate.
If you don't know,

814
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,510
if you know this guy,
he's a local,

815
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,220
uh,
uh,

816
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,200
you know,
La guy and he hunts all over California.

817
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,880
I had no idea that there was so much 
hunting.

818
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:11,630
California unt,
he's a really good friend of mine and 

819
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:11,630
I'm saying,
well,

820
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:11,630
what's the.
He's like,

821
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:11,630
well,
there's Turkey.

822
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,250
There's wild pig.
There's the pronghorn.

823
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,260
There's all kinds of stuff that you can 
hunt.

824
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,770
Yeah.
Today there's rocky mountain elk near to

825
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:24,771
home ranch,
and then there's two Lee elk that are 

826
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:24,771
natural on the coast.
There's a lot of different animals here,

827
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,330
but there's also a lot of motherfucking 
mountain lions.

828
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,970
Whoa.
And they still kill it,

829
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,640
but the way they kill them now is 
through government trackers.

830
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:36,050
It's really kind of crazy.
What they do is mountain lion

831
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:41,050
starting people's dogs and cats and they
get the get scary and then people call 

832
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:46,740
one of the,
I don't know who you would call that 

833
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,551
would take care of it.
And they hire people and most of the 

834
00:38:49,551 --> 00:38:50,470
time they use dogs,
these dogs to tree the mountain lion and

835
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:52,900
they shoot them and when they empty the 
contents,

836
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,610
their stomachs,
when they do an autopsy on them,

837
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,910
they find it filled with dogs and cats,
which is really kind of crazy.

838
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,350
There was one near my where my dad 
lives.

839
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,650
A lady was attacked and they were 
running a pair.

840
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:09,660
A pair of girls are running a in the 
canyon and a mountain lion actually 

841
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,011
attacked one of them and she was like 
having a tug of war with the mountain 

842
00:39:13,011 --> 00:39:13,011
lion,
like with her friend.

843
00:39:13,011 --> 00:39:15,300
So I think it was about five or six 
years ago.

844
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,400
And that was this summer in Orange 
County.

845
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:22,490
Someone was attacked,
running or cycling or something like 

846
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:22,490
that.
Yeah.

847
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:22,490
And they had.
They had to.

848
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,370
They went and found it and shot it.
But

849
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,710
it's.
Well when they get hungry,

850
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,080
no wait,
we're encroaching because we're 

851
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,080
encroaching on their land.
No,

852
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,120
it's just land.
Yeah.

853
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,740
It's not there as you.
Fuck.

854
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:39,980
This is what's crazy about.
People were encroaching on their 

855
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:39,980
territory.
They're dead.

856
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,020
And then whatever was there that claim 
that territory is dead,

857
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,840
and then there's a new one that comes 
along and they take it.

858
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:50,870
There's a fucking constant battle.
This idea that like we're in their 

859
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:54,261
community,
like they have a good established gated 

860
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:56,661
community that we've entered and we 
start putting up houses and pissing off 

861
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:56,661
their neighbors.
No,

862
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:58,050
that's not what it is.
It's just land.

863
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,570
And if you hate people and you don't 
like,

864
00:40:00,571 --> 00:40:03,900
cities will then go fucking live in the 
forest until then,

865
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,440
fuck off and stop saying like,
we're encroaching on their leg.

866
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,480
Do you go to the supermarket?
Yes.

867
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,310
Do you buy your Vegan food?

868
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,300
A Vegan Deli?
Well,

869
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:14,130
that's a place where a deer could have 
lived.

870
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Okay.
Do you go to the movie theater you do 

871
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,280
while you piece of shit that used to be 
like a Squirrel's house?

872
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,030
That was a field at one point.
Yeah,

873
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:26,060
I mean the large scale agriculture.
This is the other thing that kind of 

874
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,050
drives me crazy about vegans.
It's not,

875
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,930
I'm not saying you shouldn't eat grain,
not saying you shouldn't eat vegetables,

876
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:35,931
but large scale agriculture in terms of 
just raising vegetables is responsible 

877
00:40:36,271 --> 00:40:38,430
for a tremendous amount of death.
First of all,

878
00:40:38,431 --> 00:40:43,431
there's the pesticides that they use 
that kill bugs and now if you only like 

879
00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:44,520
mammals and you don't mind when people 
kill bugs,

880
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:49,521
that seems a little hypocritical to me.
Gets a little weird but does get weird 

881
00:40:49,521 --> 00:40:51,150
and then there's the fact that when 
you're making these,

882
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,700
when you're using a combine,
running through the,

883
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,380
all the rabbits,
all the bunnies,

884
00:40:55,381 --> 00:40:58,140
all the hogs are being decimated.
Decimated.

885
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,930
My good buddy lives in Iowa and you 
know,

886
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,360
he takes pictures.
He's like,

887
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:04,800
look,
we just chopped down.

888
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,280
We just cut the field,
look at all the vultures and the 

889
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,250
vultures just circling overhead and 
landing in the field right out.

890
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,650
They know when the combine rolls 
through,

891
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,140
they come in dinner time.
They literally know.

892
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,320
It's like there's places in Alaska,
especially on Kodiak island where a 

893
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,530
rifle shots equal.
I've heard of this dinner bell,

894
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,960
the forebears come running.
I've heard of this.

895
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:29,830
This is crazy.
Stairs

896
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,070
are are carrying like big magnum 45.
It's like pistols

897
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,200
to defend themselves against these 
grizzlies.

898
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,730
I'll send you a fantastic podcast that.
Do you know Steven Rinella is?

899
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,760
No.
Steven Rinella is a really,

900
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:47,280
really interesting guy and he's a host 
of a TV show called mediator.

901
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,320
He's just.
Oh yes,

902
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:48,680
yes,
yes.

903
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:53,681
He's an author.
He has a podcast that he recorded when 

904
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:58,961
they were in a fog neck island,
which is like one of those chains of 

905
00:41:58,961 --> 00:42:02,321
islands near Kodiak,
so it has those enormous coastal brown 

906
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:04,700
bears just like Kodiak.
And they got attacked.

907
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:09,910
They got attacked when they shot an elk 
and they were packing the elk out and 

908
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:13,481
they got rushed by a fucking tanker of a
bear and it is a crazy podcast because 

909
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:20,170
they record it right after the fact 
whenever everyone's freaking out still.

910
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:25,450
And you know,
one guy had a pistol on him but he set 

911
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,020
it down next to his pack and they had 
all these ideas of like what it would be

912
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:28,580
like if an animal came in.

913
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:33,580
Like if they got attack.
They had all these preconceived notions 

914
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:33,580
of what it would be like.
What it would feel like.

915
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,540
It was like,
throw all that out the window.

916
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,960
It was you were in.
Your brain isn't not even on a reptilian

917
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:41,480
level.
Your brain is so terrified.

918
00:42:41,481 --> 00:42:45,410
And this thing was so big.
My friend has said that he saw its teeth

919
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,580
gnashing literally feet from his head as
it ran through the candle.

920
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,020
My,
the revenant is just like,

921
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:55,450
fuck.
I got rushed by a deer one time and uh,

922
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,620
I was losing it.
I didn't know what to do.

923
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,050
It was a,
it was before sunrise.

924
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:04,250
It was like five in the morning.
I'm walking into my dear setup and I had

925
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:09,251
to cross this little river and it was 
full of stones and stuff and I'm kinda 

926
00:43:09,251 --> 00:43:12,770
walking up this river and all I hear is 
I put it on and I'm like,

927
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:14,540
Whoa,
like what the hell is that noise?

928
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,630
And then it stopped and it was pawing at
the ground and snorting.

929
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,830
And I was like,
Holy Shit,

930
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:20,600
this is a buck.
And like my,

931
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:25,700
my,
I got goosebumps right now thinking 

932
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:25,700
about this and this is my bows in my bag
and I'm just like,

933
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,740
I'm going to get taken down by this 
deer.

934
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,280
And then I thought it was another buck 
because it's,

935
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:30,940
you know,
it's in the,

936
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:36,190
it's running season for these deer and 
it then it smelt that I was a human and 

937
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:37,610
it did that.
I got blown it,

938
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:40,640
whistled did that whistling,
blowing kind of sound and took off.

939
00:43:40,641 --> 00:43:42,890
But I thought I was fucked.
I was like,

940
00:43:42,891 --> 00:43:44,000
this is it.
Get gored.

941
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,380
I'm going to get gored by these antlers.
And that's it.

942
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,770
It was.
So,

943
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,580
yeah,
that was in Canada.

944
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:51,110
So I have,
those are big animals.

945
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:56,111
They're big.
We have big white tail and I'm 300 

946
00:43:56,111 --> 00:43:56,111
pounds sometimes they're big.

947
00:43:56,111 --> 00:43:57,260
We and even our dozer,
huge like we got,

948
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:00,610
we got a lot of doe tags where I grew up
in a,

949
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,870
in Collagen,
which is about an hour north of the city

950
00:44:02,871 --> 00:44:06,110
on a horse farm.
We don't have a gun season for deer.

951
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:08,810
So that's how I got into archery and 
hunting with a bow.

952
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,370
That's interesting.
Why is that?

953
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:11,300
Um,
you know what,

954
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:12,680
I don't know.
I think it's because it's,

955
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:14,810
it's uh,
the farms are kind of closer together.

956
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,230
It's sort of like,
you know,

957
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,790
it's not huge agriculture.
They're more kind of hobby farm,

958
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:20,240
so I think they're a little closer 
together,

959
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,680
letting loose bullets let loose bolts.
The main thing is rifles,

960
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:29,630
so a deer season and Turkey season you 
can use a shotgun and it's really stupid

961
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:32,160
because you can,
you can shoot too with,

962
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,770
with a rifle or shotgun,
but there's no a shotgun,

963
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:36,690
a rifle for deer,
which is weird.

964
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,830
That is weird.
So that.

965
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,870
But that's why I got into archery.
Um.

966
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,660
Um,
and yeah,

967
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:45,150
I'm lucky because it's so close to the 
city I can,

968
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:47,670
I can kind of go and hunt and then come 
back to work in the morning.

969
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:53,390
Yeah.
The Kyle thing is interesting because 

970
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:53,390
it's very counterintuitive.
The more coyotes you kill,

971
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,710
the more coyotes breed.
More kyle populations increase.

972
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,740
Coyotes are off.
There are a big problem,

973
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,390
at least in Canada and where I'm from,
they've,

974
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,770
you know,
like you were talking about the mountain

975
00:45:01,771 --> 00:45:03,360
lions,
that's kind of our version.

976
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,370
They don't think there's any mountain 
lions where I live,

977
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:07,470
but um,
the coyotes are problem,

978
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,760
their nab and people's dogs and cats 
everywhere off,

979
00:45:09,761 --> 00:45:10,660
off,
off the trail.

980
00:45:10,661 --> 00:45:15,661
People were walking on their leash and 
they're coming out and nail in their 

981
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:15,661
little dogs out here.

982
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:17,130
I had one kill a chicken of mine two 
weeks ago.

983
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,180
Crazy.
Yeah.

984
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:21,660
I've got a video of the dead fucking 
chicken and my chicken coop.

985
00:45:21,661 --> 00:45:23,730
And then the,
here's what's really dark.

986
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,040
I dug a hole and a bird.
The chicken,

987
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,120
we don't eat our chickens,
we just use the eggs or eggs and they're

988
00:45:29,121 --> 00:45:30,090
like pets.
I mean,

989
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,160
like there's a video me from my 
instagram walking in my yard holding my 

990
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,930
daughter's bunny and the chickens.
They're like,

991
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:42,110
they're following me around it.
I wrote I'm the motherfucking chicken 

992
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,950
because it's a crazy video because these
chickens just follow me.

993
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,680
I mean they literally,
they're like pets.

994
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,520
So when this chicken died,
I was bummed out.

995
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:53,540
It was a sweetheart of a chicken too.
And this was a chicken that we used to.

996
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:58,820
We would turn over rocks and she would 
come and get the worms and so she would 

997
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:58,890
follow you around.

998
00:45:58,890 --> 00:45:59,640
I'm like,
come on sweetie.

999
00:45:59,641 --> 00:46:02,700
Here we go.
And it's really like a pet.

1000
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:03,330
Oh,
here it is.

1001
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,650
Here's a video of me walking,
like,

1002
00:46:04,651 --> 00:46:05,820
look at them.
That's so cool.

1003
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,050
They just follow me around,
man.

1004
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,900
I know a lot of farmers and people,
a little hobby farms.

1005
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:12,180
They use chickens as insect control.
Yeah.

1006
00:46:12,181 --> 00:46:13,110
And their vegetable garden.
Oh,

1007
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:15,430
they're great for that.
They're great for the.

1008
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,970
They will fuck up some mikes too,
man.

1009
00:46:17,971 --> 00:46:19,710
You ain't never seen nothing like it.
No,

1010
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:22,830
you never said I did not know that.
This is how I found out about it.

1011
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,060
Um,
well one,

1012
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:27,450
one way I found out about it,
a mouse got in the chicken coop and they

1013
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:29,190
fucked that thing up and I was like,
wow,

1014
00:46:29,191 --> 00:46:34,191
that's crazy.
But then another thing happened was my 

1015
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:38,380
daughters found a hawk.
My wife decided in all of you,

1016
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,710
women are always trying to like spruce 
things up.

1017
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,790
She decided she was going to change some
of these fences to a glass fence and the

1018
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:49,791
hawks didn't get the memo and they sat,
they swan dived into this,

1019
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:55,440
this glass wall,
and when we first put up the fence there

1020
00:46:55,441 --> 00:47:00,441
was like three hawks that got fucked up 
and one of them died and we found one of

1021
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:04,260
them that was just kod,
ended up blood coming out of its nose,

1022
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:07,830
like literally it was like a UFC fight.
It was down and fucked up.

1023
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:08,980
So,
uh,

1024
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,560
my daughter's,
uh,

1025
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,690
took this in and they put it in a large 
cardboard box and they had to figure out

1026
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:20,691
how to feed it because it was,
I think it was on Saturday and the 

1027
00:47:20,691 --> 00:47:22,530
wildlife rescue place was not open on 
the weekend.

1028
00:47:22,531 --> 00:47:25,530
And so we had to bring it into a place 
on Monday.

1029
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,310
So over the weekend we went to this pet 
store that we to and they sell something

1030
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:31,420
called pinkies.

1031
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:37,000
It's a very cute term for baby mice that
can't really see yet.

1032
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:39,520
And they're separated from their mother 
and they feed them to snakes.

1033
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:45,310
So mostly reptiles that for him too.
But these hawks would fuck these pinkies

1034
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:50,641
up and so to try to give this hawk some 
food while it was there over the 

1035
00:47:50,641 --> 00:47:55,530
weekend.
So it didn't starve that my daughter's 

1036
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:55,530
brought them the pinkies and there was 
one pinky left,

1037
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:00,370
uh,
that the hawke didn't eat when we 

1038
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:00,370
brought the hock to the wildlife rescue 
place.

1039
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:04,141
So they,
they fix up the Hawk and they told us 

1040
00:48:04,141 --> 00:48:04,141
the Hawk was,
they,

1041
00:48:04,141 --> 00:48:07,060
they took care of its wing and 
eventually they released it back in the 

1042
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:07,060
wild.
So it was a nice story.

1043
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,070
But there's this one pinky leftover and 
the thing was going to die.

1044
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,670
It wasn't with its mother,
it was too small to drink milk.

1045
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:14,290
And they were like,
we want to keep it,

1046
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,820
we want to keep it as a pet.
I'm like,

1047
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:21,300
that doesn't make any sense.
You're just feeding its brothers and 

1048
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:21,300
sisters to this fucking Hawk and now you
guys want to keep it.

1049
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,510
So I said,
listen,

1050
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,920
I think we should feed it to the 
chickens.

1051
00:48:23,921 --> 00:48:25,300
And they're like,
no.

1052
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:25,810
It was like,
well,

1053
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:27,930
what do you guys,
what are you crazy?

1054
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:29,410
You can't keep it.
It's going to die.

1055
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:30,670
Do you understand that?
And they said,

1056
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:31,450
okay,
okay,

1057
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:32,050
okay.
I go,

1058
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,550
well listen.
You don't have to watch.

1059
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:38,640
I'll just go out and do it.
Do I put that fucking thing down and I 

1060
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,861
have never seen those chickens.
So voracious attack that mouse and then 

1061
00:48:43,271 --> 00:48:48,271
they were all chasing the one chicken 
that had the mouse trying to steal it 

1062
00:48:48,271 --> 00:48:48,271
from him.
Watch this.

1063
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,930
Here's the chicken with a mouse right 
here.

1064
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:55,170
Look,
they get a mouse and they have fucked 

1065
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,271
that mouse up man,
and they try to steal it from each 

1066
00:48:57,271 --> 00:48:57,271
other.
I came out tonight,

1067
00:48:57,271 --> 00:49:01,890
tonight,
there's one where a cat is playing with 

1068
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:01,890
a mouse,
a cat.

1069
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,100
You've seen them one with the cat and 
the chicken.

1070
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:06,010
Jamie.
That's the best one because the cat,

1071
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:07,780
everybody thinks of cats is being 
vicious.

1072
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,680
Cats are pretty vicious.
Chickens are fucking dinosaurs,

1073
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:16,681
man.
The way the chicken attacks the mouse 

1074
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:16,681
like here it is.
See,

1075
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:20,290
look at that guy.
He's going to eat this shit out of that 

1076
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:20,290
mouse too.
He's got a.

1077
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:24,000
she's got to keep her eyes open.
Mics or those other constant coming 

1078
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,000
steal her mouth seat.
Look at her.

1079
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,470
They're experts in bobbing and weaving 
and turning their heads,

1080
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:31,660
but so the cat is stocking the mouse and
the chickens like,

1081
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:32,740
bitch,
you don't even know what you're doing.

1082
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:35,380
The chicken just runs in and snatches it
right in front of the cat.

1083
00:49:35,381 --> 00:49:36,890
The cat's like,
seriously?

1084
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,730
Like my mouse.
They're way more ruthless.

1085
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:44,910
I mean,
birds are ruthless creatures and 

1086
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:48,060
chickens in particular are just.
I think it's just a part of their 

1087
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,601
natural diet.
Like when I'm a mouse would get look at 

1088
00:49:51,601 --> 00:49:51,601
this,
see the cat,

1089
00:49:51,601 --> 00:49:51,610
the cat's like,
wow,

1090
00:49:51,611 --> 00:49:54,130
check out this mouse.
I can't believe how lucky I am.

1091
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,440
So he's like,
you know,

1092
00:49:56,441 --> 00:49:58,510
cats for a cat.
Half of it's a game,

1093
00:49:58,570 --> 00:49:59,930
right?
They don't play with it.

1094
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,560
Yeah,
there's chick hanging back.

1095
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:08,070
But as soon as the chicken finds it 
Neema,

1096
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,850
that mouse does not seem scared of that 
chat.

1097
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,900
He's,
he's not scared of it that that mouse 

1098
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:14,900
has talked.
So look at the chickens like fuck you.

1099
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:15,450
Give me that thing.
That is crazy.

1100
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,760
Crazy.
I did not know that about chickens.

1101
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,430
Oh Dude.
They'll fuck up.

1102
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:23,400
It's just the way they do it too fast 
too.

1103
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,380
And they think of it as purely as food.
They're not thinking like the cat,

1104
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,460
it's sport

1105
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:29,990
for the cat.
It's kind of fun.

1106
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,540
Cats probably fully fed and it's a house
cat,

1107
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,270
fat house cat.
He's just looking to kill.

1108
00:50:35,271 --> 00:50:37,160
So that's nature.
That's nature.

1109
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,140
People don't understand that they want 
to,

1110
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,030
they want to remove themselves from it 
and that's great,

1111
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:43,250
but I don't want to understand it.
They didn't want to understand it.

1112
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:48,310
They want something that aligns with 
their ideology and their ideology is 

1113
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:51,590
love and compassion.
Except for people that eat meat and then

1114
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,490
death,
death threats.

1115
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,240
I mean that's really what it is.
It's,

1116
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,830
it's an ideological battle.
And in that sense,

1117
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:05,650
veganism becomes very much like a 
religion because you like,

1118
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:11,110
you support all the people that are on 
your side and the people that are 

1119
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,620
opposed to you are like apostates.
They're like,

1120
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:16,520
they're like the negative people that 
are trying to bring you to the dark side

1121
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:17,120
to hell.

1122
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:22,570
It gets,
it gets really crazy and there's a lot 

1123
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:25,511
of evidence on their side in terms of 
like factory farming and the horrors of 

1124
00:51:25,511 --> 00:51:30,250
factory farming.
And even the really incredibly poor 

1125
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:34,190
modern American diet that they see a lot
of people when they go Vegan,

1126
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:39,460
what they're doing,
one of the best things that they're 

1127
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:39,460
doing is they're eliminating all the 
bullshit.

1128
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:43,160
They're eliminating all the trans fats 
and all the fucking but all the terrible

1129
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:45,740
shit that a lot of people eat that isn't
Vegan.

1130
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,400
But the negative thing is most of them 
were eating diets that are far too 

1131
00:51:51,771 --> 00:51:56,771
carbohydrate rich.
And if they're not getting their blood 

1132
00:51:56,771 --> 00:51:59,471
check,
they don't even know how unhealthy they 

1133
00:51:59,471 --> 00:52:01,451
are.
They convinced themselves they're doing 

1134
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,791
much better than it feeling much better.
But a lack of cholesterol can fuck with 

1135
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:08,261
your hormone functions.
A lot of vegans have low hormones 

1136
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:08,261
because of that.

1137
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:08,261
We,
uh,

1138
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:12,430
one of our regulars Antler,
I was talking to me about his 

1139
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:13,250
experience.
He used to have a organic vegetable farm

1140
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,950
and he's a six foot seven big,
huge,

1141
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:18,380
tall Dutch white guy.
And he goes to me,

1142
00:52:18,381 --> 00:52:19,190
he says,
you know,

1143
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:21,470
uh,
I was Vegan for a long time and had this

1144
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,590
organic vegetable farm.
And I thought that I was doing my body a

1145
00:52:24,591 --> 00:52:25,220
service.
He said,

1146
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,170
I thought I was doing something great 
for my body,

1147
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,870
and he got really sick and he went to 
the doctor and the doctor said,

1148
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:34,871
listen man,
you have to take supplements to 

1149
00:52:34,871 --> 00:52:37,361
supplement the things you're not getting
from from eating meat or you have to go 

1150
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:39,710
back to eating meat because just some 
people's bodies do better than others.

1151
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,580
And I said a lot of Asian cultures are 
more susceptible to to vegetable diets,

1152
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:45,020
but he's like,
in reality he's like,

1153
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,250
you know,
you're a,

1154
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:51,251
you're a northern European descent and 
you need to eat this stuff to be healthy

1155
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:54,410
and that's when he,
he went back to eating meat and it,

1156
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,310
it doesn't matter.

1157
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,160
You know what,
what you're trying to.

1158
00:52:57,161 --> 00:52:57,400
Like,
he,

1159
00:52:57,401 --> 00:52:59,360
he was living on an organic vegetable 
farm.

1160
00:52:59,361 --> 00:53:02,270
Like what,
what more healthy vegetables could he be

1161
00:53:02,271 --> 00:53:03,580
eating?
So B,

1162
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:08,640
12 is a big one and B,
12 essentially only comes from things 

1163
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,791
other than vegetables.
You can get some of it from algae you 

1164
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:12,830
can get.
I mean,

1165
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,410
you definitely can get it from meat.
It's rich and me.

1166
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,630
And the other thing is iron iron.
You know,

1167
00:53:17,631 --> 00:53:18,200
people say,
well,

1168
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:19,880
there's iron and vegetables,
there is,

1169
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:21,900
but it's not very bioavailable,
right?

1170
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,590
A lot of the various vitamins and even 
protein and vegetables,

1171
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:26,160
not very

1172
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,490
bioavailable in most

1173
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:30,120
and is how your body absorbs those 
nutrients as well.

1174
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:31,610
Like it might.
It might be written that that,

1175
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,710
that substance,
but your body can't really absorb it.

1176
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:35,820
Well,
it's just everybody's body's different.

1177
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:39,450
I mean it's just that as an absolute 
fact that there are some people that can

1178
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,480
eat certain diets and be very healthy 
and then other people eat them and they 

1179
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,111
have a really hard time with them.
But the other thing is that most of 

1180
00:53:48,111 --> 00:53:49,140
these people that are talking about how 
healthy and how great they feel,

1181
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:54,141
there's a lot of it is sort of a placebo
effect and they're not getting blood 

1182
00:53:54,141 --> 00:53:57,090
work done at everyone.
Regardless of what your diet is.

1183
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:02,420
You should get blood work done just to 
find out if you have any potential 

1184
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:07,281
problems that are on the horizon because
there's a lot of times you'll feel okay 

1185
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:10,170
and then you get your blood work done 
and the doctor will tell you,

1186
00:54:10,171 --> 00:54:15,171
hey man,
you're really low and vitamin B and d 

1187
00:54:15,171 --> 00:54:17,110
and a and you know you need this and 
that and you know this is this.

1188
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:22,160
The health consequences of not having 
this stuff in your diet and if you are 

1189
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,730
committed to a Vegan diet,
there's ways that you can supplement and

1190
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:27,600
this is my advice to people.
If you want to supplement,

1191
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,330
first of all,
a algae is a great one.

1192
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:35,610
It tastes like shit but it's very good 
for your body and you just add it to 

1193
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:35,990
smoothies,
you know,

1194
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,850
just add it with coconut milk or a bunch
of other things.

1195
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:43,970
You can do it.
I mean you definitely can eat a vegan 

1196
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:43,970
diet and be healthy,
but you got to be on the ball,

1197
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:46,350
you know,
and the [inaudible] one is a big one.

1198
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:51,351
It's a massive amounts.
I was reading some crazy article the 

1199
00:54:51,351 --> 00:54:55,371
other day,
said something like 90 percent of all 

1200
00:54:55,371 --> 00:54:55,371
vegans or B,
12 deficient.

1201
00:54:55,371 --> 00:54:55,980
I've heard this.
I'm not an expert,

1202
00:54:55,981 --> 00:54:58,410
but I've been terrible.
It's terrible.

1203
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:03,860
There's a guy named Chris Kresser that 
I've had on my podcast before who's a 

1204
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:08,300
brilliant guy who is a,
he's an expert in diet nutrition who 

1205
00:55:09,811 --> 00:55:14,811
started out as a macrobiotic Vegan and 
had massive health problems and then 

1206
00:55:15,421 --> 00:55:20,421
switched to eating meat eventually and 
then really became a connoisseur of 

1207
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,950
organ meat,
which is like probably the most nutrient

1208
00:55:22,951 --> 00:55:24,730
dense food in the world.
I love.

1209
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:29,850
I love.
That's my favorite thing about hunting 

1210
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:29,850
as the organ meat.
Me Too,

1211
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:29,850
man.
I love liver,

1212
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:30,490
liver and the heart.
Um,

1213
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:36,330
I,
I went hunting and I came back and I 

1214
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:39,121
brought the heart into the restaurant 
for the guys because I wanted to share 

1215
00:55:39,121 --> 00:55:39,970
with them like the experience of eating,
like fresh killed,

1216
00:55:39,971 --> 00:55:41,770
like the heart was still warm when I 
brought it to work.

1217
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,410
And the way I like to use either tar 
tar,

1218
00:55:44,411 --> 00:55:47,350
like just mince it up raw or cooked like
a steak.

1219
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,920
So I cut it,
you know,

1220
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,380
horizontally in,
into like,

1221
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:53,120
it looks like a tenderloin steak and we 
all got like this,

1222
00:55:53,121 --> 00:55:58,121
like buzz,
like we shot a double espresso or 

1223
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:58,121
something.
It was just like,

1224
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:58,121
whoa.
And it's like,

1225
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,150
it's so nutrient rich,
uh,

1226
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:00,910
the organ meat.

1227
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:06,080
I had Alexander Gustafson,
the podcast yesterday is a UFC number 

1228
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:06,720
one lightweight content light,
heavyweight contender,

1229
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:11,100
big viking motherfucker,
but he gets all of his meat from hunting

1230
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,350
for his training camps and everything 
like that.

1231
00:56:13,351 --> 00:56:15,960
He hunts red deer in Sweden's where he 
lives.

1232
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:21,350
And we were both talking about how when 
you eat really nutrient dense wild game,

1233
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:26,290
it gives you like a stimulated effect.
Like your body is like,

1234
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,760
yeah,
more of this.

1235
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,710
Give me more of this.
It's,

1236
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:31,960
there's something in it.
I don't know what.

1237
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:34,490
And it just tastes.
It tastes like it's supposed to taste.

1238
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,660
You can't explain it.
The flavor is totally different.

1239
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:40,930
Even when we were buying from these 
really cool game farms,

1240
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,290
it's different than the deer that I go 
and shoot and shoot because you know,

1241
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:46,210
that deer I just shot.
It could be like six,

1242
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,880
seven years old versus at the farm,
it's maybe one or two.

1243
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,680
Um,
but again,

1244
00:56:50,681 --> 00:56:53,050
it's eating such a diverse diet and 
it's,

1245
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:58,260
you know,
my belief is that that's how we're 

1246
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:58,260
supposed to be eating.
Well,

1247
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:01,861
it's definitely how we were eating for 
the longest time and it is entirely 

1248
00:57:01,861 --> 00:57:05,110
possible that if humans,
like say if you've got an isolated group

1249
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:10,111
of humans that stuck to a very,
very rigid vegan diet for many,

1250
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:12,190
many,
many generations,

1251
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:16,450
it's entirely possible that our genes 
would adapt to that diet and lifestyle.

1252
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,480
It's totally possible.
The reality of your current physical 

1253
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,931
form is it's most likely not designed 
for that and this is just based on genes

1254
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:30,760
and on genetics and epigenetics and all 
the various things that they've.

1255
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,360
Methods that they've devised to try to 
study.

1256
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:39,750
What makes you a person and where,
where your ancestors came from and how 

1257
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,040
did,
how did your ancestors developed?

1258
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,390
Did they eat mostly fish?

1259
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,260
Like there's people that live like in,
in the northwest,

1260
00:57:47,261 --> 00:57:52,261
like the extreme,
like in Alaska and a inuits and people 

1261
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:54,790
there,
their entire history,

1262
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,880
they've evolved from eating fish and 
wail and whale blubber and seal and seal

1263
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:05,920
fat and there's real changes to who they
are as people.

1264
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,000
Like,
first of all,

1265
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:08,740
one of the big ones is that people that 
live up there,

1266
00:58:08,741 --> 00:58:11,630
their hands don't get cold like ours do 
their hands doing.

1267
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,420
I've heard that when,
when,

1268
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,160
uh,
the indigenous communities,

1269
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:20,230
um,
there was some program where they were 

1270
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:20,230
trying to get them to stop hunting 
whales are and stop killing seals.

1271
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,430
And the government was supplementing 
with them with uh,

1272
00:58:22,431 --> 00:58:23,830
with,
with beef and cattle.

1273
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,530
And their argument was this is not what 
we're supposed to eat.

1274
00:58:26,531 --> 00:58:28,090
This is not what we're designed to eat.
You know,

1275
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:31,540
we need the fat in the whale blubber to 
stay warm.

1276
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:33,400
Yeah.
It's Kinda weird.

1277
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:38,670
It's weird.
Like why would we be forcing these 

1278
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:38,670
people to eat something that was foreign
to them?

1279
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,510
And it's not.
The fat content in beef is way different

1280
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:43,810
than whale and seal.
It's like apples and oranges.

1281
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:44,710
Well,
it's also,

1282
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:47,650
you're looking at what we were talking 
about before,

1283
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:51,670
like white meat from Turkey domestic 
Turkey versus the Turkey.

1284
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:56,671
That's a wild Turkey when you see cows,
but you get these corn fed cows,

1285
00:58:57,491 --> 00:59:02,491
you have this pale meat.
That meat is Pale because it's not as 

1286
00:59:02,491 --> 00:59:04,180
good for you.
It's more filled with fat,

1287
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:06,550
which tastes good,
but it's just.

1288
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:10,120
It's not as nutrient dense.
When you have a moose steak,

1289
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,100
you've seen a moose steak before,
right?

1290
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:14,590
It's fucking.
Yeah,

1291
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:17,820
but it's almost like like purple dark,
dark.

1292
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,630
Yeah.
It's fucking dark,

1293
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:20,890
man.
That's,

1294
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:24,170
that's way different.
It's way different thing.

1295
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,970
That cow is just some.

1296
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:30,560
It's like the fattest laziest person,
you know,

1297
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:35,561
like if you thought about like take an 
athlete like Lebron James Who's just 

1298
00:59:35,561 --> 00:59:39,701
like this super athlete and compare like
the composition of his body to some 

1299
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:43,880
fucking Slob who just drinks soda all 
day and is tired,

1300
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:48,710
is on antidepressants and antibiotics 
because his body's fucking deteriorating

1301
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:51,770
rapidly.
He's got arthritis and all of his joints

1302
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:55,790
because he's too fat.
That literally is a cow that's literally

1303
00:59:55,791 --> 01:00:00,791
one of these fucking farm raised 
overstuffed corn fed cows and they grind

1304
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:04,310
that fat fuck into a hamburger.
It's just not the same.

1305
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:09,410
I'm not endorsing eating Lebron James,
but I'm saying there's a difference in 

1306
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:13,220
what the composition of their body is.
It's a different thing.

1307
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:14,870
It's a very different thing.
Totally.

1308
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,110
Yeah.
I mean I think wild things,

1309
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:23,140
whether it's wild salmon or you know,
even wild vegetables I think would be 

1310
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:23,660
probably

1311
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:27,670
better for you.
So that's a big part of what I do is one

1312
01:00:27,671 --> 01:00:32,671
of the reasons why I love nature so much
as foraging and I take my kids out to 

1313
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:34,540
the woods and we'd go pick mushrooms and
since there were like,

1314
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:35,410
you know,
babies,

1315
01:00:35,411 --> 01:00:37,540
my son has been dragged in the woods 
since he was one.

1316
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:38,830
What kind of mushrooms?
Uh,

1317
01:00:38,831 --> 01:00:41,500
so my favorite one to harvest where I 
live is morals.

1318
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:46,590
Oh yeah.
They're really funky looking to kind of 

1319
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:47,170
look like a brain or something.
Something weird them online.

1320
01:00:47,171 --> 01:00:52,171
I've never seen him in the wild.
There is nothing that tastes quite like 

1321
01:00:52,171 --> 01:00:52,750
them that you can,
you can buy like a meat.

1322
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:58,230
They're very needy,
they're very media and there's a couple 

1323
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,941
different kinds.
There's like black ones and white or 

1324
01:00:59,941 --> 01:00:59,941
yellowish ones.
Um,

1325
01:00:59,941 --> 01:01:04,290
and they're just like,
it's so fascinating to go out into the 

1326
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:06,571
wild and pick your own food and when you
come home and cook it like nothing else 

1327
01:01:06,571 --> 01:01:07,270
tastes like that.
And like mushrooms from the store,

1328
01:01:07,271 --> 01:01:12,271
the totally different.
And it's just something really special 

1329
01:01:12,271 --> 01:01:12,271
that you can go and experience in the 
wild.

1330
01:01:12,271 --> 01:01:14,430
Yeah.
Morels are a real weird

1331
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:19,460
one and I've been reading up on them.
One of the strange things is when 

1332
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:23,061
there's fire forest fires,
they pop up like the neck the next 

1333
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:23,061
season.

1334
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:24,430
They're like cleansing their,
their cleansing the earth.

1335
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,750
I don't,
I'm not a my call just so I don't know.

1336
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,730
Uh,
you know,

1337
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,710
I just enjoy finding them and eating 
them.

1338
01:01:29,711 --> 01:01:34,711
But I do know there's a cleansing 
property to decaying a decaying matter.

1339
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:40,470
So when trees fall down,
like the best place to find Morales is 

1340
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:41,710
a.
I look for trees with no bark on them.

1341
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:43,150
So they're,
they're really super old,

1342
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:47,950
it's called a dead elm tree and they 
like the rotting roots of these dead elm

1343
01:01:47,951 --> 01:01:49,460
trees and you know,
you're,

1344
01:01:49,461 --> 01:01:54,461
you're in the bush and are in the field 
and you kind of see this one tree that 

1345
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:54,461
has no bark on it and it's about to fall
over.

1346
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:57,320
There'll be like 20 morels at the base 
and they're,

1347
01:01:57,321 --> 01:02:02,321
they're kind of,
they're feeding off the root system 

1348
01:02:02,321 --> 01:02:02,321
that's underground.

1349
01:02:02,321 --> 01:02:02,910
Yeah.
I'm absolutely fascinated by mushrooms.

1350
01:02:02,911 --> 01:02:06,190
I had a Paul stamets on the podcast,
so I saw that one.

1351
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,830
How great is that?
Super Cool.

1352
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,530
It was mushroom hat.
Yeah,

1353
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:11,960
that's awesome.
I got to,

1354
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:16,961
gave me too much.
Am I going to do it too in case one 

1355
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:16,961
breaks an extra mushroom hat

1356
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,850
was a really cool documentary.
Um,

1357
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:21,660
uh,
it's called know your mushrooms.

1358
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,330
I think it's by Ron,
by Ron man.

1359
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,230
And he,
he,

1360
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:30,290
he,
he travels along with these mushroom 

1361
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:32,751
hunters a up,
I think a lot of it's in Oregon and up 

1362
01:02:32,751 --> 01:02:32,910
the coast of California down into 
Mexico,

1363
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:37,911
but they're,
they're professional foragers that then 

1364
01:02:37,911 --> 01:02:37,911
go and sell these mushrooms.
Uh,

1365
01:02:37,911 --> 01:02:39,030
but they track these forgers and it's 
such a cool movie.

1366
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,870
That's interesting.
Um,

1367
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:46,190
well I was going to say is you better 
know mushrooms because they'll fucking 

1368
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:46,190
kill you if you don't have that.
That's the thing,

1369
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:46,190
man.
It's like,

1370
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:51,440
you know what,
my first experiencing foraging for 

1371
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,541
mushrooms,
I was like an apprentice chef at this 

1372
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:53,541
restaurant and the chef comes in and was
like,

1373
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:53,541
hey,
check these out.

1374
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:53,820
And I was like,
Whoa,

1375
01:02:53,821 --> 01:02:55,830
like what the hell are these?
And he's like,

1376
01:02:55,831 --> 01:02:56,040
oh,
their,

1377
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:58,420
like,
I found them mountain biking and there's

1378
01:02:58,421 --> 01:02:59,310
this stigma,
you know,

1379
01:02:59,311 --> 01:03:00,270
like as,
as a kid,

1380
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:01,140
like your parents were like,
don't,

1381
01:03:01,141 --> 01:03:02,280
don't eat those,
don't touch those.

1382
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,300
They're poisonous,
they'll kill you.

1383
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:04,020
And it's like,
okay,

1384
01:03:04,021 --> 01:03:05,820
well then you just,
you just have this idea.

1385
01:03:05,821 --> 01:03:10,821
Well,
mushrooms come from the grocery store 

1386
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:10,821
will take.
No,

1387
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:10,821
they grow,
they come in the wild and you know,

1388
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:14,760
that's my thing with me is I teach my 
kids like meat doesn't come from the 

1389
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:14,760
grocery store.
It's not,

1390
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,410
it's not a styrofoam package.
That's not where it comes from.

1391
01:03:16,411 --> 01:03:18,090
It's an animal.
Yeah.

1392
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:19,170
Um,
and,

1393
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,340
and yeah,
and it's just like,

1394
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:25,730
you know,
mushrooms that grow in the wild and 

1395
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:25,730
they're just,
they're crazy.

1396
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:27,990
They like Michael Micro cycle rises.
Yeah.

1397
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:33,440
Michael Riser,
relationship with the animals or with 

1398
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:33,440
the trees rather.
Um,

1399
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,270
do you know the story of the laminated 
Ms Dot area?

1400
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,590
I know what they are.
Uh,

1401
01:03:37,591 --> 01:03:42,591
I don't know the story.
The to miscarry is the most fascinating 

1402
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:45,801
one to me because that's the one that 
looks like it looks like Santa Claus or 

1403
01:03:45,801 --> 01:03:45,801
the marks card with washroom.

1404
01:03:45,801 --> 01:03:50,510
Yeah.
That is the subject of a book by a guy 

1405
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:54,531
named John Marco Allegro who was one of 
the head scholars for deciphering the 

1406
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:02,120
Dead Sea Scrolls.
He deciphered the Dead Sea Scrolls for 

1407
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:02,120
14 years.
He was an ordained minister,

1408
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,931
but he was also in his study of theology
became agnostic and these sort of when 

1409
01:04:05,931 --> 01:04:09,471
you started realizing that there was all
these different religions that had 

1410
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,981
similar stories and he was found all 
these different connections and he was 

1411
01:04:12,981 --> 01:04:14,910
trying,
trying to figure out what the origins of

1412
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:16,410
all these stories where.
Well,

1413
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:21,620
after studying the Dead Sea Scrolls for,
I think it was 14 years before he wrote 

1414
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:25,611
this book,
he decided that all of Christianity was 

1415
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:30,741
a massive misunderstanding,
and what it was originally about was 

1416
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:34,311
these stories,
these collection of stories that were 

1417
01:04:34,311 --> 01:04:36,090
about fertility rituals and psychedelic 
mushroom use,

1418
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:41,570
and he traced the word Jesus back to an 
ancient Sumerian word that was a 

1419
01:04:42,451 --> 01:04:47,451
mushroom covered in God's semen and that
when God would come on the earth,

1420
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:52,791
that's what rain was.
Rain was God coming on the earth and 

1421
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:53,910
that these mushrooms would rise up out 
of the ground.

1422
01:04:53,911 --> 01:04:56,430
They would eat them and trip they're 
fucking balls off.

1423
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,960
That's a crazy story.
So maybe you got to think people that 

1424
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:05,841
were foraging for food,
especially back when there was no 

1425
01:05:05,841 --> 01:05:05,841
agriculture,
right?

1426
01:05:05,841 --> 01:05:06,150
I mean it was,
it was touch and go.

1427
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:09,900
You could easily starve to death.
You mean you're a bad winter.

1428
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,280
You know,
a drought.

1429
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:12,900
People would starve to death.
It was very,

1430
01:05:12,901 --> 01:05:17,901
very common.
So they would take foraging extremely 

1431
01:05:17,951 --> 01:05:18,460
serious,

1432
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,100
and they knew what they could eat and 
they knew what they couldn't eat.

1433
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:26,430
While they knew that there was a 
relationship between coniferous trees 

1434
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:29,520
and coniferous trees would grow these 
weird looking shiny red and white 

1435
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:33,580
mushrooms under him.
That's what coniferous trees,

1436
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,980
pine trees.
That's what we use for Christmas trees.

1437
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,850
Those red and white packages,
they.

1438
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:42,400
They are like the shiny packages 
underneath the Christmas tree.

1439
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:47,020
They are the color of Santa Claus.
There are common inside barrier.

1440
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:51,550
There are eaten constantly by Caribou.
Caribou are reindeer.

1441
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:56,730
Reindeer are addicted to these to the 
point where when people are having 

1442
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:58,450
psychedelic mushroom rituals and they go
outside to take a leak,

1443
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:03,840
the Karabal will knock them over to get 
to the Amany to miscarry a piss in the 

1444
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:08,371
sand because they smell the Amanita 
Mascara in the pis and one of the ways 

1445
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:14,281
these guys trip their balls off as they 
eat the mushroom and then they drink 

1446
01:06:14,281 --> 01:06:15,820
their own urine,
has a second process of this.

1447
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:21,150
Here's where it gets even crazier in the
times in Siberia where it become 

1448
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:22,900
extremely snowy.
When this shaman would visit,

1449
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:28,020
the way they would get into the house is
through the fucking chimney because the 

1450
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:29,800
door would be snowed in so they would 
climb in through the chimney.

1451
01:06:29,801 --> 01:06:32,830
I mean,
there's so many parallels to Santa Claus

1452
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:38,040
and to Christianity to this one mushroom
that they think was a massive part of 

1453
01:06:38,711 --> 01:06:40,900
shamanistic rituals.
There it is right there.

1454
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,640
This is this Rudolph,
the red nose reindeer.

1455
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:43,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

1456
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:46,240
Oh,
that is such a cool story.

1457
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:47,770
Oh Dude.
It's fucking crazy.

1458
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:52,771
So he wrote this book called the Sacred 
Mushroom in the cross that was bought 

1459
01:06:52,771 --> 01:06:54,580
out by the Catholic Church.
This I have to verify,

1460
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,550
but I do know that they stopped 
production of it.

1461
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:59,500
I don't know if it was bought out by the
Catholic Church.

1462
01:06:59,501 --> 01:07:00,820
That's always been what's been told to 
me,

1463
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,610
but I do know that they stopped 
production of it forever.

1464
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:07,450
Um,
he came out with another book called the

1465
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:10,090
Dead Sea Scrolls in the Christian myth,
which is still available.

1466
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:12,820
Then more recently,
like really recently,

1467
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:14,610
within the last decade,
uh,

1468
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:19,830
a guy named Yon Irvin republished the 
John Marco Allegro books with permission

1469
01:07:20,111 --> 01:07:22,030
from his family.
I think it might've actually been one of

1470
01:07:22,031 --> 01:07:25,360
those things where when a book is over 
25 years old,

1471
01:07:25,361 --> 01:07:27,580
it becomes public domain or something 
like that too,

1472
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:33,150
but this,
this book and this story behind it is 

1473
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:37,140
incredibly fascinating and what he's 
basically saying is that it makes sense 

1474
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:42,390
if you were living thousands of years 
ago when you stumbled upon these 

1475
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:43,600
psychedelic mushrooms and you took them,
you would experience God.

1476
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:48,630
You literally would think that that 
psychedelic state was you communicating 

1477
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:52,411
with God.
They would want to hide those from the 

1478
01:07:52,411 --> 01:07:52,411
Romans.
So they hid them in parables and stories

1479
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:57,450
and he explains what the original 
meaning of all these parables and 

1480
01:07:57,450 --> 01:08:00,961
stories are.
Because of course you're going from 

1481
01:08:00,961 --> 01:08:03,930
ancient Hebrew,
which is extremely complicated language 

1482
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:06,391
that also involves numbers.
The letters are also numbers and then 

1483
01:08:06,391 --> 01:08:07,870
that's translated to Latin and Greek and
then eventually to English.

1484
01:08:07,871 --> 01:08:12,871
So a lot is lost in that translation.
So it really takes a linguist and a 

1485
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,100
biblical scholar to kind of understand 
whether

1486
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,290
or not what this guy is saying is 
correct.

1487
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,290
I'm obviously not one of those,
so I'm just talking shit,

1488
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:24,200
but it's uh,
there's so many parallels.

1489
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:29,201
It's almost like,
how could it be just coincidental that 

1490
01:08:29,201 --> 01:08:30,380
Santa Claus is red and white at Santa 
Claus legs reindeers,

1491
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:35,530
that the Christmas tree is something 
that we used in the presence or under 

1492
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:36,560
the Christmas tree that Santa Claus 
lives the fucking North Pole,

1493
01:08:36,561 --> 01:08:39,800
which is Siberia,
which is where Caribou live in,

1494
01:08:39,801 --> 01:08:41,360
which is where these mushrooms are very 
common.

1495
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,250
I mean,
there's so many parallels.

1496
01:08:43,251 --> 01:08:45,080
It's really kind of fucking crazy.
That's cool.

1497
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:46,580
Yeah.
It's a great book.

1498
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:49,640
Anybody I really highly recommend it 
because it's one of those books.

1499
01:08:49,641 --> 01:08:51,860
We just got to read a few chapters and 
you got to go.

1500
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:56,861
Okay.
I think I may have to go back over that 

1501
01:08:56,861 --> 01:08:56,861
again.
We'll go over and again.

1502
01:08:56,861 --> 01:08:56,861
So it's,
it's so freaky.

1503
01:08:56,861 --> 01:09:01,710
Very cool.
But I've stumbled upon those in the 

1504
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:01,900
wild.
Those never found those.

1505
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:03,710
There's like,
you have to cook them first.

1506
01:09:03,711 --> 01:09:05,030
You can eat them raw.
You have to boil them.

1507
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:08,090
We will make you sick apparently if you 
don't do it right.

1508
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:09,590
Um,
but yeah,

1509
01:09:09,591 --> 01:09:09,910
no,
I,

1510
01:09:09,911 --> 01:09:13,110
I forge more for Merelda my favorite.
Uh,

1511
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:18,200
Shannon Charles,
obviously like awesome culinary 

1512
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:18,200
mushrooms.
Uh,

1513
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,700
what's that yellow one that grows on 
trees?

1514
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:21,980
It's like a thick,
a chicken of the woods.

1515
01:09:21,981 --> 01:09:26,981
Yes.
That one's real and it tastes like 

1516
01:09:26,981 --> 01:09:26,981
chicken.
It is unbelievable.

1517
01:09:26,981 --> 01:09:26,981
That one's amazing.
It's really funky.

1518
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:32,110
We found I was walking with the kids and
a park downtown Toronto and I look over 

1519
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:32,420
and there's this massive,
it's on my instagram,

1520
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:37,810
a massive yellow kinda looks like goo 
growing on this tree and it was a 

1521
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:41,510
premature chicken of the woods and it 
just looked like this blob and then if I

1522
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:46,511
were to leave it,
it would start to kind of a shelf out 

1523
01:09:46,511 --> 01:09:46,511
into like shelf kind of mushrooms.

1524
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:49,980
And so I left it for like a week and 
went back and harvested and it's like,

1525
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:51,950
it's like tender,
juicy chicken flavor.

1526
01:09:51,951 --> 01:09:53,720
It is bizarre.
Oh that's Kinda cool.

1527
01:09:53,721 --> 01:09:58,721
So you were just hoping nobody else saw 
and thing and it wasn't like a really 

1528
01:09:58,721 --> 01:10:00,260
public park and I was like,
Oh man,

1529
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:02,360
like I better get this before someone 
else finds it.

1530
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:07,680
Wow.
How many people would know in a public 

1531
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:07,680
park in Toronto?
Uh,

1532
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:07,680
there's a few.
There's,

1533
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:07,730
there's Wsu.
I've,

1534
01:10:07,731 --> 01:10:11,120
I've kind of walked up to ladies like 
picking herbs and stuff and I was like,

1535
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:12,260
Hey,
like what do you do?

1536
01:10:12,261 --> 01:10:14,300
And then they kind of looked at me and 
kind of went away.

1537
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:15,910
They didn't want to share their 
knowledge with me.

1538
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:16,870
Here it is,
there it is.

1539
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,880
So that's the bizarre man zoo.
Zookeeper.

1540
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:22,460
And I was like,
I was so pumped.

1541
01:10:22,461 --> 01:10:23,300
I was so excited.

1542
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,880
Face you make you look like Krista Leah 
there.

1543
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:32,000
But that's hilarious.
Oh that's so cool.

1544
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:36,530
It's like a little tiny one below it on 
trees.

1545
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:37,580
I don't know.
I think.

1546
01:10:37,581 --> 01:10:39,860
Well that one you can see the bark is 
deteriorating.

1547
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:40,460
So again,
it's,

1548
01:10:40,461 --> 01:10:43,460
it's a,
it's feeding off the decaying a treat.

1549
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,920
So look how bad asset.
So if that,

1550
01:10:45,921 --> 01:10:47,930
if you actually go.
And I found ones like that too.

1551
01:10:47,931 --> 01:10:52,931
If you go in and harvest those,
they're really woody by that time and 

1552
01:10:52,931 --> 01:10:52,931
they're,
they're kind of a little too tough.

1553
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:54,460
Oh really?
Um,

1554
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:59,590
so yeah,
you wanna you wanna get them when 

1555
01:10:59,590 --> 01:10:59,590
they're younger like that.
So is there a color change?

1556
01:10:59,590 --> 01:10:59,680
Um,
I,

1557
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:00,630
I get,
I guess when,

1558
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:05,690
when they're older they get a bit more 
orange from that kind of yellow 

1559
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:06,110
premature stacy,
that one where there's like yellow,

1560
01:11:06,111 --> 01:11:07,490
yellow.
Those are like perfect.

1561
01:11:07,491 --> 01:11:08,150
Yeah,
right there.

1562
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:08,930
Perfect.
Yeah.

1563
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:11,840
Oh Wow.
That looks like almost like cauliflower.

1564
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:12,530
Totally.
Yeah.

1565
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:13,350
It's really,
really neat.

1566
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:14,490
Wow.

1567
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:15,480
It's fascinating.
You know,

1568
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:16,050
the,
the,

1569
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:18,690
the mushroom world is,
is a super cool.

1570
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:21,150
Do you know they breathe air.
I did not know that.

1571
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:23,460
They breathe air,
they breathe out carbon dioxide,

1572
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,620
you're closer to animals and they are 
the vegetables.

1573
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,120
That's really cool.
And they're weird.

1574
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,710
Fungus is a weird thing.
Then one,

1575
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:33,150
a lot of it's like I'm misunderstood.
Well,

1576
01:11:33,151 --> 01:11:34,630
I,
I guess I was,

1577
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,840
I was watching the podcast with them,
with the mushroom guy.

1578
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:40,010
Yeah.
Shout out to Paul Depaul.

1579
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:42,180
Um,
but like a lot of it is,

1580
01:11:42,181 --> 01:11:44,530
is still being learned today of,
of,

1581
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:46,470
of the impact on,
on the earth.

1582
01:11:46,471 --> 01:11:51,471
And when what they do.
Did you hear a story about how would he 

1583
01:11:51,471 --> 01:11:54,291
take 10 grams of psilocybin mushrooms 
and climbed a tree was in a lightning 

1584
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:56,640
storm and like connected to the fucking 
universe,

1585
01:11:56,641 --> 01:11:57,570
first time ever doing it.
Right.

1586
01:11:57,571 --> 01:11:58,740
And he just don't ever do it.

1587
01:11:58,740 --> 01:11:59,700
Yeah,
he did that.

1588
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:01,310
I think he was in high school,
right?

1589
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,640
Or some.
Somewhere around that.

1590
01:12:02,641 --> 01:12:03,810
Very young.
Yeah.

1591
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:04,980
Crazy.
He's awesome.

1592
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:10,490
Such a trip though,
and I was reading the filicides is 

1593
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:12,120
linked to your and curing depression and
things like that,

1594
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:13,410
which,
which I don't know a lot about,

1595
01:12:13,411 --> 01:12:16,380
but it's fascinating the effects they 
have on,

1596
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:17,130
on,
uh,

1597
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:22,310
on people.
John Hopkins is doing some studies on 

1598
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:23,280
them.
The most fascinating of all the mushroom

1599
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:28,110
theories is by the late great terence 
Mckenna and his brother Dennis Mckenna,

1600
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:33,140
who's still alive and a scientist 
explained it on my first podcast with 

1601
01:12:33,271 --> 01:12:34,560
him.
So if anybody's interested,

1602
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:39,570
find that in downloaded.
It's Dennis is a brilliant guy and this 

1603
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:45,510
theory is called the stoned ape theory.
And this coincides what we were talking 

1604
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:48,030
about about hunting and con con,
consumption of meat.

1605
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:53,280
I'm leading to us becoming humans.
There's a doubling of the human brain 

1606
01:12:53,431 --> 01:12:55,440
size over a period of 2 million years.

1607
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:59,340
It's like apparently one of the biggest 
mysteries in the fossil record.

1608
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:04,370
They do not understand why something so 
important like the thing that actually 

1609
01:13:04,891 --> 01:13:09,891
created the theory of evolution,
explained evolution like this very 

1610
01:13:12,541 --> 01:13:16,650
Oregon doubled over a period of 2 
million years and you don't know why.

1611
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:22,070
Terrence believes that the reason 
coincided with climate change and that 

1612
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:26,511
as the climate changed,
these rain forest receded into 

1613
01:13:26,511 --> 01:13:30,531
grasslands and these lower hominids like
our ancestors came down from the trees 

1614
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:35,781
and started experimenting with new food 
sources and one of the things they 

1615
01:13:35,781 --> 01:13:38,610
experimented with with psychedelic 
mushrooms and that through Psilocybin,

1616
01:13:38,611 --> 01:13:40,860
which they found by flipping over cow 
patties.

1617
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:43,200
A couple things happened.
One,

1618
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,310
it increased visual acuity mushrooms,
especially in low doses,

1619
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,490
increased visual acuity which would make
them better hunters.

1620
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,220
They could see better,
made them more intuitive,

1621
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:58,250
made them more creative.
And also the way Dennis explains the 

1622
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:59,640
effect of Psilocybin on the brain.

1623
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:04,640
He was saying that it could have 
possibly led to the development of 

1624
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,821
language and that all of this could have
come out of the consumption of 

1625
01:14:07,821 --> 01:14:09,390
psychedelic mushrooms.
It's fucking intense,

1626
01:14:09,391 --> 01:14:12,160
man.
Terrence called it stoned ape theory.

1627
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:16,240
That's what he,
that's how he thinks we became human.

1628
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,490
That's amazing.
Yeah,

1629
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:21,160
it sounds stupid.
It sounds stupid until you do mushrooms.

1630
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:22,960
Yeah,
that makes sense.

1631
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:23,950
Then you go,
oh,

1632
01:14:23,951 --> 01:14:25,010
okay.
Okay.

1633
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:26,350
Okay.
Maybe.

1634
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:27,220
Yeah,
maybe.

1635
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:28,870
Yeah,
I is this illegal.

1636
01:14:28,871 --> 01:14:29,800
Then you start going,
what?

1637
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:31,540
Everybody should do this.
Oh my God.

1638
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:33,130
Everybody should do this.
Now.

1639
01:14:33,131 --> 01:14:35,720
When you first started cooking,
um,

1640
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:37,870
did when,
how old were you when you became a chef?

1641
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:39,460
Um,
well,

1642
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:41,740
it's kind of a fluke.
Funny Story.

1643
01:14:41,741 --> 01:14:46,741
Um,
I was a 13 year old kid and I wanted a 

1644
01:14:46,741 --> 01:14:46,741
part time job,
you know,

1645
01:14:46,741 --> 01:14:47,710
like a newspaper route or something like
that.

1646
01:14:47,711 --> 01:14:52,711
And I went to,
I lived in a little town on this horse 

1647
01:14:52,711 --> 01:14:55,561
farm in the country and I rode my bike 
down to this gas station and I applied 

1648
01:14:55,661 --> 01:14:59,860
to pump gas and this guy had a diner on 
the corner and was like,

1649
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:01,690
hey man,
like I don't need anyone to pump gas but

1650
01:15:01,691 --> 01:15:06,691
can you cook?
And I grew up cooking at home with my 

1651
01:15:06,691 --> 01:15:09,211
mom because she would work late and she 
would call me on her way home and tell 

1652
01:15:09,211 --> 01:15:09,211
me how to start dinner,
be like,

1653
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,500
turn on the oven,
get the chicken out of the fridge,

1654
01:15:11,501 --> 01:15:13,000
get the shake and bake and,
you know,

1655
01:15:13,001 --> 01:15:18,001
she would walk me through it and I'd 
start dinner and she'd get home and 

1656
01:15:18,001 --> 01:15:18,001
finish it.

1657
01:15:18,001 --> 01:15:18,001
So I totally,
yeah,

1658
01:15:18,001 --> 01:15:20,890
I can cook or whatever.
And he had had me in there,

1659
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:25,891
you know,
like dropping the fry baskets and 

1660
01:15:25,891 --> 01:15:28,321
flipping eggs and you know,
doing the brunch shift on the weekend 

1661
01:15:28,321 --> 01:15:29,230
and it just stuck.
It's one of those things that uh,

1662
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:30,550
you just kind of grow up doing.
I,

1663
01:15:30,551 --> 01:15:35,551
you know,
I wanted money to buy skateboards and 

1664
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:35,551
pot and stupid shit.
And um,

1665
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:35,551
yeah,
just,

1666
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,880
it just kind of stuck.
And then,

1667
01:15:36,881 --> 01:15:41,881
uh,
all through high school I had a job 

1668
01:15:41,881 --> 01:15:42,370
cooking and I really started to struggle
with it because,

1669
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:43,870
uh,
you know,

1670
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:48,871
I was taking all these world issues 
courses and learning about the 

1671
01:15:48,871 --> 01:15:51,991
environment and watching these 
documentaries about food and I didn't 

1672
01:15:51,991 --> 01:15:51,991
know,
you know,

1673
01:15:51,991 --> 01:15:55,161
how being a chef could help change the 
world and how am I going to make a 

1674
01:15:55,161 --> 01:15:55,790
difference as a chef.
Um,

1675
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:57,190
and then,
uh,

1676
01:15:57,191 --> 01:16:02,191
and then I had,
I had my daughter when I was 19 and I 

1677
01:16:02,191 --> 01:16:02,260
had all this experience cooking and I 
thought,

1678
01:16:02,261 --> 01:16:02,620
well,
you know,

1679
01:16:02,621 --> 01:16:05,590
I'm just gonna go to chef school and uh,
and make a go of this.

1680
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:08,020
Like I've got all this experience.
I'm already this far ahead.

1681
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:09,520
And uh,
it was,

1682
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:14,050
it was having kids at such a young age 
that really made me focus and was like,

1683
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:16,000
okay,
like I have a job to do.

1684
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:18,340
And uh,
I fell in love with food.

1685
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:19,540
Uh,
I,

1686
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:24,541
you know,
it was a 17 year old kid with a 

1687
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:24,541
vegetable garden,
like who does that,

1688
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:24,541
you know,
and uh,

1689
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:27,580
and then I got into hunting and foraging
and learning about food and I just,

1690
01:16:27,581 --> 01:16:31,150
I totally just fell in love with it.
And so how did antler come about?

1691
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:32,980
He brought a bunch.
A bunch of these.

1692
01:16:32,981 --> 01:16:34,330
Yeah.
So this photo,

1693
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:35,950
uh,
I actually took this photo.

1694
01:16:35,951 --> 01:16:40,951
It's blown up in the restaurant.
All the green on the ground is a wild 

1695
01:16:40,951 --> 01:16:41,320
leeks.
So in the spring.

1696
01:16:41,321 --> 01:16:44,050
And I actually took this Turkey hunting,
um,

1697
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:45,370
and I looked over and was like,
well,

1698
01:16:45,371 --> 01:16:46,300
cool,
that's amazing.

1699
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:49,750
And just took the photo postcard.
This is actually a sketch.

1700
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:52,990
My friend did have a,
have a deer skull that I shot.

1701
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:54,820
Um,
so anyway,

1702
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:56,850
lyric came about because,
um,

1703
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,850
I worked for a celebrity chef.
Uh,

1704
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,200
he gave me his cookbook and I was 
hunting and foraging,

1705
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:02,590
doing all the stuff and I thought,
well,

1706
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,000
you know,
one of the ways I can make an impact in 

1707
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,000
the world that I can teach people about 
what I'm doing.

1708
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And,
uh,

1709
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,640
I went and got a,
I got a camera and I would take it with 

1710
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,641
me and shoot photos like this,
and I wanted to teach people about 

1711
01:17:15,641 --> 01:17:17,420
hunting and foraging because what I was 
doing is not new.

1712
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:18,530
It's really,
really old.

1713
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,450
But,
uh,

1714
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:21,110
you know,
people seem to have forgotten about it,

1715
01:17:21,111 --> 01:17:22,760
you know,
at least people in the cities anyway,

1716
01:17:22,761 --> 01:17:24,860
people don't really know much about it.

1717
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:25,520
So I thought,
you know,

1718
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:27,800
I'm going to help educate,
you know,

1719
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:32,860
a modern civilization about hunting and 
foraging and this'll be like my make a 

1720
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:33,800
difference in the world.
And,

1721
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:39,580
uh,
I ended up hanging out with a really 

1722
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:39,580
good friend of mine,
um,

1723
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,690
one of my best friends today.
And he's a family friend,

1724
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,270
a documentary film maker by the name of 
Jody Shapiro.

1725
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:46,070
Um,
and,

1726
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:47,510
you know,
we had this deal and you said,

1727
01:17:47,511 --> 01:17:47,900
you know,
I'll,

1728
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:50,540
I'll help you with the photos if you 
teach me how to cook.

1729
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:55,570
And he was,
he was taking some culinary courses at 

1730
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:56,330
the local college just as a hobby.
And,

1731
01:17:56,331 --> 01:17:56,910
uh,
you know,

1732
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:59,150
we started hanging out and shooting this
cookbook.

1733
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:04,210
And um,
we started to kind of get some press 

1734
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:04,210
about it,
um,

1735
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:08,430
you know,
eater magazine did this article on us 

1736
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:11,141
and we started doing these game dinners 
out of his house and he had this really 

1737
01:18:11,141 --> 01:18:11,850
nice condo and so I put on this game 
dinner,

1738
01:18:11,851 --> 01:18:16,490
I sold tickets and I knew there were 
laws about serving game and restaurant.

1739
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:17,960
So in Canada,
and I appreciate the,

1740
01:18:17,961 --> 01:18:18,830
u.
s is pretty similar.

1741
01:18:18,831 --> 01:18:20,780
You can't serve wild game in a 
restaurant.

1742
01:18:20,781 --> 01:18:23,180
So there's public health.
Excuse me,

1743
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,630
I'm amit has to be inspected through a 
slaughterhouse.

1744
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:29,110
Europe is different.
You can kind of do whatever in Europe.

1745
01:18:29,111 --> 01:18:34,111
But so I thought okay cool,
we'll have this game dinner out of his 

1746
01:18:34,111 --> 01:18:34,420
house and we're in the clear.
But with the,

1747
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:37,100
with the Ministry of natural resources,
you can't sell game meat.

1748
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:40,090
So for any kind of profit,
but we weren't profiting off it.

1749
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:41,710
We just going to have some fun.
Um,

1750
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:44,570
and we do this game dinner,
a local paper,

1751
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:46,820
a national paper actually wanting to buy
a ticket.

1752
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:51,850
They came,
we thought they're going to write this 

1753
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:53,621
little blurb about it.
They did a two page spread in the 

1754
01:18:53,621 --> 01:18:53,621
national newspaper about this game 
dinner.

1755
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:55,760
So we started to get all this press 
about it.

1756
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,560
And um,
we just said,

1757
01:18:57,561 --> 01:18:58,070
hey,
let's,

1758
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,000
let's open a restaurant.
Let's,

1759
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:01,010
let's have a home where we can,
we can,

1760
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:02,240
you know,
work on this book,

1761
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:07,630
possibly shoot some documentary and 
really just have fun and explore a 

1762
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:12,190
Canadian cuisine.
It's something that I'm really 

1763
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:13,490
passionate about.
Something that really hasn't really been

1764
01:19:13,491 --> 01:19:18,491
defined.
There's a bunch of people trying to 

1765
01:19:18,491 --> 01:19:18,491
define it.
Um,

1766
01:19:18,491 --> 01:19:18,491
you know,
and,

1767
01:19:18,491 --> 01:19:18,491
and,
uh,

1768
01:19:18,491 --> 01:19:23,410
and it was just sort of our home.
Now when you say Canadian cuisine or 

1769
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:25,280
these traditional recipes,
or are they improvise?

1770
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:25,760
Well,
I,

1771
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,560
you know,
a lot of it is improvised.

1772
01:19:27,561 --> 01:19:28,970
It's a lot of,
it's my take on it.

1773
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,020
Um,
you know,

1774
01:19:30,021 --> 01:19:35,021
I,
I definitely want to do some more kind 

1775
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:35,021
of studying about native and indigenous 
cooking.

1776
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:35,500
Um,
you know,

1777
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:38,300
traveling across the country,
something that I want to do and learning

1778
01:19:38,301 --> 01:19:41,200
from the indigenous communities.
Um,

1779
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:43,370
but sort of my take on it is,
you know,

1780
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:45,650
if there,
if there wasn't these farmed animals,

1781
01:19:45,651 --> 01:19:47,000
what would be,
what would we eat?

1782
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:48,050
And for me,
it's,

1783
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:49,670
it's morals,
it's maple syrup,

1784
01:19:49,671 --> 01:19:54,671
it's the wild leeks in this photo,
it's deer and Turkey and rabbit and 

1785
01:19:54,671 --> 01:19:58,510
these things we all serve at antler 
because that's what's growing around us 

1786
01:19:58,510 --> 01:19:59,030
in Canada.
It's wild fish.

1787
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:04,150
And thanks again for the map.
I'm going to have to break my diet to 

1788
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:07,470
enjoy some of this liquid ious looking 
richest looking.

1789
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:11,040
Ever seen that,
that looks amazing.

1790
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:15,630
So I was telling you earlier that takes 
18 liters of sap boiled down to make one

1791
01:20:15,631 --> 01:20:20,631
liter of syrup.
And the cool part is you can drink the 

1792
01:20:20,631 --> 01:20:20,631
sap.
It's a natural,

1793
01:20:20,631 --> 01:20:24,831
uh,
it's full of a lot of natural 

1794
01:20:24,831 --> 01:20:24,831
electrolytes and minerals.
So it's Kinda like a coconut water,

1795
01:20:24,831 --> 01:20:29,730
a type of beverage.
What's crazy to me is how someone 

1796
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:31,500
figured out to do that and they've been 
doing it for hundreds of years,

1797
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:32,560
right?
Yeah.

1798
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:34,740
Super Cool.
And it happens only you can only make it

1799
01:20:34,741 --> 01:20:39,330
in the spring when it's freezing at 
night and it was during the day.

1800
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:44,630
And what happens is the tree roots are 
sucking up as much water as it can to 

1801
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:45,350
feed the buds that it's trying to,
uh,

1802
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,100
to make,
to make leaves again.

1803
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:48,550
How the fuck did anybody figure that 
out?

1804
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:53,390
No idea.
Take the sap from the trees like that.

1805
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:54,250
So simple.
It's,

1806
01:20:54,251 --> 01:20:55,880
it's really,
really cool to when,

1807
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:56,700
when you,
when you go,

1808
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,050
you know,
you drill a hole in the tree,

1809
01:20:58,051 --> 01:21:01,410
you put in this little tap and hang a 
bucket and it just drips out and.

1810
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:06,430
Wow.
And how long does it take to drip when 

1811
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:10,611
it's,
when it's like kind of perfect 

1812
01:21:10,611 --> 01:21:12,531
conditions.
I put up these 16 liter buckets and 

1813
01:21:12,531 --> 01:21:12,531
within like three or four days they're 
full.

1814
01:21:12,531 --> 01:21:13,170
Oh Wow.
So it's cool.

1815
01:21:13,171 --> 01:21:15,150
It's fun.
And it gets me out in the woods.

1816
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:17,940
I call it my spring training because I'm
lugging around all these buckets,

1817
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:18,260
you know.

1818
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:18,870
Oh,
okay.

1819
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:21,380
That's great.
So that's awesome.

1820
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:26,381
That winter fat off.
So when you were talking about 

1821
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:26,381
indigenous people,
how they would cook their food,

1822
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,020
what have you learned?
Any of those dishes yet?

1823
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,610
Um,
I have,

1824
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:30,350
um,
like I said,

1825
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,280
I'm not an expert,
but it's something I'm,

1826
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:34,110
we're,
we're going to be kind of studying,

1827
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:35,290
moving forward are,
you know,

1828
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:36,450
the growth of Antler,
you know,

1829
01:21:36,451 --> 01:21:38,430
where do we go from here?
Um,

1830
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:39,570
and you know,
as I mentioned,

1831
01:21:39,571 --> 01:21:44,571
my,
my business partner is a documentary 

1832
01:21:44,571 --> 01:21:44,571
guy,
so we,

1833
01:21:44,571 --> 01:21:46,931
we,
we want to travel and travel across the 

1834
01:21:46,931 --> 01:21:46,931
country and learn really what that is.
Um,

1835
01:21:46,931 --> 01:21:49,140
there's so many different indigenous 
communities in Canada.

1836
01:21:49,141 --> 01:21:51,150
Canada is on three coasts,
uh,

1837
01:21:51,151 --> 01:21:52,500
you know,
much like the states with Alaska,

1838
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:57,501
you know,
you don't really think of the Arctic up 

1839
01:21:57,501 --> 01:21:57,501
there,
but uh,

1840
01:21:57,501 --> 01:21:58,380
you know,
there's three ocean that ocean,

1841
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:02,440
so it's not an ocean to walk across it.

1842
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:05,060
It's frozen.
But uh,

1843
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:06,200
yeah,
it's uh,

1844
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:08,580
it's something that I definitely want to
learn more about.

1845
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:11,310
Um,
like how would they cook Moose,

1846
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,650
you know?
Um,

1847
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:18,200
a lot of it would be open fire in a lot 
of it's raw seal meat and whale blubber,

1848
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,050
you know,
they don't,

1849
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:21,360
like in the Arctic,
they don't have a lot of wood to burn,

1850
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:26,780
you know,
and they would have like a oil lamps 

1851
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:26,780
from the oil,
from the blubber.

1852
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:26,970
But uh,
you know,

1853
01:22:26,971 --> 01:22:29,070
a lot of the cooking is raw.
Yeah.

1854
01:22:29,071 --> 01:22:32,510
Steven Rinella went to new Nevada.
Is that a new event?

1855
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:32,880
Yeah,
yeah,

1856
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:34,350
something like that.
I think it's been,

1857
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,230
I think there's,
yeah,

1858
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:42,260
the North Northwest Territories and 
there's new boot and they were eating a 

1859
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:46,710
lot of fish,
frozen fish that was dipped in seal oil,

1860
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:49,740
dip the fish and seal oil,
eat it.

1861
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:53,650
They have a tremendous amount of oil and
fat in their diet,

1862
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,740
you know,
which kind of makes sense.

1863
01:22:55,741 --> 01:22:56,610
Got It.
Yeah.

1864
01:22:58,190 --> 01:23:03,190
I mean they're,
they're up there in the coldest of cold 

1865
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:05,721
climates.
One of the things we do this kind of 

1866
01:23:05,721 --> 01:23:05,721
cool is uh,
uh,

1867
01:23:05,721 --> 01:23:06,160
I know the native in the indigenous 
cultures

1868
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:11,160
would,
would make cedar tea and it's full of 

1869
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:15,220
vitamin C and minerals and nutrients.
But we do a cedar a sorbet.

1870
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,780
So we boil cedar leaves and then I just 
add sugar and make it into like an ice.

1871
01:23:19,781 --> 01:23:22,540
So it's a frozen kind of survey,
which is really cool.

1872
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:23,260
And it's,
it's like,

1873
01:23:23,261 --> 01:23:24,010
uh,
when you eat it,

1874
01:23:24,011 --> 01:23:25,610
it's like the forest and your mouth,
it's really,

1875
01:23:25,611 --> 01:23:27,790
really easy.
And then you get the cedar from.

1876
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:32,910
We just go into the woods and cut it 
down and we'll bring that into the 

1877
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:36,061
restaurant.
There's all kinds of cool stuff that we 

1878
01:23:36,061 --> 01:23:36,061
do that we,
you know,

1879
01:23:36,061 --> 01:23:38,791
because I go up,
I try and be in nature a couple times a 

1880
01:23:38,791 --> 01:23:38,791
week,
um,

1881
01:23:38,791 --> 01:23:40,620
and I'll go and forage for all this 
stuff and bring it into antler.

1882
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:45,680
Uh,
another way we use the cedar isn't a 

1883
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:45,680
cocktail.
We do a cedar gin sour,

1884
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:48,450
so we infuse,
infuse the gin with a,

1885
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:50,170
with cedar leaves for like a week.

1886
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:53,470
And then we shake that with some simple 
syrup and make me hungry.

1887
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:55,330
So when you,
um,

1888
01:23:55,360 --> 01:24:00,280
it's interesting that when you go to the
woods to forage for plant life,

1889
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:01,800
it's totally legal.
Yeah.

1890
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,050
You could sell it.
Yeah.

1891
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,070
But if you forge for animal life,
you can't do that.

1892
01:24:06,071 --> 01:24:11,071
I think that is because of market 
hunting that really decimated most of 

1893
01:24:11,381 --> 01:24:16,381
the population of North American game 
animals in the 18 hundreds and early 

1894
01:24:16,381 --> 01:24:17,680
into the 19 hundreds.
Like mo.

1895
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:21,640
Most people associate that with the 
death of the buffalo,

1896
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:22,610
the,
uh,

1897
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:23,730
it makes sense.
And I think,

1898
01:24:23,731 --> 01:24:28,731
I think if there,
there are ways to do it where it could 

1899
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:31,351
be controlled.
I don't think I could hunt enough Meat 

1900
01:24:31,351 --> 01:24:31,351
for the,
for the restaurant,

1901
01:24:31,351 --> 01:24:33,040
but five seats,
45 seats.

1902
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:35,680
But you know what I,
I do think I do think that,

1903
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:40,950
you know,
I think it's people's right to be able 

1904
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:40,950
to eat wild meat.

1905
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:41,350
I think that as a human being,
you have the right to try that.

1906
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:43,480
And if you're not a hunter,
if you don't know how to go do it,

1907
01:24:43,481 --> 01:24:45,640
you have the right to at least try it.
Um,

1908
01:24:45,670 --> 01:24:50,670
and I do know in newfoundland they're 
allowed to serve wild game and the 

1909
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:54,991
hunter has to go and get a permit to 
sell and then he has to bring it to a 

1910
01:24:54,991 --> 01:24:59,911
butcher that has a permit to process it 
and expect it and then not butcher can 

1911
01:24:59,911 --> 01:25:00,310
then sell to a restaurant.
Oh,

1912
01:25:00,311 --> 01:25:01,420
well that makes sense.
Yeah.

1913
01:25:01,421 --> 01:25:03,010
And it's,
it's controlled and like I don't want to

1914
01:25:03,011 --> 01:25:06,040
decimate the population.
I don't want to hurt a anything.

1915
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:07,820
Is that the way to say it though?
New found land,

1916
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:08,980
newfoundland.
Yeah,

1917
01:25:08,981 --> 01:25:10,990
I think it's definitely not.
Call it new found land.

1918
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,770
It's like calling chicago chicago.
Get pissed at you.

1919
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:17,930
Like fake canadian.
I have an aunt from there.

1920
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:25,740
Yeah.
I don't want market hunting of wild 

1921
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:28,381
game.
It's Because I love wild animals and 

1922
01:25:28,381 --> 01:25:28,381
hundred percent again.
What do you,

1923
01:25:28,381 --> 01:25:31,980
how do you love an animal?
Yeah,

1924
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:36,400
well I just think it's very complex.
That's what I think.

1925
01:25:36,401 --> 01:25:41,401
I think just staying alive,
being a human is very complex and I 

1926
01:25:41,401 --> 01:25:42,850
think we have very simplistic ways of 
looking at it.

1927
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:48,150
I also think that it's entirely possible
that plants are communicating with each 

1928
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:51,751
other and they have a level of 
intelligence that we don't totally 

1929
01:25:51,751 --> 01:25:53,470
understand and that's supported by data 
that supported by more and more research

1930
01:25:53,471 --> 01:25:58,471
every day.
They're finding out that plants have 

1931
01:25:58,471 --> 01:26:01,471
some interconnected network of 
communication with each other and that 

1932
01:26:01,471 --> 01:26:04,010
they recognize when they're being and

1933
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:09,010
they changed their flavor profile to 
make themselves tastes terrible to 

1934
01:26:09,010 --> 01:26:13,151
animals that are eating them.
There's some communication between them 

1935
01:26:13,151 --> 01:26:14,730
and there are some sort of a primitive 
life form that many are.

1936
01:26:14,731 --> 01:26:19,731
You are far more complex than things 
that vegans won't eat like mollusks 

1937
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,580
mollusks,
although we think of them as animals,

1938
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:25,790
they're the simplest,
dumbest fucking thing on earth vice.

1939
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:29,540
Just an article that a questioning 
whether mollusks we're vegan.

1940
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:31,000
I thought it was funny.
They shouldn't be.

1941
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:34,250
I think for health purposes,
people that are vegans like,

1942
01:26:34,251 --> 01:26:35,310
hey man,
they're.

1943
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,640
They're sustainable.
I mean you could farm them.

1944
01:26:37,641 --> 01:26:42,641
You could have anything property to have
something that they were using muscles 

1945
01:26:42,641 --> 01:26:43,790
to clean up.
Ocean beaches,

1946
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:49,030
filter the water and a fast and 
mushrooms to apparently are very 

1947
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:52,691
cleansing there.
They're trying to find ways to use 

1948
01:26:52,691 --> 01:26:53,280
mushrooms to clean kind of oil spills 
and yes,

1949
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:54,800
screwed up environmental things.

1950
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:59,860
People should eat mandalas,
they really should and they should also 

1951
01:26:59,860 --> 01:26:59,860
eat eggs,
eat eggs,

1952
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:01,700
folks.
Just from An ethical animals,

1953
01:27:01,701 --> 01:27:06,701
and I'm just saying this just as a 
person who values health in a person 

1954
01:27:06,701 --> 01:27:06,920
who's.
I mean I,

1955
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:10,280
I put my body through a lot.
My body has to.

1956
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:13,160
It has to perform and it has my whole 
life.

1957
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:18,161
So I'm very,
very concerned with nutrition and I'm 

1958
01:27:18,161 --> 01:27:21,131
very aware of the impact attrition has 
on physical performance and I think eggs

1959
01:27:21,261 --> 01:27:26,261
are gigantic.
They're so goddamn good for your health 

1960
01:27:26,261 --> 01:27:26,780
and this idea that somehow know that 
you're doing something cruel.

1961
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:30,320
My chickens are my friends.
You see it from that video that's proven

1962
01:27:30,321 --> 01:27:31,850
in the pudding,
that scared of me at all.

1963
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:36,950
That runnIng around with their running 
around with me and I eat their eggs and 

1964
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:37,280
those eggs are good for.
And I know everybody can't do that,

1965
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:39,780
but you can get these toilets.

1966
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:42,770
It's eggs and you vote with your dollars
that you're spending.

1967
01:27:42,771 --> 01:27:47,771
You know,
if you go to the store and you buy 

1968
01:27:47,771 --> 01:27:47,771
organic eggs and you buy the healthier 
version,

1969
01:27:47,771 --> 01:27:48,200
yes,
you're paying an extra buck or two bucks

1970
01:27:48,201 --> 01:27:51,380
or whatever it is,
but crack open an egg from like the mass

1971
01:27:51,381 --> 01:27:55,130
produced place and you crack open an egg
from the organic place.

1972
01:27:55,280 --> 01:28:00,280
One is like the organic ones are like 
bright orange and like super dark and 

1973
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:04,811
even the yolk is like really thick and 
then the other one it's like pale and 

1974
01:28:04,811 --> 01:28:09,611
runny yellow and you crack them and the 
yolks break sometimes and they're just 

1975
01:28:09,611 --> 01:28:13,631
like,
it's garbage and who knows what's in 

1976
01:28:13,631 --> 01:28:13,631
them and what conditions those chickens 
are living in.

1977
01:28:13,631 --> 01:28:17,000
A lot of times terrible conditions.
I think whoever started off,

1978
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:18,890
I mean I guess it's just economics,
right?

1979
01:28:18,891 --> 01:28:23,891
And then you give people the option to 
make the most amount of money and not 

1980
01:28:24,651 --> 01:28:28,900
have to account for ethics or cruelty 
standards or whatever.

1981
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:34,150
You know,
whatever issues were in place that 

1982
01:28:34,150 --> 01:28:37,181
allowed factory farms to materialize.
That's one of the worst,

1983
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:42,980
worst pieces of evidence about the 
cruelty of human beings.

1984
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:45,110
It's one of the worst.
It's horrific.

1985
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,480
I mean,
and it's,

1986
01:28:46,610 --> 01:28:51,610
it's something that I think we should 
really collectively do something about 

1987
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:55,520
and absolutely,
it's one of the things that really ramps

1988
01:28:55,521 --> 01:29:00,521
up the,
the anger on the side of the animal 

1989
01:29:00,521 --> 01:29:00,740
rights activists and the side of the 
vegans.

1990
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:02,670
I get it,
I get it,

1991
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:06,500
but to go after someone like you is in 
my opinion,

1992
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:11,520
so incredibly misguided and it's why I 
asked you to come on because I thought 

1993
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:16,431
it was so frustrating and watching you 
carved that venice and up in front of 

1994
01:29:16,431 --> 01:29:17,550
those people.
What were they screaming at you?

1995
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:21,210
Murderer murder.
That's not true.

1996
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,710
It's like saying,
you know,

1997
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:27,390
it's just like saying you're a thief 
because you cut grass.

1998
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:30,870
It's no,
it's not.

1999
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,040
It's not murder.
It's,

2000
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:33,870
it's kIlling animals.
We even,

2001
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:36,000
even the video,
someone's walking by and they're like,

2002
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:37,530
they're saying they're murderers and 
she's like,

2003
01:29:37,531 --> 01:29:39,060
they're murdering people and like,
no,

2004
01:29:39,061 --> 01:29:41,190
they're murdering animals.
The kind of laugh.

2005
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:48,980
A lot of those people are sad,
like a lot of like what you're dealing 

2006
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:50,310
with with these animal rights activists 
that they're,

2007
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:54,750
they're so engrossed in this struggle 
and it's the part of their,

2008
01:29:54,751 --> 01:29:57,510
their daily existence and they're,
they're angry and sad.

2009
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:02,930
There's one crazy video where this lady 
goes into this restaurant and she starts

2010
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:08,660
yelling in front of everybody about her 
friend and just be this beautiful 

2011
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:09,900
creature that just wants to live and 
it's a chicken.

2012
01:30:09,901 --> 01:30:12,150
She's talking about chicken and like my 
friend,

2013
01:30:12,151 --> 01:30:13,950
that chicken was killed and it's like,
what?

2014
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:15,430
Whoa.
And everybody in the restaurant,

2015
01:30:15,431 --> 01:30:16,740
it's like,
what the fuck?

2016
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:19,530
I've seen these videos and they're like,
they'll storm a restaurant.

2017
01:30:19,531 --> 01:30:22,570
There'll be like 50 people that go and 
occupy a steakhouse.

2018
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:23,580
Here's this crazy lady.

2019
01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:29,710
Oh god,
here we go,

2020
01:30:30,490 --> 01:30:34,300
girl.
She was very abused for her entire life.

2021
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:39,810
She was terrified.
she has a very determined look in her 

2022
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:43,021
eyes wherever she goes,
and she was hurt and abused her entire 

2023
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:47,080
life because of this establishment and 
because of establishments like it,

2024
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:50,860
she was locked away.
She with hidden.

2025
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:55,570
She got nobody there for her.
She was crying.

2026
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,880
She was scared every single moment

2027
01:30:58,270 --> 01:31:00,560
we have a maitre d because they're 
useful,

2028
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:05,770
had run out.
Someone's going to hear and I can see 

2029
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,790
you laughing,
smiling.

2030
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:13,360
At least at least we're not busy.
Yeah,

2031
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:18,880
that's true.
That's such a restaurant way of taking 

2032
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,800
you with me right now.
She wouldn't be gone just like,

2033
01:31:24,490 --> 01:31:29,490
where's the chicken part?
All of those other girls.

2034
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:35,470
But where is this crazy town?
Disrupt.

2035
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:50,490
It's unfair to those mice.
Oh,

2036
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:57,490
eating somebody else's eggs.
Remember her name,

2037
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:02,600
her name,
a beautiful little girl.

2038
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:05,470
She's a mouse.
Murder.

2039
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:10,780
violence.
They sing it together.

2040
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:13,940
They all get together with science.
Think of this.

2041
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,290
Okay.
Cut it short.

2042
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:28,550
See the way your little bird snow fucks 
up a warm you crazy bitch.

2043
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:30,550
Fucks up.
Mice,

2044
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:31,720
throat,
mouse in the cage.

2045
01:32:31,721 --> 01:32:33,550
No snow.
Only grain.

2046
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:36,700
That guy's funny.
It's kind of amazing.

2047
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:37,310
So yeah,
there's,

2048
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:42,800
there's,
there's protesting and it's like it's,

2049
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:47,930
it's our fundamental right to protest 
and have freedom of speech and have 

2050
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:47,930
these things,
but that's not protesting.

2051
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:48,760
That's disrupting a business.
yeah,

2052
01:32:48,761 --> 01:32:50,080
there's not,
it's not the place for it.

2053
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:51,010
That's harassment.
Look,

2054
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:55,570
if the best place for something like 
that is really what we just saw a video.

2055
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,990
Make a video about your thoughts.
Yeah.

2056
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:01,810
You know if you mean if they honestly 
think that we're doing is wrong.

2057
01:33:01,811 --> 01:33:05,380
Like this is what something like youtuBe
is for.

2058
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:09,520
Make a video where you state your case.
I'll come and talk to me and didn't even

2059
01:33:09,521 --> 01:33:10,120
come and talk to me.

2060
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:11,590
we'll just start at my restaurant with 
science,

2061
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:16,620
but at least wIth the video you'll leave
the comments open and then people 

2062
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:17,650
debate.
They decide whether or not they agree or

2063
01:33:17,651 --> 01:33:19,600
disagree.
Are you fucking crazy asshole?

2064
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:22,630
Let that snow loose.
Watch what she does.

2065
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:25,840
Watch what she does to every fucking 
buck she finds she's a murderer.

2066
01:33:25,841 --> 01:33:27,610
She's not.
She's not a vegetarian.

2067
01:33:27,611 --> 01:33:30,730
You fucking chickens out a vegetarian.
It's just not.

2068
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,770
You know,
people lIke vegetarian fed.

2069
01:33:32,771 --> 01:33:35,620
Well then you got a sick chicken because
that's not what they're supposed to eat.

2070
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:37,330
It seemed like cats.
Cats need meat.

2071
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,740
You can't feed a cat.
A vegan dIet like you can see.

2072
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,320
One of my bits,
I have a bit about it.

2073
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:46,350
do you really fucking hilarious because 
it's something that I found online when 

2074
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:47,800
someone's angry at me,
when someone was angry at me,

2075
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:51,820
I went to her page and it's one of the 
things said hashtag vegan cat.

2076
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:52,900
I went,
oh jesus.

2077
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:56,410
I went down.
That was illegal in animal rights.

2078
01:33:56,411 --> 01:33:58,180
People will come and should tinker.
Cat.

2079
01:33:58,330 --> 01:34:00,160
We'll talk about that later.
I don't want to do my bit.

2080
01:34:00,161 --> 01:34:02,740
I'm doing it on a comedy special zone,
but the,

2081
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:06,700
the,
the problem with this is that as we said

2082
01:34:06,701 --> 01:34:09,550
before,
it becomes like a contest.

2083
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:12,020
It becomes like a,
like a battle ground.

2084
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,450
yeah.
That's my concern is like,

2085
01:34:13,451 --> 01:34:15,940
how does this end?
How do we bridge the gap?

2086
01:34:15,941 --> 01:34:18,550
How do we get people like,
how do they stop fucking with you?

2087
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:20,140
I have no idea that.
well,

2088
01:34:20,141 --> 01:34:25,141
theIr,
their thing is they want us to put a 

2089
01:34:25,141 --> 01:34:25,141
sign in our window that's explained 
that,

2090
01:34:25,141 --> 01:34:29,210
that you know,
we're mistreating animals and animal 

2091
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:29,230
lives or their right and they say,
you know,

2092
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:31,360
this extortion,
if we put this sign in our window,

2093
01:34:31,361 --> 01:34:32,440
they're going to go away.
Well,

2094
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,110
we're not doing anything wrong.
You know,

2095
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:36,670
nothing we're doing is illegal.
We're not infringing on anyone's rights.

2096
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:39,220
Have you talked to them at all if you 
gone outside?

2097
01:34:39,370 --> 01:34:40,210
So,
no,

2098
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:42,700
we had one of our managers go outside 
and there,

2099
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:44,740
they just screamed at her.
They were,

2100
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,480
this isn't the time.
I think just murderer.

2101
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:49,490
What about snow girl?
So,

2102
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,250
you know,
we,

2103
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:53,740
we did send an email trying to,
we invited them to go foraging with us.

2104
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:58,810
Uh,
and we talked about our different 

2105
01:34:58,810 --> 01:34:58,810
ideologies,
ideologies and how,

2106
01:34:58,810 --> 01:34:58,810
you know,
they're,

2107
01:34:58,810 --> 01:34:58,810
they're really far

2108
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:03,010
apart,
but maybe we can come to some kind of 

2109
01:35:03,010 --> 01:35:03,010
understanding and,
and uh,

2110
01:35:03,010 --> 01:35:03,010
you know,
at the,

2111
01:35:03,010 --> 01:35:05,570
at the time they didn't respond,
they didn't respond for awhile and now I

2112
01:35:05,571 --> 01:35:08,630
don't,
I don't think I'm a,

2113
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:09,910
you know,
I don't,

2114
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,770
I don't think that anything good would 
come with that meeting at this point.

2115
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,530
So,
so what do you do?

2116
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:17,330
How's business?
By the way?

2117
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:20,900
Business has always been good for us.
We were very lucky.

2118
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:23,120
I'm like,
you have a great restaurant.

2119
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:24,470
I mean,
I'm sure that's part of it.

2120
01:35:24,471 --> 01:35:25,160
Thank you.
but we,

2121
01:35:25,161 --> 01:35:30,161
we've,
we've had some international 

2122
01:35:30,161 --> 01:35:30,161
recognition.
Um,

2123
01:35:30,161 --> 01:35:30,161
we've,
I've done a lot of traveling last year,

2124
01:35:30,161 --> 01:35:32,930
I've been to five continents in the last
year or two of them cooking.

2125
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:34,850
Uh,
I went to abu dhabi with a,

2126
01:35:34,851 --> 01:35:36,950
there's a company called img and if you 
know them,

2127
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:39,470
they own the ufc,
now they run,

2128
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:42,500
they have a culinary department and they
run these festivals called taste.

2129
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:47,760
Um,
and our first year opening we were part 

2130
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:50,981
of this taste festival and uh,
I didn't even know there was a 

2131
01:35:50,981 --> 01:35:51,290
competition going on.
These people came by and they were lIke,

2132
01:35:51,291 --> 01:35:56,291
oh,
we're judging this competition and we 

2133
01:35:56,291 --> 01:35:56,291
want to try your food.
And I was like,

2134
01:35:56,291 --> 01:36:00,060
well,
I think these people are trying to get 

2135
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:00,060
some free food out of me.
They were like,

2136
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:00,590
yeah,
you can win a trip to abu dhabi.

2137
01:36:00,591 --> 01:36:01,370
And I was like,
oh,

2138
01:36:01,371 --> 01:36:02,150
okay,
whatever.

2139
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:05,840
And we actually won and they sent me to 
abu dhabi to,

2140
01:36:05,841 --> 01:36:10,841
uh,
to compete against 11 other chefs from 

2141
01:36:10,841 --> 01:36:10,841
around the world.
Uh,

2142
01:36:10,841 --> 01:36:10,910
and it was amazing.
It was incredible.

2143
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:12,980
Um,
and then from there,

2144
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:18,040
uh,
I think six slash six or eight months 

2145
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:18,040
later,
there was a festival in Australia.

2146
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,700
So they brought me to Australia to,
uh,

2147
01:36:19,701 --> 01:36:23,360
to cook in western Australia,
this a event called the gourmet escape,

2148
01:36:23,890 --> 01:36:28,890
a really,
really cool event and it was down the 

2149
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:31,211
road from a deer farm and we were 
putting out a lunch and dinner for 200 

2150
01:36:31,211 --> 01:36:31,211
people.

2151
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:35,450
So we actually roasted to hold dear sato
style over open fire,

2152
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,480
uh,
and you do that.

2153
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:38,450
Uh,
rAn the woods.

2154
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:43,780
it was incredible photos on my instagram
or the antler kitchen borrowed up to or 

2155
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:47,780
at antler kitchen bar on instagram.
There's photos of this,

2156
01:36:47,781 --> 01:36:49,090
uh,
this uh,

2157
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:51,290
sato.
It was super,

2158
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,280
super,
super cool.

2159
01:36:52,281 --> 01:36:57,281
So sato sato is a,
I think it's the argentinian cooking 

2160
01:36:57,281 --> 01:36:57,281
style and it's,
it's a whole,

2161
01:36:57,281 --> 01:37:02,220
uh,
animal that's a kind of split down the 

2162
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:02,220
middle and kind of like cross across.
Yeah,

2163
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:03,980
there is.
It's really cool.

2164
01:37:03,981 --> 01:37:07,610
So pig is probably the best one to do it
with because of the fat content,

2165
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:12,680
a deer and lamb and stuff like that.
You kind of have to base it to keep it 

2166
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:15,971
moist.
How do you regulate temperature when it 

2167
01:37:15,971 --> 01:37:17,831
comes to something like that?
It's just stacking up the wood and kind 

2168
01:37:17,831 --> 01:37:18,720
of how far leaning on it and some of 
that to do it.

2169
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:20,960
It just practice,
just playing around.

2170
01:37:21,290 --> 01:37:21,890
Um,
fun.

2171
01:37:21,950 --> 01:37:24,770
It just lay low and slow.
Was kind of ready to go for many times.

2172
01:37:24,790 --> 01:37:25,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

2173
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,440
So we do at the restaurant,
I do it in my backyard a lot.

2174
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:30,350
I actually did for my wedding,
we did two pigs from my wedding.

2175
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:33,260
I'm like poking the fire and my suit.
That's so graphic.

2176
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:34,250
It's great.
Yeah.

2177
01:37:34,251 --> 01:37:37,580
That got a lot of hate.
There's hate on that.

2178
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:39,590
Um,
but it's food,

2179
01:37:39,591 --> 01:37:41,930
you know,
and people want to disconnect themselves

2180
01:37:41,931 --> 01:37:43,780
from where it's coming from.
Um,

2181
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:45,150
but he went back to your question,
you know,

2182
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:46,600
business has always been good in 
businesses,

2183
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:47,930
businesses,
good days and bad days.

2184
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:52,960
You know,
right now there's a lot of attention on 

2185
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:52,960
antler,
lot of media attention on antler.

2186
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:52,960
So,
uh,

2187
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:52,960
we're,
you know,

2188
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:54,200
we're a little bit busier than normal 
right now.

2189
01:37:54,230 --> 01:37:55,650
Get ready,
just

2190
01:37:56,350 --> 01:38:01,350
get crazy.
It's gonna be nuts down there and 

2191
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:03,981
there's going to be a bunch of people on
your side to hopefully nothing bad 

2192
01:38:03,981 --> 01:38:03,981
happens.
Like,

2193
01:38:03,981 --> 01:38:07,530
people don't get into anything physical 
or you can start shouting at each other,

2194
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:08,000
but that

2195
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:11,370
shouting stuff was happening.
But uh,

2196
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:16,520
but yeah,
hopefully this will kind of smooth out 

2197
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:16,910
and people can learn to get it to get 
along and lifting

2198
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:17,710
together.
Yeah.

2199
01:38:17,711 --> 01:38:19,840
Well it doesn't seem like that's what 
they want though.

2200
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:22,900
It seems like what they want is for you 
to bend their demands.

2201
01:38:22,901 --> 01:38:26,860
I mean that's what a lot of this is when
it comes to change,

2202
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,810
you know,
when it comes to people wanting change,

2203
01:38:28,811 --> 01:38:33,811
they want you to change and they want 
their right and they want you to admit 

2204
01:38:33,811 --> 01:38:34,630
you're wrong.
And this is,

2205
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:39,660
this is a real problem.
The real problem with something that's 

2206
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:39,660
complex.

2207
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:42,940
Yeah.
And the funny thing was like we've had 

2208
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:44,090
vegan and vegetarian items on our menu 
since 2015 when we opened.

2209
01:38:44,150 --> 01:38:47,270
And so I think it was like the second or
third week they came,

2210
01:38:47,271 --> 01:38:48,510
we thought okay,
we're going to,

2211
01:38:48,530 --> 01:38:53,530
we're going to feature one of our vegan 
dishes on the sign and hopefully that 

2212
01:38:53,530 --> 01:38:57,161
makes them happy.
And so we feature one of our vegan 

2213
01:38:57,161 --> 01:39:00,581
dishes on the sign.
And then we saw from their online post 

2214
01:39:00,581 --> 01:39:03,650
that they thought that we made the posts
where we made them change a meat dish to

2215
01:39:03,651 --> 01:39:05,570
a vegan dish.
We have to keep pUshing them.

2216
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:07,190
And it was so frustrating.
Like,

2217
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:09,050
no,
you guys don't know who we are.

2218
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:11,870
Well that's exactly what I'm talking 
about.

2219
01:39:11,871 --> 01:39:16,871
It,
it becomes a contest or a battle ground 

2220
01:39:16,871 --> 01:39:16,871
and Ideological battle ground.
Yeah.

2221
01:39:16,871 --> 01:39:21,370
This,
this thought that they're making you 

2222
01:39:21,370 --> 01:39:21,370
change,
they want you to change.

2223
01:39:21,370 --> 01:39:22,490
You know?
I mean I've seeN.

2224
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:25,670
I saw a video once where people were mad
at me too and they were like,

2225
01:39:25,671 --> 01:39:28,280
he's listening so he's open to change.
And I was like,

2226
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:33,650
no,
like I'm listening because I want to 

2227
01:39:33,650 --> 01:39:33,650
hear your perspective like you're not 
right.

2228
01:39:33,650 --> 01:39:34,430
Like,
and I'm not right.

2229
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:39,290
It's like we have our own perspectives 
and I'm not going to change if I change.

2230
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:44,300
It's because of the evidence and because
of thinking and careful consideration 

2231
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:44,810
and I've done that.
I've done a lot of thinking.

2232
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:47,120
I've done a lot of kale for careful 
consideration.

2233
01:39:47,450 --> 01:39:50,270
And that's what led me to becoming a 
hunter in the first place.

2234
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:50,910
yeah.
What,

2235
01:39:51,470 --> 01:39:52,430
how did you start hunting?

2236
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:53,770
Stephen?
Noah took her.

2237
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:59,080
I had been thinking about it for a long 
time and the main reason I've been 

2238
01:39:59,080 --> 01:39:59,930
thinking about it was because of those 
pet videos,

2239
01:40:00,170 --> 01:40:02,630
those fucking horrific factory farming 
videos.

2240
01:40:02,631 --> 01:40:04,070
I was like,
I don't want to eat that.

2241
01:40:04,071 --> 01:40:05,360
I don't want.
I want him to be a part of this.

2242
01:40:05,361 --> 01:40:09,320
I want to figure out how to not.
So I started buying grass fed meat and I

2243
01:40:09,321 --> 01:40:13,850
tried to figure out a way to get around 
it and I really started getting very,

2244
01:40:13,851 --> 01:40:16,760
very interested in hunting,
but I didn't know how to start.

2245
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:21,790
I didn't know where to start and we're 
filming a fear factor episode at tone 

2246
01:40:21,831 --> 01:40:26,831
ranch says 270,000
acre ranch in the middle of the country 

2247
01:40:26,831 --> 01:40:30,491
while middle of the state rather.
And they were saying that they have a 

2248
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:33,470
wild pigs there and they would teach you
how they.

2249
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:38,980
That was something that I had considered
before I met rinella and when I met 

2250
01:40:38,980 --> 01:40:42,761
rinella he took me on a hunt for his tv 
show and I shot a mule deer and we ate 

2251
01:40:42,761 --> 01:40:43,580
it that night.
Over the fire.

2252
01:40:43,581 --> 01:40:46,060
And I said that's it.
That's it.

2253
01:40:46,450 --> 01:40:48,180
The quote,
the cool part about hunting is a,

2254
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:50,120
nothing goes to waste.
So I take,

2255
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:52,190
I take the hides to a guide to have them
stand.

2256
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:53,980
So I've actually made a knife roll

2257
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,350
out of one of the highlights.
I have an apron out of one of the hides.

2258
01:40:56,710 --> 01:40:59,760
My wedding ring has antler in it.
Yeah,

2259
01:40:59,761 --> 01:41:01,060
that's pretty cool.
I'm proud of that one.

2260
01:41:01,061 --> 01:41:02,220
That's crazy.
Um,

2261
01:41:02,350 --> 01:41:04,750
and yeah,
and I use all the bones to make a stock.

2262
01:41:04,810 --> 01:41:05,920
And then when I,
you know,

2263
01:41:05,921 --> 01:41:10,921
a lot of the cuts and one of the reasons
I want to write this book is to teach 

2264
01:41:10,921 --> 01:41:13,750
hunters how to use those tough cuts.
One of my favorite parts of uh,

2265
01:41:13,751 --> 01:41:18,751
of the deer and different animals as the
neck and the neck has got all this 

2266
01:41:18,751 --> 01:41:22,441
really super flavorful kind of 
gelatinous meet kind of in between the 

2267
01:41:22,441 --> 01:41:22,910
cartilage and stuff like that.
Uh,

2268
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:26,020
and you make a stew with that stuff and 
it is unbelievably tasty.

2269
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:28,210
And,
you know,

2270
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,040
I think in a lot of guys when they go 
hunting,

2271
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:35,070
they kind of breast out the birds and 
they leave the little legs and they 

2272
01:41:35,070 --> 01:41:35,070
don't really know that,
you know,

2273
01:41:35,070 --> 01:41:35,890
how to cook the legs of a Turkey or a 
duck.

2274
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:40,890
And um,
so that's one of the reasons why I want 

2275
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:43,111
to write this book and really educate 
people how to use those tougher cuts 

2276
01:41:43,111 --> 01:41:43,660
that you can be kind of tricky to cook 
with.

2277
01:41:43,661 --> 01:41:48,661
Nela has a couple of good books on that 
and one of the things that he's really 

2278
01:41:48,661 --> 01:41:50,750
into his making shanks and also gluco 
good brazing.

2279
01:41:50,751 --> 01:41:51,370
So good.
Yeah.

2280
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:52,860
Yeah.
And he's also,

2281
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:55,450
you know,
a big advocate of not wasting anything.

2282
01:41:55,451 --> 01:41:58,180
That's why he's into organ meat.
Liver.

2283
01:41:58,181 --> 01:42:00,250
And we had a fire that night.
Oh,

2284
01:42:00,251 --> 01:42:05,251
so good.
I had a Turkey feathers in my little 

2285
01:42:05,251 --> 01:42:05,251
boot near,
on my wedding day from a Turkey.

2286
01:42:05,251 --> 01:42:06,040
Yeah,
it was neat.

2287
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:10,380
It was really cool.
It's one of the reasons why it's so kind

2288
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:15,390
of crazy that you're the guy that they 
picked on and not the butcher shop 

2289
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:18,361
across the street or not some burger 
joint down the street that's getting 

2290
01:42:18,361 --> 01:42:22,831
factory farmed meat is you do have a 
respect and appreciation for the 

2291
01:42:22,831 --> 01:42:24,590
wildlife,
but that this ideological battle,

2292
01:42:24,591 --> 01:42:29,591
ground battle ground on their side,
it doesn't leave any room for forgiving 

2293
01:42:29,591 --> 01:42:29,591
in.

2294
01:42:29,591 --> 01:42:34,120
there's no room for reasons just you're 
either an animal murderer or a year that

2295
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:37,000
the most amazing person ever because 
you're vegan,

2296
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:38,150
go vegan.
You know,

2297
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:38,950
it's,
it's,

2298
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:42,790
it's a really.
It's a new thing in terms of first world

2299
01:42:42,791 --> 01:42:44,320
problems,
first world countries.

2300
01:42:44,321 --> 01:42:46,660
I mean people have been needing 
vegetarian dishes forever,

2301
01:42:47,050 --> 01:42:52,050
but in terms of like being ideologically
rabid about your,

2302
01:42:52,710 --> 01:42:53,980
you know,
your position,

2303
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:55,540
this is,
this is very new.

2304
01:42:55,541 --> 01:42:57,570
It's within the last couple of decades.
Yeah.

2305
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:59,940
It's uh,
it's unfortunate because we're getting,

2306
01:42:59,970 --> 01:43:04,970
you know,
we've had a lot of support from our 

2307
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:07,530
community and Canada and the 
international community and we're 

2308
01:43:07,530 --> 01:43:10,470
actually getting support from other 
vegans and vegetarian people writing to 

2309
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:10,470
us and say,
hey.

2310
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:10,470
Yeah.
The same like,

2311
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:11,470
hey,
these aren't our beliefs,

2312
01:43:11,471 --> 01:43:12,670
we're really sorry what you're going 
through.

2313
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:13,720
Um,
you know,

2314
01:43:13,721 --> 01:43:17,170
you have our support and it's a,
some of our customers are actually vegan

2315
01:43:17,171 --> 01:43:22,171
and they come for like vegetarian 
risotto and like mushroom risotto that 

2316
01:43:22,171 --> 01:43:22,171
they know or like,
you know,

2317
01:43:22,171 --> 01:43:24,490
really cool wild mushrooms that you 
can't buy in the store.

2318
01:43:24,491 --> 01:43:26,730
So it's a,
you know,

2319
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,310
it is unfortunate.
It is kinda,

2320
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:29,670
it's kinda sad.
But uh,

2321
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:30,260
you know,
we're,

2322
01:43:30,261 --> 01:43:31,680
we're just gonna continue,
you know,

2323
01:43:31,930 --> 01:43:34,490
being who we are and hopefully that,
uh,

2324
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:39,540
you know,
like none of them have actually come in 

2325
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:39,540
for dinner,
you know,

2326
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:40,150
of course they're not going to your up 
here in the front window,

2327
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:43,670
man,
a fucking murderer.

2328
01:43:44,670 --> 01:43:46,410
Um,
so there's,

2329
01:43:46,690 --> 01:43:48,580
you're right in the middle of this right
now,

2330
01:43:48,581 --> 01:43:50,350
which is kind of interesting to talk to 
us about us.

2331
01:43:50,351 --> 01:43:52,220
It's not like after fact it's all going

2332
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,580
down right now going on there.
They're,

2333
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,710
you know,
they're coming back weekly.

2334
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:55,910
Um,
but it's,

2335
01:43:55,911 --> 01:44:00,911
it's kind of at this point,
it's like dinner and a show like people 

2336
01:44:00,911 --> 01:44:03,401
want to see it.
People are requesting the window window 

2337
01:44:03,401 --> 01:44:03,401
table.
Well guess what,

2338
01:44:03,401 --> 01:44:04,100
fans,
this podcast,

2339
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:07,070
you're going to want a front row seat 
and it's going to be.

2340
01:44:07,071 --> 01:44:10,190
These are just a lot of freaks out there
listening to this that are going to want

2341
01:44:10,191 --> 01:44:13,520
to be there for the freak show.
Well toronto,

2342
01:44:13,521 --> 01:44:15,900
it's only about an hour and a half drive
from,

2343
01:44:15,901 --> 01:44:17,240
uh,
from buffalo at the border.

2344
01:44:17,241 --> 01:44:22,241
So it's a negative cross.
He fucks take a flight if you're into 

2345

the cold,
is there anything else you'd like to 

2346
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:25,720
tell people?
Like what is your website?

2347
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:28,760
How can people go and check it out?
So antler kitchen,

2348
01:44:28,761 --> 01:44:31,550

2349
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,500
There it is.
Pull that,

2350
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:34,550
scroll down jimmy.

2351
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:37,200
So you could see a look at some of that 
yummy murder that.

2352
01:44:37,210 --> 01:44:39,110
So that deer dish does.
Cool.

2353
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:44,120
Yeah,
you put a skull on the table with all 

2354
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:44,120
that.
So that,

2355
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:44,120
that platter,
that shukui potters,

2356
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:47,740
all the meat from that deer and the 
terrain on the side,

2357
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,600
the little square piece was actually 
meet from that skull.

2358
01:44:50,601 --> 01:44:55,601
So I braise that skull a,
turn the meat into a terrain from the 

2359
01:44:55,601 --> 01:44:59,831
tongue in the cheek and then serve.
That was actually at the game dinner 

2360
01:44:59,831 --> 01:45:00,470
that a newspaper did.
When are you heading back to toronto?

2361
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:06,250
Friday.
So I'm hearing visiting with family and 

2362
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:06,250
then um,
did you have access to a freezer?

2363
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:10,750
Yes.
I have two commercial freezers in the 

2364
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:10,750
back.
I want to give you some elk.

2365
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:10,750
Oh dude,
that is amazing.

2366
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:12,680
Thank you for that.
Thank you so much.

2367
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:15,650
It's an honor man.
I'll cook it with my dad this week.

2368
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:18,800
Please do take pictures and I'll put it 
up on instagram.

2369
01:45:18,801 --> 01:45:20,000
One hundred percent.
Awesome.

2370
01:45:20,130 --> 01:45:21,500
Before I love.
We love it,

2371
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:22,760

So yeah.

2372
01:45:22,761 --> 01:45:25,280
And their kitchen and the kitchen 
bar.com

2373
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:28,970
at 100 staff at [inaudible] kitchen bar,
all that kind of stuff you can find.

2374
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:31,700
What is your instagram?
My instagram is at the hunter.

2375
01:45:31,701 --> 01:45:32,590
Chef.
Chef.

2376
01:45:32,630 --> 01:45:33,890
Okay.
Thanks man.

2377
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:34,640
There's a lot of fun.
I,

2378
01:45:34,690 --> 01:45:39,690
you so much.
I hope this all works out and all angry 

2379
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:39,690
vegans.
Please just,

2380
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:41,000
I,
I know where you're coming from,

2381
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:43,460
but you really.
This is the wrong fight.

2382
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:47,750
It really is.
There's the battle is factory farming.

2383
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:50,840
That's the real battle ground and this 
is the wrong.

2384
01:45:50,930 --> 01:45:55,930
This is like the most ethical version of
what you're opposing and I think 

2385
01:45:56,631 --> 01:45:57,500
there's,
there's a,

2386
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:02,560
there's a healthy comfortable middle 
ground for the 99 percent that aren't 

2387
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,940
fucking idiots.
I really do and I hope we can find it.

2388
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:07,130
Thank you.
Alright fuckers.

2389
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:09,020
Be nice to each other by.
