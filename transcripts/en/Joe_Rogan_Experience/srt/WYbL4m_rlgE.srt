1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,060
What the fuck man?

3
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:03,960
We're weird.

4
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,003
So weird.

5
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,660
What a stupid culture.

6
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,531
What are you doing?

7
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:10,080
I can't stop thinking about the guy.

8
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,990
The farted at the sink.

9
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,460
The airport.

10
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,670
We talked about it for
10 minutes afterwards.

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,000
Dudes fart when they go to the bathroom.

12
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,070
Dudes are constantly far
to in public restrooms.

13
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:23,461
Yeah.

14
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:27,660
But we were at the sink and the dude was
washing his hands and he cut a monster

15
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,300
fart and I told Tommy
about it and I was like,

16
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:30,751
dude,

17
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:31,584
this guy,

18
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,400
he broke.

19
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,200
He broke the rule.

20
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,360
Yeah.

21
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,010
I walked out just before this happened.

22
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,660
I unfortunately missed the incident,

23
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,000
but you said it immediately and I was.

24
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,150
I kept wrapping my head around it and I
think what I've come to the conclusion

25
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,980
is that if you do that,

26
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,260
all I'm looking for is
for you to acknowledge it.

27
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,650
Yeah.

28
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,870
You need to say something.

29
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,760
I want you to say something about that
because I was thinking about how an old

30
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:58,761
guy one time farted next to me in like
on a tram in the airport and I was like,

31
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:01,680
Jesus,

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,450
he led a fucking pretty big fart.

33
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,060
And I looked at him and he goes,

34
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:05,993
snuck out of me.

35
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,561
I was like,

36
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:06,880
alright.

37
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,910
And I kind of took away.

38
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,203
Like

39
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,270
I was like,

40
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,060
well thank you for acknowledging
your fart right now.

41
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,391
Yeah.

42
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,250
This guy was just washing
his hands and he just.

43
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,050
The sink is not the year.

44
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,320
I don't think you'd get a pass there.

45
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,880
Yeah,

46
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,430
it was definitely who does that?

47
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,050
It was definitely a gray area.

48
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,020
There's definitely a greater people
fart all the time at the urinals.

49
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:28,950
That's so common.

50
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:29,100
Yeah.

51
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,933
I heard a lot of parts.

52
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
But if you get done zip up,

53
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,410
walk all the way around and wash your
hands in the middle of Washington,

54
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,670
you just unload and no one said a word.

55
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:38,880
Yeah.

56
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,710
Everyone just just let it go.

57
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,560
And then we got outside.

58
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:42,961
I was like,

59
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:43,410
Yo Dude,

60
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,430
how do you feel about this?

61
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,520
I can't stop thinking about it.

62
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,790
And then we're trying to figure out what
kind of farts girls cut when they're in

63
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,490
the bathroom and whether or not they
wash their hands before nine each other.

64
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,170
Probably not as much.

65
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:55,651
Not as much,

66
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:57,360
but they definitely drop
heat in there for sure.

67
00:01:57,361 --> 00:02:00,150
Once they close that door or
then they allow themselves.

68
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,720
Yeah,

69
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,910
they allow themselves
to fucking farted up.

70
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,153
You know,

71
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,780
there was a time when it was,

72
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,590
I want to say it was like my leg

73
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,360
was like 23 I guess.

74
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,253
And um,

75
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,113
uh,

76
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,740
there was this girl and I'm

77
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:19,250
like,

78
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,120
we've been seeing this story.

79
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,910
She like,

80
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,590
we had this thing like it
was this kind of like a fair,

81
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:26,250
if you will.

82
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,720
She was engaged and,

83
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,330
and so like it was hot and heavy.

84
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,950
It was fun.

85
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,353
But it was a girl.

86
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,750
It was,

87
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,220
yeah.

88
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,930
We had a good time and it was
one of those things where,

89
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,410
you know,

90
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:37,981
she would tell me,

91
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:38,311
she's like,

92
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:38,551
you know,

93
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:39,390
you're not gay this,

94
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,680
you're doing this too.

95
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:42,990
Well then you're playing with my heart.

96
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:45,630
And so it was Kinda like
dangerous at the same time.

97
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:47,100
And then her fiance found out,

98
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,600
her fiance actually found out when I
was going down on her and her bedroom.

99
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,833
He walked in.

100
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,171
No,

101
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:58,430
he was knocking on the door
outside and the lights went out.

102
00:02:58,431 --> 00:02:58,711
We were like,

103
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,230
oh,

104
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,651
and he was like,

105
00:02:59,651 --> 00:02:59,981
Hey,

106
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:00,401
I'm here.

107
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:00,671
I'm here,

108
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:00,941
I'm here,

109
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:01,300
I'm here,

110
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,870
open the door,

111
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,350
the door,

112
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,330
and immediately what do I do?

113
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,081
I'm like,

114
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:05,561
what do I do?

115
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:05,860
What do I,

116
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,491
what do I do?

117
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:11,491
I jump in the shower like an asshole
because that's not suspicious.

118
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,520
I just came over to shower.

119
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,450
You turn it on,

120
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:18,220
you turn the shower on the shower on.

121
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:18,641
And he's like,

122
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:18,971
what are you doing?

123
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:19,121
I'm like,

124
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:19,481
Oh yeah,

125
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:20,680
I'll see you later if that was great.

126
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,310
Thanks for the study break and the shower.

127
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,740
I to get it off my face,

128
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,131
right?

129
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:30,371
Yeah,

130
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:31,150
I really did.

131
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,190
That's the thing with a steel wool pad,

132
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,024
you know,

133
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,691
God.

134
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:35,081
So when,

135
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:35,914
so,

136
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:36,791
and then,

137
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:40,750
and then she moved away and then um,

138
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,180
I got this phone call.

139
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:44,951
Oh God,

140
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:45,910
it was so crazy.

141
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,570
Um,

142
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,670
I got this phone call from
him to the fiance will do,

143
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,830
jerking off over the phone.

144
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:51,520
No,

145
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,420
he was mad.

146
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:52,950
He was like,

147
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,501
oh dude.

148
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:53,981
He was like,

149
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:56,890
so what the fuck am I hearing
about this and this and this?

150
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,890
And she's in the background
and she's just like,

151
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:00,611
he's lying.

152
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:01,211
He's lying,

153
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:01,450
he's a,

154
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,590
he's a fucking faggot.

155
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:04,110
Don't listen to them that a year.

156
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,990
Oh yeah.

157
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,990
She threw you down down under the
bus and that was the last time.

158
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:12,640
And this was somebody that I was like,

159
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:12,850
I,

160
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,900
we had like,

161
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:18,901
I thought we had something and when
she said that I was like later,

162
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,410
like I couldn't like that was it.

163
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,100
So you,

164
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,000
how old were you at the time?

165
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,280
I was 22 or 23.

166
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,260
You had already come out,

167
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,810
you'd come out and so when you were,

168
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,740
when you were her,

169
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:30,940
you told her that you were gay?

170
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,660
Yeah,

171
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,160
like everyone knew.

172
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,630
Like it was just one of those.

173
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,070
But then you get those girls were like,

174
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,480
I'm going to turn you.

175
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:38,314
And you're like,

176
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:38,831
oh,

177
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:39,790
I get it all the time.

178
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,040
You get it all the time
trying to turn you straight.

179
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:42,730
Yeah,

180
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,380
there's a lot of fear involved
in being in the actual.

181
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:46,450
Yeah.

182
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:46,950
Or wild

183
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,550
itself.

184
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,230
Yeah.

185
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,220
And they're,

186
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,080
they worry about stuff they
make up stuff to worry about.

187
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,460
I mean just to,

188
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,960
just to give them a way out.

189
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,510
And so that was,

190
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,230
that was,

191
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,340
that was true for me too.

192
00:04:59,640 --> 00:04:59,911
I mean,

193
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:01,110
it was overwhelming for me.

194
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:05,010
I didn't go back in there in the mountains
for a 10 day solo right out of the

195
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:05,430
gate.

196
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,780
I went for like one night,

197
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,870
like I went on a scouting trip
and then stayed one night,

198
00:05:09,871 --> 00:05:14,871
then came out and it was just kind
of baby steps into it because it's,

199
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,281
you know,

200
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:16,590
if you,

201
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,380
if you pull,

202
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:17,730
you know,

203
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,680
I don't know how many
people there are here in la,

204
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:24,120
but how many people have stayed out
overnight in the mountains by themself.

205
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,640
It's not going to be very many people.

206
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,990
I mean it's,

207
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,363
I dunno.

208
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,203
Five.

209
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,631
Yeah,

210
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,200
maybe.

211
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,790
I mean it's,

212
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,110
it's just not something
people do in this day and age.

213
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,910
And so it's because it's,

214
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:36,750
you know,

215
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,500
it's,

216
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,610
you're out of your comfort zone.

217
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,110
But if you can do that.

218
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,240
And that's,

219
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,480
I,

220
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,450
I became good at that.

221
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:43,284
And actually then I,

222
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,110
I,

223
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,730
I,

224
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,750
I loved it.

225
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,673
I remember,

226
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,401
let's see,

227
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:48,234
it was a,

228
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,853
um,

229
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,300
let me think what,

230
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,840
I don't know,

231
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,290
whatever.

232
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,011
I can't remember the year,

233
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:58,011
but I killed a six by six bull elk by
myself and it was my best bowl and I got

234
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,750
out of the wilderness,

235
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,190
has little Toyota four wheel drive.

236
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:02,000
I had this,

237
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,220
this bowl loaded up and
I was just so pumped.

238
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:07,550
Finally got cell service out on
the highway and I'm driving home.

239
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,840
And uh,

240
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,240
I called my wife and I was like,

241
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:10,880
I was like,

242
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,713
hey trace,

243
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,970
I killed a six by six bowl and she's like,

244
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,770
Princess di died.

245
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,820
I'm like,

246
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,653
what?

247
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,493
She's like,

248
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,610
Princess Di died.

249
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,623
I go,

250
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,733
who cares?

251
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,290
Killed a six by six bull.

252
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,150
It was just like you are.

253
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,430
So you know,

254
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,610
to everybody else,

255
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,570
Princess Diana,

256
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:30,710
Diane was like,

257
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,130
you know,

258
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,270
the world's going to stop,

259
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:36,290
but when you're back in the wilderness
and you killed a six by six bull elk,

260
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,640
nothing else matters.

261
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,593
And that's,

262
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,440
I just remembered.

263
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:44,441
That's the difference between living back
there where it's just about am I going

264
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:46,130
to find a place to sleep tonight?

265
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,530
Am I going to be warm and we'll have food?

266
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,453
That's it.

267
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,443
That's all you care about.

268
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:50,870
Yeah.

269
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,120
And um,

270
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,170
my parents actually didn't want me
to do martial arts because they were

271
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,640
terrified that I was going to become this
angry kid who knew how to fuck people

272
00:06:58,641 --> 00:06:59,120
up.

273
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,970
Whereas before it was just angry
kid who really couldn't do anything.

274
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,550
It wasn't,

275
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,261
wasn't dangerous.

276
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:04,094
I was 11,

277
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,520
you know,

278
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,160
and then this 11 year old became
12 and the 12 year olds like,

279
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:07,331
ah,

280
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:09,110
I don't want to be like
Bruce Lee and the fuck,

281
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:09,711
you know,

282
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:10,544
I don't think so.

283
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,440
No.

284
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,480
He didn't want me to.

285
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,420
Evan didn't chucks.

286
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,530
I had noon shocks all the time.

287
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,190
People are just taking shit away from me.

288
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,040
I'd make him in the woodshop.

289
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,040
I would tell them that I was making
a chair legs fucking my chair.

290
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,010
Scrub two broken legs.

291
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,190
Funny that they look exactly like chuck's

292
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,840
Mr Jason,

293
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:28,830
who is the every kid loved nunchucks.

294
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:30,940
Everybody did.

295
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,390
Of course the Bruce Lee movies.

296
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:33,590
Man there were dope.

297
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,870
See Him swinging around us.

298
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,850
I had a really funny
story that happened there.

299
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:38,481
So there was a kid,

300
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:39,380
I was like seven.

301
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,281
And as a kid,

302
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:45,200
neighbor kid who was 12 and he was big
way bigger than me and he would kind of

303
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:46,790
pick on me a little bit
just because he was bigger,

304
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,220
but I had a bunch of older brothers so
they would always keep them in line or

305
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:49,940
whatever.

306
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,410
One day he did something
fucked up to me again.

307
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:53,630
That's seven versus 12.

308
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,040
So they're like,

309
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:55,690
alright,

310
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,570
we got a plan and I had,

311
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:56,781
you know,

312
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:58,370
those foam nunchucks that you could get,

313
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,211
like playing around.

314
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:00,950
They had a hard center
and foam on the outside.

315
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,970
So I had those hidden behind my back
and my brother was holding me back and

316
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:05,570
says,

317
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,080
Ryan,

318
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,340
go take your shots man.

319
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,760
I'm fucking sick cows kristen.

320
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,100
I'm sick of Chris's bullshit.

321
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,150
Go take your shots.

322
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:14,330
And meanwhile he's holding me loosely
and I just have these nunchucks and this

323
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:14,691
guy's like,

324
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:14,961
yeah,

325
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,340
I'm going to get them in cheap shots.

326
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:17,900
It goes up to punch me in the stomach.

327
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,820
And I just put them out like Bruce Lee
and just go ape shit on this 12 year old

328
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:23,480
kid.

329
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,470
And I remember I was like,

330
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,610
I am fucking Bruce.

331
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:26,870
Yeah,

332
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,060
I fucked up.

333
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,470
They were hitting him that it
was like a fucking swarm of bees.

334
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,390
He just read into.

335
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,500
It's funny.

336
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,470
I set them up.

337
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,460
What a dumb ass.

338
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,330
Yeah.

339
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,470
I'm holding my brother back.

340
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:40,304
Come Punch them.

341
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,870
Yeah.

342
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,280
What kind of an asshole believes that?

343
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:44,120
The kid deserves it.

344
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,051
He deserves it.

345
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:45,870
Just as a lesson,

346
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,750
the universe toggle.

347
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,530
What are you fucking stupid.

348
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,680
It's not going to hold his brother
and let him let you punch him.

349
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,210
Silly Bitch.
