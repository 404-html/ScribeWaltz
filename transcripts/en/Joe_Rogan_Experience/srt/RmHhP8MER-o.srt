1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,290
Rogan experience,
just that contrast between this world

2
00:00:06,911 --> 00:00:11,320
that you were so deeply entrenched in
for two in two years and eight months

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,060
like that has got to change the way you
look at human life.

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,600
Yeah.
Because the Gulf and wealth is so

5
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:20,620
enormous.
I mean,

6
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:24,540
they can't imagine the amount of money
it takes to live in Bel Air and,

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,960
and the other way around.
I mean,

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,680
I think it's very difficult for someone
in California to imagine how little you

9
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:34,681
can get by on and how close to the earth
or some most people on the planet live

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,300
either.
There's a statistic

11
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,650
that I read once that I repeat all the
time because it still baffles me that if

12
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:45,340
you make more than $34,000 a year,
you're in the one percent of the world

13
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,120
of the world.
Yeah.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,410
Possibly.
Yeah.

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,700
And that is probably magnified manyfold
in Ethiopia.

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,401
Yeah.
Yeah.

17
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:56,200
In Ethiopia and Somalia.
I mean it's,

18
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,970
it's very,
um,

19
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,580
you know,
in some ways,

20
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,290
although they want money all the time,
especially if they're criminals.

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,910
Um,
the,

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,770
the money that we're used to sort of
greasing our path through life around

23
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,830
here is just not available.
It's just not,

24
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,010
not part of the reality.
What do they do with money when they get

25
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:18,611
it?
Well,

26
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,130
it depends if,
if they're pirates,

27
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,500
they splash out on a fancy car or,
or caught you see fancy cars.

28
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,610
Sure.
Oh yeah,

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,260
no,
I was placed in fancy cars.

30
00:01:29,261 --> 00:01:29,920
I mean,
really?

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,551
Yeah.
No.

32
00:01:30,551 --> 00:01:33,820
So the pirates had great cell phones,
um,

33
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,380
expensive suv,
um,

34
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,710
weapons that they had bought from abroad
and maybe a weapons possession,

35
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,340
Mogadishu or something like that.
Uh,

36
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,300
but that's not cheap either.
A,

37
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,850
they,
they bragged about how the,

38
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,050
the bullets costs like a dollar.
Each one of them.

39
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,390
I might've been wearing a band of 500
bullets.

40
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,090
Um,
and the cut is expensive,

41
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,840
so lots of things costs an enormous
amount of money in Somalia.

42
00:01:58,841 --> 00:02:02,470
But if you're a,
if you're a very ordinary Somali,

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,310
Somali you,
you're getting by on less than a dollar

44
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:07,100
a day.

45
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,100
So there's the ordinary Somalis who are
not criminals or not pirates at least.

46
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,860
And then you asked the majority,
the majority.

47
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,400
And then you have these pirates that are
essentially

48
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,420
running through the streets in Mercedes
Benz.

49
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,440
They're like,
they're like gangsters.

50
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,210
And that's,
that's actually how one Somali,

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,630
who had some connection to Germany.
I'm describing them to me,

52
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,890
you know,
he,

53
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,790
he was wandering around and got kyle
because it was his hometown and in some

54
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:38,070
way or ancestral ancestral town.
And he had met some,

55
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:40,380
this was before I got captured.
It was like they were,

56
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,420
you know,
they had wrapped thumping from the SUV.

57
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,700
Did they really?
American rap.

58
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,550
Who knows?

59
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,440
And then they caught us.
We will,

60
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,410
we went back again and they cut to the
chase in another car and we got

61
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:56,680
separated again.
But this time we were held for a longer

62
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:58,390
time and whoever,
my aunt,

63
00:02:58,391 --> 00:02:59,710
when she saw us,
Mexico,

64
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,200
she said,
ha ha.

65
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,420
They catch you guys again.
Just jokingly.

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,560
Wow.
But the third time was like my,

67
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,340
my dad and my mom came over this crazy
idea because we have brothers,

68
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,830
we had cousins in Sunny California.
And my mom said,

69
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,770
you know,
why don't we just borrow their

70
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:21,730
passports,
you know,

71
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:25,300
to cross.
And I don't remember this,

72
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,770
you know,
just found out recently that what

73
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:28,210
happened,
my brother told me,

74
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,000
my little young brother,
um,

75
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,600
we just like a little girl,
like a full on little girl because I

76
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,200
thought we had a three passports and two
were boys.

77
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:46,201
One was a girl and we took straws,
the guest and my mom and my aunt,

78
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,600
the forest,
my little brother to be a little girl.

79
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,660
How did they make him look like a girl?
They just in my little girl for two

80
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:54,340
weeks just to play around,
you know,

81
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,610
they give them a fake name and so and
so.

82
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,290
And he was playing,
you know,

83
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,310
dancing.
No,

84
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:01,340
I know,
you know,

85
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,350
dancing,
getting ready,

86
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,830
playing with Barbie dolls.
And so he was preparing,

87
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:07,930
preparing broke deniro,
bro.

88
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,420
Wow.
Getting ready for that row of his life.

89
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,300
Wow.
How old was he?

90
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,820
He was two.
At least two or three young.

91
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,660
We,
we,

92
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,240
we talk about determinism versus
freewill.

93
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,490
We talk about what are the,
what,

94
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,350
what's created,
what are the possibilities that is

95
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:30,760
created as Sean Carroll and why?
Why do you think the way you think and

96
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:33,580
why are you going to say the next thing
you're going to say and is it,

97
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,850
how much of it is biological?
How much of it is your life experience?

98
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:39,250
How much of it is information that's
dancing in your head?

99
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,240
How much are you interacting with me?
The last thing that I've said to you?

100
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,700
Yeah,
so I had a.

101
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,150
I was on the same Harris,
this podcast.

102
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:50,110
We had a long conversation about this
because he is very anti freewill and I

103
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:50,781
think that it's.
I,

104
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:52,930
I disagree with him,
but I don't care.

105
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:55,810
I think kind of boring to be honest is
he think it's boring room.

106
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,830
I think it's boring because here's why I
think it's boring because there's two

107
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:02,080
questions.
One question is how does the world work?

108
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,020
And the other question is what words
should be attached to how the world

109
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:08,140
works and the first one is interesting
and the second one is kind of boring.

110
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,950
I see what you're saying.
I've seen seminar,

111
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,680
I agree on how the world works,
right?

112
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,020
But I am what philosophers call a
compatiblist when it comes to freewill,

113
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,160
which,
which is,

114
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,410
I don't think that I have some ways of
thinking my way into overcoming the laws

115
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:24,250
of physics,
right?

116
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,410
Like I'm made of atoms made,
uh,

117
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,920
particles that obey the laws of physics.
If I talk about myself as a large

118
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,140
collection of atoms and particles
obeying the laws of physics,

119
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,890
then clearly there's no free will.
There's just a solution to the equations

120
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:41,440
and sometimes the wave function branches
and there's now two of me,

121
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,830
but that's whatever it is.
There's no spark of consciousness that

122
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,710
lets me overcome what the equation site
is going to happen.

123
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,010
But guess what?
That's not a fruitful way to go through

124
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:53,410
your life in terms of talking about
human beings.

125
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:56,610
When you meet somebody for the first
time and you say like,

126
00:05:56,611 --> 00:05:57,201
you know,
what do you do?

127
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:59,240
Who are you?
They don't give you a list of their

128
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,000
atoms and say what every atom is doing
and say,

129
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:03,850
lead you.
Let's go ahead and solve for diggers

130
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,600
equation to figure out what's going to
happen next.

131
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,070
Right?
You tell a story,

132
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:10,160
you say like you're a person,
you know you grew up in a certain place,

133
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,600
you have a certain jobs,
stuff like that.

134
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:16,601
You dramatically condense the
information about who you are into a few

135
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,720
salient points,
and among those salient points are I am

136
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:24,560
a person who thinks and makes decisions.
Every person in the world,

137
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:28,100
no matter how anti-free will they are
talks about people as if they make

138
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:31,490
decisions and the reason they do is
because that's how people are.

139
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,230
That's the best way to talk about
people.

140
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:37,370
It's not like just a compromise,
like if you don't know the atoms and

141
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:41,690
molecules in somebody's body and you're
not infinitely computationally powerful,

142
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,470
so you can predict the future,
then it's correct to talk about people

143
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,410
as agents who make decisions.
We call that freewill.

144
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,350
I call that freewill.
Most philosophers call it free will.

145
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,990
If you don't want to call it free will
be my guest.

146
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:54,810
I don't really.

147
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,350
He and he would say,
squids.

148
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,940
This is how we learn to play with the
fuck we play and nobody could touch the

149
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:03,490
bad brains musically.
Energy on stage,

150
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:06,010
nothing and I will see these dudes.
I'd be like,

151
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:10,240
what the fuck are you into?
And then the role models that,

152
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:12,410
like you said it,
you know,

153
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,590
we need good role models.
There's,

154
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,440
you know,
there's so many fucked up people that

155
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,260
these kids want to emulate today.
You know,

156
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:22,360
and I see it because I came up in New
York,

157
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:24,610
I worked in all the underground hip hop
clubs.

158
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,410
I work for the Pope Pot.
I used to deliver part to all the rap

159
00:07:29,411 --> 00:07:31,690
stars.
I deliver pot pot,

160
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,990
my friend a.
do Matt Work for Tristar.

161
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:37,060
You can yo meet me at the Boston Comedy
Club.

162
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,590
There's this black comedian there and
he's going to be fucking huge and I

163
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:44,230
would show up on my bike and you know
who you know,

164
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,010
who the fuck it was?

165
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,890
Dave spelled Dave Chappelle,
Dave Chappelle.

166
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,430
And when he did half baked,
did you notice that he put the weed

167
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:54,430
delivery guy in all bike gear will fuck
you dig.

168
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:56,620
He got that from.
I used to show up.

169
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,090
I never carried a bag.
I showed up with a $40,000.

170
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:04,210
Carbon free boat.
Carbon fiber frame and I had a black

171
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:07,570
water bottle and all the weed bags was
into two water bottles.

172
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:12,100
So it just looked like I was a cyclist
out on a motherfucking out on a ride.

173
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,600
Dave Chappelle.
Yeah.

174
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,600
And then Dave,
Dave Chappelle,

175
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,380
when he blew up so fast,
Matt was the guy's name.

176
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:25,381
He was the publicist at Tristar pitches
and then I delivered to him into Boston

177
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,300
Comedy Club.
And within like months he was living in

178
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:33,070
some police show fucking spot on,
like second avenue and 15th in the

179
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,570
guild.
Had a fuck.

180
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,480
Did you get from there?
You know,

181
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,500
there was one flight to where he was
like in the center of the Octagon

182
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,780
Control and Peter struycken and like,
I forget who was,

183
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,260
might've been the name of it,
have been somebody else,

184
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:44,830
but he,
uh,

185
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,670
he actually stopped and step back and
put us back to the fence and say,

186
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:49,241
come on,
come on,

187
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:50,050
let's fight on the fence now.

188
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,220
And he backed his self.
Oh,

189
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,450
bond.
That's right.

190
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:53,960
And that's when he got caught with a
spin and elbow.

191
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:56,040
Was it a no,
Stephan Bonner

192
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,220
tried to spinning back,
kick him and he just slid out of the way

193
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:00,830
and they went right back to the fence
and went,

194
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,370
come on.
That's what it was.

195
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:03,540
Exactly.
Fucked him up.

196
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,560
I think he hit him with the need of the
body and then dropped him and then and

197
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:09,300
then beat the shit out of him.
Yeah,

198
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:13,290
that was just,
he was just so calm and relaxed in there

199
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:17,320
and bonner was so stiff and tight and I
think that was it.

200
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,830
Yeah.
I've worked with Stephen for a bunch of

201
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:21,210
fights.
I didn't work on for that but I don't

202
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:22,800
recall,
but that was also fight.

203
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,500
We're,
I think Bonner pissed hot.

204
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,360
I think he had an opportunity.
Yeah,

205
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:28,650
I think he just like,
listen,

206
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,930
I got some injuries where I'm just going
to juice it up.

207
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,090
Dude.
Pissed hot is better than shit hot.

208
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,950
Cause when he fought Sam Hogart at the
Thomas Mack arena,

209
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,690
he fucking shit himself during the Sam.

210
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,380
Sam Hogan was like,
Bro,

211
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:41,790
it's like on top.
And they grab and he's like,

212
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,230
Bro,
you fucking stinky shit yourself.

213
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:43,861
And he's like,
yes,

214
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:47,070
I did stuff in.
The worst part about is we come

215
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:48,420
backstage,
you know the tea cups,

216
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,570
they like the string up,
the crap,

217
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,030
the crack.
He's like,

218
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:51,990
coach,
get my cup.

219
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,711
And I was like,
Bro,

220
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:56,760
you're on your own home.
I ended up with scissors and cut it off.

221
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,870
I'm good.
So hilarious.

222
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,130
Did I got the corner I think for that
fight with the Great Carlson Gracie at

223
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:04,410
the time when that happened.
Several Times.

224
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,160
Dude,
what was one that get themselves?

225
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,980
Shit himself once.
When we went,

226
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,940
when we run to the,
went to the Reebok uniforms and dudes

227
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,080
wearing white.
I was like,

228
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:13,950
Bro,
that idea.

229
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,900
No white shorts.
Like stay away from white shorts like

230
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,440
Brown.
I think you're well dude.

231
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:21,140
You well vert mirrored the definition.

232
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,360
Yeah,
I think he shouted one of his fights one

233
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,151
time.
Michael Kia.

234
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:27,180
So when he fought biennials right before
the fight started,

235
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:28,140
he leans over to me.
He goes,

236
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:29,290
dude,
my.

237
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,090
Remember that before the walk,
do they almost had to postpone the walk.

238
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,810
Yeah,
man.

239
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,140
He was going to run to UFC.
Fight started.

240
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:37,980
Yeah,
UFC staff.

241
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:39,330
He was in the tunnel getting ready to
walk.

242
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:39,691
He's like,
Bro,

243
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:40,590
I got to go the bathroom.
They're like,

244
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:40,921
Nah,
no,

245
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:41,381
you're good.
You're gonna.

246
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:43,590
He's like,
just let them go wrong.

247
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:46,080
How long did it take?
Thirty seconds.

248
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:48,180
We'll cover,
let the guy took a dump,

249
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,920
right,
and then right behind him,

250
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:51,360
production time,
the format,

251
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,830
fucking schedule,
whatever it is,

252
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:54,760
but do what a man's got a shit.
He's got a shit.

253
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,170
Yeah.
