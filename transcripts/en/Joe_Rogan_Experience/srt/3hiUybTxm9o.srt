1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,700
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,180
Think about how much of
our lives are influenced,

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,540
how much of our society is
built on services that bring
pleasure to our senses.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,930
Our sense of touch.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,590
We can go,

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,940
you go get a massage.

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:17,841
Damn right.

8
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:20,480
You can know the right place.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,260
Our,

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,120
our sense of taste there is food
brought to its high cuisine,

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,530
right?

12
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,770
Our sense of hearing.

13
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:28,300
Sure.

14
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:28,600
We,

15
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,990
we make beautiful music,

16
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:30,950
our sense of sight.

17
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:32,030
We make great art.

18
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,740
So much of what we do is to satisfy
our five traditional senses.

19
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,080
Imagine if we had 10 sensors or 20.

20
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,340
I have a theory on that.

21
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:41,960
It's called the fart principle.

22
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,440
I have no understanding of how that
principal could relate to this,

23
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:46,160
but I'm all ears.

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,993
This is why,

25
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:47,540
um,

26
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,990
if you did not have a nose and you could
live your whole life without a sense of

27
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:52,700
smell in the year 2012,

28
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:54,300
it's very possible if you'd,

29
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,610
if someone foreign in front of you,

30
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:58,430
you'd have no idea that
this terrible gas is,

31
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,510
you're inhaling,

32
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,650
it's in your note.

33
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,820
You wouldn't have that sense of smell.

34
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,110
So you could exist and not have
any idea because gas is invisible.

35
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:06,680
Okay.

36
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,660
That's a bad example
and I'll tell you why.

37
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:09,510
No,

38
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,710
no.

39
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,300
I'll tell you why.

40
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,730
It could be alien life form all around
us all the time that we don't have the

41
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:15,830
sense to like,

42
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:17,450
it's like worms can't see,

43
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,953
but we can.

44
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,960
So to the two things,

45
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:21,794
so first,

46
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,400
uh,

47
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:22,671
it's a,

48
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:26,480
it's a good example in the sense that
no pun intended in the sense of that

49
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,823
without,

50
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,510
if who knows what senses were missing
and therefore who knows what there is to

51
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:35,270
measure in our world around us
that we are completely missing.

52
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,630
Right.

53
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,463
All right.

54
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,610
Get back to that in a minute.

55
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,710
Regarding your fart theory.

56
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,220
Yes.

57
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,053
Here's the problem.

58
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:41,750
All right.

59
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,200
The,

60
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,430
my theories of for a peer review,

61
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,280
it is totally getting peer reviewed.

62
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:46,850
The good life.

63
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,200
It's the right thing to call it too.

64
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,910
It's a legitimate hypothesis.

65
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:50,420
Thank you.

66
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,650
It's out on the table now.

67
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:52,101
Here you go.

68
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:52,820
You're ready.

69
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,653
It's my life's work.

70
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,980
One of the active ingredients in the
smell of a fart is hydrogen sulfide.

71
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,330
It turns out hydrogen
sulfide is extremely lethal.

72
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,440
Is One of the most lethal
gasses that exists.

73
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,151
Well,

74
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:16,860
why do we have such a good
sense of smell for that?

75
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,530
Why don't we smell other gay?

76
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:20,820
Why don't we smell nitrogen?

77
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,703
Well,

78
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,240
we don't need to smell nitrogen because
it's not going to kill us because it's

79
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:29,130
78% of what you breathe.

80
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:29,964
Anyway.

81
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,020
[inaudible] we have evolved
a hypersensitive sense
for the smell of hydrogen

82
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:39,894
sulfide.

83
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,100
If,

84
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,490
if,

85
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,450
if there was a gender,

86
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,180
if you gave birth to someone who said,

87
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:50,160
hydrogen sulfide smells beautiful
and let's smell more of it,

88
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,600
let's get canisters of it.

89
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,381
They're dead.

90
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,490
10 minutes later,

91
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,670
no longer able to propagate the gene
that liked the smell of hydrogen sulfide.

92
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,140
We had to not like that smell.

93
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,480
Otherwise we would not have survived.

94
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,470
The,

95
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:05,561
uh,

96
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:05,921
by the way,

97
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:10,750
hydrogen sulfide is a byproduct of the,

98
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,960
the digestive activity
of anaerobic microbes.

99
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,590
That's why it comes out of your lower
intestine with not only where the sun

100
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:21,041
don't shine,

101
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,840
where oxygen doesn't exist,

102
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,520
the microbes to thrive down there.

103
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,900
They are an aerobic and hydrogen
sulfide is one of their byproducts.

104
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It has been theorized that there have
been places and times on earth where the

105
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:41,101
ocean currents stopped and when ocean
current stop oxygen at the surface of the

106
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:46,450
ocean never makes it to the bottom.

107
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,880
So you can't sustain oxygen life
forms at the bottom of the ocean.

108
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,040
There are no fish,

109
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,240
there wouldn't be any fishes down there
if the ocean currents stopped because

110
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:01,240
the ocean currents not only go from
one place to another in the world they

111
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,110
circle,

112
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,880
they circulate top to bottom.

113
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:04,661
All right,

114
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,600
so it's a two dimensional thing going
on in three dimensions actually.

115
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,500
So,

116
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,940
so if something happens on earth
where you stop the oceanic cycles,

117
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,200
you can create a condition
in the lower ocean,

118
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,810
we're anaerobic lifeforms thrive.

119
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,830
If they thrive,

120
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,700
they out gas and one of the
out gases is hydrogen sulfide.

121
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,310
It will gurgle up from
the bottom of the ocean,

122
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,050
rise up near the shores,

123
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,980
turning shorelines into
the smell of cesspools.

124
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,820
If you were alive at the time
and didn't run away from that,

125
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,340
you would have simply died from it.

126
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,860
That is all well and good.

127
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,210
Therefore the nose,

128
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,940
the nose theory that if
we didn't have a nose,

129
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:48,340
we could all just fart
and we didn't have a nose.

130
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,820
We wouldn't have noticed hydrogen sulfide
and humans would not have survived it

131
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,360
and some other creature would be
having this interview right now.

132
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,420
I not gree with you and disagree
with you at the same time.

133
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,710
It's a,

134
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,710
here's why what you're saying involves
real people and real life adaptation to

135
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:06,694
our environment.

136
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,530
What I'm talking about is
aliens that are just like farts.

137
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,450
That's why so you gave
me a crazy long winded,

138
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,630
really an in depth explanation,

139
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,160
but you still don't discredit
the possibility that just
like the sense of smell,

140
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,360
it exists,

141
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,890
but it is invisible.

142
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,710
There could be many things around
us that are also invisible,

143
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,480
but we have not developed
any means to detect down.

144
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:33,760
Okay.

145
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,080
You were being metaphor.

146
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:35,914
She works right.

147
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,860
Wifi.

148
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,021
Why?

149
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:38,010
But he was a bit swing.

150
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,670
So you being metaphorical
with your father sang live.

151
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,700
No one would have had to have a nose.

152
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,720
I overanalyze it down.

153
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,023
That was cool.

154
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,170
It was cool.

155
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,230
Oh,

156
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,671
by the way,

157
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:58,240
one global warming scenario is the yes.

158
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,870
You see the day after tomorrow.

159
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:00,440
Did you see that?

160
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,480
Unbelievably horrible.

161
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,060
Yeah.

162
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,893
That one was,

163
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,740
was that went to no clothes.

164
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,390
So good.

165
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,870
Who was bad when there was the cancer
baby and everybody else is dead outside,

166
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:11,600
but there she's surviving with the cancer
baby and she's going to stay there for

167
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:12,070
the kid.

168
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,210
We,

169
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,850
while 100 billion people are dead.

170
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,410
It's an awesome,

171
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,760
let me get back to your nose.

172
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,290
Your partner crazy.

173
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,790
Now,

174
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,660
here's why.

175
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,250
You're probably not right.

176
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,311
Well,

177
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:24,410
I'm definitely not right.

178
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:24,921
Look,

179
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:26,000
it's a ridiculous idea.

180
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,171
No,

181
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:26,290
no,

182
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:26,380
no,

183
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:26,471
no,

184
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:26,561
no,

185
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:26,690
no,

186
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:26,781
no,

187
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:27,020
no.

188
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,180
But there's a reason
why you're probably not.

189
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:29,580
Right.

190
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,110
Okay.

191
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,840
Because beginning in the 16 hundreds,

192
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,140
we learned that our senses are not only,

193
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,900
they not only fool us,

194
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,140
they and occasionally don't work.

195
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,100
They're not all that the universe
tells us is they are not,

196
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,080
they don't have the capacity to recognize
all that's going on in the universe.

197
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,201
Well,

198
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:01,730
certainly on a microscopic level.

199
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:01,851
Well,

200
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:02,480
that's my point.

201
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,021
That's my point.

202
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:06,470
So in the early 16 hundreds
to the important advances,

203
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,490
uh,

204
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,990
actually late 1500 you had the invention
of the microscope and you had the

205
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:13,160
invention of the telescope.

206
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,090
This is really the first steps to
enhance our senses beyond what our human

207
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:24,300
biology in doubt us with.

208
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,300
And upon doing so,

209
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,750
we discovered things about the world
that were previously oblivious to us.

210
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,751
We discovered,

211
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,740
knows farts when you wouldn't leave.

212
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:40,741
When hoke brought his telescope and his
microscope to up drop of pond water and

213
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:45,710
saw what we were called Anna macules.

214
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:46,680
What else were you going to call it?

215
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,660
The little things,

216
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:53,210
paramecium had protozoa
thriving in a drop of water.

217
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,250
That was a nose for it.

218
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,280
Keeping with your vocabulary.

219
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,420
That was something that previously
no one had any idea was there.

220
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,800
And my point is,

221
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:08,801
beginning in 1600 and with an
ever improving march forward,

222
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,940
the methods and tools of science
have served to enhance our senses,

223
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,860
increase our senses,

224
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,050
increased the range of our senses,

225
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,520
but more importantly,

226
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:24,670
give us whole kinds of senses that
your five senses could have never even

227
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,750
imagined that our human biology
couldn't even approximate.

228
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,700
So as so,

229
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,860
so what's an example?

230
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,723
Um,

231
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:35,600
yeah.

232
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,050
Uh,

233
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,340
we don't have senses to
detect magnetic field at all.

234
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,140
That's why you can sit in a Mri
Chamber and sit there and you know,

235
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:49,370
whistle Dixie and you'll have no idea
the strength of the magnetic field that's

236
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:50,600
being cast across your body.

237
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,010
We don't have sensors for it.

238
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,200
You don't have sensors for radio?

239
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:55,320
Well,

240
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,160
we're radio waves.

241
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:56,994
What the,

242
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,150
the difference there is we do have sensors
for one aspect of the electromagnetic

243
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:04,140
spectrum.

244
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,540
We have sensors for infrared,

245
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,240
visible and a delayed
since for ultraviolet.

246
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,550
Does that mean?

247
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:11,880
Oh Wow.

248
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,430
Sorry about that.

249
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,051
That's pretty loud.

250
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:14,300
And creative ringtone.

251
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,143
Just like mine,

252
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,550
I learned that aren't dangerous.

253
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,380
He goes old school.

254
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,030
Yeah.

255
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,863
Uh,

256
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,180
so,

257
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,000
uh,

258
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,190
so the point is the radio waves are part
of the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

259
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:26,610
We,

260
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,090
we have access to some of that and
we call that for obvious reasons.

261
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,033
Visible light,

262
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,440
right?

263
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,270
But outside of the range of visible light,

264
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,920
you have ultraviolet x rays,

265
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:35,521
gamma rays,

266
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,241
radio waves,

267
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,170
microwaves.

268
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,280
So yes,

269
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:39,540
we can't see radio waves,

270
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,620
but that would just be an
extension of our senses in the way.

271
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:44,850
Jordy in Star Trek,

272
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,530
the next generation had his visor
though that visor allowed him to see the

273
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:50,960
entire school star track on.

274
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,620
I got it.

275
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,770
I had to go there just because I had uh,

276
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,580
and my sideburns or star Trek sideburns.

277
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:57,170
I don't know if he,

278
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:57,500
uh,

279
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,010
so he puts the,

280
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,880
well he,

281
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,300
that visor enabled him to see the
entire electromagnetic spectrum.

282
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,950
If we were thusly equipped,

283
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,270
you'd walk down the street and the
microwave towers would be ablaze with

284
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:12,840
microwaves and you tune
into sort of ultraviolet.

285
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,740
And if you,

286
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,160
you'd think twice about going to the
beach because that's the stuff that gives

287
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:18,060
you skin cancer,

288
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,920
especially people with lighter skin.

289
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,970
If you,

290
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,210
if,

291
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,043
um,

292
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,190
if you want to see,

293
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:23,910
uh,

294
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,361
what would it be?

295
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:26,640
A good example if you want to see if
there's a burglar entering your house,

296
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:28,140
just shift over to infrared.

297
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,240
If the burglar is warm blooded,

298
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,420
they will show up even if all the
lights around like the Predator.

299
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:33,961
Uh,

300
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:34,590
exactly,

301
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,071
exactly.

302
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:36,630
It's another way to detect the light.

303
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,830
So,

304
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,180
so we have,

305
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:44,181
so science has broadened our senses and
given a sense is that our human biology

306
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:48,120
could not have even
thought of or invented.

307
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:53,570
So the notion at this day and age that
something is happening on this tabletop

308
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,660
that is eluding us,

309
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,570
I think is just simply unlikely because
we're so good now at finding things that

310
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:03,404
previously,

311
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,583
uh,

312
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,950
escaped our notice right
in front of us right now.

313
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:12,420
That frontier is that the energy
extremes of the cern accelerator in

314
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,170
Switzerland,

315
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,910
that frontier is at the James Webb space
telescope where we're going to look at

316
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:21,420
the earliest formation of matter
in the history of the universe.

317
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,550
These are the extremes of our
measurements of nature today.

318
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,890
[inaudible]

319
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,750
you're a fucking human being.
