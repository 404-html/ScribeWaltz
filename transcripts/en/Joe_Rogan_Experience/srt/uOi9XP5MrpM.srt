1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,883
Hey Dude.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,740
Okay.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,480
The Joe Rogan experience.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,270
Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,930
Once upon a time we were in
Phoenix, Arizona. And uh,

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,570
there was like an open mic competition.
Was that what it was?

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,690
No, I think it was um, a contest
for the Las Vegas comedy. Yeah.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,800
Festival.
Ah,

9
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:33,801
it was a Los Vegas comedy festival contest
and the one young man stood out and a

10
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:37,830
wound up working with us that weekend
and it's this Guy Josh McDermitt who was

11
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:39,180
on the fucking walking dead now.

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,710
Yeah, man. How's that
happen? I don't know man.

13
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:45,790
I was just talking to Brian about
it. Like I'm, I've hit the jackpot

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,850
dude. You got a lottery ticket. You
get the Willy Wonka golden ticket.

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,560
You're on like one of
the greatest shows ever.

16
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,650
It was my favorite show before I came in.

17
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:57,790
So literally like I hit the fan lottery
and I'm just like, I don't know man.

18
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,800
It's weird. It's really surreal to
think about like cause that show,

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,060
I don't know man w that show in Phoenix
that we did like you were doing a

20
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:07,870
weekend there and then,

21
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,830
then they asked the audience after your
show to stick around so that they could

22
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:12,664
do this little,

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,480
it was like a contest or some sort of
showcase to select someone to go to this

24
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:21,460
festival and they put me last and the
first comment goes up and half of your

25
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:23,500
crowd,
like most of your crowds stuck around.

26
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,820
Half the crowd walks after the first
comic and I was like, ah shit man.

27
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:31,240
And I'm sitting in the back next
to you and I hadn't met you.

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,420
I mean I met you like as I worked at
that radio station, but like you know,

29
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:35,350
we didn't know each other.

30
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,710
You're just eating your meal and you're
watching this and I'm looking at you and

31
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:42,010
you're not laughing at anybody because
it wasn't funny. And I was like,

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,130
oh this sucks man. Like Rogan's
just going to be like, man,

33
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:48,220
these guys fucking suck. Like he's going
to talk trash about us or whatever.

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,900
More and more people keep leaving too.
As the show's going on to,

35
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,320
to the point that's like a 500 seat
theater and there's like 30 people left by

36
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:59,710
the time I get up and I didn't
give a shit at that point.

37
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,030
And literally I heard you laughing the
loudest in the back am I sat and I'm like,

38
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:05,620
well that's a victory I guess.

39
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:08,260
And then I got to go to the festival
and that was fun and everything.

40
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,210
But like you literally, you
asked me, you're like, hey,

41
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,610
you know you want to open for
me the rest of the weekend.

42
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:16,940
And that just kind of set me on this
path to come to la and pursue acting and

43
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:18,790
the continue to do
standup and all that dude.

44
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:23,770
Like I don't know how much you realize,
like how important you've been to me, man.

45
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,600
Seriously. That's ridiculous. I wouldn't
be here. I literally wouldn't be here.

46
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,590
Wow. Well that's amazing because you're,
you're fucking fantastic on that show,

47
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:36,730
dude. So it was all meant
to be one of those things.
Yeah. I don't believe in fate,

48
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:39,490
but if I did believe in fate,
there's plenty of evidence.

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,880
There's plenty of evidence. Yeah.
And if there's a fucking bill Hicks,

50
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,880
bio pic dude,
you're playing,

51
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,340
you're not the first person to tell me
this is Craig Russell Crowe's got like

52
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,790
got the rights to some like bill story.

53
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,650
Yeah, well they'll probably ruin it. It's,

54
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,360
it's probably not something you want to
be involved with anyway. And it's like,

55
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,280
it seems like every time
they do a about a guy

56
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,730
that it was a real person, they just
butchered the reality and fuck with it.

57
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,870
What are they doing something with
Kinison awhile ago supposedly. Yeah,

58
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,350
I saw some trailer come out with some guy,
I don't remember who he is.

59
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,350
Like I recognize them from different
movies but like he was on stage just being

60
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:20,420
Sam and I was like, oh
my God, this is amazing.

61
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:22,700
But that was like five years ago and
I hadn't heard anything about that.

62
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:26,330
I haven't seen that. I never saw a train
know who it was. It was in that movie.

63
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,080
Take me home tonight with Topher grace.
He played one of the guy,

64
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,820
he like his friend in it, Dan, Josh Gad.
It wasn't John. He was a Josh Gad type,

65
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,040
says Josh Gad to play Queen.

66
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,830
A place names dude that walked
in and out because of projects.

67
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:46,220
Probably been on the shelf for so long.
They'll fuck it up

68
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,750
because they're doing that
prior movie too, aren't they

69
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,590
that up too? I think that already came
out. Yeah, the prior moon. No, no.

70
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:58,740
You're thinking of the Jimi Hendrix movie
that came out and that was dog shit.

71
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,120
They ruined them, man. I mean,
you know, there's this guy,

72
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,390
Mark Schultz and he was the
Olympic wrestler that, uh,

73
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,090
his brother Dave Schultz got
killed by that guide. John Dupont,

74
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:14,670
that crazy millionaire billionaire guy
in Connecticut. They fucked that up, man.

75
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,790
I went to see that movie
and you know, he was, he,

76
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,290
he's Mark Schultz made a bunch of tweets
about it. About how pissed off he was.

77
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,670
Yeah. About the, they fucked with his
story. They fucked with his timeline.

78
00:04:26,671 --> 00:04:29,940
They fucked with how much success
he actually had as a wrestler.

79
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:33,810
Before he went to, he was
already an Olympic gold
medalist and a world champion.

80
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:35,880
They made it out like it
was struggling and sure,

81
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,110
they added a bunch of weird
gay shit. They, they, they,

82
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,870
they changed the timeline of when he
fought in the UFC and the UFC fought a

83
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:47,220
white guy instead of a black guy.
They changed the timeline of the UFC.

84
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:52,221
He made the UFC in 1987 didn't even
exist until 1993 like Hollywood is filled

85
00:04:53,281 --> 00:04:54,450
with assholes,

86
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,980
just filled with assholes and
think that they can alter reality.

87
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,030
We talking about a real life story.
A guy's real fucking story.

88
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,300
Yeah. It's, they do seem to screw it
up a lot, but I don't really know.

89
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:08,280
Is there anyone that they've done that?

90
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,630
Has there been a movie that we kind
of go, oh yeah, that's pretty great.

91
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,980
You never, Lenny, Dustin
Hoffman Played Lenny Bruce and
he fucking nailed it. Yeah,

92
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:22,210
it was, and it was a really good movie.
Like, if you watch that movie, Lenny,

93
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:26,080
you really feel like, you
kind of understand what Lenny
Bruce was going through.

94
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,560
This is back when he was being tried
for censorship. He would, he would,

95
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,510
he would go in front of these courts and
they would make, they would do his act.

96
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:37,390
They would read his act out loud,
like the words that he said,

97
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,370
convict him for these, uh,
these profanity charges. I mean,

98
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:45,070
that guy really fucking paved the path.
If it wasn't for him,

99
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:50,071
you and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't
for the guys that like him and George

100
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:51,701
Carlin,

101
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:56,350
the guys that actually went to jail for
saying words that we say on a regular

102
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,220
basis. Right. If there's a 50

103
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,070
fucking years ago, it wasn't that
long ago. I know. It's crazy.

104
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:02,990
If you really stop and
think it's insanity, man.

105
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,280
Did you see that preview for the New
Light Nwa movie? That looks pretty legit.

106
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:11,310
I mean, it's a great trailer
documentary, isn't it? No,
no, no. It's uh, actually, uh,

107
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,140
it's just about them growing up. It
was a neat, yeah, it's kind of like,

108
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,850
and they have a guy that looks
kind of like ice cube and it,

109
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,920
I mean he sounds just like ice
cube. It's really neat. Who's in it?

110
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,310
A bunch of no names mostly.
But uh,

111
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,320
I guess that's why the whole thing
happened with the big guy. TMZ,

112
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:34,130
Josh McDermitt tweeting. Wally's on a
fucking podcast. Can't do it. Put it down.

113
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:38,650
I'm trying, I'm trying to find that guy.
Which guy here? Sam Kennison guy here.

114
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,640
He found it. You put the picture
up on the edge. Yeah. So isn't it?

115
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,473
Hold on.

116
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,533
How dare you,

117
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,990
you were making such a big deal
over there. There. Yeah. This,

118
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,480
what does the screen test? Dan
Fogler screen test. Tony winner.

119
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:01,610
Is that who the guy is? Well that's
a screen test. Hold on. Stop.

120
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,640
That's a screen test. That's
not a trailer. Yeah, I didn't,

121
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,580
I didn't know it was a screen
test when I watched it. It did.

122
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,970
I mean I would have known if it
said screen test, but wherever, uh,

123
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,360
yeah, I mean, yeah, I saw it.
That might not be him. I mean,

124
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,530
either way they'll ruin it probably,

125
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,820
but if they do a bill Hicks
one and they're going to
ruin it and give you a lot

126
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:23,370
of money, I say fine. I'd rather,
if we're going to ruin it, it,

127
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:26,640
I'd rather it be me ruining it.
Then someone else, you know, let's,

128
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:28,140
let's have some respect for the guy.

129
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,260
Do that character you play on the
walking dead. It's very unusual.

130
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:35,790
That's a weird character.
Like a strange sort of pseudo autistic,

131
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,150
really intelligent but fucked up
dude involved in like one of the,

132
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,580
like the shows not even about
the monsters anymore. No,

133
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,760
it's about the humans and their
interactions with each other and just them

134
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:52,570
surviving, you know, the,
um, the apocalypse. I mean,

135
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:56,080
the biggest threat isn't, yeah,
isn't the zombies, it's, you know,

136
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,240
the guy with the eye patch the governor
or it's like someone else going like,

137
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,310
yeah, you got food and water. I want
that. Yeah. That's what's really scary.

138
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:05,170
But this character,
you know,

139
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:08,650
it's kind of funny when I hear people
like really simplify him and go,

140
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:11,940
he's just weird. And I'm like,
okay, it's a lot more than that.

141
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:15,730
There's a lot more to him. He's
very complex and, um, you know,

142
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:20,590
it's fun to play a different character
on in this world where like, you know,

143
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,340
obviously you got guys like,
you know,

144
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,530
Daryl or Michaun who were just like epic
bad asses and obviously those people

145
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:29,230
are probably going to rise to
the top in this world, you know,

146
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:31,430
just people who are physically
fit and can just, you know,

147
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,280
do whatever they have to do to survive.
This guy is like completely opposite.

148
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:39,010
And that's what becomes fun about
playing him is that, you know,

149
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,150
you just wouldn't expect that.
I think I have a theory that if most be,

150
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:44,620
if the apocalypse happened,
most people would be more like Eugene.

151
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,090
They would like Daryl.

152
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,050
Yeah, most likely. Did you know
the, the whole character arc,

153
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,470
like what was going to
happen to him? Like, I mean,

154
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:56,400
I don't want to give away too much if
you're one of those that binge watches

155
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,310
stop now cause we're probably going
to talk too much about the show.

156
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:01,770
We'll fuck it up for you.
Spoiler alert.

157
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,700
I, um, well obviously the show
is based on a comic. So you know,

158
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:11,010
the information is out there from there.
But on the show they like to do it.

159
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,420
They'd like to deviate from
the story lines on the comics.

160
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:14,560
And how much did they deviate?

161
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,450
I mean they'll just create brand new
storylines for people. Um, again,

162
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:21,880
if you haven't watched this
last weekend's episode,

163
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:25,990
there was a major character death, but his
death, you know, he dies in the comics,

164
00:09:25,991 --> 00:09:29,170
but the death and on the show was
not how they did it in the comics.

165
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,510
There was another character that,

166
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,190
that guy's death was this guy from
last weekend's death in the comics.

167
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:40,450
And it's show, it just gets
mixed around. Um, but with, uh,

168
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,270
so I knew that, you know,
when I took the job,

169
00:09:43,271 --> 00:09:46,750
I knew that the big reveals
that my character would have,

170
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,870
and this is weird to be talking
about it in vague terms.

171
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:53,640
I feel like if you haven't seen it by now,
yeah, fuck you. If you haven't seen it.

172
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,340
It was, so we find out Eugene was lying
about knowing the cure. But the moment,

173
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,060
cause I came on in season four, I knew
that, um, he was lying the whole time.

174
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,500
Oh, okay. Um, but you know, I don't think
some of the other actors knew, you know,

175
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,610
because they don't read the comics.

176
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:12,310
They don't really tell us what's going
on with other people's storylines.

177
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,050
Right. And you don't know necessarily
whether they're going to stick with that

178
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:18,480
storyline that's in the comic or
whether they're going to deviate.

179
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,340
Right. And so that's where like, you know,

180
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,720
I knew that I was lying and that,
uh, once I, once that was revealed,

181
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:29,320
like all bets are off. Like I don't
know how much longer I have, you know,

182
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:31,990
how much longer be I'll be on the show
because they like to kill off their main

183
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:34,420
characters. So I'm just like, Oh shit.

184
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,820
All right. Hey man, this is going
to launch you, dude. I mean, you're,

185
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:41,340
you're on one of the best shows ever.

186
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,810
Dude is insane. It's epic. It's so good.

187
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,500
I watched last night and I was
squeezing my wife's hand while the show.

188
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:51,630
I've watched it. They didn't,
you know, this week's episode,

189
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:53,880
I didn't watch it until last night.
I'm just, cause she's like, Oh man,

190
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,890
like on my hand handling you get
fucking crazy. It's such a good show.

191
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
And it wasn't for a while.
It was really good in the beginning.

192
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,520
And then it was like a little dip where
I was like, oh, don't go Dexter on me.

193
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:07,470
You fucks. Don't, don't fail.

194
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,680
But then it pulled out like a
Phoenix rose from the ashes.

195
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:11,640
Even greater than before.

196
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,500
I know, man. It's, it's
insanity cause like,

197
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,010
so the guy who runs our show now,
Scott Gimble,

198
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,800
he and I don't really pay attention
to who writes episodes. Like I just,

199
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,290
I'm just like, oh, that's
my favorite episode,

200
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,970
but I'm not like looking up who wrote it.

201
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,140
So I started going back and looking at
my favorite episodes and I found out who

202
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:30,360
wrote it and it was Scott Gimple's.

203
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:34,420
So my favorite episodes from season three
was that episode clear where they're

204
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:37,450
in that dude's apartment and he's got
all the writing on the wall and like he's

205
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:39,820
gone absolutely crazy.
Do you remember this guy,

206
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,200
Scott Campbell wrote that episode?
I was like, oh this is awesome.

207
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:45,280
It's one of my favorite episodes.

208
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:49,390
And then the other favorite episode
of mine was, um, when Sophia,

209
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,630
the little girl came out of the barn and
she was a Zombie and they had to kill

210
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:54,010
her and it's like

211
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,050
he wrote that episode and I'm like,
okay.

212
00:11:56,051 --> 00:12:00,250
So this guy running the show now has
written my favorite episodes all along and

213
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:03,670
it's like he's like the best guy to be
running the show because you're right.

214
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:06,970
I think, you know, it did kind of take
it down. It was still a good show,

215
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:09,670
but it's just like, it just kind
of like plateaued for a moment.

216
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:12,640
This is just me observing as a fan.
You know what it felt like.

217
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:17,170
It felt like a regular show. It's like,
it was so extraordinary in the beginning,

218
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,380
like the character arc between Rick and
his buddy who was banging his wife cause

219
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:25,540
they thought Rick was dead.
Like all that crazy shit.

220
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,090
It was so much nutty tension.
It's just like,

221
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,660
it left you in this weird space while
you're watching now where you didn't know

222
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:34,960
what to expect. And then the zombies were
new at that point. And it was, it was,

223
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:38,800
it was so much going on. It was like,
whoa. Every time the, the, you know,

224
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:42,220
it would fade the black at the end of the
episode, you'd be like, fuck, you know,

225
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,510
you just have to catch your breath.

226
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,400
And then it got to be like
a lazy Hollywood show. And
I was like, what happened?

227
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:53,050
Did some fuck head producer weasel his
way into a position of power and start

228
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:55,810
manipulating and shit and trying to
turn it into a number of the episode of

229
00:12:55,811 --> 00:13:00,220
coach or something like that. Yeah. Just,
you know, administering Nelson shows up.

230
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,290
Like something happened like that.
Like it just became like a regular show.

231
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,340
I don't know the specifics, but
um, frank Darabont, you know,

232
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:11,220
Shawshank redemption is great.

233
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,400
Hollywood screen writer and director
develop the show from the comics and then

234
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:17,500
he, he was in charge of
it the first two seasons,

235
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:20,350
but then he left after the second season.

236
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,190
And so it's about the third season that
they kind of dip went over some rocky

237
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:26,710
terrain. Like, you know, they did
it. There was some great episodes.

238
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:29,110
It might be my favorite
episode is in season three,

239
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,940
but there they just didn't really hit.
It was very inconsistent.

240
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:36,820
And so then when Scott Gamble
took overseas and for it,

241
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:41,140
just took them right off right
off. It's amazing now. God Damn,

242
00:13:41,141 --> 00:13:45,340
it's a good show. He's, you know, cause I
think just watching it as a fan, I would,

243
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,980
it would kind of get boring at
times where I'd be like, okay,

244
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:51,210
like they run out of supplies and
they're going to go on a run and oh,

245
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,630
it's not me. Pops out, kill it,
and then rinse, repeat, whatever.

246
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,010
So, but now they're like really developing
the characters and like bringing them,

247
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,610
you know, we're learning so
much more about them. It's
like fricking great. Well,

248
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:07,310
it's made, it makes me nervous. Every
time there's a new scene, it's like, it's,

249
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:10,120
it's so good right now.
Every time there's a new scene,

250
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,480
like literally entered into that
community where, uh, the, the,

251
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:17,170
the kid who played kick Chris rock grew
up in and as soon as you entered the

252
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:20,080
community, I'm like, Oh fuck yeah.
You know, like what's happening here?

253
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,560
Like you're fucking, Paul starts
racing, you start getting sweaty hands.

254
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,800
She like a little nonchalant about it.
Like they're just coming in,

255
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:28,930
just maybe checking around
and you're like, oh no,

256
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:31,720
you've gotta be looking everywhere
at this point. It's so good man.

257
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:35,500
And when he got bit like you
see just a shadow behind him,

258
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,620
just a brief shadow before it comes out.
It's like,

259
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:43,060
it's not enough that you, you know, you
see it clearly coming. It's like, oh fuck.

260
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:44,620
What does that, what does that, is that,

261
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,470
is that the kid that he's
with or is that someone else?

262
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,070
Who's The fucking shadow man?
Who's The fucking Chad?

263
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,840
The great thing about that bite was that
it happened like 20 minutes into the

264
00:14:56,841 --> 00:15:00,260
episode as opposed to like,
sometimes they'll wait until
the very end. It's like,

265
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,980
oh no. And then they just, and then
the episode ends like he get bit,

266
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,670
he gets bit and then he has his,
you know,

267
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,620
hallucinogenic dreams and all
this about these, you know,

268
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,740
pass characters are coming back and
all this. I mean it was like a very,

269
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,650
Robert Kirkman, the guy who
created the comics was saying like,

270
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:18,740
it's going to be a fan favorite episode
is going to be a fan hated episode

271
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:19,574
because it's like,

272
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,840
it's a very poetic type of
episode that they wrote.

273
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:28,580
I really loved that dude too. I'm going
to miss him. He's nuts. He's so funny,

274
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:31,250
man. Is He, you got to get
a lot of here. He's like,

275
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:35,240
the funniest guy is very subtle and then
you just get them on a roll and he's

276
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:37,040
just like large and gregarious.

277
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,480
Like he mispronounces everything and
I don't know if he's doing it as a bit

278
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,930
like he goes,
there was some,

279
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,360
I guess he went to like University of
Virginia or something and there are some,

280
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,320
some school in Virginia in and they're
like doing away with sat scores are only

281
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:58,280
gonna focus on the GPA now. And then
he retweets it and puts it the front.

282
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,680
Oh hell yeah. My Alma Marta, Marta,

283
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,830
and may our DA. You don't know
if he's like kidding or not,

284
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:10,340
but like we were over at the table where
they keep all the food one day when we

285
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:14,960
were filming and he's just going to get,
yeah, go, oh, you see something you like?

286
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:18,080
He's like, yeah, I'm going
to eat me some beef jersey.

287
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,040
And I like, I just look at it. I
don't know. I don't laugh. I'm like,

288
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:29,780
is he just like dumb or is he doing this
on purpose? Like he's the funniest guy.

289
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,790
He's so funny. I'll hook it up,
I'll, I'll get, I'll get him in here.

290
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,060
He's great because he's off doing another
show now, I guess. Yeah, it's, I mean,

291
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:43,061
it's gotta be weird when you're on like
an amazing show and then all of a sudden

292
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:45,620
your debt, it ends, it ends for you.

293
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:48,530
And you sit back and you're watching
it as it's still on television.

294
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:50,990
You watched on the guys who worked with,
you know,

295
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:53,990
and occasionally they bring you back
for some dream sequence and you're,

296
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,550
and you're thinking, you know, it's
very cliche to say, but it's so real.

297
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:02,280
Like we're like, we're just a major,
like a big family there, you know,

298
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:05,630
cause we're in the woods in Georgia,
it's the worst time of year to be there.

299
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,630
It's hot and humid fighting off ticks
and bugs and use things called chiggers

300
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,180
that like burrow into your skin and
everything and then you're just out there

301
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:16,550
like with your friends
and family and it's great.

302
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:19,820
And all of a sudden now you die
and you can't come to work anymore.

303
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,230
He can't come to this horrible environment
anymore and you just want it so bad.

304
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:25,730
But um,
you know,

305
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:28,670
we'd go around and we do all these
like comic con conventions and stuff,

306
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,080
which is like, dad is trippy, but like
we get to hang out then and everything.

307
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:38,060
So you never really fully, you know,
disappear. That dude who was, um,

308
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,510
Rick's buddy, what was his
name? Shane. Shane, yeah.

309
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,630
That guy is in a lot of shit.
Like, he's in a lot of movies.

310
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:48,400
He's really good loan up. He's
really, do you see fury? No.

311
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,560
Fury was great. Um, I don't know
if it was based on a true story.

312
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:56,990
You're not the Brad Pitt tank movie, but
Jon Bernthal, that's the character, the,

313
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,100
the actor's name.
Phenomenal.

314
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,320
Like I was surprised he didn't
get nominated for an Oscar.

315
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,500
He was great in the wolf of
Wall Street too. Oh yeah.
Yeah, he's really good. He's,

316
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,200
he's like an ex boxer or something.

317
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,960
So like everything he ever does
is very physical. All this rolls,

318
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:14,960
he wants to just be, I mean he treats
it like he's in the boxing ring.

319
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,070
Didn't he get in trouble for beating
somebody up? Something happened.

320
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,620
Yeah, I think I'm lazy. He Lo,

321
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,970
he has pitbulls I think he rescues
pit bulls and then, you know,

322
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,430
lives in La and some douche
bag was complaining about
his pit bulls or whatever.

323
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:31,980
And then his pit bull started
getting a little feisty and angry.

324
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:35,920
And then I think, I think he just
popped him in the face. Oh, I rude.

325
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,500
Like a gentleman. I don't know. There's
probably stories about it online,

326
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:45,000
but I think the guy was just like, oh, bit
balls, whatever the fuck you, boom. Wow.

327
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,940
Like one of those things. But he's
a great guy. He's really cool.

328
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,450
Yeah. He's a really good
actor too. That the whole arc,

329
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:54,840
that story arc between him and
Rick was just suck. Oh Well Huh.

330
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,580
I've done just as many episodes as him
now granted like he was at the forefront

331
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:01,780
with like, you know, all his, uh, with,

332
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,230
with the storylines and stuff that
I've done just as many episodes,

333
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:08,760
but like he is just like at this
other level I can't ever compare with,

334
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,580
you know, what do you mean?
Well, he, I mean he's just like,

335
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,680
it was such an iconic character in
this huge storyline within that show.

336
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:21,270
So the first season was only six episodes
and then I did four episodes my first

337
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:22,260
season,
so like,

338
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,040
and then he dies to the next season
and I did just as many episodes as him.

339
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,770
Does that make sense?
Like sort of together.

340
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:30,060
We've done the same amount of episodes,

341
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:34,290
but he's just like at this other level
in terms of like how people remember him

342
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,670
and like the character and all that

343
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,890
classic scenario too, like coveting thy
neighbors wife, you know, that's like,

344
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,280
that's the big thing
with, with men. Like the,

345
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:48,940
one of the men's biggest fear is that
their best friend winds up fucking their

346
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:51,090
girlfriend. Yeah. I mean,
I mean that is a big,

347
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,590
or their wife or the mother
of their children, you know,

348
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,340
and becomes a father to their son.
You know? I mean there's, that's like,

349
00:19:57,341 --> 00:20:00,160
and he wanted to take over and he
tried to kill him. I mean, that whole,

350
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,510
that whole thing was like so intense.
It's such a crazy dynamic in the kid.

351
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,710
The kid's amazing kids going
to to Shane for advice.

352
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,600
Like Rick's getting pissed and I mean,
it was awesome. It was, it was intense.

353
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,510
It was intense.
And it brought you in to this,

354
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,900
this changing dynamic of the
zombies not being the problem,

355
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:23,230
the people being the problem and how
the people react when they have to

356
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:27,600
formulate their own rules. You know,
I mean everybody that says like, uh,

357
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,090
like preppers, everybody says I'm
ready. You know, I got my fucking cans.

358
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:34,710
Like you ain't ready for Shit Dude.
Cause it ain't about that. It's, it's,

359
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,040
it's about how you react to all these
thinking animals that are trying to get

360
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,760
what you have now because
they're starving to death. Right.

361
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,750
Cause that's what the fuck happens
when the, if the apocalypse happened,

362
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:47,020
it's like if the big one hits,
you want to be right where it,

363
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,950
you want the earth to open up,
suck you in and close shut,

364
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,880
don't die of starvation.
Don't die because people are eating you.

365
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:57,040
Like in terminus you,
you want to, you know,

366
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,860
you don't want to be the guy who gets
baseball bat and then gets your fucking

367
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:03,610
throat cut into that.
The trough, you know,

368
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:07,550
you want to be the guy who the
meteor hits right on your face. Yeah.

369
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,380
The vein here,
that wipes out the power grid,

370
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,550
you want it to land right in your
head space. You know what I mean?

371
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:20,400
Really if you're going to go fuck, fuck,
going a year later or 10 years later.

372
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,050
Well, I mean, if you think about it,

373
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:25,480
I mean obviously my character was saying
that he had a cure and everything,

374
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,600
there's probably going to be no cure if
everything starts getting over run at

375
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:31,990
that point, they're not going to figure
out how to reverse it or how to fix it.

376
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,440
So yeah, you want to go first? Well, not
only that, not only is there no cure,

377
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:37,470
but everyone's infected.
Yeah.

378
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,440
That's what's the most fucked up thing
when you find out that everyone who dies

379
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,850
becomes a Zombie. Like when chain died
and they became a Zombie and you know,

380
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:49,210
like, okay, this is nuts. Like
there's no way out. Right?

381
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:53,470
Like you're your way out is gone, right?
Because everyone's a fucking Zombie.

382
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:58,471
So if you make a kid and the kid is just
born into your family and no one that

383
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:01,720
kid dies, it's a fucking Zombie.
Right? Everyone's a Zombie somehow.

384
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,730
Somehow has that. Does that ever
get explained? Don't tell me.

385
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,230
Um, no, I don't think there's, I
don't think they're just going to,

386
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,080
they don't have time to sit around and
figure that out. I think it was like,

387
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:18,490
we got to find a can of beans,
man. I gotta find some fish.
Wait, now guys, hold on.

388
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:20,670
We need to talk about this.
Yeah,

389
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:23,740
it's a w it's a weird
fucking weird scenario.

390
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:28,150
The idea of being the last
remaining survivors and like,

391
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:31,270
did you see the road, uh, who was, uh,

392
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,250
that was that very bleak post
apocalyptic movie with, uh,

393
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:40,750
the fuckers. That dude's name Veit
door. Morgenson what's his name? Vigo.

394
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,810
Vigo.
Morgenson like I did,

395
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,140
I watched it for five minutes until he
was teaching his son how to shoot himself

396
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:50,760
in the mouth. This is what you do, if you
know, if it's all over, you stick through.

397
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,070
Oh, it cut. We're good. I don't
need to see this shit. I just don't,

398
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,980
I just don't need to see this. I mean,
what am I going to get out of this?

399
00:22:56,981 --> 00:22:59,860
I'm going to get, feel depressed.
There's not even any monsters.

400
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,150
At least the walking dead gives me
monsters. Yeah, right. Well, the thing,

401
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,780
the cool thing about the walking dead
too is they're always trying to maintain

402
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:11,860
some sort of humanity, some sort
of like, you know, civility. Yeah,

403
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:13,990
some rules and everything
and they're constantly, like,

404
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:18,160
even this last week's episode, they're
just like, yeah, I've given up, screw it.

405
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,310
Like I wanted to kill that person,
not because of what they did,

406
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:25,660
but just fuck them, you know? And you're
like, oh Geez, like it's all falling away.

407
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,010
And uh, that's kind of where the season's
going. It's just going to get crazier.

408
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,950
I wasn't a big fan of that hospital.
The CIC wearing makeup and all that.

409
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,290
I'm like, come on, get the fuck out
of here with all this. That was,

410
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,410
I thought that was a little ridiculous.
Like she's way too groomed.

411
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,110
She's on her fucking bicycle
every day working out.

412
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:44,470
Everyone's scared of her like that.
I didn't buy that at all.

413
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,570
I felt like that shit
would've lasted about an hour.

414
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,750
We're somebody punched her in the face,
took a gun and shot her in the head,

415
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,890
fucked her dead body, threw her off
the top of the roof. She's evil.

416
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,740
Get out of here. You fucking crazy.
Lipstick weren't [inaudible].

417
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,230
There's a few guys that didn't.

418
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,650
The guy with the eye patch get the fuck
out of here. That guy's a dead. He's dead.

419
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,543
He's not going to live.

420
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,950
You can't even see shit that's
coming from the right side, dude.

421
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,190
You're not going to survive. That is
not, you're not running anything. Okay.

422
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,110
I don't buy it always extra evil.
He doesn't even have superpowers.

423
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,350
Like how's that guy is going to
run? Shit. He's manipulative. How?

424
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,080
He's not even a manipulative. He's not
even demonstrably believe manipulative.

425
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,880
You know? It's like, what is
he doing? Just fucking, it's
weak. It's weak. Weak game.

426
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,300
It's got a week. Colt game. Dammit.
Stand on my left. I can't see you.

427
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,560
God Man. Yeah. There was like, you know,

428
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:40,460
there was a few bad guys in a few moments
that I just thought were ridiculous,

429
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:44,720
but it's the overall quality
of the show that just,

430
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:45,950
it keeps a,

431
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:50,060
keeps surprising you and he keeps drawing
you in and it just keeps making you

432
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:53,780
think like, what would you do if you
were stuck in that kind of a scenario?

433
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:57,560
Would you would just climb to the highest
building and just close your eyes and

434
00:24:57,561 --> 00:25:01,370
fucking jump off? Like what would
you do? Yeah, I don't know. I would,

435
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,120
I would try and survive and
I would probably be one of
the first to go is what I

436
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,850
would do personally. I would
try, I'd be like, okay, I got it,

437
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,320
this and then I'd get bit like,
what about you exactly what I would do.

438
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,560
You don't even watch the show. And I
didn't sleep. No. I started watching it,

439
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,240
but I got to the season three and then
I stopped and I just haven't gone back.

440
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:24,650
But I've read the comics a lot,
most of them. Oh Wow. Uh, which, uh,

441
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,030
I enjoy in and looking at the
comics, there should be like, what,

442
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:33,110
11 or 12 seasons up to already written.

443
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,720
They got so many storylines.
It's not even,

444
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,420
it's a money machine. What? I mean, it's,
it makes so much money. It's so good.

445
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,220
One of the things is I
watch it on the, um, uh,

446
00:25:45,221 --> 00:25:49,600
on Apple TV, which is the only way
to watch it. Watching it on AMC.

447
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:52,990
It's like you just want to fucking
drive to wherever the people are.

448
00:25:52,991 --> 00:25:56,590
Who who put the commercials
in and go, Hey, fucking stop.

449
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,950
Fucking stop. Come on
man. This is not cool.

450
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,900
You got to Hardee's
commercial or a fucking,

451
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,590
you know Carl's Jr jammed in
the middle of murder and mayhem.

452
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,550
All of a sudden people are driving the
newest Toyota truck. We're having a party.

453
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,390
It's fucking so distracting
and so uncomfortable when
you realize that they're

454
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:20,560
shoving in 18 minutes of fucking
commercials in a one hour show.

455
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,420
That's obscene. Yeah, it's rough.
It's obscene. It really is obscene,

456
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,070
but when you watch it on Itunes,

457
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:31,300
it's fucking awesome because you get
the whole show, no interruptions.

458
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,680
Watch it. I tried watching it one time
and we paused and we just left the room.

459
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:35,951
We go.

460
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:38,740
It was just fucking come back in an hour
and fast forward through this bullshit.

461
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,090
Like we tried to just
watch the commercials for a
while and you realize like

462
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,420
what an, that shit is on
your attention span. I just,

463
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,550
it's an assault on your,
your, your reality. Like you,

464
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:53,450
why do you want me to dip in and
out of this world like that? Yeah.

465
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,920
It fucks up the whole
viewing aspect of the show.

466
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,840
Well I, I mean I want to
validate your opinion there,

467
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,900
but he's got to get paid
[inaudible] killed off next season.

468
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,740
I love the commercials.
Commercials are amazing.

469
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:12,850
I wish it was half an hour of the show.
Would you rather prefer like, like,

470
00:27:12,851 --> 00:27:15,160
like commercials bill into the show?

471
00:27:15,161 --> 00:27:18,890
Like they're driving a Toyota car
instead of having a Toyota commercial or

472
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,043
it would have to,

473
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:25,170
the only way it would have to be non
intrusive and there's no way that it would

474
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:28,450
work if it was not in.
She was like, you know,

475
00:27:28,451 --> 00:27:31,390
if you see some people that are fucking
starving to death and they find a can of

476
00:27:31,391 --> 00:27:33,400
coke and they drink it in
a Sharon it back and forth,

477
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,710
it's not going to make you want to
go out and buy a coke. You know,

478
00:27:35,711 --> 00:27:37,330
you know that coke is fucking warm.

479
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,360
It's Georgia finding it in someone's
garage covered in fucking bodies.

480
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:47,230
Three years expired. Yeah. I
mean it's just, it wouldn't work.

481
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,990
And then when they do do that,
they do it like this.

482
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,920
Hey Man, do you think we're going to
get outta here? They're holding it.

483
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:57,870
I don't know
what this fucking good coke,

484
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,490
you know? I mean there's no
way that they had to do it.

485
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,710
Did y'all ever see like
the honest trailers,

486
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:08,970
the youtube channel where they do honest
trailers of movies and TV shows and

487
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:11,250
they did one for the walking dead
where they're just like, pick it apart.

488
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:12,084
It's hilarious.

489
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,150
But one of the things they were talking
about was like they were driving around

490
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,030
like a Hyundai Tucson for a
while and it was always like,

491
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,460
this is the apocalypse
or everything's filthy.

492
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:22,520
There's like a gross film on things.
And,

493
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,260
but the Hyundai Tucson
was like immaculate.

494
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,120
Like they're just cruising through the
woods and this thing and it, like I,

495
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,680
me personally, I never thought
about it. I was never like, oh,

496
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:35,130
I should go buy a Tucson or something.
But not until I saw that trailer.

497
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,490
I was like, oh, I guess I was
product placement. You know,

498
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,530
it had to be, if they're making
it clean. There was one episode,

499
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:42,360
I remember where we were talking
about it. We're like, why?

500
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,810
Why are these cars clean?
I mean even when it rains,

501
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,580
it doesn't really clean your
car. That could, you know,

502
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,680
I mean they have to fucking
have a torrential downpour
to do a half ass job of

503
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:57,060
cleaning your car.
Cause bird shit dirt.

504
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,690
It just kinda gets like moved
around on it. Right. You know?

505
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,430
Well people still have to find their
place in the apocalypse and maybe some

506
00:29:03,431 --> 00:29:05,380
people are like, hey man,
I'm just here to wash cars.

507
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,060
We're alive. We got cars. Let's
Polish him up. Let me wash them.

508
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:12,931
Yeah.

509
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:17,931
I don't think that there's going to be
a ever a show like that that has product

510
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:20,640
placement as opposed to advertising.

511
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,510
But I think it's probably likely and other
shows and like, I mean, then you know,

512
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:27,660
they do that. And like when you watch
iron man, you see him driving an Audi,

513
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,130
Audi paid to get that fucking
car in the movie. I mean it's,

514
00:29:31,131 --> 00:29:33,900
it's appropriate for him. It doesn't
stick out like a sore throat. I'm,

515
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,500
he's driving this cool car. He's a
rich dude. It all makes sense. But,

516
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,460
well you look at
something like madman too,

517
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,960
which is like centered on the world of,

518
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,950
but I think the catch
22 with that is like,

519
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,670
like they can't really do any
current, you know, advertising.

520
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:51,970
They're doing all like old, like lucky
strike cigarettes and this and that.

521
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:54,910
Then it's like, well I don't think those
are around anymore. Are they, you know,

522
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,550
are they around? But it's just, you know,

523
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,400
everything they do is like
from the 60s and whatnot.

524
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,570
So unless it's like General
Electric, which is so vague,
you know, it's still like,

525
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,680
people are like, yeah, that's right.
General Electric. I should go buy a stove.

526
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,850
I've never watched that show. Is that a
good show? Madman? It's good, but it's a,

527
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,610
it's a little slow. It's, I think it's
more geared towards women maybe. Uh,

528
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,630
cause it's very drama kind of.

529
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,790
It's not that guy ish.

530
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,840
Like I just watched it
because my girlfriend wanted
to watch it and that's the

531
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:27,100
only reason I watched it.

532
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,730
And I kind of got addicted to it and kind
of like an a Gilmore girls kind of way

533
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,440
where you're like, oh, I
know all of the characters.

534
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:36,700
So it's still fun to watch Gilmore girls.
I had to watch,

535
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,850
I've watched all the Gilmore girls
because of the girl I was dating and I got

536
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:43,490
into it. It was a great show. The girl
from the Gilmore girls years old man,

537
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:49,400
Lauren from the Gilmore girls. She was
on a season of a news radio. Yeah, yeah,

538
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,730
yeah. I worked with it. She's
very cool. She's fun chick

539
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,440
mad men was a good show. I guess it's
coming back for their final season.

540
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:59,850
I did a couple episodes of that and like
it was kind of neat to like be in that

541
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:03,210
world and everything. But um, it was
one of those shows where like you,

542
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,660
you kind of hated a bunch of the
characters at first and then,

543
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,480
and you'd like some others.
And then like by season three,

544
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:11,730
that reverse the people you
liked and you're now hated.

545
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:15,430
And the people that liked and they kind
of went through these crazy evolutions.

546
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,960
You know, I think kind
of like any show, I mean,

547
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,520
it has its moments where you're like,
okay,

548
00:31:20,521 --> 00:31:24,270
maybe I'll skip this episode is kind of
boring me or whatever. But um, you know,

549
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:27,120
for the most part it was pretty
interesting. The, um, the

550
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:31,610
girl, the very voluptuous, redheaded girl
that's like the big deal and that show,

551
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,380
oh, Christina Hendricks, see her
all who has body fat, you know,

552
00:31:35,381 --> 00:31:39,480
but it's still sexy. She's a slut in
the show too. How dare she? Is She,

553
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,080
uh, yeah, I think she's a
little, a bit promiscuous a bit.

554
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,700
It's not slut shame. And the 50s,
Brian, she's awesome. She says she's,

555
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,050
she's a strong character though. She's a
strong woman, you know, but she, I mean,

556
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:54,400
they passed her around kind of.
Yeah.

557
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,250
It's gotta be strong carrying around all
that weight. Right? It's big burly. Yeah,

558
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,960
that's what I'm saying.
Those breasts to Kohl's.

559
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:04,670
You gotta you gotta have some fucking
backbone. You seen her naked photos? No,

560
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:08,100
but I mean for, I think for women like
to have breasts that are that large.

561
00:32:08,101 --> 00:32:11,510
It's probably really, I know it's, it's
really difficult on your back. I did,

562
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,370
a girl had a breast reduction because
their boobs are so big. She was born,

563
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:17,330
which is like with a really large breasts.

564
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,970
Her back always hurt and then she got
her breasts reduced and she was like,

565
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:24,150
it's like the world took a weight off our
shoulders. No. Think about it like that.

566
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:28,080
But if you have like double e tits,
I mean that's like,

567
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:31,680
those are fucking probably like 20 pounds
or something around a lot of God damn

568
00:32:31,681 --> 00:32:32,610
meat.
That's a lot.

569
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:37,080
I saw her in person at a table reading
to her boobs weren't as big as they

570
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,740
appear to be on TV or
in pictures and stuff.

571
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:43,280
So I think she just kind of
looked like a normal person,

572
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,820
but they just made me push them up
a bit. You know what I mean? Oh,

573
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,890
well maybe they CGI or spread around,

574
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,330
but I've seen her in like photos. She
looks a very voluptuous but sexy. Like,

575
00:32:56,331 --> 00:33:00,050
she doesn't look very sad. She doesn't
look like, listen bitch, you know,

576
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:02,700
you gotta get off that fucking
craft service table. Right.

577
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:06,530
It doesn't look like that. She looked
like a normal healthy curvy girl. Yeah.

578
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:08,240
She just looks normal in real life.

579
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,330
But you know about this tricks bodies
could probably imagine if you're here,

580
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,440
listen to this.
I love how that,

581
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,610
that she's like the number one
Photoshop to girl on the Internet.

582
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,290
There's like thousands of photos.

583
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,760
There's so many fans that are in love
with her boobs. So they overdo it. Yeah,

584
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:26,750
but you're showing a porn dummy. Huh?
There's porn there. Oh yeah. But I mean,

585
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:30,310
I'm talking about, don't know, I'm
just showing it to you. Okay. Yeah.

586
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,810
I'm just showing it to you.
But she was,

587
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:35,240
she was a part of the faculty or
the f whatever it was called. Yeah.

588
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:37,850
Were people uh,
stole when they got the,

589
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,640
the cloud photos people and
their goddamn cloud phone.

590
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:47,210
So she had a lot of naked ones. I think
she had three, if I remember her. Yeah,

591
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,580
let it shine. Girl. That shit.

592
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:54,140
The those shows about alternative
times are always odd to, you know,

593
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:55,250
those shows that they're doing,

594
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:00,260
like from the 1950s of the
1960s the period piece shows
are always very strange.

595
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,570
I think he got to have someone who's like
autistic running that show, you know,

596
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:09,980
someone who just like can consume all
the knowledge from within that time,

597
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,980
that era. So they can just like,
you know, do that cause for me,

598
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:16,430
if I were like writing on a show that
took place in the 60s I would be putting

599
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:19,250
in and then he grabbed his iPhone. It
like, I wouldn't be thinking, I'm like,

600
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:21,740
Oh God, we're in the 60s
if you just need like this,

601
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:24,650
this super nerd who just knows
everything about the 60s and that's it.

602
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,330
Well that's what we were talking about.

603
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:29,060
What that movie Fox catcher
that they fuck with timelines.

604
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:31,430
Like when you're doing
something that's historical,

605
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,150
it's very important that you stick
to the timeline because otherwise,

606
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,000
why are you even doing an
historical movie? Right?

607
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,700
Just did do a movie that's
completely fictional,

608
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:44,390
that's like influenced by
or inspired by a true story.

609
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,510
And you're trying to do an
actual real story though. Yeah.

610
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,510
That whole story was messed
up though. I mean the, the,

611
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:55,010
the true actual story of the Fox catcher
thing. I mean, beyond good grief.

612
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,200
I, and Mark Rufallo was great and
it hazing and then, um, and I,

613
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:04,010
even Steve Carell, Steve
Carell was awesome and it
seemed like the same guy. No,

614
00:35:04,011 --> 00:35:08,870
not at all. And he played
that, that role so perfect.

615
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:11,420
The role of this eccentric,
nutty,

616
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,320
like really fucked up
cokehead multimillionaire,

617
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,050
billionaire or whatever it
was that he played it so well.

618
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:21,560
Like you really believe that he was
this guy with no character that had been

619
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:24,660
handed everything to him in his life
and he just didn't understand. Yeah,

620
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,530
that was a good movie. And
Channing Tatum, I mean,

621
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:32,531
I'm not like the biggest fan of because
cause don't like him cause my wife likes

622
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:37,630
it. Mensa, she thinks he's good looking
and she wishes I had his body. But um,

623
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,850
no, he, you know, I don't know. I'm just
not like Magic Mike. I just was like,

624
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:46,680
it wasn't your favorite movie.
No, but they were naked and
dancing. I don't get it.

625
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:51,600
I don't understand you. But he was great
in Foxcatcher. He was really good. He was,

626
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:54,090
he was just walking around. It
looked like a giant ape. Yeah.

627
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:59,091
He stuck his lower jaw because that's
what like when you look at Mark Schultz in

628
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:04,680
real life, he has this very prominent,
you know, fucking ape like jaw. Oh Wow.

629
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,360
Mark Schultz was a beast.
Dude.

630
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:11,630
He was really weird the way they did
the movie because they could have easily

631
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:16,200
had him fight the guy that he
fought in the UFC in the movie.

632
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:19,920
But instead they made up some
guy made him fight a white guy.

633
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:24,420
It was really weird. He fought, he fought
Gary Goodrich. It happened in 1996.

634
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,530
It's a fucking historical fact,
but in this stupid fucking movie,

635
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,030
it was a different guy. And uh, the,

636
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,900
the UFC took place,

637
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:37,380
like when he was watching it on
television was in like 87 or 88. Yeah.

638
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,180
They fucked with everything in that movie.

639
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,700
So they fucked with his accomplishments.
Like when he went to it,

640
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,660
the Foxcatcher farms or whatever
the, the, the guy called it,

641
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,330
he was already a world
champion multiple times.

642
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,660
He was one of the best wrestlers on
earth and they made it look like he was

643
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:55,710
living in his brother's shadow. Like she
wasn't, you know, it's just not true.

644
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,740
When they did that,
just to add drama to the storyline,

645
00:36:58,741 --> 00:37:02,030
like this guy needed his brother there
in order to rise to occasionally.

646
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,490
He's the big dumb Ayp and his brother
is really intelligent and a really good

647
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:09,200
wrestler. I was brother was really good,
but he was really good too. You know,

648
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:12,930
and then they just, they always do that.
They'll do it with the Kennison movie.

649
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:17,850
They'll do what the Hicks movie get.
Trying to spin it a little bit to give,

650
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,730
you know,
for some dramatic effect or whatever.

651
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:24,450
But you can't say that it's
a true story at that point,

652
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,630
but you don't have to spin it when
the story is so fucking crazy. I mean,

653
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:29,400
Steve Carell's character,

654
00:37:29,401 --> 00:37:33,820
that Guy John Dupont was in real life to
the things he did were so fucked up and

655
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:38,010
so crazy. Yeah. I mean, he really
did shoot Mark Schultz, Mark Shields,

656
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:39,960
brother Dave in front of his family.

657
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:44,230
He fucking pulled out a gun and shot
him in a cocaine psychosis. Yeah.

658
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:48,240
And that was real. You know,
so it's, you don't have to,

659
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,380
you don't have to monkey
with that man. Right. Weird
enough. But maybe, I mean, I'm,

660
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,630
I'm not like justifying it,

661
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:57,750
but maybe when there's just millions and
millions and millions of dollars on the

662
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:59,550
line and will start overthinking it.

663
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,190
There's too many cooks
in the kitchen and Nah,

664
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,280
we gotta have him fight a
white guy. We can't, you know.
Yeah. They change it. True.

665
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:08,980
That is true. That's not to say it's
okay. It's just good grief. They,

666
00:38:08,981 --> 00:38:12,450
but it's weird to do it while the guy's
still alive and, and young. I mean,

667
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:15,060
he's not even, I don't even
think he's 50 he's, you know,

668
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:19,740
he's alive and well and they're doing a
story on his life and they're changing

669
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:23,280
everything around monkey in
reality. That's just crazy. Yeah.

670
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:25,710
It's just something that just happens.

671
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,550
There's so much money involved
in Hollywood. It's just
why when, when a show like,

672
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:33,180
like game of Thrones, when a show
like that comes off, it's almost like,

673
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,010
like how did this happen?

674
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:40,290
Like how did they make such a perfect
show in spite of all the madness that's

675
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:42,370
involved in Hollywood?

676
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:45,490
Like how did they figure out
how to do something sold good.

677
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:49,700
I don't know. I mean look at,
even recently I was reading
a thing about all these,

678
00:38:49,701 --> 00:38:54,230
like that movie Jupiter ascending,
another dog piling Channing Tatum today.

679
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,620
But um, it just became, uh,

680
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,610
it just came out and it was something
like 80 or $100 million. I Dunno if,

681
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,800
if we know the actual budget and it's
like it's opening weekend made like 10

682
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,370
million. And it's like, why are
you spending that much money?

683
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,870
Like what was it, ah, some Scifi
movie. I don't know if it was,

684
00:39:14,871 --> 00:39:18,140
what if he was based on something? It
probably was since everything is nowadays,

685
00:39:18,141 --> 00:39:22,160
but you know to,
for something to cost that much.

686
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,130
I mean that raises the
expectations so much.

687
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:28,460
But it's probably because everyone's
going, we got all this money invested,

688
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:31,460
we've got to fuck with this, we got to
do this and change that and you know,

689
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:35,660
whatever, whatever. So it's
kind of sad that then, you know,

690
00:39:35,661 --> 00:39:38,840
you get a small thing, don't, I don't
want to say game of Thrones is small,

691
00:39:38,841 --> 00:39:41,180
but it's like, you know, how is
it that that's, like you said,

692
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:43,460
it's able to be something so perfect,

693
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:48,290
be something of a high
quality. It's, it can be done,

694
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,180
but they just fuck with it too much.

695
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:55,030
Well, I think game of Thrones is
also HBO and Hbo seems to be, I mean,

696
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,090
it's just from an outside perspective,
I'm never worked for them.

697
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,330
They just seem smarter. They seem
smarter with their choices. I mean,

698
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:04,720
they put on the soprano's back when there
was nothing like that. Yeah. You know,

699
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:09,690
the, their choices have been like,
they very rarely have a dud on HBO.

700
00:40:09,691 --> 00:40:13,000
And I'm like, when was the
last dud show that HBO put out?

701
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,520
I don't know.
Yeah.

702
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:20,260
See it's like you can think of a
million shitbag sitcoms and NBC fucking

703
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,530
diarrhea it out onto America.
Right. You know, you can literally,

704
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,610
you could just sit down with a pen and
paper and write down how many CBS shows

705
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,440
made you want it to open up
a fucking vain. You know,

706
00:40:30,441 --> 00:40:33,190
like if somebody made you watch,
you know,

707
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:38,191
Mike and Molly every day for the rest
of your life or jump off a bridge like

708
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,420
you'd have to go. All right. How many,
how long has an episode? It's 30 minutes.

709
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:46,060
All right, I'll watch it. Billy
Gardell is funny though. He is funny.

710
00:40:46,061 --> 00:40:50,470
He's a great guy. Well, the girl is funny
too, but it's, it's one of those shows,

711
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:54,820
it's like they make these
mass produced white bread,

712
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,650
mayonnaise,
sandwich shows.

713
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,540
Well, and they're doing 26
episodes, so five seasons into it.

714
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:03,000
That's well over a hundred episodes
that they've done. It's like,

715
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:05,550
wha what more do we need to
see out of these characters?

716
00:41:05,551 --> 00:41:08,880
When you look at game of Thrones though,
what, what season are we about to start?

717
00:41:08,881 --> 00:41:11,870
Season four or five and they've
only done 10 episodes a season.

718
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:16,330
Right. So it's so epic though. They
have so many CGI things and the theory,

719
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,530
it's a great show from top to bottom.
It's a,

720
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,300
you must be an insanely expensive
show to make it like that.

721
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,270
The war with the fucking giants and
they're the fucking Rashad giant arrows at

722
00:41:27,271 --> 00:41:31,260
these things that are coming through
the walls and chasing people and areas.

723
00:41:31,261 --> 00:41:34,490
Shit, man. Oh Man. It's such a
God damn good show. But like,

724
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,810
it's interesting like a show like, like
a Mike and Molly, like Billy Gardell,

725
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,130
who's a very funny standup comic and a
great guy. Nobody knows who he is, right?

726
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,440
But everyone knows who that
Melissa McCarthy girl is.

727
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,810
She's on the cover of
fucking rolling stone.

728
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,800
She's in every other Sandra Bullock
movie. You know, it's, it's,

729
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,330
it's weird how that happens.

730
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:58,331
Like one character from one of those shows
will take off and the other one is a,

731
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,300
oh, that's that chick's husband.
Yeah. You know, it is weird.

732
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,260
It's Hollywood. I mean,
how do you explain it?

733
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:11,180
How do you explain it? Josh?
Mcdermitt you're in Hollywood.

734
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,890
I don't know. I don't know
man. Don't put me on the spot

735
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,210
being an INS Hollywood insider too.

736
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:21,740
Like do you get like what did you get
people that are coming up to you now

737
00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:24,290
because you're on the walking dead
and go, hey man, I got this script.

738
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,590
I mean if you could just get
it to those guys or respect.

739
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,530
Yeah, to a point. I mean I get a,

740
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:34,250
I get hit up for things a lot.
Like I, I was telling Brian,

741
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:38,930
I was doing a show tonight and I
haven't done standup in a while.

742
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,830
It's been a long time,

743
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,710
but the reason I agreed to do this
show is cause he's like, dude,

744
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:45,710
I'm not going to promote you. I'm not
going to say you're on the show. Whatever,

745
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,100
you know, I won't put you on the flyer.
I was like cool, low expectations,

746
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,590
but I'm getting hit up to
do shows with these guys.

747
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:54,050
They want to make me the headliner.
They want me to,

748
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:58,020
they want to use me to promote
their show. I get it. But like I,

749
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,290
I'm going to go up there and shit the bed,
if you put me at the headline,

750
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,740
I haven't performed in a year.
Yeah,

751
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,380
he has gone up for a year and you don't
miss it that you didn't miss it at all.

752
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,870
He said miss it. Does that scare
you? But I mean were you like,

753
00:43:11,871 --> 00:43:15,260
I mean cause comedy was your thing
before this that yeah, I mean it,

754
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:20,180
it scares me a little bit but I mean
I just was getting so burned out on it

755
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:25,420
about doing standup in La and like I would
go on the road and I would love being

756
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:29,660
on the road and you get to do a real
show and you get to work on new material

757
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:32,810
and you get to like, you know, have
fun and then you come back to la.

758
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:34,850
And I was just like
wanting to kill myself.

759
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,260
Why shows I hated doing standup in La.
I don't know what it was.

760
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,670
I would never have a good show. I could
never work on new material. I, you know,

761
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:46,440
honestly what I would do, the ice
house shows, those were like the,

762
00:43:46,441 --> 00:43:49,640
the best of the shows that I would do.
But then I'm like, you know, I live,

763
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,210
I live on one side of the town and
it's the shows on the other items.

764
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,810
Like on a Friday night, I get to drive
out there, but you know, it just,

765
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,410
and it wasn't what I wanted to be doing.
Ultimately I want to be acting.

766
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:04,160
So I just,
so when you kind of got into stand to act

767
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:09,230
or once you started acting, you realize
you liked it. But a little of both.

768
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:12,380
I think, you know, I, I loved
doing stand up, you know,

769
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:15,200
I did it for 12 years and then I was like,
you know,

770
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,320
but I do want to eventually be acting,
you know? So it wasn't like, oh,

771
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:20,840
I'm going to use this to get in the door.
It was just like,

772
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,300
I'm going to do stand up
and I also want to act.

773
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,290
But then when I started kind of
dislike, stand up, at least in La,

774
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,040
I started love acting more. What's
your, what was your, with standup in La,

775
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,820
like you said you can't do new material.
Like what do you worry about?

776
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,940
People are watching and they're
worried that you're gonna fuck up.

777
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,380
No, it was like a weird, um,
I don't know. I would like,

778
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,050
I would just do a show and
I'd run new material. I mean,

779
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,290
I don't know what your success rate is.
I mean,

780
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:52,200
you've been doing standup
for what, 26 years, 26 years.

781
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:54,960
So I don't know what your success
rate is on a new bit that you, right.

782
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,600
If you're going up and it's like,

783
00:44:57,601 --> 00:45:00,480
let's say you're going to try
out 10 new minutes, you know,

784
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:05,010
to seven minutes of it usually work or
does three minutes of it usually work off

785
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:05,844
the bat?
Like what is

786
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,140
completely varies.
I mean,

787
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:12,141
one week it can be one minute and the
next week it could be all 10 week to week.

788
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:16,530
It varies, uh, topic to
topic. It varies. It to me,

789
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:20,070
it's all about how inspired I
am by what I'm talking about.

790
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,050
And if I'm very inspired,

791
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,760
then I'll find what the energy is in
whatever the subject is and if I'm not

792
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:29,480
inspired. But I know what
you're saying about there's,

793
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:34,670
there's a sort of over it that the
Hollywood crowds have la celebrity.

794
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:40,230
Well they want to see Louis C K or
if there was fraud, they're over it.

795
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,770
They're over it. They've seen a
million of them before. They're not,

796
00:45:43,771 --> 00:45:47,070
they don't laugh as much.
I mean I've seen like at the comedy store,

797
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,690
literally a whole table full of people.
Like you know,

798
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,230
especially if you're watching the back
that are just sitting there like this

799
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:55,710
with their arms crossed, like a whole
table full, like not having fun,

800
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,380
not enthusiastic,
but you go to Pasadena,

801
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:02,160
which is only half hour away
and everybody's having a
great time to go to Irvine.

802
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:06,080
It's only 40 minutes away. Everybody's
having a great time. It's just this,

803
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:10,590
this one center, the La Center, the TMZ,

804
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:13,890
the 30 miles. Oh, it's
also like these people,

805
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:17,720
a good percentage of them want to be
in show business themselves. Yeah.

806
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,880
And people like this fucking friend who's
an actor and it's impossible to watch

807
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:27,800
movies with this fuck. Because he was
like, oh, whatever happened to that guy,

808
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:31,020
his career like Jesus Christ,
can you watch the fucking movie man?

809
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,130
What about your career shithead?
Yeah. You know, you're,

810
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,960
you don't even have a fucking career and
you're shitting on this guy who was in

811
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:40,570
Jurassic Park to stop, you
know, you can't, they're,

812
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,600
they're so self obsessed that they can't
even just enjoy a show and joy a movie.

813
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:51,180
Right. You know, it has to be
something about careers or you know,

814
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,980
the arc of their life's history.
I mean, it can't just be,

815
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:59,880
it comes a human nature thing that we
want to like pick apart other people in

816
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:00,661
their successes.

817
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:04,080
But it's like heightened when you're in
Los Angeles and you're just constantly

818
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:07,900
bombarded with people doing what you're
setting out to do and maybe, you know,

819
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,470
you're reminded of your failures
and that sort of thing. I mean,

820
00:47:10,471 --> 00:47:11,490
it could be that too.

821
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:15,240
Oh for sure. I mean they look at you and
like, she got fucking lucky on that show.

822
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:16,380
Dude.
I could have done that.

823
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,950
What do you do when you're playing a
fucking weird guy? Yeah, I could do that.

824
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,410
Yeah, Bro. If I was there, I fucking,

825
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:25,350
I guess what if I was in the fucking
audition room before you do it,

826
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:29,530
I probably would have got that. So fuck
off now you hear that. I take your order.

827
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,300
You hear that? Well you
definitely do. You, you know,

828
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:38,950
you get definitely get people that
for some reason resent you for,

829
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,650
you know,
going to the audition,

830
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,980
getting on the show and they're
watching you on television.

831
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:46,240
They've seen you in real
life and they're like, man,

832
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:50,440
that had been the perfect show for
me. Yeah. For the most part though,

833
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:53,260
the fans have been great, but
there are those guys, those,

834
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:56,920
those people just like at least centered
in Los Angeles where you're just like,

835
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,150
you know,
you're,

836
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,290
you encounter them and they are completely
negative and I could have done that,

837
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,160
you know, whatever, whatever. But you
know, when I say I didn't miss it,

838
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:08,410
it's not that, you know, it's not
like I was just sitting on my couch.

839
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:12,040
I was doing something really fun.
Right. You know, so I was like,

840
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,640
it's not like I had this thing
talking to me. I had like a,

841
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:20,020
an open invitation to go do the clubs in
Atlanta when I was living there. And um,

842
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,560
I just never was able to make it. I was
exhausted all the time. Yeah. When you,

843
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:27,640
what are the long hours like you do,
you guys are working on set? I mean I'm,

844
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,790
I'm usually up like at three 30 in the
morning and half an hour south to um,

845
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:36,700
where we shoot you because we live in
Atlanta, but we shoot an hour south.

846
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,070
I mean I could live down where we shoot,

847
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:43,000
but there's like literally nothing to
do. I would go crazy. So, you know,

848
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,700
I just do a quick little drive
back up to Atlanta. But uh,

849
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:49,120
so you're up at three 30 in the
[inaudible] 30 in the morning,

850
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:53,340
get down their father. Yeah. I'm one
of the first guys on set cause I got,

851
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,360
they got to put my mullet in,
you know,

852
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,890
literally they need time
to put the mullet man.

853
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,770
If I just grow out a mullet for real,
I fucking save a lot of,

854
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,340
I don't want to have a social life,

855
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,320
but that mullet out and
people would be like,

856
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,580
I know I throw a hat on
and then that no one knows.

857
00:49:12,581 --> 00:49:15,850
But if I walk around with that guy who
plays Abraham might cutlets and he's got

858
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:19,030
that handlebar mustache,
like he can't get away from it at all.

859
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,130
I can put a hat on. No one knows. But he,

860
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,280
he can't get away from that
mustache orange, you know.

861
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,060
Does he have to wear that mustache
all year round? Yeah. Oh yeah.

862
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,590
So right now he's grown it out like
in a beard. So when you get to, like,

863
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,270
when you get to the end of the season,

864
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:36,910
how much time do you
guys have between the,

865
00:49:36,911 --> 00:49:40,180
you're wrapped for the season and
how much downtime do you have? Well,

866
00:49:40,181 --> 00:49:44,770
we wrapped in Nov, uh, like right the
week before thanksgiving, so November.

867
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:48,130
And then, um, the show doesn't
come back until late April.

868
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,700
And so do you have like a contract
clause? Like, you can't gain weight,

869
00:49:51,701 --> 00:49:55,960
you can't shave your head. You can't,
yeah. There's some stuff. I mean I think,

870
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,190
I don't know specifically those sorts of
things I think is just how common sense.

871
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:04,300
Right? Yeah. Don't gain weight. Don't
lose weight, don't cut your hair.

872
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,870
You don't get crazy. This is a show
looking for people to kill off.

873
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:09,890
I don't want to give them a
reason like come back and um,

874
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:11,980
I looked like Chris Pratt,
I'm ripped.

875
00:50:11,981 --> 00:50:15,360
All of a sudden they're like on and that
they would probably work that in this

876
00:50:15,361 --> 00:50:19,990
storyline. Maybe you could be dancing.
I would. Magic Mike's style. Yeah,

877
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,680
I would. I mean I, I find a believable,
if someone's going to lose weight, like,

878
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:27,980
I don't know if you've watched lost, but
that Guy Hurley never lost weight gained

879
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,700
weight actually. Well it's cause he got
money and he started eating good. Yeah.

880
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,410
That's what happened. Was, is, you know,
it's like they're on a desert island.

881
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:39,620
Like your, you would lose weight
a lot. A lot fucking way. Yeah.

882
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:42,920
You're just eating pineapple all the time
or whatever. Like just lose the weight.

883
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:45,290
There's no gluten on an island,
right?

884
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,050
Every island is gluten free.

885
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:54,310
Cookies a bring your own gluten
or you get none. That guy like,

886
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:58,010
it's sad when you see a guy like that
because you know like that guy's so

887
00:50:58,011 --> 00:51:01,850
typecast and so,
so morbidly obese.

888
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,430
It's like you,
you were on a huge show,

889
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,790
last giant show and then nothing,
nothing.

890
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:13,100
Why him and the Asian guy who's
on both on that show, it's weird.

891
00:51:13,101 --> 00:51:15,660
It's like lost,
but now they're cops like recurring.

892
00:51:15,661 --> 00:51:17,600
So they probably kept him in a while like,
look,

893
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:20,370
you're in Hawaii already and you
want to work here. Yeah, exactly.

894
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,051
Because I saw him,

895
00:51:21,051 --> 00:51:24,230
he in Burbank the other day and I think
it was on a date or something like that.

896
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:28,070
And he, he's the girl is with like
literally came up to his belt.

897
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:32,180
It was just this little small girl
and he's this huge big Joey Diaz guy.

898
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,010
He's way bigger than Jody is.
Weighed like twice his size.

899
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,830
Ralphie may style more than joy. God, how
tall is he? Is he a tall guy? He's tall.

900
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:43,220
Taller than me. I was way
taller than I thought. He was.
Wonder how much he weighs?

901
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:47,300
500 pounds, whatever you think.
500 it's a big boy. 400 at least.

902
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:52,100
Joey got to like four 50 good. You know
the, when Joey was at his largest, he was,

903
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,520
you know, people get big.
It's a lot of God damn weight.

904
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,670
I used to weight 300 did
you realize holy shit.

905
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:02,270
And then I went down to two 20
I mean I dropped like 80 pounds.

906
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,330
What did you doing? Just,
you know what, it's,

907
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:10,360
it's this fad thing called eating right
and exercising people should try it.

908
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:11,420
But you know what,

909
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,530
I got a problem with eating Mexican food
and overeating and all that stuff. So,

910
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:17,000
and then just being lazy. So
then I yo Yo, I get back up to,

911
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:20,720
to 60 and then I go to two 40 and I'm
just all over the place, you know?

912
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:24,110
But my dad's a huge guy and
I got big guys in my family.

913
00:52:24,111 --> 00:52:27,980
I'm just afraid that I'm kind of in a
sense predisposed disposition to do that

914
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:32,250
unless I work my ass off. Yeah.
Jeans or a motherfucker, dude,

915
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:35,450
you see some people like you see their
kids are kids are three and they have

916
00:52:35,451 --> 00:52:39,330
these gigantic Michelin tire
arms and you're like fuck.

917
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:42,080
I mean a lot of it has to be diet,

918
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:46,310
but it's very clear that some people
can eat anything they fucking want and

919
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:47,570
never gain any weight at all.

920
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,810
Well they show these kids on Maury
Povich where like he's like trying to

921
00:52:50,811 --> 00:52:51,820
confront the parents.

922
00:52:51,821 --> 00:52:55,610
So these obese children and then they
just like have the kid in the green room

923
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:56,200
and they're just,

924
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,870
they set a camera on them and there's
this giant bowl of Cheetos and the kid's

925
00:52:59,871 --> 00:53:03,530
two years old and he weighs 80 pounds
and he's just like wolfing down Cheetos

926
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:08,150
and it's like, that's like every day
for them. That shit is so bad for you.

927
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,120
Most of the American snacks that you buy,

928
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,260
like most like Cheetos and
Doritos and all that stuff,

929
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,280
it's just if they're filled
with hydrogenated oils
and fucking fats that your

930
00:53:20,151 --> 00:53:24,710
body has a really hard time
digesting and artificial colors.

931
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:27,300
Your body's like,
what the fuck is the diarrhea?

932
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,830
Your body just has no idea what to do
with it all. But sometimes it's so good,

933
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:37,500
dude. Spicy Doritos. Oh
Dude, forget about it.

934
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,720
Especially if you're high,
you're high and you just,

935
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:43,390
you're hungry and you open the cabinet
and there, there you go. Yes. Yeah.

936
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:48,030
You don't even think you just cook. Give
it to me. I never, I never buy that stuff.

937
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:51,480
But if I see it out, like if, if
there was a bag of Doritos here,

938
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:55,920
I'd eat the whole thing. The craft service
table at the walking dead worst man.

939
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:00,240
Do you have a craft service table out in
the sun? Like how does that work? Yeah,

940
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:03,390
it's um, they just, well they
put a tent over it, but yeah,

941
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:06,300
they just have and you can order
anything you want. You can say,

942
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:09,300
give me a grilled cheese sandwich or a
case study or they'll go make it for you.

943
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,740
And so I always try to have someone
else order for me so that they order

944
00:54:13,741 --> 00:54:16,710
something healthy. Uh, otherwise
I'm ordering, you know,

945
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:20,670
chicken case ideas and then I
ordered something else. But, um,

946
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:25,440
so then of course like the actor thing
is to get like Turkey wrapped in lettuce.

947
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:29,790
That's the avocado. All
the actors eat that. Yeah,

948
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,270
that's hilarious. They try to
pretend they're eating healthy.

949
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,990
I am healthy. I'm not
like you, I'm so superior.

950
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,970
I have all these healthy fats,
Omega threes bro.

951
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,260
I graze though.

952
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:46,620
That's a problem I always had with
the fucking craft service tables.

953
00:54:46,621 --> 00:54:49,110
I would just graze and
it'd be upset at myself.

954
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:51,810
Like why did I just eat ADM and m's?
Cause that's what they,

955
00:54:51,811 --> 00:54:54,870
that's what they put out. They're there
and you're just like, you get a handful,

956
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:57,720
you're like, all right. You'd like justify
them. It's going to have a handful.

957
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:01,500
Then you're like, oh shit, I got another
hand. So you scoop out some more.

958
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,790
You know it's, I have, I have the
biggest problem with all that stuff.

959
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,050
Kevin James brought a fucking
trailer on his, uh, when he,

960
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,300
one of his movies and the
trailer, it was like, you know,

961
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:17,250
like a regular big moving trailer and it
was filled with exercise equipment. Oh,

962
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:18,084
I thought you were going to say

963
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,020
just how close it ring
dings fucking doughnut.

964
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:26,880
They do that like the rock does that
he's got a whole trailer or will Smith

965
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:29,730
might have like a big bus
full. Yeah, that's great.

966
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,280
Well I think that's
where Kevin got it from.

967
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:35,700
I think he got it from will Smith when
he did that movie with Will Smith and he

968
00:55:35,701 --> 00:55:38,190
was pretty inspired by that guy.
But um,

969
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:40,740
I think that's a common thing.

970
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:44,040
They have these trailers that they
rent and you get in them and they have

971
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:47,760
everything and they had a tanning booth
in it too. Oh my God. That's over the top.

972
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,390
You can go lie down and get
a Tan, but you can, you know,

973
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:54,330
you could get like a full workout
in right there on the set.

974
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:55,380
So like he was doing that.

975
00:55:55,381 --> 00:55:58,260
Here comes the boom movie where
he had to play a fighter. Oh yeah.

976
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:02,580
He lost a shit load of weight,
gained it way back, like double time.

977
00:56:02,581 --> 00:56:03,930
I just saw the preview for that.

978
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:08,330
For some reason they made a sequel to
Paul Black or the male mall cop sequel.

979
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:12,940
You know, holy cow, he's big.
He got big, he got a big,

980
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,520
I mean, why did he lose weight? Was it
because of, uh, gained the weight back?

981
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:22,320
Was it because of habits or is it because
maybe he thought he's not that funny

982
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:23,980
if he's skinny or like,
you

983
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,010
know what I mean? Like that's the
kind of mentality that people have,

984
00:56:27,011 --> 00:56:30,700
at least in this industry sometimes.
Like I'm a funny fat guy.

985
00:56:30,701 --> 00:56:32,200
I'm not going to be a funny skinny guy

986
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,700
when I, you know, Kevin and
I, when we were young, um,

987
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:39,180
when we first moved to
La in like the 1990s, um,

988
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:42,810
he had an agent at the time that I
talked to him in a firing. But, uh,

989
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:45,690
that's one of the things that his agent
said to him, when you're losing weight,

990
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,300
you're losing roles.
Oh,

991
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:52,020
he told them not to be healthy because
it's bad for your career. And He,

992
00:56:52,021 --> 00:56:55,520
and I was saying, do you look around,
look at all these people on TV? Yeah.

993
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:58,650
Are they all fat? Is it the only way
to be on TV? Do you have to be fat?

994
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:01,170
W what are you telling me? You're not
going to be funny if you get skinny.

995
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,820
You're funny. You're funny.
Cause your brain dude,

996
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,180
your brain's going to work better
if your skin here. It's for him.

997
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:10,980
Kevin doesn't have any real vices. Like
he doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke weed.

998
00:57:10,981 --> 00:57:14,520
He doesn't like to do drugs.
He's his thing. His food,

999
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:16,140
he fucking loves food.

1000
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:21,141
The way he talks about food is like the
way a guy who is getting out of 20 years

1001
00:57:21,331 --> 00:57:24,600
in prison talks about the first
sex he's going to have. Right.

1002
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:29,280
You know he talks about this fucking his
chicken parm sandwiches. They got this,

1003
00:57:29,281 --> 00:57:31,620
this crust they have on them.

1004
00:57:31,621 --> 00:57:35,370
It's fucking just golden brown
toes did not bar but just slightly,

1005
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,010
slightly brown and the sauce,

1006
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:42,630
the sauce and the melted
Mozzarella Cheese and oh,

1007
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,310
he'll talk about it like he just,

1008
00:57:44,311 --> 00:57:48,120
he told me about the best cheeseburger
place in Encino and there's apparently

1009
00:57:48,121 --> 00:57:51,690
this doughnut place and Encino,
Lucky's or something like that.

1010
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:56,100
And they also have cheeseburgers. I never
went there because you know the fuck,

1011
00:57:56,101 --> 00:57:58,710
it's just a cheeseburger. I'm not
traveling for a cheeseburger. I mean,

1012
00:57:58,711 --> 00:58:00,190
how good could it be?
Yeah.

1013
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:03,300
But listening to him describe
it almost got me to drive there.

1014
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,420
It was like it like porn to him.
It's like porn.

1015
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,640
It's clearly a vice.

1016
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:10,500
Well that was the problem.
John Candy had,

1017
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,250
you know it's a common problem there was,
I was talking to,

1018
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,400
there was that movie he did summer
rental and I'm like 1984 or something.

1019
00:58:19,891 --> 00:58:22,350
And he was literally at his skinniest.

1020
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:26,000
He's like ever been in any of his
movies when he was doing that movie.

1021
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:29,310
I was talking to the guy who wrote that
and it was like one of the producers and

1022
00:58:29,311 --> 00:58:32,160
he said every day they would go in,
you know,

1023
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:36,810
break into his hotel room while he's on
set and steal all the like food that he

1024
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:39,190
had taken from the settled.
Yeah.

1025
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,720
And like he had like he showed up
with suitcases full of junk food,

1026
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:45,000
like at several suitcases
and they're like,

1027
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:49,200
they had to literally take that stuff
away from him so that he wouldn't need it

1028
00:58:49,201 --> 00:58:52,800
and like Yo yo is weight while they were
shooting out of sequence or whatever

1029
00:58:52,801 --> 00:58:55,770
like and he was at a skinniest anyway,
he was still a big guy,

1030
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,040
but some people have a problem with,
I've got a problem with it man.

1031
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,320
And he's still ate himself to death.
Yeah.

1032
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,600
Well I mean John Candy died pretty young.

1033
00:59:03,601 --> 00:59:05,000
I mean I don't even think
he was 50 wasn't it?

1034
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:07,690
He was like 44 or something like that.

1035
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:11,940
All from fat and I'll just eating
himself to death. He was so funny though.

1036
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,600
Goddamn. That was funny. Planes,
trains and automobiles like God,

1037
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,040
he was hilarious.

1038
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:20,000
My buddies and I will do a John Candy
movie night every once in a while.

1039
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,470
Just watch the John Candy movie.

1040
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,820
Great outdoors. Yeah. I mean everything
in home alone, the poker, the poker.

1041
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,730
It's so good, man. Uncle Buck is great.
They're doing an uncle buck show now.

1042
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:35,210
They did an uncle buck show way back
in the day. Yeah. With somebody else.

1043
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:38,330
That's weird. Well, maybe they
feel like enough times pass now.

1044
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:43,780
I think it was Jim Belushi or something
like that. Oh really? Yeah. Oh,

1045
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:46,030
I don't know that. That would have
worked. Well, obviously it didn't know.

1046
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:51,050
Hold on a second. Uncle Buck TV
show. Oh, it was Kevin Meeney.

1047
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:54,350
Oh, poor Kevin Christ. Yeah,

1048
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:59,380
that was 1989 I'll all African
American uncle buck show coming soon.

1049
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:04,310
No, African American. They're doing
a I Annie. That's the new thing.

1050
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:08,960
Christ. That's hilarious.
That's weird. That's hilarious.
How they do that. Not that,

1051
01:00:08,961 --> 01:00:13,460
I mean, not that it needs to be a
white show, but it's like it just,

1052
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:16,340
it's so calculated. Just make
another show, make a show,

1053
01:00:16,341 --> 01:00:18,080
and if I hire the best actors,

1054
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:21,620
meanwhile salon.com will
praise it for its diversity.

1055
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:26,020
It's amazing what they've done better
than the original because everyone's in

1056
01:00:26,021 --> 01:00:30,680
minority. Yeah. That show blackish
is pretty funny. That's a funny show.

1057
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:34,360
But that show would be funny. I mean,
it's original. It's a for, you know,

1058
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:37,100
it's a first run. They've no one's
ever done it before their show.

1059
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:41,450
They created all the characters. Ian
Edwards writes on it, you know? Yeah.

1060
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:44,780
Lawrence Lawrence Fish Burns on
his films right next to my house.

1061
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:49,760
They've good fucking show, but it's like
they've got good writers. It's well done.

1062
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:50,031
I mean,

1063
01:00:50,031 --> 01:00:53,690
it would be well done if they were
Chinese people be well done if they were

1064
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,760
Polish right.
It's just a good show.

1065
01:00:56,030 --> 01:01:01,030
I can't wait until racism stops and dies
down to the point where it's no longer

1066
01:01:02,151 --> 01:01:07,151
addressed because it's so fucking annoying
watching shows that are so clearly in

1067
01:01:07,521 --> 01:01:10,790
response to like the the Brownie
points you're going to get,

1068
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:14,510
the Social Brownie points you're going
to get for showing diversity. It's not,

1069
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:19,511
the diversity was like it was
important because it needs to be done.

1070
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:24,650
It's almost like it's done just
to kind of like score, you know?

1071
01:01:24,651 --> 01:01:27,440
It's done to like, look
what he'd done. Look,

1072
01:01:27,441 --> 01:01:31,970
we've got to be a woman and she's
Asian and she runs the show. Well,

1073
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:34,460
there's a black woman
president. Our show. Yeah,

1074
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,310
the woman President United States is
black and it's a woman on our show.

1075
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:40,790
It's like, I see what you're doing. Okay,
you're doing like card tricks. Okay,

1076
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:44,060
let's stop calling attention to
it. Getting those good point. Yeah,

1077
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,600
just make it good.
It's Duh Duh.

1078
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:52,850
Like racism is bad. Duh. I can't wait
until it's done. You know, like, I mean,

1079
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,270
who the fuck do you know that's
racist in this day and age?

1080
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:59,360
If I was hanging out with some,
Anthony Kumi might be a little race,

1081
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:02,750
a little bit,
a little bit,

1082
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:07,220
but the old school comics he's experienced
that guys experienced a lot of shit.

1083
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:12,380
Being a white guy living in New York
and looking like him, things get rough.

1084
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:13,700
But I think that,

1085
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:19,010
and hopefully in our lifetime it'll
get to a point where people will,

1086
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:22,640
other reasons to separate,
you know, the, the,

1087
01:02:22,641 --> 01:02:27,480
the idea of like right now you've
got people that separate because of

1088
01:02:27,481 --> 01:02:29,220
conservative and liberal.

1089
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:32,370
You've got people that separate
because of religious and atheist.

1090
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:33,480
So you've got people that celebrate,

1091
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:38,810
set up separate rather because
of a Vegan and meat eater.

1092
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:39,181
You know,

1093
01:02:39,181 --> 01:02:43,740
you've got all these little factions and
groups that separate from each other.

1094
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:48,000
You know, Seattle fans versus
patriots. I mean, this is essentially,

1095
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,890
we like to be in these weird little groups
and the group of white people, just,

1096
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,490
just white people that don't
like minorities. Like God damn,

1097
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:58,050
that's a fucking stupid group.

1098
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,050
Like in a group of black people
that don't like white people.

1099
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:05,160
Like that's a fucking dumb
group too. Yeah. He's, this
groups are dumb. Like the,

1100
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:10,161
the idea of you're just one aspect of
your appearance or one aspect of your,

1101
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:12,330
uh,
your ethnic origin.

1102
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:17,520
It's one of the dumbest fucking things
to like associate with and it's,

1103
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,940
it's tiresome. And the
response to it, the, the,

1104
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,670
the opposite response to it
is almost just as tiresome.

1105
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,710
It's almost like just we need to get to
a point where it's not an issue anymore.

1106
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:33,840
So that these, like the making a black
uncle buck is going to, you know,

1107
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:37,590
people gotta go, why would you do that?
Why don't you just make uncle frank,

1108
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:41,220
you know, make a new fucking show.
Right. You know, you'd have to,

1109
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:43,860
it doesn't have to be uncle buck.
It's not John Candy.

1110
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:47,630
It's not even Kevin Meeney stop stopped.

1111
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:53,190
Kevin Meeney gets, gets inserted
into this argument against his will.

1112
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:57,900
When only that laid me out of him.
Find me a black guy named buck. Right.

1113
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:03,660
Are there black guys named buck? Okay,
let's, let's Google black guys named buck.

1114
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:09,270
I'm never even met a white guy. I mean
all the bucks have been like buck Rogers,

1115
01:04:09,271 --> 01:04:12,390
uncle buck like from the fucking fifties.

1116
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:16,620
I when I worked at the radio station in
Phoenix, uh, it was owned by Buck Owens,

1117
01:04:16,621 --> 01:04:21,000
the legendary country, sir.
Wow. Images for black guys
named buck. It's quite a few.

1118
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:29,700
There's some fucking ridiculous
images of black gentleman named buck.

1119
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:33,720
Now it's a lot of white people. The Jack
Johnsons in there. His name's not buck.

1120
01:04:33,721 --> 01:04:37,410
Fuck you. This is ridiculous.
Fits as a Google image search.

1121
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:41,880
Black guys name Buck, and then pictures
of Christina Hendricks. Boobs come up.

1122
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:47,700
And then buck angel. Do you know buck?
So Buck Angel Angel was on the podcast.

1123
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,690
Used to be a woman is now man.
Oh Wow. Transgender porn star.

1124
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:56,430
All yoked and shit. Pretty
rare. Really good guy too. Yeah.

1125
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:01,200
Fun Guy to hang out with.
Talk to named buck black white as fuck.

1126
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:04,030
But I Google black guys named buck.
Nope.

1127
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:09,450
There's so few black guys named buck do.
You don't even get past the first page.

1128
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:14,220
The first you get one row of black
people before you get white folks. Right.

1129
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:18,760
And couple of them look at those photos.
Yeah.

1130
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,120
They might not even be really named
buck. Just be black people. Yeah.

1131
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:25,510
Those are just buckeyes.
Those Ohio state. It's true.

1132
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:27,280
So Ohio state,

1133
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:31,420
just two of them were Ohio state and
two of them are like pictures from back

1134
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:35,340
when they, you know, one of
them said one of them is a,

1135
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:38,110
is a whole website on blackface.

1136
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:39,810
Yeah.

1137
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:44,140
Well the history of blackface, that's
where the image comes from, which has got,

1138
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:48,700
okay, so the, okay, so that
guy buck was not even, oh,

1139
01:05:48,701 --> 01:05:49,534
he was a black man.

1140
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,473
All right.

1141
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,150
Black is a weird thing.
Like you can't do black face today.

1142
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:59,710
Like someone was playing
a character like a, at a,

1143
01:05:59,711 --> 01:06:03,820
a party, like a Halloween party
and they put blackface on and um,

1144
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:06,700
they got fired from their job because you,

1145
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:09,250
you can't pretend to be a black person.

1146
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:14,200
Like you cannot have black person
makeup on if you are a white person.

1147
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,020
I successfully did it cause
I was at black wizard though.

1148
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,770
Now you didn't successfully do it dude.
Nobody knew about it.

1149
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:25,290
Nobody knew about it. When you can't get
fired from your job, you work for me. No,

1150
01:06:25,291 --> 01:06:27,010
I mean I mean I went to
parties and never went.

1151
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,630
No one ever said anything because I was
playing almost like a superhero kind of

1152
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,530
character,
you know.

1153
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:37,060
But it was a black face and heart is
did you go to though the southpark party

1154
01:06:37,061 --> 01:06:39,230
and then I went to a couple bars,
Gilmore more girls.

1155
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:42,700
Let's see here what I'm saying,
like you're not working for a company.

1156
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:45,640
What I'm saying is that
there was a company and they
had a party and they had a

1157
01:06:45,641 --> 01:06:49,480
Halloween party and this guy showed up
in blackface and they fired him and it

1158
01:06:49,481 --> 01:06:53,350
was this issue like like, come on man,
he's, he's playing like Mr t, you know,

1159
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:57,790
we had like gold chains on and everything
and he put black skin colored makeup

1160
01:06:57,791 --> 01:07:02,320
on. You cannot, you literally cannot do
that. You can pretend to be from avatar.

1161
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:05,110
You can pretend to be a lot of things,

1162
01:07:05,111 --> 01:07:07,090
which you can't pretend
to be as a black person.

1163
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:11,410
You cannot darken your skin
color. Yeah, that's a weird,

1164
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,100
that's a weird fucking rule. And Oh,
you and be your, when you say this,

1165
01:07:15,101 --> 01:07:17,740
and I've said this before on the podcast
and people will fucking freak out,

1166
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:21,290
and the ultra sensitive search,
social justice warrior types,

1167
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:24,010
we'll start tweeting. You do not
understand that. You sit ignorant.

1168
01:07:24,011 --> 01:07:26,380
You don't understand the context of
where black blackface gained from,

1169
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:30,400
how offensive it is to people of color.
Fuck off.

1170
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:34,360
Fuck off with your fake sensitivity.
I know what you're doing.

1171
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:39,070
You brownie points search and
for assholes it's just skin.

1172
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:42,340
It's just the color of skin.
It's preposterous.

1173
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:47,200
The idea that you can't
play Denzel Washington, you
can't like, you can't do it.

1174
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:50,560
You can't ever do it. You'd be, you have
to be the white Denzel Washington does.

1175
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:53,410
Like what if I want to play Denzel
Washington for Halloween? I can't do it.

1176
01:07:53,411 --> 01:07:57,490
I'm a huge Denzel Washington Fan. I
loved all his motor girl could, no,

1177
01:07:57,491 --> 01:08:01,520
they can't get away with,
if they're doing black face with a,

1178
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,090
as a guy as Denzel Washington, I
doubt it. There was no certainty.

1179
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:08,530
Who's that actress that just got
in trouble this year for Halloween?

1180
01:08:08,531 --> 01:08:13,360
She did black face. Uh,
Julian is the new black.

1181
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,160
Yeah. Oh yeah. She, she learns. So someone

1182
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,350
from orange is the new black,
but she didn't,

1183
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:21,090
did she get in trouble or was
that she was on TMZ about it.

1184
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:23,180
It was all over the place about it.

1185
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:25,430
Have you been following the
gender thing at all, Joe?

1186
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:29,900
Of course. I have this, I'm white
teens in blackface. Yeah, there's a,

1187
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:34,180
there's a bunch of these Missouri
high school girls wear blackface.

1188
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,080
Outrage.

1189
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:41,440
Outrage as a white high school seniors
in Missouri show up for girls powder puff

1190
01:08:41,661 --> 01:08:44,780
football game in blackface.
Look at this.

1191
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:49,880
Don't Cook People in
Missouri that think they can.

1192
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:54,230
They just think they can fucking
do anything like, well shit,

1193
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:58,010
we're in Missouri.
We don't have to follow your liberal rule

1194
01:08:58,110 --> 01:09:02,160
anywhere near Ferguson. I mean they do.
They not watch the news too. They're not.

1195
01:09:02,161 --> 01:09:04,080
No.
They're not interested.

1196
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:06,690
The racial tensions that are taking
place within their state. Yeah.

1197
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:10,360
They're like, I'm staying in this
town. I ain't moving from this town.

1198
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:11,830
This is where where I live.

1199
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,580
They're all wearing blackface and they
have teachers around them that are all

1200
01:09:15,581 --> 01:09:16,414
smiling.

1201
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,890
The images of white girls with their
faces painted black was posted on social

1202
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:23,260
penia sparking outrage.

1203
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,990
This is like some
serious blackface though.

1204
01:09:25,991 --> 01:09:29,950
They didn't even bother doing the
neck. No, they're just black face.

1205
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:33,640
They're not pretending. It's not
called black men, not black wrist.

1206
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:37,230
And that was a conversation they
had her arms. Everything is white.

1207
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:39,050
Everything is white,
black or this.

1208
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:41,950
Some of them have like a black
long sleeve shirt on. Yeah.

1209
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:45,910
But they don't have gloves. That
chick planned ahead. Two of them did.

1210
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:50,440
It's fucking, I dunno man. I mean,
look, racism is absolutely disgusting,

1211
01:09:50,441 --> 01:09:55,441
but you give a lot of people a
lot of power when you allow them.

1212
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,320
You know, when you get so upset,
the principal said nothing racial.

1213
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:02,590
This is hilarious. Oh my God.
From the fucking principle.

1214
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:07,360
Nothing racial about the powder puff
team wearing blackface. Oh really?

1215
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:12,550
I was nothing racial. They're pretending
to be a different race than they are.

1216
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:15,460
That's very racial.
That's inherently racial.

1217
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,360
There's no way getting around racial.
But here's the thing,

1218
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:22,210
it's not bad to be black.
Okay,

1219
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:27,040
so why would taking makeup and
turning your skin black be bad?

1220
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:31,900
I could get, this is a racist context to
it, but it when, when is that dissolve?

1221
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:35,680
I mean, at one point in time, do we
culturally just step back and say like,

1222
01:10:35,681 --> 01:10:37,990
this is ridiculous.
Somebody wants to be fucking Mr t.

1223
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:40,540
If you're black and you're hanging around
with a bunch of white people in there

1224
01:10:40,541 --> 01:10:42,160
were legitimately your
friends and you love them,

1225
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:45,700
and one of them decides to be mister t
for Halloween and shows up with a bunch

1226
01:10:45,701 --> 01:10:48,510
of gold chains. He's got a Mohawk on
and he's got black face on. Right?

1227
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,760
Are you going to beat him up and get to
beat your friend out for being racially

1228
01:10:51,761 --> 01:10:55,090
insensitive? I mean, are we really
living in that fucking retarded?

1229
01:10:55,091 --> 01:10:59,980
A world where that's such a huge issue.
It just seems racism is disgusting.

1230
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:01,330
Racism is evil,

1231
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:06,540
but someone playing another race
by putting makeup on their skin.

1232
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:08,440
The only way that would
be negative at all,

1233
01:11:08,441 --> 01:11:11,830
the only way is if there was
something wrong with being that race.

1234
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:14,340
There's clearly nothing
with being a black person.

1235
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:17,710
So someone who is white putting black
makeup on, it's not like they're,

1236
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:22,050
it's not like they're doing al Jolson
and they're putting white around their

1237
01:11:22,051 --> 01:11:25,130
lips and black in there.
Man, they're there.

1238
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:30,200
They're doing some sort of a fucking
horrible racial racist or mass.

1239
01:11:31,401 --> 01:11:36,390
Uh, yeah, exactly. Obviously you
exactly this, this person who got fired,

1240
01:11:36,391 --> 01:11:40,080
he was playing a famous black person,

1241
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:43,890
but it's out of bounds. Like you
cannot do it. You can't do it.

1242
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,100
There's a witch hunt going
on in this country. You know,

1243
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:51,300
just like the moment someone mentions
any sort of race, you're racist.

1244
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:56,190
It's such a great way to diffuse
someone and take all the onus off them,

1245
01:11:56,370 --> 01:12:01,370
take all of the possible scrutiny or
criticism that might come their way and

1246
01:12:02,161 --> 01:12:05,490
point it all at you. It's also a
great way to diffuse your argument.

1247
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:07,790
Just call you a racist. You know, like if,

1248
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:12,300
if you have a different opinion
about Ferguson or about, you know,

1249
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:15,960
economics or Al Sharpton or any,

1250
01:12:15,961 --> 01:12:20,160
anything that involves a
black person instantaneously,

1251
01:12:20,161 --> 01:12:23,640
your arguments diffused. If they call
you racist. Yeah. Well, Josh Mcdermitt,

1252
01:12:23,641 --> 01:12:28,500
you're a racist. You're from Phoenix,
Arizona, one of the most racist states.

1253
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:33,780
Come on, man, you're a racist, fake. Why
don't you just own up to your racism, man?

1254
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,910
Yeah.
There's no way around that.

1255
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:38,850
You can sit there and argue it and they
just keep throwing that back at you and

1256
01:12:38,851 --> 01:12:39,630
you get,

1257
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:43,860
you could get hashtag black lives
matter tattooed on your forearm.

1258
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,970
People sign till they
would still go after it.

1259
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:53,520
There was still it's cause it's,
it's a way that people,

1260
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:57,720
instead of it being a rational thing.
Who was that Ted Danson. Oh that's right.

1261
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:02,290
Black face when he was dating
Whoopi Goldberg did it on TV. Yes.

1262
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:06,210
Well he had a pass. He thought because he
was dating wipie he's like, look at her,

1263
01:13:06,211 --> 01:13:09,000
I'm fucking her. I should be able
to do something about this. Ah,

1264
01:13:09,001 --> 01:13:12,030
I forgot about that.
That kind of started it all.

1265
01:13:12,031 --> 01:13:16,380
I feel like that's starting to
dance. It's fault. Well the,

1266
01:13:16,381 --> 01:13:17,940
I mean it was offensive
at one point in time,

1267
01:13:17,941 --> 01:13:22,380
especially because at one point in time
that was the only way you saw black

1268
01:13:22,381 --> 01:13:24,000
people represented on TV.

1269
01:13:24,001 --> 01:13:27,360
It was a white person playing a
black person or in movies was,

1270
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:32,300
or they were slaves, you know. I mean
you had like go back like other races,

1271
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:36,480
like go back and watch John Wayne played
Gingiss con you told me that's not

1272
01:13:36,481 --> 01:13:37,320
fucking offensive.

1273
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:42,680
He's playing a Mongol and he's clearly
this fucking corn fed white guy from

1274
01:13:42,721 --> 01:13:47,721
America and he's playing like one of
the most important historical conquerors

1275
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:53,280
ever. Right. And he's playing them out of
the race. He doesn't even have makeup on.

1276
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,260
I mean,
he's not even fucking pretending.

1277
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:59,160
At least the guy who played
Jackie or um, uh, Charlie Chan,

1278
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:03,240
like they did something to them to
make them look more Chinese, you know?

1279
01:14:03,241 --> 01:14:07,450
But John Wayne, they just said fuck it.
It's John Wayne was, he's gang guys.

1280
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:11,870
Can that to a, yeah, I mean

1281
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,680
if you ever watched it. No I haven't. Oh,
it's Gloria. I think I've seen pictures,

1282
01:14:15,681 --> 01:14:19,580
but yeah, I haven't seen it is
glorious and it's stupidity.

1283
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,190
It's so fucking bad.
It's so bad.

1284
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:25,670
And you realize like it was one of
those Elvis movies where they would just

1285
01:14:25,671 --> 01:14:26,930
fucking slapped together.

1286
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:30,050
There was a point in time where
they would slap together a movie,

1287
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:31,940
have Elvis in it and just,
you know,

1288
01:14:31,941 --> 01:14:34,730
Elvis is a football star and
we've got a wooden the scream,

1289
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,310
we've got to look in this case.
And Elvis was started dancing.

1290
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,320
They would do that with John Wayne.
I mean they would,

1291
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:42,710
they would let John Wayne play Gingiss
Khan and one of the shittiest fucking

1292
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:46,010
movies of all time. Or they just
didn't, they didn't do any makeup.

1293
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,890
They didn't like darkness
scan once. Yeah, Jamie,

1294
01:14:48,891 --> 01:14:52,270
pull it up and put it on the screen. So
only we see it. So the, the folks in,

1295
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:54,440
so we don't get pulled from youtube.

1296
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:59,570
If you have a videos that people have
copyright on them and you play them and

1297
01:14:59,571 --> 01:15:02,660
then you upload it even from a
podcast where you're talking about it,

1298
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:07,160
he played on Youtube, they
pull, it sucks. Yeah. But we'll,

1299
01:15:07,161 --> 01:15:09,140
we'll put it up on here.
Just, just for the, he,

1300
01:15:09,141 --> 01:15:12,410
he's in the hos because you got
to see how fucking bad it is.

1301
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,050
LG USA low though. That's
crazy. It takes me back.

1302
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:24,950
That's the USA logo.
And remember that same movie.

1303
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:28,250
Oh Wow.
That's graphic.

1304
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:42,300
Yeah. He just had the chew
man Fu Mustache. That's the
only Fu Manchu and Manchu.

1305
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:48,170
Yeah.
Madison is a stupid

1306
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:54,340
and he's banging white chicks.
Super White. Look how hot Cheetos,

1307
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:58,580
God damn women that were hot back then
too. There were hot in a different way,

1308
01:15:58,581 --> 01:16:01,880
man. They were, they were hot
in this like supernatural.

1309
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:06,860
Like when you say hourglass really was
like an hourglass cause they had about an

1310
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:11,750
hour until they turn into old ladies.
They didn't last.

1311
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:16,520
Like I was out of fucking of
restaurant the other day. Um, and uh,

1312
01:16:16,521 --> 01:16:19,950
I saw Cindy Crawford and I don't
know how old Cindy Crawford is. Well,

1313
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:24,640
I want to Google right now. I'm going
to guess 50. Make us 40. No, she,

1314
01:16:24,641 --> 01:16:29,600
she's at least 50. Um, she is hot as fuck.

1315
01:16:29,601 --> 01:16:32,940
She's 48. Dude. She's hot as fuck. Yeah.

1316
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:35,600
Like she's hot like 25 year old hot.
Right.

1317
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:39,320
Because that bitch is probably
running stairs every day, doing yoga,

1318
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:44,480
getting her face. Sandblasted getting
stem cells from aborted fetuses,

1319
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,590
sprayed all over cheekbones. I
mean, I don't know what she's doing.

1320
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:49,551
Whatever she's doing,

1321
01:16:49,551 --> 01:16:53,780
she needs to write a book because
at 48 she's fucking stunning.

1322
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:56,750
She's stunning. She's a year older
than me and I look like, shit,

1323
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:02,130
let's go. Come on. You look good. I mean,

1324
01:17:02,131 --> 01:17:04,900
I don't look totally Shitty,
but oh,

1325
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:07,600
I just don't look as good as I looked
last year. That's all I'm saying.

1326
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:09,860
That's fishing for compliments.
That was the whole point.

1327
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:12,970
I'm going to make them a story about
seeing her at the restaurants and they're

1328
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:17,570
telling me, I look at it by her
body's in check or faces in check,

1329
01:17:17,571 --> 01:17:21,410
like there's nothing sadder than you.
You run into, I won't say the name,

1330
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:26,620
but I ran into this woman who was a
major movie star in the 90s now she is

1331
01:17:27,201 --> 01:17:31,520
enormous. I mean, she's probably 50
60 pounds overweight or face licked,

1332
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:35,000
all fucked up. And she looked
like she smoked cigarettes
and just, and I was like,

1333
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:39,620
no, that's not. No, because
before she was just dawning,

1334
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:43,490
you would see here and just go,
good Lord. And now it's just, yeah,

1335
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:48,280
same thing just happened to me with the
girlfriend, Wayne's world. Oh, really?

1336
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:49,250
See them.
They're all white.

1337
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:53,240
They want to know who it is that
you're talking about. Did big,

1338
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:56,700
wide wasted lazy fucking,
who is it? Just say here,

1339
01:17:56,710 --> 01:18:01,340
this shitty food down or radio. It is. I
can't think she lives in my neighborhood.

1340
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:05,240
You still talked to Betty White?
Betty White, you know Betty White?

1341
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:07,700
He used to be on a show with her.
No, I wasn't. I was on a net.

1342
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,070
I was on the same network,
but we would do parties.

1343
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:14,140
What's the show that used to do
the retired at 35. It was, um,

1344
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:18,020
I thought she was on that show. What does
retired at 35. It was a Sitcom I was on.

1345
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:22,070
Um, we went two seasons with
George Segal who was on that show.

1346
01:18:22,071 --> 01:18:24,260
Just shoot me and then I can't
think of the woman's name.

1347
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:29,090
Jessica Walter who was from Archer and uh,
uh,

1348
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,990
arrested development. She plays a mom
and all that. She was red, but Betty,

1349
01:18:32,991 --> 01:18:36,500
I don't know Betty. Yeah, I
just saw the Betty White nudes.

1350
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:40,220
Somebody sent me the other day and her
naked when she was younger. Beautiful.

1351
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:44,870
She's beautiful by white. Had nudes.
She has a lot of them and there's like,

1352
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:48,980
it's like really whoa, those are
real. Yeah. Yeah. She's really,

1353
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,940
she's just a beautiful person. The
casting couch was a real thing back then.

1354
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,110
It really was, but still real, right?
Yeah, it's still is. It must be.

1355
01:18:57,290 --> 01:19:02,290
I mean I'm probably not
for like big budget movies
probably so probably for like

1356
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:06,170
everything man. Stuff like the conqueror.
It's kind of implied though, right?

1357
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:09,860
Isn't that the thing about the casting
couch? Just not as simple as like,

1358
01:19:09,861 --> 01:19:13,490
hey look, get on that couch and
chuck, Mr [inaudible]. Right.

1359
01:19:13,491 --> 01:19:18,120
I think it's put you in x men
five. No it doesn't. You know,

1360
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,420
is he gay? I don't know. I mean I think
he just likes parties with naked boys,

1361
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:26,940
young boys in oak tub filled
with blood. Did you see the, the,

1362
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:29,730
the pool is like red lights
in the pool and he's like,

1363
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:34,360
I'm like running around banging
each other. I'm like, God,

1364
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:41,240
I say why not? And we're still
asking if he's gay. Oh he's gay.

1365
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:45,230
He's gay as fuck. He's gay as fuck. Cause
I taught there was, I dunno, there was,

1366
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:47,150
I mean this is how stupid
and out of the loop I am.

1367
01:19:47,151 --> 01:19:49,160
But I thought there was
something that like,

1368
01:19:49,161 --> 01:19:53,150
I just assumed he was based on these
allegations and all of the things he went

1369
01:19:53,151 --> 01:19:57,660
through. And then there was something
where it's like, oh a god. Ah,

1370
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:02,650
why not all blow up bud, but whole blood.
That's what I'm saying. It's crazy.

1371
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:06,830
Red Lights, red lights. Well they
probably put fucking die in there too.

1372
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,130
You know,
they'd probably

1373
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:12,150
put dye in the pool. Let's look a fun
time guys having a good fucking time, man.

1374
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:16,140
He's, I see a couple of gals
there too. A couple of not enough.

1375
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:17,510
Wow.

1376
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:20,660
A couple of gals who want to be able to
have fun and not have people try to put

1377
01:20:20,661 --> 01:20:24,060
this guy in the foreground with his
hair. Like what? That's a bad haircut.

1378
01:20:24,830 --> 01:20:29,700
Shave your head homie. Just let it
go. So over, trust me when it's over,

1379
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:34,420
it's over. But you know, like
these guys that he, you know,

1380
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:37,710
he banged that he, that he brought to
these parties, they would get upset.

1381
01:20:37,711 --> 01:20:39,600
But I think the thing was
that there were underage,

1382
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:44,430
there were like younger than 18 that was
like the, the real issue. But you know,

1383
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,680
that's one thing about underage sex.

1384
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:52,010
People give zero fucks if
you're an under aged gay boy,

1385
01:20:52,730 --> 01:20:56,700
I feel like a 17 year old gay guy
likes to blow Hollywood dudes. Right?

1386
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:01,710
But if you were like a girl
and some Mel Gibson type guy,

1387
01:21:01,711 --> 01:21:06,711
some big Hollywood celebrity guy had
parties and add a pool filled with 16 year

1388
01:21:06,811 --> 01:21:10,110
old girls and he was banging. I
mean that would be the end. Yeah,

1389
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:12,860
that'd be the end. Absolutely.
But if it's boys, I'm like, Damn.

1390
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:17,720
They wanted one of their owners.
They have boners at 17 they all gained,

1391
01:21:17,721 --> 01:21:20,490
they're all gay, right? There's no, no
one, no one got roofied. Okay. Yeah.

1392
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:24,210
Were before we're done here, get out of
here. Get out of here. He had texted me,

1393
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:28,110
I was 18 did you have sex with you when
you were 19 and then 20 and 21 yeah.

1394
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,420
Okay. We're good. It's the same
thing. Same thing happened.

1395
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:34,170
You didn't know what was going on. Was
it the first time you'd ever had sex? No.

1396
01:21:34,171 --> 01:21:37,380
Did He, did he give you some
drugs? Did He roofie you?

1397
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:41,310
Did he do something to you that's just
so want to have sex with mister singer?

1398
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:45,480
Obvious when someone's trying to get
a pay day, you know that, I mean,

1399
01:21:45,481 --> 01:21:47,010
I don't know the details of this case,

1400
01:21:47,011 --> 01:21:50,610
but it's like this guy like sat on this
for like 15 years or something like that,

1401
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:54,810
didn't he? Yeah. It's just like, come
on. Well, yeah. Well they definitely,

1402
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,860
I mean they feel like they're entitled,
you know, it's like they, they could sue,

1403
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:03,030
they might be able to get money, so go
for it. I don't have any money. I'm broke.

1404
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:04,103
Hey,

1405
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:08,220
I fucked Bryan singer and all of his
friends in a pool six years ago when I was

1406
01:22:08,221 --> 01:22:11,130
only 17 and you go to
a lawyer and he's like,

1407
01:22:11,131 --> 01:22:14,790
do you have any photographs from Mr
Sanger and you in this pool and said pool

1408
01:22:14,791 --> 01:22:17,010
with no clothes on. As
a matter of fact, I do.

1409
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:20,880
You pull those photos out and then
they say, listen, let's go to this guy.

1410
01:22:20,881 --> 01:22:23,100
And it's essentially,
it's a money grab.

1411
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:26,100
You're trying to get money and
like you'd say, listen, Mr Sanger,

1412
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:29,500
it's going to cost you about $5
million to fight off this lawsuit.

1413
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:34,820
We are bringing in the big guns here at
Sherman and Lefkowitz and associates.

1414
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:39,510
You know, we have a long history
of extorting money from large,

1415
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:43,610
rich celebrities like yourself.
So let's just, uh, let's,

1416
01:22:43,611 --> 01:22:46,950
let's call it 3 million and let's
wrap this pitch up tight right now.

1417
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,940
And they make these negotiations and they
fucking give him some money to fill it

1418
01:22:50,941 --> 01:22:51,840
out and there you go.

1419
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:55,830
They signed some sort of a disclosure and
it encourages people to continue to do

1420
01:22:55,831 --> 01:23:00,300
that. Well, the UFC is in the
middle of thinks three or four,

1421
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,200
um, class action lawsuits
now. So some of them,

1422
01:23:04,201 --> 01:23:06,730
which I just don't understand
what they're doing.

1423
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:11,410
I like guys that had no chance of
ever winning a belt ever. They were,

1424
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:16,270
they were not that good. They were,
you know, marginal fighters at best.

1425
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:19,030
And I don't know what they're suing over.
I don't understand it.

1426
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:22,110
They as soon over. I think the
idea is that somehow or another,

1427
01:23:22,111 --> 01:23:26,430
the UFC stifled competition,
but according to the people that I know,

1428
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,090
obviously I'm only hearing one side of it,

1429
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:31,600
but that it's going to cost
them $25 million to fight it.

1430
01:23:31,870 --> 01:23:36,870
And they get approached by these lawyers
and a while they're going through the,

1431
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:41,650
you know, the whole legal
issue of what, you know,

1432
01:23:41,651 --> 01:23:46,020
what could be considered
a anti competition,

1433
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:47,050
what couldn't be they,

1434
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:51,850
they start accumulating legal bills and
then once the bills start getting high,

1435
01:23:51,851 --> 01:23:54,850
then they, they pulled them together,
they have a meeting and I say, look,

1436
01:23:54,851 --> 01:23:58,330
here's the deal. You know, we'll settle
for 10 million and we'll settle for,

1437
01:23:58,331 --> 01:24:01,090
you know, 9 million. What do you
want to know? What do you want to do?

1438
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,210
And then they make a few million and
then they fucking high five each other.

1439
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:07,300
They go get some hookers that
they drink some wine and they go,

1440
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:11,110
we got another one. I mean, there's
some legit class action lawsuits. Most,

1441
01:24:11,111 --> 01:24:15,140
certainly when a products fail and
people die, um, like there's a,

1442
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:20,310
there was one recently with Chevrolet
where it turned out that they hid the fact

1443
01:24:20,441 --> 01:24:24,280
that their ignition switches we're
fucking up and a bunch of people that died

1444
01:24:24,281 --> 01:24:25,114
because of this.

1445
01:24:25,530 --> 01:24:29,290
And so there's like some legit class
action lawsuits when it comes to certain

1446
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:34,270
companies. But uh, when you see Bryan
singer type thing and like, okay,

1447
01:24:34,271 --> 01:24:37,060
wait a minute, you're gay, right?
You're good. He's gay. Okay.

1448
01:24:37,061 --> 01:24:39,880
You showed up at his house and there
was a bunch of gay dudes and you're all

1449
01:24:39,881 --> 01:24:44,800
doing gay stuff. Okay. And you want
some money? Like you look, you get dick,

1450
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,840
that's what you get.
He went to the party.

1451
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:48,760
You wanted to get some Dick got some Dick.

1452
01:24:48,761 --> 01:24:52,660
You probably got some ecstasy to bonus.
Okay. He probably gave you some food.

1453
01:24:52,661 --> 01:24:53,770
You probably had some snacks.

1454
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:57,500
Like a sandwich is burger from
this donut shop and seeing

1455
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,950
it's phenomenal mouth.
You got to party in the red pool.

1456
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:08,950
Hopefully you didn't have to clean
up after. Everybody's fine, man.

1457
01:25:08,951 --> 01:25:13,420
You weren't the guy that has scrubbed
the fucking the red stain off the side of

1458
01:25:13,421 --> 01:25:17,870
the pool and I'm like, it
was probably that Easter egg
shit, you know, through the,

1459
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,320
you know when you do with kids dunk eggs,

1460
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:23,320
oh yesterday drop those
little pellets into the water.

1461
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:27,820
It turns red food dye and they get out
of the pool and they're just all red.

1462
01:25:28,810 --> 01:25:32,260
He can't get away with that kind of
shit anymore. But back in the day,

1463
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:37,530
like who could you imagine if you could
go back to like the 1950s in 19th like

1464
01:25:38,361 --> 01:25:39,760
the Humphrey Bogart days,

1465
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:45,090
what kind of fucking chaos those
parties must have been like when no,

1466
01:25:45,281 --> 01:25:48,940
there was no accountability. The studios
totally protected people. I mean,

1467
01:25:48,941 --> 01:25:53,260
you'd have to have a dead body before
shit got weird and you would literally

1468
01:25:53,261 --> 01:25:56,170
have to have some, someone would
have to be dead. And even then,

1469
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,340
and even then probably you
wouldn't know about it. Yeah,

1470
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:03,660
I mean we first show or there must
have been some stars that had to call.

1471
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,510
Like what does that show
that's on showtime that I'm
Ray Donovan, Ray Donovan.

1472
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:11,780
We call the Ray Donovan Guy
and Ray Donovan comes over,

1473
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:17,050
he fixing fucking wraps the kid up
in a of of of some sort of a carpet

1474
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:21,190
cleaner. Yeah, they,

1475
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:24,770
they take it downstairs and they fucking
throw it in the furnace and that's it.

1476
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:28,550
That's such a good show. Is it
a good show? It's a great show.

1477
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:32,750
I only watch a couple episodes. I see
what you saw. The first episode where he,

1478
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:35,480
he goes to the girl's stocker and
he's sitting there, you want the bay,

1479
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:38,840
what's in the bag or the bat? And
the guy goes, I'll take the bag.

1480
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:41,330
And then he makes them get in
a bath full of like, you know,

1481
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:45,630
green dye or whatever. And then the guys
just like, his skin is green, you know,

1482
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:49,280
it's not going to wash out for a while.
He's just humiliated and everything.

1483
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:51,590
That's probably what happened
with the Brian Secrets Party.

1484
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:56,690
To be a girl celebrity I think would
be really scary because there are dudes

1485
01:26:56,691 --> 01:27:01,691
that fixate on female celebrities in a
really fucking creepy way and today they

1486
01:27:02,151 --> 01:27:06,620
can find where they live. Oh yeah. It was
very easy. I was drug the other day. Joe,

1487
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:09,380
I told you about it and that scared the
fuck out of me cause that was the first

1488
01:27:09,381 --> 01:27:12,800
time where I actually felt like
something's not right with me.

1489
01:27:12,801 --> 01:27:16,730
I don't know what's going on. And then
I wake up an hour later and I'm like,

1490
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:20,810
what the fuck happened? We'd like where
am I? And it was, it was so scary.

1491
01:27:20,811 --> 01:27:23,000
And I and I talked to girls
about it. We're like, yeah,

1492
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,460
I've had that happen a couple times.
There was a party,

1493
01:27:25,461 --> 01:27:28,000
they have that happen all the time.
They have this nail Polish. No,

1494
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:30,950
I'm restart wearing though. I could just
get my finger in and it changes color.

1495
01:27:30,951 --> 01:27:32,150
If there's any roofie in there though.

1496
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:35,660
Well I think it only works for
some drugs or does it work for Ghb?

1497
01:27:35,661 --> 01:27:38,450
Like if you dip your finger in it and
it's roofing all, maybe it'll work.

1498
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,080
We'll do it for everything.
I think maybe each nail has a different,

1499
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:47,270
yeah, have a drink. Hold on. That
was just my roofie nail need.

1500
01:27:47,450 --> 01:27:51,650
Let me check my Ghb nail.
Alpha males.

1501
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:56,230
Alpha males now have the roofie for
guys. They turn, they turn hearts.

1502
01:27:57,410 --> 01:28:01,970
Pink hearts shows up on your nail if it's,
if it's a negative, but it's weird is,

1503
01:28:01,971 --> 01:28:06,590
I told you this already,
but I got roofie at a bar and it was,

1504
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:11,150
you know, everything just went spinny bar.
Were you at? I was at jumbos clown room.

1505
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:14,030
Well that's a roofie hotspot.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's, it's,

1506
01:28:14,031 --> 01:28:16,960
it's a nice little feed
themselves at Jumbos. Yeah.

1507
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,300
Just cause what am I doing with my life?
Most people end up there.

1508
01:28:20,301 --> 01:28:25,290
They've been roofie two shots
of Ruthie's. Yeah. Fuck it.

1509
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,510
Let's go for something different.
When you wake up,

1510
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:32,050
what do you got on the top shelf there?
Yeah.

1511
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:35,680
They do actually take people,
Take Ruby's on purpose and,

1512
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:39,430
but this was completely different than
who the fuck takes roof. He's on purpose.

1513
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:44,150
It's, it's serious. Like kids or do
it as a drug. They take cap, you know,

1514
01:28:44,151 --> 01:28:47,030
there's little, a five hour energy
drinks, whatever they're called,

1515
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:50,660
five hour energy drinks.
They fill that thing up with roofie shit.

1516
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:51,501
And then they take,

1517
01:28:51,501 --> 01:28:54,320
they're called caps and they take a little
cap and they put it in and makes you

1518
01:28:54,321 --> 01:28:58,630
feel really like, uh, like, like body
buzzy. Oh you mean Ghb? GHB. Yeah.

1519
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:01,690
Which is one of the, one of the
date rape drugs. There's non,

1520
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:05,090
yeah, right. Not roofie
like roof and all that

1521
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:09,150
bad one. Yeah. I don't know which one.
Mine was. Mine Cintas was, I was uh,

1522
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:13,100
I was on my second or I just had my
second drink and I ordered a new drink,

1523
01:29:13,370 --> 01:29:16,700
took like one step of my third drink
and then everything started getting

1524
01:29:16,701 --> 01:29:20,990
spinning like, like by vision, almost
like trippy, like, like I couldn't, like,

1525
01:29:20,991 --> 01:29:23,600
I was like, why is it the room spoke
with your drink. What were you drinking?

1526
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:26,950
Just a little Jack and cokes. Uh, and uh,

1527
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,360
cause you were saying that so and take,

1528
01:29:28,361 --> 01:29:32,450
they take like advising bottles
and squirt it into people.

1529
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,190
A bouncer told me what they do
is they take advising, bottle it,

1530
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:37,990
fill it with whatever the crap they're
using and they'll just like literally

1531
01:29:37,991 --> 01:29:38,830
keep it in their hand,

1532
01:29:38,831 --> 01:29:41,460
walk through and just drop like
why they walk by somebody drink,

1533
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:45,010
just drop it in there. And
uh, he said that roofing guys,

1534
01:29:45,011 --> 01:29:46,480
roofing guys is actually,

1535
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:50,230
he's seen it before where like there's a
guy talking to a girl they want to talk

1536
01:29:50,231 --> 01:29:53,080
to so they'll re roughly the
guy to get him out of the way.

1537
01:29:53,081 --> 01:29:56,650
Like he'll start getting sick or whatever
and go to the bathroom and I passed

1538
01:29:56,651 --> 01:29:57,330
out.

1539
01:29:57,330 --> 01:29:58,740
Yeah.
I never take drinks from people.

1540
01:29:58,741 --> 01:30:02,880
I don't know unless I see it
come from the bar, you know,

1541
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:07,020
into their hand into my hand is just
too many Weirdos if you don't know them.

1542
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,740
Right. You know, you never know. Some
people are like aggressive, but hey man,

1543
01:30:09,741 --> 01:30:14,060
come on, do the shot. Yes, I know
where that shot come from. That's shot.

1544
01:30:14,061 --> 01:30:16,310
Could have come from Mars.
I see it in your hand.

1545
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,090
I have no idea where it was
before it was in your hand.

1546
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:21,600
It's, and it's not just
being roofie or you know,

1547
01:30:21,601 --> 01:30:24,750
like you could grab a guy's drinking.
Like maybe he was, you know,

1548
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:29,370
the other night I did, I saw a guy and
he recognized me and I just, as a joke,

1549
01:30:29,371 --> 01:30:33,210
I grabbed his drink and started
drinking it and I got mad. I'm like, oh,

1550
01:30:33,211 --> 01:30:38,010
I could he be like having the flu right
now and he's still out. You know, it's,

1551
01:30:38,011 --> 01:30:41,880
it's good to just do your own drinks. It
was really weird though, because I pay,

1552
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:45,960
luckily it got to my car and I passed
out and I, cause I couldn't see,

1553
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:49,840
my vision was gone. I didn't feel drunk,
I didn't feel sick. I just couldn't,

1554
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:52,050
my eyes weren't working so close my eyes.

1555
01:30:52,051 --> 01:30:55,660
And the next thing I know it woke up an
hour later in your car, in my car and,

1556
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,690
and I felt, uh, muscle relaxer.

1557
01:30:57,770 --> 01:30:57,891
Well,

1558
01:30:57,891 --> 01:31:00,920
you gotta be really careful about that
because of a cop knock on your window.

1559
01:31:00,921 --> 01:31:02,750
You're going to just send
my backseat. Yeah, I know.

1560
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:05,060
Even if you're in your back seat,
if you're in your car,

1561
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:09,160
I think if you keep your keys and put it
on the roof, something like that. Yeah.

1562
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:12,240
I mean something completely ridiculous.
But look,

1563
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:16,390
it's essentially they have the
opportunity to arrest you for, right.

1564
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:19,460
It's a technicality, you know, you
can tell them, look, I'm not driving.

1565
01:31:19,461 --> 01:31:22,880
I just sat here because I knew I can't
drive to like get out of the car.

1566
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:23,980
They arresting you.
Yeah.

1567
01:31:23,981 --> 01:31:27,200
Which is fucking really gross
because you're doing the right thing.

1568
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:28,550
You realize you can't drive.

1569
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:31,310
You're just locking your door
and letting yourself sober up.

1570
01:31:31,311 --> 01:31:36,311
But there's certain Conti fuckhead cops
that will drag you into jail for that.

1571
01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:40,190
That's ridiculous. And
the next day, a whole day,

1572
01:31:40,191 --> 01:31:43,370
I just felt like I was like on
muscle relaxers. It was fucked up.

1573
01:31:43,610 --> 01:31:47,670
That's probably GHB. Yeah. Somebody
probably whacked you out because, uh,

1574
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:51,950
I have friends who've done GHP before
and they've done too much and then they

1575
01:31:51,951 --> 01:31:55,670
just go limp. Like they'll be
at a bar and then like Eddie,

1576
01:31:55,671 --> 01:31:59,930
Eddie did it once and he did too
much. Wow. And, uh, he just like,

1577
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:03,730
like couldn't walk or his
body just stopped working.
This, his body's went limp.

1578
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:08,620
Yeah. Like my mind was normal but my
body was drunk and my eyes were drunk.

1579
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:12,520
That's so weird, man. Do you have
any idea who might've done it? No.

1580
01:32:12,521 --> 01:32:14,290
I mean there was a lot of crazy,
I mean,

1581
01:32:14,291 --> 01:32:16,540
David Arquette was there
and so I said hi to David,

1582
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:20,530
but there was also some people
that I knew there and uh,

1583
01:32:20,531 --> 01:32:22,780
I talked to them for a bit,
but then I,

1584
01:32:22,781 --> 01:32:26,530
I'm like been replaying it over my head
over and over again and I can't think of

1585
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:31,120
it like, I could almost think that maybe
what if I just grabbed the wrong drink?

1586
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:35,360
Like I grabbed a stripper's drink
by mistake or something or a wow.

1587
01:32:35,610 --> 01:32:38,860
I was trying to roofie them.
Yeah. Who knows? I mean, you
might have been annoying.

1588
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:43,210
I was only there for an hour though.
I like,

1589
01:32:43,211 --> 01:32:46,420
I literally had a spot and I was driving
home and I was driving by and I'm like,

1590
01:32:46,421 --> 01:32:48,100
Oh, you know, I haven't been there
in a while. I'll just go in there,

1591
01:32:48,101 --> 01:32:51,570
have a drink or two and you stop eating
by yourself. Yeah, that's a real migraine.

1592
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:53,020
So no, my friend, my friend,

1593
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:58,380
my friend's a dancer there
and contortionists that's
a real alcoholic will pull

1594
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:03,610
into jumbos or couple hours,
ride out the storm.

1595
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:06,640
Three drinks in an hour. That
could be it too. No, no, no.

1596
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:10,900
And these are like the small
little rock glass drinks, you know?

1597
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:13,630
I mean I drink seven or
eight of those a day.

1598
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:16,150
You don't know who you're dealing with
here, dude. I don't, I really don't.

1599
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:19,900
You never drank with Brian? No.
Are you a big drinker? Yeah.

1600
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:24,220
You want a little drunk right now?
No scared. Yeah. What's the matter?

1601
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:27,830
I'm sitting next to Brian. You're
amongst friends. He didn't know

1602
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:35,440
I saw what you had in there. I didn't.
It didn't entice me. Nothing. Makers.

1603
01:33:35,441 --> 01:33:38,800
We've got some, some. Oh, when we
put talked about on the podcast,

1604
01:33:38,801 --> 01:33:43,330
somebody contacted me about giving
us a wine cooler for, for wine.

1605
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:46,720
Not like a wine cooler.
I wouldn't drink that cause I'm a man.

1606
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:48,220
I don't drink wine coolers.
Now

1607
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:54,200
are you talking about I drank Zima if
they don't even have [inaudible] anymore,

1608
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:00,290
it's called something else, but it's
the exact same thing. It's flavor.

1609
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:04,380
Hard time back in the day for drinking.
[inaudible] was great. Tastes good? Yeah.

1610
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:08,920
Did you get drunk and it taste nice. Did
you remember to Kiza? Yes. What is that?

1611
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:12,400
What was it?
It was like a Tequila beer or something.

1612
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:17,840
Wasn't it like Bud light made it also?
It was like, yeah, it was just, it,

1613
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:22,540
it was a beer, but it had like
lime flavoring in it and it had a,

1614
01:34:22,570 --> 01:34:25,420
but I don't know, it was Kinda
like a hint of it. Tequila,

1615
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:28,240
I don't know if they were
actually mixing the two, but um,

1616
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:32,830
like some of the worst hangovers I
ever had came off to keys, keys, keys.

1617
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:36,640
It's so weird to keys up.
There it is.

1618
01:34:36,641 --> 01:34:41,200
What is this beer with a, a Gavi
nectar and a natural flavor of, uh,

1619
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:45,220
imported Tequila.
So no actual Tequila,

1620
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:49,810
but just flavors, right? Well, the
Gavi nectar is just sweet. You know,

1621
01:34:49,811 --> 01:34:52,300
a Gavi is,
it's actually not good for you.

1622
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:56,710
You know when people like they don't
use honey. Like when I'm mock vegans,

1623
01:34:56,711 --> 01:34:58,550
one of the, that our mock, my,

1624
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:02,540
my old special was about how they don't
eat like true vegans don't use honey

1625
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:05,300
cause they don't think it's cool
to make this bs work for people.

1626
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:09,770
But obviously not good for you. Nope.
It's sugar basically just sugar.

1627
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:13,640
But it's better than like
Splenda or something. Would
you say? Nope. Nope. Nope.

1628
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:15,320
And in fact it away.
SPLENDA,

1629
01:35:15,321 --> 01:35:19,370
it's probably better for
you cause splendid doesn't
give you the reaction that

1630
01:35:19,371 --> 01:35:23,910
you're going to get. Like the, the, the,
you know, the glucose reaction. Yeah.

1631
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:28,490
Stevia is the best sweetener as
far as like health. It's like,

1632
01:35:28,491 --> 01:35:31,130
it's just a plant extract like Stevia.
It tastes sweet,

1633
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:34,640
but it doesn't have any sugar in it
at all. It doesn't taste that sweet.

1634
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,890
It'll look really doesn't taste as good.
You know,

1635
01:35:36,891 --> 01:35:41,600
the reality of Stevia is it's
like, it's like, like a bee sweet,

1636
01:35:42,010 --> 01:35:43,850
you know, it's not a sweet like, right.

1637
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,980
I heard that there was even a new reports
that, that, that Stevia, there's good,

1638
01:35:48,030 --> 01:35:50,360
there's bad things about Stevia now.

1639
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:55,060
Well that's as recent reports and
research was probably done by, you know,

1640
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:58,700
the other companies that are getting their
asses kicked. Yeah. Come on man. I mean,

1641
01:35:58,701 --> 01:36:00,830
he has bad for you.
Hold on like every other week.

1642
01:36:00,831 --> 01:36:03,290
Something else that was good for
you is now bad for you. I mean,

1643
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:07,910
it's a real problem with these fucking
people that create these tests.

1644
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:09,240
Um,

1645
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:14,030
hold on a second that we find out that
the results were skewed just because

1646
01:36:14,031 --> 01:36:18,080
someone funded them from some
company that has a vested interest.

1647
01:36:18,350 --> 01:36:22,670
Why I quit Stevia. Hmm. Okay. Let's see.

1648
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:24,450
Is it like for rule of,

1649
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:28,100
for a reasons and number
four will blow your mind.

1650
01:36:28,101 --> 01:36:30,170
Stevie attacks is the adrenals.

1651
01:36:30,171 --> 01:36:34,700
Our bodies are not designed or evolve
to handle calorie free sweeteners,

1652
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,850
be it natural or other
official experiences,

1653
01:36:37,851 --> 01:36:42,851
sweet tastes from food that is not going
to provide glucose confounds our body

1654
01:36:43,351 --> 01:36:47,810
sugar handling process, I think. I think
it's like your brain pretty much goes,

1655
01:36:47,811 --> 01:36:51,320
hey, you know, this is sugar.
We need to work off the sugar.

1656
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:55,790
But then when you go there, there's no,
it's not sugar. So fucks up the, yeah,

1657
01:36:55,791 --> 01:36:58,630
that's what they're saying. I
read it wrong. It's a sweet taste.

1658
01:36:58,631 --> 01:37:02,300
It comes from a food that's not going
to provide Glu Glucose confounds our

1659
01:37:02,301 --> 01:37:06,890
bodies sugar handling
process, whatever. Plus C,

1660
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:09,740
I just switched back to normal
shit. Raw Sugar. Stevia,

1661
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:13,340
all oh often contains other ingredients.
Oh,

1662
01:37:13,341 --> 01:37:17,900
there's an issue of purity. Hmm.
Hmm. We use processed Divia,

1663
01:37:17,901 --> 01:37:19,070
not pure stevia leaves.

1664
01:37:19,071 --> 01:37:22,670
Obviously you a pot of Stevia
leaves growing in your garden.

1665
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:26,480
You can ignore this point, but there's
a bunch of other shit. Xylella tall.

1666
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:31,490
That's another one, right? Yeah. Popular
sweetener made with Stevia and Xylitol,

1667
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:36,530
although proponents bestow the title
natural to the sweetener. I've never,

1668
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:40,880
I've never eaten trivia because I'm not
a fan of this Uber processed ingredient.

1669
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:45,860
Oh, Trivia Trivia. Truvia
is Xylitol and Stevia.

1670
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:50,710
Stevia has an aftertaste. Eh? Stevia,

1671
01:37:50,730 --> 01:37:54,860
diabetes. Yeah. I, aspartame is not
good for you too, but it's, you know,

1672
01:37:54,861 --> 01:37:56,100
when I think about all this stuff,

1673
01:37:56,130 --> 01:38:00,450
including diet coke, it's all
in moderation. Like, you know,

1674
01:38:00,451 --> 01:38:04,620
you can have a real coke if you want to
just don't drink them all day every day.

1675
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:07,410
You know, I'm a, I'm a big
fan of cheat days, man.

1676
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,170
I'm a big fan of just
eating really healthy.

1677
01:38:10,171 --> 01:38:13,710
And then one day going off the
mother fucking rails, you know,

1678
01:38:13,711 --> 01:38:18,300
and then bring it all back.
Just give yourself a little
day. We don't give a fuck.

1679
01:38:18,301 --> 01:38:21,180
It's hard for me to do that,
man. Only good for a week.

1680
01:38:21,181 --> 01:38:25,410
And then my cheat day turns into a cheat
month. Okay, let me ask you this spiral.

1681
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:29,400
You say that, but you're
so happy right now, right?

1682
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:32,670
You're so successful right now.
You've got so much cool shit going on.

1683
01:38:32,671 --> 01:38:37,020
Your on your favorite show mean like
life couldn't be better if you knew that

1684
01:38:37,021 --> 01:38:41,010
the only way to keep this running the
only way was if you ate healthy by some

1685
01:38:41,011 --> 01:38:44,040
strange metaphysical mirror,

1686
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:47,100
Cole fucking magic thing.

1687
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:50,310
Whereas like if you ate healthy food,

1688
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:54,480
you're luck would continue to be
fucking amazing. But if you got lazy,

1689
01:38:54,481 --> 01:38:57,300
it has nothing to do with your
parents or your talent or your mind.

1690
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:01,440
But if you've got lazy and deviated
from the path, your luck would change.

1691
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:05,850
It would be eaten fucking lettuce,
lettuce wraps and bra fruit.

1692
01:39:05,851 --> 01:39:10,650
And you wouldn't fuck around at
all. Sure. But I love Mexican food,

1693
01:39:10,651 --> 01:39:15,240
man. I love salsa. You put down a
basket of chips. Now bring a second.

1694
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:18,600
Like that's what I want. I'm,
I've never been one in a sweets.

1695
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:22,670
It's always like the starchy carbohydrates
stuff. But do you ever have a case? Oh,

1696
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:27,100
in Texas I've had it. I'm not
the biggest fan. Texas, I think.

1697
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:31,160
I just haven't had great, yeah.
Ships in case. Oh, in Texas is a,

1698
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:35,100
a totally different level. Before they've
Mexican food even comes, you're full,

1699
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:38,070
you ordered chips in case
out, you know, they go, gee,

1700
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:40,800
would you like some chips
and case out like yes ma'am.

1701
01:39:41,010 --> 01:39:45,070
They bring over some fucking case out
when you get to meet in some Jalapenos.

1702
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:47,080
Oh yeah.
They were targeted case.

1703
01:39:47,081 --> 01:39:51,870
So that has like a cow in it
brightened up a cow. I got a,

1704
01:39:51,871 --> 01:39:55,950
I got a moose roast cooking at home
right now. Very excited. A press release.

1705
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:59,220
Where are you getting the Mousse shot?
The shit out of that most. Oh really?

1706
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:03,780
So this is him right here. No Shit.
Yeah, that's it. Yeah, that's it, man.

1707
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:08,160
That's pretty Rad. It's delicious. But
I'm cooking it today. Uh, over 10 hours.

1708
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:12,330
There's Moose roast in one
of those pressure cookers.
Oh, it's so delicious, man.

1709
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:17,210
How many pounds of meat you get out
of that 400 shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1710
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:20,220
Crazy. Did you have to buy a new
freezer or did you have it? Oh No,

1711
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:24,660
I bought a separate fee. I
had one commercial freezer,
but after I shot the Moose,

1712
01:40:24,661 --> 01:40:27,390
I bought another one just to,
just to have the room for it.

1713
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:29,640
You should experiment with
making jerky because dude,

1714
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:32,490
I'm making all kinds of things.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been making,

1715
01:40:32,491 --> 01:40:33,600
I've been doing roasts.

1716
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:36,600
Roasts are the new thing or do
it in the green mountain grill.

1717
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:40,140
I see room on the
outside on a, um, like a,

1718
01:40:40,141 --> 01:40:42,860
of a cast iron frying pan. And then, uh,

1719
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,680
I slowly cook it in the Green
Mountain girl for like 40, 45 minutes.

1720
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:49,770
Cause you know, it's not, not that big.
A roast is only for like four people.

1721
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:52,890
And then this one I'm doing
in a pressure cooker, but I'm,

1722
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:57,060
I've got a bunch of recipes from
Steve Rinella sometime do meatloaf.

1723
01:40:57,070 --> 01:41:01,240
I'm going to make ground meatloaf with
spinach and cheese inside of it and

1724
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:02,680
enjoying cooking.
Man,

1725
01:41:02,681 --> 01:41:07,090
cooking is fun and if you have the
time and you know you're so inclined.

1726
01:41:07,091 --> 01:41:09,260
It's a cool little art project.
Like I don't,

1727
01:41:09,261 --> 01:41:13,120
I don't never think of cooking is like
art but when it comes out it's good.

1728
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,290
Like you get this little
kind of rd satisfies,

1729
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:18,280
made something like I made this
and now we're going to eat it.

1730
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:19,150
This is kind of cool.

1731
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:23,570
There was this a video I recently saw
showing you how to cook the best steak and

1732
01:41:23,571 --> 01:41:24,800
you don't even need to use it grill.

1733
01:41:24,801 --> 01:41:26,450
What you do is you take
this big piece of meat,

1734
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:30,920
you put it in the oven and you slow
cook it in the oven for like an hour or

1735
01:41:30,921 --> 01:41:35,270
something and then you just put it on a
really hot skillet for like two minutes

1736
01:41:35,450 --> 01:41:38,930
just as just a sear the outside and
it's like the perfect temperature.

1737
01:41:38,931 --> 01:41:41,960
It's like red throughout the whole
thing. Not like, you know, right.

1738
01:41:41,961 --> 01:41:43,610
Because when you cook it on a grill,

1739
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:46,880
it's usually red in the middle
and then it slowly goes out.

1740
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:50,000
You know where it's like less red,
you know the closer it is.

1741
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:53,870
This is like right when he cut it in
all the exact color throughout the whole

1742
01:41:53,871 --> 01:41:56,680
thing. The way you do it
just got an hour. I get

1743
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:58,490
that way.
I've seen that way too.

1744
01:41:58,491 --> 01:42:01,880
I've seen also there's a lot going
around with a boil it in water.

1745
01:42:01,881 --> 01:42:05,750
When those plastic bags,
they boil it at like not even boil it.

1746
01:42:05,751 --> 01:42:09,500
It's like hot water, like 125 degree
water, which is below boiling.

1747
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:13,610
But it's like they keep it in there for
several hours and then you take it out,

1748
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:17,450
sear it. And a lot of times people, they
cook the outside actually with a flame.

1749
01:42:17,451 --> 01:42:20,450
They take a like a propane torch
and they'll, they'll, you know,

1750
01:42:20,810 --> 01:42:24,170
they'll char the outside to get
like they're crispy outer edge.

1751
01:42:24,650 --> 01:42:28,730
I've tried every single method to
cook like a regular beef steak that my

1752
01:42:28,731 --> 01:42:32,870
favorite by far is lumped
charcoal on a regular grill.

1753
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:38,470
You get that smoky real would taste to
the stake and you just gotta know how hot

1754
01:42:39,231 --> 01:42:43,450
it is. It's like a trial and error
thing. You got to know how for me, I,

1755
01:42:43,530 --> 01:42:46,070
I take like a two inch stake.

1756
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:50,870
You need three minutes on each side and
then I put it on the upper level of the

1757
01:42:50,871 --> 01:42:54,560
grill. I close the lid and I cook it
for another five minutes. That's it.

1758
01:42:54,561 --> 01:42:58,390
And that kind of gets the inside. Bam.
I've been doing that for like, oh,

1759
01:42:58,410 --> 01:43:02,010
that sounds so, it feels so good. So bad
for people who don't eat meat. I know,

1760
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:05,180
you know, I understand. I get it.
I get the morals and the ethics,

1761
01:43:05,181 --> 01:43:07,800
but those cows are going to dine them and
I want you to do, you're going to die.

1762
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:12,320
My cousins have cows and they just, they
just, uh, send them out to get butchered.

1763
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:16,220
Only got like 1700 pounds of meat.
Wow. My Buddy Doug, does it himself.

1764
01:43:16,221 --> 01:43:18,380
Sanity does he,
my friend Doug has a,

1765
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:22,550
he has grass fed cows and his farm in
Wisconsin and fucking picks him out.

1766
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:26,060
That's where I started getting bummed
out about grass fed cows cause everybody

1767
01:43:26,061 --> 01:43:29,470
has this idea, oh, CRAs had
cows. It's so ethical. You know,

1768
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:31,140
my cows are only grass fed there.

1769
01:43:31,490 --> 01:43:35,120
You go near these fucking
cows and they panic and run.

1770
01:43:35,150 --> 01:43:38,930
They know exactly what you're there for.
Make no mistake about it.

1771
01:43:38,931 --> 01:43:41,810
This isn't like hunting. This isn't
like, you know, you see a deer.

1772
01:43:41,811 --> 01:43:44,780
The deer might not have ever even seen
a person before. Boom, the gun goes off,

1773
01:43:44,781 --> 01:43:48,860
the deer's down. That's
a, that's an ethical life.

1774
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:52,030
These fucking cows to live in this,
it's

1775
01:43:52,110 --> 01:43:56,480
smell it, dude. They know. We went near
them and they fucking ran like we were.

1776
01:43:56,570 --> 01:44:01,220
Demons like were demons that
have corralled them up for
slaughter because that's

1777
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:02,090
what we are to them.

1778
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:05,520
You saw the cows being released from
the milk barn for the first time there

1779
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:09,800
where they're all jumping around like
dogs and having a like there was so happy

1780
01:44:09,801 --> 01:44:11,330
that you just sat there and go,
wow,

1781
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:15,020
they are so happy right now that there
you could tell that there's just like

1782
01:44:15,021 --> 01:44:16,590
crying with happiness. Yeah. Yeah.

1783
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:20,090
They were trapped in those stalls for
their whole life and then they released

1784
01:44:20,091 --> 01:44:22,580
him out in this field and
it just dancing around. Wow.

1785
01:44:22,610 --> 01:44:25,490
Having a good old time with grief.
I think it's a fucking,

1786
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:30,550
it's a real shame that somehow or
another factory farming has become a real

1787
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:35,630
accepted part of the way we get
food in this country. But that said,

1788
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:38,300
I like mate.
I mean it's so good.

1789
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:41,660
I just tried goat for the first time.

1790
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:46,830
I had to go before had goat
tacos and Houston. Yeah. Tacos
as well. We did. They do.

1791
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:51,780
It was an Arizona.
Yeah,

1792
01:44:52,070 --> 01:44:53,990
but why are you saying Ooh
to that? Like, you know,

1793
01:44:53,991 --> 01:44:58,520
like 90% of the world eats goat. I don't
like go, go taste good. Have you had it?

1794
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:01,700
No. I mean I just don't like goat's
so I don't think I want to eat.

1795
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:04,670
It's all in your head, dude. I'm telling
you, you wouldn't like a lot of things.

1796
01:45:04,671 --> 01:45:07,190
You, you know, if you hang out with
chickens, you realize they're assholes.

1797
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:12,230
You know, I told Ya chickens
bite my daughter's face.
I'm like, you fucking cunt.

1798
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:17,000
I'll kill you. Chicken dinosaurs. Man,

1799
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:22,150
they're dinosaurs. I mean it costs $3
in my chickens are sweet, you know,

1800
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:25,160
cause they get pet and they get picked
up and they'll still bite your fucking

1801
01:45:25,161 --> 01:45:28,670
face. They're stupid as shit. Their
brains, your thumbnail. I mean,

1802
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:31,280
literally society,
they don't know what's going on.

1803
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:33,710
They're not doing it on purpose.
They're just trying to survive.

1804
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:35,810
Do you have a problem with
coyotes getting your chickens?

1805
01:45:35,811 --> 01:45:39,680
I saw coyote get my chicken. Oh
really? Yeah. Oh my God. I have to get,

1806
01:45:39,830 --> 01:45:43,580
I've been slacking on this, but I have
to get a, I have to hire someone who,

1807
01:45:43,581 --> 01:45:48,581
they have this urban coyote capture
thing because the thing about we have 20,

1808
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:51,050
well we used to have 24 chickens.

1809
01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:54,680
My dog killed one and the
coyote killed another one. Um,

1810
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:58,790
but I saw the coyote jump my fence
with the fucking chicken in his mouth.

1811
01:45:58,791 --> 01:46:01,190
So I realized, okay, now
I see how the coyotes,

1812
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:05,630
I had a fountain that was near the fence
and the coyote would jump to the top of

1813
01:46:05,631 --> 01:46:08,660
the fountain and jump over the fence.
I was like, Oh, you son of a bitch.

1814
01:46:08,990 --> 01:46:13,340
So I took the fountain down and a
reinforced the areas where the coyote was

1815
01:46:13,341 --> 01:46:13,851
getting in,

1816
01:46:13,851 --> 01:46:17,420
but they know there's food there and
they know there's a lot of food there.

1817
01:46:17,421 --> 01:46:21,830
There's 24 or 22 now,
22 chickens,

1818
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:24,200
so I have to hire somebody.
They do.

1819
01:46:24,201 --> 01:46:27,460
These are urban traps and they
set them up all over at my,

1820
01:46:27,530 --> 01:46:29,450
I don't even live in or
I'm not an urban area,

1821
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:33,290
but they set them up around your house
and they capture these coyotes and they

1822
01:46:33,291 --> 01:46:35,180
fucking Bang, Bang, I'm
going to kill him. Wow.

1823
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:39,170
My cousins live urban traps like
a swap meet or something. Yeah,

1824
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:42,140
urban traps.

1825
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:46,460
It's a gold chain next to foot locker.

1826
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:49,900
It's a pair of Jordan is next to then

1827
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:55,230
one of those little lasso
hose or a noose ankle news.

1828
01:46:55,990 --> 01:47:00,080
Kanye is an issue is announcing is no one,
and I want to talk about it.

1829
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:03,820
You don't like, no, I'm a fucking grown
man. I'm not. I'm not. You and Jamie

1830
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,600
call each other on the phone and talk
about shit that nobody else gives you the

1831
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:10,240
fucking phone mail
stop.

1832
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:12,940
Just don't just don't Brown.

1833
01:47:12,941 --> 01:47:15,300
We have fucking Joshua
McDonald from the walking dead.

1834
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:18,280
You want to talk about Kanye West and
you're 40 years old and want to talk about

1835
01:47:18,281 --> 01:47:21,940
Kanye and I've been telling him that
for years. He's a fucking grown man.

1836
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,200
He's a grown man but he's not like somehow
or another when we stuck them out of

1837
01:47:26,201 --> 01:47:29,510
Columbus and brought him to Los Angeles,
we've stifled is growth.

1838
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:34,210
It actually went back. He went
back, he was 30 then and he's 12

1839
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:38,010
that's completely opposite of what
I've been figuring out lately.

1840
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:41,730
Going through your own video out Joe,
do you remember when, when, when,

1841
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:43,390
when I first moved here like,

1842
01:47:43,391 --> 01:47:46,320
like I didn't really have any friends so
like we would just like once in a while

1843
01:47:46,321 --> 01:47:47,071
like hang out and stuff.

1844
01:47:47,071 --> 01:47:50,550
There was like videos of me just sitting
in my computer and like my first week

1845
01:47:50,551 --> 01:47:53,820
here and I was like mentally challenged.
Retard.

1846
01:47:53,821 --> 01:47:56,400
I don't even know why you would
talk to me back then. I mean

1847
01:47:58,450 --> 01:48:02,690
that you do really well.
You don't even do I, I,

1848
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:06,540
I've gotten back into it. Please go back
and I need to go on the road with you.

1849
01:48:06,541 --> 01:48:07,374
Sometimes they do some,

1850
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:11,390
he's very talented.
Like his video editing skills are amazing.

1851
01:48:11,630 --> 01:48:14,870
That's what I initially hired
him for cause he's really good.

1852
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:19,340
And then he became a podcast
in which he's challenged at.

1853
01:48:19,790 --> 01:48:21,260
He's challenged at communicating.

1854
01:48:21,530 --> 01:48:25,430
He's challenged to thinking about things
that challenge is often his strength

1855
01:48:26,270 --> 01:48:30,320
but his video skills I
think, no bullshit. No,

1856
01:48:30,410 --> 01:48:31,760
and I'm not saying this
just because you're here,

1857
01:48:32,030 --> 01:48:35,200
you're one of the best video editors
I've ever seen. Like your, your,

1858
01:48:35,201 --> 01:48:40,201
your like your sense of like timing
and like you're editing and the way you

1859
01:48:41,271 --> 01:48:45,530
splice things together, you create
something that doesn't exist like you,

1860
01:48:45,531 --> 01:48:50,060
you're capable of like you put these
weird touches on things and the weird

1861
01:48:50,061 --> 01:48:54,170
sounds and music and Ed,
you have a real feel for it man.

1862
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:58,580
Like you have a real town.
Like if you really pursued
that you, you could be rich.

1863
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:00,980
I mean you really could be. I
mean you should. You should.

1864
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:05,870
You should be like a guy that people
seek out to make their music videos and

1865
01:49:05,871 --> 01:49:10,700
shit like yeah. Weird sense of how to
put things together. So real talent man.

1866
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:15,650
Who edited your last special? I
did. Could have been common sense.

1867
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:20,250
Brian. I don't see us having to
do with himself. How much editing.

1868
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:25,170
It's just like that's a camera
cuts. That's what I'm talking about.

1869
01:49:25,171 --> 01:49:29,220
Like he did some stuff like look at
the Austin via is my favorite one.

1870
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:31,680
Great one little Austin.

1871
01:49:31,730 --> 01:49:34,400
Yeah, with the dude that had
the there was born with, no,

1872
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:38,580
no, no, no. I'm talking about the
Joey Diaz. It was me little Esther.

1873
01:49:38,581 --> 01:49:42,690
You share ideas and just
because the editing,

1874
01:49:42,691 --> 01:49:46,860
the audio editing because I remixed
music to go with everything and yeah,

1875
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:48,130
it was funny that you're

1876
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:51,670
really fucking talented with that.
I really think it's your calling in life.

1877
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:55,030
You know? It's like as Joey Diaz
is meant to be a standup comic,

1878
01:49:55,031 --> 01:49:56,650
you're meant to be a video.

1879
01:49:56,651 --> 01:50:00,330
Have more fun doing standup comedy
to know because it's immediate.

1880
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:03,880
It's immediate gratification.
But the you do shit that I can't do.

1881
01:50:03,881 --> 01:50:06,340
I don't have that mind.
My mind does not work that way.

1882
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:09,110
I'm trying to get back into it.
And then this new computer,

1883
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:11,420
it's finally getting to the
point where it's so much.

1884
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:15,050
The rendering thing was the thing that I
hate it and I'm the reason that made me

1885
01:50:15,051 --> 01:50:18,920
stop. And we're just sitting
there waiting for hours. Hours.

1886
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:24,360
What about those new Max, those
tubes, those super masc the tower.

1887
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:24,731
Well,

1888
01:50:24,731 --> 01:50:28,280
it's funny because you'd think that would
be the best computer cause I almost,

1889
01:50:28,281 --> 01:50:32,680
cause I mean I just bought a new computer
and researching those, uh, you've,

1890
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:37,690
you realize that they're using a different
processor that isn't really that good

1891
01:50:37,691 --> 01:50:42,691
for video editing as compared to the
I seven processor that the imax use.

1892
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:48,340
So if you look at rendering times on one
of those machines versus a Imac and the

1893
01:50:48,341 --> 01:50:51,640
imac even comes across being
faster and a lot of the tests,

1894
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:55,210
because those are used Xeon processors,
which aren't really,

1895
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:56,590
I don't know why they use the,

1896
01:50:56,720 --> 01:51:00,080
so is it because the software
is optimized for that

1897
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:04,910
processor? I think so. Yeah.
This is really boring. No one

1898
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:07,990
[inaudible]

1899
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:12,650
well, he would call me like, you know,
after he'd edited for like 12 hours ago,

1900
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:15,390
I'm calling fucking crazy. Like I don't
think I could do the same. We're all,

1901
01:51:15,391 --> 01:51:18,870
I'm almost done, but I'm going
fucking crazy. Like, but the process,

1902
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:22,770
the result was amazing. I just think
you've got a very unique talents.

1903
01:51:22,910 --> 01:51:27,480
That was awesome. Back in the days when,
when we are using mini DV tapes. Oh yeah.

1904
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:31,760
So in order to edit I had to transfer
every single tape onto my computer,

1905
01:51:31,761 --> 01:51:35,630
then look at it and then go
through the 50 hours now.

1906
01:51:35,631 --> 01:51:36,920
I mean you just pull a card out.
Yes.

1907
01:51:36,980 --> 01:51:40,610
Slipped it in. What you should do
while you're single, you should,

1908
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:45,110
you should do some sort of
a, a Brian reviews, massage

1909
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:48,320
powers. I'm scared of that place.
Let's place this now. Yeah.

1910
01:51:48,350 --> 01:51:51,920
Cause my favorite place got busted and
now that they're off fake cops that work

1911
01:51:51,921 --> 01:51:52,754
there and yeah.

1912
01:51:52,890 --> 01:51:56,460
Do you go to jail? Do you go to jail for
going? You just got to play dumb. Oh yeah.

1913
01:51:56,461 --> 01:51:59,370
You go to jail. No, you just got
to play dumb. He's going to go,

1914
01:51:59,371 --> 01:52:03,300
how many here to get my feet rubbed
and rubbed my feet? Yeah. You know,

1915
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:07,860
I'm going to get a foot massage. True.
You know? Do you want anything else? Hey,

1916
01:52:07,861 --> 01:52:10,440
whatever you want to do. I'm just
here. I'm just going to close my eyes.

1917
01:52:10,441 --> 01:52:12,990
You do what you want to do and if
you want a hundred bucks, you know,

1918
01:52:12,991 --> 01:52:15,840
you just do what you want to do. And I
just laid back. Good. I tip good. Yeah,

1919
01:52:15,841 --> 01:52:17,700
I mean, I'm a good tip.
I just liked massages.

1920
01:52:17,701 --> 01:52:19,120
I'm just going to sit here
and you know what I mean?

1921
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:24,800
Going there because you got a little
something extra or was it they got busted

1922
01:52:24,801 --> 01:52:28,010
after the fact and you're like, wait,
I didn't even know. He doesn't know.

1923
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,930
I don't know about rub maps and there,

1924
01:52:29,931 --> 01:52:33,620
this is my favorite website that I read
every single day. Oh, you do know it?

1925
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:40,120
He's been all Hollywood on us.
Josh,

1926
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:42,360
Darren,
you've come a long way since Phoenix.

1927
01:52:43,550 --> 01:52:46,060
No, I mean it's, it's,
it's, it's, but it's, it's,

1928
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:49,800
it is something that also you
have to think about, like the sex,

1929
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:53,570
the sex slave industry. Dang. You will
run into places where you're just like,

1930
01:52:53,571 --> 01:52:56,810
this person does not want to be here.
Like right now where I live,

1931
01:52:56,990 --> 01:52:58,640
this is one of the
craziest things I found.

1932
01:52:58,641 --> 01:53:03,560
There's this apartment or this bold house
next to me and they have like a garage,

1933
01:53:03,561 --> 01:53:06,590
a separate garage out back and
just this little small garage.

1934
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:10,540
And I saw somebody come out of it the
other day and I'm like, what the fuck?

1935
01:53:10,820 --> 01:53:12,560
Why is there some Asian girl in there?

1936
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:17,000
And then like a couple of days later
somebody opened up the door and there's

1937
01:53:17,001 --> 01:53:21,650
like four people living in this little
garage about the size of my car.

1938
01:53:21,870 --> 01:53:22,703
Like,
I mean it's just,

1939
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,810
it's ridiculous and they're just living
there and that's the kind of shit that

1940
01:53:26,811 --> 01:53:27,480
freaks me out.
Yeah.

1941
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:29,620
Okay. But is that just
people that like, you know,

1942
01:53:29,621 --> 01:53:32,620
some people come here from another
country and they're poor and they have a

1943
01:53:32,621 --> 01:53:34,270
relative, here are the
relative says, look,

1944
01:53:34,570 --> 01:53:37,750
you could sleep in my garage until you
get on your feet. We'll set up some beds.

1945
01:53:37,751 --> 01:53:39,160
It's warm.
We're in Burbank.

1946
01:53:39,430 --> 01:53:41,260
You don't have to worry about
it doesn't get cold at night.

1947
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:44,630
Or are they sex slaves? I don't
know. Cause they, they looked,

1948
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:46,100
they looked like they were

1949
01:53:46,810 --> 01:53:51,190
miserable. That's the reality of
prostitution being illegal. Yeah.

1950
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:53,350
That's a big part of the problem.
If,

1951
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:57,650
if prostitution was completely
legal and like a massage, I mean,

1952
01:53:57,651 --> 01:54:01,970
which it should be. I mean, I don't
want to give people massages. Okay.

1953
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:04,430
I also don't want to give
him anybody any blow jobs.

1954
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:08,690
But there's some people that don't care.
They don't, they like giving massages.

1955
01:54:08,691 --> 01:54:13,640
They don't mind giving blow jobs for 300
bucks instead of working at Denny's for

1956
01:54:13,641 --> 01:54:15,610
three days for 300 bucks,
you know,

1957
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,720
and they wouldn't even get 300
bucks to work there for three days.

1958
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:20,090
They could blow you for five
minutes and make 300 bucks.

1959
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:24,470
Some people would do that and that's their
prerogative as adult human beings are

1960
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:29,500
issue is legality and these weird
ethics that we attach to sexuality over

1961
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:35,210
everything else we do. Like everything
else you do, where people serve you well,

1962
01:54:35,211 --> 01:54:38,930
people will serve you, drinks there, serve
you food. They don't fucking want to.

1963
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:42,420
Nobody wants to bring you your
meat. Nobody wants us. Mr Mcdermott,

1964
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:44,180
would you like some cracked
pepper on that salad?

1965
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:46,540
He doesn't want to put fucking
pepper on your salad, right?

1966
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:48,950
That guys only doing it because
he wants your money. I mean,

1967
01:54:48,951 --> 01:54:52,460
he's whoring himself out and I mean
this in the nicest way possible.

1968
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:56,000
He's not really, but I mean, he's doing
it for money. You know, it's a job.

1969
01:54:56,001 --> 01:54:57,920
It's a great job. It's nothing
wrong with being a waiter. Don't,

1970
01:54:57,950 --> 01:55:01,490
don't get me wrong, but it's also
nothing wrong with having sex. I mean,

1971
01:55:01,491 --> 01:55:05,690
we have this crazy idea in our head
that sex is evil and nasty and Ooh,

1972
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:09,320
you're paying for sex.
You get money for sex,

1973
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:13,400
you fucking whore.
Somebody pays you and then they touch you.

1974
01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:16,370
You fucking bitch. You
know, like it's craziness.

1975
01:55:16,371 --> 01:55:21,371
Where we have these weird attachments
that are completely socially constructed.

1976
01:55:21,950 --> 01:55:26,540
We've decided that these things are pad.
The real issue is that stuff,

1977
01:55:26,690 --> 01:55:27,920
sex,
slavery,

1978
01:55:28,150 --> 01:55:32,090
that you're not talking about a
woman who's like just a grown woman,

1979
01:55:32,091 --> 01:55:36,200
a mature woman who decides on her own,
you know, it's just sex. Who gives a shit.

1980
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:38,270
It's a,
it's a fine way to pay my bills.

1981
01:55:38,290 --> 01:55:41,480
I can go travel and I'll do whatever
the fuck I want with my life and I'll be

1982
01:55:41,481 --> 01:55:45,060
independent. It's not that
those are the, the victims.

1983
01:55:45,390 --> 01:55:48,990
The real issue is that when
you have things illegal,

1984
01:55:48,991 --> 01:55:52,960
then everything has to be CD
and hidden and uh, you know, in,

1985
01:55:53,010 --> 01:55:58,010
in the darkness and underground and
then you get things like sex slavery and

1986
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:01,230
it's very analogous to the drug war.

1987
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:05,760
One of the real reasons why the drug
war exists is because drugs are illegal.

1988
01:56:06,030 --> 01:56:10,800
The re one of the real reasons why
there's so much crime and Mexico that's

1989
01:56:10,801 --> 01:56:15,480
related to the drug trade is
directly because drugs aren't legal.

1990
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:16,860
If drugs were legal,

1991
01:56:16,861 --> 01:56:19,590
you wouldn't have criminals that are
selling drugs and have criminals weren't

1992
01:56:19,591 --> 01:56:20,221
selling drugs.

1993
01:56:20,221 --> 01:56:23,190
You'd be able to buy drugs the same way
you go to fucking cvs and buy liquor.

1994
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:27,510
There's no fucking gang wars over
whiskey. It's not happening, right?

1995
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:31,230
Whiskeys sold and it's taxed and
everybody's hands, you'll be fine.

1996
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:34,500
Other than the fact that people drink
it and do stupid shit weather on it,

1997
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:39,620
there's no violence and no murder and
no crime attached to the production of

1998
01:56:40,651 --> 01:56:42,450
fine whiskey.
It's just,

1999
01:56:42,451 --> 01:56:45,750
and that's how it should be with sex and
that's how it should be with everything.

2000
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:50,700
We are adult human beings. If you
want to pay someone to rub your feet,

2001
01:56:50,850 --> 01:56:51,780
you should be able to do it.

2002
01:56:51,930 --> 01:56:56,850
Could you imagine if like back massages
were somehow or another deemed morally

2003
01:56:56,851 --> 01:56:59,820
outrageous and you couldn't
go and get a massage?

2004
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:02,640
Like you know those places at
the airport where you sit down,

2005
01:57:02,641 --> 01:57:05,400
you put your face in that chair and
they come over and rub your back.

2006
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:07,740
What did they suck your Dick?
I've tried.

2007
01:57:10,710 --> 01:57:11,850
Okay,

2008
01:57:13,150 --> 01:57:14,540
I'll put a blanket over us.

2009
01:57:16,270 --> 01:57:19,240
I mean if you went to a place like
that and they gave you a hand jobs,

2010
01:57:19,450 --> 01:57:21,130
he'll be the most glorious thing ever.

2011
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:24,170
If you went to that place and there was
a beautiful Russian lady and she took

2012
01:57:24,171 --> 01:57:28,480
you into this quiet room and she just
copped your balls with one hand and jerked

2013
01:57:28,481 --> 01:57:31,390
you off with the other. Oh well you
had an IPAD, you're watching porn.

2014
01:57:31,630 --> 01:57:33,940
Oh be greatest thing ever.

2015
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:35,290
I want to know what consent,

2016
01:57:35,350 --> 01:57:39,520
like what's the difference between like
if you go on back page and you see they

2017
01:57:39,521 --> 01:57:44,521
have escorts than they have legit massages
where they bring a table over to your

2018
01:57:44,711 --> 01:57:48,220
house and they massage you. Then
they have the same category. Yeah.

2019
01:57:48,280 --> 01:57:52,930
Then they have body sliders where it's
like they bring like a big inflatable

2020
01:57:53,230 --> 01:57:56,770
raft that you have like in a swimming
pool and then you get naked and then they

2021
01:57:56,771 --> 01:58:00,730
put oil over unit and they just slide
their naked body on you and that you're

2022
01:58:00,731 --> 01:58:04,150
not fucking, but he's like, it's
that illegal or like what makes it,

2023
01:58:04,540 --> 01:58:06,460
you have to have insertion.
I mean,

2024
01:58:06,940 --> 01:58:10,630
it just doesn't seem
like escorting can be,

2025
01:58:10,631 --> 01:58:14,620
you can be caught for cause like
if you really, I don't know,

2026
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:18,130
it just seems like, what's the law
without much first the slider though,

2027
01:58:18,260 --> 01:58:20,480
150 bucks usually for half hour.

2028
01:58:20,530 --> 01:58:23,050
Did,
did they define what a body slide or is?

2029
01:58:23,170 --> 01:58:27,220
Uh, there's videos of it. You can, there's
actually videos on youtube. Uh, it's a,

2030
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:30,570
it's, it's, I mean it sounds
great, but you sound like that.

2031
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:33,100
That's one of those things
where it's like, it's again,

2032
01:58:33,101 --> 01:58:37,120
it's like a cultural thing. Like what,
what does a body slider, you know,

2033
01:58:37,121 --> 01:58:39,760
like you have to define it because
like, you know, what's the sandwich?

2034
01:58:39,761 --> 01:58:42,070
Everybody knows the sandwiches,
some shit in between two slices

2035
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:44,410
of bread. If you order a
sandwich somewhere, brings
you a pizza, you're like,

2036
01:58:44,411 --> 01:58:47,850
what the fuck is, this is what we
call a sandwich. You know what,

2037
01:58:47,851 --> 01:58:49,660
what do you call body slider in,

2038
01:58:49,661 --> 01:58:53,800
in northern California is the same as a
body slider in Chicago with the fucking

2039
01:58:53,801 --> 01:58:58,060
body slider man and sort of
a body sound sneaky shit.

2040
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:00,310
Yeah. Body sites. Uh, and, and,

2041
01:59:00,311 --> 01:59:03,730
and you just sit there with like a boner
out and they just pretty much rubbed

2042
01:59:03,731 --> 01:59:08,290
their whole body on your, your boner
body boobs. Like it's just no insertion,

2043
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:11,050
but pretty much everything else.
Is that illegal?

2044
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:15,530
Um, I say no if no insertion.
I don't think it's illegal.

2045
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,800
So it's just an assertion. But I think if
you come, it's probably illegal. Right?

2046
01:59:19,801 --> 01:59:21,380
That's where all the fucking,

2047
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:26,690
that's where the Hullabaloo is about.
Orgasming nobody,

2048
01:59:26,830 --> 01:59:28,610
it's a bunch of haters.
They don't want you to come.

2049
01:59:28,670 --> 01:59:29,930
Is there like a five second rule?

2050
01:59:29,931 --> 01:59:33,110
Like if you company put it in your mouth
real quick and it doesn't count because

2051
01:59:33,111 --> 01:59:36,860
it's going back into your body,
that's disgusting.

2052
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:40,280
Why is it disgusting? It came out
of your body two seconds, you know,

2053
01:59:40,410 --> 01:59:43,890
shut the fuck up. Seriously. Just think
before you say something like that.

2054
01:59:44,070 --> 01:59:46,880
Imagine that undercover cop who
got assigned a body slamming.

2055
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:49,790
How about the undercover cop?
The watches him eat his own company.

2056
01:59:52,410 --> 01:59:53,490
Second rule.
I mean,

2057
01:59:56,310 --> 01:59:58,100
I always find it weird though.
Like if you have it

2058
01:59:58,270 --> 02:00:01,270
goober and your mouth and you could feel
it's one of those thick ones and then

2059
02:00:01,271 --> 02:00:02,950
you spit it on a piece of paper.

2060
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:07,270
The idea of you'd now linking that back
up is the most grossest thing in the

2061
02:00:07,271 --> 02:00:07,451
rural,

2062
02:00:07,451 --> 02:00:11,260
but just a second ago you were in your
mouth just tasting it and true swishing

2063
02:00:11,261 --> 02:00:11,680
it around because

2064
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:14,380
you don't think about it. It's
out of sight, out of mind.

2065
02:00:14,381 --> 02:00:18,220
You don't have to look at it. It's when
you look at it, you know, kind of gross.

2066
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:21,160
It's like if you had to take a shit,
you know that's one thing you're like,

2067
02:00:21,190 --> 02:00:25,240
oh I can't wait to take a shit. And he'd
get on that toilet. Ah, it comes up.

2068
02:00:25,241 --> 02:00:27,790
But if you had a stuffed that
shit back in your asshole,

2069
02:00:27,890 --> 02:00:32,020
just if he had to reach in there with
rubber gloves on and just pack your own

2070
02:00:32,021 --> 02:00:35,620
ass, repack it. That might be one of
the worst things you could ever do.

2071
02:00:35,621 --> 02:00:38,470
Like taking a shit.
It's amazing

2072
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:43,420
when you hold it in for just a little bit,
not a long time.

2073
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:48,070
He'll look shit extra 20 minutes and
then you get on that toilet just ah,

2074
02:00:48,071 --> 02:00:52,960
you feel those logs just
fucking barrel and down the
river. Boom, boom, boom, boom,

2075
02:00:52,970 --> 02:00:56,740
boom. I went to, I took a dump
at the mall the other day.

2076
02:00:58,030 --> 02:01:01,480
I've been trying to eat healthier,
eating more Greens and stuff.

2077
02:01:01,481 --> 02:01:05,740
So it came out like very earthy.
Right. It wasn't anything horrible.

2078
02:01:05,741 --> 02:01:10,450
It just smelled and I flushed and then
the guy came in to clean the restroom and

2079
02:01:10,451 --> 02:01:15,451
started choking and I felt so
good and he just kind of get,

2080
02:01:15,611 --> 02:01:19,060
hear him like trying to clean up and
then he just go at the end, he just goes,

2081
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:22,570
he was in there about two minutes.
He goes, it smells like fucking shit.

2082
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:30,730
Like ah yeah. That was like a highlight
of my life. Like you scored on him.

2083
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:35,050
He scored on him.
He fucking shit in a bathroom.

2084
02:01:35,060 --> 02:01:36,750
That guy's got to go in
there right after you

2085
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:44,110
and I had flood. So it wasn't like
it was still sitting there stewing I,

2086
02:01:44,130 --> 02:01:45,950
it was post flush.
What?

2087
02:01:45,951 --> 02:01:49,190
There's nothing worse than when
you have to shit really bad.

2088
02:01:49,191 --> 02:01:52,910
And the only option is a Porta potty
and you're at a concert and there's 20

2089
02:01:52,911 --> 02:01:56,430
people behind you and there's a long ass
line and you go in there and you plop

2090
02:01:56,431 --> 02:02:00,200
down and you're shitting on other people's
shit that is on top of other people's

2091
02:02:00,201 --> 02:02:02,180
Shit,
which is on other people's Shit,

2092
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:07,330
which is all in smurf juice and you just
drop in logs on top of preexisting logs

2093
02:02:10,011 --> 02:02:13,250
and just gagging.
Meanwhile,

2094
02:02:13,251 --> 02:02:17,450
the band's playing your favorite
song. Freebird no, fuck.

2095
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:21,230
I was here. Did you? I saw this online.

2096
02:02:21,231 --> 02:02:23,670
They had a thing about the Porta potties,

2097
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:26,900
like the whole point of him is you're
supposed to close the lid and then that

2098
02:02:26,901 --> 02:02:29,960
will take the scent out
up through this funnel,

2099
02:02:29,961 --> 02:02:32,360
like this tube and
release the sent up there,

2100
02:02:32,361 --> 02:02:35,420
but the reason port-a-potties smells so
bad it's because everyone just leaves

2101
02:02:35,421 --> 02:02:38,060
the lit up. No one wants
to touch it. Oh God. Yeah.

2102
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:42,410
The deal is this is all bullshit. It's
stinks. It's a fucking confined space.

2103
02:02:42,411 --> 02:02:44,510
You're shitting in a phone booth.
It's not going anywhere.

2104
02:02:44,511 --> 02:02:47,300
That's smells everywhere.
As a society we could try it.

2105
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:52,160
If it's still going to snake, we can at
least give it a shot on the walking dead.

2106
02:02:52,161 --> 02:02:54,500
Do you guys shit out in the woods?
Diedrich dropped blogs.

2107
02:02:54,501 --> 02:02:58,640
We've got trailers out there that
have like their air condition.

2108
02:02:58,641 --> 02:03:02,450
They're down to like 50 degrees so
it's like 90 degrees outside and then,

2109
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:04,760
I mean I'm finding
excuses to take it dump.

2110
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:07,730
Do you sometimes have like long
downtime in between scenes?

2111
02:03:07,731 --> 02:03:11,780
You could take a nice fat nap.
Yeah,

2112
02:03:11,781 --> 02:03:13,610
I still love those if you can.
I mean,

2113
02:03:13,970 --> 02:03:16,760
well because a lot of times because
we shoot on location, so everything,

2114
02:03:17,330 --> 02:03:20,900
it takes a while to get back to your
trailer where like I have a couch or

2115
02:03:20,901 --> 02:03:24,200
something I could sleep on
and so it's rare that a,

2116
02:03:24,270 --> 02:03:28,100
they would make you sit for that long.
How far away are you from like the set?

2117
02:03:28,190 --> 02:03:31,310
Like if your trailer is one place, how
far away is the set where you're feeling?

2118
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:34,820
It's usually always less than 10 minutes.

2119
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:37,610
You were telling us before that you get
there at five o'clock in the morning,

2120
02:03:37,611 --> 02:03:40,250
but when are you done? You didn't
just say when you were, um,

2121
02:03:40,790 --> 02:03:42,440
well we'll use up all the sunshine.

2122
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:47,420
So like the sunsets about 9:00 PM and
Georgia 9:00 PM in the summer. Wow.

2123
02:03:47,690 --> 02:03:50,720
So you're working alone?
Yeah, the fucking date.

2124
02:03:50,750 --> 02:03:54,110
So they try and schedule it
because I think there's like a,

2125
02:03:54,111 --> 02:03:58,520
with the actors union, you have like a
turnaround, like you 12 hours, 12 hours,

2126
02:03:58,521 --> 02:04:02,450
and if they make you come back, you know,
shorter than the 12 hour turnaround,

2127
02:04:02,451 --> 02:04:07,040
they have to pay you. And
um, so I, I dunno. Yeah,

2128
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:11,150
I'd actually, it's because I'm
a, I'm considered a local actor,

2129
02:04:11,210 --> 02:04:15,900
be a local hire because I live in Atlanta.
Then they,

2130
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:20,000
there's like some rules around that where
they don't have to pay me all the time.

2131
02:04:20,001 --> 02:04:25,001
Did you get apartment in Atlanta or did
you rent a house or apartment and um,

2132
02:04:25,670 --> 02:04:27,740
when you,
when you come back to La,

2133
02:04:27,741 --> 02:04:30,650
did you keep an apartment in la or do
you just stay here for a little bit?

2134
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:32,600
I kept one here and then I,
and I,

2135
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:37,170
I'm going to have that as long as the
on the show cause I don't know when I'll

2136
02:04:37,171 --> 02:04:37,980
get killed off and I'm

2137
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:40,530
not going to want to go find a new place.
I like where I live now.

2138
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:43,830
Do you ever go to the producer and go,
listen, I'm about to resign my lease.

2139
02:04:43,831 --> 02:04:46,980
Is there anything I shouldn't
question?

2140
02:04:47,110 --> 02:04:51,300
Currently that happened with one of the
actors who are like at the start of the

2141
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:54,570
season, cause they're secretive to us of
course, you know, but they were like, hey,

2142
02:04:54,571 --> 02:04:58,950
so I have a feeling I'm being set
up to be killed. Should I, you know,

2143
02:04:58,951 --> 02:05:01,020
I don't want to sign the lease. And
I'm like, no, no, no, no, you're fine.

2144
02:05:01,021 --> 02:05:04,800
And they went and signed the lease
and then they get killed. Wow. Dick,

2145
02:05:05,160 --> 02:05:08,880
did they go to them and to go, Hey, what
the fuck? Yeah, they were pretty upset.

2146
02:05:08,881 --> 02:05:10,220
But then there was another guy who,

2147
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:15,720
who literally got it out of
Lawrence Gilliard who plays Bob.

2148
02:05:17,311 --> 02:05:21,330
The guy got his leg chopped off
and eaten by the cannibals. Um,

2149
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:24,330
he didn't want to sign a lease because
he had a feeling he was about to go.

2150
02:05:24,331 --> 02:05:26,310
And so he actually got
the producers a talent,

2151
02:05:26,311 --> 02:05:30,060
like he like sat in the meeting with
them until he wouldn't leave until they

2152
02:05:30,061 --> 02:05:31,380
told him like,
yeah,

2153
02:05:31,381 --> 02:05:35,940
you're going to die in episode three or
whatever it was because he was about to

2154
02:05:35,941 --> 02:05:38,130
sign a lease. That's it.
Yeah. He's just like, look,

2155
02:05:38,131 --> 02:05:42,120
this is going to cost me 10,000 bucks
or 12 bucks. So he just didn't want it,

2156
02:05:42,150 --> 02:05:44,730
you know. I mean obviously you
can break a lease and you know,

2157
02:05:44,731 --> 02:05:46,980
but you're still paying for that.
But um,

2158
02:05:47,010 --> 02:05:49,200
he got it out of them and then
of course, like, you know,

2159
02:05:49,201 --> 02:05:51,840
they didn't tell us that he was dying
and I'm sitting there like texting.

2160
02:05:51,841 --> 02:05:53,670
I'm like, hey man, where
are you live in this season?

2161
02:05:53,671 --> 02:05:55,260
This and he's like radio silent.

2162
02:05:55,350 --> 02:05:57,930
And then I figured out that they were
going to kill him cause I'm like,

2163
02:05:57,931 --> 02:06:02,040
why would he be avoiding me right now?
Uh, it's not telling me where he's living.

2164
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:07,680
It was just weird. You know, whatever,
when you shot, when you had that scene,

2165
02:06:07,681 --> 02:06:08,491
we shut that one scene.

2166
02:06:08,491 --> 02:06:12,600
We shot up the truck and like shut
the gas tank and all that stuff.

2167
02:06:12,810 --> 02:06:17,100
Like w w w how much of that was real?
Like did you, you were shooting a gun,

2168
02:06:17,101 --> 02:06:19,380
was it blanks where you
actually shooting at that car?

2169
02:06:19,381 --> 02:06:21,690
Cause it seemed like you were
actually hitting that car? Yeah,

2170
02:06:21,691 --> 02:06:25,280
it was half and half. So they
did. Um, so they give you blanks,

2171
02:06:25,290 --> 02:06:28,830
but then they tell you once you're out,
you know, just keep firing or mimicking,

2172
02:06:28,831 --> 02:06:32,960
like you're, you're firing the weapon
and then, um, you know, cause they'll,

2173
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:34,290
they'll cut it around and everything.

2174
02:06:34,290 --> 02:06:37,020
I think there's only like 20
rounds in that clip, you know?

2175
02:06:37,021 --> 02:06:38,580
And I think if you really look at it,

2176
02:06:38,590 --> 02:06:40,230
I was probably fired like
over a hundred shots.

2177
02:06:40,890 --> 02:06:44,300
I'm fucking problem with revolvers,
but it's easy if fees,

2178
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:48,710
it costs like five bucks to put
in a muzzle flash and like post,

2179
02:06:49,210 --> 02:06:51,960
you know, so they're like, you
know, so just keep jerking the gun,

2180
02:06:51,961 --> 02:06:55,290
like you're firing away.
And so I did that. And, um,

2181
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:57,240
but then what they do
is they had these guys,

2182
02:06:57,241 --> 02:06:59,820
because we were right next to a corn field
and they had our special effects guys

2183
02:06:59,821 --> 02:07:01,110
like perched on some,
uh,

2184
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:06,000
ladders with these like a paintball
guns with these exploding,

2185
02:07:06,330 --> 02:07:10,170
um, I don't know the
pellets that of spark off.

2186
02:07:10,171 --> 02:07:13,040
So like when I go and I shoot
up the truck, they're fine.

2187
02:07:13,110 --> 02:07:16,440
Actually the ones firing the truck and
BBB, BBB and it just hits on the truck.

2188
02:07:17,580 --> 02:07:22,110
So that was really cool cause they used
to have to like run this line of, um,

2189
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:26,190
of charges or whatever and have those
explode at one time. Well when you,

2190
02:07:26,191 --> 02:07:29,730
when you kill a Zombie, like
what is actually happening? Like,

2191
02:07:29,790 --> 02:07:34,590
cause some of it is obviously
so CGI, right? Like the
blood looks fake. It looks,

2192
02:07:34,591 --> 02:07:38,110
you know,
some of it's not too realistic.

2193
02:07:38,111 --> 02:07:42,010
So they could show it almost like the
craziness of the blood is almost like,

2194
02:07:42,410 --> 02:07:42,920
you know,

2195
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:46,640
varies because the one scene in terminus
when they beat the people over the head

2196
02:07:46,641 --> 02:07:49,220
and then cut their throat,
that looked real as fuck.

2197
02:07:49,310 --> 02:07:52,440
Well, it's super disturbing
with that. They had, um,

2198
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:56,190
like these tubes that were just tied
around their neck and even everyone on set

2199
02:07:56,191 --> 02:07:58,610
was going like, oh, this looks totally
fake. And they're like, no, no, no,

2200
02:07:58,620 --> 02:07:59,940
we'll color that out later.

2201
02:08:00,330 --> 02:08:05,130
And the tubes were actually like gushing
out the blood and so when they cut,

2202
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:05,993
you know,
so they,

2203
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,870
they do the motion to cut and I think
they either had like a rubber knife or a

2204
02:08:09,871 --> 02:08:13,320
lot of times they have a knife that's
just the handle with something like green

2205
02:08:13,321 --> 02:08:16,890
tape on the end and it's so it's not
a full NY for machete sort of thing.

2206
02:08:17,250 --> 02:08:21,090
And then they paint that in
later. The knife is CGI. Yeah.

2207
02:08:21,091 --> 02:08:24,210
So that like if I got this water bottle
and there's no blade on the end of it

2208
02:08:24,211 --> 02:08:26,970
and I just use that and then they can
just paint that in and make it look like a

2209
02:08:26,971 --> 02:08:31,080
knife as a cut my throat. So cool. And
then they just painted out the, uh,

2210
02:08:31,081 --> 02:08:35,310
the tube so that all that was left was
just blood gushing out into the trough.

2211
02:08:35,380 --> 02:08:40,260
A pretty fucking awesome. It looks so
real. It was awful. That was brutal, man.

2212
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:42,970
Well, that whole scene
was like, it was so,

2213
02:08:43,390 --> 02:08:48,390
it was hard to see how these
people could become those people.

2214
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:51,250
It was so hard, especially when they
would show the background on them,

2215
02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:55,720
like how they, where they were when the,
the, the whole outbreak first happened.

2216
02:08:55,930 --> 02:08:58,450
Like they were normal and
then they became cannibals.

2217
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:02,020
Then they're just treating their
marking down on clipboards where they're

2218
02:09:02,021 --> 02:09:05,740
beating people over the head with all
that conical. Yeah. It was really weird.

2219
02:09:05,741 --> 02:09:09,370
It was almost too over the
top because it was like, God,

2220
02:09:09,371 --> 02:09:11,320
I can't see anybody that I know.

2221
02:09:11,321 --> 02:09:14,140
Getting to that point where they
clubbed someone and turn them into us.

2222
02:09:14,220 --> 02:09:18,480
DESC yeah. You know, but, but at
this point you've got to survive.

2223
02:09:18,481 --> 02:09:22,650
You've got to eat terrifying. No, but
all that CGI stuff, Michelle and the,

2224
02:09:22,680 --> 02:09:25,740
the girl with the sword,
like her sword is fake usually.

2225
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:27,690
And that's all painted in after the fact.

2226
02:09:27,700 --> 02:09:31,860
What is her sword look like when she
swinging it around? It's just the handle.

2227
02:09:31,890 --> 02:09:34,230
That's it. Just the handle.
Yeah. Just to handle.

2228
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:39,380
They have no sorts so they have a real
sword but they rarely ever had it out and

2229
02:09:39,751 --> 02:09:40,231
use it.

2230
02:09:40,231 --> 02:09:43,650
You know like they might use it if she's
just like presenting it to someone or

2231
02:09:43,651 --> 02:09:43,981
whatever,

2232
02:09:43,981 --> 02:09:48,600
but then they have like a rubber sword
that looks exactly like it or plastic so

2233
02:09:48,601 --> 02:09:49,950
that you know for safety reasons,

2234
02:09:49,980 --> 02:09:54,000
but then they just have a lot of them
that are either like a half nub or just

2235
02:09:54,001 --> 02:09:58,690
know sort at all. Just the handle.
She has the best weapon. Sure.

2236
02:09:59,030 --> 02:10:00,440
That was one thing that I learned.

2237
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:03,590
If the zombies are coming and then
not those 28 days later zombies,

2238
02:10:03,591 --> 02:10:06,950
they're fucking sprint at you.
If those slow as his armies,

2239
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:11,000
you want to have a Samurai sword. Yeah.
I would have a great old fucking time.

2240
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:14,120
That's one of the things that I didn't
understand about the prison when

2241
02:10:14,121 --> 02:10:15,460
everybody was like,
you know the,

2242
02:10:15,461 --> 02:10:17,840
all these zombies are pushing
up against that wall. I'm like,

2243
02:10:17,841 --> 02:10:21,190
there's not that many gimme a sword.
Let me, let me go out there and

2244
02:10:21,450 --> 02:10:26,060
fuck them are popping them. Yeah.
She just start fucking hacking heads.

2245
02:10:26,061 --> 02:10:30,050
Kind of the sad thing is that we'll
never really get to experience that. Oh,

2246
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:34,580
you say that there were no, with all
these liberals and they're denying

2247
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:36,550
of the Lord the Demon,

2248
02:10:36,551 --> 02:10:39,830
this may rise all this gay marriage.

2249
02:10:39,890 --> 02:10:44,640
It's transgender mayors and all kinds
of shit going on the world. I would, uh,

2250
02:10:44,990 --> 02:10:49,340
take that Samurai sword over basically
any weapon because it's not too heavy.

2251
02:10:49,490 --> 02:10:53,210
Like if you had like Conan sword, like
a big broad sword, that'd be tough.

2252
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:57,100
That's heavy. You'd have to be real tough.
Some, you know, built like the Rock,

2253
02:10:57,101 --> 02:11:01,640
like an aluminum bat. Yeah. But
they don't always die. You know,

2254
02:11:02,550 --> 02:11:04,790
I, that's another confusing
thing about the zombies.

2255
02:11:04,791 --> 02:11:06,620
You just got to poke him in
the eye and they're dead.

2256
02:11:06,710 --> 02:11:09,890
Like it seems like you just get
into their head, their brain,

2257
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:13,040
and it's super easy to stab
someone in the temple apparently.

2258
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:14,650
And the knife just goes right in there.
Like,

2259
02:11:14,651 --> 02:11:19,651
get butter is that Zombie blood that
makes you a Zombie or any secretions

2260
02:11:21,060 --> 02:11:22,700
fucking like and be in the butt.

2261
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:24,860
And when would you get become a
Zombie if you fucked us on me in the,

2262
02:11:24,861 --> 02:11:28,180
but I don't think so, but you're
already infected. So who cares. Yeah.

2263
02:11:28,181 --> 02:11:28,971
You already infected.

2264
02:11:28,971 --> 02:11:33,500
Which is weird because like when the guy
got bit last night and that episode he

2265
02:11:33,501 --> 02:11:37,430
got bit, but if he just caught arises
that wound, does he become a Zombie?

2266
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:42,930
Um, ah. If I put them up,
think, well fuck them.

2267
02:11:42,950 --> 02:11:45,080
I'm not the expert on this thing through.

2268
02:11:45,081 --> 02:11:47,840
I don't think they thought they should
do. Yeah. Actually the whole show sucks.

2269
02:11:49,730 --> 02:11:52,110
I think if the, if the effect, you know,

2270
02:11:52,130 --> 02:11:54,560
cause you're already infected or you're
already, you already have what's in,

2271
02:11:54,670 --> 02:11:57,470
you know, that's inside of you.
If you die, you're going to turn.

2272
02:11:57,471 --> 02:12:01,910
But if you get bit and that infection is
going to come in and trigger whatever's

2273
02:12:01,911 --> 02:12:06,050
inside of you. So if you cut off your
arm like they did and cauterize it,

2274
02:12:06,051 --> 02:12:09,560
then you're probably okay. Because they
did that with Hershel and his leg. Yeah.

2275
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:13,280
You know? Yeah. That was
weird. You know, that was like,

2276
02:12:13,310 --> 02:12:17,840
okay you just guys just fuck with the
rules because it used to be something

2277
02:12:17,841 --> 02:12:20,580
bites you and then it gets into
your bloodstream and like, you know,

2278
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:23,720
well they've been fucking with the rule
since the beginning even in the pilot.

2279
02:12:24,040 --> 02:12:28,190
Um, cause zombies aren't supposed to have
any sort of like recollection of them

2280
02:12:28,191 --> 02:12:31,100
being normal humans.
And the,

2281
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:34,310
there was like a little girl at that
gas station who walks by and just bends

2282
02:12:34,311 --> 02:12:38,450
down and picks up her little teddy bear
that was hers and Tucks it up and walks

2283
02:12:38,451 --> 02:12:39,950
away.
But her face is all mangled.

2284
02:12:39,951 --> 02:12:44,390
She sewed Zombie at that point cause
Frank Darabont was like, fuck the rules.

2285
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:48,830
I'm going to do my own thing. I like that,
you know, he's going to medieval times.

2286
02:12:48,830 --> 02:12:52,790
It gets some chain mail. Right. When
didn't you just wear like a night? Yeah,

2287
02:12:52,791 --> 02:12:55,540
you would just dress
up, but yeah man. Yeah.

2288
02:12:55,900 --> 02:12:59,000
Do that riot police
like they have that uh,

2289
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:03,050
the Kevlar you can't bite to
that shit would break. Yeah.

2290
02:13:03,051 --> 02:13:06,110
You can't even fucking stab some.
There's a guy who made the a,

2291
02:13:06,111 --> 02:13:09,670
the a shark bite suit. Did you
see this? Yeah. Yeah. And I,

2292
02:13:09,980 --> 02:13:14,870
so I did some a shark after dark
during shark week. Shark after dark.

2293
02:13:14,900 --> 02:13:18,710
Yeah. Have you heard of this
show? It's what, you know
Josh Wolfe, right? The comic?

2294
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:22,370
Yeah. Yeah. So he hosts it and they just
talk all about sharks and all this stuff.

2295
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:24,320
And um,
this guy comes on,

2296
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:29,360
he had this like chain mail suit that is
supposedly supposedly a bite proof and

2297
02:13:30,471 --> 02:13:32,100
um,
they were stabbing.

2298
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:33,000
Josh was wearing it,

2299
02:13:33,001 --> 02:13:36,810
they were stabbing him with the knife
and the knife was bending and they were

2300
02:13:36,811 --> 02:13:40,650
trying to stab him in the chest. But
the guy was showing us how, you know,

2301
02:13:40,651 --> 02:13:44,310
you can just take a knife and he had
the glove on and he was slicing like the

2302
02:13:44,311 --> 02:13:49,140
webbing in between his fingers and
everyone's like, oh my God, or whatever.

2303
02:13:49,141 --> 02:13:52,740
And then they gave me an ice pick and he
put his hand out and kind of like that

2304
02:13:52,741 --> 02:13:56,340
movie alien, I had to go in
between his fingers and do that.

2305
02:13:56,341 --> 02:13:59,490
And they told me beforehand, they
go, go ahead and like, you know,

2306
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:01,710
pop them in the hand a few
times because he's not going to,

2307
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:03,360
it's not going to hurt him or anything.

2308
02:14:03,630 --> 02:14:06,960
And so I did that and then I just
started just jamming the ice,

2309
02:14:06,990 --> 02:14:11,460
pick into his hand and apparently
I broke his hand. Oh my God. Yeah,

2310
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:15,900
broke his hip, broke his hand. Josh
told me that Jammin it. Oh Dude, it was,

2311
02:14:15,901 --> 02:14:20,460
I was pounding, but I'm like, the
producers told me that it was okay,

2312
02:14:20,461 --> 02:14:24,060
but he's like, no. He was
like, oh, okay. And uh,

2313
02:14:24,350 --> 02:14:27,630
some people that were with me were like,
oh dude, I think you heard him. I'm like,

2314
02:14:27,631 --> 02:14:30,010
no, he's playing it up. They
said he couldn't get hurt.

2315
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:33,630
Then Josh tells me like a
month later, it's like, yeah,
you broke that dude's hand.

2316
02:14:33,770 --> 02:14:35,550
Wow.
I felt good.

2317
02:14:36,060 --> 02:14:39,420
I am stronger than a shark.

2318
02:14:40,890 --> 02:14:41,650
That's the one thing

2319
02:14:41,650 --> 02:14:43,840
that would freak you out.
Like a shark got a hold of your arm.

2320
02:14:43,841 --> 02:14:48,100
It's a snap your fucking arm.
Like a twig swimming muscle.

2321
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:51,310
Like I've seen a lot of guys get their
arms broken in fights where they get

2322
02:14:51,311 --> 02:14:54,220
kicked and they're blocking the kick in.
The Shin hits there.

2323
02:14:54,221 --> 02:14:55,660
I saw one just last night,

2324
02:14:55,661 --> 02:14:59,290
I was watching access TV legacy
kickbox and this guy got kicked,

2325
02:14:59,530 --> 02:15:04,060
blocked it and his arm just went limp in
the middle. Just start dangling luck. Oh,

2326
02:15:04,170 --> 02:15:05,620
it was crazy.
He and he's still fighting.

2327
02:15:05,621 --> 02:15:09,390
He's trying to throw a knee and he sees
his arm like flopping around to hear

2328
02:15:09,391 --> 02:15:13,080
about Hector Lombard. Yes.
Another one. Tests positives.

2329
02:15:13,420 --> 02:15:17,470
UFC and MMA in general
is a steroid epidemic.

2330
02:15:17,740 --> 02:15:22,650
Started this like really stringent
testing and everybody's getting popped and

2331
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:24,430
just getting popped left and right.

2332
02:15:24,670 --> 02:15:26,920
It's one of the things that fighters
had been saying for a long time that

2333
02:15:26,921 --> 02:15:29,590
everyone's on steroids, you
know, a huge percentage.

2334
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:34,420
Give him number 50 60 whatever the
fuck it is that are on steroids. Look,

2335
02:15:34,450 --> 02:15:37,060
apparently your,
your body just can't.

2336
02:15:37,660 --> 02:15:41,530
The idea of a normal training,
normal training camp,

2337
02:15:42,190 --> 02:15:46,780
which is fighters will work out
sometimes three times a day. They'll do,

2338
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:51,160
maybe they'll run and do
like sprints in the morning.

2339
02:15:51,370 --> 02:15:54,720
Then they'll do some kind of strength and
conditioning in the afternoon and then

2340
02:15:54,730 --> 02:15:58,390
they'll do wrestling or Jujitsu
at night and they'll vary.

2341
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:02,280
They'll the next day they'll do kickboxing
in the morning and running in the

2342
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:04,030
afternoon and weightlifting
at night and they mix it up.

2343
02:16:04,031 --> 02:16:08,890
But you're talking about working out
three times in a day because you have all

2344
02:16:08,891 --> 02:16:10,450
these different skills
that you have to work on.

2345
02:16:10,780 --> 02:16:14,620
You have to work on your wrestling, you
have to work on kickboxing, Jujitsu,

2346
02:16:14,621 --> 02:16:17,860
and there's just not enough time in the
day and there's not enough time for your

2347
02:16:17,861 --> 02:16:21,240
body to heal. And that's where
it comes in. Doctor Field. Yeah.

2348
02:16:22,350 --> 02:16:27,150
It comes to the line, ie bay.
What do you think though,

2349
02:16:27,151 --> 02:16:30,030
with like, you know, Silva was
injured in there saying that maybe

2350
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:33,430
the doctor that he was working with
had that has had a past of, you know,

2351
02:16:33,431 --> 02:16:38,320
over prescribing, you know, uh,
amounts of steroids or illegal,

2352
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:40,400
you're saying maybe,
or he had,

2353
02:16:40,610 --> 02:16:44,210
no, he has, I saw something
the other day where, uh, a, uh,

2354
02:16:44,630 --> 02:16:49,340
what's his doctor's name and he's
like a Brazilian, um, uh, doctor that,

2355
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:53,000
whatever his name is. But, uh, I guess in
the past, uh, this other fighter was like,

2356
02:16:53,001 --> 02:16:54,260
yeah, he, uh, I was,

2357
02:16:54,380 --> 02:16:59,030
it was approved to use this
kind of steroid or something
like that for an injury.

2358
02:16:59,180 --> 02:17:02,210
And he gave me too much.
And then I, uh, you know,

2359
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:06,890
which caused me to be like seven
months of being penalized, you know,

2360
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:10,430
out of the UFC,
and I forget this fighter's name,

2361
02:17:10,431 --> 02:17:13,230
but he says that's what's happening
is Silva Silva, he's like,

2362
02:17:13,340 --> 02:17:16,580
been fighting some 17. He's
never touched steroids. You know,

2363
02:17:16,581 --> 02:17:20,300
he's been working this injury
and it might just be that, right?

2364
02:17:20,750 --> 02:17:23,810
It could be. There's a lot
of, it could be that, but uh,

2365
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:25,760
another issue was there was a,
um,

2366
02:17:25,910 --> 02:17:30,380
a TV show they did a long time
ago back from Anderson's house.

2367
02:17:30,770 --> 02:17:31,460
And,
uh,

2368
02:17:31,460 --> 02:17:36,460
one of the things that they saw in the
background was pen tips for a Norditrope

2369
02:17:36,851 --> 02:17:38,330
and it was on the shelf.

2370
02:17:38,400 --> 02:17:43,400
A very specific box that has pen tips
nor to trope in is a type of human growth

2371
02:17:43,881 --> 02:17:48,650
hormone pen. And you take this human
growth hormone injected in someone's body.

2372
02:17:49,070 --> 02:17:53,760
Um, and so that might not have been
his, so who knows, UFC fighter claim.

2373
02:17:53,761 --> 02:17:57,490
Some doctor who screwed up his TRT has
now victimized Anderson Silva. Yeah, yeah,

2374
02:17:57,491 --> 02:18:01,870
yeah. Listen, you can't listen to these
guys though, because there's a lot. Yeah.

2375
02:18:01,880 --> 02:18:04,000
See Big Foot, you know, he,

2376
02:18:04,700 --> 02:18:09,700
he's blaming a doctor for him taking an
abnormally high dose of testosterone.

2377
02:18:10,730 --> 02:18:12,620
Maybe true may not be true,

2378
02:18:12,680 --> 02:18:16,580
but it's within his best interest
to say that the doctors at fault,

2379
02:18:16,581 --> 02:18:17,480
and it's not his fault.

2380
02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:20,990
The doctor said he was going to sue
him because the doctors like, you know,

2381
02:18:20,991 --> 02:18:22,100
you're,
you're lying.

2382
02:18:22,101 --> 02:18:26,630
I didn't do anything unethical
or outrageous to you and
everything you wanted me

2383
02:18:26,631 --> 02:18:29,820
to do, I did for you. Who the fuck
knows who's telling the truth? It's a,

2384
02:18:29,830 --> 02:18:32,720
it's totally a, he said she same
thing, it turns into a game,

2385
02:18:32,750 --> 02:18:35,630
but Anderson was coming back
from a broken leg and um,

2386
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:40,160
he tested positive for
the way I understand it.
Metabolites, which means it was,

2387
02:18:40,220 --> 02:18:44,570
it was leaving his system is a very
trace amount. If that is the case,

2388
02:18:45,050 --> 02:18:47,990
it could very well be that he got on
some steroids so that he could heal up

2389
02:18:47,991 --> 02:18:51,290
quicker. Because what steroids do is
they allow you to recover quicker.

2390
02:18:51,291 --> 02:18:54,860
So if he's 39 years old and
he broke his fucking leg,

2391
02:18:54,890 --> 02:18:59,890
you're talking about a long ass period
of recovery or you take steroids and you

2392
02:19:00,231 --> 02:19:04,820
recover in nine months instead
of 15 months or you know,

2393
02:19:04,821 --> 02:19:06,500
fill in the blank with whatever,
the real numbers.

2394
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:09,980
So that could be what was going on.
But the reality is it's illegal.

2395
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:15,020
You can't do it if it takes you 15 months,
you use the excuse cannot be,

2396
02:19:15,230 --> 02:19:19,460
oh, I'm going to give you some illegal
drugs. So that you heal quicker. Um,

2397
02:19:19,550 --> 02:19:22,370
this is the only reason why you take
these drugs. Don't worry about it.

2398
02:19:22,371 --> 02:19:23,151
You'll be fine.
No,

2399
02:19:23,151 --> 02:19:26,540
you're never allowed to take steroids
because one of the things that happens

2400
02:19:26,541 --> 02:19:27,640
when he takes is it,

2401
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:32,680
it creates permanent changes in your
muscles depending upon the steroid,

2402
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:36,070
permanent changes,
permanent like your, your,

2403
02:19:36,071 --> 02:19:38,910
your muscle density and
your tenant strength and,

2404
02:19:38,911 --> 02:19:40,700
and various attributes of your muscles.

2405
02:19:40,701 --> 02:19:45,701
It's been proven that some of the
benefits of steroids continue permanently.

2406
02:19:46,490 --> 02:19:48,770
So it's not just when you're on them,

2407
02:19:48,830 --> 02:19:51,650
you're a fucking the hulk
because a lot of these guys,

2408
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:55,190
especially back in the day when they
were fighting and pride like they,

2409
02:19:55,610 --> 02:19:58,760
I had ants in any way who was on the
podcast, who was a fighter from pride.

2410
02:19:58,760 --> 02:19:59,571
It was totally clean,

2411
02:19:59,571 --> 02:20:02,720
who said it was on his fucking contract
that they said on the contract,

2412
02:20:02,721 --> 02:20:04,220
we will not test you for steroids.

2413
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:07,640
They set on the contract
encouraged guys to take steroids.

2414
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,140
So a lot of guys took it,

2415
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:13,460
but you get stronger than
you're supposed to be.

2416
02:20:13,461 --> 02:20:16,940
You're not really a person anymore.
It's like if you're a person, okay,

2417
02:20:17,350 --> 02:20:19,820
like let's imagine,
you know,

2418
02:20:19,821 --> 02:20:22,140
they're doing all these weird things
now with genetics where they're,

2419
02:20:22,141 --> 02:20:27,141
they're taking like a fucking a mouse
and a growing a human ear on its back and

2420
02:20:27,411 --> 02:20:30,040
then, you know, taking that human
man, inserting it in a person,

2421
02:20:30,041 --> 02:20:31,460
what do all these weird shit with people?

2422
02:20:31,820 --> 02:20:36,820
If they take Josh McDermitt and they add
one 10th of 1% rhino genes and all of a

2423
02:20:38,181 --> 02:20:41,660
sudden you're fucking running
through brick walls and ra,

2424
02:20:41,810 --> 02:20:45,020
are you even a person anymore?
If you get off that drug,

2425
02:20:45,021 --> 02:20:48,110
but you retain a fraction of that ability,

2426
02:20:48,380 --> 02:20:51,020
whatever the fraction
is you, you're, it's,

2427
02:20:51,050 --> 02:20:53,480
it's arguable that a
person who takes steroids,

2428
02:20:53,481 --> 02:20:58,100
especially prolonged steroid use over
a long career of fighting, you know,

2429
02:20:58,190 --> 02:21:02,420
you know, you've fought for 15 years, been
taking steroids for 15 years. You might,

2430
02:21:02,480 --> 02:21:07,340
you're not really technically the same
as you would ever be without those

2431
02:21:07,341 --> 02:21:10,250
steroids. Like you're, you're
another category. You're a,

2432
02:21:10,820 --> 02:21:15,020
Coca Cola has a certain amount
of ingredients. Okay, this
is a bad analogy, I know.

2433
02:21:15,021 --> 02:21:18,530
But if you look at the ingredients
of Coca Cola and you add Tequila,

2434
02:21:18,620 --> 02:21:20,630
that is not fucking cocacola anymore.

2435
02:21:20,780 --> 02:21:24,450
Now you have a new thing and
shit sandwich should be able to,

2436
02:21:24,770 --> 02:21:29,210
should you be able to serve that, that
Coca Cola Tequila out of a coke machine?

2437
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:32,540
No, he should not because
people are looking for coke now.

2438
02:21:32,541 --> 02:21:36,740
Human beings very widely biologically,
so it's not the best analogy,

2439
02:21:36,741 --> 02:21:38,330
but the reality is,

2440
02:21:38,331 --> 02:21:42,830
especially as this is this whole steroid
out could epidemic is one thing we have

2441
02:21:42,831 --> 02:21:46,430
to recognize. The use of steroids
is less than a hundred years old,

2442
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:48,980
less than a hundred years old
and steroids in athletics.

2443
02:21:49,190 --> 02:21:52,490
I mean I don't know what the fuck they
taking in the 1940s if they had anything

2444
02:21:52,590 --> 02:21:56,600
to complain, but they did. They did
take, came back then. I mean they did.

2445
02:21:56,630 --> 02:21:59,870
They most certainly did. Amphetamines
if always been an issue with baseball,

2446
02:22:00,110 --> 02:22:04,580
amphetamines and stimulants and things
that increase your ability to concentrate

2447
02:22:04,910 --> 02:22:06,740
and your, you know, your
ability to stay awake.

2448
02:22:07,490 --> 02:22:09,530
He's always been substances
that people have taken.

2449
02:22:09,860 --> 02:22:12,500
But the actual use of antibiotics,

2450
02:22:12,501 --> 02:22:16,400
steroids in human beings is
relatively recent in human history.

2451
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:18,830
And I think that as time goes on,

2452
02:22:18,831 --> 02:22:23,210
they're going to create more and
more powerful and crazier shit.

2453
02:22:23,510 --> 02:22:27,090
And it's going to get to the point where
you're going to test negative because

2454
02:22:27,091 --> 02:22:30,690
you're not on it anymore.
But your body will forever be changed.

2455
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:33,910
Like you'll girls would be in denial
about having a fake button. I'm like, God,

2456
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:37,860
it's totally my butt. Well cause they can
take the fat, suck it out of your size,

2457
02:22:37,861 --> 02:22:41,700
pack it in your ass and it stays
in your ass. Now you know they,

2458
02:22:41,701 --> 02:22:44,640
it stays forever. When you gain
weight, you're asking its weight.

2459
02:22:44,641 --> 02:22:46,620
When you lose weight,
your ass loses weight,

2460
02:22:46,830 --> 02:22:50,010
but your ass will always have more fat
than it ever did before because you've

2461
02:22:50,011 --> 02:22:53,940
literally pack fat in there and people
can lie about it. And I got that scar.

2462
02:22:53,941 --> 02:22:55,290
I fell on a swinging when I was little.

2463
02:22:57,420 --> 02:22:59,010
You're going to have
men that are like that.

2464
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:01,590
You're going to take a guy and
you're going to give him a shot.

2465
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:03,210
And he's going to turn
into the fucking hulk,

2466
02:23:03,420 --> 02:23:05,220
and then that's shot's
going to wear off in,

2467
02:23:05,221 --> 02:23:07,980
his body's going to stay the same and it's
going to happen. It's going to happen.

2468
02:23:08,340 --> 02:23:09,760
There's,
they're on their way there.

2469
02:23:09,761 --> 02:23:13,560
There's all sorts of like this thing
that Hector lumbar got popped for today.

2470
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:17,400
I've never even heard of this shit before.
They're calling a DMT,

2471
02:23:17,430 --> 02:23:21,990
which is obviously not dimethyltryptamine,
but it's, I'm going to try this.

2472
02:23:21,991 --> 02:23:26,040
What if it was yes,
so methyl testosterone,

2473
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:31,260
deso desks, wo de soc psy, d e s o, x,

2474
02:23:31,261 --> 02:23:35,670
y to socksy methyl testosterone,
men destock,

2475
02:23:35,800 --> 02:23:39,930
socksy, detoxy, methy
testosterone, I dunno.

2476
02:23:40,530 --> 02:23:42,330
Whatever the fuck that is.
I never heard of it before.

2477
02:23:42,570 --> 02:23:45,960
And so it's apparently a designer,
anabolic steroids.

2478
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:49,950
So what I think that means is that
these one of these steroids has been

2479
02:23:49,951 --> 02:23:53,640
concocted to get around the rules.
Like, um, you know, they had that shit.

2480
02:23:53,641 --> 02:23:58,170
The clear that Barry Bonds was on the
ball co scandal that was all about,

2481
02:23:58,171 --> 02:24:03,171
they devised a steroid that was very
similar in efficacy in the way it worked,

2482
02:24:04,290 --> 02:24:09,290
but not the same exact molecular
structure as like antibiotics,

2483
02:24:09,381 --> 02:24:12,780
doors that are common.
So they were able to put it on these guys.

2484
02:24:12,980 --> 02:24:14,880
Like it was like a lotion.
You would rub it on,

2485
02:24:14,881 --> 02:24:19,350
your body would fucking get crazy
and they would pass these tests.

2486
02:24:20,310 --> 02:24:24,210
You know this, the tests are getting way,
way more sophisticated. So who knows?

2487
02:24:24,211 --> 02:24:25,080
Lombard must've.

2488
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:29,130
I mean it must've thought that he couldn't
get in trouble for this shit. I Dunno,

2489
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:33,120
I don't understand it. Have you
ever tried a steroids, Josh? No.

2490
02:24:33,570 --> 02:24:38,550
I mean I've had like steroid
shots, cortisone shots,
stuff like that. But no dude,

2491
02:24:38,551 --> 02:24:41,610
they used to have the shit you could buy.
The strongest shit that I ever took.

2492
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:45,070
You could buy, you could buy it in. Um,

2493
02:24:45,510 --> 02:24:50,510
you could buy it in like GNC
and it was called Mag 10.

2494
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:52,800
It was ridiculous.

2495
02:24:53,550 --> 02:24:58,550
You take like 10 pills a day and you
would gain like I gained like 10 pounds of

2496
02:25:00,541 --> 02:25:03,760
muscle in like six weeks
of doing it too and this,

2497
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:07,620
and this is how I know that it was a
total steroid because first of all,

2498
02:25:07,621 --> 02:25:09,390
now it's illegal.
You can't sell anymore.

2499
02:25:09,420 --> 02:25:13,320
But when I got off it and my Dick took
a vacation, it's like, see a dude,

2500
02:25:13,950 --> 02:25:18,270
like my testosterone just shut down.
It just stopped working and I was like,

2501
02:25:18,271 --> 02:25:19,860
whoa,
this is crazy.

2502
02:25:19,861 --> 02:25:24,490
Like I couldn't get it up like my dick
was broken for like two weeks up brief

2503
02:25:25,260 --> 02:25:28,630
man. But it's some shit
that you could just buy.

2504
02:25:29,170 --> 02:25:33,130
They used to be all these loopholes.
You can buy stuff at Gnc,

2505
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:37,240
you could just buy these things
tribulus still no, that's legal. See,

2506
02:25:37,241 --> 02:25:40,660
those are very mild tribulus
and it's still fucked with me.

2507
02:25:40,661 --> 02:25:43,630
I remember taking that and then after
a couple of weeks getting kind of like

2508
02:25:43,960 --> 02:25:48,610
angry or that doesn't really make sense.
No, no. That's why were you taking it?

2509
02:25:48,611 --> 02:25:50,710
Very mild. I hang out with Joe Rogan. Man

2510
02:25:53,530 --> 02:25:55,660
Tribulus is just a route and it does,

2511
02:25:55,690 --> 02:26:00,580
it very mildly enhances your
body's production of testosterone.

2512
02:26:00,940 --> 02:26:05,170
There's another one called tongue
got Ali that has a similar effect.

2513
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:06,240
That's also like a,

2514
02:26:06,490 --> 02:26:11,490
a plant based substance that mildly
enhances your body's ability to,

2515
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:14,380
but it doesn't fuck with
the production of it.

2516
02:26:14,381 --> 02:26:17,660
The thing about steroids is
what happens is like you, you,

2517
02:26:17,661 --> 02:26:22,661
you take something and it just jacks your
body's levels of testosterone so then

2518
02:26:22,931 --> 02:26:26,740
your body's natural production
of testosterone shuts down.

2519
02:26:27,190 --> 02:26:31,690
And that's why like when I took that in
mag 10 stuff, like after I got off of it,

2520
02:26:31,750 --> 02:26:35,000
my body was like, yeah dude, I'm
not really feeling like fuck him.

2521
02:26:35,050 --> 02:26:37,300
We're just gonna.
We'll just take a little break here.

2522
02:26:37,900 --> 02:26:42,160
I mean it took two weeks to
get your wiener back, but
d two weeks it was really,

2523
02:26:42,161 --> 02:26:45,040
you know how long ago you were maybe,

2524
02:26:45,070 --> 02:26:49,120
I mean did you feel any other side effects
after going off of it or it felt like

2525
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:52,210
how long did it take physically weaker
and, and then I lost some weight,

2526
02:26:52,390 --> 02:26:55,180
like a loss, like muscle mass. Like
you gained a certain amount of muscle,

2527
02:26:55,210 --> 02:26:58,780
but there was like a lot of these things
that you could just buy these shoes,

2528
02:26:58,781 --> 02:27:01,320
buy them at stores cause they
were like these loopholes. Like,

2529
02:27:01,540 --> 02:27:03,740
like you know how bath salts exists.
Do you know,

2530
02:27:04,090 --> 02:27:05,620
do you know the whole story behind it?

2531
02:27:05,890 --> 02:27:09,370
It exists for folks who don't know because
you would take something like crystal

2532
02:27:09,371 --> 02:27:14,140
Meth, which is an absolutely illegal
drug. But if you change just one compound,

2533
02:27:14,380 --> 02:27:19,150
one molecule of that compound,
just alter it slightly and then sell it.

2534
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:22,180
No one can say it's illegal
because it's not illegal.

2535
02:27:22,181 --> 02:27:23,530
It's not the same thing anymore.

2536
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:26,830
If meth is illegal and then
you just tweak it a little bit.

2537
02:27:26,831 --> 02:27:30,660
Like dimethyltryptamine was turned the,

2538
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:34,720
this is the psychedelic drug was
made illegal in 1970 by the sweeping

2539
02:27:34,721 --> 02:27:39,721
psychedelic act of 1970 but they
missed five methoxy field trip to me,

2540
02:27:39,921 --> 02:27:41,530
which is actually stronger.

2541
02:27:41,770 --> 02:27:46,270
There's an end dimethyltryptamine and
then five methoxy dimethyltryptamine five

2542
02:27:46,271 --> 02:27:50,800
methoxy dive the trip to me and it's
like d dimethyltryptamine like an oxygen

2543
02:27:50,801 --> 02:27:52,420
molecule attached to
or something like that.

2544
02:27:52,750 --> 02:27:57,370
So it's just slightly different but legal.
But if you smoked it,

2545
02:27:57,371 --> 02:28:01,870
you would go to the center of the fucking
universe and converge with God in the

2546
02:28:01,871 --> 02:28:06,230
most epic journey of your life. I mean
it's like way stronger than mushrooms.

2547
02:28:06,231 --> 02:28:06,650
Yeah.

2548
02:28:06,650 --> 02:28:11,650
I mean you took a good
breakthrough dose of five Meo DMT,

2549
02:28:11,870 --> 02:28:14,830
he'll change you for the rest of your
fucking life. And that was legal.

2550
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:19,330
And it was only legal because it
wasn't technically dimethyltryptamine,

2551
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:22,490
which was illegal.
So that's what his bath salts thing is.

2552
02:28:22,820 --> 02:28:25,850
They alter the compound
slightly and then they sell it,

2553
02:28:25,851 --> 02:28:27,170
not for human consumption.

2554
02:28:27,171 --> 02:28:31,100
They say bath salts and then they sell
it at grocery stores or I mean, you know,

2555
02:28:31,130 --> 02:28:33,890
seven 11 so wherever they want to
send like gas stations mostly I think.

2556
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:39,020
And they can get away with doing that
because it's not technically the same drug

2557
02:28:39,260 --> 02:28:40,760
and they just keep altering it,

2558
02:28:40,790 --> 02:28:44,180
keep tweaking it a little bit here and
tweaking it a little bit there with

2559
02:28:44,181 --> 02:28:47,060
varying results too,
which is really weird.

2560
02:28:47,450 --> 02:28:52,450
Like the difference between DMT and
five Meo DMT is profound in the effects.

2561
02:28:54,170 --> 02:28:57,920
Five meo is stronger,
but there's no visual experience.

2562
02:28:57,921 --> 02:29:02,921
The visual is just pure white and it's
like white molecules like fractal white

2563
02:29:02,991 --> 02:29:07,090
around you. It doesn't have
the visual effect of an end.

2564
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:11,450
Dimethyltryptamine and dimethyltryptamine
it's just what you know. The,

2565
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:16,220
the with Iowasca is based on, and
it's all, it's very hallucinogenic.

2566
02:29:16,221 --> 02:29:20,180
Like the things you see, the visuals
are spectacular, the colors are amazing.

2567
02:29:20,390 --> 02:29:24,980
All those things are missing from five
meo which is like kissing cousins to the

2568
02:29:24,981 --> 02:29:26,720
same drug. So it's, so that's,

2569
02:29:26,721 --> 02:29:31,310
I think one of the things that's wrong
with bass salts is like some of 'em,

2570
02:29:31,360 --> 02:29:31,550
you know,

2571
02:29:31,550 --> 02:29:35,720
you tweak it one way or another and
especially on different individuals have

2572
02:29:35,721 --> 02:29:36,530
different,

2573
02:29:36,530 --> 02:29:39,800
they have via biodiversity and the
way they respond to different drugs.

2574
02:29:40,220 --> 02:29:43,070
You have varying effects.
Like that fucking dude, wait,

2575
02:29:43,071 --> 02:29:47,780
that dude's face off grief.
Just like zombies.

2576
02:29:48,110 --> 02:29:49,210
We bring it back.
This zone.

2577
02:29:49,300 --> 02:29:53,200
Bees, how do you remember
all that Shit, man. Drugs.

2578
02:29:53,350 --> 02:29:56,290
Drugs helped me remember it.
I take Alpha brain.

2579
02:29:56,320 --> 02:29:59,620
That helps you remember you had to
have been really good in school.

2580
02:29:59,800 --> 02:30:02,760
I was terrible in school. That
makes no sense because you, you,

2581
02:30:02,761 --> 02:30:06,490
you capture so much information. You're
an encyclopedia of knowledge. Like,

2582
02:30:06,910 --> 02:30:09,610
I mean I was talking to someone the
other day, I don't remember who,

2583
02:30:09,611 --> 02:30:11,900
but I was just like, yeah, he like, he'll,

2584
02:30:12,130 --> 02:30:15,160
he'll start saying something and just
like 10 minutes later you're just like,

2585
02:30:15,250 --> 02:30:17,320
I don't,
I don't even remember what you said.

2586
02:30:17,321 --> 02:30:21,160
There was so much information you just
threw at me and it's not like you're like,

2587
02:30:21,310 --> 02:30:23,140
because for me, I'm always like, yeah.

2588
02:30:23,141 --> 02:30:27,610
So then there's this one drug and
it's like five and it's not something,

2589
02:30:27,611 --> 02:30:31,090
but anyway, no, you like, I dunno
when you learned about all this,

2590
02:30:31,091 --> 02:30:35,320
but I guarantee it was a while ago and
like you still can recall it like that

2591
02:30:35,820 --> 02:30:36,300
and that's,

2592
02:30:36,300 --> 02:30:40,900
but that's only certain Meyer that it's
only things that I'm interested in. See,

2593
02:30:40,901 --> 02:30:43,840
I have a photographic
memory for some things,

2594
02:30:44,290 --> 02:30:47,650
but for things that I don't give
a fuck about, there's no memory.

2595
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:51,250
That's why he wasn't good in school.
He just didn't give it 100%.

2596
02:30:51,580 --> 02:30:54,550
I remember like teachers
that were annoying. Yeah.

2597
02:30:54,630 --> 02:30:56,770
I remember funny things
that happened in school.

2598
02:30:57,090 --> 02:31:00,810
I remember things that I learned
that I thought were, was fascinating,

2599
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:05,910
but if I didn't care, like I, my brain
only works for Shit I care about.

2600
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:09,780
If I, I'm like completely
reckless in that regard.

2601
02:31:09,781 --> 02:31:14,340
Like I didn't plan for the future at all.
Never graduated college,

2602
02:31:14,550 --> 02:31:16,470
never thought about it. Never like, man,

2603
02:31:16,471 --> 02:31:19,380
I need to figure out a way to get
a real job. Right? Nope. Nope.

2604
02:31:19,410 --> 02:31:22,320
Not gonna do it for,
from the jump.

2605
02:31:22,380 --> 02:31:24,420
Like I went to college for three years,

2606
02:31:25,110 --> 02:31:27,720
like completely just so that
people didn't think I was a loser.

2607
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:30,510
This is the only reason why
I barely paid attention.

2608
02:31:30,511 --> 02:31:33,180
I went to Umass Boston
and just fucking half it.

2609
02:31:33,300 --> 02:31:36,690
I didn't even take my sats
because I'm one out of college.

2610
02:31:36,691 --> 02:31:39,220
I took a year off and I was like,
well, eventually I'll take my sats,

2611
02:31:39,290 --> 02:31:42,210
I'll go to school, get a degree.
But that was a bullshit in myself.

2612
02:31:42,630 --> 02:31:45,270
And then a year later I was like,
I gotta do something.

2613
02:31:45,271 --> 02:31:48,270
I can't keep telling people that I'm
eventually going to go back to college.

2614
02:31:48,271 --> 02:31:49,260
So I started going,

2615
02:31:49,470 --> 02:31:52,800
Umass Boston had this like continuing
education program where you didn't even

2616
02:31:52,801 --> 02:31:55,190
have to, um, have to, uh,

2617
02:31:55,230 --> 02:31:59,310
have sat scores and he just had to
have not failed high school, I guess.

2618
02:31:59,311 --> 02:32:02,160
I don't remember how it exactly when,
but I was wasting my time.

2619
02:32:02,161 --> 02:32:04,990
I just said it was just
going and half ass in it.

2620
02:32:05,460 --> 02:32:08,310
And then three years in, they, uh,

2621
02:32:08,311 --> 02:32:10,680
I think they told me I couldn't come
back because my grades were really bad.

2622
02:32:10,681 --> 02:32:12,030
So I,
I remember I,

2623
02:32:12,660 --> 02:32:17,660
I bullshitted and wrote this
really eloquent response and uh,

2624
02:32:17,730 --> 02:32:20,820
I wrote it all out and I was going to
send it in and then I read it and I was

2625
02:32:20,821 --> 02:32:20,971
like,

2626
02:32:20,971 --> 02:32:25,971
if I put half as much effort into school
as I did the bullshitting them with

2627
02:32:26,281 --> 02:32:31,170
this really eloquent letter that I'm
writing about, oh, I want to go to school,

2628
02:32:31,171 --> 02:32:33,330
then I feel like I got to stop.
Just stop.

2629
02:32:33,720 --> 02:32:36,290
I am not going to get a fucking
normal job. I need to, I,

2630
02:32:36,510 --> 02:32:39,000
my parents are completely
disappointed in me, but it's okay.

2631
02:32:39,001 --> 02:32:43,080
I'm already out of the house, so let's
just, let's just run with this. You know,

2632
02:32:43,081 --> 02:32:46,920
they didn't want me doing anything I
ever did it. So let me just keep going.

2633
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:49,650
So the things that I'm interested in,
like back then,

2634
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:52,800
if you asked me questions about taekwondo,

2635
02:32:52,801 --> 02:32:54,240
which is what I was
obsessed with back then,

2636
02:32:54,630 --> 02:32:58,530
I would be able to tell you everything
where it started, who created it,

2637
02:32:58,620 --> 02:32:59,790
who invented this technique,

2638
02:32:59,791 --> 02:33:03,270
who was first successful
with this technique when
they changed the variability

2639
02:33:03,271 --> 02:33:06,660
of a, the how you use your hips. One.
There's one style, it does it this way.

2640
02:33:06,661 --> 02:33:08,010
Another style does die the way this is,

2641
02:33:08,011 --> 02:33:09,860
this is the benefits of this
is the benefits of that.

2642
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:13,440
And I would be able to rattle off anything
about things that I was interested in,

2643
02:33:13,441 --> 02:33:16,620
but it was,
it's like I have like a OCD,

2644
02:33:16,650 --> 02:33:18,510
like obsessive weird brain,

2645
02:33:18,930 --> 02:33:23,520
but it's not a good
brain for like lawn care.

2646
02:33:23,860 --> 02:33:26,220
Right. You know, it's not,

2647
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:31,640
it's not a good brain for remembering to
pay your bills is not a good brain for

2648
02:33:31,681 --> 02:33:33,360
like if I had a job and you know,

2649
02:33:33,361 --> 02:33:35,430
you got to show effort to
be a part of this company.

2650
02:33:35,431 --> 02:33:38,520
This company is all about cooperation.
See that board.

2651
02:33:38,670 --> 02:33:42,460
We've got our tenants that we advised
by fucking checked out. Gone. Yup.

2652
02:33:42,750 --> 02:33:43,770
Second paragraph.

2653
02:33:43,771 --> 02:33:46,980
I'm already trying to figure out how to
make a live in delivering newspapers.

2654
02:33:46,981 --> 02:33:47,940
Right.
Don't have a boss or something

2655
02:33:48,270 --> 02:33:51,410
hilarious. I was horrible in school,
man. Yeah, of course you are.

2656
02:33:51,411 --> 02:33:55,360
That's why you were funny. But I would, I
would ace all my tests without studying.

2657
02:33:55,440 --> 02:33:57,130
Huh? Just cause I, I,

2658
02:33:57,320 --> 02:34:00,910
I learned by listening and so I just
keep my mouth shut a lot of times and I

2659
02:34:00,911 --> 02:34:03,820
just absorbed that way. And then, so
I listened to lectures or whatever.

2660
02:34:03,821 --> 02:34:07,870
And then in high school you,
most of your grade is your homework,

2661
02:34:07,871 --> 02:34:11,890
but I'm like fuck the homework and I'd
come in and ace my test and just barely

2662
02:34:11,891 --> 02:34:15,460
passed with a c, you know, because
I would at least get a little bit.

2663
02:34:15,461 --> 02:34:17,980
And so then in college was,
you know, they don't care

2664
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:20,050
if you do your homework or not,
you don't get graded on that.

2665
02:34:20,051 --> 02:34:22,000
So I was like getting
great grades in college.

2666
02:34:22,810 --> 02:34:26,230
I just barely get by by just doing
the homework. We're up by the,

2667
02:34:26,231 --> 02:34:29,260
by ace and the test. You just
have a really good brain.
I mean, that's what it is.

2668
02:34:29,261 --> 02:34:31,870
Yeah. Your brain works. I slept all day.

2669
02:34:31,871 --> 02:34:35,710
I would stay up and watch the tonight
show with Jay or Johnny Carson and I'd

2670
02:34:35,711 --> 02:34:38,830
watch Letterman and then I would watch
whatever was after that and then go to

2671
02:34:38,831 --> 02:34:40,810
bed at like four in the morning,
wake up at six,

2672
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:43,210
go to school for sleeping
every single class.

2673
02:34:43,211 --> 02:34:48,040
That's why we're happy to sit down
and be like this, you know? And then,

2674
02:34:48,041 --> 02:34:52,300
uh, somehow got a seat. Yeah, just got
CS. I got C's all through high school.

2675
02:34:52,840 --> 02:34:56,980
The problem with high school is that
it's being taught by people that are not

2676
02:34:56,981 --> 02:34:59,580
making any money. No one
gives a fuck about them. They,

2677
02:34:59,600 --> 02:35:01,630
you only hear about with
them when they make mistakes.

2678
02:35:01,870 --> 02:35:04,990
Nobody's praising teachers for being
amazing and being inspirational.

2679
02:35:04,991 --> 02:35:07,630
It's so rare that teachers get any props.
They,

2680
02:35:07,670 --> 02:35:09,640
they are not financially compensated.

2681
02:35:09,760 --> 02:35:13,840
Even though they have one of the most
important roles in a child's development,

2682
02:35:14,350 --> 02:35:16,450
they're not considered significant.
Yup.

2683
02:35:16,780 --> 02:35:21,370
It's a stupid fucking thing that we've
done. We've created these really arcane,

2684
02:35:21,371 --> 02:35:24,970
shitty, ineffective systems for
education and it's rare that you get one.

2685
02:35:24,971 --> 02:35:27,280
That's great. I mean, when you
find a good school district, man,

2686
02:35:27,281 --> 02:35:29,680
people fucking sell their house.
So we moved to these neighborhoods,

2687
02:35:29,950 --> 02:35:30,401
they do whatever.

2688
02:35:30,401 --> 02:35:33,340
They can start sign their kid up right
when they're born just to get into

2689
02:35:33,370 --> 02:35:34,350
kindergarten.
Yeah.

2690
02:35:34,390 --> 02:35:37,300
Do whatever they can to get their
kid into a good school system.

2691
02:35:37,330 --> 02:35:40,180
And then the argument of like, you
know, not paying the teachers as well,

2692
02:35:40,181 --> 02:35:42,400
we don't want to pay him a lot of money
and then attract the wrong kind of

2693
02:35:42,401 --> 02:35:46,900
people. Like, are you kidding me?
Is that mean man, it so stupid.

2694
02:35:47,250 --> 02:35:50,000
It's what, it's very aggravating. Yeah.

2695
02:35:50,020 --> 02:35:53,290
Several teachers in my family is very
frustrating to see the struggles that they

2696
02:35:53,291 --> 02:35:56,830
go through and not having enough money
in the budget to buy the fricking

2697
02:35:56,831 --> 02:36:01,750
materials they need to teach the kids
the curriculum. You know, it's, and,

2698
02:36:01,780 --> 02:36:05,440
and that's not just like
centralized to that school district.

2699
02:36:05,470 --> 02:36:07,660
It is like nationwide,
you know,

2700
02:36:07,990 --> 02:36:11,920
it's gotta be fun because kids like
to play. Like here's the thing,

2701
02:36:11,980 --> 02:36:16,870
one of the things that drives me fucking
bananas is this idea that kids that are

2702
02:36:16,871 --> 02:36:21,430
bored in class have a disease.
You the, he's got, oh, Eh,

2703
02:36:21,890 --> 02:36:25,430
a d h d o c d is,

2704
02:36:25,740 --> 02:36:30,210
he's got something. He's not sitting.
You're not supposed to sit. Okay.

2705
02:36:30,211 --> 02:36:34,080
Little kids are supposed to be playing
and there have low energy. Dude,

2706
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:38,730
I have little kids and my six year old,
she's a fucking bundle of energy.

2707
02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:43,830
They literally will run around the house
screaming [inaudible] six and the four.

2708
02:36:44,070 --> 02:36:47,370
They get together and
they go and they just run.

2709
02:36:47,400 --> 02:36:49,440
It's like they have a flame inside them.

2710
02:36:49,441 --> 02:36:54,441
They need a burn off and you make a little
kid sit in a class and pay attention.

2711
02:36:54,600 --> 02:36:58,050
Pay Attention. Joshua,
Joshua up here on the board.

2712
02:36:58,051 --> 02:37:01,040
I want your eyes up here and you're like,
oh my God, I gotta get Outta here. Yeah,

2713
02:37:01,110 --> 02:37:04,860
your body's freaking out. Your body
is literally freaking out. You just,

2714
02:37:04,950 --> 02:37:07,540
you just want to get the fuck outta here.
Meanwhile,

2715
02:37:07,590 --> 02:37:09,150
you got a video game in your pocket,

2716
02:37:09,151 --> 02:37:12,710
you want to play or you got a fucking
comic book. You want to read it right?

2717
02:37:12,720 --> 02:37:17,090
Way more stimulating and
interesting in this horse shit.

2718
02:37:17,330 --> 02:37:21,740
This fucking ladies talking
to you in Spanish. We're in
America bench. Okay. Say,

2719
02:37:21,770 --> 02:37:24,260
no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to
hear it. I don't want to hear it.

2720
02:37:24,420 --> 02:37:28,760
I gotta get Outta here. And that's, that's
most kids through high school, you're,

2721
02:37:28,761 --> 02:37:33,080
you're fucking, whether it's math
or English or fucking history,

2722
02:37:33,081 --> 02:37:37,040
you don't want to be doing
that right then. And you know,

2723
02:37:37,041 --> 02:37:38,720
the idea is that they're
going to teach you discipline.

2724
02:37:38,721 --> 02:37:41,570
You're going to sit there and now
they're going to turn you into a god Damn

2725
02:37:41,570 --> 02:37:42,403
Zombie.
That's what they're gonna do.

2726
02:37:42,560 --> 02:37:46,190
They're going to turn you into a
cubicle Zombie. And if you let them,

2727
02:37:46,220 --> 02:37:50,360
they will do it. Or if you resist, you
can find your way out of the system.

2728
02:37:50,361 --> 02:37:53,030
But the idea that you're not
intelligent, unless you, you,

2729
02:37:53,060 --> 02:37:57,320
you follow this ridiculous curriculum
to turns you into a worker bee.

2730
02:37:57,700 --> 02:37:59,900
It's fucking stupid.
It's a stupid,

2731
02:37:59,901 --> 02:38:04,901
shitty plan that they've been
following for a long fucking time.

2732
02:38:05,630 --> 02:38:08,810
And it doesn't work on everybody.
You're different than me.

2733
02:38:08,930 --> 02:38:11,450
I'm different than you were
all were fucking different.

2734
02:38:11,451 --> 02:38:15,620
And every kid needs a different approach
to absorbing information and you're

2735
02:38:15,621 --> 02:38:18,050
going to have interest that I don't have.
You know,

2736
02:38:18,051 --> 02:38:19,310
like we were talking about video editing.

2737
02:38:19,730 --> 02:38:23,330
If I had to go to fucking school or I
had to become a video editor, I want,

2738
02:38:23,340 --> 02:38:26,570
I'm not interested in it. It's
not, I have no fascination.

2739
02:38:26,750 --> 02:38:29,450
Like if you had to become
a professional pool player,

2740
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:34,490
you've know fascination with it. It's
like you, we all vary in our personality,

2741
02:38:34,491 --> 02:38:39,370
in our life experiences and in what we're
attracted to and some people are going

2742
02:38:39,371 --> 02:38:40,910
to be attracted to different things.

2743
02:38:41,180 --> 02:38:45,230
I believe that children should absolutely
learn the basic building blocks.

2744
02:38:45,380 --> 02:38:48,290
Every kid should learn how to write,
learn how to read.

2745
02:38:48,470 --> 02:38:49,580
You should learn how to count.

2746
02:38:49,730 --> 02:38:53,750
You should learn about the important
facets of history. Agreed. Everyone.

2747
02:38:53,930 --> 02:38:58,460
But the idea that every fucking kid
should follow the same curriculum the same

2748
02:38:58,461 --> 02:38:58,970
way.

2749
02:38:58,970 --> 02:39:03,740
And how come nobody ever takes kids that
are fucking antsy or the crack jokes

2750
02:39:03,741 --> 02:39:06,230
all the time. Nobody ever pulls
him aside and goes, hey man,

2751
02:39:07,010 --> 02:39:09,770
should be a fucking comic. Yeah.
Like you know, you could be a comic.

2752
02:39:09,800 --> 02:39:11,870
There's thousands of
them. Yeah. Like this is,

2753
02:39:11,930 --> 02:39:14,460
we're not talking about be the president
only going to be with to pull it.

2754
02:39:14,480 --> 02:39:15,800
When I grew up,
listen bitch,

2755
02:39:15,890 --> 02:39:19,250
there's one fucking president
won 350 million people.

2756
02:39:19,251 --> 02:39:23,450
One guy gets to be president. Good luck.
That's a shitty fucking job proposition.

2757
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:25,280
Yeah,
you're your odds suck.

2758
02:39:25,610 --> 02:39:30,050
But the odds of being a comedian put
not bad. Right. You're actually funny.

2759
02:39:30,350 --> 02:39:34,370
You can, oh, you're at, listen, Johnny,
sit down. You're a fuck up. Okay.

2760
02:39:34,580 --> 02:39:38,830
Here's the good news. So it was bill
Cosby. So was Sam Kennison. That's right.

2761
02:39:38,840 --> 02:39:42,890
So it was Richard Pryor. So is Eddie
Murphy. They're all fuck ups. Okay.

2762
02:39:43,100 --> 02:39:47,180
Who the fuck ups or comics?
That's not all comics. You know,

2763
02:39:47,181 --> 02:39:49,790
I'm sure there's probably comics that
were like really studious and did great

2764
02:39:49,791 --> 02:39:53,780
and a good grades. A lot of
us were fuckups. That's right.

2765
02:39:54,530 --> 02:39:56,990
That's right. God dammit
Brian. He's right.

2766
02:39:57,620 --> 02:39:59,010
I guess

2767
02:40:05,160 --> 02:40:06,570
it's so funny how many,

2768
02:40:06,660 --> 02:40:11,230
like I always see the speeches
people put with your, uh,

2769
02:40:11,370 --> 02:40:14,910
from this podcast and like inspirational
videos and stuff like that.

2770
02:40:14,911 --> 02:40:16,860
You just had one the
other day on break.com.

2771
02:40:16,861 --> 02:40:21,210
I don't know if you know that where
they, somebody took a, you doing a, uh,

2772
02:40:21,240 --> 02:40:24,630
like kind of like a what you just did
but put it together with like the videos

2773
02:40:24,631 --> 02:40:29,340
and stuff. It's so amazing how many
people listen to those and, and uh, uh,

2774
02:40:29,400 --> 02:40:32,720
they're all over my Facebook
nowadays. Of Your, of your,

2775
02:40:33,160 --> 02:40:35,980
I hope they help. I do. I
hope they do. I don't mean it.

2776
02:40:36,040 --> 02:40:38,500
I don't do it cause I hope someone's
going to make a video out of it.

2777
02:40:38,501 --> 02:40:39,910
I do it because I'm frustrated.

2778
02:40:39,911 --> 02:40:43,120
I'm frustrated by people that I
know that are just living in hell.

2779
02:40:43,150 --> 02:40:45,430
I know too many people that just,
they,

2780
02:40:45,490 --> 02:40:49,060
there've been lied to and they don't
have anybody around them that tells them

2781
02:40:49,061 --> 02:40:51,550
any different. You don't have anybody
around them tells them this. And Man,

2782
02:40:51,770 --> 02:40:53,650
there's a lot of paths in this life.

2783
02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:55,810
There's a lot of people that
start their own businesses.

2784
02:40:55,990 --> 02:41:00,420
There's a lot of people that
sell art or you know, or, or,

2785
02:41:00,430 --> 02:41:04,480
or become landscapers or do things
that they enjoy or you know,

2786
02:41:04,481 --> 02:41:06,840
become hunting guides or become,
you know,

2787
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:08,860
someone who takes people on hiking tours.

2788
02:41:08,861 --> 02:41:12,490
It was a lot of fucking different things
to do in this life and everyone gets

2789
02:41:12,491 --> 02:41:17,491
lumped in to these same paths and they're
just shoving us in like fucking cattle

2790
02:41:17,951 --> 02:41:19,020
and to these,
these,

2791
02:41:19,090 --> 02:41:23,320
these packed in paths where everybody
wants to put that stupid hat on with the

2792
02:41:23,321 --> 02:41:24,154
tassels

2793
02:41:27,570 --> 02:41:31,960
paper that says, I'm not retarded.
It's, it's fucking crazy, man.

2794
02:41:31,961 --> 02:41:35,440
And you die just like everybody else dies.
You live and you die.

2795
02:41:35,650 --> 02:41:38,530
All you're supposed to be trying to do
is make enough money to get by and be

2796
02:41:38,531 --> 02:41:42,670
happy with what you're doing.
You're going to like different shit.

2797
02:41:43,090 --> 02:41:44,470
You're going to like different shit.

2798
02:41:44,600 --> 02:41:48,490
Yeah, it's ridiculous. I the
um, what are they called?

2799
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:49,730
The counselors or whatever.

2800
02:41:50,960 --> 02:41:53,930
The woman told me I was too stupid to
go to college and then I shouldn't think

2801
02:41:53,931 --> 02:41:56,840
about going into the military
and that's what I'm saying,

2802
02:41:56,841 --> 02:41:59,690
which pissed me off because
they're, you know, that's stupid,

2803
02:42:00,020 --> 02:42:04,160
but a military or learning a trade, that's
what they told me and I learn a trade.

2804
02:42:04,220 --> 02:42:08,780
Okay, I need to learn a trade or, well,
neither of those interests me. Fuck,

2805
02:42:08,840 --> 02:42:12,380
you should learn how to kill people.
John, you're too stupid to go to college.

2806
02:42:12,381 --> 02:42:13,820
You should go kill,
sell insurance.

2807
02:42:14,080 --> 02:42:17,020
Be out shooting strangers.
Yeah. For Uncle Sam.

2808
02:42:19,660 --> 02:42:20,800
That's what they told me,
man.

2809
02:42:20,830 --> 02:42:24,610
I had horrible conversations with
high school guidance counselors.

2810
02:42:24,910 --> 02:42:27,110
They just work day. No hope.
There's no hope you won't.

2811
02:42:27,111 --> 02:42:28,210
You don't pay attention in school.

2812
02:42:28,420 --> 02:42:32,790
Nancy [inaudible] that was her name
was killing me. Nancy Klezmer. Well,

2813
02:42:33,010 --> 02:42:37,540
tell me about it. And so blinders,
she was a large woman. She, um,

2814
02:42:37,930 --> 02:42:40,720
I dunno when you're a kid, I don't think
you really know how old people are,

2815
02:42:40,721 --> 02:42:43,460
but she was probably mid to
late forties at the time.

2816
02:42:43,480 --> 02:42:46,690
So buried right next to John Candy.
Oh my God. When she'd have fat,

2817
02:42:46,691 --> 02:42:49,600
fuck the,
in the casket,

2818
02:42:49,601 --> 02:42:54,160
they put a suitcase full of snacks with
her extra support. She, you know, yeah.

2819
02:42:54,161 --> 02:42:58,060
It's like, but she, okay. So she tells
that to me. Who else did she tell that to?

2820
02:42:58,180 --> 02:43:00,260
It's hard, you know, and it's like, I,

2821
02:43:01,090 --> 02:43:03,460
I thankfully kind of
figured it out on my own,

2822
02:43:03,461 --> 02:43:06,370
but how many people don't really figure
it out that they just take that advice

2823
02:43:06,371 --> 02:43:09,400
and go, oh shit. Well, I guess, I guess
I should go learn to be a mechanic. Look,

2824
02:43:09,401 --> 02:43:11,020
the world needs mechanics.
I get,

2825
02:43:11,230 --> 02:43:15,550
but you can't just tell someone that's
their lot in life because you know

2826
02:43:15,551 --> 02:43:17,020
they're too stupid or something.

2827
02:43:17,021 --> 02:43:19,600
I mean there's some
mechanics are very brilliant.

2828
02:43:19,601 --> 02:43:21,070
I'm sure there's some stupid ones too.

2829
02:43:21,370 --> 02:43:21,521
Yeah.

2830
02:43:21,521 --> 02:43:25,480
And there's some mechanics that wanted
to be mechanics cause they love cars.

2831
02:43:25,510 --> 02:43:26,380
They enjoy it.

2832
02:43:26,410 --> 02:43:30,160
They get the thrill out of revving the
engines and figuring out how to make

2833
02:43:30,161 --> 02:43:32,830
things run better and figuring out how to,
I like working on cars,

2834
02:43:32,831 --> 02:43:35,170
but I don't want to do that for a living.
You know,

2835
02:43:35,620 --> 02:43:37,840
this is the idea that this
woman can do that too.

2836
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:42,220
It's so disappointing that that person is,
if that was my fucking kid,

2837
02:43:42,280 --> 02:43:45,850
I would scream it. That lady,
if you came home and you know,

2838
02:43:45,851 --> 02:43:49,210
you told me that some lady told you you
are too stupid to go to college and you

2839
02:43:49,211 --> 02:43:53,890
had to be a mechanic or a
a fucking soldier, I would
scream at that lady. Yeah,

2840
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:56,320
I would want her fired. I'm
like, you fucking monster.

2841
02:43:56,590 --> 02:43:58,570
Like you know you're planting seeds.
And these kids,

2842
02:43:58,610 --> 02:44:00,820
you're telling a child they're too dumb.

2843
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:04,480
How smart are you that you got fat and
you're working as a guidance counselor?

2844
02:44:04,870 --> 02:44:08,120
You fucking dumb ass. You
Ain't thinking shit. I know

2845
02:44:08,220 --> 02:44:11,410
I, if I came home and told my
dad that he, you know, I didn't,

2846
02:44:11,411 --> 02:44:13,180
but I know if I did he'd
probably just would've been,

2847
02:44:13,420 --> 02:44:15,350
well what branch do you want to go into?
Like

2848
02:44:15,450 --> 02:44:17,620
that was your, that would have
been his response. You know,

2849
02:44:18,100 --> 02:44:20,080
that's probably why I didn't say anything.
Yeah.

2850
02:44:20,081 --> 02:44:23,500
My stepfather's thought for sure I was
going to be liquor fucking construction

2851
02:44:23,501 --> 02:44:26,340
worker or something. And then they have
a lot of faith in me. But when you,

2852
02:44:26,341 --> 02:44:30,220
you're coming home with all shit grades,
they knew I was good at drawing.

2853
02:44:30,420 --> 02:44:32,650
So like there's thoughts
that I would be an artist,

2854
02:44:32,980 --> 02:44:35,410
but then when I wasn't even into art and
once I start to get into martial arts,

2855
02:44:35,411 --> 02:44:37,720
it wasn't even an art anymore.
So this is like this,

2856
02:44:37,721 --> 02:44:42,721
this transitionary period between the
age of 15 to like 17 where there wasn't a

2857
02:44:42,821 --> 02:44:46,090
lot of shit going on in my life where
they were really worried about me.

2858
02:44:46,270 --> 02:44:48,870
Then I started winning all these
taekwondo tournament. It's now like, okay,

2859
02:44:48,880 --> 02:44:50,860
he's what? He's doing
something good, you know?

2860
02:44:50,861 --> 02:44:53,440
But even then they were worried
about that and they didn't want,

2861
02:44:53,480 --> 02:44:57,250
it was totally discouraging and they never
saw me fight. Once I probably fought,

2862
02:44:57,280 --> 02:45:01,240
I probably had a hundred amateur fights
and my parents ever saw one of them.

2863
02:45:01,560 --> 02:45:03,310
I won.
Yeah,

2864
02:45:03,870 --> 02:45:08,000
he got out of the art because you were
so good at it that at such a young age

2865
02:45:08,001 --> 02:45:10,490
that,
I mean like way better than most people.

2866
02:45:10,750 --> 02:45:13,480
I told you what happened. I had a really
shitty art teacher in high school,

2867
02:45:13,810 --> 02:45:16,680
asshole. He's just a
really angry, bitter guy.

2868
02:45:16,681 --> 02:45:20,500
He's just this pot belly dummy that
had given up on life. He was just,

2869
02:45:20,740 --> 02:45:23,380
this was this guy, this is my impression
and my art teacher in high school,

2870
02:45:25,270 --> 02:45:28,180
that's how he was.
That was his energy and he didn't like me.

2871
02:45:28,420 --> 02:45:33,100
He didn't like me because I was, I had,
I had a lot of energy. I was dynamic.

2872
02:45:33,101 --> 02:45:35,740
I wanted to just fucking
run through walls. I mean,

2873
02:45:35,741 --> 02:45:39,850
I was wired when I was a kid and
everything I would draw was like dragons,

2874
02:45:39,880 --> 02:45:43,120
eating villages and it was all like
fucking people running for their lives,

2875
02:45:43,121 --> 02:45:44,530
getting hacked to death by swords.

2876
02:45:44,890 --> 02:45:47,110
I was an angry kid and I
drew a lot of crazy shit.

2877
02:45:47,530 --> 02:45:51,580
Werewolves tearing apart rib cages, you
know. So that was what I drew, you know,

2878
02:45:51,581 --> 02:45:53,890
and he was really interested in you.
He's like, you've got to stop doing that.

2879
02:45:53,891 --> 02:45:55,810
But like this one I like,
I like that kind of stuff.

2880
02:45:56,010 --> 02:45:59,920
And I remember him saying this to me,
well, if you get a job as an illustrator,

2881
02:45:59,921 --> 02:46:03,190
you're going to perhaps have to draw
something that you don't enjoy a drawing.

2882
02:46:03,370 --> 02:46:05,680
Like maybe I'll have to do a diaper ad.
Okay,

2883
02:46:05,830 --> 02:46:09,440
so you're going to have to learn how to,
um, I remember like I'm out. That's it.

2884
02:46:09,470 --> 02:46:12,290
I'm not doing diaper ads. And
so I stopped drawing. Wow. Yeah,

2885
02:46:12,320 --> 02:46:16,160
I remember this guy was,
so, it was just so negative.

2886
02:46:16,190 --> 02:46:21,190
And influential because
enthusiasm is very influential,

2887
02:46:21,440 --> 02:46:24,930
but negativity is also influential.
And I,

2888
02:46:24,940 --> 02:46:29,940
he was connecting this world of failure
to this guy's path and I was like,

2889
02:46:30,441 --> 02:46:32,960
well I don't want to be an art teacher,
like this fucking shithead.

2890
02:46:33,140 --> 02:46:37,040
Just working with a bunch of people in
squashing their dreams because it wasn't

2891
02:46:37,041 --> 02:46:38,300
like I wasn't talented.

2892
02:46:38,480 --> 02:46:42,800
Like I still have those images and I've
put some of them up on Instagram and I

2893
02:46:42,801 --> 02:46:47,210
just should, I drew in 1983
okay. I was in high school.

2894
02:46:47,211 --> 02:46:51,110
I have some of these pictures so I know
I was talented and this guy just was a

2895
02:46:51,240 --> 02:46:53,330
douchebag and he just didn't,

2896
02:46:53,720 --> 02:46:58,720
he just gave me negative energy and so
I was very insecure and very young and

2897
02:46:59,871 --> 02:47:04,100
just dumb and you know, I
just, I just stayed away.

2898
02:47:04,101 --> 02:47:08,330
I didn't even take art my senior year in
high school and that was my whole path.

2899
02:47:08,331 --> 02:47:11,160
My whole path in life was I was going to
be a comic book illustrator, you know,

2900
02:47:11,210 --> 02:47:14,360
I was going to be like those guys
that did like the x men or you know,

2901
02:47:14,361 --> 02:47:17,470
an incredible hulk. That was my
idea. Like, I could do that like,

2902
02:47:17,540 --> 02:47:18,830
and I really could have done it,

2903
02:47:18,831 --> 02:47:23,450
but I was just so turned off by shitty
teachers just can't squash kids.

2904
02:47:23,630 --> 02:47:27,530
It's terrible. You can't do it. It's the
worst thing ever, man. And it's so common.

2905
02:47:27,620 --> 02:47:31,790
It's so common. Happens all the time.
It's Ari Shaffir has a joke about it.

2906
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:34,910
He's got a joke about a, it's a
new, one of his new bits about, uh,

2907
02:47:35,050 --> 02:47:39,880
the notorious B I g you know,
when a biggie was young, like he,

2908
02:47:39,881 --> 02:47:40,570
he had uh,

2909
02:47:40,570 --> 02:47:43,400
this rap to all the teachers have told
me that you're going to grow up to be

2910
02:47:43,401 --> 02:47:44,234
shit.
You know,

2911
02:47:44,360 --> 02:47:46,850
I don't want to say any more because it's
a really funny joke and I want to give

2912
02:47:46,851 --> 02:47:48,080
any of the,
the joke away,

2913
02:47:48,350 --> 02:47:52,760
but he has this whole bit about these
teachers telling him that he wasn't going

2914
02:47:52,761 --> 02:47:56,540
to be shit right. That notorious
B I g was wasn't going to be shit.

2915
02:47:58,070 --> 02:48:00,430
It's ridiculous.
It's fucking common man.

2916
02:48:00,431 --> 02:48:02,420
Cause people don't have
vision and they don't have,

2917
02:48:02,930 --> 02:48:06,200
how could we have known Josh McDermitt
and that one day in Phoenix that you

2918
02:48:06,201 --> 02:48:09,430
would grow up to be the man who's on
my favorite show? How can we ever,

2919
02:48:09,500 --> 02:48:12,700
my second favorite show, I'm going to be
honest with you at the game number one,

2920
02:48:12,740 --> 02:48:17,720
but you guys are so strong, it's like one
a and one B. It's like right up there,

2921
02:48:17,870 --> 02:48:18,740
man.
The,

2922
02:48:19,130 --> 02:48:22,220
I've talked to a couple of their actors
and they're fans of our show just as

2923
02:48:22,221 --> 02:48:26,410
much as we're faced with. So like, you
know, good for you. Okay. It's okay man.

2924
02:48:26,420 --> 02:48:28,520
Like you're on one of the best shows ever.
In my opinion.

2925
02:48:28,521 --> 02:48:31,520
If it's a top 10 of my favorite
shows of all time, you're on it.

2926
02:48:31,700 --> 02:48:34,880
Who could have ever predicted that?
Top Five. Okay. What do you got?

2927
02:48:34,940 --> 02:48:37,000
Top five a surprise.

2928
02:48:37,080 --> 02:48:41,630
I'm not going to make your name 10
soprano's game of Thrones walking dead.

2929
02:48:42,650 --> 02:48:47,510
Dexter. First season stopper.
Southpark always. Yeah. What else?

2930
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:54,170
Hmm? I'd have to go back. I was a,
if I was five. Yeah, that was five.

2931
02:48:54,230 --> 02:48:54,921
I'd have to go.

2932
02:48:54,921 --> 02:48:59,780
I have to go back through my entire
viewing history and think, Shit, oh,

2933
02:48:59,781 --> 02:49:03,080
homeland is pretty Gundam good.
Even that,

2934
02:49:03,140 --> 02:49:07,230
even that show took a dip. I think
it's pretty good. Uh, I don't remember.

2935
02:49:07,350 --> 02:49:08,190
I don't know what season

2936
02:49:08,190 --> 02:49:11,720
we're in now, but as I watched it all
on Amazon, so I don't know, last season,

2937
02:49:11,910 --> 02:49:14,940
the last season is not as good.
I don't know. I'm not current,

2938
02:49:14,970 --> 02:49:17,620
but dare you've watched like two
or three seasons. But I feel like,

2939
02:49:18,510 --> 02:49:20,910
like part of the second
season I'm going like,

2940
02:49:20,940 --> 02:49:25,080
I don't care what's going on.
Like I care about Saul,

2941
02:49:25,860 --> 02:49:30,390
but I don't care about Harry
Carey and bitch and uh, Brody.

2942
02:49:30,570 --> 02:49:35,310
But she fucks like a wild animal.
It was crazy ones. You know,

2943
02:49:35,940 --> 02:49:39,450
the crazy ones, they know how
to throw. Yeah, they trick you.

2944
02:49:40,260 --> 02:49:44,670
That's a good show though. It's not
as good as walking dead and it's not.

2945
02:49:44,671 --> 02:49:49,230
It's definitely not as good. Well,
it's good. It's great in moments,

2946
02:49:49,231 --> 02:49:52,530
in moments, it's fantastic.
But I call shows, man,

2947
02:49:52,531 --> 02:49:55,110
it's fucking hard keeping this show.

2948
02:49:55,500 --> 02:49:59,940
So solid episode after episode,
season after season,

2949
02:49:59,941 --> 02:50:04,020
it's gotta be one of the most difficult
things to do. It's tough. I like lost.

2950
02:50:04,320 --> 02:50:07,950
Like I remember, um, like the last
season of loss, I was totally done.

2951
02:50:07,980 --> 02:50:12,600
I was so done. I didn't even watch the
final episode. Yeah. I was like, fuck you.

2952
02:50:13,050 --> 02:50:16,740
I checked out. I was angry at it. That's
what I did with Dexter the last episode.

2953
02:50:16,741 --> 02:50:19,260
I didn't watch until recently,
uh,

2954
02:50:19,320 --> 02:50:23,430
watch the whole series and didn't
watch the last episode. I hurt so bad.

2955
02:50:23,820 --> 02:50:27,480
It ended better than you would imagine.
Uh,

2956
02:50:27,570 --> 02:50:32,490
but lost if you really real watch lost
and pay attention to what, you know,

2957
02:50:32,491 --> 02:50:35,460
you're supposed to pay attention to him,
it really changes the show.

2958
02:50:35,461 --> 02:50:39,360
It really makes it a lot better. Yeah.
That make, that kind of makes sense.

2959
02:50:39,361 --> 02:50:41,510
Just read something online
about one of the, uh,

2960
02:50:41,580 --> 02:50:46,500
one of the writers was at a dinner party
and they were talking to him about like

2961
02:50:46,501 --> 02:50:50,340
all the crazy shit that was inserted into
the show, the polar bears or whatever.

2962
02:50:50,340 --> 02:50:54,570
Like there's so many things that didn't
tie up at the end and he said, yeah,

2963
02:50:54,571 --> 02:50:57,600
we never had any intention of that
was just a can choose to define it.

2964
02:50:57,601 --> 02:51:01,020
It was just thrown literally throwing
in whatever. It's freaking me.

2965
02:51:01,021 --> 02:51:05,340
Blow out smoke monsters and shit. I
love that. I absolutely loved that.

2966
02:51:05,370 --> 02:51:07,110
There were some great
moments in that show.

2967
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:10,560
There were some great moments in that
show, but it was rapidly inconsistent.

2968
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:14,580
As was Dexter like Dexter, first
season, no one. Dexter went downhill.

2969
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:18,000
It went downhill when that
dude stop lifting weights
because the first season he

2970
02:51:18,001 --> 02:51:18,840
looked like a killer.

2971
02:51:18,900 --> 02:51:22,110
He looked like a guy could grab people
and strangle them and beat their asses

2972
02:51:22,111 --> 02:51:24,270
and stab and then they
started getting like scrawny.

2973
02:51:24,440 --> 02:51:27,840
Was that cause cancer though?
Whatever. Excuses, excuses,

2974
02:51:31,050 --> 02:51:33,390
leukemia. Walk it up. Pussy.

2975
02:51:36,210 --> 02:51:38,640
I don't mean this. Ladies
and gentlemen. All right,

2976
02:51:38,730 --> 02:51:40,770
we should probably wrap this bitch up.
I think I ran at of time.

2977
02:51:41,160 --> 02:51:45,270
Josh motherfucking, mic dot. Dude.
Thanks for having me on. Thanks for,

2978
02:51:45,330 --> 02:51:47,970
thanks for being on and don't quit comedy.
You're too fucking funny.

2979
02:51:48,010 --> 02:51:50,030
Not quitting and I know it showed a nosy.

2980
02:51:50,050 --> 02:51:53,770
Got a nice cushy Gig on the walking dead.
You've got to show tonight.

2981
02:51:53,820 --> 02:51:56,340
Where can people see you doc?
I'm not promoting it.

2982
02:51:56,341 --> 02:52:01,200
I mean I don't know where it is. It's in
Long Beach, Long Beach. Just Google it.

2983
02:52:01,201 --> 02:52:04,290
You'll find them. It's probably at
the laugh factory in Long Beach.

2984
02:52:04,291 --> 02:52:05,980
Is that where it is or isn't?
It's not that.

2985
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:10,100
It's like a one night show. So some
Weirdo spot. All right, my friend, uh,

2986
02:52:10,120 --> 02:52:14,540
you could follow Josh and
I found it on roadmaps. Ah,

2987
02:52:15,340 --> 02:52:17,470
you can follow Josh onto twitch.

2988
02:52:17,530 --> 02:52:20,680
Sure it is Josh McDermitt.

2989
02:52:20,890 --> 02:52:25,690
D. E. R. M. I. T. T. O. Yeah. Uh, and uh,

2990
02:52:25,720 --> 02:52:30,320
do you have a website? Uh, I
do. Josh mcdermitt.com. Oh, Sam,

2991
02:52:30,370 --> 02:52:31,510
