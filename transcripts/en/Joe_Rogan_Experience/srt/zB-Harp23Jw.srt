1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,780
The joe rogan experience cause
kevin pereira just signed up for it.

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:05,100
Like that night at midnight,

3
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:10,101
he was on the computer signing up for
Obamacare and I think he pays like $200 a

4
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:14,640
month or $300 a month for like really
fucking awesome insurance because of it

5
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,330
now.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:15,871
But uh,

7
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:17,580
it doesn't start until January,

8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,340
I guess you have to sign up for nurses.

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,700
This is the sign up period.

10
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:21,960
They're trying to get everybody,

11
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:25,650
but like there's all these ads on TV
telling you that it's bad and that you

12
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:26,730
shouldn't sign up for it.

13
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,840
They have ads that try to encourage young
people to not sign up for it because

14
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:31,674
they have,

15
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,480
uh,

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,840
a young woman is sitting in like a
gynecologist office with her feet in the

17
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:40,770
stirrups and then the
gynecologist has a giant ugly,

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,550
uh,

19
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,570
Uncle Sam,

20
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,010
a paper say Uncle Sam head that rises up
and it's like looming over her vagina.

21
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,790
Like trying to tell young people,

22
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,860
don't sign up for Obamacare
because then they're gone.

23
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,410
Then the government's going to tell
you what you can do with your vagina.

24
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,640
What was the true,

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,230
it was the government has a vagina agenda.

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,980
Well the thing is is they
argue that Republicans do are,

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,953
are,

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,291
you know,

29
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,760
do have a vagina agenda.

30
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,773
But it's not too,

31
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,000
it's so weird that they've,

32
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,950
they basically have
just flipped the script.

33
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,270
Like it's supposed to be that,

34
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:12,810
you know,

35
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,061
uh,

36
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:15,540
the Republicans are anti woman,

37
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,720
but they're trying to make it look like
Obama's w really the one that wants to

38
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:19,320
tell you when,

39
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,000
what you could do with your vagina.

40
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,530
So it's just a manipulative,

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,450
it's about healthcare period.

42
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,730
So they use it to like sexual health care.

43
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,020
They go to that right away.

44
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:28,831
Babies,

45
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:29,700
Vagina.

46
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,870
Your wife's poss.

47
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,411
Yeah.

48
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:33,150
Well cause that's what the
Democrats had been using.

49
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,160
They've been saying the
Republicans are anti woman,

50
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:35,551
so this,

51
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:37,680
so they're just using the
same approach but saying,

52
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,760
but putting it on Obamacare
and Obamacare has anti woman,

53
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,950
it's really fascinating that
they're allowed to do that.

54
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,811
It's really fascinated.

55
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:49,170
They're allowed to editorialize at all
and that they're allowed to have like any

56
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:52,290
sort of dramatic influence
at all and their commercials.

57
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,730
It's so crazy.

58
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:56,040
Like you're allowing people to manipulate.

59
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,120
You know,

60
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,970
Doug Benson has shown time and time again.

61
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,760
He doesn't care about the
people of Los Angeles.

62
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,800
Doug Benson promotes smoking
marijuana for underage children,

63
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,320
including your chilled trend.

64
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,380
Doug Benson is not a good American.

65
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:13,980
In fact,

66
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,460
he would live in Canada if
it wasn't so fucking cold.

67
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,370
Doug Pencil president,

68
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,410
but they almost can say that man,

69
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,300
they can think they're so dramatic.

70
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:29,820
It's not facts like very clear,

71
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:30,301
simple,

72
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:33,450
vetted facts that have been verified
on both sides and agreed to,

73
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:33,770
no,

74
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:33,911
no,

75
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:34,061
no,

76
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:34,141
no,

77
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:35,850
no nonsense,

78
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,230
hyperbole,

79
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,250
drama,

80
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,170
dramatic writing,

81
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:41,190
fucking manipulation,

82
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:41,641
the truth,

83
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:43,950
all that standard fare and oh by the way,

84
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,440
we've been paid for by giant corporations.

85
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,120
It's a language.

86
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,330
They had an amazing spirit experiment
in this book where Major League baseball

87
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:51,810
players,

88
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,550
almost all of them are off the charts.

89
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,090
Visually,

90
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,560
they have 2010 2017 vision.

91
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,020
There's almost no really
great hitters there.

92
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,980
Don't think there are any

93
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,390
who have even 2020 vision.

94
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:05,650
They almost all without a doubt have
vision that is off the charts there in the

95
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,280
1.1% I'm talking about
all major league hitters,

96
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,150
uh,

97
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,381
and,

98
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:12,280
and the book is very
eloquent and about this.

99
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,310
And so they took Albert Poo hosts and who
and Alex Rodriguez and some incredible

100
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,363
hitters,

101
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,290
like the best of all
time of their generation.

102
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
And they had um,

103
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,730
and one of the things they found is
that when a baseball comes at you at 95

104
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:26,140
miles an hour from 60 feet away,

105
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,700
you have to guess where it's going.

106
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:28,480
You're not going to see it.

107
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,200
The human eye cannot register in time
to actually see and hit the ball.

108
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,730
So what great hitters do is they're able
to actually see the seams on the ball.

109
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,380
They're able to see the seams on the ball.

110
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,450
And so years and years of how those
scenes are rolling and how that pitcher

111
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:44,320
throws the ball,

112
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,400
they're able,

113
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,780
if they're very good,

114
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,920
if they're very good,

115
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,980
30% of the time they are able to predict
and start swinging basically when he

116
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,690
lets go of the ball.

117
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,500
So that's where,

118
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,150
why curve balls and shit work.

119
00:03:58,151 --> 00:03:58,751
Yes.

120
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:01,480
Because they can change where the
ball's going to be changed direction.

121
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:05,260
But also the way you hit a curve
off you're really great is you've,

122
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,570
you can see the way
these guys can literally,

123
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:11,170
cause they have such good eyes can see
the pattern of the red strings coming at

124
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:12,310
you at 95 miles an hour.

125
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,820
They can chunk all that information
quickly enough and start swinging low as

126
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:17,140
opposed to hi and connect.

127
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,340
So you have to guess.

128
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,770
Now they take the greatest hitters in
major league baseball and they take how

129
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:26,410
female Olympic softball
pitcher who pitches underhand.

130
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,570
Now the distance is about 40 feet,

131
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,830
a little bit more than 40 feet.

132
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,980
The ball's coming over at
about 60 miles an hour,

133
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,070
not 95 miles an hour.

134
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,790
And she pitches underhand.

135
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,650
Now these are the best pitchers and they
hit a much smaller ball at 95 miles an

136
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:39,460
hour.

137
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,460
She struck out every single picture
over and over and over again.

138
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,481
Because guess what?

139
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:47,201
There are novices,

140
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,030
cause you know why they couldn't guess.

141
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,740
They were looking at
a very different ball.

142
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,820
They didn't have the strings and
she was pitching underhand so they,

143
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:57,400
there was no way for
them to predict anything.

144
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,520
They were swinging blind and
they were as bad as you and I.

145
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,043
How about that?

146
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,630
That's amazing.

147
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,870
So the more you learn,

148
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,561
the more we learn.

149
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:08,050
Not only about you have to
have a certain hardware.

150
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:10,570
We know as an athlete you
are never going to be,

151
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:13,270
you and I are never going to be sprinters.

152
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,651
Sorry.

153
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:15,484
Shit.

154
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,740
The coverage from they learned from Ross
Perot tell you what Ross Perot through

155
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,130
Daca and billion dollar monkey wrenching
and they're fucking plans and folks who

156
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:25,890
were young and full of life.

157
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,570
You don't remember Ross Perot.

158
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,760
Ross Perot cost towards
Bush's second term.

159
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,121
Yeah.

160
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,140
Ross Perot was a bad motherfucker.

161
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,993
That's why Clinton won.

162
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,380
He came around,

163
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,180
Ross Perot came around and all of the
sudden there was this billionaire dude

164
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:41,580
explaining how the government works,

165
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,770
explaining the federal debt,

166
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,510
explaining the the f the Federal Bank
explaining taxes and you're like,

167
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:48,931
wait,

168
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,220
what the fuck is going on?

169
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:50,791
He took time,

170
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,441
time on,

171
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:52,980
on network television.

172
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,600
That's what's so gangster about him.

173
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:55,980
Cause he was before the Internet.

174
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,370
This was not going when
everybody was online.

175
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,020
This was like early nineties yeah.

176
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,021
You know what was there?

177
00:06:01,021 --> 00:06:03,900
I remember here was it the
Clinton election was 92 right?

178
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:04,310
Yeah.

179
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:04,461
Yeah.

180
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:05,900
92 yeah man.

181
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:09,410
I remember my friend John was like
helping with his campaign ever helps them.

182
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:09,740
Anyways,

183
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,211
campaign.

184
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:10,491
He's like,

185
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:13,610
this motherfucker's going to get rid of
all the crooks who was so excited about

186
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:13,960
them.

187
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,120
Yeah.

188
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,970
People were excited about Ross Perot
was like the original Ron Paul.

189
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,810
Right.

190
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,350
But Ross Perot was way more
gangster cause he had all that cash.

191
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:21,481
Yeah,

192
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:21,980
the money.

193
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,230
And he had a way of talking and saying,

194
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:23,520
yeah,

195
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,290
here's the problem.

196
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:24,770
Okay.

197
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,370
The crazy old ball fuck from down
in Texas can tell she that was,

198
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,103
yeah,

199
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,640
that was a real interesting thing.

200
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,360
So from there they changed the commission
for presidential debates or whatever

201
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:35,840
they call it,

202
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,820
which is a privately funded institution.

203
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,090
You know this corporations back it.

204
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,690
It's not,

205
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,190
it's not like it's a government
program so they can decide who gets it.

206
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:46,024
Debate who doesn't.

207
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,090
There's a Ross.

208
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,210
What's crazy is because we have

209
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,750
I process in Washington where
after you have Sarah for a while,

210
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:54,170
you can't,

211
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,120
she hadn't become a foreign
lobbyists make $30,000 a month.

212
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,291
Then take a leave,

213
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,940
work on presidential campaigns,

214
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,250
make sure you got good contacts
and then go back out there.

215
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,280
If you just want to get
down to brass tacks,

216
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,170
first thing you ought to
do is get all these folks,

217
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:10,110
they've got these one way trade agreements
that we've negotiated over the air.

218
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,090
It's like tell us will take the same deal
we gave you and they'll gridlock right

219
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:17,250
at that point because for example,

220
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,180
we've got international competitors who
simply could not unload their cars off

221
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:23,850
the ships if they had to comply.

222
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,440
You say if it was a two way street,

223
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,753
just couldn't do it.

224
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,390
We have got to stop sending jobs overseas.

225
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,430
Probably give you in the
audience your business paper.

226
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,590
Otherwise you'd be
occupying China right now,

227
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,690
$14 an hour for factory workers and you
can move your factor south the border.

228
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,051
Hey,

229
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:43,280
a dollar an hour for labor.

230
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:44,770
How are young 25 that's the same.

231
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:46,100
You've been in business for a long time.

232
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:47,160
You've got a mature workforce,

233
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,130
pay a dollar an hour for your library,

234
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,380
have no healthcare,

235
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,000
that's the most expensive single element.

236
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,873
Making a car,

237
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,730
have no environmental controls,

238
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:58,370
no pollution controls and no retirement.

239
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,240
And you don't care about
anything but making money.

240
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,270
There will be a jab
sucking sound going south.

241
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,860
So we,

242
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,280
if,

243
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,170
if the people send me to Washington,

244
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:09,691
the first thing,

245
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:12,770
how do I study that 2000
page agreement and make sure

246
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,250
I have one last point here.

247
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:17,370
I've called out undecided.

248
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,740
I was dumb and didn't understand it.

249
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:21,890
So I called a WHO's who of the folks
who've been around it and I said,

250
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:23,120
why won't everybody go south?

251
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,130
They say it will be disruptive.

252
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,441
I said,

253
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:25,011
for how long?

254
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:27,590
I finally got them up for
probably 15 years and I said,

255
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:27,681
well,

256
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,090
how does it stop being disruptive?

257
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,990
And that is when their jobs come up from
a dollar now or $6 an hour and hours go

258
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:34,250
down to $6 an hour,

259
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,360
then it's leveled again.

260
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:36,260
But in the meantime,

261
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,390
you've wrecked the country
where these kinds of deals,

262
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,280
holy shit.

263
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,070
Got to cut it out.

264
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,431
Thank you,

265
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:40,770
Mr. Right?

266
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,000
Holy Shit.

267
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,770
Ross Perot was calling shit
in 1992 he was a gangster.

268
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,760
I mean,

269
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,200
how correct was that though?

270
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,260
You're a fucking human being.
