1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,410
Five,
four,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,140
three,
two.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,430
Yes.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,680
Hello Hannibal.
What's up man?

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,070
How are you sir?
I'm good.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,600
Good to see you.
Good to see you too.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,160
You have notes?
Yeah.

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,270
I don't know.
So I just wanted to be prepared.

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,460
I had,
I've had notes other times but I just

10
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:26,090
didn't have them written down.
You know what all you had to like get in

11
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:28,220
your head.
I had him in my head but I'm an older

12
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:28,870
man now.

13
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,870
Do you mind starting to slip away?
Mine started to slip away so I had some

14
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,910
notes and drink it.
Alpha brain.

15
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,350
And you've got notes.
Yeah.

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,273
Dude,
you're ready.

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,280
What's her notes?
What do you want to talk about?

18
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:42,450
What's going on?
Oh,

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,000
we don't have to get right into it.

20
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,320
Naturally.
It was just more for like,

21
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:52,290
you know,
sometimes if stuff leg or something or

22
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,420
if I feel like I don't have something
right.

23
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,690
And then a peak at it real quick.
Oh,

24
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,400
okay.
Right now we fresh.

25
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,463
Oh,
we're fresh.

26
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,880
Good to see you too,
man.

27
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,390
Yeah.
Sorry about Monday.

28
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,280
Oh no worries man.
Shit happens.

29
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,440
I just did not.
I was still in New York.

30
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:14,441
I just had booked my flight in the
morning and I just could not go.

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,080
You just couldn't do.
It was just too tired.

32
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,630
I was,
it wasn't just a tidy,

33
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,200
was just more of a.
just didn't feel like going.

34
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:27,050
He was just a like to to.
It was the five hour thing and I did it

35
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:27,741
today.
Actually.

36
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:30,890
I flew in today,
but it was just that sometimes you just

37
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,950
don't want to do it.
It was just that flight.

38
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:33,784
I was like,
oh,

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,650
I don't know if that's the beautiful
thing about being a young,

40
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:39,740
successful single man.
You can do whatever the fuck you want to

41
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:41,660
do.
It was A.

42
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

43
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,520
But I'm uh,
excited to be back where it got weird

44
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:47,354
last time.

45
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,660
Oh,
here.

46
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,900
Yeah.
Last time.

47
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,220
Was the Sam Harris One,
right?

48
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,240
That's,
that's been a year.

49
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,340
Oh yeah,
that's right.

50
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:57,180
Yeah.
That did get a little weird alcohol.

51
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,830
Alcohol is a motherfucker.
It's amazing.

52
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:00,664
It's legal.

53
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,520
It is,
it's amazing.

54
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:03,270
It's like,
what else?

55
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,340
It was just A.
Yeah,

56
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:07,740
I should have.
I should've went to the comedy store

57
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,700
was.
I still did do,

58
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,460
yeah.
Did a terrible set dj.

59
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,810
Well,
we got trouble set.

60
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,680
We did a podcast.
I got drunk.

61
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:21,860
And then you hung around for the second
podcast.

62
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,810
Yeah.
You said sit in,

63
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,750
sit in.
It was Sam Harrison.

64
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:27,584
Who else was it?

65
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,730
It was,
uh,

66
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,950
the guy whose podcast it is.

67
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,370
Oh,
Josh Zap.

68
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,100
Zap,
Zap.

69
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,220
He fucking loved it.
Of course it got crazy.

70
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:38,090
But yeah,
he loved the controversy,

71
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,540
but you could see it was kind of gross
even though I love Josh.

72
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,680
You could see it while I was going on.
They loved it.

73
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,481
Yes,
yes,

74
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:44,590
yes,
yes.

75
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,790
He was.
Yeah.

76
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,190
He enjoyed it when you were teasing it
out too,

77
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,910
because I started getting messages.
What is this crazy Hannibal?

78
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,313
Sam Harris.

79
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,670
So I'm like,
what the fuck is going on?

80
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,980
Because I knew once I left I was like,
yeah,

81
00:02:56,981 --> 00:02:59,290
that's going to be some weird shit in.
And I was fine it.

82
00:02:59,740 --> 00:02:59,980
But then

83
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,270
I kept on getting messages,
like,

84
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:03,100
what is this?
When is that coming out?

85
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,720
And everybody saw it live,
didn't they?

86
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,550
No,
they didn't.

87
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,710
It was not a.
right,

88
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,110
because it was Josh Zaps podcast wasn't
mine.

89
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,600
Oh,
that's right.

90
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,030
Yeah,
Fun Times.

91
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,200
Fun Time.
Last time steps was here.

92
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,690
He was talking about killing babies.
Remember that?

93
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,450
Yeah.
It was talking about like maybe she'll

94
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,670
be able to board a baby six months after
it's born.

95
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,390
I was like,
what the fuck are you talking about man?

96
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,380
You.
Did he have notes?

97
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,020
No,
no,

98
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,890
no.
See that's what he hasn't prepared.

99
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,180
You don't have no notes.
She was like,

100
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,960
yeah,
let's kill alive babies.

101
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,270
Let's talk about it.
Gay dudes feel very differently about

102
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:40,150
babies.
Like they can't make them as long as

103
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:42,850
they're doing only gay things.
There's no babies being made.

104
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:46,060
So like,
so detached from the idea of a baby.

105
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,190
Did you think that
Taylor?

106
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
I don't know.
I'm just telling you that shit.

107
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,940
Did he have strong points?
No.

108
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,370
Straight up.
Killed a baby who's just being

109
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:01,640
controversial.
Okay.

110
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,530
No,
he,

111
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,510
I think he enjoys controversy.
Yeah.

112
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,540
Yeah.
Click Bait.

113
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,960
Hey,
if you're not a comedian,

114
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,840
that's a good way to get attention.
Clickbait.

115
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,840
What else do you have?
You know,

116
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,270
I mean,
everybody can have a good point,

117
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,530
right?
You know,

118
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,420
like can you yell about it?
Well,

119
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:17,290
if.
Yeah,

120
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,570
can you make a meme about it?
I mean we're,

121
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,830
we're our whole society,
like our news runs on click bait now.

122
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,590
It's getting more and more slippery.
You know,

123
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,020
me and my friends would call everything
fake news now.

124
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,420
Call each other fake news like,
yeah,

125
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,260
I'm going back and forth with the Ra and
Bert and Thompson girl because they

126
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:39,940
wrote some article about Bert Kreischer
and Bert is gonna swear off of Booze for

127
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:40,870
90 days?

128
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,270
Yeah,
this is the new bed.

129
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:46,910
He's going to run a marathon and swear
off booze for 90 days with.

130
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,460
Okay.
I don't believe it.

131
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,440
Where's he at now?
Has He started yet?

132
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,630
He gets drunk every day.
That's what the point.

133
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,750
You're going to die like amy winehouse.
That's how amy winehouse died.

134
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,483
Yeah,
that's what I said,

135
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,540
man,
that's rough.

136
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,860
You can't.
You gotta be like,

137
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,280
no,
you got to be honest with your friends.

138
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,050
Like going to die.
Like amy winehouse can just go cold

139
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:06,790
Turkey.
I told them to lay off.

140
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,590
I go,
you've got to wean off the booze.

141
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,630
No.
Heroine,

142
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,760
heroin.
You die like that.

143
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,061
No,
no,

144
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:11,351
no,
no,

145
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:12,184
no,
no.

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,650
You just get the shakes and you feel
like shit,

147
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,150
but heroin,
you could live.

148
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,130
Booze is one of the rare drugs that will
kill you if you drop it cold Turkey if

149
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:22,000
you're an alcoholic.

150
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,000
But do you think.
I think there's a difference between

151
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,040
heavy drinker.
Oh yeah.

152
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,831
Alcohol.
Oh,

153
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:30,400
well,
yeah.

154
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,610
Casual Boozer,
you know,

155
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,930
like if you booze,
like maybe if you have like two or three

156
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:37,180
drinks at night and then quit cold
Turkey will be fine.

157
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,310
But if you're one of those all day
drinkers.

158
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,930
Yeah.
And then you quit cold Turkey,

159
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,510
you will die.
It's very common.

160
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,360
It's a,
it's one of the more common drugs that

161
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:47,410
you die.
I think there's,

162
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:50,800
um,
there's a like Benzos,

163
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,610
those,
those will kill you from withdrawal.

164
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,070
There's a few different pharmaceuticals.
It'll kill you from withdrawal,

165
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,660
but I don't believe heroines on that
list.

166
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:03,320
I think it's very rare that people die
from heroin withdrawal or they get

167
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,154
really sick.

168
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,350
You know,
Carl Hart is Dr Carl Hart,

169
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,480
the famous doctor who is trust all
doctors with just two syllables in it.

170
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:14,070
Full name.

171
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,210
Well,
he's got dreadlocks.

172
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:16,560
He trusted me more.
It's cool.

173
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,820
Um,
but he,

174
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:19,470
uh,
he's a very,

175
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,600
very interesting doctor because he talks
about like drug use and drug with.

176
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,890
He's like,
for first of all,

177
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:27,230
one of the things that he points out,
it was like,

178
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,370
oh,
let's talk about a drug free society.

179
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:30,930
It's like there's never been one.
He goes,

180
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:32,640
there's never been one.
There's never been a drug for you and

181
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:35,910
you don't normally want it.
He goes when it comes to whether it's

182
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:38,610
caffeine or alcohol and then
pharmaceutical drugs,

183
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:40,440
things that help people.
He's like,

184
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,940
we have this.
We decided to demonize certain drugs and

185
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,450
he's like,
the drugs you've got to be worried about

186
00:06:45,451 --> 00:06:49,710
like alcohol's ones carries once because
if you quit cold Turkey,

187
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,230
if you're a hardcore drinker and you
drink and all the time

188
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,540
you'll fucking die.
Look baby cough syrup to wean yourself

189
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:01,650
off or something like that.
I don't think it helps.

190
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,110
I don't think it activates the same part
of your brain.

191
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,380
You know,
I was talking to a photographer,

192
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,260
I was at this festival this weekend and
she had a,

193
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,830
uh,
a film camera,

194
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:15,340
you know,
do you develop your fifth?

195
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,021
She's,
oh no,

196
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:20,610
you can only develop black and white
because if you develop your color

197
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,140
pitches,
the fumes,

198
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,740
well it'll knock you right out.
And so I said,

199
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:28,620
so just a little bit of that would be a
great time.

200
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,110
It's a small,
so just get a little bit of that and you

201
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:35,580
can just huffing paint.
Yeah,

202
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:40,581
you can do a Goddamn job interview it.
Maybe just a little bit of touch,

203
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,260
just like crack a vial in front of Mike,
grow dose of a little bit of that.

204
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,210
Have you ever tried poppers?
Poppers are those little things where if

205
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,100
they crack and they sniff it.
Emile nitrate to thing it's called.

206
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,560
No,
I did whip us in college.

207
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,170
Oh yeah,
I did that when I worked at a creamery.

208
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,780
I worked at Newport creamery.
It was like a ice cream place and they

209
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:05,190
had a there.
The ice cream was a big vats that what

210
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:08,640
is the gas?
Nitrous oxide oxide,

211
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:08,941
right?
Yeah,

212
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:09,774
that's what it is.
Yeah.

213
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,591
And we would,
uh,

214
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:14,070
we would do
like socks off of it.

215
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,810
That kills a lot of brands.
That kills a lot of brands.

216
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,410
I remember I did one weekend in college
and then I think I did it on a Friday

217
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:25,400
night and on the Sunday I was just
walking on.

218
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,140
I don't know if I was forced into Yale
just because I was trying to justify how

219
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:34,860
I felt or if it was a natural yell,
but yelling was happening.

220
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,000
Wow.
Yeah,

221
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,040
and you couldn't help it.
I don't know,

222
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,410
something you ever just tweak out by
yourself.

223
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:43,180
Just you ever.
You never did.

224
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,650
You absolutely do.
After like a crazy workout

225
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,990
after work,
I'm usually spent a week out do

226
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,030
Carter at the

227
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,600
way in.
Was just tweaking out,

228
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:59,620
but it was for show.
So tell you,

229
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:04,410
put a show for yourself.
Change your state of mind just by

230
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,191
yourself.
Yeah.

231
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:06,430
Like people say,
if you smile,

232
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,890
change your mind.
Right?

233
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,230
It will change the way your brain
actually feels.

234
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,610
Well,
if you freak out,

235
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:12,690
it probably does that too,
right?

236
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,933
Yeah,
yeah,

237
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,600
definitely.
There's ways to do it.

238
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,940
I mean why wildwood Indians,
native Americans,

239
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:19,920
when they would do those,
those battle cries.

240
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,230
Why else are they doing that?
Getting fired up?

241
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,840
You get hyped up by yelling or singing a
song.

242
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,380
Viking.
Is that a New Zealand New Zealand,

243
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:32,094
isn't it?
Yeah.

244
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:32,911
Yeah.
Where they,

245
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:36,000
uh,
they will play this video of them

246
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:39,330
playing the USA team.
Oh yeah.

247
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,220
And they're doing this elaborate thing
they're doing.

248
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:48,510
It's very elaborate and just energetic
and they cut to the USA team and they're

249
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,130
kind of looking back,
Kinda just con.

250
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,510
Not Confused,
but just what's going on.

251
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,640
And they went through this whole thing.
Is this right here?

252
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:57,350
Yeah.

253
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,420
And they didn't a basketball game.
Basketball,

254
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,090
some volume.
This is ridiculous.

255
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,510
Basketball
and

256
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,160
dusted by 45 points.
You're playing NBA superstars.

257
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:15,820
You fucked the dummies,
but it's just for the culture.

258
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,560
That's what they do all the time.
But it's.

259
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,900
But it's just,
it seems so stupid.

260
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,990
It seems stupid if you.
Have you played basketball and stupid?

261
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,370
No,
I think if you.

262
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,290
It's a performance art,

263
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,520
like the,
the other players clapped.

264
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,610
Clapped like good,
good job.

265
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:39,830
Children.
And then that game.

266
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:42,590
What was the final score that game?
One hundred million to zero.

267
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,910
Is that what it was weird.
If you do all of that and then you're

268
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,780
asking kit kid,
that's,

269
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,910
that is one of the most unfair things
every day like nba superstars play in

270
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:55,880
the Olympics.
That is so fucked up.

271
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,940
It was in our country country,
but it's so fucked up.

272
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,250
It's so fucked up.
It's like,

273
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,520
look,
Andre Ward was an Olympic gold medalist,

274
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:06,350
but if you let him boxing the Olympics
right now,

275
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,450
it will be so fucked up.
It's just wrong.

276
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,800
Well,
because,

277
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,740
uh,
just way better than the box in the

278
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,040
Olympics.
They don't let the professionals.

279
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,290
Is it an age cap?
It

280
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,150
was,
it just.

281
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,983
No,
it's just,

282
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,520
I don't think they allow professionals
where,

283
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:24,010
although that whole professional
nonprofessional things very,

284
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,310
very weird now,
especially now that they let nba players

285
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,010
play,
you know,

286
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,410
because like there was always talk of
that.

287
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:31,690
Like when they were talking about doing
that,

288
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,520
like it was back when Mike Tyson was a
champion.

289
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:33,941
Then we're like,
well,

290
00:11:33,941 --> 00:11:36,250
what the fuck?
What have you let Mike Tyson box the

291
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:37,810
Olympics.
Good luck.

292
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,383
Well,
the,

293
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,760
the players from the other teams I pros
to.

294
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,680
Yeah,
I mean the,

295
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,910
the uh,
whenever that other countries,

296
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:47,520
well,
Spain had some solid plans and some of

297
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:48,660
them are NBA players.
Paula,

298
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:53,661
all marcus saw a rudy guns [inaudible],
a couple of other players that played in

299
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:54,514
the NBA.

300
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,890
Australia actually put up a,
a decent team.

301
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:00,730
They got bogut.
Maybe Patty Mills,

302
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:02,530
I might be fucking out,
but they have a handful of,

303
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,680
a handful of pros from other countries
and in those pro leagues that have been

304
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:12,760
competitive against but not those guys,
which there's pros and then there's

305
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:15,790
American pros when it comes to
basketball,

306
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,640
there's no competition.
It's kind of a joke,

307
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,610
isn't it?
It's getting close for a second for a

308
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:25,900
little bit.
Skinny Spain and Spain has some guys and

309
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:30,901
spans a bunch of guys in the league.
So it's within Spain plays a USA.

310
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:35,410
It's basically like some NBA players
playing against other nba players,

311
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,380
you know what I mean?
Versus random dudes.

312
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,720
It instead of it being random dudes from
Spain,

313
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:42,250
it's actually,
you know,

314
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:46,180
they might be playing,
one of the guys on USA might be playing

315
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:48,970
against one of their real NBA teammates.

316
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,080
Interesting.
Yeah.

317
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,530
The rules are a little different to a
international basketball.

318
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,700
What's the,
what's the difference?

319
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:55,780
For instance,
you can go 10,

320
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,500
but once the ball hits the rim,
you can swat it off and an MBA and an

321
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,800
all American basketball pretty much.
You can't even touch the ball if it's

322
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:05,220
anywhere close to the rim or above it.
It's like a.

323
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,750
that's a whole act like that's a whole
extra rule if you're like,

324
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,110
if you're a seven foot tall,
right.

325
00:13:09,111 --> 00:13:11,120
You can just snatch the ball every time
I get to near the room.

326
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,080
Basically.
It's a couple of other little small ones

327
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,300
like bumping into.
It's interesting how other countries

328
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:20,380
used to used to be a noncompetitive in
certain sport.

329
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:22,990
Like boxing is a perfect example.
For the longest time,

330
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:26,650
like the American boxers were head and
shoulders above the rest of the world.

331
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,250
Then?

332
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,930
Yeah,
like especially like in the heavyweight

333
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:30,980
division,
it wasn't even close there.

334
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,090
Like there was Henry Cooper who hurt
Muhammad Ali real bad.

335
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,120
That was an interesting story.
This is back on.

336
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:40,600
Muhammad Ali was still cassius clay
before he became a home and wait,

337
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,670
and Henry Cooper was like the big
English heavyweight and he rocked

338
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:48,670
Mohammed Ali with a left hook and you
know what Angelo Dundee did.

339
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,960
He cut Muhammad Ali's gloves.
He went back to the corner and he sliced

340
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:54,230
his gloves and he's like,
Hey,

341
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:56,290
we got to change these gloves.
These gloves are fucked up.

342
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,960
So they bought them all this time.
They had an

343
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,260
oh shit.
Yeah,

344
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:04,600
they had an undo the tape,
get another pair of gloves,

345
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,410
like the cut his fucking gloves because
that's the type of tricks you can do in

346
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:09,770
the sixties.
Yeah,

347
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,933
yeah,
exactly.

348
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,460
Yeah.
That's what they did.

349
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,530
But he,
if you ever see the fight,

350
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:18,190
he got cracked like more than he ever
got cracked in his entire career.

351
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,870
But Google Henry Cooper a rocks Mohammed
Ali.

352
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,320
And so Mohammed Ali,
it wasn't Muhammad Ali was Cassius clay

353
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:28,840
back then,
so he drops him with like the perfect

354
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:33,220
left hook that was his big punch to and
Ali just crashes down to his ass and

355
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:36,760
he's like out and they,
they gave them all sorts of time.

356
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:39,160
He went back to the corner,
they cut the gloves,

357
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:41,920
they took the gloves off,
then he went back and got new gloves.

358
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,200
They had to,
they sliced slices,

359
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:49,201
gloves open with a razor blade,
sliced him about 10 minutes.

360
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,960
This whole lot of time.
Anytime.

361
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,740
A lot of time because they had to get
gloves,

362
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,660
you know,
they don't have gloves is waiting.

363
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,960
What was a.
I Wonder what the commentators stall

364
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:01,490
game was.
See it right here.

365
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,230
What are these guys used to stolen right

366
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,880
here.
Boom.

367
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,960
Oh yeah.
Like he is fucking out.

368
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:14,230
Got His rock and it's end of the round.
The very end of the rounds.

369
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,810
Boom.
I mean as a perfect left hook.

370
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,810
It just got sat down.
He's in deep trouble.

371
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,660
So there's two things happen.
One is the end of the round.

372
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,790
See?
He's like really out of it here.

373
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,750
Like Shit.
Yeah,

374
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:31,160
they're throwing water on him and then
when they go back they're like,

375
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:31,994
oh,
you know,

376
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,410
oh,
so they cut it out of this.

377
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:36,320
They don't show.
They changed the gloves.

378
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,380
So he's super fresh year and he wound up
to be stopping Henry Cooper by cut.

379
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,140
See if there's a clip of the glove
changing.

380
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,500
That's funny.
It's like,

381
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,680
this is a Mike Tyson's old train.
Not old trainer,

382
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:53,400
but old manager.
Goddammit.

383
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,080
I forget his name,
but he was a boxing historian and he put

384
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:02,081
together all of these videos and he used
to do the voiceover for a lot of these

385
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:06,500
videos to like right when custom Otto
died.

386
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,710
Him and Shelly Finkel took over.
God Damn it.

387
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:13,040
What the fuck is his name?
Mike Tyson's old manager.

388
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,980
What do you got there?
Pulling it up,

389
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,590
bobby?
Nope.

390
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,220
Nope.
There's an old Jewish guy.

391
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,280
I forget his name,
but he was a.

392
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,770
He had a tremendous library of films.
Yeah,

393
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,630
that's one of the things that uh,
Mike Tyson used to go and watch,

394
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,210
you know,
obviously we're talking about the early

395
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:38,380
eighties,
so this is before vhs tapes or raw.

396
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,360
I mean,
those things weren't on vhs tapes,

397
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,630
so he would watch them like on 16
millimeter film.

398
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,950
Yeah,
yeah,

399
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,680
yeah.
God Damn.

400
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,700
I'm struggling to remember his fucking
name.

401
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:54,701
It's driving me crazy.
Something with a J.

402
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,503
Anyway,
point being,

403
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,540
he probably edited that out,
who didn't want to show the controversy

404
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,740
because it was plain straight cheating.
They just cheated.

405
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,210
I want to hear the,
what the commentators did during that

406
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,720
stall point.
Oh,

407
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,720
we don't know what's going on.
Or did they just veer off into other Ta

408
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:21,770
sometimes how baseball commentators just
start talking about some weird random

409
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:26,690
shit about their family
is downside,

410
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,600
you know,
went out fishing in lake is great,

411
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,370
man.
The mosquitoes get to you,

412
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:34,620
but.
Okay.

413
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:35,340
Yeah.
Hi.

414
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,020
In a way,
baseball players.

415
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:38,100
It's an art to that,
right?

416
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:39,900
Because there's so much downtime.
Yeah,

417
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:42,060
it's A.
Oh absolutely.

418
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,030
It's so much downtime.
I was watching one clip,

419
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,060
I forget what Teva was,
but it was a,

420
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,090
just of the,
it was

421
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,100
somebody at bat and then one of his
teammates was just exactly Mike and his,

422
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,173
his,
uh,

423
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,200
just imitating his batting style and
ritual.

424
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,410
Just each from like every little nuance
to just what he would do with his left

425
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,260
foot and just.
And He,

426
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,220
and then he was doing that for all his
teammates because you got so much

427
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:13,221
downside that you,
him and you around them a 162 games and

428
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:15,610
plus practice.
So you're like,

429
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,660
yeah,
I know exactly all of your moves or your

430
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:20,350
mannerisms.
Exactly.

431
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,400
Every one of your mannerisms down to the
eye.

432
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,650
Twitch,
my high school wrestling coach refused

433
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:26,490
to call baseball sport.
He's like,

434
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:28,800
it's not a sport skill,
skills,

435
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:30,030
game,
skills game.

436
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,470
But you do have to run,
you have to run.

437
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,120
This is not my favorite sport,
but I respect it a lot.

438
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,040
Um,
I don't,

439
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,660
I,
you know,

440
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,050
heavy biases from the cups.

441
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,240
I don't know anybody was playing
baseball once they get arrested,

442
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,520
that's a lot of you got to be arrested
or you gonna fuck j Lo.

443
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:57,450
That's how a lot of people found out.
Hobby Baez is one of the best defenders

444
00:18:57,451 --> 00:19:01,000
and elite makes incredible plays.
And where you like,

445
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,000
that's,
that's athletics.

446
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:04,320
If somebody.
Oh for sure.

447
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,080
But it's,
it's a lot of skill involved,

448
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:10,410
but it's definitely it.
Definitely athletes.

449
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,350
I think.
Yeah,

450
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,590
they are,
but it's like there's a big gap between

451
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:17,430
dad and say like basketball,
like you have to be in some extreme

452
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:18,330
cardio,
right?

453
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,070
Basketball,
you're running back and forth and back

454
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:23,460
and forth and you know,
those guys are always sore after games

455
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:25,920
and you know,
they got fucking plantar fasciitis and

456
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:29,280
shoulder issues.
Constant activity is no,

457
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,520
you know,
you can be in left field a couple of

458
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,280
minutes and not do anything.

459
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,800
Just chilling out there with your own
thoughts.

460
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,260
Talking to the fans and shit.
Yeah,

461
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,300
it's none of that in basketball just
standing around except for during free

462
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:48,660
throws or downtime.
But baseball players might go,

463
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,080
especially if the pitcher is killing it.
Yeah.

464
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,020
You just,
you just get into your fucking stands

465
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,790
halfheartedly and.
But you know,

466
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,700
it might not be coming out there.
That's the other thing about baseball

467
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,400
fans will torture you if you're sitting
out there.

468
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,270
Oh yeah,
that's a long time to be out there on a

469
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,430
away game plus the drinking.
There's 18 minutes of action.

470
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:13,431
Your average major league baseball game,
that's like less than one fight.

471
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,930
Eighteen minutes actually,
that's like one championship fight or

472
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:26,400
less than less than one championship
fight or basically one slash three round

473
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:28,770
fight,
which is 15 minutes of action.

474
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,260
That's crazy.
We acted like we made a big discovery in

475
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,851
shit.
Yo.

476
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:34,170
Baseball borrowing.
Yeah,

477
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,641
we did it.
Well.

478
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:37,920
Baseball is one of those games,
like if you tried to invent it today,

479
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:40,520
they'd be like,
get the fuck away from there with DNA.

480
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,700
That shit is definitely old school.
But the other thing about that 18

481
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:48,250
minutes of action,
that's not even action of

482
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,000
everybody that's in that.
Everybody moving at once,

483
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:57,001
like a football game or basketball.
That's maybe three or four people moving

484
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,080
around.
Yeah,

485
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,990
depends.
Usually if you turned on the double play

486
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:04,810
then you know it was a handful of people
involved in.

487
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:06,940
But yeah,
it's pretty boring.

488
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,120
Shit,
I ain't get paid a lot.

489
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,190
A lot of games.
I guess it's crazy how much money is

490
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:14,530
involved in it.
People I get mad,

491
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,890
but it's gone to like Japan.
Where else?

492
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,980
What other countries adopted baseball
adopted it took it a super popular in

493
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:24,940
Japan.
I know Cuba.

494
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:25,860
Cuba,
right.

495
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,870
I take it maybe Mexico,
Mexico on a career.

496
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,240
I'm just saying stuff.
Yeah.

497
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:35,640
I don't know.
Just guessing.

498
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,340
It's amazing how little interest people
here have for soccer.

499
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,530
That's what's really amazing.
When you say a soccer worldwide and see

500
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:49,531
how little we give a fuck about it here,
except those annoying white dudes that

501
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,340
like to get really hyped up about it.
When the World Cup comes around and they

502
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:56,590
scream and yell at bars like they really
give a fuck.

503
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,610
This reportedly growing belief that
Bryce Harper's next contract could be

504
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:04,150
worth over $400,000,000.

505
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:11,430
I couldn't imagine Jesus just a that
type of a serious scrutiny and attention

506
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:19,830
on my finances like that.
Brian has expectation.

507
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,800
This is not even.
Not The contract is set yet,

508
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,900
but when people are talking about what
you might make so much money,

509
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,760
it's a lot of money.
It's too much money,

510
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,800
too much money to be resting over your
head,

511
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,710
sink full of hundreds to well say.
It's about.

512
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,190
I don't know.
I mean it depends on what state he lives

513
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,500
in,
how much money it actually is.

514
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,960
Well,
it becomes a thing like with floyd

515
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:45,040
mayweather,
you know,

516
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,720
like a big thing about floyd mayweather
is how much money he makes is not just

517
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:52,330
that he's a great boxer,
it's that he's going to make

518
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,970
$300,000,000.
Apparently it's going to be even more

519
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:56,740
than that.
And you see the paper view numbers,

520
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,360
they're talking about six point $5,
million pay per view buys,

521
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,080
so it's more than 2 million more than
the manny Pacquiao fight.

522
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,620
That's insane.
Does that include the potential refunds

523
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,700
today?
That's a good question.

524
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,510
Well to be fair,
he did nickname himself money

525
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:16,300
mayweather.
Well he did after he was pretty boy

526
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:17,230
floyd.
He changed it,

527
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,050
but yeah.
Then he built the persona around.

528
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,760
I spend money.
Yes.

529
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,730
He doesn't have to do.
I mean it is.

530
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,790
It's cool and good for him,
but he did make a big thing about

531
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:31,890
spending money that one time he showed
up like $100,

532
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:34,680
million dollar check.
Stupid.

533
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,530
Like,
wait,

534
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,790
why is that?
Unlike a regular ass check on a regular

535
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:44,020
chase bank check.
It wasn't even a big cardboard one night

536
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:45,260
even net or print out

537
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,910
or print it out on a or even a wire or
something.

538
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:51,290
I will get that wired.
Yeah.

539
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,790
Laminate that thing is real.
He's really holding onto a $100,000,000

540
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,820
check.
But it was just a regular as check that

541
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:01,130
you would buy groceries on in the
eighties.

542
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

543
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,240
That $100 million.
Yeah.

544
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,820
I guess he wrote it to himself.
So it's made with it promotions general

545
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,310
for.
Yeah.

546
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,220
Yeah.
You got 100 million and a bank of

547
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:15,950
America I guess.
So it seems like he just holds onto it

548
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:17,540
too.
Hey,

549
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,280
he doesn't catch it.
That's a weird.

550
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,250
Out of his book bag at one of the uh,
yeah,

551
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,150
but I mean why is he hanging on onto
that?

552
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:27,450
Why did you should probably catch that
was his other account anyways.

553
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,820
It's mainly where the promotions
account.

554
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,400
Who Cares?
So the bay where the personal account,

555
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,250
the checking.
So he's probably gonna make more than

556
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:36,920
$300.
Million Dollars from this last fight.

557
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,570
Sure.
Yeah.

558
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,890
Amazing.
I can't imagine that they won't do that

559
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:45,680
again.
That him and connor won't do it again

560
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,520
with a wet finger.
Konica figure out how to not get tired.

561
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,410
If he could convince people like say if
he fights Paulie Malignaggi he's beats

562
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,300
the shit out of Paulie Malignaggi and
then says Freud,

563
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:04,040
let's do it one more fucking time.
And I think Florida.

564
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,060
Nah Man.
Come on.

565
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:05,930
We did that.
Know,

566
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,860
I know he starts thinking about that
money could.

567
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,250
If you could figure out a way to get
people excited about it.

568
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,560
Connor could get somehow somehow or
another get more people to pay attention

569
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:21,530
because it was an interesting fight for
the first three or four rounds.

570
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,090
It's made it.
He made it look interesting,

571
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:25,250
but it really wasn't interested.
I thought it was interesting.

572
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:27,500
But then when I thought back it wasn't
interested.

573
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,300
Well he caught clean.
You know,

574
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:31,010
he caught him with an upper cut in the
first round.

575
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,790
Nobody hits fully clean like that.
Lloyd underestimated in my thoughts.

576
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:38,020
So wasn't.
He wasn't doing that shoulder roll?

577
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,170
No,
he was.

578
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,850
Because he wanted to.
He didn't believe in Conexpo.

579
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,980
So floyd usually boxes anything.
That's what it is when you always see

580
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:52,430
them boxing that like he blocked Canelo
and he does that and and he goes off of

581
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:54,560
that counter.
I don't think that's what it was.

582
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:56,930
I think he knew that conner was going to
get tired if he was backing up.

583
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:02,020
He knows that connor has a endurance
problems and as long as he wasn't

584
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:04,400
throwing a lot of punches,
which floyd wasn't,

585
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,550
and he's constantly faking and moving.
He's got connor backing up.

586
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,640
He could be.
It's way easier to be defensive if

587
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:13,640
you're not being authentic.
So if you're not thinking about hitting

588
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:15,770
the guy,
if you're constantly like fainting and

589
00:26:15,771 --> 00:26:17,570
you've got your hands up,
you're moving forward,

590
00:26:17,571 --> 00:26:19,700
but really what you're thinking about is
what he's throwing.

591
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,300
You can get away with a lot and you
could press for it a lot more because

592
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:25,640
you're going to see the punches coming
because you're not really thinking too

593
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:29,090
much about throwing your own punches
unless he's like a clear wide opening.

594
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,840
So for the first couple of rounds he was
mostly like putting pressure on them,

595
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,810
sizing him up.
When I watched it after the fight,

596
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,180
it became way more obvious,
like while you're watching it,

597
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:39,110
you're like,
what's gonna Happen?

598
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:42,650
What's gonna happen once you already
know what's what's happened then.

599
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,190
Then I watched it and I said,
oh,

600
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:46,470
I could see exactly what he's doing.
He's fainting,

601
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,770
putting a lot of pressure on conor and
he's making kind of backup a lot,

602
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,610
which exists is exhausting.
And then also connor's not very

603
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,080
efficient.
He's not a boxer.

604
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,310
So like there's a lot of energy being
wasted.

605
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,870
Like he's going to get tired more easily
and then he doesn't run so he doesn't

606
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,640
have the same kind of endurance of floyd
has.

607
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,200
It's a lot.
A lot of factors in there.

608
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,120
Yeah,
it was 111 punches,

609
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:08,100
but some of them were like,
yeah,

610
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,610
all the ones that connor landed.
You mean there was a few of them.

611
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:14,100
They were like little [inaudible] yeah.
Yeah.

612
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,060
There were also like weird ones like
Patty Patty,

613
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,190
patty punches to the side of the head in
the back of the head.

614
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,220
This is one main it kind of this and it
just is this box and shit.

615
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:28,591
Well,
you know,

616
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:30,420
you get used to that in mma,
you know,

617
00:27:30,421 --> 00:27:33,900
you get used to hammer fists.
Well I think that's what I saw.

618
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,580
I was talking about the and a lot of
other people were just wondering if

619
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:42,210
muscle memory is going to just kick in
and he was going to do some weird

620
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:44,220
information and it did kick it a little
bit,

621
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:46,380
but not to the extreme.

622
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,880
Yeah,
I think there was some massive penalties

623
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,800
for any.
So if he had any sort of a point

624
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,630
deduction or anything that they did
something illegal.

625
00:27:55,631 --> 00:27:59,130
I think he had a massive penalty more
than a million dollars for each thing.

626
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,370
He fucked up 10

627
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,410
mil.
10 Mil makes them for each one.

628
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,030
That makes sense.
At that 10 mil makes you get your shit

629
00:28:07,031 --> 00:28:07,864
together.

630
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,890
As long as he's not,
doesn't get disqualified.

631
00:28:09,891 --> 00:28:13,340
It might be worth it like 10 million for
one fucking needed of the body.

632
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:16,950
You know,
I,

633
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:21,720
I didn't know you used to fight until
after the last time I did the podcast.

634
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,770
I just thought you have got to work out
a lot and just really liked mixed

635
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:28,590
martial arts and combat.
But I never fought in mixed martial arts

636
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:31,440
because he wasn't around.
But a kickboxing.

637
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,220
Yeah,
I did that.

638
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,840
Yeah.
Because I remember just seeing

639
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:34,980
something.
Somebody said,

640
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,110
Oh,
you talking about rogen like that.

641
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,930
He'll kick you in your shit.
And I'm like,

642
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:41,790
what?
And then I looked up Rogan.

643
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,920
Kickboxing.
Huh?

644
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,650
What the fuck?
This whole time

645
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,770
she was kicking the shit out of her
back.

646
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:50,843
Yeah.
Yeah.

647
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,860
How'd that feel,
man,

648
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,530
to hit somebody feels weird.
The bag.

649
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,251
Oh,
bags.

650
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:57,084
Easy.
Yeah.

651
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,210
Bags don't hit back.
When's the last time you hit somebody

652
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,080
in?
In anger or in a competition?

653
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:05,390
It's been a long fucking time.
It was anger.

654
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,700
Neither one.
Neither one's in longer.

655
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,090
Anger and anger is probably a highschool
hold.

656
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:14,150
Competitions when I was 22 or something
like that,

657
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:16,370
that was a taekwondo tournament.
I was 19 then.

658
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,240
Oh,
and that was you.

659
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,470
The walk off those.
Meet with the Walker.

660
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,380
Have you kicked so of the body like
that?

661
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:28,970
A spinning back kick to the body.
So much bulletproof.

662
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,600
Doesn't matter that thing.
That's just moral protection.

663
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,010
Oh Man.
So what was your at that moment when you

664
00:29:36,011 --> 00:29:38,350
saw him laying down and he's dead?
I knew he was gone,

665
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,230
but I'm not dead.
And you know,

666
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,990
taken Tam.
He's not getting up.

667
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,650
Was it like.
Yeah,

668
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,810
you have to walk away and make it look
like it's no big deal.

669
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,140
That was how my thought process was.
Don't get excited.

670
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,240
Make lives like this is what I'm going
to do to everybody.

671
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,360
Just relax.
Just walk off and have everybody so

672
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:56,560
nervous.
So you don't even care.

673
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,120
Like this is just a normal thing for
you.

674
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,090
You kick people to go unconscious,
they fall down,

675
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:04,630
they can't get up that you gotta have
that people because you're in a

676
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:06,190
tournament.
So you're going to be fighting a bunch

677
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:08,500
of people and then watch it.
Yeah.

678
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,180
You might have to fight three or four
times in a day.

679
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Who was there rooting for you to see my
teammates because of the train with no,

680
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,380
it doesn't even seem like even more I
watch.

681
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:20,740
That doesn't really feel like me so long
ago.

682
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:21,703
Just a hair.

683
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,660
Well,
not only that,

684
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,330
I mean I also have a head protector on
the back of my hand.

685
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,560
They would wear these a head protectors.
Either you could wear a full one that

686
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:32,440
covers your whole head,
like over your ears or you were one

687
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:35,050
that's just the back of your head,
which is really just there.

688
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:37,660
So when you get knocked out,
your head doesn't need fucking bounce

689
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:38,700
off the ground.
Yeah,

690
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,750
because we were fighting on a basketball
court.

691
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,990
You look at that,
that's just a wood floor shit.

692
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,480
Yeah,
there's a lot of that fun on the hockey

693
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:49,810
rink once where they put a plastic sheet
down on a hockey rink.

694
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:52,570
So it was a,
not the ice but the cement underneath

695
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:55,060
the hockey rink.
So we were basically fighting on cement.

696
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:59,560
So the eighties with terrible is fucking
awful bad for brain damage,

697
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:02,680
that's for sure.
A lot of people who got fucked up,

698
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:04,930
knocked out and bounce their head off
the ground.

699
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,490
Jesus,
I saw a lot of that.

700
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,040
Oh not good.
And for no money,

701
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,080
that's the thing.
There's no future,

702
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,170
no future and no money for the love of
the game.

703
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,920
Well,
I guess it prepares you for life and

704
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:20,920
also you wanted to find out.
I wanted to find out how I would.

705
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:25,030
Do you know,
I wanted to find out what it would be

706
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:27,700
like to compete under high stress
situations.

707
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:29,950
Like worrying about someone kicking you
in the face.

708
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,600
Yeah.
I'm glad that most people can't kick

709
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:38,620
somebody in the face,
so I'm glad that's whatever I go to UFC

710
00:31:38,621 --> 00:31:43,140
fight or even made the ad just whenever
somebody gets kicked in the face and if

711
00:31:43,141 --> 00:31:45,220
I got kicked in the face.
Have you sold disappointed?

712
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,330
It's not good.
It's not.

713
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,900
It looks.
It looks crazy.

714
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,220
Yeah.
It's terrible for you.

715
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,960
The thing is more people can kick people
in the face now than I think at any

716
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:57,310
other time in human history.

717
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,630
I think there's a lot of fucking people
that can kick people in the face now

718
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:05,500
because of watching MMA and internet and
classes training.

719
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,650
I think more people training now than.
Than ever before for sure.

720
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,470
There's way more people that could
strangle people than ever.

721
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,860
Oh yeah.
One hundred percent because the choke is

722
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,800
easier to learn now.
It's just more people doing Jujitsu than

723
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:19,780
any other time in history.
Like before,

724
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:24,040
like in my early martial arts days,
there was no one that was doing

725
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:27,430
grappling really.
Like I wrestled in high school and then

726
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:31,300
there was no like Jujitsu classes.
There was like you could take judo,

727
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,710
like there was judo,
but there was very few like actual

728
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,490
submission grappling schools or anything
like that.

729
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,190
Even nationwide there was a small

730
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,810
handful.
Nobody knew what the fuck they were

731
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:43,680
doing.
Now everywhere you look,

732
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:47,180
there's a Jujitsu school.
Like I was down in San Diego,

733
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,370
just San Diego alone,
which is not a big city.

734
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,380
They must have 100 Jujitsu schools

735
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,120
just in San Diego.
Shit.

736
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,800
Crazy.
I'm going to start sponsoring more

737
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:56,930
fighters.
Yeah.

738
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,380
Are you remember?
I sponsored a and she.

739
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:01,400
Ms Dot wait.
Yeah.

740
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:02,220
And INVICTA,
right?

741
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,760
Yeah.
She's going to do more.

742
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,110
I am.
Some other people reached out.

743
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,590
I got to just get some new designs for
the club.

744
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,000
That's what's been holding me back.
I gotta get some new designs that will.

745
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,950
That was an okay design,
but I had a mix up like your face on her

746
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:18,760
ass or something like that.
Is that the whole body?

747
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,300
It wasn't just last day.
It was,

748
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,370
it was just in case,
you know,

749
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,340
just in case she got knocked out and
fell on her face.

750
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,840
Did Hannibal buress I come,
yeah.

751
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,580
Yeah.
You could do it in some organizations

752
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:32,570
still.
There it is.

753
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,400
Oh yeah.
All over it.

754
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:38,090
She didn't make weight.
That didn't make weight.

755
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,460
I think it's harder for girls to make
weight.

756
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,380
Well she.
Well she's.

757
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:47,410
She's fighting next week at.
I think she was trying to fight at 1:15

758
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,460
and she's fighting at 1:25 now or she
was trying to fight.

759
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:53,600
I think she's trying to fight at one.
Oh,

760
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:55,070
five and now fight.
They want either.

761
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:58,600
Was she cutting much weight?
She's cutting this weight this time.

762
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,500
That was the other thought about the
conor fight.

763
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,480
A lot of people thought that connor cut
too much weight.

764
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,340
That's one of the reasons why I burned
out.

765
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,080
Yeah,
it's part of it.

766
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,680
I think it was a factor.
He does cut a lot of weight and that

767
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,380
does drain your body and it's not like
when he's training,

768
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:13,970
he's cutting that Wayne because he's
not,

769
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,520
you know,
like you only do it once,

770
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,930
you do it right before the weigh ins

771
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,530
you weigh in and then you put the weight
back on.

772
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,500
So all that endurance training,
all this hard rounds that you did,

773
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,890
that's not after you're dehydrated

774
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:30,250
yourself severely.
So your body's not used to operating

775
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,130
exactly that level with this situation.
Yeah,

776
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,260
well he's used to it

777
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,750
because he fights in mma like that,
but mma,

778
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:40,090
you get more chances to take a break.
You get.

779
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,140
It's,
it's different.

780
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,880
You know,
it's more exhausting,

781
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:46,930
like it could potentially be more
exhausting because there's grappling and

782
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:50,020
there's kicks and there's just a lot
more going on and you're fighting five

783
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,270
minute rounds,
like you have more of a chance to get

784
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:55,870
tired in that five minute rounds,
but when you clench with someone,

785
00:34:55,871 --> 00:34:58,900
you could actually hold onto them,
like referee's not going to break it.

786
00:34:58,901 --> 00:35:01,450
You can take them to the ground and get
on top of them.

787
00:35:01,451 --> 00:35:03,880
You couldn't hold your position and
catch your breath.

788
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,220
There's there's more opportunities to
recover.

789
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,470
Right?
At weight cutting is the worst part of

790
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,340
fighting.
One hundred percent seems.

791
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,850
It was even the fighter that a judge was
opposed to fight that day.

792
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,550
She took a picture of herself and she
made weight,

793
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,990
but it looks terrible.
It was definitely one.

794
00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:28,411
Oh,
five.

795
00:35:28,411 --> 00:35:31,290
Not at our member [inaudible].
One 15 wouldn't look crazy,

796
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:35,030
like,
well it could if you were fine.

797
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,870
It was just like,
she's like,

798
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:37,800
I waiting.
I was like,

799
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,180
Oh,
you okay?

800
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,510
It was just a.
She put it phone on.

801
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,460
I.
I'm like,

802
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,260
you know what,
that she tried.

803
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:48,070
She tried to make wait shit.
Who Cares?

804
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,950
A few pounds,
but I guess those few pounds matter.

805
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:54,951
Obviously somebody is overweight and
didn't go through the strenuous process

806
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:58,060
that you went to today.

807
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,640
Minute advantage.
Yeah.

808
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,960
You have an advantage if you're not
dehydrating yourself as much,

809
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:04,690
but that advantage is crazy.
Like they should stop doing that.

810
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,630
They really should figure out a way to
stop fighters from cutting weight like

811
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:09,010
that.
What's the alternative?

812
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,730
The alternative is to weigh them like
randomly the same way they catch people

813
00:36:12,731 --> 00:36:17,200
that drugs like when like random drug
tests do random weight tests,

814
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,210
like they show up and they go,
oh Hannah,

815
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:21,160
but look,
you're 175 pounds.

816
00:36:21,161 --> 00:36:23,680
You're supposed to be fighting at 1:55.
What the fuck is that?

817
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,970
Like,
okay.

818
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,500
And then they catch you again.
Okay,

819
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:29,760
well you're 176 pounds today.
All you're definitely not fighting at

820
00:36:29,761 --> 00:36:31,180
1:55.
And they'll,

821
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,180
they'll give you a way parameter.
Like it says it's healthy for you to cut

822
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:36,220
10 pounds.
You've got to fight at one 66.

823
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:40,240
That's your weight class.
So it'll force fighters to be more

824
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:42,070
disciplined about their actual weight.

825
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,090
Like you can't balloon up in between
rounds or in between competition.

826
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,160
And you're also,
you know,

827
00:36:48,161 --> 00:36:51,850
you have to think about how much weight
you could actually dehydrate out of your

828
00:36:51,851 --> 00:36:56,200
body.
Healthy California has some new Ra laws,

829
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,900
like they only let you cut a certain
amount of weight.

830
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,630
Like they'll,
uh,

831
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,430
they,
they periodically measure people like

832
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,650
during their camp and give them an
opportunity and they measure them during

833
00:37:05,651 --> 00:37:07,350
the camp.
And those was one of the reasons I

834
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,550
hadn't Barao who was the bantamweight
champion.

835
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:13,360
He fought aljamain sterling,
but they wouldn't let him fight at 1:35.

836
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:16,350
They made them fight at 1:40 [inaudible]
like he cut too much weight

837
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,340
catch weight.
Yeah,

838
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,330
yeah,
yeah.

839
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,440
Uh,
I think that should be the option for

840
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:27,360
the crazy fired is just to whatever
weight you want to be class,

841
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,610
that'd be one like foot fires that might
not be active on that on the bill.

842
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,340
And we got the spot like guest but the
guest,

843
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:37,230
but guest by on the comedy.
So you know,

844
00:37:37,231 --> 00:37:40,290
somebody just pops up,
hey pop up fight.

845
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,720
No matter what the way it is,
these two fighters,

846
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,980
they whatever the fuck wait,
they want to be,

847
00:37:44,981 --> 00:37:48,630
they've agreed to fight.
We got this guy coming in and one 65,

848
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:53,160
this other guy coming in at 2:15.
They agreed to fight each other.

849
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,690
You're cool with that.
Like old school?

850
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:55,580
UFC One?
Yeah,

851
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,780
like the old school,
but not crazy,

852
00:37:57,781 --> 00:38:00,240
you know that sumo wrestler versus you
know,

853
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:01,560
100 pound dude.
But

854
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,410
how much weight?
Thirty pounds difference like that cat

855
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,363
was the cap.

856
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,720
I think it's up to late.
Leave it up to the person.

857
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:12,790
A guest is the guest spot.
Well,

858
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:13,990
lot of

859
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,990
people do that in a grappling
tournaments and grappling tournaments.

860
00:38:16,991 --> 00:38:19,870
They have the absolute division and the
absolute division.

861
00:38:19,871 --> 00:38:21,700
Sometimes the lighter guys when the
whole thing.

862
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,860
Yeah,
but there's no hitting.

863
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,230
That's the thing about grappling,
you know,

864
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,650
it's like you can,
you can get by and skill and technique

865
00:38:29,651 --> 00:38:34,240
and an understanding your positioning
where like know you're fighting a guy

866
00:38:34,241 --> 00:38:36,060
like,
like Francis

867
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,970
in Ghana or something like that.
It's just a giant 265 pound dude.

868
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:41,920
If you're 150 pound guy,
you're fucked.

869
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,080
You're just fucked.
That guy.

870
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,470
He's what?
Eight something or he's 10 and 1:10 and

871
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:48,041
one.
Yeah,

872
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:50,290
I think he lost one of his early fights.
The commission.

873
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,870
Okay.
Look that they have a 10 point plan to

874
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:55,210
curb the weight.
Cutting a while.

875
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:59,470
Protecting fighters now normalized in
the commission's rules are steeper,

876
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,680
fine for missing.
Wait a 10 percent cap on the way to

877
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:05,490
fighter is allowed to gain between the
time the weigh ins.

878
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,550
Oh,
that's interesting.

879
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,080
And an event,
uh,

880
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:11,770
and the weight class restrictions for
those who miss weight more than once,

881
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,140
they also recognized for new weight
classes.

882
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:16,570
I think that's huge.
Have a bunch of weight class.

883
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:18,430
They should have weight classes every 10
pounds.

884
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,570
That Guy Andy Foster,
he's the California State Athletic

885
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,070
Commission Executive Director.
He's the shit.

886
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,630
That guy's awesome.
He really is the most proactive at of

887
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:32,470
all of the athletic commission guys.
So that's it.

888
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,110
They'll figure it out.
They banned the use of [inaudible],

889
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:39,850
which is interesting too because ivs
help you considerably to rehydrate.

890
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,840
Sure.
Yeah.

891
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,900
They banned him.
Yeah,

892
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,160
they banned them.
They don't want people relying on that

893
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:50,120
because thirsty
punched fight.

894
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:55,540
Just all these articles about a Kevin
Doran about talking shit about under

895
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:56,590
armour.
Dude,

896
00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:59,640
that crushed their stock yesterday.
It's easy.

897
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,580
It's the trump of basketball shoe
stocks.

898
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:04,540
No.
You know what he did?

899
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:09,541
He's just like casually commenting about
like how kids will pick schools based on

900
00:40:09,671 --> 00:40:10,451
what,
what,

901
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:11,470
um,
what,

902
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,550
what,
uh,

903
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,880
sneakers.
They're going to have to wear it.

904
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,800
True.
Yeah.

905
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,240
Oh,
started to rent.

906
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:18,970
Takes a shot at under armor.
But he just said it and like in a matter

907
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:19,860
of fact,
sort of a way,

908
00:40:19,861 --> 00:40:21,880
it's like kids don't want to play an
under underarmour.

909
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,980
So you look at this.
Nobody wants to play in under armour.

910
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,550
I'm sorry.
The top kids don't because they all play

911
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:31,551
Nike on a podcast.
Podcast interview dropped the stock.

912
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,300
Is that what it was?
A podcast,

913
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,380
a ringer podcast.
It dropped the stock three percent.

914
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,190
Much money.
That must be for a giant company like

915
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:43,480
under armour.
Three percent.

916
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:48,430
That's a billion dollar plus company.
Three percent is probably tens of

917
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:48,770
millions of dollars.
Right?

918
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,360
Get a bounce back though.
How much is the,

919
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,210
the actual difference?
Uh Oh,

920
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:58,030
it's slow.
It's down 44 percent assessed to start a

921
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,980
year.
Oh,

922
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,850
that's not good if it's already been
slight.

923
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,470
Yeah.
There's a lot of issues with under

924
00:41:05,471 --> 00:41:08,920
armour and hunting too.
A lot of people think that under armour

925
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:10,090
is a,
they're,

926
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:14,170
they're worried about their hunting
division because like anti hunters,

927
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,020
they,
they're like the only gigantic company

928
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:22,530
that has the stones to support something
that's controversial as hunting.

929
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,950
I haven't been around very long though
either.

930
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:26,260
Right?
Under armour 15 years.

931
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:28,990
Maybe.
That's a good question.

932
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,300
Like I read that then I think they're
from the nineties.

933
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,860
I read some.
Adidas started back long,

934
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:34,070
long

935
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,370
time ago and then two brothers and
that's where Puma started as the two

936
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:39,260
brothers started due to some boom or
something like that.

937
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,550
Or

938
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:43,570
didas is from run DMC.
My Adidas,

939
00:41:43,571 --> 00:41:47,650
that's like 1980 something.
They're just now rebounding from the

940
00:41:47,651 --> 00:41:49,390
problems.
That nice juicy that quick.

941
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,210
You're a wizard.
You listen,

942
00:41:52,211 --> 00:41:54,270
man,
she's got a hatch up.

943
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,290
Pour it out.
I be professional.

944
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:59,440
That's The craziest,
fastest pee of you've down three waters

945
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:00,310
since you've been here,
man.

946
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,560
You lift all this.
Talk about these fighters,

947
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,730
dehydrating yourself.
You know,

948
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,890
fuck that.
I don't have to live by those rules.

949
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,380
Nope,
not in.

950
00:42:07,381 --> 00:42:08,290
Not In this game

951
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,040
we were talking about under armour.
They,

952
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,870
they,
uh,

953
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:13,870
have a hunting division.
And they take a ton of shit because I

954
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:17,170
know there's a,
there's a bunch of like crowdfunding

955
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,460
thing,
not crowd funds.

956
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:22,600
What are those things?
So it wasn't a fun thing.

957
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,110
It was a crowd something or another that
we're going after.

958
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:28,960
Cameron Hanes,
because they were calling him a trophy

959
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:31,270
hunter and they were trying to get under
armour to drop him.

960
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:35,360
But then you look at like how many
people like their,

961
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,400
their hunting divisions is tiny division
and then under armour itself,

962
00:42:39,401 --> 00:42:42,880
the company is just gigantic.
It's very interesting.

963
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,420
There's not a lot of companies that
would be that big that would support

964
00:42:46,421 --> 00:42:48,520
hunting.
Takes a lot of balls.

965
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:53,220
Yeah.
That means the CEO is definitely into

966
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,240
hunting and he's like,
this is my buddies.

967
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:58,330
Yeah,
well yeah,

968
00:42:58,331 --> 00:43:01,240
the owners.
And it's like you imagine Nike got into

969
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:02,370
hunting.
No Way.

970
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,310
He was in golf with Tiger Woods and
obviously he was a gigantic athlete for

971
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:09,340
them,
but now that he's not out there even

972
00:43:09,341 --> 00:43:11,200
playing golf,
the golf division,

973
00:43:11,201 --> 00:43:13,810
I think they just closed it this year.
Like they don't even make anything

974
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:16,480
anymore.
They'll make some clothes for and some

975
00:43:16,481 --> 00:43:18,370
shoes,
like they're putting golf spikes on the

976
00:43:18,371 --> 00:43:20,670
bottom of Jordan's,
but like they don't make clubs or

977
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,050
anything anymore I think because what
the Huh.

978
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,320
They just put in golf spikes on the
bottom of just get some of those extra

979
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,220
charges out there from the recalls
section and just talk some spikes on

980
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:32,530
there and just get them out to the US
Open.

981
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,790
Well we were talking last night about
rappers that get sponsored by shoe

982
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:39,820
companies at the store.
Like I didn't know that rappers had

983
00:43:39,821 --> 00:43:43,990
contracts with shoe companies.
Nike announces it will no longer make

984
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,730
golf clubs balls and bags.

985
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,230
You said this and I run DMC.
They probably for sure how to contrast.

986
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:54,220
Yeah.
50 slash fifty cent and Jay Z had a

987
00:43:54,221 --> 00:43:56,860
commercial wrapping back and forth at
each other.

988
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,730
Who else?
Kanye has his own shoe.

989
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,640
He has his own.
He.

990
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,700
Yeah,
but he had it with Nike originally and

991
00:44:03,701 --> 00:44:05,610
then went to adidas.
Uh,

992
00:44:05,611 --> 00:44:07,960
that's the only rappers or could you
imagine if a comic.

993
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,210
Kevin Hart,
Kevin Hart,

994
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,660
Kevin will.
You have to go to the next absolute

995
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,870
level.
Stratosphere as a comic or I mean,

996
00:44:16,871 --> 00:44:18,820
unless you really want to do it and do
it on a,

997
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:23,250
on a small artisanal level,
then you could.

998
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:24,880
You could do whatever you want to do.
Yeah.

999
00:44:24,881 --> 00:44:27,530
I guess
that's a.

1000
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:31,980
it's a weird thing though,
that rappers get sponsored by companies

1001
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:33,360
like.
Well,

1002
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:35,600
like Kendrick Lamar,
he's got a.

1003
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,600
Some sort of a shoe company thing.
Popular Person.

1004
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:39,480
Huge.
Yeah,

1005
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,280
right,
but does that guy work out?

1006
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:46,070
I think Ken's would probably works out
probably because you know what?

1007
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:50,760
It's certain rappers I could tell that
they work out based on this show.

1008
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:51,840
Really?
Oh,

1009
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,360
because they have energy.
Well not even just energy,

1010
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:59,130
but if you look,
especially if your songs and your lyrics

1011
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:02,880
are very dense,
where your betterment and you wrap it

1012
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:05,970
up,
that takes a lot of breath control and

1013
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:07,770
cardio.
Especially if you're not doing it.

1014
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,850
If you don't have a hype man on stage.
If you a hype man,

1015
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:15,060
the hype man is someone just isn't it?
Just the energy is so you can catch a

1016
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:18,870
breath and so he'll take those last
couple of words on a line and then you

1017
00:45:18,871 --> 00:45:22,800
catch your breath and then you come back
because a lot of people don't have the

1018
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:23,370
breath control.

1019
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,830
So a lot of times even if somebody is
not ripped,

1020
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,220
they're in shape,
they're lungs are in shape.

1021
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:32,640
If they can do a whole a whole show of
just,

1022
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,740
you know,
kind of rapid fire songs and shit.

1023
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,780
I never thought about that.
A hype man,

1024
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:37,381
Huh?
Yeah.

1025
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:39,720
That's what the hype man.
I mean as far as it's definitely they

1026
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:43,620
bring the energy up,
but a lot of times if you see a rapper

1027
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,530
and at their show and they don't have a
hype man,

1028
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,251
they're like,
you know,

1029
00:45:47,251 --> 00:45:49,830
I could spit my own shit all the way.
I don't need a hype man.

1030
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,090
Yeah,
yeah.

1031
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,670
Especially if they're fast with their
lyrics.

1032
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:55,050
Right?
Yeah.

1033
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:56,110
And Kendrick does it,
you know,

1034
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:59,370
he doesn't wrap over his own beats.
That's a pet peeve of mine,

1035
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:05,090
a lot of big rappers and they will just
wrap over the song,

1036
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,230
the actual song.

1037
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,380
Oh,
own lip sync.

1038
00:46:09,381 --> 00:46:13,350
And almost pretty much just wrap it over
the shit at their own concert.

1039
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,560
Now get sometimes if a,
say you pop up as somebody show to do a

1040
00:46:20,581 --> 00:46:23,010
guest spot as a rapper and you do your
biggest song.

1041
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:26,040
This person's Dj doesn't have your
instrumental.

1042
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,800
He only has the regular track,
the rap over that.

1043
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:30,600
But it's just show.
I don't want to hear you rap over that

1044
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:33,510
because he was just rapping over as well
produced song.

1045
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,550
I'd rather just hear this shit.
Chris being a club,

1046
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,550
right?
Yeah.

1047
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:39,120
Yeah.
Just otherwise you're just seeing their

1048
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:41,400
presence.
That's just it.

1049
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,780
I mean it's still,
you know,

1050
00:46:42,781 --> 00:46:44,970
it's still fun,
but it's just not when you,

1051
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,530
when you know what the alternative is,
which is you being a good polished

1052
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,300
performance,
then you're like,

1053
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,760
come on man.
Just don't wrap up your shit.

1054
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,210
Yeah.

1055
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,950
That's a weird pop thing.
Right?

1056
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,350
Pop singers are kind of allowed to do
that.

1057
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,000
We know they do it,
but when they get busted,

1058
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:02,220
it's a huge deal.
Like what was the girl Ashley?

1059
00:47:02,221 --> 00:47:03,054
What the fuck?
Nationally,

1060
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:06,120
Samsung.
That was a big disaster,

1061
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:08,580
right?
She kind of vanished after that for that

1062
00:47:08,581 --> 00:47:10,520
too bad timing.
Yeah.

1063
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,920
She had a show.
They're trying to ramp her up on on TV.

1064
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:16,650
Like the diary of it.
Oh yeah.

1065
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,960
They pulled up.
Pulled the plug on that fucker.

1066
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,180
That's it for her.
Yeah.

1067
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,500
I ever heard about her again.
Not really.

1068
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:23,850
Not really round.
Sorry.

1069
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:28,350
The party.
That was like 15 years ago,

1070
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:29,590
right?
At least

1071
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,420
15.
I think it might've been like easy to

1072
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,930
easy to where I worked in 2009,
so the couple years before the Atacama

1073
00:47:38,931 --> 00:47:41,960
guest.
Oh six for my mom looking at what is it?

1074
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:45,550
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

1075
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,980
Damn.
Thirteen fucking years time and we'll

1076
00:47:48,981 --> 00:47:51,970
fly.
He does not wait for you.

1077
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:53,650
You got to be.
Yeah.

1078
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:58,210
If you're going to be a person who sings
on stage and moves around on stage and

1079
00:47:58,211 --> 00:48:00,070
you're not going to be going over your
track,

1080
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,900
you have to be in some serious shape
yet.

1081
00:48:02,901 --> 00:48:07,901
It's a to put on a solid show.
Thomas is no music and you just fucking

1082
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:14,070
rebroke
breaking our music now,

1083
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:16,050
but nobody know where to find out.
Yeah,

1084
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:21,060
but this is December 14th.
Two thousand 16 this shit out yet.

1085
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:22,510
She said 45.
Now look at her.

1086
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:27,511
She's got kids and had a whole yoga.
She found she found value in other

1087
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:31,660
things besides show business.
He got to go for probably a good move

1088
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:32,830
for some people,
you know,

1089
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,070
just get out now.
We were looking at um,

1090
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,290
what the fuck's his name?
Mick Jagger's routine.

1091
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,600
Like Mick Jagger's,
185 years old.

1092
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:43,900
And that dude works out twice a day.
Yeah.

1093
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:45,970
Like he does yoga,
he lifts weights.

1094
00:48:45,971 --> 00:48:47,370
He has trainers.
I kid,

1095
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,780
he's just doing everything to try to
keep his body together.

1096
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:55,110
Like Bang.
And then might want to keep fucking

1097
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,430
supermodels.

1098
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,020
Is this girl like 27?
Yeah,

1099
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:05,230
he's got like a 18 year old girl.
I trained five,

1100
00:49:05,231 --> 00:49:07,240
six days a week,
but I don't go crazy.

1101
00:49:07,241 --> 00:49:09,490
I alternate between gym work and
dancing.

1102
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:11,290
Then I do sprints,
things like that.

1103
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,990
I'm training for stamina.
He shredded though.

1104
00:49:13,991 --> 00:49:18,390
They had a picture of like Mick Jagger,
like his body eight miles a day.

1105
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,960
Damn.
He runs eight miles a day.

1106
00:49:19,961 --> 00:49:21,940
Swimming,
kickboxing and cycling.

1107
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:24,370
How old is he?
He's got to be like 72.

1108
00:49:24,371 --> 00:49:26,550
Right.
Let's.

1109
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,630
Let's take a guess.
How old do you think Mick Jagger is?

1110
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:29,411
He's.
Yeah,

1111
00:49:29,411 --> 00:49:31,540
he's 77 I think.
Seventy two.

1112
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,020
Good.
Yeah.

1113
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:32,950
Seventy two.
Seventy three.

1114
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:37,951
I remember seeing something when we were
kids.

1115
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:40,960
Seventy two year olds were dead.
Absolutely.

1116
00:49:40,961 --> 00:49:43,130
There was nothing left and like you,
you had,

1117
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,360
you were on empty.
Your body was 74.

1118
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:48,670
He's almost 80.
Was almost 100.

1119
00:49:48,671 --> 00:49:53,671
Then how long is he gonna live a
hambrick.

1120
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:00,070
How does melon otherwise girlfriend look
at her hot as fuck.

1121
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,800
She's Mickey Dirty Dick.
She's just turned 30 and he knocked her

1122
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:09,940
up,
right?

1123
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,540
Didn't he shoot a live one in there?
Yeah.

1124
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:16,470
What are the odds that kid's going to
come out and not have super powers?

1125
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,560
All this stuff that he's taken this to
stay young.

1126
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:23,170
Wow,
that's crazy.

1127
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,080
Thirty years old.
Here's what I want.

1128
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:29,090
Mick Jagger,
because of the baby.

1129
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,950
Giant head look.
The kid can read minds.

1130
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:35,090
The kids heads filled with vitamins and
anti aging serum.

1131
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:37,040
Look at her.
She's like,

1132
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,750
Yo,
Daddy's 70 foot.

1133
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,420
Yeah,
Daddy's older.

1134
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:43,190
Didn't the president.
We have to find you a positive role

1135
00:50:43,191 --> 00:50:46,670
model because your daddy probably won't
be around very much longer.

1136
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:51,910
Have you heard of Maroon five at all
when you're 74 and you're having a kid

1137
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:58,271
that is super ambitious,
like you're optimistic as fuck to be 74

1138
00:50:58,761 --> 00:51:00,210
and have a kid?
Yeah.

1139
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,360
I'm,
I'm 34 and I'm like,

1140
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:03,470
oh,
I need to get.

1141
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:05,680
If I'm going to have kids I need to get
it in next.

1142
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:08,000
Something happened in the next couple of
years.

1143
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:09,050
Yeah,
that's a good move.

1144
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,860
But I would never.
Seventy four of brand new one.

1145
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,230
Yeah.
That's super bold.

1146
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,790
I guess it's just,
you know,

1147
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,220
you know,
he's got a great story by that.

1148
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,820
You know Theo Vaughn,
do you know thea?

1149
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,430
Hilarious dude.
He's fucking hilarious.

1150
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,950
Uh,
his dad was like in his seventies when

1151
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:29,270
he had him and he's got hilarious
stories about going to school and like

1152
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:31,810
telling people that's his grandpa and
being embarrassed.

1153
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,790
It's his dad.
His Dad was fair falling asleep

1154
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,040
everywhere.
It sounds like fair behavior for a kid

1155
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,220
who's j dot jaggers.
This girl is first kids 45.

1156
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:42,350
Jesus Christ.
Man.

1157
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:47,040
This first kid could be,
his girlfriend's mom might have an older

1158
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:48,830
one too.
Oh Man.

1159
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,690
Is He married to the girl?
The new girl?

1160
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,750
It says spouse.
So he's probably like,

1161
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,320
why not?
I'll get married.

1162
00:51:57,321 --> 00:52:02,120
We don't give a fuck.
Take my partner partner even better.

1163
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:05,060
That's how it needs to give him my money
to my kids.

1164
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:10,520
Partner means fool me twice.
Shame on me three times.

1165
00:52:10,521 --> 00:52:12,180
I'm senile.
Oh,

1166
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,500
move in and collect on my estate.
His lover.

1167
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,710
Lover.
Isn't that funny that we have like

1168
00:52:18,711 --> 00:52:22,580
distinctions like did you or did you not
scribble on the paper?

1169
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:26,300
It's just did you or did you not agree
to some stupid shit that doesn't make

1170
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:28,010
any sense financially.
Juha digital.

1171
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:33,770
Is your estate at stake with this
relationship or not?

1172
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,420
Can you just shoot it

1173
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:39,100
loads in her random or willy nilly or
does she have access to half of your

1174
00:52:39,101 --> 00:52:40,420
money?
Let me know what.

1175
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,730
Nope,
she doesn't let me know what's going on.

1176
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:44,110
What's the deal?
What kind of deal would you guys make

1177
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:45,080
that's,
uh,

1178
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:45,970
that,
that deal?

1179
00:52:45,971 --> 00:52:48,700
It's just so weird.
I have a friend that is a super rich

1180
00:52:48,701 --> 00:52:52,270
dude and he was getting married,
his wife did not want a prenuptial and

1181
00:52:52,271 --> 00:52:53,620
he was like,
well this is crazy.

1182
00:52:53,621 --> 00:52:56,620
Like why wouldn't I get a prenuptial?
Like if we stay together,

1183
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,610
like we don't have to worry about
anything because you know,

1184
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:01,030
you'll,
you'll be fine,

1185
00:53:01,031 --> 00:53:02,890
you'll have plenty of money.
But if we break up,

1186
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:06,100
why would I be in a situation where you
could get half my money?

1187
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:08,330
She goes,
you don't think this relationship is

1188
00:53:08,331 --> 00:53:09,430
going to last.
That's why it was.

1189
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,930
No,
I think it's going to last.

1190
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:13,250
That's why I want a prenuptial
[inaudible] it's not going matter.

1191
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,273
Right.

1192
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,520
And if,
if,

1193
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,790
if it doesn't last,
let's work out a side deal that isn't,

1194
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,160
that have.
Yeah.

1195
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,350
You can't just hold that over me.
Like,

1196
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:26,140
well his ex wife held it over like

1197
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,920
they,
he didn't have a prenup and when they

1198
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:32,520
got divorced it was a disaster.
And so then he was going into a second

1199
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:35,130
marriage and this lady was like,
I don't want a prenup.

1200
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,153
And he was like,
what?

1201
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:40,080
I've already done this like the fuck out
of here.

1202
00:53:40,081 --> 00:53:43,200
So tough Combo works out.
It works out.

1203
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,950
Yeah,
that's a heavy.

1204
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:50,970
I've had some heavy combos in my life,
but that's one of the ones where were

1205
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:53,450
kicking it for a couple years.
But uh,

1206
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,460
yeah,
I don't want you to just in case this

1207
00:53:55,461 --> 00:53:58,220
goes poorly,
let's just get this out of the way real

1208
00:53:58,221 --> 00:53:59,200
quick.
Careful.

1209
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,500
Like what stage of the relationship

1210
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:02,350
chip you do this too because in the
beginning,

1211
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,300
like if you decide to get married after
like six months,

1212
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,460
you're like,
you're on drugs,

1213
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,200
right?
You're blessed,

1214
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,870
you're blessed out.
He can't believe the relationships

1215
00:54:10,871 --> 00:54:12,370
working so well.
It's amazing.

1216
00:54:12,371 --> 00:54:13,960
She's incredible.
She's my life.

1217
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:16,210
She's my partner,
she's my soul.

1218
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,220
She's my partner.
She's everything to me.

1219
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,290
Then you just get sick of each other.
About two,

1220
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:23,950
three years in and then with the seven
year itch,

1221
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,130
you know,
that seven year itch starts talking to a

1222
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:28,480
lawyer and she goes,
okay,

1223
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:29,470
listen,
let's just.

1224
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:33,070
If we,
if I get divorced now and then the

1225
00:54:33,071 --> 00:54:33,904
lawyer goes,
well,

1226
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,250
how much money is he making now?
Does he have any other financial

1227
00:54:36,251 --> 00:54:39,370
opportunities that are on the table that
could perhaps increases walt over the

1228
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:42,250
next few years because you might want to
hang in there for a few start thinking

1229
00:54:42,251 --> 00:54:43,150
about it.
Mercenary,

1230
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:45,550
like,
like if I just get to 11 years,

1231
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:49,540
if I get to 11 years,
then he gets the CEO position and starts

1232
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:52,690
making x amount of money.
Terrible.

1233
00:54:55,030 --> 00:55:00,030
I did have living in a house with a
woman and then she starts hating you or

1234
00:55:02,031 --> 00:55:05,080
resenting you at some point and then
starts plotting,

1235
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:09,670
leaving.
We're all just still says living in the

1236
00:55:09,671 --> 00:55:11,050
house,
hey honey,

1237
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:13,180
blah blah blah,
and then just just going through the

1238
00:55:13,181 --> 00:55:15,550
motions of what a marriage is supposed
to be.

1239
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:20,990
Secretly gonna end it and she kinda
knows exactly what she's going to end

1240
00:55:20,991 --> 00:55:23,230
it.
That sounds terrifying.

1241
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,810
It's terrifying,
but it's also adorable.

1242
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:29,260
It makes me laugh.
Makes me laugh because it's so silly

1243
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,060
because it's such a human thing like
it's not.

1244
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:34,280
It's.
It's such a cultural and a human thing

1245
00:55:34,281 --> 00:55:39,281
and it's this weird lottery like this.
The reason why men are attractive to

1246
00:55:39,531 --> 00:55:41,360
women at all,
when they're really wealthy,

1247
00:55:41,361 --> 00:55:44,090
if they're gross,
gross dude,

1248
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:44,991
like,
who's that guy?

1249
00:55:44,991 --> 00:55:46,850
Rupert Murdoch,
the guy who owns Fox.

1250
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:47,870
Yeah.
He's like,

1251
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:51,440
he's old as fuck.
He doesn't take care of his body's kind

1252
00:55:51,441 --> 00:55:54,230
of like.
But he's got this hot wife,

1253
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,490
right?
There's something.

1254
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,120
There's something adorable about that
because this,

1255
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:01,790
this is this weird human folly

1256
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,830
thing we got going on.
Security and all that shit.

1257
00:56:05,831 --> 00:56:08,590
It's a little bit of that lower empower,
blah blah blah.

1258
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,890
But it's also us scam.

1259
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:14,870
And what's interesting is a guy like
that becomes attractive because he's

1260
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,000
wealthy and the woman's not wealthy,
right?

1261
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:19,040
You got assume if she's worth a billion
dollars,

1262
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:21,290
he wouldn't be attracted.
She just start fucking her personal

1263
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,440
trainer and I'm buying a Ferrari,
honey,

1264
00:56:23,441 --> 00:56:24,370
eat mommy's Pissy,
you know,

1265
00:56:24,371 --> 00:56:27,430
like that kind of shit.
But if you get to a situation where you

1266
00:56:27,431 --> 00:56:30,580
find this old dude and you know,
well,

1267
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:33,280
he's just really kind to me and other
young guys,

1268
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:36,220
they just wanted to have sex and leave
me and he just takes care of me.

1269
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:39,150
And then what does that does that Rupert
Murdoch,

1270
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,050
secretary of the Treasury,
Munch and.

1271
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,940
Oh yeah,
he's got a banging hot wife.

1272
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,710
Yeah,
that's the lady that got in trouble

1273
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:47,830
because she was tweeting about all the
different clothes and things she had on

1274
00:56:47,831 --> 00:56:49,360
a,
on a government trip.

1275
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,770
She's on a government jet and she's like
tagging all the bag.

1276
00:56:53,771 --> 00:56:56,860
She wears the shoes.
She wears it and she's

1277
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:00,080
smoking and he

1278
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:03,680
like.
He looks like her dad easily.

1279
00:57:03,681 --> 00:57:08,190
Right.
Doesn't mean for sure he's gross switch.

1280
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:14,560
When you think about how many people
have lost every jobs and money because

1281
00:57:14,871 --> 00:57:18,930
of twitter is really fascinating.
I've had a situation happened because of

1282
00:57:18,931 --> 00:57:19,600
it,
but nothing.

1283
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,540
I haven't done any.
I haven't had a stupid as social media

1284
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:27,740
blow up when you're thinking about how
insane it is with that,

1285
00:57:27,741 --> 00:57:32,741
with this is a media where you can
literally control every single word you

1286
00:57:35,091 --> 00:57:40,091
say and you still say some wild shit
that costs you millions of dollars,

1287
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,140
will cost you relationships

1288
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,880
around your friends you don't think
twice about.

1289
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,290
And he said it online.
What I was going to say about these rich

1290
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:52,500
women though,
is that like when you're a wealthy man

1291
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:55,500
and the woman's not wealthy,
the fact that you're wealthy is

1292
00:57:55,501 --> 00:57:59,100
attractive,
but then if she marries you,

1293
00:57:59,100 --> 00:57:59,870
oh,

1294
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:03,470
she's rich to now,
now you're just a dude and now you're

1295
00:58:03,471 --> 00:58:06,020
gross,
and now she wants to stay rich.

1296
00:58:06,021 --> 00:58:10,070
So she has just kind of hang in there
and are you talking to me out of getting

1297
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:10,960
married,
trying to.

1298
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:17,540
I always tell people
it's one day won't be around one day.

1299
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:21,200
Marriage won't be a thing.
It's going to take time.

1300
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,540
You know,
I spend my money on,

1301
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:26,960
I do random,
which I was,

1302
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:30,110
uh,
I was caught in a weird Internet

1303
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:35,150
wormhole last week.
I was a little high and on some adderall

1304
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:38,960
and I clicked on it.
And on adderall or high on adderall,

1305
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:41,360
high on weed and all that.
Jesus,

1306
00:58:41,361 --> 00:58:43,530
what's that like?
It's great because it's a,

1307
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,650
you have to focus that energy of
adderall,

1308
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:48,380
but the creativity of week,
Ooh,

1309
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,900
that's a good Combo,
right?

1310
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,410
Like that.
Is that how you write?

1311
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,980
I was planning to write,
but I just took some different times on

1312
00:58:54,981 --> 00:58:57,260
the internet than I would normally take.
I should have written,

1313
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:59,540
but it's just when you,
when you take adderall,

1314
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,230
which is supposed to do is when you take
it,

1315
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,920
you're supposed to get settled with what
you want to work on right away and then

1316
00:59:09,141 --> 00:59:12,290
when it kicks in,
you focus in on it versus you know,

1317
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:16,370
I think when my shit kicked in,
I was just on the Internet so I just

1318
00:59:16,371 --> 00:59:17,960
really dug deep into the Internet.
And so,

1319
00:59:17,961 --> 00:59:21,140
uh,
there was this article,

1320
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,010
this guy

1321
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,980
on this,
this comedian that has all these funny

1322
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:26,920
tweets.
And so I started looking at his tweets.

1323
00:59:26,921 --> 00:59:27,830
Yeah.
Good tweets.

1324
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,720
And then when his tweet said,
uh,

1325
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,060
I'm a,
uh,

1326
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:36,530
helped my friend go to wrestling school
and it was just this young woman that

1327
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,100
wants to go to restless.
She wants to go to pro wrestling the

1328
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:43,980
scope.
And I went to wwe smackdown a couple of

1329
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:45,980
days prior.
So wrestling was Kinda on my brain.

1330
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:50,360
So she got a go fund me and I just paid
for her wrestling school.

1331
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:54,280
Never met him.
I ain't got no cars,

1332
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:59,320
Joe Hall and we'd just adderall weed and
income and just pay for some random

1333
01:00:02,561 --> 01:00:04,990
restless school though.
You just uber everywhere?

1334
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,810
Uh,
yeah.

1335
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,770
Well I rent cars some places,
but yeah,

1336
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:13,030
when I'm in La,
a uber or lyft around where you live in

1337
01:00:13,031 --> 01:00:14,680
Chicago,
I'll get a,

1338
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,380
I'll get a rental,
but I'm not there that much.

1339
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,360
Even though I,
my residence in Chicago now,

1340
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:24,390
I'm still not going to read a lot.
And so for my own frugality I can't

1341
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:29,550
justify having a car yet.
I am wondering that's an interest in

1342
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,930
going to get one.
So I'm a breakout of it.

1343
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:36,550
My Dad is super cheap and so that's just
kinda his brother still.

1344
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:41,580
I'm lightly extravagant and cheap and
practical at the same second extravagant

1345
01:00:42,311 --> 01:00:43,144
watch.
What is that?

1346
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,510
This is a,
I don't know the name for Berrera.

1347
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,750
It's beautiful.
I bought it because I was hyped before I

1348
01:00:49,751 --> 01:00:54,751
was a shopping before I did some shows
at radio city with Chappelle and so I

1349
01:00:55,091 --> 01:00:56,730
was right before sound check.
I was,

1350
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,890
I need to buy a shirt.
I bought a nice shirt and then I'm like,

1351
01:00:59,891 --> 01:01:00,401
fuck it.
I'm gonna.

1352
01:01:00,401 --> 01:01:01,880
Get a nice watch.
And it wasn't.

1353
01:01:01,881 --> 01:01:02,621
It's that,
that crazy.

1354
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:06,270
It was like 700 bucks or some shit.
Yes.

1355
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,210
Mr. Bull.
Yeah,

1356
01:01:07,211 --> 01:01:09,700
it's a reasonable.
It's too much for a watch,

1357
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:10,810
but not yet

1358
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:11,970
stupid without.
See.

1359
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:14,170
That's the one thing that fucks me up
about watches.

1360
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:16,240
Like if you told me that watch was 10
grand,

1361
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:17,260
I'd be like,
okay.

1362
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,640
Like it's the same thing.
Yeah,

1363
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,680
it looks like it could be a 10 grand
watch.

1364
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,180
Right.
Watches are weird.

1365
01:01:22,181 --> 01:01:26,590
Like that was a weird,
but it just kinda pop on stage a little

1366
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,120
bit and it's,
you know,

1367
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:30,970
it's a bracelet with the time.
Yeah.

1368
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:32,710
Did you see that floyd mayweather
watched?

1369
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:35,500
We were talking about the La Ferrari.
That's all crystal.

1370
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:38,320
600.
Looks like some futuristic shit.

1371
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:40,680
It looks 600 grand on a lot.
600.

1372
01:01:40,681 --> 01:01:42,730
See I could never,
never.

1373
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:46,450
Yeah.
Still even still now when I have this,

1374
01:01:46,451 --> 01:01:49,270
I'd be like 700 bucks on this.
Jesus Christ.

1375
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,140
Guess what?
You had a book that Gig and Boise to

1376
01:01:53,141 --> 01:01:56,830
cover this shit can be doing this gun
ended up on 30 for 30.

1377
01:01:56,831 --> 01:01:59,680
Broke that what?
What kind of car are you going to get?

1378
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,020
I think I like the Tesla.
Oh,

1379
01:02:02,021 --> 01:02:02,750
okay.
Yeah.

1380
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:03,790
To go electric.
Yeah.

1381
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:06,140
Like just if you have to get out of town
quick and there's,

1382
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,910
you have to hope that there's
electricity out of town quick.

1383
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,830
Yeah.
Like what if some shit goes down like

1384
01:02:11,831 --> 01:02:13,420
within some sort of an earthquake or
something?

1385
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:16,150
Uh,
I'll guess I'll just get somebody else's

1386
01:02:16,151 --> 01:02:18,230
car.
I mean I've got friends and shit and I'm

1387
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:19,650
sure that'd be leaving.
So

1388
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,590
hop a ride.
Yeah.

1389
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:24,570
The thing about Tesla's,
it gets me,

1390
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:25,920
I love them.
I think they're great,

1391
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:29,070
but you really can only drive them 250
miles.

1392
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,780
Yeah.
I don't give a fuck what they say.

1393
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,390
And even that,
you better be driving slow because if

1394
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:35,430
you're driving fast or if you drive it
in traffic.

1395
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:40,700
Like my business manager came out to
Anaheim for the UFC and he drove from a

1396
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,870
Hollywood to Anaheim and his shit was
dead by the time we got to Anaheim.

1397
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,370
Oh,
because there's traffic.

1398
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:48,450
Yeah.
So he,

1399
01:02:48,451 --> 01:02:50,130
uh,
he was stuck in traffic and it was no

1400
01:02:50,131 --> 01:02:53,410
like shit on the,
off the road he had to find a super

1401
01:02:53,411 --> 01:02:55,800
station.
So you got to go sit there for a half an

1402
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,970
hour at the super station and when you
do that it's fills up to like 75 percent

1403
01:02:59,971 --> 01:03:01,300
or something like that.
Oh yeah.

1404
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:03,230
That part's a little bit while

1405
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,473
drive it.
No,

1406
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:09,740
maybe I'll get a used car that's
practical for the apocalypse.

1407
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:15,010
Why don't you get like a hybrid,
a lexus hybrid.

1408
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,681
Hybrid.
Yeah.

1409
01:03:15,681 --> 01:03:18,200
Those are the shit.
And then you can operate.

1410
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,510
I think they have a switch where you
could operate.

1411
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,890
I know they have that for the Acura Nsx,
that new NSX.

1412
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:28,930
They have an all electric mode where you
could drive a totally electric call.

1413
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,900
You hit all the switches and it's
warmer.

1414
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:33,890
Yeah.
Then it's super fast.

1415
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:37,370
Looks fresh.
You know what A.

1416
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:38,293
Yeah.
There you go.

1417
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,200
Lexus,
Lexus.

1418
01:03:39,201 --> 01:03:41,480
Hybrid,
that's a bad ass car to that coop

1419
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:43,910
because it's um,
it's sporty,

1420
01:03:43,911 --> 01:03:47,630
but it's just understated enough where
you're not driving a Ferrari or a

1421
01:03:47,631 --> 01:03:49,910
porsche or something like that.
But it's bad ass car.

1422
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:51,390
That one right there.
That.

1423
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:52,880
What does that,
the ls.

1424
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:55,010
Lch.
Yeah.

1425
01:03:55,011 --> 01:03:56,410
It's a bad ass car.
Yeah,

1426
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:00,390
baby.
That's what you need to get yourself one

1427
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:01,880
of those.
Look at that thing.

1428
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,440
That's slick.
That's pretty slick.

1429
01:04:03,441 --> 01:04:05,910
Good looking car.
And you know what I like about lexuses,

1430
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:07,910
man,
they just never break.

1431
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,950
I'm,
this is my second lexis that I have

1432
01:04:09,951 --> 01:04:13,400
right now and I've never had a single
fucking problem with them.

1433
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:16,580
Those things just never break.
You just drive them.

1434
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:20,030
They never go wrong.
Customer service is fantastic.

1435
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:25,220
They have the best customer service in
any car I've ever had and they're like

1436
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:28,280
deer flashy,
but they're not impressing a rapper,

1437
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,820
you know what I mean?
You don't know what type of rapper

1438
01:04:30,821 --> 01:04:31,670
though.
Yeah,

1439
01:04:31,671 --> 01:04:33,840
that's true,
right?

1440
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,940
It was like A.
Yeah,

1441
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:38,260
like de la soul.
They'd probably be impressed

1442
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:42,600
young jeezy by looking at the books.

1443
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,420
You know,
I did this week,

1444
01:04:44,421 --> 01:04:45,254
I,
uh,

1445
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:50,120
I donated some money to Red Cross for
the Houston thing.

1446
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:55,270
People get mad at you for that and then
I remembered right away about the Red

1447
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:59,150
Cross shit.
It was like a knee jerk donation and

1448
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:04,180
donate to the Houston food bank also.
But then I remembered about the shit

1449
01:05:04,911 --> 01:05:09,911
with how they handled the Haiti funds
and Katrina and then I emailed because

1450
01:05:10,611 --> 01:05:12,680
it was through Amazon payments.
I was like,

1451
01:05:12,681 --> 01:05:13,514
Hey,
uh,

1452
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:17,290
can I get that money back please?
I want to just give it to some other

1453
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:18,520
source.
Oh,

1454
01:05:18,521 --> 01:05:21,480
did you really asked?
I haven't got a response,

1455
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:25,210
but it was just a,
it was one of the weirdest.

1456
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,390
Now a top 10 weird emails I've sent.
Well,

1457
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:31,680
I asked for a donation back.
Yeah,

1458
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:32,620
that's slippery.
Right.

1459
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:35,890
I wanted back though,
because I don't because they,

1460
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:38,170
uh,
I think it'd be better for some,

1461
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,000
uh,
some,

1462
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:44,080
uh,
organizations on the ground is one Texas

1463
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:49,240
the Texas diaper because everybody need
diapers and they're based in San

1464
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:49,240
Antonio.

1465
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:54,240
So you can just sit and I just went on
Amazon and just sent a grand worth of

1466
01:05:54,781 --> 01:05:59,020
diapers just because that made me feel
good because it's super specific and you

1467
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:01,720
can't really get to fraudulent with
diapers.

1468
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:03,820
That's what I mean.
That's a good way of looking at it.

1469
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,430
Like with product you just send the
product.

1470
01:06:06,431 --> 01:06:09,280
I mean maybe somebody worst case
scenario somebody steals it,

1471
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:12,550
but for the most part if you send in a
healthful product,

1472
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:15,340
that money,
that shit is getting broken up.

1473
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:18,820
Some of that should go on to the morgue
and some of that shit go to like ink.

1474
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,800
Yeah.
It's weird because I guess affective

1475
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:25,200
charities have operating costs.
There's no way to.

1476
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:27,800
People got to get back to.
People have to get paid,

1477
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:32,810
you have to pay for logistics and
planning and and the Red Cross obviously

1478
01:06:33,741 --> 01:06:35,630
does a lot of good.
There's no,

1479
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:37,370
no doubt.
They do a lot of good and people just

1480
01:06:37,371 --> 01:06:40,070
get mad at the accounting thing.
Like how much of the money goes,

1481
01:06:40,071 --> 01:06:43,580
like know on it.
We donated money to the Red Cross for

1482
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:46,790
Harvey,
for Hurricane Harvey and people were

1483
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:47,431
like,
Yo,

1484
01:06:47,431 --> 01:06:52,040
the fucking Red Cross a terrible place
to donate money and you want to say

1485
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:52,600
that,
right?

1486
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,160
People want to say that?
Yeah.

1487
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:58,340
What is the best thing to donate my.
I'd like to know what the best thing to

1488
01:06:58,341 --> 01:06:59,560
donate for.
Like Harvey,

1489
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:01,240
I guess.
Um,

1490
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,630
I didn't.
Houston food bank at Texas diaper thing.

1491
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:09,430
Houston food bank sounds like a good a
j.

1492
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:11,760
j.
j watt has one.

1493
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:16,220
The guy he plays for the Houston,
Texas is a few other ones that are on

1494
01:07:16,221 --> 01:07:21,221
the ground and in Houston or in
the area where red crosses,

1495
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:26,690
you know,
I mean there obviously I know they have

1496
01:07:26,691 --> 01:07:29,810
people on the ground,
but it's pretty general.

1497
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:30,721
So yeah,
they,

1498
01:07:30,721 --> 01:07:34,740
they handle a lot of different things,
but they do a lot of good to like,

1499
01:07:34,741 --> 01:07:37,230
there's no denying that the Red Cross
does a lot of good,

1500
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,060
but it's,
it's that whole accounting thing when

1501
01:07:40,061 --> 01:07:41,490
people get mad.
It's funny man,

1502
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,040
because there's a lot of people just
waiting to get mad at something.

1503
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:46,110
Even get mad at where you're donating
your money.

1504
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:51,160
Well I think it's just.
I think the issue is that from the

1505
01:07:51,951 --> 01:07:55,910
little research I did on it,
that Red Cross hasn't had full

1506
01:07:55,911 --> 01:08:00,911
transparency with how I think people
want to know if you give a dollar to Red

1507
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:07,120
Cross,
what percentage goes to this weapon

1508
01:08:07,121 --> 01:08:10,430
centers goes to this episode,
this goes to this and I don't think they

1509
01:08:10,431 --> 01:08:13,670
offer that and that makes people feel
like they're getting shysters.

1510
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,880
Do you think that's because they've been
around so long to like Red Cross has

1511
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:20,000
been around for like how many years ago?
One hundred years.

1512
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:20,840
Probably something.
Right.

1513
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:24,440
And it wasn't until the Internet came
along that these questions even came up,

1514
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:27,230
but that people demanded transparency
probably want to.

1515
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:32,540
I think it's just because they haven't
been that many results from the Haiti

1516
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:36,500
earthquake where people don't see
tangible results.

1517
01:08:36,501 --> 01:08:41,220
And I know I donated a bunch on the
phone texting to,

1518
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:42,340
to uh,
you know,

1519
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:45,740
I don't know why clef was doing Red
Cross thing if he was doing something

1520
01:08:45,741 --> 01:08:48,560
separate,
but I texted a lot just donate when that

1521
01:08:48,561 --> 01:08:51,020
happened.
And so I think it's just when people

1522
01:08:51,021 --> 01:08:53,840
don't see results for the money,
it's just like,

1523
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:54,990
you know,
they want to,

1524
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,670
especially if you just try to help
something in that,

1525
01:08:57,671 --> 01:09:02,671
I think that's what makes it worse for
people where if you try to help and you

1526
01:09:03,711 --> 01:09:07,880
donated money to help and you don't
really see the results of it,

1527
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:08,960
then you're like,
what the fuck?

1528
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,190
Yeah,
the Haiti things,

1529
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:15,930
it's almost like the infrastructure was
so fucked up and there was so much

1530
01:09:15,931 --> 01:09:20,820
damage done down there that you would
need untold billions of dollars to fix

1531
01:09:20,821 --> 01:09:23,310
everything.
It's like when you donate millions,

1532
01:09:23,311 --> 01:09:25,170
it's like barely even going to see any
results.

1533
01:09:25,171 --> 01:09:28,350
Like I wonder how much,
how much damage was actually done to

1534
01:09:28,351 --> 01:09:30,420
hate.
You've got to wonder about Houston.

1535
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:34,440
I mean you're talking about Houston
being just catastrophic to the point

1536
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:36,150
where some places are never going to
recover

1537
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:39,510
is uh,
is pretty messed up.

1538
01:09:39,511 --> 01:09:41,020
Man.
It's raining right now.

1539
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:46,510
Still raining.
And they were saying how about how the

1540
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:53,880
constant development that they've been
doing there was part of the reason why

1541
01:09:54,611 --> 01:09:59,611
the flood,
it hit harder because they developed on

1542
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:04,170
prairie grass,
so certain land where this land might

1543
01:10:04,171 --> 01:10:07,660
have soaked up some of that.
I mean we probably would have still

1544
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:11,500
flooded but it might have been less
severe if there wasn't needs because the

1545
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:13,420
next is a new development.

1546
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:15,870
Yeah,
I saw that where they're saying that by

1547
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,810
paving over these areas,
those,

1548
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:19,650
those areas can no longer absorb the
water.

1549
01:10:19,651 --> 01:10:21,910
But it seems like you're talking about
the.

1550
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:25,050
Did you ever see the graphic that shows
the difference between the amount of

1551
01:10:25,051 --> 01:10:28,650
water that rained down on Hurricane
Katrina versus the amount of water that

1552
01:10:28,651 --> 01:10:32,280
rained down so far on harvey?
Not even including today.

1553
01:10:32,281 --> 01:10:33,900
And it's going to rain apparently
tomorrow too.

1554
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:35,480
I think shit,
it's,

1555
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,990
it's so much more water than.
Could you look at the difference for 10

1556
01:10:39,991 --> 01:10:44,520
to 15 trillion gallons as of August
28th.

1557
01:10:44,521 --> 01:10:45,870
And what is today?
The 29th,

1558
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:48,000
the 30th.
Today's the 30th.

1559
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:52,740
So that's two days ago of rain.
And then Katrina is only six point 5

1560
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:53,431
trillion gallons.
I mean,

1561
01:10:53,431 --> 01:10:54,360
that's amazing.

1562
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:57,090
I mean that's A.
I mean I'm sure there's people that

1563
01:10:57,510 --> 01:11:01,080
dedicate their lives to this,
but how do you count that they're out

1564
01:11:01,081 --> 01:11:05,300
there with scoops?
Measuring is in cubic.

1565
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:09,030
Come on man.
Come on man.

1566
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:11,460
Beyond,
beyond like oil drums.

1567
01:11:11,461 --> 01:11:12,294
You really?
Yeah.

1568
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:14,280
Come on.
How many really know?

1569
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:19,790
It definitely looks like a lot and I
hope it seems like a of water is all

1570
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:20,920
right.

1571
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:21,970
Yeah.
Well you know,

1572
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:25,720
one of the things that I love about
tragedies is when people come together

1573
01:11:25,721 --> 01:11:29,260
and help each other out and one of the
things is liver is a line of fishing

1574
01:11:29,261 --> 01:11:32,680
boats of dudes pulling fishing boats to
go and rescue people.

1575
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:36,970
It was like a whole line on the highway
of dudes with trucks pulling fishing

1576
01:11:36,971 --> 01:11:41,320
boats and they were dropping them off
and they were driving their boat rather

1577
01:11:41,321 --> 01:11:45,780
ride in their boat down these flooded
roads and rescuing people and bringing

1578
01:11:45,781 --> 01:11:48,940
them to safety.
That kind of shit makes me so happy.

1579
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:50,980
That's one of the fucked up things about
people's.

1580
01:11:50,981 --> 01:11:55,420
Like sometimes a bad thing makes people
see the good in people.

1581
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,070
It makes people do good things,

1582
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,090
definitely.
But how,

1583
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:04,870
how insane.
Just the juxtaposition.

1584
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:10,300
Does that have to be to like you and
your crib as watching a show on Sunday,

1585
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,520
relaxing,
you know,

1586
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:17,810
frat and then a few days later you have
to be saved by boat

1587
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:20,950
from this,
from this,

1588
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:24,130
from this place where you usually just
walk out and get the mail.

1589
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,240
You have to.
Somebody has to pull up with a boat.

1590
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:30,810
That's insane.
They said it's okay

1591
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:35,470
once every 500 year storm too.
But how the fuck do they known that 500

1592
01:12:35,471 --> 01:12:38,080
years ago people wrote shit down.
Park,

1593
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,150
you know,
they,

1594
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:42,610
they,
they showed like raindrops and skulls.

1595
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:46,790
What is that?
People House saved her with a jet ski.

1596
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,570
Wow.
Um,

1597
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,030
that's is

1598
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:53,440
my friend's grandmother being jet skied
out of her living room in Houston.

1599
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,580
What about y'all though?
What A.

1600
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:57,730
Wow.
That house is fucked.

1601
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,990
There's a lot of fucked houses.
You other thing about Houston too,

1602
01:13:00,991 --> 01:13:04,070
is Houston so damp like Houston in the
summertime,

1603
01:13:04,071 --> 01:13:06,700
it's so moist.
That means they're going to have crazy

1604
01:13:06,701 --> 01:13:09,790
mold growth there.
Mold is going to be off the charts and

1605
01:13:09,791 --> 01:13:12,690
that shit makes people sick as fuck.
Like A.

1606
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,790
I've had a friend in Austin,
his whole,

1607
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:18,250
his house had to be gutted because he
was getting sick and they couldn't

1608
01:13:18,251 --> 01:13:22,270
figure out what was wrong and they came
in and did some sort of a test of the

1609
01:13:22,271 --> 01:13:23,430
air and they're like,
dude,

1610
01:13:23,431 --> 01:13:27,660
you're house is infested.
And so they broke down his walls and

1611
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:31,360
apparently there was some pipe leakage
or something inside the wall and then

1612
01:13:31,361 --> 01:13:36,060
just the general moisture of the air.
The entire walls were filled with this

1613
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:38,170
black mold and it was getting everybody
sick.

1614
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:40,460
Shit,
that shit is girls.

1615
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:41,790
Yeah,
mold is no,

1616
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:42,870
no joke,
man.

1617
01:13:42,871 --> 01:13:47,310
That black mold stuff can really fuck
you up if you're feeling shitty and your

1618
01:13:47,311 --> 01:13:49,500
house has mold in it.
You got to do something about that

1619
01:13:49,501 --> 01:13:51,660
because there's something going on there
that's a,

1620
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,760
you're.
You're literally being poisoned by

1621
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,290
house.
Damn.

1622
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,170
But Tom Lucas,
dude had that going on too in La.

1623
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:00,600
He had to get his house gutted.
He,

1624
01:14:00,601 --> 01:14:03,060
uh,
he was feeling sick for like a year and

1625
01:14:03,061 --> 01:14:06,060
then finally did something about it,
found out his house is filled with mold.

1626
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:10,290
They tear it down to the,
to the raw frame of the house and have

1627
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:12,580
to spray everything with this antifungal

1628
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:15,970
shit and Redo the whole house again.
Shit.

1629
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,980
How long was he out of the house?
Like over a year.

1630
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:23,620
I want to just says I'm reading a little
article on it says it's a black mold.

1631
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:27,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

1632
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:28,760
It just said it really had his voice
hard,

1633
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:30,970
fucked up his health.
It's no joke,

1634
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,691
man.
I mean,

1635
01:14:31,691 --> 01:14:33,070
you're,
you're breathing in these little

1636
01:14:33,071 --> 01:14:38,071
organisms mean spores are these little.
When you're thinking about mold,

1637
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,820
that's a,
like a fungus,

1638
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:42,460
right?
Those wouldn't you consider mold fungus?

1639
01:14:42,461 --> 01:14:44,380
Is that what it is?
Yeah,

1640
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:47,110
that shit is in the air and it's
poisoned.

1641
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:50,140
So you're,
you're basically breathing in toxic

1642
01:14:50,141 --> 01:14:52,060
poisoned all the time.
Yeah.

1643
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:57,330
That shit is just.
I couldn't imagine this shit man too.

1644
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:58,510
You live in Chicago,
you don't,

1645
01:14:58,690 --> 01:15:00,430
you don't care about winners.
It doesn't bother you.

1646
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:01,983
I,
uh,

1647
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:04,690
anywhere I work around it,
work around it.

1648
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,700
So a time you like,
yeah,

1649
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:08,400
animals not in town.
Where the.

1650
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:10,500
Well doing gigs in Florida.
So about.

1651
01:15:10,501 --> 01:15:11,021
Yeah,
I do,

1652
01:15:11,021 --> 01:15:13,780
I book,
I book myself like that during the

1653
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,270
winter and in Cali and Arizona,
Texas,

1654
01:15:16,271 --> 01:15:20,350
Florida,
etc. And then if I do a run and I'm

1655
01:15:20,351 --> 01:15:23,980
scheduled to come back,
but I don't have any actual thing to do

1656
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:29,130
in chicago that I need to be that foot.
I check the weAther at that shit's like

1657
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:34,050
under 25.
Didn't I just chill where I'm at?

1658
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:43,600
I just that look like that's crazy that
I call down to the front desk and say

1659
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:48,240
extended for two days please.
Oh that's a good.

1660
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:51,740
Just hang out wherever you're at.
Just hang out wherever my oh,

1661
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:54,480
go to uh,
some other warm place for a couple of.

1662
01:15:54,481 --> 01:15:56,620
That's how,
I mean this is my fIrst time being back

1663
01:15:56,621 --> 01:15:58,030
for full winter.
So that was,

1664
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:01,210
that's how I handled it this time where
I would just stay up in the life.

1665
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:03,670
It's nice man.
He lived in a nice loud clap.

1666
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:05,930
I rent my place out.
It's an apartment buildIng.

1667
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,390
I read it out when I'm not there.
Oh,

1668
01:16:07,391 --> 01:16:08,090
you do?
You're really.

1669
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:09,190
Oh,
you are frugal.

1670
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:11,650
And if people live in your house,
do you know these people know?

1671
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,690
Wow.
Airbnb stuff.

1672
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:18,760
Stuff there.
I'm pretty bare bones when I travel and

1673
01:16:18,761 --> 01:16:20,020
shit.
Just few t shirts.

1674
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:21,780
Jeans a couple of days.

1675
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:23,590
So your,
your apartment in chicago,

1676
01:16:23,591 --> 01:16:26,740
you don't keep a lot of shit there.
I keep just the basic stuff.

1677
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:30,880
Tv and the whatever you need.
If you're a traveling person,

1678
01:16:30,881 --> 01:16:34,540
if you be there and then I stayed.
When I get back,

1679
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:37,510
it's three of them I stayed with in
whichever one is open.

1680
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:39,540
I block out a couple of days.
Oh,

1681
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:41,170
you rent,
you have three apartments?

1682
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:43,120
Yeah.
Isn't one building?

1683
01:16:43,121 --> 01:16:44,710
Yeah,
that's weird.

1684
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:47,800
Three apartments in one building.
Why did you decide to do that?

1685
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,200
Because it was a.
It was.

1686
01:16:49,290 --> 01:16:51,130
I mean I got it as an investment
property.

1687
01:16:51,131 --> 01:16:53,080
I plan on getting a separate place to
stay yet,

1688
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:57,070
but that's where I stay now is when I'm
there because I'm not that much.

1689
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:00,730
That's just like move.
Do I sound like a weird,

1690
01:17:00,731 --> 01:17:02,310
crazy cheap person right now?
You sound.

1691
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:07,330
I wouldn't say cheap because you do have
a $700 watch.

1692
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,020
I would say frugal.
Frugal is the

1693
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,260
right way to approach this.
Yeah.

1694
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:14,840
Why not?
Why not?

1695
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:15,733
Why not?

1696
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:18,770
I mean,
having them sitting around not

1697
01:17:18,771 --> 01:17:20,900
generating any income doesn't do anybody
any good.

1698
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:23,370
Absolutely not.
I think it was driving me crazy.

1699
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:26,060
Yeah.
So you're doing the right thing is a

1700
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:31,550
man.
I was at a festival called afro punk,

1701
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,830
a music festival,
uh,

1702
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:38,610
and it's,
uh,

1703
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:43,670
it's just a beautiful vessel.
Was a all black artists and it's great

1704
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:47,710
and people dress up in the wildest
outfit.

1705
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:50,700
It was a fun time and met the people
that put it on.

1706
01:17:50,701 --> 01:17:53,640
I met them a few years back.
they used to come to my show at knitting

1707
01:17:53,641 --> 01:17:58,641
factory in brooklyn.
Jaseline in matthew dope people is so

1708
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:03,750
backstage a cello.
And I was there with a friend.

1709
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:06,330
Somebody introduced me to this lady.
She says,

1710
01:18:06,331 --> 01:18:07,290
oh,
I uh,

1711
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,230
she asked a industry job,
oh,

1712
01:18:10,231 --> 01:18:14,940
I work here and blah blah blah.
We love to have you in.

1713
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:16,650
And I say,
sure,

1714
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:17,520
you know,
that sounds,

1715
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:18,990
that sounds good.
I'd like to do.

1716
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:24,270
it sounded like an interesting thing to
do and so she hands me her phone and I

1717
01:18:24,271 --> 01:18:29,271
put in my email and my assistant's email
and then give her the phone baCk and she

1718
01:18:31,051 --> 01:18:34,240
was like,
you gotta go give your number though.

1719
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:37,520
I'll take that as a sign of disrespect.
I'm an oji in this game.

1720
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,340
And I was,
I was super high at this point and I was

1721
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:42,940
like,
what Is happening right now?

1722
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:47,370
She took it as a sign of disrespect that
you didn't give her your number because

1723
01:18:47,371 --> 01:18:50,580
I guess he deals with lots of famous
people or some shit.

1724
01:18:50,581 --> 01:18:53,790
So the fact that I just gave her emails,
she just,

1725
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:57,850
I'd never met them.
I met this woman a 90 seconds prior to

1726
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:00,130
this part of the inner.
It was so

1727
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,200
yeah,
I was so high to where is this really

1728
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,370
happening right now?
I really wanted to work with you and I

1729
01:19:08,371 --> 01:19:09,270
just gave you

1730
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:12,510
the info to get in touch with me.
Yeah.

1731
01:19:12,511 --> 01:19:15,180
Why do we have to talk on the phone?
That's less effect.

1732
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:16,650
It was suit.
And so I'm like,

1733
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:17,580
what is that?
And then,

1734
01:19:17,581 --> 01:19:19,040
so,
uh,

1735
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:19,970
and it's so

1736
01:19:19,970 --> 01:19:22,760
goes on about that,
but with the antibiotic for how long

1737
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:25,460
that long,
but then she tried to continue the

1738
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:29,600
conversation after.
It's obvious that her vibe haS changed.

1739
01:19:29,601 --> 01:19:30,710
When I was in,
she went from,

1740
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:34,400
hey,
was that enough today to a very dry.

1741
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:35,533
Oh,
so,

1742
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,450
oh,
she continued the conversation.

1743
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:42,020
That's not good in this kind of drive.
Weird,

1744
01:19:42,021 --> 01:19:43,370
wet what she said,
oh,

1745
01:19:43,371 --> 01:19:46,670
so you're about to go on this tour with
nas and lauryn hill,

1746
01:19:46,671 --> 01:19:48,290
how do you approach the shows
differently?

1747
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:50,860
But it's obvious that she just kind of
asking them so that you,

1748
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:52,190
you.
And so I was.

1749
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:53,163
So I didn't,

1750
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,440
I answered it and then she pulls out her
phone and she was like,

1751
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:59,050
oh my friends over there.
And then,

1752
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:00,400
uh,
she,

1753
01:20:00,401 --> 01:20:01,630
uh,
she,

1754
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:05,460
she like goes like this,
him.

1755
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:07,640
And then I'll just said,
all right,

1756
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:10,170
I'm outta here.
I just walked off somewhere else.

1757
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:15,770
But then it was such a weird experience
that the comedian in me was hoping she

1758
01:20:17,941 --> 01:20:22,941
was doing some weird andy kaufman bit
because that intense,

1759
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,230
it was just super weird because
everybody was.

1760
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:27,180
EveryboDy else was really chill.
I,

1761
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:31,740
I wasn't even having any network and
discussions with people like that there

1762
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,680
and everybody else was really chill.
I don't lIke talking to other people

1763
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,680
that did that really happen.
And so I saw her later,

1764
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:42,240
like a couple of hours later I said was
well you doing a bit.

1765
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:47,270
Was that again?
And then she tried to play it like she

1766
01:20:48,851 --> 01:20:49,900
will,
but I could tell she was like,

1767
01:20:49,901 --> 01:20:52,080
I had to check,
you check me for what?

1768
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:57,520
And so,
but she was really into collecting

1769
01:20:57,521 --> 01:20:59,280
people.
That's what she's really also,

1770
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:04,350
she was a interacted with me based on
who else she's dealt with in her past

1771
01:21:05,831 --> 01:21:08,740
versus just interacted with me as an
individual.

1772
01:21:08,741 --> 01:21:13,741
So she was just super salty and I was
just so ironic that at this beautiful

1773
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:20,940
black festival,
the only person beIng weird backstage is

1774
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:24,190
a white woman in her forties.

1775
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:30,210
Taking that as a sign of disrespect.
It was crazy and you must've felt like

1776
01:21:30,461 --> 01:21:31,780
as soon as she said that like,
oh,

1777
01:21:31,781 --> 01:21:33,340
this,
this definitely was the right move.

1778
01:21:33,341 --> 01:21:35,470
Not to give you my number because you're
fucking crazy.

1779
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,220
Yeah.
It was just more like I was wondering

1780
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,910
now then after I was like,
it was mine

1781
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:44,560
because sometimes I give,
I give random people my number out,

1782
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:47,590
have like random I've given,
but I don't know what.

1783
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,500
I don't know.
Maybe something that instinct,

1784
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:54,300
he knew it just gave it to her,
but I've given people in my email before

1785
01:21:54,301 --> 01:21:55,410
too,
but it was just,

1786
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,410
it was just.
Especially since I was super high,

1787
01:21:58,470 --> 01:21:59,303
I was like,

1788
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:01,580
well see the thing is for business
though,

1789
01:22:01,581 --> 01:22:05,090
email's the best way to contact people
because you can 100 percent or you can

1790
01:22:05,091 --> 01:22:06,770
email somebody at three in the morning.
It's nothing.

1791
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:07,191
Well,
yeah.

1792
01:22:07,191 --> 01:22:09,560
Not only that you can like if you say,
hey,

1793
01:22:09,561 --> 01:22:12,260
we're trying to work out the logistics
for this thing in february between

1794
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:15,290
February 2nd and fourth,
tell us your availabilities so then you

1795
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:17,730
can sit in front of a computer and look
at my calendar first.

1796
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:19,250
My birthday.
Happy birthday.

1797
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:20,980
Thanks.
Look at that shit and you can go,

1798
01:22:20,981 --> 01:22:21,411
oh,
okay,

1799
01:22:21,411 --> 01:22:23,160
well here's what I've got and you could
we.

1800
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,410
It's,
it's clear.

1801
01:22:24,411 --> 01:22:27,110
It's more having a conversation over the
phone that I got to remember.

1802
01:22:27,111 --> 01:22:28,760
I've got to write it down.
Hold on.

1803
01:22:28,761 --> 01:22:31,820
Let me get a piece of paper or let me
dictate it into my phone.

1804
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:35,170
Like that's less effective.
Especially.

1805
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:41,140
It was fucking bitch,
but it's a crazy man.

1806
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,370
It's crazy people out there,
man.

1807
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:45,800
I've,
I've met men and women that do that.

1808
01:22:45,801 --> 01:22:47,690
They want your number.
Then if you don't want to give him your

1809
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:48,860
number,
they get upset.

1810
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,380
Well,
the reason why you're getting upset is

1811
01:22:51,381 --> 01:22:52,970
the very reason why I don't want to get
my number.

1812
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:56,720
I don't want as we live.
Yeah.

1813
01:22:56,721 --> 01:23:00,860
You too excited about getting my number.
Someone's got excited about getting your

1814
01:23:00,861 --> 01:23:02,060
number.
You shouldn't give them your number.

1815
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,910
Yeah,
she started name dropping and shit.

1816
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:06,040
Fuck that.
As soon

1817
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,030
as they start.
Name dropping out a second time.

1818
01:23:08,031 --> 01:23:11,320
I've done stuff.
I'm putting on events for obama.

1819
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:13,480
Yes.
Call obama right now.

1820
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:15,430
Wake him up.
That's cool.

1821
01:23:15,431 --> 01:23:17,140
That's really great.
Did you did that?

1822
01:23:17,141 --> 01:23:20,680
But donald pence for obama,
dId obama give you his number?

1823
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,540
Crazy asshole like obama's given out.
Hey,

1824
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:28,900
text me anytime.
No matter what's going on with the 7

1825
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,220
billion people in the world that I'm
handling.

1826
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:33,410
Yeah.
Well maybe she's a troll and she knew

1827
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:38,980
that she was becoming a podcast story.
Is she that I like to make people.

1828
01:23:39,531 --> 01:23:44,030
Sometimes I like to make people more
calculated than they are.

1829
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:46,380
That's like some illuminati shit that's
like.

1830
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:49,070
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

1831
01:23:49,071 --> 01:23:52,040
I think she's just crazy lady.
Just a weird show.

1832
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:53,370
Business lady,
you know,

1833
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:57,770
just a crazy lady.
Have you completely.

1834
01:23:57,990 --> 01:24:02,130
We moved past all the cosby shit or do
you still take grief for that?

1835
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:04,720
That grief?
No,

1836
01:24:04,721 --> 01:24:07,060
I've uh.
Well now you're vindicated.

1837
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:12,250
I was sort of a grief.
It was just where I would,

1838
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:15,460
uh,
before to talk about it in situations I,

1839
01:24:15,461 --> 01:24:17,530
they want to.
And also it came out

1840
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,700
the joke,
uh,

1841
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:27,000
and that video came out right before we
were starting the rollout for my comedy

1842
01:24:27,881 --> 01:24:32,170
central tv show.
And we actually people on,

1843
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:37,200
we pushed back my announcement because
they're looking opportunist.

1844
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:43,210
That news was that crazy that we pushed
It back by.

1845
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:47,500
Maybe he pushed it back,
the premier announced by a month or two

1846
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:52,870
because it was that and so,
so even though I had my comedy central

1847
01:24:52,871 --> 01:24:57,871
deal in place this since 2012,
I had an all around comedy central deal

1848
01:24:58,301 --> 01:25:00,520
is.
So then when that came out and then I

1849
01:25:00,521 --> 01:25:04,900
got my show with,
well then my show was scheduled to go on

1850
01:25:04,901 --> 01:25:05,230
the air.

1851
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,120
It looked like,
oh,

1852
01:25:06,121 --> 01:25:08,170
he did the cosmic joke and then he got a
tv show.

1853
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,550
It's like,
no man,

1854
01:25:09,551 --> 01:25:14,260
this is like my fourth development deal
and this is finally to show that I got.

1855
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:19,880
Isn't that funny how things work here?
But.

1856
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:23,620
So that was,
that was the thing where instead of,

1857
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:27,580
uh,
instead of just having this show that I

1858
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:30,640
was able to,
it was this energy around it,

1859
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:35,210
you know,
and 2005 july or early 2005.

1860
01:25:35,211 --> 01:25:40,211
It was this energy around it where if I
was going to do press around that time,

1861
01:25:40,571 --> 01:25:42,640
they were definitely gonna.
What year was it?

1862
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,410
This was 2015.
Two years ago.

1863
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,060
Two thousand five.
Sorry.

1864
01:25:46,061 --> 01:25:47,140
Yeah,
2015,

1865
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:48,400
uh,
and uh,

1866
01:25:48,401 --> 01:25:51,610
that show in philly was October,
2014,

1867
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:57,010
so yeah,
it just kind of really affected the

1868
01:25:57,070 --> 01:26:02,070
energy around it and as far and,
and my m one and an eagerness to do a

1869
01:26:06,081 --> 01:26:10,160
lot of press just because I knew it was
going to come up and I was just like,

1870
01:26:10,161 --> 01:26:12,520
I was so uh,
that was that.

1871
01:26:12,650 --> 01:26:16,820
I'm not saying that that's the reason my
show's not on anymore at all.

1872
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:19,010
Excuse me,
for people like your show sucks.

1873
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:23,090
that's why I
like doing the show.

1874
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:25,880
I did,
I did like aspects of it.

1875
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:28,760
I liked the activity part of it was
always something to do,

1876
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:30,370
you know what I mean?
If you like,

1877
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:32,810
if you,
you face up to show you gotta write,

1878
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:36,050
you gotta edit,
you got to get the writers to do stuff.

1879
01:26:36,051 --> 01:26:38,230
You got to um,
you know,

1880
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:42,290
deal with costumes and it's always a
task to do.

1881
01:26:42,291 --> 01:26:43,400
So.
I like just the,

1882
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:48,010
that I know for that whatever,
what,

1883
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,190
four months,
three,

1884
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:53,330
four month period.
I was never bored during that time

1885
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:54,920
doing.
When I do movies,

1886
01:26:54,930 --> 01:26:59,930
I'm hellebore yeah,
I was like movie just because it's no

1887
01:27:00,111 --> 01:27:01,640
use.
Just sit arOund and you go say some

1888
01:27:01,641 --> 01:27:03,080
stuff.
It's like baseball.

1889
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,750
It's baseball.

1890
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,370
It's absolutely baseball.
If you talk about a 12 hour day that you

1891
01:27:10,371 --> 01:27:13,160
spend on a movie,
shoot is actually for me,

1892
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:19,180
45 minutes,
an hour of actual acting and shit and I

1893
01:27:20,661 --> 01:27:25,661
mean with me maybe 10 minutes of actual
acting because I'm not a good actor at

1894
01:27:25,851 --> 01:27:27,020
all.
I'm just saying words,

1895
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:29,720
but yeah,
it's just shit.

1896
01:27:29,721 --> 01:27:33,170
It's just mind numbingly boring.
But the finished product,

1897
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,590
the finished product is,
it's cool to see and it's dope to be a

1898
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:37,910
product,
but we're doing it.

1899
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,980
The director has a lot to,
you know,

1900
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:44,010
he's moving around and he got a lot of
shit to do and so he might yet.

1901
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:46,100
But uh,
yeah,

1902
01:27:46,101 --> 01:27:47,900
doing that shit.
It's boring.

1903
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:49,970
It's very boring.
There's no other way to do it though.

1904
01:27:49,971 --> 01:27:53,130
It seems like it's always that way.
Uh,

1905
01:27:53,131 --> 01:27:57,860
I think it depends on the budget of it.
When they got money to burn,

1906
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:03,380
then they got time to burn also doing an
indie movie,

1907
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:05,560
then they ain't going to keep it going.

1908
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,300
Gonna keep that shit moving.
But then yeah,

1909
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:12,960
if you're doing a at this one movie band
of robbers that's on netflix and it was

1910
01:28:13,791 --> 01:28:14,630
Just,
you know,

1911
01:28:14,631 --> 01:28:15,950
we were active.
What is that?

1912
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:21,410
It's a uh,
it's time sawyer and huckleberry finn,

1913
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:23,210
but in real,
in real time,

1914
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:26,330
like in current time.
Uh,

1915
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:29,240
yeah.
So I did that and that was,

1916
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:32,870
it played a few scenes in that,
but it was quick.

1917
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:34,880
It was no wasted days.
You know,

1918
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:36,440
sometimes you go to a movie set.
They were like,

1919
01:28:36,441 --> 01:28:37,970
yeah,
get here at 9:00 in the morning.

1920
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,890
You get there,
go through the whole shit,

1921
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,720
get your hair,
make up,

1922
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:46,280
get your clothes on and sit around and
just sit for a full.

1923
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:51,260
I sat for four days
full days and then do like,

1924
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:53,720
what was the,
what the fuck was the plan?

1925
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:57,240
They want you there in case they get
through a scene,

1926
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:02,160
we move onto the next one.
Not even anything.

1927
01:29:02,290 --> 01:29:03,210
When you were like,
no,

1928
01:29:03,211 --> 01:29:05,910
we're not gonna you not know.
Do you good for the day?

1929
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:07,590
For the whole,
for the whole day.

1930
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:09,240
Who planned this out

1931
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,000
now when you were doing a tv show?
How many months ago?

1932
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:15,410
You said it for like four months.
Uh,

1933
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:19,200
eight episodes.
So it's two months of shooting and then

1934
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:22,830
a month or a couple months of pre.
Pro?

1935
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:24,610
Yeah.
And do you,

1936
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:26,370
you enjoyed it?
I did enjoy.

1937
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,210
I Just,
yeah,

1938
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:28,600
I enjoy it.
I want to do a.

1939
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,430
I'll probably do something on tv next
year again to a show once I get the idea

1940
01:29:32,431 --> 01:29:34,320
right and figure out exactly.

1941
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:37,960
You think you'd do comedy central comedy
central needs to show a.

1942
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:38,883
They need something.

1943
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:42,660
I do somewhere I'm going to.
Do you know what the best choices.

1944
01:29:42,730 --> 01:29:44,530
I had a good relationship over there
still.

1945
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:46,570
Um,
but we'll see.

1946
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,370
We'll see what it is.

1947
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:51,130
It's so hard to do those things because
you got to deal with so many other

1948
01:29:51,131 --> 01:29:53,080
people.
Get so many different cooks in the

1949
01:29:53,081 --> 01:29:54,670
kitchen.
Executives,

1950
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:56,840
all these different people hanging out.

1951
01:29:58,110 --> 01:30:00,260
Well part.
I mean they will,

1952
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:04,310
they will pretty chill.
They were,

1953
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:06,050
they would,
it was,

1954
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:11,750
it will be weird aspects and just weird
things that you think you care about

1955
01:30:12,261 --> 01:30:14,030
this.
It'll be a weird line,

1956
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:18,560
like why don't you give a shit about
this line so much,

1957
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:23,390
but they'll let other shit go,
but he'll sometimes give notes on

1958
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:27,710
something that a st pretty insignificant
to me.

1959
01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:29,170
Yeah,
I think a lot of times they just want to

1960
01:30:29,171 --> 01:30:33,490
justify their existence.
They want to justify their paycheck and

1961
01:30:33,491 --> 01:30:35,920
have some sort of point of view.
Even if it doesn't make any sense,

1962
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:38,020
they just want to add to it.
Yeah,

1963
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:40,930
tweak it a little bit.
That was my idea when I guess he took

1964
01:30:40,931 --> 01:30:43,570
his hat off and made it a little nod.
That was my idea.

1965
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:45,760
Yeah.
conference calls is because everybody

1966
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:49,630
feels the need to chime in on the call.
I've been on conference and I'm like,

1967
01:30:49,631 --> 01:30:50,464
why am I

1968
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:52,730
on this?
This?

1969
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:55,940
I don't know if I've had a.
I don't know if I had a conference call

1970
01:30:55,941 --> 01:30:57,530
where it just felt really good.

1971
01:30:58,840 --> 01:30:59,970
F,
like website.

1972
01:31:00,030 --> 01:31:02,950
That was a good conference call.
I'm glad I did that shit.

1973
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:06,700
Never had a conference call one time I
canceled the show.

1974
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:09,250
I was supposed to do a,
um,

1975
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:13,490
a comedy central standup special under
the old regime and um,

1976
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:17,800
we had a conference call and they went,
they had like a transcript of my set and

1977
01:31:17,801 --> 01:31:19,900
they were going over the material and
they're like,

1978
01:31:19,901 --> 01:31:22,150
well,
you definitely can't talk about this in

1979
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:23,680
you.
You can'T say this.

1980
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:25,840
and you can say we got like five minutes
into the conversation.

1981
01:31:25,841 --> 01:31:26,291
I go,
stop,

1982
01:31:26,291 --> 01:31:26,831
stop,
stop,

1983
01:31:26,831 --> 01:31:27,664
stop,
stop.

1984
01:31:28,210 --> 01:31:30,410
I'm out.
Go am I doing this?

1985
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:31,893
And they went,
what?

1986
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:34,360
I go and I'm not doing this.
I don't want to do this.

1987
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:36,880
Like there's no way I go,
you guys are butcher and everythIng.

1988
01:31:36,881 --> 01:31:38,110
I go,
this is my ass.

1989
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:42,040
You know what my act is?
You want to cut things out and change

1990
01:31:42,041 --> 01:31:45,070
things and you like,
there's no way this is not happening.

1991
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,170
Yeah.
So thank you though.

1992
01:31:47,171 --> 01:31:48,060
Appreciate it.
And they did.

1993
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:49,570
They did.
They were stunned.

1994
01:31:49,990 --> 01:31:51,940
There was a,
it was one of those stun conversations.

1995
01:31:51,941 --> 01:31:52,810
Like what?
I was like,

1996
01:31:52,811 --> 01:31:53,710
yeah,
I'm not doing this.

1997
01:31:53,770 --> 01:31:55,880
Did they?
Did they flip though?

1998
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:57,203
No,
no,

1999
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,840
it was just a straight up.
Well,

2000
01:31:58,841 --> 01:31:59,531
I,
yeah,

2001
01:31:59,531 --> 01:32:00,020
I was like,

2002
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:01,300
we'll go on somewhere else.
I'm like,

2003
01:32:01,330 --> 01:32:04,080
this is crazy.
Because one of those conversations were

2004
01:32:04,081 --> 01:32:04,600
there.
It'd been,

2005
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:09,130
there were super resistant to
controversial shit.

2006
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:10,780
This is a,
this is what,

2007
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:13,180
a few years back.
Like I wish I could remember late

2008
01:32:13,181 --> 01:32:14,350
nineties.
No,

2009
01:32:14,351 --> 01:32:17,290
no,
2005 ish.

2010
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:21,140
Six ish.
I winded up doing actually a series a.

2011
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:24,220
I'm a,
I'm a special on netflix that went to

2012
01:32:24,221 --> 01:32:26,530
showtime.
That was 2005,

2013
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,190
so that's where I wound up doing it.
but the conversation on the phone was

2014
01:32:30,191 --> 01:32:32,410
just like,
what they were going over the material.

2015
01:32:32,411 --> 01:32:33,160
No.
Okay.

2016
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:35,440
We're gonna have issue with this.
You can't say that.

2017
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:36,860
He definitely can't say this.
I'm sorry.

2018
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:40,870
This is just those doing those specials
on tv.

2019
01:32:40,871 --> 01:32:43,630
It's such a bad idea anyway because
they're always all broken up.

2020
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:46,110
Yeah,
yeah.

2021
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:46,870
It's,
yeah,

2022
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:51,700
it's especially for stories.
I did my first two with comedy central

2023
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:55,030
and they were,
they break up your store and you broke

2024
01:32:55,031 --> 01:32:58,720
up a story.
longest story and my second one,

2025
01:32:58,721 --> 01:33:02,500
if I'm not mistaken,
but they all netflix now and they're

2026
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:03,730
full,
but yeah,

2027
01:33:03,731 --> 01:33:04,870
they would.
I mean they got a.

2028
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,050
That's how they paid me is that they
fucking cell bodies pray.

2029
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:10,630
I got to take another piSs real quick.
Too much water to drink.

2030
01:33:10,631 --> 01:33:13,600
Four bottles of water.
You might be the new water champ.

2031
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:16,510
I'm not going to sit outside to austin.
It is 110.

2032
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:18,490
Yeah,
it's crazy hot here too.

2033
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:23,240
It's so hot that I went running and it
was burning the bottom of my feet

2034
01:33:23,690 --> 01:33:26,290
through those five finger shoes.
You know?

2035
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:28,820
I wear those really thin trail running
shoes.

2036
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:30,910
Those vibrams that everybody tells me
he's gonna.

2037
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:33,530
Kill me.
People hack like you're gonna die.

2038
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:35,600
If you were.
Those things look way I tell people,

2039
01:33:35,601 --> 01:33:35,950
I'm like,
dude,

2040
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:40,100
you a class action lawsuit.
Eastern studies are terrible for you

2041
01:33:40,101 --> 01:33:41,750
bro.
They're not.

2042
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:45,950
It's just your body is used to wearing a
cast on your feet.

2043
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:49,520
Listen to everybody that's worried about
those things.

2044
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:54,820
I swear If you just use those things and
walk for awhile and then like where I'm

2045
01:33:56,121 --> 01:33:58,730
a little bit and then eventually build
up to running with them,

2046
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:01,520
you'll be fine,
but you have to strengthen your feet.

2047
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,080
I'm neil brennan said he got plantar
fasciitis from running on a treadmill.

2048
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:09,620
what those things on those vibram
fivefIngers shoes.

2049
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:11,890
Yeah.
Those are the ones that really stick to

2050
01:34:11,891 --> 01:34:13,890
your feet.
Toe shoes.

2051
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:17,340
Yeah.
I run with those and they're better for

2052
01:34:17,341 --> 01:34:18,380
your feet.
It's like your.

2053
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:22,050
Your foot has to be strong because most
of the time when you're running,

2054
01:34:22,051 --> 01:34:25,530
you're running with running shoes on
like have you seen the average pair of

2055
01:34:25,531 --> 01:34:28,200
running shoes?
They have a thick heel and what happened

2056
01:34:28,201 --> 01:34:30,990
is nike.
I think in the seventies whenever they

2057
01:34:30,991 --> 01:34:34,380
came out with these things,
they literally changed the way people

2058
01:34:34,381 --> 01:34:38,220
run because people started running in,
landing with their heel because that's

2059
01:34:38,221 --> 01:34:40,560
where the big cushion is changed the
gate,

2060
01:34:40,590 --> 01:34:44,520
the natural human gate and to put way
more pressure on your knees and people

2061
01:34:44,521 --> 01:34:46,680
started developing all these issues
because of that.

2062
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:48,810
The real way to run.
It's supposed to.

2063
01:34:48,811 --> 01:34:52,320
You're supposed to run on the forefoot
like landing on the ball of the foot and

2064
01:34:52,321 --> 01:34:56,100
let the natural structure of your foot
decelerate your stride.

2065
01:34:56,130 --> 01:34:58,760
That's what you're supposed to do,
but most people's feet are not

2066
01:34:58,761 --> 01:35:03,230
conditioned for that because we wear
these thick ass sneakers everywhere and

2067
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:05,630
those things act as it's like wearing a
cast everywhere.

2068
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:09,800
That's how it's been described to me.
So over the last four or five months

2069
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:12,650
I've been running with what they call
minimal issues,

2070
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:14,510
so there's almost no cushioning.
It all.

2071
01:35:14,511 --> 01:35:18,500
It's very thin and I was saying that
it's so hot out that it was running in

2072
01:35:18,501 --> 01:35:23,501
these things and the bottom of my feet
got hot from the just from running on

2073
01:35:23,571 --> 01:35:25,160
the ground.
The ground was so hot.

2074
01:35:25,161 --> 01:35:27,890
It was it starting to melt or something.
Today I could feel that I could feel the

2075
01:35:27,891 --> 01:35:29,540
heat through the bottom of my feet was
hurting.

2076
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:32,210
It is actually like burning the bottom
of my foot,

2077
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:33,560
which by the way,
people,

2078
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,770
if you have dogs,
be super fucking careful.

2079
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:38,720
Your dogs outside because you're walking
your dog on concrete.

2080
01:35:38,721 --> 01:35:41,120
You could easily burn the shit out of
your dog's paws.

2081
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:43,970
Just the other day.
I just had looked a little bit into it.

2082
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,560
Uh,
the painting,

2083
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:49,100
different sections of a asphalt I guess
here with,

2084
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,260
I don't know if it's like white.

2085
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:54,610
Yeah.
So It's a heat absorbing color instead

2086
01:35:54,611 --> 01:35:59,110
of black asphalt.
Black asphalt apparently just absorbs

2087
01:35:59,111 --> 01:36:02,230
the heat and reflects the heat.
Radiates it around.

2088
01:36:02,231 --> 01:36:02,900
Yeah.

2089
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:04,820
This is,
was dropping like 10 to 15 degrees

2090
01:36:04,821 --> 01:36:06,300
almost immediately.
I was her here.

2091
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,660
You got 12 degrees just after one coat.
YeaH,

2092
01:36:08,661 --> 01:36:10,130
I've seen that.
That's amazing.

2093
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:13,520
That's great.
And all that as hard as I saw in one

2094
01:36:13,521 --> 01:36:15,290
article,
but it's like 120 degrees.

2095
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:17,930
It was getting some places like off
sunset boulevard and la,

2096
01:36:17,931 --> 01:36:20,600
like just in the middle of the day when
it's like 85 outside,

2097
01:36:20,601 --> 01:36:22,370
90 degrees outside.
Makes sense.

2098
01:36:22,371 --> 01:36:23,450
Really,
really extra hot.

2099
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:24,710
Yeah,
it totally makes sense.

2100
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,680
Yeah.
In all of la is asphalt basically to

2101
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,930
paint that shit stupid.
Yeah.

2102
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:32,810
This would change maybe maybe a little
bit on your feet.

2103
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:34,160
Oh yeah.
But you run it on

2104
01:36:34,530 --> 01:36:36,480
running on dirt.
So I'm running up hills,

2105
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:38,520
but uh,
it was so hot.

2106
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:41,460
It was the first time it's ever like,
burned the bottom of my feet.

2107
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:43,190
Like I could feel it.
It was hot.

2108
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:44,040
I was like,
jesus,

2109
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:47,100
I'm not a uh,
I don't really jog,

2110
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:51,240
but I'm a good judge of form.
Are you?

2111
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:54,300
I just like a running coach now know if
I could coach,

2112
01:36:54,301 --> 01:36:56,340
but I could just,
I could definitely tell you when you're

2113
01:36:56,341 --> 01:37:00,810
wrong because I see some people like to
heavy footed,

2114
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:04,920
heavy footage,
bad when most people are running on

2115
01:37:04,921 --> 01:37:06,750
their heels.
I see people running and I'm like,

2116
01:37:06,751 --> 01:37:08,040
wow.
It's crazy.

2117
01:37:08,041 --> 01:37:11,430
When you look around to you look around
how many people are wearing shoes with

2118
01:37:11,431 --> 01:37:12,510
elevated heels?
You're like,

2119
01:37:12,511 --> 01:37:14,130
wow,
that's kinda nuts.

2120
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:18,150
It's kind of not telling me people just
got accustomed to wearing those kinds of

2121
01:37:18,151 --> 01:37:19,050
sneakers and running

2122
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,130
people are running basketball shoes or
something too.

2123
01:37:21,330 --> 01:37:22,970
That's lIke,
you probably shouldn't be doing that.

2124
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:26,300
I think you'd be better off with that.
Then you are with running shoes.

2125
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:29,420
Just don't land that way.
Just to land on your heel.

2126
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,760
If you went to the ball of your feet
basketball shoes,

2127
01:37:31,761 --> 01:37:33,560
I think she'd be fine,
but what the fuck do I know?

2128
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:35,720
But you know,
I'm running with some really.

2129
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:40,410
I run all knee with those.
A five finger shoes now or with um,

2130
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:43,960
I wear these morels too.
They're called vapor or something or

2131
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,190
like the real thin,
too minimalist.

2132
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:52,030
Do people ever try to read it?
But people probably still will attempt

2133
01:37:52,161 --> 01:37:53,870
to stop you while you jog,
right?

2134
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:55,290
Yeah.
But I don't do,

2135
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:56,133
you can't.

2136
01:37:57,650 --> 01:37:59,310
That's so crazy.
Like I'm in the middle.

2137
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:01,220
You're literally going to interrupt a
workout.

2138
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:04,010
Looks like I've had people come up to me
while I'm on the treadmill before,

2139
01:38:04,011 --> 01:38:04,461
like,
hey man,

2140
01:38:04,461 --> 01:38:05,610
can I get you?
I get a photo with you.

2141
01:38:05,611 --> 01:38:08,840
like definitely not.
Now people do it.

2142
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:12,530
If you can have a mouthful of food,
you could be eating food.

2143
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,460
I was cutting food up for my daughter
and this lady asked me for a picture.

2144
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:18,290
I was like,
are you crazy?

2145
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:21,530
I'm feeding my kid.
Like,

2146
01:38:21,531 --> 01:38:24,170
this is just.
People just don't give a fuck.

2147
01:38:24,171 --> 01:38:27,770
They want to adorn their facebook with
something that they saw on tv once.

2148
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:29,410
It's weird.

2149
01:38:29,410 --> 01:38:31,280
Not even printing it up.
They don't care.

2150
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,590
Not even really pregnant usually.

2151
01:38:34,170 --> 01:38:36,630
Well,
they don't even want it that much.

2152
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:38,770
It's just like they have a phone and
like.

2153
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:40,710
It's like if you have a gun,
you want to pull the trigger.

2154
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:43,650
YOu have a phone and you want to take a
picture like how many people do you see

2155
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:46,050
at the 4th of July?
Taking videos of fireworks.

2156
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:49,140
You are never going to watch that
fucking video.

2157
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:54,330
Who the hell is going to watch a
fireworks video like how sad is your

2158
01:38:54,331 --> 01:38:56,640
life?
Have to get where you all have anything

2159
01:38:56,641 --> 01:38:59,700
better to do than be sitting there
watching little lights go off on your

2160
01:38:59,701 --> 01:39:00,540
foreign screen.

2161
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:05,530
Hey man,
airport layoffs are real dog.

2162
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:08,920
Is that what you do when you're sitting
there?

2163
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:12,490
LaYover.
You know the person that did it.

2164
01:39:12,491 --> 01:39:15,580
You know when you like.
Say you got to lay over in salt lake

2165
01:39:15,581 --> 01:39:18,100
city.
You delayed by five hours to go through

2166
01:39:18,101 --> 01:39:22,910
your videos and delete all the fireworks
once that's clean up.

2167
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:24,820
Yeah.
You're eating up a lot of gigabytes.

2168
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:26,530
You are.
When you look at it,

2169
01:39:26,531 --> 01:39:30,250
you realize how much bullshit as you put
shit in the cloud.

2170
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:31,970
Yeah.
DO you do?

2171
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:34,810
I shouldn't know.
I know even when I do it,

2172
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:37,210
but it's nothing too,
too risque.

2173
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:41,980
There's a couple risks,
but my face isn't in there.

2174
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:43,620
That's one thing that's just,
you

2175
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:48,310
know,
face.

2176
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:49,820
Would you,
uh,

2177
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:52,030
I think I asked a friend this yesterday.
What would you like,

2178
01:39:52,031 --> 01:39:54,160
let's say amazon started a g-mail
competitor.

2179
01:39:54,161 --> 01:39:55,870
Would you just like,
not just jump over,

2180
01:39:55,871 --> 01:39:58,720
but like wouldn't it be a good thing
maybe to just start fresh with all your

2181
01:39:58,721 --> 01:39:59,860
email and be like,
eh,

2182
01:40:00,130 --> 01:40:01,990
what do I need that's 20 years old in my
emr,

2183
01:40:01,991 --> 01:40:03,790
15 years old?
Oh yeah,

2184
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:05,410
for sure.
I don't want it.

2185
01:40:05,411 --> 01:40:06,244
I want to see it.

2186
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:09,860
Definitely.
If I look at my email on a daily basis,

2187
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:12,410
nine out of 10 things,
I get her bullshit.

2188
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:15,800
Nine out of 10,
one out of 10 I need.

2189
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:18,200
and those people,
I would just give my new email address

2190
01:40:18,201 --> 01:40:20,810
anyway,
like already did that pretty recently

2191
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:22,730
are just changed his email.
I'm like,

2192
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:23,450
it's good.
Move,

2193
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:24,141
uh,
chAnge your phone.

2194
01:40:24,141 --> 01:40:27,590
I changed my phone.
That's a good move to having more than

2195
01:40:27,591 --> 01:40:30,950
one phone is a good move to having a
phone for people like that fucking lady

2196
01:40:30,951 --> 01:40:32,870
at that thing was your number.
Okay.

2197
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:35,190
I don't know that number by heart.

2198
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:43,240
I just remembered my number right now by
heart and I'm about to change it again.

2199
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:44,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

2200
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:47,890
Just I liked not knowing until I don't
care as you know,

2201
01:40:47,891 --> 01:40:50,560
what else I'd like to.
I liked that my vision is going so I

2202
01:40:50,561 --> 01:40:52,320
can't read things.
So like when,

2203
01:40:52,321 --> 01:40:53,154
uh,
when I,

2204
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:55,210
if I get like an email or something like
that,

2205
01:40:55,211 --> 01:40:56,620
like I can go.
What does it say?

2206
01:40:56,730 --> 01:40:57,670
Uh,
okay.

2207
01:40:58,550 --> 01:41:01,480
I don't feel held to like read the
whole.

2208
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:04,990
I don't feel compelled to put my reading
glasses and go into depth.

2209
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:07,630
I just look at it too.
Quick glance.

2210
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:09,670
Don't need to pay attention to this as
some bullshit.

2211
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:11,620
Yeah.
Think about some important things.

2212
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,820
That's,
that's a,

2213
01:41:14,030 --> 01:41:18,290
that's like old man and flaky.
See that shit.

2214
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:24,120
What's that fucking newspaper?
Damn game on?

2215
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:24,810
yeah.

2216
01:41:24,810 --> 01:41:28,300
I don't give a fuck.
I'm practicing not giving a fuck.

2217
01:41:28,301 --> 01:41:31,360
I've always been good at it,
but I'm like actively working on it

2218
01:41:31,361 --> 01:41:33,070
harder and harder more now than ever.

2219
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:36,120
It's tough,
especially if you're in you're thinking

2220
01:41:36,121 --> 01:41:41,121
about is tough nuts to not give a fuck,
but also be very aware of thinking about

2221
01:41:41,361 --> 01:41:46,260
the audit time where you have to you if
you saying you don't give a fuck,

2222
01:41:46,261 --> 01:41:49,050
you do give a fuck.
[inaudible] you making the choice to be

2223
01:41:49,051 --> 01:41:50,100
like,
I don't give a fuck,

2224
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:52,170
but you still do give a fuck.
You just like,

2225
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,470
I'm not going to react in a way as
somebody who gives a fuck,

2226
01:41:55,471 --> 01:41:56,304
but I give a fuck.

2227
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:57,400
Yeah.
Making a choice though.

2228
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,980
You know what it's like.
It's like I'm pretending I don't give a

2229
01:41:59,981 --> 01:42:02,250
fuck by saying I don't give a fuck.
Yeah.

2230
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:06,160
I'm like putting that out there.
I'm like making a conscious decision to

2231
01:42:06,161 --> 01:42:09,580
not give a fuck,
but in doing so I'm giving a fuck about

2232
01:42:09,581 --> 01:42:12,220
not giving a fuck.
Yes means you give a fuck.

2233
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:16,990
You know who don't give a fuck who
locksmiths wise that they don't get

2234
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:19,810
locksmith confidence stop.
Why don't think of it?

2235
01:42:19,870 --> 01:42:22,300
Because they can open any door.
Because they can open any door and you

2236
01:42:22,301 --> 01:42:24,240
called them about the laW.
I mean,

2237
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:26,740
I guess they have to eyeball it and see
what it is,

2238
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:30,550
but I call it like I've had.
I wAs locked out of my In new yoRk and

2239
01:42:30,551 --> 01:42:31,384
I'll say,
uh,

2240
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:35,890
come through and tell them that I'll Be
there iN five minutes.

2241
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:38,020
Once the price,
I'll let you know when I'm there.

2242
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,010
Like,
that's confidence,

2243
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:41,740
right?
I'm gonna tell you when I'm there

2244
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:46,000
Because you need to get into your place.
That's true.

2245
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:48,460
And yeah.
And so I've,

2246
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:49,593
I've,
uh,

2247
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:52,480
I've sent locksmiths away just as an
actor,

2248
01:42:52,490 --> 01:42:54,700
too much money,
just as an act of aggression.

2249
01:42:54,701 --> 01:42:57,100
Yeah.
When he was like,

2250
01:42:57,101 --> 01:42:59,200
it's this much.
And I was like trying to talk him down

2251
01:42:59,201 --> 01:43:01,840
and he wasn't having it and he was like,
so and I was like,

2252
01:43:02,790 --> 01:43:04,150
it's fine.
It'S all good.

2253
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:08,710
And I just sat in my hallway foot.
I think I went to the bar a couple of

2254
01:43:08,711 --> 01:43:10,540
doors down just called another
locksmith.

2255
01:43:10,990 --> 01:43:14,710
How much did you save?
Not worth that time.

2256
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:19,330
It was good for my spirit.
Now

2257
01:43:20,050 --> 01:43:22,170
did you get a vibe off that dude?
Like you sort of,

2258
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:24,340
you had a vibe off that lady didn't want
to give her your number.

2259
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,260
There's lIke a five.
I just,

2260
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:29,020
I think it's just a,
cause I've,

2261
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,240
I just see how quick they can do it and
I'm like,

2262
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:34,000
I could do that in,
you know,

2263
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:37,030
like they,
they do it in maybe 20,

2264
01:43:37,031 --> 01:43:41,470
30 seconds sometimes and I'm like I can
learn how to do it in the five minute

2265
01:43:41,471 --> 01:43:44,380
version of that,
how fast they do it and so it makes me,

2266
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:49,680
when I see how they do it and it pisses
me off to know that he can just break in

2267
01:43:49,931 --> 01:43:52,100
my shit at anytime and that he's just
charging

2268
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,340
me an arbitrary price because this
market is kinda,

2269
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:56,270
you know,
all over the place.

2270
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:59,520
Yeah.
Well I guess they have a skill and

2271
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:01,580
should get paid for that.
Absolutely.

2272
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,650
Right.
So like what,

2273
01:44:03,651 --> 01:44:04,790
do you remember how much money?
It was

2274
01:44:06,330 --> 01:44:09,710
a hundred 50,
let's say a hundred 50.

2275
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:11,300
Oh,
how to just give him the money.

2276
01:44:11,860 --> 01:44:13,080
I don't.
I'm

2277
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:16,490
probably.
Yeah,

2278
01:44:16,491 --> 01:44:17,870
but you like,
like you,

2279
01:44:17,890 --> 01:44:20,300
you,
you gotta enjoyment out of saying no.

2280
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:22,160
Yeah,
because I think he,

2281
01:44:22,161 --> 01:44:23,810
yeah,
I think he's used to mfa would be like

2282
01:44:23,811 --> 01:44:24,860
short and I'm like,
you,

2283
01:44:24,861 --> 01:44:25,700
well,
you know what,

2284
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,310
you got this skill,
you can break into people's houses and

2285
01:44:28,311 --> 01:44:31,130
shit.
I've seen people do this shit fast and I

2286
01:44:31,131 --> 01:44:33,220
don't,
I'm not having it live on a block.

2287
01:44:33,570 --> 01:44:35,990
I didn't want a black widow,
but I'm not in a suburban area.

2288
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:37,690
My block in,
uh,

2289
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:42,610
in brooklyn and williamsburg,
I got one of the most lit blocks in this

2290
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:43,730
shit to do.
It's Just,

2291
01:44:43,731 --> 01:44:47,030
yeah,
it's like four bars just on my very

2292
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:47,481
block.
Oh,

2293
01:44:47,481 --> 01:44:50,480
I got time to kill.
went down to my local and a play some

2294
01:44:50,481 --> 01:44:52,700
skeeball hung out.
Yeah.

2295
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:56,090
Well now how much did you offer to take
off?

2296
01:44:57,230 --> 01:44:59,210
I don't remember the specifics of the
negotiation,

2297
01:44:59,211 --> 01:45:03,800
but it was a very nominal amount.
He bought me nothing.

2298
01:45:03,801 --> 01:45:05,930
Yeah.
And he wasn't really budget and shit.

2299
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:07,490
Yeah,
it was Just,

2300
01:45:07,491 --> 01:45:08,050
yeah,

2301
01:45:08,050 --> 01:45:10,160
insight into the mind of hannibal
burress.

2302
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:12,770
That's how my dad was.
Three apartments,

2303
01:45:13,010 --> 01:45:15,610
rent them out with the airbnb,
$700 watch.

2304
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:17,600
Big spend.
No car,

2305
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:21,500
no car won't pay for a locksmith,
will pay for a locksmith.

2306
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:24,290
Did pay for a lot,
but not that one.

2307
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:26,800
Not that one.
Yeah.

2308
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:28,790
How much do you think you saved on the
second locksmith?

2309
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:32,600
Macho man,
but drake money and had some drinks at

2310
01:45:32,601 --> 01:45:35,120
that bar.
Twenty to 30 bucks.

2311
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:39,400
Yeah.
I kicked in my door once,

2312
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:42,410
didn't have my lock,
did not my key.

2313
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:45,200
Will you with the family?
It was just,

2314
01:45:45,201 --> 01:45:49,730
you know,
I was by myself when I was a was pre

2315
01:45:49,731 --> 01:45:50,990
cell phone days.
oh,

2316
01:45:50,991 --> 01:45:53,150
okay.
I thought front kick the shit out of

2317
01:45:53,151 --> 01:45:55,220
that door and call the dude.
yeah.

2318
01:45:55,230 --> 01:45:56,063
It was like,
what happened?

2319
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:56,931
I was like,
yeah,

2320
01:45:56,931 --> 01:46:00,340
I didn't have my key.
I had to fix the door jam the whole day.

2321
01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:02,420
That,
that little metal thing,

2322
01:46:02,421 --> 01:46:04,010
that.
The thing that waS all bent and fucked

2323
01:46:04,011 --> 01:46:06,200
up.
It's amazing how easy it is to kick open

2324
01:46:06,201 --> 01:46:08,660
the door.
Like when you see those dudes banging

2325
01:46:08,661 --> 01:46:11,390
their shoulder against the door.
If you've got a solid front kick,

2326
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:14,790
there's no way that door survives.
They just open you.

2327
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:18,360
Unless it's a pull for you door.
If it's a pull forward toward here,

2328
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:22,940
fucked like you got to be able to kick
through the door or you have a hard kick

2329
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:26,120
butt at a push open door.
Super easy.

2330
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:27,050
They just open up,

2331
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:30,180
you know,
you said she was solo solo when you did

2332
01:46:30,181 --> 01:46:31,440
it,
but the,

2333
01:46:31,710 --> 01:46:36,420
I just still have a locked image of your
family with you while you pick up to the

2334
01:46:36,421 --> 01:46:37,900
door.
And the kids like,

2335
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,970
well if they were crying,
they were Crying.

2336
01:46:41,971 --> 01:46:45,100
I would.
I kicked open the door once on a set of

2337
01:46:45,101 --> 01:46:47,340
news radio and we blamed on the band
anthrax.

2338
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:48,593
Oh,
it wasn't,

2339
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,170
it wasn't part of a scene.
It was just,

2340
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:54,650
it was a door to the break room.
We were drunk and uh,

2341
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:57,870
I was with uh,
maura maura tierney and she was like,

2342
01:46:57,871 --> 01:46:58,860
god,
I'm fucking hungry.

2343
01:46:58,861 --> 01:47:00,690
I want to get in that break room.
And I'm like,

2344
01:47:00,691 --> 01:47:02,190
I can get in that door.
And she's like,

2345
01:47:02,191 --> 01:47:03,150
how are you getting in the door?
I go,

2346
01:47:03,151 --> 01:47:04,260
I'd have to kick it open.
She goes,

2347
01:47:04,261 --> 01:47:05,310
you can kick open that door.
I go,

2348
01:47:05,311 --> 01:47:07,140
yeah.
And she goes into it like,

2349
01:47:07,141 --> 01:47:07,974
all right,
here we go.

2350
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:10,570
Boom.
I just kicked the shit out of that door

2351
01:47:10,571 --> 01:47:15,150
and it bent the fucking all the shit
that like works inside the door.

2352
01:47:15,330 --> 01:47:16,110
Yeah.
And then.

2353
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:20,940
But it was so worth it.
Is this very shady though to blame it

2354
01:47:20,941 --> 01:47:22,500
on?
That band was wrong.

2355
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,570
They weren't.
They were working on the set that week.

2356
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:25,830
They were on the episode with us

2357
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:29,250
to this day.
Is this an nbc universal?

2358
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:32,230
I think we're on sunset gower at the
time,

2359
01:47:32,450 --> 01:47:33,400
I think.

2360
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:36,250
Yeah,
I just stopped the whole net door.

2361
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:39,710
It was a big old metal door to.
Did you use to add those guys?

2362
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:41,510
Sometimes you need to do some scenes
drunk.

2363
01:47:41,511 --> 01:47:41,991
No,
no.

2364
01:47:41,991 --> 01:47:44,060
This was after the episode.
It had been done.

2365
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:45,980
So pixilated is that?
Yeah,

2366
01:47:45,981 --> 01:47:47,990
that's them on the derrick.
Cool guys though.

2367
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:53,760
I hope a production didn't call them
because we just were like,

2368
01:47:53,761 --> 01:47:54,720
who?
They were like,

2369
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:56,610
who fucked up the door.
LIke who knows?

2370
01:47:56,730 --> 01:47:58,410
And they're like probably that fucking
band.

2371
01:47:58,411 --> 01:47:59,244
Like hm.

2372
01:47:59,490 --> 01:48:00,323
Probably

2373
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:05,920
I would guess it was that band
fucked up a door for like $10 in potato

2374
01:48:06,781 --> 01:48:07,360
chips.

2375
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:08,440
Yeah.
I was wondering what the,

2376
01:48:08,441 --> 01:48:11,200
what the take was just not much.
Just some chips,

2377
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:13,570
snack foods,
whatever was available.

2378
01:48:13,571 --> 01:48:14,920
Good in the moment.
Oh,

2379
01:48:14,921 --> 01:48:16,810
did this.
To be able to do that?

2380
01:48:16,811 --> 01:48:18,160
Feels amazing.
Yeah.

2381
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:23,220
To be able to kick a door open.
My buddy as our gave me this tip about,

2382
01:48:23,321 --> 01:48:26,800
uh,
like when he goes to the movies,

2383
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:32,520
he's ordered as a kid's ticket and
because the people taking the tickets,

2384
01:48:32,741 --> 01:48:35,980
they don't look really.
They just look at the theater number and

2385
01:48:35,981 --> 01:48:37,050
a movie.
Right.

2386
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:41,860
And what I did it the first time it was
two tickets,

2387
01:48:41,861 --> 01:48:45,730
are you saving for bucks or whatever for
some change.

2388
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:51,240
BuT it felt amazing.
It felt like it felt like I'm in any

2389
01:48:51,631 --> 01:48:52,940
heist,
you know,

2390
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:54,220
it felt really good.
It's like,

2391
01:48:54,221 --> 01:48:56,230
yeah.
It's like don't look,

2392
01:48:56,650 --> 01:48:58,420
don't look.
Yeah.

2393
01:48:58,421 --> 01:48:59,560
The girl didn't want to do that shit.

2394
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:00,930
She was like,
why are you doing that?

2395
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:02,120
So you're with a girl,
you

2396
01:49:03,930 --> 01:49:05,190
can't do that with a girl.
Yes.

2397
01:49:05,191 --> 01:49:08,860
You can just show them who you are.
This is me,

2398
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:14,160
I am unreasonably cheap.
This is who I am seeing a moVie

2399
01:49:14,801 --> 01:49:16,180
together,
setting the stage two.

2400
01:49:16,181 --> 01:49:20,530
So like when that prenup come,
she understands she's not going to go.

2401
01:49:20,531 --> 01:49:22,240
I can't believe you brought a prenup.
Yeah.

2402
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:23,650
She was like,
of course,

2403
01:49:23,770 --> 01:49:25,660
you know me,
I cheated them.

2404
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:28,720
Any theater to pretend to be a kid for
four bucks.

2405
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:32,380
Exactly.
But that four bucks that sending you,

2406
01:49:32,470 --> 01:49:35,260
you know,
since your brain into a great place,

2407
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:39,700
a lot of women really get upset by it.
But cheapness,

2408
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:41,830
yo,
I,

2409
01:49:41,831 --> 01:49:45,430
uh,
I was actually,

2410
01:49:45,431 --> 01:49:47,980
I was out with this girl in and

2411
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:48,820
we,
uh,

2412
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:53,530
we went to this club,
she was driving and we parked in this

2413
01:49:53,531 --> 01:49:56,320
parking lot.
It's like one of those situations where

2414
01:49:56,321 --> 01:49:59,950
you park in a parking lot.
It was a dentist office,

2415
01:49:59,951 --> 01:50:04,900
but now somebody is charging for it.
And so my Immediate question,

2416
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:07,060
like five bucks for the parking spot.
Right.

2417
01:50:07,330 --> 01:50:09,160
But my immediate question is,
does he,

2418
01:50:09,190 --> 01:50:11,050
is it,
do they have a deal with this dentist

2419
01:50:11,051 --> 01:50:16,051
office or do they just charge at night
for people to park in his dentist off?

2420
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:19,960
Because you're not the dentist.
Why can you come up?

2421
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:22,660
And I was telling him,
I'm like,

2422
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,790
yo,
I told her that I was going to say that

2423
01:50:24,791 --> 01:50:25,960
before we got out the car.
I was like,

2424
01:50:25,961 --> 01:50:26,541
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna.

2425
01:50:26,541 --> 01:50:28,210
Ask him if he's a dentist.
I'm not gone.

2426
01:50:28,810 --> 01:50:31,150
And she was like,
and then we'd get out.

2427
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:32,770
You're not the dentist.
She was like,

2428
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:35,890
what the fuck is calling?
She was upset that you actually did it.

2429
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,520
Yeah.
And so I was really about,

2430
01:50:37,521 --> 01:50:38,141
it'd be like,
what?

2431
01:50:38,141 --> 01:50:42,100
Like what's the chances of it getting
told like I was really not because of

2432
01:50:42,101 --> 01:50:43,960
the,
I think the cheapest was a part of it,

2433
01:50:43,961 --> 01:50:47,440
but it was genuinely I wanted to know
the reality of the situation.

2434
01:50:47,610 --> 01:50:49,810
Right.
And did they explain to,

2435
01:50:49,811 --> 01:50:51,430
you know,
I just,

2436
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:53,410
she was getting upset and I just paid
the $5.

2437
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:58,330
She got real upset.
Not upset,

2438
01:50:58,331 --> 01:51:02,260
but enough where she wasn't.
We didn't have the same sense of humor

2439
01:51:02,261 --> 01:51:04,330
and a frugality,
whereas she,

2440
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:07,510
we weren't on the same wavelength as far
as that interaction.

2441
01:51:07,511 --> 01:51:10,180
So she wasn't rolling with me.
That trumps a lot of women crazy.

2442
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:13,660
Find out that you cheap.
Yeah.

2443
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:17,320
It was supposed to be bold,
like that's one thing that women like

2444
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,150
that I feel like when dudes make it
rain,

2445
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:20,710
right.
You throw in a bunch of money in the

2446
01:51:20,711 --> 01:51:21,790
air,
you don't give a fuck.

2447
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:25,300
There's something about that that like,
it's exciting coming up out that

2448
01:51:25,330 --> 01:51:30,100
strippers like that,
but the average women won't like that.

2449
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:30,963
Right.
That's true.

2450
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:33,880
It's,
but it's a male move.

2451
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:36,400
Talk to make it rain as trip couples a
total mail move.

2452
01:51:36,430 --> 01:51:38,470
Right.
It's a saying that you don't give a fuck

2453
01:51:38,471 --> 01:51:40,240
about money.
It's chuck it up in the air.

2454
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:43,570
I mean,
there's a lot behInd that.

2455
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:46,480
I haven't bought out in the strip club
like that,

2456
01:51:46,481 --> 01:51:51,481
but I think the most I've spent in the
night in the strip club is maybe 800,

2457
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:55,690
something like that.
Uh,

2458
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:59,650
Which in atlanta is.
I spent two months In atlanta this

2459
01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:00,850
summer.
That's pretty low.

2460
01:52:00,851 --> 01:52:03,130
You know,
there's some guys that go and just have

2461
01:52:03,131 --> 01:52:04,810
10,
10 grants such and such.

2462
01:52:04,811 --> 01:52:07,720
This rapper spent 20 grand in the strip
club,

2463
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:12,370
which is,
it's shocking and frightening to me.

2464
01:52:12,590 --> 01:52:13,230
Uh,
yeah.

2465
01:52:13,230 --> 01:52:14,530
Lana is famous for that,
right?

2466
01:52:14,590 --> 01:52:15,850
Yeah.
It's great.

2467
01:52:15,851 --> 01:52:17,890
Strip clubs in atlanta.
I was just there.

2468
01:52:17,891 --> 01:52:19,390
I was there friday.
I was at the tabernacle.

2469
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:21,220
Yeah.
It's a fun time,

2470
01:52:21,221 --> 01:52:22,880
man.
City man.

2471
01:52:22,881 --> 01:52:24,940
It's a city.
It's a,

2472
01:52:24,941 --> 01:52:26,470
it's a,
it's a good night life.

2473
01:52:26,650 --> 01:52:29,780
And,
but yet the strip club where it says

2474
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:31,720
it's a spectacle,
you know what I mean?

2475
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:34,210
So you just.
I mean it's fun,

2476
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:37,180
but I went there a few times.
Who's throwing money?

2477
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:39,310
Who's at a 21?
Savage.

2478
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:41,120
It's 21 savage,
young thug.

2479
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:43,540
They are on a stage.
Maybe they did a song or something,

2480
01:52:44,470 --> 01:52:45,350
but it's just

2481
01:52:46,150 --> 01:52:49,100
a throw money on everybody.
See it says.

2482
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:55,180
But that is a thing like the flamboyance
of not worrying at all about grinding to

2483
01:52:55,881 --> 01:52:57,860
the point where you just throw it up in
the air.

2484
01:52:58,250 --> 01:53:01,730
Yeah,
it was a boxing girl with that.

2485
01:53:01,731 --> 01:53:05,900
mIght be,
that might be king of diamonds.

2486
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:08,020
You don't want them.
Me on paper.

2487
01:53:08,021 --> 01:53:09,770
I said atlanta because atlanta up
around.

2488
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:11,211
Uh,
yeah.

2489
01:53:11,211 --> 01:53:15,770
It's some of the strip clubs.
They have girls boxing and king of

2490
01:53:15,771 --> 01:53:19,430
diamonds in miami.
I went there once on a monday.

2491
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:23,720
They have girls boxing.
It's a huge strip club.

2492
01:53:23,721 --> 01:53:25,760
I don't like my strip clubs used it over
with,

2493
01:53:25,761 --> 01:53:28,240
I like my strip clubs,
kinda like dive bars,

2494
01:53:28,850 --> 01:53:33,850
like a certain strip clubs.
If you walk in and you throw up a couple

2495
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:37,250
hundred dollars,
like you can kind of take over the

2496
01:53:37,251 --> 01:53:39,180
energy of the place.
Uh,

2497
01:53:39,250 --> 01:53:42,410
like all the strippers and started
coming to you and shit had a small point

2498
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:43,730
at a smaller place.

2499
01:53:43,850 --> 01:53:48,160
King of diamonds.
That's where rIck ross hangs out like

2500
01:53:48,161 --> 01:53:48,660
that.
Yeah.

2501
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:50,990
Mayweather through something.
Then I can see that chemo,

2502
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:56,020
diamonds and it has a basketball court.
I think we talked about strip clubs last

2503
01:53:57,621 --> 01:54:01,010
time we were here doing happened.
Uh,

2504
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:03,590
when they have a basketball court in
there.

2505
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:07,590
and a barber shop in the strip club.
Yeah,

2506
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:12,230
a barbershop and a basketball court.
Why they have a basketball court?

2507
01:54:12,290 --> 01:54:16,550
Because sometimes before you want to
just get your endorphins going before

2508
01:54:16,551 --> 01:54:17,870
you throw out of money,
I guess.

2509
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:20,060
Or maybe the strippers like to play
basketball.

2510
01:54:20,230 --> 01:54:21,890
I don't know.
Weird.

2511
01:54:22,130 --> 01:54:24,000
Interesting.
But it's a.

2512
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:28,730
The music is great.
That's a weird strip cup too because the

2513
01:54:28,731 --> 01:54:30,410
girls were close.
What's going on?

2514
01:54:30,650 --> 01:54:34,400
I think this is the preamble.
This is the youtube version.

2515
01:54:35,780 --> 01:54:38,030
To get them warmed up.
You want to go to vimeo?

2516
01:54:38,031 --> 01:54:39,190
You can see the,
uh,

2517
01:54:39,310 --> 01:54:40,143
the real deal.

2518
01:54:40,950 --> 01:54:42,240
Oh,
does vimeo show nudity?

2519
01:54:42,310 --> 01:54:43,250
Yeah.
No,

2520
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:45,690
it's interesting.
What's the rules with twitter?

2521
01:54:45,990 --> 01:54:48,300
Because I follow some porn stars.
Yeah,

2522
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:50,670
they,
they show full on fucking,

2523
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:52,650
uh,
I think that's it.

2524
01:54:52,710 --> 01:54:54,480
You could do it.
That's amazing.

2525
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:57,240
Sometimes I forget that I followed
pornhub on twitter

2526
01:54:59,270 --> 01:55:03,110
and then I'll be scrolling through and
it's just a gift of some,

2527
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:04,940
just some part,
but.

2528
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:06,080
Oh yeah.
Well,

2529
01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:06,420
it's a real

2530
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:08,080
problem.
If yOu leave your phone around,

2531
01:55:08,081 --> 01:55:10,510
your kids grab it when they scroll
through your feed,

2532
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:11,403
like,
hey,

2533
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:12,450
throw,
scroll through the home,

2534
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:13,270
feed

2535
01:55:13,270 --> 01:55:13,940
it.
Got it.

2536
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:15,830
I mean they to see it somehow.

2537
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:23,600
Just one of those animated gif files,
15 seconds of acid deck.

2538
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:24,693
Woo.

2539
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:29,390
It's amazing that they can have that on
twitter with the millions and millions

2540
01:55:29,390 --> 01:55:30,470
and millions of like,
that doesn't bother them.

2541
01:55:31,050 --> 01:55:35,130
I mean there's worse things on twitter.
president.

2542
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:35,993
What

2543
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:38,490
did you see that,
that woman,

2544
01:55:38,491 --> 01:55:40,680
valerie,
I don't know how you say her name is

2545
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:43,800
valerie plam or plume.
Something like that.

2546
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:47,670
she's the cia operative that was outed
by,

2547
01:55:48,270 --> 01:55:50,490
I guess it was dick cheney,
I think.

2548
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:52,110
Um,
it was a big deal,

2549
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:56,970
like a because he had said something or
husband had said some things that dick

2550
01:55:56,971 --> 01:56:00,420
cheney out at her and it like
compromised her position and compromise

2551
01:56:00,421 --> 01:56:02,160
the mission she was working on.
Anyway,

2552
01:56:02,161 --> 01:56:06,060
she's working now on buying twitter to
kick Donald Trump off.

2553
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:10,880
Valerie p l a m e n I do not know how to
say no.

2554
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:14,610
She's crowdfunding to buy twitter to
kickoff Donald Trump.

2555
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:19,290
She wants to buy twitter just so they
could kick billion dollar goal.

2556
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:23,340
She made 85 grand so far by the law.
I got news for you,

2557
01:56:23,341 --> 01:56:25,560
honey.
Twitter is not for sale for a billion

2558
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:28,560
dollars at twitter for a billion dollar.
That's nice.

2559
01:56:28,561 --> 01:56:30,570
Come back when you've got about $7
billion out of him.

2560
01:56:30,571 --> 01:56:32,250
Valerie,
give that money to houston.

2561
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:33,990
Fuck outta here.
That'll make it.

2562
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:38,070
How much money do you think?
Like how much moneY is twitter worth?

2563
01:56:38,071 --> 01:56:39,930
Like if twitter was going to be for
sale,

2564
01:56:40,130 --> 01:56:42,900
it had to be for sale first.
He would have to be lIke $15 billion.

2565
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:45,640
Right.
Insane potential.

2566
01:56:45,690 --> 01:56:46,090
But yeah,

2567
01:56:46,090 --> 01:56:51,090
this is the thing with twitter from the
little bit that I know is that it in

2568
01:56:52,961 --> 01:56:57,490
comparison to the other social medias,
they've had travel.

2569
01:56:57,820 --> 01:56:58,970
Monetize.
Yeah.

2570
01:56:59,620 --> 01:57:00,670
In,
uh,

2571
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:04,060
in the same way.
So like instagram is making money.

2572
01:57:04,061 --> 01:57:06,820
Facebook obviously making money and his
whole body up.

2573
01:57:06,821 --> 01:57:11,821
Snapchat is doing what twitter hasn't
figured out how to get real revenue,

2574
01:57:12,251 --> 01:57:16,030
like people use twitter and,
and are active on it and live tweet

2575
01:57:16,031 --> 01:57:18,280
events.
But as far as the money,

2576
01:57:18,730 --> 01:57:21,070
it hasn't been.
It's been lagging

2577
01:57:21,140 --> 01:57:23,120
in comparison.
Do you understand that?

2578
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:24,500
It doesn't make sense to me.
Like,

2579
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:28,190
like instagram has sponsored tweets with
that saY,

2580
01:57:28,370 --> 01:57:32,600
what are you putting up there?
The market value of 15 point 7 billion

2581
01:57:32,601 --> 01:57:34,340
for twitter a year ago.
Yeah.

2582
01:57:34,430 --> 01:57:36,470
So why is that?
Chick thinks she can get it for a

2583
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:37,550
billion bucks.
She's tripping.

2584
01:57:37,580 --> 01:57:39,020
She's just trying to get attention,
right?

2585
01:57:39,370 --> 01:57:40,203
Yeah.

2586
01:57:40,370 --> 01:57:41,290
actually smoke.
Well,

2587
01:57:41,291 --> 01:57:43,600
you think it's just,
that's just pure,

2588
01:57:44,350 --> 01:57:49,350
just anger to come up with anger because
anger at not just to have the initial

2589
01:57:50,530 --> 01:57:55,300
weirdo wackadoodle not going to happen.
I did,

2590
01:57:55,810 --> 01:57:59,110
buT because I've had a lot of those
didn't calm down.

2591
01:57:59,470 --> 01:58:04,470
Yeah.
So to go through somebody like fucking

2592
01:58:04,950 --> 01:58:07,840
do a crowdfunding twitter that's so
stupid.

2593
01:58:07,841 --> 01:58:12,670
and then to actually like go onto the
site and then write it up.

2594
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:14,560
Yeah,
put your picture up there.

2595
01:58:14,590 --> 01:58:18,520
Yeah.
And then look at it proofread and go

2596
01:58:18,521 --> 01:58:20,440
through all that shit and still be like,
yeah,

2597
01:58:20,530 --> 01:58:25,530
still crowdfund for twitter.
Still be on board with the idea and post

2598
01:58:25,721 --> 01:58:26,290
just,

2599
01:58:26,290 --> 01:58:29,590
it's so stupid because there's 350
million people in this country.

2600
01:58:29,591 --> 01:58:33,430
if every single person what's mesh?
She just wants to become the largest

2601
01:58:33,431 --> 01:58:35,630
shareholder so she can make the
decision.

2602
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:38,650
Oh.
Which is why the fuck would anybody give

2603
01:58:38,651 --> 01:58:40,780
her that money?
You're giving her that money.

2604
01:58:40,781 --> 01:58:42,650
like if you gave her 100 grand,
how do you.

2605
01:58:42,670 --> 01:58:46,210
Does she give you an accounting form of
what she's doing with that 100 grand?

2606
01:58:46,390 --> 01:58:47,800
That's so stupid.
No one's going to die.

2607
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:52,120
I can't believe she got 85 grand.
That's amazing in and of itself.

2608
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,690
Well,
the final number at the end,

2609
01:58:53,691 --> 01:58:57,950
the end of that number is seven,
which means somebody gave like $2 or

2610
01:58:57,951 --> 01:58:59,900
one.
Somebody gave a weird off.

2611
01:58:59,901 --> 01:59:02,630
Now
I don't have much,

2612
01:59:02,631 --> 01:59:04,100
but good luck.
yeah.

2613
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:05,510
Who's going to give more than five
bucks?

2614
01:59:05,540 --> 01:59:07,280
Let's look at it.
Eight because sometimes they show the

2615
01:59:07,281 --> 01:59:11,000
names of people that,
that gave stuff and like what they,

2616
01:59:11,001 --> 01:59:12,320
uh,
what they said.

2617
01:59:12,470 --> 01:59:15,470
And so let's just see victoria needs.
Let's do this now.

2618
01:59:15,970 --> 01:59:17,500
And what else?
Uh,

2619
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:19,180
no.
the way he tweets,

2620
01:59:19,190 --> 01:59:23,330
like get this out of office and put them
weight can cause damage.

2621
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:28,180
$5.
Look at that

2622
01:59:28,290 --> 01:59:29,810
tweet that he made.
Look at the tweets.

2623
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:31,740
Crawled back up jamie to where it was
before.

2624
01:59:31,830 --> 01:59:35,220
So you could see trump's tweet.
We'll get that military solutions and

2625
01:59:35,221 --> 01:59:36,870
now fully in place.
No po,

2626
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:41,900
no pay space between comma and locked.
So typos galore.

2627
01:59:42,061 --> 01:59:44,370
Locked and loaded.
No comma,

2628
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,450
no space again.
Should North Korea act unwisely?

2629
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:52,550
And then douBle space the fuck that's
about hopefully kim jong un.

2630
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,810
We'll find another path.
Exclamation point.

2631
01:59:55,560 --> 02:00:00,440
It's just like,
it's like you took some housewife from

2632
02:00:00,441 --> 02:00:03,140
middle of nowhere and allowed her to be
president.

2633
02:00:03,230 --> 02:00:06,650
I mean,
that's literally like the mindset of

2634
02:00:06,651 --> 02:00:09,020
that tweet.
It's just silly tweet.

2635
02:00:09,830 --> 02:00:11,720
Hopefully he'll find another path.

2636
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:16,330
I mean,
hopefully he's a is.

2637
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:20,520
Are you dIsturbed?
I don't know if I'm even disturbed

2638
02:00:20,521 --> 02:00:22,620
anymore If I'm kinda like,
oh,

2639
02:00:22,621 --> 02:00:24,730
if I'm numb in a.
Yeah,

2640
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:28,020
in a kind of a.
I dunno,

2641
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:31,740
like domestic situation where I was just
like,

2642
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:33,340
yeah,
domestic violence.

2643
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:34,920
So yeah,
yeah,

2644
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:36,630
yeah.
Like your wife.

2645
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:37,890
That's what he said.
Yeah.

2646
02:00:37,891 --> 02:00:41,940
He went to Texas and,
and like to see the flood damage and was

2647
02:00:41,941 --> 02:00:42,660
like,
yeah,

2648
02:00:42,660 --> 02:00:43,860
good crowd.
Big crowd.

2649
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:46,820
that's what it is.
It's kind of crowd.

2650
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:49,010
What a crowd here to see me right now?
Everybody.

2651
02:00:49,011 --> 02:00:50,000
Yay.

2652
02:00:50,090 --> 02:00:50,923
no,
I don't think.

2653
02:00:51,270 --> 02:00:54,590
I don't think I'm disturbed.
I just don't think it was.

2654
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:58,780
I knew it would be bad.
I don't think it would be this,

2655
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:03,530
get this bad,
this court this quick and yeah,

2656
02:01:03,531 --> 02:01:06,080
it's really,
it's fascinating.

2657
02:01:06,150 --> 02:01:09,030
The thing that fascinates me the most,
it's not just him,

2658
02:01:09,270 --> 02:01:12,420
but how many people still support him?
How many pieces of any problem with it?

2659
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:16,830
Yeah,
I try to.

2660
02:01:17,550 --> 02:01:22,550
I can't understand it really with a.
They still are behind you behind all of

2661
02:01:22,771 --> 02:01:26,460
this or is it just where they have a
similar.

2662
02:01:26,461 --> 02:01:29,190
Just the people that are really into
him.

2663
02:01:29,370 --> 02:01:34,370
Are they the same type of just egomaniac
or a narcissist is where they can't

2664
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:38,670
admit wrong or they know that it's
wrong,

2665
02:01:38,671 --> 02:01:41,210
but that I can't.
I'm locked in now.

2666
02:01:41,370 --> 02:01:44,730
They're locked in.
I think they're finding a way to justify

2667
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:49,260
whatever he does no matter what it is.
Like I had a cow bell yesterday on the

2668
02:01:49,261 --> 02:01:50,940
podcast.
I didn't read.

2669
02:01:51,210 --> 02:01:54,270
I don't read comments on youtube,
but I did look at the thumbs up,

2670
02:01:54,271 --> 02:01:59,271
thumbs down and it's like he had as many
thumbs down as thumbs up.

2671
02:01:59,310 --> 02:02:03,060
That's super rare and I think a lot of
it was because he was talking a lot of

2672
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:04,460
shit about trump.
We were both were.

2673
02:02:04,461 --> 02:02:08,790
We were talking about how ridiculous
this is and I saw a couple of comments

2674
02:02:08,791 --> 02:02:10,800
on twitter,
people that got mad because we were

2675
02:02:10,801 --> 02:02:13,920
talking about his response to
charlottesville and they were saying he

2676
02:02:13,921 --> 02:02:18,690
was saying on all sides because there
was violence on all sides,

2677
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:24,000
like people showed up with torches.
They showed up wIth torches for white

2678
02:02:26,041 --> 02:02:27,210
folks.
They were like,

2679
02:02:27,211 --> 02:02:30,580
we're here for white folks only we have
torches like you don't.

2680
02:02:30,581 --> 02:02:33,690
You don't think that's an issue.
You don't think people showing up a line

2681
02:02:33,930 --> 02:02:38,730
of crazy white supremacists with torches
and the people that were opposing them,

2682
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:39,960
the people that are opposing them.
Yeah,

2683
02:02:40,170 --> 02:02:42,110
they fucked up too,
but the only reason why we're there

2684
02:02:42,111 --> 02:02:44,580
we're there is because there was people
with torches.

2685
02:02:45,420 --> 02:02:46,350
The whole thing is insane

2686
02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:51,420
is a and he doesn't have the.
I mean he doesn't know how to handle it

2687
02:02:53,380 --> 02:02:56,080
and I was like,
he can't say that publicly.

2688
02:02:56,110 --> 02:02:57,760
He can say,
hey guys,

2689
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:01,120
I'm panicking right now.
No,

2690
02:03:01,150 --> 02:03:04,270
he never said that,
but he can't say it explicitly,

2691
02:03:04,271 --> 02:03:08,410
but he kinda says it through his ax.
I don't think he's healthy.

2692
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:10,870
Also too.
I think when you're 70 years old,

2693
02:03:10,871 --> 02:03:12,790
like you were talking about,
like your brain gets older,

2694
02:03:12,791 --> 02:03:13,780
you're 34,
right?

2695
02:03:14,590 --> 02:03:17,260
I'm 50 now.
My brain's getting older for sure.

2696
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:19,130
What's it gonna be like in 22,
23 years.

2697
02:03:19,131 --> 02:03:19,890
So what does he took?
Third,

2698
02:03:19,890 --> 02:03:21,190
71,
72,

2699
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:22,990
something like that.
What's that going to be like?

2700
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:26,290
Not good.
I don't think you should be working all

2701
02:03:26,290 --> 02:03:28,180
day.
Yeah.

2702
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:29,610
That dude,
uh,

2703
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,580
he's too old and he's a,
he's a crazy person.

2704
02:03:33,581 --> 02:03:38,130
And he used to host the apprentice and
he was on comedy central roast amongst

2705
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:40,500
other things
to watch.

2706
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:44,610
That's not to say that those things,
uh,

2707
02:03:44,690 --> 02:03:49,390
I mean you can't be solid at a being
president,

2708
02:03:49,391 --> 02:03:50,800
but this guy,

2709
02:03:51,700 --> 02:03:53,920
you say he still watches five hours of
tv a day.

2710
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:57,010
That's what I read yesterday.
Who reported that?

2711
02:03:57,020 --> 02:04:02,020
Routers,
If I find a bunch of fake news,

2712
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:05,470
how could anybody have time to watch
five hours of tv a day if you have a

2713
02:04:05,471 --> 02:04:07,300
real job?
Wasn't brand new particle,

2714
02:04:07,301 --> 02:04:10,480
but trump's session is a first look at
that hair.

2715
02:04:10,630 --> 02:04:13,660
Hilarious.
Like that they can just take a photo of

2716
02:04:13,661 --> 02:04:15,160
his hair.
Only black,

2717
02:04:15,161 --> 02:04:18,010
everything out.
That is the most bizarre image of a

2718
02:04:18,011 --> 02:04:22,470
president.
That crazy helmet of hair got mixed it

2719
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:24,190
up.
when you have a photo editor,

2720
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:29,410
it's a good move actually because no
president has consumed as much hold on.

2721
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:32,590
Nope.
Presidents confused as much television

2722
02:04:32,591 --> 02:04:36,490
in the current one or reacted as quickly
or directly to what they're seeing.

2723
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:41,310
He loves fox and frIends.
Six 24:00 AM monday.

2724
02:04:41,311 --> 02:04:45,120
Trump gushed over twitter about the
amazing reporting and quotes on the

2725
02:04:45,121 --> 02:04:47,070
morning talk show a week earlier.

2726
02:04:47,490 --> 02:04:50,700
He instructed the nation to in parenths
in quotes,

2727
02:04:50,790 --> 02:04:54,930
watch fox and friends now for their
exemplary really Russia coverage.

2728
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:58,770
Exemplary.
Really laurie exemplary Russia coverage.

2729
02:04:58,980 --> 02:05:03,870
He tweeted about the program hosted by
steve dewey dokey duty.

2730
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:05,530
How do you say that?
Juicy,

2731
02:05:05,670 --> 02:05:10,670
juicy dukie dukie like poo a aynsley.
What are these people's names?

2732
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:17,900
Ainslie earnhardt and brian kilmeade
seven times in march alone.

2733
02:05:19,890 --> 02:05:21,150
And uh,
recently brought up,

2734
02:05:21,210 --> 02:05:24,600
brought it up in an interview with fox
news' tucker carlson,

2735
02:05:24,601 --> 02:05:27,900
telling him cheerfully.
I liked that group of three people

2736
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:34,230
even after becoming president.
Trump reportedly manages to fIll his

2737
02:05:34,230 --> 02:05:37,560
days with plenty of television in quotes
and from his tweets.

2738
02:05:37,561 --> 02:05:39,990
It's often possible to discern when and
what he's watching,

2739
02:05:39,991 --> 02:05:43,770
and january,
axios broke down the president's media

2740
02:05:43,771 --> 02:05:45,240
diet.
Most mornings,

2741
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:48,180
trump flicks on the tv and watch his
morning joe,

2742
02:05:48,330 --> 02:05:51,030
but he hates that guy now.
Not anymore.

2743
02:05:51,090 --> 02:05:51,780
Now he hates that guy.

2744
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:56,400
He talk shit about his wife's plastic
surgery often for long periods of time,

2745
02:05:56,550 --> 02:05:59,460
sometimes interrupted with text to the
host or panelists.

2746
02:05:59,461 --> 02:06:02,940
He Texts them after the 6:00 AM hour of
joe.

2747
02:06:02,970 --> 02:06:07,130
He's often onto fox and friends.
Wow.

2748
02:06:07,580 --> 02:06:11,340
What a little cnn before or after,
just to fucking get the blood pressure

2749
02:06:11,341 --> 02:06:13,290
up.
He also catches the sunday show,

2750
02:06:13,291 --> 02:06:15,570
especially meet the press,
the shows,

2751
02:06:15,571 --> 02:06:18,600
as he calls them,
often provoke his tweets.

2752
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:23,310
The day of our interview with him,
all of his tweet topics were discussed

2753
02:06:23,311 --> 02:06:25,890
and we've discussed during the first two
hours of morning,

2754
02:06:25,891 --> 02:06:28,830
joe,
wow.

2755
02:06:29,430 --> 02:06:31,290
Five hours of television every Day says,
yes,

2756
02:06:31,291 --> 02:06:35,160
I got fIve a day,
but too much.

2757
02:06:35,190 --> 02:06:40,190
And also he is weird that the president
is easily debatable on twitter.

2758
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:46,550
More so to me,
you see when stephen colbert got them

2759
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:48,750
and then colby said,
you know,

2760
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:49,591
mr,
president,

2761
02:06:49,591 --> 02:06:51,540
as much as I think you're terrible,
it'd be the president.

2762
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:54,960
I thought the very least you understood
show business and goes,

2763
02:06:54,961 --> 02:06:57,960
you responded to me because that means I
won.

2764
02:06:58,650 --> 02:07:00,400
I got you.
Yeah.

2765
02:07:02,370 --> 02:07:06,210
That was when he called,
when he called trump's mouth at cock

2766
02:07:06,211 --> 02:07:07,850
holster for putin.
Oh,

2767
02:07:07,910 --> 02:07:09,750
it as a great job.
It was a great joke,

2768
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:14,130
but it's crazy like seeing that on a
late night talk show,

2769
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:19,400
a late night talk show on cbs.
The hosts calls the president's mouth.

2770
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:23,160
Believe caught.
I don't know what they did.

2771
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:26,130
They probably it.
But you knew what it was.

2772
02:07:26,190 --> 02:07:27,090
Yeah,
a coc.

2773
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:30,420
He's saying that
he know what he's saying,

2774
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:33,330
but the fact that that was in the
monologue that cbs is like,

2775
02:07:33,331 --> 02:07:34,164
yeah,
go for it.

2776
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:36,380
I mean,
no other president do.

2777
02:07:36,450 --> 02:07:38,530
You would never have that.
Not in a million years.

2778
02:07:38,830 --> 02:07:41,170
The elect,
the minimal amount of respect.

2779
02:07:41,230 --> 02:07:43,810
No fcc fined for stephen colbert.
Late night.

2780
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:45,730
Donald trump cock holster crack.

2781
02:07:46,150 --> 02:07:48,370
Wow.
Yeah.

2782
02:07:48,371 --> 02:07:52,510
They believed it was trump trying to go
after it for the fcc.

2783
02:07:53,710 --> 02:07:56,380
Do you remember when the fcc went after
howard stern?

2784
02:07:56,710 --> 02:08:01,710
People forget about that shit.
He got fined and he didn't even swear he

2785
02:08:02,171 --> 02:08:04,930
got fined hundreds of thousands of
dollars.

2786
02:08:05,140 --> 02:08:06,520
Shit.
Yeah.

2787
02:08:06,850 --> 02:08:09,940
How do you think how you think it is his
guy?

2788
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:13,090
You think he ends his term?
You think he dies in office?

2789
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:15,350
You think he,
uh,

2790
02:08:17,320 --> 02:08:20,410
uh,
he gets impeached.

2791
02:08:21,670 --> 02:08:25,690
You think what happens with trump?
That's a good question.

2792
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:29,650
I don't think he gets a second term,
but you think he makes it wrong.

2793
02:08:29,651 --> 02:08:31,210
I think he makes it to the end of the
term.

2794
02:08:31,510 --> 02:08:34,690
Yeah.
I think it's just how long wheels on a

2795
02:08:34,691 --> 02:08:36,910
giant disaster and it gets worse and
worse.

2796
02:08:37,060 --> 02:08:39,220
And I think.
Here's the thing that howard stern had a

2797
02:08:39,221 --> 02:08:42,490
really good point about trump.
He said he wants to be loved.

2798
02:08:42,490 --> 02:08:45,640
He wants people to love him.
This is a terrible job if you want

2799
02:08:45,641 --> 02:08:47,890
people to love you because even the
people that supported you,

2800
02:08:48,040 --> 02:08:50,830
once you get in there,
you're trying to do this impossible job

2801
02:08:50,831 --> 02:08:51,131
there.
Really.

2802
02:08:51,131 --> 02:08:56,131
No one's been able to do totally.
People forget that obama had like a very

2803
02:08:57,041 --> 02:08:59,740
low approval rating too at one point in
time in his presidency.

2804
02:08:59,741 --> 02:09:03,580
I think he was in the low forties,
like 44 percent or something like that.

2805
02:09:04,150 --> 02:09:08,230
Approval rating.
Like it's not a job that anybody does.

2806
02:09:08,231 --> 02:09:10,240
Well,
even if you're the best at ever,

2807
02:09:10,241 --> 02:09:12,970
you still people a giant percentage of
the population.

2808
02:09:12,980 --> 02:09:14,920
Millions and millions of people are
going to fucking hate you.

2809
02:09:15,310 --> 02:09:18,160
That's not,
I don't think that's in that guy psyche.

2810
02:09:18,370 --> 02:09:20,260
Especially if you check twitter like
that.

2811
02:09:20,290 --> 02:09:21,123
Yeah,
you can.

2812
02:09:21,980 --> 02:09:25,510
Yeah,
you can block himself from it a when he

2813
02:09:25,511 --> 02:09:27,700
broke,
he blocks regular people when regular

2814
02:09:27,701 --> 02:09:29,650
people black himself from that.

2815
02:09:29,650 --> 02:09:32,170
Yes.
But just like by delete that off his

2816
02:09:32,171 --> 02:09:33,760
phone,
he can kinda get away from it,

2817
02:09:33,761 --> 02:09:36,550
but I don't think he could just take
that attention away from him.

2818
02:09:36,551 --> 02:09:37,930
So no,
I don't think so either.

2819
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:40,330
I just don't think it's healthy for
them,

2820
02:09:40,331 --> 02:09:43,300
especially at this late stage of his
life,

2821
02:09:43,390 --> 02:09:46,870
you know,
seventies taking this kind of heat

2822
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:50,590
because before he was president,
that guy,

2823
02:09:50,591 --> 02:09:52,120
whether people,
some people didn't like,

2824
02:09:52,121 --> 02:09:53,440
um,
some people loved them,

2825
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:58,030
no big deal.
He was genuinely generally able to like

2826
02:09:58,031 --> 02:10:01,150
walk around everywhere and not be hated.
Like he'd go to restaurant.

2827
02:10:01,151 --> 02:10:01,811
People go,
oh look,

2828
02:10:01,811 --> 02:10:03,030
there's Donald Trump.
There's no,

2829
02:10:03,060 --> 02:10:04,300
no.
People were like hating him.

2830
02:10:05,890 --> 02:10:10,720
His face kind of a douche bag maybe.
I like how you said that.

2831
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:12,750
Maybe goes back,
whatever.

2832
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:14,860
That was tough over there.
Nobody was better.

2833
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:17,500
Yeah.
They might laugh or by try to get a

2834
02:10:17,501 --> 02:10:19,480
selfie with them and asked him a
question,

2835
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:24,840
but now the amount of hate he
experiences is probably like four or 500

2836
02:10:25,271 --> 02:10:28,570
percent more,
more even ramped up through the roof.

2837
02:10:28,700 --> 02:10:33,460
It's a five digit weird number or
something crazy quantifiable.

2838
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:34,473
Hey

2839
02:10:34,550 --> 02:10:37,310
man.
With the weird hair from the apprentice.

2840
02:10:37,350 --> 02:10:38,930
Yeah.
everybody just wants to take a free shot

2841
02:10:38,931 --> 02:10:40,730
at them too.
Like everywhere he goes,

2842
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:45,890
poor bastard.
people are building goddamn careers off

2843
02:10:45,891 --> 02:10:47,660
of hate.
The trump,

2844
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:50,480
the president's show on comedy central.
That's true.

2845
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:55,520
God damn cold bear has been founded in
the radiance lately because he's been

2846
02:10:55,521 --> 02:11:00,140
ripping on him because I making that
goddamn legacy off of this being an

2847
02:11:00,230 --> 02:11:02,840
asshole.
People mad at fallon because found too

2848
02:11:02,841 --> 02:11:04,190
nice to him when he was running for
president.

2849
02:11:04,191 --> 02:11:06,410
The hair thing.
I mean it was already a done deal.

2850
02:11:06,411 --> 02:11:09,490
Then you think fallon was gone run?
No,

2851
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:12,410
but it was that fallon didn't grill him.
He didn't.

2852
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:15,230
It didn't pressure him.
That's when people are mad at that.

2853
02:11:15,231 --> 02:11:16,850
He didn't treat him like a dangerous
person.

2854
02:11:17,530 --> 02:11:19,610
ProbablY had no idea that he was going
to win too.

2855
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:21,470
Yeah,
it was jokey at that point.

2856
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:24,410
Had had play one of those weird games
and then cheated.

2857
02:11:24,860 --> 02:11:29,860
Fuck you with her face.
Big smile muscles.

2858
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:35,210
His hair up.
Uh hm.

2859
02:11:35,990 --> 02:11:38,420
Very weird.
Yeah.

2860
02:11:39,050 --> 02:11:39,950
It's very weird.

2861
02:11:43,230 --> 02:11:45,320
It's just so strange that that's our
president.

2862
02:11:45,430 --> 02:11:48,170
It's hard to believe sometimes.
LIke sometimes I'll stare at the news

2863
02:11:48,171 --> 02:11:50,960
and I just have to look at it for like
seconds,

2864
02:11:51,170 --> 02:11:52,490
like 10,
15 seconds.

2865
02:11:52,491 --> 02:11:53,990
Just go,
okay,

2866
02:11:54,620 --> 02:11:55,940
this is real.
This is real.

2867
02:11:55,941 --> 02:11:58,910
This is the really.
Is the president Donald Trump,

2868
02:11:59,210 --> 02:12:01,800
have you traveled abroad yet?
Wouldn't ms.

2869
02:12:01,820 --> 02:12:03,290
President?
Yeah.

2870
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:05,900
Italy.
Italy to with the fam.

2871
02:12:06,050 --> 02:12:07,250
Yeah.
How was it?

2872
02:12:07,390 --> 02:12:09,770
Just normal.
Nobody gives a shit is normal.

2873
02:12:09,860 --> 02:12:11,450
There's no.
They don't give a fuck.

2874
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:14,750
They're over there doing Italy shit.
But you were doing a.

2875
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:16,940
So use this vacation.
No shows.

2876
02:12:17,570 --> 02:12:18,620
No shows.
Yeah.

2877
02:12:18,950 --> 02:12:21,800
I'm sure if you go some.
I've been to Canada to do shows,

2878
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:24,590
but I'm sure if you go and do shit.
Have I wait a minute?

2879
02:12:24,980 --> 02:12:25,760
No,
I haven't.

2880
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:27,710
The first.
My shirt first shows with trump as

2881
02:12:27,711 --> 02:12:30,710
president will be next weekend.
Edmonton.

2882
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:32,680
Yeah.
No,

2883
02:12:32,690 --> 02:12:34,370
I haven't.
I haven't been anywhere while he's

2884
02:12:34,371 --> 02:12:37,520
actually been the president.
It's going to be a trip man.

2885
02:12:38,630 --> 02:12:40,190
Yeah,
they just kinda blamed it on.

2886
02:12:40,191 --> 02:12:45,191
you would have in the few conversations
I've had when I've been out of the

2887
02:12:46,851 --> 02:12:47,880
country.
That was.

2888
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:51,080
What are you guys doing over there?
Yeah.

2889
02:12:52,120 --> 02:12:55,580
Well they have a situation that's the
exact opposite.

2890
02:12:56,240 --> 02:13:01,240
They have a super liberal president that
was letting in any immigrants and now

2891
02:13:01,401 --> 02:13:04,430
he's apparently cooled off on that too
because doctor having it.

2892
02:13:04,431 --> 02:13:06,260
Yeah.
Trudeau also,

2893
02:13:06,530 --> 02:13:09,080
they're having issues with free speech,
you know,

2894
02:13:09,081 --> 02:13:12,020
people are getting fined for saying
things,

2895
02:13:12,090 --> 02:13:17,090
they're setting up these weird laws
where you can get in deep shit for ms

2896
02:13:17,451 --> 02:13:20,060
dot gendering.
People not using the correct gender

2897
02:13:20,061 --> 02:13:23,960
pronouns,
one of 78 different gender pronouns that

2898
02:13:23,961 --> 02:13:27,440
people use now.
LIke they're super ultra left wing,

2899
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:31,830
like his cabinet and his ideas.
He's a real like legitimate social

2900
02:13:31,831 --> 02:13:32,310
justice

2901
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:34,560
warrior president.
So it's interesting.

2902
02:13:35,020 --> 02:13:35,580
It's like,
yeah,

2903
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:37,500
both schools,
right?

2904
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:41,670
Right next to each other desk.
Both of them are kind of fucked.

2905
02:13:42,910 --> 02:13:44,290
yeah.
Yeah.

2906
02:13:44,770 --> 02:13:46,300
Wait,
we did it.

2907
02:13:46,860 --> 02:13:48,570
They did it to Russia.
Did it.

2908
02:13:48,630 --> 02:13:52,200
Nobody should fucking be president meant
nobody shouldn't be president.

2909
02:13:52,290 --> 02:13:54,010
Oh,
heartache.

2910
02:13:54,730 --> 02:13:57,150
We need more.
We need a group of humans as a group of

2911
02:13:57,190 --> 02:13:59,270
12.
Yeah.

2912
02:13:59,610 --> 02:14:00,790
Caligiuri.
Yeah.

2913
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:02,760
Yeah.
Something like that.

2914
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:04,760
Yeah.
And uh,

2915
02:14:04,761 --> 02:14:07,800
a group oF intelligent people that are
qualified,

2916
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:11,910
like with like a great education,
excellent ethics,

2917
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:14,490
great morals.
You can't have just a popularity contest

2918
02:14:14,491 --> 02:14:17,100
to see who gets to control the nukes.
It's fucking crazy.

2919
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:20,040
I hope we get at.
I hope we get past it,

2920
02:14:20,041 --> 02:14:22,710
but I don't think we're going to.
I think once we have things written on

2921
02:14:22,711 --> 02:14:26,970
paper,
once we have like a way that we operate,

2922
02:14:26,971 --> 02:14:29,820
once we have some sort of a plan that we
follow,

2923
02:14:30,030 --> 02:14:32,920
it's very difficult to get to people to
shake that too,

2924
02:14:32,990 --> 02:14:37,380
to have some sort of a new reasonable
plan to run the country without

2925
02:14:37,650 --> 02:14:40,270
representative government,
you know,

2926
02:14:40,271 --> 02:14:45,150
like senators and congressmen and people
that you have to like it mean they had

2927
02:14:45,151 --> 02:14:47,520
all that shit back when they couldn't
get ahold of people.

2928
02:14:47,680 --> 02:14:48,451
I mean,
theY had all the,

2929
02:14:48,451 --> 02:14:50,910
all that stuff was.
And I'm not saying that there shouldn't

2930
02:14:50,911 --> 02:14:53,040
be some representatives.
I'm saying that the system that's in

2931
02:14:53,041 --> 02:14:55,530
place right noW was really in place
right now because you had a

2932
02:14:55,531 --> 02:14:59,610
representative every state and they had
to travel to dc and they did their

2933
02:14:59,611 --> 02:15:00,810
business.
Then they come back to their

2934
02:15:00,811 --> 02:15:01,980
constituents.
Will,

2935
02:15:01,981 --> 02:15:04,110
the constituents can all communicate in
real time.

2936
02:15:04,111 --> 02:15:04,621
Now.
I mean,

2937
02:15:04,621 --> 02:15:05,750
we have this,
uh,

2938
02:15:05,751 --> 02:15:08,250
uh,
unique ability now to share your

2939
02:15:08,251 --> 02:15:11,940
opinions and even to vote online.
That also should be an option 100

2940
02:15:11,941 --> 02:15:13,260
percent.
We should be voting online.

2941
02:15:13,890 --> 02:15:15,360
Uh,
I don't know about that.

2942
02:15:15,390 --> 02:15:16,223
That could be,

2943
02:15:17,190 --> 02:15:19,950
that could be easily.
I mean if the picks on the cloud,

2944
02:15:19,951 --> 02:15:21,150
he's worried about people voting online.

2945
02:15:21,860 --> 02:15:25,790
Listen,
who knows?

2946
02:15:25,820 --> 02:15:28,910
That's just a dark dick.
The bad guy

2947
02:15:30,740 --> 02:15:35,740
be anybody's hasn't played a voice,
a voice that's saying anything that is

2948
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:39,310
fake neWs.
Fake news,

2949
02:15:39,340 --> 02:15:40,940
ruder photo shopped

2950
02:15:42,990 --> 02:15:44,370
better.
System is possible.

2951
02:15:44,490 --> 02:15:47,340
This is not the best system.
I feel like this is like trying to patch

2952
02:15:47,341 --> 02:15:51,610
up windows 95 over and over again.
Just come up with a new yes,

2953
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:53,740
a couple of years old.
Come up,

2954
02:15:53,790 --> 02:15:55,680
mix it up,
mix it up.

2955
02:15:55,740 --> 02:15:58,500
But you know,
that's gonna take a lot of time.

2956
02:15:58,620 --> 02:16:02,610
A lot of time to do what's in the notes,
man.

2957
02:16:03,630 --> 02:16:04,740
We gotta do it.
All right.

2958
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:09,840
Everything a pretty.
We got to it organically.

2959
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:11,100
Yeah,
I mean,

2960
02:16:11,101 --> 02:16:11,851
yeah,
I didn't try it.

2961
02:16:11,851 --> 02:16:12,840
I didn't.
I'm not a,

2962
02:16:12,841 --> 02:16:15,550
you know,
I'm not a hammer it in type.

2963
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:19,950
You know what I did the morning radio
type of unit.

2964
02:16:19,970 --> 02:16:21,120
That's the worst.
Oh,

2965
02:16:21,121 --> 02:16:23,860
so what do you want to talk about those
still do,

2966
02:16:23,870 --> 02:16:25,770
do morning radio shows?
Uh,

2967
02:16:25,890 --> 02:16:27,720
no I haven't done them in aWhile.
I,

2968
02:16:27,740 --> 02:16:28,870
I'll,
uh,

2969
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:30,040
no,
and

2970
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:34,870
I don't even those call in and I
understand that you were at a baseball

2971
02:16:34,871 --> 02:16:36,450
game or a baseball game.
Baseball.

2972
02:16:36,470 --> 02:16:39,880
Super boring.
No,

2973
02:16:40,450 --> 02:16:43,090
we got through everything except for
weirdly the one.

2974
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:45,010
Uh,
you know,

2975
02:16:45,190 --> 02:16:47,290
congratulations on a thousand episodes.
Thanks.

2976
02:16:47,291 --> 02:16:49,600
By the way,
I started a podcast last year.

2977
02:16:49,990 --> 02:16:50,530
Oh,
that's right.

2978
02:16:50,530 --> 02:16:51,850
Yeah.
Handsome rambler.

2979
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:53,360
Who?
It's really nice.

2980
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:55,780
It was a high name.
I'm locked into it now.

2981
02:16:56,130 --> 02:16:58,390
Consider changing it.
It's fun.

2982
02:16:58,391 --> 02:16:59,440
No,
it's been good.

2983
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:04,510
Do you have guests have guests on do it?
We do it all over.

2984
02:17:04,540 --> 02:17:07,570
We do it like we,
it's me and my dj tony trimm.

2985
02:17:08,110 --> 02:17:10,120
Uh,
so we do a lot of them in chicago,

2986
02:17:10,121 --> 02:17:12,950
but we travel and yeah,
it's uh,

2987
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:15,220
we,
we have comedians and we have a lot of

2988
02:17:15,221 --> 02:17:17,020
musicians on.
We one for you to do it.

2989
02:17:17,830 --> 02:17:20,050
I do.
We put them out every week,

2990
02:17:20,051 --> 02:17:24,130
but we block record them just because
I'm usually traveling a lot.

2991
02:17:24,190 --> 02:17:27,940
So we just,
we have a chairman and we got,

2992
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,210
we do make goofy songs.
We set,

2993
02:17:30,610 --> 02:17:32,890
that's a,
that's tony's crypt and chicago.

2994
02:17:33,240 --> 02:17:34,810
Oh,
that's nice setup there.

2995
02:17:34,870 --> 02:17:36,010
Yeah.
So we,

2996
02:17:36,011 --> 02:17:40,450
we played some songs and shit and goof
off and do some interview stuff.

2997
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:42,340
It's a fun time though.
It's been good.

2998
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:43,780
Nice.
It's kinda,

2999
02:17:43,870 --> 02:17:46,510
it's kinda changed,
you know,

3000
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:48,610
uh,
how I,

3001
02:17:48,850 --> 02:17:52,600
I feel like I'm a.
When I talked to people I feel like a

3002
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:54,970
better person,
not because I have a podcast,

3003
02:17:54,971 --> 02:17:58,060
but I feel like I'm more in tune with
what a person is saying.

3004
02:17:59,630 --> 02:18:00,720
Yeah.
We're like,

3005
02:18:00,780 --> 02:18:05,780
am I ended up accidentally interviewing
people when you talk to them in real

3006
02:18:06,941 --> 02:18:08,260
life,
but like asking good,

3007
02:18:08,261 --> 02:18:13,261
quite weird like nat and a practicing
way where I ended up talking to people

3008
02:18:13,361 --> 02:18:18,220
but asking better questions then the
where you from.

3009
02:18:18,221 --> 02:18:21,730
So the,
the getting beyond the surface level.

3010
02:18:21,731 --> 02:18:23,530
So I think that's happened because of
that.

3011
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:26,160
Well I,
I feel like the same thing with me.

3012
02:18:26,161 --> 02:18:29,970
I've learned how to be a better
conversation with you evolve for sure.

3013
02:18:30,210 --> 02:18:33,810
You also learn what's annoying about
your speech patterns.

3014
02:18:33,930 --> 02:18:37,050
Oh,
you say a lot of years.

3015
02:18:37,130 --> 02:18:38,370
Yeah,
that's what I say.

3016
02:18:38,371 --> 02:18:41,580
Like a lot.
Like it's like there's like,

3017
02:18:41,850 --> 02:18:43,080
you know,
you know,

3018
02:18:43,081 --> 02:18:45,030
and like those are big ones.
yeah.

3019
02:18:45,210 --> 02:18:46,170
You know,
like,

3020
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:49,320
and yeah,
because I just say three years,

3021
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:52,180
five seconds.
We,

3022
02:18:52,181 --> 02:18:55,470
you also learned how bad,
like a lot of regular people are at

3023
02:18:55,471 --> 02:18:59,100
having actual conversations.
A lot of people just waiting for you to

3024
02:18:59,101 --> 02:19:02,010
stop talking so they can talk like
they're barely paying attention to what

3025
02:19:02,011 --> 02:19:02,844
you're saying.
Yeah.

3026
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:05,480
Yeah.
Being a good conversationalist.

3027
02:19:05,710 --> 02:19:07,290
It's huge.
Is

3028
02:19:07,660 --> 02:19:09,220
A lot of tools.

3029
02:19:09,470 --> 02:19:10,430
Yeah.
Did you,

3030
02:19:10,460 --> 02:19:14,240
did you read books and shit when you
first started or did you just go into it

3031
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:18,800
or did you,
did you study certain people when you,

3032
02:19:19,340 --> 02:19:21,590
as you went along or when you first
started?

3033
02:19:21,700 --> 02:19:22,580
No,
no,

3034
02:19:22,670 --> 02:19:23,960
no.
Total trial and error.

3035
02:19:24,590 --> 02:19:25,930
Just doing it a lot.
you know,

3036
02:19:25,931 --> 02:19:28,220
in a thousand episodes we've done a
thousand episodes

3037
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:32,720
plus another 40 that were like fight
companions,

3038
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:35,450
podcasts on a plane,
podcasts on a hike.

3039
02:19:35,480 --> 02:19:37,640
There's a bunch of dIfferent ones.
Fight breakdowns.

3040
02:19:38,100 --> 02:19:39,990
How often do you listen to it?
What do you watch?

3041
02:19:40,090 --> 02:19:42,910
I listened to occasionally I listened to
one if I think it sucks.

3042
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:45,360
If I think I was bad or if I think,
uh,

3043
02:19:45,550 --> 02:19:47,980
the person said something super
interesting,

3044
02:19:47,981 --> 02:19:49,780
like there was one the other day with
Sean Carroll.

3045
02:19:50,050 --> 02:19:53,440
He's an astrophysicist and a,
he's a,

3046
02:19:53,530 --> 02:19:58,150
an expert and quantum theory and it's
just shit.

3047
02:19:58,151 --> 02:20:01,270
He was saying it's so hard to grab a
hold of.

3048
02:20:01,271 --> 02:20:03,140
I had to listen to it several times
then.

3049
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:06,220
Yeah.
But it's mostly just me asking questions

3050
02:20:06,221 --> 02:20:09,010
and hear him talk and.
But it's just the stuff that he's saying

3051
02:20:09,011 --> 02:20:11,830
is so intense,
you got to kind of listen to it over and

3052
02:20:11,831 --> 02:20:15,850
over again with my feeble little brain
just to try to store it,

3053
02:20:16,630 --> 02:20:17,110
you know,
like,

3054
02:20:17,110 --> 02:20:18,040
okay,
what is he saying?

3055
02:20:18,190 --> 02:20:21,010
And there's another one,
this woman that she's on all the time,

3056
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:22,120
rhonda,
patrick,

3057
02:20:22,121 --> 02:20:24,460
dr rhonda,
patrick specialty,

3058
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:27,520
um,
nutritional absorption and just,

3059
02:20:27,530 --> 02:20:30,610
uh,
how nutrients affect the body.

3060
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:33,640
That's the big thing with her.
And she's,

3061
02:20:33,970 --> 02:20:35,630
she's one of the smartest people I've
ever talked to him.

3062
02:20:35,670 --> 02:20:36,690
He's freaky smart,
like,

3063
02:20:36,750 --> 02:20:39,970
like almost like an alien,
like you talking to and you realize how

3064
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:44,020
dumb you are because you can ask her a
question about something and not only

3065
02:20:44,021 --> 02:20:48,040
can she tell you what it is,
she'll recite the studies that were done

3066
02:20:48,310 --> 02:20:51,490
and what percentages?
The studies and it's just pulling this

3067
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:54,430
right out of it in between our ears.
She's not.

3068
02:20:54,480 --> 02:20:55,360
Nope.
Nope,

3069
02:20:55,570 --> 02:20:58,750
pewter into.
She has notes but she rarelY uses them

3070
02:20:58,751 --> 02:21:00,310
when she comes on the podcast.
She'll like,

3071
02:21:00,311 --> 02:21:02,590
have something that she wants to talk
about some new study on,

3072
02:21:02,591 --> 02:21:03,360
like,
you know,

3073
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:06,650
like broccoli sprouts was one that she
went over the last time because she's

3074
02:21:06,670 --> 02:21:10,060
been experimenting with broccoli sprouts
and she's a clinical researcher as well,

3075
02:21:10,061 --> 02:21:14,320
so she does actual scientific research.
So she's one of them that I listened to

3076
02:21:14,321 --> 02:21:17,080
like several times to try to remember
what the fuck she was saying.

3077
02:21:17,190 --> 02:21:20,470
So does she hit you up the same way?
I actually,

3078
02:21:20,580 --> 02:21:24,810
joe got this broccoli sprouts shit I
need to get off sometimes.

3079
02:21:26,190 --> 02:21:27,110
Yeah.
Sometimes

3080
02:21:27,190 --> 02:21:30,580
say I'll hit her up too because she's a
researcher too,

3081
02:21:30,581 --> 02:21:33,610
because she's always like a,
for lack of a better word,

3082
02:21:33,611 --> 02:21:36,270
balls deep in research and she,
she's like,

3083
02:21:36,340 --> 02:21:38,330
sometimes she doesn't have time to do
podcasts.

3084
02:21:38,340 --> 02:21:41,320
He's in the middle of so many different
things that she's working on.

3085
02:21:41,620 --> 02:21:42,730
Actual science,
you know,

3086
02:21:43,390 --> 02:21:47,290
that's the interesting thing about
having real scientists on as you realize

3087
02:21:47,291 --> 02:21:48,940
like what a different world they live
in.

3088
02:21:49,990 --> 02:21:52,590
Absolutely.
I would never have a scientist.

3089
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:58,360
You might enjoy it maybe down the line,
but right now I keep it to five pula.

3090
02:21:59,050 --> 02:22:02,110
Yeah.
Keep It fun and people I know and I

3091
02:22:02,111 --> 02:22:06,160
think it may be down in line as I grow
at it.

3092
02:22:06,250 --> 02:22:11,050
Then I be able to carry that kind of
conversation with confidence or at least

3093
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:14,030
lead them into what they want to say
and,

3094
02:22:14,031 --> 02:22:15,850
and,
and asking engaging questions during it.

3095
02:22:15,851 --> 02:22:17,380
But for right now,
keeping it,

3096
02:22:17,381 --> 02:22:18,790
rappers,
comedians,

3097
02:22:18,791 --> 02:22:19,340
musicians,

3098
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:22,400
is fun.
Some of my favorite podcasts that I do,

3099
02:22:22,401 --> 02:22:25,550
or like comedians,
like yourself or my friends or um,

3100
02:22:25,950 --> 02:22:28,890
one thing I cAn tell you though,
looking at that image of you guys,

3101
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:32,040
this is what a mistake that we did when
we first started out.

3102
02:22:32,041 --> 02:22:35,520
We did it on couches.
Problem with couches is you got to like

3103
02:22:35,521 --> 02:22:38,520
sit forward where the microphone is not
that comfortable.

3104
02:22:38,770 --> 02:22:41,040
Like I realized after awhile,
I see how you guys are like,

3105
02:22:41,041 --> 02:22:42,790
everybody's leaning forward looking at
that.

3106
02:22:42,930 --> 02:22:47,670
See like on this show,
you're sitting in these ergonomic office

3107
02:22:47,671 --> 02:22:49,580
chairs.
You're sitting in the back and,

3108
02:22:49,620 --> 02:22:52,710
but you're sitting up and you could sit
here for hours and hours at a time.

3109
02:22:52,950 --> 02:22:55,950
If you do three hours,
sit the way byron powers is right there.

3110
02:22:56,580 --> 02:22:57,900
That shit's gonna hurt your back.

3111
02:22:58,060 --> 02:22:58,711
Oh,
well we,

3112
02:22:58,711 --> 02:23:01,990
we,
we keep about an hour and a half or so

3113
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:03,490
hour and a half's good.
Yeah,

3114
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:08,720
that's right when it starts swing.
But like office chairs are the way to

3115
02:23:10,141 --> 02:23:12,030
go.
There's a reason why they make these

3116
02:23:12,031 --> 02:23:14,070
things like,
especially these ergonomic ones,

3117
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:17,180
these are from a ergo depot.
They're called capisce [inaudible].

3118
02:23:17,220 --> 02:23:19,330
For people that ask and they're,
um,

3119
02:23:19,460 --> 02:23:21,030
they're not a sponsor or anything,
they just,

3120
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:25,710
they're bad ass chairs and they force
you to sit up straight so you can sit in

3121
02:23:25,711 --> 02:23:27,660
these for hours and it doesn't fuck with
your back.

3122
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:29,350
Solid tip,
joe rogan.

3123
02:23:29,370 --> 02:23:30,750
Solid tip.
I appreciate it.

3124
02:23:30,751 --> 02:23:34,410
I made those mistakes.
I had a couch and ari shaffir took that

3125
02:23:34,411 --> 02:23:35,310
couch.
He sold it.

3126
02:23:35,490 --> 02:23:37,020
I gave it to him and he did something
with it.

3127
02:23:37,021 --> 02:23:39,870
I think he evaded or something that
everybody knows the couch.

3128
02:23:39,990 --> 02:23:40,920
look at this.
Go on here.

3129
02:23:41,690 --> 02:23:42,523
Oh,
it's happening here.

3130
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:44,440
That's uh,
we went,

3131
02:23:44,460 --> 02:23:45,690
uh,
mogue fest.

3132
02:23:46,020 --> 02:23:49,350
What does that mogue fest.
Moga is the company they make

3133
02:23:49,351 --> 02:23:53,340
synthesizes.
So a lot of bands you'll see they use

3134
02:23:53,370 --> 02:23:54,990
milk products.
And so,

3135
02:23:55,890 --> 02:23:58,290
um,
that there are many that we use on a

3136
02:23:58,291 --> 02:23:59,310
podcast,
you know,

3137
02:23:59,311 --> 02:24:03,210
that there are many is the instrument
that you can operate with waves,

3138
02:24:03,300 --> 02:24:05,940
like just you move your hands around it.
They make that.

3139
02:24:06,660 --> 02:24:08,620
And so tony,
my,

3140
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:09,600
he said,
oh,

3141
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:12,690
we should go to mogue fest.
And so I could be.

3142
02:24:12,750 --> 02:24:14,940
That's a good idea.
That had festivals in durham.

3143
02:24:15,540 --> 02:24:18,690
So I reached out to them and they,
uh,

3144
02:24:18,750 --> 02:24:22,770
they said she'll come to the fast and we
did a couple of podcasts there and then

3145
02:24:22,771 --> 02:24:24,630
also they have a,
a,

3146
02:24:24,631 --> 02:24:26,610
a,
a,

3147
02:24:26,611 --> 02:24:30,270
a workshop where you can build your own
drum synthesizer.

3148
02:24:30,390 --> 02:24:33,570
So it's a two day workshop where you
built it,

3149
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:36,780
they give you all the parts and you
build it from scratch and you do all the

3150
02:24:36,781 --> 02:24:40,730
solder it and school.
So I built this a drum at the size of

3151
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:41,570
it.
It may.

3152
02:24:41,570 --> 02:24:43,640
Is that what you're doing there?
Is that what's in your hand?

3153
02:24:43,730 --> 02:24:47,750
That's a,
at that point you have soldering right

3154
02:24:47,751 --> 02:24:48,584
there.
Yeah.

3155
02:24:49,690 --> 02:24:51,950
So that's like a.
What is that?

3156
02:24:51,951 --> 02:24:53,120
What are those boards called?

3157
02:24:53,630 --> 02:24:54,680
Circuit boards.
Circuit board.

3158
02:24:54,700 --> 02:24:55,980
Yeah.
So yeah,

3159
02:24:56,360 --> 02:24:58,470
we both worked on,
I didn't do all the work,

3160
02:24:58,820 --> 02:25:00,740
but uh,
I did a lot of.

3161
02:25:00,980 --> 02:25:03,370
That was my first time soldering
anything was doing.

3162
02:25:03,410 --> 02:25:08,410
I hadn't done actual building shit with
my hands in a long time,

3163
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:10,520
but yeah.
Then we,

3164
02:25:10,521 --> 02:25:12,590
uh,
then when we built them all,

3165
02:25:13,070 --> 02:25:15,860
everybody built their as an in,
at the end of the class,

3166
02:25:16,550 --> 02:25:21,020
linked them all together and they just,
it just kinda fucked around with them

3167
02:25:21,021 --> 02:25:23,680
and just make crazy noise.
Wow.

3168
02:25:23,730 --> 02:25:25,390
Yeah,
that's interesting.

3169
02:25:25,690 --> 02:25:26,523
It was fun,
man.

3170
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:29,410
That seems pretty bad ass.
Yeah.

3171
02:25:29,830 --> 02:25:31,900
Making your own sense.
So that's a cool.

3172
02:25:31,901 --> 02:25:33,670
What does,
just off a whim,

3173
02:25:33,700 --> 02:25:35,130
you just decided to go and do that?
Well,

3174
02:25:35,131 --> 02:25:36,550
we were,
cause yeah,

3175
02:25:36,551 --> 02:25:39,430
we just a,
I looked it up and it was a bunch of

3176
02:25:39,431 --> 02:25:42,100
artists that I liked there too.
And so it just,

3177
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:45,540
and we reached out to that was kind of a
chill festival is it,

3178
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:49,390
have some bigger artists,
but it's still pretty small in the way

3179
02:25:49,391 --> 02:25:52,810
that we were able to hit them up a few
weeks before and they were able to

3180
02:25:52,811 --> 02:25:54,850
accommodate us with time slots and say
okay,

3181
02:25:55,570 --> 02:25:58,430
they will already have somebody
interview flying lotus.

3182
02:25:58,430 --> 02:26:03,430
So they had us intervieW him and uh,
we interview animal collective and they

3183
02:26:03,971 --> 02:26:06,440
were pretty low.
It was just loosen and,

3184
02:26:06,530 --> 02:26:09,250
and chill and it was easy to navigate.
It was a,

3185
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:10,840
it was a fun festival.
Yeah,

3186
02:26:11,260 --> 02:26:14,230
it was just on a whim.
So do you use that thing now?

3187
02:26:14,260 --> 02:26:16,660
That's kind to be like kind of
satisfying knowing that you made

3188
02:26:16,661 --> 02:26:18,970
something and I haven't used it yet
because it's set my,

3189
02:26:19,010 --> 02:26:22,040
I had to get it from,
from New York and uh,

3190
02:26:22,150 --> 02:26:23,830
bring it to chicago and started using
it.

3191
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:26,230
I use the theremin mordo that there,
ms.fun.

3192
02:26:26,500 --> 02:26:30,820
So like what do you make music?
We make songs on the podcast.

3193
02:26:30,850 --> 02:26:33,280
We do a,
instead of doing an ad read,

3194
02:26:33,281 --> 02:26:38,281
we do a,
we do a jingle for you to do an original

3195
02:26:38,591 --> 02:26:41,760
song for each ad.
So you write the songs that you like,

3196
02:26:41,770 --> 02:26:43,640
what their talking points.
Uh,

3197
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:45,220
we do well,
we do the,

3198
02:26:45,250 --> 02:26:49,560
we do the song and it's kind of hooky.
Usually just based is saying the same

3199
02:26:49,570 --> 02:26:51,780
like we got bev was one our sponsor,
so we go blah,

3200
02:26:51,800 --> 02:26:54,190
blah blah blah blah blah.
And he'll produce around it.

3201
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:58,390
and then we'll do to read after the,
uh,

3202
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:03,560
the saw this is that there are many that
he's talking about to wave your hands

3203
02:27:03,611 --> 02:27:06,700
over it and it makes music,
millimeter stereo headphone out.

3204
02:27:12,340 --> 02:27:15,850
The other antenna will control that hand
technique.

3205
02:27:16,090 --> 02:27:19,310
I usually do a full openhand that's mars
shit.

3206
02:27:19,420 --> 02:27:20,620
It's real weird.
That's a weird,

3207
02:27:20,621 --> 02:27:22,670
weird thing.
But it's fun man in it.

3208
02:27:22,690 --> 02:27:27,690
so we've made some beats with that.
That's fascinating.

3209
02:27:27,811 --> 02:27:29,780
I've never heard of this thing before.
Yeah,

3210
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:32,430
we really used that.
I mean we have an tonio,

3211
02:27:32,710 --> 02:27:36,870
he'll have a drum machine.
We got a microphone that does like auto

3212
02:27:36,871 --> 02:27:38,840
tune and stuff.
Wow.

3213
02:27:38,850 --> 02:27:43,800
So it's really to cover up that we're a
bad interviews,

3214
02:27:45,850 --> 02:27:47,520
you'll be alone and we can't take us
out.

3215
02:27:47,521 --> 02:27:51,550
He was like,
it just started goofing off and make it

3216
02:27:51,551 --> 02:27:53,050
a.
So do you think like you'd probably not

3217
02:27:53,051 --> 02:27:54,850
an interview.
Are you just having a conversation?

3218
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:55,560
Right?
Yeah.

3219
02:27:55,560 --> 02:27:57,470
Well how many podcasts are really,
right?

3220
02:27:57,590 --> 02:27:58,580
Absolutely.
But I,

3221
02:27:58,581 --> 02:27:59,630
I just,
uh,

3222
02:28:00,940 --> 02:28:02,440
I could talk,
you know what I mean?

3223
02:28:02,441 --> 02:28:04,640
But I also want to be,
when I,

3224
02:28:04,650 --> 02:28:08,800
when I have a guest,
I want to like put them in a position to

3225
02:28:08,860 --> 02:28:09,940
shot,
you know what I mean?

3226
02:28:10,190 --> 02:28:14,320
And so sometimes I'll catch myself kind
of going off and I'm like,

3227
02:28:14,340 --> 02:28:16,930
oh shit,
let me get it back to them.

3228
02:28:16,931 --> 02:28:17,764
You know what I mean?

3229
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:21,430
We use that thing.
what?

3230
02:28:21,431 --> 02:28:23,620
No,
I'll catch myself going off onto a,

3231
02:28:23,660 --> 02:28:25,730
uh,
into a long ass story to now realize

3232
02:28:25,731 --> 02:28:28,430
that.
Let me just bring it back and get it to

3233
02:28:28,431 --> 02:28:29,264
a.

3234
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:30,290
So this guest.
Yeah,

3235
02:28:30,291 --> 02:28:31,460
that's what I mean.
Yeah.

3236
02:28:32,120 --> 02:28:33,320
That's fun.
It's fun.

3237
02:28:33,321 --> 02:28:34,370
No,
it's a fun time.

3238
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:35,630
as long as it's fun,
man.

3239
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:37,790
That's everything.
do you find that like a lot of people

3240
02:28:37,791 --> 02:28:39,260
that are coming to your shows,
they,

3241
02:28:39,261 --> 02:28:41,180
uh,
they listen to the podcast and it's sort

3242
02:28:41,181 --> 02:28:42,560
of like gets you closer to them?

3243
02:28:42,760 --> 02:28:45,640
Yeah,
it is where we get a lot of messages

3244
02:28:45,850 --> 02:28:50,530
about it and people say they've bought
their minis because you're like,

3245
02:28:50,531 --> 02:28:52,210
I didn't,
I didn't even know what a theremin he

3246
02:28:52,480 --> 02:28:54,460
was,
but now I want one because they play it

3247
02:28:54,461 --> 02:28:57,760
so god goddamn much.
And it's kind of a running theme on the

3248
02:28:57,761 --> 02:29:02,761
show were the guest of a what is that
thing and be like,

3249
02:29:04,150 --> 02:29:05,290
hey,
that's a therapist.

3250
02:29:05,291 --> 02:29:10,240
So It's just kind of a,
it's almost like a third host of the

3251
02:29:10,241 --> 02:29:12,970
show when the person finds out what it
is.

3252
02:29:12,971 --> 02:29:14,560
And I explained it pretty much

3253
02:29:14,890 --> 02:29:17,230
every time.
It's a fun time.

3254
02:29:18,220 --> 02:29:20,080
And uh,
so tell people that it's handsome,

3255
02:29:20,081 --> 02:29:22,580
rambler,
itunes,

3256
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:24,190
soundcloud,
the other ones.

3257
02:29:24,260 --> 02:29:26,020
what is it?
What else you got?

3258
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:29,850
What is it like google play,
google play,

3259
02:29:30,310 --> 02:29:32,560
play.
It's amazing how few people bring up

3260
02:29:32,561 --> 02:29:37,210
google play because like half the people
have android dome thing isn't like

3261
02:29:38,050 --> 02:29:41,620
google play never gets discussed.
And you can get google play on an iphone

3262
02:29:41,621 --> 02:29:42,280
too,
right?

3263
02:29:42,280 --> 02:29:46,330
but you can't get itunes.
can you get itunes on an android phone?

3264
02:29:46,390 --> 02:29:50,510
You can't get the podcasts on google
play on the iphone because there's a

3265
02:29:50,680 --> 02:29:55,580
podcast app which google apps on the
phone or whatever.

3266
02:29:56,110 --> 02:29:59,470
They don't let you.
But they let you use some podcast apps,

3267
02:29:59,471 --> 02:30:00,690
right?
I don't know,

3268
02:30:00,980 --> 02:30:03,300
just that comedy podcasts app,
that arch fear is always,

3269
02:30:03,400 --> 02:30:06,250
is different though.
That's a comedy app that's aggregating.

3270
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:09,430
Let's see how many things.
They wouldn't let you choose an actual

3271
02:30:09,431 --> 02:30:12,010
podcast app other than there?
I don't think so.

3272
02:30:12,011 --> 02:30:13,750
I could be speaking,
but I don't think so.

3273
02:30:14,020 --> 02:30:14,710
Yeah,
man,

3274
02:30:14,710 --> 02:30:16,510
it's a tough road for those android
people.

3275
02:30:17,100 --> 02:30:20,460
It's tough road.
People just look at you illegitimately

3276
02:30:20,470 --> 02:30:22,660
if you green text message,
but yeah,

3277
02:30:22,661 --> 02:30:23,980
they get weirded out by here.

3278
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:29,670
You bought one,
you get crazy red.

3279
02:30:29,850 --> 02:30:32,980
The cameras really made one day to sit
down and I was like,

3280
02:30:33,010 --> 02:30:34,150
ooh.
It looks tremendous.

3281
02:30:34,151 --> 02:30:35,940
They made an android phone.
It hasn't.

3282
02:30:36,010 --> 02:30:38,440
They just showed up.
Put up a picture where you can only see

3283
02:30:38,441 --> 02:30:40,420
like the corner and the rest of it's all
shaded out.

3284
02:30:40,421 --> 02:30:41,570
I'll see if I can find it real quick.
No,

3285
02:30:41,590 --> 02:30:43,970
that dude,
marcus got ahold of one and then I saw

3286
02:30:43,971 --> 02:30:46,240
the video but I already bought it
before.

3287
02:30:46,260 --> 02:30:48,970
Now I just kind of went ahead and
because they had some wording on the

3288
02:30:48,971 --> 02:30:52,270
bottom that like there's gonna be some
special things that you won't be able to

3289
02:30:52,271 --> 02:30:54,940
buy if you don't Buy in this window.
It was a whole sales pitch,

3290
02:30:54,941 --> 02:30:56,770
but like I just went ahead and bought a
house.

3291
02:30:56,910 --> 02:30:58,330
So you're going to switch over to
android.

3292
02:30:58,510 --> 02:31:00,250
That switch.
It'll just be like a second.

3293
02:31:00,250 --> 02:31:00,790
Whoa.
Phone.

3294
02:31:00,790 --> 02:31:02,050
You're gonna have a whole phone.
It doesn't work.

3295
02:31:02,051 --> 02:31:06,910
I'll sell it and just what it's supposed
to also be a modular something or other.

3296
02:31:06,911 --> 02:31:09,010
For the new cameras they're going to
have coming out too,

3297
02:31:09,011 --> 02:31:12,400
so it'll actually be a physical tool.
It's more or less Just a five inch

3298
02:31:12,401 --> 02:31:13,660
screen.
That's a tool for these.

3299
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:17,290
These cameras that don't have any
screens on those red cameras for people

3300
02:31:17,291 --> 02:31:19,060
don't know.
There's a lot of television shows a good

3301
02:31:19,350 --> 02:31:21,990
with those like super high end high
definition.

3302
02:31:22,320 --> 02:31:26,520
Top of the food chain caMeras.
that new phone does look dope and it's

3303
02:31:26,530 --> 02:31:28,980
got like these crazy grips on the side
of it.

3304
02:31:29,510 --> 02:31:32,670
Like the side of it is not smooth.
It's got like finger holes,

3305
02:31:33,030 --> 02:31:35,040
like where your.
Your hanD grips onto it.

3306
02:31:35,090 --> 02:31:38,940
What they had to been doing great as a
camera company where they said let's do

3307
02:31:38,941 --> 02:31:43,580
phones also holographic.
Yeah.

3308
02:31:43,590 --> 02:31:46,470
Well marcus is the video.
What is marcus's last name?

3309
02:31:46,520 --> 02:31:48,840
Brownlee.
There was a video where marcus is

3310
02:31:48,841 --> 02:31:50,250
watching it and he's like,
whoa,

3311
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:52,400
you can't show you that.
It looks like he said he can't show you.

3312
02:31:52,401 --> 02:31:54,120
Goes,
you can tell shit.

3313
02:31:54,150 --> 02:31:56,610
You could see my reaction to it and by
the way,

3314
02:31:56,611 --> 02:31:58,620
he's like,
the reaction is not even to the finished

3315
02:31:58,621 --> 02:32:00,240
product,
which would be even better than it is

3316
02:32:00,241 --> 02:32:02,250
now,
but you see how the aside edges have

3317
02:32:02,251 --> 02:32:05,550
those weird grips to it.
It's really kind of interesting.

3318
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:10,380
Yeah,
he's a mess and with it.

3319
02:32:10,381 --> 02:32:13,410
But you could see like when he's holding
it in his hand,

3320
02:32:13,470 --> 02:32:18,070
like what it looks like.
Is that it just talking about it?

3321
02:32:18,100 --> 02:32:20,130
I think that's a different video than
the one I saw.

3322
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:22,500
Maybe it's not.
He was on a couch.

3323
02:32:23,310 --> 02:32:24,143
Yeah,
there it is.

3324
02:32:24,870 --> 02:32:28,170
And you see the thing,
it doesn't look like any other phone

3325
02:32:28,171 --> 02:32:30,000
you've ever seen before.
Like yeAh,

3326
02:32:30,001 --> 02:32:31,860
there you go.
Like see the sides of it.

3327
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:35,460
It's all like,
it's got like ripples.

3328
02:32:35,970 --> 02:32:38,700
Like finger slots.
Yeah,

3329
02:32:38,850 --> 02:32:40,350
real big too.
Huge.

3330
02:32:40,370 --> 02:32:44,070
Bigger than life.
But he's got big hands so you can't tell

3331
02:32:44,071 --> 02:32:45,570
as much.
I got tiny hands.

3332
02:32:45,571 --> 02:32:46,970
I'd be trapped in this shit.
To you.

3333
02:32:47,460 --> 02:32:49,020
which one do you have?
A regular iphone?

3334
02:32:49,050 --> 02:32:51,300
Yeah.
I didn't get the one because my hands

3335
02:32:51,301 --> 02:32:54,870
can't enter this shit.
You got to end it,

3336
02:32:55,530 --> 02:32:56,363
but there's so much.

3337
02:32:56,370 --> 02:32:58,080
It's so worth it.
If you go online,

3338
02:32:58,230 --> 02:33:00,540
like if you go online,
you want to read something online,

3339
02:33:00,541 --> 02:33:02,310
it's just so much better with the big
screen.

3340
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:06,720
It's just the experience and looking at
pictures and videos of fireworks and

3341
02:33:06,721 --> 02:33:09,480
shit.
Holographic displays.

3342
02:33:09,481 --> 02:33:11,280
Interesting.
I'm a little worried too that they

3343
02:33:11,281 --> 02:33:12,810
announced something they won't be able
to deliver on,

3344
02:33:12,811 --> 02:33:14,490
which happens from time to time.
Oh,

3345
02:33:14,540 --> 02:33:15,810
jamie'S mr.
Pegaworld,

3346
02:33:16,860 --> 02:33:19,760
size difference.
The uh,

3347
02:33:19,761 --> 02:33:23,780
the red marketing person went from
really excited to go

3348
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:29,400
a full on hype piece until,
I don't know if they're going to be able

3349
02:33:29,401 --> 02:33:31,440
to do it.
you're going to get a bunch of ads on

3350
02:33:31,441 --> 02:33:34,170
twitter was like zero posts.
Like fuck you,

3351
02:33:34,180 --> 02:33:36,380
you piece of shit.
Yeah.

3352
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:39,960
There's um,
at galaxy note eight looks insane too.

3353
02:33:39,990 --> 02:33:42,780
That's coming out real soon.
That's like almost out.

3354
02:33:42,820 --> 02:33:44,960
They don't still make the airplane
announcements.

3355
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:46,920
No,
that was a seven.

3356
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:48,530
Yeah.
They don't make it anymore.

3357
02:33:48,570 --> 02:33:50,130
Pretty much everybody's got rid of that
thing.

3358
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:51,990
If you're a hold out,
you're like,

3359
02:33:52,010 --> 02:33:54,240
oh fuck,
I charge it.

3360
02:33:54,241 --> 02:33:56,720
But I charged it up,
take a pot from my,

3361
02:33:56,730 --> 02:33:58,350
uh,
from my stove.

3362
02:33:58,620 --> 02:34:01,710
I charged in that fucking thing.
Just gauging catches fire,

3363
02:34:04,050 --> 02:34:06,420
put it in the fireplace.
You see that little video showing how

3364
02:34:06,450 --> 02:34:08,430
people to,
if they're in the floods,

3365
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:13,140
how to charge their phones off of a nine
volt battery and a,

3366
02:34:13,290 --> 02:34:15,010
and a in a key.
Yeah,

3367
02:34:15,510 --> 02:34:20,510
it lookS sketchy.
But in a nine volt battery,

3368
02:34:21,870 --> 02:34:24,700
uh,
put the in a car charger.

3369
02:34:25,810 --> 02:34:26,950
I'm on the internet too much.

3370
02:34:31,260 --> 02:34:33,400
It's unplugged.
Does happen.

3371
02:34:33,650 --> 02:34:35,490
Oh,
it was a different lady I saw.

3372
02:34:37,080 --> 02:34:40,300
Okay.
So she's got a car charger and she takes

3373
02:34:40,301 --> 02:34:43,390
the car charger and sticks on the end of
a nine volt battery,

3374
02:34:43,630 --> 02:34:47,050
like One,
one of the slots and then puts a key in

3375
02:34:47,051 --> 02:34:48,740
the other slot and I think you've got to
touch it.

3376
02:34:49,030 --> 02:34:51,760
You get the circuit.
What if this lady just burst into flames

3377
02:34:51,761 --> 02:34:54,640
and lost her islands so you can get
electrocuted by doing this.

3378
02:34:55,300 --> 02:34:56,230
So yeah,
be careful.

3379
02:34:56,231 --> 02:34:57,940
But It's a nine volt battery.
You can.

3380
02:34:57,941 --> 02:35:00,430
And obviously won't be a big charge,
I don't think,

3381
02:35:00,431 --> 02:35:03,160
but it will charge the phone.
so she touches the two of them together.

3382
02:35:03,161 --> 02:35:04,510
Wow.
That works.

3383
02:35:04,511 --> 02:35:07,630
That's crazy.
That's nuts.

3384
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:10,510
So if you're in a pinch and all you got
to nine volt battery and you need to

3385
02:35:10,511 --> 02:35:14,320
call nine slash 11,
they make a battery adapter for an

3386
02:35:14,321 --> 02:35:16,300
iphone.
Why don't they make a little thing where

3387
02:35:16,301 --> 02:35:18,160
you can plug a nine volt battery into
it.

3388
02:35:18,220 --> 02:35:20,110
Just go to a store,
buy a battery,

3389
02:35:20,170 --> 02:35:22,180
plugged that fucker in and charge your
phone.

3390
02:35:22,900 --> 02:35:26,930
Does anybody have that?
How do they not have that?

3391
02:35:27,170 --> 02:35:28,940
Because they have those banks,
you know,

3392
02:35:28,941 --> 02:35:31,700
there's a power bank so that you can
plug your shit into.

3393
02:35:33,250 --> 02:35:35,540
It seems like somebody would have this.

3394
02:35:36,390 --> 02:35:38,130
Have you seen that new,
um,

3395
02:35:38,820 --> 02:35:43,080
a luggage that you could ride?
Have you seen that shit?

3396
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:44,540
Turns it into a scooter.
Yes.

3397
02:35:44,541 --> 02:35:45,350
Yeah.
Hey,

3398
02:35:45,350 --> 02:35:47,100
that's fucking amazing.
What does that,

3399
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:50,010
I don't know.
I re tweeted it the other day though,

3400
02:35:50,011 --> 02:35:52,290
was on mashable and I was like,
get the fuck out of here.

3401
02:35:52,470 --> 02:35:55,560
The thing goes eight miles an hour.
You sit on a fucker and you ride around

3402
02:35:55,561 --> 02:35:58,680
the airport with it as a.
It's legit.

3403
02:35:59,640 --> 02:36:01,360
I said related.
That's one way to stunt.

3404
02:36:02,030 --> 02:36:06,520
That's one way to handle a layover.
just drive around the airport until

3405
02:36:06,540 --> 02:36:08,490
your,
your luggage runs out of batteries,

3406
02:36:08,940 --> 02:36:12,150
but you can also use the battery
charging of that,

3407
02:36:12,210 --> 02:36:14,190
the battery and use It to charge your
phone.

3408
02:36:14,191 --> 02:36:16,860
Like you can plug your phone into that.
That alone is worth it.

3409
02:36:17,130 --> 02:36:19,200
Like always having battery power,
right?

3410
02:36:19,201 --> 02:36:22,500
They're connected to your luggage.
That's a lot of the.

3411
02:36:22,510 --> 02:36:23,400
A lot of these,
uh,

3412
02:36:23,430 --> 02:36:25,410
luggages are doing that now.
Look at that.

3413
02:36:26,040 --> 02:36:28,180
Get the fuck out of here.
And that's a carry on.

3414
02:36:28,260 --> 02:36:30,930
Yes.
People having a good old time.

3415
02:36:30,990 --> 02:36:31,860
I have to go.

3416
02:36:34,430 --> 02:36:37,540
I got to get online and media bias.
Come on.

3417
02:36:37,930 --> 02:36:38,140
What

3418
02:36:38,140 --> 02:36:40,630
is it called?
a mob moto bag.

3419
02:36:40,780 --> 02:36:41,830
Come on.
Look.

3420
02:36:42,010 --> 02:36:43,930
See?
She's fitting her stuff in there and

3421
02:36:43,931 --> 02:36:46,210
then she drives off.
We will look at this.

3422
02:36:46,211 --> 02:36:49,000
She could plug into it.
That's what I like to see.

3423
02:36:49,001 --> 02:36:50,700
You write that in an airport though.
I'll do it.

3424
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:54,940
I don't think I do it.
You don't know if I do it.

3425
02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:56,650
What you can do it.
Does that.

3426
02:36:57,100 --> 02:36:59,500
What was that?
She had a gyroscope.

3427
02:36:59,501 --> 02:37:02,290
Is that real?
I'm getting that backup a little bit

3428
02:37:02,350 --> 02:37:05,890
right there.
and then there's just a segue just to

3429
02:37:05,891 --> 02:37:06,724
show you.
Oh,

3430
02:37:07,480 --> 02:37:09,710
is there a standard option?
Uh,

3431
02:37:10,990 --> 02:37:12,520
can uh,
can you stand up?

3432
02:37:12,710 --> 02:37:14,320
Can they handle bars?
Go up?

3433
02:37:14,410 --> 02:37:15,243
And then

3434
02:37:16,550 --> 02:37:19,060
this is why that doesn't work because I
can fail.

3435
02:37:19,140 --> 02:37:20,610
Fail.
Yeah.

3436
02:37:20,790 --> 02:37:24,060
But this is a guy that's just rolling
around on it like an asshole.

3437
02:37:24,960 --> 02:37:26,780
Oh,
this is that dude that's on youtube.

3438
02:37:26,910 --> 02:37:28,390
Who's that guy?
Casey something?

3439
02:37:28,680 --> 02:37:29,640
Yeah,
he's got.

3440
02:37:29,670 --> 02:37:31,620
He's famous on youtube.
Is that his apartment?

3441
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:32,473
That's his,
uh,

3442
02:37:32,710 --> 02:37:34,050
his office.
Whoa.

3443

What is he doing in there?
