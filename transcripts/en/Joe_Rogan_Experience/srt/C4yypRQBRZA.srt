1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,403
Sure.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,960
Sam bitches.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,573
I don't hear shit.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:06,300
Oh,

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:06,960
I don't even have my,

6
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,910
that's how high was what happened.

7
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:10,970
I don't even have the
headphones on my ears.

8
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:11,431
And I'm like,

9
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:12,840
why am I not hearing anything?

10
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:13,920
Meanwhile,

11
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,810
they're pressed up against
the top of my head.

12
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,880
What the fuck dude?

13
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,550
Really after all these years,

14
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,900
that's how you roll in it.

15
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:23,700
And when Eddie Bravo is here,

16
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,110
that's embarrassing.

17
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,140
When you do like some serious stoner
shit and everybody knows you're a stoner,

18
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:29,270
you're like God dammit.

19
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,450
Yeah.

20
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,190
Fucked up one for the cause.

21
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,383
Yeah.

22
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,570
The show Rogan experience
is brought to you by,

23
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,490
this episode is brought to
you by audible.com and a
audible.com has this thing

24
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:46,491
that I've been raving about because it's
one of the coolest ideas that I've ever

25
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:47,730
heard,

26
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,001
uh,

27
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:53,001
in technology when it comes to
a audio books and audio podcast,

28
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,450
what they've done is they've
created something that's
an app for the kindle fire

29
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,210
and it really is worth
getting it just for this.

30
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:03,560
Uh,

31
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:03,820
it's,

32
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,490
it's an amazing application.

33
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:07,020
What it does is it allows you,

34
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:08,190
if you're a book reader,

35
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:09,180
I have,

36
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:09,870
um,

37
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,320
I have a kindle and I also have
a nook and they're both great.

38
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,310
But the difference between this kindle
fire thing is you can be reading the book

39
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,250
and you when you like you're
going to bed at night,

40
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,550
you could shut it off and it
will sync with your smart phone.

41
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,230
And then when you get in your car,

42
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:27,480
you hear the audio version of the book.

43
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,100
It's fucking incredible.

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,641
And it's,

45
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:31,980
it's done by professional actors.

46
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,750
So it's like a really good audio companion
book to the original book that you

47
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:37,080
can,

48
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,050
so you can either read it or listen to it,

49
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,710
which is a fucking brilliant.

50
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,680
I think that's like one of the
coolest inventions I've ever heard of.

51
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,640
I got a question now.

52
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:44,931
Yeah,

53
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:45,130
go ahead.

54
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,390
If you listen to a lot of books,

55
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:49,224
you know what I mean?

56
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,840
Can you still say you read a lot?

57
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,883
That's a good question.

58
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,570
That's a very good question.

59
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,230
Yes.

60
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,441
Yeah.

61
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:56,400
I don't know if you can.

62
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,363
Good.

63
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,570
It's close.

64
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,530
It's close,

65
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:04,210
but it's probably not the same.

66
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,430
There's probably something involved.

67
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:08,050
And actually reading the words yourself.

68
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,231
Yeah.

69
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:10,700
It seems more prestigious,

70
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:11,030
right?

71
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,680
That you actually read it yourself.

72
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,200
Yeah.

73
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,390
Is that more prestigious?

74
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:15,300
Says it's a little boring.

75
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,783
Boring.

76
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,381
Yeah.

77
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:19,070
I don't know.

78
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,903
I've definitely think

79
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,020
there's something too for a
reading as opposed to watching TV.

80
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,980
Like I find that people who read
more than they watch TV generally,

81
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,570
they have more interesting
shit to talk about.

82
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,823
Yeah,

83
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,880
they trust.

84
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,940
They trust a type letters
and sentences on paper.

85
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,340
More than like visual evidence.

86
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:40,830
It's kind of weird.

87
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,663
Like I read it,

88
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,441
I read it.

89
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:45,260
It means more because someone
typed it out like that.

90
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:48,920
People don't lie and fuck up reports
and fuck up all these different studies.

91
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,240
I thought we're talking about books.

92
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,721
Oh Shit.

93
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:51,554
I'm sorry.

94
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:51,980
I'm,

95
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,191
I'm,

96
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:54,800
I'm standing up for the people that listen
to books because I think I'm going to

97
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:55,790
get into listening books.

98
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,960
I don't have time to read.

99
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:57,794
God Damn.

100
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,890
I don't have it is easy.

101
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,100
There's

102
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,390
a lot of shit you can listen to it.

103
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,410
audible.com you can listen to lectures
and the standup comedy podcasts,

104
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,293
they have everything.

105
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,563
What's the matter?

106
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,220
Oh,

107
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,053
I thought you said something.

108
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:10,660
Um,

109
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:10,991
anyway,

110
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:11,141
it's,

111
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:14,190
it's a kindle is a,

112
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:15,940
is an awesome tool and this,

113
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:16,390
um,

114
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,140
whisper sync that links up with
audible.com is just brilliant.

115
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,130
It's just unbelievable.

116
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:21,520
It's such a,

117
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,780
it's such a great application.

118
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,411

00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,720

127
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,401
uh,

128
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:42,310
an excellent service and a
big supporter of podcasts.

129
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,750
We're also brought to you by onnit.com
if you haven't been to on it in a while.

130
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,441
And you know,

131
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:50,230
we used to just sell
vitamins and nutrients,

132
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,160
which we still do,

133
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,260
but we sell a lot of other cool shit too,

134
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:57,060
which w what we've started doing is
just all the shit that we find out about

135
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,030
that's really good.

136
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,790
We just start selling it like,

137
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,850
like blenders.

138
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:03,760
Like I would always talk about Kale
shakes cause I drink them every morning.

139
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:04,220
I,

140
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,600
it's,

141
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,040
it's one of the best things I've ever
done as far as like health to give me

142
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:09,820
energy.

143
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,820
I feel fucking great when I have these
big Kale shakes and it just filled with

144
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:16,810
nutrients and vitamins.

145
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,280
It just really feels good.

146
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:20,260
Like I feel physically better.

147
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,910
It's no doubt about it.

148
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,520
There's garlic in it and ginger in it.

149
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,050
So we just started selling these blenders.

150
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,640
Sally's BLENDTEC blenders,

151
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:27,951
they're,

152
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,320
they're fucking bad ass.

153
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,831
Uh,

154
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,420
I had a Vitamix before that.

155
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,620
Pretty fucking good too.

156
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,080
The difference is the
BLENDTEC really like,

157
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:38,410
makes it like almost everything
turns it really liquidity.

158
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,550
Whereas the Vitamix,

159
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:39,790
so it's,

160
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,140
there's a little more chewy to it,

161
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,011
but either way,

162
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:42,844
both of them are great.

163
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,930
We sell the blend tax.

164
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,200
We also sell kettlebells
now and battle ropes,

165
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,800
kettle bells and battle ropes.

166
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:51,100
Have you ever seen like
a rapes battle ropes?

167
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:52,781
They ever seen?

168
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:53,471
Like any of those?

169
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,220
Um,

170
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,890
countdown to UFC shows where guys
are doing strength and conditioning.

171
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,250
A lot of times you see them whipping
these big heavy marine ropes.

172
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:00,730
They look like,

173
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,170
you know,

174
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,580
the ropes that you would
use to tie up boats.

175
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,260
And that's actually exactly what they are.

176
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,010
And that's actually exactly
where we get them there.

177
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,310
They're fucking bad ass.

178
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,570
It's a wicked workout.

179
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,231
It's a,

180
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,520
it's great for your cardio,

181
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,301
your shoulders,

182
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:13,631
it works,

183
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:14,170
your core,

184
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,860
everything works.

185
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,740
It's like real functional
strength Type Shit.

186
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,000
That's what we're selling.

187
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,900
We're also selling the best
supplements we can find.

188
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,580
The best things we can sell you.

189
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:27,970
Anything that we find that we
find personally beneficial.

190
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,190
A lot of these things
are very controversial,

191
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:32,590
especially the idea of a nootropics,

192
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,540
which are vitamins and nutrients that
you take to enhance brain function.

193
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,280
And there's a lot of debate on that man.

194
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:40,840
There's a lot of people
that don't believe in it.

195
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,910
There's a lot of people
that try and say they don't,

196
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,060
they don't experience anything but
every single aspect of Alpha brain,

197
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,540
all the different ingredients have been
closely studied by people for years.

198
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,050
Um,

199
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,320
there's actually a whole page
of the science behind it.

200
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:56,810
Um,

201
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,530
we have,

202
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:57,830
uh,

203
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,320
altered and improved.

204
00:05:59,321 --> 00:06:00,800
The formula now was,

205
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:03,350
there was people that were
having like issues with Coleen.

206
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,550
It's a very strong tropic
and it really does,

207
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,630
in my opinion,

208
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,060
dramatically affect cognitive function.

209
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,380
I think that you're,

210
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,990
you just need a certain amount
of nutrients to get shit done.

211
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,950
And they have isolated
the best nutrients for,

212
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,310
uh,

213
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,340
for optimum use of the mind.

214
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,390
And uh,

215
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,740
it's very controversial.

216
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:25,551
And because of that,

217
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,410
we offer 30 pills.

218
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:28,210
The first 30 pills,

219
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:28,500
pills,

220
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,930
the order with any of the supplements,

221
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,760
you get a 100% money back guarantee.

222
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,260
You don't even have to return the product.

223
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:33,990
The,

224
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,700
the reason behind that is twofold.

225
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:35,931
One,

226
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:37,550
because nobody is trying to rip you off.

227
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,630
If I didn't believe in this shit as
Eddie Bravo yawns down to like one of my

228
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:42,740
best commercials ever,

229
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:46,550
and you beyond all your commercials
that all guns that they all suck,

230
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,110
but we've got to get through folks,

231
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,580
go get some Alpha brain.

232
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,270
That's the point.

233
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,081
You get your money back.

234
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:52,190
You don't even have to return the product.

235
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,061
And you know what?

236
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:54,020
I take that shit.

237
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,630
I take Alpha brain and the shroom tech.

238
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:57,351
As a matter of fact,

239
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:57,801
I'm out.

240
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:58,460
I need some more.

241
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,100
I've got some of my hair which
going up that room as a whole box.

242
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,970
I take it every day.

243
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:02,721
I believe it works,

244
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:03,320
man.

245
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,501
I,

246
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:03,860
you know,

247
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,060
I know you wouldn't.

248
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,500
I mean you've done more
research into those ingredients.

249
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,190
And I have,

250
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,140
and I'm a supplement from lake,

251
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,003
you know me,

252
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,480
I'm weighing to vitamins and shit.

253
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:19,310
I take more vitamins and minerals and
most people I know it's not going to turn

254
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,140
a dumb person to a brilliant person,

255
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:21,640
but what,

256
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,640
what it's going to do is it's going to
give your brain the resources it needs to

257
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,150
produce smoother thoughts,

258
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:30,500
if that makes any sense to leave it.

259
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,513
I believe in it too.

260
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,590
Shroom tech sport is another fantastic
supplement that an endurance supplement.

261
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,000
It's all based on the core steps.

262
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:38,451
Mushroom.

263
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:38,781
Again,

264
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:43,781
if you'd go to [inaudible] dot com all
of this shit is explained ad nauseum.

265
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:44,930
You dirty pitches.

266
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,620
All right,

267
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,250
that's it.

268
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:46,911
This weekend,

269
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:47,900
this Friday night,

270
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,270
Brian motherfucking red ban,

271
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Dunkin motherfucking Trussell and I
will be at the Moody Theater in Austin,

272
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,260
Texas.

273
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,520
Holla at your boy.

274
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,030
Um,

275
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,740
I don't think this may tickets left.

276
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:01,730
It's almost sold out.

277
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:02,750
But uh,

278
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,231
we're,

279
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:05,500
we're fitting to get
down Texas style or B.

280
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:06,860
All right,

281
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,480
let's cue the music man.

282
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:09,410
Fucking any problems here,

283
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:10,244
dude.

284
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,173
Explore.

285
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,490
[inaudible] [inaudible]

286
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,333
we do

287
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,720
plugs into the flood so the computer can
play through that soundboard out burnt

288
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:35,020
out.

289
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,310
Why you are echoing son?

290
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,383
I'm echoing.

291
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,830
I'll go is fuck you don't hear that
now say you sounded like a robot.

292
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,140
You were like an old
school Peter prepping song.

293
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,003
It's gone now.

294
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,301
Peter Frampton.

295
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:48,500
Let's see the first guy to ever use that.

296
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:52,450
That voice thing brought up on the like
I have a tube in their mouth and they

297
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:53,284
sing through it.

298
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,520
I don't know if he's the first guy.

299
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:56,020
Scorpions did that too.

300
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,113
Um,

301
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,500
when was Frampton wasn't even
before Scorpions forms the square.

302
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,680
That's like a harmonica thing.

303
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,020
I really don't know what the
fuck it is to tell you the truth.

304
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,520
I know it's smeared musician.

305
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,720
We might as well bring out a Kazoo.

306
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,840
What the fuck are you
doing with your mouth?

307
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,430
You know what it may be the songs
that I heard of them sucked anyways,

308
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,570
even without the Kazoo,

309
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:28,100
cause I don't like most songs so I,

310
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,520
I don't like most harmonica,

311
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,070
but what I do can really walk a harmonica.

312
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,761
It's pretty bad.

313
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:34,900
And we had that less shroud.

314
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:35,081
You know,

315
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:39,090
survivor man plays the shit
out of a harmonica that do,

316
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:40,960
it plays the shit out of a harmonica.

317
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,980
He does that shit all
day when he's going to

318
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,710
practice better.

319
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,010
He ain't got no berries to eat.

320
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:48,844
There's no face.

321
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,050
He's a bad ass.

322
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,230
My

323
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,931
Monica player,

324
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:51,201
man,

325
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:51,831
I was,

326
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:53,940
I was really touched yet.

327
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,850
He's legit mean.

328
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,900
But if your dorm,

329
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,260
old normal harmonica songs,

330
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,031
get the fuck Outta here,

331
00:09:59,031 --> 00:09:59,750
bitch.

332
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,910
You're not making enough noises.

333
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,130
It's gotta be on top of like
some deep ass awesome music.

334
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,983
Yes.

335
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,903
You know,

336
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,473
I don't know.

337
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:07,821
Yeah.

338
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:11,780
It's kind of be like a compliment to
some like dope southern guitar music,

339
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:12,090
you know?

340
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,060
Then it could see a little
harmonica moving in.

341
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,213
Deliverance.

342
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,220
Dueling Banjos,

343
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,810

344
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:19,490
little banjos ain't bad man.

345
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:19,941
This,

346
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:20,211
this,

347
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:20,990
um,

348
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,810
new band that I just
found out about called um,

349
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,160

350
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,030
fuck.

351
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,210
Go something roadkill.

352
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,970
Jesus Christ.

353
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,980
Ghost wrote roadkill goes choir.

354
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:31,910
I think it's the name of it.

355
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:32,810
Yeah.

356
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,081
Let me,

357
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,150
let me find out because
I feel like a Douche bag.

358
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:35,721
I said your words.

359
00:10:35,721 --> 00:10:36,540
Have you been hanging out?

360
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:36,850
Shut up.

361
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,683
So my own,

362
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,571
my own.

363
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,320
God Damn it,

364
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,920
Dude.

365
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,461
I'm telling you.

366
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:41,990
It's a fucking Badass band.

367
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,520
Roadkill.

368
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,530
Ghost choir.

369
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,460
Listen,

370
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,060
put up.

371
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,361
Put,

372
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:47,871
pull this up.

373
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:48,051
Can we,

374
00:10:48,051 --> 00:10:48,884
can we play music?

375
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,190
Pull up a sure.

376
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,260
I was freaking out as
good as it normally would.

377
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,543
Okay.

378
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,190
There's a song called
beggars guild and it's like,

379
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,810
it's got like a little
a banjo thing to it.

380
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,181
Dude.

381
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:03,590
It's a dope fucking song.

382
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:05,120
I played this song like a hundred times.

383
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,430
I don't know if you're going
to be into it and I'm curious.

384
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:08,330
That's why I want to play it for him.

385
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,370
Wrote a house on the spine.

386
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,890
Road kill ghost choir.

387
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,210
Oh,

388
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,740
you don't want to be put on the spot it,

389
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:15,350
let's hear it.

390
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,110
I'm curious now he and I,

391
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,330
but I love Eddie Bravo to death.

392
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,720
Okay.

393
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,680
He is my brother.

394
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,461
I don't like most.

395
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:24,770
We have totally different tastes in music.

396
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,560
I don't like most music.

397
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,110
I have totally different
tastes in everybody.

398
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,203
Everybody.

399
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,490
I don't like very much music.

400
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,540
You know,

401
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,370
when I was a kid I
couldn't accept that shit.

402
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,140
I didn't like when
people didn't like shit.

403
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,233
You got to understand.

404
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,430
I deejayed at a strip
club for holding years,

405
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:41,360
beggars guild.

406
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,831
That shit.

407
00:11:42,831 --> 00:11:44,690
I got music eight hours a day,

408
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,670
sash nonstop.

409
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:47,504
That was no breaks.

410
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:48,771
There's no break.

411
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:50,500
You've got to pay for the
next lap dance a motherfucker.

412
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,910
That's about it.

413
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,090
You got really bored with
Whitesnake after how many

414
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,923
girls came out?

415
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,393
Oh look,

416
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,880
that was before the show.

417
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,630
That was,

418
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,510
that was 87.

419
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,390
I didn't start tag until like 93,

420
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,860
but that song hung around.

421
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:06,750
It's true a little bit by that time.

422
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,003
Uh,

423
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,770
there's only like one metal chick per
strip club and she plays some Whitesnake,

424
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,220
but most of the girls were
playing what was modern,

425
00:12:14,221 --> 00:12:18,450
what was had they were playing like
stone temple pilots or nine inch nails or

426
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,360
Madonna.

427
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,550
I got all in Manson.

428
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,650
I got in a car accident and uh,

429
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,890
I got in a car accident with this girl
that I was dating and she was like super

430
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:26,910
melodramatic man.

431
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:27,750
She was hilarious.

432
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:28,321
But,

433
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:28,980
uh,

434
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,520
when,

435
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:29,850
uh,

436
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,520
this old dude ran a light and hit us and,

437
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:32,700
uh,

438
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,400
I had to take my shit out of my car
because I couldn't drive my car.

439
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,540
And in my car,

440
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:40,260
I had a white snake cassette
and she picked it up.

441
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:40,651
She goes,

442
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:41,610
you have to throw this out.

443
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,860
She made me throw out a
white snake cause this is it.

444
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,723
This is them.

445
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,661
Listen to this band,

446
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:50,494
man.

447
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,710
That was funny.

448
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,850
Tell me if you like these people

449
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,550
smelly.

450
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,390
She's not getting the full effect
of the base in this two things.

451
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,530
Once the light,

452
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,920
the live performance and the,

453
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,783
I like it though.

454
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,870
I like this guy's got him
fucking hypnotic voice man.

455
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,823
Okay.

456
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:47,830
No,

457
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,440
I'm not doing this song
justice by lending to it.

458
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,700
Like I do like this.

459
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,230
You gotta you gotta listen to their,

460
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:53,441
uh,

461
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:54,760
their studio version of it.

462
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:56,380
It's fucking great man.

463
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:56,800
Whew.

464
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,611
What a song,

465
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:58,444
man.

466
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,920
I like it.

467
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,753
I could tell it's good.

468
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,471
Yeah.

469
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:02,891
I'm a,

470
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:03,490
I'm a,

471
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,350
I'm a fan of like dudes
who play like what?

472
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,320
I love to hear the guitar,

473
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:08,721
you know,

474
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:10,270
I'd love to hear the drums.

475
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,470
I love to hear Shit.

476
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,070
You,

477
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,540
you're in like cool,

478
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:17,140
like electronic type music and everything.

479
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,831
That's good.

480
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:19,180
And if you listen to my music,

481
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:20,920
it's a little of everything.

482
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,730
There's not,

483
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,563
I mean,

484
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,130
there's a little metal,

485
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,150
there's little Edm,

486
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:26,170
there's little dubstep,

487
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,520
whatever the latest,

488
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:28,331
she would never like.

489
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:29,890
Listen to a led Zeppelin album,

490
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,541
you know what?

491
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,960
And led Zepplin has about
five songs and I really liked,

492
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,100
but overall,

493
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,910
overall,

494
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,121
you know,

495
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:37,960
like stairway to heaven,

496
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:38,640
it's a great song.

497
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,011
All right,

498
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:39,760
that's a great song.

499
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,660
I'll ramble on.

500
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,471
Fucking great.

501
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:43,360
So there's a couple legs up and stuff,

502
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:46,840
but most of my misty mountain
high and rock and roll,

503
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:47,674
whatever.

504
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,420
Most of it was on the boogie tip.

505
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,740
I wasn't on the boogie tip.

506
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,010
It's like Boogie rock with a,

507
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,830
with a lot of blues and shit really.

508
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,570
And hours into a kiss and kisses,

509
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,380
more like anthems and,

510
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:00,214
and,

511
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,011
and more.

512
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:01,844
Um,

513
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,950
it just was the kissing.

514
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,121
I was on that side.

515
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:05,391
I was,

516
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:06,320
I was on the kiss side.

517
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:07,670
I wasn't on the led Zeppelin side.

518
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:08,360
It was a,

519
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,070
but I respected the shit out of him.

520
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:10,881
But,

521
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:11,090
uh,

522
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,520
I just was a kiss fucking freak dude.

523
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,540
I was so poor.

524
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:14,781
Really.

525
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,470
I didn't have enough money to be
into more than one band at a time.

526
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:21,740
So I chose kiss and I dove in
and by the time I got into kiss,

527
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,960
they already had like
eight albums and shit.

528
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,710
I had,

529
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,060
I got a dollar a week.

530
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:26,450
I'm like,

531
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,220
that's a lot of fucking dollars.

532
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:29,810
I got save saved by these kiss albums.

533
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:31,120
There were six 99 at the post.

534
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,820
Crazy that at one point in time you
used to have to pay to get some music.

535
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,063
That was the only way.

536
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,521
I mean,

537
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:37,861
boy,

538
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:40,340
did the fucking rug come
out of that business.

539
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:40,731
Yeah,

540
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,370
man had a lot of alums to catch up.

541
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,061
So I didn't,

542
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:44,570
I didn't have,

543
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,730
I didn't allow myself
to get into other bands.

544
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:47,271
To tell you the truth.

545
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:47,661
For a while,

546
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:50,270
from the age of eight to 13,

547
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,260
it was always just kiss.

548
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,060
I only can afford one band.

549
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:55,130
So I have a pretend like
I only liked one pen.

550
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,660
My brother could own everybody.

551
00:15:56,661 --> 00:15:58,380
All my friends could only afford one band.

552
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:00,410
So my brother was in the van Halen.

553
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:00,890
Uh,

554
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,390
you know,

555
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,680
the Eric across the street was into rush.

556
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,460
Uh,

557
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,140
then this guy was in to the police,

558
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:06,651
you know,

559
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:08,090
and then we just borrowed each other shit.

560
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,280
But the band that you were in charge of,

561
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,240
that was your baby.

562
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:11,991
You know what I mean?

563
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:13,230
That's ridiculous.

564
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,240
It's crazy.

565
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,500
It's the stupidest shit ever.

566
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,120
What the fuck is wrong with children?

567
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,141
Oh.

568
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:19,010
And then we can go and kiss.

569
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,340
Got The sold out and it
became bubblegum ish.

570
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,320
They basically became Mc
Hammer of rock and roll.

571
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,653
That happened.

572
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,510
That happened.

573
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,980
It started happening in [inaudible] 78.

574
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,910
They just got too big,

575
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:29,780
too commercial.

576
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,070
They did a movie on Channel Four and NBC
movie called Kiss meets the Phantom of

577
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:34,670
the park.

578
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,560
It was on contract.

579
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,551
It was out of control.

580
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:39,080
They were like superheros state dude.

581
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,330
I was severely depressed
because when it came on,

582
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:43,100
there was a blackout where I lived.

583
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,070
The fucking power was
out while kiss meets.

584
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,090
The Phantom was on TV and I was so
depressed and I couldn't believe it.

585
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:50,301
I'm like,

586
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,250
how the fuck could this happen?

587
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:55,190
Now that movie is what got me into kiss.

588
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:56,570
Cause before that movie,

589
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,610
the,

590
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,610
the general consensus among kids
at school was that kiss like,

591
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:05,840
cause they're older brothers will
telling him his kisses for homos.

592
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,240
So I remember being at school the
night it was supposed to be on being at

593
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:13,330
schools and talking to my friend saying,

594
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,540
are you going to watch that kiss movie?

595
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:14,781
They're like,

596
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:15,614
no way.

597
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,770
Kisses for fags at eight
year olds were saying that,

598
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,730
you know.

599
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,001
Yeah.

600
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:20,511
It was crazy.

601
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:21,020
So,

602
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,940
and I was pretending like
I didn't like kiss either,

603
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:23,151
you know,

604
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:25,310
cause my Stepdad was into
classic rock and I would,

605
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,500
I would say like Ted Nugent or something.

606
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:27,860
You know what I,

607
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,340
I just,

608
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:28,461
yeah,

609
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:28,990
I'm into that.

610
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,190
You know,

611
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,080
I wasn't in the kiss,

612
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,870
but we were all excited
to see that kiss movie.

613
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,440
Kids didn't have risk and that was like
two 78 they didn't have respect for

614
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:36,890
kiss.

615
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,330
That's how they were going down.

616
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:39,300
They were just too commercialized.

617
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:43,490
That was kiss ice cream cause bubblegum
kiss pencils that were going down.

618
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,500
Nobody had any respect
for him at that point.

619
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,540
There were falling off
when I was in high school.

620
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,860
Like the dudes were like that.

621
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,530
I hung around with everybody
listened to like the doors

622
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,510
blend,

623
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,343
spectacle,

624
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,660
Mick kiss by the age of eight when
I was at you couldn't admit kiss,

625
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,020
but when that movie came on that night,

626
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,940
me and my brother was four years older.

627
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,100
We were so excited to see this
fuck this band that we were were,

628
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,520
we were already dissonant.

629
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:09,330
We didn't even see him.

630
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,160
But that movie blew me away.

631
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:12,390
Rock and roll all night.

632
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,780
When they played that shit on the
movie as an eight year old kid,

633
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,310
my head exploded.

634
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,290
All I wanted was rock and roll all night.

635
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:19,831
I was like,

636
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:20,820
Cartman Dragon.

637
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:22,320
His mom did the fucking record.

638
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:22,830
Still going.

639
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,250
Um,

640
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,090
I dragged my aunts.

641
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:24,420
I'm like,

642
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,350
rock and roll all night.

643
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:26,220
That's the one I want.

644
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:26,700
I'm,

645
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,600
we looked for it.

646
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,040
It was on kiss alive.

647
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,903
It was a live record.

648
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,410
I didn't know what a live record was.

649
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,161
So I just said,

650
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:33,290
this is the one that
says rocket all night.

651
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,100
This is the one.

652
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,831
And my aunt goes,

653
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:36,270
I think this is at a concert.

654
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,681
What are you talking about?

655
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:38,161
It's a record.

656
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,780
It's not a concert by the record.

657
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,703
Got The record,

658
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,760
played it,

659
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,690
put the needle down.

660
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:43,950
And when you hear the audience coming in,

661
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:45,270
like what the fuck is this?

662
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,381
It's a concert.

663
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:46,920
I was like,

664
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,730
I didn't even have,

665
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,590
I didn't know what a live record was.

666
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:52,320
I didn't understand just
the live too and kiss alive.

667
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,950
Three,

668
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,200
I got kiss alive one
that that was my first,

669
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,650
our first kiss record and that crushed me.

670
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:01,110
That album destroyed strutter dues.

671
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,270
Got to choose Rechis lives.

672
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:03,721
Yeah.

673
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:04,590
But by the,

674
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,890
by kiss alive three that was like already,

675
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,710
uh,

676
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,670
in the 90s,

677
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:12,170
dude when everything was dead because
the life they were shit I picked up with,

678
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,870
there's errors of kiss before
me that I didn't get into.

679
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,610
I never got into like the really early,

680
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,001
early,

681
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:18,834
early shit.

682
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,030
I came in around Detroit rock city.

683
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:26,210
I came in early cover when they were
on the cover of a double platinum,

684
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:27,070
no,

685
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,811
not double platinum.

686
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:29,460
What was the destroyer?

687
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,210
That was the first album after they're
live on the first three albums where

688
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:33,770
like,

689
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,110
uh,

690
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,050
failures and they weren't selling man.

691
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,861
And then they just said,

692
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:38,161
dude,

693
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:40,620
let's just try a live record
because live or killing it.

694
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,580
Everyone loves a slide,

695
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,930
but we can't sell any records.

696
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,190
Let's do a live record.

697
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,671
And they said,

698
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:44,911
okay,

699
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:45,540
let's try it.

700
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,081
They did it.

701
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:47,070
And that's the one that blew him up.

702
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,480
Kiss alive him the fuck up.

703
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:53,630
So destroyer was the first studio album
after this live record that blew him up.

704
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,390
Right?

705
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,720
What,

706
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,710
what bands out?

707
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:57,530
They'd get blown up
from their live records.

708
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,910
None of them that we're the only ones.

709
00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:00,120
So fun though.

710
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,390
Yeah.

711
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,220
And they would live shows where like dad,

712
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,290
they look Paul Stanley,

713
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,510
you can make fun of like this.

714
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,380
There's dudes who have like
taken his all of his life,

715
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,770
the Star Child Center kiss Paul's
people have taken like his,

716
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,710
all of his in between stuff and
Rico and brought it to like one CD.

717
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:17,850
I forget the guys who did it,

718
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:20,220
but they sent it to me and
it's fucking hilarious.

719
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,181
It's brilliant.

720
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:23,870
They took a whole is best rants and hey,

721
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,850
I know like,

722
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,053
oh dude.

723
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,150
But he's a showman like a motherfucker.

724
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,550
I mean,

725
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,820
the place is going crazy
stories ready to go.

726
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,110
He had to love guns.

727
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:37,621
Story.

728
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:40,430
Every story had the cold Jin's story.

729
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,503
He,

730
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,511
every concert,

731
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:43,620
like there's three songs,

732
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:44,950
maybe two or three ways.

733
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,800
Got a story and he's
talking about it's so,

734
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,670
yeah,

735
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,503
it's such

736
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,440
a big show,

737
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:50,850
you know,

738
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,790
that went to see them.

739
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:52,001
I,

740
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:52,450
you know,

741
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,030
it was back when Gene Simmons
was still spitting fire.

742
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,110
Uh,

743
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,300
he's never stopped spinning
fire still does it,

744
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:58,541
you know,

745
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,374
you can easily,

746
00:20:59,520 --> 00:20:59,820
you know,

747
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,850
when the makeup came off,

748
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:02,500
he still spitfire that shit.

749
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:03,550
He'll never stop doing that.

750
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:05,390
Cray did his hair ever catch on fire?

751
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,690
Caught on fire early in their career.

752
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,500
That's crazy.

753
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,500
And then ace got electrocuted by the
stair railing was to God Jesus Christ.

754
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,470
That's a crazy ass show,

755
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:17,800
man.

756
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:17,980
Yeah.

757
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,813
So that movie,

758
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:19,191
you know,

759
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:19,901
from that movie on,

760
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:21,590
I was a kiss fanatic and,

761
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,200
but I was getting into them.

762
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:23,551
Right.

763
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:25,510
We're never going down and had no respect.

764
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,500
But that's when I got into them
is when they lost all respect,

765
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,310
uh,

766
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,370
from the mainstream media
when it came to Iraq,

767
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:33,910
you know.

768
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,590
And so I had a fight with my friends.

769
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,280
Everyone's made,

770
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,810
made fun of me that I liked kiss.

771
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,830
I had a fucking,

772
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,850
there was a bunch of music that I had
to go back and sort of review cause I

773
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,520
dismissed it because it was all like
serious stoners that we're into it.

774
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:46,840
Like the doors is one of them.

775
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:50,860
I never was really adores person when
I was in high school because all the

776
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:55,000
people that were in the doors were
all fucking serious burnouts man.

777
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,060
Because you've got to think like that.

778
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,680
This was after like,

779
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,371
okay,

780
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:03,040
I was in high school in 1981 all right,

781
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:03,970
when did he die?

782
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,360
I don't do die like in the 70s I never
was adores fan girls who are still into

783
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:12,730
like Morrison like that late.

784
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,220
It's like they were like fucking,

785
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,800
they always had jean jackets on.

786
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,810
So he's cigarettes in their pockets.

787
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:24,010
Those had dirty hair and they
would just burnouts and that's,

788
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,600
so that's what I
associated with the doors.

789
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:28,690
Those are the people that always have the
door shirts and I had to like become a

790
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:32,740
man one day and become my own man and
listen and go God damn the towards had

791
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:35,560
some good fucking songs and
then I got into them afterwards.

792
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:40,240
So it's like the people that were so
into him sort of negatively affected my

793
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:42,340
opinion of him unfortunately.

794
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:44,740
Yeah,

795
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,020
you can never admit that you
would like certain bands though.

796
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:49,510
There are certain bands and if you
brought up that you were into a map,

797
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:50,261
people get angry.

798
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:53,320
I had to pretend it got so bad I had to
pretend for a while that I didn't like

799
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:53,681
kiss.

800
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:53,950
I'm like,

801
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,240
I don't like this anymore.

802
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:55,970
Goddammit.

803
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,890
I hate them.

804
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,791
I was in high school,

805
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:01,990
I was on a bus and I told this dude
that I was going to go see a cheap trick

806
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,921
were I was like,

807
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:03,820
cheap tricks come in town,

808
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:04,654
we'll go see cheap trick.

809
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,990
And this guy turned
around and looked at me.

810
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:06,521
It was meant cheap.

811
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:08,050
Chip fucking sucks.

812
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,671
And I remember like,

813
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:10,450
wow,

814
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,380
this guy totally just not
respect my taste in music.

815
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,730
He just shot it down.

816
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,910
I couldn't even say anything about it.

817
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:16,330
I was like,

818
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:16,631
well,

819
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:21,250
you know to you like the what you say
when someone just shits on you and then

820
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:22,001
even while you're there,

821
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:25,390
that can influence your
enjoyment of going to see it.

822
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,051
You know?

823
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:27,370
Because even though you're enjoying it,

824
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:27,581
you're like,

825
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:28,240
God damn it.

826
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,120
Like why does this band made me
feel like a loser for liking them?

827
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,060
Yeah.

828
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,790
The thing about the kiss
though that they've,

829
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,320
no one has ever done,

830
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,470
no one has ever done kids.

831
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,680
They went to superstardom.

832
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,510
Then they went to Mc Hammer status and
vanilla ice status and then they came

833
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:47,540
back and did it all over
again with the same members.

834
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:51,800
They got ace and Peter Back who ended up
getting kicked out for being drunks and

835
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:54,530
coke heads in the late
seventies in the height of it,

836
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:55,490
they kicked out their drummer,

837
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:56,550
they kicked out the guitar player,

838
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,413
got them replaced,

839
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,340
but when they did the
reunion tour 15 years later,

840
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:02,001
20 years later,

841
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:03,020
whenever the fuck it was,

842
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,370
they got ace and Peter Back and then
they blew up again and they took their

843
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:10,640
makeup off and then they put it
back on the most interesting.

844
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,030
Yes,

845
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,260
I left that part out.

846
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,760
You got during the reunion and when
they died they decided to take off their

847
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:20,420
makeup for about 10 years and
they went on and they were lost.

848
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:21,760
They didn't know how to dress dude.

849
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,420
They just looked at the
other bands and said,

850
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,850
you know what poison is there?

851
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,950
I guess the Tremie look is
in let's look like trannies.

852
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:28,850
I think that's what's in.

853
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,380
When we were in high school,

854
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,250
they would like,

855
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,650
they always had like Bandanas on and shit.

856
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:35,750
When they were going to clubs and stuff,

857
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,020
like they had to like hide their identity
and they'd get these photos of them

858
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,460
like trying to put a
palm up to the Presley,

859
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,650
couldn't get photographed like that
was the weirdest sort of celebrity ever

860
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,780
because these guys were superstars,

861
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,580
but nobody knew what they looked like.

862
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,570
I don't know if everybody today can
wrap their head around how fucking crazy

863
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:54,350
that shit was.

864
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,161
How crazy is that?

865
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:58,250
Come on there like late
seventies these dudes done that.

866
00:24:58,251 --> 00:24:59,810
No one has that in music.

867
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,100
No one else has done the which
no one knows what you look like.

868
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:04,581
You,

869
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:06,050
we got to get pictures of you on man.

870
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,680
That shit was like CIA
secret shit right there,

871
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,310
dude.

872
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:15,310
They pulled that off from (970) 310-1983
were done 10 years for 10 years.

873
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:17,720
They had makeup.

874
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,250
You could only do that back then.

875
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,900
You could never get away
with that shit today.

876
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,670
There's too many people with cameras.

877
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,460
Too many people who put
that shit on Youtube,

878
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:25,701
you know?

879
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:27,290
They just know where Paul Stanley lives.

880
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:28,124
Just wait,

881
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:28,910
just wait.

882
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,481
Just wait.

883
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:30,470
Wait in front of his house,

884
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,623
you know,

885
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,170
they ain't put a camera
in front of his face.

886
00:25:33,171 --> 00:25:34,004
There he is.

887
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,300
And then when they did it again,

888
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:36,290
when they blew up again,

889
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,840
ace and Peter got kicked out again
for the same shit and they really get,

890
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:41,870
they got kicked out again.

891
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,913
What happened?

892
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,820
They just got started going off rocks.

893
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,160
They're drunks and I think Peter was
just too old and he couldn't even play

894
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:49,671
anymore.

895
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:50,231
And they're like telling me,

896
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:50,780
well you know,

897
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,230
because because uh,

898
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:52,700
uh,

899
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,100
Paul Stanley isn't like marathon shape.

900
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:57,200
He's always been a workout
health free like his,

901
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,273
his body,

902
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,430
he's like very athletic and
he's like 60 something now,

903
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:01,640
you know,

904
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,200
65 and gene Simmons is not the
in the best shape but live.

905
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,400
He gives his his,

906
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,520
he loves being on stage so much that
every night Jean Simmons gives it 110%

907
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:13,611
every night.

908
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:14,480
He's on fire,

909
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:14,810
Dude.

910
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,643
He can't,

911
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,740
they won't stop touring
men or 68 years old.

912
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,720
How much do they love being on stage?

913
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,130
Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons,

914
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:22,880
they stayed together.

915
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,810
They never broke up.

916
00:26:23,811 --> 00:26:24,530
They never quit.

917
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,810
They went through a lot of
guitar players and drummers,

918
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,620
a lot of them,

919
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,540
but it was always Peter or Paul and gene
sticking together with without makeup.

920
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,361
They never stop.

921
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:34,640
They never take took a break.

922
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,670
I still don't think
they feel like they get,

923
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:40,700
they're like just rewards or no,

924
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:42,530
cause every interview
you hear the bitterness,

925
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:45,120
every dogging on the media,

926
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,380
they're dogging on
journalists and they're,

927
00:26:47,381 --> 00:26:48,630
they're reminding people,

928
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,021
you know,

929
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:50,760
you can't ignore the millions of fans.

930
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:51,031
You know,

931
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,140
just listen to the fans.

932
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:52,321
You know,

933
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:54,600
forget about they hate
journalists because you know,

934
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,410
they got,

935
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,300
they blew up without any radio airplay.

936
00:26:57,301 --> 00:26:59,190
You couldn't even play
them on the fucking radio.

937
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:00,720
That's how taboo they were.

938
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,450
They did it without radio airplay,

939
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,960
but why wouldn't the radio recognize
how many people were coming to see their

940
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:09,990
concerts and buying their
albums and just play their shit?

941
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,310
That doesn't make any sense.

942
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,380
Like they're like,

943
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:17,370
we're not going to allow
these goofy clowns to just,

944
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,670
you can't look like a clown
and make rock and roll music.

945
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,200
They were just not allowing them.

946
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:23,843
They weren't allowing it.

947
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,510
That was it.

948
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,390
That must have been an incredibly
tough time to be an artist,

949
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,321
you know,

950
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:28,431
to,

951
00:27:28,431 --> 00:27:33,270
to have to deal like only with record
companies and only with radio stations.

952
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,310
That's just a couple of decades ago.

953
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,110
Like what a weird world we live in
today where people get fame through

954
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,640
electronic means.

955
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:44,890
Like how many people like that Dj ts,

956
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,530
was that his name?

957
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:45,721
Yeah.

958
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:49,610
How many people have heard his shit
because it's been online or dead mouse or

959
00:27:49,611 --> 00:27:50,220
enhance people?

960
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,120
All you could,

961
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,601
they could.

962
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:56,190
Those guys could become famous just
by virtue of their product and it's

963
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:57,300
spreading virally.

964
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:57,710
Yeah.

965
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,410
That,

966
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,750
that's what a shit time.

967
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:02,400
It must've been when that couldn't happen.

968
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,320
When you had to deal
with all these assholes,

969
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:05,790
it wouldn't play you on the radio.

970
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,271
And they're like,

971
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:06,871
what do you have to do?

972
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:07,950
How do you get played on the radio?

973
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:08,783
What do you have to do,

974
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:09,280
you know,

975
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,380
does connect with anybody,

976
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:11,214
play them?

977
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:11,581
It's not,

978
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:11,821
you know,

979
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:12,410
that that was,

980
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:12,900
there was,

981
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,600
it was very rare that you
heard a kiss song on the radio.

982
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,621
He would not.

983
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:17,454
They would not.

984
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,120
Uh,

985
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,830
well they,

986
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,150
they played hours made for
loving you a little bit.

987
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:22,400
They did play Bethlehem.

988
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,180
That was the disco era.

989
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:25,070
They went a little disco.

990
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:25,830
They said,

991
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,663
look it,

992
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,240
they thought they thought discos the new
thing and it's going to be the future.

993
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:30,961
So kiss,

994
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:31,920
they made a decision.

995
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,780
Paul and gene are businessmen.

996
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,500
They go with the trends
and sometimes it's,

997
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:36,850
it's,

998
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,120
it's obvious that we owe now,

999
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:39,271
oh,

1000
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:41,070
you're going to go really
heavy on this album.

1001
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,401
Why?

1002
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:43,680
Cause everyone dogged you that
you went to commercial and disco.

1003
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:44,221
Oh,

1004
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:44,920
let's see.

1005
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,590
Like the careers in the toilet,

1006
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,850
they got to come back at me.

1007
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,470
That's what they did and
creatures of the night,

1008
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:49,890
you know,

1009
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:50,400
it's,

1010
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,233
it's,

1011
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,400
their career is just fucking insane.

1012
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,120
It's a crazy life to be a musician man,

1013
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,740
to make noises that
people like to listen to.

1014
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,933
That's what you do.

1015
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,420
You put together words and he'd make noise
with your mouth and with some musical

1016
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:08,421
instruments are professional
noisemaker what a crazy thing that is.

1017
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:08,750
The,

1018
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:08,960
the,

1019
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,910
the beauty of music is so misunderstood.

1020
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:14,790
It's so hard for us to wrap our heads
around what the fuck is really happening

1021
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:17,130
when you're listening
to a song because it's,

1022
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,340
there's something,

1023
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,650
something happens to you,

1024
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:20,520
like a real,

1025
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,550
a good song like does fire
you up and make you feel good.

1026
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:27,360
It gives you a charge.

1027
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,081
You know,

1028
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:32,610
there's certain times when you're in
your car and it's just the right song for

1029
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:34,080
the right moment and you know,

1030
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:35,340
like God damn,

1031
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:36,270
this feels good.

1032
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:36,990
And that's,

1033
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,660
that's generally the way I feel that way.

1034
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,680
What you're describing as when
I'm driving to go teach class,

1035
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,070
when

1036
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,650
I'm driving to teach class my,

1037
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:50,040
I just took my glaucoma medication and
then I find just the best song that I

1038
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:54,880
liked that song that I could put it on
repeat and I crank it really loud and I'm

1039
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:57,190
thinking about training Jujitsu.

1040
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:57,460
I'm like,

1041
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,460
I'm driving and I'm going to go transcend
Jujitsu and all my boys that I love

1042
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:05,080
are going to be right there and
we're all going to work together.

1043
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,450
And when I get in that zone and I'm
listening to an an amazing song,

1044
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,590
it's the craze.

1045
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,640
It's man,

1046
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,180
it's,

1047
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,610
it really is like a meditative state,

1048
00:30:15,611 --> 00:30:17,750
like a waking meditative
state where you're,

1049
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:18,101
you're like,

1050
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:19,480
you feel connected to the universe.

1051
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:19,711
Man.

1052
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:19,781
I,

1053
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:20,600
it's hard to explain,

1054
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,690
especially while under the
influence of Glaucoma medication.

1055
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,170
Yes.

1056
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,220
Especially that.

1057
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,580
And the best song if you've
got crazy and ate some,

1058
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:28,761
yeah,

1059
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:30,290
and you've got some love
that you're going to,

1060
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:33,410
you're driving to and you got to just
people just driving from San Diego,

1061
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:35,930
people drawn from Costa
Mesa just to train.

1062
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,160
That's when I,

1063
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,440
when I think about that
and how amazing that is,

1064
00:30:39,441 --> 00:30:39,741
man,

1065
00:30:39,741 --> 00:30:42,320
and how much love I'm
going to have at my gym,

1066
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:42,501
man,

1067
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:43,281
when I'm there.

1068
00:30:43,281 --> 00:30:43,750
That's,

1069
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,240
it's,

1070
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,811
it's amazing,

1071
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:45,644
man.

1072
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,401
I love being there.

1073
00:30:46,401 --> 00:30:46,940
Every night.

1074
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,370
Songs have this weird effect on people,

1075
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:50,060
man.

1076
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,421
You know?

1077
00:30:50,421 --> 00:30:51,860
I wonder if it can be measured,

1078
00:30:51,861 --> 00:30:55,580
like the good feeling that you get
when you hear a bad ass fucking song.

1079
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,200
Like for me it's like,

1080
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,900
I know this song gets worn
out for a lot of people,

1081
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,883
but for me,

1082
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,650
the first few chords
of Sweet Home Alabama,

1083
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,700
I always go,

1084
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,900
fuck yeah.

1085
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,630
Like I haven't loved that God damn song.

1086
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:08,870
I don't,

1087
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,300
I don't give a fuck of day
overplay that stupid song.

1088
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,520
You can overplay that shit forever.

1089
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,010
That's still is like one of my
all time favorites on the side.

1090
00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:18,800
If I'm in a car and it's a nice
day and that song comes on,

1091
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:19,040
I'm like,

1092
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,130
Oh shit and I'll turn that shit up.

1093
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,760
Right when he says to turn it it,

1094
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,473
boom,

1095
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,463
boom.

1096
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,630
It's just that feeling though.

1097
00:31:29,631 --> 00:31:30,920
I wonder if it can be measured.

1098
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:35,290
I wonder if you could put like a
electrodes on your head and find out what,

1099
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:35,661
what's,

1100
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:36,050
what's,

1101
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:39,140
what's firing up when you
really love to hear a good song,

1102
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,930
they should do that and then she'd get
people high and make them listen to

1103
00:31:41,931 --> 00:31:45,830
awesome music and just find out what
happened and then in between that awesome

1104
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:46,430
music,

1105
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,690
throwing some bullshit.

1106
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,160
So really whack ass,

1107
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,660
terrible fucking music.

1108
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,220
Some like really bad
Christian rock or something,

1109
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,080
something,

1110
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,390
something just terrible.

1111
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:01,420
Did you read that there was something
on Twitter about some research done on

1112
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:03,840
freestyle rappers and [inaudible]?

1113
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,311
I did,

1114
00:32:04,311 --> 00:32:04,941
but I saw it,

1115
00:32:04,941 --> 00:32:06,380
but I didn't want you to read it,

1116
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,330
so I saw it like as a headline.

1117
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:13,760
There's this study and they studied
freestyle rappers and they put some

1118
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:14,990
electrodes on their brain.

1119
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,670
I'm not sure how it really worked,

1120
00:32:16,671 --> 00:32:18,650
but as they were,

1121
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,660
they had him freestyle,

1122
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,141
freestyle,

1123
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:21,950
some stuff,

1124
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,310
and then the,

1125
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,310
I think they had him say some
letters that they knew before and,

1126
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:25,560
and,

1127
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,330
and see the difference in how the brain
works when you're freestyling and how

1128
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,390
the brain works when you're
just repeating stuff.

1129
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,130
Something like that.

1130
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:34,964
I could be wrong,

1131
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,360
but the old school,

1132
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,700
the overall,

1133
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,360
the overall of that was that freestyle
rappers are quicker thinkers.

1134
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:49,190
I mean obviously like the obvious stuff
did look at their brain is working

1135
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:51,110
faster than normal people.

1136
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:52,461
Yeah.

1137
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:53,294
They there.

1138
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:53,661
Well,

1139
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:56,120
the idea that you have to be creative,

1140
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,890
you have to put yourself into that,

1141
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,591
that mode.

1142
00:32:58,591 --> 00:33:00,980
What percentage of freestyle
rappers you think smoke weed?

1143
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,660
I think it's 190

1144
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,563
right?

1145
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,000
Hasn't,

1146
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,770
that's what I'm dying.

1147
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,480
They didn't talk about
the weed connection.

1148
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:08,841
Yeah.

1149
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:09,261
You know what I mean?

1150
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:11,210
You're talking about freestyle rappers.

1151
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,310
They're probably smoking weed all day,

1152
00:33:13,311 --> 00:33:14,660
stuffing their brain with it.

1153
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:14,841
Well,

1154
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:16,970
we had a mortal technique on his,

1155
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,610
his dude,

1156
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,443
Swayne.

1157
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,161
Remember that dude,

1158
00:33:19,161 --> 00:33:19,640
Brian?

1159
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,090
Yeah.

1160
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,840
That guy was a bad mother
fucker and battle rap.

1161
00:33:23,841 --> 00:33:28,040
Like there's some dudes who have that
shit down to an art form and you watch

1162
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:29,810
like one guy will come at them.

1163
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,370
So I'm like really dumb shit.

1164
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,080
And then they break them down.

1165
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:35,360
But some just ruthless shit.

1166
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,310
Those guys could freestyle their ass off
and they smoked the fucking shit out of

1167
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:40,811
some ways.

1168
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,800
It'd be cool if that shit was huge on NBC.

1169
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,151
Joe,

1170
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:44,650
when you sit 190%,

1171
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:46,420
where you and counting goes faces.

1172
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:46,930
Awesome.

1173
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,070
Is that how you got to that number?

1174
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,610
Yeah,

1175
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,690
that's exactly it is.

1176
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,623
And um,

1177
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,740
you know,

1178
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,500
multiple personalities to throw that in.

1179
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,340
I was just exaggerating,

1180
00:33:56,341 --> 00:33:56,760
Brian.

1181
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,593
That's all it is.

1182
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:58,350
Uh,

1183
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:58,861

1188
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,470

Like,

1190
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,690

1191
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:06,990

1192
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:11,990

There we go.

1209
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,390
Echo the reluctant dolphin.

1210
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,430
[inaudible]

1211
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,610
I want you to on the screen.

1212
00:34:48,611 --> 00:34:49,070
Yeah.

1213
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,890
It's a dolphin with a huge Boehner.

1214
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:52,180
And on the bottom right you can see us,

1215
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:53,240
it's frothy loads.

1216
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,680
You go around shooting,

1217
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,200
hiss on everyone in
fucking peep in the ass.

1218
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,390
And then you also have a come meet.

1219
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:00,224
Oh my God.

1220
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:01,870
Hello.

1221
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,740
And then here's a,

1222
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,960
here's the logo for our podcast,

1223
00:35:05,961 --> 00:35:07,160
pointless with Kevin Pereira.

1224
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,140
And those are Jesus's.

1225
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,550
So you're this dolphin shooting,

1226
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:11,780
come and kiss on people.

1227
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:12,590
And he turned me.

1228
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,570
Then Jesus comes out and
tries to fuck you up.

1229
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,550
And then he's shooting comment.

1230
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:17,390
Here's your fucking more,

1231
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,253
there's Kevin prayer.

1232
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,303
Wow,

1233
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,710
please stop this before we go to jail.

1234
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,740
That dolphins walking funny
cause you just got fucked.

1235
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:28,950
I just had Deja Vu.

1236
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,290
That dolphin was in prison.

1237
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,790
Something about my brain.

1238
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,160
His name

1239
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,401
is,

1240
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:39,090
uh,

1241
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:39,660
hold on.

1242
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,500
That's incredible.

1243
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,393
Yeah.

1244
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,770
His name is Tim e.

1245
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:46,030
H invest in that shoe.

1246
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,861
That's going to be huge.

1247
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:47,740
I know it's going to be here.

1248
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:47,980
Do you?

1249
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,410
That could be the
greatest game of all time.

1250
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,340
You want to really put
your money in that one,

1251
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,150
Brian,

1252
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,320
I'm going to be real with you.

1253
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,680
I think that's going to,

1254
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:01,700
cause that's going to be the final nail
in the fucking Jesus People's coffin

1255
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:05,150
where they go straight Taliban on
people even draw Jesus anymore.

1256
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,390
We're coming for you bitches.

1257
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:11,450
It even has a a meter that says frosty
loads and then it also has coffee.

1258
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,510
Rocky loads it and also has a gate meter,

1259
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:15,970
but it's spelled with an h instead of gay.

1260
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:17,831
Listen man,

1261
00:36:17,831 --> 00:36:18,390
you can't,

1262
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:18,760
uh,

1263
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,930
you can't be attached to that.

1264
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,570
It's going down and it's going
to bring you do with with it.

1265
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,980
I just want to say off the record,

1266
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,201
uh,

1267
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:29,410
if it had I known the
content of that video,

1268
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,060
I wouldn't have allowed it to be played.

1269
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,730
Dolphins can't fuck Jesus in my world.

1270
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,020
I don't allow it.

1271
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,491
Android.

1272
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:35,891
Jesus.

1273
00:36:35,891 --> 00:36:38,440
I don't care where we can
call whenever you want.

1274
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,340
That's he actually fucked Jesus.

1275
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:40,910
No,

1276
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,960
I think Jesus shows up.

1277
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,220
Jesus.

1278
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,053
You know what?

1279
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,710
They were going to have him fuck Jesus,

1280
00:36:45,711 --> 00:36:46,191
but they thought,

1281
00:36:46,191 --> 00:36:47,024
you know,

1282
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,271
dolphins are flush.

1283
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:50,630
Try to get the video game
off the fucking ground.

1284
00:36:50,631 --> 00:36:50,871
Okay.

1285
00:36:50,871 --> 00:36:51,880
We don't need to go there.

1286
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,840
This the second version,

1287
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,171
you know,

1288
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,390
we'll save it for them in
the video of the dolphins.

1289
00:36:56,391 --> 00:36:56,871
Fuck people.

1290
00:36:56,871 --> 00:36:58,150
You can't fuck people in videos.

1291
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,120
I'm sorry.

1292
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,953
You can't just run around.

1293
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,580
He's in Lucky's house.

1294
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,810
Terminator Jesus though.

1295
00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:03,644
Look,

1296
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,690
and he has meant to us.

1297
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,480
I watched the terminator the other day,

1298
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,610
um,

1299
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,443
and uh,

1300
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,110
it was a terminator two and
it was really weird to watch,

1301
00:37:14,111 --> 00:37:14,710
man.

1302
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,220
You know,

1303
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,031
it's really weird.

1304
00:37:16,031 --> 00:37:20,590
Like how like kind of like the acting
style was like different back then.

1305
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,190
Like the movies where
they just like they were,

1306
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,240
they weren't as like evolved.

1307
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,200
Which ones to the second one was the,

1308
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:28,721
what was that?

1309
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:29,840
The one where the dude has that?

1310
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:30,880
The guns and roses one,

1311
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,000
which was the guns and roses one to

1312
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,710
two is when he returned and he was,

1313
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:38,320
she was,

1314
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,150
she was like in a mental
institution and shit.

1315
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:40,984
Doing Chin ups.

1316
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,391
Go on.

1317
00:37:41,391 --> 00:37:43,900
This mother fuckers coming
back Arnold when he was mean.

1318
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,070
I liked it in the first one.

1319
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:45,610
That's it.

1320
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,810
Oh you mean like when he came back?

1321
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:47,644
Nice.

1322
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,143
I'm not into that.

1323
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,811
I wasn't as good.

1324
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:50,640
I liked the main one.

1325
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,720
The main one was way scarier.

1326
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:51,971
Look,

1327
00:37:51,971 --> 00:37:54,190
why would they have the same
model come back nice with the,

1328
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:56,560
can't make a different model
and it's just so stupid.

1329
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,060
It's the same model.

1330
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,390
The first model was a motherfucker
finally seen a good movie.

1331
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,550
Argo Dude.

1332
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,361
I heard Argos.

1333
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:05,260
Very good Argos.

1334
00:38:05,261 --> 00:38:05,850
Fucking good.

1335
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,670
It was a really,

1336
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,810
I thought I was reluctant to see it
cause I thought it was going to be like

1337
00:38:10,811 --> 00:38:14,500
contagion where it shows like that
our government is so good and with the

1338
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:15,700
viruses and the vaccine,

1339
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,190
it's like contagion was a joke.

1340
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,090
It was almost like produced by the
CIA almost or FEMA or something.

1341
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,140
It was weird but,

1342
00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:25,060
and I thought they were going to do
the same thing with article make the

1343
00:38:25,061 --> 00:38:27,940
Iranians look like just
fucking these evil Daryl is,

1344
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:29,410
they want to make bombs
and shit like that.

1345
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,000
But they told the truth.

1346
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,080
They did in the beginning.

1347
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,180
They set up,

1348
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,220
I mean it in the beginning.

1349
00:38:36,221 --> 00:38:37,120
It makes the,

1350
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:40,840
the United States look at fault for a
lot of the shit that's going on and it's

1351
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:43,830
the truth and the movie itself is damaged.

1352
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,920
It's pretty amazing man.

1353
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:45,770
Wow.

1354
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,600
Doing it.

1355
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,640
That's a strong endorsement
by Young Eddie Bravo.

1356
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:53,600
I usually hate movies but that one I
stayed for the movies and I love language

1357
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,300
ones cabin in the woods.

1358
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,860
Oh Jesus Christ.

1359
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,330
Oh my God.

1360
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:05,380
If you're going to try to be funny or
you're not going to be serious at better

1361
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:06,310
be like real funny,

1362
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:06,791
like funny,

1363
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:07,240
funny,

1364
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,100
not like you liked it.

1365
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,150
It was beautiful.

1366
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,043
Okay.

1367
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,191
50 50 thing.

1368
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:14,110
Like I get in my tweets,

1369
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,610
people say I'm fucking crazy.

1370
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:17,770
And then some people agree to me.

1371
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:19,270
It was just exciting fun.

1372
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,290
It was just ridiculous,

1373
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,130
silly fun,

1374
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:21,890
you know?

1375
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:25,360
But I believe these fucking people have
a remote control and it can change the

1376
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:27,910
house and make monsters and
Sigourney weaver at the end,

1377
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,250
it was almost hilarious.

1378
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,010
I Dunno,

1379
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,120
I enjoyed the shit out of it.

1380
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,290
It was campy to me.

1381
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:32,720
Uh,

1382
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,750
it was like intentionally campy.

1383
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,740
I thought it was really good.

1384
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:36,603
I enjoyed it.

1385
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:37,811
But uh,

1386
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:38,111
yeah,

1387
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:38,530
it's hard.

1388
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,570
It's hard to fucking
make a good movie dude.

1389
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,380
I think,

1390
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,120
I think got too many people involved.

1391
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,910
I think when you got some bad
motherfucker like James Cameron,

1392
00:39:45,911 --> 00:39:47,620
that can just totally take the reigns.

1393
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,300
That's how you get like an Avatar.

1394
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,360
You got to have some like real
strong personality behind it.

1395
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,750
That's why like it's always important,

1396
00:39:53,751 --> 00:39:57,580
like Francis Ford Coppola is this or that
because I think there's so many people

1397
00:39:57,581 --> 00:40:02,050
involved and poking and prodding and
wanting this and putting in that.

1398
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,700
I think making a movie must be,

1399
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,500
it's just a fucking tremendous nightmare.

1400
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,680
It working with all those people
and hoping they work together.

1401
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,630
I have a friend who's a,

1402
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,420
a movie director and a cheesy,

1403
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,530
if you ever met Patty,

1404
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,103
uh,

1405
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,103
Patty Jenkins,

1406
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,290
Bryan County,

1407
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,123
his ex girlfriend,

1408
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:20,740
she's,

1409
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,101
she's,

1410
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:21,934
um,

1411
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,630
great,

1412
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,440
great person,

1413
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,240
fucking really interesting chick,

1414
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:27,580
really smart chick and
she's an it director.

1415
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,250
So she tells me some fucking stories,

1416
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:30,551
man.

1417
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:34,270
The story she tells you about having
to work with like crazy actors,

1418
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,480
people that are just not
people you never even heard of,

1419
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,690
he's fucking out of their mind.

1420
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,730
They just hold up production and go crazy
and claim fake illnesses and faint and

1421
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,260
should do weird shit to get attention.

1422
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,640
Like people are nuts.

1423
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:49,300
So you got to bring all
these motherfuckers together
and try to put some movie

1424
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:50,134
out of it.

1425
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,870
So ridiculously hard proposition,

1426
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:53,561
you know?

1427
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:54,394
That's why I was,

1428
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,660
I've always looked at bands,

1429
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,231
you know,

1430
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:57,520
I've always looked at bands like going,

1431
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:01,720
that's got to be fucking hard thing
for all these guys to get along.

1432
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,420
Oh Man.

1433
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:02,860
You know.

1434
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,693
See the guns,

1435
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:08,260
just recently I saw the guns and roses
a behind the scenes of the behind the

1436
00:41:08,261 --> 00:41:08,681
music,

1437
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:11,410
rocky mentoree and I
saw the quiet riot one.

1438
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,390
You got to see the quiet riot one.

1439
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,470
You'd got to see,

1440
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:14,850
it's a,

1441
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,640
the VH one behind the scenes
and the guns and roses.

1442
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,270
When those guys,

1443
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,643
the whole,

1444
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,760
the whole documentary is about how
much party and never doing and how much

1445
00:41:24,761 --> 00:41:29,410
drinking and it was driving them insane
how much coke they were doing and

1446
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,500
drinking two fifths of Jack every damn
like I duff from guns and roses are so

1447
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:36,740
fucked up.

1448
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,251
He couldn't even,

1449
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:38,450
he couldn't even talk anymore.

1450
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,590
The super rich,

1451
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:42,460
they're huge and they're just
drinking and doing so much coke.

1452
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:44,300
They're out of their fucking minds.

1453
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:44,990
They,

1454
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,040
it's almost like they,

1455
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,210
they feel,

1456
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:51,410
it's almost like you understand
axel axel like the Dick,

1457
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,370
but when you watch the rocky Mentari he's
hanging out with these drunk dudes all

1458
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:55,701
the time.

1459
00:41:55,701 --> 00:41:56,201
I don't know.

1460
00:41:56,201 --> 00:41:56,400
I don't,

1461
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:56,520
I,

1462
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:56,720
it's,

1463
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,550
it's hard to tell who's really at fault.

1464
00:41:58,551 --> 00:41:59,121
Like axles,

1465
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:00,380
the control,

1466
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,340
Hungary,

1467
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,990
a tyrant,

1468
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:06,440
he wanted control of everything and
then everyone else is super drunk.

1469
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,020
It's like you understand a little bit,

1470
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:09,321
right?

1471
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:09,950
It has,

1472
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:13,370
it has to be so hard to keep all
those egos in check when they,

1473
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,350
when they explode and get huge,

1474
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,820
it's gotta be so hard,

1475
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,310
especially for like certain
dudes like in the background,

1476
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:20,390
like drummers and shit.

1477
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,850
I was just not getting
that much attention.

1478
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:24,910
Got to get crazy,

1479
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:28,460
get into like Tommy Lee was one of the
few guys that got attention yet to be a

1480
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:30,650
drummer and to have
people know who you are.

1481
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:31,880
And your first and last name.

1482
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,940
Randy Travis Barker.

1483
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:35,460
Tommy,

1484
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:35,990
Tommy Lee.

1485
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,823
And that's it.

1486
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,293
That's it.

1487
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,580
It can't be Peter Criss.

1488
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:41,983
Yeah.

1489
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,460
Household names.

1490
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:44,990
Tommy Lee is a household name.

1491
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,310
So it was Travis bark.

1492
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:46,880
Yeah.

1493
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,290
Householding.

1494
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,410
Everybody knows who it is.

1495
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,150
Very few times.

1496
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,320
That's crazy.

1497
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:51,651
Yeah.

1498
00:42:51,651 --> 00:42:52,730
That's a weird spot,

1499
00:42:52,731 --> 00:42:53,061
man.

1500
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:54,170
The celebrity drummer,

1501
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,460
that's a rare spot.

1502
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,320
Those might be the baddest
motherfuckers ever.

1503
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:59,060
They shined through that position.

1504
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,201
Tom.

1505
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:01,910
Tommy Lee is a bad motherfucker.

1506
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,560
Everybody just had to see his dick and go,

1507
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,180
okay,

1508
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,013
I gotta shut the fuck.

1509
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:07,790
What are you going to say guys?

1510
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,490
Guys are rock star and
he has a giant Dick.

1511
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,001
That's it,

1512
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:11,834
Dan.

1513
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,400
He just kind of accept that

1514
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:15,380
there's,

1515
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,220
thank God he does.

1516
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,050
He's not really good at Jujitsu Shit.

1517
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:18,711
Ricky rocky.

1518
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:20,360
Imagine if he was also really good.

1519
00:43:20,361 --> 00:43:21,400
A real good fighter too.

1520
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,243
Shit.

1521
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,520
Ricky rocket's a fucking black belt.

1522
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,530
Yeah.

1523
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,110
Legit black belt in Jujitsu.

1524
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,650
Whoever thought that Ricky
rocket is the drummer of poison.

1525
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,630
He's another one.

1526
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:32,600
He's another famous one.

1527
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:33,171
We missed him.

1528
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:34,100
Famous trumped up there.

1529
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:34,520
He's,

1530
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,420
he's a household name.

1531
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,370
If Ricky rocky went on a killing spree,

1532
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,750
that shit would be front page news.

1533
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:39,723
Yeah,

1534
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:42,883
he's a good dude.

1535
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,670
Yeah.

1536
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:44,810
He seems like a nice guy.

1537
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:45,171
Like you know,

1538
00:43:45,171 --> 00:43:46,100
I think that uh,

1539
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,500
someone who gets really good at Jujitsu,

1540
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:51,350
like you can't get that far without like,

1541
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,393
he was super cool.

1542
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,693
Super Cool.

1543
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:54,410
Super Cool Guy.

1544
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,191
Trained with them a lot,

1545
00:43:55,191 --> 00:43:56,090
hung out with them a lot.

1546
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,810
We,

1547
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:57,491
we both went to,

1548
00:43:57,491 --> 00:43:58,580
we all went to the same school.

1549
00:43:58,581 --> 00:43:59,211
It was really,

1550
00:43:59,211 --> 00:44:01,760
really super cool and it was a,

1551
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,620
it was a trip to see,

1552
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:03,981
you know,

1553
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:04,700
so much,

1554
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:04,971
you know,

1555
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:07,180
he was like in a band
it's known to look like,

1556
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,043
you know,

1557
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,580
like they look like girls
that have lots of makeup.

1558
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:11,331
They did,

1559
00:44:11,331 --> 00:44:12,164
but you know,

1560
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,430
for what they were doing,

1561
00:44:13,431 --> 00:44:13,971
they look great.

1562
00:44:13,971 --> 00:44:18,040
That was selling and he
was a Badass in Jujitsu.

1563
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,630
It's a good thing to have.

1564
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,140
Yeah.

1565
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:21,921
And he's any,

1566
00:44:21,921 --> 00:44:23,930
does that whole cast magnet system two,

1567
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:24,440
which is the,

1568
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,460
in a sana system,

1569
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:29,760
which is the Filipino system he's really
good at that was really into Weldon.

1570
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,960
Like Kali and all that
stuff is really good.

1571
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:32,920
Yeah.

1572
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,180
He loves stick fighting,

1573
00:44:34,181 --> 00:44:34,871
knife fighting,

1574
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:35,590
all that shit.

1575
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,220
That shit.

1576
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:36,330
Yeah.

1577
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:40,120
You don't fuck with the
drummer from poison no matter
how much makeup is wearing

1578
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,200
because they're back on tour,

1579
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,520
he's going to be wearing all that makeup.

1580
00:44:42,521 --> 00:44:45,670
Just don't call them a homo telling you.

1581
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,953
Why did you even put it

1582
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:47,491
out there?

1583
00:44:47,491 --> 00:44:48,460
Because then someone's going to go,

1584
00:44:48,461 --> 00:44:50,080
Fuck Eddie Bravo.

1585
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,000
Fuck Ricky rocket.

1586
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,430
There's certain dudes that you meet there.

1587
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:58,930
The funniest defiance conversations I
ever have with clueless folks are the

1588
00:44:58,931 --> 00:45:02,260
people that tell me
that if they fought MMA,

1589
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:06,640
they would never lose because it's just
a mentality because of that mentality.

1590
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,560
But how many times have
you talked to that guy,

1591
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:09,550
that guy,

1592
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:10,383
there's been,

1593
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:11,830
there's this many,

1594
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:15,280
many of those guys out there and
you drift into them like icebergs.

1595
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,520
Like it'd be backstage at the UFC and you
don't even realize you're talking to a

1596
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:20,650
crazy person until they
say something like that.

1597
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:20,801
Like,

1598
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,340
you know,

1599
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,930
I mean these guys are
all tough and everything,

1600
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:24,160
but I'll tell you my mentality.

1601
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:26,890
I can't lose the fucking,

1602
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:27,641
yeah.

1603
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,400
You know what man,

1604
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,081
that guys like me,

1605
00:45:29,081 --> 00:45:29,914
you don't get in there.

1606
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,320
That's the difference guys like me
with my mentality that you know the gun

1607
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:33,441
there,

1608
00:45:33,441 --> 00:45:34,211
they never stopped.

1609
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:35,500
The referee couldn't pull me off.

1610
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:36,510
Okay.

1611
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,930
I usually get the guys that say,

1612
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:38,641
you know,

1613
00:45:38,641 --> 00:45:39,190
they don't do that.

1614
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,140
I'm then maybe they don't train,

1615
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:44,990
but if anything went down they would
kick them in the knee and I'm like,

1616
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,241
really?

1617
00:45:45,241 --> 00:45:46,110
Are you how?

1618
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,170
How often are you practicing this kick?

1619
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,350
How many days a week?

1620
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,393
How long?

1621
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:52,560
I mean if he was highly,

1622
00:45:52,561 --> 00:45:54,570
three days a week was sitting,

1623
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,140
you know,

1624
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,570
sit in front of the bag and
just kick into the knee,

1625
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,250
45 minutes a day,

1626
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,120
three days a week,

1627
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:02,280
I might believe he's onto something like,

1628
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:02,521
damn,

1629
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:04,420
maybe he's got this crazy
because you didn't know how to

1630
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,010
fight and you ran into some Moitai guy.

1631
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:07,880
For whatever reason,

1632
00:46:07,881 --> 00:46:11,600
he just decided to only kick your legs
out from under you and just kick your

1633
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:13,010
legs until you're done.

1634
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,440
Like that could be possible.

1635
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:15,950
Yeah,

1636
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:16,783
that's possible.

1637
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,370
That's a guy who's really good at that.

1638
00:46:18,371 --> 00:46:19,204
I could do that,

1639
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,151
but the knee kick,

1640
00:46:20,151 --> 00:46:20,510
man,

1641
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,343
come on,

1642
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,790
come on son.

1643
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:23,660
Yeah,

1644
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,401
and they believe it.

1645
00:46:24,401 --> 00:46:26,020
They believe it and I end up with that.

1646
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,400
I'm going to see that week,

1647
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,790
the knees Bra,

1648
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,420
it takes 10 pounds of pressure
statistics and it just snaps Bra.

1649
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,710
There's certain statistics.

1650
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:36,371
That's one of them.

1651
00:46:36,371 --> 00:46:38,410
The other one is you only
use 10% of your brain,

1652
00:46:38,411 --> 00:46:39,244
bro.

1653
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:39,941
Bro,

1654
00:46:39,941 --> 00:46:40,721
you're only using,

1655
00:46:40,721 --> 00:46:41,051
you know,

1656
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:43,840
they've only documented the people
who only use 10% of the brain

1657
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,840
takes eight pounds of pressure.

1658
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:47,830
Snap a Negro.

1659
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:48,843
I can do that.

1660
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:50,490
Really good.

1661
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:51,941
Real good.

1662
00:46:51,941 --> 00:46:53,520
Does pseudo intelligence.

1663
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:54,610
Stoner bullies,

1664
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:56,200
it takes eight pounds of pressure.

1665
00:46:56,201 --> 00:46:58,060
It's been documented
on the history channel.

1666
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:03,010
Eight pounds of pressure for a fucking
front snap kick right to the need.

1667
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,330
It's over the fights over.

1668
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,320
Okay.

1669
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,790
I walk around with confidence.

1670
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:09,280
Joe Or Joey Diaz talking about that.

1671
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,750
All he needs is a kick in the knee.

1672
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:12,340
How would he say Joe Rogan,

1673
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:13,091
Joe Rogan.

1674
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:13,924
Let me tell you something.

1675
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,370
Can you fuck with me dog?

1676
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,080
I got one side kick.

1677
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:20,360
350 allegedly pounds is coming down.

1678
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,213
Your fucking neat.

1679
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:21,821
Well,

1680
00:47:21,821 --> 00:47:23,610
you've gone bitch going nowhere.

1681
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,820
Come at me with that fucking karate shit.

1682
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,070
Ninjitsu Fuck Outta here.

1683
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,230
Side kicks to the knees.

1684
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,550
Grab a slice.

1685
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,510
That's how I'm rolling.

1686
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,680
Grab a slice.

1687
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:37,990
Have a seat back.

1688
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:41,110
A lunch that needs to happen.

1689
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:41,261
Uh,

1690
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:42,850
Joe and Joey Diaz.

1691
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:46,000
Cartoon with Joe Rogan doing the voice.

1692
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:49,990
Why would you have me doing him?

1693
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:52,750
Mine is a poor substitute
for the actual man himself.

1694
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,440
It's just funny cause it's close cause
I've been around him sound just like him.

1695
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:00,970
You say it's like you get into his
soul like you're saying the shit.

1696
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:02,070
He would actually say that.

1697
00:48:02,071 --> 00:48:03,790
That's what's funny is you're doing him.

1698
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,340
You're actually doing him.

1699
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:06,790
I know Joey.

1700
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:08,500
Probably as much as Joey now Joey,

1701
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,190
how important is it to have
people like Daniel Life?

1702
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:13,450
Man,

1703
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:14,850
if you find yourself a Joey Diaz,

1704
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,461
you remember be nice.

1705
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:16,294
Not Guy.

1706
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,460
Provide you with entertainment constantly.

1707
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,190
Brian Callen when we
went hunting together,

1708
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:21,521
dude,

1709
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:23,380
I had a comedy show for five days.

1710
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,243
That's what I had.

1711
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,610
You know I did the prions,

1712
00:48:26,611 --> 00:48:28,810
lucky cow and it was
like the perfect move.

1713
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:33,580
I turned like this boring ass camping
trip where it's 10 degrees out into a

1714
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:37,510
constant comedy show where Kallan was
talking about how he likes to fuck guys.

1715
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,620
Well this is what I'm doing.

1716
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,020
I'm,

1717
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,120
I'm holding you.

1718
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:40,601
Okay.

1719
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:40,871
And that's,

1720
00:48:40,871 --> 00:48:41,481
I'm holding you.

1721
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:42,600
I'm looking at your ear and him,

1722
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,040
he would just come up with all these
crazy things and we just feel it.

1723
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:50,860
It was one of those jokes where it's
the same joke over and over again.

1724
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:54,070
It's all about fucking guys
holding guys down a fucking guys.

1725
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,210
But it starts off really funny
and ridiculous and then you like,

1726
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,030
you wonder how long can this
fucking guy keep this up?

1727
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,840
And then five days in you're
still laughing at the same data.

1728
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:08,780
It's just him talking
about holding guys down,

1729
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,670
fucking them.

1730
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,800
And it's like he has no,

1731
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,410
he has no shame and no limit.

1732
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,170
You can just keep going,

1733
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:17,230
going.

1734
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,990
So it was literally like
a five day comedy show.

1735
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,570
It was the most I've ever laughed
while freezing my dick off,

1736
00:49:22,571 --> 00:49:23,650
sleeping outdoors.

1737
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,780
It was a perfect experience.

1738
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,890
Plus he's just a fucking awesome guy and
counts one of those guys that doesn't

1739
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:30,461
complain.

1740
00:49:30,461 --> 00:49:32,560
Like he'll just go do
what needs to be done.

1741
00:49:32,561 --> 00:49:33,970
Like we had to go hiking and shit.

1742
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,110
He just goes hiking.

1743
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:37,540
He doesn't give Joey Diaz
went on the trip with you.

1744
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,290
What would you say,

1745
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:39,100
Joe Rogan.

1746
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,040
There's a fucking blondes
two miles away from my house.

1747
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,850
Don't get me antelope.

1748
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,710
You want to take me out to the
fucking bad lands of Montana?

1749
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:52,270
Suck my Dick.

1750
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:53,163
Okay.

1751
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:53,381
Uh,

1752
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:54,790
Dan never did nothing to me.

1753
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,770
God wanted us to beat and D
and and in a fucking store

1754
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,980
and buy a fucking beer.

1755
00:50:04,981 --> 00:50:06,430
Cheese balls or whatever.

1756
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,750
He's fucking guys with your grey
poupon on your fucking deer burger.

1757
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,213
Fuck Outta here.

1758
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,290
Stuff.

1759
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:14,140
A nice slice.

1760
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:15,310
It's two points

1761
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:18,370
and a regular coke.

1762
00:50:18,371 --> 00:50:19,660
Don't even fuck with that diet.

1763
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:20,260
You don't know.

1764
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,610
You don't want that type of cancer.

1765
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:22,270
No.

1766
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,490
Is a type of finger.

1767
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:28,220
Isn't it crazy that we've
gotten fucking stupid

1768
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:32,180
as a society that you get your product
can advertise that you have real sugar

1769
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:33,080
and it's a good thing.

1770
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,710
How retarded Roe,

1771
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,940
we're putting that on billboards.

1772
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:40,670
Well that's because of corn
made with real sugar corn syrup.

1773
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,550
People are finding out how hard it is
for your body to process corn syrup.

1774
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,001
Yeah,

1775
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:45,050
but sugar is,

1776
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,420
corn is the motherfucker man corner.

1777
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,290
It's brought up.

1778
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,240
Do you ever watch that
King Corn Documentary?

1779
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:50,971
I think I have.

1780
00:50:50,971 --> 00:50:52,370
I've watched one crazy.

1781
00:50:52,371 --> 00:50:54,470
How much money there isn't growing corn,

1782
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:58,850
man Mike and using corn and all sorts of
different food items and there's a lot

1783
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:00,110
of like good uses for corn.

1784
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:00,531
First of all,

1785
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:01,101
it tastes good.

1786
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:02,270
Carla cobb's delicious.

1787
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,210
You know,

1788
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:04,710
corn tortillas make,

1789
00:51:04,711 --> 00:51:05,090
you know,

1790
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:06,830
makes for some Nice Tacos,

1791
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,080
but the reality is that's
just not good for your body.

1792
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,570
Especially like in corn syrup form.

1793
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:15,500
And that shit's everywhere so
bad that they're advertising.

1794
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,880
Look where we're using sugar after.

1795
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:20,810
I wasn't sugar like wasn't
it sugar free as good before?

1796
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:21,321
Well,

1797
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:21,860
you know,

1798
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,530
you're only supposed to get
sugar when it's attached to food.

1799
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:25,390
You know,

1800
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:30,320
the really the idea of extracting
sugar and then taking pure sugar,

1801
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:31,970
like that's not ever supposed to happen.

1802
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,290
It doesn't exist in nature,

1803
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,820
which just so fucked up man.

1804
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,630
We have to dabble with everything and
extract things and give you concentrated

1805
00:51:38,631 --> 00:51:39,290
doses.

1806
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:40,550
That's where cocaine came from.

1807
00:51:40,551 --> 00:51:41,000
Yeah.

1808
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,440
I mean if you eat the coca leaves,

1809
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:43,910
it's apparently very healthy.

1810
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,770
Like if the people that chew those leaves,

1811
00:51:45,771 --> 00:51:46,220
like those,

1812
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:46,550
those,

1813
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:47,420
those herders,

1814
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,020
those high altitude hurt and high,

1815
00:51:49,021 --> 00:51:50,780
is it only grown in Colombia?

1816
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:51,740
I don't know.

1817
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,750
Why is it there?

1818
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:53,950
Other countries growing coke,

1819
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,120
it seems like it's only good.

1820
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:55,550
Yeah,

1821
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:55,851
believe,

1822
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:56,180
yeah.

1823
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:56,590
Yeah.

1824
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:56,930
Um,

1825
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:57,381
I think,

1826
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:57,500
uh,

1827
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,420
there's quite a few
places that can grow it,

1828
00:51:59,421 --> 00:52:00,860
but I think it's a climate thing.

1829
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,100
But that doesn't make sense to me
because then why can't people grow in

1830
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:04,940
greenhouses?

1831
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,110
And you never hear about
cocaine busts where they've,

1832
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:07,380
they,

1833
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,200
they busted them with cocoa plants,

1834
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:09,951
you know,

1835
00:52:09,951 --> 00:52:10,701
so I don't know.

1836
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:11,570
I'm not a botanist.

1837
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:12,920
I don't understand what the fuck's wrong,

1838
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,640
but it seems like it would doesn't make
any sense that you'd have to get it all

1839
00:52:16,641 --> 00:52:18,230
from South America and less.

1840
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,550
It's the only place where it grows.

1841
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,560
That's the only thing
that makes sense to me.

1842
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:26,270
And I remember there was some
controversy about the Egyptian mummies.

1843
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:31,010
So one of the coolest things they found
was evidence of cocaine and a one of the

1844
00:52:31,011 --> 00:52:32,150
mummies when they did this,

1845
00:52:32,151 --> 00:52:33,830
like real thorough analysis of it.

1846
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,390
And that could be one of two things.

1847
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:40,040
It means either someone had made it all
the way to South America and brought

1848
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:40,910
back cocaine.

1849
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:44,480
That is one possibility or it's someone
from South America got in a boat and

1850
00:52:44,481 --> 00:52:46,760
came all the way to Egypt
and sold them cocaine,

1851
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:52,480
or it was some kind of a false positive
because there was some other substance

1852
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:54,080
that could mirror that.

1853
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:54,921
When you're dealing with,

1854
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:55,101
you know,

1855
00:52:55,101 --> 00:52:57,350
someone who's been dead
for 5,000 fucking years,

1856
00:52:57,351 --> 00:52:59,140
I'm sure there's a lot of
guesswork involved in the,

1857
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:00,500
in the analysis of it,

1858
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,740
but they were thinking that maybe the
Egyptian that got ahold of some eight

1859
00:53:03,741 --> 00:53:04,170
balls,

1860
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:05,460
maybe the archaeologist

1861
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:09,340
coke head and then like accidentally
spilled some coke on his shirt.

1862
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:11,591
He's like,

1863
00:53:11,591 --> 00:53:11,741
no,

1864
00:53:11,741 --> 00:53:12,471
it's the Egyptian.

1865
00:53:12,471 --> 00:53:12,761
She's like,

1866
00:53:12,761 --> 00:53:13,594
yeah,

1867
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,180
it's a ton and ton of
fucking gets the mummy.

1868
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,553
He did it.

1869
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:18,460
That would,

1870
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,640
that's you gotta roll with it.

1871
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:21,350
That's not outside the
realm of possibility.

1872
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:22,830
If you were a,

1873
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,350
it had to roll with chip tologist.

1874
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,333
He didn't have a choice.

1875
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,550
You get tired.

1876
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,860
You using that brush all day.

1877
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:28,830
You need a little pick me up.

1878
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:29,401
You know,

1879
00:53:29,401 --> 00:53:29,611
you see,

1880
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:29,761
look,

1881
00:53:29,761 --> 00:53:31,590
I'm just going to do
this coke this one time.

1882
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:33,310
I'm just going to get really juiced up.

1883
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:34,380
You gotta be a coke.

1884
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,960
Coke had to be an archeologist.

1885
00:53:35,961 --> 00:53:39,180
I fucking combing rocks
with a tooth brush.

1886
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,070
I'd be doing bath salts so kids
would forget what they were doing.

1887
00:53:44,071 --> 00:53:45,030
What the fuck was I dealing with?

1888
00:53:45,031 --> 00:53:45,864
The fuck was I doing?

1889
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,680
They would forget what they were doing
and they would try to start different new

1890
00:53:49,681 --> 00:53:51,420
businesses while they were cleaning it up.

1891
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:51,931
They'd be like,

1892
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:52,141
dude,

1893
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:53,310
I got this amazing idea.

1894
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,890
And they would try to try to bring you in.

1895
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,340
You're like my brother and mean.

1896
00:53:57,341 --> 00:53:59,040
Even though we just met
you like my brother,

1897
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:00,630
I want you to come in
and this idea with me,

1898
00:54:00,631 --> 00:54:01,464
man,

1899
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,453
let's do it.

1900
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:02,971
Let's do it.

1901
00:54:02,971 --> 00:54:03,870
Fuck archaeology,

1902
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:04,110
man.

1903
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:04,943
Let's make a boat.

1904
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,140
Let's make our own boat.

1905
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,800
Archeologists can kit that.

1906
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:08,700
They,

1907
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,070
they use our archaeology
sometimes to get checks.

1908
00:54:11,071 --> 00:54:11,441
Like the sound.

1909
00:54:11,441 --> 00:54:13,680
I'm going to go to each if you want
to come with me and help me out.

1910
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:14,670
Okay.

1911
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:17,380
I bet they would if they were a lot
of fucking toothbrushes of here.

1912
00:54:17,381 --> 00:54:18,960
We like academic chicks,

1913
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:19,411
you know,

1914
00:54:19,411 --> 00:54:20,244
like totally.

1915
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,200
That's like a romantic thing.

1916
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:26,580
A guy was like a published author and
Egyptologists and invites you to a dig.

1917
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,120
I go,

1918
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:27,841
oh my God,

1919
00:54:27,841 --> 00:54:32,210
how much pussy you think Georgiou
Georgiou was a handsome faster.

1920
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:33,270
It's probably crushing it.

1921
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,570
I would not want to speculate because I
don't know the man's personal situation,

1922
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,770
but I would say that if he
wanted to Giorgio so close,

1923
00:54:40,771 --> 00:54:42,060
so smooth talking about the fucker.

1924
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,320
Everyone makes fun of his hair.

1925
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,130
He knows that he's done.

1926
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:47,250
He doesn't know is that the pitches
are going to remember this hair.

1927
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:48,781
It was funny,

1928
00:54:48,781 --> 00:54:48,961
man.

1929
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:53,961
He got upset at me when I retweeted the
thing about ancient aliens debunked,

1930
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:55,080
you know,

1931
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:55,741
he was upset.

1932
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:56,070
I'm like,

1933
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:56,903
look,

1934
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:58,710
this is how I looked at it.

1935
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,790
You cannot be upset when
someone points out mistakes.

1936
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,680
You can't shoot the Messenger.

1937
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:05,221
And he was like,

1938
00:55:05,221 --> 00:55:06,930
I didn't know you supported Christians.

1939
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,250
You know the kinds of fundamental,

1940
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:08,701
it's Christian.

1941
00:55:08,701 --> 00:55:09,534
And I was like,

1942
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,171
okay,

1943
00:55:10,171 --> 00:55:11,004
look you man,

1944
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:11,910
I like you a lot.

1945
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,310
And I liked that whole
subject of aliens a lot.

1946
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:18,900
But that guy who made that video pointed
out a lot of shit that was an accurate

1947
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,520
and that's important.

1948
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,830
It's important to get shit accurate.

1949
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,300
It's important to not make
speculations based on faulty evidence.

1950
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,980
And when you got a television show,

1951
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:30,840
you have a certain
amount of responsibility.

1952
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,310
So in my opinion,

1953
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:33,810
instead of being upset at that guy,

1954
00:55:33,811 --> 00:55:36,540
he shouldn't upset that they put
something out that was accurate.

1955
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:41,070
But that doesn't discount the possibility
that we could have been visited by

1956
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,000
ancient aliens.

1957
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:46,290
That's where everybody wants to take one
camp or another and this debunker guy,

1958
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:47,210
he's like convinced.

1959
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:48,420
I used to believe that too.

1960
00:55:48,421 --> 00:55:50,550
But now I think it's
been thoroughly debunked.

1961
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,560
Nothing's been debunked.

1962
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,420
Yes,

1963
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:53,790
there's,

1964
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:54,960
there's one monkey.

1965
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:55,710
Okay.

1966
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:59,070
That looks way different
from all the other monkeys.

1967
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:04,370
And the only thing that we resemble his
dogs in that we are completely different

1968
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:05,161
looking,

1969
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:06,270
but we can breed with each other.

1970
00:56:06,271 --> 00:56:10,380
Like Shaquille O'Neal could
mate with Miley Cyrus.

1971
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:10,741
I mean,

1972
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:13,410
they don't even look like they're
remotely the same species.

1973
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:14,131
You know,

1974
00:56:14,131 --> 00:56:15,870
Shaquille O'Neal is seven foot,

1975
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,740
whatever the fuck he is.

1976
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:18,160
Miley Cyrus not a good example.

1977
00:56:18,161 --> 00:56:20,820
Like give me a really pale white girls.

1978
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:21,653
Tiny.

1979
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:22,980
Anyone,

1980
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,813
Bjork,

1981
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:24,470
Bjork,

1982
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:24,740
Sia.

1983
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,080
Donald.

1984
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:25,450
Yeah,

1985
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,420
it's Shaquille O'Neal could fuck Bjork.

1986
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,760
And they could have a baby.

1987
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,593
That's ridiculous.

1988
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,550
The only place that
exists in nature is with,

1989
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:33,600
with dogs.

1990
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:34,560
You know,

1991
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:38,400
like a baboon's can't fuck
Orangutang and get it pregnant.

1992
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,450
It doesn't work that way.

1993
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:44,280
But a dog or any dog can fuck any other
dog and they just make another dog.

1994
00:56:44,281 --> 00:56:48,110
Like you take crazy dogs like a beagle
and that'd be ego can fuck a uh,

1995
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,760
one of those giant Russian Wolf dogs.

1996
00:56:50,761 --> 00:56:51,720
You ever seen those things?

1997
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,210
The octa vox or whatever
the fuck it's called.

1998
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:54,841
It's crazy thing.

1999
00:56:54,841 --> 00:56:56,460
It looks like an American
Werewolf in London.

2000
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:56,791
I mean,

2001
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:58,380
it's the most ridiculous looking dog ever.

2002
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:58,621
Well,

2003
00:56:58,621 --> 00:56:59,221
they could fuck them.

2004
00:56:59,221 --> 00:57:02,070
They can make a little crazy
little hybrid baby that's a,

2005
00:57:02,071 --> 00:57:03,990
that only exists in people and dogs.

2006
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,580
And we know that human beings,

2007
00:57:05,581 --> 00:57:06,870
genetically engineered dogs,

2008
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:07,651
we know that,

2009
00:57:07,651 --> 00:57:07,831
you know,

2010
00:57:07,831 --> 00:57:09,810
by selective breeding and you know,

2011
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:11,190
how are the fuck they did it.

2012
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:12,210
They're not exactly sure.

2013
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,430
But they know that all
dogs emanate from wolves.

2014
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:15,120
Yeah.

2015
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:20,120
Somehow or another from wolves came
chihuahuas and beagles and bulldogs,

2016
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:22,470
all of them originated as well,

2017
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,480
which is really fucking fascinating.

2018
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:27,720
When you stop thinking about it because
we don't know about the origin of dogs,

2019
00:57:27,721 --> 00:57:28,560
the origin of dogs,

2020
00:57:28,561 --> 00:57:31,050
a very confusing and slippery subject.

2021
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:33,450
So then when you start talking
about the origin of people,

2022
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:36,630
what we fucking resemble
dogs quite a bit folks.

2023
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,201
Okay.

2024
00:57:37,201 --> 00:57:40,350
And we don't look like
anything else around us and
we don't behave like anything

2025
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:44,460
else around us where way fucking
smarter than everything else here.

2026
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:45,953
What's going on?

2027
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:46,871
What's going on and had,

2028
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:46,961
yeah.

2029
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:47,020
How'd

2030
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:47,853
we get here?

2031
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,270
It's confusing.

2032
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:49,841
That video.

2033
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:50,680
He was making it.

2034
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:55,330
He was trying to make it look like he
was debunking the whole ancient aliens

2035
00:57:55,331 --> 00:57:56,110
theory.

2036
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:56,591
Yeah.

2037
00:57:56,591 --> 00:57:56,890
He,

2038
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,080
he pointed out some mistakes and,

2039
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:03,870
but he was like debunking the
whole ancient alien theory.

2040
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:07,480
There's been a million
documentaries on the shit.

2041
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:08,890
The ancient aliens is done.

2042
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,650
It would agent Allianz is doing it.

2043
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,800
That's already been done,

2044
00:58:11,801 --> 00:58:12,634
but they're doing it.

2045
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,100
They're the,

2046
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:13,950
it looks the best.

2047
00:58:13,951 --> 00:58:15,340
It's highly produced.

2048
00:58:15,341 --> 00:58:16,720
It's all that history channel.

2049
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:17,853
So when I saw it,

2050
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,830
when I first saw ancient aliens are
already knew all that shit from,

2051
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:21,520
um,

2052
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,510
I didn't know everything.

2053
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:23,020
I just,

2054
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,280
I learned a lot from ancient aliens,

2055
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:26,910
but the subjects were like the,

2056
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:30,220
all the stuff from Zachariah Cichon,

2057
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:31,980
Nia and Joe are both
in disaccharides such,

2058
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:32,350
so,

2059
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:36,760
so to see it on a major
television network was awesome.

2060
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:37,601
Leather.

2061
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:42,601
They get a date here or pounds off
or whatever that's on the TV show.

2062
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:43,381
It's not on the,

2063
00:58:43,381 --> 00:58:44,410
the theory we've,

2064
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,010
this is,

2065
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:45,330
it was,

2066
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:47,350
it'll be like watching a Jujitsu,

2067
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,500
a documentary done by NBC,

2068
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:50,921
right?

2069
00:58:50,921 --> 00:58:51,860
The guys at NBC,

2070
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,380
they don't know Jujitsu that well,

2071
00:58:53,381 --> 00:58:55,030
but they want to do it
Jujitsu documentary.

2072
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:58,630
They could easily get frauds
or dudes you don't know,

2073
00:58:58,910 --> 00:58:59,830
do you know,

2074
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:00,190
uh,

2075
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:02,770
they're not real experts in
Jujitsu and put them on the show.

2076
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,220
And,

2077
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:03,490
uh,

2078
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:04,660
as a Jiu Jitsu expert,

2079
00:59:04,661 --> 00:59:06,130
you watch out and you're not going to,

2080
00:59:06,131 --> 00:59:06,371
you know,

2081
00:59:06,371 --> 00:59:07,720
this guy's a dumb ass.

2082
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,010
They put that motherfucker in there,

2083
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:09,280
right?

2084
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:09,970
They're not.

2085
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,380
And then someone comes around and says,

2086
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:12,161
Jujitsu went,

2087
00:59:12,161 --> 00:59:12,700
Shit,

2088
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,511
that guy's a fraud.

2089
00:59:13,511 --> 00:59:14,920
He's not even a real brown belt.

2090
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:15,311
You know,

2091
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:15,850
he's aligning,

2092
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:16,780
they put them on TV,

2093
00:59:16,781 --> 00:59:17,940
but that would,

2094
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:20,980
you're not denouncing
Jujitsu denouncing the show.

2095
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,120
And he needed to be more clear about that.

2096
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,630
He wasn't fucking up the theories.

2097
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:25,040
Come on,

2098
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:25,851
get the fuck Outta here.

2099
00:59:25,851 --> 00:59:27,200
You're going to tell me that,

2100
00:59:27,201 --> 00:59:27,920
uh,

2101
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,101
you know,

2102
00:59:28,101 --> 00:59:30,350
there's so much evidence
I could go on and on.

2103
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:33,500
You're going to tell me there isn't a
possibility that there's some crazy shit

2104
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:34,190
going on.

2105
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:34,940
You think like,

2106
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,290
you got it all figured out.

2107
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,480
There's a possibility that
anything could happen.

2108
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,153
You know,

2109
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:42,103
Joe,

2110
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,220
I'm done.

2111
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:44,053
If you,

2112
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,160
if you look at the,

2113
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,790
there's a bunch of different things
that happened to people and one of them

2114
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:54,740
that's the most confusing to scientists
is the doubling of the human brain size

2115
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:56,300
over a period of 2 million years.

2116
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,280
It's a really shocking fossil event.

2117
00:59:58,610 --> 00:59:59,780
They don't know what the fuck did that.

2118
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,621
And uh,

2119
01:00:00,621 --> 01:00:04,370
there's a lot of different theories
about higher protein consumption.

2120
01:00:04,371 --> 01:00:05,800
If we figured out
hunting and then went to,

2121
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:06,621
once you started hunting,

2122
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:09,500
our brains are growing because they
had to figure out how to outsmart the

2123
01:00:09,501 --> 01:00:12,170
animals and they connect
connected to the throwing arm.

2124
01:00:12,171 --> 01:00:15,200
The possibility that we figured out that
we can throw things in a manner that no

2125
01:00:15,201 --> 01:00:16,011
other animals can.

2126
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:20,270
So then we started catching things with
spears and that that accelerated our

2127
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:20,900
learning curve.

2128
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,040
There's a lot of like weird,

2129
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:25,280
but the bottom line is it's
a fucking crazy mystery.

2130
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:26,300
And if,

2131
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:31,300
if some alien race from another galaxy
who was unbelievably brilliant and many,

2132
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:31,911
many,

2133
01:00:31,911 --> 01:00:32,151
many,

2134
01:00:32,151 --> 01:00:32,421
many,

2135
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:32,751
many,

2136
01:00:32,751 --> 01:00:36,620
many generations ahead of us in
the future to the point where,

2137
01:00:36,621 --> 01:00:37,370
you know,

2138
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:39,140
they realized that,

2139
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:39,440
uh,

2140
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,530
in order to preserve intelligent life,

2141
01:00:42,531 --> 01:00:43,490
you have to seed it.

2142
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:46,550
So you'd have to come to a
planet that already has life,

2143
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,800
find the smartest thing there.

2144
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:49,581
What do you got here?

2145
01:00:49,581 --> 01:00:53,270
This is crazy monkey thing that's
figured out how to use a stick to pick up

2146
01:00:53,271 --> 01:00:53,780
ants.

2147
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:54,171
Okay,

2148
01:00:54,171 --> 01:00:54,501
good.

2149
01:00:54,501 --> 01:00:55,334
He's thinking,

2150
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:55,761
okay,

2151
01:00:55,761 --> 01:00:59,810
let's take some of them and let's do
some shit to their DNA and let's see if

2152
01:00:59,811 --> 01:01:00,590
they survive.

2153
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:01,640
And then they come back,

2154
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:05,120
they leave for a few thousand years or
whatever and come back and see what the

2155
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:05,750
fuck we have.

2156
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:05,881
Well,

2157
01:01:05,881 --> 01:01:06,770
what do we have now?

2158
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,240
While we have some new signals?

2159
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:09,470
They've developed nuclear weapons.

2160
01:01:09,471 --> 01:01:10,304
What do you want to do?

2161
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:11,690
Fuck that quick,

2162
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:13,670
and then they come back and check us out.

2163
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:15,320
It's very possible.

2164
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:16,400
It's just,

2165
01:01:16,401 --> 01:01:20,340
it's just as possible as
us sending rovers to Mars,

2166
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:20,730
we,

2167
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:21,920
we have done that.

2168
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:24,500
We have to realize that
if we have done that,

2169
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:26,900
and we have existed in this,

2170
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:29,780
in this planet for 4.6 billion years,

2171
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,930
it took for a human being
to get to this point.

2172
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,810
What if there's a planet
that's 20 billion years old?

2173
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:37,550
You know what?

2174
01:01:37,551 --> 01:01:39,860
If there's a planet that's just double it,

2175
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:41,360
let's go to 12 billion.

2176
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:43,010
What the fuck are we going to be like?

2177
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,920
It's 6 billion years or 4 billion years.

2178
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:46,580
Yeah.

2179
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,020
The whole crazy thing about the,

2180
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:52,190
the 10th planet or Nibiru
that planet is that,

2181
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,470
who knows if that's out
there really are not,

2182
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,041
who knows?

2183
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:55,874
But the,

2184
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:56,360
the what,

2185
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:56,690
the p,

2186
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:01,690
the way people react to that theory is
that there's trillions and trillions and

2187
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:05,180
trillions of stars and
planets every fucking where.

2188
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:08,180
But if you believe there's a
fucking another planet out there,

2189
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:09,170
you're fucking crazy.

2190
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,050
Problem with the Nibiru
theory is that the,

2191
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:17,060
it comes in between Mars and
Jupiter every 3,600 years.

2192
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,830
That's the problem is that have depictions

2193
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:23,440
of shit that happened 3,600 years ago.

2194
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,240
It's not that reliable,

2195
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,320
but you're talking,

2196
01:02:26,321 --> 01:02:27,370
you would have to go,

2197
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,010
you would have to go to like 1000 BC.

2198
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:34,450
I think that if a planet
came around and fill the sky,

2199
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:37,060
that would probably be a
lot of stories about it.

2200
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,340
And there's no stories about no planet.

2201
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:39,990
Yeah.

2202
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,680
Doesn't mean it didn't
happen and didn't just,

2203
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:41,970
yeah,

2204
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:43,330
walk people up.

2205
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:43,541
Yeah.

2206
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:44,740
Who knows if it happened or not.

2207
01:02:44,741 --> 01:02:45,490
But uh,

2208
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:48,700
to re that reaction like it's so crazy,

2209
01:02:48,701 --> 01:02:52,090
like it's so magical that
there's another planet out there.

2210
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,990
I would think you should be able to
track that thing moving if it was in an

2211
01:02:55,991 --> 01:02:56,890
elliptical orbit.

2212
01:02:56,891 --> 01:02:58,030
If it's that big,

2213
01:02:58,090 --> 01:02:58,240
they,

2214
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,220
she will knows what we're getting.

2215
01:02:59,560 --> 01:02:59,741
Well,

2216
01:02:59,741 --> 01:03:01,390
who knows what Info are getting.

2217
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:01,901
Do you know,

2218
01:03:01,901 --> 01:03:02,380
have you,

2219
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,430
there's a video out right now.

2220
01:03:03,431 --> 01:03:08,431
You know how you hear about all these
different 2012 December 21st theories from

2221
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:12,400
asteroids to earthquakes to solar flares,

2222
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,390
all that dark stuff.

2223
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,560
And then there's people that say,

2224
01:03:14,561 --> 01:03:15,101
oh no,

2225
01:03:15,101 --> 01:03:19,060
it's a spiritual awakening
time and all the mine count.

2226
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:19,780
Or they didn't,

2227
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:22,870
they didn't say anything about
any total destruction or anything.

2228
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:24,130
You hear there's all these theories,

2229
01:03:24,131 --> 01:03:24,580
right?

2230
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:27,070
So there's this one very,

2231
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,630
that was fucking great.

2232
01:03:28,631 --> 01:03:29,980
It's probably all bullshit,

2233
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,060
but it's great,

2234
01:03:31,061 --> 01:03:31,240
dude.

2235
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,920
There's a video on youtube.

2236
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:33,910
This is that.

2237
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:38,910
If you Youtube Mayan
explains December 21st,

2238
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:39,970
2012,

2239
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:43,000
it's a f he looks like a mind
like an Indian dark skin,

2240
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:43,990
long black hair.

2241
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:48,991
He's got his mind little headset on or
as a Bandana on or something like white

2242
01:03:49,721 --> 01:03:51,140
clothes that kind of look like,

2243
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:51,570
like,

2244
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,980
cause that dealt in genres
that mine kind of weird.

2245
01:03:53,981 --> 01:03:54,730
Right?

2246
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:58,270
And he gave a lecture in Santa
Monica and the video is everywhere.

2247
01:03:58,510 --> 01:03:59,770
And uh,

2248
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:00,570
I don't even know.

2249
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,440
I don't know how popular it is.

2250
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,660
It might be nothing now
that I think about it.

2251
01:04:04,661 --> 01:04:05,200
But anyways,

2252
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,160
the video is interesting.

2253
01:04:06,161 --> 01:04:10,750
He gives a lecture on what's
going to happen December 21st,

2254
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:13,180
2012 and he explains the whole
Mayan Pyramids and everything.

2255
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:13,710
They should make

2256
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:16,660
that guy put all the money that he
gets from that lecture in a Bach.

2257
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:17,870
Okay?

2258
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:20,490
And if 2000 and listen
to the story as well.

2259
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,910
December 23rd rolls around,

2260
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:24,450
give you a 24 hour grace period.

2261
01:04:24,451 --> 01:04:25,284
Nothing happened.

2262
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:25,930
Okay?

2263
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:26,980
We plan to take that money.

2264
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:27,280
Oh No,

2265
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:27,641
this is,

2266
01:04:27,641 --> 01:04:28,720
this is what he says happens.

2267
01:04:28,721 --> 01:04:29,680
This is what he says happens.

2268
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:31,870
He comes out and he says,

2269
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,153
first of all,

2270
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:35,250
is this the guy?

2271
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:35,860
Yeah.

2272
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:36,693
I don't know.

2273
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,260
Men's side of the day

2274
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:44,100
to all my brother's son,

2275
01:04:44,101 --> 01:04:46,360
he used to listen to this message.

2276
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,350
It's a Mayan explains.

2277
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:52,190
This is probably just hustling.

2278
01:04:52,191 --> 01:04:53,390
Why is it so interesting?

2279
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:53,940
No,

2280
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:55,270
the story out here,

2281
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,570
right here and his story is bad.

2282
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:58,270
This one,

2283
01:04:58,270 --> 01:04:59,570
the story is bad ass

2284
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:01,950
get right.

2285
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:02,930
That one right there,

2286
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:03,813
that guy,

2287
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:09,413
what is it?

2288
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:12,900
Are you actually going to hear it in post?

2289
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:15,400
So now in these times

2290
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:18,150
there's

2291
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:23,150
something that really bothers me
[inaudible] and it has to do with the

2292
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:26,263
alignment.

2293
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:29,480
The planetary alignment that's going to
happen on the 21st of December of this

2294
01:05:29,481 --> 01:05:29,920
year.

2295
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,860
Are you in grand experimenters
in difficult by you want a cow?

2296
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:36,550
There's a great experiment that is
going to be a fulfilled on that day.

2297
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:41,850
[inaudible] and this experiment
and uses the particle accelerators.

2298
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:47,650
[inaudible] scientists are
looking for the anti matter.

2299
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,200
Those are scaling up.

2300
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:54,200
Roy [inaudible] and so they want
to use this planetary alignment

2301
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:58,570
degenerate.

2302
01:05:58,570 --> 01:05:59,800
A very high vibration.

2303
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:02,800
There's an experimental
Cassie Gamma Proton Proton.

2304
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:03,760
Proton.

2305
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,593
Proton.

2306
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:06,150
Okay.

2307
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:08,040
It's called the Proton Proton

2308
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:12,610
[inaudible].

2309
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:15,740
It's a proton is generated
with very large mat machines.

2310
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,300
It's on both parts.

2311
01:06:17,301 --> 01:06:22,301
The colors can Kathy [inaudible]
and they're two particles that Jen,

2312
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:23,803
um,

2313
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:25,540
revolve in opposite directions.

2314
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:25,991
All right,

2315
01:06:25,991 --> 01:06:26,824
stop.

2316
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:28,330
Stop now.

2317
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:28,541
Okay.

2318
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:29,260
This is what it was.

2319
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,150
I was going to really listen to him.

2320
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:35,920
He's full of Shit and he has a sleeveless
shirt on because of two things I don't

2321
01:06:35,921 --> 01:06:36,190
like.

2322
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:36,341
No,

2323
01:06:36,341 --> 01:06:37,174
but this is what he says.

2324
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:39,240
He says what's happening on 2012.

2325
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,180
You don't want to know why sucks.

2326
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:44,043
These guys guys,

2327
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:45,310
just a bullshit artist.

2328
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:45,970
Okay.

2329
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:46,480
Okay.

2330
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,020
I'm not saying,

2331
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,460
I'm just saying it's a cool story.

2332
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:48,671
Oh,

2333
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,400
okay.

2334
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,830
Let's just keep it going then.

2335
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,213
I forget it.

2336
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:53,380
Forget it.

2337
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:57,700
Well he's just some crazy guy with
a fucking bullshit story toad.

2338
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:00,640
But those guys are annoying to him.

2339
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:01,520
But I love chocolate broken

2340
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:02,640
when they come together,

2341
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:09,270
when they collide they let go and
they release all of these protons.

2342
01:07:09,271 --> 01:07:11,340
What I mean fuck though for the impact

2343
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:17,930
and these protons [inaudible] they
stimulate another round and the machine,

2344
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:22,620
you work there on the theater
and they hit the earth

2345
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:29,160
and when they hit the earth [inaudible]
they create a chain reaction,

2346
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:32,570
say protons and Directional Madman.

2347
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:36,960
They create a reaction towards
the direction of the magma.

2348
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:40,890
Joke on those proton is the nine my hits,

2349
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:45,920
the protons disparate Alison a theater
and it shoots out to the exterior of the

2350
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:51,681
earth when the those and so when they
are released roping open couple of sick

2351
01:07:51,811 --> 01:07:54,390
Tony because they break
the tectonic plates,

2352
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,550
I say cause they're [inaudible]

2353
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:01,440
so they ignite the methane gas.

2354
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:05,730
You've got silent era and
then gas escapes in the earth.

2355
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:08,890
[inaudible]

2356
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:14,010
and one moment of that friction
and he has a insane yet the um,

2357
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:16,790
the methane catches on fire,

2358
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:22,120
see Stereo and Munich Re is released
into the just talking about what happened

2359
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:25,040
and then the large Hadron collider

2360
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,340
experiments 2012 fire.

2361
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:29,930
Yeah,

2362
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:30,950
I understand what he's saying.

2363
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,130
He's just stupid that he is the boss case.

2364
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:39,030
And so that's how hundreds of hectares
of of forests are burned as like a woman

2365
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:42,360
miss and to wall off about
a month ago that you would,

2366
01:08:42,361 --> 01:08:43,280
I'm not sure you can stop.

2367
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:44,143
You could stop.

2368
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:46,880
How did you ever get this far?

2369
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:50,120
How did you ever get too
far and then repeat it,

2370
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:53,390
bring it to us and with will
Ferrell doing in it is that welfare?

2371
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,450
Yeah.

2372
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:58,670
What he's saying is really exciting for,

2373
01:08:58,710 --> 01:08:59,820
for uh,

2374
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:00,630
um,

2375
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:01,463
between,

2376
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,090
during the galactic alignment.

2377
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:08,120
The reason he's explained this part
does the particle collider is that on,

2378
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:11,630
they're going to do that on the 2000,

2379
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,750
the 21st,

2380
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:15,360
right when the sun is in the,

2381
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:15,931
you know,

2382
01:09:15,931 --> 01:09:19,500
when it passes through the center of
the galaxy quest for eight minutes.

2383
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,480
This is what he says for eight minutes,

2384
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:22,381
that this is what,

2385
01:09:22,381 --> 01:09:23,910
why I'm great minutes.

2386
01:09:23,911 --> 01:09:28,050
We're going to be hit with like
energy from the center of the galaxy.

2387
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:29,700
That where we feel enlightened,

2388
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:30,560
like in a dream.

2389
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,590
Did you know that Neil degrasse Tyson
says that that alignment happens all the

2390
01:09:33,591 --> 01:09:34,940
time and it's total bullshit.

2391
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:36,590
I never knew that.

2392
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,071
Yeah,

2393
01:09:37,071 --> 01:09:38,150
he's an astronomer.

2394
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,800
I would go with him and what does he,

2395
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:41,840
he does,

2396
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,860
he says it's bullshit.

2397
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:43,551
He says that a,

2398
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,110
that alignment happens all the time.

2399
01:09:45,111 --> 01:09:47,240
And then these people that are
talking about this alignment,

2400
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:48,320
they're not astronomers.

2401
01:09:48,321 --> 01:09:49,430
They really don't know
what they're saying.

2402
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,120
That it's,

2403
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,950
it doesn't happen every 26,000 years,

2404
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:55,430
not according to Neil degrasse Tyson
and he's a fucking brilliant man.

2405
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,870
He says that that every,

2406
01:09:56,871 --> 01:09:58,800
that 26,000 year cycle is bullshit.

2407
01:09:58,801 --> 01:09:59,530
Nonsense.

2408
01:09:59,530 --> 01:09:59,780
Yeah.

2409
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:00,840
He says it happens all the time.

2410
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:01,130
Well,

2411
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:04,100
the procession of Equinox
is a 26,000 year cycle.

2412
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:05,690
You're talking about a
completely different thing.

2413
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,230
The procession of the equinox is the
wobble of the earth and that is a hundred

2414
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,060
that there's 26,000 years,

2415
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:12,010
that's for sure

2416
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:12,843
proven.

2417
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,730
I thought that here's
the center of the galaxy,

2418
01:10:15,731 --> 01:10:17,680
like a disk and our son,

2419
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:23,050
it takes 26 it rotates like this around
it like that and it takes 26,000 years

2420
01:10:23,771 --> 01:10:27,460
to make that loop and then it goes through
the center and then it goes this way

2421
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:29,860
down upward and then it
goes through the center.

2422
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:30,940
That's what I read,

2423
01:10:30,941 --> 01:10:32,110
but I could be totally wrong.

2424
01:10:32,111 --> 01:10:32,261
I don't,

2425
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,430
I don't even know what that means.

2426
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:34,730
I'm not really sure I know what that,

2427
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:35,081
you know what I mean?

2428
01:10:35,081 --> 01:10:36,370
Like the the the center of the galaxy.

2429
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,330
The galaxy is a disk.

2430
01:10:37,331 --> 01:10:38,830
You were doing shit with your hands,

2431
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:40,570
but you know what I'm talking about.

2432
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,350
Hey Dude,

2433
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:42,280
this is not a good place.

2434
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,360
Confusing the shit out of me.

2435
01:10:43,361 --> 01:10:44,111
I'm looking over my shoulder,

2436
01:10:44,111 --> 01:10:44,944
I'm seeing people.

2437
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:47,913
MMM.

2438
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:48,591
Yeah.

2439
01:10:48,591 --> 01:10:49,010
I don't know.

2440
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:50,780
I don't know if it doesn't work that way.

2441
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:52,130
I Dunno.

2442
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:53,120
That's what I read.

2443
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:53,811
That's what,

2444
01:10:53,811 --> 01:10:54,644
uh,

2445
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:55,250
or,

2446
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,450
or saw on the Internet.

2447
01:10:58,090 --> 01:10:59,060
See that's the problem.

2448
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,240
You know what I'm Neil degrasse
Tyson says nothing's going to happen.

2449
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,020
So is it that,

2450
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:05,810
that connection that's like
that Shit's there all the time.

2451
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:07,383
Hmm.

2452
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,840
So the sun passes through the center
of the galaxy all the time apparently.

2453
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:12,541
Is that what he's saying?

2454
01:11:12,541 --> 01:11:14,010
We proudly the position that's going

2455
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:14,221
to be,

2456
01:11:14,221 --> 01:11:15,054
and he said it's,

2457
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,230
it's happened many times.

2458
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:17,490
Hmm.

2459
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:18,323
That's what he says.

2460
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,960
These motherfuckers working on the
large Hadron collider though they are

2461
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:22,794
unchecked,

2462
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:23,371
unchecked,

2463
01:11:23,371 --> 01:11:24,690
crazy super geniuses.

2464
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:25,471
You know.

2465
01:11:25,471 --> 01:11:26,160
I mean,

2466
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,480
I'm not saying that we should,

2467
01:11:27,481 --> 01:11:27,750
uh,

2468
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:31,800
stop the program that I am saying that
there's a far to people that aren't

2469
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:35,760
concerned about the possibilities of
what all the crazy shit they're doing.

2470
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:36,181
They're making,

2471
01:11:36,181 --> 01:11:36,450
they're,

2472
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:39,000
they're absolutely making
little black holes.

2473
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:40,013
Absolutely.

2474
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:44,340
When you create that Higgs Boson particle
cause he's microscopic black holes

2475
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:46,800
that are made that they don't
have enough gravity to stay,

2476
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:47,220
uh,

2477
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:47,941
stay active.

2478
01:11:47,941 --> 01:11:49,230
So they disappear really quickly.

2479
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,360
But what the fuck?

2480
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:52,161
Like what,

2481
01:11:52,161 --> 01:11:57,161
what kind of a crazy ass hole uses a
machine with the possibility of making a

2482
01:11:57,811 --> 01:12:00,360
black hole because what's going to
happen next and they're going to be happy

2483
01:12:00,361 --> 01:12:02,130
with these results and just stop there.

2484
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:07,280
What if there's like more spectacular
energy that can be created but there's a

2485
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:11,500
smaller chance the black
holes sticks around a while?

2486
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:12,571
Well they're going to go,

2487
01:12:12,571 --> 01:12:13,860
of course they're going to go for that.

2488
01:12:13,861 --> 01:12:15,000
They're going to keep doing it.

2489
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:19,890
They're gonna keep doing it because people
are fucking infatuated with figuring

2490
01:12:19,891 --> 01:12:24,510
out how shit works and they're going to
things like the large Hadron collider.

2491
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:24,871
It just,

2492
01:12:24,871 --> 01:12:29,871
it's just one step and a never ending
process until they get to technology that

2493
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,650
could end the universe
instantly all at once.

2494
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:35,460
That's like,

2495
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:38,220
it's almost inevitable if you
think about what they're doing now.

2496
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:40,580
Large Hadron collider is a courageous.

2497
01:12:40,581 --> 01:12:41,414
The idea,

2498
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,380
they are finding the,

2499
01:12:43,381 --> 01:12:45,450
they're recreating the conditions.

2500
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:49,750
Millie millions of a second after the the,

2501
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:51,180
the universe was created.

2502
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,940
That's what they're doing by
smashing those atoms together.

2503
01:12:53,941 --> 01:12:55,620
They're recreating this particle way.

2504
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:56,940
They figured that out to build.

2505
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:58,590
Is it like 17 miles?

2506
01:12:58,591 --> 01:12:59,424
Like and,

2507
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:01,460
and I'm the circle like that.

2508
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:04,260
I think it's 22 I think it's 22 miles.

2509
01:13:04,261 --> 01:13:05,430
It might be 22 kilometers,

2510
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,390
whatever the fuck it is.

2511
01:13:06,391 --> 01:13:08,910
And they saw and they smashed
these Adam's together.

2512
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:09,680
But it's,

2513
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:09,950
it's,

2514
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:10,710
it's crazy.

2515
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:12,810
They think not only
did they figure it out,

2516
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,370
they've explained it,

2517
01:13:14,371 --> 01:13:17,190
got funding and then they're
out there and doing it.

2518
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:18,360
That is some,

2519
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,081
that is alien,

2520
01:13:19,081 --> 01:13:19,291
right?

2521
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:20,100
They're not us.

2522
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:20,580
Those who,

2523
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:22,170
I don't know any other
people that can do that.

2524
01:13:22,171 --> 01:13:23,280
And how the fuck did they do that?

2525
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,473
Those are aliens.

2526
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:25,200
I mean it's,

2527
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,990
it's like it's a circle,

2528
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:32,730
like a tube in a circle
and they run particles like
simultaneously and then they

2529
01:13:32,731 --> 01:13:33,570
run into each other.

2530
01:13:33,571 --> 01:13:34,770
So I don't understand it.

2531
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:35,750
I'm not swollen.

2532
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,110
Then when they collide,

2533
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:42,710
the explosion that they're taking
snapshots of the explosion to see what the

2534
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:44,610
hell is going on.

2535
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:47,190
They're trying to find the God particle.

2536
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:49,590
They believe they've isolated that.

2537
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:54,720
And there's also something called cork
glue on plasma that that's another thing

2538
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:55,471
that they've created.

2539
01:13:55,471 --> 01:13:58,860
They've created a new kind of
matter that didn't exist before,

2540
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:00,600
that did to do a lot of freaky shit.

2541
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,460
This cork gluon plasma.

2542
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:04,590
I think if you made,

2543
01:14:04,591 --> 01:14:09,591
I think the dimensions are a sugar
cube would weigh 40 million pounds.

2544
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:12,110
It might be billion.

2545
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:12,771
Let me see.

2546
01:14:12,771 --> 01:14:13,250
Cork.

2547
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:16,280
I gotta I gotta pull that
up cause it's fucking crazy.

2548
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:21,430
When I read the quote glue on Plasma,

2549
01:14:21,441 --> 01:14:21,710
wait,

2550
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:23,030
when I read the quote I was like,

2551
01:14:23,031 --> 01:14:24,890
what the fuck are they doing?

2552
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:28,880
They're making some shit that
it's just like infinitely heavy.

2553
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:32,770
And uh,

2554
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,900
this is something that it was a,

2555
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:37,770
I believe this was all
basically they were,

2556
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,720
this is all theoretical
until really recently.

2557
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,760
I know that the um,

2558
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:43,990
they,

2559
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:44,950
oh my God,

2560
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,353
okay.

2561
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:48,021
They,

2562
01:14:48,021 --> 01:14:52,970
the court glow on plasma has
an approximate temperature
of 4 trillion degrees

2563
01:14:52,971 --> 01:14:53,810
Celsius.

2564
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:55,060
Okay.

2565
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,860
Holy Shit.

2566
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,460
4 trillion degrees.

2567
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:04,750
This is weird shit to like,

2568
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:09,010
to reality and to matter that they're
starting to figure out like things like

2569
01:15:09,011 --> 01:15:09,281
this.

2570
01:15:09,281 --> 01:15:12,160
Like this court glue on plasma and uh,

2571
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:13,750
the Higgs Boson and,

2572
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:16,660
and whatever this new matter
thing that they figured out,

2573
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:18,910
they figured out some new kind
of matter that they've created.

2574
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:20,530
Like all of this is like very,

2575
01:15:20,531 --> 01:15:21,011
very,

2576
01:15:21,011 --> 01:15:22,060
very strange.

2577
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:27,120
Isn't it crazy getting most of our info
from Twitter feeds out to hunting the

2578
01:15:27,281 --> 01:15:27,791
latest,

2579
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:29,320
coolest info down and,

2580
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:31,200
and they just tweeted the boom.

2581
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,240
You see it on Twitter or family matters.

2582
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:34,493
Yeah.

2583
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:35,830
That's good.

2584
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:36,663
Sure.

2585
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:38,363
What are you talking about?

2586
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:39,760
You were talking about
matters weren't too,

2587
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:40,963
oh

2588
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:43,560
how dare you.

2589
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,950
How dare you Brian.

2590
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,500
You need to go to a doctor.

2591
01:15:51,501 --> 01:15:52,700
I told you this many times.

2592
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:56,300
What were we talking about before that?

2593
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:58,090
Before he came into march to hell.

2594
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,000
Join Collider.

2595
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:03,250
Why do you think that's funny?

2596
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:04,530
That's funny.

2597
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:06,050
Just like that.

2598
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:07,030
I know it's impossible.

2599
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:07,240
What?

2600
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,080
Move away from that one.

2601
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:11,850
Don't worry about it.

2602
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:12,330
The um,

2603
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:12,650
the,

2604
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:14,620
the network that we have
though with Twitter,

2605
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:16,570
all the people sending you shit,

2606
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:18,940
it's really an incredible thing
that never existed before.

2607
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:22,990
The idea that people all around
the world find cool shit.

2608
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:25,540
They sent it to you cause they know
you're retweet it if you find cool shit.

2609
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,400
And they just keep doing that.

2610
01:16:27,401 --> 01:16:30,000
So you're constantly every
day getting new clothes.

2611
01:16:30,001 --> 01:16:30,480
Shit,

2612
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,390
the latest cool shit.

2613
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,740
You know what's annoying though man?

2614
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:34,480
The occasional parody site.

2615
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:37,360
Fuck you fake news.

2616
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:38,380
Fuck you.

2617
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:40,660
You're fucking boring ass fake news.

2618
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:41,920
That shit's boring.

2619
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:43,570
I don't like any of it.

2620
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:46,030
I think the onion does it really
well and the onion does it.

2621
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:46,781
They do.

2622
01:16:46,781 --> 01:16:47,411
And by the way,

2623
01:16:47,411 --> 01:16:48,040
it's the onion.

2624
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:48,701
You go to the onion,

2625
01:16:48,701 --> 01:16:49,780
you know what the fuck the onion is?

2626
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:49,990
Yeah.

2627
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:53,080
There's all these fake onions that are
coming along and they'll make these fake

2628
01:16:53,081 --> 01:16:55,210
stories and occasionally a rope you in.

2629
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:55,901
And someone was like,

2630
01:16:55,901 --> 01:16:56,111
dude,

2631
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:56,831
it's a parody site.

2632
01:16:56,831 --> 01:16:57,651
Like it's on pace.

2633
01:16:57,651 --> 01:17:00,490
I love what the fuck kind of
parody is that where you just lied?

2634
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,030
What are that the,

2635
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,090
when you lie it's just a lie.

2636
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:05,180
It's just a fake fuck it.

2637
01:17:05,181 --> 01:17:05,800
It's not,

2638
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,650
it's not even remotely
weird enough to be fake.

2639
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,010
You should check out the young Turks

2640
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,430
have you have,

2641
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:12,850
and we had the cohost
on today on the podcast.

2642
01:17:12,851 --> 01:17:14,360
And then I think you'd
really like her lunch.

2643
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:15,350
Yeah,

2644
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:16,160
she's great.

2645
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:16,391
Yeah.

2646
01:17:16,391 --> 01:17:16,760
What?

2647
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,900
We talked about it yesterday.

2648
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:19,240
Um,

2649
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,450
I talked about it with um,

2650
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:21,550
machine Smith the other day too.

2651
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:21,990
Yeah.

2652
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:22,850
What happened with her?

2653
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:23,850
I did.

2654
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:25,760
Did you know that that's the
number one news right now.

2655
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:26,570
Her channel,

2656
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:28,370
her channel is the number one online news.

2657
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,181
That makes sense.

2658
01:17:29,181 --> 01:17:30,014
Isn't that crazy?

2659
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:30,863
Makes Sense.

2660
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:33,290
People don't want to
watch CNN online anymore.

2661
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,450
They did another getting
bullshitted and then by the way,

2662
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:37,970
they also know they're going to have to
sit through these fucking commercials

2663
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:39,830
every time it jumps to a new story.

2664
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:41,210
You ever go to cnn.com?

2665
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:41,630
Yeah.

2666
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:42,950
Great source of information.

2667
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:45,800
But it makes you want to put your fucking
head through a wall when you start

2668
01:17:45,801 --> 01:17:48,440
listening to their videos
because if you watch their video,

2669
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,360
every fucking video,

2670
01:17:50,361 --> 01:17:52,670
you have to watch a 32nd commercial.

2671
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:55,160
So it's over and over and over again.

2672
01:17:55,161 --> 01:17:57,410
And usually it's the
same God damn commercial.

2673
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,360
So over and over and over again,

2674
01:17:59,361 --> 01:18:02,930
you're listening to this stupid nonsense
about detergent or whatever the fuck it

2675
01:18:02,931 --> 01:18:03,320
is.

2676
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,250
And you get to the point where like,

2677
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:05,263
this is crazy.

2678
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:06,740
Play me 10 in a row.

2679
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:07,131
Okay,

2680
01:18:07,131 --> 01:18:08,270
play me three in a row.

2681
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:11,690
You can't have a fucking commercial
after each God damn video.

2682
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,580
So that's how the young Turks,

2683
01:18:13,581 --> 01:18:16,250
they just sneak in steel CNNs thunder.

2684
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:19,420
She says he'll come on the
podcast if we ever liner.

2685
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:19,810
Okay.

2686
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:20,530
That'd be just fine.

2687
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:21,221
She was fine.

2688
01:18:21,221 --> 01:18:21,821
I think you'd like her.

2689
01:18:21,821 --> 01:18:22,840
She's very intelligent.

2690
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:23,590
It's cool.

2691
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:24,423
Pretty cool.

2692
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:25,060
Smartsheet.

2693
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:25,391
Yeah.

2694
01:18:25,391 --> 01:18:27,670
I wonder how much the CIA
has been following her.

2695
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,510
If you tell him some real
news on the Internet,

2696
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:32,860
who act like one of those people?

2697
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:33,161
No,

2698
01:18:33,161 --> 01:18:33,994
this is a different one.

2699
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:34,761
Eddie,

2700
01:18:34,761 --> 01:18:37,190
have you ever been to a
dance club where they uh,

2701
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:41,060
like somebody has like this little
glowy pins that attached to their,

2702
01:18:41,061 --> 01:18:41,690
uh,

2703
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:42,500
their fingers?

2704
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,333
Have you seen those?

2705
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:44,253
They're like,

2706
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:45,890
they're like glow sticks
that attached to your,

2707
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,000
your fingers.

2708
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:47,960
I don't know.

2709
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:49,850
I haven't been to a club in a long time.

2710
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:50,841
It's so funny.

2711
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:53,870
I saw a guy the other day in San Diego
and he had these like little things that

2712
01:18:53,871 --> 01:18:55,360
you attached to your fingers that,

2713
01:18:55,361 --> 01:18:56,450
that are like glow sticks,

2714
01:18:56,451 --> 01:18:58,310
but you go like this and
they flash around like,

2715
01:18:58,311 --> 01:19:00,950
I guess it's like are a rave
thing now that a popular,

2716
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:04,910
but it was hilarious watching him dance
with that shit too lazy for glow sticks.

2717
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:05,571
Like,

2718
01:19:05,571 --> 01:19:06,410
you know what man?

2719
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,100
I'm like,

2720
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,890
I like glow sticks but I
don't want to carry things.

2721
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:13,490
Can you make them stick to my fingers so
I could just move my fingers right now?

2722
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:14,420
It's so weird.

2723
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:15,080
It's,

2724
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:15,890
it's the gay,

2725
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,150
the gay is with an age thing.

2726
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:19,700
You will ever see somebody dance
around with those things on his finger.

2727
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:20,241
Look,

2728
01:19:20,241 --> 01:19:21,020
I've seen Saturday,

2729
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:21,620
dude,

2730
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:22,880
I've seen a lot of sad shit.

2731
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:27,290
At least glowsticks kind of look
cool in your high something to them.

2732
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:32,540
It's funny how one sort of a
thing got attached to one drug,

2733
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:33,290
you know,

2734
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:35,000
ecstasy and glow sticks.

2735
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:36,110
You know,

2736
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:36,980
it's kind of interesting.

2737
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:37,461
Well,

2738
01:19:37,461 --> 01:19:40,040
when young ecstasy
lights are way brighter.

2739
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:41,320
So yeah.

2740
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:42,941
Well,

2741
01:19:42,941 --> 01:19:44,500
and also it's like hypnotic.

2742
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,570
When you see it like trailing in the air,

2743
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:47,111
you know,

2744
01:19:47,111 --> 01:19:50,630
there's like a certain trail
quality to those glow sticks.

2745
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:52,321
Here's a,

2746
01:19:52,321 --> 01:19:53,130
here's a guy who got,

2747
01:19:53,130 --> 01:19:55,620
if you're looking at the video or
you don't have video over there,

2748
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,593
that sucks,

2749
01:19:56,730 --> 01:19:57,720
just play it in the,

2750
01:19:57,721 --> 01:19:57,901
uh,

2751
01:19:57,901 --> 01:19:58,470
the,

2752
01:19:58,470 --> 01:19:59,303
the thing,

2753
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,580
what am I looking at here?

2754
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,940
That he has him on these like little
things and so you see these guys dancing

2755
01:20:05,941 --> 01:20:06,774
around.

2756
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:08,250
Oh

2757
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,061
my God,

2758
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:11,280
it's the most ridiculous thing ever.

2759
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,390
I don't know if they're saying south.

2760
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,333
Yeah,

2761
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:18,360
but like this was like,

2762
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:20,370
I saw all these people
in San Diego have them.

2763
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,820
They got me and Doug Benson were at a
dance club and saw it like a guy doing

2764
01:20:23,821 --> 01:20:24,301
this shit.

2765
01:20:24,301 --> 01:20:25,134
And it's just like,

2766
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,280
is that the new thing?

2767
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:28,740
I feel like an old man.

2768
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,300
I would say it's definitely
not the new thing.

2769
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:31,591
I do not see that.

2770
01:20:31,591 --> 01:20:32,424
Catch you.

2771
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:34,770
It was funny watching people dance it.

2772
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:36,590
I didn't even know it existed.

2773
01:20:36,591 --> 01:20:37,310
Man.

2774
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:38,143
What'd you ever do that again?

2775
01:20:38,650 --> 01:20:38,840
Uh,

2776
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:39,111
yeah,

2777
01:20:39,111 --> 01:20:39,770
sure.

2778
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:40,603
It's a movement.

2779
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:41,943
Even in Austin.

2780
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,160
If the rhythm gets me,

2781
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:46,890
I might go and put on some
fucking low stick thing,

2782
01:20:46,891 --> 01:20:48,800
ease and dance like a motherfucker.

2783
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:53,210
Have you guys heard about this lawsuit
whether is a pill that this dude took

2784
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:57,710
that turned him into a
gay sex and gambling act?

2785
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:01,280
The court has upheld this ruling.

2786
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:02,143
Okay.

2787
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:06,890
The a ruling against the
pharmaceutical giant Glasko Smith.

2788
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:11,920
They had to pay 197,000 euros to a man
who claimed that the drug used to treat

2789
01:21:13,521 --> 01:21:14,660
his Parkinson's,

2790
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:19,900
turned him into a gay
sex and gambling addict.

2791
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,070
What?

2792
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:21,770
Yeah.

2793
01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:22,940
What's the translation and money?

2794
01:21:22,941 --> 01:21:24,520
Was that 10 bucks that they had to pay?

2795
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:25,150
Oh,

2796
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:25,983
I didn't do it.

2797
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:28,060
$51,000

2798
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:34,030
they paid him $151,000
how's that possible?

2799
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:35,171
I don't know,

2800
01:21:35,171 --> 01:21:35,890
man.

2801
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:37,810
I don't know what the fuck happened.

2802
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:42,460
So the guy said the drug made him addicted
to internet gambling and caused him

2803
01:21:42,461 --> 01:21:47,461
to lose the family savings and steal
to feed the habit that cost him 82,000

2804
01:21:48,641 --> 01:21:49,474
euros.

2805
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:54,760
Then he said he attempted suicide eight
ten eight times and became a compulsive

2806
01:21:54,761 --> 01:21:59,761
gay sex addict exposing himself on the
Internet and cross dressing is risky.

2807
01:22:00,401 --> 01:22:03,010
Sexual encounters led to him being raped.

2808
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:07,570
All that stopped when
he ceased taking Requip.

2809
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:09,370
This is the stuff called Rep quip,

2810
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:09,761
right?

2811
01:22:09,761 --> 01:22:14,350
Quip Rec clip has been known for
years to have undesired side effects,

2812
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,940
but a warning only appeared on its
package insert in 2006 the Lord said,

2813
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:19,571
who is,

2814
01:22:19,571 --> 01:22:24,040
so this was in 2003 this guy was taking
this stuff before the company admitted

2815
01:22:24,041 --> 01:22:27,310
that there's some horrific side
effects with certain peeves,

2816
01:22:27,311 --> 01:22:28,230
engage juice in there.

2817
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:28,960
So well,

2818
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:29,793
it's funny man.

2819
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:31,390
People are a series of,

2820
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:32,940
you know like the way your,

2821
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:34,540
your whole system works as he,

2822
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:39,550
there's a series of chemicals that
interact with the body and everybody has a

2823
01:22:39,551 --> 01:22:43,150
different set up and we all
know people who can't drink.

2824
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:45,970
We all know people you ever met
anybody who can't eat peanuts.

2825
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:46,541
This they,

2826
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:48,640
those mother fuckers get
nervous around peanuts.

2827
01:22:48,641 --> 01:22:49,630
Like they can't eat peanuts.

2828
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:49,821
Third,

2829
01:22:49,821 --> 01:22:50,980
their throat would close up.

2830
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:53,620
There's some people that like normal shit,

2831
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:54,700
they're allergic to something.

2832
01:22:54,701 --> 01:22:56,050
A lot of people are alerted to wheat.

2833
01:22:56,051 --> 01:22:59,440
It turns out there's a lot of
gluten out so the body's weird,

2834
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:04,330
but I've never heard of something
turning into a gay sex addict who was the

2835
01:23:04,331 --> 01:23:07,780
lawyer or the pharmaceutical company and
like Earl shy or something like that.

2836
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,000
Maybe this guy is just a really good liar.

2837
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:13,150
Doesn't like to see his testimony please.

2838
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:15,580
If they paid,

2839
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,110
doesn't that kind of mean that?

2840
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:17,691
Yeah,

2841
01:23:17,691 --> 01:23:18,530
it actually works.

2842
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:23,410
What means they were able to prove
to the jury and what does that mean?

2843
01:23:23,411 --> 01:23:27,610
I mean the jury's generally
try to side with people.

2844
01:23:27,611 --> 01:23:28,910
I think when they would check,

2845
01:23:28,911 --> 01:23:31,850
can't pharmaceutical companies
so the guy could just have it.

2846
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:33,820
He could've got caught on this,

2847
01:23:33,821 --> 01:23:38,821
just mad fucking gay sex and gambling
binge and his wife found out and she's

2848
01:23:39,611 --> 01:23:39,851
like,

2849
01:23:39,851 --> 01:23:41,320
if you don't seek help,

2850
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:45,680
but they over and they cited
something on in 2006 they out.

2851
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:46,930
They admitted the side effects,

2852
01:23:46,931 --> 01:23:47,800
but that actually,

2853
01:23:47,801 --> 01:23:48,371
I have to admit,

2854
01:23:48,371 --> 01:23:49,204
don't they?

2855
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:50,800
The actual side effects that happened.

2856
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:51,311
Well,

2857
01:23:51,311 --> 01:23:55,870
I would assume it's not gay sex addict
because that shit would have been out by

2858
01:23:55,871 --> 01:23:56,260
now.

2859
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:59,290
I would imagine that there's a lot
of people that take this Parkinson's

2860
01:23:59,291 --> 01:23:59,861
medication.

2861
01:23:59,861 --> 01:24:02,570
If they all became crazy gay sex addict,

2862
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:03,404
I just want to try it.

2863
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,410
That would be like a gay sex Voodoo drug.

2864
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:09,610
Could you imagine if you took some
shit and it made you a gay sex addict?

2865
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:10,390
Like if it was,

2866
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:14,620
if this human sexuality was that
manipulate manipulatable manipulable,

2867
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:19,240
if it was at that age you to manipulate
where someone can actually add something

2868
01:24:19,241 --> 01:24:22,620
to your system and we'll
turn you into a sex addict,

2869
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:22,990
man,

2870
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:25,030
that'd be so many gay dudes doing that.

2871
01:24:25,031 --> 01:24:25,810
Two straight guys.

2872
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:29,080
What's funny is the CIA
tried to do that in Iraq.

2873
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,420
They were trying to create a gay bomb.

2874
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:33,010
This is a true story.

2875
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:33,610
They were,

2876
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:37,750
they were trying to find out if it was
possible to make something that could

2877
01:24:37,751 --> 01:24:39,340
blow up over the city.

2878
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:44,020
It would rain down on these people and
they would all fall in love with men and

2879
01:24:44,021 --> 01:24:46,840
it would kill their morale and they
wouldn't want to fight anymore.

2880
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,480
And they would be ashamed
and they would like,

2881
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:51,250
they would lose their ambition to fight.

2882
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,250
That's amazing.

2883
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:55,001
Well,

2884
01:24:55,001 --> 01:24:56,260
it's really ridiculous too,

2885
01:24:56,261 --> 01:24:57,094
because the,

2886
01:24:57,130 --> 01:25:02,130
the greatest warriors in the history
of humanity have been gay guys.

2887
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:05,020
There's been a lot of
gay sex and the Romans,

2888
01:25:05,021 --> 01:25:06,970
a lot of gay sex and the Greeks,

2889
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:07,780
I mean,

2890
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:12,780
before North America ever even
was populated with houses,

2891
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,930
these guys were fucking people up with
swords and banging each other in the ass.

2892
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:22,150
So they were the kings back then.

2893
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:27,010
So the idea that you could drop a bomb
on these Iraqis and then all of a sudden,

2894
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:30,190
other's butts acts would
just be going off and no one,

2895
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,800
no one would feel like they
would need to fight back.

2896
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:35,320
But if you turn them into
like some crazy super warrior,

2897
01:25:35,321 --> 01:25:36,580
Greek homo gods,

2898
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:40,450
and they just all started fucking
Americans up because they loved each other

2899
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:43,480
because they're all gay sex in each
other all day and they don't want,

2900
01:25:43,481 --> 01:25:46,420
they fight even harder because they
don't want to lose their boyfriends.

2901
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:47,773
Yeah.

2902
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:49,990
They love going on the road.

2903
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:51,103
You know what I mean?

2904
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:52,170
Like for,

2905
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:53,170
they're like camels.

2906
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:53,860
You don't need it.

2907
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:54,910
They don't need any pussy.

2908
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:57,700
That's a good way looking at it,

2909
01:25:57,701 --> 01:25:58,030
man.

2910
01:25:58,030 --> 01:25:59,260
They could just wander through the woods.

2911
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:00,220
Imagine that Shit.

2912
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:01,053
If they really could.

2913
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:02,800
The CIA really was trying to do that.

2914
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:03,763
The

2915
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,660
CIA gay bomb.

2916
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:07,280
If you just Google that,

2917
01:26:07,281 --> 01:26:08,210
you'll find that study.

2918
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:09,180
It's a,

2919
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:10,040
it's hilarious.

2920
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,080
Probably be best.

2921
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:16,430
Like if you were running shit and Spain
back in the conquistador days to get a

2922
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:18,170
crew of nothing to gay dates,

2923
01:26:18,171 --> 01:26:18,351
right.

2924
01:26:18,351 --> 01:26:21,140
Because then you won't have
to worry about them being,

2925
01:26:21,141 --> 01:26:23,270
I'll starve at the Saxon love,

2926
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,253
I guess.

2927
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:24,591
You know,

2928
01:26:24,591 --> 01:26:24,921
the,

2929
01:26:24,921 --> 01:26:25,610
um,

2930
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:27,230
the other thing they would do is,

2931
01:26:27,231 --> 01:26:27,830
uh,

2932
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:32,830
they would apparently the CIA
would make a fake Islamic gay porn.

2933
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:35,023
They would like.

2934
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:35,721
Yeah,

2935
01:26:35,721 --> 01:26:40,721
they would organize the gay porn and
make it like dudes it speaking Arabic.

2936
01:26:41,391 --> 01:26:41,920
So they fill,

2937
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,171
listen,

2938
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:45,010
he goes to talks from Erin Burg than
you know soccer's deck and he's going to

2939
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:48,920
put in your ass and they would
organize the show themselves.

2940
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:51,350
They would organize the
gay porn shoots themselves.

2941
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:52,790
So then they would say,

2942
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:53,091
oh,

2943
01:26:53,091 --> 01:26:54,770
look at all this Islamic gay porn.

2944
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:59,860
So the CIA was making gay porn in
order to make the other side look bad.

2945
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:05,240
I wonder if there were executive
producing it or if they were like,

2946
01:27:05,241 --> 01:27:06,074
actually

2947
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,780
we're going to have to do this ourselves.

2948
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:10,220
We can't trust actors.

2949
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:11,900
But what if they tell our story

2950
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:16,000
and the government could lose its
battle with the Islamic terrorists.

2951
01:27:16,090 --> 01:27:16,541
So listen,

2952
01:27:16,541 --> 01:27:17,590
you're going to have to suck my dick.

2953
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:22,090
I'm going to have to fuck
you and ridiculous to him.

2954
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:23,360
Good ideas.

2955
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,460
Now I was in the CIA.

2956
01:27:24,461 --> 01:27:24,910
I'd be,

2957
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:25,511
I'll be out for,

2958
01:27:25,511 --> 01:27:26,410
I'd be pushing for that one.

2959
01:27:26,411 --> 01:27:27,340
I'll be voting for that one.

2960
01:27:27,341 --> 01:27:28,174
This would be funny.

2961
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:33,770
Would you want to be in the CIA and
Ma and be in the gay porn division?

2962
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:35,360
What'd you think that would be?

2963
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:37,160
How would you want to one the worst jobs?

2964
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:38,990
I'd want to be in the brainwash division.

2965
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:41,570
Like all the different
ways to brainwash people.

2966
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:42,920
I'd be fascinated with that.

2967
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,880
They really did think that they were
going to be able to do that in the 1990s.

2968
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:47,840
They were uh,

2969
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,340
they spent a lot of money on this man.

2970
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:53,300
The theory was that the bomb would release
a chemical compound that would render

2971
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:57,650
the opposing troops so irresistibly horny
that instead of raising their rifles

2972
01:27:57,651 --> 01:27:58,670
to defend their nations,

2973
01:27:58,671 --> 01:28:03,530
they would turn ravenously gay and raise
something else in [inaudible] and have

2974
01:28:03,531 --> 01:28:05,090
passionate sex with each other.

2975
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,710
Did it sounds like they figured it out.

2976
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:08,143
Wow.

2977
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,100
And as an added bonus,

2978
01:28:10,101 --> 01:28:11,920
the burst of gay sex would leave.

2979
01:28:11,921 --> 01:28:12,040
Yeah.

2980
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,740
The enemy troops in
masculinity with shame.

2981
01:28:15,370 --> 01:28:19,600
How many dudes like play tricks and
pranks on their friends to slip some gay

2982
01:28:19,601 --> 01:28:21,140
drugs and drink?

2983
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:23,770
That would be like so common.

2984
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:28,660
You're a teacher and then have gay sex
with your teacher would if they really

2985
01:28:28,661 --> 01:28:29,460
liked it.

2986
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:30,160
What if the,

2987
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:32,400
like when they got on the
gauge rog and it was like,

2988
01:28:32,401 --> 01:28:32,760
wait,

2989
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:33,211
like look,

2990
01:28:33,211 --> 01:28:34,710
I thought it was straight until today,

2991
01:28:34,770 --> 01:28:36,750
but like the gay life is for me,

2992
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:37,471
I just need,

2993
01:28:37,471 --> 01:28:38,310
it's way more fun.

2994
01:28:38,311 --> 01:28:41,370
I just need to take these gay drug
like once every couple of days.

2995
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:43,240
Give me a dose of hyper.

2996
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:44,360
I feel loved.

2997
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,940
Like they go to clubs and all of a
sudden they can get laid and they feel

2998
01:28:46,941 --> 01:28:47,720
understood.

2999
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:48,461
Like the Sim man,

3000
01:28:48,461 --> 01:28:49,520
a man understands a man.

3001
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:53,960
Women pretend to understand men just to
keep you around and sort of stare at you

3002
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:55,220
and shake their head at
you every now and then.

3003
01:28:55,221 --> 01:28:56,060
Cause it disappointed.

3004
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:57,470
But it dude understands it.

3005
01:28:57,471 --> 01:28:58,304
Dude.

3006
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:01,100
The smells of a guy
being gay must be awful.

3007
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:02,210
Being a gay person

3008
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:04,170
in the daily smells you have to deal with.

3009
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:05,600
Well they don't all bumped.

3010
01:29:05,601 --> 01:29:06,300
Fuck.

3011
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,770
A lot of them just blow each other.

3012
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:10,560
So the smells would be pretty similar
to what you're smelling already.

3013
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:10,711
Yeah.

3014
01:29:10,711 --> 01:29:13,200
But when you're spinning up to your
man at night and you just smell it,

3015
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:15,390
but you know it's going
to be worse than a check.

3016
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:16,330
I don't know man.

3017
01:29:16,330 --> 01:29:18,950
Probably like really clean
what it feel like a Vegan.

3018
01:29:18,970 --> 01:29:20,130
I was talking about bears guys know,

3019
01:29:20,131 --> 01:29:20,570
sorry.

3020
01:29:20,570 --> 01:29:22,530
Oh I know you get the clean one.

3021
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:24,630
This is that what you think you would get?

3022
01:29:24,631 --> 01:29:28,590
You'd get like a time sucker or Bert
Kreischer but would you guys be like dual

3023
01:29:28,591 --> 01:29:29,790
bears or would you,

3024
01:29:29,791 --> 01:29:30,510
uh,

3025
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:34,350
would you like battle like those bears
do when those open fields they start

3026
01:29:34,351 --> 01:29:37,110
pulling their hair out or would
you just let them be the top bear?

3027
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:38,453
I don't know.

3028
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:41,850
It's a good question cause bear seem
to always get along for a little while

3029
01:29:41,851 --> 01:29:44,970
until there's some pussy around and then
you see bears going off on each other

3030
01:29:44,971 --> 01:29:46,770
and brawl and in the fields.

3031
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:48,510
So is pussy that brings them to that.

3032
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:49,621
So,

3033
01:29:49,621 --> 01:29:49,831
uh,

3034
01:29:49,831 --> 01:29:51,960
I wonder if there was no pussy involved,

3035
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:53,730
it was just a two dudes.

3036
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:54,773
Would that even,

3037
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:55,860
would that even be an issue?

3038
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:56,580
I don't know.

3039
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:59,680
Maybe gay bears would be cool to
like camp near hybrid net with them.

3040
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:01,590
Hibernate hybrid nut.

3041
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,230
I mean it happened that all over this man.

3042
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,600
If you wanted to have a gay relationship,

3043
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:10,950
would you want a gay relationship
with a bear type gay dude?

3044
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:12,570
A super obvious,

3045
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:17,660
like like a really super femme gay dude
or a dude who looks exactly like a girl

3046
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:21,000
but has it Dick.

3047
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:22,313
Ooh,

3048
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:24,631
because you know,

3049
01:30:24,631 --> 01:30:25,160
yep.

3050
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,130
I don't want to take that
gay drug to give you now.

3051
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:31,290
What'd you take the
gates rather quick show.

3052
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,650
Soon as it kicks in you're like,

3053
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:33,100
oh dude,

3054
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,590
I filling him young Asian boys.

3055
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:36,603
Yeah.

3056
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:39,070
Do that for the podcast.

3057
01:30:39,071 --> 01:30:41,270
We just contain ourselves
inside the room so that we

3058
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:43,720
strapped ourselves up to
make sure extra tight.

3059
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:44,890
Make sure it's tight.

3060
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:45,221
Yeah,

3061
01:30:45,221 --> 01:30:45,700
really,

3062
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:48,580
really buckle down and take
a spoonful of that shit.

3063
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,070
I wouldn't trust Dropbox.

3064
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:53,050
I was just duct tape my
dick and my buddle just,

3065
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:53,830
yeah,

3066
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:55,320
just in case I wouldn't trust you guys.

3067
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,830
I wouldn't trust you at Oh man,

3068
01:30:58,620 --> 01:30:59,010
it kicks.

3069
01:30:59,010 --> 01:31:00,680
You would like to let me out.

3070
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:01,460
Come on.

3071
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:02,293
You can do it.

3072
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:06,350
[inaudible].

3073
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:10,130
He spits out a key out of his mouth.

3074
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:11,920
I said,

3075
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:12,753
where's

3076
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:17,340
catch you with your toes?

3077
01:31:17,530 --> 01:31:20,170
Unlike duct tape,

3078
01:31:20,190 --> 01:31:20,540
I put,

3079
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:21,373
I tried.

3080
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:23,283
That's hilarious.

3081
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:27,450
Houdini style that don't be ridiculous.

3082
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,770
You'd have to see the Dude Mama.

3083
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:32,310
It's like that scene

3084
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:33,000
in a,

3085
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,550
the wolf man when he said that,

3086
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,900
all the scientists are surrounding
him trying to diagnose it.

3087
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:39,620
I don't know if you ever
southern Benicio del Toro,

3088
01:31:39,621 --> 01:31:40,454
Wolf Man,

3089
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:42,560
stupid ass movie,

3090
01:31:42,690 --> 01:31:47,060
but it costs a couple of cool
werewolf scenes and then the straps,

3091
01:31:47,061 --> 01:31:48,590
they thought the straps are
going to hold them down.

3092
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:49,370
No,

3093
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:52,070
no fucking burst right through that shit.

3094
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:54,520
Just like that gay last would do for you.

3095
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:55,793
Yeah,

3096
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:57,590
with it.

3097
01:31:57,590 --> 01:32:00,010
Giant raging hard on just

3098
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:01,800
purple and the angry.

3099
01:32:02,370 --> 01:32:03,430
Just demand satisfied

3100
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:04,220
faction like that.

3101
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:06,010
Dolphin calm down,

3102
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:06,940
calm down.

3103
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:07,773
Imagine

3104
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:10,600
you already feel like shit.

3105
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:11,440
What if feeling like,

3106
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:11,951
oh my God,

3107
01:32:11,951 --> 01:32:13,720
I just sucked this dude's Dick.

3108
01:32:13,721 --> 01:32:15,550
You start being by for a little bit.

3109
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:16,570
Maybe that's what it is.

3110
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:17,404
It's like,

3111
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:17,860
no,

3112
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:18,491
I'm not drunk,

3113
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:19,324
but I'm buzzed.

3114
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:24,250
Be a buy for a little.

3115
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:30,490
I wonder if they're ever gonna figure
out a way or if humans keep evolving,

3116
01:32:30,491 --> 01:32:34,750
if we're ever going to separate
the idea of sex and making people.

3117
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:36,670
Because if you look at,

3118
01:32:36,671 --> 01:32:41,671
like if you look at all the images that
people claim to have seen like of these

3119
01:32:41,711 --> 01:32:42,401
aliens,

3120
01:32:42,401 --> 01:32:43,360
the gray aliens,

3121
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:44,870
they all are set clothes.

3122
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:47,560
They have no organs
that have no sex organs.

3123
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:48,870
And you got to wonder man,

3124
01:32:48,871 --> 01:32:49,150
if,

3125
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:49,840
if we,

3126
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:54,190
we keep fucking around with genetics and
we keep fucking around with artificial

3127
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:58,480
scan and all this weird shit that's going
on right now that they're there in the

3128
01:32:58,481 --> 01:33:01,780
middle of a experimenting
with artificial cells,

3129
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:02,770
artificial.

3130
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:05,440
Adam's like all really strange.

3131
01:33:05,441 --> 01:33:08,230
I don't know if they could do artificial
atoms but really strange shit.

3132
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,990
And the idea is that one day,

3133
01:33:10,991 --> 01:33:12,670
what if they just say,

3134
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:13,270
listen,

3135
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:14,770
when we have sex,

3136
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,670
we have these problems and
there's a lot of emotions.

3137
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:21,250
We've figured out a way
to isolate those sayings,

3138
01:33:21,251 --> 01:33:23,350
feelings and you can get that with a pill.

3139
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:26,800
And then we could just recreate
people with like skin cells.

3140
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:30,430
We can make you a person and you could
raise that person and the person just

3141
01:33:30,431 --> 01:33:30,850
take a,

3142
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:34,120
take a skin cell from you and run
it through a fucking computer.

3143
01:33:34,121 --> 01:33:34,511
What do you want?

3144
01:33:34,511 --> 01:33:35,031
You want a boy?

3145
01:33:35,031 --> 01:33:35,864
You want a girl?

3146
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:36,491
It doesn't matter.

3147
01:33:36,491 --> 01:33:41,110
Everybody looks the same that he's got a
deck and they'd come out and if we keep

3148
01:33:41,111 --> 01:33:41,800
going,

3149
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,210
if the technology and the,

3150
01:33:43,211 --> 01:33:43,591
the,

3151
01:33:43,591 --> 01:33:43,980
the,

3152
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:46,870
the symbiotic relationship
that human beings have to it.

3153
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:48,070
If that shit keeps going,

3154
01:33:48,071 --> 01:33:49,450
which it obviously it's going to,

3155
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:52,380
we're going to start fucking
with the human body and we're,

3156
01:33:52,381 --> 01:33:57,381
we're certainly more likely to move
away from monkey instincts and,

3157
01:33:58,360 --> 01:33:58,920
and the,

3158
01:33:58,920 --> 01:33:59,231
the,

3159
01:33:59,231 --> 01:33:59,530
the,

3160
01:33:59,530 --> 01:34:03,490
the certain needs that caused
people to want to dominate others,

3161
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:04,740
to want to fuck others,

3162
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:05,710
to want to plant seeds.

3163
01:34:05,710 --> 01:34:05,980
Like,

3164
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:06,460
well,

3165
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:08,470
if we really look at it all objectively,

3166
01:34:08,471 --> 01:34:11,740
we might one day decide to
slowly move away from that.

3167
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,360
And it might take a few thousand years,

3168
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:18,250
but if it might get to a point where
as a culture they recognize that these

3169
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:23,170
lustful feelings that we enjoy today and
that motivate people to build buildings

3170
01:34:23,171 --> 01:34:27,160
and drive fast cars and
fucking learn how to fly a jet.

3171
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:29,710
Those that might be,

3172
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:31,120
that might be a thing of the past.

3173
01:34:31,390 --> 01:34:35,920
They might figure out a way to engineer
human beings to the point where sex is

3174
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:37,450
no longer part of the equation.

3175
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:40,060
That's a real mind fuck man.

3176
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:42,460
If they come up with something
that feels better than sex though,

3177
01:34:42,490 --> 01:34:43,510
it's totally possible.

3178
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:46,330
They come up with some sort
of an artificial reality,

3179
01:34:46,331 --> 01:34:47,580
some simulated thing,

3180
01:34:47,581 --> 01:34:48,390
some fucking

3181
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:51,480
or sex that you can eat
sex that you could eat,

3182
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:54,920
like imagine something
ambitious and it's it.

3183
01:34:54,921 --> 01:34:56,340
It fulfills your sexual flow.

3184
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:57,110
The more you fuck,

3185
01:34:57,110 --> 01:34:58,040
the better it gets.

3186
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:00,041
I want to,

3187
01:35:00,041 --> 01:35:00,861
how many people out there?

3188
01:35:00,861 --> 01:35:02,240
I had zero sex drive,

3189
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:03,740
like they just had a condition.

3190
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:05,990
Zero sex drive.

3191
01:35:05,991 --> 01:35:07,460
They do not want to fuck ever.

3192
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:08,690
I'm sure there's quite a few.

3193
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:10,040
Who are those guys?

3194
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:11,330
I'm sure there's quite a few.

3195
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:14,270
I wonder if if it's,

3196
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:14,720
you know,

3197
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:17,150
there's super happy people like that.

3198
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:18,650
Yeah.

3199
01:35:18,650 --> 01:35:18,950
Yeah.

3200
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:20,060
Can you be super happy?

3201
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:20,720
Sure.

3202
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:21,080
For sure.

3203
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:22,130
Have like hobbies,

3204
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:23,083
you know,

3205
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,200
motivate you.

3206
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,660
There's a lot of people are
just not motivated by sex.

3207
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:27,111
You know,

3208
01:35:27,111 --> 01:35:30,080
I met a lot of people that are in
relationships that don't have sex anymore.

3209
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,390
That's when it gets really
weird and they tell you,

3210
01:35:32,391 --> 01:35:32,571
hey,

3211
01:35:32,571 --> 01:35:34,100
we're like more friends than anything.

3212
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:34,281
I mean,

3213
01:35:34,281 --> 01:35:35,330
I don't even care anymore.

3214
01:35:35,890 --> 01:35:36,980
Like what I know.

3215
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:37,700
And Dude,

3216
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:38,690
his wife had a baby,

3217
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:42,320
he had a hard time having
getting some sex as it was.

3218
01:35:42,321 --> 01:35:42,441
Like,

3219
01:35:42,441 --> 01:35:45,050
it was always the joke around the set.

3220
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:45,913
We worked together.

3221
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:47,180
It was always a joke around the set.

3222
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:47,481
Oh,

3223
01:35:47,481 --> 01:35:48,540
he's talking about he can't get laid.

3224
01:35:48,570 --> 01:35:50,510
Everybody would talk about this
poor guy who couldn't get laid.

3225
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,640
And then finally his wife had a kid.

3226
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:57,850
So I guess he got laid and she got
pregnant and then she shut it off no more.

3227
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,000
And His kid is now three and he has had
no sex with her since you got pregnant.

3228
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:06,710
And that's just madness.

3229
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:07,131
Yeah.

3230
01:36:07,131 --> 01:36:07,670
And I'm like,

3231
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:08,990
how can I go live like that?

3232
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:09,821
Like how,

3233
01:36:09,821 --> 01:36:10,790
how could a guy like,

3234
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:11,231
she just,

3235
01:36:11,231 --> 01:36:14,560
she just no desire to
please him and he's like,

3236
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:14,781
I go,

3237
01:36:14,781 --> 01:36:15,614
do you try?

3238
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,010
It's like,

3239
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:16,311
Oh yeah,

3240
01:36:16,311 --> 01:36:17,480
she shuts me down every time.

3241
01:36:17,481 --> 01:36:18,590
Like you keep trying.

3242
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:20,263
Wow.

3243
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:21,830
For some girls probably think that,

3244
01:36:21,831 --> 01:36:22,041
you know,

3245
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:22,671
I'm pregnant.

3246
01:36:22,671 --> 01:36:22,930
It's,

3247
01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:25,760
it's disrespectful to the
baby or some kind of shit.

3248
01:36:25,761 --> 01:36:25,911
Like,

3249
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:26,060
no,

3250
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:26,930
forget about that.

3251
01:36:26,931 --> 01:36:28,070
The kids three.

3252
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:29,833
Oh,

3253
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:31,040
the kids three.

3254
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:33,290
There's been no sex since the baby.

3255
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,160
Like she got,

3256
01:36:34,190 --> 01:36:35,390
she got a baby and she's like,

3257
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:37,190
I don't like that shit.

3258
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:37,911
We're done.

3259
01:36:37,911 --> 01:36:38,540
I don't need it.

3260
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:39,350
I don't need you.

3261
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:40,183
That's crazy.

3262
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:41,420
That's a,

3263
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:43,850
that's a bad situation for a guy to be in.

3264
01:36:43,851 --> 01:36:44,684
Man.

3265
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:45,360
That's a,

3266
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:46,193
that's a,

3267
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:51,610
that guy is like a heroin addict that
lives with a big fat Stasha heroines

3268
01:36:52,521 --> 01:36:53,960
sitting on the kitchen table,

3269
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:55,160
you know,

3270
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,310
it's all the,

3271
01:36:56,311 --> 01:36:56,510
the,

3272
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:59,600
all his needs could be sexually
fulfilled by this other person.

3273
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,070
But this other person's like,

3274
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:02,773
nope,

3275
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:03,763
I don't like it.

3276
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:04,933
I don't want to do it.

3277
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:05,421
Well,

3278
01:37:05,421 --> 01:37:08,070
she does that then obviously
that's good to hurt her.

3279
01:37:08,430 --> 01:37:09,680
He said allowed to cheat.

3280
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:10,220
I would.

3281
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:10,760
I would say,

3282
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:10,921
well,

3283
01:37:10,921 --> 01:37:12,230
he should get out of the relationship.

3284
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:14,000
That's a bad relationship.

3285
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:15,140
We're just don't bring it up around it.

3286
01:37:15,141 --> 01:37:16,340
And you've got a kid involved.

3287
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:16,640
Yeah,

3288
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:17,960
she'd probably be happy if he cheated.

3289
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:18,741
Get out of here,

3290
01:37:18,741 --> 01:37:19,574
bitch.

3291
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:20,240
Trying to fuck me.

3292
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,380
I haven't had sex in three years.

3293
01:37:21,381 --> 01:37:24,280
Three years for 100% I wouldn't bullshit.

3294
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,333
He wouldn't bullshit.

3295
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,293
He's a good dude.

3296
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:28,580
He's a real good dude.

3297
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:31,550
Shit that went on the last three months.

3298
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:32,781
Yeah.

3299
01:37:32,781 --> 01:37:34,280
How long do you think you would last with,

3300
01:37:34,370 --> 01:37:36,680
with a woman if she would refuse to have,

3301
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:36,860
sorry,

3302
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:37,550
three months,

3303
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:39,200
but three months is a long time.

3304
01:37:39,470 --> 01:37:40,640
What kind of reason she had?

3305
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:43,240
What was the reason you dig stank?

3306
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:46,701
No,

3307
01:37:46,701 --> 01:37:47,270
that's true.

3308
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:48,350
It would depend on the reason.

3309
01:37:48,351 --> 01:37:49,730
Like if you had did something wrong

3310
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:55,920
and if everything's fine and
there's no sex for couple of weeks,

3311
01:37:55,921 --> 01:37:56,040
I

3312
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,970
would think something was wrong.

3313
01:37:56,971 --> 01:37:57,510
Like wait,

3314
01:37:57,510 --> 01:37:58,081
there's two weeks,

3315
01:37:58,081 --> 01:37:58,890
this is ridiculous.

3316
01:37:58,890 --> 01:37:59,723
Two weeks.

3317
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:01,410
One week was ridiculous,

3318
01:38:01,411 --> 01:38:02,244
but you know,

3319
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:02,791
two weeks.

3320
01:38:02,791 --> 01:38:03,990
It's just something's wrong.

3321
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:05,500
Well,

3322
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:06,660
they just don't need it as much.

3323
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:08,123
Some of them.

3324
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:09,420
Some of them needed more.

3325
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:10,590
That's when shit gets annoying.

3326
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:11,740
Some of them are addicted to it.

3327
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:14,580
The worst is when your check once
a fuck one you do and you're like,

3328
01:38:14,581 --> 01:38:15,660
Jesus Christ,

3329
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:16,710
I got shit to do.

3330
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:17,520
Yeah,

3331
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,690
you want another one?

3332
01:38:18,790 --> 01:38:19,200
Ah,

3333
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,070
God damn it.

3334
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:21,120
Can I just go to sleep?

3335
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:22,373
Yeah.

3336
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:23,820
Those are in the early days.

3337
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,241
Well,

3338
01:38:24,241 --> 01:38:25,290
I think a lot of,

3339
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:25,411
uh,

3340
01:38:25,411 --> 01:38:26,790
young people do that too,

3341
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:28,590
to sort of distract them from the,

3342
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:28,770
the,

3343
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:30,300
the realities of life.

3344
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:32,570
Life is just so fucking
confusing when you're younger.

3345
01:38:32,571 --> 01:38:35,100
You just want to escape and just
fuck all the time and fall in love.

3346
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,180
I think they're just really,

3347
01:38:36,181 --> 01:38:38,550
really hydrated and the need
to get that shit out of them.

3348
01:38:40,890 --> 01:38:42,360
I don't like it that
I can't see your face.

3349
01:38:42,361 --> 01:38:45,810
You were going to move this screen.

3350
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:47,310
No more of this.

3351
01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:49,170
You're hiding behind their throwing shit.

3352
01:38:49,171 --> 01:38:50,004
Balls,

3353
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:55,573
bunker.

3354
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:56,601
It's fun,

3355
01:38:56,601 --> 01:38:58,790
but it's also quite a conversation killer.

3356
01:38:58,791 --> 01:38:59,624
You're fuck

3357
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:01,480
occasionally they worked though.

3358
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:02,471
Occasionally.

3359
01:39:02,471 --> 01:39:03,304
They're really good.

3360
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:06,200
My ex was a squirter and
that's what I was saying.

3361
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:06,471
Yeah,

3362
01:39:06,471 --> 01:39:07,370
that shits nasty.

3363
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:08,240
I like it.

3364
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,970
A lot of girls like Dana Deanna
and she says that's just pissed.

3365
01:39:11,630 --> 01:39:12,463
She's the line.

3366
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:13,670
But she's a girl,

3367
01:39:13,671 --> 01:39:14,110
man.

3368
01:39:14,110 --> 01:39:15,680
I can you say she knows what's up.

3369
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:18,900
Squirt in the girl's pissing
all over you son snap pics.

3370
01:39:18,910 --> 01:39:21,200
It has a piss smell type smell to it.

3371
01:39:21,201 --> 01:39:23,720
But I don't think as long as
it has a piss type smelling,

3372
01:39:23,721 --> 01:39:26,690
that probably precludes the
possibility of it being pissed.

3373
01:39:27,050 --> 01:39:27,231
I mean,

3374
01:39:27,231 --> 01:39:29,360
why would it be pissed if
it had a piss like smell?

3375
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:31,010
Maybe we need to get
the point drew in here.

3376
01:39:31,370 --> 01:39:31,551
Yeah,

3377
01:39:31,551 --> 01:39:32,181
Dr Drew,

3378
01:39:32,181 --> 01:39:35,660
it has no information that's
accurate about marijuana.

3379
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:37,490
What the fuck do you think
he would tell you that?

3380
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:39,350
What?

3381
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:41,550
Do you still have your going off
all of the information to his show?

3382
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:42,611
I would definitely do it.

3383
01:39:42,611 --> 01:39:42,731
Should.

3384
01:39:42,731 --> 01:39:44,740
You would think that he
probably wouldn't want no,

3385
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:44,930
she,

3386
01:39:44,930 --> 01:39:45,241
listen,

3387
01:39:45,241 --> 01:39:45,991
I've never said anything.

3388
01:39:45,991 --> 01:39:46,030
Yeah,

3389
01:39:46,030 --> 01:39:46,990
well that's not true.

3390
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:47,830
Um,

3391
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:51,980
he's done some silly things when it came
to marijuana and the silliest thing is

3392
01:39:52,030 --> 01:39:52,541
nonsense.

3393
01:39:52,541 --> 01:39:55,420
And he says on a CNN show
about these horrible,

3394
01:39:55,421 --> 01:39:59,680
a addictive withdrawals that people have
and the withdrawal symptoms that people

3395
01:39:59,681 --> 01:40:00,580
have for marijuana.

3396
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:02,170
That's crazy.

3397
01:40:02,171 --> 01:40:03,010
And he knows it.

3398
01:40:03,011 --> 01:40:05,140
That is fucking crazy.

3399
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:10,470
The people who have any
physical withdrawal from
marijuana are extremely rare

3400
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:13,920
shrimi way.

3401
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:14,231
But you know,

3402
01:40:14,231 --> 01:40:14,870
I could get,

3403
01:40:14,870 --> 01:40:15,221
get,

3404
01:40:15,221 --> 01:40:18,880
get we've away from Joey Diaz that
he would probably go through physical

3405
01:40:18,881 --> 01:40:19,600
withdrawals.

3406
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:20,433
I don't think so.

3407
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:20,930
No.

3408
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:22,270
He takes days off a week,

3409
01:40:22,271 --> 01:40:22,601
man.

3410
01:40:22,601 --> 01:40:23,950
It's not a physical thing.

3411
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:25,710
Joey likes to be high for sure.

3412
01:40:25,711 --> 01:40:25,860
Yeah,

3413
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:29,100
definitely add medicating
or whatever the fuck he has,

3414
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:29,851
but yeah,

3415
01:40:29,851 --> 01:40:31,410
but we're talking about the dude.

3416
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:32,383
He could not,

3417
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:33,660
he would get annoyed with you.

3418
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:34,171
Okay.

3419
01:40:34,171 --> 01:40:35,400
He would want to be high again,

3420
01:40:35,401 --> 01:40:38,490
but physically his body
would not be addicted to it.

3421
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,110
So that's where withdrawal syndrome,

3422
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:41,750
you're probably sweating at night.

3423
01:40:41,751 --> 01:40:42,170
I think.

3424
01:40:42,170 --> 01:40:43,370
I just see him maybe

3425
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:44,240
wrong,

3426
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:44,360
man.

3427
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:44,770
I mean,

3428
01:40:44,770 --> 01:40:45,071
look,

3429
01:40:45,071 --> 01:40:47,080
there's some people that
get addicted to toothpaste.

3430
01:40:47,081 --> 01:40:47,321
Okay.

3431
01:40:47,321 --> 01:40:48,880
There's people that get
addicted to everything.

3432
01:40:49,150 --> 01:40:51,520
There's a lot of weirdness
in the world of addictions.

3433
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:54,220
But to say that it's one
of the more dangerous

3434
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,920
drugs and then there's like
dangerous withdrawal syndromes.

3435
01:40:57,070 --> 01:41:00,520
That's nonsense and knows
it's not the gateway theory,

3436
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:02,110
there's no connection,

3437
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:06,010
there's no connection in
marijuana physically to addiction.

3438
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:10,300
It's not like opiates where there's an
established connection of addiction.

3439
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:10,630
The,

3440
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:15,630
there's no chemical established like
connection of addiction to marijuana.

3441
01:41:15,881 --> 01:41:20,000
It's not something that like Rob's your
brain of dopamine and then you need it

3442
01:41:20,001 --> 01:41:20,621
to like read,

3443
01:41:20,621 --> 01:41:21,730
get your high again.

3444
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:22,900
It doesn't work that way.

3445
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:23,200
Yeah.

3446
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:27,560
So for someone that discounts it
and then the other problem is they,

3447
01:41:27,561 --> 01:41:28,060
they,

3448
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:29,020
they belittle it.

3449
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:29,441
They say,

3450
01:41:29,441 --> 01:41:30,131
well look,

3451
01:41:30,131 --> 01:41:30,941
Hey I'm,

3452
01:41:30,941 --> 01:41:31,780
I'm all for it.

3453
01:41:31,781 --> 01:41:32,261
You want out?

3454
01:41:32,261 --> 01:41:33,130
Smoke your pot.

3455
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:34,510
Go ahead and smoke your pot.

3456
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:35,500
That's what you want to do.

3457
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:36,820
Some people like to drink,

3458
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,260
some people like to smoke pot.

3459
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:43,420
And the problem with that is that they're
talking from a non experienced point

3460
01:41:43,421 --> 01:41:43,810
of view.

3461
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:47,290
They're not a person who has had any
psychedelic experiences and they're not a

3462
01:41:47,291 --> 01:41:50,680
person who has had any cannabis
experiences that were enlightening.

3463
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:55,360
And you and I both have had some crazy
experiences eating and smoking at

3464
01:41:55,361 --> 01:42:00,070
whatever where we broke down some certain
aspect of our life and change things

3465
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:03,550
and looked at things in a
different way and created things.

3466
01:42:03,570 --> 01:42:06,520
And music has come from it
and ideas have come from it.

3467
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:08,770
And then an understanding
of yourself comes from it.

3468
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:11,920
And to discount that is ignorance.

3469
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:14,590
Especially if you haven't
experienced it and you,

3470
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:18,640
you are dealing with a
broken group of people.

3471
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:22,390
You're dealing primarily with people
that come to someone when shit is fallen

3472
01:42:22,391 --> 01:42:23,110
apart.

3473
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:23,591
But guess what?

3474
01:42:23,591 --> 01:42:25,330
There's a lot of people
that aren't falling apart.

3475
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:30,650
It's not the same drug as all these
drugs that people are taking when a

3476
01:42:30,651 --> 01:42:33,610
scratching their face off
and you can't call it a drug.

3477
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:35,530
You cannot call it a drug because there's,

3478
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:36,940
there's no meth advocates,

3479
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:38,020
there's no people,

3480
01:42:38,021 --> 01:42:38,231
uh,

3481
01:42:38,231 --> 01:42:38,890
you know,

3482
01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:41,830
trying to tell you that you just get a
little crystal and you're going to get

3483
01:42:41,831 --> 01:42:42,700
your life in order.

3484
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:43,600
You know,

3485
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:47,080
get a little crystal and change
your perspective cause man,

3486
01:42:47,110 --> 01:42:49,750
why don't you just look at
things in a fresh manner,

3487
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:50,231
broach,

3488
01:42:50,231 --> 01:42:52,630
get a little crystal in your system
and then listen to this song.

3489
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:53,730
Math magazines

3490
01:42:55,290 --> 01:42:59,290
when they show have posters of like
the pinups of the crystal up close.

3491
01:42:59,300 --> 01:42:59,920
So you shit,

3492
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:00,753
oh this is,

3493
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:01,720
this is ice.

3494
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:02,351
Oh Shit.

3495
01:43:02,351 --> 01:43:03,910
This is the shit from breaking bad.

3496
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:08,380
This is the shit that the
chemicals make the um,

3497
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:11,620
the photos and the high times and
all those things are so hilarious.

3498
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:13,150
They have like pinups of weed.

3499
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:13,901
Yeah,

3500
01:43:13,901 --> 01:43:14,740
I never got that.

3501
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:15,471
That's ridiculous.

3502
01:43:15,471 --> 01:43:16,001
I love weed,

3503
01:43:16,001 --> 01:43:16,420
you know that.

3504
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:18,970
But I've never been into wheat so much
where I'm going to put up a pinup of

3505
01:43:18,971 --> 01:43:19,630
like,

3506
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:20,140
you know,

3507
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:21,310
purple haze or some shit.

3508
01:43:21,410 --> 01:43:22,600
It really is beautiful.

3509
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:26,440
I can't wait until it becomes legal
because when it becomes legal,

3510
01:43:26,441 --> 01:43:27,580
I'm going to start eating it.

3511
01:43:28,030 --> 01:43:29,680
And I don't even mean to get you high.

3512
01:43:29,681 --> 01:43:31,030
I mean eating it raw,

3513
01:43:31,150 --> 01:43:31,871
which by the way,

3514
01:43:31,871 --> 01:43:32,860
it can't get you high.

3515
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:38,130
But apparently it's super nutritious
like marijuana and the seeds and like

3516
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:39,130
eating it raw.

3517
01:43:39,490 --> 01:43:40,430
Apparently bud,

3518
01:43:40,431 --> 01:43:41,660
like the mud,

3519
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:42,340
the leaves,

3520
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:43,060
all that Shit.

3521
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:43,380
Yeah.

3522
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:43,810
Yeah.

3523
01:43:43,810 --> 01:43:45,070
You just pluck it off the stem.

3524
01:43:45,071 --> 01:43:46,030
You don't eat the stems,

3525
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:49,450
but all those leaves and shit
apparently it's like really nutritious.

3526
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,190
Apparently eating marijuana,

3527
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:52,010
it's like super good

3528
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:53,180
for you and it doesn't
get you high at all.

3529
01:43:53,181 --> 01:43:55,730
You could juice it really
good for you if you juice it.

3530
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:58,190
It's just so many different personalities.

3531
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,121
It's almost,

3532
01:43:59,121 --> 01:44:01,940
it's almost seems like a joke when you
start talking about all the different

3533
01:44:01,941 --> 01:44:02,780
things that it can do.

3534
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:03,411
It's like,

3535
01:44:03,411 --> 01:44:03,771
come on.

3536
01:44:03,771 --> 01:44:05,090
If it could do all those things,

3537
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:05,990
let's be realistic.

3538
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:06,853
It would be legal.

3539
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:07,190
Come on.

3540
01:44:07,190 --> 01:44:08,300
That doesn't even make any sense,

3541
01:44:08,610 --> 01:44:09,980
but you find out you can eat it.

3542
01:44:09,981 --> 01:44:11,210
You can make houses out of it,

3543
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:11,581
like why?

3544
01:44:11,581 --> 01:44:12,321
It's what,

3545
01:44:12,321 --> 01:44:12,950
what else?

3546
01:44:12,950 --> 01:44:15,350
What gets you high and you
can make houses out of it.

3547
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:16,280
You know,

3548
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:18,470
Henry Ford made the first
fucking car out of it,

3549
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,030
the first fucking car,

3550
01:44:20,590 --> 01:44:22,280
the fenders of the car,

3551
01:44:22,281 --> 01:44:23,810
the body of the car was made out of hemp.

3552
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:25,120
That's how much they respected.

3553
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:27,320
The drug thing is ridiculous too,

3554
01:44:27,321 --> 01:44:29,600
because 95% of all the stoners,

3555
01:44:29,601 --> 01:44:31,280
I know they don't do heroin or Meth,

3556
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:32,300
they just smoke weed.

3557
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:33,530
If it was a gateway drug,

3558
01:44:33,531 --> 01:44:37,100
that'd be a big problem with all
my friends with math and heroin,

3559
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:38,001
there's not a problem.

3560
01:44:38,001 --> 01:44:40,400
The whole gateway thing is all bullshit.

3561
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:41,870
They're going to,

3562
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:44,810
they're going to find the a way
to stop people from smoking weed.

3563
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:48,350
And what they're going to do is they're
going to mix up that shit from that

3564
01:44:48,351 --> 01:44:49,580
Parkinson's medication.

3565
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:54,740
They're going to get into the weeds supply
and everybody's going to go gay bomb

3566
01:44:54,741 --> 01:44:55,221
with the week.

3567
01:44:55,221 --> 01:44:55,360
You know,

3568
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:56,450
with Colorado,

3569
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:56,731
you know,

3570
01:44:56,731 --> 01:44:57,171
you hear,

3571
01:44:57,171 --> 01:44:58,920
we've talked about this about a week ago,

3572
01:44:58,921 --> 01:45:02,540
that they had one of the worst
economies in the state and now with,

3573
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,970
with we that one of
the best in the states.

3574
01:45:04,971 --> 01:45:05,804
I mean,

3575
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:06,710
that's what I was told.

3576
01:45:06,711 --> 01:45:07,401
I don't know if it's true,

3577
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:07,640
but yeah,

3578
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,630
that's the metal that
doesn't seem like they would,

3579
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:10,191
how,

3580
01:45:10,191 --> 01:45:10,461
okay,

3581
01:45:10,461 --> 01:45:10,730
let's,

3582
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:11,320
let's look,

3583
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:11,720
um,

3584
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:14,120
economic impact in Colorado,

3585
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,400
unless I was told total bullshit.

3586
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:16,911
And it could be,

3587
01:45:16,911 --> 01:45:17,270
yeah,

3588
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:18,350
that sounds like one of those,

3589
01:45:18,351 --> 01:45:19,040
dude,

3590
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:24,040
they were ready to totally close the
state and quit being a state and then we'd

3591
01:45:24,501 --> 01:45:27,860
came along and now
they're rich San hazing.

3592
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:28,131
No,

3593
01:45:28,131 --> 01:45:29,000
it wasn't like quite like,

3594
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:29,571
okay,

3595
01:45:29,571 --> 01:45:30,080
no,

3596
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,640
I have weed in Colorado.

3597
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:32,803
Yeah.

3598
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:34,550
If that's true,

3599
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:37,580
isn't that I should write Merrill's and
that's something that would influence

3600
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:38,690
other states if it did that,

3601
01:45:38,691 --> 01:45:40,490
if it completely turned
their economy around,

3602
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:43,040
the real issue is the problem
that dummies get to vote.

3603
01:45:44,930 --> 01:45:45,890
That's the real problem.

3604
01:45:46,010 --> 01:45:48,680
The real problem is dummies get the vote
and a lot of dummies have these like

3605
01:45:48,681 --> 01:45:50,870
fundamentalist ideas
about it and they just,

3606
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:52,970
they just can't accept the
fact that first of all,

3607
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:55,070
you should be able to do
whatever the fuck you want to do.

3608
01:45:55,190 --> 01:45:55,911
I'm a grown man.

3609
01:45:55,911 --> 01:45:56,744
You're a grown man.

3610
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:58,070
Just cause you believe in,

3611
01:45:58,071 --> 01:45:58,904
you know,

3612
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:00,153
whatever.

3613
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:03,050
It doesn't mean you can stop me from
doing what I want to do if it doesn't hurt

3614
01:46:03,051 --> 01:46:03,884
anybody else.

3615
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:04,641
So that,

3616
01:46:04,641 --> 01:46:07,130
that right away as a problem because
not everybody agrees with that.

3617
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:07,950
There's a,

3618
01:46:07,950 --> 01:46:09,260
there's a lot of fucking dummies.

3619
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:10,520
It's dummy's get the vote.

3620
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:11,840
But how many,

3621
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:14,840
how many states have
medical marijuana now?

3622
01:46:15,230 --> 01:46:18,930
I believe it's a 16 or
something like that.

3623
01:46:18,931 --> 01:46:20,510
And now they just made,

3624
01:46:20,511 --> 01:46:20,930
um,

3625
01:46:20,930 --> 01:46:22,940
Massachusetts just got through.

3626
01:46:23,330 --> 01:46:24,380
Can you find that out Brian?

3627
01:46:24,381 --> 01:46:26,350
How many states are medical marijuana?

3628
01:46:26,351 --> 01:46:27,320
Cause it was 13,

3629
01:46:27,321 --> 01:46:29,210
like it seemed like eight years ago.

3630
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,520
And like now,

3631
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:33,223
Brian,

3632
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:34,220
you didn't want to do that?

3633
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:36,500
No,

3634
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:38,120
the Internet's not working on that,

3635
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:39,200
this laptop very well,

3636
01:46:39,230 --> 01:46:40,730
so I'm sure really fuck anything up.

3637
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:41,690
Okay.

3638
01:46:41,690 --> 01:46:43,580
I'm using my phone just to
look at Twitter and there.

3639
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:44,031
All right,

3640
01:46:44,031 --> 01:46:45,230
well let's assume it's a lot.

3641
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:47,030
Let's say I think it's like 16,

3642
01:46:47,450 --> 01:46:48,051
but the,

3643
01:46:48,051 --> 01:46:48,884
um,

3644
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:49,783
I think that

3645
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,770
eventually the,

3646
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:52,070
the,

3647
01:46:52,070 --> 01:46:53,670
the Washington state's and the,

3648
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:56,580
the Colorados two places 18.

3649
01:46:56,581 --> 01:46:57,270
Wow.

3650
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:57,451
The,

3651
01:46:57,451 --> 01:47:00,660
the two states that made it legal,

3652
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:01,050
the,

3653
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:04,080
what's going to be really interesting
to see is what happens from here.

3654
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:08,100
Because if the federal government
still decides to fuck with them,

3655
01:47:08,101 --> 01:47:08,934
they can.

3656
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:10,290
And that's where it gets really strange.

3657
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:11,910
So if these people start up legitimate,

3658
01:47:11,911 --> 01:47:14,520
we'd stores that are legitimate
under their state law,

3659
01:47:14,670 --> 01:47:16,500
just like liquor stores pay their pay,

3660
01:47:16,501 --> 01:47:17,760
their taxes and all that shit.

3661
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:21,540
Does the government come down on them
because they can't if they want and they

3662
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:22,410
have before.

3663
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:26,430
There's a case of a guy
from Montana and it's a,

3664
01:47:26,431 --> 01:47:30,240
he's becoming a big martyr once people
found out about it on the Internet,

3665
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:33,480
cause this guy regularly had law
enforcement from state law enforcement.

3666
01:47:33,660 --> 01:47:35,970
He invited them on tours of his grow up.

3667
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:37,410
He did everything legit.

3668
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:40,020
Everything by the book checked
double checked with everybody,

3669
01:47:40,021 --> 01:47:41,610
follow the state law to a t.

3670
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:45,420
But the government came in and
arrested him under federal laws.

3671
01:47:45,570 --> 01:47:48,840
They wouldn't even let him use the term
medical marijuana because it doesn't

3672
01:47:48,841 --> 01:47:49,800
exist federally.

3673
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:54,060
So this guy's looking at
80 years in prison and this
guy did everything correct.

3674
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:57,480
That's where it gets Montana.

3675
01:47:57,990 --> 01:48:00,030
That's where it gets
really fucking squirrely.

3676
01:48:00,031 --> 01:48:00,864
Because look,

3677
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:04,680
when there's a guy who's not hurting
anybody and he's giving someone something

3678
01:48:04,681 --> 01:48:09,300
that should be legal in your area
because the people voted on it.

3679
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,790
If you want to lock that guy up,

3680
01:48:11,970 --> 01:48:12,391
your,

3681
01:48:12,391 --> 01:48:14,460
the criminal and that,

3682
01:48:14,461 --> 01:48:15,090
that,

3683
01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:15,923
that's uh,

3684
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:21,080
that's an important point to make in
this society that just because someone

3685
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:27,620
wrote some shit down on paper and you
can interpret it in a way that you decide

3686
01:48:27,931 --> 01:48:30,720
you could put someone in jail and if
you put someone in jail that's not doing

3687
01:48:30,721 --> 01:48:34,920
anyone any danger and he puts him in jail
for 80 fucking years for selling happy

3688
01:48:34,921 --> 01:48:35,754
plants,

3689
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:37,050
you're a criminal.

3690
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:38,033
Like you're uh,

3691
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:39,360
cultural criminal.

3692
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:41,910
I've got someone who's a robing society.

3693
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:44,010
That's someone who we have to pay.

3694
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:48,480
We pay them tax dollars and they arrest
people who aren't hurting anyone.

3695
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:51,030
You're telling me there was another
shit you guys could have done.

3696
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:53,220
You're telling me those
cops that arrested that guy,

3697
01:48:53,230 --> 01:48:58,230
they couldn't have been like busting
burglaries or burglar or leaves or uh,

3698
01:48:58,430 --> 01:49:01,110
are arresting murderers or you know,

3699
01:49:01,170 --> 01:49:03,960
fucking kicking down the
door of a crack house.

3700
01:49:04,590 --> 01:49:08,340
Why the fuck are they going after
this guy who keeps having cops and law

3701
01:49:08,341 --> 01:49:12,300
enforcement and mayors over his property
to show them his grow up because

3702
01:49:12,301 --> 01:49:16,140
everything's done under state law and
paying his taxes because there's a bunch

3703
01:49:16,141 --> 01:49:17,460
of criminals in government,

3704
01:49:17,461 --> 01:49:18,294
man,

3705
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:20,040
the actual government itself,

3706
01:49:20,041 --> 01:49:23,310
it's filled with criminals and they think
that they're allowed to do it because

3707
01:49:23,311 --> 01:49:24,900
it's written down somewhere.

3708
01:49:25,150 --> 01:49:26,190
It's a federal law.

3709
01:49:26,191 --> 01:49:29,230
The federal law against
marijuana has been the same since

3710
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:33,480
federal government to change its position.

3711
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:36,030
The federal government
doesn't change his position.

3712
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:37,620
That's whole Harris.

3713
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:38,371
That is,

3714
01:49:38,371 --> 01:49:40,260
hi Larry [inaudible] that.

3715
01:49:40,261 --> 01:49:41,430
That is one thing.

3716
01:49:41,431 --> 01:49:45,000
I mean there's anything that makes
the government out to be horse.

3717
01:49:45,330 --> 01:49:46,710
It's their stance on marijuana.

3718
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:47,441
It's one of the,

3719
01:49:47,441 --> 01:49:48,130
one of the biggest

3720
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:53,130
whore like stances because scientists
should have long ago convinced politicians

3721
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:58,030
that there's massive benefit to
this country if we grow this stuff,

3722
01:49:58,180 --> 01:49:58,961
if we grow it,

3723
01:49:58,961 --> 01:49:59,800
if we sell it,

3724
01:49:59,801 --> 01:50:00,160
look,

3725
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,600
it's cultural benefit.

3726
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:06,280
There's artistic benefit and then
there's farmers benefiting financially,

3727
01:50:06,281 --> 01:50:07,750
not just by selling the drug,

3728
01:50:07,751 --> 01:50:09,400
but by selling the hamp and all this shit.

3729
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:14,770
But that's not the kind of fucking
law enforcement we have here.

3730
01:50:15,550 --> 01:50:16,270
Eddie Bravo.

3731
01:50:16,270 --> 01:50:16,720
Yeah.

3732
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:17,620
They don't think right.

3733
01:50:17,650 --> 01:50:18,171
It's crazy.

3734
01:50:18,171 --> 01:50:18,880
Yeah,

3735
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,170
you're good for about an hour and a half,

3736
01:50:20,171 --> 01:50:21,280
two and then you always do this.

3737
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:25,590
He just locked down here a burst of
stories and then he just like set it up.

3738
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,700
That's the first wave of the week.

3739
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:29,971
No,

3740
01:50:29,971 --> 01:50:30,181
no,

3741
01:50:30,181 --> 01:50:30,301
no.

3742
01:50:30,301 --> 01:50:31,134
I'm good.

3743
01:50:31,140 --> 01:50:31,581
I'm kidding,

3744
01:50:31,581 --> 01:50:31,830
man.

3745
01:50:31,830 --> 01:50:32,880
The first wave.

3746
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:34,231
I agree with you.

3747
01:50:34,231 --> 01:50:35,250
It's an incredible,

3748
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:36,293
I mean

3749
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:37,950
it's,

3750
01:50:37,950 --> 01:50:40,890
it's incredible what the
information that's coming out with,

3751
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:41,760
you know,

3752
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:42,061
you know,

3753
01:50:42,061 --> 01:50:44,790
for the last 10 years
we've been talking about,

3754
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:45,570
you know,

3755
01:50:45,570 --> 01:50:49,410
all this fishy ass shit that the
government does like with nine 11,

3756
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:51,800
all this fishy ash.

3757
01:50:52,010 --> 01:50:56,940
Did you see the news report where they
finally released a video from hotel

3758
01:50:56,941 --> 01:50:57,421
surveillance?

3759
01:50:57,421 --> 01:50:58,051
It was on the news.

3760
01:50:58,051 --> 01:51:03,051
It's on youtube where they show before
they only showed three frames of the

3761
01:51:03,781 --> 01:51:04,830
explosion at the Pentagon.

3762
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:05,820
Now they show the whole thing.

3763
01:51:05,821 --> 01:51:06,541
There's an explosion.

3764
01:51:06,541 --> 01:51:07,374
There's no plane.

3765
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:08,850
What is this?

3766
01:51:08,850 --> 01:51:10,740
There's a video on youtube.

3767
01:51:10,950 --> 01:51:11,510
It's just,

3768
01:51:11,510 --> 01:51:11,920
uh,

3769
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:12,960
w what is it called?

3770
01:51:14,190 --> 01:51:14,610
Hmm.

3771
01:51:14,610 --> 01:51:16,740
Maybe Pentagon explosion.

3772
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:17,161
Yeah.

3773
01:51:17,161 --> 01:51:19,020
Just put Pentagon explosion video.

3774
01:51:20,310 --> 01:51:21,190
All right.

3775
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:23,360
You in this is legit.

3776
01:51:23,870 --> 01:51:25,760
I mean it appears to be legit.

3777
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:26,900
You know what,

3778
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:29,470
even even if it isn't legit,

3779
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:30,680
if it's like a hoax,

3780
01:51:31,070 --> 01:51:31,461
it is.

3781
01:51:31,461 --> 01:51:32,181
It's still,

3782
01:51:32,181 --> 01:51:32,990
it's like a,

3783
01:51:32,990 --> 01:51:33,291
you know,

3784
01:51:33,291 --> 01:51:35,540
the government is like
the neighborhood whore,

3785
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:36,380
you know,

3786
01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:37,213
it's,

3787
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:38,150
if,

3788
01:51:38,150 --> 01:51:41,300
if she gets accused of
boning your friend Tommy,

3789
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:41,811
you're like,

3790
01:51:41,811 --> 01:51:42,460
you know,

3791
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:43,400
it's probably happened.

3792
01:51:43,401 --> 01:51:44,360
Even if it didn't happen,

3793
01:51:44,361 --> 01:51:45,320
she's still at whore.

3794
01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:46,383
Okay.

3795
01:51:46,670 --> 01:51:48,800
The actual hidden footage,

3796
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:50,090
no airplane.

3797
01:51:50,091 --> 01:51:53,480
This was October of 2012 so
that must be the new shit,

3798
01:51:53,481 --> 01:51:53,990
right?

3799
01:51:53,990 --> 01:51:55,640
Only 992 views.

3800
01:51:55,910 --> 01:51:58,220
I would think it was around
for like more than a month.

3801
01:51:58,550 --> 01:51:59,960
More than a thousand people.

3802
01:51:59,961 --> 01:52:00,070
Right.

3803
01:52:00,070 --> 01:52:02,010
So maybe there's a bunch
of videos like that.

3804
01:52:02,011 --> 01:52:03,040
Maybe they made copies.

3805
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:04,391
Okay.

3806
01:52:04,391 --> 01:52:05,500
Let's see what happens here.

3807
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:11,080
Hmm.

3808
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:11,351
Wow,

3809
01:52:11,351 --> 01:52:12,250
that's hard to tell.

3810
01:52:13,690 --> 01:52:14,290
Um,

3811
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:15,370
it looks like,

3812
01:52:16,330 --> 01:52:16,811
first of all,

3813
01:52:16,811 --> 01:52:21,220
it's way in the distance and
it's really blurry as fuck.

3814
01:52:21,550 --> 01:52:23,650
I guess this is like a security camera,

3815
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:27,820
but it actually does look
like someone flies in there.

3816
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:29,380
It actually does,

3817
01:52:29,381 --> 01:52:29,930
dude,

3818
01:52:29,930 --> 01:52:32,100
that like that looks like
a fucking complaining.

3819
01:52:32,170 --> 01:52:32,800
The last,

3820
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:33,131
yeah,

3821
01:52:33,131 --> 01:52:33,790
the last one.

3822
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:34,540
It could be,

3823
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:35,780
you know what people are saying?

3824
01:52:35,870 --> 01:52:37,790
It's either a bomb or a missile.

3825
01:52:38,230 --> 01:52:38,441
Yeah,

3826
01:52:38,441 --> 01:52:38,741
there's,

3827
01:52:38,741 --> 01:52:41,380
there's actually something
like really clear watch.

3828
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:42,693
Watch this.

3829
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:43,721
Look at this slide here.

3830
01:52:43,721 --> 01:52:45,950
There's something really
clear that in right now.

3831
01:52:45,951 --> 01:52:46,784
Watch.

3832
01:52:49,230 --> 01:52:50,063
See that.

3833
01:52:50,110 --> 01:52:50,861
See that white thing.

3834
01:52:50,861 --> 01:52:51,694
And then boom.

3835
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:53,193
So that,

3836
01:52:53,230 --> 01:52:54,070
that's like a plane.

3837
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:56,890
There's something right here
under this that comes at it.

3838
01:52:57,190 --> 01:52:58,340
And then it hits set.

3839
01:52:58,690 --> 01:52:59,560
Watch one more time.

3840
01:53:00,890 --> 01:53:01,723
Right here.

3841
01:53:03,670 --> 01:53:04,460
It's right there.

3842
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:05,293
See that?

3843
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:06,673
Boom.

3844
01:53:06,930 --> 01:53:09,750
It's like she could see something
fly into it cause people are crazy.

3845
01:53:11,210 --> 01:53:12,043
Um,

3846
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:13,261
listen to the news.

3847
01:53:13,261 --> 01:53:15,360
It would actually listen to the
audio and listen what they say.

3848
01:53:15,570 --> 01:53:16,640
They say there's no point.

3849
01:53:16,910 --> 01:53:18,150
I look and guess what?

3850
01:53:18,151 --> 01:53:18,960
There's no plane.

3851
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:19,171
Yeah,

3852
01:53:19,171 --> 01:53:20,070
maybe they're retarded.

3853
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:22,500
Those people that are
reading the news man thing,

3854
01:53:22,510 --> 01:53:23,343
so smart,

3855
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:24,811
those fuckers,

3856
01:53:24,811 --> 01:53:26,550
all they do is they just
read off a prompter.

3857
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:30,690
I've never been impressed
with the knowledge of the
people that read the news.

3858
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:32,790
Then they can all suck it.

3859
01:53:33,570 --> 01:53:34,950
I don't know what
happened to the Pentagon,

3860
01:53:34,951 --> 01:53:36,270
but that shit looked like a plane.

3861
01:53:36,271 --> 01:53:37,020
Just hit it.

3862
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:42,020
But doesn't mean it wasn't like also
there's the big theory is that it was some

3863
01:53:42,241 --> 01:53:46,470
sort of a remote control
plane that they've had remote
control planes since the

3864
01:53:46,471 --> 01:53:47,221
1960s.

3865
01:53:47,221 --> 01:53:50,370
We know that because they wanted to
use them in that operation Northwoods,

3866
01:53:50,670 --> 01:53:53,370
one of the plans involved
using a drone airliner,

3867
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:56,190
sending it up in the air and blowing
it up and blaming it on the Cubans.

3868
01:53:56,730 --> 01:53:59,100
So if they could do that in the 1960s,

3869
01:53:59,130 --> 01:54:01,410
if they could blow up a plane back then,

3870
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:05,100
they could probably pilot
things remote by now.

3871
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:05,831
And uh,

3872
01:54:05,831 --> 01:54:07,170
apparently they can.

3873
01:54:07,230 --> 01:54:08,940
And it's been proven that they can,

3874
01:54:08,970 --> 01:54:10,170
they absolutely can.

3875
01:54:10,171 --> 01:54:10,981
They can land them,

3876
01:54:10,981 --> 01:54:11,940
they can take them off.

3877
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:12,570
They can,

3878
01:54:12,570 --> 01:54:14,460
they can actually put planes in the air.

3879
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:15,800
So the,

3880
01:54:15,801 --> 01:54:18,390
the crazy conspiracy theory
as far as I was concerned,

3881
01:54:18,391 --> 01:54:19,230
was that the Ma,

3882
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:21,000
the one of the most fascinating ones,

3883
01:54:21,150 --> 01:54:21,510
they're all,

3884
01:54:21,510 --> 01:54:22,010
they're all,

3885
01:54:22,010 --> 01:54:22,251
you know,

3886
01:54:22,251 --> 01:54:23,250
have a hint of nuttiness.

3887
01:54:23,610 --> 01:54:27,690
But the most fascinating once was that
there was some sort of a drone and that

3888
01:54:27,691 --> 01:54:31,440
that's how those planes crashed into
the buildings and that they couldn't be,

3889
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:31,890
uh,

3890
01:54:31,890 --> 01:54:32,790
engineered,

3891
01:54:33,330 --> 01:54:33,930
like,

3892
01:54:33,930 --> 01:54:34,440
like,

3893
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:35,300
or rather the,

3894
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:40,100
the people that were flying them
probably couldn't have pulled off those

3895
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:40,943
maneuvers.

3896
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:43,200
But that if you had it
on a remote control,

3897
01:54:43,201 --> 01:54:44,070
it could work.

3898
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:45,180
That was where the,

3899
01:54:45,180 --> 01:54:46,980
some pilots had speculated,

3900
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:48,450
especially like the Pentagon one,

3901
01:54:48,690 --> 01:54:52,290
the Pentagon and apparently pilots like
really trip out about because they've

3902
01:54:52,291 --> 01:54:54,960
done like these simulations and no
one's been able to recreate it in a

3903
01:54:54,961 --> 01:54:55,794
simulation.

3904
01:54:55,950 --> 01:54:56,161
You know,

3905
01:54:56,161 --> 01:54:57,510
they have like a simulation machine.

3906
01:54:57,511 --> 01:55:01,590
It shows like exactly the path that the
plane took when it hit the Pentagon and

3907
01:55:01,591 --> 01:55:02,850
these pilots can't even do it.

3908
01:55:02,910 --> 01:55:06,810
It's really hard to do so
low and the grounds down.

3909
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:07,780
You've got a time itself.

3910
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:09,661
It's interesting,

3911
01:55:09,661 --> 01:55:09,960
man.

3912
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:10,793
I don't think I've,

3913
01:55:10,940 --> 01:55:13,590
I don't think I've seen a video where
a pilot was able to recreate it.

3914
01:55:13,591 --> 01:55:14,700
I've only seen failures,

3915
01:55:14,701 --> 01:55:18,000
but that doesn't mean that people haven't
done it just means I haven't seen it,

3916
01:55:18,001 --> 01:55:18,350
but it's,

3917
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:19,183
uh,

3918
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:20,220
you know,

3919
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:21,053
that's possible.

3920
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:21,270
I,

3921
01:55:21,270 --> 01:55:21,751
I wouldn't,

3922
01:55:21,751 --> 01:55:24,390
I wouldn't put it past any
nefarious organization,

3923
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:27,810
domestic or foreign that
they could look if they,

3924
01:55:27,811 --> 01:55:28,180
if they're,

3925
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:28,540
well,

3926
01:55:28,540 --> 01:55:31,020
if anybody's willing to
fly planes into buildings,

3927
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:32,010
are they?

3928
01:55:32,010 --> 01:55:32,430
Yes.

3929
01:55:32,430 --> 01:55:34,650
Clearly we saw it happen
somehow or another.

3930
01:55:34,651 --> 01:55:35,670
That was somebody's idea.

3931
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:36,181
Okay.

3932
01:55:36,181 --> 01:55:37,710
Those planes that flew
into those buildings,

3933
01:55:37,711 --> 01:55:39,000
they didn't just fly in on their own.

3934
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:39,630
Okay.

3935
01:55:39,630 --> 01:55:43,650
So for sure somebody
piloted planes the building,

3936
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:44,100
why

3937
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:46,110
would we think that they
wouldn't do it remotely?

3938
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:47,941
Why would they,

3939
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:48,410
you know,

3940
01:55:48,410 --> 01:55:48,580
we,

3941
01:55:48,580 --> 01:55:48,820
we,

3942
01:55:48,820 --> 01:55:49,411
we are,

3943
01:55:49,411 --> 01:55:49,951
we really,

3944
01:55:49,951 --> 01:55:53,100
truly convinced that people
piloted them themselves.

3945
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:58,400
I think it's a really tough to be sure
that someone is going to fly a plane into

3946
01:55:58,471 --> 01:55:59,280
a fucking building.

3947
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:02,640
It's really tough to be sure
you can hope they do it,

3948
01:56:03,030 --> 01:56:04,470
but it's better to be safe.

3949
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,840
And the way to save is get them to do it.

3950
01:56:06,870 --> 01:56:07,770
Tell them I'm going to do it.

3951
01:56:07,990 --> 01:56:09,060
I just wire the whole thing.

3952
01:56:09,061 --> 01:56:09,360
I'll just,

3953
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:10,380
we'll do it ourselves.

3954
01:56:11,230 --> 01:56:12,870
So in case they check it out,

3955
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:14,671
check it out,

3956
01:56:14,671 --> 01:56:15,330
man.

3957
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:17,100
You might like fucking one more pass.

3958
01:56:17,101 --> 01:56:17,560
One more pass.

3959
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:18,393
We'll go around again.

3960
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:19,230
I'm gonna go around again.

3961
01:56:19,230 --> 01:56:20,370
Keep those passengers out of here.

3962
01:56:20,670 --> 01:56:22,170
Like you might get close then pull up,

3963
01:56:22,171 --> 01:56:22,620
pull up.

3964
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:24,170
You know that crazy Guy John Lear.

3965
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:24,720
Yeah.

3966
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:26,730
He's like one of the craziest dudes ever.

3967
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:27,930
He's hilarious though.

3968
01:56:27,931 --> 01:56:28,581
The shitty sentence.

3969
01:56:28,581 --> 01:56:29,970
He'll say the craziest shit.

3970
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:32,750
And I heard his take on that and he said,

3971
01:56:32,751 --> 01:56:32,880
you know,

3972
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,680
he is a CIA pilot.

3973
01:56:35,010 --> 01:56:35,843
He said,

3974
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:36,870
and you know,

3975
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:38,640
he's the craziest motherfucker out there.

3976
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:40,650
He's probably a disinfecting agent.

3977
01:56:41,210 --> 01:56:42,060
Told him he,

3978
01:56:42,150 --> 01:56:44,230
if anybody was one that do,

3979
01:56:44,231 --> 01:56:45,260
there'd be a CIA shit,

3980
01:56:45,370 --> 01:56:46,900
say like a billionaire or some point.

3981
01:56:46,970 --> 01:56:47,970
He was uh,

3982
01:56:48,030 --> 01:56:48,331
his,

3983
01:56:48,331 --> 01:56:51,120
his dad owned Leer jets and he was,

3984
01:56:51,180 --> 01:56:51,860
uh,

3985
01:56:51,860 --> 01:56:56,130
as far as him being a pilot for the
CIA and being a highly decorated pilot,

3986
01:56:56,131 --> 01:56:57,480
he's got like records and shit.

3987
01:56:57,750 --> 01:56:58,583
That's all true.

3988
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:00,030
But he says crazy,

3989
01:57:00,031 --> 01:57:00,600
crazy shit.

3990
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:05,600
He says that there's no way that someone
could have hit that tower without

3991
01:57:05,971 --> 01:57:09,500
practicing because you're going so fast
that you would have to take a couple

3992
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:10,980
rounds and time.

3993
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,980
He said you'd have to look at a building
and go well and that building hits

3994
01:57:13,990 --> 01:57:17,940
after be right here and it takes a
couple of passes to nail a building cause

3995
01:57:17,941 --> 01:57:18,870
you're going so fast.

3996
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:19,801
That's what he said.

3997
01:57:19,801 --> 01:57:21,360
But he could be full of Shit and I dunno,

3998
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:23,730
I dunno anything about being a
pilot but that's what he said.

3999
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:24,151
Yeah.

4000
01:57:24,151 --> 01:57:29,151
I don't imagine that they will leave it
to chance if they do have remote control

4001
01:57:29,490 --> 01:57:31,050
things that they get put on airlines.

4002
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:32,820
I would imagine that
it would just do that.

4003
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,110
That would be the way to do it.

4004
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:39,300
You know like the latest shit coming
out on the conspiracy theory has been

4005
01:57:39,301 --> 01:57:40,380
looking at all this fishy shit.

4006
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:45,620
Now the latest shit is like what
companies and securities companies and

4007
01:57:47,161 --> 01:57:51,570
brokerage and like tying it into the
collapse of Russia when Russia was

4008
01:57:51,571 --> 01:57:52,404
collapsing,

4009
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:56,670
all these shady ass people high up,

4010
01:57:56,671 --> 01:58:01,380
I don't know what you want to call them
or buying up all this Russian shit and

4011
01:58:01,381 --> 01:58:03,420
laundering it through securities.

4012
01:58:03,690 --> 01:58:06,330
Like oh $250 billion of securities.

4013
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:07,740
Like they were just snatching,

4014
01:58:07,741 --> 01:58:09,390
they made a cash grab in Russia.

4015
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:12,810
But it was all illegal laundering
shit and every 10 years,

4016
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:14,940
every 10 years like that was,

4017
01:58:14,970 --> 01:58:19,900
that was in 1991 so 2001 was the
year that they had a review that,

4018
01:58:19,901 --> 01:58:20,170
you know,

4019
01:58:20,170 --> 01:58:21,001
it takes 10 years,

4020
01:58:21,001 --> 01:58:22,590
it review and make sure everything,

4021
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:25,590
all the securities to make sure
they're all legit and all that shit.

4022
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:26,880
I really don't know how it runs,

4023
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:29,640
but they're tying it into,

4024
01:58:30,210 --> 01:58:31,350
they had a blow up,

4025
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,480
the security broke,

4026
01:58:33,481 --> 01:58:36,770
it broke ridges on the building because
that recommend checking that we're going

4027
01:58:36,771 --> 01:58:39,210
to find out like George w Bush's Dad,

4028
01:58:39,510 --> 01:58:39,871
what does he,

4029
01:58:39,871 --> 01:58:42,160
George Herbert Bush or he like,

4030
01:58:42,161 --> 01:58:45,580
it was all CIA international banker shit.

4031
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:48,820
And it all ties into
the collapse of Russia.

4032
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,440
And this is why weed is illegal.

4033
01:58:50,550 --> 01:58:53,750
These kind of conversations
because when you smoke weed,

4034
01:58:53,790 --> 01:58:54,570
go to,

4035
01:58:54,570 --> 01:58:56,470
it was hauled tied in man.

4036
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:57,761
It's crazy shit.

4037
01:58:57,761 --> 01:58:59,200
Like who knows what's real or not,

4038
01:58:59,201 --> 01:59:01,960
but it seems like tying
it all together now,

4039
01:59:01,990 --> 01:59:02,920
the craziest one.

4040
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:03,970
And I,

4041
01:59:03,970 --> 01:59:04,420
you know,

4042
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:06,670
I try to be as open minded
as I can with these things,

4043
01:59:06,671 --> 01:59:08,800
but if you don't admit
that this one's nuts,

4044
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:10,090
I think you're crazy.

4045
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:12,010
And that's the Donald Rumsfeld one.

4046
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:17,160
When Donald's Rumsfeld came on television
on September 10th and told everybody

4047
01:59:17,441 --> 01:59:20,230
that there's this real
issue with missing money,

4048
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:22,120
there's trillions of dollars,

4049
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:23,500
but they're going to
get to the bottom of it.

4050
01:59:23,570 --> 01:59:25,040
220 trillion,

4051
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:26,600
230 trillion or something.

4052
01:59:26,780 --> 01:59:27,830
Who knows what the number was?

4053
01:59:28,110 --> 01:59:28,943
It was 100 trillion.

4054
01:59:29,180 --> 01:59:30,013
1 trillion.

4055
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:30,873
That's a fucking,

4056
01:59:31,070 --> 01:59:31,903
that's a lot of money.

4057
01:59:31,990 --> 01:59:32,160
Yeah,

4058
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:33,150
but they,

4059
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:33,570
uh,

4060
01:59:33,570 --> 01:59:34,050
they,

4061
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:34,620
the,

4062
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:39,150
the very area where they were working on
this and the accounting offices was hit

4063
01:59:39,151 --> 01:59:39,380
by the

4064
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:40,130
playing.

4065
01:59:40,130 --> 01:59:40,963
Yeah.

4066
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:41,990
And this is on youtube,

4067
01:59:41,991 --> 01:59:44,540
Rumsfeld making that it's on youtube.

4068
01:59:44,541 --> 01:59:46,400
Donald's run felt saying that,

4069
01:59:46,790 --> 01:59:47,600
you know what?

4070
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:49,430
The real enemy is here,

4071
01:59:49,820 --> 01:59:51,050
here in our country,

4072
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:52,490
and we're going to get
to the bottom of this.

4073
01:59:52,580 --> 01:59:56,180
Apparently there's 213
trillion plus the money.

4074
01:59:56,181 --> 01:59:57,050
That number was that.

4075
01:59:57,260 --> 01:59:58,520
We're going to get to the bottom of it.

4076
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:01,370
The enemy is here in
the Pentagon next day.

4077
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:03,230
They blow up the accounting office and,

4078
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:08,560
and apparently the naval intelligence
they were on to what was going on this

4079
02:00:11,241 --> 02:00:13,610
covert laundry and skiing
with through securities.

4080
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:15,280
So like,

4081
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:15,650
uh,

4082
02:00:15,650 --> 02:00:20,650
most of the people that died
in the Pentagon where all
the accountants and a lot

4083
02:00:21,081 --> 02:00:25,250
of all the high ups in the
naval intelligence because
naval intelligence was

4084
02:00:25,251 --> 02:00:28,970
actually looking into these securities
and these Russian so that a blow and the

4085
02:00:28,971 --> 02:00:31,400
naval intelligence course tower seven.

4086
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:31,660
Yep.

4087
02:00:31,660 --> 02:00:32,181
The crazy,

4088
02:00:32,181 --> 02:00:36,250
one of the craziest things is that the
government investigates the government

4089
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:37,360
like the,

4090
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:39,310
this whole thing with
his general Patraeus.

4091
02:00:39,550 --> 02:00:40,510
Do you know how this happened?

4092
02:00:40,511 --> 02:00:41,010
The guy got,

4093
02:00:41,010 --> 02:00:43,510
he got busted having an
affair and he had to resign.

4094
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:47,140
It's because the FBI was
investigating the CIA.

4095
02:00:47,650 --> 02:00:48,850
Like they investigate each other.

4096
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:50,113
Yeah.

4097
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:50,891
Like they,

4098
02:00:50,891 --> 02:00:53,950
the FBI listened to a
complaint by this woman.

4099
02:00:53,951 --> 02:00:57,880
She calls the FBI and says that this
other woman sending her harassing letters.

4100
02:00:58,120 --> 02:00:58,691
And so she,

4101
02:00:58,691 --> 02:01:01,480
they read the letters and
then they go back and forth.

4102
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:02,110
The whole thing.

4103
02:01:02,110 --> 02:01:02,943
Hilarious.

4104
02:01:02,950 --> 02:01:05,620
This is a government was
spying on the government.

4105
02:01:06,070 --> 02:01:06,420
So they,

4106
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:06,700
they,

4107
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:07,950
these motherfuckers,

4108
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:09,700
it's so addictive to them.

4109
02:01:09,940 --> 02:01:12,950
To like spy on people and bus people.

4110
02:01:13,010 --> 02:01:17,570
Bull apparently shade don't
like the FBI and the Dea,

4111
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:21,560
the DEA and the FBI are like
Kinda together and the CIA,

4112
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:22,453
they're separated.

4113
02:01:22,630 --> 02:01:23,150
Wow,

4114
02:01:23,150 --> 02:01:23,710
that's crazy.

4115
02:01:23,710 --> 02:01:25,270
Well then there's the NSA,

4116
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:25,991
you know,

4117
02:01:25,991 --> 02:01:26,291
that's,

4118
02:01:26,291 --> 02:01:27,610
that's where it gets really squirrely.

4119
02:01:27,630 --> 02:01:29,170
Like ooze or what is that?

4120
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:30,650
What's going on in,

4121
02:01:30,910 --> 02:01:34,510
there's so many of these fucking things
and this is some shit that Kennedy was

4122
02:01:34,511 --> 02:01:38,440
scared of in the 1960s Kennedy was
saying in the 1960s we have a shadow

4123
02:01:38,441 --> 02:01:39,274
government.

4124
02:01:39,390 --> 02:01:41,460
You know there's like what
that when he got into office,

4125
02:01:41,461 --> 02:01:46,461
I bet it was like why a big crazy ass
shadow government running things and then

4126
02:01:49,741 --> 02:01:51,360
you get a guy like Obama in place.

4127
02:01:51,361 --> 02:01:54,360
It's like this is our
last hope or rational,

4128
02:01:54,361 --> 02:01:56,250
sensible guy that looks like us.

4129
02:01:56,260 --> 02:01:58,590
It seems like that was a good one.

4130
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:00,510
I wonder if that's what
it is or if it's a he get,

4131
02:02:00,511 --> 02:02:03,360
he just can't really doesn't
have the power change.

4132
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:04,213
Now that is the trick.

4133
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:06,030
The trick is he has no power.

4134
02:02:06,050 --> 02:02:06,170
No,

4135
02:02:06,170 --> 02:02:10,620
just trying as much as he can
to sort of slowly turn the tide.

4136
02:02:10,890 --> 02:02:13,500
But that the people that
are in positions of power,

4137
02:02:13,501 --> 02:02:17,490
they've done it this way for so long
and that's what's really fucked up about

4138
02:02:17,491 --> 02:02:17,551
it.

4139
02:02:17,551 --> 02:02:19,640
The idea that these guys
got away with it like this.

4140
02:02:19,740 --> 02:02:22,770
You know what's crazy is tower six.

4141
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:26,130
There's tower one tower to tower
seven tower one two and seven.

4142
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:31,020
They implode and they fall at free fall
speed tower six and tower for just had

4143
02:02:31,021 --> 02:02:34,610
massive bomb explosions
and debris falling on it,

4144
02:02:34,611 --> 02:02:37,020
but bombs exploded and it bombs.

4145
02:02:37,021 --> 02:02:38,280
It's bombs exploded.

4146
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:39,223
And six,

4147
02:02:39,490 --> 02:02:40,710
I never heard this man.

4148
02:02:40,711 --> 02:02:42,630
There's so much and bombs and car sex.

4149
02:02:42,690 --> 02:02:43,000
Yeah.

4150
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:43,660
Bottle.

4151
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:46,080
You gotta be careful though
because people make shit up.

4152
02:02:46,081 --> 02:02:47,610
I haven't heard anything about bombs.

4153
02:02:48,390 --> 02:02:51,630
Go to go to nine one
one conspiracy nine 11.

4154
02:02:51,820 --> 02:02:54,830
I'm sorry that but a nine 11 conspiracy.

4155
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:55,770
Not going to get me.

4156
02:02:55,830 --> 02:02:56,630
I'm not doing it.

4157
02:02:56,630 --> 02:02:56,920
Okay.

4158
02:02:56,920 --> 02:02:57,900
I don't have the time.

4159
02:02:58,470 --> 02:02:59,000
There's no,

4160
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,160
I mean you don't think a
bomb went off and tower sex.

4161
02:03:02,220 --> 02:03:02,790
Um,

4162
02:03:02,790 --> 02:03:04,270
I didn't hear what if they did though.

4163
02:03:04,350 --> 02:03:08,040
Let's just say what if it did and this
is the story of a bomb went off and

4164
02:03:08,041 --> 02:03:08,670
tower.

4165
02:03:08,670 --> 02:03:10,090
There's pictures and goody outlets.

4166
02:03:11,490 --> 02:03:13,500
How can that be crazy when you,

4167
02:03:13,820 --> 02:03:15,630
you're bashing the
government all the time,

4168
02:03:15,631 --> 02:03:17,930
but then a bomb goes off
in tower six and nine.

4169
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:18,870
I think those are fine.

4170
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:20,290
I think that there is,

4171
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:21,070
uh,

4172
02:03:21,070 --> 02:03:21,670
amongst,

4173
02:03:21,670 --> 02:03:23,290
especially amongst people on the Internet,

4174
02:03:23,550 --> 02:03:28,550
there is a very real desire to uncover
hidden secrets and sometimes it gets so

4175
02:03:29,171 --> 02:03:32,050
far that they reached the
bombs went off everywhere.

4176
02:03:32,110 --> 02:03:34,420
Maybe I believe it's possible.

4177
02:03:34,450 --> 02:03:35,790
I've seen the testimony,

4178
02:03:35,810 --> 02:03:38,890
well I think there was also explosions
and it might not have been bombs because

4179
02:03:38,891 --> 02:03:39,970
there were so many fires.

4180
02:03:39,971 --> 02:03:40,930
I mean that was one of the,

4181
02:03:40,931 --> 02:03:41,510
uh,

4182
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:44,440
the excuses they use for tower seven.

4183
02:03:44,441 --> 02:03:48,340
The only one that makes sense is that
there was diesel fires because they had

4184
02:03:48,341 --> 02:03:49,450
diesel generators and they,

4185
02:03:49,451 --> 02:03:53,770
apparently they had just a fuck load
of diesel and that shit caught on fire.

4186
02:03:53,771 --> 02:03:54,280
And if,

4187
02:03:54,280 --> 02:03:55,540
if that was the case,

4188
02:03:55,541 --> 02:03:59,770
I could see it like gutting the place
with some crazy fire and maybe it falls

4189
02:03:59,771 --> 02:04:00,250
down.

4190
02:04:00,250 --> 02:04:01,550
I was like,

4191
02:04:01,551 --> 02:04:02,320
I'm not writing,

4192
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:03,710
but wouldn't it be weird if it,

4193
02:04:03,750 --> 02:04:04,810
if it was true,

4194
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:06,070
you're saying maybe it is,

4195
02:04:06,071 --> 02:04:06,760
maybe it isn't.

4196
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:08,710
You're not saying definitely
it doesn't cause you know,

4197
02:04:08,711 --> 02:04:09,544
you wouldn't say that.

4198
02:04:09,610 --> 02:04:14,610
So maybe let's just say a bomb did go
off and there's pictures and video of it

4199
02:04:14,681 --> 02:04:15,341
looks like a,

4200
02:04:15,341 --> 02:04:20,341
the Oklahoma City bombing that building
and the office that was bombed was the

4201
02:04:22,180 --> 02:04:22,181
El Dorado Task Force,

4202
02:04:22,181 --> 02:04:26,650
which investigates all of these securities
and the money laundering and all that

4203
02:04:26,651 --> 02:04:26,820
shit.

4204
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:29,110
Never investigating the
whole Russian collapse.

4205
02:04:29,111 --> 02:04:29,944
There was a lot of shit.

4206
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:34,530
It was a covert economic operation and uh,

4207
02:04:35,490 --> 02:04:37,090
and there it was being investigated.

4208
02:04:37,150 --> 02:04:37,960
I mean,

4209
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:38,140
how

4210
02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:41,530
many people would have to be
involved in something like that?

4211
02:04:41,531 --> 02:04:44,820
And they blew that office up there
was at that office and tower six,

4212
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:45,700
it wasn't even Taiwan.

4213
02:04:45,850 --> 02:04:47,260
A bomb goes off and tower six.

4214
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:47,861
It was that off.

4215
02:04:47,861 --> 02:04:48,694
They just blew it up.

4216
02:04:49,130 --> 02:04:52,120
Or do you think would have to be
involved in something like that?

4217
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:53,673
How would they,

4218
02:04:53,770 --> 02:04:54,700
how would they do this?

4219
02:04:54,701 --> 02:04:55,810
Would they do it through emails?

4220
02:04:55,811 --> 02:04:56,050
Yeah,

4221
02:04:56,050 --> 02:04:57,490
according to this theory.

4222
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:57,821
Okay.

4223
02:04:57,821 --> 02:04:58,720
According to this theory,

4224
02:04:58,721 --> 02:04:59,620
I don't know what's true or not.

4225
02:04:59,621 --> 02:05:00,454
I'm just reading these things.

4226
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:01,630
According to this theory,

4227
02:05:01,870 --> 02:05:06,490
it was all about they had to get rid of
these brokerages and the people naval

4228
02:05:06,491 --> 02:05:10,060
intelligence and the Eldorado task force
because they were about to investigate

4229
02:05:10,061 --> 02:05:12,340
at the 10 year cause
our 10 years securities,

4230
02:05:12,580 --> 02:05:13,361
whatever that means.

4231
02:05:13,361 --> 02:05:17,620
They're like bonds or something or CDs
or something worth over 240 million.

4232
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:19,780
That's what the investigation was about.

4233
02:05:20,020 --> 02:05:20,711
They finally,

4234
02:05:20,711 --> 02:05:21,210
we're going to,

4235
02:05:21,210 --> 02:05:21,930
uh,

4236
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:23,980
there's still only like AIG is,

4237
02:05:24,340 --> 02:05:25,173
is,

4238
02:05:27,080 --> 02:05:27,260
oh,

4239
02:05:27,260 --> 02:05:28,970
supposedly according to this theory,

4240
02:05:29,120 --> 02:05:29,990
Aig,

4241
02:05:30,050 --> 02:05:31,320
that insurance company will,

4242
02:05:31,321 --> 02:05:32,570
they're more than just insurance.

4243
02:05:32,571 --> 02:05:34,100
Like they're involved in all,

4244
02:05:34,220 --> 02:05:36,680
they got CIA ties and all this crazy shit.

4245
02:05:36,890 --> 02:05:37,820
They had to cover it up.

4246
02:05:37,940 --> 02:05:38,450
They had,

4247
02:05:38,450 --> 02:05:39,770
this is according to this theory,

4248
02:05:39,890 --> 02:05:44,890
they needed a blow all that shit up so
there's transactions could slide through

4249
02:05:45,381 --> 02:05:49,460
during the chaos and they wouldn't because
the Federal Reserve at nine one one,

4250
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:49,971
they,

4251
02:05:49,971 --> 02:05:50,271
they,

4252
02:05:50,271 --> 02:05:50,540
uh,

4253
02:05:50,540 --> 02:05:52,640
they took executive like emergency power.

4254
02:05:52,730 --> 02:05:55,130
So that day they took emergency parts
so they can do whatever they want.

4255
02:05:55,370 --> 02:05:58,280
The security and Exchange
Commission they did.

4256
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:00,770
They had an emergency um,

4257
02:06:00,940 --> 02:06:01,250
uh,

4258
02:06:01,250 --> 02:06:02,930
procedure that they've never done before,

4259
02:06:02,931 --> 02:06:05,420
which meant that we got
a lot of chaos here.

4260
02:06:05,480 --> 02:06:08,780
Let's just run all the securities
without checking them and just run these

4261
02:06:08,781 --> 02:06:09,590
through Pam.

4262
02:06:09,590 --> 02:06:10,423
That's what they did.

4263
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:11,690
So that's a theory.

4264
02:06:11,691 --> 02:06:14,210
Who knows if it's true but it
sounds pretty fucking crazy.

4265
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:15,290
I don't know if he did that.

4266
02:06:15,291 --> 02:06:19,640
So I think speculating about us but
what I do know is that a lot of people

4267
02:06:19,641 --> 02:06:24,110
banked on those airlines fucking up and
they like it's sold allow their shares.

4268
02:06:24,111 --> 02:06:27,470
Like they knew some things were going
at like huge significant numbers on

4269
02:06:27,471 --> 02:06:28,340
American Airlines.

4270
02:06:28,341 --> 02:06:30,620
They shorter their stocks is that alone.

4271
02:06:30,621 --> 02:06:32,360
It's like really squirrely.

4272
02:06:32,361 --> 02:06:34,370
Like let off fuck that.

4273
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:35,210
That alone,

4274
02:06:35,210 --> 02:06:38,120
if it is true and
apparently it is that the,

4275
02:06:38,121 --> 02:06:43,121
I feel like that should be like a big
point of investigation and if it is true

4276
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:48,340
and I've seen it reported in multiple
supposedly valid websites that the deal

4277
02:06:48,351 --> 02:06:49,184
with the news,

4278
02:06:49,220 --> 02:06:50,120
if that is true,

4279
02:06:50,230 --> 02:06:53,210
like this is just the fact that
that hasn't been investigated.

4280
02:06:53,211 --> 02:06:54,044
It makes you just go,

4281
02:06:54,170 --> 02:06:55,440
how many is meant cradle?

4282
02:06:55,730 --> 02:07:00,730
How many people can be involved in it if
we really have a really crazy sort of a

4283
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:08,040
fake democracy and they're just stealing
and engineering shit and blowing shit

4284
02:07:08,201 --> 02:07:12,070
up on occasion taken people have to be
involved and how come nobody wants to rat

4285
02:07:12,071 --> 02:07:12,371
him out?

4286
02:07:12,371 --> 02:07:16,010
How come nobody wants to make like the
ultimate book from the shadows and then

4287
02:07:16,180 --> 02:07:18,070
they're going right to Afghanistan,

4288
02:07:18,071 --> 02:07:19,210
taken all the heroin.

4289
02:07:19,430 --> 02:07:21,010
C'Mon gangsters,

4290
02:07:21,011 --> 02:07:21,311
dude,

4291
02:07:21,311 --> 02:07:22,030
it's amazing.

4292
02:07:22,030 --> 02:07:22,421
It's so,

4293
02:07:22,421 --> 02:07:23,290
everyone just accepts.

4294
02:07:23,291 --> 02:07:24,370
It was so amazing.

4295
02:07:24,371 --> 02:07:25,091
It feels fake.

4296
02:07:25,091 --> 02:07:30,091
But I think that part of the thing is
that they did it this way for so long that

4297
02:07:32,111 --> 02:07:36,100
that became how you did things
and then when the came along

4298
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:37,330
and all of a sudden people go,

4299
02:07:37,331 --> 02:07:38,110
wait a minute,

4300
02:07:38,110 --> 02:07:39,370
what the fuck are they doing?

4301
02:07:39,550 --> 02:07:41,650
They can do that and they could do this.

4302
02:07:41,750 --> 02:07:44,920
Like who would have found out about the
national defense authorization act and

4303
02:07:44,921 --> 02:07:48,520
the indefinite detention of American
civilians without right to trow.

4304
02:07:48,521 --> 02:07:49,480
Who to found out about that?

4305
02:07:49,481 --> 02:07:50,380
If it wasn't for the Internet,

4306
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:52,180
of course you wouldn't
have found out it from CNN.

4307
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:55,360
You don't even find out about
it from cnn.com when people say,

4308
02:07:55,450 --> 02:07:56,050
when people say,

4309
02:07:56,050 --> 02:07:56,261
Oh,

4310
02:07:56,261 --> 02:07:57,960
where do you get your information?

4311
02:07:57,970 --> 02:07:58,721
The Internet,

4312
02:07:58,721 --> 02:08:01,980
like what are you go fucking libraries
when going to go to fucking lie.

4313
02:08:02,070 --> 02:08:02,903
You go to the library,

4314
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:03,851
you're fucking 12,

4315
02:08:03,851 --> 02:08:04,720
you're going to the library,

4316
02:08:04,870 --> 02:08:05,260
you go,

4317
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:06,220
you go on your computer,

4318
02:08:06,221 --> 02:08:06,671
dumb ass.

4319
02:08:06,671 --> 02:08:08,320
Everyone gets their
information from the inner,

4320
02:08:08,330 --> 02:08:08,450
well,

4321
02:08:08,450 --> 02:08:10,900
that's where it gets really weird though
because you've got to make sure that

4322
02:08:10,901 --> 02:08:12,250
you really trust your sources.

4323
02:08:12,490 --> 02:08:13,151
So there's like,

4324
02:08:13,151 --> 02:08:14,650
there's some sources that you know,

4325
02:08:14,710 --> 02:08:15,543
like man,

4326
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:15,821
you know,

4327
02:08:15,821 --> 02:08:16,090
like,

4328
02:08:16,090 --> 02:08:20,740
like there's like in England they
have the daily mail and now they're,

4329
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:21,940
those motherfuckers were right.

4330
02:08:21,941 --> 02:08:22,770
Anything,

4331
02:08:22,770 --> 02:08:26,050
you could get an article and it's from
the Daily Mail and you've got to go,

4332
02:08:26,051 --> 02:08:26,830
uh,

4333
02:08:26,830 --> 02:08:27,611
wait a minute.

4334
02:08:27,611 --> 02:08:28,540
The Daily Mail,

4335
02:08:28,541 --> 02:08:29,110
shit,

4336
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:30,220
it might be real,

4337
02:08:30,221 --> 02:08:31,240
but it might be bullshit.

4338
02:08:31,241 --> 02:08:32,340
Listen to amber lions.

4339
02:08:32,430 --> 02:08:33,150
You know,

4340
02:08:33,150 --> 02:08:34,780
we have proof through amber lines.

4341
02:08:34,781 --> 02:08:35,614
We have proof.

4342
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:37,930
Did everything we see on CNN.

4343
02:08:38,110 --> 02:08:39,040
You got to question it.

4344
02:08:39,070 --> 02:08:40,120
You got to question everything.

4345
02:08:40,121 --> 02:08:41,470
You can't ever trust the government.

4346
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:41,711
Well,

4347
02:08:41,711 --> 02:08:42,760
it's a businessman.

4348
02:08:43,070 --> 02:08:44,530
They're running a show.

4349
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:45,970
Those new shows,

4350
02:08:45,971 --> 02:08:47,290
they check them for ratings.

4351
02:08:47,410 --> 02:08:50,110
They want to make sure that people are
tuning in and if they're not tuning in to

4352
02:08:50,111 --> 02:08:54,490
replace a girl and move a guy and
do this or do that to amber lions,

4353
02:08:54,630 --> 02:08:55,840
that it's more than that.

4354
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:56,890
It's not just about ratings,

4355
02:08:56,891 --> 02:08:58,120
it's about their certain shit.

4356
02:08:58,121 --> 02:08:59,170
They fucking say,

4357
02:08:59,290 --> 02:09:00,190
well this is what I'm saying.

4358
02:09:00,191 --> 02:09:01,090
It's a business.

4359
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:01,961
And you know,

4360
02:09:01,961 --> 02:09:04,120
if you're in the business of of news,

4361
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:05,110
there's only way,

4362
02:09:05,350 --> 02:09:07,270
the one way you get access to that news.

4363
02:09:07,271 --> 02:09:07,511
You know,

4364
02:09:07,511 --> 02:09:10,900
you have to be able to go to countries
you have to be able to do as soon as you

4365
02:09:10,901 --> 02:09:11,141
like,

4366
02:09:11,141 --> 02:09:12,160
piss those people off.

4367
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:12,341
They,

4368
02:09:12,341 --> 02:09:13,480
you can't get in there anymore.

4369
02:09:13,481 --> 02:09:14,030
You're done.

4370
02:09:14,030 --> 02:09:15,480
[inaudible] removed from this.

4371
02:09:15,481 --> 02:09:17,230
So he can't go to Congress
anymore like this.

4372
02:09:17,231 --> 02:09:18,160
People to this day,

4373
02:09:18,161 --> 02:09:23,161
I'm sure that have websites or what
people that you know want to get press

4374
02:09:23,381 --> 02:09:24,670
passes for certain things.

4375
02:09:24,671 --> 02:09:28,930
They want to be able to get into areas
where the New York Times and the Wall

4376
02:09:28,930 --> 02:09:29,950
Street Journal get to
and they can't get in.

4377
02:09:30,130 --> 02:09:31,120
Just because you have a website,

4378
02:09:31,121 --> 02:09:32,230
there's a million hits a day.

4379
02:09:32,231 --> 02:09:33,920
It doesn't mean that they're
going to let you into the,

4380
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:37,720
you can't like lob questions at the
president just because you have a big

4381
02:09:37,721 --> 02:09:38,554
antenna,

4382
02:09:38,770 --> 02:09:40,570
but it really should be that way.

4383
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:40,871
I mean,

4384
02:09:40,871 --> 02:09:43,060
if a guy has a big antenna
that means like Perez Hilton,

4385
02:09:43,061 --> 02:09:46,150
she'd be able to ask the
president questions then why not?

4386
02:09:46,151 --> 02:09:48,730
Perez Hilton's got millions
of fucking hits every day.

4387
02:09:48,850 --> 02:09:49,683
Why not him?

4388
02:09:49,740 --> 02:09:53,470
I'm asking him feel like he would have
probably questions more along the lines

4389
02:09:53,471 --> 02:09:56,620
of how I would think that a lot of these
fucking Weirdos that you see that he'd

4390
02:09:56,621 --> 02:09:58,990
get elected to Congress and
get elected to the Senate.

4391
02:09:59,290 --> 02:09:59,800
Well you like,

4392
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:00,160
like,

4393
02:10:00,160 --> 02:10:02,770
like that dude that was
trying to be a president,

4394
02:10:02,771 --> 02:10:03,550
Paul Ryan,

4395
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:05,110
the dude was running for vice president.

4396
02:10:05,320 --> 02:10:06,153
That's silly bitch.

4397
02:10:06,370 --> 02:10:08,350
Did you pay attention to
him and all pay attention?

4398
02:10:08,380 --> 02:10:09,490
Oh my goodness.

4399
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:10,413
The Mitt Romney guy.

4400
02:10:10,450 --> 02:10:11,283
Yeah.

4401
02:10:11,370 --> 02:10:11,981
Well his,

4402
02:10:11,981 --> 02:10:13,390
his running mate.

4403
02:10:13,391 --> 02:10:13,960
First of all,

4404
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:14,710
he was,

4405
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:17,590
he lied about like how fast
he could run a marathon,

4406
02:10:18,130 --> 02:10:18,641
like you said,

4407
02:10:18,641 --> 02:10:19,510
around American man,

4408
02:10:19,540 --> 02:10:22,630
like a three hour plus sub
sub four hour marathon,

4409
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:25,280
which apparently is like world class.

4410
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:29,500
Like you have to be like a serious fucking
athlete to be able to run a marathon

4411
02:10:29,530 --> 02:10:32,590
in under four hours and then
he changed it afterwards.

4412
02:10:32,591 --> 02:10:33,110
Like days.

4413
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:34,240
I was like six hours.

4414
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:34,581
One hour.

4415
02:10:34,581 --> 02:10:35,414
Yeah.

4416
02:10:35,450 --> 02:10:37,370
They probably picked him
because he was terrible.

4417
02:10:37,371 --> 02:10:38,090
They call up,

4418
02:10:38,090 --> 02:10:40,400
get it get wasn't it Paul Ryan?

4419
02:10:40,970 --> 02:10:41,121
Well,

4420
02:10:41,121 --> 02:10:41,954
he's a good speaker.

4421
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:43,410
He's a good speaker and a,

4422
02:10:43,430 --> 02:10:44,480
he was pretty charismatic.

4423
02:10:44,660 --> 02:10:47,810
The real problem is under the really
bright lights he folded and the really

4424
02:10:47,811 --> 02:10:48,261
bright lights.

4425
02:10:48,261 --> 02:10:49,910
He just bullshitted a little too much.

4426
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:51,080
Got a little too cocky,

4427
02:10:51,170 --> 02:10:52,820
some shit that you get a set in Idaho.

4428
02:10:52,821 --> 02:10:54,800
He got away with it on the local news.

4429
02:10:55,010 --> 02:10:57,860
You really can't get away with that
shit when it's on Fox News and everybody

4430
02:10:58,040 --> 02:10:58,561
research.

4431
02:10:58,561 --> 02:10:59,510
What the fuck you say?

4432
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:01,580
Whoever put him in that position.

4433
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:03,280
I knew that about him.

4434
02:11:03,290 --> 02:11:03,441
Like,

4435
02:11:03,441 --> 02:11:04,120
oh,

4436
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:06,240
it's no one else.

4437
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:06,921
John Mccain.

4438
02:11:06,921 --> 02:11:07,754
When John Mccain,

4439
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:08,623
I think,

4440
02:11:09,020 --> 02:11:09,853
you know,

4441
02:11:11,090 --> 02:11:14,450
the world is one by corporations
and Wall Street and all that.

4442
02:11:14,451 --> 02:11:15,770
They have all the goddamn power.

4443
02:11:15,950 --> 02:11:16,540
They're fucking,

4444
02:11:16,540 --> 02:11:17,040
yeah,

4445
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:20,270
I mean when you can try to try and get
a guy like Paul Ryan into position,

4446
02:11:20,271 --> 02:11:22,070
they do it because it
seems like it would work.

4447
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:23,150
He's going to listen to us.

4448
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:23,601
He,

4449
02:11:23,601 --> 02:11:23,961
you know,

4450
02:11:23,961 --> 02:11:26,000
he's going to play ball and it'll work.

4451
02:11:26,150 --> 02:11:26,390
You know?

4452
02:11:26,390 --> 02:11:26,930
I mean that's,

4453
02:11:26,930 --> 02:11:27,763
that's,

4454
02:11:27,820 --> 02:11:28,700
but to me,

4455
02:11:28,701 --> 02:11:30,680
I'm just throwing this
out that who the fuck?

4456
02:11:30,681 --> 02:11:30,801
No,

4457
02:11:30,801 --> 02:11:33,080
so you're looking for a
conspiracy in the conspiracy.

4458
02:11:33,170 --> 02:11:35,750
I'm thinking John Mccain and Sarah Palin,

4459
02:11:35,990 --> 02:11:36,860
John Mccain aside,

4460
02:11:36,900 --> 02:11:38,180
it's like get mother.

4461
02:11:38,270 --> 02:11:40,760
There's no way that
dude who's about to die,

4462
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:43,460
it's going to become president and
then then we put a crazy bitch as vice

4463
02:11:43,461 --> 02:11:44,090
president.

4464
02:11:44,090 --> 02:11:45,750
It almost seems like we need Obama to,

4465
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:46,461
to win,

4466
02:11:46,461 --> 02:11:49,420
to handle all this shit took us all up.

4467
02:11:49,450 --> 02:11:49,820
That's,

4468
02:11:49,820 --> 02:11:51,170
that's one way I'm looking at it.

4469
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:52,430
This is the way I looked at it.

4470
02:11:52,460 --> 02:11:55,670
I think that in order to get
to any position of power,

4471
02:11:55,910 --> 02:11:58,190
whether you're a senator or congressman,

4472
02:11:58,220 --> 02:12:00,080
when by the time you get there,

4473
02:12:00,081 --> 02:12:04,740
you got so many motherfucking
skeletons in your closet that you like.

4474
02:12:04,741 --> 02:12:07,970
Teddy Kennedy never could really run for
president after he drowned that girl.

4475
02:12:08,270 --> 02:12:10,820
And there's a lot of
shit that these dudes do.

4476
02:12:10,850 --> 02:12:11,061
Fuck.

4477
02:12:11,061 --> 02:12:11,161
Yeah,

4478
02:12:11,161 --> 02:12:15,200
so it's hard to find a guy who was
pretty clean and Paul Ryan pretty clean,

4479
02:12:15,320 --> 02:12:16,820
seems like a nice family man,

4480
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:20,720
says a lot of shit about taking personal
responsibility toes the republican

4481
02:12:20,721 --> 02:12:21,554
line.

4482
02:12:21,620 --> 02:12:21,831
Look,

4483
02:12:21,831 --> 02:12:22,341
the guy looks,

4484
02:12:22,341 --> 02:12:23,180
he looks fit.

4485
02:12:23,181 --> 02:12:26,000
He looks like a man's man and
yet have you had done marathons,

4486
02:12:26,001 --> 02:12:26,340
Paul?

4487
02:12:26,340 --> 02:12:27,680
I did a marathon in under four hours.

4488
02:12:27,770 --> 02:12:29,960
He did a marathon in under four hours.

4489
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:32,840
He's our guy and then they get in
there and they find out the guy's a

4490
02:12:32,841 --> 02:12:33,470
bullshitter.

4491
02:12:33,470 --> 02:12:34,790
I think it's more likely that,

4492
02:12:35,060 --> 02:12:38,660
but I do agree that in order
to get to that position,

4493
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:40,040
they,

4494
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:42,440
they got to think that they
can do something with you.

4495
02:12:42,530 --> 02:12:44,750
They got to think that you're going
to be able to play ball with them.

4496
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:46,760
And a girl like Sarah Palin,

4497
02:12:46,940 --> 02:12:49,010
they went with her because they were,

4498
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:50,300
they were desperate.

4499
02:12:50,510 --> 02:12:51,440
There was no one else.

4500
02:12:51,650 --> 02:12:53,120
They didn't know what
the fuck they were doing,

4501
02:12:53,121 --> 02:12:53,670
man.

4502
02:12:53,670 --> 02:12:56,900
They were trying to figure out
some way to reach women voters.

4503
02:12:57,140 --> 02:13:02,140
And one of the best ways is to have a
strong woman that represents women and you

4504
02:13:02,421 --> 02:13:02,571
know,

4505
02:13:02,571 --> 02:13:06,440
she represented the strongest
aspects of like a frontiers woman.

4506
02:13:06,620 --> 02:13:07,880
Bitch lives in Alaska.

4507
02:13:08,090 --> 02:13:08,880
Okay.

4508
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:10,490
Just got big old titties and a gun.

4509
02:13:10,940 --> 02:13:13,400
Like they thought women were
going to go bananas for that,

4510
02:13:13,430 --> 02:13:16,970
that women and they'll go yes and that
would be enough to push them over the

4511
02:13:16,971 --> 02:13:17,300
top.

4512
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:21,170
They would get all the women votes the
same way Obama got a lot of the black

4513
02:13:21,171 --> 02:13:21,650
vote.

4514
02:13:21,650 --> 02:13:22,610
Like a lot of people were like,

4515
02:13:22,611 --> 02:13:24,530
there's no way I'm not
voting against Obama.

4516
02:13:24,620 --> 02:13:25,610
And people got mad.

4517
02:13:25,611 --> 02:13:28,460
Black people got mad at other black
people that were gonna vote for Mccain.

4518
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:34,260
You never saw anybody that was black
that had a fucking a Paul Ryan Shirt on,

4519
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:34,960
you know?

4520
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:36,090
No one had a Mitt Romney,

4521
02:13:36,091 --> 02:13:37,260
Paul Ryan shirt on.

4522
02:13:37,261 --> 02:13:38,710
That was by maybe a few dudes.

4523
02:13:38,711 --> 02:13:39,810
And just wanted attention.

4524
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:41,260
But if they really thought it through,

4525
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:42,480
there's no way they would have done that.

4526
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:44,130
Just seems like a big show to me.

4527
02:13:44,190 --> 02:13:45,790
It seems like it's all
like a regional edition.

4528
02:13:45,970 --> 02:13:46,803
A big show.

4529
02:13:47,070 --> 02:13:48,030
Almost scripted.

4530
02:13:48,150 --> 02:13:48,983
Well it's a big chunk.

4531
02:13:49,170 --> 02:13:50,370
You know that because they don't,

4532
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:52,140
they don't have any more
than two candidates.

4533
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:55,680
They used to let extra
candidates in when they,

4534
02:13:55,770 --> 02:13:57,570
last time they did that
was with Ross Perot.

4535
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:01,350
He was the last independent and
that guy fucked everything up man.

4536
02:14:01,530 --> 02:14:01,980
Cause he,

4537
02:14:01,980 --> 02:14:04,320
he got his own television show,

4538
02:14:04,470 --> 02:14:08,280
he took over NBC like during prime time.

4539
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:11,490
He bought the time and he
went on and told everybody,

4540
02:14:11,491 --> 02:14:12,450
how are you getting fucked?

4541
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:14,450
Told everybody what the Federal Bank is.

4542
02:14:14,550 --> 02:14:18,300
And he told everybody where taxes go
and told everybody that's insurmountable

4543
02:14:18,301 --> 02:14:20,460
debt and this is how
you've been set up and you,

4544
02:14:21,330 --> 02:14:22,770
and he did it on television.

4545
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:26,490
And because of the fact that he had so
much money that he could get away with

4546
02:14:26,491 --> 02:14:29,940
doing shit that traditionally only the
Democrats and the Republicans could do.

4547
02:14:30,180 --> 02:14:32,550
But all of a sudden there's this
independent that's like stealing,

4548
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:33,001
you know,

4549
02:14:33,001 --> 02:14:33,391
20,

4550
02:14:33,391 --> 02:14:36,270
30% of the vote and it
fucked up the whole thing.

4551
02:14:36,450 --> 02:14:39,900
And that's how Bill Clinton became
president because they're like,

4552
02:14:40,820 --> 02:14:41,790
and there you go.

4553
02:14:41,850 --> 02:14:42,391
That guy,

4554
02:14:42,391 --> 02:14:43,200
he ruined everything.

4555
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:45,210
So then the commission
for presidential debates,

4556
02:14:45,211 --> 02:14:47,880
they changed what it takes to,

4557
02:14:47,881 --> 02:14:48,270
uh,

4558
02:14:48,270 --> 02:14:51,690
to be able to compete
at the highest levels.

4559
02:14:51,691 --> 02:14:52,200
Hell yeah,

4560
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:52,500
you,

4561
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:53,071
you couldn't,

4562
02:14:53,071 --> 02:14:53,371
you know,

4563
02:14:53,371 --> 02:14:56,130
they'll let a lot of kooks like
when you have like Republicans,

4564
02:14:56,131 --> 02:14:57,210
you have like 10 Republicans,

4565
02:14:57,390 --> 02:15:01,020
they'll let the heroin canes and that
they know Herman Cain like that dude fucks

4566
02:15:01,021 --> 02:15:01,561
everything.

4567
02:15:01,561 --> 02:15:03,480
He's got like 50 bitches on the side.

4568
02:15:03,481 --> 02:15:06,000
He just couldn't keep them from
bubbling up under the woodwork.

4569
02:15:06,310 --> 02:15:06,960
You know,

4570
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:07,660
the guy who ran a,

4571
02:15:07,660 --> 02:15:11,100
he ran the pizza company and you see all
the different women that came out and

4572
02:15:11,101 --> 02:15:11,934
said he was,

4573
02:15:12,180 --> 02:15:13,013
he was banging them.

4574
02:15:14,220 --> 02:15:14,880
No,

4575
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:16,560
well you can't do that
and run for president.

4576
02:15:16,561 --> 02:15:18,480
Like you can do that and
brought a pizza company.

4577
02:15:18,510 --> 02:15:19,980
He totally did it and pulled it off.

4578
02:15:20,190 --> 02:15:22,050
But they know certain shit like that.

4579
02:15:22,051 --> 02:15:23,610
They know guys like not
going to get that far.

4580
02:15:23,610 --> 02:15:26,640
It's a little song and dance until
they get down to the main guy.

4581
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:30,360
And there was a couple of main guys and
the big main guy was this Mitt Romney

4582
02:15:30,361 --> 02:15:30,930
character.

4583
02:15:30,930 --> 02:15:31,560
Is that Sarah.

4584
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:34,770
It's like it was always going to happen
the way this way and all the people that

4585
02:15:34,771 --> 02:15:35,970
are in place behind the scenes,

4586
02:15:35,971 --> 02:15:37,290
they all watch it all play out,

4587
02:15:37,291 --> 02:15:41,370
but it doesn't matter who wins the same
people are paying those people socially.

4588
02:15:41,371 --> 02:15:43,110
I think we're better off
with a guy like Obama.

4589
02:15:43,810 --> 02:15:44,101
You know?

4590
02:15:44,101 --> 02:15:45,300
I think it gives people hope.

4591
02:15:45,330 --> 02:15:45,601
You know,

4592
02:15:45,601 --> 02:15:48,540
he's a young black guy from a single mom.

4593
02:15:48,750 --> 02:15:50,460
You know that that makes
people feel better.

4594
02:15:50,461 --> 02:15:51,990
It makes people believe that hey,

4595
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:52,471
you know,

4596
02:15:52,471 --> 02:15:55,440
maybe that racism shit is
kind of in the past and maybe,

4597
02:15:55,441 --> 02:15:56,100
you know,

4598
02:15:56,100 --> 02:15:56,750
look man,

4599
02:15:56,750 --> 02:16:00,440
if racism didn't stop a black man
from being president like you,

4600
02:16:00,470 --> 02:16:01,740
it's surmountable.

4601
02:16:01,741 --> 02:16:02,760
You can overcome this.

4602
02:16:02,970 --> 02:16:04,890
Like this is good example for the culture.

4603
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:09,810
The real problem is that dude does a
lot of the same shit that pushed it.

4604
02:16:10,110 --> 02:16:11,130
That's the real problem.

4605
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:13,170
We thought we were going to
get this dude who's like us,

4606
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:15,180
but they're still using drones.

4607
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:18,240
They still got Guantanamo
Bay trying to take our guns.

4608
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:21,120
That's shit is predict all
that shit is ridiculous.

4609
02:16:21,121 --> 02:16:23,580
All that clamping down
on rights and going,

4610
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:24,481
there's not,

4611
02:16:24,481 --> 02:16:24,871
there's not.

4612
02:16:24,871 --> 02:16:25,704
That's not a problem.

4613
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:26,640
Put your finger in the air,

4614
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:27,451
Dee Dee,

4615
02:16:27,451 --> 02:16:29,070
do you see revolution?

4616
02:16:29,110 --> 02:16:30,010
Do you see problems

4617
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:30,843
in the streets?

4618
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Do you see rampant violence everywhere
and our children are unsafe now that's

4619
02:16:36,431 --> 02:16:39,250
not what's happening is that massive
terrorist attacks on America.

4620
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:41,230
Why do you need to like
look at people's email?

4621
02:16:41,380 --> 02:16:44,050
Like why do you need to store
every phone call that's ever made?

4622
02:16:44,260 --> 02:16:44,560
Like,

4623
02:16:44,560 --> 02:16:45,130
no,

4624
02:16:45,130 --> 02:16:47,530
don't assume that everyone's fucking crib.

4625
02:16:47,531 --> 02:16:51,920
It'll cause in reality most people
are pretty fucking cool the most.

4626
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:56,260
The vast majority of people are pretty
fucking cool and for you to ruin that

4627
02:16:56,261 --> 02:17:00,400
shit and take it away and take
all the fun away out of life,

4628
02:17:00,550 --> 02:17:04,960
just because there's a certain unavoidable
percentage of douchebags in the world

4629
02:17:05,080 --> 02:17:06,040
is ridiculous.

4630
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:08,230
Knowing all the fucked up shit.

4631
02:17:08,231 --> 02:17:09,850
The government's been like people high,

4632
02:17:10,060 --> 02:17:10,930
high in the government.

4633
02:17:10,931 --> 02:17:13,300
I'm not talking about your
average congressman or anything,

4634
02:17:13,301 --> 02:17:15,850
but the people that are
really running shit,

4635
02:17:16,570 --> 02:17:17,770
knowing all the fucked up,

4636
02:17:17,771 --> 02:17:19,030
they shit they've done,

4637
02:17:19,250 --> 02:17:22,290
the JFK staff and all that
Gulf of Tonkin wouldn't.

4638
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:24,670
Do you think the liberties that are,

4639
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:26,650
they're taking from us on a daily basis?

4640
02:17:26,770 --> 02:17:28,210
You think that's part of a plan?

4641
02:17:28,211 --> 02:17:29,830
It just seems they're
so aggressive with it.

4642
02:17:29,980 --> 02:17:34,980
I think they worry about any sort of an
uprising and the best way to keep any

4643
02:17:35,801 --> 02:17:39,010
sort of an uprising from coming to
fruition is to nip it in the bud.

4644
02:17:39,580 --> 02:17:42,010
And when you're in a position of power,

4645
02:17:42,100 --> 02:17:42,491
especially,

4646
02:17:42,491 --> 02:17:44,200
it's an undeserved position of power.

4647
02:17:44,201 --> 02:17:47,920
If it turns out that you're using your
money to influence politicians and

4648
02:17:47,921 --> 02:17:48,370
you're,

4649
02:17:48,370 --> 02:17:51,790
you're manipulating the system in order
to gain an advantage so that it helps

4650
02:17:51,791 --> 02:17:55,480
your business and all that
stuff is exposed well that,

4651
02:17:55,481 --> 02:17:56,800
that that should be a crime.

4652
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:59,560
That should be way worse
than insider trading.

4653
02:17:59,710 --> 02:18:00,221
That should be.

4654
02:18:00,221 --> 02:18:00,791
But meanwhile,

4655
02:18:00,791 --> 02:18:02,530
it's standard operational procedure.

4656
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:05,890
And when there's any
sort of a threat to that,

4657
02:18:05,891 --> 02:18:08,440
they're going to try to
stop that threat in advance.

4658
02:18:08,470 --> 02:18:11,710
And one of the best ways to stop
that threat and advance it's fear.

4659
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:14,290
Make people scared to speak out,

4660
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:15,730
make people scared to act.

4661
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:20,140
And one of the best ways to make people
scared is to give yourself God like

4662
02:18:20,141 --> 02:18:20,920
powers.

4663
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:22,270
Give yourself the ability to just,

4664
02:18:22,271 --> 02:18:27,271
I can take this person and lock them in
that cage and never let them out ever.

4665
02:18:28,030 --> 02:18:29,770
And that's what the NDA says.

4666
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:31,330
That's crazy.

4667
02:18:31,530 --> 02:18:33,580
Cause even Hitler would've got a trial.

4668
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:34,240
Okay.

4669
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:38,380
If we had captured Hitler and supposedly
in no Searle soldier had gone crazy and

4670
02:18:38,381 --> 02:18:39,214
shot him in the head,

4671
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:40,450
which is probably unlikely,

4672
02:18:40,451 --> 02:18:41,770
they probably would have
shot him just like they did.

4673
02:18:41,771 --> 02:18:42,604
Kadafi right.

4674
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:44,170
But if we did capture him,

4675
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:45,610
they would have given Hitler a trial.

4676
02:18:46,060 --> 02:18:48,520
And what they're saying is you,

4677
02:18:48,550 --> 02:18:51,400
this average person that
they decide to detain,

4678
02:18:51,610 --> 02:18:56,610
they can choose to use tactics on you
that they would have used that Hitler,

4679
02:18:57,670 --> 02:19:00,160
they can choose to just
lock you up and definitely,

4680
02:19:00,161 --> 02:19:01,960
and not give you access to lawyers.

4681
02:19:02,410 --> 02:19:03,820
That's not good for anybody.

4682
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:06,010
And that's not American.

4683
02:19:06,130 --> 02:19:07,660
That's not what we're
supposed to be about.

4684
02:19:07,661 --> 02:19:09,220
And you can't have that kind of power.

4685
02:19:09,550 --> 02:19:12,250
And that's exactly what's
happening in Egypt right now.

4686
02:19:12,251 --> 02:19:12,491
You know,

4687
02:19:12,491 --> 02:19:16,930
they let this new dude in in Egypt and
now 200,000 people are rallying in the

4688
02:19:16,931 --> 02:19:21,931
streets trying to get this guy to get out
of office because he changed the laws.

4689
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:24,490
He made it so you can't arrest him.

4690
02:19:24,491 --> 02:19:25,890
He can't be tried for anything.

4691
02:19:25,900 --> 02:19:27,360
He just turned himself into a god.

4692
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:29,010
He just got in there and then they went,

4693
02:19:29,011 --> 02:19:29,611
fuck you.

4694
02:19:29,611 --> 02:19:29,911
We just,

4695
02:19:29,911 --> 02:19:31,080
we already been through this shit.

4696
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:31,261
No,

4697
02:19:31,261 --> 02:19:32,220
you can't do that.

4698
02:19:32,820 --> 02:19:37,820
They all get to the point of governing
and I think the possibility of being

4699
02:19:38,341 --> 02:19:42,360
overthrown by some completely new
organization is terrifying for them.

4700
02:19:42,690 --> 02:19:47,400
What if like the Green party all of a
sudden took off in this country and what

4701
02:19:47,401 --> 02:19:52,230
if it was like the Green Party became
the number one party in the country?

4702
02:19:52,410 --> 02:19:52,561
I mean,

4703
02:19:52,561 --> 02:19:52,850
look,

4704
02:19:52,850 --> 02:19:54,360
look how many people go to wholefoods?

4705
02:19:54,450 --> 02:19:55,020
Okay,

4706
02:19:55,020 --> 02:19:56,430
look how many people want to recycle.

4707
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:56,731
Like,

4708
02:19:56,731 --> 02:20:00,210
what does that shit spreads would've had
spreads and all of a sudden the Green

4709
02:20:00,211 --> 02:20:03,000
party becomes the prominent
party in this country.

4710
02:20:03,090 --> 02:20:06,630
When we realize that we're poisoning our
food and poison our water and poisoning

4711
02:20:06,631 --> 02:20:08,490
the ocean and killing all the fish.

4712
02:20:08,491 --> 02:20:11,400
And if they ever did get to that position,

4713
02:20:11,401 --> 02:20:14,880
that would be a terrible loss
of power for the Republicans,

4714
02:20:14,881 --> 02:20:17,250
the Democrats and all the
corporations that support them.

4715
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:20,220
If the public's opinion changed.

4716
02:20:20,460 --> 02:20:25,340
And people really did get behind a party
that was independent and not reliant

4717
02:20:25,350 --> 02:20:27,870
whatsoever on corporations,

4718
02:20:27,990 --> 02:20:30,090
that would be fucking terrifying
to the powers that be.

4719
02:20:30,091 --> 02:20:32,940
Instead of going around making billions
and billions of dollars a year,

4720
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:34,920
traveled around a fat yachts,

4721
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:36,053
you know,

4722
02:20:36,150 --> 02:20:38,490
banging supermodels and
then cut their heads off.

4723
02:20:38,610 --> 02:20:39,810
Instead of doing that,

4724
02:20:39,960 --> 02:20:41,610
you would make nothing.

4725
02:20:42,270 --> 02:20:43,830
You wouldn't be in power anymore.

4726
02:20:44,010 --> 02:20:47,190
Your corporations would have to stand up
on the merit of the products that they

4727
02:20:47,191 --> 02:20:47,850
sell,

4728
02:20:47,850 --> 02:20:52,850
not on your ability to change laws so
that you can make products cheaper and in

4729
02:20:53,671 --> 02:20:55,410
the meantime ruin the earth.

4730
02:20:56,010 --> 02:20:58,800
And that's a terrifying
thing for those fuck heads.

4731
02:20:58,950 --> 02:21:01,290
So what they try to do
is take away your rights,

4732
02:21:01,480 --> 02:21:03,090
take away your right to express yourself,

4733
02:21:03,300 --> 02:21:06,240
be able to come in and shut down
your website at any point in time.

4734
02:21:06,420 --> 02:21:07,440
No file sharing.

4735
02:21:07,441 --> 02:21:08,450
I don't what the fuck you're sending.

4736
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:08,640
No,

4737
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:08,771
no,

4738
02:21:08,771 --> 02:21:08,851
no.

4739
02:21:08,851 --> 02:21:09,750
I've got to look at that shit.

4740
02:21:09,970 --> 02:21:10,331
No,

4741
02:21:10,331 --> 02:21:10,551
no,

4742
02:21:10,551 --> 02:21:10,631
no,

4743
02:21:10,631 --> 02:21:10,741
no,

4744
02:21:10,741 --> 02:21:10,870
no,

4745
02:21:10,870 --> 02:21:10,971
no,

4746
02:21:10,971 --> 02:21:11,051
no,

4747
02:21:11,051 --> 02:21:11,161
no.

4748
02:21:11,161 --> 02:21:13,190
I gotta be able to look at
everybody's email at anytime.

4749
02:21:13,230 --> 02:21:14,790
This is a matter of national security.

4750
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,260
We are the government.

4751
02:21:16,261 --> 02:21:21,261
This is the Homeland Security Department
of security of the mothers and the

4752
02:21:21,541 --> 02:21:22,830
children of this country.

4753
02:21:23,070 --> 02:21:24,840
And I have to look at a few emails.

4754
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:25,551
I'm going to do it.

4755
02:21:25,551 --> 02:21:26,384
God Damn it.

4756
02:21:26,970 --> 02:21:28,440
And that's where we find ourselves.

4757
02:21:28,441 --> 02:21:32,880
We find ourselves in this ridiculous
position where we're clearly being run by

4758
02:21:32,900 --> 02:21:33,310
fuckheads.

4759
02:21:33,310 --> 02:21:38,130
How realistic is Texas from actually
seceding from the nation going to happen?

4760
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:40,080
There's no way it's not going to happen,

4761
02:21:40,740 --> 02:21:41,371
but meanwhile,

4762
02:21:41,371 --> 02:21:43,370
Texas doesn't give a fuck taxes.

4763
02:21:43,470 --> 02:21:47,880
They're supposedly constitutionally
being one of the few countries or cities

4764
02:21:47,881 --> 02:21:50,160
were con states states that can,

4765
02:21:50,280 --> 02:21:53,730
because I think technically they
view themselves as a republic.

4766
02:21:54,210 --> 02:21:54,670
You know,

4767
02:21:54,670 --> 02:21:57,540
I think maybe all other states do as well,

4768
02:21:57,660 --> 02:22:01,020
but from what I understood
the way they're the TX,

4769
02:22:01,050 --> 02:22:04,290
Texas state declaration or they're,

4770
02:22:04,310 --> 02:22:04,590
you know,

4771
02:22:04,590 --> 02:22:06,120
whatever the fuck their constitution is,

4772
02:22:06,121 --> 02:22:07,980
whatever the fuck that states have,

4773
02:22:08,180 --> 02:22:09,780
th th the defines themselves,

4774
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:13,050
they define themselves slightly
different than most dates and they,

4775
02:22:13,051 --> 02:22:13,201
uh,

4776
02:22:13,201 --> 02:22:15,240
they believe that they're
their own sort of situation.

4777
02:22:16,710 --> 02:22:17,440
You know,

4778
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:21,480
that all that shit came from Mexico
and all that was a Texas was Mexico,

4779
02:22:22,110 --> 02:22:23,460
California was Mexico.

4780
02:22:23,810 --> 02:22:25,080
I mean that wasn't that long ago.

4781
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:26,260
I mean everybody Sorta Kinda

4782
02:22:26,260 --> 02:22:27,280
forgot about that.

4783
02:22:27,650 --> 02:22:29,140
That shit was not that long ago.

4784
02:22:29,410 --> 02:22:30,070
Yeah,

4785
02:22:30,070 --> 02:22:31,360
it's Mexico was like,

4786
02:22:32,350 --> 02:22:36,490
there was like giant chunks of
America that was Mexico and be like,

4787
02:22:37,740 --> 02:22:38,573
MMM,

4788
02:22:38,620 --> 02:22:39,453
not anymore.

4789
02:22:39,730 --> 02:22:40,390
No Shit.

4790
02:22:40,390 --> 02:22:41,223
Nope,

4791
02:22:42,220 --> 02:22:43,053
nope.

4792
02:22:43,140 --> 02:22:45,730
Sexist became this weird sort of the spot,

4793
02:22:45,820 --> 02:22:46,570
man.

4794
02:22:46,570 --> 02:22:48,100
It's Texas legal,

4795
02:22:48,130 --> 02:22:48,930
medical marijuana,

4796
02:22:48,930 --> 02:22:49,530
nay.

4797
02:22:49,530 --> 02:22:50,380
I say,

4798
02:22:50,381 --> 02:22:50,860
no,

4799
02:22:50,860 --> 02:22:51,191
no,

4800
02:22:51,191 --> 02:22:51,431
no,

4801
02:22:51,431 --> 02:22:52,264
no,

4802
02:22:52,630 --> 02:22:52,871
no,

4803
02:22:52,871 --> 02:22:52,991
no,

4804
02:22:52,991 --> 02:22:53,111
no.

4805
02:22:53,111 --> 02:22:54,130
Austin's that strong enough.

4806
02:22:54,131 --> 02:22:54,611
No.

4807
02:22:54,611 --> 02:22:57,490
Austin is probably the best place,

4808
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:02,520
like socially and liberally
and intellectually.

4809
02:23:02,891 --> 02:23:05,430
It's one of the best places
in the country and it's,

4810
02:23:05,431 --> 02:23:09,190
it's the best place in Texas for
like free thinking or free thinkers,

4811
02:23:09,191 --> 02:23:10,300
open minded people.

4812
02:23:10,570 --> 02:23:11,050
Um,

4813
02:23:11,050 --> 02:23:11,980
well read people,

4814
02:23:11,981 --> 02:23:15,910
people that are hip people at turn tuned
in to what the fuck is going on in the

4815
02:23:15,911 --> 02:23:16,480
world.

4816
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:19,810
But they're surrounded by silly people.

4817
02:23:19,870 --> 02:23:20,111
You know,

4818
02:23:20,111 --> 02:23:20,381
there's,

4819
02:23:20,381 --> 02:23:23,620
there's people all around like the
middle of Texas and crazy places.

4820
02:23:23,940 --> 02:23:27,340
It's like a lot of like churches
and people are nutty and they're,

4821
02:23:27,341 --> 02:23:31,600
they're doing exorcisms and
it's like a sexist is a mix,

4822
02:23:31,780 --> 02:23:32,200
you know,

4823
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:33,300
it's a mix of really quick.

4824
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:35,560
Like Houston's really cool
at Dallas is really cool.

4825
02:23:35,561 --> 02:23:40,180
It's a mix of like a lot of really cool
spots and the spots when you drive to

4826
02:23:40,181 --> 02:23:44,790
the really cool spots and you go through
hours and hours of these backwoodsy

4827
02:23:44,791 --> 02:23:46,030
type towns and you're like,

4828
02:23:46,031 --> 02:23:47,070
Whoa,

4829
02:23:47,430 --> 02:23:48,190
Whoa,

4830
02:23:48,190 --> 02:23:49,570
what have you were born here?

4831
02:23:49,900 --> 02:23:51,100
What if you were born there?

4832
02:23:51,101 --> 02:23:52,210
And Eddie Bravo had to grow up.

4833
02:23:52,211 --> 02:23:52,690
They're like,

4834
02:23:52,690 --> 02:23:54,100
oh my God.

4835
02:23:54,420 --> 02:23:56,470
Like there's a lot of spots that soc,

4836
02:23:56,830 --> 02:23:59,380
and the problem is those
people get devote too.

4837
02:23:59,830 --> 02:24:02,470
So shit like medical
marijuana does not pass.

4838
02:24:02,740 --> 02:24:06,580
And the reason why it doesn't pass is
that civilization hasn't spread through

4839
02:24:06,581 --> 02:24:07,510
the entire state.

4840
02:24:07,990 --> 02:24:11,050
It's only in pockets of intensive course.

4841
02:24:11,060 --> 02:24:11,800
Yeah,

4842
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:12,820
I'm sure they've tried.

4843
02:24:12,821 --> 02:24:14,260
I'm sure someone's picked him.

4844
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:15,640
Forgive me if I'm wrong,

4845
02:24:15,880 --> 02:24:19,060
but I'm sure someone's tried to come
up with some sort of legislation,

4846
02:24:19,240 --> 02:24:20,840
but it's never been like
officially on the ballot.

4847
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:21,730
I don't know.

4848
02:24:21,730 --> 02:24:22,270
I don't know.

4849
02:24:22,270 --> 02:24:22,420
I'm,

4850
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:23,171
but I know that it,

4851
02:24:23,171 --> 02:24:23,411
uh,

4852
02:24:23,411 --> 02:24:24,910
it just lost in Oregon,

4853
02:24:24,911 --> 02:24:26,170
which was pretty surprising,

4854
02:24:26,440 --> 02:24:28,030
but it might sometimes it's the way the,

4855
02:24:28,031 --> 02:24:28,360
the,

4856
02:24:28,360 --> 02:24:30,550
the language is written on the law.

4857
02:24:30,700 --> 02:24:32,650
Like sometimes they get
stupid with the language,

4858
02:24:33,310 --> 02:24:34,143
you know,

4859
02:24:34,210 --> 02:24:35,620
and you can flip 16 year olds,

4860
02:24:35,621 --> 02:24:36,060
you know,

4861
02:24:36,060 --> 02:24:37,510
they throw something in,

4862
02:24:38,660 --> 02:24:39,493
be

4863
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:42,670
nice just to come back.

4864
02:24:43,810 --> 02:24:45,370
I don't know what the
language of the law was,

4865
02:24:45,371 --> 02:24:46,870
but I would've thought Oregon,

4866
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:47,160
you know,

4867
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:48,430
be in Portland and all that.

4868
02:24:48,431 --> 02:24:48,671
You know,

4869
02:24:48,671 --> 02:24:50,410
Portland is pretty fucking hip.

4870
02:24:50,940 --> 02:24:51,290
That's,

4871
02:24:51,290 --> 02:24:51,820
that's uh,

4872
02:24:51,820 --> 02:24:52,990
one of the spots I would live.

4873
02:24:53,560 --> 02:24:55,570
I would live in Portland if I,

4874
02:24:55,571 --> 02:24:56,081
if I had to,

4875
02:24:56,081 --> 02:24:57,640
for some reason to get out of California.

4876
02:24:57,660 --> 02:24:58,660
Portland is a good spot.

4877
02:24:58,830 --> 02:25:00,760
The very cool people
at things a lot though.

4878
02:25:00,820 --> 02:25:02,680
Rain's like a motherfucker
drove Salami back.

4879
02:25:03,110 --> 02:25:04,270
It's back to La.

4880
02:25:04,450 --> 02:25:05,050
Oh yeah.

4881
02:25:05,050 --> 02:25:05,471
Really?

4882
02:25:05,471 --> 02:25:07,810
He's been back for maybe four months.

4883
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:10,720
Motherfucker and when I see him I'm
going to shake him like a bad baby.

4884
02:25:10,930 --> 02:25:11,410
Cause when I,

4885
02:25:11,410 --> 02:25:12,520
when I talked to him up there,

4886
02:25:12,521 --> 02:25:12,881
I was like,

4887
02:25:12,881 --> 02:25:13,301
what's it like?

4888
02:25:13,301 --> 02:25:14,021
I really digging it.

4889
02:25:14,021 --> 02:25:14,231
He goes,

4890
02:25:14,231 --> 02:25:14,541
yeah man,

4891
02:25:14,541 --> 02:25:14,981
that's awesome.

4892
02:25:14,981 --> 02:25:15,491
I go to is the rain?

4893
02:25:15,491 --> 02:25:16,091
Everybody goes,

4894
02:25:16,091 --> 02:25:16,540
no,

4895
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:17,021
not at all.

4896
02:25:17,021 --> 02:25:17,680
Fuck it.

4897
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:18,011
He goes,

4898
02:25:18,011 --> 02:25:18,850
just so cool up here.

4899
02:25:18,851 --> 02:25:19,684
It doesn't bother me.

4900
02:25:19,690 --> 02:25:21,310
I got some events and Motherfucker,

4901
02:25:21,430 --> 02:25:23,440
I got c.W is a,

4902
02:25:23,530 --> 02:25:24,400
is that a chemical

4903
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:24,790
thing?

4904
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:26,920
Like do we need that
chemical from the sun?

4905
02:25:27,390 --> 02:25:28,660
Like in order to feel happy?

4906
02:25:28,690 --> 02:25:30,550
I've never lived in a place
where it rained all the time.

4907
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:34,150
Have you done that now you've all
your southern California whole life.

4908
02:25:34,210 --> 02:25:34,990
Yeah.

4909
02:25:34,990 --> 02:25:35,770
Yeah.

4910
02:25:35,770 --> 02:25:37,030
I think there's,

4911
02:25:37,031 --> 02:25:41,290
there's a gray that happens in Boston
for a few months during the winter that

4912
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:44,740
dulls the happiness of the
people and it's palpable.

4913
02:25:44,950 --> 02:25:46,420
You can sense that shit in the air.

4914
02:25:46,660 --> 02:25:47,680
When the gray is there,

4915
02:25:47,681 --> 02:25:49,600
the gray of the January gray,

4916
02:25:49,601 --> 02:25:50,111
the February.

4917
02:25:50,111 --> 02:25:53,230
Occasionally you get a
nice sunny day like wow.

4918
02:25:53,260 --> 02:25:54,310
Beautiful Day to day,

4919
02:25:54,520 --> 02:25:56,500
step outsides three fucking degrees.

4920
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:58,510
That shit.

4921
02:25:58,510 --> 02:25:59,980
That shit wears away at you man.

4922
02:26:00,910 --> 02:26:05,680
Salami made up a good story and I was
wondering about that man because people

4923
02:26:05,681 --> 02:26:07,300
will always bullshit you about that.

4924
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:08,980
They'll never tell you like,

4925
02:26:08,981 --> 02:26:09,970
what's it like up here man?

4926
02:26:09,971 --> 02:26:10,600
You like it.

4927
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:11,170
Well,

4928
02:26:11,170 --> 02:26:11,891
I like it a little,

4929
02:26:11,891 --> 02:26:12,341
but man,

4930
02:26:12,341 --> 02:26:14,440
I get depressed as fuck in
the winter and I'm thinking,

4931
02:26:14,441 --> 02:26:15,020
I don't know man.

4932
02:26:15,020 --> 02:26:16,090
Maybe there's a bad idea.

4933
02:26:16,700 --> 02:26:17,380
It's awesome.

4934
02:26:17,380 --> 02:26:18,160
I love it.

4935
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:19,150
It's the best choice.

4936
02:26:19,330 --> 02:26:20,230
I made the best choice,

4937
02:26:20,231 --> 02:26:20,800
man.

4938
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:22,480
I'm so happy you should move up here to,

4939
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:25,120
this is the fuck mother fuckers would try
to convince you and to moving up there

4940
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:28,270
and when you move up there and go,

4941
02:26:28,271 --> 02:26:28,571
man,

4942
02:26:28,571 --> 02:26:29,740
I'm just getting depressed in the winter.

4943
02:26:29,741 --> 02:26:30,670
I don't know what to do.

4944
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:32,230
Thinking about going back to Arizona,

4945
02:26:32,260 --> 02:26:36,370
what did his testimony influenced me?

4946
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:37,210
Yeah,

4947
02:26:37,210 --> 02:26:38,050
son of a bitch.

4948
02:26:38,510 --> 02:26:39,430
They didn't even make it.

4949
02:26:40,420 --> 02:26:41,141
He had a school up there,

4950
02:26:41,141 --> 02:26:41,341
right.

4951
02:26:41,341 --> 02:26:43,480
It wasn't he running a 10th planet
because he has his black pot now.

4952
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:45,610
He has a black belt in the G.

4953
02:26:45,950 --> 02:26:46,890
Does he really under that?

4954
02:26:47,290 --> 02:26:48,123
Oh Wow.

4955
02:26:48,680 --> 02:26:48,981
Salami.

4956
02:26:48,981 --> 02:26:49,814
Such a good dude.

4957
02:26:49,860 --> 02:26:50,050
Oh,

4958
02:26:50,050 --> 02:26:50,771
he's a friendly guy,

4959
02:26:50,771 --> 02:26:51,550
man.

4960
02:26:51,550 --> 02:26:53,710
Even if he's a lying
motherfucker about the climate.

4961
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:57,400
Maybe he liked it initially and
then it just wore down on them.

4962
02:26:57,550 --> 02:26:58,031
I think.

4963
02:26:58,031 --> 02:26:58,480
Yeah,

4964
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:00,790
I think especially if
you live in California,

4965
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:02,740
it would be really hard to go to a place.

4966
02:27:02,741 --> 02:27:03,940
It rained all the time.

4967
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:04,990
Really?

4968
02:27:04,990 --> 02:27:06,190
The rain sometimes.

4969
02:27:06,610 --> 02:27:06,941
Well,

4970
02:27:06,941 --> 02:27:10,480
the one thing that it's amazing
for is the vegetation God,

4971
02:27:10,481 --> 02:27:11,860
their forests out there.

4972
02:27:12,100 --> 02:27:12,940
When you go,

4973
02:27:12,941 --> 02:27:13,930
if you've ever been on a hike,

4974
02:27:13,931 --> 02:27:15,310
like through the Pacific rain forest,

4975
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:17,651
you ever been like,

4976
02:27:17,651 --> 02:27:17,830
no.

4977
02:27:17,830 --> 02:27:18,190
Walk,

4978
02:27:18,190 --> 02:27:19,001
walked around.

4979
02:27:19,001 --> 02:27:20,280
Like if we go to the redwood forest,

4980
02:27:20,310 --> 02:27:21,143
ever do that?

4981
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:24,220
Maybe as a child you got to do that.

4982
02:27:24,230 --> 02:27:25,810
Then at the same thing,

4983
02:27:25,811 --> 02:27:26,644
redwoods the,

4984
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:27,760
I don't think so.

4985
02:27:27,790 --> 02:27:29,170
I think sequoia is a different thing,

4986
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:29,710
but they're,

4987
02:27:29,710 --> 02:27:30,341
they're huge too,

4988
02:27:30,341 --> 02:27:31,060
right?

4989
02:27:31,060 --> 02:27:32,710
It's not the idea as a kid,

4990
02:27:33,050 --> 02:27:34,970
but the those forests,

4991
02:27:34,971 --> 02:27:35,261
man,

4992
02:27:35,261 --> 02:27:39,700
those crazy like rain forest and like
Washington stay where it rains constantly.

4993
02:27:40,210 --> 02:27:41,043
Dude,

4994
02:27:41,050 --> 02:27:45,550
that that's a different feeling when
you're walking through that kind of life.

4995
02:27:45,870 --> 02:27:50,590
Like there's so much vegetation life
around you that as you're like you're,

4996
02:27:50,591 --> 02:27:54,040
you're in that there's like
this bright green forest.

4997
02:27:54,370 --> 02:27:59,370
You kind of understand where all the
old myths of like fairies and elves and

4998
02:28:00,251 --> 02:28:05,251
would sprites appearing because as you're
walking there's so much energy in the

4999
02:28:05,891 --> 02:28:09,580
air that you're almost thinking someone's
watching you the almost looking at

5000
02:28:09,581 --> 02:28:13,120
trees and shit and thinking their period
at you and looking back at you because

5001
02:28:13,121 --> 02:28:14,050
you're feeling,

5002
02:28:14,051 --> 02:28:16,750
you're sensing that
there's other life there.

5003
02:28:16,810 --> 02:28:21,130
You're sensing it because there's
this incredible wealth of vegetation.

5004
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:23,180
It fucking rains every day.

5005
02:28:23,330 --> 02:28:26,150
The grass is glowing green.

5006
02:28:26,390 --> 02:28:27,190
I mean the glass,

5007
02:28:27,190 --> 02:28:30,560
the grass and Oregon is like neon green.

5008
02:28:30,650 --> 02:28:31,880
It's beautiful.

5009
02:28:32,030 --> 02:28:33,740
Like just looking at the grass was like,

5010
02:28:33,741 --> 02:28:34,610
wow,

5011
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:37,280
I never fucking saw grass
like that in studio city.

5012
02:28:37,490 --> 02:28:42,490
That grass is dry and gray and all fucked
up and brown that Portland grass is

5013
02:28:43,101 --> 02:28:43,934
alive.

5014
02:28:43,940 --> 02:28:45,740
And if you walk into those woods,

5015
02:28:45,741 --> 02:28:46,400
man,

5016
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:50,900
there's something about those dense rain
forest that give off this weird sort of

5017
02:28:50,901 --> 02:28:54,650
feeling cause it's strange
silence and you hear animals.

5018
02:28:54,770 --> 02:28:55,650
But like the sign,

5019
02:28:55,680 --> 02:29:00,350
it's a weird sound because there's so
much vegetation that it's like being in a

5020
02:29:00,351 --> 02:29:02,540
room that's like stuffed with things.

5021
02:29:02,690 --> 02:29:04,940
Like there's not little sound
doesn't travel the same way.

5022
02:29:05,150 --> 02:29:07,790
It's not like being in a place where
you're on top of a hill and you overlook

5023
02:29:07,791 --> 02:29:08,391
canyons.

5024
02:29:08,391 --> 02:29:08,870
No,

5025
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:12,680
you're walking through this dense thing
that feels like you're inside of a

5026
02:29:12,681 --> 02:29:13,670
living thing.

5027
02:29:14,270 --> 02:29:17,540
And it is that rain forest
is like a living thing.

5028
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:18,231
In fact,

5029
02:29:18,231 --> 02:29:22,160
the Pacific rain forest has the biggest
single organism on the face of the

5030
02:29:22,161 --> 02:29:22,670
earth.

5031
02:29:22,670 --> 02:29:27,020
There's a mushroom colony and the
Pacific northwest that's so enormous.

5032
02:29:27,021 --> 02:29:29,630
It's bigger than like x
amount of blue whales.

5033
02:29:29,810 --> 02:29:30,560
It's huge.

5034
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:31,700
And it's this connection,

5035
02:29:31,850 --> 02:29:33,050
like almost like a,

5036
02:29:33,080 --> 02:29:33,440
um,

5037
02:29:33,440 --> 02:29:36,030
like a neural connection underneath the,

5038
02:29:36,150 --> 02:29:36,910
like in the,

5039
02:29:36,910 --> 02:29:37,840
the way it's worked in,

5040
02:29:37,841 --> 02:29:38,750
in the ground,

5041
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:39,450
um,

5042
02:29:39,450 --> 02:29:39,981
in the,

5043
02:29:39,981 --> 02:29:41,020
in this entire area,

5044
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:41,871
load a mushroom,

5045
02:29:41,871 --> 02:29:44,480
but it's one giant organism here.

5046
02:29:44,481 --> 02:29:46,120
I better Google this because there's,

5047
02:29:46,270 --> 02:29:46,600
it's a,

5048
02:29:46,600 --> 02:29:48,120
it's very hard to describe it.

5049
02:29:48,170 --> 02:29:49,280
Like a giant mushroom.

5050
02:29:49,640 --> 02:29:50,473
Yeah.

5051
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:53,150
Well it'll take bites out of it.

5052
02:29:53,870 --> 02:29:54,471
No,

5053
02:29:54,471 --> 02:29:56,950
but there's a fuck load
of mushrooms up there,

5054
02:29:56,980 --> 02:29:57,280
man.

5055
02:29:57,280 --> 02:30:00,400
You hear about those people that
died in la or California recently.

5056
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:02,970
A bunch of people are dying
from eating poisonous my shirt.

5057
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:06,110
There's a lot of people
that try to like go,

5058
02:30:06,111 --> 02:30:08,330
like hunting for edible mushrooms.

5059
02:30:08,331 --> 02:30:11,750
It's like a hobby with a lot of people
because you can find like some delicious

5060
02:30:11,751 --> 02:30:12,920
mushrooms in the wild.

5061
02:30:13,340 --> 02:30:14,690
But if you're all get high just to,

5062
02:30:14,691 --> 02:30:14,990
you know,

5063
02:30:14,990 --> 02:30:15,650
just to eat.

5064
02:30:15,650 --> 02:30:18,650
But if you're old and
you can't see this cook,

5065
02:30:18,651 --> 02:30:18,860
Cook.
