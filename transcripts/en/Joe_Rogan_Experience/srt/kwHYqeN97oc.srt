1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,050
Oh,
Janis Joplin's,

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,080
when you got to move,
just watch both parts of that fucking 

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,080
documentary about it.
The new studio,

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,971
when I set up the new studio,
I'm going to set up all these fucking 

5
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:13,610
exchange.
One allowed above 19th street and 

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,400
hoboken's who one go live.
Holla,

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,740
Holla.
You bitches every Christmas.

8
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:18,970
My brother's brother.
Oh Shit.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,410
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

10
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,430
James Collins one allowed above twelfth 
street because the Irish controlled the 

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,850
Italians in the forties.
That's how it was a pecking order and he

12
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:32,360
was the first one to make it out and it 
just cleared the attack.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,060
You gotTa Watch this document.
It's up to the.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,240
It's on.
He had said I try to hbo all of me or 

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,751
something like that.
And it's weird because I always grew up 

16
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:42,120
hearing these fucked up stories about 
him like that.

17
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,670
He was Kinda a little rough,
but bro,

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,470
he fucking love people like us.

19
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,440
Like he lived for that craziness.
He loved it.

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,710
Burt Reynolds just put out a book every 
reading the excerpts that they had been 

21
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,820
released and he went and he goes,
he bumped into Sinatra one night.

22
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,220
It's not just told him to go play cards 
over at some bar that playing cards and 

23
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,361
the guy dropped the dishes and the owner
was yelling at him and he sinatra call 

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,580
the Anova and he goes,
how much,

25
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,230
how much you think your glasses because 
I don't know,

26
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:11,520
maybe thirty cents,
and he goes,

27
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,460
give me $3,000,
$3,000

28
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:17,420
worth of classes.
And he called the bus boy.

29
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,320
He was young and he embarrassed and he 
goes,

30
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:20,340
what's your name?
Hector.

31
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,800
Hector,
I want you to break every fucking class.

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,280
And he started breaking glasses.
Nobody knew what was going on.

33
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,820
And he goes,
if I ever come in here and Hector's not 

34
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:31,820
here,
I'm gonna.

35
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:31,820
Tell all my friends not to come in here 
and eat.

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,470
And Burt Reynolds got legos.
Where the fuck are you going?

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,450
He goes,
I already got my Sinatra Story.

38
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:43,230
He sit the fuck down like A.
Yeah,

39
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,940
he was supposed to be an incredible guy 
like in that sense.

40
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,270
And then after he got down,
like that documentary really breaks it.

41
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,500
He went really down.
They did a world tour out of his pocket,

42
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,980
which is for kids.
He donated everything for kids.

43
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,220
His daughter said he never recovered 
from Kennedy screwing them over.

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,090
Like he never recovered from that.
He just got to catch it.

45
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,260
It's pretty interesting,
man.

46
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:08,520
He's from hoboken,
which really,

47
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,320
when I heard that story about how the 
Italians,

48
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:13,090
when you know it was definitely the 
Muslims war crime.

49
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,340
Now 100 years ago,
those were the Italians.

50
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,750
One hundred years ago,
there was one of the fucking Chinese 

51
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:20,750
people over cliff.

52
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:20,750
The fucking for the railroad with 
dynamite.

53
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,520
Is that true?
Did you ever hear about that shit when 

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,571
they built the railroad statement slash 
question Chinese people like everybody.

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Everybody's suffering this fuck.
The Chinese people who build the 

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,400
railroads,
the railroads,

57
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,290
they essentially can play the first 
finger.

58
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,040
Is it and whoever was it,
strap dynamite around.

59
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,390
They throw them over the phone.
I swear to God,

60
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:44,360
man.
Somebody your fucking say shit to you.

61
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:49,240
Like a lot of all these racist suffered.
You know it and walking on the railroad.

62
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,740
Yeah.
Like,

63
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:51,390
well fuck.
That's why when you go to Wyoming,

64
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:53,130
there's a Chinese restaurant and all 
that shit.

65
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,690
You ever go to Wyoming?
You're like,

66
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,000
wow,
there's no Chinese fucking restaurant in

67
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,200
Cheyenne,
Wyoming,

68
00:02:58,201 --> 00:02:58,650
and they're like,
oh,

69
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,100
because after they built the railroads,

70
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,940
they said,
Fuck Alicia,

71
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,290
stay.
Wow.

72
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,690
That's interesting.
I never really thought about that,

73
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,770
but there was.
Wasn't there.

74
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:07,900
A place we went to was a vancouver.
Then we went to.

75
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:12,901
We went to some museum that showed like 
how all the Chinese immigrants wound up 

76
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:17,491
in Vancouver.
I don't think it was a railroad or I 

77
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:20,251
forget what it was,
but it's interesting when you have like 

78
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:21,340
these pockets,
there's pockets of like certain parts of

79
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:23,920
Chinatown where those people just never 
assimilated.

80
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,640
Like,
fuck it.

81
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,670
We just stay right here.
Everything's in Chinese.

82
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,380
The signs are all in.
Chinese were good.

83
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,600
They don't learn English.
They just stopped.

84
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,840
They decided we'll just make this China,
China West right here just for a couple 

85
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:42,151
of blocks.
It wasn't there like some mayor or 

86
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:42,151
something or there was some kind of guy 
that that,

87
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:47,001
that.
That was from China that came over 

88
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:47,001
there.

89
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:48,280
They invited everybody over there.
Everybody were into Vancouver.

90
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,450
Oh,
that's interesting.

91
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,680
I wonder,
I forget,

92
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:55,710
there was some story about that is I 
wish I paid attention to the 

93
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,830
capitalistic.
The oldest chinatown was in Cuba up to 

94
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,790
sixties,
up to like 61 or [inaudible] 58.

95
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,240
One of the biggest China towns outside 
of the China was Nevada Cube and the 

96
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,180
fact that Fidel took over,
he never fucked with them.

97
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,260
He left those Chinese people alone,
so there's still a lot of Chinese people

98
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:13,270
in Cuba and they speak Spanish.
They speak Cuban.

99
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,870
If you go to 79th street and Broadway by
our friends,

100
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:19,000
we're friends office used to be right 
there.

101
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:22,740
There's a place called la that it's a 
Cuban Chinese played.

102
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:23,620
I said,
are there.

103
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,430
You get pork fried rice with a with a 
pork chop and black beans.

104
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,480
It's fucking ridiculous.
Chinese people speaking Spanish.

105
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:36,670
What?
I was looking for that and they talked 

106
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:36,670
about,
but the Chinese stopped.

107
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,420
Just to hear what that sounds like.
What's that sound?

108
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,020
What does it sound like?
Like really fast.

109
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:45,250
Let's say I say that will not hold.
Hold it mellowed out a little for 

110
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,250
genome.
That's how you would say,

111
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,651
that's how I'd say they'd say that and 
they talk really fast track to see a 

112
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,940
Chinese person speaks Spanish will blow 
your fucking mind,

113
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,740
will blow your mind.
So if you ever have a die even sent,

114
00:04:57,741 --> 00:05:02,741
the opioid opiate ended up going and so 
I was on Oprah and athletes talking 

115
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:04,390
about how that.
That's weird restaurant.

116
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,720
If you go in there and high be prepared 
to go into shock and when I was younger 

117
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,030
they were more.
They were like,

118
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:12,520
I'm following Cina.
That's the Chinese bell.

119
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,150
That was a couple more like in where I 
came from.

120
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,540
Western New York,
that jersey,

121
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,300
that's fucking crazy.
That's like a thing.

122
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,610
Like if you see a Chinese guy with an 
English accent,

123
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,750
you'd go,
Whoa,

124
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,850
hey,
what's going on here?

125
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,670
You know like it doesn't.
It doesn't assimilate with that.

126
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,010
That might be the biggest one.
That's the biggest one.

127
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,010
Chinese person with a Cuban accent 
speaking Spanish and shit.

128
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,470
Fast,
fast.

129
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,400
They just always like multitech.
They're like,

130
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,670
take that as a way of talking to you and
the rhythm of the Chinese tone,

131
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:51,260
but they put it into the Spanish.
How crazy is it that there's so many 

132
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,910
different sounds that people make to,
to,

133
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,090
to talk,
like you hear those African people to 

134
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:57,480
talking like clicks and they start like,
what?

135
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,070
Like they

136
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,750
just developed,
that's their style.

137
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,290
They figured out their style of making 
noise and the each noise means a certain

138
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:08,291
thing and Cubans figured out this kind 
of flight flowing almost dancing style 

139
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,680
and Germans have this fucking hard,
which cuts,

140
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,630
you know,
everything's Fuck you touch,

141
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,730
you know,
and then the Chinese people that figured

142
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:19,070
out their own thing,
it's all totally different.

143
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:21,690
All of them different.
The Japanese have grunts.

144
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

145
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,720
They have their own thing.

146
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,630
I liked when I hear Portuguese,
this is what blows my mind when I watch 

147
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,830
a fight and uh,
talking to the interpreter,

148
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,060
when I watch Portuguese,
I understand a few words just from being

149
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:40,720
Spanish.
I don't understand all of them.

150
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,590
I'm not gonna lie to you,
but then it was weird.

151
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:48,591
Like,
then you have all these countries 

152
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:48,870
together,
but like when Sicilians 12 around me,

153
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:53,871
I know exactly what they're saying.
They can't pull the wool over that 

154
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:57,110
island is half fucking Spanish.
They don't even know when a Sicilian 

155
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,110
stroke.
I picked more words up.

156
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,510
You know what I'm saying?
So important.

157
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,580
You say a five word sentence.
I pick up one word and then I'll take it

158
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:03,990
from there.
My imagination.

159
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,130
But when Sicilians to or I could take 
four to five words,

160
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:10,200
like I understand that it's closer to 
Spanish.

161
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,100
So somewhere along the line I always 
figured out we were connected some way.

162
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,090
There's some French words that I 
understand that Spanish.

163
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,090
It's kind of weird,
like it's just,

164
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,010
I don't know if I could explain it that 
right.

165
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,990
Well there's like the romance languages,
right?

166
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:30,150
Like Latin Spanish is a franchise,
right?

167
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,380
There's are like what they call the 
romance languages,

168
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:37,381
like old school,
European languages that have that sort 

169
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:41,431
of flair to them.
There's like a beauty to a lot of those 

170
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:41,560
older languages.
You know,

171
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,600
it's,
it's interesting just how different 

172
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:46,600
parts of the country developed different
sounds for talking,

173
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,380
you know,
when you listen to people from the South

174
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,470
Pacific or,
or another.

175
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,390
Another weird one is Filipinos when here
Filipino.

176
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,030
She's like,
wow,

177
00:07:55,031 --> 00:08:00,031
that's kind of a combination of stuff.
Like there's just like a combination of 

178
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:01,990
sort of like an Asian but a Spanish.
There's a flow to it.

179
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:03,220
It's a weird thing.
Right.

180
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And a lot of like,
a lot of Filipinos have traditionally 

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,660
Spanish last names as well.
Was conquered by the Spanish.

182
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:15,661
Right.
It was like Spanish and Chinese right 

183
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,881
there.
It's a combination of Spanish and 

184
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:17,881
Chinese and they were all Catholic.
Yeah,

185
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:20,010
that's true.
Yeah.

186
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,930
Like manny Pacquiao,
super fucking religious time Catholic.

187
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,290
I read something recently about how 
emojis are the,

188
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,460
it's the most advanced language that's 
been created recently just because you 

189
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,810
can pretty much cross,
you know,

190
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:38,770
I could talk to a Japanese person by 
Emoji to some point and you know,

191
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,960
and if you think about it,
that's how cave men started.

192
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:43,960
So they might've been way more advanced 
in their language and we would have been

193
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:45,340
just shitting on them the whole time.

194
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,310
Well cavemen didn't really do it in 
pictures mean they made pictures on the 

195
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,541
wall,
but we don't think that they were 

196
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,771
communicating,
but they do that a hieroglyphics were 

197
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:58,740
like a super advanced way of 
communicating.

198
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,900
We just can't.
We don't quite get it.

199
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,630
You know,
there's no poop

200
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Emoji type thing for that,
that it's more advanced like triangles 

201
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,360
and eyeballs and stuff.
Right.

202
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,520
Is that what the languages it looks 
like?

203
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,380
Yeah,
it's all different symbols,

204
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,280
you know,
it's different than.

205
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:17,790
I don't totally understand that,
but there's a lot of uh,

206
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,850
Egyptian language was lost.
A lot of,

207
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,720
a lot of the writing was lost in 
something called the fire of Alexandria,

208
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,010
like when they burned Alexandria,
I guess they birth like a lot of,

209
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:31,680
like really cool shit.
They destroyed all the records.

210
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,980
Like it might've been like explanations 
really built all that shit.

211
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,510
All of it got destroyed because it was 
all on like I guess a paper or piracy,

212
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,050
which I don't think is really a paper.
I think it's like an animal skin thing,

213
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,080
like paper made with animal skins.
But yeah,

214
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:47,220
those fucking people,
man,

215
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:52,221
they drew on their walls.
They had like their history of their 

216
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:56,211
creation and all this different shit and
it was all just written all these 

217
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:56,211
different images.

218
00:09:56,211 --> 00:10:00,660
You know,
they just wrote in images like we think 

219
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,770
that you have to write in letters 
because that's how we write.

220
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:04,380
We write in letters,
but if we'd never wrote in letters,

221
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:09,381
we only wrote an images.
I mean we would just develop a really 

222
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:10,650
advanced system for communicating and 
images.

223
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,400
Like when you look at someone's writing 
and you don't understand it,

224
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:15,960
if you look at Portuguese or something 
like that,

225
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,640
you don't understand what it means.
You can kind of just look at all the 

226
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,850
little letters and everything are all 
squished in together to try to make it 

227
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:25,850
strange sound,
you know,

228
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,940
it doesn't really.
It doesn't click and register.

229
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,880
But then when you read something that 
you absolutely know what it is,

230
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,150
like the thought and the idea 
immediately enters into your head,

231
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,660
well you would weight be way more 
universal if it was like images.

232
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,490
So it does make sense.

233
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:38,960
Yeah.
Like,

234
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,870
I mean if you think about it,
like look at the old Egyptian,

235
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:44,540
you know,
King type with the hand going up and one

236
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:49,541
going down and then you look at like our
emoji system where we have like that 

237
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:53,051
one,
like hey felicia chick with their hand 

238
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:53,051
to the sideways and we know exactly what
that means.

239
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:53,150
When a girl sends,
it's like,

240
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:54,340
hey,
whatever,

241
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,890
if you see the Egyptian,
that's kind of like the same exact shit.

242
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,960
I don't know what the fuck did that 
mean?

243
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:02,350
Why did the Egyptians hold their hand?
That was it.

244
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Just the walk.
The Egyptian music video that I'm 

245
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,360
thinking of.
Maybe they never did.

246
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,360
They didn't.

247
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,060
What they did was pig Latin.
Break that down for me.

248
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,800
It's like you saying nay at the end of 
everything and you take the first letter

249
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,280
away and then you like,
you wouldn't say Diaz.

250
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,040
You would say uh,
he as day,

251
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,320
right?

252
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,160
Yes.
His name.

253
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,100
His name.
Okay.

254
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,690
Yeah.
When I was a kicker on the ex,

255
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,140
you know,
I've heard that,

256
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,650
you know,
I don't even know how to say this.

257
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,660
The Spanish one,
when you're Cuban and they have a peg 

258
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:38,660
leg and my mom used to talk to them in 
Spanish.

259
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,650
This form of communication was other 
people in the room.

260
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,350
She didn't want people to know what she 
was saying to me.

261
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:48,540
Oh,
it was like she thought she thought she 

262
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:48,540
thought same fucking thing to do 
something.

263
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:53,570
I forgot what fuck fucking was.
Cuban is a very interesting Spanish 

264
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,510
cause it's almost like,
like drums are playing,

265
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,750
you know,
when,

266
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:02,860
when to queue and people start going 
back and forth and back and forth.

267
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,050
It's a,
it's like it's got a rhythmic quality to

268
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:09,800
it out loud to a Cuban food.
It gets,

269
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:15,090
the conversation gets louder and louder 
and louder and you actually think 

270
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,890
there's an argument going on,
but there's really not any fun at all.

271
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,260
It's just two people who are so 
passionate about this subject.

272
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,910
They're talking about I eat baseball.
Yeah.

273
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,180
You know,
when you get them going,

274
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,580
don't start that fucking argument.
Well,

275
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,670
what was the documentary there?
Saw where they went to Cuba and they 

276
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,550
were watching these guys pay to argue.
They would pay to uh,

277
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:39,840
discuss like sports,
like they'd pay to,

278
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:44,930
to like to argue.
They would go to this one area and they 

279
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,571
would get together with other guys who 
want to argue about sports and then 

280
00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:50,950
they're actually like,
they had like a ticket and they would go

281
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:55,050
in there and argue about like soccer,
baseball,

282
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,200
10 years.
Really?

283
00:12:56,201 --> 00:13:01,201
No baseball.
Their arguments are a beautiful 

284
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:04,231
arguments.
That thing I used to do years ago where 

285
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:04,231
I'd yell and then walk away.
Right,

286
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:04,450
right.
That's cute.

287
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,570
But that means the conversation's over.
Whatever you got to say.

288
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,070
I don't meet the head because you're 
wrong.

289
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,480
This,
that's what that means.

290
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:15,400
That's at Bali.
Let them argue all day about dumb shit.

291
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,960
Music,
you know,

292
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,510
baseball.
It's interesting to them,

293
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:24,511
but they,
they detail is so much that you'll 

294
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:24,511
actually,
they suck you in with the conversation.

295
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:29,371
You know,
like that fucking Yoel Romero dude who 

296
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:32,820
more embodies Cuba and Cuban athletics 
than that guy him like,

297
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,460
he's like,
when I think of like a Cuban athletes 

298
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,130
like Cuban super athletes.
You think Yoel Romero,

299
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,480
right?
Well,

300
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:45,481
the thing that is the most thing that he
has about being a Cuban is that he's 38 

301
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:47,160
and you don't really know.
Oh,

302
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,510
you can't tell.
Nobody knows.

303
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,880
He's 38.
He could be 22 dogs,

304
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,320
could be sucking you in.
And nobody really knows.

305
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:56,710
We really have those birth certificates.
They went away.

306
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,310
You just pick the dates.
What do you want to be done?

307
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:04,710
You know,
he competed as a wrestler for a long 

308
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,710
time.
So they know he's a,

309
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,280
at least a certain age.
I'm just teasing,

310
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,540
but I know it's always something with 
the Cuban.

311
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,470
I'm going to run.
Mom died.

312
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:10,660
I told my auntie she was.
How old was your mom?

313
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:14,100
40 eight flopped.
She's been 48 for 10 fucking years.

314
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,880
You know,
because it's true.

315
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,600
You don't know dog never know.
These motherfuckers ages.

316
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,790
They won't tell you.
You know that last fight.

317
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,230
He fought.
Fucking great man.

318
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,190
You see the one before that where he 
told people to not.

319
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,140
He was trying to say,
don't forget Jesus,

320
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,430
but they didn't get it because he's got 
a thick,

321
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:35,680
thick Cuban accent.
The thickest.

322
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,410
So he goes,
don't forget Jesus,

323
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:44,030
don't forget Jesus.
So people thought he was saying no for 

324
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,510
Gay Jesus.
Like there's no gay Jesus,

325
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,000
like Jesus isn't gay.
It could've been way worse though.

326
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,130
But she was saying was,
is

327
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,890
saying don't forget Jesus.
He was just saying,

328
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:55,970
you know,
I one,

329
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,040
don't forget.
You know,

330
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,300
I didn't go to the why here.
Why?

331
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,720
You know,
why they didn't go that way?

332
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Why it not go that way?
Because I would have gone off on him 

333
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,100
that he would have beat up right,
and Luke and how the one that would be 

334
00:15:09,361 --> 00:15:14,361
in that room that night.
I know how to motivate Cubans or with 

335
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:15,530
religion,
that radicals,

336
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:20,990
you would just start talking about God,
I just call him about old goon got 

337
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,500
metal,
God of Cuba and he'll wait a minute,

338
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,030
hold on.
This guy,

339
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,260
and he used the one that he used,
the metal worker.

340
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:30,230
He is the fucking built.
When you go on Youtube,

341
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:32,680
look for a gun.
He was always a big black guy.

342
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:36,480
Lives in the jungle and he only comes 
out to you.

343
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,030
Only comes out when there's a problem.

344
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,520
So if I would've seen y'all remember 
that day,

345
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:43,270
I would have said the whole Google and I
would have got his blood gone.

346
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:46,640
Like blood going,
shit dog.

347
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:51,641
I started doing that to end this civil 
when I first met him and I remember one 

348
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:52,250
day in the hallway he couldn't take his 
eyes off me.

349
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,520
People talking to them.
They kept looking back,

350
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,570
fuck the sand because it's big in 
Brasilia Brasilia.

351
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,710
So I would've started saying,
Oh yeah,

352
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,640
oh yeah,
Augie and I would have started saying 

353
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:07,640
who my mother is,
Eagle Eye,

354
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,850
some DC,
my golden eat that met that your toilet.

355
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Get a guy that's the marrow.
Look it up.

356
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,070
Look like you know all black muscular 
Cuban dudes that looked like that.

357
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,820
You fire them up,
tell them their own lunch and they go,

358
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,820
shit,
I'll get you fired up churches before in

359
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,580
Cuba.
It was this guy,

360
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,490
this guy,
right?

361
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,830
So he,
he.

362
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,100
So there's like a series of black porn 
film guys,

363
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,790
shirtless six pack covered in oil.
This is the God is Christ.

364
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:54,791
This is side of the jungle and he like 
is in charge of machinery.

365
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:59,891
When you,
when machinery goes bad and shit like 

366
00:16:59,891 --> 00:16:59,891
that,
you have to pray to him.

367
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:01,920
He has all the weapons of metal.
He just shows up in metal and starts.

368
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,560
He has a metal,
acts metal,

369
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:08,561
fucking everything that's.
So that's what I would have busted them 

370
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,861
with that I would've just,
I would've gotten through his head with 

371
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:11,930
a gun and hate that.
That takes over Jesus and Cuba.

372
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,330
That's what you were brought up on.
You heard that growing up,

373
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,270
so even if you converted to Christianity
later on,

374
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,280
that will still get under your fucking 
skin,

375
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,230
like rattle your cage and shit profiled 
the study saying that shit.

376
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,420
Everybody out of their rang John 
McCarthy.

377
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,920
It would have been an episode of curly 
and the little rascals when they fought 

378
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,550
that little rascal.
Three students currently to wrestle for 

379
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,501
a benefit,
but the problem was when whenever curly 

380
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:39,350
smelled wild license,
she went fucking nuts.

381
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:44,770
So he's on the bottom of the pile of 
guys beating them and all of a sudden 

382
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,320
what mo comes over and makes them sniff 
the fucking thing.

383
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,930
Curly pushes him off.
And what is it called?

384
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:49,630
Wild Wild Heisler.

385
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:55,410
Like some fucking something you know 
this is like in the forties it was made 

386
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:01,030
and all of a sudden you flashback and 
you just see curly everybody.

387
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:06,050
People coming out and then he gets a 
hold of the belt and he starts clocking 

388
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,831
people with the bell from the wild 
licensed and they flip over the curly 

389
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:10,770
hitting people with the Bow Boston.
They flip over to the middle of the ring

390
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,800
and they're all piled on top of each 
other though not 18 people with that 

391
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,700
fucking.
That's what I would have done.

392
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,450
The yellow that day he would have gotten
until the Orleans Bang.

393
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,060
Your head was big.
What's his name?

394
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,340
Goldberg.

395
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,260
I felt bad when that whole forget Jesus 
thing went down.

396
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,230
It was so bad.
There was everybody's piling on them.

397
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,770
They all just assumed it was really bad 
because you got to know the Cuban accent

398
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,800
to tease become wise.
It just,

399
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,640
that's how they do it in a thick accent 
like that.

400
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,710
Like nobody,
nobody figured it out.

401
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,330
It was weird.
It was weird to watch.

402
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,290
There were all like,
he's,

403
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:57,291
you know,
he's making a statement against gay 

404
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:57,291
people are like,
oh man.

405
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,540
I thought when I heard it,
I was like this mother because Africa,

406
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,090
but it's pro gay.
Right.

407
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,710
And the other fucking half a Cuba.
They'll take the shark content,

408
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,490
but didn't you understand what he was 
saying?

409
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:08,230
Scene as you speak.
Spanish accent.

410
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,360
I didn't get it.
Wow.

411
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:09,900
I didn't,
you know,

412
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:11,870
I'm half deaf so I really didn't hear.
Oh,

413
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,880
okay.
What the fuck he was saying and that's 

414
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:16,880
why you're already screaming.

415
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,420
Yeah,
I kind of heard about it after they had 

416
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:26,730
already figured out what it was.
So I didn't.

417
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,680
But when I heard it I was like,
yeah,

418
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:29,640
that's what he's saying.
He's saying,

419
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:31,920
don't forget Jesus,
he's fucking Cuban.

420
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:35,360
It's like,
don't fuck does both for gang.

421
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,460
No far gang.
And you know,

422
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,310
that's him saying,
don't forget Jesus,

423
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,650
he fucking loves you.
Have beaten into the ground.

424
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:45,990
I love him.
I could tell the way he says you'll make

425
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,370
jokes about,
oh my God,

426
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:53,070
he loves you.
I can tell how he's excited.

427
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,400
The thing that they should do that the 
UFC always.

428
00:19:56,401 --> 00:20:01,401
Mrs.
just tape the best corners in the 

429
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,251
business on George a Mazda and Yo Romero
and I hear it because the things they 

430
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:09,900
say are ridiculous.
Ridiculous.

431
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,570
Proceeded in Spanish or Cuban Spanish 
where they say,

432
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,630
well,
I was here in Georgia,

433
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,900
the vows trainer.

434
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,880
Same Methadone,
Methadone guy at the hustle,

435
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,610
you know the guy at the top.
So it's an open hand.

436
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:23,310
The bitch slap can't do that.
And the guys,

437
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:25,050
oh,
he met guy at docile.

438
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,060
So he's saying he wants to hurt his 
hand.

439
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:31,770
That's Cuba needs most shit.
You can smack somebody.

440
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:36,771
But in our mind methylome guy,
if that's what fires you up the 

441
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:36,771
hospital.
Oh yeah,

442
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:38,860
let's listen to what I remember a bit.
Slap is a bitch.

443
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,340
Slap and Cuban.
That's my password.

444
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,910
Oh Man.
He was saying young you don't know.

445
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,040
Have an airplane.
That means hit him

446
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,040
with one of these things that come 
across the head like a fucking wild 

447
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,461
punch as a phone.
And I will talk to you a Cuban one time 

448
00:20:56,461 --> 00:20:58,410
they were interviewing Stevenson in like
the seventies and they go stevens.

449
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,800
And what happened?
Get White.

450
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,730
And the guy's like,
you know,

451
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:03,020
trying to.
And Stevenson said it and I almost died.

452
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:03,790
It was a little kid,
man.

453
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,870
I hit them with a plane that's they're 
called compile our young.

454
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,430
But a great language.
Know it has so many different meanings.

455
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,820
And the truth of the matter is,
it's such a funny language because they 

456
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,930
say shit like one time.
One of the nicest thing you've ever said

457
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:26,430
to me that you were stuck in an airport 
and all of a sudden you heard this party

458
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,440
going on at seven in the morning and 
people were delayed and you looked over 

459
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,080
when they were Cubans and they were 
like,

460
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,910
I got you that day.

461
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:37,080
That's when I really got you.
I got you.

462
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,340
It's your culture a little,
you know.

463
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,090
Well,
I remember.

464
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,650
I remember that day very well.
It was.

465
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:43,210
People were,
they were having fun,

466
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:48,211
man.
They were speaking Spanish with clearly 

467
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:48,211
Cuban accents.
They were dancing.

468
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:48,480
They were,
they would have.

469
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,340
The little girl was dancing with the 
father was dancing and they were playing

470
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:52,870
music out of their phone.
I was like,

471
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:55,690
look at these fucking people.
Don't give a fuck who you just,

472
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:57,860
you're having a good time.
They're just here having a good time.

473
00:21:57,861 --> 00:21:59,500
It's beautiful.
So you know,

474
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:04,390
the one thing that I don't know too much
about politics and I don't know too much

475
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:08,380
about like the embargo and how it all 
went down.

476
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,560
I know very little of it honestly,
but what I do know is there's something 

477
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,821
strange about a culture like Cuba that's
kind of existed outside of the influence

478
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:18,940
of the United States.

479
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,050
Purely,
you know what I mean?

480
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,090
Obviously we're only 90 miles away,
but since we're.

481
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,100
There was an embargo and there's all 
this bullshit that was going on back and

482
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:32,101
forth between the two countries.
They kind of existed in their own space 

483
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,510
and when you see it like in video and 
you see like the cars,

484
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,930
all 19 fifties,
cars done up beautifully and people are 

485
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,871
driving them around.
They put like diesel engines in some of 

486
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:43,720
them and shit.
They're all like self sustaining and you

487
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:48,721
look at these people and you see the,
the flowing style of their language and 

488
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:52,030
how they live and it's all right there.
It's fucking 90 miles from from Miami.

489
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,060
He just nothing,
you know,

490
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,920
if you could drive than a car will take 
you an hour and a half.

491
00:22:56,921 --> 00:23:00,070
It's closer than San Diego and that's a 
totally different world.

492
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Totally different world that essentially
existed with very little us influence 

493
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,810
other than the fact that we're close by 
and you know,

494
00:23:07,811 --> 00:23:09,340
they have to deal with us,
but other than that,

495
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,030
I mean they're doing their own thing 
down there and they athletes,

496
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:18,060
Jesus fucking Christ.
How many countries that are that small 

497
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
produce,
the kind of athletes that Cuba has.

498
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,750
Just think about how many baseball 
players have defected and become like 

499
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,250
major league baseball players.
How many boxers have defected and become

500
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,400
world champions?
Like there's a lot of like super high 

501
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,350
level boxers had come over there from 
their judo guys.

502
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,350
Guys like Hector Lombard,
you know,

503
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,050
I mean that kind of that caliber of 
athlete like Jesus Christ.

504
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,830
A lot of them come from Juba.
He did Hector Lombard and Romero

505
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,740
both what you would call what the fuck 
athletes,

506
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,880
you know,
you look at both of them,

507
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:51,080
you go,
what the fuck?

508
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,580
And I'm thinking,
what did they lift?

509
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:57,581
And Cuba.
They say two eggs a fucking year in 

510
00:23:57,581 --> 00:23:57,581
Cuba.
What?

511
00:23:57,581 --> 00:23:59,500
The protein source.
They got no juice in Cuba.

512
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,640
How do you get that?
Fucking big.

513
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:02,810
And I've seen,
listen,

514
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:07,811
when I went home I went to,
I went with my wife and the baby in New 

515
00:24:07,811 --> 00:24:07,970
York and one day I said,
listen,

516
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:10,680
before we go into the city and Shit,
let me take you to my neighbor.

517
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,790
I took him to the actual park.
I used to play,

518
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:18,150
why you see some crazy shit.
And I sat across the street from 

519
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:18,150
Columbine,
bows and arrows,

520
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,900
has the guy that shot the guy seven 
times and self defense and all that shit

521
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:25,901
and got away with it and they took away 
his pension and I'm just staring at the 

522
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:25,901
house or something.

523
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:30,240
Like I remember being out here when the 
FBI had that house surrounded and they 

524
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,970
fucking found patty hearst is machines 
on in that house,

525
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,230
mine a dog.
And he was like,

526
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,140
that's how deep this guy who was in my 
hometown,

527
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,220
and I'm going through like going through
the,

528
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,710
uh,
we were kids,

529
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:46,290
we had to do the attic and we will find 
the money in the attic door.

530
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Hundreds and twenties and 50,
wherever had the house before that had 

531
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,740
so much money.
They will use those installation.

532
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,020
Why?
It's like,

533
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:56,720
this is crazy,
I'm thinking about all these things,

534
00:24:56,721 --> 00:24:59,180
but what all this has gone on.
It's me,

535
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:04,181
my wife and the baby and a guy and his 
little girl and my daughter is kind of 

536
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:05,400
mingled.
A little girl.

537
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:10,420
It's a beautiful day in.
He just leaves out and everything and 

538
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,530
all of a sudden the guy's getting ready 
to leave and I just said,

539
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:13,580
hey man,
how are you?

540
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,880
And I go and I want to say you live 
around here just to see kids come to the

541
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:18,680
park.
You live around here man.

542
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,260
And he was like,
will you live around here?

543
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,980
And he goes,
me know,

544
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,530
and I go,
when he goes,

545
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:25,490
yeah.
I go,

546
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:27,950
how long have you been here?
Eight days.

547
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,150
Him and his daughter has been here eight
days.

548
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,480
They had gotten him like the day after 
Thanksgiving,

549
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,960
so right away my fucking.
They offered me a Cuban cigarette,

550
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:43,961
which I smoked.
I smoked a cigarette with the guy just 

551
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:47,171
talking to her just to feel where he was
coming and he was telling me how you're 

552
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:52,130
basically poor unless you tell you have 
to affect them to professionalism.

553
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:56,510
There's a word that you defect in the 
country and now you work for yourself,

554
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:59,810
so he.
This guy was 48 and he was a bicycle guy

555
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:02,780
that two people sit in the back and 
drive you around town.

556
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,870
So when he was making him one day he was
making a month.

557
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,870
That's why they let them effect so 
quickly.

558
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,080
They let him out of the country because 
you have to claim that first day.

559
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,990
You don't want to be a professional.
He was telling me all this shit.

560
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:20,410
I told him he had tears in my eyes and 
he was telling me what I asked him what 

561
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,620
a daily menu was like.
He said,

562
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,600
he came here and saw an Italian 
sandwich.

563
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:29,040
He was coordinator,
so if they're being that Italian 

564
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,540
sandwich when you.
I slept for 15 hours,

565
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,840
he goes,
that was tremendous and they've never 

566
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:34,840
seen it.
How can a man be 48 years old?

567
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,140
I've never seen an Italian sandwich.
Are you fucking kidding me?

568
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,200
I went on.
What kind of menu did he say here in 

569
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,200
Cuba?
You get I.

570
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,790
you've got a dozen eggs per month.

571
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,890
That's it for a family of five,
you know,

572
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,240
the,
the coffee,

573
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,500
you get like one pouch a month and you 
have to read,

574
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:55,710
keep.
I bought him a cup of coffee.

575
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,090
He's like,
I tasted the coffee for the first time.

576
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,200
I like,
you have to keep going,

577
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,310
running the filter through that coffee 
until there's really nothing left.

578
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,890
And then they do things to bring that 
coffee back.

579
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,660
You spray windex or something,
something ridiculous like that.

580
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:15,360
You sit there and go.
Unbelievable what they do for coffee and

581
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:16,720
the liberties we have.
You know,

582
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,450
unfucking believable was alive.
It was because they,

583
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,680
the US stopped doing trade with them.
Right?

584
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,960
I mean that was a big part of it.
Here's the clinker have pigs.

585
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,370
Uh,
yeah,

586
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,420
they,
they got nothing.

587
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:35,450
You know,
and I've heard some people that they 

588
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,861
went to Cuba,
they seen a Washington apples at the 

589
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:36,970
hotels,
you know,

590
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,650
like the hotels are getting taken care 
of for a tourism,

591
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,870
but everybody else lives like savages.

592
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,630
But here's where the compensation gets 
past.

593
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,780
The guy's been here eight days.
He already had a fucking job,

594
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,420
already had a fucking job and seacaucus 
go,

595
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,650
how's your English?
He goes,

596
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:57,651
just coming along.
But I worked with a bunch of blocks and 

597
00:27:57,651 --> 00:27:57,651
they don't speak English,
so what kind of confused,

598
00:27:57,651 --> 00:27:58,560
but we make it work.
Oh my God.

599
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:01,080
He was fucking hilarious.
And Joe Rogan,

600
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:06,081
you know what I mean?
I turned around and went in my pocket 

601
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:06,210
and I had $200 bills,
20 and I said,

602
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:11,211
do me a favor.
I got a sister in Cuba will mean the 

603
00:28:11,211 --> 00:28:13,431
world to me.
We took these two yard sticks and he 

604
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:13,431
goes,
I can't do it.

605
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:15,720
He wouldn't take my money though.
I got a sister in Cuba.

606
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,680
Just got here.
I go by your daughter.

607
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,410
Something nice out of risk,
you know,

608
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,580
I don't know who you are.

609
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,240
He wouldn't take my house.
Wow.

610
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,250
I sat there.
I go,

611
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:24,420
wow.
That's pride.

612
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,200
That's pride.
He wouldn't take my money though and I 

613
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,200
just,
you know,

614
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,590
people ask you for money all the time.
This guy really fucking needs it.

615
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,680
He wouldn't take it.
He still had Cuban cigarettes.

616
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:36,840
He had not smoking.
And that's why I said to him,

617
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:39,690
I go buy yourself a fucking cotton real 
fucking cigarette.

618
00:28:39,691 --> 00:28:42,090
How did he get in his sister,
his daughter,

619
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,710
his daughter affected with the mother 
when she was three.

620
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:51,760
You know,
they leave and he stayed and started 

621
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:51,760
another family.
That's it.

622
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,650
And you imagine one damage.
That's it.

623
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,710
Mrs Rogan.
I got to go back and take care and I'll 

624
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:57,710
get you back guys.
In three years.

625
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,700
Well,
a lot of boxers that happened to a.

626
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:04,701
What does that trainer a d as The guy 
who works with Pedro Diaz was worse and 

627
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,630
works with a lot of those other guys.
He,

628
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,460
he left and left the family back home.
They did a,

629
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,670
one of the boxing pieces,
the in depth boxing pieces on them,

630
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:20,190
you know,
he just realized that he just took to 

631
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:20,190
fulfill his dream of being a 
professional.

632
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:20,550
Boxing trainers.
Got Escape.

633
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,210
That's gotta be so hard,
man,

634
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,270
to leave your loved ones behind.
Just because you know,

635
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,630
like your life is fucked here.
I wonder if they're going to be able to 

636
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:32,630
get back now.
Like what?

637
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,590
How does that happen now?
We opened up Cuba,

638
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,240
so they did the first flight at lax.
You guys saw that and they gave away a 

639
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,861
little truck with cigars,
like it's a fucking party for these 

640
00:29:43,861 --> 00:29:46,050
people.
So when we like freely allowed to go to 

641
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,050
Cuba,
now that's it.

642
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,270
You go with the Mrs.
Wow.

643
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,460
Right.
So dangerous American Airlines.

644
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,170
No,
no,

645
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,390
no,
no.

646
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:57,630
Listen to what?
None of the time people will tell you 

647
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:57,880
this of 10 people go,
listen bro.

648
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,900
The poverty breaks your heart.
The food kind of sucks,

649
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:06,550
but the people shit.
That's a different level of heart.

650
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,750
You sit there and go,
wow,

651
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:10,660
these people have nothing.
Why do they act this way?

652
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,670
I find it.
If I had what these people had,

653
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,870
I would not be a nice person at all.
They say those people.

654
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,150
Some Eric Meyers,
some comment from the store,

655
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,620
pull me aside.
Three weeks ago he goes,

656
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:23,140
hey man,
I want to give you a present.

657
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:28,530
I don't even know the comic.
I see them up there because I ain't 

658
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:28,530
never mind.
He goes,

659
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,880
I went to Cuba and somebody robbed my 
thing on the plane,

660
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,230
and a Cuban family took me in for four 
days and fed me.

661
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,200
He goes to that like two pork chops.
He was telling me,

662
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:39,820
he goes,
I never felt that way.

663
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,940
He goes,
they're fucking beautiful people.

664
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,640
Everything sucks,
but the people take it to the next step.

665
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,280
Isn't that crazy though?
Because that's what everybody wants.

666
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,450
Everybody wants a community filled with 
really nice people like that.

667
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,480
That's what everybody wants.
Everybody wants people to look out for 

668
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:57,480
each other.

669
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Warm,
friendly,

670
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,080
funny people.
Right?

671
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,860
That's it.
So what did.

672
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,260
I mean,
I don't want to say this because I don't

673
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,360
believe it,
but this communism work.

674
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:09,420
Does it make better people?
I mean if you're in this small 

675
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,270
environment like that and you're forced 
to work together because the United 

676
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,710
States cuts,
cuts your country off and so I mean,

677
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,780
I don't know who they do trade with 
mostly,

678
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:22,030
but that had to hurt them financially.
That hurt their quality of life in a big

679
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:22,670
way.
Right?

680
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,310
But I don't even think they know what 
communism is.

681
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:32,311
Like the conversations I've had face to 
face with my cousins at a where we go 

682
00:31:32,311 --> 00:31:35,830
for Pastrami sandwiches and we went to a
Cuban place while they were in la.

683
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,650
Communism didn't come up one time.
I don't have the heart to bring it up at

684
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,730
once.
Like I don't,

685
00:31:41,731 --> 00:31:42,430
I don't want to know.

686
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,560
They know that other people can do 
whatever they want and they know and I 

687
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,490
went to.
What's the place we go to?

688
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,860
What's the fucking place you go to 
drama.

689
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,200
And we were at the store on Qantas.
Qantas,

690
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:56,050
we went to canter's and they started 
singing stairway to heaven.

691
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,710
I almost fucking died.
And they had to sneak the album around.

692
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,340
Like they still had albums.
We're talking about cds here.

693
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,350
They had vinyl,
you know,

694
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,330
and they were like,
you have no idea.

695
00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:09,610
Like if you get caught with that vinyl,
you go to jail,

696
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:15,770
jail for vinyl,
we're going to jail here for having a 

697
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:15,770
pound of coke.
You know what I'm saying?

698
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,420
I fucking album.
You go to jail,

699
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:21,421
they write you up,
you got to fucking go through some 

700
00:32:21,421 --> 00:32:21,430
process.
You might lose your job,

701
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:26,431
you know.
And they were singing stand where it 

702
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:26,431
happened.
The way they sang it.

703
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:28,540
And fucking we hear it.
It's two different worlds,

704
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:30,340
man.
It was like they sang it with.

705
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,260
This was big too,
that you know,

706
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:37,261
you don't know the overwhelming feeling 
when you come to America.

707
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,010
People don't know the

708
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,710
first time you learned a sentence to a 
fucking song,

709
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:48,190
you know how big that is.
The first time we learned how to say 

710
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,530
cool.
Oh cool.

711
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,200
Oh cool.
And then just don't fuck it up.

712
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,870
You don't get good on you.
Okay,

713
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,340
cool.
Cool.

714
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,010
If you have no idea what it means to 
you,

715
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,890
you know what I'm saying?
Like to really absorb this,

716
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:04,490
to be a fucking American is huge to an 
of people.

717
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:06,680
We take this for granted every fucking 
day.

718
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,710
I see these jerk offs walking around.
They have no fucking idea.

719
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:15,070
They have no idea until you talk to 
somebody Cuban where you talked to 

720
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,770
somebody from a country that they'd been
kind of fucked up,

721
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,120
you know.
And listen man,

722
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:19,400
when I live in boulder,
I got nothing to hide.

723
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:22,190
One of my best friends was a bad Muslim 
dude.

724
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:27,430
And he wasn't radical and the reason why
I'm here is because he taught me how to 

725
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,220
fucking read and write here where my 
ged,

726
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:28,950
his name was.

727
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,340
Mohammed is a b,
but I'll never forget that motherfucker.

728
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,560
And I cracked jokes and all that shit.
But that was my boy when I lived in 

729
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:36,920
boulder.
I used to bring me Hash.

730
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,160
I used to make me smoke reefer.
He's taught me how to smoke a fucking 

731
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,770
cigarette with a tobacco,
you know,

732
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,210
these options,
whatever those people,

733
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:47,140
they fucking get the fuck in tobacco 
with the weed.

734
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,980
The Hash.
I almost had a heart attack though.

735
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,530
He's over that blast and this fucking 
thing like,

736
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:54,410
uh,
like it's uh,

737
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,400
and I used to talk to him like how is 
it?

738
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:01,410
And he would tell me,
look at these fucking an appreciative 

739
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,020
Americans.
He would say to me all the fucking time.

740
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:07,730
He came here and he was nine and the 
first time he sang a Beatles song,

741
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,970
he almost fucking die.
Like the single whole Beatles Song,

742
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:11,460
you know,
like,

743
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,080
let it be something like that.
That was fucking amazing to him,

744
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,840
to,
to learn another language.

745
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:19,720
It was so overwhelming,
you know,

746
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,700
come from someplace where you had 
gunfire every night.

747
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,000
Can you imagine living in Israel and 
hearing machine gun every night?

748
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,120
That's how you fucking go to bed.
What I'm saying.

749
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,930
You come here and you move to studio 
city and you're gluten free and shit.

750
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,860
My name's Shuki and he was from Israel.
He was kickboxing trainer,

751
00:34:35,861 --> 00:34:40,000
Magiro Gym and uh,
he had a place in Tarzana for awhile.

752
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:44,560
That's where I met him and he's an 
Israeli dude and him and his family,

753
00:34:44,561 --> 00:34:47,020
his wife is Israeli as kids.
And uh,

754
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,980
I had dinner over his house once,
after we worked out and they brought out

755
00:34:50,981 --> 00:34:52,300
Bongo drums,
dude.

756
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:57,630
And they start playing Bongo drums.
He's playing Bongo drums and his wife 

757
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,320
starts dancing and his kid gets up and 
starts dancing.

758
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,060
And I was like,
wow.

759
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:02,830
Like they're not even drunk dude.
There's no,

760
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,780
not even any alcohol with drinking 
water.

761
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,050
They just start dancing,
like playing the drums and dancing.

762
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,750
And I go,
you guys are so happy,

763
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:11,740
like your soap.
He goes,

764
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,730
you know why he goes into Israel?
I'm doing a terrible accident and Israel

765
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:17,320
every day,
it could be death,

766
00:35:17,321 --> 00:35:19,570
every day,
could be more war everyday,

767
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:24,990
so when it's not it's party party,
party and they're like eating this cool.

768
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,590
They had like Israeli food,
you know,

769
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,390
I don't,
I don't want to fuck up the names of the

770
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:32,710
fruit because there's quite a few years 
ago,

771
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:37,980
but uh,
they were eating their traditional 

772
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:37,980
Israeli food and playing the Bongo and 
the,

773
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,290
and the lady was dancing in the,
the little kid,

774
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:41,910
he has a little son,
his son was dancing.

775
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:43,050
I was like,
wow.

776
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,430
Like I felt like I felt privileged that 
they had showed me that,

777
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:47,890
you know,
like,

778
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,650
I don't,
I don't know anybody like you,

779
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,900
like here I'm hanging out with you.
Like this is their regular night for 

780
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:54,900
them.
They do this shit all the time.

781
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,190
They come home,
he comes home from training people,

782
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,520
he bust out the Pongo drums,
the wife starts dancing and they started

783
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:01,210
having a little party.
Like that's just,

784
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,930
they're free.
They're like loose and his,

785
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,930
the way he described it,
he was like,

786
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,130
in Israel,
it's just so dangerous,

787
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:13,420
you know,
especially this was like a early two 

788
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:13,420
thousands,
you know.

789
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,720
It's always dangerous over there though.
There's always something going on.

790
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,370
There's always,
they're always involved in conflict.

791
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:22,371
Mandatory military is mandatory.
You have to join the military for a 

792
00:36:22,371 --> 00:36:23,640
certain amount of years.
Everybody's military,

793
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:28,641
everybody's trained so it's a whole 
country of like and he's like a deep 

794
00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:31,791
comradery because there's not that many 
of them and there are a small country 

795
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:35,361
surrounded by a lot of Arab countries 
and then you add on top of that the 

796
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:38,901
fucking party and you will have been at 
the school of Israeli death squad fans.

797
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,010
Have you seen him at the?
Yes,

798
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,800
they are the people you called me and 
said they were waiting for you.

799
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:49,260
I got stuck at that fucking movie 
premiere Israelis.

800
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:54,810
When Israelis come to the store,
you better be fucking Karma.

801
00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:00,370
Heavy duty to the store.
I've been up there a couple of Tuesdays 

802
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:00,370
and three of them,

803
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:04,830
my man were from Israel.
The where's the fucking nuts?

804
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,560
You gotTa Love Them.
You gotTa love the comics from listening

805
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,440
to Rogan experience.
They started doing comedy.

806
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:19,710
I guess Israel's got a big comedy have 
seen starting just starting and that 

807
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,580
fucking want to be rough comics.
So the one kid's like,

808
00:37:21,581 --> 00:37:26,581
I'm trying to do fucking Hitler jokes 
and they throw and they throw me out to 

809
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:30,300
all these places.
What is he talking about?

810
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,980
He's doing these dirty jokes was rarely 
people throwing me out of restaurants 

811
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,530
and shit.
He goes,

812
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:42,540
I'm coming to America to do heart.
These motherfuckers sitting there going,

813
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,060
oh no,
where's the flying Jew?

814
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,240
I'm coming to America and you Hitler 
show.

815
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,360
He was pissed.
This kid he was doing,

816
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,760
he was serious.
He's like,

817
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:01,060
dog is a little rough.
He goes,

818
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:02,930
I'm update the little fucking Nazi 
jokes.

819
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,900
Shit.
They throw me.

820
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,770
I actually had him on the Ice House 
conduct here on the in town one gray.

821
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,310
What's his name?
What's his name?

822
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,320
Nice kid.
Nice.

823
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,960
There was two guys,
Shiny,

824
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,160
Nice Guy,
and then they came.

825
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:23,161
They both funds.
Female came on,

826
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:28,921
Israeli couple came.
They had just gotten married and their 

827
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:28,921
honeymoon.
They came to the comedy store.

828
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:31,000
That was their honeymoon and they will 
not grow.

829
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:34,240
They had the bucket with the booze.
They were young.

830
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,100
They came out,
pictures

831
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:40,400
hogs and we love it.
Yeah,

832
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,320
totally.
This kid was really.

833
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:41,650
Yeah.
Yeah,

834
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:42,520
that's right.
I'm telling you,

835
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,070
it's that might I left.
I was like,

836
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,910
this is real.
We're get them motherfuckers from Israel

837
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:53,911
to come over here to meet that squad and
do comedy and he was really funny and he

838
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:57,140
was really to stand up.
Did he do and killed?

839
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,480
He did kill Tony.
That's how I met him and then I invited 

840
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,221
him to the ice house because like if,
if somebody does really good on killed 

841
00:39:05,221 --> 00:39:05,890
Tony on vitamin D,
the Friday show and so he.

842
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,500
He was great and he did a podcast and 
everything.

843
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,010
What's his name I'm looking at.
There was a war.

844
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:16,300
You went back to Israel.
He's coming back because he sent me an 

845
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:16,300
email.
I had a blast.

846
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,070
That's awesome.
You know,

847
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,040
we were getting a lot of Australian 
people showing up at the store.

848
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:26,060
Yeah.
Australian people at the store and at 

849
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,770
the Ice House too.
And they go on like these comedy tourist

850
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,550
vacations like Australia,
they get like a month off of work,

851
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,040
like they don't like we have,
we get,

852
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,810
if you're lucky,
if you have a really good company,

853
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:36,010
you get two weeks off,
right?

854
00:39:36,011 --> 00:39:38,230
And they usually encourage you to not 
take both those weeks.

855
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:39,910
Right?
They'll incentivize you.

856
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,590
Right?
Isn't that how it works normally?

857
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,530
But in Australia I think they get a 
whole month off.

858
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,080
So I think these motherfuckers just go 
on vacation.

859
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,450
Just they just go chill places.
You know,

860
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:51,100
Joe Rogan,
you get into comedy,

861
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:52,300
Jamie,
you,

862
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,670
you know,
whatever you do.

863
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:59,671
Well in whatever market you start and 
you come to La and New York and you 

864
00:39:59,671 --> 00:40:01,410
succeed and they value,
you know,

865
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:04,510
the,
the whatever success you think it is.

866
00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:09,511
Getting on a TV show or movies,
which is becoming a really funny comic 

867
00:40:09,511 --> 00:40:09,511
and working.

868
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,240
I never dreamed of what's going on now.
Every time I wake up my feet hit the 

869
00:40:16,031 --> 00:40:18,730
floor.
I thank God for what's going on.

870
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:21,040
Now.
I don't want to do movies.

871
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:26,250
I don't want to do TV.
I just want this movement to keep 

872
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,700
growing.
This is not what I intended.

873
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,260
This is all new to me,
man.

874
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:34,450
This is all new to me and nobody asked 
for this.

875
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,050
Most comics asked for success to be rich
and famous.

876
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,050
The success.
We're getting something different,

877
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:44,380
man.
What a fucking reaching the globe,

878
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,950
you know,
and it's fucking hate that.

879
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,270
And I'm not saying that,
you know?

880
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,730
Yeah.
It was big here.

881
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,910
These little podcasts are reaching the 
fucking globe.

882
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,020
Joe Rowe,
was that his name?

883
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:02,910
You know when I'm at the store and 
somebody comes up to me with some 

884
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,480
additional different from Sweden or 
Finland or wherever they're from,

885
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:09,481
that's not California and they're like,
we came out to the store to see you and 

886
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:14,130
they do.
They do in these comedy fucking 

887
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,830
vacations.
This is Ella and that you get in your 

888
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,741
car and you drive home and you don't 
even know where this is coming from.

889
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:25,860
Somebody last night some girl came from 
like fucking Hong Kong and gave me a 

890
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,850
president.
I put the fucking Hong Kong Gardens,

891
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,860
Ventura last night she was here for 
Christmas.

892
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,720
She was like,
listen to you and fucking count.

893
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,690
That's you.
Never dreamt of that.

894
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:40,950
No,
and that's a way different type of 

895
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:40,950
success,
man.

896
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:44,630
There's definitely something happening 
because of these podcasts where you're 

897
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,761
getting this connection with people.
Like I did shows in Australia and they 

898
00:41:48,761 --> 00:41:48,860
might as well have been in Irvine,
you know,

899
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:51,110
it's just a bunch of cool people.
They said different accents.

900
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,810
What's his name?
Tom Martin.

901
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,960
Hey.
Hey Jr Morton t a l a n a v e j are on 

902
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,100
twitter.
All right.

903
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,010
All right.
All right.

904
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:02,660
I'll check that dude out.
Um,

905
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,310
but yeah,
no one would've ever thought this mean.

906
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,340
Brian,
this is like a.

907
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,900
we're almost at our sixth anniversary 
right now.

908
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:14,050
This is our 600 versus actually it.
Or is it somewhere around now?

909
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,760
Somewhere in this area?
I would say I fell on us.

910
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:21,761
It was the 29th.
I remember it was Christmas Eve because 

911
00:42:21,761 --> 00:42:21,980
it was weird being doing it on Christmas
Eve.

912
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,980
I'm pretty sure it was,
it was totally this month whenever it 

913
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:26,990
was.
It was definitely this month,

914
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,110
six years ago.
It's just fucking around on ustream.

915
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,280
Just answering questions,
you know,

916
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,500
Prehab Dashboard Board.
It's just I don't get time last night 

917
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:40,550
and it's weird.
I do this,

918
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,220
that Hong Kong gone.
I'll tell you why I like this place.

919
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,730
I like the comedy scene.
That little ventura comedy scene.

920
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,900
I liked the a comedy scene because it 
reminds me of comic,

921
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,860
that black comics.
Who that mean like she's a chick that I 

922
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,140
was having two people fucking behind me 
and me doing like three minutes.

923
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:05,190
It's good move and fuck you.
And I was just thinking about building.

924
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,160
This guy does calm me and caused coffee 
with cause I'll be drinking coffee.

925
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,500
What if I did stand up in behind me?
There's a bed,

926
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:17,850
there's a chick getting plowed for three
minutes and I just do a bit and then we 

927
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:17,850
added the bit.

928
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:17,850
That's it.
Yeah.

929
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:22,091
He could get them in the right position.
Where your head covers all the naughty 

930
00:43:22,091 --> 00:43:22,091
parts.
What do you think?

931
00:43:22,091 --> 00:43:22,850
Yeah,
this is what I'm saying.

932
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:28,060
Like you just his,
you can see at the top of his ass as he 

933
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,190
peaks like right above the back of your 
head and that's it.

934
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,470
It's just the top of his ass like 
panicky.

935
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,030
You can see that guy fucking a chick you
don't show it was declared as cable.

936
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:43,660
Hbo Can't you show like a guy's muffler 
while you're doing stand up with a suit 

937
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,990
and the Tuxedo buttholes on.
But you can show a.

938
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:48,320
But like he was always you what to the 
actual hole.

939
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:50,510
You could show naked,
but yeah.

940
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,030
Yeah,
definitely naked man or woman's butt.

941
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,770
But you can't,
you can't show the whole during sex.

942
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,300
I mean they were just sitting there with
a button,

943
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:02,600
the air maybe,
but it was fucking with youtube,

944
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:07,601
all it takes is a few people complaining
and you can take him down like you can 

945
00:44:07,601 --> 00:44:08,490
get taken down for offensive shit or 
they make it.

946
00:44:08,491 --> 00:44:10,460
You Click on that thing that says you're
over 18.

947
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,290
You know,
like they could set it up like that.

948
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:17,320
Except that I saw somebody,
I think Christina [inaudible] Jetski a 

949
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,860
post,
a natural childbirth video the other day

950
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:22,770
that was on youtube and that was one of 
the most graphical discussing things.

951
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,320
Beautiful.
But that scene up there,

952
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:32,740
it's just a bunch of young guys at the 
club broke that balls and now they have 

953
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:32,740
open

954
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:37,050
mic seven nights a week.
So if the club on a broken that ball's 

955
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,670
right,
these kids wouldn't have done that.

956
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:43,850
You know,
you have always been one of those guys 

957
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:43,850
that a lot of clubs in the beginning,
you know,

958
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:46,130
you were too dirty for a lot of clubs.
That's why you worked with Dick already.

959
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,750
Fucking rumors because.
But it's so weird.

960
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:53,780
So when you represent them,
I'm one of those guys I didn't know I 

961
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,231
had a fucking a seattle.
I'm the ground was the one where I 

962
00:44:57,231 --> 00:45:00,231
nurtured with ron reading those days 
because that was a club and they 

963
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:01,070
accepted crazy people.
But I,

964
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:01,950
but I couldn't.
Yeah,

965
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:03,990
all of us,
we were all down the difference.

966
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,670
When you're young,
you suck,

967
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,490
which I definitely did.
And you're not dirty.

968
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,220
At least you're not hurting anybody's 
feelings.

969
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,660
You're not,
you're not offensive.

970
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:16,860
But if you're young and you suck and 
you're dirty,

971
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,400
you're disgusting,
like you're going to just say the most 

972
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,560
disgusting.
You're not going to know where the line 

973
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:25,560
is,
so you're gonna fuck up.

974
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,851
Yeah,
but the first 18 months of my comic 

975
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,760
career,
I was clean until I saw lenny Clark's 

976
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:30,760
video and then I started going off a 
little bit.

977
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,800
Really 18 months.
Yeah,

978
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:33,930
because everybody put this fear of God 
into me,

979
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:39,070
man,
if I used to wear like a nerdy sued and 

980
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:39,070
go up there and fucking joke about 
whatever.

981
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,800
Well,
I've always said that you were the guy 

982
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,920
that surprised me the most with how you 
figured comedy out.

983
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:51,120
Like almost you,
you hit this point like when I first met

984
00:45:51,121 --> 00:45:56,121
you and you were first doing the store.
You would be the funniest guy in the 

985
00:45:56,191 --> 00:46:01,191
world in that parking lot.
Like we would all hang out in the 

986
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:01,740
parking lot and you would just be 
killing everybody in the parking lot.

987
00:46:01,741 --> 00:46:06,741
It was.
But then you get on stage and you would 

988
00:46:06,741 --> 00:46:07,890
stiffen up like you didn't.
You didn't have.

989
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,780
They didn't have the same relaxed way 
that you know,

990
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,560
I couldn't convert when I was doing my 
side of the stage to the stage.

991
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,780
It's funny how I had this conversation 
yesterday,

992
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:22,190
but a guy named Charlie Barnett when I 
watched Charlie Barnett,

993
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,200
I really,
really got it because he was the first 

994
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:27,200
guy.
You know how people say,

995
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:27,210
well,
he's a one trick pony.

996
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:32,210
Okay,
but at least he brings himself to 

997
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:35,000
Charlie Barnett was a standup comic at 
Washington square park with Dave 

998
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,650
Chappelle is his fucking apprentice.
I said,

999
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,780
fucking apprentice,
and then he the DC cab and they ended up

1000
00:46:39,781 --> 00:46:43,410
a couple of serious seasons of Miami 
vice will beat up Don Johnson because he

1001
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:45,660
was just crazy and look man,
whatever his name was,

1002
00:46:45,661 --> 00:46:50,661
but he transformed.
We wasn't a stage and person to the to 

1003
00:46:50,661 --> 00:46:55,491
the screen,
which is I always looked at that's 

1004
00:46:55,491 --> 00:46:55,491
really fucking hard and that's what I 
always wanted to do.

1005
00:46:55,491 --> 00:46:57,570
Not The screen,
but just the stage,

1006
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,600
how to get Joey Diaz is on the stage.
I didn't really want people to see the 

1007
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,891
real job ads.
I always was ashamed of jewelry vs so 

1008
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:08,820
people really want to see Joey Dsr.
I work clean,

1009
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:14,240
but then I watched that thing again,
Atlantic Clark because I got on stage 

1010
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,741
because the dice,
but people will call you don't want to 

1011
00:47:18,741 --> 00:47:19,800
be dirty because people won't give you a
work.

1012
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,290
So I actually fell for that shit.
We all did.

1013
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,760
And then I wore a suit like running 
Clark because I'm.

1014
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,090
But I couldn't sell a joke in the suit.
Even if I fucking wanted,

1015
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,800
I couldn't sell them a suit.
That's where eventually I lost the suit.

1016
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,400
You know,
you just have to lose things and you're 

1017
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:38,400
just learning through a process,
you know?

1018
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,390
And at the store,
you know where I got it and the belly 

1019
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:43,150
room one night,
that's where it came to me.

1020
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:46,840
Wheels was doing a show on a Thursday 
night at 11.

1021
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:50,470
There was like 13 people up there and I 
was bombing anyway.

1022
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:55,471
And I remember I turned to my side and 
for some reason I took myself back to a 

1023
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:59,810
corner.
I watched that movie without Pachino and

1024
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,220
about football and he has a great speech
for Jamie Foxx.

1025
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:04,660
One time it brings him to the side and 
he goes,

1026
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:07,270
listen man,
we got two minutes on the clock.

1027
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,850
We're going back to when you were a kid,
your mom just call you in for dental.

1028
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:15,860
You've got one play left.
Remember you used to run to the car and 

1029
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,751
make a left and do the same fucking 
thing and they scored a touchdown and 

1030
00:48:18,751 --> 00:48:21,991
sometimes we forget about that.
So what I did was I twisted my body 

1031
00:48:21,991 --> 00:48:25,540
around and I put myself on the corner of
78 and Kennedy Boulevard where I used to

1032
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:30,541
make fun of this guy with the limb.
Look at that janitor with the one eye 

1033
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:34,350
and that's when it started.
I stopped looking at them and I 

1034
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:38,281
remembered who I was.
I was letting them judge me with their 

1035
00:48:38,281 --> 00:48:38,710
eyes and I turned that and I never 
forgot that.

1036
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,780
I remember going home and going,
I'm onto something,

1037
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:45,100
and then little by little I started 
being made more up on stage.

1038
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,530
It was real quick and I stopped 
listening.

1039
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:50,620
The problem is we listen.
Well,

1040
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:53,500
they won't do this unless you're clean.
Oh.

1041
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:56,500
If you go for a showcase at the Improv,
you can't do this.

1042
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:00,160
You have to be yourself.
Unless you got to be yourself,

1043
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:03,280
you'll never move forward.
You'll never move forward and comedy.

1044
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:06,330
You have to tap into this if you don't,
you know,

1045
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:11,430
and everybody did it.
Everybody goes up there doing hokey 

1046
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:11,430
jokes in the beginning.
His snow is shame,

1047
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:12,280
snow,
embarrassment.

1048
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,520
You do topical material and Shit,
but once you start comparing that 

1049
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,810
topical material with what's going on in
your life and you open that up,

1050
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:24,870
it becomes a monster.
It takes a long time or it takes some 

1051
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:27,730
people longer than others,
but it's the work.

1052
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,130
Joe Roman,
it's always been the work man.

1053
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,580
You know,
I was watching Chappelle TNM stage Jesus

1054
00:49:33,581 --> 00:49:36,370
fucking Christ trail.
I see the 30 years,

1055
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:40,870
I see your 20 years,
but I see is 30 years.

1056
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:46,830
I see that 65 year difference.
He looks at a joke really differently 

1057
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,110
because he says he was great even when 
he was 19.

1058
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:55,170
Yes.
He was always the comedy club in 

1059
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:55,170
[inaudible].
Ninety three for men in tights.

1060
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:56,740
I paid it was him.
Nick Depalo.

1061
00:49:56,741 --> 00:49:59,950
What an open mic and he always had 
something.

1062
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:00,560
Yeah,

1063
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:05,490
she had a way of telling stories.
Two's got a genuinely appealing way.

1064
00:50:05,491 --> 00:50:09,060
Delivers his material like it makes you 
want to laugh,

1065
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,830
but you have a lot of that too,
man.

1066
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,400
You have a lot of that too.
You have a lot of genuinely appealing.

1067
00:50:14,401 --> 00:50:18,410
You have a different kind of chaos when 
you're on stage.

1068
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,710
What I was going to say is that it 
happened really quick like you,

1069
00:50:22,711 --> 00:50:27,711
where you went from being a guy who had 
a really hard time on stage most of the 

1070
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,010
time and then all of a sudden you are

1071
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,380
murdering man.
Just murdering.

1072
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,950
Just murder in.
I remember one time,

1073
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:34,400
uh,
we,

1074
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:38,240
we were doing gigs together like we were
doing gigs together.

1075
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:39,890
The nineties,
98.

1076
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:41,540
Yeah,
late nineties.

1077
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:43,500
We did some road gigs,
did a bunch of road gigs.

1078
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:48,501
And I remember,
I remember when I knew that you had 

1079
00:50:48,501 --> 00:50:51,401
caught fire because we were in New 
Jersey and I think this might've been 

1080
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:56,771
even before fear factor.
We were in New Jersey and you just 

1081
00:50:56,771 --> 00:50:59,690
caught fire.
We were at that old rascals and I went,

1082
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:02,120
Whoa,
and I remember thinking like,

1083
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:05,000
Joey just fucking hit this totally 
different level,

1084
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,990
like you just figured out how to be you 
and you were on stage and a lot of it is

1085
00:51:08,991 --> 00:51:10,880
because you're in jersey,
you know,

1086
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:12,450
and this,
there were animals.

1087
00:51:12,451 --> 00:51:13,650
He remembered that club was,
could I call?

1088
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,370
It was filled with savages.
Who was so fun?

1089
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,200
That rascals club.

1090
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,760
Jesus Christ.
That was fun.

1091
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,430
Where was that?
In West Orange?

1092
00:51:22,431 --> 00:51:23,600
Yes,
west orange.

1093
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,550
God,
Dan.

1094
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:26,510
Then there was the other one down the 
shore which wasn't.

1095
00:51:26,511 --> 00:51:31,511
It was really fun.
Was more like white people who was like 

1096
00:51:31,511 --> 00:51:34,091
more relaxed.
That one was filled with all sorts of 

1097
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:38,500
freaks.
Who was a great club and down so much 

1098
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,980
fucking strip club from that one,
like a really cold strip club with 

1099
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,810
Russian chicks.
They had no income then it had no heat 

1100
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:45,590
and the other comic took me in there.
I forget who it was.

1101
00:51:45,591 --> 00:51:49,550
I was freezing in the breeze and that 
was a creepy,

1102
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,190
but it was a fun rascals.
Oh,

1103
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,240
those was the dude's name that ran it 
again.

1104
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,810
Kind of the beautiful hair head though.
He'll call me today.

1105
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:57,570
Okay.
He,

1106
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,810
I have his number in that.
I forget his name.

1107
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,380
He'll call me today to wish me a merry 
Christmas after all those years.

1108
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:08,620
That's awesome because somebody will 
tell them that we would some last time 

1109
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,920
or the time before we mentioned him.
He called me that night.

1110
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:11,980
He owns a restaurant now in jersey.
Bailey.

1111
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:15,290
He goes to visit him.
The bus boys went in there going,

1112
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:17,630
oh my God,
Joe Rogan was talking about you.

1113
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:22,870
Some young college kids I like as 
waiters or waitresses or whatever the 

1114
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:22,870
fuck.
It was a good dude.

1115
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:27,970
He was always a good dude.
It's great to go down to the store now 

1116
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:32,110
and just sit in the back and watch calm 
and not say a word and slightly and I 

1117
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:35,610
watched him.
I watched our sandy hall and I watch her

1118
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,280
on why I watched it.
You know,

1119
00:52:37,281 --> 00:52:37,800
he's,
you know,

1120
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:40,400
he's talking about he should have taken 
the money now.

1121
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:45,730
Dave Chappelle.
I almost fucking died because I should 

1122
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:49,041
have taken them up actually.
I put my two feet down and taking the 

1123
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:49,041
money.

1124
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,850
Uh,
he's an interesting guy,

1125
00:52:52,851 --> 00:52:57,851
isn't he?
Because he doesn't really put material 

1126
00:52:57,851 --> 00:52:57,851
out anymore.
He just killing it,

1127
00:52:57,851 --> 00:52:57,920
right.
New Shit.

1128
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:01,040
Killing it everywhere.
But he's not like doing specials.

1129
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:03,080
I wonder if he's thinking about doing a 
special.

1130
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:08,860
Oh,
I'm sure they've made them 10 offers 

1131
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:08,860
today.
I wonder if he wants to because he's so.

1132
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:12,680
He's so different than any.
But like you can't predict that guy like

1133
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:14,870
his,
what he's done so far.

1134
00:53:14,871 --> 00:53:19,871
It's just so unusual.
Like they offer them this big money to 

1135
00:53:19,871 --> 00:53:19,871
do this thing and he's like,
you know what,

1136
00:53:19,871 --> 00:53:19,910
fuck this.
I'm going to Africa.

1137
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,890
Like he goes to Africa,
you know?

1138
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:25,010
And then he starts doing shows and parks
like Dave will have like,

1139
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:25,920
people maybe not

1140
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:31,100
never heard these stories,
but he would show up with like a PA 

1141
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,711
system,
like a little portable PA system in a 

1142
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:36,591
park in Seattle and he would put this 
little PA system down and just start 

1143
00:53:36,591 --> 00:53:38,550
doing standup in the park in Germany to 
find something on youtube.

1144
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:39,750
Yeah.
Surely.

1145
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:44,810
Shannon,
can you look at Charlie Barnett on 

1146
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:44,810
Washington Square Park?
Yeah,

1147
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:44,810
I've seen,
I've seen,

1148
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:44,910
I met Charlie.
No,

1149
00:53:44,911 --> 00:53:49,911
I met him.
I've seen just to just to show redman 

1150
00:53:49,911 --> 00:53:51,240
the gift will tell everybody what you 
still do.

1151
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:54,680
Shows outside.
Just like he would just show up in new,

1152
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:59,710
drop his hat in the ground and like do a
standup comedy routine and asked people 

1153
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:00,360
to contribute,
throw money in his hat.

1154
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:05,600
Wait,
look at this as what I used to go to 

1155
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,821
mcsorley's and get eight volumes for $10
and three mugs for a dowel and bring it 

1156
00:54:07,821 --> 00:54:12,471
back to the beginning,
Jimmy and put the volume of looking at 

1157
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:12,471
the red band.

1158
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:12,471
Wow.

1159
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:20,720
The volumes,
not Oregon who had some form of a sound 

1160
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,540
issue,
ladies and gentlemen.

1161
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:26,541
But what we're seeing for people that 
are just listening is this Guy Charlie 

1162
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:27,550
Barnett who has since passed away,
uh,

1163
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,720
he's wearing like some bread track pants
and a white tee shirt and a white 

1164
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,000
baseball hat and he's got this huge 
group of people circling him and he's in

1165
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:41,001
the middle of a park.
He just set up and he's doing stand up 

1166
00:54:41,001 --> 00:54:43,770
comedy like he's,
he's doing with no microphone here.

1167
00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:44,050
He goes,

1168
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:50,970
water ray gun.
We got a lot of fucking Puerto Reagan's 

1169
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,380
what?
I'm not gonna fuck with Niggas man.

1170
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:02,500
Cause y'all born with knives.
Y'All got me up and I wouldn't even know

1171
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:08,470
Bob.
And when you finish you're gonna get 

1172
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:11,140
passed out Bro.
Because I got into a fight with a Puerto

1173
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:16,140
Rican kid and I was winning.
I was bouncing around like sugar ray 

1174
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:16,140
Leonard.
I was Bam,

1175
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:16,310
Bam,
Bam.

1176
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:21,170
It was only about that tall.
Then all of a sudden they went like this

1177
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:26,730
and I was surrounded by small Puerto 
Rican family.

1178
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,140
I liked everything,
man.

1179
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:31,280
Let me borrow it.
Okay,

1180
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:38,400
so I liked the white white women.
Why would that one has no negros around?

1181
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,610
I don't see.
No.

1182
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,610
I liked the write.
Different nationalities go to work.

1183
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,150
Everybody goes to work different.
For instance,

1184
00:55:53,151 --> 00:55:56,300
Caucasian business man,
I need some white people glasses.

1185
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:02,420
It's like walking around,
borrowing from people had been holding 

1186
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:02,420
this lady's purse.

1187
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:07,340
What year is this to be this damn.
You can't see shit.

1188
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,480
I get why guys gotta work.
They got their briefcase.

1189
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,600
I didn't want just like the white man 
going to work.

1190
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:26,630
Watch this white guys that when I stood 
on a corner and go to work with talking 

1191
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:40,570
about get out should get there by payday

1192
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:50,040
just to show people what it was.
I mean this is a guy outside.

1193
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:55,070
Listen,
the reason why you have a microphone 

1194
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:55,070
that's control.
Yeah.

1195
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:56,060
He had no microphone.
He's still fucking control me.

1196
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:56,640
You didn't see?
No,

1197
00:56:56,641 --> 00:56:59,430
but I mean he got to the point where 
people were going down there.

1198
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:04,640
This is by like a college and my friend 
was a junky and I was like 16 and he 

1199
00:57:04,741 --> 00:57:06,540
used to go,
come over to the city with me.

1200
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,880
I'll buy you some volumes.
I go into the park or get heroin and 

1201
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:11,880
wait for me at the bar.
He would get me served.

1202
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,340
He'd get me three mugs,
a budweiser,

1203
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:19,730
and I'd sit there.
He come back when the second mug was 

1204
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:19,730
gone,
give me my eight pills.

1205
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:21,450
I take two of them and then he goes,
shoot heroin.

1206
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:22,590
And I'd go,
fuck it.

1207
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:23,820
Let me go walk around the park.

1208
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,510
And I saw this one time I saw this and I
was in shock.

1209
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:29,060
I'm like,
didn't like stand up.

1210
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:29,860
I'm having them,
nothing.

1211
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:34,870
I knew Richard Pryor and George Carlin,
David Brenner and I'm watching this guy 

1212
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:35,190
going,
what the fuck is this?

1213
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,050
And next thing you know,
I sat down,

1214
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:42,320
I started getting high and I watched it 
and I asked around and said he's here 

1215
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,950
every weekend or something and this is 
what he does.

1216
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:48,980
Then years later I found that,
but he would do that for four or five 

1217
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:52,011
hours,
but he would take breaks and Dave 

1218
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:52,230
chappelle coming as a young kid,
they've should,

1219
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:57,290
would take the bus from DC or something 
and go up there and do little septum 

1220
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:58,860
between.
He died from the banging.

1221
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:00,690
Yeah.
He died from the hip.

1222
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,860
He's the real deal that he was an old 
New York icon type.

1223
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:05,070
Fucking junkie.
Yeah.

1224
00:58:05,071 --> 00:58:05,880
He was a heroin guy.

1225
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,050
Right.
I own I,

1226
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,690
but it was just weird that he did.
I watched all those.

1227
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,130
I didn't know that somebody had taped 
them.

1228
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:16,190
That's amazing.
I did a show with Chappelle in Montreal 

1229
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:18,450
at the comedy festival in the nineties,
forget what year it was,

1230
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,760
but after the show was over,
we did it a club soda.

1231
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:26,500
We go downstairs and Dave just a puts on
a show on the street in Montreal.

1232
00:58:26,911 --> 00:58:29,280
People just walking by.
It's like gather around,

1233
00:58:29,281 --> 00:58:32,140
gathered around.
They just started doing standup up.

1234
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:34,620
Just stand up for like 20 people on the 
street,

1235
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:35,420
you know,
I,

1236
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,440
he incorporated like this.
There was a telephone pole incorporated 

1237
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,700
the pole into his routine.
He had a hat.

1238
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,610
He just put the hat down,
ask people to put money in it.

1239
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:49,670
I can these.
He just got off stage so he did a 

1240
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:49,670
professional show.
Went downstairs,

1241
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:50,040
was outside and just said,
fuck it.

1242
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,790
I'm going to do or do my own impromptu 
show out here on the street.

1243
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,820
It was fascinating.
I mean,

1244
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,380
who,
other than Charlie and him ever.

1245
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:01,260
Have you ever heard of doing that?
I'm sure some people have done it,

1246
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:06,590
but I.
those are the only two guys I've ever 

1247
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:06,590
heard was a black guy.
The Venice beach all the time.

1248
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:07,790
I could call you.
Yes.

1249
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:12,800
Yeah.
It's been a bunch of movies and that's 

1250
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:12,800
true,
right?

1251
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,380
He did a bunch of different stuff you 
have to do is show out.

1252
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:13,840
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1253
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:16,810
You did the Milwaukee one for a bunch of
kids and shit on the template.

1254
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:21,820
Did you ever do a little something 
summerfest like I had to comment on a 

1255
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:21,820
bus one time

1256
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:28,610
so people know,
like a Disney event called me up when I 

1257
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:31,811
was in New York,
75 bucks for an hour on the bus and go 

1258
00:59:31,811 --> 00:59:35,651
from seed to New York and three climbers
got to get up and do commonly what a 

1259
00:59:35,651 --> 00:59:37,600
fucking bonding experience,
bro.

1260
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:40,490
Jesus Christ,
30 gigs.

1261
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:46,570
I did a spot on New York comedy club one
time and after I get off I probably got 

1262
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:50,711
eight minutes dogs and six of it is just
God awful and I get off the stage and 

1263
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:52,020
some guy's like,
man,

1264
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:53,900
do you want to do my wife's birthday 
party?

1265
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:55,260
I'm like,
sure.

1266
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,690
And he's like,
what do you want to know?

1267
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:01,640
What it usually like give you like 1500.
I said one,

1268
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,970
he gives me the address.
Alpine,

1269
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:07,220
New Jersey off nine w make the right 
bangle with clothes.

1270
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:13,120
I fucking take a cab up there.
I'm about to score 1500 me and you know 

1271
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:13,120
me at that time.

1272
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,170
I'm looking.
I'm still looking for purchase.

1273
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,640
I was still a half a little fucking 
collect up.

1274
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:18,360
So you're ready to go?
Yeah.

1275
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:20,270
Where's the microphone?
There's no microphone.

1276
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,300
You got to go over by the pool on the 
other side of the pool.

1277
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:25,210
There's rocks and staying on top of the 
wrap.

1278
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,970
Stand up thought they were 80 yards away
from me.

1279
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:33,971
I'm up there telling Godzilla jokes.
Slow death of debt can get off.

1280
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:38,330
I was so embarrassed that the guys like 
listening.

1281
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:40,920
I only got like $900 in cash.
You want to check it out?

1282
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:44,960
Just give me a ticket.
I took that my whole house and I walked.

1283
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:50,050
I started walking somewhere.
I hitchhiked and picked me up and made 

1284
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:51,230
them drop me at the bridge.
I walked over the bridge and got like an

1285
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:52,900
eight ball of coke.
Had the stone barest.

1286
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:56,530
Could you really have jokes?

1287
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:01,160
Do you remember what year that God will 
never attack New York City.

1288
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:06,830
Okay,
because can you imagine Godzilla coming 

1289
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:07,220
out?
Hudson and going or something?

1290
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:12,290
All the pollution and shit.
He got like this and go back on the 

1291
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:12,290
wall.
That horrible.

1292
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:14,070
That was my big job.
That was my big job.

1293
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,010
That was it.
That was it.

1294
01:01:16,011 --> 01:01:21,011
I thought that was.
And you know at that time the Puerto 

1295
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:21,740
Rican,
something happened with the Puerto Rican

1296
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:24,230
navy.
They bumped into a.

1297
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:29,150
They bumped into a barge,
like some Puerto Rican cruise boat,

1298
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:32,800
bumped into a barge and the New York 
side and they broke the buyer,

1299
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:34,670
so everybody on the boat had a job at 
the time.

1300
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:38,240
Everybody had to jump into the fucking 
water and that was the joke.

1301
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:38,900
I said,
you know,

1302
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:44,500
last Tuesday in New York,
a bus full of a cruise boat,

1303
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,080
Puerto Ricans hit the 40 Puerto Ricans 
in the Hudson.

1304
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,660
That's new.
That was my other big clothes.

1305
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,460
That was it.
And that's nothing new.

1306
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:58,430
It's environmental and reset it.
Somebody told me they'd clean it up.

1307
01:01:58,431 --> 01:01:59,390
The Hudson.
So true.

1308
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:07,030
He couldn't clear.
They wanted to know how many fucking 

1309
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:10,460
sperm loads I shot now.
Often when I was a kid,

1310
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:15,730
I used to go to Binghamton both for 
dinner and they had a movie theater in 

1311
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:15,730
Edgewater,
New Jersey.

1312
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:20,050
Edgewater is cap land where they shot 
capital edge or what it was supposed to 

1313
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:20,100
be and my

1314
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,860
friend had a restaurant h and b,
Dinah.

1315
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:22,710
I used to go down there.

1316
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:25,600
What exactly were they shot that?
That bar.

1317
01:02:25,601 --> 01:02:27,460
I used to go in there and buy the little
bottles of blackberry.

1318
01:02:27,461 --> 01:02:28,780
Brandy for us when we were kids.

1319
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,110
And uh,
they redid all that shit down.

1320
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:33,770
Have you seen that in New York?
No,

1321
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,600
that is beautiful.
Fucking now.

1322
01:02:35,601 --> 01:02:36,440
That's where I stay now.

1323
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:39,320
I stayed in edgewater here.
I take the ferry over.

1324
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:41,780
How long does that take?
The ferry?

1325
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,300
Ten minutes.
I take the ferry over.

1326
01:02:44,301 --> 01:02:46,490
I jumped in my fucking cab.
I go to 20th street.

1327
01:02:46,491 --> 01:02:48,590
I do Gotham,
I do the stand.

1328
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:51,890
I take a cab back to the ferry.
How hard would it be to live in New York

1329
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,360
and take a boat across from New Jersey?
Every day people do with everyday back.

1330
01:02:56,361 --> 01:02:58,080
How many people it matter fact get the 
car.

1331
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:01,340
I gave the card to a lot of people,
but I gave the car to Ari.

1332
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:03,290
I would think that that would be like a 
smart move.

1333
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:08,660
Yeah.
You get a boat and he could try and then

1334
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:11,960
go do your thing with Louis does.
Isn't he a big guy?

1335
01:03:11,961 --> 01:03:14,180
He has his own boat.
He definitely has a boat.

1336
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,800
I don't know if that's what he does or 
if he.

1337
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,440
I think he lives in Manhattan.
No,

1338
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:22,550
but I mean I feel like it wouldn't be 
that hard to get across that water,

1339
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:25,580
like just water.
Just get across.

1340
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:30,850
That's way better than a stupid bridges.
Like if you could figure out a way to 

1341
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:33,860
like to live like that.
Just take Uber's on one side,

1342
01:03:33,861 --> 01:03:37,130
Park your car on the other,
like the way to go.

1343
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:41,190
New York,
but they've taken that city down.

1344
01:03:41,191 --> 01:03:46,191
Eventually it don't.
You don't need to be a genius or a 

1345
01:03:46,191 --> 01:03:47,480
scholar and nostradamus stupid Joey 
Diaz.

1346
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:52,590
You pull up the Lincoln tunnel.
Now there's guys in full gear with Nazi 

1347
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:57,861
helmets.
Fucking machine guns under their arms 

1348
01:03:57,861 --> 01:04:00,060
and dogs and they go up to every fucking
car dog and his fucking 50 of them.

1349
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:02,600
The bridges.
You see him everywhere.

1350
01:04:02,601 --> 01:04:06,120
And when I went to take my wife to the 
tree at the saks fifth avenue,

1351
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:09,290
you could see the motherfuckers snipers 
up on the fucking roof.

1352
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:12,380
Stores ain't fucking around.
When you're walking around New York,

1353
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,970
you like,
I could see this.

1354
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:18,690
They're really going after the bridge.
Like my friends were oh genome.

1355
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,410
They work a hoboken and all those guys.
I'm I,

1356
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:26,480
when I did the whatever factory now I 
guess all these cops have to do details 

1357
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:31,700
because they want to take that bridge 
outdoor and they want to take that 

1358
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:33,270
fucking bridge tunnel.
That's going to be a nightmare.

1359
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,830
When I was walking around in New York,
had to,

1360
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,920
I could see it,
I could see how he could go down.

1361
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:40,620
And that's a big city with a lot of 
fucking people.

1362
01:04:40,621 --> 01:04:45,621
Joe Rogan.
It's tough to control all those people 

1363
01:04:45,621 --> 01:04:45,621
in that area.
You know?

1364
01:04:45,621 --> 01:04:47,020
It's so much different than any other 
city.

1365
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,740
To my God,
man,

1366
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:51,130
you get there,
you just see the magnitude of it all.

1367
01:04:51,131 --> 01:04:52,450
Just kind of like sets in and you're 
like,

1368
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,420
no wonder why people can't leave this 
place if you get used to this.

1369
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:58,630
There is no place like that place,
so bizarre.

1370
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:03,370
It's 7 million plus people smushed into 
the smallest little area.

1371
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:08,790
It's not that big if you,
if you look at all the buildings that 

1372
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:12,031
are tucked in.
I remember I had a hotel room once and 

1373
01:05:12,031 --> 01:05:12,230
it was on a corner and it was in.
It was like,

1374
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,780
sometimes it's cool to be on the 
outside,

1375
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:16,810
like at a friend lived in Brooklyn and 
he had a cool view from the river.

1376
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:20,260
Like you look from his apartment,
you see the whole city skyscraper.

1377
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:25,500
The whole skyline is pretty beautiful.
But there's something cool about being 

1378
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:25,500
in the middle of it all.

1379
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:25,930
And this,
uh,

1380
01:05:25,931 --> 01:05:30,931
this hotel I stayed at was on a corner 
and I'd like to look out the window on 

1381
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:32,830
both sides and just fucking,
it's like a science fiction movie.

1382
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:37,030
Just giant constructed buildings to the 
left and to the right.

1383
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:40,300
And you're in the middle of all of it.
Hundreds and hundreds of windows.

1384
01:05:40,301 --> 01:05:43,630
Everyone looking out at each other.
Everyone's in there watching a little TV

1385
01:05:43,631 --> 01:05:45,010
shows,
doing their little thing,

1386
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:48,760
but you're in the middle of all this 
crazy Saifai,

1387
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:52,300
beehive type thing.
You know where we live,

1388
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:55,960
we would drive to each other's houses.
There's like a yard.

1389
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:57,970
There's a space.
You're pulling your driveway.

1390
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:59,070
Hey,
come on in.

1391
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:00,370
You know,
park in the driveway.

1392
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:02,050
It's like normal stuff.
You know,

1393
01:06:02,051 --> 01:06:03,700
like you get out of the house.
Hey,

1394
01:06:03,701 --> 01:06:08,701
this is your house right over there.
That's his house and no it fucking 

1395
01:06:08,701 --> 01:06:08,701
stacked.
Everybody's

1396
01:06:08,701 --> 01:06:09,800
stacked,
stacked on top of,

1397
01:06:09,801 --> 01:06:11,030
stacked,
on top of stack,

1398
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:12,800
smashed together.
Stack,

1399
01:06:12,801 --> 01:06:13,460
stack,
stack.

1400
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:18,280
Everybody jammed into these boxes.
Blue Cars,

1401
01:06:18,281 --> 01:06:20,890
little fucking yellow cars.
And Uber's everywhere on the ground.

1402
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:24,880
No one gets anywhere.
When gridlock hits crosstown traffic,

1403
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:30,020
there is reason why Hendricks wrote that
fucking song and that was in the 

1404
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:30,580
seventies and the sixties.
I guess he wrote it right.

1405
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:34,210
That when you,
when you were in the Manhattan,

1406
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:36,940
grew up gridlock.
Crosstown traffic.

1407
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:42,060
I feel like this is insane.
Like why the fuck would anybody live 

1408
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:42,060
here?
You can't go anywhere.

1409
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:42,970
Jam,
jam,

1410
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:43,990
jam,
jam,

1411
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:45,430
jam,
jam,

1412
01:06:45,431 --> 01:06:46,180
jam,
jam.

1413
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:48,700
There was moving anywhere and there's so
many fucking people

1414
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:54,140
and everywhere you look,
there's Delis and restaurants and 

1415
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:56,480
storage units and parking lots and 
fucking this business and that business 

1416
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:56,480
door and that door.

1417
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,730
Just just a vortex of energy.
Just luck.

1418
01:07:00,731 --> 01:07:03,850
They want for that fucking shit.
Incredibly.

1419
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:06,340
We're at edgewater just driving around 
and we saw this thing.

1420
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:10,570
The next day I go ask,
ask around Terry go on the computer like

1421
01:07:10,571 --> 01:07:11,500
two days ago.
She's like,

1422
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:16,501
oh my God,
just to move in that half a mil and then

1423
01:07:16,691 --> 01:07:21,691
whatever your mortgages,
it's 1700 flat just for maintenance 

1424
01:07:21,691 --> 01:07:22,210
fees.
Yeah,

1425
01:07:22,211 --> 01:07:23,860
a lot of that.
A lot of maintenance fees,

1426
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:28,890
maintenance fees of $1,700
and that's if you don't use the gym or 

1427
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:31,720
the pool or the garage if you use all 
that stuff,

1428
01:07:31,721 --> 01:07:35,920
there's another 890 our fucking fee.
This fee,

1429
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:38,500
you got to buy the water from them.
She goes,

1430
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:43,510
it was fucking crazy.
And at the end of the day you got a 

1431
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:44,790
motherfucking apartment.
That's all you got.

1432
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,070
Call quality,
Condo,

1433
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:48,900
whatever the fuck you want to call it.
It's a fucking apartment,

1434
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,960
my friend.
Then yeah,

1435
01:07:49,961 --> 01:07:53,050
you've got the view of uh,
the Manhattan skyline,

1436
01:07:53,051 --> 01:07:58,051
that's what you're paying for you to 
think about how much of one of those big

1437
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:03,300
apartment buildings must be worth 
because every one of those units is a 

1438
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:03,970
million bucks,
a million bucks or more.

1439
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:08,420
Milan have a much more.
I saw some that were like $5 million.

1440
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:10,810
So you gotta be kidding.
This is a normal apartment,

1441
01:08:10,811 --> 01:08:13,270
silver lake and there's like 5 million 
bucks,

1442
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,100
but this is crazy.
I couldn't live

1443
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:16,970
like that.
Could you?

1444
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,950
I couldn't live like that if I,
if I like,

1445
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:25,010
if I had the experience of living there,
like if it was normal to me,

1446
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:28,160
like I think the people that do live 
there,

1447
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:30,560
when you get used to driving around on 
the subway,

1448
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:34,970
riding around and calves,
you get used to where all the clubs are.

1449
01:08:34,971 --> 01:08:36,920
You do your little routine and getting 
the,

1450
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:42,500
getting the airport to take off two 
cities and he worked the road.

1451
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:44,840
You get used to it,
you get used to like a tail does it.

1452
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:50,530
A lot of those other guys do it.
But once you get used to space and once 

1453
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:54,761
you get used to like being able to go 
dip out and dip back in without that 

1454
01:08:54,761 --> 01:08:55,730
much trouble,
like it's way easier to like live in the

1455
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:59,390
valley and then drive into the store on 
a Friday night.

1456
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:04,390
Then it would ever be,
if you live somewhere like that equally 

1457
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,660
far away from Manhattan and he wanted to
get in to do a spot.

1458
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:09,320
Like that's a to our proposition.
Like you've got to be ready.

1459
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,270
You got to be ready to enter that 
machine,

1460
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,600
you know?
Especially if you're going to do it at 

1461
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:16,600
like 7:00
at night.

1462
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,090
So what time you leave your house,
you leave your house at 5:30

1463
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:18,470
for a 7:00
show.

1464
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:23,560
Well then you leave your wallet at home,
get your phone and the driveway.

1465
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:28,970
It makes sense to hit and hit.
Let's say if you hit and let's say you 

1466
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:32,621
live in Brooklyn,
you got to take the train into 

1467
01:09:32,621 --> 01:09:32,621
Manhattan,
something like that.

1468
01:09:32,621 --> 01:09:32,621
Right?
You get used to that.

1469
01:09:32,621 --> 01:09:34,850
I think the town in Brooklyn or 
something like that.

1470
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:38,840
Even if he just takes the training,
you do four or five spots.

1471
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,890
He does the cell.
Have this?

1472
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,160
Yeah.
You do a couple of spots and get back on

1473
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:45,740
your train and go home and 1:30
now with Uber's too,

1474
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:50,741
it's just so easy to do it.
It's so easy to just use your car shows 

1475
01:09:50,741 --> 01:09:54,050
up in a couple of minutes.
So less so much less hassle,

1476
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:56,750
you know?
Especially because like with cabs,

1477
01:09:56,751 --> 01:10:01,751
you don't know if a caps coming.
So what are you going to do in 

1478
01:10:01,751 --> 01:10:01,751
Manhattan?
You're going to call a cab company.

1479
01:10:01,751 --> 01:10:02,270
Say come get me on this.
Nobody ever does that.

1480
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:04,220
You tried to flag one.
So you try to find one.

1481
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:09,580
You go walking around looking for one,
but now you just press a button on your 

1482
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:09,860
phone and they like,
we'll be there in three minutes.

1483
01:10:09,861 --> 01:10:10,560
All right,
cool.

1484
01:10:10,561 --> 01:10:13,880
Because of the calves are getting easier
to get.

1485
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:18,910
I got to count every time I want to do 
this time real funky in zero to 100 

1486
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:19,850
bitch lift.

1487
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:23,660
Just lax [inaudible].
You ever take Uber?

1488
01:10:23,661 --> 01:10:25,010
Yeah,
I take it up one time.

1489
01:10:25,011 --> 01:10:28,130
I took a black one time through.
I've taken a few times in New York.

1490
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:30,530
I use it all the time in New York.
I could do.

1491
01:10:30,531 --> 01:10:32,450
I think I could do it like he's enjoying
it.

1492
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,960
He's enjoying it.
He likes doing it.

1493
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:39,380
It'd be harder for me because I have 
kids and I just don't think New York 

1494
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:39,380
City,
the best place for kids,

1495
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:40,550
and maybe I'm wrong,
just seems.

1496
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:45,640
First of all,
that brake dust can't be good for you 

1497
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:45,640
and there's.
There's break.

1498
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:50,240
If you.
If you feel like I'm finding out what 

1499
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,980
the fuck you breathe,
go look at your wheels with your cars,

1500
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:56,420
wheels and just stick your finger inside
the rim and get that black shit all over

1501
01:10:56,421 --> 01:10:57,140
your finger.
Will.

1502
01:10:57,141 --> 01:11:02,141
That just says it doesn't just go on 
your wheel and stick their only know as 

1503
01:11:02,141 --> 01:11:06,701
you like.
See like crazy traffic like on fifth 

1504
01:11:06,701 --> 01:11:07,870
avenue or something like that.
You'd see Broadway traffic just paint,

1505
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:08,690
Bam,
Bam,

1506
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,540
Bam.
You're breathing in brake dust.

1507
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,890
One hundred percent.
That stuff's in the air,

1508
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:14,160
so

1509
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:19,160
it's not just the carbon fuel.
A residue like the exhaust from cars,

1510
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,140
whatever.
Fires are being burned,

1511
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:24,140
whatever,
a gas ovens and that.

1512
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:26,430
It's not just that,
but it's brake dust,

1513
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:31,510
brake dust is everywhere and you're 
getting that shit in your lungs 100 

1514
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:32,700
percent.
It's not good for you.

1515
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,560
It's just not.
You know,

1516
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:39,561
and they've shown their studies.
It's that think that living in a high 

1517
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:40,980
populated city like New York and take as
much as 10 years off your life,

1518
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,350
just living there doing exactly the same
thing,

1519
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:48,590
living exact same choices,
but living in a polluted environment 

1520
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:49,080
like downtown La.
It was probably a good example of that.

1521
01:11:49,081 --> 01:11:51,000
Right?
Downtown gets Funky,

1522
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:52,680
you know,
it gets fucking polluted,

1523
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:56,100
but it's still more open than say New 
York or anything like that.

1524
01:11:56,101 --> 01:12:00,150
You could at least see the sky.
Sometimes you can,

1525
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:02,220
sometimes you can't,
but la gets pretty stinky.

1526
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:06,240
Ellie can get pretty bad if we get 
stagnant and the winds don't blow,

1527
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:07,200
and then the,
the,

1528
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:10,200
the pollution just sits.
You know how you crest,

1529
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:15,230
like if you come over from Encino and 
you see the valley and you see that 

1530
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:17,190
fucking horrible brown cloud,
that's real.

1531
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:20,070
Assign an illusion and you don't see 
that in the desert.

1532
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,350
If you go out where there's no people 
that doesn't exist,

1533
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:26,250
that exist because of people burning 
things that you're breathing that in.

1534
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:31,370
Everyone's breathing that.
In 93 I lived in New York and I would 

1535
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:33,070
get up at seven and go into the city.
I live in cliffside.

1536
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:37,290
I worked in New York and going to New 
York and bum around and then sometimes I

1537
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:39,540
take a shower at the gym.
I joined a boxing gym.

1538
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,290
I just go there for the locker.
Basically I would if the bag a little.

1539
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:48,291
I didn't know what I was doing and I 
would fuck it and just go out at night 

1540
01:12:48,291 --> 01:12:51,540
and I remember sometimes I wouldn't take
a shower at the gym at six.

1541
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:56,750
I was busy and I get home at 11 and I 
take a shower and you'd see what will 

1542
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:01,170
come out of my hair and I'd just be 
walking around Manhattan guys.

1543
01:13:01,171 --> 01:13:06,171
I didn't go anywhere else.
I'd just be walking around Manhattan 

1544
01:13:06,171 --> 01:13:06,171
given cabs doing this,
dropping off packages.

1545
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:11,180
It was.
You could see I didn't do anything 

1546
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:11,180
residue.
It was just this darkness,

1547
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:15,891
like it was like Jesus Christ,
what the fuck have I been used to it 

1548
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:19,581
after awhile,
but it really stuck with me like just 

1549
01:13:19,581 --> 01:13:22,251
walking around Manhattan six or seven 
hours with do this to me.

1550
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,870
Like it really will get more blackheads 
there.

1551
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,330
My hair,
like when you wash it,

1552
01:13:27,331 --> 01:13:29,610
you would see the fucking dirt bike.
Just not real.

1553
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:34,700
A lot of dirt,
but you see that you have something on 

1554
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:34,700
your skin.
Let me ask you this.

1555
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,490
Does this make sense to you?

1556
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,250
They can make a big giant building like 
the empire state building.

1557
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:43,310
They can make a big ass building.
Why can't they make a big ass air 

1558
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:44,200
filter?
Well,

1559
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:47,010
if you're going to put up that many 
buildings and have that many people,

1560
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:49,800
not many cars.
How about your build a giant air filter?

1561
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:52,830
I mean like they sell air filters for 
your house.

1562
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:58,010
Like my daughter's allergic to cats.
We're finding out we have two cats and 

1563
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,670
so now we have to shave the cats.
So I've been shaving them.

1564
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:04,730
First of all.
It's adorable when you see the line 

1565
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:04,730
cuts.
Yeah,

1566
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:08,181
they get the line cuts and the and then 
the other thing is when you shave him 

1567
01:14:08,181 --> 01:14:12,440
it's just almost like skin,
so it's just a little bit of flour and 

1568
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:12,440
it must feel so

1569
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,470
much better when you pat him because 
when I pad,

1570
01:14:14,471 --> 01:14:16,150
especially like the little girl with the
big one,

1571
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:21,151
that boy the boy too,
but when I pat them they just start 

1572
01:14:21,151 --> 01:14:24,001
fucking riving like you're making them 
come and they love it.

1573
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:25,990
They love it.
They love it when you're,

1574
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:27,250
uh,
when you're petting them,

1575
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:32,251
when you've shaved them all down.
But we have this air cleaner that we 

1576
01:14:32,251 --> 01:14:33,310
have to put in her bedroom because she,
she starts sneezing and shit.

1577
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:36,640
We're finding out that she's not 
terribly allergic but allergic enough so

1578
01:14:36,641 --> 01:14:39,640
we have to figure out what to do.
But they make these air filters.

1579
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,200
It makes a big difference.
You put them in your room,

1580
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:43,630
sucks.
All the dander and all this stuff out of

1581
01:14:43,631 --> 01:14:48,631
the air cleans it.
It seems like if you can make a giant 

1582
01:14:48,631 --> 01:14:50,941
ass building,
why can't you make a giant ass air 

1583
01:14:50,941 --> 01:14:50,941
filter that sucks?

1584
01:14:50,941 --> 01:14:54,930
All that dirty brown,
stinky air out and cleans it like that 

1585
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:56,380
can't be impossible to do.
Just doesn't seem like it should be.

1586
01:14:56,381 --> 01:14:59,020
If you can make a big building and you 
can make a big fan,

1587
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:01,420
he can make a big fucking air cleaner,
can't you?

1588
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,600
It makes sense.
But then you got to clean it every two 

1589
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,751
minutes or something from the man who 
brought you parachutes on commercial 

1590
01:15:09,751 --> 01:15:12,220
airplanes that,
that sucks.

1591
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:14,820
A lot of people get use to the cat.
Uh,

1592
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:16,180
our,
Geez.

1593
01:15:16,181 --> 01:15:19,060
I know a lot of ex girlfriends that 
would first like,

1594
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:20,620
Hey,
I'm allergic to cats.

1595
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:25,621
And then after a few years or whatever,
they would stop being as allergic 

1596
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:25,640
though.
A lot of India.

1597
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:27,430
You vaccinated them with your Dick?
Yeah.

1598
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:33,720
Slowly but surely you feel anything,
any non cat allergy DNA into their body 

1599
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:36,550
and they assimilate it.
I was at a gas station the other day and

1600
01:15:36,551 --> 01:15:39,540
they were selling poppers and I recently
was at a nitrate,

1601
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:39,840
you mean?

1602
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:41,290
Yeah,
yeah,

1603
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,600
it's a popper.
It even said like it was like the little

1604
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:47,020
jar and everything and it's like.
And I went to a party and I actually saw

1605
01:15:47,021 --> 01:15:50,200
my first person actually using poppers.
What you.

1606
01:15:50,201 --> 01:15:51,850
But a guarantee.
That's not the same thing.

1607
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:57,060
I guarantee you the stuff they're 
selling it at a gas station is not like 

1608
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:57,070
Emile nitrate.
That's highly illegal,

1609
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:57,910
is it?
Yeah.

1610
01:15:57,911 --> 01:15:59,150
I think what they're doing is there's 
the,

1611
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:00,670
you know,
how those boner pills,

1612
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:06,090
like you buy boner pills,
the gas station and pretend they're 

1613
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:09,150
herbs,
but it's really cialis or Viagra or 

1614
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:11,341
something like that.
I think with these things are something 

1615
01:16:11,341 --> 01:16:14,041
similar to that.
Just how like bath salts were never 

1616
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:16,561
really bath salts.
They could just call it whatever they 

1617
01:16:16,561 --> 01:16:16,561
want and call poppers as long as it's 
not email nitrate.

1618
01:16:16,561 --> 01:16:20,140
But was bachelor that salt was,
they would call it bath salts.

1619
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:22,780
So they could sell it,
it would say not for human consumption,

1620
01:16:22,781 --> 01:16:24,250
but it,
when it really is,

1621
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:28,690
was they had done something to meth.
So they say like,

1622
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:31,180
this is an idiot's way of describing 
this,

1623
01:16:31,181 --> 01:16:33,310
right?
Just let me get that out of the way.

1624
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:36,850
When you describe something like a 
molecule like,

1625
01:16:36,851 --> 01:16:37,960
um,
uh,

1626
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,450
like the,
the chemical that your brain produces,

1627
01:16:40,451 --> 01:16:45,451
dimethyltryptamine,
it's an end dimethyltryptamine that's 

1628
01:16:45,451 --> 01:16:49,351
illegal,
but there's a thing called five meo 

1629
01:16:49,351 --> 01:16:52,450
dimethyltryptamine that's legal because 
they fucked up and they didn't,

1630
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:57,480
they didn't list it so you could get 
that stuff and it's like a cousin of 

1631
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,390
DMT.
It's called five Meo DMT.

1632
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:03,870
Well,
that's a similar to what they did with 

1633
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:03,870
this math thing.
They would take meth and then they would

1634
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:08,521
just change a little bit of it,
add an oxygen molecule and a carbon 

1635
01:17:08,521 --> 01:17:12,091
molecule,
whatever they have they have to do and 

1636
01:17:12,091 --> 01:17:12,091
that turns it into something

1637
01:17:12,091 --> 01:17:12,530
different.
So it's not illegal,

1638
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,650
but it's,
it'll fuck you up,

1639
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:18,440
fuck face eating,
fuck you up.

1640
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:21,680
So then they sell it as bath salts 
saying,

1641
01:17:21,681 --> 01:17:22,640
yeah,
throw this in the bath,

1642
01:17:22,641 --> 01:17:23,690
hop in there,
wink,

1643
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,970
wink,
and everybody knows you're just going to

1644
01:17:25,971 --> 01:17:30,971
go smoke it.
And they smoke this stuff and it blows 

1645
01:17:30,971 --> 01:17:31,520
their fucking brains out because they 
don't even know what it is.

1646
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:35,660
But you're selling like high potency 
meth at truck stops.

1647
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:36,890
I mean,
that's what they're selling it.

1648
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,500
They were selling those little 
convenient marks was weird.

1649
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:44,501
Twenty four gas stations,
that's where they were selling it and 

1650
01:17:44,501 --> 01:17:46,991
you can just go in and buy meth,
but through a loophole and so all these 

1651
01:17:46,991 --> 01:17:49,820
people were buying this shit.
I am for years.

1652
01:17:49,821 --> 01:17:53,840
You go into a place and the east coast 
and he always had a rose in the tube.

1653
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:55,520
Yeah,
it's a crack pipe.

1654
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,870
I didn't know that.
Yeah,

1655
01:17:57,350 --> 01:18:02,350
it's not really a rose.
The rose is throw the fucking blows 

1656
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:02,390
away.
Smoke crack out of that thing.

1657
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:03,780
You didn't know that?

1658
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,820
Well,
I knew it because my friend Johnny was a

1659
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:09,740
crackhead.
Can you believe that?

1660
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:10,950
They suck,
right?

1661
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,690
How many doors did you go from here?
You're like a rose fucking crackhead.

1662
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:18,560
Would they had to figure out a way to 
sell those things,

1663
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:22,640
so they sold like a little tiny glass 
face with a rosewood.

1664
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:27,670
They should've bought some of these 
because it was in west Hollywood and 

1665
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:27,670
they were lined up at different logos on
it.

1666
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:27,830
Just like.
Yeah,

1667
01:18:27,831 --> 01:18:28,750
I hear that.
The knows.

1668
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,770
Come on man.
Those are.

1669
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:35,020
Those are dmt pipes to.
That's what you smoked dmt out or how 

1670
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:35,930
crazy is that?
That's the loophole right there.

1671
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:37,800
Yeah,
and then it's just a beauty about paying

1672
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:40,520
a nickel on getting an attorney.
I'd sit with them and going,

1673
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:43,850
how can I sell this butter flour and 
it's sunny.

1674
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:49,540
It's beautiful.
Can you believe Brian fucking 40 when I 

1675
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:50,610
found that I'm supposed to be the king 
of swing,

1676
01:18:50,611 --> 01:18:55,220
it's fucking crack.
It is hilarious that keep on finding out

1677
01:18:55,221 --> 01:18:57,380
these horrible things that I should have
known a long time ago.

1678
01:18:57,381 --> 01:18:58,550
Like,
like on the toaster,

1679
01:18:58,551 --> 01:19:00,740
the one through 10.
That's how many minutes.

1680
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:02,600
It's not like hot and cold.

1681
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:09,140
Really?
Yeah.

1682
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:10,100
I wonder why.
I was like,

1683
01:19:10,101 --> 01:19:15,101
why does seven take so long?
Such a fucking idiot.

1684
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:18,080
I'm making toast.
Go Jesus Christ.

1685
01:19:18,081 --> 01:19:19,670
I need a faster toaster.
Yeah.

1686
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:24,700
Something that gets you a seven quicker.
I had no idea that that little thing 

1687
01:19:24,921 --> 01:19:27,380
when you zip up your pants,
that little knob thing,

1688
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:31,370
if you put it down that Luxor zipper 
down like you know,

1689
01:19:31,371 --> 01:19:32,780
like when you're zipping it up,
the handle,

1690
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:35,870
if you put the handle down,
it locks it up.

1691
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:41,160
You just kind of like zip up your pants 
and not think about it and they later 

1692
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:41,160
you're like,
why is my zipper down?

1693
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,690
It's because you didn't just do that 
extra little.

1694
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:47,090
You didn't have that one.
I don't understand what you're saying.

1695
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:49,310
This,
this handle thing like this right here.

1696
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,000
Yeah.
Thanks.

1697
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:51,350
This.
Put it down,

1698
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:52,310
put it down.
It locks.

1699
01:19:52,311 --> 01:19:57,311
It lets the lock the lock and it's the 
whole technology unlock until you lift 

1700
01:19:59,071 --> 01:19:59,810
it up.
Yes.

1701
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,450
I didn't know that.
I have like five more.

1702
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:09,460
Just realize what I'm trying to do it,
but it's bent down that I literally 

1703
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:09,460
can't

1704
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:10,500
unzip my pants.
Fascinating.

1705
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:12,720
Yes.
I had no idea what makes sense,

1706
01:20:12,721 --> 01:20:14,370
right?
Otherwise it just wouldn't work.

1707
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,310
Zippers are bullshit.
I'm tired of Zippers.

1708
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:22,400
Man Hates Zipper is always down.
Someone's always like your zipper's 

1709
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:22,400
down,
man.

1710
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,790
No,
it's not always.

1711
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:28,820
It doesn't.
I don't think it matters where these 

1712
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:29,430
goddamn stretchy pants.
All my pants are like fake jeans.

1713
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:34,080
They look like jeans to fake jeans.
I had one that was wearing,

1714
01:20:34,081 --> 01:20:35,240
that had fucking,
uh,

1715
01:20:35,241 --> 01:20:40,241
it had a tie.
It was a diesel pair of diesel and they 

1716
01:20:40,241 --> 01:20:41,870
stretch.
And you tie in like sweatpants and P.

1717
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,800
I would show people and they would 
scream.

1718
01:20:43,801 --> 01:20:45,210
No screaming.
No,

1719
01:20:45,211 --> 01:20:46,560
no.
You can't wear that.

1720
01:20:46,561 --> 01:20:49,040
You can't wear that.
You wearing stretchy pants that time.

1721
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:54,050
Like why?
Why can't I remember people saying like 

1722
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:55,500
these girls at the comedy store,
like you can't wear those.

1723
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:57,240
You can't wear those.
Like I'm wearing them.

1724
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,310
Why can't I wear them?
Why can't I wear.

1725
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:01,290
You can't wear pants.
Jeans Look Great.

1726
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:02,760
Fucking fat cheese.
Look,

1727
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:05,190
they look real.
You got me hooked on him.

1728
01:21:05,191 --> 01:21:07,730
I don't have to like that.
And you order them online?

1729
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:09,150
Yeah.
These are.

1730
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,720
I have no affiliation with this company.
They're called barbell jeans.

1731
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:13,920
Yeah.
Great.

1732
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,660
I love them.
They're so stretchy.

1733
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:18,030
They're so stretchy.
They move like sweatpants.

1734
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:20,010
They feel like there's no resistance.
Like,

1735
01:21:20,011 --> 01:21:25,011
well we're normal pants.
I feel like I'm wearing a straight 

1736
01:21:25,011 --> 01:21:25,650
jacket now.
It's like wearing pajamas outside.

1737
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,920
I got a new company that I'm.
It's also,

1738
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:30,720
but this is a sponsor of the podcast.
It's called Mizzen and main.

1739
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:34,070
And they make these clothes that are 
made out of this really light stretching

1740
01:21:34,071 --> 01:21:35,550
material,
like a button up shirt,

1741
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:40,990
button up shirts always.
Like it looks like a normal button up 

1742
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:41,070
shirt,
but you don't feel anything.

1743
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,510
You move with it.
It's like,

1744
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,850
like a,
like a light cotton t shirt.

1745
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:46,620
It's amazing.
It's stretches.

1746
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,970
It moves with you everywhere you go.
Like I'm like,

1747
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:51,630
I just want.
Does it have the thickness look of it or

1748
01:21:51,631 --> 01:21:52,380
is it like,
you know,

1749
01:21:52,381 --> 01:21:57,381
yeah,
let's get buffed body or your nipples 

1750
01:21:57,381 --> 01:21:59,091
are showing through.
It was probably definitely show through 

1751
01:21:59,091 --> 01:21:59,100
it because my nipples are ferocious.
But uh,

1752
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:04,410
it looks like a regular shirt.
It doesn't look like anything unusual 

1753
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:04,410
about it.
But I'm,

1754
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:06,390
I'm that close to going fucking 
sweatpants and fanny pack everywhere.

1755
01:22:06,391 --> 01:22:11,391
I'm not close.
I'm not close to just completely thrown 

1756
01:22:11,391 --> 01:22:12,250
in the towel and picked up school.
Surprise track suit.

1757
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:17,940
A walking stick.
I might even get like some yellow 

1758
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:17,940
hunter,
s Thompson glasses,

1759
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:19,620
like just yellow where I'm indoors.
Outdoors.

1760
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,800
Fuck it.
Instead.

1761
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:25,380
Hunter s Thompson always had the 
cigarette lighter.

1762
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,260
That's a vapor pen instead of the 
cigarette holder.

1763
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:32,310
It's the same thing as a vapor pen,
just going full yellow glasses,

1764
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:34,290
track suit,
fanny pack.

1765
01:22:34,291 --> 01:22:36,270
That's my new look.
Toe Shoes.

1766
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:41,300
I don't give a fuck.
I'm going to wear those to Vibram 

1767
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:41,300
fivefingers.
Those already.

1768
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:41,300
Fuck yeah,
and where you were man.

1769
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:44,100
Nowhere to hide those things.
I to really see me and I'll keep them at

1770
01:22:44,101 --> 01:22:47,820
the house collapses.
There's something about what you wearing

1771
01:22:47,821 --> 01:22:51,120
glasses like that.
You have no business in reality.

1772
01:22:51,121 --> 01:22:52,370
You're not.
You're not a.

1773
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:55,470
you're not doing business in reality.
You're here for your own thing.

1774
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,870
You're here to party.
That's so crazy.

1775
01:22:57,871 --> 01:23:00,060
That was the best.
This guy was fucking.

1776
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:03,660
It was the best,
but he would wear those yellow glasses.

1777
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,590
I'll be honest with you guys.
When I saw him,

1778
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,980
I didn't know who the fuck he was when 
you saw him in real life and Woody 

1779
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:10,980
Creek,
right?

1780
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:10,980
Yeah.
I saw him.

1781
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:14,670
I didn't know who the man and then 
somebody told me and then I went back 

1782
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:18,421
down there and I saw a William Bill 
Murray that fucking place.

1783
01:23:18,971 --> 01:23:21,550
You know Bill Murray would go visit him.
Oh yeah.

1784
01:23:21,551 --> 01:23:24,340
Everybody would go visit him.
People would go visit him.

1785
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:24,970
How crazy

1786
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:27,380
have you ever read fear and loathing in 
Las Vegas?

1787
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:28,780
It's been years.
God Damn.

1788
01:23:28,781 --> 01:23:30,470
It's good.
It's.

1789
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:33,730
It's good dude.
He's got some great passages in it.

1790
01:23:33,731 --> 01:23:37,580
There's some great moments that he 
captured on paper.

1791
01:23:37,581 --> 01:23:39,170
They just make it yo.
Fuck.

1792
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,900
He had this ability to hit these.
These,

1793
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:46,960
these rare patches of insight is rare 
areas.

1794
01:23:46,961 --> 01:23:51,961
We just break into these rare areas and 
make these passages make these 

1795
01:23:51,961 --> 01:23:52,580
paragraphs that you just go,
whoa.

1796
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:57,910
God Damn.
Like talking with him must have been 

1797
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:58,970
fucking fascinating.
I read the biker book.

1798
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:04,110
Yeah.
Hells angels was one of the first books 

1799
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:06,101
I read.
That was the first one who the author 

1800
01:24:06,101 --> 01:24:08,021
was.
I didn't even know what an awful was at 

1801
01:24:08,021 --> 01:24:09,701
that time.
With that book was though was like a 

1802
01:24:09,701 --> 01:24:12,170
much more of a regular journalism book 
was a book about the hell's angels.

1803
01:24:12,171 --> 01:24:14,240
Like they had disputed some of the facts
in it.

1804
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:15,980
You know,
they said that a lot of stuff he made,

1805
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:21,030
it was made up and he tried to make it 
all look like a lot different than it 

1806
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:24,281
really is in the evidence to.
That was when he started doing his best 

1807
01:24:24,281 --> 01:24:26,890
work was all that.
His best work was like fear and loathing

1808
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:31,900
and the Kentucky.
The Kentucky Derby is decadent and 

1809
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:32,480
depraved.
Fear and loathing and the campaign trail

1810
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:37,660
like that stuff where he combined 
fiction and reality like that guy sunk 

1811
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:40,250
presidential candidates.
There's this guy named Ed Muskie who was

1812
01:24:40,251 --> 01:24:42,560
running for president and monitor is 
Thompson.

1813
01:24:42,561 --> 01:24:47,561
Started talking about him,
neat bringing in a Brazilian doctor 

1814
01:24:47,561 --> 01:24:51,191
because he's addicted to Ibogaine,
so he starts spreading these stories 

1815
01:24:51,191 --> 01:24:53,480
about these rumors that there's a 
Brazilian doctor coming to visit.

1816
01:24:53,481 --> 01:24:56,390
Ed maschine starts with having fucking 
mental breakdowns.

1817
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:58,620
This guy is on the campaign trail and 
he's.

1818
01:24:58,650 --> 01:25:03,650
He's reading these stories about him 
bringing in some Brazilian doctor and 

1819
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:03,650
he's fucking falling apart.

1820
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:08,620
100 just making it up.
He's just making up all this shit about 

1821
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:08,960
him having an Ibogaine addiction and 
that he,

1822
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:14,020
when he was on stage,
you could see him in the full grips of 

1823
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:16,721
an Ibogaine addiction.
Nobody even knew what the fuck Ibogaine 

1824
01:25:16,721 --> 01:25:18,410
was and so he just made up this rumor 
and then when they asked him about it,

1825
01:25:18,411 --> 01:25:18,770
he goes,
no,

1826
01:25:18,771 --> 01:25:23,771
there really was a rumor and I started 
the rumor just like you would joke 

1827
01:25:24,441 --> 01:25:29,441
around about mixing reality and fiction 
and he would combine the two of them 

1828
01:25:29,451 --> 01:25:34,451
together.
Like he was the only guy that ever did 

1829
01:25:34,451 --> 01:25:34,730
that an openly did it.
Like you would read it and he would call

1830
01:25:34,731 --> 01:25:37,670
it Gonzo journalism and you would know 
that like as you were reading it,

1831
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,460
that this wasn't all real.
Like some of this stuff.

1832
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:43,020
It was just complete total fantasy.
You know,

1833
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:45,410
we were right outside of barstow.
When the bats,

1834
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:48,140
what is it when the drugs were going to 
take hold,

1835
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:54,010
like the stories about like all the 
different shit that they had in the 

1836
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:54,320
truck where they were headed to vegas 
from barstow.

1837
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:58,460
The bats in the air,
the fucking acid trip in the,

1838
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:03,650
in the reception area of the Vegas Hotel
when they just like screaming about golf

1839
01:26:03,651 --> 01:26:04,190
shoes

1840
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:07,610
and he sees everybody turned into 
lizards like this is fucking bizarre,

1841
01:26:07,611 --> 01:26:09,390
bizarre shit.
You know.

1842
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:12,890
He was a very,
very unusual guy.

1843
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:15,410
He took a high acid brown.
He did,

1844
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,430
but he went a different way with it.
What's really fascinating about him,

1845
01:26:19,431 --> 01:26:24,431
he went like guns and fucking living in 
the woods and just blowing your brains 

1846
01:26:24,431 --> 01:26:29,411
out with cocaine every night.
Like he went a totally different way 

1847
01:26:29,411 --> 01:26:29,411
with it.
He didn't go like the Kumbaya way,

1848
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:31,720
you know,
like all these other dudes.

1849
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:35,390
They got together and they,
they sat Indian style and they,

1850
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:40,660
they played Indian music and chimes and 
burned incense and they went the 

1851
01:26:40,761 --> 01:26:43,670
spiritual route and he just,
he went to.

1852
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:48,710
Otherwise the total other way he went 
get acid and then get a gun and then go 

1853
01:26:49,641 --> 01:26:51,680
outside.
He was shooting golf balls.

1854
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,420
Yeah,
like to put them in the hole.

1855
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:58,450
He was playing golf with a gun so he 
would shoot the balls to put them in a 

1856
01:26:58,450 --> 01:26:58,460
hole or something like that.

1857
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:02,110
Just shit that it was a,
you know,

1858
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:06,110
I was living in snowmass village and I 
was hearing different rumblings.

1859
01:27:06,111 --> 01:27:09,080
I was still 19 or 20,
so I don't know if I was allowed in that

1860
01:27:09,081 --> 01:27:12,640
bar that much.
I would just go in there with Keto Keto,

1861
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:13,700
get weed.
That was it.

1862
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:17,720
That was his name was keith corn and he 
would take me to keith corn.

1863
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:21,050
His life's mission was to get the best 
weed in Colorado.

1864
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:23,990
I told him from now on,
you get bag of weed,

1865
01:27:23,991 --> 01:27:25,910
knock on my door,
give me the 40 bucks.

1866
01:27:26,630 --> 01:27:28,590
So he would come to me and go,
that's his guy.

1867
01:27:28,591 --> 01:27:30,080
And with a click,
he's got this weight.

1868
01:27:30,081 --> 01:27:32,460
It's killing people.
We got to go down to the tablet.

1869
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,250
It was hunter.
I know that.

1870
01:27:34,251 --> 01:27:39,251
It wasn't until I was selling 100 fresh 
washer or something that was selling 

1871
01:27:39,251 --> 01:27:39,280
weed there or something.

1872
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,820
How far was that from when you were 
living?

1873
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,210
Uh,
maybe 10 minutes down.

1874
01:27:44,211 --> 01:27:47,480
Snowmass village hill and then go loop 
around.

1875
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:51,440
And then go into woody creek.
So you lived in boulder and you lived in

1876
01:27:51,441 --> 01:27:52,370
Aspen?
I lived in.

1877
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:58,120
I lived in a town called basalt first 
and right around the corner from Goldie 

1878
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:00,590
Hawn and motherfucking Kurt Russell 
thing,

1879
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:05,890
the river,
whatever river that was the salt is a 

1880
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:08,070
golden pond.
No river of the pond.

1881
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:13,080
You fuck this up a little.
This is route 82,

1882
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:15,950
which is one of the most dangerous.
He's trying to map entry.

1883
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:18,890
So it goes north and south.
This is Aspen,

1884
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,180
right?
Straight ahead.

1885
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:24,200
You have to go up three miles to go to 
snowmass village and then you have to go

1886
01:28:24,201 --> 01:28:26,360
over here to go to woody creek.
Okay.

1887
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:31,420
But the salt was down here about 40 
minutes from town and you had to go up 

1888
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:31,760
and up a hill.

1889
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:33,650
And that hill,
this was,

1890
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:36,590
it was maybe a gun store and a 
restaurant,

1891
01:28:36,591 --> 01:28:39,860
but there was a place I had never.
I was in New York City fucking kid.

1892
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,620
And when I first saw this,
I got addicted to this.

1893
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:47,240
Worse than cocaine.
I would walk from the salt every day and

1894
01:28:47,241 --> 01:28:49,550
walked from Holland hills.
That's where where I lived,

1895
01:28:49,551 --> 01:28:54,551
in fact,
Dean Cain had home that locked up and 

1896
01:28:54,551 --> 01:28:55,460
back there.
You go in there and you get to go,

1897
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:57,220
Bro.
The best idea,

1898
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:00,800
I'd smoke homegrown.
The girl maximum me was growing,

1899
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:02,310
grown.
I should cut it with a scissor

1900
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:06,060
and it got me more high than the shit.
I'm paying fucking 54 now.

1901
01:29:06,061 --> 01:29:11,061
This shit was fucking deadly.
I was an 18 year old kid and I would 

1902
01:29:11,061 --> 01:29:14,631
walk.
I'd get this guy $7 and he'd give me a 

1903
01:29:14,631 --> 01:29:17,841
fishing pole and I throw it into the 
roaring creek and after two minutes,

1904
01:29:18,511 --> 01:29:23,511
an idiot,
a blind moron to catch a trout and he'd 

1905
01:29:23,511 --> 01:29:25,110
come over.
You got something and he'd come over and

1906
01:29:25,111 --> 01:29:26,940
he'd help you.
Oh Shit.

1907
01:29:26,941 --> 01:29:28,470
Little trout.
He'd take it off it,

1908
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,750
Cook it and cook it,
and they'll give you a potato salad,

1909
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:36,080
bread and beans,
and you'd have your own fish that he 

1910
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,380
grill up for it really right there.
Nineteen 83.

1911
01:29:37,381 --> 01:29:39,810
I was hooked on that.
I wouldn't even get a job.

1912
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,200
I took all my savings and I would go 
there.

1913
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:44,990
That was my exercise,
to walk down and get a fish and walk,

1914
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:46,860
walk down and get a fish.

1915
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,660
None of the animals that come on when we
squat,

1916
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:52,380
we would squat and do dead lifts and 
fucking cleans my roommates.

1917
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,720
That's what they're in there shooting 
the ball,

1918
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:57,790
shooting back there and eating.
When he vetoed chop up other,

1919
01:29:57,830 --> 01:30:02,830
it was amazing.
That's all I had was I never heard of 

1920
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:05,901
that and I'm over here is old snowmass 
and they used to have a gas station 

1921
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:10,221
there and the guys from New York,
so it was always New York time and that 

1922
01:30:10,221 --> 01:30:12,690
was so bizarre and he sold sap brand hot
dogs there in 1982.

1923
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:15,720
They were that much New Yorkers,
but that's what I saw.

1924
01:30:15,721 --> 01:30:18,720
Goldie Hawn and that little girl for the
first time,

1925
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:24,080
that little girl was just a little girl 
and I used to see at that gas station 

1926
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:24,840
and what is her name?
The trust,

1927
01:30:24,841 --> 01:30:29,841
the famous actress and old snowmass had 
another road that went this way and this

1928
01:30:29,881 --> 01:30:31,080
is a tremendous story.

1929
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:34,370
It was because all of this at the time 
in the eighties with kingpins,

1930
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:37,080
lot of kingpins lived there and that's 
where they go.

1931
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,200
They had this cocaine kingpin,
a white guy lived there,

1932
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,750
not the gray bar that we discussed early
on your show.

1933
01:30:42,751 --> 01:30:47,751
This other guy and the feds are trying 
to get them so they fucking put cameras 

1934
01:30:48,330 --> 01:30:49,740
on all the,
you know,

1935
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:54,741
all street things to watch him.
They fucked up and they tapped into the 

1936
01:30:54,741 --> 01:30:58,641
cable tv,
so his house was being shown to 

1937
01:30:58,641 --> 01:30:59,640
everybody on their tvs.
So Joe Rogan went home,

1938
01:30:59,641 --> 01:31:03,600
put on Channel Two and it's me and my 
living room smoking a joint.

1939
01:31:03,601 --> 01:31:08,601
Watching that fucking guy sued the 
government for fucking resilience 

1940
01:31:08,601 --> 01:31:13,010
because they didn't know how to reverse 
that ahead of time on this was an 

1941
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:13,050
accident.
I had four channels.

1942
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:18,080
That's hilarious.
One Channel Two and all they played was 

1943
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:18,080
Charles Bronson movies.

1944
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:22,640
I was in heaven because at the Holiday 
Inn and Aspen right there by the 

1945
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:27,291
airport,
Clint Eastwood would go to every night 

1946
01:31:27,291 --> 01:31:27,291
and get drunk really?
So every bus in night,

1947
01:31:27,291 --> 01:31:29,030
but I was a kid.
What year was this?

1948
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:34,050
Is 80 three hand and the rumor was all 
you had to do was go to the Holiday Inn 

1949
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:37,080
and clinics will be at the bar drinking 
and bro,

1950
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:39,990
everybody would say I was too young to 
go to the fucking bar.

1951
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:43,380
I was dying to meet Glenys.
What are you fucking kidding me?

1952
01:31:43,850 --> 01:31:48,850
But I couldn't go and it was just stuck.
This was just a complete different 

1953
01:31:49,081 --> 01:31:50,240
fucking city.
This.

1954
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:52,620
Did everybody get attracted to that one 
area?

1955
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:57,780
Aspen just had this law let.
Let's,

1956
01:31:57,810 --> 01:32:00,100
let's.
Aspens are great

1957
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,240
place.
It's a great place.

1958
01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:03,760
It's a great place.
It's a lot of rich white people though.

1959
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:06,400
Pawns and rich white people might get 
bored.

1960
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:08,200
They fucking did you see?
It's different now.

1961
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:11,980
Yesterday they were talking about some.
That check was in Vegas,

1962
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:13,810
a chicken.
We were just talking about.

1963
01:32:13,811 --> 01:32:15,960
Goldie Hawn,
her ski instructor.

1964
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:17,740
She gets Hudson.
Kate Hudson?

1965
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:18,520
No,
but the mother.

1966
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:22,060
Goldie Hawn gave her a ski instructor.
Mercedes Benz for Curtis.

1967
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:25,040
Oh Shit.
They give you a cause.

1968
01:32:25,150 --> 01:32:26,980
You know what I'm saying?
Like that's how they roll up there,

1969
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,760
but it's an evil fucking.
Like Ted Bundy was up there.

1970
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:34,390
Ted Bundy killed people in snowmass 
village at that hotel.

1971
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:37,270
Really?
Ted Bundy escape from the Aspen jail.

1972
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:42,520
This place has a really weird Ted Bundy 
killed people all the way down in 

1973
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:42,520
Florida too,
right?

1974
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,150
Florida,
Colorado,

1975
01:32:43,151 --> 01:32:44,650
seattle.
Jesus.

1976
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:51,820
This is a really weird part of Colorado.
And I've told you before that I,

1977
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:54,700
80 for asthma was to cocaine capital of 
the country.

1978
01:32:55,330 --> 01:33:00,330
All that coke was getting shipped up 
there for all these hunter Thompson 

1979
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:00,720
types.
Nicholson.

1980
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:06,180
All these motherfuckers were up there.
Then how weird that they all decided to 

1981
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:06,940
go there.
No TMZ,

1982
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:09,350
no cameras.
And they can get that deck.

1983
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:14,360
So there was a bar called Patty bugattis
that had a swimming pool right in the 

1984
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:17,941
middle.
So people be fucking pumping in the 

1985
01:33:17,941 --> 01:33:20,731
middle of a fucking pumped.
They jumped in the pool with their 

1986
01:33:20,731 --> 01:33:22,711
clothes on the Aspen club.
Fucking what's his name?

1987
01:33:23,321 --> 01:33:24,780
Had a huge club up there.
Uh,

1988
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:26,770
you know,
uh,

1989
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:29,870
the guy.
What's that guy that sings about Tequila

1990
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:32,420
wasted away?
Buffett,

1991
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:37,560
Jimmy Buffett had a club called the 
paragon of the biggest bond on the west 

1992
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:37,630
coast,
like nine fucking rooms,

1993
01:33:37,631 --> 01:33:37,930
bro.

1994
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:41,770
Really huge.
The paragon over the paragon where these

1995
01:33:41,771 --> 01:33:46,771
apartments where the employees state and
I became friends with one of the 

1996
01:33:46,771 --> 01:33:47,140
waitresses and that's why I fainted from
a bong hit.

1997
01:33:47,141 --> 01:33:49,870
One time the bong hit,
I fucking fainted.

1998
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,790
I would sit on the back like talking 
shit,

1999
01:33:53,150 --> 01:33:54,970
I'll do it.
And also a Mexico,

2000
01:33:54,971 --> 01:33:57,010
they they're waking me up because it's 
so filled up there.

2001
01:33:57,011 --> 01:33:58,900
That's where the air is really fucking 
thing.

2002
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:01,600
We were talking to this guy who lives in
aspen.

2003
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:04,240
He told me he woke up one day and there 
was an elk on his back.

2004
01:34:04,241 --> 01:34:06,420
Porch was screaming,
fuck you.

2005
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,630
You know they scream when they,
when they are Horny,

2006
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:13,740
learn in the Rut.
The big ass elk was sitting on his 

2007
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:13,740
porch.
Clop clop,

2008
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:14,140
clop clop

2009
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:19,160
the screaming instead.
It was like 5:00

2010
01:34:19,161 --> 01:34:24,161
in the morning or something like that.
They looked through the curtains and 

2011
01:34:24,161 --> 01:34:27,050
this thousand pound animals like right 
there behind the glass screen.

2012
01:34:27,051 --> 01:34:29,180
When I was in all,
when I first moved up there,

2013
01:34:29,270 --> 01:34:31,700
Colorado one that put me over the top 
was cut.

2014
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:34,970
Bloomix.
Bloomix restaurant was a restaurant.

2015
01:34:34,971 --> 01:34:39,971
You had a call,
make a reservation and you had to meet 

2016
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:40,580
them in a certain location and park your
car and then he got on the sled.

2017
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:44,080
Dogs pulled you to the restaurant.
Oh,

2018
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:47,120
two seatings.
You had a 7:30

2019
01:34:47,121 --> 01:34:49,040
seating and the 9:30
seating.

2020
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:54,310
That's how the only way they do it and 
then they pull you out of there and 

2021
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:57,040
sledge mush.
They take you on a couple of miles,

2022
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:58,150
a couple miles.
What is it?

2023
01:34:58,151 --> 01:35:03,151
Daytime.
You go up there and see how they train 

2024
01:35:03,151 --> 01:35:05,181
the dogs.
Daytime it became a different tourist 

2025
01:35:05,181 --> 01:35:05,181
attraction.

2026
01:35:05,181 --> 01:35:08,680
Really cool.
And then you go over a place called 

2027
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:11,020
independence pass independence pastors 
when you think you're a bad mother 

2028
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:15,421
fuckers.
Independence pass is only open three 

2029
01:35:15,421 --> 01:35:17,381
months a year.
It's only open from June to two second 

2030
01:35:17,381 --> 01:35:21,821
week of September and it cuts your time 
from Denver to aspen by like an hour,

2031
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:24,710
but it's only open three months because 
of the two lane,

2032
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:27,740
two lane road that now a lot of people 
can handle.

2033
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:30,990
One time I went down,
I had a big tough friend from Jersey.

2034
01:35:30,991 --> 01:35:33,530
He sat in the back and duct and got on 
the floor.

2035
01:35:33,531 --> 01:35:38,531
He can handle it.
It's that scary Joe Road if you don't 

2036
01:35:38,531 --> 01:35:41,670
want a lot of my car come over,
but at the end of independence road and 

2037
01:35:41,670 --> 01:35:46,331
the other side,
they had the black warfare and you went 

2038
01:35:46,331 --> 01:35:49,901
in there.
He rented a room and the lady had a 

2039
01:35:49,901 --> 01:35:52,370
wool,
black wolves everywhere and the ones in 

2040
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:52,370
the morning.

2041
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:54,530
That's what you at night.
That's all you hear is how.

2042
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,420
Who,
who got all the wills eye,

2043
01:35:57,421 --> 01:35:59,440
black wolf,
fucking dog.

2044
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:02,840
I know how many times I went in there 
because that's a great.

2045
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:04,910
You know,
now it's all changed.

2046
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:10,180
You know,
money has really taken video that past 

2047
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:10,180
independence,
independence pass.

2048
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:14,260
Is that what they did in the shining?
The shining is the other place where 

2049
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:18,611
it's the most.
That's the most visited spot in the 

2050
01:36:18,611 --> 01:36:19,040
country.
People think it's a grand canyon,

2051
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:22,310
but it's really estes Park Colorado 
because you bend over and,

2052
01:36:22,311 --> 01:36:22,850
and,
and the,

2053
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:26,840
the doing something with that hotel.
The Stanley hotel,

2054
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:31,870
that's the best brunch on a Sunday in 
the country.

2055
01:36:32,421 --> 01:36:37,421
Like the brunch there is known to be 
like fucking outrageousness where they 

2056
01:36:37,421 --> 01:36:41,210
shot the shining Stanley hotel.
They doing something that they're really

2057
01:36:41,211 --> 01:36:46,211
going to take that part of the hotel and
turning it into a museum for the 

2058
01:36:46,211 --> 01:36:46,211
shining.

2059
01:36:46,211 --> 01:36:47,420
That doing something that they're going 
to make a real man's.

2060
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:50,640
You know that the bushes.
Yeah.

2061
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:56,220
They're gonna.
Make a real one just like they did in 

2062
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:56,220
the movie.
Yeah.

2063
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:56,900
And take a look at independence pass.
It's a scary fucking road.

2064
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:02,080
Well you,
you ever done the pch all the way up to 

2065
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:02,080
San Francisco?
Yes.

2066
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:06,600
Some fucking moment.
That moment when you're looking to the 

2067
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:06,600
right of you and you're like,
oh,

2068
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:11,350
okay.
Especially when you're coming back from 

2069
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:12,050
San Francisco and you're on the outside.
Sped up right now.

2070
01:37:12,051 --> 01:37:14,960
This is a bird.
This is 82 to aspen.

2071
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:17,870
So I guess you're starting.
Wow.

2072
01:37:17,871 --> 01:37:19,910
It's changed a lot with those fucking 
treats.

2073
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:21,350
So beautiful though,
man.

2074
01:37:21,351 --> 01:37:25,010
There's something about mountain views 
that to me is the best view.

2075
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:27,800
Like there's a lot of cool views like 
the oceans are really cool.

2076
01:37:27,801 --> 01:37:30,230
View Meadows,
a really cool view,

2077
01:37:30,231 --> 01:37:33,940
but to me mountains and trees,
there's something about that too,

2078
01:37:33,941 --> 01:37:37,820
just like I don't even know how to 
describe it.

2079
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:43,060
It's so natural and powerful.
The idea of all these plants growing out

2080
01:37:44,601 --> 01:37:49,370
of the ground and reaching up to the sky
and they're thick and dense everywhere.

2081
01:37:49,371 --> 01:37:54,371
You're just surrounded by plant life and
then you look up in this spectacular 

2082
01:37:54,371 --> 01:37:55,980
snow cap mountains

2083
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,670
and blue sky and floating clouds and 
trees and you know,

2084
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:04,671
out there as all just wild life man.
Just fucking girls is where it gets 

2085
01:38:04,671 --> 01:38:08,990
scary.
This is where it gets good right there 

2086
01:38:08,990 --> 01:38:10,890
and it gets even fitter at parts.
Yeah.

2087
01:38:10,891 --> 01:38:15,891
This is it.
You've got to trust the other people in 

2088
01:38:15,891 --> 01:38:15,891
their side of the road.
That's the problem.

2089
01:38:15,891 --> 01:38:18,060
Same thing with the pch and it was so 
wild and here I am.

2090
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:20,980
Then I lived there,
you know,

2091
01:38:21,010 --> 01:38:26,010
83 and then I left back to him.
Then I went back in [inaudible] 85 and 

2092
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:26,010
that's when I really got into trouble up
there,

2093
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:30,851
but it was so weird amongst all this 
beauty that was just fucking cocaine 

2094
01:38:30,851 --> 01:38:32,010
trade.
Look at the bright side.

2095
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:32,970
Oh yeah.

2096
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:41,680
Oh fuck man.
You think you'll move back there 

2097
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:41,680
eventually,
Joe?

2098
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:45,910
I mean,
especially now that you're really big 

2099
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:45,910
into hunting and stuff.
It seems like it'd be more.

2100
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:47,010
I love Denver.
I fucking love it.

2101
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:51,000
Love it.
My one might be my favorite spot.

2102
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:56,510
I love it.
Every time I go there and feel like I'm 

2103
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:56,510
at home.
Last time I was there,

2104
01:38:56,510 --> 01:39:00,471
I had a fucking great time man.
And when I go up to the you could like 

2105
01:39:00,471 --> 01:39:02,610
live in the mountains near Denver to 
like evergreen.

2106
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:04,260
I was like that for.
What is this?

2107
01:39:04,261 --> 01:39:09,261
A half hour away,
just independence pass the whole the 

2108
01:39:09,261 --> 01:39:09,840
whole ride.
But um,

2109
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:13,390
every time I go back there I'm like,
yeah,

2110
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:18,590
this is probably better.
And right now Denver's bowman and it's 

2111
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:19,950
on fire.
They can't control it.

2112
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:23,640
Like all the people that didn't want 
weed to be legal,

2113
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:26,760
boy,
they got the worst possible result.

2114
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:31,970
Massive economic recovery.
Housing prices are up 19 percent.

2115
01:39:32,131 --> 01:39:35,370
Real estate's up 19 percent.
I heard rents crazy,

2116
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:37,390
crazy,
crazy ma.

2117
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:41,760
The money's booming though.
They've made more money in taxes for the

2118
01:39:41,761 --> 01:39:45,210
first time ever from marijuana than they
do from alcohol.

2119
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:50,690
No,
there's never been a place ever that's 

2120
01:39:50,690 --> 01:39:50,690
done that.
They've passed the amount of money.

2121
01:39:50,690 --> 01:39:54,711
They're making taxes from alcohol 
because they tax it at like 39 percent 

2122
01:39:54,711 --> 01:39:58,760
is smart.
They tax the shit out of it and no one 

2123
01:39:58,760 --> 01:39:58,760
gives a fuck.
Good.

2124
01:39:58,890 --> 01:40:01,650
Who Cares?
Weed is so economical.

2125
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,270
If you think about it,
like,

2126
01:40:03,271 --> 01:40:04,710
well,
how about one of those weed pens,

2127
01:40:05,010 --> 01:40:08,760
those ones that Gino cells,
how much do they sell for like 100 bucks

2128
01:40:08,761 --> 01:40:11,020
or something like that with that much,
you know,

2129
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:14,100
60 slash 40,
whatever it is.

2130
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:17,070
And you have these little cartridges,
the cartridges,

2131
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:18,510
30 bucks or something like that.

2132
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:22,290
Do they will last for weeks.
Those guys for you?

2133
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:27,320
Not really see three days.
That's how I got caught on the plane 

2134
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,010
though.
Did you set up the alarm?

2135
01:40:29,011 --> 01:40:34,011
Right.
So I told him and they came in and 

2136
01:40:34,011 --> 01:40:34,470
they're like,
why are you smoking?

2137
01:40:34,471 --> 01:40:35,880
I'm like,
do I look like I'm fucking smoking?

2138
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:38,370
And she goes,
I wonder what set this up.

2139
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:41,190
So the whole time I'm like,
they gonna throw me in fucking jail when

2140
01:40:41,191 --> 01:40:46,191
I get to the EU.
I just told I talked to you about this 

2141
01:40:46,191 --> 01:40:48,990
because he periscoped and did it and 
like he was blowing it up,

2142
01:40:51,590 --> 01:40:54,220
blowing it in periscoped

2143
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:55,240
on a plane.
Joey.

2144
01:40:55,241 --> 01:40:58,120
That's like a federal listened to me.
He didn't catch me.

2145
01:40:58,510 --> 01:41:00,600
I couldn't smoke in those.
Catch you.

2146
01:41:00,610 --> 01:41:05,610
You made your own video.
You made your own evidence against 

2147
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:06,330
yourself.
The video's gone right?

2148
01:41:07,650 --> 01:41:09,320
The ether.
They uh,

2149
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:14,800
I was in my family so I couldn't blow 
the smoke because the sides sucks it in 

2150
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:14,800
and immerse.
You'll smell it.

2151
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:16,360
Oh,
I just got up.

2152
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:19,620
Mercier was fuck because listen,
let me tell you something.

2153
01:41:20,410 --> 01:41:23,190
No one hinchcliffe dope shouldn't tell 
you what.

2154
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:26,920
Let me tell you something.
Those five hour flights without edibles,

2155
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:32,060
a brutal.
You need to get a wholesome spray to 

2156
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:35,400
everything that I know get angry.
But I got the fucking thing.

2157
01:41:36,191 --> 01:41:38,240
I was going to bring you guys and I left
on the counter.

2158
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:38,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

2159
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:42,070
But I got up and went to the.
Got To be careful about telling,

2160
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:47,280
saying what you see,
what they're making the fucking Kinda 

2161
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:47,280
keep it on a deal.

2162
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,050
I'm just all gone.
The way of Jesus on the way there.

2163
01:41:49,051 --> 01:41:54,051
I didn't need no other boots because I 
was worried about my kid on the way 

2164
01:41:54,051 --> 01:41:54,051
back.
I'm like,

2165
01:41:54,051 --> 01:41:57,601
fuck it,
six hours with this kid I need to fill 

2166
01:41:57,601 --> 01:42:01,480
out with the ipod on.
So I really couldn't hear and I'm 

2167
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:02,740
hitting this pipe and I'm like,
I just tries this up.

2168
01:42:02,741 --> 01:42:07,741
This motherfucker said good fucking 
smoke inside bad and all of a sudden I 

2169
01:42:09,701 --> 01:42:10,610
can't hear it.
I hear,

2170
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:14,260
I see them like going and I'm like,
Oh shit.

2171
01:42:14,261 --> 01:42:19,261
So I flush.
I did piss because I was hitting it 

2172
01:42:19,261 --> 01:42:21,511
while I was busy.
I pissed and I fucking put it in my 

2173
01:42:21,511 --> 01:42:21,511
pocket and I help and I have a.
What happened?

2174
01:42:21,511 --> 01:42:21,511
She goes,
well,

2175
01:42:21,511 --> 01:42:22,930
you smoking here?
And they're like,

2176
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:24,300
it doesn't smell like,
oh no,

2177
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:26,250
the fucking.
I don't know what happened.

2178
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:31,250
I banged up against the thing and then 
like my farts are so strong you're 

2179
01:42:31,250 --> 01:42:35,491
setting off smoke detectors and fucking 
sat down and like they were gonna throw 

2180
01:42:35,491 --> 01:42:35,680
me in jail.
I get my wife the car keys.

2181
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:41,250
I said just in case they arrested me,
they even said and thank you for coming 

2182
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:41,980
on.
Your daughter was great.

2183
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:44,950
So once they realize it's not smoke 
smoke,

2184
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:50,040
I think,
I don't think they're offended as much 

2185
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:51,100
as like if you have a cigarette,
like they used to let you smoke those.

2186
01:42:51,101 --> 01:42:53,440
Remember people take those blues on 
airplanes.

2187
01:42:53,441 --> 01:42:58,441
He to smoke them all the time and then 
they had to put the just gonna have to 

2188
01:42:58,441 --> 01:42:58,720
put got.
They had to figure it out.

2189
01:42:58,790 --> 01:43:01,030
They had to come up with laws for that.
For e-cigarettes.

2190
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:06,120
They're gonna have to come up with logs 
for those fucking hovercrafts because 

2191
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:06,820
hoverboards,
they're blowing up now.

2192
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:09,240
Have you seen him on up?
So not a lot on Amazon.

2193
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,400
All of them get these fucking morons off
the fucking planes.

2194
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:14,830
They let you just drive around us.
I have with those.

2195
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:19,480
They blow up.
We have a good version of them.

2196
01:43:19,481 --> 01:43:21,640
Or you see the problem is,
is straight out of China.

2197
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:23,740
Yeah.
How do you know what's the good version?

2198
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:28,800
A,
the good versions are the ones that I 

2199
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,490
actually have like a brand name and 
stuff where most of these generic ones 

2200
01:43:30,490 --> 01:43:30,490
or like just,
you know,

2201
01:43:30,490 --> 01:43:33,730
they're like just generic batteries.
Generic.

2202
01:43:33,731 --> 01:43:36,010
I just bought it from Amazon.
Should I throw them out?

2203
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:39,850
Get new ones to donate them to really 
risky kids.

2204
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,600
I'll take him.
No,

2205
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,490
no kids.
These are fun.

2206
01:43:45,491 --> 01:43:49,780
But you're taking a chance.
There's some crazy videos that I've been

2207
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:52,250
seeing lately.
Them blowing up just

2208
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:54,660
because of the generic batteries and um,
yeah,

2209
01:43:54,710 --> 01:43:56,840
I'm sure there's probably some of them 
that are better than others,

2210
01:43:56,841 --> 01:43:58,580
but if you think about how many people 
have,

2211
01:43:58,581 --> 01:44:02,210
um,
there's probably like a very,

2212
01:44:02,211 --> 01:44:04,040
very small percentage of blowing up,
right?

2213
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:04,950
Yeah.
I don't know.

2214
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:06,530
I don't know either.
But anyway,

2215
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:11,720
they're going to have to figure out how 
to regulate them at the airport because 

2216
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:11,720
people just ride around and I'm in the 
airport.

2217
01:44:12,150 --> 01:44:13,790
There's one blown up.
All he ever said,

2218
01:44:13,791 --> 01:44:18,791
we don't know what happened here.
That guy could have just let that bitch 

2219
01:44:18,791 --> 01:44:18,791
on fire.
We don't know.

2220
01:44:18,791 --> 01:44:19,460
Well,
there's ones that like in malls,

2221
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:21,890
there's.
There's like a blow up of a mall.

2222
01:44:21,891 --> 01:44:23,240
That's what I saw.
Yeah.

2223
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:29,150
Know what else I like about them.
Those motherfuckers a strap constantly.

2224
01:44:29,721 --> 01:44:34,721
You can't even.
The system knows what the buck lot of 

2225
01:44:34,721 --> 01:44:36,410
people.
A lot of white people.

2226
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:39,410
A little on the crazy side.
Now they're smoking that TAC.

2227
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:44,800
You don't want to take the chance.
They might shoot you before the grenade 

2228
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,290
goes off and your world was hurting me.
Fucked up.

2229
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:50,320
They gonna put Cowboy Dick in and take 
you up in the mountains and maple syrup 

2230
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:53,270
buying and tie it to a tree and fucking 
baked yet and then stab you to death.

2231
01:44:53,330 --> 01:44:58,330
I'll see how much you fucking love our 
after that motherfucker because listen 

2232
01:44:58,330 --> 01:44:58,880
man,
I have told you a thousand times.

2233
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:04,240
There's some real crazy gun loving 
Americans in the mountains of Colorado.

2234
01:45:05,730 --> 01:45:10,730
Oh yeah.
I'm talking and then they're not 

2235
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:10,730
malicious.
None of those malicious.

2236
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:15,520
I know good white Americans in Colorado 
that awaiting at that house right now.

2237
01:45:16,161 --> 01:45:20,090
They're building weapons to kill fucking
Talibans and shit like that.

2238
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:22,040
I know them personally.
I know one guy,

2239
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:27,220
I called him from a fucking throwaway 
phone because I know they got the taps 

2240
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:27,220
on this motherfucker.

2241
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:30,770
This guy 20 years ago showed me grenade 
launchers and his fucking garage.

2242
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:33,940
I can't imagine what he's got now.
Every time I called it,

2243
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:35,930
I send them Christmas cards from a 
different address.

2244
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:39,170
I like studio city and mail it to them.
I love him.

2245
01:45:39,510 --> 01:45:43,380
His first name is Fred.
That's all I can tell you too much.

2246
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:46,940
Or this guy taught me everything about 
he was a fucking weapon.

2247
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:49,130
You know?
I was over there when they just talk and

2248
01:45:49,131 --> 01:45:50,780
I go,
you ever seen the movie scarface?

2249
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:56,080
That's a great gun.
He had at the end and he just looked at 

2250
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,170
me when he looked at his wife because do
me a favor and you go in the other room.

2251
01:45:57,980 --> 01:45:58,670
She's like,
sure.

2252
01:45:58,970 --> 01:46:01,370
She was like a nice white lady.
Is it going to show jewelry?

2253
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:06,400
Something you just let it got out.
He pulled over his couch and what he'd 

2254
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,210
had under that couch,
the scarface gun was as little as gun.

2255
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:13,900
Do you understand me gun?
That was his fucking appetizers to kill 

2256
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:17,741
people.
This guy had so many things and he 

2257
01:46:17,741 --> 01:46:18,230
started writing themselves out that he 
was in Vietnam.

2258
01:46:18,231 --> 01:46:21,050
He started showing me the pictures and 
the ears and the cards,

2259
01:46:21,051 --> 01:46:23,810
a deck of cards they put on people and 
all that shit and I was like,

2260
01:46:24,390 --> 01:46:29,390
and he was like,
if you want to go shoot some time I'll 

2261
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:31,511
take it.
And that was the beginning of a 

2262
01:46:31,511 --> 01:46:31,511
friendship though.
He taught me so many little things.

2263
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:36,610
He knew how to fucking kill people from.
He could kill somebody in Mars right 

2264
01:46:36,610 --> 01:46:36,690
now.
He's just.

2265
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,890
He just knew he was amazing.
This shit.

2266
01:46:39,891 --> 01:46:42,060
This guy knew you want to kill somebody 
in months.

2267
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:44,990
I got the angle fucking,
you know,

2268
01:46:44,991 --> 01:46:47,060
it was just something from another 
planet man.

2269
01:46:47,061 --> 01:46:52,061
He would take me on the weekends.
I'd have to buy it for my bullets and 

2270
01:46:52,061 --> 01:46:52,061
shit

2271
01:46:52,061 --> 01:46:52,980
below the other shit we shot.
I can't tell you this shit we shot.

2272
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,010
There's a lot of gun enthusiasts out 
there,

2273
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:56,520
lot of guns,
but this guy,

2274
01:46:56,521 --> 01:47:01,521
my friend Justin,
he doesn't even know how many guns you 

2275
01:47:01,521 --> 01:47:01,521
as I go.
How many guns you have?

2276
01:47:01,521 --> 01:47:01,740
It goes,
I don't know.

2277
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:03,990
I go more than 100 years.
Oh yeah,

2278
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:08,040
more than 100.
What about when I hugged the doctor?

2279
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:09,520
Steve?
Yeah.

2280
01:47:09,521 --> 01:47:12,150
I hugged them one time.
I was like,

2281
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:13,530
what the fuck?
He's like,

2282
01:47:13,531 --> 01:47:15,120
Oh yeah,
I don't know it without this phone.

2283
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:17,670
He's in the military.
He was a air force flight surgeon.

2284
01:47:18,090 --> 01:47:19,760
He doesn't give a fuck.
Steve's uh,

2285
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:24,750
that guy is crazy as fuck.
He's been my friend for 27 years.

2286
01:47:24,751 --> 01:47:26,110
Twenty eight years.
More.

2287
01:47:26,230 --> 01:47:28,710
Actually more than that.
Shit.

2288
01:47:28,711 --> 01:47:30,420
How many years?
Oh my God,

2289
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:33,150
Dude.
Thirty years.

2290
01:47:33,151 --> 01:47:35,040
He's been my friend for 30 something 
years.

2291
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:36,870
Thirty three years.

2292
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:37,890
Wow.
That's crazy.

2293
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:38,850
Yeah.
That guy,

2294
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,380
he's,
he's in his sixties.

2295
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:43,050
He gets his body fixed just so we can go
back to spawn again.

2296
01:47:43,950 --> 01:47:45,900
Isn't a 60,
blows his rotator cuff up,

2297
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:48,540
going to have to get that fixed,
gets it all fucking stitched up and blew

2298
01:47:48,541 --> 01:47:49,890
my knee out again.
GotTa get that fixed.

2299
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:50,740
He gets,
he's,

2300
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:54,480
he's had more than 20 knee surgeries.
He's uh,

2301
01:47:54,630 --> 01:47:58,110
he's crazy guys.
Didn't give a fuck with young kids.

2302
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:02,940
He'll come after you do like a wild dog.
He always been that way.

2303
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:07,970
He's always been that way.
He was an ophthalmologist when I met 

2304
01:48:07,970 --> 01:48:07,970
him.
He was doing his residency in Boston.

2305
01:48:07,970 --> 01:48:12,950
This guy,
I've never met anybody that worked 

2306
01:48:12,950 --> 01:48:14,781
harder.
There's a few people in my life that 

2307
01:48:14,781 --> 01:48:14,910
when I was young that let me know what 
hard work really was.

2308
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,910
I thought I worked hard and then I'd 
watch these guys and I just got fuck.

2309
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:20,940
One of 'em was Steve.
Steve was a,

2310
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:23,280
he was an ophthalmologist.
He was doing his residency.

2311
01:48:24,930 --> 01:48:29,930
He was sitting on the toilet eating food
out of a tray and he fell asleep as 

2312
01:48:29,930 --> 01:48:31,830
buzzer went off.
So he's shitting,

2313
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:36,980
eating and sleeping at the same time and
as buzzer goes off to tell them to go 

2314
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:39,330
back to work because he had,
when you're in your residency,

2315
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:41,730
you do these insane,
insane hours,

2316
01:48:41,731 --> 01:48:44,920
like they're just mindblowing and then 
you're studying and you just,

2317
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:48,120
it's chaos.
The amount of sleep that they get versus

2318
01:48:48,121 --> 01:48:52,800
the amount of work that they have to do.
It's amazing how nobody just that people

2319
01:48:52,801 --> 01:48:55,920
don't constantly accidentally kill 
people because they're all so tired.

2320
01:48:56,090 --> 01:48:58,890
Like it's the weirdest thing about 
doctors and I don't know how they still,

2321
01:48:58,891 --> 01:49:01,350
if they still do it this way,
but the way they used to do it,

2322
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:02,100
they.

2323
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:05,820
They would make them work these fucking 
ungodly hours and you would.

2324
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:10,830
You would always be exhausted and so you
would think you'd want to be wide awake 

2325
01:49:10,830 --> 01:49:11,670
and thinking clearly to make medical 
decisions,

2326
01:49:11,671 --> 01:49:13,560
especially about people's vision,
right?

2327
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:15,420
Nope.
Have these fucking guys.

2328
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:20,600
They make them work insane,
insane hours and the other one was my 

2329
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:20,970
friend jumped ship,
junk Chang.

2330
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:26,180
He was a US national taekwondo champion 
and he came from my same gym and he was 

2331
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:28,890
the guy who won the championships while 
he was in medical school.

2332
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:31,050
This fucking guy.
You want to talk about?

2333
01:49:31,051 --> 01:49:34,530
A guy who worked hard.
I never met anybody who worked harder,

2334
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:37,050
complained less,
got so little sleep.

2335
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:42,080
If he slept like four hours a night.
It was planning and he's training for 

2336
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,580
the national taekwondo team.
This fucking guy used to do studying and

2337
01:49:44,581 --> 01:49:49,581
in between studying,
he would sprint up the stairs and his 

2338
01:49:49,581 --> 01:49:51,270
university and come back down and then 
sprint and they would do that like image

2339
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:54,940
who we'd like read or do his work for a 
couple of hours and then he would sprint

2340
01:49:54,941 --> 01:49:57,220
upstairs,
put his backpack through all his books,

2341
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:02,240
his back,
put his backpack on sprint up the 

2342
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:02,240
stairs.

2343
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:05,260
It just,
just did every waking moment dedicated 

2344
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:07,000
to all the shit that he had to get done 
because he came from a Korean background

2345
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:11,340
and Korean parents are super.
Some of them super strict about their,

2346
01:50:11,341 --> 01:50:16,341
their children succeeding.
His father just put all this incredible 

2347
01:50:16,341 --> 01:50:16,430
pressure on them.
So when I would think like people say,

2348
01:50:16,431 --> 01:50:17,250
wow,
you work so hard.

2349
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:20,830
I barely,
I sleep eight hours a night.

2350
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:25,300
Like these guys,
Steve and junk to guys incidentally that

2351
01:50:25,301 --> 01:50:26,750
were in the medical,
uh,

2352
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:28,240
medical,
um,

2353
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:31,990
education and they both.
I never saw anybody work harder.

2354
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:33,550
I've never seen anything in my life like
that.

2355
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:36,160
There would be exhausted.
Like jumped ship would come in.

2356
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:38,740
Who come in and training and his mouth 
would be open like this.

2357
01:50:39,890 --> 01:50:40,600
He was.
He goes,

2358
01:50:40,601 --> 01:50:45,601
I'm so fucking tired.
I'm so fucking tired within training 

2359
01:50:45,601 --> 01:50:45,601
with star at this fucking guy.

2360
01:50:46,190 --> 01:50:49,180
He would fire up and get crazy.
He's a bad motherfucker.

2361
01:50:49,390 --> 01:50:54,390
He would fire up and just start kicking 
the shit out of people and he wasn't 

2362
01:50:54,390 --> 01:50:56,750
even like a talented guy.
He wasn't like physically talented.

2363
01:50:56,751 --> 01:51:01,751
He wasn't like some Lebron James,
some unusual freak specimen of 

2364
01:51:01,751 --> 01:51:03,850
athleticism.
Just working five foot five,

2365
01:51:03,851 --> 01:51:08,260
five foot six Korean kid who just didn't
take no for an answer,

2366
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:13,320
just didn't fucking take no for an 
answer and figured out how to win the 

2367
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:14,050
national title while he was in fucking 
medical school.

2368
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:16,330
So whenever I was around people that 
were,

2369
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:17,800
you know,
they would say,

2370
01:51:17,801 --> 01:51:18,760
yeah,
I work hard.

2371
01:51:18,761 --> 01:51:19,900
I work too fucking hard.
I'm like,

2372
01:51:20,350 --> 01:51:25,350
Damn,
I'm not saying that you should work the 

2373
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:25,350
way those guys did because I don't think
you should.

2374
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:26,500
I think that's too much.
I think there's a point of like,

2375
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:29,620
you can overtrain and fighters 
overtraining and workout too hard.

2376
01:51:29,621 --> 01:51:31,300
They come into the fight and they're 
exhausted.

2377
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,860
They just never recovered from the 
training,

2378
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:35,260
but they,
it's,

2379
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:38,230
there's something admirable about the 
ability to do what they did.

2380
01:51:38,231 --> 01:51:43,231
Like I don't think you should do it.
I don't think you should work that hard 

2381
01:51:43,231 --> 01:51:43,231
because I think you could kill yourself.

2382
01:51:43,231 --> 01:51:43,980
I think everybody should get a taste of 
it too.

2383
01:51:43,981 --> 01:51:46,410
Just know that Bro.
We're fucking soft.

2384
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:49,560
We'll fucking soft.
We'll fucking soft what we do,

2385
01:51:49,561 --> 01:51:51,690
what we have to do.
We were talking about this before,

2386
01:51:51,691 --> 01:51:56,691
like when I went home with mercy and I 
took it to a park when that Taulia and 

2387
01:51:56,691 --> 01:51:58,020
fucking it was cold out.
My wife's like put the jacket on it.

2388
01:51:58,140 --> 01:52:03,140
Fuck no,
like the fucking jacket off and no 

2389
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:05,721
gloves either.
Let her climb and shit when I was 

2390
01:52:05,721 --> 01:52:05,721
saying,
but my hands are freezing.

2391
01:52:05,721 --> 01:52:06,360
Look at what she's living out there with
soft.

2392
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:07,980
You know,
we're just talking about that.

2393
01:52:07,981 --> 01:52:12,981
When you go on that ferry,
what do you think when that ferry stops 

2394
01:52:12,981 --> 01:52:13,920
in February when it's 10 below in 
Manhattan now.

2395
01:52:14,070 --> 01:52:19,070
And you know,
once that sun goes down it's fucking 

2396
01:52:19,070 --> 01:52:19,320
brutal on that goddamn ferry and you 
just make it work,

2397
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:19,650
you know?

2398
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,570
But we forget sometimes.
Listen,

2399
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:23,070
man,
how do you fucking work?

2400
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:25,050
Do you work?
When I first met you?

2401
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:29,010
You just work smarter now.
You still put in the hours.

2402
01:52:29,011 --> 01:52:33,660
You just worked fucking smarter now.
When I met you used to do news radio and

2403
01:52:33,661 --> 01:52:35,790
then go to the fucking store and hang 
with to a midnight,

2404
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:38,100
which ain't no fucking joke.
My friend,

2405
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:43,330
a couple Friday nights you would shoot 
from 12 or 11 and you wouldn't get out 

2406
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:46,250
of news radio 10 and I don't know what 
were making our news radio,

2407
01:52:46,251 --> 01:52:51,251
but the character was you still came 
down and did your $15 spot and you 

2408
01:52:51,251 --> 01:52:52,810
follow whoever and you were fucking 
happy and,

2409
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:57,960
and that's work ethic.
And you know how many times you talked 

2410
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:00,331
to a comedian,
they tell you things aren't going their 

2411
01:53:00,331 --> 01:53:00,331
way and you say,
okay,

2412
01:53:00,331 --> 01:53:00,380
what have you been doing lately?

2413
01:53:00,950 --> 01:53:03,410
And they tell you and you're like,
are you fucking kidding me?

2414
01:53:04,070 --> 01:53:05,380
Are you fucking kidding me?
You know,

2415
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:08,830
hard work goes into being a top notch 
fucking comic.

2416
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:11,960
What we just talked about,
Dave Chappelle being at the store.

2417
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:17,080
How old is Ron White?
Did he follow media like the fucking 

2418
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:17,480
store?
There's a guy that's a millionaire.

2419
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:19,790
You still fucking out there.
Every fucking nightmare.

2420
01:53:19,850 --> 01:53:24,850
It's why he's still good.
I look at these fucking kids and they 

2421
01:53:24,850 --> 01:53:24,850
tell me,
Oh,

2422
01:53:24,850 --> 01:53:24,850
I'm tired.
Fucking tired.

2423
01:53:24,850 --> 01:53:28,370
Are you talking about man?
What fucking tyler you talking about the

2424
01:53:28,371 --> 01:53:31,700
first time I slept and I got no reason 
why he was when I got locked up at 27.

2425
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:37,300
Before that I was asleep.
Sleep three hours here on a couch in 

2426
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:40,120
between coke rocks and you know,
whatever,

2427
01:53:40,370 --> 01:53:43,100
sleep apnea machine,
there was no sleep apnea machine.

2428
01:53:43,101 --> 01:53:44,090
You just roughed it out.

2429
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:49,090
Then you know,
but now people are wanting to do this 

2430
01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:49,090
shit my life.
You got to put in the fucking hours.

2431
01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:53,650
You know,
I read the rolling stone article and 

2432
01:53:53,650 --> 01:53:54,890
then showed you put in the hours Joe 
Rogan and showed a lot.

2433
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:56,300
You know,
I read that article and I'm like,

2434
01:53:56,301 --> 01:53:59,240
there's a beautiful article,
but there was many ways.

2435
01:53:59,241 --> 01:54:04,241
It didn't show the reasons why I loved 
you and that's because of your work 

2436
01:54:04,241 --> 01:54:04,241
ethic.
What?

2437
01:54:04,241 --> 01:54:05,030
I thought that when you moved to this 
town,

2438
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:07,130
because when I,
before I got here,

2439
01:54:07,131 --> 01:54:08,990
when you moved to this town,
you've got a TV show,

2440
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:12,200
you stopped going to the store.
That's the impression I got.

2441
01:54:12,350 --> 01:54:15,500
He started working harder.
He started working on it,

2442
01:54:15,501 --> 01:54:17,690
man,
and that's why I got it from.

2443
01:54:17,691 --> 01:54:19,100
I finally realized,
you know what?

2444
01:54:19,310 --> 01:54:22,100
When you call down to the store,
you got to call him coast to coast.

2445
01:54:22,610 --> 01:54:25,940
You got to call him Sunday to Sunday and
you got to see what end.

2446
01:54:25,970 --> 01:54:28,670
If it's five nights a week,
I make times we leave the store at three

2447
01:54:28,671 --> 01:54:29,450
in the morning.
Man,

2448
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:31,600
a lot.
You know it's

2449
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:36,600
too.
You got to be willing to do those 

2450
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:38,221
nonpaid regular spots.
A lot of guys don't want to do is 

2451
01:54:38,221 --> 01:54:41,221
nonpaid regular spots.
You got to show up and wait and that's 

2452
01:54:41,221 --> 01:54:44,341
how I got passed.
It's one of the main reasons why Mitzi 

2453
01:54:44,341 --> 01:54:44,341
pass me two main reasons.
One,

2454
01:54:44,341 --> 01:54:44,390
the todd,
that dude,

2455
01:54:44,391 --> 01:54:49,391
the todd to todd,
he was on mtv who was one of Polish 

2456
01:54:49,391 --> 01:54:49,990
friends.
Fucking great guy.

2457
01:54:50,110 --> 01:54:53,610
That guy was the best.
He was so nice and he.

2458
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:55,120
He said,
I'm going to help you.

2459
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:56,230
He goes,
you're really funny.

2460
01:54:56,530 --> 01:55:01,530
He goes,
I'm going to sit next to Mitzi and I'm 

2461
01:55:01,530 --> 01:55:01,530
going to laugh while you're onstage.
She told me,

2462
01:55:01,530 --> 01:55:02,980
and he goes,
and then one day he goes,

2463
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:05,230
you're going to have a friend that you 
want to get past.

2464
01:55:05,231 --> 01:55:06,100
You'll do the same thing.

2465
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:09,310
Then that dude,
he,

2466
01:55:09,311 --> 01:55:14,311
um,
he held up like a serious problem and 

2467
01:55:14,311 --> 01:55:15,400
had a serious mental problem,
had something wrong like physically with

2468
01:55:15,401 --> 01:55:17,470
his brain.
I don't remember what it was,

2469
01:55:17,471 --> 01:55:21,050
but it was so depressing to me because,
you know,

2470
01:55:21,070 --> 01:55:23,920
he showed me like,
like great comradery,

2471
01:55:23,921 --> 01:55:24,760
like,
like,

2472
01:55:24,850 --> 01:55:25,780
like,
you know,

2473
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:30,790
the,
there's this comradery that you have 

2474
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:30,790
between fellow comics,
you know,

2475
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:31,540
when you meet someone and they're coming
up,

2476
01:55:31,710 --> 01:55:33,130
like,
a lot of times you get on killed.

2477
01:55:33,131 --> 01:55:35,290
Tony,
get these young guys or young girls that

2478
01:55:35,291 --> 01:55:36,220
are coming up and you go,
hey,

2479
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:38,320
you want to look at them like you're 
really funny.

2480
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:39,880
Like,
keep this up.

2481
01:55:40,450 --> 01:55:42,160
You can do this.
You're really funny.

2482
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:45,330
And when you run into people that,
uh,

2483
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:47,220
that connect,
you like that,

2484
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:52,250
that hook you up like that.
Like he sat down next to Mitzi and it's 

2485
01:55:52,250 --> 01:55:55,881
like,
Holy Shit just laughed it up.

2486
01:55:56,010 --> 01:56:01,010
Hammed it up.
The audience was laughing to submit to 

2487
01:56:01,010 --> 01:56:04,041
you is like your past Camille year past 
your now pay regular.

2488
01:56:04,741 --> 01:56:07,440
You can call in on Monday and that was 
to me,

2489
01:56:07,441 --> 01:56:11,220
that was way bigger a deal than even 
getting a TV show.

2490
01:56:11,221 --> 01:56:14,460
I was already on a TV show.
The TV show wasn't shit.

2491
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:17,050
I was like,
I'm at the store.

2492
01:56:17,490 --> 01:56:20,200
I made it.
I'm a man.

2493
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:23,330
I mean at Mecca.
That was a.

2494
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:26,100
When we were open Mike,
that was the spot.

2495
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:28,200
There was only one spot.
It was Mecca.

2496
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:30,510
There was the catch,
a rising star in New York,

2497
01:56:30,511 --> 01:56:33,030
there was,
there was the comic strip in New York,

2498
01:56:33,031 --> 01:56:34,950
there was a,
there was all these clubs,

2499
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:40,300
you know,
we all knew about the last stop in 

2500
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:40,980
Houston were Kennison came from.
We all knew about all these good spots.

2501
01:56:40,981 --> 01:56:45,981
You're supposed to go to xannies.
And Nashville was always a spot that 

2502
01:56:45,981 --> 01:56:46,680
people would talk about,
but there was one Mecca.

2503
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:52,750
You know,
it's funny because I talked about this 

2504
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:54,220
last week and this is something that 
again wasn't an interview.

2505
01:56:54,221 --> 01:56:56,160
You did,
you know,

2506
01:56:56,260 --> 01:57:01,260
I was alright.
So I got funny in 2000 and then I got a 

2507
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:04,620
few more years before that and then I 
got stuck and then you got stuck and 

2508
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:08,131
then I had a talk with somebody.
I had a talk with the black dude who 

2509
01:57:08,131 --> 01:57:11,971
used to teach me one hop window.
As silly as this watch,

2510
01:57:13,001 --> 01:57:14,920
you don't want to knock on doors and 
offshoot of Campo.

2511
01:57:14,921 --> 01:57:16,440
It's Hawaiian and this was the,
the,

2512
01:57:16,510 --> 01:57:17,530
the,
the caskets.

2513
01:57:17,950 --> 01:57:19,540
What's his name?
The Costco's.

2514
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:24,300
This is his father's first student.
Two black guys didn't put this in here,

2515
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:26,350
here and here.
And he was saying that,

2516
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:29,890
you know,
he does this thing and he goes,

2517
01:57:29,891 --> 01:57:34,891
I really,
I really started getting into martial 

2518
01:57:34,891 --> 01:57:34,891
arts when I started teaching.

2519
01:57:34,891 --> 01:57:37,600
Yeah,
it was a complete different story and he

2520
01:57:37,601 --> 01:57:42,601
goes to trigger considered teaching 
stands up and I was like fuck will 

2521
01:57:42,601 --> 01:57:42,601
listen to me.
And I went home.

2522
01:57:42,670 --> 01:57:46,570
I thought about what he was saying to me
when we got to the store,

2523
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:47,860
when I got to the store,
you know,

2524
01:57:47,861 --> 01:57:52,861
the first week I became a regular,
like the third night I got into a 

2525
01:57:52,861 --> 01:57:55,501
fucking beef and I can name four times I
got into beef with those older jealousy 

2526
01:57:55,991 --> 01:57:56,930
type comics.
Oh,

2527
01:57:57,040 --> 01:58:00,370
there was a bunch of saying I'm the one 
time in the main room.

2528
01:58:00,730 --> 01:58:01,960
One time.
Oh Shit.

2529
01:58:01,961 --> 01:58:04,450
With the glass and the fucking original 
room.

2530
01:58:04,451 --> 01:58:06,760
And there was no booze.
That guy broke the bottle.

2531
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:10,060
Okay.
And I remember thinking that.

2532
01:58:10,061 --> 01:58:15,061
I remember then you had Charlie Hill who
would fucking pull you aside and go 

2533
01:58:15,061 --> 01:58:16,530
swimming a man.
Uh,

2534
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:19,270
I had belly laughs when you want to 
stage,

2535
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:21,730
hang in with it.
I know you're having a hard time here.

2536
01:58:21,970 --> 01:58:25,390
I know it's 1:35
in the morning and you're going up,

2537
01:58:25,391 --> 01:58:30,391
but it's gonna pay off for you.
Alan Stevens put me in fucking arliss 

2538
01:58:30,391 --> 01:58:31,150
opposite James Coburn,
my idol.

2539
01:58:31,390 --> 01:58:32,800
We were just talking one day and he 
goes,

2540
01:58:32,801 --> 01:58:35,460
you really liked James Coburn.
He scheduled to do all this.

2541
01:58:35,470 --> 01:58:37,690
I'm going to get you on dog.
You know,

2542
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:39,580
wow,
you know what that does to your insides,

2543
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:41,980
but you had scumbags,
and

2544
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,900
I remember again,
I thought to myself,

2545
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:46,420
I'm never going to ever do something 
with this,

2546
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:49,930
but if I ever do,
I'm going to be nice to these kids.

2547
01:58:51,010 --> 01:58:53,440
When I go to the store.
Now it's hugs with the young kids.

2548
01:58:53,441 --> 01:58:55,690
It's only encouragement I get in and out
of that.

2549
01:58:55,691 --> 01:58:59,110
I don't want to be that old pervert or 
that old guy has given advice.

2550
01:58:59,130 --> 01:58:59,330
No,
no,

2551
01:58:59,331 --> 01:58:59,650
no,
no.

2552
01:58:59,890 --> 01:59:02,170
I look in the.
I put my hand up and I say,

2553
01:59:02,171 --> 01:59:03,040
hey man,
no,

2554
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:05,110
seriously.
Court the other day and the fucking.

2555
01:59:05,111 --> 01:59:06,580
I got a video,
a short video.

2556
01:59:06,581 --> 01:59:09,520
I put it up on Youtube where you're 
talking about guns and roses.

2557
01:59:09,710 --> 01:59:11,170
Well,
I put it up on instagram.

2558
01:59:11,230 --> 01:59:13,030
There's a short video,
but when you were in the back,

2559
01:59:13,060 --> 01:59:15,400
but the back door holding court the 
other night.

2560
01:59:16,230 --> 01:59:19,210
What's this camaraderie there?
Wasn't there when we came,

2561
01:59:19,211 --> 01:59:19,900
we came up.

2562
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:21,820
So I made it.
And you don't want me to tear some.

2563
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:24,790
It's made me a hundred percent better 
comment.

2564
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:28,090
Oh yeah.
Andre Being Tony,

2565
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:29,830
uh,
those young guys,

2566
01:59:29,831 --> 01:59:31,900
you know,
you know how hard it is to be a door guy

2567
01:59:31,910 --> 01:59:35,290
and sit there and say hello to people in
your heart.

2568
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:37,570
You want to do the same thing.
Guys,

2569
01:59:37,571 --> 01:59:39,400
I don't know how many times I went home 
at night,

2570
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:42,130
five years in content.
I cried myself to sleep.

2571
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:44,670
I'd circle just relapsed,
lapsed member,

2572
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:49,760
just last shore newspaper.
Backpage was all the clubs and I would 

2573
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:53,850
sit there and circle the clubs that I 
was someday perform it to Seattle on the

2574
01:59:53,851 --> 01:59:57,510
ground.
Punchline of that land stopped.

2575
01:59:57,810 --> 01:59:59,020
Uh,
what was the other one?

2576
01:59:59,021 --> 02:00:00,820
What was the one where Ralphie felt 
through the stage?

2577
02:00:02,910 --> 02:00:05,140
Yeah,
that's a true story that the stage was.

2578
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:08,800
That club was legendary and Houston way 
before the laptop.

2579
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:14,220
The other,
whether Houston is another one that was 

2580
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:16,030
a fucking great name.
They were just clubs that had names,

2581
02:00:16,031 --> 02:00:18,730
like the insignia for Seattle was a 
building,

2582
02:00:18,731 --> 02:00:21,010
the Seattle thing,
and it was timed and I'm like,

2583
02:00:21,011 --> 02:00:24,730
one day I'm gonna fucking play there.
And then after three minutes between the

2584
02:00:24,731 --> 02:00:28,450
cocaine and who the fuck I was deep down
inside,

2585
02:00:28,451 --> 02:00:30,520
I would just break down into tears and 
go,

2586
02:00:30,521 --> 02:00:32,740
I'm never going to be good enough to 
play those clubs.

2587
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,190
Why would I say that to myself?
This is just a fucking pipe dream.

2588
02:00:36,191 --> 02:00:37,270
You know,
I'm not doing this shit.

2589
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:38,950
So now to,
to,

2590
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:41,740
to be up there with these guys.
The other night,

2591
02:00:41,741 --> 02:00:42,940
Joe Rogan,
I almost went on,

2592
02:00:43,450 --> 02:00:47,980
you know that Joey d as the old joke is 
when Adam came over and said,

2593
02:00:47,981 --> 02:00:50,080
hey man,
you might've Chappelle goes up.

2594
02:00:50,530 --> 02:00:52,300
I said,
fuck no before you.

2595
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:53,110
I said,
fuck no.

2596
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:56,200
The old Joey deals.
We got fucking assaulted me.

2597
02:00:56,390 --> 02:01:01,390
Put Dave Chappelle.
Or like if I was somebody and I get my 

2598
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:01,390
car and leave years ago,
I was just like,

2599
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:02,740
fuck you.
I was like,

2600
02:01:02,741 --> 02:01:04,300
no man.
Joe Rogan wouldn't leave.

2601
02:01:04,630 --> 02:01:07,240
He fucking sent it out and get up there 
and chill.

2602
02:01:07,241 --> 02:01:12,241
I had such a fucking good time yelling 
at Washington Chappelle like I learned 

2603
02:01:12,241 --> 02:01:12,241
something,
man.

2604
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:15,250
This thing was going through isn't about
podcast.

2605
02:01:15,410 --> 02:01:18,040
It isn't about nothing right now.
It's about,

2606
02:01:18,190 --> 02:01:19,780
you know,
I did the belly room last night.

2607
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:21,100
Oh,
last one and say,

2608
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:23,590
oh my God,
11 slash 15.

2609
02:01:23,620 --> 02:01:25,390
The dollar shop.
Yeah,

2610
02:01:25,410 --> 02:01:26,700
the Dallas show.
So that,

2611
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:26,980
that,
that,

2612
02:01:27,020 --> 02:01:28,570
that night I told you I couldn't do 
yours,

2613
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:33,720
but I can do the late one.
I left there feeling like I won the 

2614
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:35,170
academy award because they help these 
young kids.

2615
02:01:35,170 --> 02:01:37,600
Like I made these young kids,
they hugged me,

2616
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:39,610
they offered me weed,
you know,

2617
02:01:39,730 --> 02:01:43,890
you know,
that way it just sucks dick either.

2618
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:46,910
I don't know.
It made me feel,

2619
02:01:47,030 --> 02:01:47,630
you know,
I didn't get.

2620
02:01:47,690 --> 02:01:49,790
I didn't take no money.
I didn't have $15.

2621
02:01:49,791 --> 02:01:54,791
It wasn't about that.
It was about doing something with these 

2622
02:01:54,791 --> 02:01:57,821
young guys,
these young guys looking at you 

2623
02:01:57,821 --> 02:01:57,821
differently and letting them know that,
hey man,

2624
02:01:57,821 --> 02:02:00,800
I ain't no better than you and someday 
you're going to be way better than me.

2625
02:02:00,801 --> 02:02:02,960
I just watched this.
That you're a writer,

2626
02:02:02,961 --> 02:02:04,460
man.
You're a bad motherfucker.

2627
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:09,700
That has made me a way better comic than
doing open mics and throw him because 

2628
02:02:10,881 --> 02:02:13,500
now I see it from a different angle.
I love comedy.

2629
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:18,640
I love watching it,
but I like watching the young guys at 

2630
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:21,521
the store at some fucking goofy fuck.
The whole attitude at that place feels 

2631
02:02:22,791 --> 02:02:23,240
different.

2632
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:25,130
Fuck yeah.
Way Better.

2633
02:02:25,131 --> 02:02:27,080
Right?
I think that's the Internet.

2634
02:02:27,230 --> 02:02:32,230
I think that's a big,
like the crop of guys that were coming 

2635
02:02:32,230 --> 02:02:35,381
in the new crop over the last 10 years.
They're coming in for the right reasons.

2636
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:38,450
I love you with all my heart,
but you're making it sound too good.

2637
02:02:38,630 --> 02:02:41,360
They got rid of the shit heads up there.
Okay.

2638
02:02:42,130 --> 02:02:44,190
Let's eliminate the internet.
Your sweetness.

2639
02:02:44,260 --> 02:02:46,010
That too.
And that's why I love you to death,

2640
02:02:46,190 --> 02:02:48,980
but let's be honest.
They got rid of the pure shit up there.

2641
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:52,790
Your shit take came into that store and 
then no longer there.

2642
02:02:52,990 --> 02:02:57,990
That's such shit.
They wouldn't even show that faces no 

2643
02:02:57,990 --> 02:03:00,251
more because we called them out on it.
They turned something beautiful into 

2644
02:03:00,251 --> 02:03:02,420
shit.
That was our fucking home.

2645
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:04,940
That was our camaraderie.
That was my base.

2646
02:03:05,090 --> 02:03:06,680
That was everything to me,
man.

2647
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:11,800
That was everything to me and one day 
some fucking guy came in and some 

2648
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:14,330
fucking dumb comic started putting shit 
in his fucking had and that motherfucker

2649
02:03:14,331 --> 02:03:15,640
don't go to the academy store no more.

2650
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:18,380
They don't have to get out of the way.
Capullo suck my Dick.

2651
02:03:18,650 --> 02:03:21,090
That's what you get for being a control 
your fucking life.

2652
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:24,230
That's what you get.
You and Tommy can both suck my dick.

2653
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:29,330
Merry Christmas and don't let me see you
at the more capital you fucking faggot.

2654
02:03:30,410 --> 02:03:33,520
Fuck a little punk ass bitch us under 
the.

2655
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:37,250
He threw all of us under the bus bro.
I found out about a ton of shit.

2656
02:03:37,370 --> 02:03:42,370
Fuck that motherfucker.
That's why I woke up one day and put it 

2657
02:03:42,370 --> 02:03:45,551
on twitter.
You're a punt and that same matter how 

2658
02:03:45,551 --> 02:03:45,551
to put them up in the main room and he 
froze when he saw me.

2659
02:03:45,551 --> 02:03:50,410
Then he had to follow you and he was 
calling the fucking club that tell him 

2660
02:03:50,410 --> 02:03:52,430
not to put you up to wait until he got 
there.

2661
02:03:53,210 --> 02:03:55,400
So when I found that out,
that was it.

2662
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:57,770
Every time I see him at the store,
I just glare at them.

2663
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:59,420
I'm going to get fucking.
What's his name,

2664
02:03:59,660 --> 02:04:01,970
the kid with the diabetes and how do you
know that?

2665
02:04:01,971 --> 02:04:06,971
For sure,
because I find that little fucking 

2666
02:04:06,971 --> 02:04:06,971
things.
I know everything.

2667
02:04:06,971 --> 02:04:06,971
Cops soccer.
That's my job.

2668
02:04:07,130 --> 02:04:09,260
That's my job.
You don't see him down in Omar.

2669
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:11,190
What's that expression?
You won't be sleeping.

2670
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:12,920
Grow more.
When they go to Michael Corleone,

2671
02:04:13,190 --> 02:04:18,190
when he's making the thing.
What happened with Paulie and the fat 

2672
02:04:18,190 --> 02:04:18,190
guy looks at me.
He goes,

2673
02:04:18,190 --> 02:04:20,550
you won't be seeing him normal,
and so he looks at me.

2674
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:21,140
He goes,
okay.

2675
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:24,880
He dips the bread and the sauce.
It was timing.

2676
02:04:24,881 --> 02:04:27,010
It was not.
He did a podcast with scheduled.

2677
02:04:27,060 --> 02:04:32,060
Did you listen to that psycho?
Fucking more or less the following cycle

2678
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:38,750
deployments.
These fucking psychos have taken over 

2679
02:04:38,750 --> 02:04:41,561
clubs and they clubs a bad name and then
you know you don't want to play that 

2680
02:04:41,561 --> 02:04:41,561
club no more.

2681
02:04:41,561 --> 02:04:44,700
The comedy store is the Best Club in the
fucking universe.

2682
02:04:44,910 --> 02:04:49,910
There's Martians up there and Mars 
planning a fucking visit just to go to 

2683
02:04:49,910 --> 02:04:51,240
the comedy store because there's 
something about it.

2684
02:04:51,390 --> 02:04:56,390
Even with those old guys,
when we were gone and there was 

2685
02:04:56,390 --> 02:04:56,390
something about it,
we had each other bro.

2686
02:04:56,390 --> 02:04:57,420
We had each other.
We had a little thing.

2687
02:04:57,430 --> 02:05:02,430
Advice used to sit on the stairs and 
cracked jokes and Barris and all those 

2688
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:02,940
guys.
Don Barris,

2689
02:05:02,970 --> 02:05:07,970
who does he fucking insult?
Nobody terraces the salt of the comedy 

2690
02:05:07,970 --> 02:05:11,931
store after midnight.
There's just certain people that made 

2691
02:05:11,931 --> 02:05:14,100
the comedy store that tells you what 
Jamie was saying,

2692
02:05:14,101 --> 02:05:15,940
him and sold him.
Oh No,

2693
02:05:15,941 --> 02:05:20,941
no.
This is what really happened at the 

2694
02:05:20,941 --> 02:05:20,941
store.
You put a bunch of shit.

2695
02:05:20,941 --> 02:05:24,101
Had fucking comics at a great place and 
they poisoned for years and look at the 

2696
02:05:24,101 --> 02:05:25,680
energy of the store.
Now the proof is in the pudding.

2697
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:27,450
I'm not talking nothing on the line 
here.

2698
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:30,420
I'm not saying nothing out of line here.
Tommy's gone.

2699
02:05:30,510 --> 02:05:31,920
Cap has gone.
That's it.

2700
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:37,040
The store is fucking beautiful.
You had a couple of guys that would sit 

2701
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:39,210
there and night throwing fucking 
witchcraft on other good comics.

2702
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:40,680
Fuck you.
I hope you bob.

2703
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:43,350
I hope he doesn't make it so I can get a
stupid fallout set.

2704
02:05:43,620 --> 02:05:48,620
Zero fucking guy.
That old woman that was sitting there 

2705
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:49,410
and you get in a spot tonight,
man,

2706
02:05:49,970 --> 02:05:52,650
I wish Joe Rogan was my friend making 
little remarks.

2707
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:55,020
They're all gone.
It's over.

2708
02:05:55,290 --> 02:05:57,970
It's a positive comedy.
Fucking a.

2709
02:05:57,980 --> 02:06:02,980
even now I only go down three times a 
week out of respect because I don't want

2710
02:06:03,541 --> 02:06:07,430
to be that old perfect guy sitting 
around with the waitresses.

2711
02:06:07,530 --> 02:06:09,690
Twelve and a young comics.
I'm a comic.

2712
02:06:09,691 --> 02:06:11,940
I go get my work out.
I get my car and I leave.

2713
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:14,220
I love to be able to hang out there for 
two hours,

2714
02:06:14,221 --> 02:06:17,490
but I can't,
but it's the other night he was there.

2715
02:06:17,730 --> 02:06:20,660
We were giggling in the hallways.
Look at what happened here.

2716
02:06:20,710 --> 02:06:24,390
What did we start this comment?
That podcast with Chappelle goofing on.

2717
02:06:24,391 --> 02:06:27,990
Steve Run is easy and army and they all 
had a great fucking time.

2718
02:06:28,030 --> 02:06:31,010
I guess everybody did nine slash 11 
jokes to Steve runs easy.

2719
02:06:31,011 --> 02:06:32,900
Yeah,
it was brutal.

2720
02:06:32,910 --> 02:06:35,320
I wish I was there for that.
That is so fun.

2721
02:06:35,321 --> 02:06:36,990
It's good that he's taken it on the chin
like that.

2722
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:40,350
He's a great guy and it happens and you 
make mistakes and that's it.

2723
02:06:40,351 --> 02:06:42,630
But the point is,
we're fucking back.

2724
02:06:43,230 --> 02:06:44,730
We're back.
We're just.

2725
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:48,330
We're better.
It's been better than ever that no shit.

2726
02:06:48,331 --> 02:06:53,331
Heads go up there.
I think shitheads go to go in and 

2727
02:06:53,331 --> 02:06:56,271
there's a force now that's an anti 
shithead fucking forest and it keeps 

2728
02:06:56,271 --> 02:06:56,271
them out.

2729
02:06:56,271 --> 02:06:56,610
And that's the truth,
man.

2730
02:06:56,910 --> 02:07:00,900
That's the fucking truth.
Everybody's super cool up there.

2731
02:07:01,170 --> 02:07:06,170
Beyond that,
I was starting to get a mini anxiety 

2732
02:07:06,170 --> 02:07:06,170
attack.
No edibles,

2733
02:07:06,170 --> 02:07:10,101
no nothing.
I was trying to get a mini anxiety 

2734
02:07:10,101 --> 02:07:10,101
attack and as I was walking to the 
stairs with the store,

2735
02:07:10,170 --> 02:07:14,360
I had connie and I looked.
I was sat at the Tiana with a hat on his

2736
02:07:14,370 --> 02:07:15,470
head.
He went to Hawaii.

2737
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:18,750
It just gave me a different toy.
She's so nice.

2738
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:22,320
She's such a nice person.
She's so nice.

2739
02:07:22,321 --> 02:07:23,730
Every time you're around her,
she's like,

2740
02:07:23,731 --> 02:07:27,820
she's so just so kind to sweetheart,
you know,

2741
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:32,960
don't cut what I set out when I got one 
foot in the grave,

2742
02:07:33,650 --> 02:07:35,500
one of banana peel.
I don't give a fuck if somebody gets mad

2743
02:07:35,501 --> 02:07:35,680
at me

2744
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:40,000
saying I'll call Yo Romero the fuck to 
handle things for me now.

2745
02:07:40,001 --> 02:07:41,170
At this age.
Yeah,

2746
02:07:41,171 --> 02:07:43,770
I don't know,
when I see cap I say hi and I like them.

2747
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:48,800
I get my hug.
I don't know what the fuck happens 

2748
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:48,800
behind the scenes,
but he's always nice to me.

2749
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:48,800
Yeah,
same here.

2750
02:07:48,850 --> 02:07:52,270
Deep down inside.
He wishes you fucking get hit by a car.

2751
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:57,040
I was watching last night,
last night I was watching Jimmy sugar do

2752
02:07:57,041 --> 02:08:00,640
magic tricks by the way.
And amazing magician.

2753
02:08:01,230 --> 02:08:02,730
He started as a magician.
Yeah,

2754
02:08:02,770 --> 02:08:05,770
he was a magician for years.
But uh,

2755
02:08:05,950 --> 02:08:07,800
like I,
he said that he also,

2756
02:08:07,801 --> 02:08:09,100
like,
he grew up starting it,

2757
02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:11,360
like doing comedy and magic,
like,

2758
02:08:11,370 --> 02:08:11,810
um,
like,

2759
02:08:11,811 --> 02:08:14,320
like you kinda did also.
Did you know that he,

2760
02:08:14,830 --> 02:08:17,320
I only did it for a little while when I 
was about eight.

2761
02:08:17,470 --> 02:08:21,610
Yeah.
I got a magic to set like a,

2762
02:08:21,790 --> 02:08:23,140
like a,
like for Christmas,

2763
02:08:23,141 --> 02:08:23,920
you know,
I could take,

2764
02:08:24,040 --> 02:08:25,810
teaches you how to do a few stupid 
tricks.

2765
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:31,290
And uh,
I did a little show on fisherman's 

2766
02:08:31,290 --> 02:08:31,290
wharf.
I did it a couple of times.

2767
02:08:31,620 --> 02:08:36,620
Yeah,
I would just set up a box and then 

2768
02:08:36,620 --> 02:08:36,620
people give me money and I'd go buy a 
comic books.

2769
02:08:36,890 --> 02:08:40,360
But I did it one time and he's fucking 
older kids fucked with me.

2770
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:44,650
They of like gave me a hard time and uh,
got scared.

2771
02:08:44,890 --> 02:08:49,890
So I stopped doing it.
They just mocked me and were goofing on 

2772
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:49,890
me and I was like,
oh,

2773
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:51,940
well I can do here.
That was like,

2774
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:52,810
you know,
eight,

2775
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:55,720
they're probably like young teenagers,
like 13 or something like that.

2776
02:08:55,721 --> 02:08:57,520
And they were mean.
So it was like,

2777
02:08:57,550 --> 02:09:00,250
all right,
I got scared and stopped doing it.

2778
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:03,240
But it was a,
it was a weird thing too.

2779
02:09:03,310 --> 02:09:05,530
If nobody tells you that you can't 
perform,

2780
02:09:05,710 --> 02:09:07,930
I would go there and I've watched these 
people put on shows.

2781
02:09:08,310 --> 02:09:13,310
They had all kinds of different shows.
People just like do like street 

2782
02:09:13,310 --> 02:09:13,420
performance.
So I was like,

2783
02:09:13,421 --> 02:09:14,380
I'll try this.
Fuck it.

2784
02:09:14,381 --> 02:09:16,390
I got my magic trick thing.
I had a hat,

2785
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:19,600
little magic hat I a cape by myself,
eight.

2786
02:09:19,770 --> 02:09:21,970
That's a ridiculous set,
this fucking thing.

2787
02:09:22,330 --> 02:09:27,330
So terrible magic tricks,
awful at it.

2788
02:09:27,730 --> 02:09:32,730
But just banking on the fact that I was 
cute helping people getting to with the 

2789
02:09:32,730 --> 02:09:33,430
bowl and you put it in a little while 
and I got,

2790
02:09:33,930 --> 02:09:36,580
I gave up,
couldn't do that shit.

2791
02:09:36,610 --> 02:09:37,420
It was tough.
But no,

2792
02:09:37,421 --> 02:09:41,800
I appreciate magic if it's his,
his Schubert's magic.

2793
02:09:41,890 --> 02:09:45,130
I mean he was bomb ass wasted.
So like I,

2794
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:48,820
you could tell he was a little sloppy 
but his magic was legit.

2795
02:09:48,830 --> 02:09:53,830
Like it was to the point where he had 
four cards down there and we saw just 

2796
02:09:53,830 --> 02:09:58,561
saw like one second ago what cards they 
were and then he would turn them over 

2797
02:09:58,561 --> 02:09:58,561
like in front of us going,
what the fuck?

2798
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:00,520
It's impossible.
How'd you do that?

2799
02:10:00,570 --> 02:10:02,140
Like,
that's magic was legit.

2800
02:10:02,340 --> 02:10:04,810
Gabriel's Christmas party yet magician 
there.

2801
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:07,450
And the motherfucker came up to me.
I was eating,

2802
02:10:08,110 --> 02:10:10,660
by the way,
Lucille's barbecue in Long Beach.

2803
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:14,620
They ain't fucking around though.
Those baby backwards was strongest.

2804
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:18,530
Magician came and he showed me and Steve
Simone on the card.

2805
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:24,210
You got to get up on that microphone.
He showed me and Steve Simone the card 

2806
02:10:24,210 --> 02:10:25,390
and then he went like this and he did 
something.

2807
02:10:25,930 --> 02:10:28,510
He told the lady over there,
take out your sleeve,

2808
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:30,870
the car who was in a fucking sleep.
I,

2809
02:10:30,871 --> 02:10:33,040
I can't figure out what the fuck.
Fuck this.

2810
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:38,740
She worked for him.
Just know that some fucking manager or 

2811
02:10:38,740 --> 02:10:38,740
something stupid.
It was fucking crazy.

2812
02:10:38,740 --> 02:10:40,520
I don't know how the hell they do.
I don't know how they do it.

2813
02:10:40,521 --> 02:10:43,640
There's some craziness going on with 
some of these magicians.

2814
02:10:43,740 --> 02:10:47,390
The sleight of hand and the way they.
They figured out how to set things up.

2815
02:10:47,570 --> 02:10:48,890
It's an art.
It's an art.

2816
02:10:48,891 --> 02:10:50,690
They don't tell you either.
They don't want to tell you.

2817
02:10:51,020 --> 02:10:53,090
We had a guy out of bed.
He bend a spoon in front of us.

2818
02:10:53,091 --> 02:10:53,470
I'm like,
I don't.

2819
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:56,040
How the fuck is this guy doing this?
He's bending a spoon with like,

2820
02:10:56,090 --> 02:11:01,090
the air is like moving his finger around
it and the spoon starts to bend and 

2821
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:01,880
twist.
So I don't know how the fuck he's doing.

2822
02:11:01,970 --> 02:11:04,700
I don't know how he's doing it,
but he's,

2823
02:11:04,770 --> 02:11:06,710
he's letting you know,
like there's a trick to it.

2824
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:11,950
I'm not going to tell you how I do it,
but it's just a trick and they've 

2825
02:11:11,950 --> 02:11:13,730
figured out how to do it in a way that 
your eyes don't catch.

2826
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Like there's a lot of the movements they
do when they're shuffling the deck and 

2827
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,150
moving cards around,
like your eyes just are not catching the

2828
02:11:20,151 --> 02:11:21,130
fluidity of their movement.

2829
02:11:21,130 --> 02:11:26,130
They get so good at it.
They can just hide the cards and you 

2830
02:11:26,130 --> 02:11:26,130
don't even see it.
You're like,

2831
02:11:26,130 --> 02:11:26,130
okay,
wait,

2832
02:11:26,130 --> 02:11:26,990
what happened?
And then all of a sudden the cars on top

2833
02:11:26,991 --> 02:11:28,670
of his hat and you're like,
where the fuck?

2834
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:30,170
Like you didn't.
You didn't see it.

2835
02:11:30,510 --> 02:11:32,840
You ever see a good pick pocket though?
Yeah.

2836
02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:35,230
It was only a video.
It's not impersonal.

2837
02:11:35,330 --> 02:11:40,330
When you play pool,
you ever see people pick pocket of 

2838
02:11:40,330 --> 02:11:40,330
people for a living?
They bump into you.

2839
02:11:40,330 --> 02:11:41,250
That's amazing.
Yeah.

2840
02:11:41,740 --> 02:11:43,250
The whole family,
they do it in teams.

2841
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:44,810
Have you watched that movie focus?
Yeah.

2842
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:47,900
No,
not an academy award winning movie.

2843
02:11:47,910 --> 02:11:48,480
Anybody?
Sweet.

2844
02:11:48,530 --> 02:11:49,580
What is focused?
Which ones?

2845
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:52,860
This is will smith and some blind shit 
and he.

2846
02:11:52,890 --> 02:11:57,890
They run a scam of going like New 
Orleans with the Super Bowl and how 

2847
02:11:57,890 --> 02:11:59,240
would it work?
Goes down and they take everything.

2848
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:01,990
They shoplift everything they fucking 
thing and it goes around and he bet.

2849
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:05,690
So let's say this fucking brilliant and 
this is how it works guys.

2850
02:12:05,930 --> 02:12:08,720
They bumped into red band because my 
friend's mom used to do it.

2851
02:12:08,721 --> 02:12:10,370
They bump into red band.
They take it,

2852
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:13,400
they take just the credit cards,
they put the wallet back.

2853
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:17,360
They have people at restaurants that 
when they take your wallet,

2854
02:12:17,361 --> 02:12:19,390
when you know when you give your credit 
card people,

2855
02:12:19,790 --> 02:12:22,100
they take it and they have a thing and 
they go like this.

2856
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:27,250
Then they sell it back to will smith.
So at the end of the day will Smith has 

2857
02:12:27,250 --> 02:12:28,280
all these credit cards.
Now he starts buying stuff online.

2858
02:12:28,530 --> 02:12:29,040
Bam,
Bam,

2859
02:12:29,050 --> 02:12:29,540
Bam,
Bam,

2860
02:12:29,550 --> 02:12:30,830
Bam man.
Then they get it.

2861
02:12:30,831 --> 02:12:35,831
Then they put it on Ebay and they 
started a third of the cost and that's 

2862
02:12:35,831 --> 02:12:35,940
how people get all that shit and it just
wasn't.

2863
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:38,590
But forget about all that dog.
Do me a favor.

2864
02:12:38,630 --> 02:12:41,420
Watch the motherfucking movie for the 
scene.

2865
02:12:41,990 --> 02:12:43,550
There's a scene,
they do what he bumped.

2866
02:12:43,551 --> 02:12:47,540
You ever seen that little Chinese guy 
that plays gay on Svu?

2867
02:12:48,170 --> 02:12:50,210
He always comes in and the challenges.
Yeah.

2868
02:12:50,350 --> 02:12:55,350
The child suffers from a dementia.
He's spending a lot of show a lot of 

2869
02:12:55,350 --> 02:12:57,230
movies to watch him in this movie.
One scene,

2870
02:12:57,860 --> 02:13:00,770
one scene.
Where do like a a gamble.

2871
02:13:00,771 --> 02:13:03,470
He's like the world's biggest gambler.
He bets on anything,

2872
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:05,120
like he'll bet on anything like,
oh,

2873
02:13:05,121 --> 02:13:07,670
you got do some them and the whole 
hustle,

2874
02:13:08,210 --> 02:13:11,790
but when this guy is doing it,
they play sympathy for the devil and you

2875
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:13,430
think the movie's taking you somewhere 
else.

2876
02:13:13,431 --> 02:13:18,431
You're like,
this motherfucking Chinese guy's the 

2877
02:13:18,431 --> 02:13:18,460
devil because he's so smooth.
Joe.

2878
02:13:18,710 --> 02:13:21,380
He plays the obnoxious Asian that's 
filthy.

2879
02:13:21,381 --> 02:13:26,381
Rich has a sports box and fucking three 
hot young fucking Asians waiting from to

2880
02:13:27,171 --> 02:13:27,860
suck his dick.

2881
02:13:28,490 --> 02:13:33,490
Everybody's drinking dom or whatever.
Even better than dom and he's brash and 

2882
02:13:33,490 --> 02:13:35,340
shit.
He's one of the races.

2883
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:40,530
What is this name?
That motherfucker that motherfucker.

2884
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:43,440
God Damn.
He was good in that movie.

2885
02:13:43,770 --> 02:13:45,840
What is his name of Jamie fighter's,
his name.

2886
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:47,580
Look it.
Look at the young parts.

2887
02:13:47,610 --> 02:13:49,740
Hitler look at the young freak waiting 
for him.

2888
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:53,850
He had kind of waiting big old cigar,
bro.

2889
02:13:53,851 --> 02:13:58,851
This guy breaks it down so.
And then the movie ends up with after 

2890
02:13:58,851 --> 02:14:00,060
that you just watched and fucking go 
focus.

2891
02:14:00,061 --> 02:14:02,430
Huh?
Focus is in theaters now.

2892
02:14:03,210 --> 02:14:07,850
I like fucking got hooked on that scene.
I had to take it home and show my wife.

2893
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:08,850
She was like,
Jesus,

2894
02:14:08,851 --> 02:14:10,890
he's fucking good.
Bd Wong.

2895
02:14:10,980 --> 02:14:14,400
That guy's been in everything.
Where are you from?

2896
02:14:14,490 --> 02:14:16,620
San Francisco.
He's 60.

2897
02:14:17,380 --> 02:14:19,200
No,
50 55.

2898
02:14:20,190 --> 02:14:21,450
He's 55.
Yeah,

2899
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:23,220
that's crazy.
Crazy.

2900
02:14:23,250 --> 02:14:25,200
It's got that Asian gene too.
God Damn.

2901
02:14:25,201 --> 02:14:27,030
That looks so much better than regular 
white people.

2902
02:14:28,170 --> 02:14:33,150
Better models at 55.
A 55 year old white guy alive.

2903
02:14:33,151 --> 02:14:35,940
It looks like Irish guy.
Jesus Christ.

2904
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:38,370
That's like the polar opposite.
Chinese in Irish,

2905
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,910
like who is Chinese?
It's not insult the fucking guy.

2906
02:14:41,911 --> 02:14:43,730
Yeah,
he's Chinese.

2907
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:46,630
So he fits the motherfucking built.
Yeah.

2908
02:14:47,660 --> 02:14:49,020
Yeah.
Hear that guy is a bad motherfucker.

2909
02:14:49,021 --> 02:14:51,530
He's been in a lot of movies.
She's seen Tangerine.

2910
02:14:54,210 --> 02:14:55,760
Do you know anything about it?
No.

2911
02:14:56,230 --> 02:15:01,230
A Tangerine is a movie that it's all 
filmed on iphones and I heard this,

2912
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:05,270
I haven't seen them and I was unsure.
I didn't know what the,

2913
02:15:05,590 --> 02:15:10,590
like wish my friend.
This is like let's watch this and I 

2914
02:15:10,590 --> 02:15:10,590
guess it's,
you know,

2915
02:15:10,590 --> 02:15:14,420
it's about a trans transsexuals and out 
of nowhere Ian Edwards pops up out of 

2916
02:15:14,911 --> 02:15:16,830
the movie in the movie and I'm just 
like,

2917
02:15:16,831 --> 02:15:18,220
what the fuck?
Why is Ian in here?

2918
02:15:18,570 --> 02:15:23,570
And it's a really good movie because 
what they did is they took real a 

2919
02:15:23,570 --> 02:15:28,260
transsexual is from la that like hang 
out at donut time at three in the 

2920
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:28,260
morning,
you know,

2921
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:31,700
like in West Hollywood and then they mix
it with actors and so it's like,

2922
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:34,500
it's got this like documentary type.
Wait,

2923
02:15:34,530 --> 02:15:36,590
is this real people?
Kind of.

2924
02:15:36,620 --> 02:15:37,820
It's interesting movie though.
So.

2925
02:15:37,940 --> 02:15:42,940
But Ian,
Ian Edwards isn't it fucked me up and 

2926
02:15:42,940 --> 02:15:45,810
show me on of Santa Monica and 
motherfucking highland.

2927
02:15:45,870 --> 02:15:50,870
I used to get stuck at that time though.
Used to a little weight watcher 

2928
02:15:50,870 --> 02:15:53,431
meetings.
So you go to like I used to go to the 

2929
02:15:53,431 --> 02:15:53,431
9:00,
wait watching me.

2930
02:15:53,431 --> 02:15:54,660
So I had to be there by 8:40.
I get stuck there.

2931
02:15:54,670 --> 02:15:59,670
Sunday mornings I looked at my left bro,
there'll be three hot motherfucking 

2932
02:15:59,670 --> 02:16:02,670
bitches and that little freak of us like
maybe she's a hooker,

2933
02:16:02,671 --> 02:16:04,350
she'll suck my dick for folio,
Laos,

2934
02:16:04,820 --> 02:16:08,630
and also they look at you and that's.
You can tell that heavy duty trannies,

2935
02:16:08,670 --> 02:16:09,840
bro.
You just step on it.

2936
02:16:09,841 --> 02:16:14,841
Fucking gas bill is in the eye contact 
the male transgender people make eye 

2937
02:16:15,241 --> 02:16:18,510
contact with you.
Like to Transy transgender hookers.

2938
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:21,640
They would make the make eye contact.
They look right at you.

2939
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:24,440
Whereas like female hookers,
they'll kind of look in your direction,

2940
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:29,140
but there's a transgender they use so

2941
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:35,020
they don't have to look at it like they 
might've had the operation or they might

2942
02:16:35,201 --> 02:16:40,201
never get the operation.
They still considered themselves a 

2943
02:16:40,201 --> 02:16:40,201
woman,
but they have.

2944
02:16:40,201 --> 02:16:41,830
They have to out with a Dick.
They have tits with a Dick.

2945
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:44,920
They still consider themselves a woman 
and they get hard ons.

2946
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:50,220
So figure that out.
It's like there's pictures of.

2947
02:16:51,790 --> 02:16:55,120
A lot of them have ones that are 
completely erect.

2948
02:16:55,780 --> 02:16:58,810
Fully woman,
like a woman's ass,

2949
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:00,970
woman's legs,
woman's waste,

2950
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,590
women's breasts,
woman's face,

2951
02:17:02,980 --> 02:17:05,710
Dick hard deck.
So confusing.

2952
02:17:07,220 --> 02:17:09,370
It makes no sense.
Like what are you.

2953
02:17:09,670 --> 02:17:12,460
I mean you can be whatever you want,
but what are you,

2954
02:17:12,610 --> 02:17:13,900
what,
how does that work?

2955
02:17:14,740 --> 02:17:15,910
I mean,
I don't,

2956
02:17:16,070 --> 02:17:17,830
I'm not.
I'm not sure what's going on here.

2957
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:19,300
You say she,
but yeah,

2958
02:17:19,301 --> 02:17:21,460
you have a Dick,
but you're allowed to.

2959
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:23,410
You're just allowed to be whatever you 
want.

2960
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:26,530
If you're a girl that Dick,
then that's that.

2961
02:17:27,260 --> 02:17:32,260
It's just confusing.
It's crazy for me to even comprehend 

2962
02:17:32,260 --> 02:17:35,560
like I don't fucking know what they even
fucking whatever what everybody wants to

2963
02:17:35,561 --> 02:17:36,400
do yet.
No,

2964
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:38,350
it was very cool.
She was trying.

2965
02:17:38,410 --> 02:17:40,180
She did the whole operation.
She was a comic.

2966
02:17:40,570 --> 02:17:42,730
I told you.
But the problem was I head was too big.

2967
02:17:42,910 --> 02:17:46,750
So that's what you fuck up like that.
That if you make the transgender,

2968
02:17:46,751 --> 02:17:51,751
they cut your Dick and they do all the 
other things and that your feelings 

2969
02:17:51,751 --> 02:17:51,751
changed,
but your head remains the same.

2970
02:17:52,100 --> 02:17:55,510
So her balance was off.
I'm not kidding you.

2971
02:17:55,540 --> 02:18:00,540
I'm not lying to you.
I named was something that was too big 

2972
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:00,540
for her.
She was happy.

2973
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:02,330
She was half Japanese.
Have some Rita,

2974
02:18:02,331 --> 02:18:03,850
Rita.
Oh Rita.

2975
02:18:03,851 --> 02:18:04,690
Oh,
whatever.

2976
02:18:04,691 --> 02:18:08,230
She was reading the whole whatever,
and she ended up dying because she would

2977
02:18:08,231 --> 02:18:13,231
fall back because the head was too 
fucking big.

2978
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:19,090
I remember that story.
The only one I really had,

2979
02:18:19,091 --> 02:18:20,920
you know,
remember the one we met in Vegas?

2980
02:18:21,250 --> 02:18:26,250
Yeah,
the one we met in Vegas where she kept 

2981
02:18:26,250 --> 02:18:26,250
showing it to us.
Yeah.

2982
02:18:26,250 --> 02:18:26,440
Oh yeah.
We didn't even know.

2983
02:18:26,650 --> 02:18:28,720
She was so tiny.
She was so tiny.

2984
02:18:28,721 --> 02:18:30,430
You would never suspect that.
She used to be a dude.

2985
02:18:32,090 --> 02:18:35,660
I don't know how old women are always at
the.

2986
02:18:35,710 --> 02:18:40,710
On the other day,
getting a picture with Santa Claus was 

2987
02:18:40,710 --> 02:18:41,450
these young girls with tight pants on 
and heels and I'm like,

2988
02:18:41,530 --> 02:18:44,050
Terry,
why these women taking pictures of Santa

2989
02:18:44,050 --> 02:18:45,550
Claus,
tyrese women.

2990
02:18:45,551 --> 02:18:49,420
Those are 15 year old fucking girls that
were women and I don't know.

2991
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:51,370
I couldn't fucking tell.
I can't tell man.

2992
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:56,880
Jared said the same thing.
Who Do you think that?

2993
02:18:57,630 --> 02:19:00,070
I mean,
do we just not remember it right?

2994
02:19:00,550 --> 02:19:03,200
Or do girls look different now when 
they're 15 and they didn't?

2995
02:19:03,210 --> 02:19:05,340
We're 15.
Are you sure though?

2996
02:19:05,620 --> 02:19:08,260
Because they're now showing site boob 
and like,

2997
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:10,660
like at young ages they didn't see that 
girl.

2998
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:13,660
Some girls had bodies.
Even back then,

2999
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,570
like you remember in high school girls 
had boobs.

3000
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:17,770
Girl.
I mean there was,

3001
02:19:17,830 --> 02:19:20,380
there was girls that were 15 that had 
boobs for sure,

3002
02:19:20,410 --> 02:19:25,410
but they were also wearing underwear and
using a Hitachi's and looking at porn,

3003
02:19:25,661 --> 02:19:27,480
you know,
they were like art.

3004
02:19:27,710 --> 02:19:28,040
When we

3005
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:29,960
grew up here,
girls were like,

3006
02:19:30,170 --> 02:19:33,260
if they just look different physically.
That's what I'm saying.

3007
02:19:33,470 --> 02:19:34,250
Like do the,
are they,

3008
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:37,370
are they more mature early?
Do they look like women earlier?

3009
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:42,400
Is that true?
Or is it just the way they're dressing 

3010
02:19:42,400 --> 02:19:42,400
confused?
I can't lie to you,

3011
02:19:42,400 --> 02:19:42,860
man.
Listen,

3012
02:19:42,861 --> 02:19:45,050
when I was 18 I didn't dig 18 year old 
women,

3013
02:19:45,470 --> 02:19:47,840
so when I was 27 I didn't think young 
women,

3014
02:19:47,870 --> 02:19:50,270
they just make me nervous.
They make me physically now.

3015
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:56,020
I just started getting comfortable.
The reason why I go on the back of the 

3016
02:19:56,020 --> 02:19:57,230
ship by the waitresses is because I 
always feel embarrassed.

3017
02:19:57,231 --> 02:20:00,530
I want everybody's eyes on me.
I don't want no misunderstandings.

3018
02:20:00,531 --> 02:20:01,970
That fucking I,
you know what I'm saying?

3019
02:20:02,130 --> 02:20:04,670
Right.
I hate when I always listened when I was

3020
02:20:04,671 --> 02:20:08,150
20 and I go to a bar and I was slowing 
and having a good time.

3021
02:20:08,150 --> 02:20:11,020
I'd see a 30 year old want the ball.
I get fucking pissed.

3022
02:20:11,310 --> 02:20:14,660
Like little punk ass bitch at a ball.
You're too old guy gone,

3023
02:20:15,270 --> 02:20:17,450
you know,
nevermind a 40 or 50 year old.

3024
02:20:17,451 --> 02:20:20,070
My blood pressure really goes up.
When I was like fucking 20th.

3025
02:20:20,090 --> 02:20:23,960
I saw a 50 year old dancing on a disco.
Oh my fucking.

3026
02:20:24,220 --> 02:20:25,640
Why is he here?
Why?

3027
02:20:25,641 --> 02:20:30,641
Why I couldn't figure it out.
That stayed with me for the rest of my 

3028
02:20:30,641 --> 02:20:32,030
life.
So when I got to be 27,

3029
02:20:32,390 --> 02:20:34,460
I already felt out of place in most 
places.

3030
02:20:34,461 --> 02:20:39,461
Like I was like,
these people looking at me like I made 

3031
02:20:39,461 --> 02:20:39,461
to do something bad.
Nevermind now.

3032
02:20:39,461 --> 02:20:41,630
And you've got these young comics like 
Joey and they'd come and hug you and I'm

3033
02:20:41,631 --> 02:20:42,830
fucking lost.
I'm like,

3034
02:20:43,130 --> 02:20:44,120
listen,
I can't do it.

3035
02:20:44,340 --> 02:20:46,940
I just feel weird.
I feel too old at the store.

3036
02:20:47,450 --> 02:20:49,520
I feel old at the store.
Do you know that?

3037
02:20:49,820 --> 02:20:51,260
Like a shame.
So I just go,

3038
02:20:51,350 --> 02:20:53,420
that's so weird.
I sit on the freezer.

3039
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:55,920
I don't bother nobody.
Why did you feel like that?

3040
02:20:55,970 --> 02:20:57,620
I feel like,
oh my God.

3041
02:20:57,621 --> 02:21:00,860
Because I was about to sit that shit 
when I was 20.

3042
02:21:00,890 --> 02:21:02,270
Yeah,
but it's a different thing now.

3043
02:21:02,271 --> 02:21:06,260
Like I feel like when you go there,
it's just a nice group of people that we

3044
02:21:06,261 --> 02:21:09,090
all know.
We all love waitstaff.

3045
02:21:09,140 --> 02:21:14,140
Fucking the bartenders.
I comics those people at all my home.

3046
02:21:14,660 --> 02:21:16,960
Why would you feel like you're too old 
to hang around with?

3047
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:20,270
Like sometimes I'm driving.
The waitresses will come out and go,

3048
02:21:20,271 --> 02:21:23,330
can you give me a ride up the hill?
Because they make the witches puddle the

3049
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:26,990
way park all the way up and help you 
crest hill all the way up.

3050
02:21:27,070 --> 02:21:32,070
They're waitresses and I walked down and
they walked down and I'll drive the 

3051
02:21:32,070 --> 02:21:33,220
waitress up there who were both hands on
the steering wheel.

3052
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:35,150
Like looking straight ahead.
Like when they're like,

3053
02:21:35,151 --> 02:21:35,800
good night.
I'm like,

3054
02:21:39,460 --> 02:21:44,460
what can you tell a waitress?
I'm not going to give you a ride home,

3055
02:21:44,930 --> 02:21:47,300
feel like a fucking idiot,
but sometimes I get leaving.

3056
02:21:47,320 --> 02:21:48,650
Joey,
can you give me a ride up the hill?

3057
02:21:48,651 --> 02:21:49,250
And you're like,
right.

3058
02:21:49,700 --> 02:21:52,010
And the whole that all that stuff broke 
bothers me.

3059
02:21:52,011 --> 02:21:53,960
Like I can't.
I just can't.

3060
02:21:54,230 --> 02:21:56,510
Last night on the way back from fucking 
mentor,

3061
02:21:56,511 --> 02:21:58,600
I can't lie to you this Christmas.
Right?

3062
02:21:59,330 --> 02:22:04,330
I said maybe there's a strip club.
I haven't been to a strip club in 20 

3063
02:22:04,330 --> 02:22:09,011
fucking years with Eddie.
Last time I went to a strip club was 

3064
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:10,880
with Eddie when we went down at his 
place.

3065
02:22:10,910 --> 02:22:12,110
What was that?
Two?

3066
02:22:12,111 --> 02:22:12,710
Oh,
one.

3067
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:14,550
Yeah,
probably the housing.

3068
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:18,350
That's the last I've been in the script,
but I'm a fucking animal of a man.

3069
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:20,770
I don't even go to strip clubs last 
night,

3070
02:22:20,771 --> 02:22:22,130
so maybe I should goes to the Strip 
club,

3071
02:22:22,640 --> 02:22:25,040
but it's between the Strip club,
hungry and getting.

3072
02:22:25,380 --> 02:22:26,250
I went and got gas

3073
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:28,720
and I went home and had a piece of 
fucking cheese and I went to bed.

3074
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:32,540
I am scared of strip clubs that you're 
fine,

3075
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:35,490
but I go on the Strip club,
but I don't know what will.

3076
02:22:35,491 --> 02:22:36,130
Hold on.
What do you.

3077
02:22:36,131 --> 02:22:38,490
What are you scared of?
I don't know Joe.

3078
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:39,720
I'm just scared,
man.

3079
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:44,550
Crazy women that I'm scared of.
Crazy fucking window man.

3080
02:22:44,630 --> 02:22:47,730
Are you scared that you would like them?
I like everybody.

3081
02:22:47,731 --> 02:22:51,230
I love women.
When you get the,

3082
02:22:51,310 --> 02:22:52,530
you know,
when you get to be 50,

3083
02:22:52,531 --> 02:22:54,690
you look at like 30 year olds and go,
Jesus Christ,

3084
02:22:55,260 --> 02:22:56,480
just a baby.
Yeah.

3085
02:22:56,490 --> 02:23:01,490
That's just a fucking baby.
Like she doesn't even know how good the 

3086
02:23:01,490 --> 02:23:01,490
pussy is right now.
She has no fucking idea.

3087
02:23:01,970 --> 02:23:03,150
You know?
It's just so weird.

3088
02:23:03,151 --> 02:23:05,670
So I don't know what a 14 year old looks
like.

3089
02:23:05,671 --> 02:23:06,720
We're supposed to look like.

3090
02:23:06,790 --> 02:23:08,550
I don't remember.
That's the problem.

3091
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:12,450
Don't accurately remember what it looked
like when I was 14 compared to what they

3092
02:23:12,451 --> 02:23:17,451
look like today.
I'm pretty sure their bodies were 

3093
02:23:17,451 --> 02:23:19,611
exactly the same.
We're just seeing more of it because 

3094
02:23:19,611 --> 02:23:19,950
we're seeing sluts.
They look like porn stars nowadays.

3095
02:23:19,980 --> 02:23:24,980
You know,
at 14 where that wasn't the case back 

3096
02:23:24,980 --> 02:23:24,980
then.
It was,

3097
02:23:24,980 --> 02:23:24,980
you know.
Yeah,

3098
02:23:24,980 --> 02:23:29,390
it seems like there's definitely an 
influence where they're like the pop 

3099
02:23:29,390 --> 02:23:30,150
culture,
like the Nicki Minaj.

3100
02:23:30,180 --> 02:23:33,500
Stick your ass out look and all the 
young.

3101
02:23:34,670 --> 02:23:37,390
The young one definitely.
It took a dash,

3102
02:23:37,490 --> 02:23:39,710
a family for sure.
Candle.

3103
02:23:39,830 --> 02:23:43,300
That's what she'd done that every day 
she's on my yahoo page.

3104
02:23:43,301 --> 02:23:48,301
She said,
why is she on my yahoo page every day 

3105
02:23:48,301 --> 02:23:50,380
with some young black,
skinny kid kenvil and what's the other?

3106
02:23:50,420 --> 02:23:52,650
It's all confusing.
It's all the whole thing.

3107
02:23:52,760 --> 02:23:54,000
There's A.
There's a gang of them.

3108
02:23:54,060 --> 02:23:56,580
Kylie,
Kylie,

3109
02:23:56,610 --> 02:24:01,610
let me tell you something.
I ain't mad at the fucking system no 

3110
02:24:01,610 --> 02:24:01,610
more.
I ain't mad at that fucking dirty whore.

3111
02:24:02,130 --> 02:24:04,140
I ain't mad at that bitch no more.
You know what man?

3112
02:24:04,141 --> 02:24:05,460
She picked the loop.
She pitched him.

3113
02:24:05,730 --> 02:24:07,950
I read the article by her fucking hot 
the other day.

3114
02:24:08,430 --> 02:24:10,800
She was making a million dollars an hour
or something like that.

3115
02:24:11,190 --> 02:24:13,650
I can't be mad at her man.
She'd made it.

3116
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:16,470
That's the American dream.
How can I be mad at that?

3117
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:19,290
How can I be mad at that?
She found her niche.

3118
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:22,400
She showed her pussy one time.
She hasn't showed us anymore.

3119
02:24:22,410 --> 02:24:24,390
It's like she shows up once every three 
weeks.

3120
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:29,720
She made a tape and she found a window.
A little fucking window though.

3121
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:32,250
I liked it.
Do I want to hang out with her and Kanye

3122
02:24:32,251 --> 02:24:33,350
fucking north,
whatever.

3123
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:35,580
No,
I with those people.

3124
02:24:35,940 --> 02:24:37,770
Well,
let's give credit where credit is due,

3125
02:24:37,771 --> 02:24:38,640
man.
Well,

3126
02:24:38,641 --> 02:24:43,580
she's the best ever at reality TV.
That family is the best ever.

3127
02:24:43,581 --> 02:24:48,581
At reality TV,
they figured out how to corner the 

3128
02:24:48,581 --> 02:24:49,560
market to lock it down.
Every scandal makes the show better.

3129
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:54,800
Like just some people that did reality 
TV and they got pretty famous like John 

3130
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:54,800
and kate plus eight.

3131
02:24:56,470 --> 02:25:00,550
Justin,
what about one chick test?

3132
02:25:00,570 --> 02:25:04,650
A black boyfriend and he fucked the 
transvestite and they got back together.

3133
02:25:04,651 --> 02:25:06,330
She's one of the girls or something like
that,

3134
02:25:06,340 --> 02:25:08,850
but there's a bunch of them,
but the John and kate plus eight,

3135
02:25:08,851 --> 02:25:10,690
they were giant.
There was a giant show.

3136
02:25:10,691 --> 02:25:13,080
It was like all over the news.
It was a Christian magazines.

3137
02:25:13,090 --> 02:25:15,660
Yeah.
They had artificial intimidation and she

3138
02:25:15,661 --> 02:25:18,990
had fucking six babies inside of her.
She was insane.

3139
02:25:19,350 --> 02:25:20,920
Well,
they broke up and they.

3140
02:25:20,960 --> 02:25:24,040
They didn't survive the scandal,
but these people,

3141
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:27,280
doesn't matter what happens,
it doesn't matter who they married,

3142
02:25:27,410 --> 02:25:32,410
it doesn't matter who gets divorced,
it doesn't matter who decides they're a 

3143
02:25:32,410 --> 02:25:35,191
woman,
doesn't matter who decides there a man 

3144
02:25:35,191 --> 02:25:35,320
doesn't matter,
just like the show keeps going.

3145
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:39,550
They figured out a way that it's the 
right frequency of editing,

3146
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:44,760
of like,
like real relatable drama and people 

3147
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:44,760
that are just,
you know,

3148
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:49,261
they look good and they squeeze it all 
together in this crazy semi fake show or

3149
02:25:51,041 --> 02:25:53,740
it's not really a reality show.
You can call it a reality show,

3150
02:25:53,890 --> 02:25:55,930
but they set up every scenario.
It's obvious.

3151
02:25:55,931 --> 02:26:00,931
So it's almost like semi scripted.
So this is weird show and these people,

3152
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:06,720
they're just famous for being famous.
She wakes up in the morning and she 

3153
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:10,190
looks sort of thing and she'll ask like,
who's trending on what?

3154
02:26:10,570 --> 02:26:13,060
Who's trending?
Ronda Rousey watch this,

3155
02:26:13,330 --> 02:26:16,150
but within five minutes she's trying to.
Number one,

3156
02:26:16,151 --> 02:26:19,990
she goes to trend number one on google.
If you're trending number one on Google,

3157
02:26:19,991 --> 02:26:24,991
you're selling shit.
She's selling blouses and had dudes and 

3158
02:26:24,991 --> 02:26:26,930
I wax remover and fucking,
you know,

3159
02:26:27,730 --> 02:26:32,730
whatever the fuck those are.
Many of us have some fucking heavy duty 

3160
02:26:32,730 --> 02:26:33,670
pussy.
Those Armenio's no least checks.

3161
02:26:33,671 --> 02:26:37,360
You got to shave that pussy three times 
with a double edged razor and shit.

3162
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:42,680
She got our meeting Stan Hope.
Describe Asian pussy hair.

3163
02:26:46,430 --> 02:26:48,600
Something like rat whiskers.
Would it be.

3164
02:26:52,100 --> 02:26:55,120
I forget how you described it.
I'm the fucking it up and it's funny.

3165
02:26:55,710 --> 02:26:57,590
You don't think there's anything that 
could kill that,

3166
02:26:57,620 --> 02:26:59,670
that whole thing like.
I mean cause.

3167
02:26:59,671 --> 02:27:02,440
But you would never have thought like 
something can take down cosby.

3168
02:27:02,441 --> 02:27:07,441
You think double cosby could take down.
Occurred dashing is anything that mean 

3169
02:27:07,441 --> 02:27:07,630
double cosmic?
What are you saying?

3170
02:27:08,050 --> 02:27:10,360
Something that is so bad that could 
kill.

3171
02:27:10,361 --> 02:27:12,080
That's the worst.
It's hard to think.

3172
02:27:12,130 --> 02:27:15,600
You'd have to be like w w what he did is
almost like murder.

3173
02:27:15,610 --> 02:27:16,810
Yeah.
You know,

3174
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:18,370
I mean you'd have to come in,
right?

3175
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:19,930
No,
not necessarily.

3176
02:27:20,620 --> 02:27:23,770
Why they haven't done anything wrong.
Like you think of what they've done.

3177
02:27:24,590 --> 02:27:28,390
You can hate this show for sucking.
You could say it's boring and mindless.

3178
02:27:28,391 --> 02:27:29,110
But.
So what?

3179
02:27:29,380 --> 02:27:31,770
So as most shit that's on tv,
I've never watched it.

3180
02:27:33,090 --> 02:27:38,090
I think they set up tomorrow and they 
said that they sent the bad plus that he

3181
02:27:39,780 --> 02:27:40,530
went in there.

3182
02:27:40,840 --> 02:27:43,700
I think he couldn't handle the pressure.
Hola ma?

3183
02:27:43,870 --> 02:27:46,200
Yeah,
they freak out.

3184
02:27:46,210 --> 02:27:47,770
He's like,
you went after a photographer,

3185
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:52,600
mother-in-law cutting his deal and she 
got laker tickets.

3186
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:56,080
Season tickets for the rest of her life.
Jesus Christ.

3187
02:27:56,500 --> 02:27:58,060
That's the deal.
She cut though.

3188
02:27:58,120 --> 02:28:00,100
That's amazing.
Yeah.

3189
02:28:00,101 --> 02:28:02,740
It's like,
it ain't a good show,

3190
02:28:02,780 --> 02:28:07,780
you know?
It's not something I want to spend my 

3191
02:28:07,780 --> 02:28:07,780
time watching.
But why?

3192
02:28:07,780 --> 02:28:08,290
Why you so mad?
I liked it 10 times on the road.

3193
02:28:08,330 --> 02:28:12,520
It's not entertaining and she doesn't 
amuse.

3194
02:28:12,590 --> 02:28:17,590
But here's my question.
Why is it like more offensive when 

3195
02:28:17,590 --> 02:28:20,290
something's not entertaining and it's 
quote unquote reality,

3196
02:28:20,291 --> 02:28:23,510
like semi.
Why does that bother us?

3197
02:28:23,630 --> 02:28:26,330
Whereas a show where you're making shit 
up entirely,

3198
02:28:26,390 --> 02:28:30,140
it's totally scripted and it sucks.
Doesn't bother you that there's a lot of

3199
02:28:30,141 --> 02:28:31,640
shows that suck.
There's a lot of like,

3200
02:28:31,680 --> 02:28:34,760
our dramas are fucking terrible.
He tried to watch and be like,

3201
02:28:34,820 --> 02:28:36,410
oh my God,
what is this shit?

3202
02:28:36,890 --> 02:28:39,350
But he doesn't offend you,
it doesn't get you angry.

3203
02:28:39,650 --> 02:28:44,650
Like he will see that show,
like all the reality air quotes about 

3204
02:28:44,650 --> 02:28:46,280
it,
although the nonsense and you're like,

3205
02:28:46,281 --> 02:28:48,230
why isn't anybody watching this?
This is crazy.

3206
02:28:48,290 --> 02:28:51,410
So they get mad.
They get mad at that show,

3207
02:28:51,470 --> 02:28:53,060
but they don't get mad at scripted 
shows.

3208
02:28:53,150 --> 02:28:56,090
It's very strange just because those 
people are being themselves.

3209
02:28:56,580 --> 02:28:57,380
But.
So what?

3210
02:28:57,500 --> 02:28:59,870
And said they're real people.
I know Sorta,

3211
02:28:59,871 --> 02:29:01,340
but they're not.
You know,

3212
02:29:01,360 --> 02:29:04,940
it's all characatures.
It's real people doing fake shit.

3213
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:06,290
Yeah.
But it's like,

3214
02:29:06,950 --> 02:29:08,960
who cares?
Like why do we care?

3215
02:29:08,990 --> 02:29:13,990
But we do get angry.
You get upset because they're not doing 

3216
02:29:13,990 --> 02:29:13,990
anything special.
It's not like,

3217
02:29:13,990 --> 02:29:17,951
sir,
you should go see Cirque du Soleil and 

3218
02:29:17,951 --> 02:29:19,991
they're doing handstands with one hand 
and there got someone standing on their 

3219
02:29:19,991 --> 02:29:23,861
feet doing a handstand on this guy and 
it was like three people and they're 

3220
02:29:23,861 --> 02:29:25,070
stacked and they all look shredded.
Like superheroes,

3221
02:29:25,071 --> 02:29:27,770
like Holy Shit.
He watched them flip through the air and

3222
02:29:27,771 --> 02:29:29,690
catch each other and do all that crazy 
shit.

3223
02:29:29,870 --> 02:29:34,460
It's undeniable that they put a crazy 
amount of work into achieving this.

3224
02:29:34,970 --> 02:29:39,970
When you watch these people just be 
themselves and make more money than 

3225
02:29:39,970 --> 02:29:41,120
anybody who's ever lived.
People don't see

3226
02:29:41,290 --> 02:29:43,830
seem to care anymore.
Like I mean look at the.

3227
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:45,560
You have all the youtube stars.
They're,

3228
02:29:45,561 --> 02:29:50,561
they're just mindless people talking 
that half of the time they don't have 

3229
02:29:50,561 --> 02:29:51,310
any talent.
They're just like pretty much rehab,

3230
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:56,520
hashing people's jokes or ideas and 
thoughts and making tons of money and 

3231
02:29:56,801 --> 02:29:59,770
youtube branding them as their youtube 
stars,

3232
02:30:00,070 --> 02:30:05,070
but like that's really popular and 
that's kind of like a Kurdish 

3233
02:30:05,070 --> 02:30:05,070
Kardashian.
It's not like it's,

3234
02:30:05,070 --> 02:30:05,980
it's,
it's fake shit.

3235
02:30:06,340 --> 02:30:07,510
People doing fake shit.

3236
02:30:07,860 --> 02:30:09,830
No.
How long has that show been on TV?

3237
02:30:09,831 --> 02:30:12,890
Because I'm on going on forever.
It's been around forever.

3238
02:30:12,940 --> 02:30:17,940
They're going to go back to the history.
They're going to find out that it was 

3239
02:30:17,940 --> 02:30:18,320
never not on the air.
That is actually like they used to do it

3240
02:30:18,321 --> 02:30:23,321
by fire and what is shadow shows back in
the fucking 16 hundreds to make a year.

3241
02:30:24,020 --> 02:30:29,020
Who knows?
Hundreds of millions of dollars 

3242
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:29,020
probably.
Jamie knows for sure,

3243
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:33,730
but what my point is like.
I think it's a demonic show and it's 

3244
02:30:33,730 --> 02:30:37,031
probably been here since the beginning 
of time and we just pretend we get 

3245
02:30:37,031 --> 02:30:38,000
sucked into a trance.
I just started like a few years ago.

3246
02:30:38,001 --> 02:30:39,110
Right?
We don't remember.

3247
02:30:39,230 --> 02:30:42,110
It's one of those like,
like twilight zone episodes will realize

3248
02:30:42,111 --> 02:30:43,910
one day it's always been here.
Boy,

3249
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:49,540
that show's always been here and you 
start remembering yourself as a child,

3250
02:30:49,941 --> 02:30:51,950
waking up,
looking at your crib and keeping up with

3251
02:30:51,951 --> 02:30:56,951
the Kardashians on TV.
It doesn't even make any sense because 

3252
02:30:56,951 --> 02:30:59,620
from a totally different era,
but you remember it throw your whole 

3253
02:30:59,620 --> 02:31:02,591
life when no one was around.
Keeping up with the Kardashians was on 

3254
02:31:02,591 --> 02:31:02,870
some fucking strange phantom channel out
there.

3255
02:31:02,871 --> 02:31:04,370
You just had to figure out how to tune 
it in.

3256
02:31:04,670 --> 02:31:07,180
It's always been there.
Joey always been.

3257
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:09,680
It seems like that,
doesn't it?

3258
02:31:10,380 --> 02:31:11,600
No,
no,

3259
02:31:11,601 --> 02:31:13,640
I'm high as fuck.
I can't believe that.

3260
02:31:13,641 --> 02:31:16,190
Even the guy with the $52 million.

3261
02:31:18,380 --> 02:31:23,280
Oh Jesus Christ has a lot of money.
She looks odd.

3262
02:31:27,080 --> 02:31:32,080
That is going on.
You look different.

3263
02:31:32,620 --> 02:31:33,990
Um,
she still looks beautiful.

3264
02:31:34,590 --> 02:31:36,540
Still Beautiful,
gorgeous woman.

3265
02:31:36,710 --> 02:31:39,090
No doubt about it.
She's got damn beautiful.

3266
02:31:39,091 --> 02:31:42,750
Look at her face,
beautiful classic face structure,

3267
02:31:42,810 --> 02:31:44,250
Beautiful Lips,
beautiful eyes,

3268
02:31:44,490 --> 02:31:47,330
but she looked odd,
but picks the.

3269
02:31:47,670 --> 02:31:52,670
Let's just stop.
We don't need to stare at this poor 

3270
02:31:52,670 --> 02:31:52,670
girl.
I was telling you about.

3271
02:31:52,670 --> 02:31:53,430
Why is,
why is it so offensive?

3272
02:31:53,490 --> 02:31:55,230
It is though.
What's to love her,

3273
02:31:55,260 --> 02:31:56,640
but she doesn't do anything wrong.
No,

3274
02:31:56,670 --> 02:31:57,870
she's not.
She's like,

3275
02:31:58,110 --> 02:32:00,420
I say 100 times more stupid shit than 
she does.

3276
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:02,220
She's like,
she seems like a nice person.

3277
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:04,170
She.
Kanye is awesome.

3278
02:32:04,171 --> 02:32:06,180
I like Kanye.
He says some stupid shit,

3279
02:32:06,181 --> 02:32:06,800
but who?
What,

3280
02:32:06,810 --> 02:32:11,810
what?
Fucking super talented young uber 

3281
02:32:11,810 --> 02:32:13,590
celebrity doesn't say stupid shit man.
That guy's driven like he's.

3282
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:16,620
He's like,
there's certain types of driven,

3283
02:32:17,100 --> 02:32:19,050
like superstar type driven.

3284
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:22,410
That's what that guy is.
He's got that superstar type drive.

3285
02:32:22,590 --> 02:32:24,240
Those guys,
they always have problems with.

3286
02:32:24,241 --> 02:32:26,940
People are always mad at someone always 
math oppressed,

3287
02:32:27,050 --> 02:32:32,050
mad at this guy or that guy.
They're just these bundles of fury and 

3288
02:32:32,050 --> 02:32:36,110
inspiration and ideas and they just 
don't always manage it correctly and 

3289
02:32:36,110 --> 02:32:38,680
that's why he came out with that song 
about assholes and douchebags.

3290
02:32:38,730 --> 02:32:41,430
Remember that song that he came out with
after he did the Taylor swift thing?

3291
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:46,760
Let's hear it for the assholes.
Jamie knows he has his phone rang and 

3292
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:46,760
talk.
You call them right now.

3293
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:50,511
We'll hear it if I tell you guys.
I don't know.

3294
02:32:51,730 --> 02:32:53,150
One Kanye,
so.

3295
02:32:53,250 --> 02:32:54,690
Oh yeah,
he's a gold digger.

3296
02:32:54,691 --> 02:32:58,620
You know that gold digger.
So that's Jamie Kennedy.

3297
02:32:58,621 --> 02:32:59,470
What's his name?
No,

3298
02:33:02,550 --> 02:33:04,680
that's a great fucking song.
I know that one,

3299
02:33:04,681 --> 02:33:07,180
but nothing else like black Jesus.
Oh,

3300
02:33:07,290 --> 02:33:08,550
let me tell you this before I forget.

3301
02:33:08,730 --> 02:33:13,730
Jamie Foxx,
you have to listen to Jamie Fox on the 

3302
02:33:13,730 --> 02:33:13,730
Tim Ferriss podcast.
Holy Shit.

3303
02:33:13,730 --> 02:33:16,320
Tim ferriss got together with Jamie Foxx
and did some epic,

3304
02:33:16,321 --> 02:33:21,321
crazy long podcast for Jamie Foxx.
Breakdown breaks down is showbiz 

3305
02:33:21,321 --> 02:33:23,640
experiences.
It's fucking amazing.

3306
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:26,910
Jamie Foxx is one of the baddest 
motherfuckers of all time.

3307
02:33:27,120 --> 02:33:29,280
When you hear just how he organizes 
parties,

3308
02:33:29,670 --> 02:33:31,170
he would get the parties goes,
you know what,

3309

02:33:36,171 --> 02:33:36,171
And No,

3312
02:33:36,171 --> 02:33:37,050
no assholes.
No one's a dick.

3313
02:33:37,230 --> 02:33:38,700
I call people up.
No haters.

3314
02:33:38,701 --> 02:33:40,140
Everybody's cool.
You're cool.

3315
02:33:40,141 --> 02:33:41,280
He's cool.
Everybody's cool,

3316
02:33:41,400 --> 02:33:44,280
we'll get some bomb ass bitches.
We got some girls that are hot,

3317
02:33:44,430 --> 02:33:46,590
but they're not stuck up.
They'd friendly,

3318
02:33:46,591 --> 02:33:48,270
not too slutty,
just right there,

3319
02:33:48,271 --> 02:33:52,020
the perfect mix and get this perfect man
and he's talking about all these artists

3320
02:33:52,021 --> 02:33:57,021
that he has come over and he had Kanye 
West come over and he asked Kanye West 

3321
02:33:57,021 --> 02:33:59,720
to freestyle and Kanye West freestyled 
in front of everybody and the alleys.

3322
02:33:59,730 --> 02:34:00,690
Other guys like,
man,

3323
02:34:00,691 --> 02:34:02,670
I've been hearing about you.
He's talking about all these different,

3324
02:34:02,671 --> 02:34:07,671
like at the time up and coming.
People like drake who became like these 

3325
02:34:07,671 --> 02:34:08,370
big,
huge superstars,

3326
02:34:08,600 --> 02:34:11,530
some a fucking amazing podcast.
Jane.

3327
02:34:12,080 --> 02:34:14,460
I've always thought Jamie Foxx is 
insanely talented.

3328
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:17,810
Like if you see the way sings,
I see the way he acts like that red

3329
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:19,350
or the um,
uh,

3330
02:34:19,390 --> 02:34:22,920
Ray Charles movie.
God Damn God damn.

3331
02:34:23,140 --> 02:34:24,910
He's good.
He's amazing,

3332
02:34:24,911 --> 02:34:25,870
right?
But,

3333
02:34:26,150 --> 02:34:27,310
and,
and on top of that,

3334
02:34:27,311 --> 02:34:30,220
he's stand up comic.
But when you hear him talk,

3335
02:34:30,610 --> 02:34:32,220
you realize,
Oh dude,

3336
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:36,610
this guy is as a master life.
He's figured out how to live life.

3337
02:34:36,690 --> 02:34:38,410
You want this inside the active 
students?

3338
02:34:38,440 --> 02:34:40,360
No,
no.

3339
02:34:40,361 --> 02:34:41,320
Um,
I want to hear it though.

3340
02:34:41,350 --> 02:34:42,850
His Grandmother,
his grandmother raised him,

3341
02:34:43,360 --> 02:34:45,440
his grandma used to make them put parent
on everyday.

3342
02:34:45,730 --> 02:34:47,910
Wow.
And his grandmother just,

3343
02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:52,920
he,
he took every big movie experience that 

3344
02:34:52,920 --> 02:34:55,750
he had and related to his grandmother,
the football movie.

3345
02:34:55,930 --> 02:34:57,910
His grandmother raised him,
right.

3346
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:00,730
And his,
the panel one was the story,

3347
02:35:00,731 --> 02:35:02,920
but the music and how he got Ray 
Charles,

3348
02:35:03,190 --> 02:35:05,260
this is grandma used to make them play 
the piano,

3349
02:35:05,300 --> 02:35:06,460
just,
you know.

3350
02:35:06,461 --> 02:35:09,370
And then this thing at the store,
he changed his name to Jamie Foxx.

3351
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:13,330
So they thought he was like or whatever.
And they sign up at the factory.

3352
02:35:13,350 --> 02:35:18,350
He changed his name to Jamie Foxx 
because girls get on stage more than 

3353
02:35:18,350 --> 02:35:18,350
guys did because it wasn't that many of 
them,

3354
02:35:20,870 --> 02:35:21,980
you know.
So yes.

3355
02:35:22,010 --> 02:35:27,010
Smart.
You see these guys that come and go and 

3356
02:35:27,010 --> 02:35:30,031
I read them,
I can't stand when I see these people 

3357
02:35:30,031 --> 02:35:32,980
though the Shams and all of a sudden the
part of this social thing and they're 

3358
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:36,991
fucking terrible.
But then you get some guy came to put 

3359
02:35:36,991 --> 02:35:40,261
the work in.
I heard that when he was on in living 

3360
02:35:40,261 --> 02:35:42,211
color,
he still couldn't get an agent when he 

3361
02:35:42,211 --> 02:35:42,211
was doing that fucking check,
whatever.

3362
02:35:42,211 --> 02:35:43,900
He couldn't get an agent like nobody 
would represent them.

3363
02:35:43,901 --> 02:35:45,220
Shit like that.
That's crazy.

3364
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:47,080
That's crazy.
That's fucking crazy to me.

3365
02:35:47,081 --> 02:35:49,510
But you know what man?
Cream always rises to the top.

3366
02:35:49,570 --> 02:35:51,130
He would play a drag queen,
right?

3367
02:35:51,160 --> 02:35:52,900
Yeah.
He played up whatever it.

3368
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:57,710
Was it a drag queen or is a woman who's 
playing to name something like that.

3369
02:35:57,830 --> 02:36:01,390
It a drag queen or a woman.
What's that name is Martin Lawrence,

3370
02:36:01,391 --> 02:36:01,870
but.
Oh,

3371
02:36:01,871 --> 02:36:02,590
okay.
You're right.

3372
02:36:02,620 --> 02:36:03,500
You're right.
She mania.

3373
02:36:03,970 --> 02:36:06,940
Fonda was supposed to be a woman.

3374
02:36:09,080 --> 02:36:12,550
Just implied he was corrected to 
interpretation.

3375
02:36:12,580 --> 02:36:14,350
He's great now.
Tom Cruise,

3376
02:36:14,380 --> 02:36:16,060
he's great and everything,
but Tom Cruise,

3377
02:36:16,061 --> 02:36:18,250
to me it's doing the Mike Tyson movie 
right now.

3378
02:36:18,310 --> 02:36:19,190
I don't know.
Is He?

3379
02:36:20,200 --> 02:36:21,670
Have you ever dressed up as a woman,
Joe?

3380
02:36:21,910 --> 02:36:23,190
Oh yeah.
Really?

3381
02:36:23,260 --> 02:36:24,010
For sure.
Yeah.

3382
02:36:24,020 --> 02:36:29,020
Did it in a public access show on TV in 
1988?

3383
02:36:29,321 --> 02:36:31,510
We were like open microphone.
I mean this dude,

3384
02:36:31,570 --> 02:36:36,350
Todd Parker and a couple other guys is 
Larry.

3385
02:36:36,360 --> 02:36:37,960
I'm Larry Russ.
Bucci.

3386
02:36:38,320 --> 02:36:40,330
We've,
when we first started out doing standup,

3387
02:36:40,331 --> 02:36:44,500
we were all open micros together and uh,
there is Wanda,

3388
02:36:44,530 --> 02:36:46,150
Wanda,
the massage therapists.

3389
02:36:46,650 --> 02:36:50,590
The lips is a lariat.
Jamie Foxx is a bad motherfucker dude.

3390
02:36:50,950 --> 02:36:51,760
Anyway,
we did this.

3391
02:36:52,390 --> 02:36:55,480
We found out that you could get like 
time on cable access shows.

3392
02:36:55,690 --> 02:36:58,660
They just like let you use cable access 
and you could,

3393
02:36:58,780 --> 02:37:03,780
you could make your own television show.
So we put together these horrible 

3394
02:37:03,780 --> 02:37:05,160
sketches and in one of them I played a 
woman.

3395
02:37:05,170 --> 02:37:09,280
I had a dress on and a wig and I went to
fucking sketch was,

3396
02:37:09,490 --> 02:37:12,460
but I had to come in and sweep the guy 
off his feet and run away with them.

3397
02:37:12,550 --> 02:37:15,950
So stupid.
Like I don't remember what it was,

3398
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:19,070
but I wore a dress that I find.
I have a picture of you,

3399
02:37:19,120 --> 02:37:23,390
joey dressed up as a woman,
dressed me up like a girl before.

3400
02:37:23,450 --> 02:37:25,610
I've never done it.
I'm scared.

3401
02:37:25,670 --> 02:37:28,520
Don't be scared.
I make my mega hot chick.

3402
02:37:28,790 --> 02:37:33,560
You might look at yourself in the mirror
and you just fucking run with this Eddie

3403
02:37:33,561 --> 02:37:35,630
izzard.
You don't even have to address it.

3404
02:37:35,690 --> 02:37:38,540
Like Eddie Izzard.
He'd go on stage dressed up like a woman

3405
02:37:38,541 --> 02:37:41,990
and not say a word too hot.
No,

3406
02:37:42,070 --> 02:37:44,480
I can't.
I can't dress up like a woman bothers my

3407
02:37:44,530 --> 02:37:48,020
core Spanish.
You had drives me fucking nuts.

3408
02:37:48,021 --> 02:37:49,610
I never met this small.

3409
02:37:49,670 --> 02:37:52,550
I never got the joke like after I see 
you with the dress on.

3410
02:37:52,551 --> 02:37:54,560
Okay,
now I've got to stand like this.

3411
02:37:54,561 --> 02:37:56,090
Like a fucking asshole.
That's right.

3412
02:37:56,150 --> 02:38:00,320
It's like if you go to a football game 
with a Jersey on and your team loses,

3413
02:38:00,321 --> 02:38:02,870
you got to get back on the train with 
that stupid fucking shirt on.

3414
02:38:03,100 --> 02:38:05,540
That's a long train ride home.
You're had dumped flopped.

3415
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:09,300
I've always been one of those guys 
wearing those jerseys.

3416
02:38:09,310 --> 02:38:11,390
You Jack off.
Your team loses.

3417
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:14,310
There you are.
The train like a fucking mobile there.

3418
02:38:14,680 --> 02:38:17,180
That's hilarious.
I can't commit.

3419
02:38:17,181 --> 02:38:20,540
I ain't got that fucking commitment.
Fuck you.

3420
02:38:21,080 --> 02:38:22,190
I can't do it.
That's why.

3421
02:38:22,191 --> 02:38:24,550
That's the dress thing like I've been to
shows.

3422
02:38:24,570 --> 02:38:27,020
Now we want you to dress up like a doll.
It's not going to work.

3423
02:38:27,050 --> 02:38:32,050
Who Was it?
Was it Dave Chappelle that was saying 

3424
02:38:32,050 --> 02:38:33,440
that there's certain thing that happens 
to black actors,

3425
02:38:33,670 --> 02:38:35,630
like black Comedians,
black actors,

3426
02:38:35,631 --> 02:38:40,631
they get to a certain level of 
popularity and then they start putting 

3427
02:38:40,631 --> 02:38:44,180
them in movies where they make them wear
dresses and it's so true.

3428
02:38:44,210 --> 02:38:45,170
Once,
once he said it,

3429
02:38:45,171 --> 02:38:48,840
I started looking into it.
Julie Newmar,

3430
02:38:48,860 --> 02:38:53,860
right?
Where Wesley snipes shredded is that 

3431
02:38:53,860 --> 02:38:54,110
chick.
He's fucking yoked and shredded.

3432
02:38:54,111 --> 02:38:55,400
He's a chick,
right?

3433
02:38:55,580 --> 02:38:58,130
There's a other.
There's a gang of those movies.

3434
02:38:58,131 --> 02:39:00,920
The Martin Lawrence movies.
Eddie Murphy played his mom,

3435
02:39:01,070 --> 02:39:01,730
right?
He played with.

3436
02:39:01,750 --> 02:39:04,080
He's played his grandma who played all 
of my head.

3437
02:39:04,090 --> 02:39:04,760
All of them,
right?

3438
02:39:04,790 --> 02:39:09,790
He's played women.
He's done women before and it just goes 

3439
02:39:09,790 --> 02:39:13,091
back through like television history.
They would take like famous black 

3440
02:39:13,091 --> 02:39:14,540
comedians and it would make them play 
women.

3441
02:39:14,541 --> 02:39:19,450
They would play women in movies there.
There's Wesley Snipes and uh,

3442
02:39:19,550 --> 02:39:21,050
what's his face?
The dude on the left.

3443
02:39:21,051 --> 02:39:22,880
And Patrick Swayze,
John Leguizamo.

3444
02:39:22,881 --> 02:39:27,020
And Patrick swayze.
Patrick swayze movie.

3445
02:39:27,021 --> 02:39:30,170
I forgot all about the day by mistake.
I caught it.

3446
02:39:30,830 --> 02:39:35,830
How fucking good is that movie?
That movie called revenge with Anthony 

3447
02:39:35,830 --> 02:39:37,470
Quinn.
And the fucking body.

3448
02:39:37,471 --> 02:39:38,390
God,
what's his name?

3449
02:39:38,480 --> 02:39:39,200
Kevin Costner.

3450
02:39:39,230 --> 02:39:40,110
Oh,
I remember that movie.

3451
02:39:40,111 --> 02:39:42,470
And that beautiful woman.
Who is that woman to crazy one.

3452
02:39:42,800 --> 02:39:44,540
Crazy one that he cheated on.
Yeah.

3453
02:39:44,590 --> 02:39:48,190
Then fucking Quinn put a fucking beat on
him.

3454
02:39:48,610 --> 02:39:51,950
But go to revenge.
The beaten that Anthony Quinn puts on.

3455
02:39:52,310 --> 02:39:55,100
What's his fucking name?
But that's a good movie.

3456
02:39:55,101 --> 02:40:00,101
Then it has a good wave.
Gets out of the hospital or what's his 

3457
02:40:00,101 --> 02:40:00,101
name?
Gets out of the hospital.

3458
02:40:00,101 --> 02:40:04,220
He teams up with Leguizamo and they go.
She makes her a hooker member.

3459
02:40:04,221 --> 02:40:05,210
He cuts her face.
He goes,

3460
02:40:05,211 --> 02:40:10,211
you want to get fucked?
I'm going to send you to a place where 

3461
02:40:10,211 --> 02:40:10,910
you get fucked every day.
And he fucking slices of face.

3462
02:40:11,240 --> 02:40:16,240
Then they throw it to the hooker house 
and they just come in drug or and fuck 

3463
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:19,621
her all day long.
And then fucking what's his name has to 

3464
02:40:19,621 --> 02:40:20,710
come and save.
I forgot all about that fire.

3465
02:40:20,720 --> 02:40:22,980
Remember,
look at Anthony Quinn.

3466
02:40:23,020 --> 02:40:28,020
How bad ass he was at 70.
He was still spitting out kids in 

3467
02:40:28,020 --> 02:40:28,320
Mexico.
It's 70.

3468
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:29,750
What's her name?
Uh,

3469
02:40:30,810 --> 02:40:35,810
I forget the girl,
but now the dudes beating up.

3470
02:40:35,911 --> 02:40:40,911
Kevin Costner Stole Madeline stope.
Oh yeah,

3471
02:40:41,940 --> 02:40:46,040

They beat the shit out of Kevin Costner.

3472
02:40:46,110 --> 02:40:46,540
Oh,

3473
02:40:49,470 --> 02:40:52,080

This is a really fucked up.

3474
02:40:52,280 --> 02:40:54,510
And Anthony Quinn,

3475
02:40:55,050 --> 02:40:58,620
That motherfucker was a real actor.

3476
02:40:58,621 --> 02:41:00,240

3477
02:41:02,560 --> 02:41:03,010
Yeah.

3478
02:41:06,690 --> 02:41:11,690
Good movie though.

110th street.

02:41:46,250 --> 02:41:49,020
It was a points daunting.
Bing watching some fucked up shit.

3498
02:41:49,080 --> 02:41:54,080
Were you on the road and on the road you
bumped into some good fucking mood 

3499
02:41:54,080 --> 02:41:54,150
hardcore member.
That's what it was called.

3500
02:41:54,300 --> 02:41:55,860
The George.
She's Caitlyn hardcore.

3501
02:41:55,920 --> 02:41:59,820
That's what does that Anthony Quinn 
playing pool.

3502
02:42:00,330 --> 02:42:01,680
Oh really?
Huh?

3503
02:42:02,090 --> 02:42:03,600
Never heard of it.
Who?

3504
02:42:03,750 --> 02:42:07,290
He was a pool hustler.
It comes up on wikipedia.

3505
02:42:07,390 --> 02:42:07,950
Oh,
okay.

3506
02:42:08,100 --> 02:42:13,100
I was just maybe a scene where he plays 
pool pool was just a giant pastime back 

3507
02:42:13,891 --> 02:42:18,891
then.
You know what the turn of the century 

3508
02:42:18,891 --> 02:42:18,891
is?
A thousand pool halls in New York City.

3509
02:42:19,730 --> 02:42:23,010
The 19th century,
like between like 1900 from the 1800.

3510
02:42:23,050 --> 02:42:24,570
Eighteenth Century.
Yeah.

3511
02:42:25,500 --> 02:42:30,500
I the fucking pool halls and in New York
City from the 19th to the 20th when it 

3512
02:42:30,500 --> 02:42:32,700
turned to the 19 hundreds to be the 
beginning of the century,

3513
02:42:32,940 --> 02:42:34,530
apparently there was a thousand pool 
halls.

3514
02:42:35,260 --> 02:42:37,740
It was so common,
like everybody played pool.

3515
02:42:37,830 --> 02:42:39,450
There was no TV.
Right?

3516
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:42,150
There's no live music and go see live 
music.

3517
02:42:42,310 --> 02:42:44,520
There's no records or records.
I mean,

3518
02:42:44,730 --> 02:42:47,460
I guess they had phonographs maybe a few
people had them,

3519
02:42:47,850 --> 02:42:52,850
but bachelor's especially like young men
would go and they would hang out with 

3520
02:42:52,850 --> 02:42:52,880
these pool halls.
It was like,

3521
02:42:52,881 --> 02:42:53,830
um,
that was there,

3522
02:42:53,960 --> 02:42:58,960
the lifestyle choice for the men who 
didn't go for the married with kids 

3523
02:42:58,960 --> 02:42:59,050
thing.
He didn't go for the marriage,

3524
02:42:59,051 --> 02:43:04,051
but there's like these people that felt 
like they were on the outside and they 

3525
02:43:04,051 --> 02:43:06,771
will all get together in these pool 
halls and they would just do what men 

3526
02:43:06,771 --> 02:43:07,170
wanted to really do.
They want to hang out late and drink and

3527
02:43:07,171 --> 02:43:12,171
gamble and do drugs and play cards.
And that's what these places always 

3528
02:43:12,171 --> 02:43:12,171
worked for.
These guys,

3529
02:43:12,171 --> 02:43:14,380
it's like a refuge from the regular 
life.

3530
02:43:14,740 --> 02:43:17,770
Like you can exist.
It might not be as profitable.

3531
02:43:17,771 --> 02:43:19,420
You might,
but at least it will be fun.

3532
02:43:19,870 --> 02:43:24,870
So they all just get together.
And then there was like the bachelor 

3533
02:43:24,870 --> 02:43:26,830
lifestyle of the early 20th century.
Crazy.

3534
02:43:26,840 --> 02:43:28,680
I gotta ask you something.
Are you covering next week?

3535
02:43:28,690 --> 02:43:30,790
Fight or know which one's next?
Degas.

3536
02:43:31,090 --> 02:43:31,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

3537
02:43:31,841 --> 02:43:34,230
The one,
the second Robbie lawler versus fuck.

3538
02:43:34,360 --> 02:43:37,000
He was getting the show.
And you were like,

3539
02:43:37,080 --> 02:43:37,980
no,
I'm not doing a show.

3540
02:43:37,981 --> 02:43:39,460
Okay.
Not doing a comedy show.

3541
02:43:39,720 --> 02:43:41,830
I T I can't do the caught theater that 
much.

3542
02:43:41,860 --> 02:43:43,450
It's a giant place.
I just,

3543
02:43:43,510 --> 02:43:47,800
we just sold it out like two weeks ago.
I can't to take time off.

3544
02:43:47,830 --> 02:43:48,380
Okay.
No I didn't.

3545
02:43:48,540 --> 02:43:53,540
That's why I asked you.
I never even mentioned they want to do 

3546
02:43:53,540 --> 02:43:53,540
it all the time,
but I don't think I need.

3547
02:43:53,540 --> 02:43:57,450
A lot of the people are transient,
but a lot of these people are the same 

3548
02:43:57,450 --> 02:43:57,450
people that keep coming over and over 
again.

3549
02:43:57,450 --> 02:44:00,550
Like Vegas is a such a hotspot now for 
standup and for,

3550
02:44:00,730 --> 02:44:01,790
for fights rather,
you know,

3551
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:06,840
people coming from everywhere.
So I feel like I gotta come up with at 

3552
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:09,760
least some new material I would even go 
because when they asked you to sound too

3553
02:44:09,761 --> 02:44:14,761
enthusiastic about something,
like maybe he's not even going into the 

3554
02:44:14,761 --> 02:44:14,761
fight.
And I'm like,

3555
02:44:14,761 --> 02:44:14,761
no,
listen,

3556
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:17,170
if you didn't talk to me about the 
fight,

3557
02:44:17,171 --> 02:44:20,500
if he didn't think I was a car,
I'll tell you right now.

3558
02:44:20,501 --> 02:44:21,960
It's a good card.
But uh,

3559
02:44:22,170 --> 02:44:25,330
the big fight of course is Carlos condit
versus Robbie lawler.

3560
02:44:25,331 --> 02:44:27,760
And one of the things is,
makes that flight so interesting is that

3561
02:44:28,030 --> 02:44:30,130
Robbie lawler is not known to take 
people down.

3562
02:44:30,640 --> 02:44:33,310
It's like he's taken out so few people 
in his life.

3563
02:44:33,460 --> 02:44:38,460
I don't think,
I can't think of a single submission 

3564
02:44:38,460 --> 02:44:38,460
that he's attempted.
I mean,

3565
02:44:38,460 --> 02:44:42,871
I'm sure he has attempted to submission.
I just can't recall one because all 

3566
02:44:42,871 --> 02:44:46,500
Robbie lawler's fight Robbie lawler 
trying to knock you into another 

3567
02:44:46,500 --> 02:44:47,680
dimension until the fights go.
The fights go ding.

3568
02:44:47,681 --> 02:44:49,420
Here he comes.
Good luck,

3569
02:44:49,690 --> 02:44:54,690
you know.
But the difference between Robbie and 

3570
02:44:54,690 --> 02:44:57,961
all the guys that Carlos has had 
problems with in the past is that those 

3571
02:44:57,961 --> 02:45:01,351
guys kept taking Carlos down.
Now I don't know if Robbie will 

3572
02:45:01,351 --> 02:45:04,081
incorporate that kind of strategy just 
because he knows it's been effective in 

3573
02:45:04,081 --> 02:45:05,530
the past.
GSP had good effect with Johny Hendricks

3574
02:45:05,830 --> 02:45:10,830
had a good result with it.
And the guys who managed to take Carlos 

3575
02:45:10,830 --> 02:45:12,610
down and smother him.
Those are guys who have some pretty good

3576
02:45:12,611 --> 02:45:14,770
success.
Robbie lawler has good.

3577
02:45:14,771 --> 02:45:19,771
Success is just smashing.
He's just a fucking awesome striking 

3578
02:45:19,771 --> 02:45:19,771
machine.

3579
02:45:19,771 --> 02:45:20,860
And such a tough guy.
He just,

3580
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:24,400
his mentality like the bulldog in him as
a 100 percent,

3581
02:45:24,430 --> 02:45:27,040
that guy has zero quit,
but neither does conduct.

3582
02:45:27,280 --> 02:45:32,280
We conduct,
got a little bit more sneaky ways to 

3583
02:45:32,280 --> 02:45:32,280
win.
Like he's really good at submission.

3584
02:45:32,280 --> 02:45:34,900
It's very good off of his back.
Very good at capitalizing on moments.

3585
02:45:35,110 --> 02:45:37,150
And he also,
he can kick box too.

3586
02:45:37,240 --> 02:45:39,880
And he's real slick.
He throws all kinds of crazy shit.

3587
02:45:39,990 --> 02:45:44,990
Step in elbows.
He does a lot of shit that you don't 

3588
02:45:44,990 --> 02:45:45,300
predict.
Fucking flying knees last time.

3589
02:45:45,940 --> 02:45:47,230
Think about it like he's a bad 
motherfucker.

3590
02:45:47,310 --> 02:45:49,310
I love.
I'm not saying that college.

3591
02:45:49,380 --> 02:45:54,380
And so I went,
but I tell you what I liked the most 

3592
02:45:54,380 --> 02:45:54,380
about Carlos condit.
This corner,

3593
02:45:54,380 --> 02:45:56,500
I don't really know who rob is trained 
is our data att,

3594
02:45:56,890 --> 02:46:01,650
but they have an excellent game plan 
when you fight for winkle,

3595
02:46:01,651 --> 02:46:02,800
John,
whatever.

3596
02:46:03,190 --> 02:46:08,190
You go in there with such a great.
And I didn't see it till the Holly Holm 

3597
02:46:08,190 --> 02:46:10,040
fight.
That's what I learned with game is to

3598
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:10,870
uh,
Holly Holm fight.

3599
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:15,880
Then I put together Jim John Jones 
fights and I basically thought the most 

3600
02:46:15,880 --> 02:46:19,751
about him against Diaz,
how he fought the as they always have a 

3601
02:46:19,751 --> 02:46:23,771
great game plan winkle John Smith,
and it's how good you stick to it and 

3602
02:46:23,841 --> 02:46:25,790
against Diaz.
This motherfucker stuck through it.

3603
02:46:25,791 --> 02:46:28,130
That's why you snuck out that victory.
You know,

3604
02:46:28,131 --> 02:46:29,750
if he sticks to the game plan,
whatever.

3605
02:46:29,751 --> 02:46:34,751
They always have a great game and they 
review it and review it and review it 

3606
02:46:34,751 --> 02:46:37,220
and review it and review it.
That's why Holly Holm did what she did.

3607
02:46:37,490 --> 02:46:40,700
Even when Rhonda went to Shit on her 
that she would usually get.

3608
02:46:41,030 --> 02:46:43,430
They knew her instincts.
They knew what A.

3609
02:46:43,431 --> 02:46:48,431
I forget what that word is.
They knew what she was going to do and 

3610
02:46:48,431 --> 02:46:48,431
they worked at and drilled and drilled 
it.

3611
02:46:48,431 --> 02:46:50,570
She kept her hips low.
All those little things.

3612
02:46:50,571 --> 02:46:51,440
I really don't know.

3613
02:46:51,650 --> 02:46:55,770
I just saw a.
The guy from George St Pierre Camp break

3614
02:46:55,840 --> 02:46:59,840
down the video and I thought about it as
a hobby and I go,

3615
02:46:59,841 --> 02:47:02,660
you know why she did that?
Because they went over it and they had a

3616
02:47:02,661 --> 02:47:06,620
game plan and they knew what her 
tendency was going to be and they worked

3617
02:47:06,621 --> 02:47:11,621
on the anti tendency and I thought back 
to his fight and I thought back to like 

3618
02:47:11,621 --> 02:47:13,640
maybe three or fucking John,
Jim,

3619
02:47:13,650 --> 02:47:14,870
John Jones,
Jim Jones,

3620
02:47:15,140 --> 02:47:19,070
John Jones fights and I said that.
That's what I like about that camp.

3621
02:47:19,130 --> 02:47:24,130
I've always liked that they really.
And that's why I'm not saying I like 

3622
02:47:24,130 --> 02:47:25,730
them,
but I'm saying in this particular file,

3623
02:47:25,731 --> 02:47:27,840
I'm just saying it's a very competitive 
fight.

3624
02:47:27,900 --> 02:47:28,150
No,
no,

3625
02:47:28,151 --> 02:47:28,370
no,
no.

3626
02:47:28,371 --> 02:47:30,230
It's a great competitive fire.
I would think.

3627
02:47:30,231 --> 02:47:33,500
The real questions are,
is Robbie gonna follow that game plan or

3628
02:47:33,501 --> 02:47:37,760
is he going to try to take Carlos down 
if he decides to try to take Carlos down

3629
02:47:37,761 --> 02:47:39,500
just to fuck with them,
just to mix it up.

3630
02:47:39,710 --> 02:47:42,260
It could be very interesting if they 
both just stand up.

3631
02:47:42,261 --> 02:47:44,930
It's going to be chaos.
It will be a crazy war I lost.

3632
02:47:44,931 --> 02:47:45,500
Give me.
Oh,

3633
02:47:45,501 --> 02:47:48,440
check this guy's fucking cry.
Guys have crazy power,

3634
02:47:48,441 --> 02:47:49,030
but I'm just.
I'm.

3635
02:47:49,180 --> 02:47:52,470
I wonder who's going to try to do 
something sneaky because Robbie,

3636
02:47:52,471 --> 02:47:55,220
he's like not a sneaky fighter.
He's super skillful,

3637
02:47:55,250 --> 02:47:56,990
very tough,
just aggressive,

3638
02:47:56,991 --> 02:48:01,991
but you know what's coming.
Whereas guys will mix things up and do 

3639
02:48:01,991 --> 02:48:04,100
things different and George St Pierre is
a perfect example.

3640
02:48:04,310 --> 02:48:09,310
He always had like a game plan.
It was always real sneaky mixing things 

3641
02:48:09,310 --> 02:48:10,040
up.
It was one of the most effective aspects

3642
02:48:10,041 --> 02:48:11,600
of his game.
He didn't know if it's going to take you

3643
02:48:11,601 --> 02:48:16,601
down or stand with you so you're always 
tense and always worried about what's 

3644
02:48:16,601 --> 02:48:16,601
coming.
And then he would shoot and be.

3645
02:48:16,601 --> 02:48:18,530
You'd be on your back and you've eaten 
elbow sandwiches.

3646
02:48:18,830 --> 02:48:23,830
So Robert is not like that.
Robbie is like a straightforward come 

3647
02:48:23,830 --> 02:48:23,830
towards you.
Smart.

3648
02:48:23,830 --> 02:48:26,960
Smart with his movement and his angles.
Very hard to take down but determined to

3649
02:48:26,961 --> 02:48:30,200
stand and smash it so Carlos won't have 
to worry.

3650
02:48:30,201 --> 02:48:33,690
Fucking hits hard though.
Fucking truck dogs.

3651
02:48:34,260 --> 02:48:35,450
That's a big part.
Well,

3652
02:48:35,451 --> 02:48:37,250
he's got so much confidence in his 
power.

3653
02:48:37,450 --> 02:48:42,450
You know,
if you watched that fight with Melvin 

3654
02:48:42,450 --> 02:48:42,450
manhoef,
he's getting his ass kicked.

3655
02:48:42,450 --> 02:48:45,551
Okay.
Melvin manhoef is kicking the shit out 

3656
02:48:45,551 --> 02:48:47,501
of his legs,
and Robbie lawler uncorked with all 

3657
02:48:47,501 --> 02:48:48,500
fucking bomb,
one punch,

3658
02:48:48,501 --> 02:48:52,280
one haymaker on the jaw,
and Melvin's whole body stiffens up like

3659
02:48:52,281 --> 02:48:57,281
he got tasered.
He falls to the ground and Robbie 

3660
02:48:57,281 --> 02:49:01,091
smashes him again when he's down and 
it's just one of the most brutal one 

3661
02:49:01,091 --> 02:49:01,520
shot,
knockout power,

3662
02:49:01,850 --> 02:49:04,820
not power punches in all of MMA and 
he's.

3663
02:49:04,860 --> 02:49:07,040
He's always trying to do that.
Every punch is trying to do.

3664
02:49:07,140 --> 02:49:08,010
It's just trying to just

3665
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:10,890
knock you in another dimension and he 
knows he can do it.

3666
02:49:10,980 --> 02:49:13,800
He's just got to hit you.
Just write and conduct can do it too.

3667
02:49:13,801 --> 02:49:14,730
Man.
Conduct knocks.

3668
02:49:14,731 --> 02:49:18,000
Dude's dead.
He wants to have the Dan Hardee fight.

3669
02:49:18,001 --> 02:49:23,001
When he caught damn nasty,
left hook or the stun gun fight that 

3670
02:49:23,001 --> 02:49:24,810
flying knee to the face or the Tiago 
Alvarez fight,

3671
02:49:24,811 --> 02:49:27,750
he smashed in with that step in elbow.
He's real tricky.

3672
02:49:27,870 --> 02:49:29,340
He's got a bunch of different ways to 
win.

3673
02:49:29,670 --> 02:49:34,670
He's tall,
he's long and it's real good off of his 

3674
02:49:34,670 --> 02:49:34,670
back.
Real sneaky off of his back.

3675
02:49:34,830 --> 02:49:36,810
Real good at attacking.
When he goes to the ground,

3676
02:49:36,811 --> 02:49:38,850
he's caught guys and arm bars and 
triangles.

3677
02:49:39,360 --> 02:49:40,320
There's no joke,
man.

3678
02:49:40,410 --> 02:49:42,420
It's no joke.
It's an interesting fight.

3679
02:49:43,170 --> 02:49:48,170
It's real interesting.
If Robbie decides to just only stand 

3680
02:49:48,170 --> 02:49:50,541
with them because of Cabo,
doesn't have to worry about the take 

3681
02:49:50,541 --> 02:49:51,170
down as much you get to see a lot more 
looseness to is,

3682
02:49:51,180 --> 02:49:52,410
uh,
striking game.

3683
02:49:52,990 --> 02:49:54,300
It's going to be an easy fight,
man.

3684
02:49:54,390 --> 02:49:56,910
I'm going to ask you something.
Are you going to go see this movie?

3685
02:49:56,911 --> 02:49:58,460
Concussion?
Fuck you.

3686
02:49:58,560 --> 02:50:01,410
You really want to see.
I think I'm going to want to say that.

3687
02:50:01,420 --> 02:50:03,090
You know,
where the big fight on that card is.

3688
02:50:03,091 --> 02:50:08,091
Here's the fact that no one's talking 
about Lorenz Larkin versus Albert to 

3689
02:50:08,091 --> 02:50:08,430
off.
Dude,

3690
02:50:08,460 --> 02:50:12,240
are you fucking kidding me?
That these guys are killers.

3691
02:50:12,241 --> 02:50:17,241
This is probably one of the most 
underrated fights in the 170 pound 

3692
02:50:17,371 --> 02:50:19,710
division right now.
This is a fight that everybody should be

3693
02:50:19,711 --> 02:50:24,711
talking about and if these guys had had 
like more like a on air fights,

3694
02:50:25,201 --> 02:50:27,650
like especially Larkin at one 70 and two
minute off,

3695
02:50:27,660 --> 02:50:31,680
just fought our bore Allen Joe Ban and 
just starched him.

3696
02:50:32,010 --> 02:50:37,010
He is nasty.
His fucking striking is so fluid and 

3697
02:50:37,201 --> 02:50:42,201
loose.
His boxing his hands and Larkin is a 

3698
02:50:42,201 --> 02:50:42,201
beast to.

3699
02:50:42,201 --> 02:50:44,040
That's a sick fight to really good 
fight.

3700
02:50:44,550 --> 02:50:46,920
That's a fight that people should be 
talking about.

3701
02:50:47,080 --> 02:50:52,080
Like a lot of people should be talking 
about this right now and for whatever 

3702
02:50:52,080 --> 02:50:52,080
reason it's just flown totally under the
radar.

3703
02:50:52,350 --> 02:50:54,150
Like I almost forgot it was even on the 
car.

3704
02:50:54,870 --> 02:50:58,230
This car is just a good car.
It's a great card,

3705
02:50:58,290 --> 02:51:01,260
but nobody's really.
I think the holidays,

3706
02:51:01,261 --> 02:51:03,150
they're confused.
I don't know what it is.

3707
02:51:03,810 --> 02:51:05,940
Nobody's really saying,
well this is the,

3708
02:51:06,540 --> 02:51:11,540
here's another good fight.
Brand down or take a or take us Gracie 

3709
02:51:11,540 --> 02:51:12,540
Jujitsu,
black belt and uh,

3710
02:51:12,600 --> 02:51:15,410
he's coming off a suspension for the 
ped.

3711
02:51:15,930 --> 02:51:20,930
He to,
for what these usually to juice you had 

3712
02:51:20,930 --> 02:51:23,070
a little bit of the steroids and the 
system.

3713
02:51:23,310 --> 02:51:26,010
No,
this gave him a little suspension.

3714
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:29,110
This Donald is Rory Macdonald.

3715
02:51:31,310 --> 02:51:33,040
Like,
oh,

3716
02:51:33,090 --> 02:51:35,400
Michael Mcdonald returns.
That's exciting.

3717
02:51:35,580 --> 02:51:38,640
He's been off for a long time.
A kid's been on for more than a year.

3718
02:51:38,641 --> 02:51:41,970
I believe he's fucking good.
That kid's good.

3719
02:51:42,120 --> 02:51:45,570
He's got nasty power in his hands too.
And he looks like a small,

3720
02:51:45,571 --> 02:51:47,910
slightly built guy.
But Mike,

3721
02:51:47,970 --> 02:51:48,510
God,
here.

3722
02:51:48,511 --> 02:51:52,030
It's hard.
But that Diego Brandao and um,

3723
02:51:52,140 --> 02:51:53,430
uh,
Brian Ortega fight.

3724
02:51:53,431 --> 02:51:55,500
That's a good fight.
I split real good fight.

3725
02:51:55,950 --> 02:52:00,950
I don't know why Ortega was doing 
anything when you might have had an 

3726
02:52:00,950 --> 02:52:01,080
injury is trying to recover from.
So a lot of these guys,

3727
02:52:01,081 --> 02:52:04,140
they get caught with steroids and what 
it is is um,

3728
02:52:05,020 --> 02:52:06,970
well a lot of these guys are just doing 
steroids,

3729
02:52:07,330 --> 02:52:12,330
but some of these guys,
they get injured and they try to get 

3730
02:52:12,330 --> 02:52:12,330
back in there.
So they take a chance to,

3731
02:52:12,330 --> 02:52:12,820
just a hope.
I don't get tested.

3732
02:52:12,850 --> 02:52:14,170
I'm going to try this for six weeks.

3733
02:52:14,460 --> 02:52:19,460
It'll be out of my system in six weeks,
but will ramp up my recovery by 30 

3734
02:52:19,460 --> 02:52:19,870
percent or more.
And so they take,

3735
02:52:19,871 --> 02:52:22,150
they take the chance.
I'm not giving them any excuses.

3736
02:52:22,570 --> 02:52:23,860
I don't know if that was the case with 
him,

3737
02:52:23,861 --> 02:52:26,530
but I just want to say with some people 
that is definitely the case.

3738
02:52:26,890 --> 02:52:29,530
Steroids.
Steroids are real tricky man because for

3739
02:52:29,531 --> 02:52:32,680
the longest time they just been able to 
use them whenever anything was injured,

3740
02:52:33,010 --> 02:52:35,590
you know,
either you used it all the time,

3741
02:52:35,620 --> 02:52:38,680
like some guys certainly did or you used
it when you had injuries,

3742
02:52:38,740 --> 02:52:40,570
which is like a very reasonable 
approach,

3743
02:52:41,560 --> 02:52:43,840
but you know,
we're just fine,

3744
02:52:43,841 --> 02:52:46,630
you know,
glace and Tbl just failed to tests.

3745
02:52:48,040 --> 02:52:49,150
Yeah.
One for.

3746
02:52:49,151 --> 02:52:54,151
I don't know what it was,
but one was for epo and if you look at 

3747
02:52:54,151 --> 02:52:56,800
gleason bow,
that guy might have the second best body

3748
02:52:56,801 --> 02:53:01,801
in the UFC next to fucking next to a 
Yoel Romero like glazing is ridiculously

3749
02:53:01,811 --> 02:53:03,190
shredded,
you know,

3750
02:53:04,330 --> 02:53:09,330
it's just the culture of people using 
banned substances.

3751
02:53:09,340 --> 02:53:12,820
They've been doing it for a long time.
I think these guys,

3752
02:53:12,830 --> 02:53:14,890
the UFC hired,
they're not fucking.

3753
02:53:14,900 --> 02:53:18,250
No really.
They're not fucking around.

3754
02:53:18,280 --> 02:53:20,770
They're gonna wake you up at 6:30
in the morning,

3755
02:53:21,040 --> 02:53:22,870
pee in the cup.
Joey Diaz like,

3756
02:53:22,871 --> 02:53:24,730
well at p now.
I can't show.

3757
02:53:24,731 --> 02:53:27,160
You can wait.
They don't leave your side.

3758
02:53:27,250 --> 02:53:28,570
They stay with you.
They Watch you pee,

3759
02:53:29,200 --> 02:53:31,720
they collect your shit and they do it a 
couple times.

3760
02:53:31,721 --> 02:53:33,730
They do it randomly.
Show up whenever they want.

3761
02:53:33,731 --> 02:53:35,770
If they have suspicions like of 
Novitsky,

3762
02:53:35,771 --> 02:53:37,630
sus suspect.
Something's wrong.

3763
02:53:38,050 --> 02:53:41,290
He thinks you're cheating.
They'll just be up your ass with scope.

3764
02:53:41,590 --> 02:53:46,590
Are they?
Are they testing you in competition mode

3765
02:53:46,870 --> 02:53:48,720
or off season?
They doing everything.

3766
02:53:48,780 --> 02:53:50,120
They do everything.
October.

3767
02:53:50,130 --> 02:53:52,130
It doesn't matter right now.
It might show up.

3768
02:53:53,050 --> 02:53:58,050
Well that's what happened with vandelay.
Vandelay did not have a fight scheduled 

3769
02:53:58,050 --> 02:53:58,050
and they just showed up to test him and 
he was like,

3770
02:53:58,050 --> 02:53:58,210
what?

3771
02:53:59,080 --> 02:54:04,080
And he just ran out the door,
but come trump vandelay has become 

3772
02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:08,251
Donald Trump of Brazil.
He just says who's he going to smack in 

3773
02:54:08,251 --> 02:54:08,251
the face yesterday?
Yeah.

3774
02:54:08,251 --> 02:54:13,220
Yes.
It's Kinda sad what Jesus is asked every

3775
02:54:16,450 --> 02:54:18,730
fucking month.
He says terrible for vandelay.

3776
02:54:19,150 --> 02:54:24,150
I have a very conflicted about this.
I feel terrible for vandelay because I 

3777
02:54:24,150 --> 02:54:28,621
was a vandelay Silva fan my whole life.
I think if I had to pick one fighter 

3778
02:54:28,621 --> 02:54:30,240
that I'm like my most favorite guy to 
watch fight,

3779
02:54:30,241 --> 02:54:34,600
it might be vandelay.
It's he's real close in his pride days,

3780
02:54:34,780 --> 02:54:39,780
he was just a fucking awesome spectacle.
He was amazing and when they banned him 

3781
02:54:41,081 --> 02:54:46,081
for life,
I think that broke his heart and when 

3782
02:54:46,081 --> 02:54:48,271
the UFC couldn't do anything about it 
because it's the Nevada state athletic 

3783
02:54:48,271 --> 02:54:49,030
commission,
he's going to fight in court so he feels

3784
02:54:49,031 --> 02:54:54,031
abandoned.
I don't know what the position is when 

3785
02:54:54,031 --> 02:54:55,480
everybody's position that I know as far 
as like trainers,

3786
02:54:56,260 --> 02:54:58,120
commentators,
fighters,

3787
02:54:58,210 --> 02:55:00,670
everyone across the board was like,
that's outrageous.

3788
02:55:00,710 --> 02:55:03,630
But the guy didn't even fail.
He didn't even fail drug tests.

3789
02:55:03,631 --> 02:55:06,020
You get a banned him for life.
That's so crazy.

3790
02:55:06,350 --> 02:55:09,560
And by all accounts vandelays one of the
nicest guys ever.

3791
02:55:09,690 --> 02:55:11,540
Like every time I met him he was like 
super friendly.

3792
02:55:11,840 --> 02:55:14,120
Like I don't know if the guy was doing 
something,

3793
02:55:14,121 --> 02:55:17,180
but I do know is there's a penalty if 
you got caught that penalty.

3794
02:55:17,280 --> 02:55:18,680
At the time it was only like nine 
months.

3795
02:55:19,010 --> 02:55:21,200
Like how are you going to take a guy 
that if he did get caught,

3796
02:55:21,260 --> 02:55:23,530
you get a nine month penalty and you're 
just,

3797
02:55:23,560 --> 02:55:25,850
you're saying forever.
You can't ever make money.

3798
02:55:26,030 --> 02:55:31,030
Like that's cruel,
that's a cruel way of conducting 

3799
02:55:31,030 --> 02:55:31,820
business.
Like you don't care about this guy,

3800
02:55:31,940 --> 02:55:34,160
this guy's a legend,
this sport,

3801
02:55:34,340 --> 02:55:39,340
like the reason why people come and pay 
all that money and go to see fights and 

3802
02:55:39,340 --> 02:55:39,340
use them.

3803
02:55:39,340 --> 02:55:42,590
Use their credit cards and buy beer and 
the whole revenue of the town.

3804
02:55:42,890 --> 02:55:47,890
It's because of the product and that 
product is fighting and out of those 

3805
02:55:47,890 --> 02:55:52,181
fighters,
vandelay was one of the most loved and 

3806
02:55:52,181 --> 02:55:53,760
one of the most respected and revered 
fighter.

3807
02:55:53,761 --> 02:55:58,761
So people would come to see him like his
very presence with generate income and 

3808
02:55:58,791 --> 02:56:03,791
for them to just not even take into 
account that this guy was a legend and 

3809
02:56:03,951 --> 02:56:06,890
just never failed before.
Ever.

3810
02:56:06,920 --> 02:56:11,920
Never failed a single drug test.
And then all of a sudden they cut his 

3811
02:56:11,920 --> 02:56:12,710
career out from under him.
He lost his mind,

3812
02:56:12,711 --> 02:56:12,790
right?

3813
02:56:12,820 --> 02:56:15,880
He made them nervous.
He made people nervous.

3814
02:56:16,840 --> 02:56:18,880
You know?
He was just making people nervous,

3815
02:56:18,881 --> 02:56:19,740
I think.
And he was,

3816
02:56:20,810 --> 02:56:22,730
he didn't do that until after he got 
band.

3817
02:56:23,300 --> 02:56:24,920
He was a company man.
Nah,

3818
02:56:24,921 --> 02:56:26,990
but wasn't the handling vandelay was a 
company,

3819
02:56:26,991 --> 02:56:27,290
man,

3820
02:56:27,520 --> 02:56:32,520
I'll fight anybody.
I know that something happened during 

3821
02:56:32,520 --> 02:56:34,540
the taping of that show.
I don't know.

3822
02:56:34,650 --> 02:56:37,510
It didn't need to do something like the 
coach somebody.

3823
02:56:37,511 --> 02:56:39,880
Yeah.
That's how it all during that.

3824
02:56:39,881 --> 02:56:44,881
He was a little bit about what happened.
So I didn't he do like the ultimate 

3825
02:56:44,881 --> 02:56:49,711
fighter?
I think so he coached somebody in doing 

3826
02:56:49,711 --> 02:56:50,940
that.
He was having moments and I'm like him,

3827
02:56:51,030 --> 02:56:53,020
I think he's fucking great.
You know,

3828
02:56:53,021 --> 02:56:58,021
I watched all of the old footage,
the fight he was involved in with 

3829
02:56:58,021 --> 02:56:58,060
fucking great.
But you don't.

3830
02:56:58,150 --> 02:56:59,950
Now when I read that yesterday,
I'm like,

3831
02:57:00,460 --> 02:57:05,460
you know Dana white sit and going.
This guy says something crazy every 

3832
02:57:05,460 --> 02:57:05,460
month.
If I was dating a white,

3833
02:57:05,460 --> 02:57:07,470
I,
I sleep with one eye open to.

3834
02:57:07,870 --> 02:57:10,600
Because vandelay Silva,
you never know what the fuck are.

3835
02:57:10,930 --> 02:57:13,510
You never know.
Know you didn't want some pink panther.

3836
02:57:13,511 --> 02:57:15,400
He told Keto to attack them.

3837
02:57:15,400 --> 02:57:20,170
No matter what he used to tell Kayla,
I want you to attack me no matter what,

3838
02:57:20,210 --> 02:57:25,210
attacked me.
And he would come home and look around 

3839
02:57:25,210 --> 02:57:26,770
Keto and he was going to every room.
He was fucking.

3840
02:57:27,100 --> 02:57:29,590
He would Keto it for 15 minutes and 
shit.

3841
02:57:29,950 --> 02:57:30,790
And they go,
Huh?

3842
02:57:31,380 --> 02:57:34,060
And then he'd have a bag of groceries.
He put the groceries down.

3843
02:57:34,360 --> 02:57:37,060
You get open up the refrigerator,
cato come out of the refrigerator,

3844
02:57:37,840 --> 02:57:40,720
grab him and shit.
Same thing with vandelay Silva,

3845
02:57:40,730 --> 02:57:44,350
like it looked like there was a report 
on the Y.

3846
02:57:44,350 --> 02:57:47,240
Vandelay Silva is in Las Vegas and 
nobody could find them randomly.

3847
02:57:47,270 --> 02:57:48,880
So when all of a sudden they're like 
waiting there.

3848
02:57:49,080 --> 02:57:51,090
Dana has got his bodyguard and another 
guy.

3849
02:57:51,091 --> 02:57:53,380
Everybody's got bodyguards and all of a 
sudden right there in the fight,

3850
02:57:53,710 --> 02:57:58,120
you see a fucking rope come down with 
vandelay with Vanda.

3851
02:57:58,121 --> 02:57:59,820
Like I've told you,
I you.

3852
02:58:02,690 --> 02:58:07,690
That's the shit.
Like he makes people nervous and he's 

3853
02:58:07,690 --> 02:58:12,051
real.
So he starts swinging somebody's diet 

3854
02:58:12,051 --> 02:58:12,051
when the hail it.
And that's what it was.

3855
02:58:13,720 --> 02:58:15,510
They had a real problem with that.
Oh yeah.

3856
02:58:15,511 --> 02:58:17,160
They had.
They had a real problem with that.

3857
02:58:17,270 --> 02:58:22,270
Well,
a lot of Brazilians got upset with them 

3858
02:58:22,270 --> 02:58:22,270
too,
with all the bizarre.

3859
02:58:22,270 --> 02:58:24,570
He'll turn on tough offer offers.
Cautionary tale to veteran fighters.

3860
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:25,140
Wow.

3861
02:58:26,250 --> 02:58:26,850
Interesting.

3862
02:58:27,320 --> 02:58:32,320
He got and I love him.
He's just while retail center and just 

3863
02:58:32,320 --> 02:58:33,670
wound him up to the point where he was 
ready to fight all the time.

3864
02:58:34,280 --> 02:58:36,230
Brazilians got upset with them.
You know,

3865
02:58:36,231 --> 02:58:38,330
they're like,
you're not representing us.

3866
02:58:38,331 --> 02:58:43,331
Right?
Like you're making us look like we're 

3867
02:58:43,331 --> 02:58:43,331
just thugs ready to fight for no reason.
But like,

3868
02:58:43,331 --> 02:58:45,470
for vandelays like this guy is making it
personal.

3869
02:58:45,471 --> 02:58:47,360
You're making it real.
I want to fucking kill him.

3870
02:58:47,361 --> 02:58:49,040
I want to kick his ass right now.
Fuck this.

3871
02:58:49,400 --> 02:58:54,400
You know,
vandelay like wanted to like stand his 

3872
02:58:54,400 --> 02:58:54,400
ground and established the whole thing 
was crazy.

3873
02:58:54,400 --> 02:58:56,180
But Charleston was hilarious in that.
Don't touch me.

3874
02:58:56,210 --> 02:58:56,870
Don't touch.
No,

3875
02:58:56,930 --> 02:59:01,930
don't get gleiss like keeps his hand up 
to his head and then eventually just 

3876
02:59:01,930 --> 02:59:01,930
decided to take him down.

3877
02:59:02,980 --> 02:59:04,490
Fuck it happens.

3878
02:59:05,300 --> 02:59:06,680
We're out of time.
Joey Diaz.

3879
