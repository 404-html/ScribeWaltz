1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,253
Oh Shit.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,870
I think fall off those pieces of
shit season when you don't Bro.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,661
Yeah,

4
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:09,440
they get too fancy or whatever.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,051
That's what we got.

6
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:10,884
Another one.

7
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,900
Oh Wow.

8
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,660
What would I already go?

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,983
Sorry.

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,333
Cheers sir.

11
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,240
Thank you.

12
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,960
My pleasure.

13
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,793
My pleasure.

14
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,000
Don't know.

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,710
We were talking about the different
kinds of comedians that there really are

16
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,980
like mean comedians there.

17
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,801
They're comedians.

18
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:30,450
They have a special skillset.

19
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,320
It's a different thing.

20
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,910
They have a special skillset.

21
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,220
In fact,

22
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,230
one of my closest friends,

23
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:35,064
bearded humor,

24
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,180
he's like,

25
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:36,630
um,

26
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,630
I would say if he was a standup comic he
would probably be be in my top five in

27
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:45,870
terms of creativity,

28
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,200
in terms of talking about things
in a moment and just all are funny.

29
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:51,871
You know,

30
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:53,490
the skill set for stand up now.

31
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:55,140
It used to be I started 25 years ago.

32
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:56,060
It used to be Tony,

33
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,880
where you proved yourself as a person
with any type of comedic integrity while I

34
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:03,870
was on stage standing flat footed in
front of an audience that you probably

35
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,460
don't want you to be funny
or no have have no idea.

36
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,293
You can be funny.

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,390
But these main,

38
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,240
these many people,

39
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,920
Photoshop,

40
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,050
especially because our
attention is so quick.

41
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:14,340
And so John to social media,

42
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,480
media people,

43
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:20,190
I don't even know if people are as
excited about stand up as they used to be.

44
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,880
A nail is excited about what's
going to be the newest thing.

45
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:24,630
What's gonna be,

46
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,860
what's gonna be the hardest photo?

47
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,840
The photo shop was gonna
be the hardest image.

48
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,000
Well,

49
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,160
that's the easiest to get,

50
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:29,401
right?

51
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:30,900
It's easier to get it on your phone.

52
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:31,890
You get those images,

53
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,710
the photoshops and the memes that
are funny that hit you immediately.

54
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:35,850
But I think right now,

55
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:36,091
I mean,

56
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:37,410
especially when you go to the store,

57
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:40,620
don't you think there's like more people
interested in standup now than ever?

58
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,640
Yeah,

59
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,001
but it's,

60
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:42,680
so we,

61
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,220
we in in a tricky place now.

62
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,300
People are interested in it,

63
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,770
but people are so,

64
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,580
they're more critical of
stand up now more than ever.

65
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,660
It used to be a time when you
could just say what you want it.

66
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,330
And people say that that
person was outspoken.

67
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,950
Outrageous.

68
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,830
But they were themselves.

69
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,660
But now you tell one joke,

70
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,490
uh,

71
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,330
one blogger,

72
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,430
one troller dissects your
jokes and print your jokes.

73
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,680
Don't do the setup,

74
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,370
don't do a call back,

75
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,720
don't do the tag.

76
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:13,500
And next thing you know,

77
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,580
you offended somebody.

78
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,210
Yeah.

79
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,100
But I think with a lot of events that
happen today that are happening now,

80
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,410
comedy's going to start taking it a
shift back to people on his voices.

81
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,341
I think so too.

82
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:31,341
I think there's a direct backlash to
like political correct thinking and the,

83
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,310
the type of policing that you're seeing.

84
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:35,561
You see,

85
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:39,960
you'd been pleased and I understand
polices and stuff in the Catholic church,

86
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,270
police stuff in a regular church,

87
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:45,770
but you go to a comedy club to police you,

88
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,633
we're in the wrong place.

89
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,290
And nine times out of 10 people
that go to a comedy show there,

90
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,510
walk out in protest,

91
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,200
their mindset was to protest
before they even went there.

92
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,540
They're just waiting for the
trigger word just to be like,

93
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:57,811
well,

94
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,340
I never,

95
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,170
they leave.

96
00:02:59,170 --> 00:02:59,531
Well,

97
00:02:59,531 --> 00:02:59,980
it's a way

98
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,360
to get a lot of attention,

99
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:01,631
you know,

100
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:02,380
being outraged.

101
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:02,801
It's something,

102
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,450
especially if you kind of have a point,

103
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,820
like if you could articulate that point,

104
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,071
right.

105
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:08,320
It's a great way to get attention.

106
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,590
The trollers and the people that,

107
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:10,990
yeah,

108
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,441
I mean there's a,

109
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,420
there's a giant market for that.

110
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:14,620
Like if you think of like a,

111
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:17,440
if you're a comic and you're a
famous comic and you're outspoken,

112
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:17,850
you know,

113
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,520
and someone could take your bit and
take it apart like they've done with

114
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:22,840
Chappelle when many times,

115
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:23,080
right?

116
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,171
Oh,

117
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:24,640
Chappelle owns it so much.

118
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,300
He owns it.

119
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,860
I was just with him and you I've never
seen to got it flips our sets over like

120
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,510
he just riding another five minute bit.

121
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,141
It's weird.

122
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:32,650
Right.

123
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,710
But the thing with the thing is now
I've watched some of his new stuff and

124
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:36,610
things he doing now.

125
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,830
He's going to lead the charge
for comedians having a voice.

126
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,490
I did a show with him at the store
recently and at the end of it he said,

127
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,140
comedians now more than ever,

128
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,700
you need to grab your balls because it's
our job to talk about the things that

129
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,520
are bad in his world and we
are the best people forward.

130
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,250
What's the last line of free speech?

131
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,020
It's the last real line of free speech
because you don't have a real boss,

132
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,440
right?

133
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,730
Like when you go onstage,

134
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,570
it's no one's,

135
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,450
no one gives you a
single word of direction,

136
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,140
right.

137
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,441
You know,

138
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:08,801
that's,

139
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,050
that's a very unusual place to be in,

140
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,630
in terms of entertainment
and something that reaches,

141
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,830
especially with someone like Dave millions
and millions and millions of people.

142
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,660
Every time he does a Netflix special,

143
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:21,550
every time somebody he does
anything that's filmed,

144
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:22,840
it's going to hit millions of people.

145
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,450
They have no one telling you what to do.

146
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,051
No one,

147
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:28,390
no one giving you when they
tried to tell you what to do,

148
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:30,970
you you've resisted in did
you do what you want to do?

149
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,920
He's a real comic.

150
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,720
He's a real that I've
been following you for a,

151
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,990
I've been a comedy store for years.

152
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:42,430
I'm always in the cut and I've seen you
do some material like how the fuck does

153
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:43,420
he get away with this

154
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,420
because he fucking owns it.

155
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,910
And that's totally
believe what I'm saying.

156
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:50,050
And a lot of ways,

157
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:52,810
like in other things it's obvious
that I don't really believe it,

158
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:55,150
but I'm saying it because I
think it's funny and opinion.

159
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,270
Tommy as for us,

160
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,730
as much as people are like,

161
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:58,564
oh I need that.

162
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,910
I think for Comedians is
therapeutic for us too.

163
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:01,601
Yeah,

164
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,970
there's 100% can you imagine a situation?

165
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,630
You have an argument with your wife or
somebody and you can't go on stage at

166
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:10,330
night just to talk about
how pissed off she made you.

167
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,703
That's how outlet.

168
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,220
Yeah.

169
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,800
So as much as people get stuff out of us,

170
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,320
when you come to a show,

171
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,740
we get now our psychiatric
exam right on spot.

172
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,491
You're also like,

173
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:23,230
you could complain about some Shit,

174
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,680
you can complain about someone saying
something or something happened or you

175
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:31,480
could turn it into a bit and you can get
hundreds of people just dying laughing.

176
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:31,990
All,

177
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,740
I have had some,

178
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,240
I had some conflicts online.

179
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,460
One of them with a bunch of vegans.

180
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,380
They so you entertain so much.

181
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:39,923
You're trying to be,

182
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,541
you're like,

183
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,390
I don't got time for that.

184
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:44,580
I'm not going to entertain me every once
while you just want to punch a troller

185
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,510
phages would read the comments.

186
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,960
That was the problem is occasionally you
read the comments are like Holy Shit,

187
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:52,950
like people just want
you dead because anyway,

188
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,960
I had to told the thing in my act
about a chasing down the Hashtag Vegan

189
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,993
cat,

190
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,260
somebody wrote to mean shit to me and
have this Hashtag Vegan cattles like what

191
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,100
the fuck is that?

192
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,030
I went there and there's a whole community
of people feed their cats vegetables

193
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:08,900
and,

194
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,350
but,

195
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,791
but in,

196
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:10,160
in,

197
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,630
in doing this and like
tracking this down and,

198
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,681
and like it,

199
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:14,540
it makes you realize like,

200
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:14,751
okay,

201
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:16,700
I got to write a bit about this
cause I could just get mad.

202
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,563
Easily writes,

203
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,500
it writes itself.

204
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,440
I could just get mad and be upset that
someone's being mean to me or I can turn

205
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:23,890
this shit into fuel or
you could just go fuck it.

206
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,880
Just destroy the whole Vegan community.

207
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:26,811
There's nothing,

208
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:27,441
it's not the feet.

209
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:28,670
It's nothing wrong with vegans.

210
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:31,610
Is has the same shit is every other group.

211
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,710
I don't really know too
many vegans aren't assholes,

212
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:34,040
Bro.

213
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,900
I know some vegans.

214
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:35,570
It aren't assholes.

215
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,140
I don't know.

216
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,711
Rich Roll.

217
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:37,580
He's a great guy.

218
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,481
John Joseph.

219
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,230
He's a great guy.

220
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,920
Neal Brennan.

221
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,521
He's a Vegan.

222
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:41,354
He's an asshole.

223
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,403
He's a little bit of it,

224
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,170
man.

225
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,170
Bill Brennan is a mother fucking prick.

226
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,390
What are you talking about man?

227
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,550
Telling people to turn into s when
the asshole is in body in him,

228
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,650
especially people wear
glasses because they were,

229
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,770
they have like million different frames.

230
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,550
Ooh,

231
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,280
that's when you add the next level of
being an asshole when you switched your

232
00:06:58,281 --> 00:06:59,114
glasses up.

233
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,730
But Neil Brennan is a Vegan
and he's one of those,

234
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,680
I don't think vegans should it be allowed
to go to a barbecue and complained.

235
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,400
They could play.

236
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,590
They all come to a fucking barbecue.

237
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,300
They got their panties.

238
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,863
They're upset.

239
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,250
If you've been cooking meat on a grill
that was designed to cook dead animals,

240
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,740
they'll sort of tend to get
up and they'd get upset.

241
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,720
So all vegans are assholes.

242
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,310
I'm sorry it's not all of them,

243
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,540
but I see what you're saying.

244
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,643
All the ones that I

245
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,820
did it because it cause when I make them,

246
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,480
but they made the transition.

247
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,970
It can't just become vegans.

248
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,833
They got,

249
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,420
they just got to let
you know I'm Vegan now.

250
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,313
It can wait.

251
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,183
You say dinner,

252
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,750
is it Vegan options?

253
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:42,861
It Vegan,

254
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:43,280
Vegan.

255
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,091
They just can't do it.

256
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:45,230
They got to make an announcement.

257
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,930
I think I let everybody know that I'm
a Vegan and now and I'm an asshole.

258
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,270
They think they're saving the world and
the worst is a Vegan that always gets

259
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:54,104
cold.

260
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,241
Yo,

261
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,500
whenever I see Neal Brennan Coffee,

262
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,150
whenever I see a car say,

263
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:03,830
so how's that big a live call?

264
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:05,990
You fucking flew habit ass motherfucker.

265
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,400
How he say that to Ian Edwards?

266
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,761
I'm like,

267
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:07,971
dude,

268
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:08,900
you are tired.

269
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,710
You're exhausted.

270
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,620
I take pictures of each and every time
we fly together and he falls asleep.

271
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,540
I take pictures of me and just sit there.

272
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,180
I'm like,

273
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,341
look,

274
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:18,530
you need some motherfucking protein
that they have be 12 and your diet.

275
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
Get a stake in your motherfucking daddy.

276
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,350
He said he would eat meat,

277
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:23,330
but he would only eat elk that I killed.

278
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,570
He said he would eat some uh,

279
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,341
some elk meets.

280
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:26,600
I'm going to cook him some elk meat.

281
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,411
We're going to,

282
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:28,244
we should film it.

283
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,980
It probably like bounce
around like super person.

284
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,950
Like he's been eating nothing but
lentils for the last 20 years.

285
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:34,890
Elk.

286
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,270
How of,

287
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,990
where does one go to even shoot an elk?

288
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,373
Utah.

289
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,680
Colorado has a lot of them there.

290
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:42,190
Some of them.

291
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:42,470
Twitter.

292
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,303
How do you,

293
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,830
how do you transport?

294
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,551
Is there a loss?

295
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:48,800
Can you transport your killer?

296
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,290
You have to break it down
wherever where you kill it.

297
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,010
You are,

298
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,910
you have to have,

299
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,773
uh,

300
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,643
first of all,

301
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,710
you have a tag

302
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,180
and then when you,

303
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,110
when you have a tag,

304
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,300
you're allowed to get a
certain kind of animal.

305
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:01,170
So say if it's like,

306
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:01,890
uh,

307
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,191
you have,

308
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:02,550
uh,

309
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,140
a buck deer tag,

310
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:05,880
that means you can kill a male deer.

311
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,200
And then once you kill it,

312
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,060
then you break it down and you either
bring it to a butcher shop and they turn

313
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:13,290
it into cuts for you.

314
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,540
Or You could do it
yourself and wrap it up,

315
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,830
but you have to have a tag.

316
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,330
You have to register that you killed
that animal and you have to keep that,

317
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,780
that,

318
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,531
that with you,

319
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:23,580
that paperwork with you.

320
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,960
So if you transport the,

321
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:28,410
the meat across state lines and some
game warden pulled you over and said,

322
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:29,310
you have a deer in your car.

323
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:29,831
I knew he asked her,

324
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:30,400
do sir?

325
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,730
And he's got to see that you
have the paperwork for it.

326
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,270
I don't want to sound racist and all,

327
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,670
but I don't know a black person that
could tell that story you just told about

328
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,320
killing butchering up to
transport in a dead end.

329
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:46,961
Yeah,

330
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:47,920
that's what you have to do.

331
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:48,650
That's how you do it.

332
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,930
You got to put them on ice.

333
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,591
I mean you have to,

334
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,390
you have an obligation
to try to save the meat.

335
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,970
You know when you have
an animal and it's down,

336
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,120
you want to get it into like a
packaged form as quick as possible.

337
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,030
You want to break it down.

338
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,010
Sometimes it's like,

339
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,260
dude,

340
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,720
sometimes people hang things.

341
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,580
They hang things in their garage

342
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,920
cold too.

343
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,590
So you wouldn't,

344
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,930
you mentioned were hanging on
I think about is Jesse's son.

345
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,410
Oh my God.

346
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:16,330
Talk about said No.

347
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:20,450
A whole bunch of people
back in one interview.

348
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,090
Crazy story itches.

349
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:23,120
It such a mess.

350
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:27,950
It's a mess and I think was really
awful about it because his story,

351
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:28,843
it was,

352
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:34,090
it was like good and bad of it to good
of it was when people thought that he was

353
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:38,240
violated and he was a
victim of a hate crime.

354
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,130
It wasn't just gay people.

355
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:42,860
There was a Russian to support him.

356
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:44,420
It was like thug dudes,

357
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,051
you know what I'm saying?

358
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:47,200
It was like some real motherfuckers.

359
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:47,751
Dell was like,

360
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:47,991
I mean,

361
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:49,040
I saw exhibit,

362
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,003
make a comment.

363
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:55,330
It was a community of people away from
the LBG community that thought it was

364
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:57,074
really fucked up.

365
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,943
Yeah.

366
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,960
And that's,

367
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,130
that was the beauty of the incident
because it kind of put people together.

368
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,410
But the fun thing about it was just a
lot and it's so fucking unfortunate.

369
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,250
It's so unfortunate that somebody would
play on people's emotions for or to

370
00:11:18,351 --> 00:11:19,850
benefit themselves.

371
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,330
It's,

372
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,163
it's awful.

373
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:21,910
Well,

374
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,900
there's a certain narcissism that exists
in show business that I think you and I

375
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:27,190
both know very well.

376
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:27,491
You know,

377
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:32,170
we've all seen it and thankfully the
people that seem to be the best for

378
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:32,681
whatever reason,

379
00:11:32,681 --> 00:11:33,160
they have the,

380
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,600
some of the best handles on it.

381
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,370
Like Dave doesn't show any of that.

382
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,940
Right.

383
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,730
But there's some people that do
and that narcissism is weird,

384
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:43,540
that that wanting it to be all about
them and then they'll do sneaky shit,

385
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,040
like fake and attack.

386
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,760
That's,

387
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,950
that's a symptom of that
same kind of thinking.

388
00:11:47,951 --> 00:11:48,640
It just,

389
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,040
it just got desperate and
went in some crazy way.

390
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,360
It was officer a reason,

391
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:54,190
because you have like when I first

392
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,023
went down,

393
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,340
you had people that normally
people that you look at,

394
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:57,641
okay,

395
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,290
that's my friend or whoever,

396
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,540
you started having side
eyes and that's just,

397
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,973
it's just,

398
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,240
it's so messed up.

399
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:08,320
And I think also as messed up as much
as people wrote for him when he thought

400
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:09,340
that it was an injustice,

401
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:10,120
everything,

402
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,350
nobody's really talking about it.

403
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,390
Nobody's addressing it.

404
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,030
Like,

405
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,270
you know,

406
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,021
this is our movement.

407
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:16,230
These are things that we were
trying to progress toward.

408
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,280
But this was an isolated incident
and just say how awful it was.

409
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,383
No.

410
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,230
You know,

411
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,380
the beautiful thing is that people are
way more tolerant than they ever have

412
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:27,070
been before.

413
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,140
They're also beautiful
things attack didn't happen.

414
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,440
Right?

415
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,410
So I don't have to think of one more
atrocious thing that people have done to

416
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:33,640
another person for no reason.

417
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,240
Right.

418
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,073
So that's good.

419
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,650
And it's also good that you get to see
where that kind of stuff heads where

420
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:41,440
you're always looking to be a victim to
the point where you realize there's like

421
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:43,870
some sort of currency and being a victim.

422
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,230
So people fake being a victim so they
can get all this fucking attention.

423
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,981
It's good for us.

424
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:51,410
It's good for us to see cause you see
that now next time a story comes around

425
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:53,870
that just a little fishy I'm guessing.

426
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,533
Exactly.

427
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,210
It's like the boy who cried wolf and
that's what's unfortunate about it because

428
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,380
anytime someone says that they were a
victim of such a heinous crime like that,

429
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,520
you want to believe him,

430
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,660
you want to believe them.

431
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,573
The mean they said,

432
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,190
then it makes you start
second guessing thing.

433
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:10,001
And that's another thing.

434
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:13,750
It was awful about the whole thing and
all the smoke he's getting right now and

435
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,560
he deserved,

436
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,630
because I've been tearing his ass up
on Instagram on everything he does.

437
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,750
He deserves every bit
he knows he deserves,

438
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,130
everybody knows he deserves it.

439
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:21,611
I read it.

440
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:26,611
I read a story once about this dude who
said that he punished his daughter by

441
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:29,110
making her sit in the backyard by a tree.

442
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,960
And then he went out there an
hour later and she was gone.

443
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,210
And the suspect that coyotes got her.

444
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,490
And I remember thinking that story going,

445
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:36,851
man,

446
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:38,830
that just does not sound real.

447
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,060
That does not sound real.

448
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:41,110
It just seems weird.

449
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,620
It's kind of left a baby in the
backyard and coyotes got it.

450
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:45,600
Like one was like a new,

451
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,850
like a black not walking
or anything like that.

452
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,341
Well,

453
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:49,270
he left the baby,

454
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,250
like to punish the baby
like a two year old.

455
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:51,990
Left it in the,

456
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,300
well,

457
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,800
it turns out he really didn't do that.

458
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:57,280
The kid died and he'd stuffed it
in some drainage ditch somewhere.

459
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,451
So this,

460
00:13:58,451 --> 00:13:58,690
uh,

461
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,460
I don't remember how the kid died.

462
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,810
What was the reason for it?

463
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:02,800
But it was one of those stories.

464
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:03,421
We hear this toy,

465
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:04,211
you like Jesus.

466
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,470
It doesn't sound real.

467
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,690
Sometimes stories don't sound real.

468
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,540
The next thing we're going to
be second guessing everything.

469
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,220
I hope not.

470
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,150
But when it first went down,

471
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:13,984
I thought it was a,

472
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,380
I've thought it was a situation where
Lee Daniels and Jesse sat down in a

473
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:22,270
writer's room and Lee Daniels,

474
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:22,491
Lee,

475
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:24,430
anybody got any ideas
for any new episodes?

476
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,380
It just like,

477
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:26,891
I got one.

478
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:27,724
Nobody's going to believe it.

479
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:27,881
Look,

480
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:28,930
I'm going to be hungry as shit,

481
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:29,764
right?

482
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,930
I'm going to go to subway
to get a 12 inch footlong.

483
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,320
Ellie Daniel was like,

484
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,343
I believe that

485
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,200
avenue,

486
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,240
that part I did with her,

487
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:41,610
the whole story elite.

488
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:41,870
Dan,

489
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,341
you said to them,

490
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,390
nobody's going to believe it.

491
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,740
Jesse got upset.

492
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,900
It told the totally Dez,

493
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:47,621
we'll see.

494
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:48,670
I'm going to shoot it myself,

495
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,220
and he walked to self into the
that whole scenario and it's just

496
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,240
awful.

497
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,620
That's entirely possible.

498
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,580
That's what it sounds like.

499
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:56,031
It sound like,

500
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:56,211
you know,

501
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:58,940
you're going to say now anybody
that was a fan of empire,

502
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:02,690
which I know a lot of people that's
listening work being very sarcastic when I

503
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:06,380
say that they're gonna be like second
guessed the storyline of so many of those

504
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:06,711
shows,

505
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:11,330
the storylines of everybody to whoever
said today we're done wrong or anything

506
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:12,000
you'd,

507
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,490
the awful thing about this is now people
are going to be ready and quick to just

508
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,170
second guess anything that you say.

509
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,010
Yeah,

510
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,330
that's,

511
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,060
that's a fact.

512
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,990
Until we can read each other's minds
till we could find out for sure that's

513
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:25,280
going to change the whole game.

514
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,230
The reason why his mind.

515
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,063
Yeah,

516
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,870
that's definitely gonna
eliminate a lot of street fights.

517
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,370
Most of them I made you talk about your,

518
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,190
your imminent danger sensors are going
to be 100% if you read somebody's mind.

519
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,143
Yeah.

520
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,960
Yeah.

521
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,100
I don't know if I want to do that.

522
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:40,970
I do.

523
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,110
I like him a secrets.

524
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:42,890
No Marlin.

525
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,940
I like having secrets too,

526
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:45,050
but I like going all in.

527
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,520
I think all in,

528
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,851
I think,

529
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:47,840
I think it's just inevitable.

530
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:50,360
We were talking about it in the last
podcast about there's something they're

531
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:53,210
going to be able to shoot into your
neck and what did he say the way he

532
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,044
described it,

533
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,210
like an injection that will take over
sort of the way it interacts with your

534
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:02,780
brain cells thread thread
itself in your brain house.

535
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,190
So literally like having,

536
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,270
I think we're going to have built in Wifi
Internet systems where we're connected

537
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,620
to each other's heads.

538
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,870
So this is what people request was like
a study they going to try out on people

539
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,470
or you can just go to your doctor and say,

540
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,090
shoot me with the brain shit.

541
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,090
I think eventually it's going to be
shooting with the brain shit first you got

542
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:21,470
to get it on a clinical trial,

543
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,570
going to be able to be like a heroin
addict and so do you get for that?

544
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:30,530
Like who is close to no brain cells and
shit and that's when we try it on it.

545
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,670
But what was that movie?

546
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:36,671
There was a movie where a dude got
shot and they put some chip in his back

547
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,841
upgrade.

548
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:38,520
That's great.

549
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,020
Yeah,

550
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,280
and it did that to him.

551
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,100
It turned up and he like at an
access to all the information.

552
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:44,140
He knew martial arts,

553
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:46,870
he knew how to move and everything
was happening like that.

554
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:50,900
He was a basically like a super
computer inside of a person that to do

555
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:51,734
everything,

556
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,660
just official intelligence
is right down the line.

557
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,130
If they're talking about this shit,

558
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:56,540
shooting it in your brain,

559
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,300
we're going to share a network.

560
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,510
We're all going to be on a network.

561
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:02,180
It's going to be a lot of white people
joining that effort because black people

562
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:03,110
don't fuck with needles,

563
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:03,944
Bro.

564
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,220
We don't do none of that
unless less is heroin.

565
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:09,150
We don't take out Bruh.

566
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,230
I'm telling you.

567
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,500
Oh,

568
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,241
say that.

569
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:11,871
But how many,

570
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:13,490
how many athletes are on steroids?

571
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:14,271
Yeah,

572
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:15,104
but that's a different,

573
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,160
that's a different animal.

574
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:20,080
I'm talking about the average black dude
that's strictly in Brownsville or watch

575
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,060
or something like that.

576
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:21,291
Yo,

577
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,490
I got this new brain shit.

578
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:23,600
We objected through a needle.

579
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,040
They go fuck you up.

580
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:25,940
They don't wanna hear that shit.

581
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,470
That's hilarious.

582
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,460
And that's probably true.

583
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,260
I mean how many people
are going to try that?

584
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,590
Like who's going to be the earliest
adopter or getting an a shot in your neck.

585
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,400
The lets you read everybody's mind
and then what are you going to do?

586
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,581
What?

587
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:38,690
It is an interesting thing.

588
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,300
It's going to fuck our job up man.

589
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,110
Because like half of what we do is say
shocking shit that people know is kind of

590
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:45,351
true.

591
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:47,630
But you can't believe you're
saying that people are always like,

592
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:50,070
oh not the old winter's Joe coming up.

593
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,630
You've got that.

594
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,281
If you could do that,

595
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,770
that'd be the ultimate fucking joke.

596
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:55,410
Gator right there.

597
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,400
Oh yeah.

598
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,990
Two guys walk in a bar.

599
00:17:57,991 --> 00:17:58,980
You don't get anything happening.

600
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,620
That's nothing.

601
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,920
I think I had to pass on it.

602
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,880
Keep it bro.

603
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,061
Yeah,

604
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:03,990
it's going to be weird.

605
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:04,860
When would you get it?

606
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,730
Like you wouldn't would,

607
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:07,190
you wouldn't be the first
comedian to have it.

608
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,053
Oh,

609
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,650
you almost want to be a
fool who doesn't have it.

610
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,880
If you want to be a comedian,

611
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,310
I want to watch other
motherfuckers do it first.

612
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:14,970
Yeah.

613
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:15,210
Oh,

614
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:15,930
I'll in the back.

615
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,720
But the problem is they're going
to fucking take over like finances,

616
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,730
like instantly they're gonna.

617
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,720
As soon as they upload their
brand and they're like,

618
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:22,890
I just couldn't get all this money.

619
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:25,290
I'm going to figure out a way to get all
this fucking money and then by the time

620
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,430
you shoot it into your head,

621
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,870
they've already got
the system locked down.

622
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,561
But see that's,

623
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:32,040
you have different level of people that
you hang out with because your level be

624
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:32,191
like,

625
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:34,230
well how would we get the
money but my level be like,

626
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:34,531
Yo,

627
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:35,450
we got this brace your,

628
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,290
how are we going to get
some ass off of his dog?

629
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,100
You can get it.

630
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,870
You'll be more read a broad mind.

631
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,430
You get all the asked you all of it.

632
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:41,611
Yeah.

633
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:42,061
You would know,

634
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:44,760
but then it wouldn't be fun
like half the fun is not known.

635
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,593
If somebody likes you,

636
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:45,960
right?

637
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,400
You don't know what's
going to happen here.

638
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:48,240
It's just going to work out.

639
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,760
What was that movie with
Mel Gibson or he could,

640
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:52,210
he could read women's minds what,

641
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,480
what women want and they remade it.

642
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:55,314
Right now it's coming out.

643
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,670
I've seen the billboard.

644
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,613
That's hilarious.

645
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,250
Henson and Tracy Morgan.

646
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,270
That's hilarious.

647
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,313
Tracy money.

648
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,570
I had a conversation with Mel
Gibson the other day on the phone.

649
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:05,070
It was one of the weirdest
things in my life.

650
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,331
I'm just happy to know.

651
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:08,280
I have friends that could say that.

652
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,410
So you have a lot of sentences.

653
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,253
My friends get you.

654
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,670
You know how you kill an elk.

655
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:15,810
All right,

656
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,040
here's drivetrain a bucket.

657
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:17,430
So it's,

658
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,610
so you got triggered what
time it then it's like,

659
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,630
oh it a yes,

660
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,760
so I'm on the phone with Mel Gibson.

661
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:25,890
The other day I was on the phone
with ray ray the other day.

662
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:26,680
Well,

663
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,260
I'd rather be on the front with Ray Ray.

664
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,750
It's not bad to talk to Mel Gibson.

665
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:31,200
It's just,

666
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,770
it's like,

667
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,603
okay,

668
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:33,781
he's a regular,

669
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:34,614
he's a dude.

670
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,603
He's a guy.

671
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,720
He's Mel Gibson,

672
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,560
Mel Gibson.

673
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,170
But he like fucking for
real like you talking to me.

674
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:40,711
Like for real.

675
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:42,000
It's a real conversation with Mel Gibson.

676
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,570
How would be,

677
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,970
that would be very interesting
and I've never run into him.

678
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,200
He's a super nice guy.

679
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,880
He did a podcast to talk about the
stem cell doctor that helped his dad.

680
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:51,510
Oh yeah.

681
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,430
He came on for Doctor Neil Riordan.

682
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:56,970
He's this guy in Dallas that
treats people down in Panama,

683
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:59,970
has got this radical stem cells
therapy that you can't get in America.

684
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:00,990
And it fixed.

685
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,910
Mel Gibson's dad was 92 and he was in
a wheelchair and now he's a hundred and

686
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:06,744
he's walking around.

687
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,240
He's an issue with stem cells
situation and America's,

688
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,060
I don't hear it too much the last time.

689
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,490
I'm not probably as knowledge as you are,

690
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,571
but wasn't,

691
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:18,030
I'm Christopher Reeves trying to um,

692
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,410
promote stem,

693
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,970
more stem cell research.

694
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,991
I'm sure he was.

695
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:22,141
Yeah.

696
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:25,080
He had that spinal cord injury
from a horse for horse accident.

697
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,670
He was doing those horse jumps.

698
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,463
Yeah,

699
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,450
South Park thing.

700
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,210
Remember,

701
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,043
I don't remember

702
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,020
eating dead babies to
like get the stem cells.

703
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,620
12 years is we'll take a bad turn

704
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,110
about rape on South Park.

705
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,400
They don't give a fuck.

706
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,360
They're the best.

707
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,100
They're also pushing the boundaries

708
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,933
like change.

709
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,850
They're the ones out there that
are promoting like ridiculous,

710
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,910
preposterous comedy that's
completely offensive but brilliant.

711
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,640
That's one of the things that
when we were doing Chappelle show,

712
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,301
the,

713
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:02,590
one of the things I appreciate more than
anything about this show was how it put

714
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,990
people of all races,

715
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,300
all backgrounds together to do the
thing that we all should have in common.

716
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,680
In as to laugh and also to not push the
button but touch on retro stuff without

717
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,950
having angry undertone.

718
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,920
And this was so fucked up about American.

719
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:23,410
Now whenever you talk about race,

720
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,540
it feels like one side,

721
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,130
somebody has to tint be tense.

722
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,420
You know what I'm saying is
never like a comfortable saves.

723
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,303
Never like,

724
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,630
and I know things are intense,

725
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:32,340
but we,

726
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,300
we have to be able to laugh first.

727
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:35,380
Once you get people to laugh,

728
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,790
you can talk about whatever you want
and then even if a person is not in

729
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,790
agreement or have the same
thoughts at the end of the day,

730
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,620
you should be able to respect that person.

731
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,960
And I think those same people
should be able to share a laugh.

732
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:47,800
Yeah.

733
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,870
And there was a a fun,

734
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:54,871
silly non aggressive quality to the way
you guys put together sketches that got

735
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:57,520
the point across and everybody laughed.

736
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,990
Everybody laughed at my joke to this.

737
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:00,750
To this day when I traveled,

738
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,633
I do my audiences.

739
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,960
It's interesting because of course you
would think I'm going to draw a certain

740
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:05,920
audience because I'm black,

741
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:06,221
which I,

742
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:06,790
you know,

743
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,990
which I am and I do,

744
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,921
but it's weird.

745
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:11,200
I could go to places in
a straight up like Dave,

746
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:11,990
column d,

747
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,330
The muddy boot motherfuckers,

748
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,621
you know what I'm saying?

749
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:16,120
Like the money book motherfuckers,

750
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:17,040
the money boost to jail,

751
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,160
they got John Deere.

752
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:18,730
Right.

753
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,181
You know what I'm saying?

754
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:21,010
They know all that elk
shit you talking about,

755
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,571
you know,

756
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:23,920
do John Deere is no,

757
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:24,754
all this shit.

758
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,350
They probably call her right now and say,

759
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:26,920
no,

760
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,171
Joe,

761
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:28,130
I think you got done wrong.

762
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,360
You got to cut the heart from,

763
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,041
you know,

764
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,660
you've got to go left or right.

765
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,590
You know what I'm saying?

766
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:37,120
And I've noticed I have those
people and then I have heard people,

767
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,990
but it's just interesting when you can
look out and this is what that showed it.

768
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:43,620
When you can look at an audience and
you say you have all of America there,

769
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,450
it was the best sketch comedy
show in the history of television,

770
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,140
I think.

771
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,910
I think in living color is very,

772
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:49,331
very,

773
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:50,350
very overlooked.

774
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:54,400
People forget how God Damn Day
was hilarious and groundbreaking.

775
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,750
It was bright in both of them.

776
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:57,220
Like it's wherever I go,

777
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:58,054
people always,

778
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,150
they always bring it up is
a big point in my career.

779
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,550
But I was like every,

780
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,020
I don't know ever happens
every 10 years or 15 years.

781
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:05,854
It comes a time where,

782
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,910
uh,

783
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,380
the audience wants something different.

784
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:08,860
Yeah.

785
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,910
That's sick shit.

786
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:10,744
Water down.

787
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,410
Same way when in living color.

788
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:14,110
Same Way with def comedy jam came out,

789
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:14,891
you know,

790
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:15,111
you,

791
00:23:15,111 --> 00:23:16,230
you didn't see a lot of uh,

792
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,190
a black standups on TV,

793
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,020
but they had this underground circuit.

794
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:20,854
It was bubbling.

795
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,630
That was bubbling and it was,

796
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,810
it was the right time when they pulled
out to the right time and live in color

797
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:26,620
comes around.

798
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,580
It's the right time.

799
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,120
Yeah.

800
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,420
Dave Chappelle show comes around.

801
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:30,910
It's the right time to Richard Show.

802
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,680
Even though that only lasted
three or four episode,

803
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,260
it was the right time and it
caught on it the right time.

804
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,250
Yeah.

805
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,000
Um,

806
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,260
in terms of like groundbreaking
sketch comedy shows though,

807
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,120
like that,

808
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,440
that,

809
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,170
that KKK bit where he had the,

810
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:45,430
uh,

811
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,370
the line,

812
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,263
let me tell you something.

813
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,510
Do you understand in
the history of sketch,

814
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,930
nobody has premiered a schedule and it
came off so hardcore the first night.

815
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,440
It's hot as hell.

816
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,420
She's hard as it comes.

817
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,860
When they ended that Shit,

818
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,360
when,

819
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,560
when we asked why,

820
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,280
why after all these years would you still,

821
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:09,801
so he was like,

822
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:12,680
because she's a nigger lover.

823
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,553
I was like,

824
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:15,590
I was like,

825
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,670
that was one of them.

826
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,660
That was one of the joints.

827
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,400
I'm like,

828
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,930
wake up everybody no more sleeping in bed.

829
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,200
No.

830
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,200
From that moment that this show was
going to be on the next level of shops.

831
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,040
Well was he was free.

832
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,671
It was,

833
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:33,050
there was so many when we did,

834
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:33,791
funny thing,

835
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:36,080
a lot of things I used to do,

836
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,690
I was a warm up comedian
for Chappelle show.

837
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,310
So whenever you saw
Chappelle show episode in,

838
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:43,580
have you noticed that?

839
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:45,140
Whenever I came on screen

840
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,000
and I'm not being cocky,

841
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:47,990
people who go nuts,

842
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:48,890
they be like,

843
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,401
oh shit.

844
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:53,120
And the reason was because I was a guy
that wanted the ordinance before Dave

845
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:53,660
came out.

846
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,320
Ah.

847
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,610
So I knew if I go gut the
room out at the beginning,

848
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,660
people don't,

849
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,230
people don't even,

850
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,501
they didn't,

851
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:01,580
nobody knew I was there anything.

852
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,790
If I ripped that at the beginning and
then when they see me on the screen,

853
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:05,624
it's going to be like,

854
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,943
it's going to be big.

855
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,190
Yeah.

856
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:08,460
Yeah.

857
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,650
And,

858
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,021
and,

859
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:09,811
and that show,

860
00:25:09,811 --> 00:25:10,081
man,

861
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:10,914
it was just like,

862
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,200
it was just loud.

863
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,260
A lot of things happen.

864
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:19,261
And show people like Rick James Sketch
the day we played that on a wrap arounds.

865
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:20,971
Man,

866
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:21,900
I should hit so hard.

867
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:22,734
I was like,

868
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,290
this shit is fucking crazy crazy.

869
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,540
One thing people don't know is that
comedy central did not like that sketch

870
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,240
comedy central.

871
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,050
Here's this funny kind of guessed.

872
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,630
It comes such didn't think Charlie Murphy.

873
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:39,910
Oh,

874
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,743
Swanee unit.

875
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,410
Okay.

876
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,640
And I watched,

877
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:48,170
we ran as shit sick just to let you
know the direction people think I wasn't

878
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,480
shit six times and every time,

879
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,940
every time you heard Dave say,

880
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,470
I'm Rick James Bitch,

881
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,310
it was guts.

882
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,580
It was gut side.

883
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,840
Yo went to the five figure,

884
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:01,674
say to the face,

885
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,470
what does lance I yet to sketch was
getting kids to spend it in school,

886
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,360
right?

887
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,830
He was born in school day teachers.

888
00:26:08,831 --> 00:26:09,860
What are the five things they say?

889
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,090
But I'm Rick James Bitch.

890
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,071
All right.

891
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,730
Tom used to spend four week,

892
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,320
you add Dave Chappelle.

893
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:16,220
Go to the fucking time.

894
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:19,100
Out Room is one of the most
iconic sketches of all time.

895
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:20,690
How wrong was comedy central?

896
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,231
I mean,

897
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:22,400
not just a little wrong.

898
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:22,850
A lot.

899
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:23,041
I'll,

900
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,220
I'll along the way
wrong all the way wrong.

901
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,930
Like almost like suicidal.

902
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,710
It was like,

903
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,130
hmm.

904
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,350
But then it goes to show
us like it goes to show,

905
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:32,600
you know how you have a
vision with something.

906
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:33,160
You see it.

907
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,410
Yeah.

908
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,520
Everybody may not see it.

909
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,280
Well that's the problem with
working with executives to right.

910
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:39,170
It's like their vision is
different than your vision.

911
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:39,271
They,

912
00:26:39,271 --> 00:26:42,080
you'd like to shape you in
a certain way and you know,

913
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:44,040
and I know Dave ran into problems with

914
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,760
them wanting them to change language
so they could get more sponsors.

915
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:48,660
Yeah.

916
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,493
I think,

917
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,700
I think that that wasn't an issue.

918
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,840
And to be quite honest,

919
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,510
I don't know exactly what happened.

920
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,980
Everything is speculation.

921
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,860
He never talked to him about,

922
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,940
never talked to him about it because the
reason why I never talked to him about

923
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:04,920
it because I didn't need
to talk to them about it.

924
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,993
You know what I'm saying?

925
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,570
Um,

926
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,070
that show was great for me.

927
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,920
It was a great Frey platform
for me and then out.

928
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,140
It was more important,

929
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:18,410
my friendship and how he felt away
from that was more important then.

930
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,490
So why did you leave?

931
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:20,970
Right?

932
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,803
Where'd you go?

933
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,080
First Time I saw him or
like as long as you okay.

934
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,690
Cause this to be scary for anybody.

935
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,521
One of your closest friends,

936
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:29,040
somebody you work with all of a
sudden just goes to another country.

937
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,873
You don't hear from him,

938
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,750
you know?

939
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,160
But when I first saw him after that,

940
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:34,860
like I was excited and I would just like,

941
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,670
you know,

942
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,170
with whatever it was,

943
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,560
we had a moment we may
history and people go on,

944
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:42,420
people going to do other
things and just keep it moving.

945
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,760
Well that show was really,

946
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,470
people always say Danielle,

947
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,150
if it wasn't for the Chapelle show,

948
00:27:48,151 --> 00:27:48,984
this and that.

949
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,360
Japan's show gave me a platform for
people to see what I've been doing for

950
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:55,194
years.

951
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:55,741
And you know,

952
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:58,500
you see talents in the club now
you see a muffin is good shit,

953
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,250
good shit.

954
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,440
But when they get the right
platform for the world series,

955
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:02,843
you know what I'm saying?

956
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,350
And that's kind of separate.

957
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,370
Um,

958
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,790
you see one person go from one level
to the next level who has the right

959
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,290
platform to showcase their talent.

960
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:11,790
And that show did that for me.

961
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,500
And with that said,

962
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,600
I gave that show everything every time
I had a second on camera every time,

963
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,570
like if you look at two and
a half years on this show,

964
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,080
if you had an editor breakdown
how many times I spoke,

965
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,500
it would probably be a
total of four minutes.

966
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,120
I'll get a word here,

967
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,740
I get a phrase here,

968
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,970
but I told myself whenever they turn out
motherfucking camera I'm going for it.

969
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:41,150
Like even if I'm not talking I'm going
to make my body so expressive that your

970
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:43,290
eyeball draws too with,

971
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,820
I remember Neal told me one time,

972
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,620
he said because I always,

973
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,070
I always get a mic cause I'll come up
with a line or something to throw in.

974
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,340
And we were doing a Rick James
Sketch and I didn't have a mic.

975
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,780
I was like Yo uh sound.

976
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,700
And Neil said you're not
going to get a mic bro.

977
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,373
I said I might,

978
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,693
I might.

979
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,440
I was like I might say something like
you're not going to say anything.

980
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:05,274
I was like fuck.

981
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,480
So I told myself,

982
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:11,210
well he smacks this motherfucker cause
if you look at that scene where he smacks

983
00:29:11,211 --> 00:29:11,340
me,

984
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:11,910
I said,

985
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,630
what the f?

986
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,171
I was like,

987
00:29:13,171 --> 00:29:13,470
um,

988
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,303
like uh,

989
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:14,710
uh,

990
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,000
uh,

991
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,530
Washington square park mime.

992
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,630
I pushed that.

993
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:23,100
I said what thought fuck I made my face.

994
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,570
He didn't give me a mic,

995
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,210
but I said what the fuck with my face.

996
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,700
And I always as people always as a matter
of showing up as the young actors and

997
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:33,534
stuff like that,

998
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,411
you talk to me,

999
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:35,071
what do you need to do?

1000
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:36,750
I was like with anything,

1001
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:40,350
the best thing to do is figure
out a way to get on a set.

1002
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,010
You get on a set,

1003
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:42,680
you,

1004
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,750
you do blackmail,

1005
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,793
you learn,

1006
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,000
you get opportunities,

1007
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,170
you got to be around it.

1008
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,560
You got to get a skill set.

1009
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,710
But when it's time to show up,

1010
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,270
you gotta show up.

1011
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,340
You have to show up
[inaudible] talk a lot of shit.

1012
00:29:56,341 --> 00:29:56,981
I want to do this out there.

1013
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:58,810
And then when I say action of,

1014
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:02,830
I'm saying when you show up and every
time I fucking say actually in situation

1015
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,873
you got to show up.

1016
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:04,811
Well,

1017
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:09,811
you have a great ability to express
yourself on stage and on TV.

1018
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:11,590
Some people feel uncomfortable,

1019
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,430
they just like to be cool while they're
telling the jokes or like some people

1020
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:16,480
have that style.

1021
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,950
Like your style is big,

1022
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,113
you know,

1023
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,050
I appreciate it.

1024
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:20,650
You know,

1025
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,760
you ever see Jim Brewer?

1026
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,750
Yeah,

1027
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,050
I saw Jim brewer like the first
time I saw him we were really young.

1028
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:26,650
Jim Brewer.

1029
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:26,831
Yeah,

1030
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:29,200
we were real young and my
manager Jason Steinburge says,

1031
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:29,580
what's up?

1032
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,413
Tell him I said what's up?

1033
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:30,940
No doubt.

1034
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,260
When I first saw brewer,

1035
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:34,210
he's so physical and I remember saying,

1036
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:35,820
I remember you get tired of watching him.

1037
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,091
I remember,

1038
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:38,020
I remember Jim Bro.

1039
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,590
Like Boston comedy club days.

1040
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,241
Yes.

1041
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:41,074
Yeah.

1042
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,940
I mean that's why we
use mentioned his name.

1043
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:43,570
I was like,

1044
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:43,841
yeah,

1045
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:44,910
which is Jim Borough.

1046
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:45,744
Are we speaking of?

1047
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,400
I mean you didn't today.

1048
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:49,031
Our Dad,

1049
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:50,200
Jim Breuer today.

1050
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,210
I mean he's still real energetic,

1051
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:54,800
but I'm telling you when
I tell you I used to,

1052
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,490
I saw him in his super prime,

1053
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,170
he was a murderer and he was,

1054
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,440
he destroyed,

1055
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,440
destroyed,

1056
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,210
like shut the light,

1057
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:06,490
like who's going to do
anything after that?

1058
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,930
You know who dude,

1059
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:09,610
I ain't shit fall on him once.

1060
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,370
One of the worst bombings in my entire
career I was headlining and Jim was and

1061
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,170
we were working together.

1062
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:15,840
We did.

1063
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,040
Millan is a prime spot
to fuck somebody up.

1064
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,950
That's a price.

1065
00:31:19,951 --> 00:31:24,430
By 2025 we had a good mc two so
the MC was like got the crowd,

1066
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:28,960
really pop it and then the middle came
on and jam chest rip the place up.

1067
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,820
He may have to apart and I was scared
and I had a blown out ACL at the time and

1068
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:34,930
I was wearing cavalry cheese.

1069
00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:36,910
I was wearing like a sexy pants.

1070
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:37,923
Oh Shit.

1071
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,590
I'm like too much information.

1072
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,310
Pause side with these stupid pants
and people were in the eighties man,

1073
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,350
like they were tied at the top
and they flared out a little.

1074
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:50,650
I'm not going to see
almost like a little bit.

1075
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,570
They're pathetic.

1076
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,110
That thought.

1077
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,310
Can't believe ever owned
them but they were in style.

1078
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,080
That's what I have that like that Bro.

1079
00:31:59,170 --> 00:31:59,680
Seriously.

1080
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,371
You're not sure.

1081
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:00,860
No Elk.

1082
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,260
A number of no you're not.

1083
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,900
I think mine were probably jeans.

1084
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,460
The jeans ones like that.

1085
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:08,590
Like see the far left
and the blue right there.

1086
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,010
Bam.

1087
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,221
Yeah,

1088
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:09,560
mine.

1089
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,393
That's awesome.

1090
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,373
Terrible.

1091
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,071
That's all.

1092
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:12,821
Can I wear those?

1093
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:16,120
And they have a straight face and then
I had like some nice dress up shirt on

1094
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:18,190
and I just ate plates of Shit.

1095
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,620
But it made me rethink my
whole act cause it was,

1096
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:23,770
it was so such a
humiliating bombing and I,

1097
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,850
cause I knew that they,

1098
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:26,230
the audience was right.

1099
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,250
I wasn't being funny.

1100
00:32:27,251 --> 00:32:28,840
I was nervous and scared about it.

1101
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:34,170
Those are the moments that make
you 100% like now I see a comedy.

1102
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:35,410
Like I go to some clubs,

1103
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:39,440
motherfuckers trying to do the lineup
kind of soft like well we can't that

1104
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:40,274
person

1105
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,280
in front of that person because they
won't be able to follow blah blah blah.

1106
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,310
But it should be a point like when I,

1107
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,420
when I started like the baddest
motherfuckers on the game,

1108
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:50,300
they went on stage and if
he was a new jack coming up,

1109
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,820
how are you going to have a
defining moment in comedy?

1110
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,320
You've got a go behind somebody.

1111
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,483
Anybody can do.

1112
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,930
If you've got a hot room,

1113
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,180
everybody's doing good but put that shit
behind where you got them off fucking

1114
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:01,881
like a bill.

1115
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:05,090
Burke comes in the room and
just goes and fucks it up.

1116
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,800
What do you stand up?

1117
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,641
We did,

1118
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:09,680
I did a tour with him bill.

1119
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:14,300
And it's so interesting cause I know
they have one of those podcasts where to

1120
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:14,751
theme is,

1121
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:16,620
have you ever had to
come behind a distillery?

1122
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:21,621
I forget to podcast it desert but crystal
if you ever had to come behind a story

1123
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:25,160
of coming behind someone that
just the most going on after them.

1124
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:30,380
And then Krista live I saw Kristala do
once he said me and that but when we were

1125
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:33,740
doing Chappelle should have to Chappelle
show after second year Chappelle show.

1126
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:38,420
We weren't really making a lot of money
on special cause the show still hadn't

1127
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:38,990
been proven.

1128
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,900
You know something you got to,

1129
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:41,991
if you've got a contract,

1130
00:33:41,991 --> 00:33:42,651
you've got contract.

1131
00:33:42,651 --> 00:33:47,651
That's it just so happened to cause the
show blew up before the contract was

1132
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:48,621
over.

1133
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:50,200
But that don't mean nobody's
going to renegotiate.

1134
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,670
So we had this popular,

1135
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,610
but we weren't making money.

1136
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,140
And um,

1137
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,580
I came with the idea that doing a tour
called the I'm rich bitch tour and at the

1138
00:33:58,581 --> 00:33:59,360
time,

1139
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,100
at the time Charlie was China,

1140
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,350
like anywhere he goes,

1141
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,320
at the time bill burr was um,

1142
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:07,843
uh,

1143
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,430
a headliner probably at
the time and be rooms,

1144
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:10,881
you know what I'm saying?

1145
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:12,050
And this is no disrespect to him,

1146
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,250
but he was on the come up.

1147
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:13,580
Right.

1148
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,600
But when you saw bill,

1149
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,730
you knew this muffled
was going to be next.

1150
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,593
You knew he was going,

1151
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,130
he was going to pop it.

1152
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,660
But we still wasn't getting no cash.

1153
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,780
Charlie had never told
jokes and I was like,

1154
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:25,160
how the fuck you around
all these communities?

1155
00:34:25,161 --> 00:34:26,000
You never been on stage.

1156
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,800
So I used to bully him.

1157
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:28,011
You know,

1158
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:29,240
he tough ass motherfucker,

1159
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,493
rest in peace.

1160
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,131
But I was like,

1161
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:31,311
yeah,

1162
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:32,260
you so tough motherfucker,

1163
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,800
but not with a microphone in your hand.

1164
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:38,750
And I bullied them so much that he
finally went on stage and Charlie,

1165
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:38,961
we,

1166
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:43,961
the tour was Charlie would mc and all
we needed him to do was 10 or 15 minutes

1167
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:45,321
at the time.

1168
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:48,020
Me and Charlie outside of the day
were to pop up people on the show.

1169
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,220
Bill bird had a couple of sketches
per bill burgeon pop off of the show.

1170
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,410
And I,

1171
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,200
and I was like,

1172
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:54,980
but if we're going to do this,

1173
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,210
let's have a fire show.

1174
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:56,751
You know what I mean?

1175
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:59,180
Don't we could put somebody's
weak in the middle.

1176
00:34:59,420 --> 00:34:59,721
I said,

1177
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:02,750
let's give them a show that
they won't ever forget.

1178
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,330
And Charlie used to come out to 10
or 15 minutes and I tell people that,

1179
00:35:07,331 --> 00:35:07,641
I was like,

1180
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:10,280
who's the toughest person to follow?

1181
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,550
But Charlie,

1182
00:35:11,551 --> 00:35:16,460
we got through 10 15 minutes and Bill
Burger would come out and do 20 to 25 and

1183
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:17,570
then I came behind bill,

1184
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,750
not one night for a year,

1185
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,873
a whole year.

1186
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,580
And Bill Burns a type of act.

1187
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,660
You have no days off.

1188
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,480
You have no or any of that,

1189
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,590
any,

1190
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,470
any little inkling of being off.

1191
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,281
You're just gonna hear.

1192
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:34,521
Yeah,

1193
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:35,300
I liked the show,

1194
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,140
but the white dude was
funny as a motherfucker,

1195
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,070
you know,

1196
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,903
and he,

1197
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,800
you could tell that time there,

1198
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:43,200
Bill Byrd was going to be a star,

1199
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,240
whether it would have
been movies or television,

1200
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:46,140
but as a stand up,

1201
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:46,921
you know,

1202
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:48,720
he was one pound for pound,

1203
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:49,650
one of the dope dopest to do it.

1204
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:50,531
And I tore,

1205
00:35:50,531 --> 00:35:51,450
went off a fucking year.

1206
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:52,290
We had a blast.

1207
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,101
Yeah.

1208
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:53,934
Bill's brilliant.

1209
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,541
Uh,

1210
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:55,950
I got to work with Charlie for,

1211
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,120
we did this maxim tour.

1212
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,500
We did like 22 dates.

1213
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,160
Me and him and John [inaudible],

1214
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,270
we traveled all over the place
when Charlie was starting to do it.

1215
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:03,511
It was,

1216
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:04,860
he kind of looks like two years in,

1217
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,270
he was two years in at the time.

1218
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,220
And you know what people judge,

1219
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:12,290
people understand how tough it is to
start as a comedian has a famous person as

1220
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:15,780
a comedian that you're basically,

1221
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:18,960
you're open miker does selling
out all across the country.

1222
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,363
And not only that,

1223
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,490
but you're Eddie Murphy's brother.

1224
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,040
So you got to fight past all of that shit,

1225
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:27,450
creating your own identity.

1226
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:28,561
You know what I'm saying?

1227
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,550
Like I could not imagine like
the heat he probably had.

1228
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,061
Yeah.

1229
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:33,481
But he,

1230
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:34,314
Eddie Murphy,

1231
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,370
Hey Eddie Murphy.

1232
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,410
And that's one of the things that when
Charlie passed that I really appreciated

1233
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,430
about what the Chappelle show did for him.

1234
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:43,140
Because when he passed away,

1235
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,560
nobody said Eddie Murphy's brother died.

1236
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,060
Right.

1237
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,020
Everybody's like Charlie
marries passed away.

1238
00:36:49,021 --> 00:36:51,870
So he had his true identity
and that was Charlie Murphy.

1239
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:52,861
Yeah.

1240
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:54,090
And that was one of his bits.

1241
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,580
You know,

1242
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:54,950
the,

1243
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,420
you know,

1244
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,010
is it,

1245
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,330
does it piss you off for people?

1246
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,030
[inaudible] he was,

1247
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,320
I'm just happy to not call me
Eddie Murphy's brother anymore.

1248
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:01,830
It's fun.

1249
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,521
I remember that.

1250
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:03,620
That was at that time.

1251
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,870
That was one that was a
joke and addressed it.

1252
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:08,280
And it just kept on and he,

1253
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:08,710
and,

1254
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,050
and he found himself,

1255
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,220
he got better,

1256
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,420
he got better.

1257
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,520
And then he carved his own lane.

1258
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,360
He called us,

1259
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,320
he carved his own lane.

1260
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,621
Did.

1261
00:37:16,621 --> 00:37:21,600
I was with Maury Smith used to be the
UFC heavyweight champion and a Ivan

1262
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:22,261
salivary,

1263
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:24,570
who's a guy who fought in the middleweight
division in the UFC and a couple

1264
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:28,900
other professional fighters at a
table with Charlie Murphy and trial.

1265
00:37:28,901 --> 00:37:32,430
He was explaining how none
of these motherfuckers know
how to do a Chicago Ridge

1266
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:35,160
hand karate shit.

1267
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:35,281
Oh,

1268
00:37:35,281 --> 00:37:36,114
he was big on it,

1269
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,251
but it,

1270
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:39,330
it's like Charlie Murphy's holding court,

1271
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:40,260
standing up.

1272
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:42,120
All these UFC fighters is taking it back.

1273
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,800
And Charlie Murphy was talking about
Ridge hand and it's a talking about,

1274
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,280
and he knew exactly
what he's talking about.

1275
00:37:46,281 --> 00:37:46,830
Right.

1276
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,090
He knew how to fight for sure.

1277
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,081
I've had,

1278
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:49,441
he had,

1279
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:49,770
he,

1280
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,990
he never knew martial arts.

1281
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:51,751
He was,

1282
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:52,350
um,

1283
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,100
he was big into it years ago.

1284
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,500
He used to be on at his body guy when
Eddie was like right at the height of his

1285
00:37:58,501 --> 00:37:59,250
stuff.

1286
00:37:59,250 --> 00:37:59,820
But um,

1287
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,890
Charlie was like martial arts,

1288
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,570
but everything that he said,

1289
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,470
it was the truth.

1290
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,200
You know what I mean?

1291
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,270
You didn't feel it like,

1292
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:06,871
oh,

1293
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:07,770
this dude is lying.

1294
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,221
Everything.

1295
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:11,990
He said it was true and one of the most
genuine people you want to meet man.

1296
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,620
Just a dope guy.

1297
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,221
Yeah,

1298
00:38:14,221 --> 00:38:15,690
his karate lineage,

1299
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:18,510
like he has some sort of a
connection to some of my friends.

1300
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,650
I'd have to ask them,

1301
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,570
but he was like a legit martial artists.

1302
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,160
I saw one video of him in a
martial arts contest and it was,

1303
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:27,331
I dunno,

1304
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:27,840
I dunno.

1305
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,361
I always tell him,

1306
00:38:28,361 --> 00:38:28,621
I was like,

1307
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:28,801
Yo,

1308
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:30,120
you knocked a 14 year old.

1309
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,103
Right?

1310
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,100
I don't know how he,

1311
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,660
I don't know if it was a
way to whatever it was,

1312
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,471
and I was like,

1313
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:34,711
Yo,

1314
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:36,130
that was a fucking kid you just

1315
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:36,491
knocked out.

1316
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:36,851
He was like,

1317
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:37,660
Yo,

1318
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,520
anybody in the rink or fucking get it?

1319
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,650
He was Yo.

1320
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,810
He was putting kids in with them.

1321
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,381
I don't know.

1322
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:45,130
He never,

1323
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:45,821
I saw the video.

1324
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:47,080
He never wanted me to talk about it.

1325
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:47,351
Whatever.

1326
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:48,670
I used to bust his balls about it.

1327
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,930
I could tell.

1328
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,450
I could tell being around him did
he legitimately knew how to fight?

1329
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,373
Yeah.

1330
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,090
The way he carries himself,

1331
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,210
he just had deco,

1332
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,341
that scowl.

1333
00:38:57,341 --> 00:39:00,700
He just looks like that buddy
was the one of the nicest guys,

1334
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:01,090
man.

1335
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:05,770
He was so fun to be around like in not
knowing him at all and then traveled with

1336
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:06,970
him for 22 days.

1337
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:12,420
We had so much fun man stories all just
laughing and silly and super friendly

1338
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:15,970
and all you wanted to do was man,

1339
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:16,804
just have a,

1340
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,733
have a good time.

1341
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,653
Yup.

1342
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,450
Yup.

1343
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:19,991
That's all.

1344
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,010
He wanted to talk shit,

1345
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,610
talk shit to me all the time and was
so happy to be able to do stand up.

1346
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,810
That was a big thing for him that
he could do stand up and travel.

1347
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,381
Always tell him.

1348
00:39:29,381 --> 00:39:30,220
I tell him all the time,

1349
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:30,520
I said,

1350
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,170
I birth your career dude.

1351
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,510
I bullied them into the shit.

1352
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,290
That's hilarious.

1353
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:35,741
But he did it.

1354
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:36,574
But you could tell,

1355
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,360
you could tell and I've been around
him and I'd been around his family

1356
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,240
and you could tell when he was growing up,

1357
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:45,480
he was the guy that always

1358
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,260
had the center of attention.

1359
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,580
You could just tell it.

1360
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:48,731
Yeah,

1361
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:51,460
you could tell he knows how
to hold a story as he does.

1362
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,161
That was a hard one.

1363
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:54,730
Man,

1364
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:55,061
when he,

1365
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:56,110
when he passed I was like,

1366
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,973
Whoa,

1367
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,420
I didn't know he was sick.

1368
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,710
I had no idea.

1369
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,011
You know,

1370
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:00,800
it's interesting

1371
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,800
that you say that because I
had to continue to do shows,

1372
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:10,130
do radio interviews and stuff and the
thing that people kept saying was he was

1373
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:10,964
so young,

1374
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,370
he was so young and he was young.

1375
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,473
But um,

1376
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:19,930
I don't believe that we're all
going to live to be 80 90 a hundred.

1377
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,273
You know,

1378
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,950
only thing we all
guaranteed when we're born,

1379
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,360
we have are born date.

1380
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:31,790
We have that dash in the middle and then
we have the end and it comes down to

1381
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:33,740
what the fuck do you do with your dash?

1382
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:34,950
How,

1383
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,110
how hard did you live?

1384
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,550
What did you go for?

1385
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,960
What inspires you?

1386
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,130
What motivates you?

1387
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,420
What did you do with that dash?

1388
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,840
Who the fuck gives a fuck about living
to a hundred and you don't have a

1389
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:45,674
passport.

1390
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,780
You haven't been outside of your block.

1391
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:48,800
You haven't been,

1392
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,060
you have never been on an airplane.

1393
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,320
What are you doing with your life?

1394
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:56,620
And I know Charlie from the point of
being in the navy to a band with his

1395
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,060
brother sent his brother,

1396
00:40:59,061 --> 00:41:00,710
reached certain hightest success,

1397
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,700
being interested about interested
in the business but you know,

1398
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:08,120
Kinda India but never really major mark.

1399
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:12,770
And then you get a platform that you
become and get your identity and shit.

1400
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,450
That's the dopest shit.

1401
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:15,820
Yes.

1402
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,660
It's one of the best kind of success
stories because it doesn't happen

1403
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:20,703
automatically

1404
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:21,630
notch.

1405
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,610
And I did it my way and it's like,

1406
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,181
you know,

1407
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,470
people say what they want to say,

1408
00:41:25,471 --> 00:41:28,200
but he put the work in that.

1409
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,760
I remember when,

1410
00:41:29,761 --> 00:41:30,540
um,

1411
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,970
I think the movie Eddie
did called Norbit right.

1412
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,100
And it came

1413
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,940
from a joke.

1414
00:41:34,941 --> 00:41:39,110
Charlie had just start over
that movie and I guess,

1415
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,600
I think him,

1416
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,430
and it was talking whatever and dense,

1417
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,260
you know how like,

1418
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:42,371
oh,

1419
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:43,040
that could be public,

1420
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,000
but it could be movie the
Charlie compensate say,

1421
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:46,600
Yo man,

1422
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,433
Hankins moved here.

1423
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:47,901
I said,

1424
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:48,520
what you believe?

1425
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,041
What you about to do?

1426
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:49,340
He said,

1427
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,550
I'm about to go lock myself in a hotel
for 30 days and write this motherfucker

1428
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,403
movie.

1429
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,640
They already gave me the money.

1430
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,250
You know what I'm saying?

1431
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,180
I'm talking about,

1432
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,470
I'm not talking about somebody,

1433
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,200
I've been writing this
movie for six months,

1434
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:03,561
whatever.

1435
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:08,561
It's like I'm about to go block everything
off and write this shit and no matter

1436
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:13,310
what anybody wanted to say
about how good the movie was,

1437
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:14,150
what the critics say,

1438
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:16,220
anybody in his business,

1439
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,380
if you can do something where it goes
from a thought and it goes to the paper

1440
00:42:21,381 --> 00:42:22,370
and you can execute it,

1441
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,720
how many motherfuckers can do that?

1442
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:24,831
They don't do that.

1443
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:26,900
People talk shit all
the motherfucking time,

1444
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:28,310
but then you say,

1445
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,050
how many have you got any can yo,

1446
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,063
I'm right movies,

1447
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,143
give me a script.

1448
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:32,481
Oh,

1449
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:32,930
hold on,

1450
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:33,321
hold on.

1451
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:35,630
I'm almost 30 pages in.

1452
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,813
You know what I'm saying?

1453
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,110
How many times you have that story?

1454
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,600
I got it.

1455
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,560
I got a great idea.

1456
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:43,131
All right,

1457
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:43,850
what is it?

1458
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:48,850
I remember I was just with Chappelle
show was popping and ludicrous gave me a

1459
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:50,280
lesson out of nowhere.

1460
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:52,250
I saw many airport and I was on Ashy,

1461
00:42:52,251 --> 00:42:53,450

1462
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,680

1463
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:55,730

1465

So neurohacker is called the amp.

1466
00:42:58,871 --> 00:42:59,211

1467
00:42:59,211 --> 00:43:01,010
Yo Luda right.

1468
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,341
He said,

1469
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:02,121
what's up Ashley?

1470
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:02,954
I said,

1471
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:03,823
I said Yo,

or something cause I just got,

1473
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:08,241

1474
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:09,870
You just add some
motherfucking getting again.

1475
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,520
I like it a month I get a movie
or something and he looked at me,

1476
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:13,761
Joe,

1477
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:14,690
it was so cold.

1478
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,310
He looked me right in my face.

1479
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,383
He said,

1480
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,570
we look at for people with
ideas and I looked to him like,

1481
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,730
well I have none.

1482
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:22,090
Right?

1483
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:22,923
So

1484
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,400
I guess this is this
conversation and it did.

1485
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:30,050
And when I'm telling you it was a lesson,

1486
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,130
how the fuck you want to ask with somebody
for something and you don't got shit

1487
00:43:34,131 --> 00:43:37,130
to give them but you're just a
lot of guys in the beginning.

1488
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,090
Think that's how you do it.

1489
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:38,953
That's how he do it.

1490
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,510
When I was on HBO is the wires,

1491
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,450
Motherfucker told me one time,

1492
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:42,110
he said,

1493
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:44,660
Yo d can you give me
the number to the wire?

1494
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,760
I think I could do this shit.

1495
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:53,020
This motherfucker what the day was like
a hotline from anybody from the streets.

1496
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,860
You ever thought about being an actor?

1497
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:58,280
You don't want to put those
10 years of getting rejected.

1498
00:43:58,281 --> 00:44:00,950
Just call this number and
we'll put you on the wire.

1499
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,800
You know what gets me about acting
though is when someone has never acted

1500
00:44:03,801 --> 00:44:04,101
before,

1501
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:05,120
it goes in there and kills it.

1502
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:06,951
You know,

1503
00:44:06,951 --> 00:44:09,560
like people who are like
athletes in particular,

1504
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,940
like rappers have done it.

1505
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:12,110
Like a lot of people have done it,

1506
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,063
but some people,

1507
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,940
but some people I believe that that,

1508
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,660
do you have natural talents?

1509
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,660
I think some people have
natural talents that person,

1510
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:25,220
like you have a person that's trained
that you have people that are natural and

1511
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:25,490
did it.

1512
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:26,420
If you think about it,

1513
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,493
acting as just,

1514
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,090
uh,

1515
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:28,923
it's uh,

1516
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,340
playing make believe so his playmate play

1517
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,500
make believe better.

1518
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,000
Is it a person that,

1519
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,620
is it a person that two foot of 12 years
they'd been studying and they went to

1520
00:44:39,621 --> 00:44:43,190
the school or as a motherfucker to get
a one store and that one character that

1521
00:44:43,191 --> 00:44:44,024
they can nail,

1522
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:44,860
right?

1523
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,520
Or is it a case of there's some people
that'll do stop stand up comedy for 30

1524
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:50,290
years and they're never
going to be that funny.

1525
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:54,910
Or Dave could do it for a year and
and kill you like Chapelle yeah,

1526
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:55,310
Oh yeah.

1527
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:55,720
He could kill.

1528
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,201
But he's gotten,

1529
00:44:56,201 --> 00:44:56,950
he doesn't do this.

1530
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:57,850
But you know what I'm saying?

1531
00:44:57,851 --> 00:45:00,580
Like there's some people that
there's is a whole different animal.

1532
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:01,960
And the reason why I say that,

1533
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:05,290
you're a great comic.

1534
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,870
I consider myself a great comic.

1535
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:09,010
You,

1536
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:10,150
I consider you a great comment.

1537
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,013
I appreciate it.

1538
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:11,990
And with that said,

1539
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:12,873
like out,

1540
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:18,030
we do have equals like as much as people
talk about somebody and you're smiling,

1541
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:18,610
you're like,

1542
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:19,840
I'm great to a motherfucker.

1543
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:20,951
But,

1544
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:21,401
and I was like,

1545
00:45:21,401 --> 00:45:21,551
and I,

1546
00:45:21,551 --> 00:45:24,100
one day I was watching
Dave on stage and I'm like,

1547
00:45:24,101 --> 00:45:25,750
what makes this motherfucker great?

1548
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,610
And I think in my opinion,

1549
00:45:27,611 --> 00:45:28,151
what makes them great?

1550
00:45:28,151 --> 00:45:28,930
Cause it's like,

1551
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:33,930
it's not too often that we have or
opportunity to have a Muhammad Ali moment.

1552
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,700
And when I say that me in a moment
where you got to throw everything on the

1553
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:40,120
table,

1554
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:40,960
it's your integrity,

1555
00:45:40,961 --> 00:45:42,010
your moral beliefs.

1556
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:43,690
What do I want to stand on,

1557
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,170
what do I want to stand for?

1558
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,610
And that's how some people get attached.

1559
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:48,661
You.

1560
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:51,220
Of course Muhammad Ali was the greatest,

1561
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:52,790
but it wasn't just in a boxing ring.

1562
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,490
We made them great is what he stood for.

1563
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,030
And I think when I look at Dave Chappelle
and looking to stand up and I look at

1564
00:45:58,031 --> 00:45:59,650
his career and I say what made them great?

1565
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,400
And that's,

1566
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,200
and that's a person just stem.

1567
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:07,201
They believe it's going to give you their
unfiltered truth and they own it and

1568
00:46:07,721 --> 00:46:09,910
don't compromise and
don't back down to anyone.

1569
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:11,040
Well he knows,

1570
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,360
he understands what's
important about standup,

1571
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,270
especially the type of
standup that he does.

1572
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,190
He asks me to voice full freedom.

1573
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:17,490
Yup.

1574
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,221
That's how you,

1575
00:46:18,221 --> 00:46:18,600
you asked,

1576
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,240
I've heard you say shit on stage.

1577
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,040
I'm like that why blood must can fight

1578
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:25,760
soon.

1579
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,593
White Dude.

1580
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,200
What the fuck just happened?

1581
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:31,050
That mother fucker got some Suplex,

1582
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:32,103
you know,

1583
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,020
he not have hit you like,

1584
00:46:34,021 --> 00:46:34,321
you know,

1585
00:46:34,321 --> 00:46:37,230
like in a certain part of your neck
and your whole shit is fucked up,

1586
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,263
you know?

1587
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,410
But those are people only.

1588
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:40,920
I Tony,

1589
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,480
I was telling Tony Hinchcliffe.

1590
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:42,891
Yeah,

1591
00:46:42,891 --> 00:46:43,170
yeah,

1592
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:43,950
yeah.

1593
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:45,540
He was Dornish joke about,

1594
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,050
uh,

1595
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,290
what's the current
motherfucking pedophile dude?

1596
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:49,891
Oh,

1597
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:51,030
Jared from subway.

1598
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,390
Not Jeffrey said we're just
going to chill with my chair now.

1599
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,590
He got another other
ton of Fab motherfucker.

1600
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:56,483
Another one,

1601
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:57,760
another one.

1602
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,710
He's a big actor,

1603
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,700
a big time actor.

1604
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:00,350
He,

1605
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,370
Oh,

1606
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,070
a spacey comes to back off at the bar.

1607
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:05,440
Dude.

1608
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,273
Kevin Spacey.

1609
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,473
Tawny.

1610
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,310
It's crazy debit.

1611
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:10,020
And you know,

1612
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,090
if for me that bit is so dope.

1613
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:12,690
I'm like this,

1614
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:13,680
I'm about to throw up.

1615
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:14,900
I'm like this,

1616
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:15,960
it's like this.

1617
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,190
He won't stop.

1618
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,433
Yes.

1619
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,340
And I told him,

1620
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,180
it was just,

1621
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:21,721
like I said,

1622
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:22,560
I don't know if there's a movement,

1623
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:25,900
but I felt like I was recruiting for gang.

1624
00:47:25,901 --> 00:47:26,730
Right.

1625
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:27,511
I saw him in the hallway.

1626
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:27,811
I was like,

1627
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:28,081
yeah,

1628
00:47:28,081 --> 00:47:30,030
me and Dave Chappelle

1629
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,690
of just talking about the brand
of comedy that you have doles it.

1630
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,001
You know what I'm saying?

1631
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:37,870
Like state stay true to it because
as much as people fuck with us,

1632
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:39,040
they don't want you to say this one.

1633
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,360
Say that again.

1634
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:41,990
It's a handful of mufflers on state.

1635
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:45,610
They're going to stay to their truth and
they're going to be rewarded for that

1636
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:48,070
shit because the other
shit is just bullshit,

1637
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:48,231
man.

1638
00:47:48,231 --> 00:47:48,500
I kind of,

1639
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,320
I tell you what,

1640
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,240
how to fucking,

1641
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,060
somebody's going to tell you what you
think is funny as a comedian and you know

1642
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:59,140
you don't even know if you think it's
funny while you're doing it on stage,

1643
00:47:59,141 --> 00:48:00,610
you're trying to make it funny.

1644
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,680
So there's a lot of
stuff that people here,

1645
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:03,740
maybe they only hear one.

1646
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:03,970
No,

1647
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:04,803
it's funny.

1648
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:05,101
You know what?

1649
00:48:05,101 --> 00:48:05,441
It's funny.

1650
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:06,071
You just don't know where.

1651
00:48:06,071 --> 00:48:10,250
The funny is sometimes the
rhythm of it because I know you,

1652
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,740
I don't know what your writing process,

1653
00:48:11,741 --> 00:48:12,700
but what's yours.

1654
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,833
Mine is like,

1655
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,390
it's a regular conversation.

1656
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:19,150
Like I have conversations
with friends all day.

1657
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,500
It's talking about pop.

1658
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:23,200
I mean topical stuff and it's like,

1659
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:23,651
you know,

1660
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:24,910
people with a sense of humor is like,

1661
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,740
you see the funny side,

1662
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,230
anything like the digestive smiley,

1663
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:30,360
it's Bill Cosby,

1664
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:30,720
small,

1665
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:30,940
let,

1666
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:31,511
whatever the fuck,

1667
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:33,070
whatever it is to all that shit.

1668
00:48:33,071 --> 00:48:33,940
You think I'm funny.

1669
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,630
So I never tried to sit
down and like I'm a right,

1670
00:48:36,631 --> 00:48:37,464
just perfect joke.

1671
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,140
It's usually something that comes into
casual conversation and it's those

1672
00:48:41,141 --> 00:48:41,531
moments,

1673
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:41,740
you know,

1674
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:42,521
you're talking to somebody,

1675
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:43,000
you'd be like,

1676
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,181
oh,

1677
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:44,014
that's funny.

1678
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,610
Usually that's where I started my writing.

1679
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:51,050
If something connects with me
like that and I just go and,

1680
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,370
and bill and believe in it and
just forced that shit to work.

1681
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:54,921
Yeah.

1682
00:48:54,921 --> 00:48:58,030
Once you get on that stage
with that idea and you're,

1683
00:48:58,031 --> 00:49:00,150
you're in that moment and
you have just like a member,

1684
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,043
you know,

1685
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,970
everybody understands the first
time you're trying a new bit.

1686
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,500
That's one of the weirdest moments ever.

1687
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,400
Everybody don't take the chance.

1688
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,570
That's one thing I say about you.

1689
00:49:07,571 --> 00:49:11,290
The Times I've watched you
that I called him pussy comics,

1690
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:11,531
you know,

1691
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,940
muffins is just do a set like,

1692
00:49:12,941 --> 00:49:13,360
Yo,

1693
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,860
I'm fucked somebody after this shit.

1694
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,310
Right.

1695
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:16,510
I'm just gonna stay on outside of here.

1696
00:49:16,511 --> 00:49:17,200
Good set.

1697
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:17,681
Good set.

1698
00:49:17,681 --> 00:49:18,430
Good set.

1699
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:19,210
Then you got the muffled.

1700
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:19,421
It's like,

1701
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:19,631
no.

1702
00:49:19,631 --> 00:49:20,800
That was the thought from last week.

1703
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:22,060
I got some more shit to talk about.

1704
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,580
I've got some more shit
and you and you push those.

1705
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,930
Push those bounds boundaries.

1706
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:27,070
A lot of people don't do that shit.

1707
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,130
You have to,

1708
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,500
it's the robot

1709
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,000
robot.

1710
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,340
Motherfuckers talk to me.

1711
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:33,950
Yo deal.

1712
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:35,180
Motherfuckers dead could.

1713
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:39,650
You could go to sleep and you wake
up and you can Indesit patty here.

1714
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:42,170
We know it worked by the fuck.

1715
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:44,090
Oh No.

1716
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,740
Here it goes by closer.

1717
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:50,570
You really want to test
about fucking nuts.

1718
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:56,230
Open with your punk has
closed a motherfucker over
which are closer and we'll

1719
00:49:56,481 --> 00:50:00,070
see how much stripped them other
motherfucker that flip that shit up too.

1720
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:00,530
Motherfucker.

1721
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,580
I call them the pumps.

1722
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,133
Yes.

1723
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,193
Peru.

1724
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,300
They,

1725
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,360
they got scared and then they got better.

1726
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:10,670
They got an act and then
they got scared again.

1727
00:50:10,671 --> 00:50:13,990
Never got rid of that act and then they
can stand for the right motherfucker.

1728
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,240
Be in a room is to have
a buffet like this.

1729
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:16,461
Oh,

1730
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:17,121
that's what you did,

1731
00:50:17,121 --> 00:50:17,690
Bro.

1732
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:18,291
Guess what I'm doing?

1733
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:19,970
I'm a flip a whole new set on your mother.

1734
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,440
Maybe I want him to do a set,

1735
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:26,830
maybe I'll just build some shit
from this one motherfucker.

1736
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:27,290
Right,

1737
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:27,800
right.

1738
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,220
Not

1739
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,170
that a riff like your pants so tight,

1740
00:50:30,171 --> 00:50:31,670
but pull something from him.

1741
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,650
If this turns into a whole shit,

1742
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:34,341
it didn't,

1743
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:35,760
that hard drive starts coming.

1744
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:40,370
Cause you know we got millions
of jokes that we never use.

1745
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,170
They just get stored on hard.

1746
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:42,920
Yes.

1747
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,930
They liked this people like
just is that your first time?

1748
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,150
What'd you come over debt 15 years ago.

1749
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:50,300
But the moment was now,

1750
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,190
yeah,

1751
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,030
it's going to go now,

1752
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:52,610
you know?

1753
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:53,410
Yeah.

1754
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:53,930
And that's it.

1755
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:54,763
I'm going to tell you,

1756
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:59,830
I've been doing it for 25 years and
after 25 years I can honestly slate say I

1757
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,970
feel like I get better every year.

1758
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:02,840
Me Too.

1759
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,860
And that's the same thing.

1760
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,350
That's somebody that's a appears.

1761
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:07,243
Yeah.

1762
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:07,581
Yeah,

1763
00:51:07,581 --> 00:51:08,001
me too.

1764
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:09,020
And I think that uh,

1765
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:12,470
I mean good sets and bad sets
when you working on new stuff.

1766
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:15,200
But I think overall when
I'm done after two years,

1767
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,510
each two years is better
than the two years before.

1768
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:18,320
But I'm ready to film.

1769
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:18,890
Yeah,

1770
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:20,180
I think that's what it's all about.

1771
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:20,571
It's it's,

1772
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:20,841
man,

1773
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:21,800
if you're not out there,

1774
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:25,970
if you're not out there creating a
type material where it's old too,

1775
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:30,050
like I'm gonna do another
special who are doing it for,

1776
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:31,970
here's the tricky part.

1777
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:33,823
I'm not on,

1778
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:36,410
I might be on Netflix radar,

1779
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,930
but I don't have a deal with them,

1780
00:51:38,931 --> 00:51:39,764
but

1781
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:41,663
I'm going to,

1782
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,180
not by myself,

1783
00:51:43,181 --> 00:51:44,014
but

1784
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Dave Chappelle has gave me a verbal
commitment that he's going to produce my

1785
00:51:51,301 --> 00:51:51,980
next special.

1786
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,160
Oh Dang.

1787
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,113
So

1788
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,580
with that said,

1789
00:51:58,530 --> 00:51:59,363
okay,

1790
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:00,990
I don't have a home,

1791
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:06,210
but I'm pretty sure
the lel been operating.

1792
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:07,561
We must stand up,

1793
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:08,430
you know when you're ready.

1794
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:09,361
You know what I'm saying?

1795
00:52:09,361 --> 00:52:11,010
It's like I just know it,

1796
00:52:11,011 --> 00:52:11,730
Bruh.

1797
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:12,250
I just not,

1798
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:17,250
I think the energy that I bring to a
special right now and then the energy that

1799
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,340
he would bring to produce the,

1800
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:20,183
for me,

1801
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:21,990
it would just fucking blow up.

1802
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,190
And this is not something like,

1803
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,080
I'm not calling Dave up everyday.

1804
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:25,710
Like,

1805
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,041
dude,

1806
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:26,880
you got to do my special.

1807
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,990
Every time I'd worked with him,

1808
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:28,860
he was like,

1809
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:29,930
you gotta let me do your best.

1810
00:52:29,931 --> 00:52:30,360
I'm like,

1811
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,560
let's go motherfucker.

1812
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:32,340
Yeah.

1813
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,320
So I feel good about dad.

1814
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:34,621
I don't,

1815
00:52:34,621 --> 00:52:35,370
I don't,

1816
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:39,030
I'm not saying that am I in
this place and that place.

1817
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:41,570
First thing I want to do is Dropbox.

1818
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,300
I put an hour of material
that when it plays,

1819
00:52:45,301 --> 00:52:46,290
it could change my life.

1820
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:48,420
I've been seeing you at the store,

1821
00:52:48,421 --> 00:52:48,691
man.

1822
00:52:48,691 --> 00:52:49,560
You're locked in.

1823
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:50,671
You can tell.

1824
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:51,091
You can tell.

1825
00:52:51,091 --> 00:52:52,350
You're doing a lot of sets.

1826
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,880
You got Yo Yo,

1827
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,410
I want reps.

1828
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,333
Yeah.

1829
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:57,690
What do you do?

1830
00:52:57,691 --> 00:52:59,840
Brock can fuck a stay home for reps.

1831
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:02,100
Reps can never catch a motherfucker off.

1832
00:53:02,101 --> 00:53:02,390
God.

1833
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:02,760
Yeah.

1834
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,890
I sometimes I'll do
four sets a night in La.

1835
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:05,903
I did,

1836
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,013
I did.

1837
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:08,400
And I was so proud of myself.

1838
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,290
I got six sets in,

1839
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:15,500
in a night in La and I was so fucking
happy because that's a normal night in New

1840
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,260
York.

1841
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,750
But in la you got to plan that shit.

1842
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,140
Yeah,

1843
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:19,790
you got to hit,

1844
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:20,810
you got to hit sunset.

1845
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:21,511
It's guy,

1846
00:53:21,511 --> 00:53:22,080
but I boom,

1847
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:22,770
I'm out.

1848
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,620
But you feel like you like

1849
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,070
you just can do whatever
you want cause then you,

1850
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:29,461
you know,

1851
00:53:29,461 --> 00:53:33,330
have you starting off with some new on
a first one you got four more botana

1852
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,193
night is over.

1853
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:35,520
You got them on the phone.

1854
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:36,510
Yes.

1855
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:38,640
When you do an reps the same night too,

1856
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:39,990
when you hit that third set,

1857
00:53:39,991 --> 00:53:43,740
it's almost like you're in this weird
flow state where there's no resistance

1858
00:53:43,741 --> 00:53:45,090
between you and the ideas.

1859
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:48,460
The material just comes out so loose and
then you'd know that they need got to

1860
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:51,270
do is one thing to have a joke.

1861
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:51,601
Anybody?

1862
00:53:51,601 --> 00:53:56,040
Can anybody mother write a joke and that's
why you see some of others you could.

1863
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:56,860
You just tell it.

1864
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,380
They dear good writer but it's nothing.

1865
00:53:58,381 --> 00:53:59,640
There's no performance of it.

1866
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,330
You'd have to say there's no performance
that brings you back to brewer.

1867
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,180
Brewer wasn't just like funny writing.

1868
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:08,640
He would get physically
stretches neck out.

1869
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:09,601
He would go,

1870
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:10,434
shit

1871
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:12,870
man,

1872
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,270
I'm telling you the Boston
comedy club years ago,

1873
00:54:15,271 --> 00:54:20,271
Barry Katz ran and owned it at a time and
that was the premiere it showcase bow.

1874
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:21,361
It's a great,

1875
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:21,630
that was,

1876
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:24,960
it was running neck and neck with the
comedy cellar kind of seller had the

1877
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:25,710
longest legs.

1878
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:25,881
You know,

1879
00:54:25,881 --> 00:54:28,170
it's the tortoise and the
hare has been forever,

1880
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,870
but this spot and it was,

1881
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,810
it was Jim brewer.

1882
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,380
It was on John Brown
and a brown brown boy.

1883
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,590
Johnny's Yay.

1884
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:36,330
Yeah,

1885
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:37,141
it was two guys.

1886
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:41,310
What is it and round boy something
fat Johnny and round boy.

1887
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:42,060
Yeah.

1888
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:42,893
They would demolish.

1889
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,430
Yup.

1890
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:45,263
Some idea.

1891
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,310
And then you had a motherfucker,

1892
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:47,940
17 year old round guy.

1893
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:48,810
Ciao.

1894
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:49,281
One of them.

1895
00:54:49,281 --> 00:54:50,790
I don't have any child in the round guy.

1896
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:51,990
They all dance now.

1897
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:52,680
Yeah,

1898
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,520
but I'll get the name.

1899
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:58,070
That was a time where comedy was on
fire and Jim Brewer would demolish it.

1900
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,730
Jay Moore used to demolish it.

1901
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,890
It was a great spot.

1902
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,680
Is One of those a real small clubs?

1903
00:55:04,681 --> 00:55:09,681
Like what did that seat could
probably 120 530 but it was like,

1904
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:10,591
it was,

1905
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:10,871
oh,

1906
00:55:10,871 --> 00:55:11,820
comedy club Vibe,

1907
00:55:11,821 --> 00:55:13,710
brick wall tightness.

1908
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:14,663
You know what I'm saying?

1909
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,310
That it reminds you of like
Red Johnny and the Round Guy,

1910
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:17,590
right?

1911
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:22,050
Is that it reminds you read Johnny.

1912
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,370
Look at Jon Stewart.

1913
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,360
Oh look at those guys.

1914
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:25,111
They were on TV.

1915
00:55:25,111 --> 00:55:25,950
They were a team.

1916
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,970
They got an a pants we had on earth

1917
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,393
more pathetic.

1918
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,320
You know who I used to follow at the
comedy store that that also changed my

1919
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:35,130
life.

1920
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:38,610
Martin Lawrence and the
nineties people for God.

1921
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,500
You came by him in the nineties Dude
Martin used to be the guy who had to go on

1922
00:55:43,501 --> 00:55:43,951
after him.

1923
00:55:43,951 --> 00:55:46,860
Mitzi used to always stick me on after
Martin and I know he was an animal that

1924
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:51,450
I'm going to tell you the first time I
saw Martin Lawrence and it was kind of

1925
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,433

1926
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:54,840
interested in comedy.

1927
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,040
I was in DC,

1928
00:55:56,041 --> 00:55:59,820
I was laying up in the bed
with this chick and HBO.

1929
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:00,743

00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,430
come on son the first sentence you like,

1968
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,420
like boom.

1969
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:00,960
Yeah.

1970
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,320
And he ripped that shit and if
you was fucking with that shit,

1971
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:05,280
it was like,

1972
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,080
it was everything then it was a good time.

1973
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:11,520
He was going on stage with leather
jumpsuits on and I was going on after him.

1974
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,930
It was devastating.

1975
00:57:12,931 --> 00:57:13,050
Well,

1976
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:13,441
you know,

1977
00:57:13,441 --> 00:57:15,240
you already got to make it or made it.

1978
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,630
If you're going on with Lebron jumpsuits
and you hadn't come the quality,

1979
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:21,990
it was just people were getting up in
droves by the time I would go on stage.

1980
00:57:21,991 --> 00:57:23,290
Everybody just wanted out of that.

1981
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:24,240
Was that that was,

1982
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:27,780
and this is what I will say that what
year was at 90 [inaudible] 94 that was,

1983
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,490
that was when that would,

1984
00:57:29,491 --> 00:57:32,160
that's when specials were really special.

1985
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:32,700
Right.

1986
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,660
There was that many of them.

1987
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:35,190
That's when it was,

1988
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:38,880
there wasn't that many of
you had one HBO was it?

1989
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,271
Yeah,

1990
00:57:39,271 --> 00:57:40,104
HBO was it.

1991
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:42,220
And that was one of those
specials where like,

1992
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,820
that's what I'm saying
with the next one I do,

1993
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,950
you never can plan stuff like that,

1994
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,380
but the image I want to have
as an ng at and that it's like,

1995
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:51,780
this is going to change my life.

1996
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:54,600
And that was the energy and
that's why you're so crazy.

1997
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:55,800
You could just fill it.

1998
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,780
I can imagine when he was done with that,

1999
00:57:58,740 --> 00:57:59,461
everybody can't have like,

2000
00:57:59,461 --> 00:57:59,640
just,

2001
00:57:59,640 --> 00:57:59,990
you know,

2002
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:01,110
your life is about to change,

2003
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,161
you know,

2004
00:58:02,161 --> 00:58:02,700
like,

2005
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,260
yeah.

2006
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:03,420
Uh,

2007
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,253
Bernie Mac.

2008
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:05,040
Yeah.

2009
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:05,940
With iron skid.

2010
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:06,774
You motherfuckers,

2011
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:07,820
yeah.

2012
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,840
I'm a story about that all time classic.

2013
00:58:09,841 --> 00:58:10,021
That's,

2014
00:58:10,021 --> 00:58:10,200
you know,

2015
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,033
the story behind it.

2016
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:11,790
Oh,

2017
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:12,750
the story behind it,

2018
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,610
it was just comic from DC
and a Bush burns butts.

2019
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:16,830
Brennan was the DC legend.

2020
00:58:16,831 --> 00:58:17,430
Right.

2021
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:18,360
He was a senior guy.

2022
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,840
If all of us in DC,

2023
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,870
Tony Woods and,

2024
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:22,590
and little Joe [inaudible],

2025
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:23,070
he was,

2026
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:23,730
he was,

2027
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:24,563
he was a senior guy.

2028
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,380
So a def jam.

2029
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,510
Nobody really knew what
def jam was going to be.

2030
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,010
It was just a new show.

2031
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,510
So Butch Burns had a set
and he didn't do well.

2032
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:37,170
He bombed like throwing chicken bones.

2033
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,150
I'm not saying this because it was black.

2034
00:58:39,151 --> 00:58:39,451
What he's,

2035
00:58:39,451 --> 00:58:42,210
I'm just saying they was
all bottles on a stage.

2036
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,310
They booed the shit out of this dude.

2037
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,410
Martin couldn't contain or audience.

2038
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:47,970
Martin couldn't do anything.

2039
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,900
It was just one of the things.

2040
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:51,480
You have us in a room just
so fucked up that kit.

2041
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:53,750
Anybody do anything and only
thing you were saying something.

2042
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:53,971
Okay,

2043
00:58:53,971 --> 00:58:54,804
just let me go on.

2044
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,070
So Butch Burns,

2045
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:57,420
Korea was dead.

2046
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,553
He's leaving,

2047
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,410
going up backstage and
he's talked to Bernie Mac.

2048
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:02,370
Bernie Mexican.

2049
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:02,641
Listen,

2050
00:59:02,641 --> 00:59:03,480
hold your head up.

2051
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:04,471
He said,

2052
00:59:04,471 --> 00:59:06,100
the sun's not shining on you today,

2053
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,320
but just shine on you again.

2054
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:08,250
Just hold your head up.

2055
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:09,083
You'll be all right.

2056
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:14,530
And next on deck with Bernie Mac with
the audience that was uncontrollable.

2057
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:17,221
Martin.

2058
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:17,940
Couldn't do anything.

2059
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,860
It was just like this Nigga you your own.

2060
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:20,703
Right.

2061
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:25,460
It was one of the moments and that's
where the phrase I ain't scared of you

2062
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:28,010
motherfuckers came from
that wasn't in his set.

2063
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,290
It was a real motherfucking comic.

2064
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:35,560
Figuring out what is going to do on his
moment and each had the head Kimmy here

2065
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:35,781
this,

2066
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:36,380
let me hear this.

2067
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,250
Give me some vile.

2068
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:38,700
I come in.

2069
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:38,960
Hello.

2070
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,370
Foolish.

2071
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:40,730
No give get it from the beginning.

2072
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:42,770
Hi.

2073
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:43,850
Scare you motherfucker.

2074
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:49,860
I'm telling daisy had a you motherfuckers.

2075
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:52,181
All right,

2076
00:59:52,181 --> 00:59:52,570
stop it.

2077
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:53,410
Can you pause for a second?

2078
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:56,130
But now this is after her mother fuckers.

2079
00:59:56,131 --> 00:59:57,540
Korea was buried.

2080
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,510
This is after a Bernie Mac.

2081
01:00:00,511 --> 01:00:03,150
He came on a year before that and I
think he thought he was dressed too.

2082
01:00:03,151 --> 01:00:03,610
Oh yeah,

2083
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:04,890
like a Steve Harvey suit on.

2084
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,810
So he wanted to appeal to
youth a little bit more.

2085
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:10,980
That's why he got the graffiti thing and
he's backstage saying like this could

2086
01:00:10,981 --> 01:00:14,940
change my career and other motherfuckers
career is over and this is a real

2087
01:00:14,941 --> 01:00:15,390
comedian.

2088
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:17,460
This first line out the motherfucking box.

2089
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:20,760
I scared of you mother fuckers,

2090
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,420
the motherfucking press.

2091
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:25,920
I ain't coming home.

2092
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,200
The foolishness and New York get dumb.

2093
01:00:28,201 --> 01:00:29,580
Y'All motherfucking woman look good.

2094
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:31,710
You're like a bigger big salads look good.

2095
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,690
But I love sex.

2096
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,790
I love Kinky Shit Phase Board.

2097
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:37,653
No.

2098
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:42,470
[inaudible]

2099
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:43,301
yeah,

2100
01:00:43,301 --> 01:00:46,390
we gotta get it kicked off
Youtube if we keep playing it.

2101
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:50,230
Oh the when we first get down,

2102
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,430
when he first stood up,

2103
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,360
well you don't want to say it.

2104
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:58,503
He called back.

2105
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:01,900
Oh Man.

2106
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,270
They'll use CD motion of it.

2107
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:04,840
Yeah.

2108
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,890
It was like damn,

2109
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:09,820
I'm good guarantee the energy he
wanted to have to rip was there.

2110
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:11,260
But the story,

2111
01:01:11,261 --> 01:01:12,030
the backstory,

2112
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:16,690
it being in that moment and at the end
of the day who are going to be prepared

2113
01:01:16,691 --> 01:01:17,770
for those moments though?

2114
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:20,380
Motherfuckers Matt Bill
for that Shit no more.

2115
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:21,490
You gotta do reps.

2116
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:22,450
You got to do Rep.

2117
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:23,420
They not bill Ford.

2118
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,510
They got a mother fucking
excuse for everything.

2119
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,190
You ever go to motherfucker room Roman.

2120
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:28,740
They'd be talking about
how's the crowd motherfucker.

2121
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:29,351
Fuck the crowd.

2122
01:01:29,351 --> 01:01:30,184
How are you?

2123
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:31,841
Oh,

2124
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:33,040
that was a crowd leave.

2125
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:33,430

01:01:39,491 --> 01:01:41,390
I'm just saying it's our fucking job.

2132
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:41,860
You're right.

2133
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:44,280
And I've heard you in your
podcast talk about no excuses.

2134
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:45,850
I feel like the things you said about,

2135
01:01:45,851 --> 01:01:46,051
no,

2136
01:01:46,051 --> 01:01:46,440
it's,

2137
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:46,660
yeah,

2138
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,520
it's easy to make an excuse,

2139
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:49,660
but in in a day,

2140
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:50,680
it's an excuse.

2141
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:51,220
Yeah.

2142
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,160
You got to excuses.

2143
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,240
You got a good excuse and you got to bags.

2144
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:54,491
Well,

2145
01:01:54,491 --> 01:01:54,971
you know what?

2146
01:01:54,971 --> 01:01:57,940
You could have an explanation
for failure with no excuse.

2147
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,020
What do you mean?

2148
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:01,600
We can talk about how you
failed and why you failed.

2149
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:04,000
Don't have an excuse because I fucked up.

2150
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:04,870
I came out,

2151
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,280
I was flat.

2152
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:07,780
I didn't turn up.

2153
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:09,980
I fucked up and don't,

2154
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:11,020
and don't use it.

2155
01:02:11,021 --> 01:02:11,520
Like I said,

2156
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,400
this crowd sucked.

2157
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,930
That's the wrong way to look at anytime.

2158
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:14,773
I at all.

2159
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,370
See how were they know
I ain't never seen it.

2160
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,230
How were you?

2161
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:19,530
Yeah,

2162
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:20,610
because guess what?

2163
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,860
We don't know what's going to happen,

2164
01:02:22,861 --> 01:02:23,430
bro.

2165
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:27,750
We don't know if that motherfucker in
the front row is taking about a funeral.

2166
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:29,101
We don't know that,

2167
01:02:29,101 --> 01:02:31,380
but it's our job to like,

2168
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:32,220
you know,

2169
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:35,400
kind of going back to me say
earlier in a sense we do.

2170
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:38,700
We read people's minds through their body.

2171
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:40,710
You can tell,

2172
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:42,300
you can watch show.

2173
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:42,750
You could be like,

2174
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:43,350
oh,

2175
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:46,590
she was so upset because I said
that you could just look at,

2176
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:47,520
you know,

2177
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,750
you know the pasture,

2178
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:51,150
you know everything and
then we feed off of that.

2179
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,160
But who's going to be
fucking ready for that?

2180
01:02:53,161 --> 01:02:56,730
And there's so many of these motherfuckers
that are taught and I'm not going

2181
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:56,911
off,

2182
01:02:56,911 --> 01:02:57,570
but it just,

2183
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:58,403
yeah,

2184
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:02,700
it's just frustrating when you see
motherfuckers out here making excuses.

2185
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:04,460
Well it's not

2186
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,010
good for everybody that's around them.

2187
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,360
That's also part of the problem.

2188
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:07,680
See,

2189
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,780
when a guy like you is around me or a,

2190
01:03:10,781 --> 01:03:11,111
you know,

2191
01:03:11,111 --> 01:03:14,140
a guy like Tony Hinchcliffe are
people who are just going forward,

2192
01:03:14,141 --> 01:03:15,460
who live in the comedy life.

2193
01:03:15,461 --> 01:03:16,121
Like you're writing,

2194
01:03:16,121 --> 01:03:17,260
you're always writing new material.

2195
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,580
That's an empowering.

2196
01:03:18,581 --> 01:03:19,480
I want to be around you.

2197
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:20,363
I want to talk

2198
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:21,780
and be around a motherfucker to talk.

2199
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:25,860
But I've been around motherfuckers
that got more bomb material.

2200
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:26,960
Did they got real material?

2201
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:27,940
You don't.

2202
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,490
Mother's got a old ditch do.

2203
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,760
I did my bomb set and they're
waiting to just one job,

2204
01:03:35,451 --> 01:03:35,971
don't work.

2205
01:03:35,971 --> 01:03:36,360
And be like,

2206
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,000
oh it didn't slide it
to their bomb is shit.

2207
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,530
They bomb set.

2208
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,880
Don't have no bomb material.

2209
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:43,110
Who the fuck writes material?

2210
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:46,740
The bomb man yo it case
they throw tomatoes.

2211
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:48,250
I got the old tomato bid,

2212
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,850
my uncle grew tomatoes back.

2213
01:03:50,851 --> 01:03:52,260
That's why they're staggered to hurt me.

2214
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:53,670
Go hard or go home.

2215
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:57,660
That's a ridiculous idea to have a set
that you do and the audience is shitty.

2216
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:58,980
I mean you do what you do.

2217
01:03:58,981 --> 01:03:59,581
You know we got,

2218
01:03:59,581 --> 01:04:00,540
you got search shit.

2219
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:03,360
If some come your way you could
bounce off but I'm talking of these

2220
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:04,670
motherfuckers is actually right

2221
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:10,170
in the event that I bomb
is going to go that way.

2222
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:12,820
They're bombing bits and I,

2223
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,940
I just like,

2224
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:19,770
I'm a person that just loves doing it,

2225
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:22,590
love getting better and I
tell people all the time,

2226
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:26,970
if you like any of the things that I've
done where there was the HBO is the wire

2227
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,350
Chappelle show on other stuff.

2228
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:31,110
If you come see me do stand up,

2229
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,510
you'll become a complete fan.

2230
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,900
Cause like you said earlier,

2231
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,240
that's the one thing that we control.

2232
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:38,310
We don't have to have an
audition for that shit.

2233
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,950
We don't have to motherfucking
get tested for it.

2234
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:41,971
You know what I'm saying?

2235
01:04:41,971 --> 01:04:42,120
Like,

2236
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:42,421
oh,

2237
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:43,320
I made it to this test.

2238
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:45,090
We don't have to fucking,

2239
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:49,620
we don't have to pitch it and you know
it's a good thing and they say fuck you

2240
01:04:49,621 --> 01:04:50,454
anyway.

2241
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,260
You can't fuck with us with that.

2242
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,030
It's like that's what we,

2243
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:57,090
our executive producer to producer,

2244
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,490
we the the line producer,

2245
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,410
we everything and you can't do it.

2246
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,940
It's us and a motherfucking
mic and at the end of the day,

2247
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,640
no matter what success I feel Joe,

2248
01:05:08,641 --> 01:05:10,770
we get with this whatever level,

2249
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:11,880
I mean your biggest shit,

2250
01:05:11,881 --> 01:05:12,061
you,

2251
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:12,894
you hit it.

2252
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:13,621
You know,

2253
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:15,660
whether it's TV or,

2254
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:16,070
or,

2255
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:16,400
or,

2256
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:16,710
or,

2257
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:17,470
or,

2258
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:18,400
or movies,

2259
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:24,300
nothing is going to ever be able to take
away from you being a flat month flat

2260
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:26,003
footed motherfucker.

2261
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:26,431
Thank you.

2262
01:05:26,431 --> 01:05:31,431
Stay in an audience and you've built your
standup name enough where for the most

2263
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:31,961
part,

2264
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:35,230
the rest of your life you'll be able to
create a good living off of your name.

2265
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,720
Off of doing stand up.

2266
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:37,651
Yeah.

2267
01:05:37,651 --> 01:05:38,490
Hollywood don't have to call.

2268
01:05:38,491 --> 01:05:39,120
Yeah,

2269
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:39,570
that's,

2270
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:40,500
that's big too,

2271
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:45,450
but if you respect what it is that you
have a relationship with those people,

2272
01:05:45,451 --> 01:05:46,500
you have to write for them.

2273
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:47,670
You have to work on your stuff.

2274
01:05:47,671 --> 01:05:48,750
You have to be diligent.

2275
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:49,710
You have to be,

2276
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:52,290
you have to have an ethic about it.

2277
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:52,680
Yeah.

2278
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:53,970
You don't want to rip anybody off.

2279
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,410
You want them to see a great show.

2280
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,310
You want to do your best.

2281
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:57,121
You want to do your best.

2282
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:57,690
I feel,

2283
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:58,390
and it's so weird.

2284
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,223
You know how we are.

2285
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,153
I could do it.

2286
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:01,780
I could do a show comedy clubs,

2287
01:06:01,781 --> 01:06:03,250
like 500 people,

2288
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:06,200
498

2289
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:06,771
motherfuckers.

2290
01:06:06,771 --> 01:06:11,771
I'm destroyed in his two motherfuckers
not filling me and I need to get their

2291
01:06:13,551 --> 01:06:14,420
undivided teach.

2292
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:15,263
It's like,

2293
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,120
I don't even hear the laughter.

2294
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:17,991
I'm like,

2295
01:06:17,991 --> 01:06:19,940
you don't fucking like me now.

2296
01:06:19,941 --> 01:06:20,990
Let's talk about it.

2297
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:21,220
You know,

2298
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,210
it was the worst at that was nick depalo.

2299
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:23,691
Well,

2300
01:06:23,691 --> 01:06:24,830
he'll go at one person,

2301
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,480
it's like this and the whole
rest of the audience is dying.

2302
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:29,611
It's,

2303
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:30,710
someone's given an the stink eye.

2304
01:06:30,711 --> 01:06:30,951
He's like,

2305
01:06:30,951 --> 01:06:32,360
what's your fucking problem?

2306
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:33,283
Yeah,

2307
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:33,921
you can't.

2308
01:06:33,921 --> 01:06:34,701
You just like that.

2309
01:06:34,701 --> 01:06:38,810
And it's like you and you won't stop
until that person doesn't have a problem

2310
01:06:38,811 --> 01:06:39,800
with a or a leaf.

2311
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:40,310
Yeah.

2312
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:41,150
That's a weird thing,

2313
01:06:41,151 --> 01:06:41,420
man.

2314
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:42,830
And just got undivided attention.

2315
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:44,960
You get committed to wanting
everybody to love you.

2316
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:45,471
You can't,

2317
01:06:45,471 --> 01:06:46,760
that's impossible.

2318
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:49,380
There's also people that will
fuck with you for extra attention.

2319
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,890
They want you to look at them,

2320
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,200
their arms crossed because
they need attention.

2321
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:57,650
They're the same people that protest
shit where it doesn't really necessarily

2322
01:06:57,651 --> 01:07:00,860
make sense to spend so much time and
effort thinking about these things.

2323
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:01,723
Let me tell you something.

2324
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,790
It's so funny you said
about protest because

2325
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:07,813
MMM,

2326
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:11,031
last couple of years,

2327
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:16,031
calm has been interesting as a lot of
people that are fans of Donald Trump.

2328
01:07:16,671 --> 01:07:19,160
A lot of people that aren't
fans of Donald Trump.

2329
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:24,760
And I think it's petty for you to be upset
with anybody because he chose to vote

2330
01:07:26,481 --> 01:07:28,070
for whoever they chose to vote for.

2331
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:29,630
I think it's stupid shit.

2332
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:34,760
But I will say this past election was
interesting in the sense that a lot of

2333
01:07:34,761 --> 01:07:35,600
people were upset.

2334
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:37,760
Black people were upset the last election.

2335
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:38,810
Uh,

2336
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:39,643
women were upset.

2337
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,610
Gay people were upset,

2338
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:43,070
but white people were really upset.

2339
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:48,530
Like white people were the angriest
and white people did not protest.

2340
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,930
They voted black people.

2341
01:07:50,931 --> 01:07:53,170
It's like black lives matter white people.

2342
01:07:53,171 --> 01:07:57,110
It's like we'll see about that in the
morning and when ever you hear someone

2343
01:07:57,111 --> 01:07:57,944
says,

2344
01:07:58,010 --> 01:07:59,150
we'll see about that in the morning.

2345
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:00,410
It's going to be some change.

2346
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,350
It's going to be some change.

2347
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:04,370
But comedy,

2348
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:11,380
I don't think kindness should be a
place where people exercise anger or be

2349
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:12,823
angry.

2350
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:15,020
How so?

2351
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:15,853
In what way?

2352
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,120
Good.

2353
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:17,953
Um,

2354
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:23,690
like p and met like when
Donald Trump first got elected,

2355
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:25,253
you know,

2356
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:26,410
personally like it,

2357
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:28,500
it was very interesting and
I seen a lot of comments.

2358
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,000
They can just go up there and be like,

2359
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:33,180
Fuck Donald Trump and just ah,

2360
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:34,853
you know,

2361
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:39,860
you could find a way to say
fuck Donald Trump or anybody.

2362
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:42,750
But it doesn't have to
be fueled with any anger.

2363
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:44,131
You know what I'm saying?

2364
01:08:44,131 --> 01:08:45,030
It doesn't have to be fueled.

2365
01:08:45,031 --> 01:08:45,511
Like fuck,

2366
01:08:45,511 --> 01:08:46,250
you'd be like this.

2367
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:46,681
Fuck them.

2368
01:08:46,681 --> 01:08:46,921
Okay.

2369
01:08:46,921 --> 01:08:47,370
Why,

2370
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:48,203
why do you say that?

2371
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,433
Why do you say fuck it?

2372
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:50,730
And then loud the reason.

2373
01:08:50,731 --> 01:08:55,731
But I just don't think that people should
be angry about how do you feel about

2374
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:58,710
just,

2375
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:01,070
I think it's fucked up
when politics meet people

2376
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:01,660
angry.

2377
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:02,210
It's part,

2378
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:06,400
it's contrary to what you were saying
was great about Chappelle show that the

2379
01:09:06,401 --> 01:09:08,170
comedy came without being angry,

2380
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,790
but it made great points,

2381
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:13,390
but even anybody on both
sides could laugh at it.

2382
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:14,170
Yeah.

2383
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:14,950
Yeah.

2384
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,630
The thing about Trump that's,

2385
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:17,500
it's interesting.

2386
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,740
It's like the job shouldn't exist.

2387
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:22,540
The job of web president.

2388
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:23,090
Yes,

2389
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:24,040
she shouldn't exist.

2390
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:29,310
It's a ridiculous idea to have 300
million people under the guidance of one.

2391
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:31,833
That's insane.

2392
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:32,823
And that one's,

2393
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:35,020
that one wins in a popularity contest.

2394
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:35,913
That's insane.

2395
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:36,340
Right?

2396
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,210
It's fucking insane.

2397
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:38,021
It doesn't make sense.

2398
01:09:38,021 --> 01:09:38,291
It was a,

2399
01:09:38,291 --> 01:09:42,250
it was a great idea back when they were
pilgrims and it was a small colony and

2400
01:09:42,251 --> 01:09:43,360
they just came over on a boat,

2401
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:43,811
forget it.

2402
01:09:43,811 --> 01:09:44,850
Forget about the rest of this shit.

2403
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,060
This is too many humans.

2404
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,190
So when you let a guy like that,

2405
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:50,770
like try to be president,

2406
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:51,010
no,

2407
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:51,221
he,

2408
01:09:51,221 --> 01:09:52,030
you're not going to be happy.

2409
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:52,863
No one's going to be happy,

2410
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:54,810
but you're not going to
be happy if anybody wins.

2411
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:55,500
It's,

2412
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:55,900
it's,

2413
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,770
it's untenable.

2414
01:09:56,771 --> 01:09:57,491
Look at Obama,

2415
01:09:57,491 --> 01:10:01,290
Obama aged like how many of years
in eight years he looked at Ge,

2416
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:04,810
he age 20 the altered to
Ted Danson effect once.

2417
01:10:04,811 --> 01:10:05,201
Cheers.

2418
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,370
Got Counseling you.

2419
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:09,310
Who the fuck is that?

2420
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:09,910
Yo,

2421
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:11,470
the first time you saw Ted desert,

2422
01:10:11,471 --> 01:10:14,290
I'm not talking about years
after chairs like after Fred,

2423
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,600
you're like God damn
stopped dying his hair.

2424
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:17,993
Yeah.

2425
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:18,760
Yeah man.

2426
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:22,990
Is there something about Trump before
that that people enjoyed that he was in a

2427
01:10:22,991 --> 01:10:26,060
lot of rap lyrics meant
he was like the ultimate,

2428
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:30,180
like people would probably still
be if he was a is to have resident,

2429
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:30,700
right.

2430
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:31,480
It'd be different.

2431
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,470
He still popular.

2432
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:33,350
People wrapped up.

2433
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:34,520
They liked the lifestyle.

2434
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,460
But the thing was to just my thoughts.

2435
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,890
The thing was because you thought

2436
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:42,440
you knew a person,

2437
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:43,910
you thought you norm.

2438
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:45,380
And even when he got elected,

2439
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:47,720
I think a lot of people
thought they knew him,

2440
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:48,890
right?

2441
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:49,940
They thought they knew him.

2442
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:50,990
They thought the image.

2443
01:10:50,991 --> 01:10:52,640
Like you're going to be a billion guy.

2444
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:53,750
Billion dollar playboy.

2445
01:10:53,751 --> 01:10:54,470
Gaf ever.

2446
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:55,730
But you thought you knew him,

2447
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,160
but then when you got to know him,

2448
01:10:58,610 --> 01:10:59,311
you start to think,

2449
01:10:59,311 --> 01:10:59,421
well,

2450
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,990
maybe I didn't know him when
you got to see him as president,

2451
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:09,720
I don't think even as an even as
much as even how he got elected,

2452
01:11:10,071 --> 01:11:10,904
people were upset about it,

2453
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,320
but I think a lot of people,

2454
01:11:12,321 --> 01:11:13,050
somebody was like,

2455
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:13,980
you know where it may be.

2456
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:19,560
All of their shit was just to get elected.

2457
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:25,260
Maybe that energy was to get elected and
if that was the case that he'd mastered

2458
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:25,381
it,

2459
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:28,290
he'd mastered how to get
connect with his base.

2460
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,650
He Massad met.

2461
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,770
He mastered how to get,

2462
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,850
not everybody the fuck would you
put just the right amount of people?

2463
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:36,510
Yeah,

2464
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:37,410
it looked the numbers.

2465
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:38,850
It wasn't about them.

2466
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,500
It was a popularity contest,

2467
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:41,401
but it's also new.

2468
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:44,010
Like these are the people that
got hit and he figured that out.

2469
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:44,640
What the something?

2470
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,570
At some point Joe,

2471
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:46,643
people were like,

2472
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:48,863
hi,

2473
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:49,790
oh,

2474
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:50,371
it's over now.

2475
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:52,320
Let's see who you really are.

2476
01:11:52,321 --> 01:11:57,321
And I think it's so many examples of
when you felt like he could showed people

2477
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,310
example,

2478
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:01,110
example that he's fought.

2479
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,590
Everybody opposed the judge just as base.

2480
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:04,880
Right?

2481
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,480
And I think that's what get people ladder.

2482
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:08,850
What make people frustrated.

2483
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:10,380
He gives impression that,

2484
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:11,633
you know,

2485
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:16,620
I only care about these
people that elected me.

2486
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:17,543
You won.

2487
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:18,660
Right?

2488
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,610
But do you have
responsibility to everybody?

2489
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,910
And it's just don't have that felon.

2490
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:24,000
Even on my social media,

2491
01:12:24,001 --> 01:12:24,661
I don't go hard.

2492
01:12:24,661 --> 01:12:26,250
I keep it kind of neutral.

2493
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,050
But I said something and somebody said,

2494
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:28,621
well,

2495
01:12:28,621 --> 01:12:30,180
the last time I checked Darnell,

2496
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:32,370
the economy was doing well.

2497
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:33,540
And I said,

2498
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:33,930
ah,

2499
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:36,480
you can't confuse the
economy with humanity.

2500
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:37,800
And that's the thing.

2501
01:12:37,801 --> 01:12:38,340
And that's what,

2502
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,500
that's what people don't feel good about.

2503
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:42,840
You can tout all the numbers,

2504
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:44,100
you could talk all the numbers,

2505
01:12:44,101 --> 01:12:46,590
you want a black unemployment,

2506
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,424
all the numbers,

2507
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:48,480
all the numbers.

2508
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:50,250
But how do people feel?

2509
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:51,623
You know what I'm saying,

2510
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,753
representative,

2511
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:53,491
they don't feel,

2512
01:12:53,491 --> 01:12:53,791
don't,

2513
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:54,960
they don't feel represented.

2514
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:55,380
Don't,

2515
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:57,990
they don't feel like
I can rock either way,

2516
01:12:57,991 --> 01:12:58,801
but I'd Democrat,

2517
01:12:58,801 --> 01:12:59,311
Republican,

2518
01:12:59,311 --> 01:13:02,640
I make enough money where a lot
of the views of Republicans,

2519
01:13:02,641 --> 01:13:02,871
but like,

2520
01:13:02,871 --> 01:13:03,061
Yo,

2521
01:13:03,061 --> 01:13:04,080
that's right up my alley.

2522
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:05,123
You know what I'm saying?

2523
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,073
Like you got there,

2524
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:06,300
right.

2525
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,133
I'm rich,

2526
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:08,191
you know,

2527
01:13:08,191 --> 01:13:08,730
like damn,

2528
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:10,450
I fucked a Republican pitches before us,

2529
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,200
you know,

2530
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,033
I'm saying,

2531
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:14,933
you know what I'm saying?

2532
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:15,960
But at same time,

2533
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:17,000
it's the,

2534
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:17,540
it's the,

2535
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:20,010
and it may not sound
right to a lot of people,

2536
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:21,870
but it's the human factor of it.

2537
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:22,801
You know what I'm saying?

2538
01:13:22,801 --> 01:13:24,960
Like you want to feel good,

2539
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:25,320
right.

2540
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,090
You want to,

2541
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:31,090
you why so many people don't know the
economy is doing well because they don't

2542
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:32,800
feel good.

2543
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,240
Right.

2544
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:33,780
You know what I'm saying?

2545
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:34,890
You want to celebrate,

2546
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:35,421
you want to cheer,

2547
01:13:35,421 --> 01:13:36,450
you want to feel good about it.

2548
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:37,703
And that's the whole thing.

2549
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:38,783
Anything.

2550
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:44,460
I believe when Obama ran
his campaign was change.

2551
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:46,530
Donald Trump's would make
American great again.

2552
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:49,980
Either one of them could have ran
off each other's campaign slogan.

2553
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:55,970
Do you know after Bush Obama could have
said make American great again and it

2554
01:13:56,551 --> 01:13:59,130
would electrify to debase
the same as change.

2555
01:13:59,460 --> 01:13:59,910
True.

2556
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:01,470
They said the same fucking thing.

2557
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,360
That would be a great thing for Obama.

2558
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:08,160
And I'm gonna tell you
one thing that kind of,

2559
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:11,590
I don't insulting or we get,

2560
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:12,191
people have said,

2561
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:14,390
it's like you keep pushing in narrative,

2562
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,790
make America great again,

2563
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:17,260
make America great again.

2564
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:22,440
You keep pushing it as if America was
so fucked up before you took office.

2565
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:23,710
And that's not the case.

2566
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:24,430
Right?

2567
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:26,020
Like when,

2568
01:14:26,021 --> 01:14:26,530
when,

2569
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:28,030
when Obama took it from Bush,

2570
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,720
he was making America great again.

2571
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:36,790
You're talking about a shit show
and the thing that people were,

2572
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:37,750
however you took it,

2573
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:38,860
respected or not,

2574
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:40,870
it was never nothing.

2575
01:14:40,871 --> 01:14:42,610
Lace would and it was never,

2576
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:44,343
it wasn't no,

2577
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:44,801
Yo,

2578
01:14:44,801 --> 01:14:45,611
you see this mess.

2579
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:46,450
Bush left me.

2580
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:47,770
It was never like,

2581
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:48,940
oh this motherfucker,

2582
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:49,721
it was never,

2583
01:14:49,721 --> 01:14:52,120
no mentioned to see a
new movie about Bush.

2584
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:53,540
I didn't see it either.

2585
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:54,010
What's it called?

2586
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:54,843
Jamie?

2587
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:57,670
Is it out the one with vice,

2588
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:02,380
but Dick Cheney and George
Bush or whenever I think about,

2589
01:15:02,381 --> 01:15:05,530
I say about the movie about getting
shot in the face because that's the only

2590
01:15:05,531 --> 01:15:06,400
thing that I want to say.

2591
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:08,521
Well the,

2592
01:15:08,521 --> 01:15:08,691
the,

2593
01:15:08,691 --> 01:15:12,820
the thing about Bush and Cheney is like
that movie kind of makes it seem like

2594
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:16,300
Cheney was the guy pulling the
strings and Bush was just like simple,

2595
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:19,690
happy go lucky guy who they just roped
into being president because he was the

2596
01:15:19,691 --> 01:15:21,160
son of a president.

2597
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:22,270
That's that far fetched though.

2598
01:15:22,271 --> 01:15:23,290
It's not far fetched at all.

2599
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:24,663
It's not at all.

2600
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:25,391
Not even remotely.

2601
01:15:25,391 --> 01:15:26,860
I think I actually agree with it,

2602
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:28,210
but I think about Bush now.

2603
01:15:28,211 --> 01:15:29,890
I don't think about
them in a negative way,

2604
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:31,750
but I think about changing
in a negative way.

2605
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:32,800
Yeah.

2606
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,430
Yeah.

2607
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:33,760
It,

2608
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,990
I think about Halliburton,

2609
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,081
I think about all the,

2610
01:15:36,081 --> 01:15:38,650
the rebuilding of the
places that we blew up,

2611
01:15:38,651 --> 01:15:42,520
like all the crazy shit on Dick Cheney
come from picture no bid contracts that

2612
01:15:42,521 --> 01:15:44,220
are worth billions of dollars to

2613
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:46,180
the bush.

2614
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,130
Because if I ha,

2615
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,360
I know it may sound crazy.

2616
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:54,300
If I had to have a pick
of who I would want,

2617
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:56,320
wanted to be the Republican candidate.

2618
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:57,183
It was on the,

2619
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:58,420
on the Republican side was on.

2620
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,070
I like Jeb Bush.

2621
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,170
I didn't really get to know him at all.

2622
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:02,770
That's it.

2623
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:05,920
That was something that I don't know,

2624
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,083
I don't know too much about,

2625
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:07,923
but I just,

2626
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:11,560
I just thought that he had,

2627
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:13,240
he was like Kinda like a mama's boy.

2628
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:15,250
I think he probably out of all the kids,

2629
01:16:15,251 --> 01:16:19,990
I probably think that he probably was
the one that thought a little outside of

2630
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:20,960
what their normal,

2631
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:24,490
I think he was a successful
businessman and mainly Latino chicken,

2632
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:25,383
if I'm not mistaken.

2633
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,433
I know nothing about them,

2634
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,251
but I just,

2635
01:16:27,251 --> 01:16:27,611
I don't know,

2636
01:16:27,611 --> 01:16:27,940
but,

2637
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:30,010
but Bush Trump fucked him up.

2638
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:30,993
Like,

2639
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:33,770
how do you fuck motherfuckers
up with just nicknames?

2640
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:34,650
Wander,

2641
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:35,483
laid down,

2642
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:36,970
fell like jab wanted to lay down.

2643
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:37,571
I really do.

2644
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:42,430
I felt like you didn't want that Trump
put all the motherfuckers days like you

2645
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,020
were saving till you got your nickname.

2646
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:44,771
Yeah.

2647
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:45,160
Yeah.

2648
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,250
Once you got lion,

2649
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,510
you know that motherfucker
like they rap artists.

2650
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:53,080
Yeah.

2651
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:53,291
No,

2652
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:54,250
it was a smart thing.

2653
01:16:54,251 --> 01:16:55,630
He did that no one's ever done before.

2654
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:56,370
Nobody.

2655
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:56,981
A lot of things.

2656
01:16:56,981 --> 01:16:57,814
And even like,

2657
01:16:57,970 --> 01:16:58,803
even when I'm,

2658
01:16:59,130 --> 01:16:59,541
even when,

2659
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:00,790
when Obama got elected,

2660
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:06,120
you know what it got a Bama elected was
fucking Facebook and $5 contributions,

2661
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:07,900
$5 donations.

2662
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:09,680
He was when he was,

2663
01:17:09,681 --> 01:17:09,881
when,

2664
01:17:09,881 --> 01:17:10,110
when,

2665
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:10,301
when,

2666
01:17:10,301 --> 01:17:10,560
when,

2667
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,380
when Obama was running that he was the
first person to use Facebook the way he

2668
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:16,214
did.

2669
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:16,880
Really?

2670
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:17,331
Oh Man,

2671
01:17:17,331 --> 01:17:19,940
I have so many every goddamn day.

2672
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,630
It was Obama acts,

2673
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,330
but he wouldn't ask for like millions.

2674
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:24,590
He would just like,

2675
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:25,640
like a dude in the hood.

2676
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:27,030
You're let me hold fat.

2677
01:17:27,031 --> 01:17:27,864
Arlis right?

2678
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:30,710
Like I would get an email,

2679
01:17:30,711 --> 01:17:30,920
hey,

2680
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:31,910
this is Barack Obama,

2681
01:17:31,911 --> 01:17:32,420
Yo,

2682
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:33,860
let me hold $10 right?

2683
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:35,000
And I got,

2684
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:35,481
and I was like,

2685
01:17:35,481 --> 01:17:35,661
yeah,

2686
01:17:35,661 --> 01:17:36,750
he got $10 right?

2687
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:42,340
And then a week later he asked for fucking
$20 and then he asked for 10 again,

2688
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:44,520
and then it got so bad.

2689
01:17:44,521 --> 01:17:46,490
Then Michelle was sent me an email,

2690
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:47,750
but he just,

2691
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:49,370
he'd nickeled and dimed America.

2692
01:17:49,371 --> 01:17:51,350
And that's what supported his campaign.

2693
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:55,680
And the fact that he was
at a right at the turn of,

2694
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:56,020
of,

2695
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:56,250
of,

2696
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:56,670
uh,

2697
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:57,030
of,

2698
01:17:57,030 --> 01:18:01,280
of form of media that you
can use to your advantage.

2699
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,600
He was the Facebook guy.

2700
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:03,291
He reached people.

2701
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:04,124
The Facebook,

2702
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:05,720
Donald Trump's doing the
same thing through Twitter.

2703
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:07,213
I can reach people.

2704
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,300
Why does he tweet so much?

2705
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,150
Why does he tweet so much everyday?

2706
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:15,270
Cause he knows motherfuckers would
rather pick up a phone every to treat.

2707
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:17,120
Didn't read a newspaper 100%.

2708
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:18,200
Fuck them.

2709
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,310
All I need is headlines.

2710
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:22,970
Way more people reading
tweets versus newspapers.

2711
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:23,690
Right.

2712
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:24,523
Every stunned.

2713
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,460
Like if you could get to see the exact
engagement in a good article in the New

2714
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:31,550
York Times on the front page versus
one of Donald Trump's tweets.

2715
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:33,340
Like nobody.

2716
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:37,100
The only two people that motherfuckers
are just waiting for their tweets come as

2717
01:18:37,101 --> 01:18:38,450
Donald Trump to Kanye west.

2718
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:38,900
Yeah.

2719
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:41,430
Those are the two most
interesting tweet people.

2720
01:18:41,770 --> 01:18:46,770
Kanye west could just say grapefruit juice
and fuck up all of the media the next

2721
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:47,540
day.

2722
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:48,321
What do you think he meant?

2723
01:18:48,321 --> 01:18:50,960
Do you think he meant it was
hungry or he was thirsty?

2724
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:52,180
Can you just tweet it?

2725
01:18:52,190 --> 01:18:53,060
Grapefruit juice,

2726
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:54,930
one of the most,

2727
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,770
one of the most interesting
tweeters out there.

2728
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:02,720
You wait for a Kanye West tweet while
he's kind of a free way of expressing

2729
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:03,554
himself.

2730
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:07,220
Here's an unfiltered way of
expressing myself and a lot of people,

2731
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:08,030
um,

2732
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:09,320
people have mixed feelings about it.

2733
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:13,070
It's views and the black community
is a little stressed out right now.

2734
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:13,340
Well,

2735
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:14,540
because of his Trump thing.

2736
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:15,590
But you know what,

2737
01:19:15,591 --> 01:19:15,980
uh,

2738
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:18,180
I don't know how much of that is to,

2739
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,033
there's two things.

2740
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:22,580
One Obama called MC jackass
that could weigh on you.

2741
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:23,900
That stung a little bit,

2742
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:24,860
you know,

2743
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,090
and then Obama,

2744
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,370
when Obama has gone
and Trump takes office,

2745
01:19:28,371 --> 01:19:29,960
Trump has willing to let him talk,

2746
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:30,890
but Trump's Trump,

2747
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:32,060
Trump old charm him.

2748
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:32,721
Here's the thing,

2749
01:19:32,721 --> 01:19:32,991
Joe,

2750
01:19:32,991 --> 01:19:33,711
with that said,

2751
01:19:33,711 --> 01:19:35,750
like when I do white clubs,

2752
01:19:35,751 --> 01:19:36,470
black clubs,

2753
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:37,100
whatever,

2754
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:38,300
do all type of clubs.

2755
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:39,890
But the thing is,

2756
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:41,173
um,

2757
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:42,110
you,

2758
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:42,943
you,

2759
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:45,560
you first off,

2760
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:47,570
Kanye West has a voice,

2761
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:49,663
not too many.

2762
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,740
As much as black people want
to throw the towel in on him.

2763
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:56,160
We don't have too many voices
that everybody is waiting
to hear whether whatever

2764
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:56,661
comes out,

2765
01:19:56,661 --> 01:19:57,494
he has a voice.

2766
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:01,040
I believe that Kanye West
is trying to say something.

2767
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,810
I just don't know what the fuck he's
trying to say because I'm not fluent in

2768
01:20:05,811 --> 01:20:06,644
easy,

2769
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,210
barely know Swahili.

2770
01:20:09,211 --> 01:20:14,211
I can do something easy and I
think he's trying to say something.

2771
01:20:14,881 --> 01:20:17,550
But if there was some type of interpreter,

2772
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:20,083
you know,

2773
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:20,860
this would be a dope.

2774
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:23,700
If the Chappelle show was right
now this would be a dope ass kid.

2775
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:25,380
Kanye West says something.

2776
01:20:25,381 --> 01:20:25,921
It did.

2777
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:26,754
Dave Chappelle,

2778
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:28,470
is this conscious to interpreter?

2779
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:29,580
That would be hilarious.

2780
01:20:29,581 --> 01:20:30,001
He does.

2781
01:20:30,001 --> 01:20:31,350
Connie says it didn't.

2782
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,193
Dave yells up.

2783
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:33,383
You know what I think,

2784
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,060
and this is men only talk
to him once on the phone.

2785
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:38,430
But what I think from studying
them and pay attention,

2786
01:20:38,431 --> 01:20:42,450
because we're supposed to eventually do
a podcast one day is I think he's uh,

2787
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,650
he's thinks different.

2788
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:44,490
He does.

2789
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:45,990
He connects dots different.

2790
01:20:45,991 --> 01:20:48,240
And that's one of the reasons
why he's so prolific with music.

2791
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:49,760
That's what I'm the point.

2792
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:51,340
I'm making jokes and that's the point.

2793
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:52,170
What I'm saying?

2794
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:53,250
Not speaking easy,

2795
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:55,590
but here's what some people
that think like that,

2796
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:57,870
they don't know how to get it out.

2797
01:20:57,871 --> 01:20:59,700
It's like just to speak it,

2798
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:01,650
but I have been thinking about you.

2799
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:02,341
I love you.

2800
01:21:02,341 --> 01:21:03,174
You're my dad.

2801
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:07,410
You must area here.

2802
01:21:07,411 --> 01:21:08,244
My Dad.

2803
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:09,720
You're like my father.

2804
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:11,850
You know how hard that was
for the black community here?

2805
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:13,920
Fuck.

2806
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,540
You could sell them a clean all you want,

2807
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:17,760
but what you're saying
you'd like my father.

2808
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,550
It didn't black people sitting back like,

2809
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:22,380
could you please explain that?

2810
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:23,520
So with the,

2811
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,470
then this was funny to me.

2812
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:26,550
They kind of said,

2813
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,070
yeah,

2814
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:27,570
you're like,

2815
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:32,100
like father figure to me like when I was
younger I thought he was Korea hit me,

2816
01:21:32,101 --> 01:21:33,900
we'll do horrific.

2817
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:35,070
You know?

2818
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:37,320
Father was in it in a shootout,

2819
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,513
a drive by,

2820
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,290
if this will fuck me up,

2821
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:40,650
bro.

2822
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:41,400
He said,

2823
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:41,611
yeah.

2824
01:21:41,611 --> 01:21:42,444
When I was younger,

2825
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:43,650
my parents

2826
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:47,460
separated at a young age.

2827
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:48,563
First off,

2828
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,160
you had parents,

2829
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,310
you already winning motherfucker.

2830
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:55,510
None of my niggas ain't beds.

2831
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,290
They had my mother and my father.

2832
01:21:58,291 --> 01:21:59,124
You know what I'm saying?

2833
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,200
Not that,

2834
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:00,451
no.

2835
01:22:00,451 --> 01:22:00,840
Okay,

2836
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:01,141
okay.

2837
01:22:01,141 --> 01:22:02,670
Cut My friends by her parents may say,

2838
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:04,400
my parents separated.

2839
01:22:04,401 --> 01:22:05,790
I mean they were married.

2840
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:07,560
That's two winds

2841
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:14,280
you up to before he be get to and they
separated and mom moved down the street.

2842
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:17,730
You still got to see your fucking father.

2843
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:21,840
So that was a little troubling.

2844
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:24,420
But the whole thing is,

2845
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:28,140
I'm pretty sure at some point Kaley West,

2846
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:30,600
we'll be able to speak a language
that everybody can understand.

2847
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:35,930
Until then it's only half full of
people to speak and understand it.

2848
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:37,390
And

2849
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:38,890
also right here.

2850
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:41,980
But here's my problem with all this and
I've been thinking about this a lot.

2851
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:43,870
They want to medicate him,

2852
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:45,190
right?

2853
01:22:45,190 --> 01:22:45,610
Yeah.

2854
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:48,190
Look how effective he is.

2855
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:49,811
Just stop.

2856
01:22:49,811 --> 01:22:53,230
Just stop and think about culturally
effective in terms of the music that he

2857
01:22:53,231 --> 01:22:53,681
makes it.

2858
01:22:53,681 --> 01:22:54,920
People love his,

2859
01:22:54,921 --> 01:22:55,754
his employees.

2860
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:57,370
He creates clothes.

2861
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:58,210
Okay.

2862
01:22:58,210 --> 01:22:59,390
He's married his,

2863
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,690
he craves conversation and dialogue too.

2864
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:02,380
He does.

2865
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:04,360
His wife makes hundreds
of millions of dollars.

2866
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:05,800
They're wealthy,

2867
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:06,430
insanely

2868
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:06,971
successful.

2869
01:23:06,971 --> 01:23:09,040
If you want to talk about overall success,

2870
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,060
they're together.

2871
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:11,110
They have children's,

2872
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:12,160
they're super wealthy.

2873
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:16,570
He produces incredible art that's loved
worldwide and they want to medicate him.

2874
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:18,760
Just stop and think about how effective,

2875
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:21,850
but they want to medicate what they
want to medicate him to operate.

2876
01:23:21,851 --> 01:23:23,520
At what level do exactly right.

2877
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:28,300
Think about how effective he is and yet
they want us to medication or off off

2878
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:30,490
when he's off medication.

2879
01:23:30,491 --> 01:23:31,630
He said himself,

2880
01:23:31,631 --> 01:23:35,830
he's his most creative stop and
think about how creative he's been.

2881
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:36,970
How successful is,

2882
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:38,290
how well received.

2883
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:39,573
Yeah.

2884
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:42,070
Happy and all these other
elements in his life,

2885
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:48,060
but yet they want him to act the way they
want him to act and take the hat off.

2886
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:49,533
You know what I'm saying?

2887
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:54,970
Whatever you can say whatever the fuck
you what the black wasn't mad cause he

2888
01:23:54,971 --> 01:23:55,421
would have had,

2889
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:58,900
they was mad cause it wasn't a fit
that was looking for a new era.

2890
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:00,460
If that was a new era,

2891
01:24:00,461 --> 01:24:01,810
they would have been more accepting of it.

2892
01:24:01,811 --> 01:24:02,200
Man.

2893
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,910
We just don't what Dad's side.

2894
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:06,310
It's red and white now
that that's a problem.

2895
01:24:06,311 --> 01:24:08,190
Anything with red with white letters.

2896
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:09,680
I'm

2897
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:10,131
telling you,

2898
01:24:10,131 --> 01:24:11,690
it's like when I see,

2899
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,190
it's so funny now.

2900
01:24:13,191 --> 01:24:14,180
Whenever I see a red head,

2901
01:24:14,181 --> 01:24:14,740
I'm like,

2902
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:15,573
oh,

2903
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:19,790
like I'm immediately after
the show upstate New York
and it was this white dude

2904
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:20,511
came up to me,

2905
01:24:20,511 --> 01:24:21,344
I have to show.

2906
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:23,430
And he didn't have what looked
like I'm making American great.

2907
01:24:23,431 --> 01:24:23,960
It hit,

2908
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:28,160
he had a make America great again hat
and it looked like he had the original

2909
01:24:28,161 --> 01:24:28,281
one.

2910
01:24:28,281 --> 01:24:29,114
You know how you got to,

2911
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:31,250
you know how you're going to
Boston fan and you're like,

2912
01:24:31,251 --> 01:24:32,150
you only been a fan.

2913
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:36,440
It was a brand America
making be great before.

2914
01:24:36,441 --> 01:24:40,400
Like he probably sold the
Hashtag [inaudible] they would.

2915
01:24:40,401 --> 01:24:40,971
Here's the thing,

2916
01:24:40,971 --> 01:24:41,740
Joe,

2917
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:42,150
this is my,

2918
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:47,150
he had the hat on this shit and at the
end of the show he was one of the dudes

2919
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:49,250
that was continued to laugh in the most,

2920
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,240
you know,

2921
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,960
and I went up to him and I,

2922
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:52,911
I was like,

2923
01:24:52,911 --> 01:24:53,041
Yo,

2924
01:24:53,041 --> 01:24:53,960
I gotta get a picture with you.

2925
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:55,101
And I took the picture.

2926
01:24:55,101 --> 01:24:55,671
It was a video.

2927
01:24:55,671 --> 01:24:56,001
I was like,

2928
01:24:56,001 --> 01:24:56,211
yeah,

2929
01:24:56,211 --> 01:24:56,960
motherfucker,

2930
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,750
y'all see us head.

2931
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:01,370
He started laughing and
we had a good moment.

2932
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:03,081
It wasn't,

2933
01:25:03,081 --> 01:25:03,680
no,

2934
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:04,790
I wasn't angry him.

2935
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:06,050
I'm not going to let

2936
01:25:08,990 --> 01:25:12,170
think it's hard to get away from it.

2937
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:15,770
But the think Kanya with the hat,

2938
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:20,070
he likes the idea of how
it gets people flustered.

2939
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:24,320
They get special was triggered,

2940
01:25:24,321 --> 01:25:25,154
right.

2941
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:26,023
One Omar's,

2942
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:27,580
excuse me.

2943
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:28,413
It's all right.

2944
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:29,451
No,

2945
01:25:29,451 --> 01:25:31,940
but I'm saying it's like
triggered like even,

2946
01:25:31,941 --> 01:25:32,710
and I,

2947
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:33,210
when I,

2948
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:36,210
when a guy had the hat
on and I was talking to,

2949
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:38,490
I heard an aside,

2950
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:39,403
it was like this,

2951
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:39,801
oh,

2952
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,140
he's triggered and I wasn't,

2953
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:43,880
I wasn't triggered by that.

2954
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:44,830
What I was trying,

2955
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:49,820
what I would have been triggered by just
how you make me feel with that hot no

2956
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:50,570
period.

2957
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:51,110
Period.

2958
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:51,590
You know,

2959
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:55,970
you can come at me like you could come
at me with the head on with some fucked

2960
01:25:55,971 --> 01:25:57,230
up energy and I could feel it.

2961
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,090
But the energy he gave me was like,

2962
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:00,620
I know this may sound crazy.

2963
01:26:00,621 --> 01:26:01,454
We was like,

2964
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:01,731
Yo,

2965
01:26:01,731 --> 01:26:03,590
you a funny motherfucker with the hat on.

2966
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:03,891
You're like,

2967
01:26:03,891 --> 01:26:04,670
okay,

2968
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:05,503
I didn't give a fuck.

2969
01:26:05,650 --> 01:26:05,900
Right.

2970
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:06,920
Because I couldn't let him,

2971
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:12,940
I couldn't let him make me feel
like if that's what his intent was,

2972
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:14,690
he's gonna make me feel uncomfortable.

2973
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:17,670
I couldn't do it seemed like he
was trying to make you feel and go.

2974
01:26:17,671 --> 01:26:18,580
I think he really does.

2975
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:19,280
Who he was.

2976
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,300
I think that's who he was,

2977
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:21,710
but I think that's what it was.

2978
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,350
But I know that motherfucker
laugh like a motherfucker.

2979
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,350
So at a comedy club,

2980
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,160
that's all you can ask for.

2981
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:31,520
So you could want since all you want.

2982
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:32,483
Yeah.

2983
01:26:33,010 --> 01:26:33,843
Yeah.

2984
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:37,370
Now you've got the right perspective
band looking at her all the right way.

2985
01:26:37,371 --> 01:26:38,240
I love it man.

2986
01:26:38,241 --> 01:26:43,241
It's like at the end of the day you got
good people and you got bad people and

2987
01:26:44,211 --> 01:26:46,970
it's who do you choose to be?

2988
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:47,930
Yeah.

2989
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:50,990
You want to be on the good side
of the bed and it's easy man.

2990
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:51,221
It's,

2991
01:26:51,221 --> 01:26:52,054
it's,

2992
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,520
I know it's a Corny Rodney King Sake.

2993
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:57,230
Can we all just get along?

2994
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:02,620
We all can get along if motherfuckers
just remove the hate when you know who I

2995
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:04,034
always look at it,

2996
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:04,970
we can get along.

2997
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,110
The three of us in this room,

2998
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:07,040
there have no problems.

2999
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,010
So when we people expand
out what goes wrong?

3000
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:13,640
Like if something goes wrong
when you get to like 3 million,

3001
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:14,653
what is it?

3002
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:16,970
3 million was just humans.

3003
01:27:16,971 --> 01:27:18,260
It's people expand out.

3004
01:27:18,261 --> 01:27:22,190
You get a couple of people together
and most people can be fine together.

3005
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:23,180
Most people,

3006
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:24,320
the vast majority,

3007
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:26,810
it's when you get to large numbers,

3008
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:27,890
it gets fucked up.

3009
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:28,880
It gets fucked up.

3010
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,940
It's almost like people are
supposed to live in small towns,

3011
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:32,661
you know,

3012
01:27:32,661 --> 01:27:36,790
with a bunch of cool like small town
with a bunch of assholes would suck small

3013
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:37,600
towns with all.

3014
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:41,090
How about if we lived in a
small town with all comedians

3015
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:44,120
right now I would be,

3016
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:45,980
if I live in a small town right now,

3017
01:27:45,981 --> 01:27:47,450
I would be a grandfather.

3018
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:48,890
You think so?

3019
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:52,490
100% what do you do in small towns?

3020
01:27:52,490 --> 01:27:54,470
You drink and get fucking her babies.

3021
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:54,711
Yeah,

3022
01:27:54,711 --> 01:27:55,970
but I mean a small town,

3023
01:27:55,971 --> 01:27:56,840
a community,

3024
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:57,853
let me say,

3025
01:27:57,890 --> 01:27:59,560
filled with Comedians we were,

3026
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:00,920
there would be a lot of murders.

3027
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:03,980
Young comedians will
actually kill each other.

3028
01:28:03,981 --> 01:28:04,814
Man,

3029
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:06,170
I can't even like,

3030
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:06,790
I can't eat.

3031
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:10,220
This is only a certain amount of communes
that can be around at one time because

3032
01:28:10,221 --> 01:28:11,054
it didn't start getting,

3033
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:11,571
you know,

3034
01:28:11,571 --> 01:28:13,480
there's motherfuckers jockeying
for the best joke bar.

3035
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:15,680
There's some that are like that,

3036
01:28:15,681 --> 01:28:19,540
but there's some that lay back and
the laughers and this other snipers.

3037
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:22,270
It was a good sniper.

3038
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:22,540
Yeah,

3039
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:22,970
there's,

3040
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:24,470
but they got their breathing pattern.

3041
01:28:24,471 --> 01:28:25,304
Right.

3042
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:27,630
They know when you pull that trigger,

3043
01:28:27,631 --> 01:28:28,640
he's supposed to shock you.

3044
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,320
It posts to site you every time.

3045
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:30,591
Yeah.

3046
01:28:30,591 --> 01:28:32,390
They don't throw any loose bombs,

3047
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,291
none of that shit.

3048
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:34,124
They got us.

3049
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:35,510
Yeah.

3050
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:36,380
That's a good way for that.

3051
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:39,680
That's a very snipers in the
motherfucker grants that go out there.

3052
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:40,670
Squares.

3053
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:42,020
I was military for four years.

3054
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:44,320
We Really?

3055
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,153
Yeah.

3056
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:46,720
I said I was,

3057
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:47,630
I was a word.

3058
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:49,070
I was a cop in the military.

3059
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:50,173
Really?

3060
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,030
Nobody believes I was at worst cop ever.

3061
01:28:52,031 --> 01:28:55,370
I've made one arrest in four years and
it was because the girl came through the

3062
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:55,581
gate.

3063
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:59,420
She has some big titties and I decided
that I needed to pull her over,

3064
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:02,340
but I was the worst fucking

3065
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:07,340
cock and I had to get out of the military
because I used to hear this phrase all

3066
01:29:07,381 --> 01:29:08,130
the time,

3067
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:08,880
airman Rollins,

3068
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,990
your blatant disregard for established
military policy shows a lack of military

3069
01:29:12,991 --> 01:29:14,070
brain and integrity.

3070
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:18,150
I here that I was like these muff was
going to gun and kicked me out if was four

3071
01:29:18,151 --> 01:29:18,984
years.

3072
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:24,110
I was a cop station and coons on Korea
station in Boleyn and you SEO tongue

3073
01:29:24,971 --> 01:29:27,120
saying NSCO Seo Nuna how you go.

3074
01:29:27,121 --> 01:29:28,470
They get talked to Kay Herso.

3075
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:29,850
Wow.

3076
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:30,683
Um,

3077
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:32,550
four years military,

3078
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:36,270
three years to two years in Korea,

3079
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:37,770
two years at Bolling air force base.

3080
01:29:37,771 --> 01:29:41,700
And I got out and just
randomly went to a comedy club,

3081
01:29:41,701 --> 01:29:42,660
became a heckler.

3082
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,060
I was an asshole.

3083
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:48,750
I used to go to his comedy club every
Wednesday to fuck with the comedians.

3084
01:29:48,990 --> 01:29:49,823
Where was it,

3085
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:51,090
Kami connection to greenbelt?

3086
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:53,460
It was like the black comedy club in DC.

3087
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:57,120
This was a time of when Martin Lawrence
was on fire to def jam thing was popping

3088
01:29:57,121 --> 01:29:59,220
in and they had on black comedy clubs.

3089
01:29:59,221 --> 01:29:59,850
It would be,

3090
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:00,990
it would be a pizza shop.

3091
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:03,570
They'll just turn okay now
and it's a comedy club.

3092
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,650
Monique had a club that she made a turn
from a restaurant to a comedy club just

3093
01:30:07,651 --> 01:30:10,830
because she got more business on the
weekend as a comical Indian restaurant and

3094
01:30:10,831 --> 01:30:14,550
it took it over and I used to
go heckle the comedians and I,

3095
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:19,730
I was such a good heckler that people
used to come to the show to hear me

3096
01:30:21,001 --> 01:30:21,834
heckle.

3097
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:22,860
There'll be a door like,

3098
01:30:22,861 --> 01:30:23,041
Yo,

3099
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:24,660
is that asshole dude
going to be here tonight?

3100
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:29,340
And that was me and the club owner dare
me to go on stage because he wanted to

3101
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:30,690
shut me up Java.

3102
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:33,450
So cocky after four weeks of heckling,

3103
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:36,260
I tried to make a deal
with the club on it.

3104
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,333
Come on,

3105
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:38,173
I swear.

3106
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:39,090
I know,

3107
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:39,601
I'm telling you.

3108
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:39,841
I said,

3109
01:30:39,841 --> 01:30:41,760
I know I've increased business by 30%

3110
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:44,720
we did start working on the door there.

3111
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:45,271
He looked at me like,

3112
01:30:45,271 --> 01:30:46,500
what the fuck are you talking about?

3113
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:47,910
Anybody in DC to tell you this story?

3114
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:49,410
And they wanted me to shut up.

3115
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:54,260
They asked me to go on stage and I went
on stage and the first time I went on I

3116
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:58,830
murdered the shit and I knew that I wasn't
going to be doing anything else with

3117
01:30:58,831 --> 01:30:59,664
my life with doing it.

3118
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:00,503
I just knew him.

3119
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:01,523
It was just like,

3120
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:02,130
fuck,

3121
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:03,660
fuck all like Pat,

3122
01:31:03,710 --> 01:31:03,981
Pat,

3123
01:31:03,981 --> 01:31:04,121
Pat,

3124
01:31:04,121 --> 01:31:04,580
pat.

3125
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:05,413
How did it feel?

3126
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,020
It felt great to remember it.

3127
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:09,240
I remember it because she in your mind,

3128
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:12,480
I remember it because I had
talked so much shit to this point.

3129
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,040
And the thing about it was,

3130
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:17,250
but th th the room of the energy,

3131
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:20,430
the energy of the room was there because
there was a lot of people that came.

3132
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:21,330
They saw me,

3133
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:22,950
they were like ink,

3134
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:24,330
like when you going go with you should,

3135
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:24,811
you know,

3136
01:31:24,811 --> 01:31:25,500
they were like,

3137
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:26,161
you should try,

3138
01:31:26,161 --> 01:31:26,631
you should try it.

3139
01:31:26,631 --> 01:31:28,080
So the first time I went on,

3140
01:31:28,081 --> 01:31:29,160
people were excited about it.

3141
01:31:29,161 --> 01:31:31,800
They didn't know what to expect
and I wrote all these jokes.

3142
01:31:31,801 --> 01:31:32,011
I'm like,

3143
01:31:32,011 --> 01:31:32,250
I got,

3144
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:33,180
I got 30 minutes.

3145
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,033
I was like,

3146
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:35,063
I was so cocky.

3147
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,200
We say have an open mic and you know,

3148
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:41,570
Mike List is like 30 people and I would
be like 10 on the list and they would

3149
01:31:41,571 --> 01:31:42,211
keep bumping me.

3150
01:31:42,211 --> 01:31:44,130
And I thought they were just
trying to save me the headline.

3151
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:46,680
I didn't think they were just trying
to give me the shittiest spot,

3152
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:49,890
but half the club came to see
me so they would stay there.

3153
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:54,870
And at first time I went on and all these
jokes I planned I was going to do and

3154
01:31:54,871 --> 01:31:56,910
when I went on stage I
drew a complete blank.

3155
01:31:57,330 --> 01:31:58,350
I remember shit.

3156
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:00,220
And then I went without no,

3157
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:00,551
that's,

3158
01:32:00,551 --> 01:32:02,050
I start fucking with
somebody in the audience.

3159
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:03,673
I got a laugh.

3160
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:04,201
It did.

3161
01:32:04,201 --> 01:32:05,320
I did my material and I've,

3162
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:07,270
I didn't know what the light was.

3163
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:09,520
They gave me the light and I was like,

3164
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:10,121
Oh,

3165
01:32:10,121 --> 01:32:10,954
I've got a goal.

3166
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:13,690
Like you know the light means
just make that your last joke.

3167
01:32:13,790 --> 01:32:14,230
Right.

3168
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:15,370
And I got off abruptly.

3169
01:32:15,371 --> 01:32:15,920
They ask,

3170
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:16,691
as I said,

3171
01:32:16,691 --> 01:32:19,450
I got to go and people started booing,

3172
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:20,860
the host went up and there was,

3173
01:32:20,861 --> 01:32:21,401
I know Daniel,

3174
01:32:21,401 --> 01:32:23,110
he doesn't know he's
new is his first time.

3175
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:24,250
He don't know what to like me.

3176
01:32:24,251 --> 01:32:25,150
He'll be like,

3177
01:32:25,151 --> 01:32:25,984
he'll be back.

3178
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:26,980
And um,

3179
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:31,980
I was there almost every Wednesday for
eight months and then I moved to new

3180
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:34,900
first I moved to New York six months.

3181
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:35,720
Wow.

3182
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:36,580
I said I'm Outta here.

3183
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:37,211
Where'd you go?

3184
01:32:37,211 --> 01:32:40,090
First Club was or live?

3185
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:41,050
Either one.

3186
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:41,770
Brooklyn,

3187
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:42,101
Brooklyn,

3188
01:32:42,101 --> 01:32:42,341
New York.

3189
01:32:42,341 --> 01:32:43,210
It was a bad barrel.

3190
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:44,320
That's why until it stops.

3191
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:45,880
But Brooke,

3192
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:50,380
it was interesting to me cause I didn't
go from from DC to like mainstream white

3193
01:32:50,381 --> 01:32:50,601
colors.

3194
01:32:50,601 --> 01:32:52,780
I was doing still to
kettle rooms and shit.

3195
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:54,940
And a lot of times I couldn't get spots.

3196
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:56,510
So I would go to a,

3197
01:32:56,890 --> 01:32:58,190
I will go to the um,

3198
01:32:58,450 --> 01:33:01,820
poetry open mikes cause
that she used to be so doll,

3199
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:07,240
the water was shifting the
wave wave and I'd be like,

3200
01:33:07,241 --> 01:33:08,680
is anybody want break for this shit?

3201
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:09,430
Right.

3202
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:12,360
And then I would go do just
when I couldn't do conquers,

3203
01:33:12,430 --> 01:33:16,210
I will do that until I started making a
name for myself and never looked back.

3204
01:33:16,211 --> 01:33:16,691
It was dope.

3205
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:20,750
New York is a great place
to get your chops up here.

3206
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:22,060
Do you enter New York?

3207
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:27,250
It had to be probably like 95,

3208
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,280
probably like 95 giant dirty moved.

3209
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,060
I'd gone,

3210
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:32,800
I left in [inaudible] 94 to come to la.

3211
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:33,280
Oh yeah.

3212
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,150
When did you get out of here?

3213
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:36,490
I got out here like seven years ago,

3214
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:37,900
maybe eight years ago.

3215
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:38,771
And there was,

3216
01:33:38,771 --> 01:33:40,030
because my,

3217
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:44,710
my sister was different because I wasn't
getting a lot of roadwork and I was

3218
01:33:44,711 --> 01:33:44,831
like,

3219
01:33:44,831 --> 01:33:45,390
well fuck,

3220
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:48,640
if I'm not getting lot of roadwork I
might as well try to get more film and

3221
01:33:48,641 --> 01:33:50,170
television stuff to move out to la.

3222
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:51,730
And then when I moved out here,

3223
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:52,773
I um,

3224
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:55,010
started getting more personal parents.

3225
01:33:55,020 --> 01:34:00,020
And so basically I moved to La and became
a road comic and I wasn't mad at it

3226
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:03,100
because after you've done it for a while,

3227
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:06,970
you just want to where the fucking
I can make money doing this shit.

3228
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:07,751
You know what I'm saying?

3229
01:34:07,751 --> 01:34:08,920
If the road is the road,

3230
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:10,211
you know what I mean?

3231
01:34:10,211 --> 01:34:10,991
If it's Hollywood,

3232
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:11,560
it's Hollywood.

3233
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:16,420
But who's going to pay me some money
and it was the road to now like I do 40

3234
01:34:16,421 --> 01:34:17,254
weekends a year,

3235
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:20,110
but with me having a a young kid,

3236
01:34:20,111 --> 01:34:25,111
now I'm trying to focus more in film
and television and get some more stable

3237
01:34:25,391 --> 01:34:26,131
shit cause I'm,

3238
01:34:26,131 --> 01:34:26,964
I'm getting a little,

3239
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:27,250
you know,

3240
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,030
it's getting burnt.

3241
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:30,940
I hate to say this because
I've said it too many times.

3242
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:33,490
[inaudible] she didn't have a podcast.

3243
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:38,230
I've heard the humor man did.

3244
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:40,000
I started a thousand podcasts.

3245
01:34:40,001 --> 01:34:41,140
I need to start yours.

3246
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:42,150
I'm with it.

3247
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:44,630
I'm telling you my dude
like you should do it.

3248
01:34:45,490 --> 01:34:47,050
I used to do and I miss,

3249
01:34:47,051 --> 01:34:47,861
I used to do radio.

3250
01:34:47,861 --> 01:34:48,461
I did radio.

3251
01:34:48,461 --> 01:34:51,880
I did hot 97 but I would love
to do a pocket here and natural.

3252
01:34:51,881 --> 01:34:53,680
You could have the number
one podcast in the country.

3253
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:54,341
No bullshit.

3254
01:34:54,341 --> 01:34:56,680
100% let's do anything,

3255
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:57,673
Jamie.

3256
01:34:57,710 --> 01:34:58,160
Yeah,

3257
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,000
it'd be easy.

3258
01:34:59,001 --> 01:35:02,930
You just need someone to make
you an account and just up shit.

3259
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:06,530
You could upload it literally from
your iPhone or whatever phone you use.

3260
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,540
You put a little microphone
in the bottom of it.

3261
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:10,400
I do it and another reason why,

3262
01:35:10,401 --> 01:35:12,470
because I'll always want to talk.

3263
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:13,011
Yeah,

3264
01:35:13,011 --> 01:35:14,090
I'm sure it's fun.

3265
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:15,411
I get it.

3266
01:35:15,411 --> 01:35:16,940
But you've been in the game for a while.

3267
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:17,863
Nine years,

3268
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:19,890
almost 10 when you were,

3269
01:35:20,430 --> 01:35:21,680
you could see yourself pioneer.

3270
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:22,640
No,

3271
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:24,140
there's people that before made for sure.

3272
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:25,820
I was just one of the early adopters.

3273
01:35:25,821 --> 01:35:26,930
I'd say early adopter,

3274
01:35:26,931 --> 01:35:28,100
but it was already established.

3275
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,540
Adam Curry had one,

3276
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:30,100
I think he's,

3277
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:35,100
he invented the name podcast and then
Adam Carolla went from radio to podcast

3278
01:35:35,181 --> 01:35:36,020
and that's when I was like,

3279
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:36,501
oh,

3280
01:35:36,501 --> 01:35:37,334
I didn't know.

3281
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:38,570
Oh wait a minute.

3282
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:40,800
Was he a radio personality for,

3283
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:41,780
he was doing the man show?

3284
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:42,521
No,

3285
01:35:42,521 --> 01:35:42,680
no.

3286
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:44,110
He did the Mancho and they did he,

3287
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:47,750
well he was a radio personality first
that he did the man show and I think he

3288
01:35:47,751 --> 01:35:49,160
did radio during the same time.

3289
01:35:49,161 --> 01:35:51,110
He did love line during the same time.

3290
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:56,350
And then after that he had a big time
syndicated morning radio show and I did

3291
01:35:56,391 --> 01:35:57,500
his radio show a couple of times.

3292
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:00,800
And then when he left his
radio show and went to podcast,

3293
01:36:00,801 --> 01:36:04,730
he got this professional studio built and
everything and I went to visit him and

3294
01:36:04,731 --> 01:36:05,031
I was like,

3295
01:36:05,031 --> 01:36:05,864
whoa.

3296
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:07,190
And I remember walking around the place,

3297
01:36:07,191 --> 01:36:07,461
come on,

3298
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:08,294
look at this shit.

3299
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:09,160
Like I was like,

3300
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:09,661
I came here,

3301
01:36:09,661 --> 01:36:10,494
I said,

3302
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:14,040
who the fuck got a wolf
and not a wolf from here?

3303
01:36:14,041 --> 01:36:14,731
From London?

3304
01:36:14,731 --> 01:36:15,520
Yo.

3305
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,410
Oh Shit.

3306
01:36:16,411 --> 01:36:18,200
That I'd never seen motherfuckers level.

3307
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:18,810
Like what is that

3308
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:19,111
point?

3309
01:36:19,111 --> 01:36:19,441
What does that,

3310
01:36:19,441 --> 01:36:20,370
what does that call it right there?

3311
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:22,020
That's an elk elk.

3312
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:23,520
One of the people that,

3313
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:24,383
um,

3314
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:25,623
that,

3315
01:36:26,350 --> 01:36:27,183
um,

3316
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,021
that make that,

3317
01:36:28,021 --> 01:36:28,620
what do they call it?

3318
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:30,150
Profession taxidermy.

3319
01:36:30,151 --> 01:36:32,460
But it's only when they put like the fake,

3320
01:36:32,670 --> 01:36:33,930
when the herring are over it,

3321
01:36:33,931 --> 01:36:34,810
the fake eyeballs.

3322
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:35,900
Is that yours?

3323
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:36,570
That's mine.

3324
01:36:36,570 --> 01:36:36,721
Yeah.

3325
01:36:36,721 --> 01:36:38,160
That's the actual real skull.

3326
01:36:38,410 --> 01:36:39,370
God Damn,

3327
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:43,920
that's what they call a European mount
when they just have the skull and the

3328
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:44,910
antlers.

3329
01:36:44,910 --> 01:36:46,410
That's where I get my food from cooking.

3330
01:36:46,411 --> 01:36:46,800
Uh,

3331
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:50,580
elk roast tonight when I get
Outta here and this from him

3332
01:36:52,110 --> 01:36:52,590
diet,

3333
01:36:52,590 --> 01:36:53,423
that one already,

3334
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:54,991
man.

3335
01:36:54,991 --> 01:36:55,824
Shit man.

3336
01:36:55,930 --> 01:36:57,480
Hell y'all.

3337
01:36:57,481 --> 01:36:59,450
If I should show my boys I'm eating elk,

3338
01:36:59,451 --> 01:36:59,791
they'd be like,

3339
01:36:59,791 --> 01:37:00,390
you changed.

3340
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:01,700
So I think you gain,

3341
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:03,081
Yo,

3342
01:37:03,081 --> 01:37:04,020
he gave his son,

3343
01:37:04,030 --> 01:37:06,000
he had cottage cheese the other day.

3344
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:07,080
Look,

3345
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,040
say he a Vegan.

3346
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:09,220
Any elk?

3347
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:10,470
Oh No.

3348
01:37:10,471 --> 01:37:14,780
Said he tried to do the fucking
$5 foot laws with smaller,

3349
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:18,333
smaller.

3350
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:19,050
That poor guy.

3351
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:20,730
I would say ask you this.

3352
01:37:20,731 --> 01:37:21,241
How does that go?

3353
01:37:21,241 --> 01:37:22,074
Come back.

3354
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:25,860
He doesn't ever know because he,

3355
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:26,753
he's going to,

3356
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:27,901
was he,

3357
01:37:27,901 --> 01:37:28,860
how does he feed himself?

3358
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:30,180
The way he feeds itself,

3359
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:34,410
because he's still going to have a base.

3360
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:38,910
The base is what was like
the motherfuckers be like,

3361
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:39,570
fuck it.

3362
01:37:39,570 --> 01:37:40,530
I would have did the same thing.

3363
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:41,733
Ooh,

3364
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:42,940
that's not a good group.

3365
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:43,793
People,

3366
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:45,580
you said it's not,

3367
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:48,300
it might not be a good group
of people the way you think it,

3368
01:37:48,301 --> 01:37:49,860
but for him it's a group of people.

3369
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:50,250
Right.

3370
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:55,250
It's going to be still some people that
want to hear his side of the story.

3371
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:56,753
Everybody's not,

3372
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,980
everybody's not like dismissive of them.

3373
01:37:59,160 --> 01:37:59,790
Right.

3374
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:01,110
It's some people still hold on to like,

3375
01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:06,210
well maybe some people that just gonna
you know like I refuse to believe it.

3376
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:08,160
Point blank.

3377
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:09,900
Well he's still denying it.

3378
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:11,100
He's saying that they're lying.

3379
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:12,533
Yeah man.

3380
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:13,613
But you know,

3381
01:38:14,010 --> 01:38:14,310
I don't know.

3382
01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:15,660
Maybe on that doesn't look good.

3383
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:16,131
Oh No,

3384
01:38:16,131 --> 01:38:18,150
don't do this was in town on now.

3385
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:19,530
I think something else was going on,

3386
01:38:19,531 --> 01:38:20,364
Bruh.

3387
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:21,510
I think something did.

3388
01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:23,160
I think he was,

3389
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:24,380
I think he was paused.

3390
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:25,770
Me paying him for something else.

3391
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,480
Would it be not just

3392
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:31,763
thank you guys.

3393
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,350
All right.

3394
01:38:34,351 --> 01:38:35,810
I got some other ways we can make money.

3395
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:36,360
I don't know.

3396
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:37,193
Again,

3397
01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:38,400
it's just,

3398
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:38,940
sorry.

3399
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:40,280
It's so fucked up bro,

3400
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:42,360
because you have

3401
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:44,903
like,

3402
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,751
it's so fucked.

3403
01:38:45,751 --> 01:38:46,201
Live up.

3404
01:38:46,201 --> 01:38:51,201
My older brother is gay and like with
that situation it kind of rung home to me

3405
01:38:54,190 --> 01:38:54,590
cause there,

3406
01:38:54,590 --> 01:38:56,010
when it first was pronounced like this,

3407
01:38:56,310 --> 01:38:57,590
I wish the fuck's in my word.

3408
01:38:57,591 --> 01:38:59,790
Try to validate my brother
would disrespect my brother.

3409
01:38:59,791 --> 01:39:00,780
I know how it arms.

3410
01:39:00,781 --> 01:39:01,614
I'd be ready to go.

3411
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:03,320
So I had that and that's
what's so fucked about.

3412
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:03,960
Oh Shit.

3413
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:05,100
He has so many people.

3414
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:07,110
There was Ryan for him
for different reasons,

3415
01:39:07,111 --> 01:39:07,830
man.

3416
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:12,720
And it's like really selfish for you to
not give a fuck about how you're going

3417
01:39:12,721 --> 01:39:13,554
to hurt people.

3418
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:14,250
You know what I mean?

3419
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:14,460
He,

3420
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:17,060
he didn't realize how bad
it would go wrong maybe man,

3421
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:17,760
Bro,

3422
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:18,270
come on.

3423
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:19,340
You go on the gates.

3424
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,480
Were you saying when you're,

3425
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:25,350
when you're saying thrawn
fuck the bleach on me mag.

3426
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:26,213
You trying to,

3427
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:28,550
you're trying to trigger a motherfucker.

3428
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:30,910
It's checker for Elvis cell.

3429
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:32,160
Did he say he was a gay Tupac?

3430
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:36,510
He said that I ain't no killer,

3431
01:39:36,511 --> 01:39:37,720
but don't push me for Vince.

3432
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:39,600
Just like the sweetest
joy next to getting,

3433
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:42,540
well he didn't say the
positive [inaudible] hilarious.

3434
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:44,040
He said that he was again,

3435
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:45,960
he already had his movie in his head.

3436
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:46,870
That's so irritating.

3437
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:48,240
I fought back.

3438
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:51,440
I'm the K two but he
already had his hashtag.

3439
01:39:51,441 --> 01:39:54,820
You probably bought the
white website trace there at,

3440
01:39:54,821 --> 01:39:56,400
and I don't want to start this podcast,

3441
01:39:56,401 --> 01:39:57,570
but I gotta pee so bad.

3442
01:39:58,110 --> 01:39:59,490
I did two podcasts in a row.

3443
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,650
Can Talk to Jamie for just two minutes.

3444
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:03,470
We can talk about what is that?

3445
01:40:03,790 --> 01:40:04,830
I'll take one of those.

3446
01:40:04,831 --> 01:40:05,710
Is that a pre roll

3447
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:08,103
words back?

3448
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:09,180
I'll be right back of,

3449
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:10,350
I just have to be so bad.

3450
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,440
I ain't mad at you son.

3451
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:18,570
Look,

3452
01:40:18,570 --> 01:40:19,890
just know you know you la.

3453
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:20,760
I just,

3454
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:22,500
is this an indycar sativa?

3455
01:40:23,070 --> 01:40:26,900
There is some extra spice and next year
there's a little extra like I think it's

3456
01:40:26,901 --> 01:40:28,530
called butter butter.

3457
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:29,550
That why that's like wax.

3458
01:40:29,970 --> 01:40:30,803
What?

3459
01:40:31,530 --> 01:40:32,480
It's a little bit it.

3460
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:33,960
You can't really tell it
to be honest with you.

3461
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:36,960
That's how white boys set up.

3462
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:39,860
No,

3463
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:40,950
just eat half the ear.

3464
01:40:40,951 --> 01:40:41,784
You'll be okay.

3465
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:44,910
How many people still come
up to you about the wire?

3466
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:46,260
I know that obviously Chappelle show,

3467
01:40:46,261 --> 01:40:47,370
but the bond,

3468
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:48,640
the people that come into me a wired,

3469
01:40:48,641 --> 01:40:52,170
they'd identify by themselves
as instant intellects.

3470
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:52,800
Yeah.

3471
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:53,350
You know what I'm saying?

3472
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:54,050
Like people in

3473
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:54,310
Hell,

3474
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:54,610
they'll,

3475
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:55,090
they'll,

3476
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:56,170
it's almost like they're cocky.

3477
01:40:56,171 --> 01:40:58,510
Like I know you want Chappelle
on a couple other things,

3478
01:40:58,511 --> 01:40:59,080
but you know what?

3479
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:00,560
I really love you from the wire.

3480
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:03,040
That was a dope experience.

3481
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:06,550
Did you ever watch HBO
is the corner I started,

3482
01:41:06,551 --> 01:41:06,941
I started,

3483
01:41:06,941 --> 01:41:07,990
I think I got a,

3484
01:41:07,991 --> 01:41:09,910
I feel like it was six
episodes and I watched you,

3485
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,310
it was a six year olds on the ministers.

3486
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:12,220
All of it.

3487
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:12,970
I was in ed.

3488
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:13,510
Okay.

3489
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:15,750
I played a heroin addict and that,

3490
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:16,683
and um,

3491
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,310
a lot of people don't
know people that are fans.

3492
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:19,530
If you are a fan of the wire,

3493
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:22,480
you definitely been a fan of recording
because so many of the actors came back

3494
01:41:22,481 --> 01:41:26,230
to after I watched the wire I wanted
more and more content like that.

3495
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:27,640
And so I went back and tried to watch it,

3496
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:28,420
but I just,

3497
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:30,790
I actually enjoyed
rewatching the wire more.

3498
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:31,631
So I've watched,

3499
01:41:31,631 --> 01:41:33,040
I liked to show and I was supposed to,

3500
01:41:33,041 --> 01:41:34,620
my character was supposed to um,

3501
01:41:34,990 --> 01:41:35,823
build up more.

3502
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:38,200
But uh,

3503
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:43,290
the Baltimore Tourism Board was upset
that every time someone goes shooting,

3504
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:48,300
bought somebody depicted as a drug
infested pretty much what it is.

3505
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:50,170
So that's why he went from the,

3506
01:41:50,290 --> 01:41:51,880
if you notice the shift in the writing,

3507
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:54,610
it went from the towers to the DOC's.

3508
01:41:54,611 --> 01:41:55,030
Like,

3509
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:56,240
how the fuck did we get to the docks?

3510
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,420
That's cause they didn't just
want to be in the hood like that.

3511
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:01,330
But David Simon,

3512
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:02,643
he was um,

3513
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:03,731
he was like,

3514
01:42:03,731 --> 01:42:03,911
Yo,

3515
01:42:03,911 --> 01:42:04,381
I liked you.

3516
01:42:04,381 --> 01:42:05,680
Have you know what you did.

3517
01:42:05,681 --> 01:42:07,960
So they brought me back for the last,

3518
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:09,160
for the last season.

3519
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,810
I've tried to get Joe to watch it,

3520
01:42:10,811 --> 01:42:11,100
but it's,

3521
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:12,550
it's like it's 10 years old now.

3522
01:42:12,551 --> 01:42:13,010
So it's,

3523
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:14,530
I get back into an old show,

3524
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:15,820
but it's so good.

3525
01:42:15,821 --> 01:42:16,880
So many people list that way.

3526
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:18,880
Like they were like,

3527
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:22,780
definitely why are fanatics and when
they brought me back to last season,

3528
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:27,700
I was nervous because HBO the last
season of any show on HBO to writers get

3529
01:42:27,701 --> 01:42:29,860
vindictive and they do nasty
shit to the characters.

3530
01:42:29,861 --> 01:42:31,120
Like to last season,

3531
01:42:31,121 --> 01:42:31,541
the Oz,

3532
01:42:31,541 --> 01:42:32,650
it was dudes getting raped.

3533
01:42:32,651 --> 01:42:34,060
An Aza wouldn't even on us.

3534
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:35,261
They was like,

3535
01:42:35,261 --> 01:42:35,501
dude,

3536
01:42:35,501 --> 01:42:36,340
I'm on Nickelodeon.

3537
01:42:36,341 --> 01:42:38,080
I'm just trying to get
to the bathroom man.

3538
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:39,610
But they was right to me.

3539
01:42:39,611 --> 01:42:42,800
I didn't get raped the last
season and it was fun topic.

3540
01:42:43,150 --> 01:42:47,320
I know I've got to settle
down and choose it for a run.

3541
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:48,420
Yeah.

3542
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:49,360
Get in and it's still,

3543
01:42:49,361 --> 01:42:49,801
it's the,

3544
01:42:49,801 --> 01:42:50,880
you just got to watch it because it's,

3545
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:51,760
it's so good.

3546
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:56,500
His character comes up at like the best
time and he's not to spoiler alert it,

3547
01:42:56,501 --> 01:42:59,680
but like the follow the money
starts with him and like that's a,

3548
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:00,543
that's why,

3549
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:01,501
you know,

3550
01:43:01,501 --> 01:43:04,870
that did my role would have been
like if they didn't switch the tone,

3551
01:43:04,871 --> 01:43:06,370
if they would've kept it in the towers.

3552
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:11,820
My Shit was cause I was the connection
between the streets and the politics.

3553
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:14,680
I know I could have blown I out.

3554
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:16,600
And when I first got busted,

3555
01:43:16,601 --> 01:43:17,321
when I was in a room,

3556
01:43:17,321 --> 01:43:17,861
I was trying to,

3557
01:43:17,861 --> 01:43:18,480
I was getting robbed,

3558
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:19,313
a mansion,

3559
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:20,490
it will tell you Dan.

3560
01:43:20,491 --> 01:43:20,891
And he said,

3561
01:43:20,891 --> 01:43:21,724
what's your name?

3562
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:22,241
I said,

3563
01:43:22,241 --> 01:43:23,074
my name is um,

3564
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:24,010
uh,

3565
01:43:24,010 --> 01:43:24,843
data.

3566
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:25,211
Uh,

3567
01:43:25,211 --> 01:43:26,044
my name is dayday,

3568
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:28,810
but they mostly call me Damien.

3569
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:29,740
Right.

3570
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:30,460
And then he said,

3571
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:31,840
my name is Daniel.

3572
01:43:32,470 --> 01:43:34,210
And they mostly call me lieutenant.

3573
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:37,690
And this is have to had already seen
how old robbed a whole Korean because I

3574
01:43:37,691 --> 01:43:38,920
thought he was a driver with me.

3575
01:43:39,370 --> 01:43:41,260
And that character's should
have been off by then.

3576
01:43:41,261 --> 01:43:43,630
But so it was a good opportunity.

3577
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:45,070
There was another cool platform.

3578
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:45,970
It was dope.

3579
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:47,890
I can honestly say whatever
happens in my career.

3580
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:50,710
I was on two shows.

3581
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:52,100
There are good go down

3582
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:52,970
in television history.

3583
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:54,930
The wires you have,

3584
01:43:54,940 --> 01:43:56,300
I believe you about the wire.

3585
01:43:56,930 --> 01:43:58,030
I mean everybody says it.

3586
01:43:58,250 --> 01:43:58,670
I just had,

3587
01:43:58,670 --> 01:44:00,680
I never saddled down and washed it.

3588
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,870
But for sure Chappelle show
is the greatest sketch comedy.

3589
01:44:03,871 --> 01:44:04,280
It's,

3590
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:07,850
it's one number one and number two
is like that and in living color.

3591
01:44:07,851 --> 01:44:11,390
And you could pick your spot depending
upon when you grew up and what it meant

3592
01:44:11,391 --> 01:44:11,870
to you.

3593
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:13,790
Because for a lot of
people in living color too,

3594
01:44:13,791 --> 01:44:14,780
cause it was on Fox,

3595
01:44:14,781 --> 01:44:16,310
you didn't have to have cable to get it.

3596
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,010
It was on Fox and I have to have cable.

3597
01:44:19,011 --> 01:44:22,250
Did you have to understand
a Fox Fox was right,

3598
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:23,450
but then it was like,

3599
01:44:23,451 --> 01:44:27,020
it was new too because it was for
the most part of all black cast,

3600
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:27,951
all black cast.

3601
01:44:27,951 --> 01:44:28,900
When you dancers,

3602
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:29,650
dancers,

3603
01:44:29,650 --> 01:44:32,060
it was Jennifer Lopez.

3604
01:44:32,070 --> 01:44:34,120
Everybody was making money and
getting to ask when that was,

3605
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:38,480
don't the wins I think
who wasn't shine was Dj.

3606
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:39,740
I don't even think he knew how to Dj.

3607
01:44:39,741 --> 01:44:43,220
But Keenan had deaf fucking vision man.

3608
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:43,760
Yeah.

3609
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:44,511
He had that vision.

3610
01:44:44,511 --> 01:44:46,910
Who's like the seasons in that go?

3611
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:47,931
Oh No,

3612
01:44:47,931 --> 01:44:48,920
probably six.

3613
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:50,670
But they're really go that man.

3614
01:44:50,850 --> 01:44:51,620
It was um,

3615
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:52,550
that was the show.

3616
01:44:52,730 --> 01:44:54,950
Every comedian hope did,

3617
01:44:54,951 --> 01:44:55,280
they will,

3618
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,860
every year they would come around and
say they're looking for new people for

3619
01:44:57,861 --> 01:45:01,460
living color in every city was like just
busting doors down and tried to get an

3620
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:02,294
audition.

3621
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:06,470
And I remember watching him for the
first time I was at a pool hall and like

3622
01:45:06,471 --> 01:45:06,981
Yonkers,

3623
01:45:06,981 --> 01:45:09,830
New York and I looked up at the
screen and me and a buddy of mine,

3624
01:45:09,831 --> 01:45:12,500
my friend Jon Tobin were playing
pool and we're watching the show.

3625
01:45:12,501 --> 01:45:12,771
I was like,

3626
01:45:12,771 --> 01:45:13,970
what in the fuck?

3627
01:45:15,110 --> 01:45:16,270
And it was fun to do it.

3628
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,960
No lips and fire Marshall.

3629
01:45:17,961 --> 01:45:18,621
Bill came out.

3630
01:45:18,621 --> 01:45:18,920
I was like,

3631
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:19,281
God,

3632
01:45:19,281 --> 01:45:20,780
the fuck John [inaudible] was,

3633
01:45:20,910 --> 01:45:22,640
I was animal man.

3634
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:26,450
He was again like once you saw him,

3635
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:27,650
you just start laughing.

3636
01:45:27,910 --> 01:45:28,220
Yeah.

3637
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:29,053
He was an animal.

3638
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:29,511
I mean,

3639
01:45:29,511 --> 01:45:30,230
how many times,

3640
01:45:30,230 --> 01:45:31,063
Eric,

3641
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:32,060
what do we have now?

3642
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:32,481
Homey.

3643
01:45:32,481 --> 01:45:34,730
The clown clown homie.

3644
01:45:34,731 --> 01:45:35,301
Don't play that.

3645
01:45:35,301 --> 01:45:36,150
Girls were always saying,

3646
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:38,290
I'm Paul Mooney on wrote
the home in Cloncurry.

3647
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:39,133
Really?

3648
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:40,520
Yup.

3649
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:41,390
It's hilarious.

3650
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:43,190
It was groundbreaking.

3651
01:45:43,191 --> 01:45:44,024
It was Wanda.

3652
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:46,093
Wow.

3653
01:45:46,570 --> 01:45:47,490
He fights,

3654
01:45:49,210 --> 01:45:49,941
but they look at that.

3655
01:45:49,941 --> 01:45:50,541
That's funny,

3656
01:45:50,541 --> 01:45:52,100
right when talk about how,

3657
01:45:52,130 --> 01:45:52,491
nope.

3658
01:45:52,491 --> 01:45:52,971
Have a career.

3659
01:45:52,971 --> 01:45:54,370
That motherfucker got Jamie foster.

3660
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:55,670
Go for that to Oscar.

3661
01:45:55,970 --> 01:45:57,470
That motherfucking could do anything.

3662
01:45:57,530 --> 01:45:59,060
He could do anything and sing.

3663
01:45:59,300 --> 01:45:59,421
Yeah,

3664
01:45:59,421 --> 01:46:00,440
we've talked about it before.

3665
01:46:00,441 --> 01:46:01,550
He's got that weird,

3666
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:03,860
he's got that weird
ability to do anything.

3667
01:46:03,861 --> 01:46:07,040
Like when Mike Tyson was
talking about Jamie playing him,

3668
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:08,960
you know he was a,

3669
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:09,620
well,

3670
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:10,453
Jamie welcome.

3671
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:11,720
He's apparently is.

3672
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:12,260
Oh,

3673
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:12,531
I know.

3674
01:46:12,531 --> 01:46:13,190
He's going to kill him.

3675
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:13,880
He's going to kill it.

3676
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:14,480
It's going to kill it.

3677
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:15,313
He could do anything.

3678
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:16,310
He can do anything.

3679
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:17,900
He's got great stories,

3680
01:46:17,901 --> 01:46:18,350
man.

3681
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:20,030
How'd one of the podcasts are a great,

3682
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:20,821
great story.

3683
01:46:20,821 --> 01:46:22,430
He's just a good guy.

3684
01:46:22,431 --> 01:46:25,340
Anytime I've ran into any
time I've talked to him,

3685
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:27,440
he's always been a really cool dude.

3686
01:46:27,441 --> 01:46:27,981
Good Dude,

3687
01:46:27,981 --> 01:46:28,341
man.

3688
01:46:28,341 --> 01:46:29,390
It's very friendly.

3689
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,660
Last time I saw him was at a gas station.

3690
01:46:31,670 --> 01:46:33,500
He's got some crazy fucking truck,

3691
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:34,671
some weird thing.

3692
01:46:34,671 --> 01:46:34,941
I was like,

3693
01:46:34,941 --> 01:46:35,661
what is that?

3694
01:46:35,661 --> 01:46:37,070
I never even saw one
of those things before.

3695
01:46:37,071 --> 01:46:37,760
I don't know what it is.

3696
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,860
And then you got a whole bunch
of what you never seen before is,

3697
01:46:39,861 --> 01:46:40,081
you know,

3698
01:46:40,081 --> 01:46:40,914
like what is that?

3699
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:41,390
Oh,

3700
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:43,310
that was from something new.

3701
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:44,180
Uh,

3702
01:46:44,180 --> 01:46:47,480
some new custom made weird fucking truck.

3703
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:48,413
Right.

3704
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:49,860
It looks like from the future.

3705
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:50,551
Does he drive it?

3706
01:46:50,551 --> 01:46:50,970
I'll just,

3707
01:46:50,970 --> 01:46:51,620
he was driving it.

3708
01:46:51,620 --> 01:46:51,910
Yeah.

3709
01:46:51,910 --> 01:46:52,743
Yeah.

3710
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:54,143
He was a,

3711
01:46:54,620 --> 01:46:55,453
yeah.

3712
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:56,753
Good Dude.

3713
01:46:57,780 --> 01:46:59,060
He never did it.

3714
01:46:59,530 --> 01:47:00,363
No,

3715
01:47:00,410 --> 01:47:02,430
I think he's doing more standup again.

3716
01:47:02,970 --> 01:47:04,350
I heard he's doing more standup,

3717
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:04,951
but you know,

3718
01:47:04,951 --> 01:47:05,784
how do you,

3719
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:10,850
that's a tough thing to do to probably
to get that level as an international,

3720
01:47:11,650 --> 01:47:12,750
a list superstar,

3721
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:15,360
to still have the passion to do stand up.

3722
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:16,433
Right.

3723
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,400
You got to want it.

3724
01:47:17,610 --> 01:47:19,530
You gotta want to do it
for some strange reason.

3725
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:22,230
Let the motherfuckers peers in your group.

3726
01:47:22,231 --> 01:47:22,411
No,

3727
01:47:22,411 --> 01:47:23,070
I still got it.

3728
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:23,880
Motherfucker.

3729
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:24,713
You know who did,

3730
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:26,700
who did you ever see that thing?

3731
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:29,100
It was about maybe a year or so ago.

3732
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,890
Right when bill Cosby was in
the heat of all his trouble,

3733
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:37,130
where Eddie Murphy did some stand up on
a day s like in front of a platform that

3734
01:47:37,471 --> 01:47:37,950
was for,

3735
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:40,410
it was an award he got
at the Kennedy Center.

3736
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,510
It was some type of cultural show.

3737
01:47:42,511 --> 01:47:44,040
I can't remember exactly the name of it,

3738
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:45,241
but I remember,

3739
01:47:45,241 --> 01:47:46,560
I think Dave was a part of that tour.

3740
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,393
That was a big deal.

3741
01:47:47,910 --> 01:47:50,130
But what got me was how good he was.

3742
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:51,450
Oh God damn.

3743
01:47:51,451 --> 01:47:52,410
He's good.

3744
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:53,910
He's a comedian.

3745
01:47:53,911 --> 01:47:54,744
You know,

3746
01:47:55,170 --> 01:47:58,140
even though he's not
using the stage platform,

3747
01:47:58,680 --> 01:47:59,513
you know,

3748
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:02,460
he sits around or it's like,

3749
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:03,480
oh shit.

3750
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:03,930
Yeah,

3751
01:48:03,930 --> 01:48:04,763
that will be fun.

3752
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:05,640
Of course,

3753
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:06,090
you know,

3754
01:48:06,090 --> 01:48:06,391
I mean,

3755
01:48:06,391 --> 01:48:11,100
he had this whole routine
about them taking bill Cosby's
a doctorate degree away

3756
01:48:11,101 --> 01:48:11,934
from him.

3757
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:15,090
He had this whole bit about it when he's
doing the bill Cosby impression wise

3758
01:48:15,091 --> 01:48:15,211
too.

3759
01:48:15,211 --> 01:48:15,391
I ain't,

3760
01:48:15,391 --> 01:48:15,571
man,

3761
01:48:15,571 --> 01:48:16,051
I'm telling you,

3762
01:48:16,051 --> 01:48:16,450
man,

3763
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:19,920
you killed the timing was that would
be so good to see him do it again.

3764
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:21,410
That's what I'm thinking is,

3765
01:48:21,470 --> 01:48:22,950
is it was so powerful.

3766
01:48:22,951 --> 01:48:23,401
I was like,

3767
01:48:23,401 --> 01:48:23,911
God damn,

3768
01:48:23,911 --> 01:48:26,100
we missed out on years of this.

3769
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:27,181
Yeah.

3770
01:48:27,181 --> 01:48:27,571
You like,

3771
01:48:27,571 --> 01:48:28,590
what would he talk about?

3772
01:48:28,591 --> 01:48:30,420
He's like probably close to being a grant.

3773
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:31,800
Can you play a little bit?

3774
01:48:32,490 --> 01:48:33,323
I don't know.

3775
01:48:33,450 --> 01:48:34,680
Maybe it's only a minute long.

3776
01:48:34,681 --> 01:48:35,514
Just give me a little bit.

3777
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:36,473
Just give me a little bit.

3778
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:39,180
Okay.

3779
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:40,170
Scan a bunch of the music.

3780
01:48:40,390 --> 01:48:41,223
Here it goes.

3781
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:42,960
Bill has one of these.

3782
01:48:42,961 --> 01:48:43,794
He says

3783
01:48:45,190 --> 01:48:45,871
y'all make bill.

3784
01:48:45,871 --> 01:48:46,704
Give his back.

3785
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:49,290
When he went,

3786
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:50,610
you did the trophies back.

3787
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:55,350
Hostos man.

3788
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:55,591
Dude,

3789
01:48:55,591 --> 01:48:56,341
I'm telling you,

3790
01:48:56,341 --> 01:48:58,080
when you watch him do this,

3791
01:48:58,110 --> 01:48:58,950
this routine,

3792
01:48:58,951 --> 01:48:59,311
you go,

3793
01:48:59,311 --> 01:49:00,031
oh my God,

3794
01:49:00,031 --> 01:49:00,990
he's still got it.

3795
01:49:01,230 --> 01:49:02,780
It's like he motherfucking Murphy.

3796
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:06,390
I nobody hasn't done any standup in
forever and it was like he's been doing it

3797
01:49:06,391 --> 01:49:07,224
every day.

3798
01:49:07,350 --> 01:49:07,591
Yeah,

3799
01:49:07,591 --> 01:49:11,100
but you got to look at him when he came
on like certain people to just naturals

3800
01:49:11,101 --> 01:49:11,730
bro.

3801
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:13,650
But it's so sad that he
hasn't been doing it,

3802
01:49:13,651 --> 01:49:14,484
man.

3803
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:15,750
When you stop and think,

3804
01:49:15,751 --> 01:49:16,920
go from raw,

3805
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:18,001
you know,

3806
01:49:18,001 --> 01:49:21,390
delirious to Ra to nothing
for all these years.

3807
01:49:21,391 --> 01:49:23,520
And he might be if he's not enough,

3808
01:49:23,521 --> 01:49:24,480
but I wouldn't say nothing.

3809
01:49:24,481 --> 01:49:25,650
International movie star,

3810
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:26,371
you know,

3811
01:49:26,371 --> 01:49:26,730
but not,

3812
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:27,563
you mean for sure?

3813
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:30,030
Nothing is terms of his do his stand up.

3814
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:30,390
Gotcha.

3815
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:30,931
That's all.

3816
01:49:30,931 --> 01:49:31,764
I mean Wayne,

3817
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:33,630
he's an international movie star,

3818
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:39,080
but he could have been one of the greatest
of all time if he isn't already money

3819
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:40,560
is already,

3820
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:43,770
you have a top 10 you got to kind of
put Eddie Murphy in there of course.

3821
01:49:43,770 --> 01:49:45,150
But he could be number one ever.

3822
01:49:45,450 --> 01:49:45,750
Yeah.

3823
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:46,860
If he just kept doing it.

3824
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:48,370
But he made us,

3825
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:49,660
it would just be interesting,

3826
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:51,010
but he made his mark.

3827
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,510
Nobody was fucking doing it.

3828
01:49:52,511 --> 01:49:54,880
Like we got big names and stuff now,

3829
01:49:54,881 --> 01:49:56,380
but Eddie Murphy was just like,

3830
01:49:57,070 --> 01:50:01,240
everybody was talking about him like
his special job for the next day.

3831
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:03,220
Everybody was quoting lines from it.

3832
01:50:03,610 --> 01:50:04,270
I was,

3833
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:07,790
I watched it with my
friend Jimmy and a with a,

3834
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:12,910
a bunch of his friends and we were
probably like 18 or something like that.

3835
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:14,860
Like maybe raw Dylan,

3836
01:50:14,861 --> 01:50:17,020
1718 delirious.

3837
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,790
So Beth and I remember we were just like,

3838
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:19,990
everyone was stunned.

3839
01:50:20,140 --> 01:50:20,861
Like we were just,

3840
01:50:20,861 --> 01:50:23,280
everyone was sitting
back on the couch going,

3841
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:24,070
Oh God,

3842
01:50:24,070 --> 01:50:24,970
that was incredible.

3843
01:50:24,971 --> 01:50:26,410
Dice clay had that energy.

3844
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:27,190
Yeah.

3845
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:28,060
Dice clay head.

3846
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:29,110
Everyone was like,

3847
01:50:29,111 --> 01:50:31,380
what you said when spatials
were really special,

3848
01:50:31,381 --> 01:50:32,680
but it wasn't very many of them.

3849
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:33,820
It was a couple of them.

3850
01:50:33,821 --> 01:50:35,230
And then whoever that
person was you would,

3851
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:38,740
you knew you were going to see them on
TV or somewhere for like the next two

3852
01:50:38,741 --> 01:50:39,041
years.

3853
01:50:39,041 --> 01:50:39,701
Easy Dude.

3854
01:50:39,701 --> 01:50:43,630
I found out about Kennison from a girl
that worked the front desk at a health

3855
01:50:43,631 --> 01:50:44,530
club that it worked out.

3856
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:46,720
I used to work at this
[inaudible] going to say,

3857
01:50:46,721 --> 01:50:47,950
what the fuck was he doing in here?

3858
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:52,540
I worked at this nautilus
plus and revere was a revere.

3859
01:50:52,541 --> 01:50:54,370
Massachusetts is like this fitness place.

3860
01:50:54,710 --> 01:50:55,000
Uh,

3861
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:55,181
no,

3862
01:50:55,181 --> 01:50:55,901
that wasn't nautilus.

3863
01:50:55,901 --> 01:50:56,591
Plus that was,

3864
01:50:56,591 --> 01:50:57,424
um,

3865
01:50:57,700 --> 01:50:58,351
that was a,

3866
01:50:58,351 --> 01:51:02,470
the fucking Goddamn Boston
Athletic Club in South Boston.

3867
01:51:02,471 --> 01:51:03,130
That's where it was.

3868
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:03,530
But anyway,

3869
01:51:03,530 --> 01:51:04,870
this girl worked the front desk,

3870
01:51:05,050 --> 01:51:05,351
she goes,

3871
01:51:05,351 --> 01:51:05,730
I heard,

3872
01:51:05,730 --> 01:51:06,910
saw this comedian last night.

3873
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:08,430
He got a fucking see him,

3874
01:51:08,431 --> 01:51:09,700
who's the most amazing comedian?

3875
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:12,520
He did this joke about gay people,

3876
01:51:12,521 --> 01:51:14,050
fucking dead people.

3877
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:15,820
Yo Do know that bit.

3878
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:16,260
Not,

3879
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:16,781
don't know that,

3880
01:51:16,781 --> 01:51:18,760
but just sentence is 20 years old.

3881
01:51:19,330 --> 01:51:19,870
What's that?

3882
01:51:19,870 --> 01:51:20,560
That sentence?

3883
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:21,393
A 20 year old,

3884
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:24,190
you just said he did his
bit about gay people.

3885
01:51:24,191 --> 01:51:25,740
Fuck a so yeah.

3886
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:30,160
Motherfuck couldn't even probably try
to think about saying that on stage now

3887
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:30,851
Brian,

3888
01:51:30,851 --> 01:51:32,270
it'd be a rough rough,

3889
01:51:32,410 --> 01:51:33,370
but the way he said it,

3890
01:51:33,371 --> 01:51:34,390
the way Kinison said it,

3891
01:51:34,391 --> 01:51:34,541
you know,

3892
01:51:34,541 --> 01:51:35,410
she saw me,

3893
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:39,460
I went and got it on VHS
after that to watch it.

3894
01:51:39,550 --> 01:51:40,001
It was dealt,

3895
01:51:40,001 --> 01:51:44,620
but she was lying on her stomach in the
parking lot to pretend to be a dead body

3896
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:46,990
because what had happened
was he's homosexual nature,

3897
01:51:47,020 --> 01:51:47,920
the Kennison bit,

3898
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:48,881
he's homosexual.

3899
01:51:48,881 --> 01:51:53,410
Necrophilia Jakks we're paying money to
have a little bit of time undisturbed,

3900
01:51:53,460 --> 01:51:54,730
the freshest male corpse.

3901
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:57,790
So Kennison lifestyle
on stage and he's going,

3902
01:51:57,791 --> 01:52:00,030
you imagine that undisturbed commander,

3903
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:01,990
he's always lying down
on stage and he's like,

3904
01:52:01,991 --> 01:52:02,321
wow,

3905
01:52:02,321 --> 01:52:03,250
I can't believe this.

3906
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:07,480
I guess I'm a Guy gonna go
to heaven and be with Jesus.

3907
01:52:07,481 --> 01:52:08,560
And uh,

3908
01:52:08,570 --> 01:52:09,403
wow.

3909
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:14,270
It feels like so much
fucking made me call.

3910
01:52:14,450 --> 01:52:14,670
Hi.

3911
01:52:14,670 --> 01:52:16,200
Be like huge fucking this.

3912
01:52:16,201 --> 01:52:18,390
Even after your dad never ends,

3913
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:19,350
it never ends.

3914
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:21,750
So I'm watching this girl who's
like this volleyball player,

3915
01:52:21,751 --> 01:52:23,130
this big athletic girl,

3916
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:27,630
and she's got her body down
on the ground and she's,

3917
01:52:27,631 --> 01:52:28,620
she's yelling out,

3918
01:52:28,710 --> 01:52:29,161
oh,

3919
01:52:29,161 --> 01:52:29,994
don't recreate.

3920
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:30,511
She's like,

3921
01:52:30,511 --> 01:52:32,730
live keeps fucking in the
ass even after you're dead.

3922
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:33,773
It never ends.

3923
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,290
And I was laughing so hard
at what she was saying.

3924
01:52:37,490 --> 01:52:39,500
I went out and got the VHS tape.

3925
01:52:39,530 --> 01:52:40,490
Did it meet your stay?

3926
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:40,940
Did you,

3927
01:52:40,940 --> 01:52:41,750
did you,

3928
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:42,800
did you like just blown away?

3929
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:43,491
I was blown away.

3930
01:52:43,491 --> 01:52:44,111
I couldn't believe it.

3931
01:52:44,111 --> 01:52:45,680
He's calm energy man

3932
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:47,500
is a different kind of complex.

3933
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:47,870
Yeah.

3934
01:52:47,870 --> 01:52:52,430
It didn't like you think
know he was really loud but
then he was loud but he was

3935
01:52:52,431 --> 01:52:53,660
saying shit just like that bit.

3936
01:52:53,690 --> 01:52:56,240
You don't have your prayer has
to be to even think of that shit.

3937
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:58,190
Do you know he shared
something with Roseanne Barr?

3938
01:52:58,940 --> 01:52:59,773
Brain injury,

3939
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:01,190
really brain injury,

3940
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:02,990
personality change in brain injury.

3941
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:04,960
Both of how he'd get cars.

3942
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:06,210
Both of them are hit by cars.

3943
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:06,980
How it happened.

3944
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:07,610
Both of them.

3945
01:53:07,610 --> 01:53:07,970
Yeah.

3946
01:53:07,970 --> 01:53:08,803
Same thing.

3947
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:12,000
I mean don't hit your kid with a car and
hope they turn out to be a committee.

3948
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:13,300
Do you?

3949
01:53:13,300 --> 01:53:14,600
Don't think you're funny,

3950
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:15,493
Eh,

3951
01:53:17,030 --> 01:53:17,811
with Rosanne,

3952
01:53:17,811 --> 01:53:20,150
she was in a mental
institute for nine months,

3953
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:21,021
you know,

3954
01:53:21,021 --> 01:53:24,620
and with Kennison they said there was
an abrupt change between who he was and

3955
01:53:24,621 --> 01:53:25,311
who he became.

3956
01:53:25,311 --> 01:53:29,840
He got hit by that car and then from
then on he was this wild reckless,

3957
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:33,770
don't give a fuck guy and
this ranting raging preacher.

3958
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,200
But it turned out to be good for oh yeah,

3959
01:53:36,410 --> 01:53:37,160
the dark side.

3960
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:37,993
The dark side is,

3961
01:53:38,350 --> 01:53:39,320
and from Roseanne.

3962
01:53:39,410 --> 01:53:40,430
It's good for her too.

3963
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:40,851
You know?

3964
01:53:40,851 --> 01:53:41,320
And then you,

3965
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:42,800
I be done now we haven't heard.

3966
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:44,001
How's that show?

3967
01:53:44,001 --> 01:53:44,870
Don't her spinoff?

3968
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,793
Is it doing good?

3969
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:47,150
I don't think it's doing that good.

3970
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:48,590
I think it's dropping off.

3971
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:51,740
Lou Roseanne is in my opinion,

3972
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:55,640
like having a person with a broken leg
and expecting them to kept keep up on a

3973
01:53:55,641 --> 01:53:56,474
hike.

3974
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:57,210
She's got,

3975
01:53:57,210 --> 01:53:58,310
she's got brain issues.

3976
01:53:58,311 --> 01:54:00,920
She's heavily medicated and you know,

3977
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:04,100
Adderall and marijuana and
all these different things.

3978
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:06,590
There's a lot of shit that's
fucking with her head,

3979
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:07,431
you know?

3980
01:54:07,431 --> 01:54:08,330
And they,

3981
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:10,520
they kind of knew that when
they're making that show.

3982
01:54:10,521 --> 01:54:11,750
I really think they did.

3983
01:54:11,870 --> 01:54:13,010
I really think they knew that,

3984
01:54:13,970 --> 01:54:14,960
but they'll roll a dice.

3985
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:15,883
Yeah.

3986
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:21,190
But it's also one of those things where
like there's lovable parts about that

3987
01:54:21,261 --> 01:54:24,650
show because of the fact
that she's kind of loony,

3988
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:25,280
you know?

3989
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:28,380
And she's self admittedly loony and self,

3990
01:54:28,381 --> 01:54:30,500
admittedly dedicated Trey man,

3991
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:32,990
the most interesting
person is a train wreck.

3992
01:54:33,710 --> 01:54:34,290
It's true the most.

3993
01:54:34,290 --> 01:54:37,700
It was the person to watch somebody you
think you could probably do better or

3994
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,050
smarter than her does.

3995
01:54:39,051 --> 01:54:39,710
Also,

3996
01:54:39,710 --> 01:54:42,890
we'd like when successful
people have a giant major flaw,

3997
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:44,060
like a brain injury,

3998
01:54:44,061 --> 01:54:45,920
whether it makes them a ramble about shit,

3999
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:46,750
you know,

4000
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:47,091
I don't know.

4001
01:54:47,091 --> 01:54:47,924
I'll push for that,

4002
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:49,371
but you know what I'm saying?

4003
01:54:49,371 --> 01:54:51,350
Like so like levers with no brain.

4004
01:54:52,410 --> 01:54:53,180
But yeah,

4005
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:53,990
who comes a needle?

4006
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:54,950
The needle comes out.

4007
01:54:54,951 --> 01:54:57,320
It's shit like inject full for Kennison.

4008
01:54:57,321 --> 01:54:58,380
Like Kennison was a,

4009
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,260
he was a groundbreaking comedian.

4010
01:55:00,620 --> 01:55:02,120
Like when I remember seeing him,

4011
01:55:02,121 --> 01:55:04,610
and obviously I was only
like 18 or 19 at the time,

4012
01:55:04,820 --> 01:55:06,290
but I remember seeing him being like,

4013
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:06,651
oh,

4014
01:55:06,651 --> 01:55:08,210
I didn't even know that this was comedy.

4015
01:55:08,211 --> 01:55:09,280
I didn't know you could do that.

4016
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:10,760
It was a totally different,

4017
01:55:10,761 --> 01:55:11,090
yeah,

4018
01:55:11,090 --> 01:55:12,050
he didn't give a shit.

4019
01:55:12,650 --> 01:55:14,750
He did a show where he would call up,

4020
01:55:14,751 --> 01:55:15,860
he would have a phone,

4021
01:55:16,070 --> 01:55:17,660
he would have asked some
guy in the audience,

4022
01:55:17,661 --> 01:55:19,520
if your heart was ever broken by a girl,

4023
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:20,361
and the guy would say,

4024
01:55:20,361 --> 01:55:20,811
me,

4025
01:55:20,811 --> 01:55:21,530
what happened?

4026
01:55:21,530 --> 01:55:22,363
Tell me what happened.

4027
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:23,331
And he goes,

4028
01:55:23,331 --> 01:55:23,601
well,

4029
01:55:23,601 --> 01:55:24,434
she fucked my,

4030
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:26,330
she left me.

4031
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:26,811
He's like,

4032
01:55:26,811 --> 01:55:27,644
God dammit,

4033
01:55:27,730 --> 01:55:28,563
give this pictures.

4034
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:30,230
And he would get on the stage.

4035
01:55:30,231 --> 01:55:30,470
Hey,

4036
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:31,303
hey Marcy.

4037
01:55:31,330 --> 01:55:32,800
Oh yeah,

4038
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:33,141
I'm here.

4039
01:55:33,141 --> 01:55:34,280
Your ex boyfriend Tom,

4040
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:35,233
this is Sam.

4041
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:35,561
Fuck.

4042
01:55:35,561 --> 01:55:36,394
You'd said,

4043
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:36,670
yeah,

4044
01:55:36,670 --> 01:55:37,560
we've done a phone.

4045
01:55:37,590 --> 01:55:38,780
It would scream at this light.

4046
01:55:38,781 --> 01:55:39,880
And they had her over speakers.

4047
01:55:39,881 --> 01:55:40,161
She's like,

4048
01:55:40,161 --> 01:55:40,700
what?

4049
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:41,533
What the fuck?

4050
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:44,250
They be screaming fucking hard

4051
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:46,040
man.

4052
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:47,520
And his telephone,

4053
01:55:47,521 --> 01:55:48,540
it was chaos.

4054
01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:49,231
Oh Man.

4055
01:55:49,231 --> 01:55:50,610
I would love to see that man.

4056
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:52,410
I saw that working.

4057
01:55:52,710 --> 01:55:57,090
I was working as a security guard at
great center for the Performing Arts.

4058
01:55:57,091 --> 01:55:58,750
I got to see it while it was,

4059
01:55:58,770 --> 01:56:02,980
I paid for it there once I got
to see him live three times.

4060
01:56:02,981 --> 01:56:03,300
Right.

4061
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:04,230
I didn't see the special,

4062
01:56:04,231 --> 01:56:06,760
but I saw him perform live at
the comedy store or something.

4063
01:56:06,761 --> 01:56:07,280
I don't know.

4064
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:07,471
No.

4065
01:56:07,471 --> 01:56:11,550
Is it a big ass amphitheatre you imagine
how it felt to see he'll work the,

4066
01:56:11,570 --> 01:56:13,020
or oh my God.

4067
01:56:14,370 --> 01:56:15,020
Fuck by.

4068
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:16,260
Be Out in the hallway and shit.

4069
01:56:16,261 --> 01:56:19,590
Trying to peek in that row started
getting tight as a motherfucker.

4070
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:22,890
He was so powerful and funny looking,

4071
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:23,551
you know,

4072
01:56:23,551 --> 01:56:24,510
like everything about him,

4073
01:56:24,511 --> 01:56:27,550
the baret in the fucking
child molester jacket.

4074
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:29,520
I don't say if it's set to standards,

4075
01:56:29,521 --> 01:56:32,620
but it was like everybody
wanted to be too loud,

4076
01:56:32,630 --> 01:56:35,040
fit loud fat guy with the crazy hair.

4077
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:35,371
Yeah.

4078
01:56:35,371 --> 01:56:37,030
There was a little bit
of that after that he,

4079
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:39,630
he opened up a door for
something that people loved.

4080
01:56:39,930 --> 01:56:40,740
They loved.

4081
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:43,140
There's something about him that was like,

4082
01:56:43,141 --> 01:56:46,200
you knew that he was
like genetically fucked.

4083
01:56:46,590 --> 01:56:46,981
You know,

4084
01:56:46,981 --> 01:56:47,431
it wasn't,

4085
01:56:47,431 --> 01:56:49,470
it wasn't a good specimen of manhood,

4086
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:54,000
but he was angry and smart
and confident and fucking,

4087
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:56,340
and he would talk about all that.

4088
01:56:56,550 --> 01:56:57,090
And you make,

4089
01:56:57,090 --> 01:56:57,421
you know,

4090
01:56:57,421 --> 01:57:00,950
the part of the fact that it was
physically vulnerable was part of what,

4091
01:57:00,951 --> 01:57:01,200
what,

4092
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:06,200
what made him funny and he
would just off the chain.

4093
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:06,991
Yeah.

4094
01:57:06,991 --> 01:57:07,111
Well,

4095
01:57:07,111 --> 01:57:08,100
the funny thing is about,

4096
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:12,090
he had some hilarious
bits about being married,

4097
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:13,350
about the devil coming up too.

4098
01:57:13,351 --> 01:57:13,861
When you're married.

4099
01:57:13,861 --> 01:57:14,120
Ah,

4100
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:14,310
AH,

4101
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:15,130
you've been married.

4102
01:57:15,130 --> 01:57:16,460
Oh No,

4103
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,600
this is even gonna be scary for you.

4104
01:57:18,770 --> 01:57:19,180
I go,

4105
01:57:19,180 --> 01:57:20,030
here's where we talked to the,

4106
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:20,873
so

4107
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:23,740
it would be he,

4108
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:25,170
he had this shit where he's like,

4109
01:57:25,190 --> 01:57:25,860
he goes,

4110
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:26,431
look at my face,

4111
01:57:26,431 --> 01:57:26,980
look at my face.

4112
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:27,340
Oh,

4113
01:57:27,340 --> 01:57:28,173
oh.

4114
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:28,441
He goes,

4115
01:57:28,441 --> 01:57:30,330
I've been married twice

4116
01:57:30,650 --> 01:57:31,680
and you can't even try.

4117
01:57:31,681 --> 01:57:34,060
What is Joe's while doing
his voice now you can,

4118
01:57:35,950 --> 01:57:40,030
you can do Seinfeld and you
kind of do you to be here.

4119
01:57:40,031 --> 01:57:42,310
Somebody do they voice even
yell a little bit like,

4120
01:57:42,311 --> 01:57:42,671
all right,

4121
01:57:42,671 --> 01:57:43,570
calm down Sam.

4122
01:57:43,571 --> 01:57:44,110
Kinison.

4123
01:57:44,110 --> 01:57:44,943
Exactly.

4124
01:57:46,090 --> 01:57:46,923
Oh

4125
01:57:48,690 --> 01:57:49,523
Wow.

4126
01:57:49,930 --> 01:57:50,141
Yeah.

4127
01:57:50,141 --> 01:57:50,974
He had some,

4128
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:53,380
he had some groundbreaking shit where you,

4129
01:57:53,381 --> 01:57:56,080
you watch it and it was all
like you were on a ride,

4130
01:57:56,410 --> 01:57:58,690
like all the sudden there
was this new thing going on.

4131
01:57:59,170 --> 01:58:00,880
What's this our Saturday night live?

4132
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:02,410
I don't think so.

4133
01:58:02,770 --> 01:58:03,250
No,

4134
01:58:03,250 --> 01:58:04,090
I don't think so.

4135
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:05,590
It was a total shut up.

4136
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:06,573
He would have.

4137
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:08,470
They banned him from a lot of things.

4138
01:58:08,471 --> 01:58:10,990
By the time we got to a certain
stage and his comedy career,

4139
01:58:10,991 --> 01:58:13,040
there was certain subjects and certain,

4140
01:58:13,530 --> 01:58:15,490
you know his bit about aids.

4141
01:58:15,491 --> 01:58:17,510
It was so ruthless and
it was like you guys do.

4142
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:18,071
Then he goes,

4143
01:58:18,071 --> 01:58:19,420
everybody says age shouldn't make fun.

4144
01:58:19,421 --> 01:58:20,254
Eight Sam,

4145
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,060
it's communicable disease.

4146
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:23,610
He'll straight people get it till he goes,

4147
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:24,613
hey ma

4148
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:28,980
something.

4149
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:29,970
I remember hearing that going,

4150
01:58:30,010 --> 01:58:31,170
Whoa,

4151
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:32,790
Whoa,

4152
01:58:32,790 --> 01:58:33,361
fuck you.

4153
01:58:33,361 --> 01:58:34,620
It's not our dance.

4154
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:35,310
I'm like,

4155
01:58:35,310 --> 01:58:36,510
oh my God.

4156
01:58:37,170 --> 01:58:37,680
And uh,

4157
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:40,440
there was certain bits like
that where people like cut.

4158
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:42,453
Yeah.

4159
01:58:42,810 --> 01:58:45,700
It would be like comedy police everywhere.

4160
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:46,121
I mean,

4161
01:58:46,121 --> 01:58:48,100
so much of his bits we're punching down.

4162
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:51,820
It was the argument that I got in with
the guy who wrote a book on comedy and he

4163
01:58:51,821 --> 01:58:54,040
was telling me the comedy
always has to punch up.

4164
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:54,821
And I said,

4165
01:58:54,821 --> 01:58:54,971
no,

4166
01:58:54,971 --> 01:58:55,541
it doesn't.

4167
01:58:55,541 --> 01:58:56,374
That's crazy.

4168
01:58:56,530 --> 01:58:56,771
I go,

4169
01:58:56,771 --> 01:58:58,990
Sam Kiss and had one of the
greatest bits of all time.

4170
01:58:58,991 --> 01:59:00,220
Two of the greatest bits of all time.

4171
01:59:00,430 --> 01:59:01,030
One,

4172
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:02,330
there was a dude who's getting

4173
01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:04,070
fucked in the ass after he was dead.

4174
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:05,973
Yeah.

4175
01:59:06,410 --> 01:59:11,390
Committee that nominated and
made that one of all times,

4176
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:12,780
but go ahead.

4177
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:16,050
And then the other one was the
bit about watching someone,

4178
01:59:16,051 --> 01:59:16,171
Oh,

4179
01:59:16,171 --> 01:59:17,010
this one burnt,

4180
01:59:17,130 --> 01:59:22,130
I lost the Asher and the other one was
a bit about us watching a commercial to

4181
01:59:23,670 --> 01:59:27,630
will you please donate money to feed
the starving children in Africa?

4182
01:59:27,810 --> 01:59:28,830
And he's saying,

4183
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:30,150
which just occurred to us,

4184
01:59:30,330 --> 01:59:30,721
you know,

4185
01:59:30,721 --> 01:59:33,210
like there wouldn't be
world hunger if you people

4186
01:59:33,330 --> 01:59:34,360
move where that photo,

4187
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:39,600
he has this horrible fucking joke and
there's a SARS punching down of all time.

4188
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:43,460
He's making fun of starving
children and it's so good.

4189
01:59:43,461 --> 01:59:44,400
It's just an observation.

4190
01:59:44,430 --> 01:59:45,950
I call it an observation and,

4191
01:59:46,100 --> 01:59:46,681
and he's like,

4192
01:59:46,681 --> 01:59:46,951
he goes,

4193
01:59:46,951 --> 01:59:47,280
hey,

4194
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:48,810
we got deserts in America too.

4195
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:49,770
We just don't live it.

4196
01:59:49,771 --> 01:59:50,640
I'm asshole.

4197
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:51,121
He goes,

4198
01:59:51,121 --> 01:59:51,954
don't send them food,

4199
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:52,950
sending you emails.

4200
01:59:53,170 --> 01:59:53,360
Send.

4201
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:54,360
I'm sounding like me.

4202
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:56,010
He's getting his,

4203
01:59:56,011 --> 01:59:59,460
he kept going to take you
where the food and they,

4204
01:59:59,461 --> 02:00:01,110
that's all they need to do is simple.

4205
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:02,860
He had a joke where he was saying,

4206
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:03,541
he literally saying,

4207
02:00:03,541 --> 02:00:03,990
see that,

4208
02:00:03,990 --> 02:00:04,680
see that.

4209
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:05,610
It's fucking sad.

4210
02:00:06,030 --> 02:00:10,740
No one's going to be a hundred years
from now fucking pack your kids cash.

4211
02:00:10,741 --> 02:00:13,010
We didn't take you where
the food is as fun.

4212
02:00:13,050 --> 02:00:17,250
You were crying and it was
the most ruthless and wrong
thing that anybody could

4213
02:00:17,251 --> 02:00:18,084
ever say.

4214
02:00:18,090 --> 02:00:20,700
You're talking about
starving children and it was,

4215
02:00:20,750 --> 02:00:22,260
you can manage down,

4216
02:00:22,261 --> 02:00:23,160
you can make it all work.

4217
02:00:23,250 --> 02:00:24,083
We can make it all work.

4218
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:25,020
He,

4219
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:27,720
you can hunt you down with
earthquake like effects.

4220
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:28,890
Boom.

4221
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:30,513
What a punch.

4222
02:00:30,780 --> 02:00:32,340
I probably killed it at
the end with a punch.

4223
02:00:32,790 --> 02:00:36,750
It was unbelievably funny and it was
one of the most punched down things you

4224
02:00:36,751 --> 02:00:37,584
could ever do.

4225
02:00:37,650 --> 02:00:39,600
He's making fun of starving babies.

4226
02:00:39,630 --> 02:00:40,570
I think it could be done.

4227
02:00:40,750 --> 02:00:42,180
You can make fun of anything.

4228
02:00:42,210 --> 02:00:42,900
It's just,

4229
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:45,030
we have to know that we
have to know two things.

4230
02:00:45,031 --> 02:00:45,271
One,

4231
02:00:45,271 --> 02:00:48,390
it's not really happening the way you're
saying it cause you're just joking and

4232
02:00:48,391 --> 02:00:49,224
it's comedy.

4233
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:52,020
It's a observation.

4234
02:00:52,230 --> 02:00:52,710
Yeah.

4235
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:57,150
Somebody said Donald can a joke be too
soon and I don't think it's a joke.

4236
02:00:57,151 --> 02:00:57,990
Could be too soon,

4237
02:00:58,260 --> 02:00:59,260
but it never could be too.

4238
02:00:59,261 --> 02:01:04,140
So for funny observation is the
observation that we say we can go,

4239
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:09,560
we could go to a fucking funeral being
up mother phone inside laughing like

4240
02:01:09,841 --> 02:01:10,640
crazy.

4241
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:11,040
Yeah.

4242
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:11,640
And everybody would go,

4243
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:12,473
going to tumble.

4244
02:01:12,590 --> 02:01:13,320
When will,

4245
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:15,930
I'll see you in heaven
when you go to heaven,

4246
02:01:16,290 --> 02:01:18,330
assuming that everybody's
going to go to heaven,

4247
02:01:19,110 --> 02:01:20,760
one of the best buy is
not going to go to heaven.

4248
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:22,080
One of the best lines,

4249
02:01:22,110 --> 02:01:25,680
one of the best one liners I
ever heard was from Dave Foley.

4250
02:01:25,950 --> 02:01:30,720
I was on news radio with Dave Foley and
after Phil Hartman and gotten murdered

4251
02:01:31,050 --> 02:01:33,270
by his wife and then his
wife committed suicide.

4252
02:01:33,450 --> 02:01:34,283
Yeah.

4253
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,810
He was up for an Emmy and Hartman was,

4254
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:37,231
yeah.

4255
02:01:37,231 --> 02:01:38,064
So we all wet,

4256
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:38,990
you know,

4257
02:01:38,990 --> 02:01:39,380
uh,

4258
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,040
and we all put

4259
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:43,240
on suits and shit and
went to the Emmy's and uh,

4260
02:01:43,740 --> 02:01:48,510

and day fully turns to look at us and

4261
02:01:48,511 --> 02:01:48,691
goes,

4262
02:01:48,691 --> 02:01:50,430
what the fuck's he have to do to win?

4263
02:01:51,540 --> 02:01:52,373
And we're just

4264
02:01:55,740 --> 02:02:00,740
one of those things in the moment are
murdered friend just lost at the Emmy's

4265
02:02:03,870 --> 02:02:08,790
and he turns to us and goes with the
fuck does he have to do to win and me and

4266
02:02:08,791 --> 02:02:09,451
Steven Rude,

4267
02:02:09,451 --> 02:02:12,240
we're falling down in
our chairs were like,

4268
02:02:12,241 --> 02:02:13,140
no,

4269
02:02:13,141 --> 02:02:14,190
you didn't.

4270
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:16,050
That's fuck a funny.

4271
02:02:16,051 --> 02:02:16,770
There's no,

4272
02:02:16,770 --> 02:02:18,060
there's no too soon.

4273
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:19,230
That's just not funny.

4274
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:21,890
Y'All motherfuckers say it's too soon.

4275
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:23,740
I'm like not always going to be,

4276
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:27,600
it's going to be too late because the
minute you're saying it's too soon,

4277
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:29,970
somebody is bug jump on as shit.

4278
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:31,020
Exactly.

4279
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:32,640
Fucking exactly.

4280
02:02:32,940 --> 02:02:34,620
When you think about it,

4281
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:36,330
that's what he has to go down.

4282
02:02:36,370 --> 02:02:40,530
I this why I have this bit about that
dude who was a visiting that uncontacted

4283
02:02:40,531 --> 02:02:44,600
tribe and trying to convert him to Jesus
and they shot him up with arrows and

4284
02:02:44,730 --> 02:02:49,080
say that it was an internet thing and
it's a story that's on the news and I made

4285
02:02:49,081 --> 02:02:50,670
sure I made fun of it that day.

4286
02:02:50,820 --> 02:02:51,660
The moment I read it,

4287
02:02:51,661 --> 02:02:52,494
I started writing.

4288
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:54,870
I not letting anybody out of this one.

4289
02:02:55,330 --> 02:02:58,770
I visited an uncontacted tribe
with bibles and then you're like,

4290
02:02:58,771 --> 02:02:58,981
this,

4291
02:02:58,981 --> 02:03:00,630
I got to go set tonight.

4292
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:02,100
Tonight's right now.

4293
02:03:02,101 --> 02:03:03,630
Right now I called up Adam,

4294
02:03:03,631 --> 02:03:03,931
I'll be like,

4295
02:03:03,931 --> 02:03:04,140
Yo,

4296
02:03:04,140 --> 02:03:05,430
you got to hook it up dude.

4297
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:06,481
I'm filled out.

4298
02:03:06,481 --> 02:03:08,040
I feel that way sometimes man.

4299
02:03:08,041 --> 02:03:08,461
It's like,

4300
02:03:08,461 --> 02:03:08,941
fuck it,

4301
02:03:08,941 --> 02:03:09,774
I'm going for it.

4302
02:03:10,140 --> 02:03:12,210
Sometimes you just have
to jump on something.

4303
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:14,133
If it doesn't

4304
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:17,030
make my stomach rumble a little bit,

4305
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:18,350
a little uncomfortable,

4306
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:19,430
it's,

4307
02:03:19,430 --> 02:03:20,263
it's like,

4308
02:03:20,420 --> 02:03:21,920
it's funny but it's not like,

4309
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:22,491
you know,

4310
02:03:22,491 --> 02:03:23,930
it's not your gut funny.

4311
02:03:23,931 --> 02:03:25,160
I want my gut to be happy.

4312
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:25,701
You don't want,

4313
02:03:25,701 --> 02:03:28,160
one thing that I think
we should really say is,

4314
02:03:28,161 --> 02:03:28,640
uh,

4315
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:33,640
we should really thank all the real comedy
club fans that are still coming out.

4316
02:03:34,341 --> 02:03:38,630
And one of the things that we're not
getting what guys like you and me perform

4317
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:41,780
wild people when we perform
in front of comedy clubs,

4318
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:42,480
when I can,

4319
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:43,220
a lot of pushback,

4320
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:43,431
man,

4321
02:03:43,431 --> 02:03:44,720
we're getting a lot of good crowds,

4322
02:03:44,780 --> 02:03:45,470
man.

4323
02:03:45,470 --> 02:03:47,660
It's great crowds and they want to,

4324
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:51,600
they want to hear that fucking voicemail.

4325
02:03:51,610 --> 02:03:52,820
And I hear that crazy shit

4326
02:03:54,490 --> 02:03:55,480
like with me,

4327
02:03:55,880 --> 02:03:58,240
it's weird because like I'll do shelves,

4328
02:03:58,250 --> 02:04:01,820
I'll do like an improv saying
and Cleveland some shit
and then I'll have a sold

4329
02:04:01,821 --> 02:04:03,060
out show and I'm still club.

4330
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:05,630
I dabbled willow theaters unless
I'm with a group of people,

4331
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:06,860
whatever.

4332
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:07,251
And I was like,

4333
02:04:07,251 --> 02:04:08,660
how many people follow me on social media?

4334
02:04:08,661 --> 02:04:12,860
And it's like out of a room of
like 500 it'll be like four people.

4335
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:13,911
And I'm like,

4336
02:04:13,911 --> 02:04:14,121
wow,

4337
02:04:14,121 --> 02:04:14,954
that's fucked up.

4338
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:17,960
But the thing is the
show is still sold out,

4339
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:18,681
you know,

4340
02:04:18,681 --> 02:04:20,810
so it's not followers.

4341
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:23,060
I really believe I have real fans,

4342
02:04:23,550 --> 02:04:24,350
you know,

4343
02:04:24,350 --> 02:04:25,310
like people that,

4344
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:29,510
whether it's through Instagram
doesn't have to be there,

4345
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:30,680
but they notice dude,

4346
02:04:30,681 --> 02:04:31,514
they want to see them.

4347
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:32,780
And also the best shit,

4348
02:04:32,781 --> 02:04:34,850
the crowd that comes
out to see you for sure.

4349
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:36,190
100% you know,

4350
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:38,160
it's one thing and we can't

4351
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:38,971
take anything for granted.

4352
02:04:38,971 --> 02:04:43,770
It's one thing to like go up like at a
night at the comedy store where you know

4353
02:04:43,771 --> 02:04:44,970
it's gonna be a million comics,

4354
02:04:44,971 --> 02:04:45,181
you know,

4355
02:04:45,181 --> 02:04:46,320
it's going to be everybody in the stage.

4356
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:50,490
You know you've got to and this
another thing and you perform it,

4357
02:04:50,491 --> 02:04:54,120
but it's another thing knowing when the
people that are there are there just to

4358
02:04:54,121 --> 02:04:54,954
see you,

4359
02:04:54,980 --> 02:04:56,430
you know when they make a weekend of it,

4360
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:57,750
you know that's dope.

4361
02:04:58,380 --> 02:04:59,070
It is.

4362
02:04:59,070 --> 02:04:59,820
It is.

4363
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:01,260
It's a great responsibility too,

4364
02:05:01,261 --> 02:05:01,800
right?

4365
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:02,633
Yeah.

4366
02:05:02,850 --> 02:05:04,580
But you're married to it but,

4367
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:05,593
but when it's,

4368
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:08,580
when it's like your only
option for the most part,

4369
02:05:08,581 --> 02:05:09,570
that's all I do now.

4370
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:10,201
You know?

4371
02:05:10,201 --> 02:05:11,640
So it's good.

4372
02:05:12,090 --> 02:05:12,391
Yeah.

4373
02:05:12,391 --> 02:05:14,520
But it's your hair care and
control your own destiny,

4374
02:05:14,521 --> 02:05:14,820
man.

4375
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:17,190
I just think the only thing
you missed since the podcast,

4376
02:05:17,980 --> 02:05:19,620
your podcast where you gigantic.

4377
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:20,670
I think I want to do it,

4378
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:21,713
John,

4379
02:05:21,890 --> 02:05:22,970
you have to do it.

4380
02:05:23,370 --> 02:05:24,203
I'm telling you.

4381
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:26,400
He tells me like we'll be talking to,

4382
02:05:26,401 --> 02:05:27,234
he'll be like,

4383
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:27,870
son,

4384
02:05:27,870 --> 02:05:28,440
where are you gonna do?

4385
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:29,940
I said I'm doing Joe Rogan's podcast.

4386
02:05:29,941 --> 02:05:30,241
He was like,

4387
02:05:30,241 --> 02:05:30,421
yeah,

4388
02:05:30,421 --> 02:05:33,900
but sun when you going to do yours you
need to do one like you're so good at

4389
02:05:33,901 --> 02:05:34,734
this.

4390
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:36,030
Let's set it up.

4391
02:05:36,090 --> 02:05:37,430

Yup.

02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:41,753
I like it.

4395
02:05:42,030 --> 02:05:42,863
I like it.

4396
02:05:43,050 --> 02:05:43,650
That's it.

4397
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:44,483
That's the name.

4398
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:47,000
Lock it up someone by too soon.

4399
02:05:47,001 --> 02:05:47,834

Don't be a dick.

4401
02:05:49,270 --> 02:05:50,103

That's where you're going to tell people.

4405
02:06:01,441 --> 02:06:01,621
Yeah.

4406
02:06:01,621 --> 02:06:03,240
You mean uncle pay pal?

4407
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:06,570
You can't say paypal is a
sponsor of this podcast.

4408
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:07,433
It is cash app.

4409
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:09,570
It's is shit but pauses cash.

4410
02:06:09,590 --> 02:06:10,710
Happy for anything.

4411
02:06:10,830 --> 02:06:12,670
They will not pass.

4412
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:13,650
You can't say paypal.

4413
02:06:13,651 --> 02:06:15,450
You got this cash app but I said it.

4414
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:16,613
It's like saying,

4415
02:06:16,620 --> 02:06:18,420
oh Joe's coming over guys.

4416
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:19,231

4418
02:06:21,210 --> 02:06:22,860
Pay Pal's great for buying things online.

4419
02:06:22,890 --> 02:06:23,723
You don't use it.

4420
02:06:23,890 --> 02:06:24,723
Yeah,

4421
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:26,220
but it's got the cool shit.

4422
02:06:26,790 --> 02:06:27,331
Cash apps.

4423
02:06:27,331 --> 02:06:28,164
The cool.

4424
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:29,750
I'll cash app yet.

4425
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:31,650
I have a cash app I think too.

4426
02:06:31,770 --> 02:06:32,603
I'll do that.

4427
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:33,451
I want to do one.

4428
02:06:33,451 --> 02:06:35,100
I got to do it too soon with Darnell.

4429
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:36,450
I got to do it this year.

4430
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:38,730
You should get it tomorrow.

4431
02:06:38,790 --> 02:06:40,120
You should literally do it tomorrow,

4432
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:41,320
man.

4433
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:42,120
Yeah.

4434
02:06:42,120 --> 02:06:42,331
Yeah.

4435
02:06:42,331 --> 02:06:42,990
For Real.

4436
02:06:42,990 --> 02:06:43,823
You really good at it.

4437
02:06:44,550 --> 02:06:45,383
It'd be great.

4438
02:06:45,630 --> 02:06:46,620
I'm going to stay natural.

4439
02:06:46,621 --> 02:06:47,880
It doesn't even make
sense that you're not.

4440
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:49,710
I'd be honored to help.

4441
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:51,031
I want to do it.

4442
02:06:51,031 --> 02:06:51,480
Let's do it.

4443
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:52,860
I've got a podcast mother fucker.

4444
02:06:52,861 --> 02:06:54,060
Why not fuck with the podcast,

4445
02:06:54,140 --> 02:06:54,650
motherfucker.

4446
02:06:54,650 --> 02:06:55,350
I uh,

4447
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:59,480
I try to do what Yo podcast,

4448
02:07:00,150 --> 02:07:01,500
you are the king of the podcast,

4449
02:07:01,530 --> 02:07:02,430
but I got lucky.

4450
02:07:02,580 --> 02:07:03,301
I got in early,

4451
02:07:03,301 --> 02:07:06,690
but I love podcasts and I know
I would love to listen to yours.

4452
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:07,740
I'm going to do it part.

4453
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:08,790
It sounds like a love fest.

4454
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:10,530
I'm going to do a park.

4455
02:07:10,531 --> 02:07:12,210
You 100% should do a podcast.

4456
02:07:12,220 --> 02:07:13,980
It will a hundred percent be gigantic.

4457
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:18,600
I guarantee your podcast would be like
number one in iTunes within another

4458
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:18,840
couple of months.

4459
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:19,673
100%,

4460
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:23,880
a hundred percent probably
the first episode because
the top people want to hear

4461
02:07:23,881 --> 02:07:24,031
it.

4462
02:07:24,031 --> 02:07:24,864
And so how would I,

4463
02:07:25,650 --> 02:07:26,610
how do I launch it?

4464
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:27,480
I'll let you back.

4465
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:27,840
Um,

4466
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:28,441
well I'll,

4467
02:07:28,441 --> 02:07:29,370
I'll tweet it for you.

4468
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:31,140
You tell me when you're doing it.

4469
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:32,610
I'll put it on Instagram for you.

4470
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:36,040
Jamille help you find a way to set it up.

4471
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:39,700
Just get you either with a
microphone and a friend or you know,

4472
02:07:39,701 --> 02:07:41,020
another comedian or whatever.

4473
02:07:41,210 --> 02:07:44,680
These things are important to engage
with other people or can you do it?

4474
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:46,870
Bill bird does it entirely on his own.

4475
02:07:46,871 --> 02:07:50,890
It's amazing are you should fear does
some of the best shit he ever does on his

4476
02:07:50,891 --> 02:07:53,710
own or he has these
like long introductions.

4477
02:07:53,711 --> 02:07:57,940
Hill of a podcast is two hours but as
introduction as an hour and it's just

4478
02:07:57,941 --> 02:08:01,020
already talking shit and it's some of
my favorite stuff that he does delete.

4479
02:08:01,050 --> 02:08:02,580
It does it by himself to deleted.

4480
02:08:02,590 --> 02:08:07,540
And Theo Theo knows to buy himself a
lot of people do them by themselves.

4481
02:08:07,630 --> 02:08:07,850
You know,

4482
02:08:07,850 --> 02:08:09,220
I need to do what I really need to do one.

4483
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:10,000
Well you,

4484
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,740
you're really funny with other people.

4485
02:08:12,070 --> 02:08:14,470
I mean if you could probably
be just as funny by yourself,

4486
02:08:14,471 --> 02:08:15,304
but you're really,

4487
02:08:15,370 --> 02:08:17,200
you're a funny due to interact with,

4488
02:08:17,710 --> 02:08:17,981
you know,

4489
02:08:17,981 --> 02:08:22,000
like I think you and another
person would be great and you know,

4490
02:08:22,001 --> 02:08:24,840
you could just have a friend
that's also a comedian.

4491
02:08:24,860 --> 02:08:25,693
The two you just start,

4492
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:26,980
you don't have to have guests.

4493
02:08:27,340 --> 02:08:30,610
You could just be talking shit about
things that are going on in the news or

4494
02:08:30,611 --> 02:08:31,930
talking shit about life.

4495
02:08:31,931 --> 02:08:32,980
We're talking shit about,

4496
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:33,611
you know,

4497
02:08:33,611 --> 02:08:34,810
any pick a subject,

4498
02:08:34,811 --> 02:08:36,890
you could have Q and A's from the crowd.

4499
02:08:36,891 --> 02:08:41,290
They could ask you questions through email
and you can read out those questions.

4500
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:42,393
Why not man,

4501
02:08:42,490 --> 02:08:44,770
I have to do one a hundred percent.

4502
02:08:44,771 --> 02:08:45,471
It's been calling me.

4503
02:08:45,471 --> 02:08:45,810
I know.

4504
02:08:45,810 --> 02:08:47,380
Let me help you with it.

4505
02:08:47,470 --> 02:08:47,890
All right.

4506
02:08:47,890 --> 02:08:48,101
I mean,

4507
02:08:48,101 --> 02:08:49,000
how would I turn that down?

4508
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:50,080
You can't,

4509
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:50,913
we're in,

4510
02:08:51,310 --> 02:08:51,820
she said,

4511
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:53,950
we look like the black and
white version of each other.

4512
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:54,963
Thank you.

4513
02:08:55,120 --> 02:08:55,953
I don't know what,

4514
02:08:55,990 --> 02:08:57,670
I don't even know what to say about that,

4515
02:08:57,671 --> 02:08:59,710
but it does look like a lights light me.

4516
02:09:00,430 --> 02:09:01,240
That's hilarious.

4517
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:02,230
I got a pest.

4518
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:03,010
Fun.

4519
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:04,880
I guarantee you I have
way more neanderthal.

4520
02:09:05,410 --> 02:09:09,220
I've 50% 7% more neanderthal
and the average person,

4521
02:09:09,230 --> 02:09:10,020
motherfucker,

4522
02:09:10,020 --> 02:09:10,450
that ain't,

4523
02:09:10,450 --> 02:09:12,250
that's not as hard as it seems,

4524
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:13,570
especially if you have a rifle,

4525
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:15,790
but you still got to focus.

4526
02:09:16,890 --> 02:09:17,710
Yeah.

4527
02:09:17,710 --> 02:09:18,850
For rifle you do.

4528
02:09:18,851 --> 02:09:19,840
But for a bow and Arrow,

4529
02:09:19,841 --> 02:09:21,130
that's when you really have to focus.

4530
02:09:21,190 --> 02:09:21,710
But it's,

4531
02:09:21,710 --> 02:09:22,543
um,

4532
02:09:23,610 --> 02:09:24,910
I just immediately here.

4533
02:09:29,050 --> 02:09:29,860
Um,

4534
02:09:29,860 --> 02:09:31,000
but it's an honest way to get meat.

4535
02:09:31,001 --> 02:09:31,834
You know,

4536
02:09:32,110 --> 02:09:33,390
I think like it's taught
like you know what?

4537
02:09:33,450 --> 02:09:33,701
Look,

4538
02:09:33,701 --> 02:09:35,680
there's a honest way to earn new jokes.

4539
02:09:36,130 --> 02:09:37,980
This is the honest way to do standup.

4540
02:09:37,981 --> 02:09:39,130
Does an honest way to get meat.

4541
02:09:39,290 --> 02:09:40,390
I don't think everybody should do it.

4542
02:09:40,391 --> 02:09:41,224
You shouldn't have to,

4543
02:09:41,350 --> 02:09:42,350
shouldn't want to win.

4544
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:45,010
A lot of people wouldn't if
you told the average person,

4545
02:09:45,630 --> 02:09:46,120
all right,

4546
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:51,120
you want chicken and just show him like
six Hinz alive and it was like you went

4547
02:09:51,731 --> 02:09:52,564
chicken.

4548
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:53,673
There you go.

4549
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:57,850
That motherfucking chicken where rock
before motherfucker was able to skin it

4550
02:09:59,190 --> 02:10:00,280
and do whatever they do to him.

4551
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:02,170
But that's just how we're being raised.

4552
02:10:02,470 --> 02:10:04,090
It's a denial issue.

4553
02:10:04,210 --> 02:10:05,590
It's not a reality issue.

4554
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:08,500
Cause the reality is we're
still eating animals like crazy.

4555
02:10:08,770 --> 02:10:10,420
The denial is no one's killing them.

4556
02:10:10,570 --> 02:10:11,410
There's like a tiny,

4557
02:10:11,411 --> 02:10:11,771
tiny,

4558
02:10:11,771 --> 02:10:12,131
tiny,

4559
02:10:12,131 --> 02:10:12,491
tiny,

4560
02:10:12,491 --> 02:10:14,260
tiny got to get somebody
to do your dirty work.

4561
02:10:14,410 --> 02:10:15,071
Exactly.

4562
02:10:15,071 --> 02:10:16,780
So because someone's
doing your dirty work,

4563
02:10:16,781 --> 02:10:17,740
you don't think it's dirty,

4564
02:10:18,460 --> 02:10:20,500
but everybody's went,

4565
02:10:20,570 --> 02:10:23,560
this is how this is the shit
to get vegans caught out there.

4566
02:10:23,690 --> 02:10:24,310
Yeah.

4567
02:10:24,310 --> 02:10:27,610
This conversation will turn them
off into a Vegan a little bit.

4568
02:10:28,330 --> 02:10:28,840
There's something.

4569
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:29,471
This does.

4570
02:10:29,471 --> 02:10:29,711
Look,

4571
02:10:29,711 --> 02:10:30,280
there's some,

4572
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:34,490
there's a reason why so many people except
veganism is because there's a lot of

4573
02:10:34,491 --> 02:10:36,040
really good points with a bill.

4574
02:10:36,140 --> 02:10:38,540
The biggest point is less animal cruelty.

4575
02:10:38,690 --> 02:10:39,860
You don't wanna see animal suffer.

4576
02:10:39,861 --> 02:10:41,150
I don't want to see animals suffer.

4577
02:10:41,390 --> 02:10:41,520
Yeah,

4578
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:41,961
but you know what?

4579
02:10:41,961 --> 02:10:42,990
I don't hear you.

4580
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:43,850
You are absolutely right,

4581
02:10:44,270 --> 02:10:49,270
but I don't hear people push
that side of it as much as the,

4582
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:52,393
the

4583
02:10:53,690 --> 02:10:55,910
dietary habits of it.

4584
02:10:56,220 --> 02:10:57,500
You know my side,

4585
02:10:57,501 --> 02:10:59,450
I hear like it's carrots in this,

4586
02:10:59,451 --> 02:11:00,380
but you don't hear about,

4587
02:11:00,381 --> 02:11:00,621
no,

4588
02:11:00,621 --> 02:11:01,610
it's more about the animals.

4589
02:11:01,820 --> 02:11:02,750
You know what it really is?

4590
02:11:02,751 --> 02:11:03,584
There's two things.

4591
02:11:03,790 --> 02:11:04,040
It's,

4592
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:06,290
it really is all about the
animals for a lot of them,

4593
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:11,450
and they're really right that it's better
than the standard American diet that

4594
02:11:11,470 --> 02:11:12,141
he eaten.

4595
02:11:12,141 --> 02:11:15,350
Vegan food and healthy
vegetable food all the time.

4596
02:11:15,590 --> 02:11:18,290
As long as you do it correctly is way
better than a standard American diet.

4597
02:11:18,850 --> 02:11:20,900
That's also like fish is good for you.

4598
02:11:21,350 --> 02:11:22,790
She says it's good for you.

4599
02:11:22,860 --> 02:11:25,040
Peace Salmon piece of
salmon is good for you.

4600
02:11:25,190 --> 02:11:26,120
Wild Salmon,

4601
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:27,400
that shit's really good for you.

4602
02:11:27,740 --> 02:11:28,340
Good for you.

4603
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:29,240
It is good for you.

4604
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:31,640
This idea that it's not good
for you is kind of crazy,

4605
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:33,380
like meat is good for you.

4606
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:35,720
The real problem is sugar and bullshit.

4607
02:11:35,810 --> 02:11:38,630
And when you guys got that sorted out
with the Vegan Diet and some people have

4608
02:11:38,631 --> 02:11:39,800
it sorted out with another diet,

4609
02:11:40,010 --> 02:11:41,630
the whole idea is to keep the poison out.

4610
02:11:41,690 --> 02:11:42,560
That's all it is.

4611
02:11:42,950 --> 02:11:44,210
They just get overzealous.

4612
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:47,960
And then when people have an idea of
something that they're doing that they

4613
02:11:47,961 --> 02:11:49,010
think everybody should do,

4614
02:11:49,011 --> 02:11:50,690
then they start telling
everybody they should do it.

4615
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:51,221
Yeah.

4616
02:11:51,221 --> 02:11:52,680
You don't want people to tell him.

4617
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:53,860
Then I listen dude.

4618
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:54,830
When I was a little kid,

4619
02:11:54,831 --> 02:11:55,700
it's like what the fuck?

4620
02:11:55,701 --> 02:11:56,534
And um,

4621
02:11:57,580 --> 02:12:00,630
the straws and the turtle shit straws.

4622
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:01,380
A turtle.

4623
02:12:01,380 --> 02:12:01,741
The two.

4624
02:12:01,741 --> 02:12:02,574
Oh yeah,

4625
02:12:02,580 --> 02:12:03,311
the whole shit.

4626
02:12:03,311 --> 02:12:04,690
That's toxic straws.

4627
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:05,021
Yeah.

4628
02:12:05,021 --> 02:12:10,021
It was like one motherfucker turtle
and understand it reached out,

4629
02:12:10,991 --> 02:12:13,930
but now you can't fuck
with plastic straws.

4630
02:12:14,140 --> 02:12:14,411
He had,

4631
02:12:14,411 --> 02:12:15,101
there was someone,

4632
02:12:15,101 --> 02:12:16,330
I retweeted their posts.

4633
02:12:16,331 --> 02:12:17,980
I wish I could remember
who the fuck's at it,

4634
02:12:17,981 --> 02:12:18,490
but they were,

4635
02:12:18,490 --> 02:12:21,760
they were laughing about
how you can't buy straws,

4636
02:12:21,761 --> 02:12:23,830
but at Starbucks they still
have those plastic lids.

4637
02:12:24,410 --> 02:12:24,740
I quit.

4638
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:25,110
He,

4639
02:12:25,110 --> 02:12:25,931
I know he,

4640
02:12:25,931 --> 02:12:27,270
every straws made out of paper.

4641
02:12:27,271 --> 02:12:28,081
You gotta ask for it.

4642
02:12:28,081 --> 02:12:28,870
I want us.

4643
02:12:28,870 --> 02:12:31,340
And then you get a paper Straw
and I shake it all slop is just,

4644
02:12:31,390 --> 02:12:32,530
they're both understand it,

4645
02:12:32,531 --> 02:12:36,250
but somebody started it and
motherfuckers a fucking running with,

4646
02:12:36,251 --> 02:12:36,581
but you know,

4647
02:12:36,581 --> 02:12:39,250
they can make hemp plastic
that's biodegradable.

4648
02:12:39,310 --> 02:12:43,090
They don't have to use this same stupid
plastic that's made up dude him the hips

4649
02:12:43,091 --> 02:12:43,990
about to change the world.

4650
02:12:44,180 --> 02:12:49,000
I'm about to shut up the natural cannabis
I met these people told me that gave

4651
02:12:49,001 --> 02:12:51,340
you one of those books most likely to put,

4652
02:12:51,341 --> 02:12:52,270
you probably have the book,

4653
02:12:52,330 --> 02:12:53,440
it's got artwork.

4654
02:12:53,470 --> 02:12:53,921
It's really,

4655
02:12:53,921 --> 02:12:54,754
really dope.

4656
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:56,980
The canvas people doing natural cannabis,

4657
02:12:57,010 --> 02:12:57,843
but it's like,

4658
02:12:57,940 --> 02:12:58,311
you know,

4659
02:12:58,311 --> 02:13:00,130
and now business people always hand on us.

4660
02:13:00,230 --> 02:13:00,820
Yeah,

4661
02:13:00,820 --> 02:13:01,570
always.

4662
02:13:01,570 --> 02:13:02,530
But this was like,

4663
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:03,251
it was art.

4664
02:13:03,251 --> 02:13:04,084
It was like,

4665
02:13:04,300 --> 02:13:07,060
it was like just little
nugs of each strand.

4666
02:13:07,390 --> 02:13:08,510
And then it had word from,

4667
02:13:08,511 --> 02:13:09,430
they had a different artist.

4668
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:11,170
Tait Fletcher gave me that.

4669
02:13:11,171 --> 02:13:13,240
That was a big ass book he
gave me at the comedy store.

4670
02:13:14,110 --> 02:13:17,080
I saw Tony with one and
then ivy over there.

4671
02:13:17,081 --> 02:13:18,730
He gave me one and it's dope and shit.

4672
02:13:18,731 --> 02:13:20,310
But when I,

4673
02:13:20,330 --> 02:13:22,540
this is the first time I saw
something there may be looked like,

4674
02:13:22,541 --> 02:13:23,350
okay,

4675
02:13:23,350 --> 02:13:24,760
this is the direction.

4676
02:13:24,790 --> 02:13:26,410
Like everybody's going
to be involved with it.

4677
02:13:26,411 --> 02:13:27,190
So these students,

4678
02:13:27,190 --> 02:13:28,000
everybody,

4679
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,490
these dudes over here
brought me a war case,

4680
02:13:30,670 --> 02:13:31,890
that war chest

4681
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:32,843
over there.

4682
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:35,280
Would that championship
belt on the top of it,

4683
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:36,960
that war chest at the bottom,

4684
02:13:36,961 --> 02:13:37,800
that box.

4685
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:39,690
That's all we'd man.

4686
02:13:40,410 --> 02:13:41,071
Jesus Christ.

4687
02:13:41,071 --> 02:13:41,731
I'm gonna open it up.

4688
02:13:41,731 --> 02:13:43,110
It's got LEDs.

4689
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:44,243
You want to see what it looks like?

4690
02:13:44,890 --> 02:13:45,723
Fuck yeah,

4691
02:13:47,630 --> 02:13:48,463
I got this box.

4692
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:54,320
Joe Is walking over to the box.

4693
02:13:56,590 --> 02:13:57,411
He might've forgotten that.

4694
02:13:57,411 --> 02:13:58,250
No one has a microphone.

4695
02:14:00,710 --> 02:14:01,940
No microphone.

4696
02:14:02,550 --> 02:14:03,560
No microphone.

4697
02:14:03,561 --> 02:14:04,394
That's all we'd

4698
02:14:06,980 --> 02:14:07,813
sorry folks.

4699
02:14:08,530 --> 02:14:10,000
I want to leave you hanging
and ladies and gentlemen,

4700
02:14:10,010 --> 02:14:10,843
but

4701
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:18,760
I think today's the
birth of a new podcast.

4702
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:19,900
Seminars about the,

4703
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:20,470
someone sent me,

4704
02:14:20,470 --> 02:14:21,310
they already bought two soon.

4705
02:14:21,311 --> 02:14:21,880
Went Don L.

4706
02:14:21,880 --> 02:14:22,080
Dot com.

4707
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:22,241
Oh,

4708
02:14:22,241 --> 02:14:22,781
beautiful.

4709
02:14:22,781 --> 02:14:23,614
So he has to start it.

4710
02:14:24,670 --> 02:14:25,181
They bought it,

4711
02:14:25,181 --> 02:14:25,481
bought it.

4712
02:14:25,481 --> 02:14:26,800
They're going to get it
to us and we're going,

4713
02:14:26,801 --> 02:14:29,260
we're going to paypal them
like regular white people.

4714
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:35,200
I'll use the cash app.

4715
02:14:35,201 --> 02:14:36,220
I'll sign up tomorrow.

4716
02:14:36,221 --> 02:14:38,170
I'll use the codeword
Rogan and I get five bucks.

4717
02:14:39,700 --> 02:14:40,630
That's hilarious.

4718
02:14:41,590 --> 02:14:42,341
Just grab shit.

4719
02:14:42,341 --> 02:14:42,881
Whatever you want,

4720
02:14:42,881 --> 02:14:43,714
man.

4721
02:14:44,740 --> 02:14:46,180
That's the whole deal with that box.

4722
02:14:46,181 --> 02:14:47,350
That's the box of doom.

4723
02:14:49,580 --> 02:14:52,490
Shout out to a Gino from LSP.

4724
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:53,560
We'd for hooking that up.

4725
02:14:54,530 --> 02:14:55,100
Uh,

4726
02:14:55,100 --> 02:14:55,690
lots it,

4727
02:14:55,690 --> 02:14:59,410
if you're in the middle of nowhere
or you're in one of those states,

4728
02:14:59,411 --> 02:15:02,590
it's still clinging to a prohibition.

4729
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:04,840
You don't understand.

4730
02:15:05,320 --> 02:15:06,153
And uh,

4731
02:15:07,150 --> 02:15:08,710
I know you have it all.

4732
02:15:10,570 --> 02:15:11,800
We'll get you a bag if you want.

4733
02:15:11,830 --> 02:15:12,663
You want a bag?

4734
02:15:16,990 --> 02:15:21,070
This places that we'd get arrested
for all this and here in California

4735
02:15:22,690 --> 02:15:23,523
drops.

4736
02:15:23,680 --> 02:15:24,280
Yeah.

4737
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:29,140
The future of a California is a
hundred percent legality were legal.

4738
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:30,880
These other states,

4739
02:15:30,910 --> 02:15:31,481
their future,

4740
02:15:31,481 --> 02:15:32,261
they need to catch up.

4741
02:15:32,261 --> 02:15:32,801
They need to pass.

4742
02:15:32,801 --> 02:15:34,930
Some laws were living in the future.

4743
02:15:35,790 --> 02:15:37,930
What it we're living in
the legal weed future.

4744
02:15:38,410 --> 02:15:38,741
Yo,

4745
02:15:38,741 --> 02:15:39,610
I'm telling you man,

4746
02:15:39,611 --> 02:15:40,444
this shit,

4747
02:15:41,260 --> 02:15:42,130
this shit right here.

4748
02:15:42,131 --> 02:15:43,690
La would make you a snob.

4749
02:15:44,770 --> 02:15:45,231
Yo,

4750
02:15:45,231 --> 02:15:46,064
La,

4751
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:47,633
west coast,

4752
02:15:47,690 --> 02:15:48,940
any other coast from La.

4753
02:15:49,420 --> 02:15:50,590
When you go back people like,

4754
02:15:50,670 --> 02:15:51,430
oh,

4755
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:54,250
I got wheat and you'll
be like this what strand?

4756
02:15:55,150 --> 02:15:55,983
And they're like,

4757
02:15:56,050 --> 02:15:57,260
what the fuck you mean was tree?

4758
02:15:57,261 --> 02:15:58,061
I got some loud,

4759
02:15:58,061 --> 02:15:58,841
I got so fire,

4760
02:15:58,841 --> 02:15:59,740
I got some gas.

4761
02:16:00,730 --> 02:16:01,660
But this is dope.

4762
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:06,730
But you can't underestimate
weed in some places.

4763
02:16:06,731 --> 02:16:08,650
One Time Ari and Joey Diaz and I,

4764
02:16:08,651 --> 02:16:09,610
we got cocky.

4765
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,790
We were doing a show in Philly
and they gave us some weed,

4766
02:16:12,791 --> 02:16:14,620
but like it's Philly weed man.

4767
02:16:15,140 --> 02:16:18,730
That's the worst when you name
it after the city is filling,

4768
02:16:18,890 --> 02:16:20,530
we thought it was going to be like,

4769
02:16:20,620 --> 02:16:23,800
like low grade weed because
it's in Philadelphia.

4770
02:16:24,220 --> 02:16:29,220
But the guy got ahold of some oh Gee Kush
strains from like 2001 and brought it

4771
02:16:31,211 --> 02:16:32,950
back to Philly and we were crippled.

4772
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:36,910
We wish you guys had to be the type of
company that you knew you would have to

4773
02:16:36,911 --> 02:16:38,250
find the best shit yet.

4774
02:16:38,251 --> 02:16:39,970
But he didn't know it was
going to be that good.

4775
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:40,210
Right.

4776
02:16:40,210 --> 02:16:40,361
Like,

4777
02:16:40,361 --> 02:16:41,440
if I knew it was California,

4778
02:16:41,441 --> 02:16:42,730
we'd I would have backed off.

4779
02:16:42,810 --> 02:16:43,300
Right.

4780
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:44,021
It's a different thing.

4781
02:16:44,021 --> 02:16:45,340
Was just say Nay California.

4782
02:16:45,341 --> 02:16:45,850
Well,

4783
02:16:45,850 --> 02:16:47,050
and Denver's get that.

4784
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:48,250
Yes.

4785
02:16:48,250 --> 02:16:48,601
I want to.

4786
02:16:48,601 --> 02:16:51,310
Who's going to be the
next Gangsta State Oregon.

4787
02:16:52,060 --> 02:16:53,080
Don't get the right rain,

4788
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:55,740
you know Oregon?

4789
02:16:55,790 --> 02:16:56,540
Nope.

4790
02:16:56,540 --> 02:16:58,750
It's gotta be like Philly.

4791
02:16:58,780 --> 02:17:00,400
Something like you can say really quick.

4792
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:02,591
Yeah,

4793
02:17:02,591 --> 02:17:03,424
it's a,

4794
02:17:04,180 --> 02:17:05,013
but this,

4795
02:17:05,050 --> 02:17:07,450
it's hard to find bad weed today.

4796
02:17:07,870 --> 02:17:09,040
Weeds everywhere now.

4797
02:17:09,070 --> 02:17:09,251
Yeah.

4798
02:17:09,251 --> 02:17:14,020
You got to think about the type of
friends you have that would give you pay

4799
02:17:14,021 --> 02:17:14,351
waves.

4800
02:17:14,351 --> 02:17:14,950
Yeah.

4801
02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:18,580
There's no need for that at this
comedy club down in Tampa or something.

4802
02:17:19,480 --> 02:17:19,751
I was like,

4803
02:17:19,751 --> 02:17:20,321
you got some weed?

4804
02:17:20,321 --> 02:17:20,771
She was like,

4805
02:17:20,771 --> 02:17:20,981
yeah,

4806
02:17:20,981 --> 02:17:21,814
I got some weed.

4807
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:22,250
I was like,

4808
02:17:22,250 --> 02:17:23,083
alright.

4809
02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:25,690
So she gave me this joint and she said,

4810
02:17:26,590 --> 02:17:26,950
yeah,

4811
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:27,761
some shit we,

4812
02:17:27,761 --> 02:17:28,594
but here you go.

4813
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:29,501
And I said,

4814
02:17:29,501 --> 02:17:30,640
what are you giving it to me for it?

4815
02:17:31,390 --> 02:17:31,811
She was like,

4816
02:17:31,811 --> 02:17:32,421
you wanted the weed.

4817
02:17:32,421 --> 02:17:32,891
When I was like,

4818
02:17:32,891 --> 02:17:34,720
why would I want some shit?

4819
02:17:34,721 --> 02:17:35,554
Wheat?

4820
02:17:36,010 --> 02:17:38,470
She got mad at me as if I was ungrateful.

4821
02:17:39,550 --> 02:17:40,091
I want to say,

4822
02:17:40,091 --> 02:17:40,391
bitch,

4823
02:17:40,391 --> 02:17:41,224
are you smoking?

4824
02:17:41,710 --> 02:17:42,720
What else to say?

4825
02:17:43,180 --> 02:17:44,860
I want to say it but I couldn't say,

4826
02:17:45,370 --> 02:17:46,203
but I'm like this,

4827
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:46,961
Yo,

4828
02:17:46,961 --> 02:17:51,790
why would I want to smoke some weed that
you just told me it was garbage just to

4829
02:17:51,791 --> 02:17:52,451
say thank you.

4830
02:17:52,451 --> 02:17:52,850
Fuck that.

4831
02:17:52,850 --> 02:17:53,683
You can keep that shit.

4832
02:17:55,630 --> 02:17:57,070
It makes sense to keep it right.

4833
02:17:57,100 --> 02:17:57,760
Yes.

4834
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:58,021
Damn.

4835
02:17:58,021 --> 02:18:01,570
It just childproof I look like a crack
head making some of those hard to get off

4836
02:18:01,571 --> 02:18:01,751
now.

4837
02:18:01,751 --> 02:18:05,140
I swear they're not looking at
these are the best you can tell.

4838
02:18:05,710 --> 02:18:06,640
That's good stuff.

4839
02:18:07,190 --> 02:18:07,930
I know.

4840
02:18:07,930 --> 02:18:08,763
Potent.

4841
02:18:08,770 --> 02:18:10,330
I know there's different levels.

4842
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:11,590
There's this three different ones.

4843
02:18:11,591 --> 02:18:12,490
Three different colors.

4844
02:18:13,420 --> 02:18:15,590
Find what you like this,

4845
02:18:15,640 --> 02:18:17,250
we got some batteries back there too

4846
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:20,410
cause right now man,

4847
02:18:21,070 --> 02:18:22,090
go grab one of those.

4848
02:18:22,091 --> 02:18:22,540
Um,

4849
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:23,110
zip up.

4850
02:18:23,110 --> 02:18:24,070
There's a few of them.

4851
02:18:24,071 --> 02:18:27,220
There's three or four of
them were these joints?

4852
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:27,760
Yeah.

4853
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:28,001
No,

4854
02:18:28,001 --> 02:18:29,440
I like those little vape pens.

4855
02:18:29,441 --> 02:18:30,274
They're great.

4856
02:18:30,550 --> 02:18:30,921
And you,

4857
02:18:30,921 --> 02:18:31,121
you,

4858
02:18:31,121 --> 02:18:32,740
you could regulate it there.

4859
02:18:32,741 --> 02:18:33,280
Good.

4860
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:34,690
Once he figured out what it is,

4861
02:18:35,650 --> 02:18:36,483
what are these?

4862
02:18:36,860 --> 02:18:38,440
Cause a charger for that.

4863
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:42,640
Once you feel like what it is like you
get this little battery looked like it

4864
02:18:42,641 --> 02:18:43,474
changed.

4865
02:18:44,080 --> 02:18:44,291
No,

4866
02:18:44,291 --> 02:18:45,310
it's just a USB.

4867
02:18:45,670 --> 02:18:46,750
That's a USB port.

4868
02:18:46,751 --> 02:18:49,060
Screws into the bottom of
the base of the battery.

4869
02:18:49,130 --> 02:18:49,361
All right.

4870
02:18:49,361 --> 02:18:50,170
Don't nobody moves.

4871
02:18:50,170 --> 02:18:51,003
They steals.

4872
02:18:52,440 --> 02:18:53,310
Oh wait,

4873
02:18:53,350 --> 02:18:53,651
hold on.

4874
02:18:53,651 --> 02:18:53,950
No.

4875
02:18:53,950 --> 02:18:54,281
Damn.

4876
02:18:54,281 --> 02:18:56,090
It feels like you're in the
hospital when you get home,

4877
02:18:57,200 --> 02:18:57,940
you're like got roll.

4878
02:18:57,940 --> 02:18:58,773
You got it.

4879
02:18:59,290 --> 02:18:59,651
You got,

4880
02:18:59,651 --> 02:18:59,801
Oh,

4881
02:18:59,801 --> 02:19:00,910
I'm about to get a shot.

4882
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:01,421
Yeah,

4883
02:19:01,421 --> 02:19:02,500
that's a weird call.

4884
02:19:03,320 --> 02:19:04,870
Once you got a disposable battery.

4885
02:19:05,380 --> 02:19:06,213
No,

4886
02:19:06,700 --> 02:19:08,560
rechargeable with that little USB thing.

4887
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:09,633
That thing right there.

4888
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:10,540
Does it work?

4889
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:11,291
What are you gonna do with that one?

4890
02:19:11,291 --> 02:19:13,480
Is that a five pressure check?

4891
02:19:14,740 --> 02:19:16,280
Sometimes you press them for notes on.

4892
02:19:16,690 --> 02:19:17,523
There we go.

4893
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:17,730
Are,

4894
02:19:17,730 --> 02:19:18,563
there you go.

4895
02:19:21,880 --> 02:19:22,290
Powerful.

4896
02:19:22,290 --> 02:19:23,050
Lasp we,

4897
02:19:23,050 --> 02:19:23,261
Yo,

4898
02:19:23,261 --> 02:19:24,850
this looks so cool man.

4899
02:19:26,110 --> 02:19:26,680
Yeah,

4900
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:27,290
it is cool.

4901
02:19:27,290 --> 02:19:27,441
Yeah,

4902
02:19:27,441 --> 02:19:29,570
but in La we get it delivered folks.

4903
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:32,060
So you're rubbing it in man.

4904
02:19:32,090 --> 02:19:32,960
All these people out there,

4905
02:19:33,620 --> 02:19:35,180
we're not going to be showing the corner.

4906
02:19:35,440 --> 02:19:36,273
It'll actually change it.

4907
02:19:36,820 --> 02:19:38,570
All I'm saying is it's aspire,

4908
02:19:39,230 --> 02:19:40,670
aspire to inspire,

4909
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:41,630
heat moving.

4910
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:43,980
But you can in California
you cannot transport.

4911
02:19:43,981 --> 02:19:44,481
Can you mail?

4912
02:19:44,481 --> 02:19:48,200
We know now that you can fly with it.

4913
02:19:48,470 --> 02:19:49,640
They will let you fly.

4914
02:19:49,660 --> 02:19:51,940
Went to [inaudible] get caught
with that cause everybody,

4915
02:19:52,130 --> 02:19:53,090
you're the third person,

4916
02:19:53,490 --> 02:19:54,190
not court,

4917
02:19:54,190 --> 02:19:56,270
but you're the third person
to say how easy it is.

4918
02:19:56,990 --> 02:19:57,830
Everybody's like this.

4919
02:19:57,920 --> 02:19:58,251
Oh yeah,

4920
02:19:58,251 --> 02:19:58,731
they'll let you,

4921
02:19:58,731 --> 02:19:59,060
I'm like,

4922
02:19:59,060 --> 02:19:59,570
okay.

4923
02:19:59,570 --> 02:20:00,770
They won't let you land though.

4924
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:01,633
That's the issue.

4925
02:20:01,790 --> 02:20:03,200
That's what the problem was.

4926
02:20:03,201 --> 02:20:04,670
Somebody in Boston told me that shit.

4927
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:04,881
Yeah.

4928
02:20:04,881 --> 02:20:05,930
If you land in Delaware,

4929
02:20:05,931 --> 02:20:06,980
they'll put you in a whole,

4930
02:20:08,090 --> 02:20:08,670
Yo,

4931
02:20:08,670 --> 02:20:09,770
what the fuck did this?

4932
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:11,000
It's like you can't do it.

4933
02:20:11,030 --> 02:20:11,301
No,

4934
02:20:11,301 --> 02:20:12,111
it's still stupid.

4935
02:20:12,111 --> 02:20:13,490
And like a bunch of states.

4936
02:20:13,491 --> 02:20:14,750
It's only legal in what,

4937
02:20:14,751 --> 02:20:15,950
nine states now?

4938
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:18,470
I think it's legal in nine states.

4939
02:20:18,471 --> 02:20:21,500
And maybe a few more magnetically.

4940
02:20:21,950 --> 02:20:24,620
How many all tolls or for legality?

4941
02:20:25,010 --> 02:20:25,843
Recreational.

4942
02:20:25,850 --> 02:20:27,590
I think it's still only four.

4943
02:20:28,130 --> 02:20:28,701
So what is that?

4944
02:20:28,701 --> 02:20:29,840
But it's Nevada too.

4945
02:20:29,841 --> 02:20:30,920
So it's Nevada,

4946
02:20:30,980 --> 02:20:31,580
Nevada,

4947
02:20:31,580 --> 02:20:32,190
Nevada,

4948
02:20:32,190 --> 02:20:32,810
Nevada,

4949
02:20:32,810 --> 02:20:33,890
California,

4950
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:34,881
Oregon,

4951
02:20:34,881 --> 02:20:36,500
Washington and Colorado.

4952
02:20:36,650 --> 02:20:37,400
That's five.

4953
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:37,641
Okay,

4954
02:20:37,641 --> 02:20:39,620
so five and Boston.

4955
02:20:39,710 --> 02:20:40,590
Boston has six.

4956
02:20:40,591 --> 02:20:42,310
Three C.

4957
02:20:42,310 --> 02:20:43,143
Yep.

4958
02:20:43,160 --> 02:20:43,580
Um,

4959
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:45,880
I think I may check on that.

4960
02:20:46,030 --> 02:20:47,150
I think I can ask when we were there,

4961
02:20:47,151 --> 02:20:48,740
but they might not have
their stores open yet,

4962
02:20:48,741 --> 02:20:49,370
sort of thing.

4963
02:20:49,370 --> 02:20:49,870
Oh,

4964
02:20:49,870 --> 02:20:50,130
hi.

4965
02:20:50,130 --> 02:20:50,990
Finest medical.

4966
02:20:50,991 --> 02:20:52,580
And it just there now medical.

4967
02:20:52,790 --> 02:20:53,980
See what Massachusetts has.

4968
02:20:53,990 --> 02:20:54,270
I want,

4969
02:20:54,270 --> 02:20:57,000
I'm pretty sure Massachusetts
has recreational will.

4970
02:20:57,001 --> 02:20:57,651
Come on man.

4971
02:20:57,651 --> 02:20:58,790
We're grown adults.

4972
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:01,340
Something else needs to go in here Joe.

4973
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:02,040
It is,

4974
02:21:02,040 --> 02:21:02,600
it is.

4975
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:02,781
Yeah.

4976
02:21:02,781 --> 02:21:03,614
Massachusetts is

4977
02:21:06,100 --> 02:21:09,020
pretty ass pouch is pretty right?

4978
02:21:09,140 --> 02:21:09,560
Yes.

4979
02:21:09,560 --> 02:21:10,340
Nice.

4980
02:21:10,340 --> 02:21:11,060
Yeah.

4981
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:11,900
What company is that?

4982
02:21:12,090 --> 02:21:14,870
What does it say on that loud,

4983
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:16,400
loud shout out to loud.

4984
02:21:16,490 --> 02:21:17,540
Loud and clear.

4985
02:21:18,410 --> 02:21:20,470
I love those little things
cause they give you,

4986
02:21:20,690 --> 02:21:20,961
you know what?

4987
02:21:20,961 --> 02:21:21,741
That's a good dose.

4988
02:21:21,741 --> 02:21:22,860
Before you go onstage,

4989
02:21:22,890 --> 02:21:23,401
just a little,

4990
02:21:23,401 --> 02:21:23,961
a little quick.

4991
02:21:23,961 --> 02:21:24,350
Yeah.

4992
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:25,370
Just a little woo.

4993
02:21:25,430 --> 02:21:26,450
Just a little pick me up.

4994
02:21:26,770 --> 02:21:27,001
Yes,

4995
02:21:27,001 --> 02:21:27,834
of course.

4996
02:21:30,920 --> 02:21:31,580
Yup.

4997
02:21:31,580 --> 02:21:33,140
What is your pre show ritual?

4998
02:21:33,500 --> 02:21:34,333
Do you have one?

4999
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:36,560
No,

5000
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:37,393
no.

5001
02:21:37,450 --> 02:21:38,590
I like to have like,

5002
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:39,351
like you said,

5003
02:21:39,351 --> 02:21:40,220
two puffs a week.

5004
02:21:40,550 --> 02:21:41,383
Two puffs,

5005
02:21:41,510 --> 02:21:42,091
a little bit.

5006
02:21:42,091 --> 02:21:42,561
A little puffs.

5007
02:21:42,561 --> 02:21:43,450
So deep track.

5008
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:44,293
No little puff.

5009
02:21:44,420 --> 02:21:46,220
You know Dave got me back on blunts.

5010
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:48,753
Yeah.

5011
02:21:51,020 --> 02:21:52,190
When I first walked I was like,

5012
02:21:52,191 --> 02:21:52,431
Joe,

5013
02:21:52,431 --> 02:21:52,711
Joe,

5014
02:21:52,711 --> 02:21:53,481
slow down man.

5015
02:21:53,481 --> 02:21:54,314
We get it.

5016
02:21:55,910 --> 02:21:57,250
You're cool mother fucker.

5017
02:21:58,490 --> 02:22:00,380
That's all we use it most of the time now.

5018
02:22:00,740 --> 02:22:01,100
When,

5019
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:01,760
uh,

5020
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:05,150
Charlie Murphy got me on
him the first time and then,

5021
02:22:05,151 --> 02:22:05,984
um,

5022
02:22:06,170 --> 02:22:06,650
I got,

5023
02:22:06,650 --> 02:22:07,101
I was like,

5024
02:22:07,101 --> 02:22:11,000
this is an interesting experience to be
high and then nicotine high at the same

5025
02:22:11,001 --> 02:22:11,834
time.

5026
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:14,120
The two t two of them together are unique.

5027
02:22:14,720 --> 02:22:15,740
It's a different feeling.

5028
02:22:15,950 --> 02:22:18,850
And then I didn't do it again
for a long time until uh,

5029
02:22:19,010 --> 02:22:24,010
I smoked with Dave and John Mayer namedrop
assuming that were were both smoking

5030
02:22:24,831 --> 02:22:26,280
that it's nice guy.

5031
02:22:26,460 --> 02:22:26,671
Yeah,

5032
02:22:26,671 --> 02:22:27,330
he's a dope guy.

5033
02:22:27,330 --> 02:22:27,801
He's a very,

5034
02:22:27,801 --> 02:22:28,380
very nice guy.

5035
02:22:28,380 --> 02:22:32,310
Like these vapors shit like square it off,

5036
02:22:32,430 --> 02:22:34,230
squared out a smells.

5037
02:22:34,231 --> 02:22:35,580
Smells is shit.

5038
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:36,730
Oh like aroma therapy.

5039
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:37,501
He has been,

5040
02:22:37,501 --> 02:22:38,630
he does his motherfucking just,

5041
02:22:38,631 --> 02:22:38,840
Yo,

5042
02:22:38,840 --> 02:22:39,673
I'm telling you,

5043
02:22:40,050 --> 02:22:41,520
you got to watch out cause he'll just,

5044
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:45,000
you could tell when he'd
get his enrollment therapy
thing in his head because

5045
02:22:45,001 --> 02:22:45,990
he's just doing like this.

5046
02:22:45,991 --> 02:22:46,820
Right.

5047
02:22:46,820 --> 02:22:48,240
And then he'll just come by and be like,

5048
02:22:48,241 --> 02:22:49,970
so how's everything right in half and did,

5049
02:22:50,310 --> 02:22:51,300
it's probably real though.

5050
02:22:51,420 --> 02:22:52,253
It's real,

5051
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:55,910
but he's supposed to give me what are
the motherfucking machine and my wand.

5052
02:22:56,080 --> 02:22:56,913
Yeah.

5053
02:22:57,090 --> 02:22:57,451
I'm like,

5054
02:22:57,451 --> 02:22:58,284
I liked it wrong.

5055
02:22:58,300 --> 02:22:58,861
He had like,

5056
02:22:58,861 --> 02:22:59,694
it was um,

5057
02:23:00,090 --> 02:23:01,280
like Laberdy or something.

5058
02:23:01,290 --> 02:23:02,123
He was like,

5059
02:23:02,910 --> 02:23:03,990
it was a crazy color,

5060
02:23:04,290 --> 02:23:04,771
crazy way.

5061
02:23:04,771 --> 02:23:05,161
He was like,

5062
02:23:05,161 --> 02:23:06,240
just Kim just doing like this

5063
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:08,753
wizard.

5064
02:23:09,450 --> 02:23:11,280
What's that smell that
you gotta be careful of?

5065
02:23:11,310 --> 02:23:11,491
Oh,

5066
02:23:11,491 --> 02:23:14,040
but truly equals hippies.

5067
02:23:15,830 --> 02:23:17,280
Is it a put you the oil?

5068
02:23:17,460 --> 02:23:19,920
It's like a type of oil that
like people were wearing,

5069
02:23:20,190 --> 02:23:22,370
like a lot of hipsters were wearing Ryan,

5070
02:23:22,410 --> 02:23:22,711
isn't it?

5071
02:23:22,711 --> 02:23:24,270
Is it a hipster thing or a hippie?

5072
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:24,811
More hippie,

5073
02:23:24,811 --> 02:23:25,111
Hippie,

5074
02:23:25,111 --> 02:23:25,500
hippie.

5075
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:26,670
But what it's supposed to do,

5076
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:29,940
just a sticky oil people
put on it's petroleum oil.

5077
02:23:30,080 --> 02:23:31,040
Up here in here,

5078
02:23:31,110 --> 02:23:32,280
I have some lotion.

5079
02:23:32,310 --> 02:23:35,090
I don't have a witness like organic,

5080
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:37,620
which some magical elements.

5081
02:23:37,650 --> 02:23:39,300
There's pretty good magical elements.

5082
02:23:39,360 --> 02:23:39,750
Yeah.

5083
02:23:39,750 --> 02:23:40,050
Yeah.

5084
02:23:40,050 --> 02:23:43,050
So what does John Mayer trying to
do with this aroma therapy wand?

5085
02:23:43,270 --> 02:23:44,330
He's waving around everyone.

5086
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:47,100
She just wants sinuses to be open,

5087
02:23:47,110 --> 02:23:47,943
man.

5088
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:49,740
I think he cares about people breathing.

5089
02:23:49,950 --> 02:23:51,180
That's considerate,

5090
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:52,380
you know?

5091
02:23:52,380 --> 02:23:53,010
But he was,

5092
02:23:53,010 --> 02:23:53,551
when he has,

5093
02:23:53,551 --> 02:23:55,680
and he's like a different person.

5094
02:23:57,390 --> 02:23:57,751
I mean,

5095
02:23:57,751 --> 02:23:58,680
it's like he like,

5096
02:23:58,710 --> 02:24:02,460
like it's powerful and he brings it
around people that have been drinking.

5097
02:24:02,460 --> 02:24:06,530
So now you've got to mix the smell of
fucking rum and his got damn lavender

5098
02:24:06,550 --> 02:24:09,000
machine and he only has one machine.

5099
02:24:09,001 --> 02:24:10,470
So once he gets you addicted to it,

5100
02:24:10,890 --> 02:24:12,900
you got to chase him.

5101
02:24:13,140 --> 02:24:15,270
And he's a little too handsome.

5102
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:18,210
I don't even care about that part.

5103
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:23,130
I just don't want him to have me chasing
him for smells because the last two

5104
02:24:23,131 --> 02:24:23,911
times I've seen him,

5105
02:24:23,911 --> 02:24:24,271
I was like,

5106
02:24:24,271 --> 02:24:25,104
John Man,

5107
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:26,800
what's up with the fucking um,

5108
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:27,780
vapor thing?

5109
02:24:28,170 --> 02:24:28,561
He was like,

5110
02:24:28,561 --> 02:24:29,101
you like that,

5111
02:24:29,101 --> 02:24:29,760
don't you?

5112
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:30,900
Like he's got like a pimp.

5113
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:32,610
He wants to hold it back from you.

5114
02:24:32,630 --> 02:24:33,690
I'm a find out who makes it?

5115
02:24:33,691 --> 02:24:34,524
Let me get my home.

5116
02:24:34,650 --> 02:24:35,483
You should get your home.

5117
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:38,280
Maybe I can get them to
sponsor my new podcast.

5118
02:24:38,310 --> 02:24:41,370
I bet they would do it too soon too.

5119
02:24:41,371 --> 02:24:42,570
So I like it.

5120
02:24:42,930 --> 02:24:44,250
It's birth born right here.

5121
02:24:45,870 --> 02:24:46,703
Yup.

5122
02:24:47,220 --> 02:24:48,053
It's inevitable.

5123
02:24:49,290 --> 02:24:49,830
I like it.

5124
02:24:49,830 --> 02:24:50,520
It's perfect.

5125
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:53,700
I get to talk every how often do what
I have to do it anytime you want.

5126
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:54,391
It's a thing.

5127
02:24:54,391 --> 02:24:54,840
Yeah.

5128
02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:55,021
Yeah.

5129
02:24:55,021 --> 02:24:55,920
You can take time off.

5130
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:57,001
Ari Shaffir.

5131
02:24:57,001 --> 02:24:57,840
When he went to Asia,

5132
02:24:57,841 --> 02:24:59,220

Archie fear vanished off
the face of the earth,

5137
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:06,420
disconnected from social media,

5138
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:07,620
from his phone,

5139
02:25:07,770 --> 02:25:08,790
from his email,

5140
02:25:08,850 --> 02:25:09,301
everything.

5141
02:25:09,301 --> 02:25:13,410
Bought a burner phone and went to Asia
and just traveled around for months and

5142
02:25:13,411 --> 02:25:16,260
months and months and months and
months and he just didn't do anything.

5143
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:19,020
And then he came back after three,

5144
02:25:19,021 --> 02:25:22,980
four months and it just pick right up
where it left belong before and now he's

02:27:56,570 --> 02:27:56,980
just,

5255
02:27:56,980 --> 02:27:57,813
uh,

5256
02:27:58,430 --> 02:28:00,800
just have recorded and
then it may be an APP,

5257
02:28:01,100 --> 02:28:04,850
but if I've recorded like I'm a voice
memo just wears his point just to have my

5258
02:28:04,851 --> 02:28:05,590
voice.

5259
02:28:05,590 --> 02:28:06,740
It has to be on a certain

5260
02:28:09,290 --> 02:28:10,123
platform.

5261
02:28:10,540 --> 02:28:11,111
Oh yeah.

5262
02:28:11,111 --> 02:28:11,321
Well,

5263
02:28:11,321 --> 02:28:12,550
the voice recorder,

5264
02:28:12,940 --> 02:28:14,800
like on a phone line on an iPhone,

5265
02:28:14,801 --> 02:28:17,110
the voice notes I have made,

5266
02:28:17,300 --> 02:28:17,650
uh,

5267
02:28:17,650 --> 02:28:20,020
at least a dozen podcasts could use that.

5268
02:28:20,070 --> 02:28:20,860
Yeah.

5269
02:28:20,860 --> 02:28:21,471
Just with that,

5270
02:28:21,471 --> 02:28:23,090
that's been a dozen podcast.

5271
02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:26,900
Lot of them on planes like me and
Tony Hinchcliffe would be on a plane.

5272
02:28:26,930 --> 02:28:28,310
I just have the phone between us.

5273
02:28:28,340 --> 02:28:30,430
We just started talking
shit and drinking cocktails.

5274
02:28:30,470 --> 02:28:30,980
Laugh.

5275
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:32,510
The more important thing
is the compensation.

5276
02:28:32,530 --> 02:28:32,721
Yeah.

5277
02:28:32,721 --> 02:28:33,021
Yeah.

5278
02:28:33,021 --> 02:28:33,854
It doesn't,

5279
02:28:34,160 --> 02:28:35,120
it doesn't matter.

5280
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:37,580
I mean there's as long as you do your bit,

5281
02:28:37,610 --> 02:28:39,860
like right now we have a
real professional setup.

5282
02:28:39,861 --> 02:28:40,521
We have a desk,

5283
02:28:40,521 --> 02:28:41,301
we have microphones.

5284
02:28:41,301 --> 02:28:43,250
Jamie's a real audio engineer.

5285
02:28:43,251 --> 02:28:44,570
He knows exactly what he's doing.

5286
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:45,950
Everything sounds amazing,

5287
02:28:46,370 --> 02:28:49,850
but as long as you put the effort
to give people a good solid product,

5288
02:28:49,851 --> 02:28:52,190
occasionally you can have one
where you just talking on a phone,

5289
02:28:53,210 --> 02:28:54,080
they won't be upset.

5290
02:28:54,110 --> 02:28:55,480
It'll acts to be kind of cool.

5291
02:28:55,650 --> 02:28:57,590
Like people will know all
these guys are on a plane.

5292
02:28:57,830 --> 02:28:58,381
You can hear the,

5293
02:28:58,381 --> 02:28:58,591
the,

5294
02:28:58,591 --> 02:28:59,990
the stewardess comes over with,

5295
02:29:00,700 --> 02:29:01,760
that's not normal.

5296
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:03,533
It's not normal.

5297
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:04,310
But,

5298
02:29:04,310 --> 02:29:05,870
but you could totally do that too.

5299
02:29:05,871 --> 02:29:08,750
The thing is like if you
just started doing that,

5300
02:29:08,751 --> 02:29:11,690
people would love it and then
let it to sort of figure its own,

5301
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:12,470
you know as,

5302
02:29:12,470 --> 02:29:14,540
as it gets bigger figure it's own path,

5303
02:29:14,541 --> 02:29:15,290
but you don't,

5304
02:29:15,290 --> 02:29:17,150
you don't need a big investment to start.

5305
02:29:17,210 --> 02:29:19,220
You just need one of them
little zoom recorders.

5306
02:29:19,340 --> 02:29:20,120
I got a zone.

5307
02:29:20,120 --> 02:29:20,510
Yep.

5308
02:29:20,510 --> 02:29:21,343
Perfect.

5309
02:29:21,500 --> 02:29:22,800
Microphone to my grandma.

5310
02:29:22,810 --> 02:29:23,200
Got My,

5311
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:24,290
I need to just do it bro.

5312
02:29:24,320 --> 02:29:24,771
Just do it.

5313
02:29:24,771 --> 02:29:25,604
That's got to do it.

5314
02:29:25,640 --> 02:29:26,210
And you could,

5315
02:29:26,210 --> 02:29:27,530
you could do this.

5316
02:29:27,531 --> 02:29:28,364
The thing,

5317
02:29:28,910 --> 02:29:30,200
here's the thing with me,

5318
02:29:30,740 --> 02:29:32,420
why I was probably somewhat hesitant.

5319
02:29:32,480 --> 02:29:33,530
I'm like man,

5320
02:29:33,590 --> 02:29:35,270
everybody got a Goddamn podcast.

5321
02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:35,631
Yes,

5322
02:29:35,631 --> 02:29:36,290
but,

5323
02:29:36,290 --> 02:29:36,891
but the,

5324
02:29:36,891 --> 02:29:40,910
but if you're with the right network of
people and you're with the right network

5325
02:29:40,911 --> 02:29:41,301
of people,

5326
02:29:41,301 --> 02:29:42,710
people recognize if you're,

5327
02:29:42,711 --> 02:29:43,950
you're in the network of people with,

5328
02:29:43,951 --> 02:29:44,511
we're talking about,

5329
02:29:44,511 --> 02:29:45,500
you did Theo show,

5330
02:29:45,830 --> 02:29:46,760
you do my show.

5331
02:29:46,761 --> 02:29:48,230
You'll do Joey Diaz is show.

5332
02:29:48,231 --> 02:29:49,310
Have you done Joey show yet?

5333
02:29:49,330 --> 02:29:49,870
I haven't done,

5334
02:29:49,870 --> 02:29:51,020
you'll do Joey show.

5335
02:29:51,021 --> 02:29:52,280
Everybody does everybody show?

5336
02:29:53,290 --> 02:29:53,780
Yeah.

5337
02:29:53,780 --> 02:29:55,100
All these guys funny people.

5338
02:29:55,101 --> 02:29:56,690
You do their show and
then everybody knows.

5339
02:29:56,720 --> 02:29:57,110
Oh,

5340
02:29:57,110 --> 02:29:57,830
okay.

5341
02:29:57,830 --> 02:30:00,980
And then it's all in the same group
of he and everybody gets a bump.

5342
02:30:01,010 --> 02:30:01,910
Everybody gets a bump.

5343
02:30:02,480 --> 02:30:03,313
Everyone,

5344
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:06,860
if as long as everybody is succeeding and
everybody's doing well and is more and

5345
02:30:06,861 --> 02:30:07,611
more podcasts,

5346
02:30:07,611 --> 02:30:08,510
and if I say,

5347
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:09,110
hey,

5348
02:30:09,110 --> 02:30:11,740
you should see this guy's podcast,

5349
02:30:11,750 --> 02:30:12,583
you see

5350
02:30:13,960 --> 02:30:16,100
for the black people that
are listening right now,

5351
02:30:16,101 --> 02:30:19,130
could you please take a note of what
Joe just said for the last minute?

5352
02:30:20,900 --> 02:30:21,733
Networking,

5353
02:30:21,940 --> 02:30:22,970
the got a network,

5354
02:30:23,030 --> 02:30:23,960
all the family,

5355
02:30:23,990 --> 02:30:24,830
it's everything.

5356
02:30:25,130 --> 02:30:26,300
And more importantly,

5357
02:30:27,170 --> 02:30:28,550
everybody gets a bump.

5358
02:30:28,670 --> 02:30:30,590
Everybody gets above and pleadings eat,

5359
02:30:30,650 --> 02:30:31,483
including me,

5360
02:30:31,580 --> 02:30:34,220
everybody who's even the people
that are making more money,

5361
02:30:34,221 --> 02:30:34,640
they make,

5362
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:34,920
they're,

5363
02:30:34,920 --> 02:30:36,440
everything's better for everybody.

5364
02:30:36,560 --> 02:30:38,060
And it feels better.

5365
02:30:38,330 --> 02:30:40,490
It feels better when
everybody's doing great,

5366
02:30:41,810 --> 02:30:42,111
man.

5367
02:30:42,111 --> 02:30:42,561
I'm telling you,

5368
02:30:42,561 --> 02:30:43,930
I'm with you 100% on that.

5369
02:30:43,940 --> 02:30:45,280
And that's like I,

5370
02:30:45,300 --> 02:30:46,450
which 100% on it?

5371
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:48,033
It is not.

5372
02:30:48,140 --> 02:30:49,160
It's really simple.

5373
02:30:49,350 --> 02:30:49,641
Yeah,

5374
02:30:49,641 --> 02:30:50,474
it's really simple.

5375
02:30:50,810 --> 02:30:51,111
It's,

5376
02:30:51,111 --> 02:30:51,640
um,

5377
02:30:51,640 --> 02:30:54,620
it's hard when you're struggling because
when you're struggling and you feel

5378
02:30:54,621 --> 02:30:55,830
isolated and you feel alone,

5379
02:30:55,850 --> 02:30:57,350
you feel like it's you
versus everybody else.

5380
02:30:57,680 --> 02:30:58,700
But it's really not.

5381
02:30:58,701 --> 02:31:01,310
And one of the things
about comedians is we've,

5382
02:31:01,400 --> 02:31:03,290
we've had this conversation many times.

5383
02:31:03,291 --> 02:31:04,790
We were trying to figure
out what the number is.

5384
02:31:04,820 --> 02:31:05,840
I don't know what the number is,

5385
02:31:05,841 --> 02:31:08,930
but it might be less than a
thousand on the whole planet,

5386
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:10,280
on the whole planet earth,

5387
02:31:10,281 --> 02:31:13,670
a 7 billion people that might
be a thousand legit Comedians,

5388
02:31:14,030 --> 02:31:17,840
and I'm probably being a real generous
when I say that I went through 100% if I

5389
02:31:17,841 --> 02:31:20,190
run into a dude like you or

5390
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:20,491
a,

5391
02:31:20,491 --> 02:31:20,821
you know,

5392
02:31:20,821 --> 02:31:23,250
any other real legit comedian does a,

5393
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:25,080
that is a rare human being.

5394
02:31:25,081 --> 02:31:26,340
There's not a whole lot of us.

5395
02:31:26,730 --> 02:31:27,960
If we don't stick together,

5396
02:31:27,961 --> 02:31:30,660
who the fuck will whose farms going off?

5397
02:31:31,370 --> 02:31:32,203
Did you go to sleep?

5398
02:31:32,920 --> 02:31:34,260
The only guy wearing a dream?

5399
02:31:35,400 --> 02:31:36,233
Imagine if we just,

5400
02:31:36,300 --> 02:31:38,610
that alarm went off and I
woke up to pee and I was like,

5401
02:31:38,611 --> 02:31:39,031
fuck,

5402
02:31:39,031 --> 02:31:39,864
I was dreaming.

5403
02:31:41,880 --> 02:31:44,790
I feel like it as the epic podcast.

5404
02:31:45,750 --> 02:31:45,991
Yeah,

5405
02:31:45,991 --> 02:31:46,320
man,

5406
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:46,801
I really,

5407
02:31:46,801 --> 02:31:47,910
I really believe that.

5408
02:31:48,530 --> 02:31:49,680
I really do believe that.

5409
02:31:49,681 --> 02:31:49,950
I believe,

5410
02:31:49,950 --> 02:31:51,480
but I believe that about all that shit.

5411
02:31:52,020 --> 02:31:52,440
It's all,

5412
02:31:52,440 --> 02:31:53,550
it's good for everybody.

5413
02:31:53,610 --> 02:31:54,550
It's good for all of them.

5414
02:31:55,030 --> 02:31:55,863
As I was saying,

5415
02:31:56,370 --> 02:31:59,850
I was making a point that if funding
but making a point and I was like black

5416
02:31:59,851 --> 02:32:01,110
folk that are listening right now,

5417
02:32:01,111 --> 02:32:04,860
listen to this strategy and
listened to what he just said.

5418
02:32:05,400 --> 02:32:06,390
Listen to what he just said.

5419
02:32:06,480 --> 02:32:06,780
It's,

5420
02:32:06,780 --> 02:32:10,530
it has nothing to do with
anything other than community.

5421
02:32:10,620 --> 02:32:14,610
All the other shit that's in your head
in terms of competitiveness is in your

5422
02:32:14,611 --> 02:32:15,330
own head.

5423
02:32:15,330 --> 02:32:16,830
When you have that stage,

5424
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:18,300
that's your stage.

5425
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:20,430
You're there for 15 minutes or 20 minutes,

5426
02:32:20,431 --> 02:32:21,840
whatever you said is that's yours.

5427
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:24,240
What everybody else does should be fuel.

5428
02:32:24,300 --> 02:32:26,400
It should inspire you and you should.

5429
02:32:26,670 --> 02:32:30,060
We should support each other because
there's not so many of us telling you bro,

5430
02:32:30,420 --> 02:32:35,420
and that's the I'm with you 100% but
that is the one of the troubling factors

5431
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:41,130
and a lot of communities
like to support goes away.

5432
02:32:41,550 --> 02:32:41,700
You,

5433
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:42,990
I made motherfuckers talk,

5434
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:44,033
they talk,

5435
02:32:44,220 --> 02:32:45,120
everybody talk,

5436
02:32:45,210 --> 02:32:47,160
but you know why I really believe this.

5437
02:32:47,180 --> 02:32:48,300
Why is it support goes away,

5438
02:32:48,301 --> 02:32:49,560
famine mentality,

5439
02:32:49,680 --> 02:32:50,161
feminine.

5440
02:32:50,161 --> 02:32:52,980
What do they fit it feel like
there's not enough for everybody.

5441
02:32:53,220 --> 02:32:55,800
Everybody had this feeling for the
longest time with is not enough for

5442
02:32:55,801 --> 02:32:56,250
everybody.

5443
02:32:56,250 --> 02:32:58,020
And I think that's a crazy
way to think of things.

5444
02:32:58,021 --> 02:32:59,280
There's more than enough for everybody.

5445
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:01,500
There's 300 million people.

5446
02:33:01,501 --> 02:33:04,020
How many fucking people do
you need in your audience?

5447
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:04,980
Like you said,

5448
02:33:04,980 --> 02:33:05,940
he should realize if you,

5449
02:33:05,941 --> 02:33:07,560
if you really enjoyed doing standup,

5450
02:33:07,590 --> 02:33:09,480
you'd want these people to
become fans of stand up.

5451
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:11,550
So you'd want to tell him about
all these other comedians.

5452
02:33:11,700 --> 02:33:13,710
Tell him about Joey Diaz Talin Bout,

5453
02:33:13,890 --> 02:33:14,161
you know,

5454
02:33:14,161 --> 02:33:14,971
fill in the blank,

5455
02:33:14,971 --> 02:33:15,810
Tony Hinchcliffe,

5456
02:33:15,811 --> 02:33:17,680
whoever it is that you
think is Hilaire tell them,

5457
02:33:17,730 --> 02:33:18,430
tell them.

5458
02:33:18,430 --> 02:33:19,980
There's a lot out there to see Matt.

5459
02:33:20,330 --> 02:33:21,320
It's a separate time.

5460
02:33:21,390 --> 02:33:21,871
I'm telling you,

5461
02:33:21,871 --> 02:33:22,651
certain communities,

5462
02:33:22,651 --> 02:33:23,760
they just don't want to,

5463
02:33:24,450 --> 02:33:26,630
they don't want to tell
motherfuckers be just on this,

5464
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:29,130
on himself and themselves so much.

5465
02:33:29,570 --> 02:33:31,440
They don't want to help.

5466
02:33:31,470 --> 02:33:32,880
They don't want to reach out to.

5467
02:33:32,881 --> 02:33:33,361
And it's like,

5468
02:33:33,361 --> 02:33:33,901
you know what I'm saying?

5469
02:33:33,901 --> 02:33:36,150
Like the conversation you're
having with me right now,

5470
02:33:36,630 --> 02:33:38,910
it's simple for you because you know,

5471
02:33:39,030 --> 02:33:41,610
those are the type of friends and
those type of people you deal with.

5472
02:33:41,690 --> 02:33:42,523
But some people,

5473
02:33:42,570 --> 02:33:43,170
you know what I mean?

5474
02:33:43,170 --> 02:33:44,050
I do know what you mean.

5475
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:45,990
Other fuck that shit.

5476
02:33:45,991 --> 02:33:46,201
Like,

5477
02:33:46,201 --> 02:33:46,920
yeah,

5478
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:51,920
I look at it like people I hang with
Chappelle and these other guys like we are

5479
02:33:52,050 --> 02:33:52,231
like,

5480
02:33:52,231 --> 02:33:52,771
I'm went brown,

5481
02:33:52,771 --> 02:33:54,930
some powerful motherfuckers,

5482
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:56,760
but we're friends first and foremost.

5483
02:33:56,761 --> 02:33:58,560
But everybody don't think like that.

5484
02:33:58,820 --> 02:33:59,160
Yeah,

5485
02:33:59,160 --> 02:33:59,993
that's a tough one.

5486
02:34:00,180 --> 02:34:01,230
It is a tough one,

5487
02:34:01,231 --> 02:34:05,430
but it's just a matter of a
shift in the way you view things.

5488
02:34:05,431 --> 02:34:06,241
Just look at it.

5489
02:34:06,241 --> 02:34:06,780
Just try it.

5490
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:07,081
Don't,

5491
02:34:07,081 --> 02:34:08,460
don't let go of your beliefs.

5492
02:34:08,461 --> 02:34:10,590
Just try to look at it in another way.

5493
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:11,940
Try to look at it another way.

5494
02:34:11,941 --> 02:34:12,141
So,

5495
02:34:12,141 --> 02:34:12,630
and you're,

5496
02:34:12,630 --> 02:34:13,620
you're way better off.

5497
02:34:13,621 --> 02:34:14,550
If you're a team,

5498
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,040
you're way better off of this comradery.

5499
02:34:17,050 --> 02:34:18,050
Like when you do a show,

5500
02:34:18,090 --> 02:34:20,260
so we do a show with
someone who is a murderer,

5501
02:34:20,440 --> 02:34:21,273
a murderer,

5502
02:34:21,430 --> 02:34:22,510
and they go on in front of you.

5503
02:34:22,570 --> 02:34:23,560
You're way better off.

5504
02:34:23,561 --> 02:34:24,460
If you're laughing,

5505
02:34:24,730 --> 02:34:24,910
we,

5506
02:34:24,910 --> 02:34:25,900
you're go on that stage.

5507
02:34:25,901 --> 02:34:27,340
You're way better off if you're loose.

5508
02:34:27,341 --> 02:34:28,720
Like you just had a good time laugh.

5509
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:29,651
But if you're tense,

5510
02:34:29,651 --> 02:34:30,550
like I told you I bombed.

5511
02:34:30,551 --> 02:34:31,384
But Jim Brewer,

5512
02:34:31,660 --> 02:34:32,950
I was backstage freaking out.

5513
02:34:32,951 --> 02:34:33,221
I was like,

5514
02:34:33,221 --> 02:34:33,731
God damn,

5515
02:34:33,731 --> 02:34:34,564
I got to file this.

5516
02:34:34,660 --> 02:34:37,640
How the fuck am I going to find when
I was way younger but I was going to,

5517
02:34:37,641 --> 02:34:38,920
I was looking at eat shit.

5518
02:34:38,921 --> 02:34:42,040
I knew I probably wasn't
and it was a problem.

5519
02:34:42,140 --> 02:34:45,610
It's hard to get away from whatever
your first experiences is going to be.

5520
02:34:46,010 --> 02:34:48,070
You got to say it's probably
your first experience.

5521
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:49,270
It happened like that.

5522
02:34:49,300 --> 02:34:50,200
Like a real bombs.

5523
02:34:50,201 --> 02:34:51,034
I go like,

5524
02:34:51,050 --> 02:34:53,020
oh I could do shit about it.

5525
02:34:53,050 --> 02:34:53,261
Yeah.

5526
02:34:53,261 --> 02:34:54,640
Like I was supposed to do 45 minutes.

5527
02:34:54,641 --> 02:34:56,950
I got offstage at 35 but
you went back in the gym.

5528
02:34:57,280 --> 02:34:57,671
I did.

5529
02:34:57,671 --> 02:34:58,504
I had to.

5530
02:34:58,690 --> 02:34:58,841
Yeah,

5531
02:34:58,841 --> 02:34:59,230
but that,

5532
02:34:59,230 --> 02:35:02,380
the thing is like Jim and I've always
been friends and I've been friends with a

5533
02:35:02,381 --> 02:35:04,480
lot of people that made me
eat shit going on after him.

5534
02:35:04,690 --> 02:35:05,970
It didn't matter that the,

5535
02:35:05,971 --> 02:35:06,130
the,

5536
02:35:06,130 --> 02:35:08,080
the thing about it is that like an,

5537
02:35:08,120 --> 02:35:08,610
I've,

5538
02:35:08,610 --> 02:35:09,760
even after all these years,

5539
02:35:09,761 --> 02:35:11,380
I feel genuinely,

5540
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:17,080
genuinely honored to be a part of this
group of people cause we do something

5541
02:35:17,471 --> 02:35:19,060
that is my favorite thing to watch.

5542
02:35:19,510 --> 02:35:21,010
That's a group of people,

5543
02:35:21,250 --> 02:35:22,210
but like you say,

5544
02:35:22,290 --> 02:35:26,140
it's like a limited circle of
light as no other way to say it,

5545
02:35:26,141 --> 02:35:27,240
but real motherfuckers,

5546
02:35:27,440 --> 02:35:28,540
it's a small circle.

5547
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:29,200
This some.

5548
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:29,641
Okay.

5549
02:35:29,641 --> 02:35:32,630
By the fuck is this
about plugins like you,

5550
02:35:32,631 --> 02:35:36,460
like they say he thinks somebody say
somebody's name and you're like this,

5551
02:35:36,461 --> 02:35:37,150
okay,

5552
02:35:37,150 --> 02:35:37,520
okay,

5553
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:38,353
I

5554
02:35:39,190 --> 02:35:40,023
heard you right.

5555
02:35:40,210 --> 02:35:41,190
You're like urgent,

5556
02:35:41,980 --> 02:35:42,850
but this is the real folks.

5557
02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:43,713
And like you say,

5558
02:35:43,930 --> 02:35:45,580
they gotta they gotta stay United.

5559
02:35:46,150 --> 02:35:46,670
I tell you,

5560
02:35:46,670 --> 02:35:47,290
a couple weeks going,

5561
02:35:47,290 --> 02:35:47,950
I was with David,

5562
02:35:47,950 --> 02:35:48,783
he said,

5563
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:49,500
Morton,

5564
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:50,290
he's a comedian.

5565
02:35:50,290 --> 02:35:53,320
It's time to grab our balls
because now more than ever,

5566
02:35:53,500 --> 02:35:56,230
we are the only people that we've,

5567
02:35:56,231 --> 02:35:59,320
we have to talk about what's
fucked up in the world.

5568
02:35:59,350 --> 02:36:00,183
Yes,

5569
02:36:00,400 --> 02:36:00,881
we have to.

5570
02:36:00,881 --> 02:36:02,950
We can't keep it tells self no,

5571
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:05,050
it's not fair to nobody.

5572
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:08,050
It's too confusing right now because
it's too dangerous to have any

5573
02:36:08,051 --> 02:36:09,250
controversial ideas.

5574
02:36:09,310 --> 02:36:10,810
People are getting in trouble for Lou.

5575
02:36:10,811 --> 02:36:12,010
You don't have no balls though.

5576
02:36:12,450 --> 02:36:12,580
Well,

5577
02:36:12,580 --> 02:36:13,121
you own it.

5578
02:36:13,121 --> 02:36:13,954
You own it.

5579
02:36:14,050 --> 02:36:14,770
You own it.

5580
02:36:14,770 --> 02:36:15,850
If you own it,

5581
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:17,433
you own it.

5582
02:36:18,250 --> 02:36:18,640
Yeah.

5583
02:36:18,640 --> 02:36:19,473
You turn it,

5584
02:36:20,290 --> 02:36:21,060
you know,

5585
02:36:21,060 --> 02:36:26,060
and as they did normally I'm telling you
if you have a like a good people know

5586
02:36:27,131 --> 02:36:27,964
your character.

5587
02:36:28,210 --> 02:36:28,871
If you own it,

5588
02:36:28,871 --> 02:36:29,920
they know what you meant to say.

5589
02:36:29,950 --> 02:36:30,520
They know.

5590
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:31,870
They know exactly.

5591
02:36:31,930 --> 02:36:32,620
Come on man.

5592
02:36:32,620 --> 02:36:37,030
Really if you own it that
someone was asking me,

5593
02:36:37,031 --> 02:36:37,751
why do you think Charlie,

5594
02:36:37,751 --> 02:36:40,880
she never got me Tude I was like what is,

5595
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:42,070
what are you going to do to him?

5596
02:36:42,120 --> 02:36:43,600
But he hasn't already done it himself.

5597
02:36:43,930 --> 02:36:44,750
The guy was on here,

5598
02:36:44,750 --> 02:36:45,421
NBC good.

5599
02:36:45,421 --> 02:36:46,880
No American smoking.

5600
02:36:47,480 --> 02:36:50,880
You know as you know why
they didn't meet nobody.

5601
02:36:50,890 --> 02:36:51,700
Me Too.

5602
02:36:51,700 --> 02:36:53,710
Cause they didn't want
him to have another show.

5603
02:36:54,040 --> 02:36:55,470
Ah Right.

5604
02:36:55,960 --> 02:36:56,793
Think about it.

5605
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:58,110
If he would've got me today,

5606
02:36:58,210 --> 02:37:00,550
he had been the headlights and he
would have failed to show somewhere.

5607
02:37:00,580 --> 02:37:02,650
Let's talk about that collectively.

5608
02:37:02,651 --> 02:37:05,680
There was a period of time where Hollywood
lost her fucking mind and they were

5609
02:37:05,681 --> 02:37:08,920
giving out these deals where if you
got a certain amount of episodes,

5610
02:37:08,921 --> 02:37:12,430
they signed you up for a hundred episodes
and that's what happened with anger

5611
02:37:12,431 --> 02:37:13,120
management.

5612
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:15,980
Charlie Sheen show Charlie
Sheen more money off

5613
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:17,900
that show that he did it even
off three and a half men.

5614
02:37:18,020 --> 02:37:19,040
But people don't know that.

5615
02:37:19,910 --> 02:37:20,511
People don't know that.

5616
02:37:20,511 --> 02:37:21,740
He knows that he's only one.

5617
02:37:21,830 --> 02:37:22,311
Denise.

5618
02:37:22,311 --> 02:37:22,580
No.

5619
02:37:22,580 --> 02:37:22,851
Yeah,

5620
02:37:22,851 --> 02:37:23,201
he's young.

5621
02:37:23,201 --> 02:37:23,510
Little bit.

5622
02:37:23,510 --> 02:37:24,470
It's a crazy story.

5623
02:37:24,471 --> 02:37:26,270
They used to sign shows,

5624
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:29,390
TV's $200 million
Charlie Sheen experiment.

5625
02:37:29,780 --> 02:37:33,740
They used to sign these shows and
they would sign these shows in the

5626
02:37:33,741 --> 02:37:36,440
anticipation of the dual goal of success.

5627
02:37:36,460 --> 02:37:37,040
Right.

5628
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:38,120
So they did that with him.

5629
02:37:38,121 --> 02:37:39,370
They did it with George Lopez.

5630
02:37:39,390 --> 02:37:40,670
He would cut money from shows.

5631
02:37:41,030 --> 02:37:42,650
They give you a certain percentage,

5632
02:37:42,680 --> 02:37:42,981
you know,

5633
02:37:42,981 --> 02:37:43,560
and it's like,

5634
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:44,900
I don't know how it's structured,

5635
02:37:44,901 --> 02:37:48,440
but apparently the point is that they
sign up for a giant number of shows,

5636
02:37:48,560 --> 02:37:53,560
not 13 not 22 they sign you up for a
giant number of shows and by doing that

5637
02:37:54,621 --> 02:37:55,700
somehow or another,

5638
02:37:55,701 --> 02:37:56,021
they,

5639
02:37:56,021 --> 02:37:56,420
they,

5640
02:37:56,420 --> 02:37:56,990
you know,

5641
02:37:56,990 --> 02:38:00,980
right after Charlie Sheen had his whole
scandal leaving two and a half men,

5642
02:38:00,981 --> 02:38:02,350
he went on to have a wake,

5643
02:38:02,351 --> 02:38:04,220
make way more money than ever before.

5644
02:38:04,910 --> 02:38:05,600
That's crazy.

5645
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:06,030
He's a,

5646
02:38:06,030 --> 02:38:07,400
he's got a crazy career man.

5647
02:38:07,730 --> 02:38:08,900
Legit movie star.

5648
02:38:08,910 --> 02:38:12,470
Gigantic TV star also talks about smoking,

5649
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:14,240
smoking a lot of crack.

5650
02:38:14,850 --> 02:38:15,050
Right?

5651
02:38:15,050 --> 02:38:16,670
Was he crackers talking about her coke?

5652
02:38:16,740 --> 02:38:17,573
What was he saying?

5653
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:20,150
Doing yeah,

5654
02:38:20,570 --> 02:38:21,403
doing drugs.

5655
02:38:23,810 --> 02:38:24,621
I don't think so either.

5656
02:38:24,621 --> 02:38:26,810
There's no crack advocates
know people like this.

5657
02:38:28,250 --> 02:38:29,300
Nobody's like Yo,

5658
02:38:29,301 --> 02:38:30,590
last night was a little weird,

5659
02:38:30,980 --> 02:38:31,461
you know what I mean?

5660
02:38:31,461 --> 02:38:31,821
Like Yo,

5661
02:38:31,821 --> 02:38:32,654
I got to me,

5662
02:38:32,990 --> 02:38:35,540
you can't say you got to be
beards to be a glass of wine.

5663
02:38:35,690 --> 02:38:36,950
I Ted to many crack rocks.

5664
02:38:36,951 --> 02:38:37,440
Come on.

5665
02:38:37,440 --> 02:38:38,240
Ah,

5666
02:38:38,240 --> 02:38:38,660
yeah.

5667
02:38:38,660 --> 02:38:41,330
There's a certain darkness to
giving it to that glass Dick.

5668
02:38:41,960 --> 02:38:43,490
Once you start going down that road,

5669
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:44,331
you know you've already,

5670
02:38:44,331 --> 02:38:45,290
you've made a choice.

5671
02:38:46,280 --> 02:38:46,730
You know,

5672
02:38:46,730 --> 02:38:48,290
there's no critical
thinking involved there.

5673
02:38:48,291 --> 02:38:49,640
That's debauchery.

5674
02:38:49,950 --> 02:38:51,170
Gus To happen is you chose,

5675
02:38:51,171 --> 02:38:52,750
everybody chooses different happiness.

5676
02:38:53,060 --> 02:38:57,380
I had a friend that did a lot of
crack back in New York was weird.

5677
02:38:57,790 --> 02:38:58,040
He would,

5678
02:38:58,040 --> 02:39:00,280
he would have to drink
like 40 ounces of a,

5679
02:39:00,290 --> 02:39:04,340
of a malt liquor to try to calm down
because he'd be just so jacked up from the

5680
02:39:04,341 --> 02:39:04,970
crack.

5681
02:39:04,970 --> 02:39:06,860
I had a crack f ran and I was like,

5682
02:39:07,250 --> 02:39:11,150
I gave so many opportunities
just to be cool and he crackhead.

5683
02:39:11,180 --> 02:39:12,880
He gave me a crack at experience was

5684
02:39:14,740 --> 02:39:15,410
it was awesome.

5685
02:39:15,410 --> 02:39:16,130
Mcdonald's,

5686
02:39:16,130 --> 02:39:16,401
Bro.

5687
02:39:16,401 --> 02:39:17,450
We was waiting for Mcdonald's.

5688
02:39:17,570 --> 02:39:18,530
We gave him the money.

5689
02:39:18,531 --> 02:39:18,861
They was like,

5690
02:39:18,861 --> 02:39:19,251
what happened?

5691
02:39:19,251 --> 02:39:20,084
I was like,

5692
02:39:20,210 --> 02:39:20,931
oh man.

5693
02:39:20,931 --> 02:39:21,740
We were like,

5694
02:39:21,740 --> 02:39:22,850
we know you a crack head,

5695
02:39:22,851 --> 02:39:24,080
but don't crack hit us.

5696
02:39:24,770 --> 02:39:25,251
You know what I'm saying?

5697
02:39:25,251 --> 02:39:26,690
Go outside of our community,

5698
02:39:26,691 --> 02:39:27,524
but like here,

5699
02:39:27,770 --> 02:39:28,401
don't do that,

5700
02:39:28,401 --> 02:39:29,234
bro.

5701
02:39:29,900 --> 02:39:30,081
Yeah.

5702
02:39:30,081 --> 02:39:31,430
My friend was brilliant too.

5703
02:39:31,700 --> 02:39:32,121
Brilliant,

5704
02:39:32,121 --> 02:39:32,691
brilliant guy,

5705
02:39:32,691 --> 02:39:35,510
but he had just like mental problems
and he just needed to get high all the

5706
02:39:35,511 --> 02:39:35,901
time.

5707
02:39:35,901 --> 02:39:36,310
He had it.

5708
02:39:36,310 --> 02:39:37,730
Never wanted to be escape.

5709
02:39:38,110 --> 02:39:38,690
Yeah.

5710
02:39:38,690 --> 02:39:40,550
He never wanted to be
alone with his thoughts.

5711
02:39:41,690 --> 02:39:43,190
That's a tough one for a lot of people.

5712
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:46,550
It was a real one for him
because he was brilliant.

5713
02:39:46,580 --> 02:39:47,600
He's a brilliant guy,

5714
02:39:48,320 --> 02:39:50,150
but he was also homeless half the time.

5715
02:39:50,151 --> 02:39:50,984
I knew him,

5716
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:51,890
you know,

5717
02:39:51,890 --> 02:39:52,940
it was a lot going on,

5718
02:39:52,941 --> 02:39:53,151
man,

5719
02:39:53,151 --> 02:39:54,380
within lot going on,

5720
02:39:54,381 --> 02:39:54,890
but he was,

5721
02:39:54,890 --> 02:39:55,970
he could help him.

5722
02:39:56,250 --> 02:39:57,220
No,

5723
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:58,550
he was too stubborn.

5724
02:39:58,580 --> 02:39:59,301
He wouldn't listen.

5725
02:39:59,301 --> 02:39:59,750
He,

5726
02:39:59,750 --> 02:40:03,440
he would just vanished and disappear in
two drugs for a few days and then come

5727
02:40:03,441 --> 02:40:05,720
back and he could do math in his head.

5728
02:40:05,750 --> 02:40:06,620
Like you could say to him,

5729
02:40:06,630 --> 02:40:11,630
99 times 54 times six minus five divided
by three and even when he was sold,

5730
02:40:11,670 --> 02:40:11,900
yeah,

5731
02:40:11,900 --> 02:40:12,860
and he would just bang it out.

5732
02:40:13,070 --> 02:40:13,903
We just tell you what it is.

5733
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:14,620
Quick.

5734
02:40:14,620 --> 02:40:15,890
A $2,000,

5735
02:40:16,030 --> 02:40:16,863
can we tell you?

5736
02:40:17,220 --> 02:40:17,551
And you're like,

5737
02:40:17,551 --> 02:40:18,630
you'd be there with a calculator.

5738
02:40:18,631 --> 02:40:18,871
You're like,

5739
02:40:18,871 --> 02:40:19,790
you mother fucker.

5740
02:40:19,860 --> 02:40:20,460
Yeah.

5741
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:21,293
It was crazy.

5742
02:40:21,690 --> 02:40:22,440
But he couldn't,

5743
02:40:22,440 --> 02:40:26,190
he couldn't manage his own brain to the
point where we could stay away from hard

5744
02:40:26,191 --> 02:40:28,770
drugs and eventually died of an overdose.

5745
02:40:30,170 --> 02:40:31,300
That's usually,

5746
02:40:32,740 --> 02:40:33,573
yeah.

5747
02:40:33,630 --> 02:40:34,401
That's how it goes.

5748
02:40:34,401 --> 02:40:35,890
That's usually how that goes,

5749
02:40:35,900 --> 02:40:36,630
bro.

5750
02:40:36,630 --> 02:40:37,463
Yeah.

5751
02:40:38,200 --> 02:40:39,033
Yeah.

5752
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:41,153
Like that to me.

5753
02:40:41,170 --> 02:40:42,480
Motherfuckers come back from that.

5754
02:40:42,481 --> 02:40:44,070
They don't come back from the needle.

5755
02:40:44,130 --> 02:40:44,650
Nope.

5756
02:40:44,650 --> 02:40:45,660
It'll come back from that.

5757
02:40:45,930 --> 02:40:46,560
It's hard.

5758
02:40:46,560 --> 02:40:48,150
I mean it is possible,

5759
02:40:48,151 --> 02:40:48,990
but you need some help.

5760
02:40:49,410 --> 02:40:51,810
That's one of the reasons why
that 12th step shit works.

5761
02:40:51,811 --> 02:40:54,210
We really given a god or the higher power.

5762
02:40:54,211 --> 02:40:54,580
It's like you,

5763
02:40:54,580 --> 02:40:54,850
you,

5764
02:40:54,850 --> 02:40:58,380
you're going to have to somehow or
another thing to something more important

5765
02:40:58,381 --> 02:40:58,981
than what you're doing.

5766
02:40:58,981 --> 02:41:00,540
Otherwise you're never
going to stop this shit.

5767
02:41:01,080 --> 02:41:01,321
Yeah,

5768
02:41:01,321 --> 02:41:03,870
but those people become like
big sex addicts and shit.

5769
02:41:04,490 --> 02:41:05,323
Coffee,

5770
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:09,300
would they want to fuck everything?

5771
02:41:10,580 --> 02:41:11,840
Coffee Sign,

5772
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:12,400
right?

5773
02:41:12,400 --> 02:41:13,240
They was cool.

5774
02:41:13,241 --> 02:41:14,620
Me Is some ass.

5775
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:16,980
They don't give a fuck.

5776
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:18,990
Give me the ass for us coffee.

5777
02:41:18,991 --> 02:41:19,824
Whatever it is.

5778
02:41:20,070 --> 02:41:20,920
You do know.

5779
02:41:22,670 --> 02:41:23,280
Jug.

5780
02:41:23,280 --> 02:41:24,690
That's so fucking funny.

5781
02:41:24,750 --> 02:41:25,583
It's so true.

5782
02:41:25,650 --> 02:41:26,520
Everybody did.

5783
02:41:26,521 --> 02:41:27,870
I know that had a situation,

5784
02:41:27,871 --> 02:41:29,370
a muffle cause I'll cough shit.

5785
02:41:29,490 --> 02:41:31,590
They don't ever get rid
of those tendencies.

5786
02:41:31,620 --> 02:41:35,220
They just try to figure out a way to
put it somewhere else in a positive way.

5787
02:41:35,221 --> 02:41:38,430
Socially acceptable or
marathon running Isam.

5788
02:41:38,431 --> 02:41:39,180
Shit,

5789
02:41:39,180 --> 02:41:40,330
there's a lot of the LIGO heart,

5790
02:41:41,670 --> 02:41:42,630
those duly jump.

5791
02:41:42,640 --> 02:41:43,473
Motherfuckers

5792
02:41:45,260 --> 02:41:45,930
don out.

5793
02:41:45,930 --> 02:41:46,680
I think we birth,

5794
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:48,690
we birthed a new podcast today.

5795
02:41:48,900 --> 02:41:49,733
Yo.

5796
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:54,270
You know what I just did and
I know there's a reason why.

5797
02:41:54,460 --> 02:41:57,210
Here's the reason why I bumped it to
you in the show and we see each other in

5798
02:41:57,211 --> 02:41:57,660
passing.

5799
02:41:57,660 --> 02:41:59,280
We've been talking about
doing this for a long time,

5800
02:41:59,310 --> 02:41:59,680
you know what I mean?

5801
02:41:59,680 --> 02:42:02,220
But I don't like when
I see the comedy club,

5802
02:42:02,221 --> 02:42:02,491
I'm like,

5803
02:42:02,491 --> 02:42:03,600
this is the old Emma fucking working.

5804
02:42:03,601 --> 02:42:04,434
I'm working.

5805
02:42:04,530 --> 02:42:05,363
What's up?

5806
02:42:05,370 --> 02:42:06,540
I know you Joe Rogan,

5807
02:42:07,050 --> 02:42:07,711
Yada Yada.

5808
02:42:07,711 --> 02:42:08,544
But I was like,

5809
02:42:09,990 --> 02:42:10,560
you know,

5810
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:11,790
you do your shit.

5811
02:42:12,380 --> 02:42:12,691
I was like,

5812
02:42:12,691 --> 02:42:13,341
but when I see,

5813
02:42:13,341 --> 02:42:13,861
I'd be like,

5814
02:42:13,861 --> 02:42:14,694
did it work?

5815
02:42:14,940 --> 02:42:16,260
I'm glad we had this conversation.

5816
02:42:16,261 --> 02:42:20,960
I just did Burt's cooking show
and I took that shit oversight.

5817
02:42:21,780 --> 02:42:22,261
They was like,

5818
02:42:22,261 --> 02:42:22,950
Yo,

5819
02:42:22,950 --> 02:42:26,160
this might be my week of
getting shows that he was like,

5820
02:42:26,161 --> 02:42:26,341
Yo,

5821
02:42:26,341 --> 02:42:27,360
you should do a cooking show.

5822
02:42:27,361 --> 02:42:28,050
Right.

5823
02:42:28,050 --> 02:42:29,060
I would to birch shit.

5824
02:42:29,070 --> 02:42:29,820
Burton was like this.

5825
02:42:29,820 --> 02:42:31,650
I think I just gave my show to Darnell.

5826
02:42:31,651 --> 02:42:32,484
Right?

5827
02:42:32,850 --> 02:42:33,301
Come here.

5828
02:42:33,301 --> 02:42:33,481
They,

5829
02:42:33,481 --> 02:42:34,141
Joe Rogan's like,

5830
02:42:34,141 --> 02:42:35,280
Yo Donielle let's do a show.

5831
02:42:35,290 --> 02:42:36,123
We can do it right here.

5832
02:42:36,360 --> 02:42:37,200
You have to do a show.

5833
02:42:37,230 --> 02:42:37,561
Fuck it.

5834
02:42:37,561 --> 02:42:38,070
Let's do it.

5835
02:42:38,070 --> 02:42:38,903
You have to do a show.

5836
02:42:38,930 --> 02:42:39,210
Yeah.

5837
02:42:39,210 --> 02:42:39,930
And like I said,

5838
02:42:39,930 --> 02:42:41,010
you just start off easy.

5839
02:42:41,011 --> 02:42:42,630
Just put a microphone on your iPhone.

5840
02:42:42,631 --> 02:42:43,230
It's nothing.

5841
02:42:43,230 --> 02:42:44,010
It's easy to do.

5842
02:42:44,010 --> 02:42:44,561
I've got all that.

5843
02:42:44,561 --> 02:42:45,240
I'm going to do it.

5844
02:42:45,240 --> 02:42:46,080
Beautiful.

5845
02:42:46,360 --> 02:42:46,710
Yes.

5846
02:42:46,710 --> 02:42:47,543
Hey,

5847
02:42:47,550 --> 02:42:48,383
there's a lot of fun.

5848
02:42:49,190 --> 02:42:50,110
Thank time.

5849
02:42:51,030 --> 02:42:51,631
Always good to see you,

5850
02:42:51,631 --> 02:42:51,900
man.

5851
02:42:51,900 --> 02:42:53,010
Congratulations.

5852
02:42:53,340 --> 02:42:57,570
Congratulations on all your success in
however many years you've been doing it.

5853
02:42:57,571 --> 02:42:59,340
Cause when I was first introduced,

5854
02:42:59,370 --> 02:43:01,140
I knew like fear factor,

5855
02:43:01,141 --> 02:43:01,411
you know,

5856
02:43:01,411 --> 02:43:04,860
I didn't even know that you did
stand up until I came out here.

5857
02:43:05,190 --> 02:43:05,880
Wow.

5858
02:43:05,880 --> 02:43:06,713
I didn't know that.

5859
02:43:07,050 --> 02:43:07,420
I,

5860
02:43:07,420 --> 02:43:08,221
you know what I thought I was like,

5861
02:43:08,221 --> 02:43:08,311
oh,

5862
02:43:08,311 --> 02:43:09,150
that's the TV Nigga.

5863
02:43:09,151 --> 02:43:09,984
Right?

5864
02:43:11,460 --> 02:43:12,190
I don't believe

5865
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:12,631
his sad.

5866
02:43:12,631 --> 02:43:14,470
I was like Delta TV bigger right here.

5867
02:43:14,471 --> 02:43:14,780
Right.

5868
02:43:14,780 --> 02:43:16,670
Then they could do podcasts too.

5869
02:43:18,160 --> 02:43:20,350
And then I was like that
they could do stand up too.

5870
02:43:20,830 --> 02:43:21,580
And I was a high,

5871
02:43:21,580 --> 02:43:22,750
but your pocket has begun.

5872
02:43:23,020 --> 02:43:23,710
Right.

5873
02:43:23,710 --> 02:43:25,900
And then when I saw you do your show,

5874
02:43:25,901 --> 02:43:26,351
I was like,

5875
02:43:26,351 --> 02:43:27,160
he'll go hard.

5876
02:43:27,160 --> 02:43:28,090
Bubba fucking sir,

5877
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:29,550
I appreciate your,

5878
02:43:29,630 --> 02:43:30,190

your work ethics and everything you do.

5880
02:43:31,660 --> 02:43:32,231
Thank you brother.

5881
02:43:32,231 --> 02:43:32,951
I appreciate you too,

5882
02:43:32,951 --> 02:43:33,281

your perspective on comedy,

5886
02:43:36,850 --> 02:43:37,481
your approach,

5887
02:43:37,481 --> 02:43:38,170
your ethics,

5888
02:43:38,170 --> 02:43:38,711
the whole deal.

5889
02:43:38,711 --> 02:43:38,980
Man.

5890
02:43:38,980 --> 02:43:39,551
I appreciate you.

5891
02:43:39,551 --> 02:43:41,320
I appreciate you being
around the comedy store too.

5892
02:43:41,860 --> 02:43:42,570
Awesome.

5893
02:43:42,570 --> 02:43:43,200
All right,

5894
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:43,640
Donna,

5895
02:43:43,640 --> 02:43:44,650
ladies and gentlemen.
