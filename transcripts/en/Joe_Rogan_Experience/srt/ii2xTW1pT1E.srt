1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,040
How strong are these?
Shouldn't have to write.

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,800
I definitely wouldn't have two of those.
Okay.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm talking trust.
So it's a 240 milligrams of caffeine.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,790
Now I can feel it rising inside of me.
That baby.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,490
See why you want to ruin star wars?
What?

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,080
Ali's kidding.
I'm not going to do that man.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,510
I heard a lot of people are saying that 
they,

8
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:25,344
uh,
they,

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,690
they heard it was crap and that it 
wasn't good.

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,610
But everybody I know that saw it said it
was awesome.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,140
I loved it.
You loved it.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,300
I didn't like it.
It's like,

13
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:34,530
what are you thinking,
man?

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,240
What did you think we are going to go 
see?

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,283
It's called Star Wars.
Like it's the most obvious kind of 

16
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:42,384
thing.
I don't know why people have 

17
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:43,674
expectations for star wars.
It was the expectations I guess they're 

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,820
looking for or a plot.
I guess they're looking for.

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,451
No,
you know what I mean?

20
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:59,010
I guess they're looking for some kind of
like deep like meaning or something like

21
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:02,150
Quintin Tarantino or some.
Some kubrick ask thing.

22
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,830
It's star wars.
It's a space opera.

23
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:09,831
It's like I go in there with no 
expectations,

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,270
be happy for the colors,
that's it,

25
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,430
the beautiful colors,
and then after that,

26
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:15,264
if there's something out,
it's things flying through space and 

27
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,560
lasers.

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,460
It's a very confined genre.
It's very confined and you know it's not

29
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:23,294
going to step outside of the box.
It's not going to be weird sexually not 

30
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,550
going to have some strange murder 
tension because I'm going to be any like

31
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,463
any unrequited love.
There's going to be just some normal 

32
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,190
space themes with Joseph Campbell's 
hero's journey.

33
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,470
That's it.
It's mixing with a lot of mystical stuff

34
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:41,330
that you can connect to you,
which is beautiful.

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,920
It's great.
I had lucas talk about his friend Joseph

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,753
Campbell,
like literally wrote star wars based on 

37
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:51,590
Joseph Campbell's steps of a hero's 
journey.

38
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,850
Fascinating.
They were.

39
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,110
There were good friends.
Yeah.

40
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:54,944
The hero with a thousand faces.
This is classic book and then he did 

41
00:01:58,221 --> 00:02:00,530
have you seen his interviews with Bill 
Moyers?

42
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,050
Power of myth.
That was fantastic.

43
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:03,884
He's awesome.
So Joseph Campbell used to go up and 

44
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:10,190
give a lecture at Lucas ranch every year
on mythology.

45
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,470
Lucas ranch where George Lucas ranch up 
in Morin or sonoma and so he would go up

46
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:21,830
and when they were working on the 
original star wars and give a lecture to

47
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:24,590
the crew,
everybody about mythology every year and

48
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:27,710
then when Campbell died,
your friend in mind,

49
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:30,290
Stanley kripner filled in for him.
Oh Wow.

50
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,500
That's interesting.
Wow.

51
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,270
Stanley's amazing.
Till I just saw him a week ago.

52
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:36,104
Dunkin happened to text me while I was 
talking with doing the podcast with 

53
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:41,150
Stanley or just finished and I said,
oh,

54
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,850
you gotta meet my friend Duncan.
He's really interesting.

55
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:44,290
He's,
yeah,

56
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,820
he's a comedian,
but he's really into the spiritual stuff

57
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:47,654
and he just got back from seeing a 
hanging out with Ram das in Hawaii and 

58
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:52,790
Stanley says,
well,

59
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:56,090
does he know that Ron doss was a standup
comedian for a time?

60
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,133
I feel like he got him mixed up with 
Timothy leary because I know timothy 

61
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:00,190
leary

62
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,930
went on tour doing like some some kind 
of thing called stand up,

63
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,460
but I don't think rahm does did it,
but I know Timothy leary tried stand up.

64
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,103
Well,
he said he saw him in the village and 

65
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:16,120
the club does.
Why not?

66
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:17,230
Man?
He's probably on acid.

67
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,660
Richard Alpert.
He was probably thinking,

68
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:20,411
fuck it.
Why not?

69
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:21,910
Let me give it a shot.
I mean,

70
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:22,744
he's a good.
He's a great speaker and he is pretty 

71
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:24,531
funny.
Yeah.

72
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:26,910
You said he's like a very humorous guy 
to talk to him.

73
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,360
He's super funny.
Yeah.

74
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,643
Which is I,
I've noticed that seems to be a quality 

75
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:34,690
and people who have a real spiritual 
practice like funny.

76
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,613
They're always funny.
They always have this real specific non 

77
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,900
bullshit style of humor.
It's really hard to offend them.

78
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,973
That's quite often.
That's how I can tell if somebody's got 

79
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:51,040
a real practice is usually impossible to
offend.

80
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,150
Like there isn't anything that you can 
say that's gonna make them upset,

81
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:55,984
but you know the alarm bells start going
off in my mind when you get around 

82
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:02,110
people who you say something and you 
see,

83
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,600
oh shit,
I triggered the alarm system.

84
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,690
I have offended this person,
which is really curious to me like,

85
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:10,780
how are you?
How are you in tune with the universe?

86
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,913
And yet still something that a monkey 
descendant says out of the end of his 

87
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,394
feeding tube,
it causes you to feel results in 

88
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,660
durable.
If you're so tough.

89
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,160
How you,
why are you such a pussy?

90
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,200
It was a truly,
well,

91
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,880
well not,
not like,

92
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,940
it's like the opposite of tough,
but you know,

93
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,380
I mean I agree like sophisticated.
Well until you know what's going on.

94
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,323
It's the way,
the way they've described it or I've 

95
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:38,330
heard it described,
which is super cool when they,

96
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,443
when they,
whenever they were I'm das talks about 

97
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:42,250
is his guru,
neem Karoli Baba,

98
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,020
is that there was nothing there.
Like there's no obstruction.

99
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:47,854
Like anything.
Everything was just sort of going 

100
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:51,040
through this person,
you know,

101
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,850
as opposed to like me,
I get on the phone with Bank of America,

102
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,090
they've frozen my card because I went to
Australia and like I'm saving with rage.

103
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,280
Fuck.
I haven't another fucking country.

104
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,360
My fucking bank,
you know,

105
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,353
and you know,
or whatever it is that triggers you to 

106
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:12,224
freeze up.
Some people they get to the point 

107
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,960
theoretically or that like convulsive 
seizure,

108
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:19,040
like freezing up.
It

109
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,570
doesn't happen.
I'll tell you,

110
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,463
I can get that in spurts.
I can get done in spurts from Yoga and 

111
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,184
here's what I can prove it.
A guy fucking nailed me on the highway 

112
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,710
while he wasn't paying attention,
hit the brakes,

113
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:30,544
skid.
I watched him plow into my fucking car 

114
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:33,490
and my,
my white Porsche,

115
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,110
the expensive one.
And it's a rare car too.

116
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:36,891
I'm like,
fuck,

117
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:37,724
I hope he didn't total the car.
I got out and the first thing I said 

118
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:41,000
was,
are you okay?

119
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,500
And I go,
I'm okay.

120
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,930
We're cool.
And I literally wasn't upset at all yet.

121
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,490
I wasn't upset but I've been doing yoga 
like four days a week and I was a little

122
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:50,760
high,
you know,

123
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,100
probably still from the afternoon.
I think I was probably like,

124
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,943
at least under the influence of cannabis
to the point where I was like a little 

125
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:58,220
bit more.
But

126
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,480
I just,
I,

127
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,980
I can only get there for like bursts 
when when you're busy with work and life

128
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:08,060
and it can overwhelm and you get mad at 
someone doing a shitty job,

129
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:09,230
parking,
like come on,

130
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:10,410
fuck,
head punk,

131
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,290
your car stupid.
You know,

132
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,730
like you backing up again,
oh my God,

133
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:15,530
look at this retard,
let's get back up again.

134
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,460
And um,
and then I'll be like,

135
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,330
I'll catch myself.
Like,

136
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:22,331
why not even talking to this guy,
this guy's in a car 100 feet from me and

137
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:22,810
I'm,
I'm,

138
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,620
I'm openly mocking him out loud.
Yeah.

139
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:25,960
And

140
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,960
eroding your insides as you do it.
And I heard Wim Hoff talking about this.

141
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,630
Maybe it was on your podcast and he was 
talking about being under the ice in his

142
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:38,630
retinas froze and he couldn't find the 
hole to get out.

143
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,200
And whoever was he was talking with 
asked him like,

144
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,260
so,
you know,

145
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:43,720
what was the panic?
Like what,

146
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,680
what?
And he said,

147
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:46,131
well,
you know,

148
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:46,964
when I'm in those situations or like 
when I got lost in a whiteout on Mount 

149
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,570
Everest in my shorts,
uh,

150
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,510
there's no stress because then it's all 
just like,

151
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,510
it takes you back to yourself to who you
really are.

152
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:02,060
And I know in my,
in my core,

153
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:07,061
I am like a competent and confident.
And uh,

154
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,344
so he was saying it's been demonstrated 
that you can generate more stress 

155
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:13,364
hormones laying in your bed and just 
thinking about something stressful than 

156
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,200
what actually happens when you're in a 
moment of actual danger.

157
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,770
You sort of shift into another gear when
that car hit you,

158
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,480
that changed your whole world.
Right?

159
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:27,314
He's like,
now now you're framing it as am I going 

160
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:30,144
to survive this?
But I knew I was going to survive 

161
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:33,950
because he wasn't going that fast,
but I was just taking.

162
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,140
My car's going to be told you're 
watching him in the rear view mirror.

163
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,320
Yeah,
I was stopped.

164
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,440
And you know,
people,

165
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,343
Dude,
some guy almost hit me today on his 

166
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:41,664
phone with his phone literally on the 
steering wheel as he's texting and 

167
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:46,660
driving and just went right into my 
lane.

168
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,530
I think it's constant.
People are constantly doing it.

169
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:51,690
They're just not paying attention.
And if something happens,

170
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,530
when the guy rear ended me,
the lane was closed for some reason like

171
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:57,290
construction.
So everybody had gotten to that,

172
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,990
that onramp on Hollywood and or the one 
on one and highland exit and it was shut

173
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,170
down for whatever reason.
So we were all stopped at a big line and

174
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:08,004
this dude just barely paid attention and
then all of a sudden shit and I could 

175
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,770
see his face like gritting his teeth 
pulling fan.

176
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,070
I'm watching my rear view tensing up,
my car stalls out,

177
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,790
goes flying into another lane

178
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,720
where you don't want to be on a 
motorcycle.

179
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,643
Oh my God.
Yeah.

180
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,820
Oh my God.
Yeah.

181
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:28,060
That's so dangerous.
If you get hit like that on a motorcycle

182
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:28,894
who you might be paralyzed,
you might be dead it easily and you 

183
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:33,600
can't get off and it's not your fault.
That's the thing.

184
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,880
And I rode a bike for seven and a half 
years and I always felt like I'm,

185
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,330
I've got everything under control,
but there's that,

186
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,900
there's those tiles off if you have the 
time to jump off and get the fuck out of

187
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:45,880
the way.
Well I never,

188
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:48,060
I wasn't like a competitive,
you know,

189
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,910
dad and you see a guy coming from behind
you.

190
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,430
Do you jump off?
You let it hit you?

191
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:56,070
What the fuck do do?
I don't

192
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,903
know,
but you're hyper aware of all the space 

193
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:01,410
around you on a bike.
So I'm always.

194
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:04,560
If I'm stopped and I know like on a 
highway situation,

195
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,633
I'm always watching behind me because 
you feel you developed that vulnerable 

196
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,600
sense.
Scary man.

197
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,720
Bikes back.
Remember Bill Byrd

198
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,490
telling us what he has I guess at the 
Ice House.

199
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:19,180
He's like riding a motorcycle is like,
imagine sitting on the.

200
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,360
If your car driving that way.
He looked down at the road buzzing by at

201
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:29,760
70 miles an hour and it's like I could 
reach out my toe and just grind it off,

202
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,623
you know?
Yeah.

203
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,460
Yeah.
But you know,

204
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:33,294
but it's like,
it's like a metaphor for so many other 

205
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:35,700
things in life,
right?

206
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,983
Do you really want to be set?
You want to have the illusion of 

207
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:41,364
separation or do you.
Are you actually safer being intimate 

208
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:50,310
with the danger of what's going on?
So you're hypervigilant because in a car

209
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:51,144
you're looking at your phone,
you're fucking with the radio because 

210
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:54,174
you've got the sense that I'm in a room 
and everything's cool until he hit the 

211
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:58,080
tree,
you know,

212
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,683
there's definitely that you can 
definitely get to detach and as things 

213
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:02,784
get more and more automated,
it's going to be weirder and weirder as 

214
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,000
a.
Now you can tell your car things like,

215
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:09,690
uh,
like you've used that.

216
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,800
Hey,
Siri function.

217
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,590
Yes.
You.

218
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,040
So you asked your car to text people,
text people,

219
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,920
tell us to send less time.
I was on your podcast.

220
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,430
You did this whole thing and I saw a 
bunch of people tweeted,

221
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:24,370
like,
fucked up my phone off.

222
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,300
They're listed in the fuck in the car 
because I'm like,

223
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:28,980
how hard is it for you to press the 
button?

224
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:30,870
All I have to do is press the button and
then I say it,

225
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,470
you know?
Yeah.

226
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,430
I don't have to uh,
to say that do the Hey Siri thing.

227
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:39,240
But my point being is they have the 
Tesla's now that they're coming with,

228
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,460
they have a new download that allows you
to have your car automate itself.

229
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,120
Like you set the directions and it 
navigates drives.

230
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,920
Yeah,
it fucking drives itself.

231
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,023
So like then it's gonna get real weird 
when we switched back and forth between 

232
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:58,941
that and then actual driving like the 
space out factor of people.

233
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:02,130
Like when they have to drive again,
they might not be used to it.

234
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,193
Yeah.
It's the space between automation and 

235
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,260
like semi automation and full automation
that is going to be really dangerous.

236
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:12,020
But man,
that dream as you leave your house,

237
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,050
your car looks like a little living 
room,

238
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,900
a little pod with a couch in it.
Coffeemaker,

239
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,793
a TV and you just sit on the couch,
tell the car where it take me to vegas 

240
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,740
and it just takes you there and you just
relax on the sleep.

241
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,813
You can look out the window.
The interstates are just going to look 

242
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:31,550
like houses.
Yeah.

243
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,400
She miss you with your aviator.
Sunglasses on the gloves hair.

244
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,330
You driving gloves about driving shoes.
Let's get crazy.

245
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,210
Oh yeah.
It was a little nervous driving shoes.

246
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,640
That's shifting the gears.
Let's say you have like a,

247
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,570
an old Fiat or something.
Cool.

248
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:51,300
Will you look like you're a poet or 
something?

249
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,143
Sure.
I'm sure there are people back scarf 

250
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:58,060
over your shoulder.
I'm sure there were a carriage drivers.

251
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,690
Imagine,
think of missing that last last.

252
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,180
The horses back smell or the farts like 
everyone always.

253
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,540
There's a nostalgia attached to 
antiquated technologies,

254
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,650
but it's like,
sure,

255
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,484
great,
but I'm going to be sitting in my 

256
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:21,160
pleasure pod with vr goggles on is I get
taken to Florida.

257
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,323
We're off the sacred river flows,
which are missing the pleasure of the 

258
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,280
wooden wheel.
Losing traction on the muddy road.

259
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,610
Exactly the box,
not aerodynamic box.

260
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:37,460
Being dragged by horses starts to go 
sideways near the edge of the cliff.

261
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,660
What an adventure.
What a great time to be alive,

262
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,570
but I don't even have to ride the horse.
I can ride in a box behind the horse.

263
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,613
Not our technology is awesome.
Progress being that box with fine silk 

264
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,653
like seeding.
Everything would be made with pushup 

265
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,910
Bra.
The core sets,

266
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,940
the core sets lots of ruffled skirts.
Fucking trying to bang a chick,

267
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:03,880
one of those skirts.
Which disaster.

268
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,680
Okay.
Then you've got to make a choice.

269
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,560
Either you don't see her vagina or you 
don't see your face.

270
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:13,180
It's one or the other.
He can't have it both ways.

271
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,260
If you push that thing up,
she's gone.

272
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:28,350
Hold on.
You know his citic Jews have sex through

273
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:30,364
a sheet with a gun in it.
My friend John Joke about it that the 

274
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:35,160
women used to look.
Look at the clothes line.

275
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:40,161
So you had the biggest hole,
Jon Tobin.

276
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,820
The thing.
Think about that stuff man.

277
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:46,930
Like who's the for like someone had to 
be the first person to be like,

278
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:49,670
you know what?
Let's put a big sheet over you and cut a

279
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:52,480
hole right over your pussy so I don't 
see you anymore.

280
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,290
Like that.
Didn't evolve,

281
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,153
didn't even touch it.
It's not just a not see you that your 

282
00:13:57,641 --> 00:14:00,280
bodies don't touch to.
So someone invented that though,

283
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:01,630
right?
There was a person who's like,

284
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,523
I've got an idea.
Let's start putting the women in 

285
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:08,020
blankets and fucking a whole right.
It doesn't evolve,

286
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,690
right Chris?
It's like there's a per.

287
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:14,140
There's one person who's incredibly 
crazy,

288
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:16,530
I guess evolved,
you know,

289
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,040
it may have just been like a hankie over
someone's face initially,

290
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,600
you know,
and then it grew.

291
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,210
You can never know.
It may have started as a blindfold,

292
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,430
but you,
it implies the communication about it.

293
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,110
Like you have to tell your friends like,
well,

294
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:29,944
you know,
I put a handkerchief over her face last 

295
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,423
night.
Maybe you guys should start doing that 

296
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:34,903
with even crazier that it took off.
It's not like one guy doing it like 

297
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:39,484
Hasidic Jews.
It's a huge population of people in 

298
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,660
America.
In New York City.

299
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,960
There's a very big community of acidic 
Jews and they're all doing that with the

300
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:50,940
blanket.
I don't know if they do.

301
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,913
I don't know the.
And I think the women all shaved their 

302
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:57,950
heads and were widows to shave.
I see it as an x,

303
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,130
no makeup and no talking.

304
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,560
What the fuck?
Damn team.

305
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:09,440
They had to wear a wig.
I think about it and the Arabs make them

306
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,274
cover their hair right here.
I think it's an expression of anti 

307
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,970
eroticism,
anti pleasure,

308
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,030
right?
You're only going to have kids.

309
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:20,840
There's no pleasure involved.
So we're going to do as much as possible

310
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,340
to remove everything that is in purely 
functional.

311
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,360
You know,
the thing that you're talking about,

312
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:27,194
the Tesla thing.
The thing is bizarre about that is in 

313
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:31,250
the fine print,
it says it's in Beta.

314
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,970
You went to your car,
self driving car that's in Beta.

315
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,630
It says that they're not responsible for
any accident.

316
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:44,060
So you should always watch the road and 
be prepared to step in if something goes

317
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:44,511
wrong.
Like,

318
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:47,690
well thanks for nothing.
Back in my computer making days.

319
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:51,960
I used to have friends that would get 
the latest builds of software of um,

320
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,660
um,
operating systems rather.

321
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,643
And so they would run like Beta versions
of like new windows operating systems 

322
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:02,540
and the shit was always crashing,
but it was kind of half of the fun half.

323
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,610
The Fun for those guys was like saying,
hey man,

324
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:06,360
I'm using windows nt,
you know,

325
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,570
Blah Blah Blah and this is the new shit 
and it's really only for server.

326
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:14,030
So I have to have a workaround with 
certain drivers for video cards.

327
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:16,070
You know,
there's all this crazy shit they used to

328
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:16,904
do.
Remember though is like when you got 

329
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:22,940
windows,
you had to get this giant pack of desks.

330
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,890
Sometimes you'd get two of these tubes 
filled with those things.

331
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,700
Remember,
you would start off with a floppy.

332
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,113
You'd have to start out with a floppy 
that was like your install your foods 

333
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,790
that worked.
The floppy was like,

334
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,920
you'd stick that in and then you'd have 
to stick cd roms and like,

335
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,660
what the fuck?
All right.

336
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,220
My first exposure to computers was when 
I worked in real estate in New York,

337
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,830
in the diamond district full of Hasidic 
Jews.

338
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:50,830
That's there you go.
Uh,

339
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,873
and uh,
the guy had a computers the size of a 

340
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:56,990
refrigerator and one of my jobs was to 
backup the discs every week.

341
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,123
And you'd pull out these drawers and put
this thing down and turn it and pull it 

342
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:03,290
out.
And the disc was about that big.

343
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,840
You're showing your hands like an album 
a lot bigger than an album.

344
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:10,280
Yeah.
Like I'm large pizza,

345
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,280
a large pizza that Herman Biggs was on 
that,

346
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:13,910
I don't know.

347
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,040
I think it was megabytes.
Oh my God.

348
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,590
That's hilarious.
This was 86 or so.

349
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,070
That's so funny.
It's so funny.

350
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:24,140
Like the amount of storage space that we
have now,

351
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,750
it's kind of nuts and then also like 
that.

352
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:27,584
So much of it is in the cloud.
But if you'd noticed like on the new 

353
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:35,051
iphone software,
you're doesn't download all your songs.

354
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,253
It shows you all your songs,
but when you go to play them it streams 

355
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,100
them.
Yeah.

356
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,620
I don't get that because I want the shit
on my phone.

357
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:46,100
So if I'm not connected or I don't have 
to pay for the data,

358
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:49,590
it's my fucking state.
I got 128 gigs on my phone,

359
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:50,040
fill it with

360
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,570
music.
I can't sit here and how to do it.

361
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,663
Well you set it so that it's available 
offline and then you download all of 

362
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:57,390
them.
You have to download all of them.

363
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,940
It's super annoying.
I didn't know hotel the other day.

364
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,690
It's like now downloading 847 songs and 
I was like,

365
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:04,860
what?
The fuck,

366
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,023
but you know when you're in a place that
doesn't have cell phone service and 

367
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:10,620
you'd go to your music list.
I was trying to use it in the gym.

368
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:11,580
There was no service.
It was like,

369
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,720
Oh,
you fuckers,

370
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:15,240
it's not on my phone,
and I had to figure it out.

371
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,770
It's complaints back in the day.
Yeah.

372
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,810
It wasn't your complaint in the carriage
and your fucking slippery right over the

373
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:25,614
top of the mountain where you might wind
up eating all your friends because you 

374
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,853
gets stuck up there.
Crazy man that we are constantly 

375
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,513
surrounded by some cloud of invisible 
data that consists of all information 

376
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,990
that has ever been recorded.

377
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,420
That's crazy.
Did you hear about that guy?

378
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,750
That was.
He went to see.

379
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,593
He got shipwrecked at sea for like over 
a year with another guy and he made it 

380
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:51,804
by like drinking rain water,
needing turtles and all kinds of crazy 

381
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,160
shit,
but it's the nuttiest stories.

382
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:56,994
They're kind of raft for a fucking year,
but his companions family is now suing 

383
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:04,930
him because they say that he hates them.
Yeah.

384
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,130
He ate the other guy,
the Mexican guy.

385
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,530
The Mexican fisherman,
they Mexican,

386
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,360
I dunno,
I dunno if they're Mexican,

387
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,373
but just the thought behind it.
Jim Probably stores just the thought 

388
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,960
behind it and banks sued.
That's what's funny.

389
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,410
It's cannibalism.
It's on a criminal complaint.

390
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,273
It's a civil suit.
I don't know what it is because I don't 

391
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:26,424
know if it's American.
I don't know if they have a different 

392
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:29,250
legal system.
I don't even know what it is,

393
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,084
but I don't even know if they're suing 
or if they're trying to accuse him out 

394
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,220
and murdering him or something.

395
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,480
Eating them.
It's the eating that bothered,

396
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,010
but if he's dead,
eat him.

397
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,600
Well,
he said that's what I say.

398
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,200
Eat me if I die,
but what they say is that this guy shirt

399
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:44,034
by the way,
was claiming that he kept the dude on 

400
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:47,750
the boat with them for company for six 
days.

401
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:50,490
Then throw them overboard.
They sued for $1,000,000

402
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:52,320
for you,
but here's the thing,

403
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:57,120
like how they prove that he ain't.
How do you even accuse a guy?

404
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,250
I think he.
He talked about it.

405
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,830
He talked to me yet because he's 
Salvadorian,

406
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:02,664
but they got.
They were in Mexico and they got swept 

407
00:20:04,591 --> 00:20:07,380
out that I've read about this one.
So he talked about eating the guy.

408
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,233
Yeah.
So I think that's how the story says 

409
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:15,930
that he just threw the guy overboard.
It seems like you would want your family

410
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:18,600
member to have like given his life for 
somebody.

411
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:22,050
It kind of makes your family member or a
hero or lots of cultures.

412
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:25,110
Ether did you know when someone dies 
they eat them.

413
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,450
Yeah.
And it's an honor that is incredible.

414
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:29,310
More than a year and see,
um,

415
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,940
see if,
uh,

416
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,773
he admitted dreamy find it safe anywhere
he admitted he paid this guy to 

417
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,190
accompany him on a short fishing trip 
off the coast of Mexico.

418
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,740
Wow.
Yeah.

419
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,560
And he wrote a book.
So they want the money from the book.

420
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,370
Yeah.
He might be right

421
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,650
or you might have ate that dude.

422
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,380
It looks like it looks like you need to 
do,

423
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,910
you know,
I used to think it.

424
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,930
I think most people think some cultures 
were just cannibals for the hell of it,

425
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,240
you know,
like they were just especially evil,

426
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,980
right.
The aztecs or whatever.

427
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,300
And then others just weren't,
but you know,

428
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,740
if you think about it,
it doesn't make sense.

429
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:11,550
So Europeans killed just as many people 
as the aztecs did.

430
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,070
They were just as ruthless.
They're burning them at the stake,

431
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:15,210
you know,
they even cook them,

432
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,280
but they didn't need him.
Right?

433
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,420
Right.
So then I read this guy,

434
00:21:18,421 --> 00:21:19,254
Marvin Harris,
this anthropologist who wrote a book 

435
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:21,894
called Cannibals and kings.
He went back and looked at societies 

436
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:26,520
that were cannibalistic and those that 
weren't,

437
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,730
especially in the South Pacific because 
some islands worse.

438
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:32,310
I'm islands weren't whatever.
And in Latin America.

439
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:37,490
And what he determined was that the 
societies that were cannibalistic had,

440
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,410
um,
a lack of protein,

441
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,710
there were no animals that could be 
domesticated.

442
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,470
And so when they killed people in 
battle,

443
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,740
they ate them because they were protein 
hungry or starved.

444
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,680
And.
But Europeans had plenty of domesticated

445
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:53,514
animals.
So they didn't need the protein because 

446
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:57,630
they had the goats and the pigs and 
whatever.

447
00:21:57,631 --> 00:21:58,464
But if you think about Mexico,
there's nothing that they could 

448
00:22:00,211 --> 00:22:01,044
domesticate except turkeys or dogs or 
animals that eat the same food as 

449
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:05,904
humans.
So you need to domesticate an animal 

450
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:09,450
that doesn't eat what humans eat,
so it's not competing.

451
00:22:09,451 --> 00:22:12,570
Right.
And there were not in in North America.

452
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:13,620
So that's why they were cannibals.

453
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,990
Wow,
that's crazy.

454
00:22:15,991 --> 00:22:17,340
That's fascinating.
It.

455
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,213
It's also important to note that I.
One of the key tenants of Catholicism 

456
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,270
involves the kind of metaphysical 
cannibalism,

457
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,780
which is,
you know,

458
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,230
at the,
at the communion,

459
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,083
the body of current body of Christ,
and they call that conversion of the 

460
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,730
wafer into the flesh of Christ.
They have a name.

461
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:38,730
They think that when you're,
when the priest is doing the ritual,

462
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,540
it's turning it into the flesh of Jesus.
The trends.

463
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,403
Transubstantiation is the name for it,
and that's where you're shifting the 

464
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:50,640
wafer into the flesh of a god that 
you're eating.

465
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,170
But that's totally real.
Oh,

466
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,260
that's totally,
totally real.

467
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,640
You can taste it,
but they get the right stuff.

468
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,613
It's kosher.
Many of them do think that that it is 

469
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:00,170
real.
It's,

470
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,640
it's Godflesh,
which is actually a really old,

471
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,310
that's a very old tradition,
which is you eat,

472
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,173
you eat a god,
you eat the sacrifice God to get its 

473
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,303
energy or something.
What high deval originated with 

474
00:23:11,311 --> 00:23:12,490
entheogens?
There's no,

475
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,620
no doubt that at all.

476
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,623
Immediately what I thought of is the 
Amanita muscarinic where the 

477
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,380
psychoactive component stays active 
after it's metabolized.

478
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,100
So the pis of the Shaman who's eating 
almond eaters,

479
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,450
Scalia will get you high as shit.
Yeah.

480
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:27,950
I just saw they fed them piss

481
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,873
at that.
Apparently Amany to Ms Dot Mascara is 

482
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,640
very hard to get.
Right.

483
00:23:31,641 --> 00:23:33,650
I've never,
I've never gotten hired off of it.

484
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:35,180
I had,
we tried it once,

485
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,014
it didn't work,
but then we tried siliciden mushrooms 

486
00:23:38,841 --> 00:23:43,841
with it and we had a fucking insane 
journey so they might've worked together

487
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,910
and sort of sort of synergistic way.
But um,

488
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,183
apparently by itself it's really hard 
and they think that it might be like a 

489
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,304
geographical variant like and then also 
like seasonally and then genetically 

490
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:57,344
like you have to get the right stuff and
the right stuff might not even exist in 

491
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,520
most places anymore.
Right.

492
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,660
That's pretty interesting,
isn't it?

493
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:03,494
All that follow the last pharmacology 
they staff they will never even know 

494
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,340
about.
Like a Soma Soma.

495
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,540
Yeah.
What is it like?

496
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,450
What is this stuff you hear about this 
all the time?

497
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:19,310
All of these old technologies that are 
just gone in the illusion mysteries.

498
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,680
I didn't realize this until recently.
The Shamsi Lazy Lazy days or however you

499
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:27,530
pronounce it in Paris.
That's the illusion.

500
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,603
Mushrooms,
so it translates is illusion and 

501
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,750
mushrooms shops,
right?

502
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:36,530
Jumping Melanie's.
There's unquestionably without a doubt.

503
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,600
There were people that lived a long time
ago,

504
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:43,280
the discovered psychedelic plants they 
had to have and all.

505
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,114
You have to just consider.
I mean this is the most rational way to 

506
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,460
look at it.
If you lived at that time and you had no

507
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:51,560
science,
you had some,

508
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,980
some myths and fables and some rules to 
live by and you found those things,

509
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,650
you would think that you had found God.
You would definitely think if you,

510
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,900
if you just ate,
you don't have a scale.

511
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,913
You're just eating these mushrooms that 
you find and you eat 10 grams of them 

512
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,110
could lord,
you're going to meet God.

513
00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:11,540
You literally will be transported to 
God.

514
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,583
I never let you know.
People will listen to this kind of shit 

515
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:15,170
and they'll go,
oh man,

516
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:16,360
that's so stupid.
No,

517
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,650
you're just tripping.
He's just hallucinating.

518
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,410
You got to take this into consideration.
I know I've said it before,

519
00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:24,800
but it is important to repeat when you 
haven't experienced.

520
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,663
It doesn't matter if that experience is 
like you could put a scale or hit it 

521
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:31,250
with a stick.
It's a real experience.

522
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,443
So you,
even though you're no one's saying that 

523
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:38,510
you're meeting God when you do 
mushrooms,

524
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,930
but what I am saying is it's the same 
thing as meeting God.

525
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,580
Like the experience is so profound that 
you.

526
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,770
It would be like doing that.
It would be like having.

527
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,750
When you do DMT,
perfect example,

528
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:55,430
it is like meeting the highest power 
around you.

529
00:25:55,431 --> 00:26:00,110
It's like meeting a god.
It's like eating a sea of gods.

530
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,730
It feels like there's a place where 
things can be both true and untrue.

531
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,563
I think you know,
and and what you're talking about is 

532
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:09,470
that overlap for me.
It's where,

533
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,390
you know,
like placebo effect.

534
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,201
You say,
well,

535
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:13,420
it's just a sugar pill.
Yeah,

536
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:15,980
it's just a sugar pill,
but it has demonstrable,

537
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:18,380
measurable,
repeatable effects on people.

538
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,290
Hypnosis is another one,
like wow,

539
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,180
the fuck does that work?
Nobody's explained this and,

540
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:27,230
and I think when,
when you're talking about seeing God,

541
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:28,064
that is ultimately a subjective 
experience that happened or didn't and 

542
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:33,890
if it did,
then it did.

543
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:37,160
And there's no,
there's no one from outside who can say,

544
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,930
ah,
it's just bullshit or that you know,

545
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:44,020
some sort of Richard Dawkins denial of 
the sacred because you experienced

546
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,530
it.
And so I'm sort of sympathetic.

547
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:47,364
I mean,
I trash religion as much as the next 

548
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:49,884
guy,
but I'm sympathetic for the experience 

549
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:53,520
of someone who says,
look,

550
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:55,350
I go there,
I have these rituals,

551
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:56,184
I smell that stuff.
I was raised in this tradition and I am 

552
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:02,520
transported to another world that makes 
my life better.

553
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,500
I can't say that's not real despite the 
bullshit of the Bible or whatever.

554
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,720
Yeah.
No,

555
00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:09,491
I agree with you.
I,

556
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:10,760
you know,
I think is problematic.

557
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:12,860
Is the label,
like even how I said it,

558
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,060
like you'll meet God like that.
Just that word is so loaded.

559
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,550
Right.
That's,

560
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,383
that's a big part of the problem,
a big part of the problem with just the 

561
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:21,974
idea of religious religious ideas like 
forget about the words that you're 

562
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:27,944
using,
whether you're using the word prayer or 

563
00:27:30,021 --> 00:27:34,580
scripture or whatever the name you have 
for your deity.

564
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,590
Those are just noise is you're making 
and they correspond to like whatever the

565
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:44,591
cultural context is of the Hindu God or 
the Christian God,

566
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,680
but if you just think of the feeling of 
wanting to be a good Christian,

567
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,520
right?
The feeling of wanting to please God.

568
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,820
Not by billowing up abortion clinics or 
any.

569
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,663
There's none of that.
None of the wacky aspects of it that we 

570
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:03,020
sort of connect to it.

571
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:07,640
We think about like radical fundamental 
religion on any side of the fence,

572
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,533
right?
But with the feeling that you're 

573
00:28:09,891 --> 00:28:11,240
getting,
like you're feeling.

574
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:15,110
If you're all together in church and you
really are praising his name,

575
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,153
you really are praising the idea of this
loving God that wants fellowship and 

576
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:21,284
wants camaraderie and brotherhood.
Like whatever that feeling is and 

577
00:28:24,351 --> 00:28:26,780
whatever that thought is.
Take out all the words,

578
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:32,020
Jesus Christ and you know,
praise Jesus and Buddha and Muhammad and

579
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:35,390
Allah,
and take out all those words and what is

580
00:28:35,391 --> 00:28:40,250
the feeling like that feeling is search 
for this positive,

581
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,623
this positive source,
like this thing that ultimately we can 

582
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:46,034
all eventually reach if we put aside all
of our ridiculous monkey behavior and 

583
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:55,241
greed and jealousy and anger and lust 
and just get to us at our very best,

584
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,213
you know,
and it's almost like it's like a guide 

585
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,503
to get you there,
but we get tripped up on the words that 

586
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:02,594
are attached to the guide,
like the word God or the word Muhammad 

587
00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:06,404
or the morgue.
Allah or Krishna Krishna go down the 

588
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:10,680
line

589
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,680
and the fucking parasites that latch on 
to this and start selling shit.

590
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:20,040
And you know,
making a structure around the rules.

591
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,903
Controlling people with Duncan started 
off talking about how you can recognize 

592
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:28,440
someone not just as a spiritually 
enlightened person,

593
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:30,240
but as a just a person you want to hang 
out with.

594
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,750
If they are really hard to offend,
if they have a good sense of humor,

595
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,780
if they don't have a sense of humor,
there's something wrong,

596
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,683
you know,
and but you think about the Old 

597
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:40,134
Testament God,
he's the most easily offended 

598
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:44,620
motherfucker imaginable.
You know,

599
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:47,290
like the book of job.
If you ever read the book of job,

600
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,393
it's fucking amazing.
Like job is this great guy does 

601
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:51,964
everything he's supposed to do.
Everything's cool and the devil and God 

602
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:58,450
are hanging out one day.
And the devil's like that.

603
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,520
God,
the devil says like,

604
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:02,170
people don't really like you so much,
man.

605
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:03,490
You know,
you think everybody loves you.

606
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:04,930
And God's like.
Of course people love me.

607
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:06,220
Look at job.
He's perfect.

608
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,160
He does everything I tell him.
And the devil is like,

609
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,360
yeah,
but he only does what you tell him cause

610
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:11,194
you've been good to him.
Fuck with them a little bit and you'll 

611
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:13,804
see what happened.
So God being the fucked up asshole that 

612
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,020
he is apparently killed job's wife and 
kids.

613
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,500
You know,
that's not a,

614
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,720
it's not meant to be taken literally 
though.

615
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,130
I mean,
that's not a literal,

616
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,290
that's a.
that's a story of the fact that,

617
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,980
no,

618
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,770
God,
Duncan,

619
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:34,150
of course it's to be taken literally.
You question what kind of truck driver,

620
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,003
motherfucker.
This is how cocky Duncan is dark and 

621
00:30:37,111 --> 00:30:38,070
it's like,
well,

622
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,003
I think what Jesus really taught wasn't 
so good with his words back and since 

623
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:49,750
I've gone to college in North Carolina,
he's got a phd.

624
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,780
I had been talking to God,
God gave me a phd,

625
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,920
but no,
I think that you run into trouble if you

626
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,830
start looking at mythology and like is 
though.

627
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:02,020
That's really what it means.
I get to actually do it,

628
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,080
but look at the god that's being 
depicted.

629
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:07,150
There were,
there was whatever the story is,

630
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:08,980
he's easily,
he's jealous,

631
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,050
he's capricious,
he's cruel,

632
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,650
he's a fucking alcoholic father.
But that's.

633
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,330
So if you look at it,

634
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,580
the universe,
like right now at this moment,

635
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,470
mothers are dying of cancer,
kids are getting exploded by bombs.

636
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,850
All of it.
Dogs are attacking fucking old people in

637
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:27,900
the farm.
Like,

638
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:28,734
you know what I mean?
So this is the story of job has always 

639
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:35,880
struck me more as a kind of like a story
of how look man,

640
00:31:35,881 --> 00:31:40,350
you can't understand the infinite.
Like when I step on an ant,

641
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,060
you know what I mean?
To me it's like,

642
00:31:42,061 --> 00:31:42,894
well I stepped on an ant today to it,
but for whatever that aunt tiny little 

643
00:31:46,561 --> 00:31:50,460
subjective universe happens to be,
I've completely obliterated it.

644
00:31:50,461 --> 00:31:51,294
I wiped it out that and could never 
possibly understand the internet action 

645
00:31:54,661 --> 00:31:57,180
that just happened there.
But it was a real interaction.

646
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,490
So it seems like the story of job is 
more like,

647
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,653
what the fuck are you universe?
This incredible thing that I'm 

648
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:04,374
surrounded by that seems to vary 
capriciously at random times just 

649
00:32:08,521 --> 00:32:11,970
destroy people and lives and like,
shit man.

650
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,970
I just heard about this family driving 
under an underpass and that like a bird,

651
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,540
like a concrete block fell out of a 
truck,

652
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,690
landed on the Goddamn Range Rover.
Damn.

653
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,630
Entire family zapped out of this 
universe.

654
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,030
And to me job was.
That's the stats,

655
00:32:27,031 --> 00:32:31,470
what the story is like how,
how can someone be a servant of love?

656
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:32,304
Like what you were talking about,
how can someone connect to this desire 

657
00:32:35,731 --> 00:32:36,564
to like give love and happiness and joy 
into the universe when it any second 

658
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:46,450
guaranteed for any human being there 
could be in there will be a tragedy,

659
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,210
more devastating than anything you could
ever imagine because that's just the way

660
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:52,340
the world works.
You're going to die.

661
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,181
Your,
your,

662
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:53,870
your,
your,

663
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,100
your,
your wife,

664
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,930
your family,
your friends.

665
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,793
This is the reality we're in.
And how in that kind of swirling vortex 

666
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:02,864
of chaos and violence,
do you find a place where regardless of 

667
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:06,494
all of that,
you will still be committed as much as 

668
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:09,990
you can,
uh,

669
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:10,790
to,
to,

670
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,600
to do that thing you did on the road 
when the fucking car hit here instead of

671
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:17,460
getting out and fucking pummeling the 
guy because you're agenda,

672
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,530
adrenaline's flowing.

673
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,011
You ask,
Hey,

674
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:20,810
are you all right?
That's wild.

675
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,420
I mean,
to you it might seem like not that big a

676
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:24,254
deal,
but if everyone on planet earth started 

677
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,110
doing that,
Whoa,

678
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,400
Holy Shit.
It'd be a whole new.

679
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:29,040
Uh,

680
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,420
I think,
I think,

681
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,310
uh,
I mean I agree with what you're saying,

682
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:37,311
but I think there's an underlying is s 
assertion of the cruelty of the universe

683
00:33:38,431 --> 00:33:41,340
that I think is distorted.
Okay.

684
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,870
I think that,
you know,

685
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:43,704
I was watching this nature program a 
couple of weeks ago and there was a 

686
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:46,944
seal,
I may have even talked with you about 

687
00:33:48,181 --> 00:33:50,970
this last time when it was on,
but there was like a seal playing in the

688
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:53,790
waves and then you hear the like do,
do,

689
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:54,610
do,
do,

690
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:58,980
do and you see the shadow coming up and 
it's a great white and it hits the seal.

691
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,230
And then they,
the guy,

692
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:05,190
the narrator actually says we slow this 
down to a one 40th of normal speed,

693
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:07,890
right?
And you see the teeth of the and the,

694
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,520
and the seals flopping around and 
there's blood everywhere.

695
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,920
And,
and in the meanwhile the narrator saying

696
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:16,350
the struggle for survival isn't ever 
over.

697
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,560
And so I'm watching that and I'm 
thinking,

698
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,620
well,
but seal seemed Kinda happy to me.

699
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,483
Right?
Like how come they're not more stressed 

700
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:25,494
out?
Because all the seals I've seen relying 

701
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,960
on rocks and chilling,
chilling,

702
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,770
and bargain and having fun.
So I looked up.

703
00:34:31,771 --> 00:34:34,890
This seal is a harbor seal.
I think they lived to be about 30.

704
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:37,350
So let's say this one's in its prime.
It's 25.

705
00:34:37,351 --> 00:34:39,540
Okay.
It's whole fucking life.

706
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:42,030
It's been lying on warm rocks and eaten 
fresh fish.

707
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,410
And then in half a second it's dead.
Okay.

708
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,800
And we're looking at that as evidence of
the cruelty of nature.

709
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,590
That what's the ratio there?
You know,

710
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,730
what's the ratio of good days to bad 
days?

711
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,120
It seems like it's pretty fucking good.
True.

712
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:02,510
And I read this amazing account of being
pounced on by Elian by,

713
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:07,170
I think it was who searched for 
Livingston in,

714
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,930
in Africa.
I remember livings,

715
00:35:08,931 --> 00:35:10,440
Dr Livingston,
I presume.

716
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,640
Anyway,
that guy,

717
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,193
he got pants on by a lion and he talks 
about how he didn't describe it this 

718
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:17,094
way,
but the endorphins that are released 

719
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,570
when you're dying,
right?

720
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,180
Especially in prey animals.
And he was completely detached,

721
00:35:24,181 --> 00:35:27,780
completely relaxed.
Watching this lion tossing him around.

722
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,003
Well,
they think there's an evolutionary 

723
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:30,384
advantage to both species,
both the Predator and the prey in them 

724
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:36,480
having this endorphin release when they 
get got,

725
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,640
because when,
when lions

726
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,420
attack like antelopes or with big cats 
catch deer,

727
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,110
the deer kind of given man,
they get Jack,

728
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:47,220
they nexia,
but they don't.

729
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,250
They kind of like fight a little and 
then they kind of give in,

730
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,000
but like bears,
like those kind of animals,

731
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:57,160
they don't really give in like that,
so they don't like if a,

732
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,003
if a cat and a mountain lion or or or a 
mountain line rather than a bear go at 

733
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:04,550
it like the bear isn't just going to 
give in to the mountain lion.

734
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,900
As the mountain lion bites the bear and 
it's neck,

735
00:36:06,901 --> 00:36:07,734
the bear is going to try to turn and 
bite them back and they're going to 

736
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,313
tooth and claw it out.
They're not going to give wonder if he 

737
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,760
would give into a dinosaur.
Whew.

738
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,623
That's a good point.
Something where the power is 

739
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,960
overwhelming and you feel it.

740
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,580
Like there's.
I ain't getting out of this.

741
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,560
If that.
What triggers the release?

742
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:23,394
That's a very good point.
That thing that you're talking about 

743
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:29,781
right there is the secret of happiness,
which is that fucking release because if

744
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:31,530
you really look at it,
man,

745
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:37,250
we are in the mouth of a super predator.
It's the entire universe and it's slowly

746
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:42,921
killing us right now that it's true.
It's like,

747
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:45,870
I mean,
it does sound like dire,

748
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,733
but on one level it sounds dire,
but then the idea is like you have to 

749
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:53,910
accept the situation that you're in and 
it is true.

750
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,180
We are like being like we're in the 
mouth of the most incredible,

751
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,690
most powerful,
most omnipresent thing ever.

752
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,730
We earlier when you were talking about,
uh,

753
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,290
you know,
you smoked Dmt,

754
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,630
you have this experience of God.
You see God,

755
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:07,464
whatever it is you have,
you see this incredible matrix of 

756
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:12,990
consciousness or when you're on a per 
theoretically on Ios guy.

757
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,913
I haven't done it in mushrooms,
but the funny thing about it is right 

758
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:22,971
now minus the Psychedelic,
you are surrounded by an entire universe

759
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,993
of which pieces of the universe are 
alive and aware of you and are talking 

760
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:28,344
to you,
to psychedelics sorta just force feeds 

761
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:32,900
you that reality exactly,
or it paints it to.

762
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,100
It puts a different coat of paint on top
of it,

763
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,110
so now it seems unique novel again,
but you,

764
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,163
you.
It's just another level of the same 

765
00:37:41,281 --> 00:37:42,114
experiences happening,
which is that you are surrounded by a 

766
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:47,550
living,
partially living,

767
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,900
a universe that has a tendency from time
to time to produce life.

768
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,473
This universe that we're in produces 
life and you're part of it and you're 

769
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,900
surrounded by an infinite ocean of that 
tendency,

770
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,870
so that's very overwhelming I think for 
people,

771
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,700
which is why they begin to accept that 
this was just completely normal.

772
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:09,480
This thing,
this,

773
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,970
and then that's when you take the 
psychedelic and you're like,

774
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:14,490
Holy Shit,
I saw God.

775
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,390
It's like,
no.

776
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,030
You saw the exact same thing that you've
been seeing.

777
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,700
It's only that you saw it in a different
form.

778
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:21,534
For whatever reason,
people don't want to accept this stuff 

779
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:26,220
that's happening around us right now as 
God.

780
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,530
They don't want to accept it.
They don't accept that.

781
00:38:28,531 --> 00:38:31,380
What this thing is around us is super 
natural.

782
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:35,040
It's crazy to see.
This is what Joe was talking earlier,

783
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,020
a

784
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,853
foragers finding these substances.
I was thinking exactly what you're 

785
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:40,414
talking about because we take those 
substances and it's like a revelation 

786
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,100
and the veil is pulled back.
What is the veil?

787
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,113
The veil is culture.
We live in a culture that is constantly 

788
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:54,880
trying to put out the fire of mystery in
us.

789
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,210
It's constantly saying,
no life is about having this car,

790
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,970
this kind of house.
Get a new air conditioner,

791
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:01,990
go to work.
Don't,

792
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,853
don't be looking for mystery.
Just go to work and punch the fucking 

793
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:05,560
clock.
All right,

794
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,200
go work in your mind or your cubicle or 
whatever.

795
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,603
It's trying,
constantly trying to get us to accept 

796
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:14,080
this bum fucking deal,
right?

797
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:17,410
Whereas foragers,
they're surrounded by mystery everyday,

798
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,070
everyday everything's alive.
Everything is full of spirit.

799
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,640
There's the spirit of the river.
The spirit of the clouds,

800
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,810
the spirit of the air,
they're surrounded by spirits,

801
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,003
so I wonder what their experience with 
psychedelics is like because I don't 

802
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:31,264
think it has.
I mean I'm sure it heightens everything 

803
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:37,090
and is amazing and obviously has as 
sacred value,

804
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:42,690
but I don't think it has that same 
revelatory aspect

805
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,933
for regulatory thing because they're not
confined to the bullshit of like 

806
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,263
buildings and streets and traffic lights
and taxes and all these things that we 

807
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:53,884
hold in the forefront of our mind,
our consciousness that are really just 

808
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,780
retarded.
We've created these things.

809
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,673
The most of the things that people come 
up with to occupy their mind during the 

810
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,053
day are things that we've come up with 
that we've discovered or be or created 

811
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,333
and be decided that there are 
significant tax laws or jobs or social 

812
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:15,820
status for breeding.
I think.

813
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,513
I think it gets back to this point.
I think the whole thing is an edifice 

814
00:40:20,491 --> 00:40:23,190
built to distract ourselves from our 
mortality.

815
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,520
I think that's what civilization is.

816
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,493
It certainly could be or it could be a 
mechanism for us to continue to create 

817
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:31,834
technology and innovate because the best
way to do that is to not have a good 

818
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:37,550
perspective,
not have not realized that if,

819
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,260
if,
if we,

820
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,093
if our perspective is really good and we
realized that we're these temporary 

821
00:40:41,411 --> 00:40:45,880
beings who just love each other and 
spend as much time together in comradery

822
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:48,460
and friendship as possible.
We're not going to get shit done.

823
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,850
We're all going to look at all the 
phones we have now and then go.

824
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:52,684
We're good.
We just keep using these phones and 

825
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:55,114
everyone's fine.
We look at our tvs and that is a very 

826
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:58,210
big TV.
We're good.

827
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,390
My computer is super fast.
We're good.

828
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,243
My Internet seems fine.
Let's just leave all this stuff alone 

829
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,650
and hang out.
Right?

830
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,490
That's right.

831
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,610
You need the discontent to create the 
technology.

832
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:10,444
So the question is whose but,
but whose interest is all of in that 

833
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,630
because it's not in ours.
Yeah,

834
00:41:16,631 --> 00:41:18,760
exactly.
It's the super organism.

835
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,980
Marshall Mcluhan,
quote,

836
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,143
Marshall Mcluhan's sex organs,
and the machine was my favorite quote 

837
00:41:24,391 --> 00:41:26,820
ever.
And I think that one of the things we've

838
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:27,654
done by lighting everything up also is 
we've gotten rid of the psychedelic 

839
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:34,220
vision that is space.
You no longer

840
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,440
see space,
uh,

841
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,283
you have to,
if you go on a trip to the desert and 

842
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,430
you go out to the desert in the high 
desert and you look up at night,

843
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,690
you're like,
wow,

844
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,100
you get that majestic vision of the 
cosmos.

845
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,110
We don't get it in la anymore.
It's gone.

846
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,090
It's gone.
We smoked it out.

847
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,910
We smoked it out with streetlights.
When you got tomatoes,

848
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:55,550
that'll look good for a long time but 
haven't been fucking flavor.

849
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,640
Yeah.
And roses that don't smell like roses,

850
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,474
they don't what they smelled like 
nothing because because they've got to 

851
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:06,560
breathe that they will last much longer 
looking good.

852
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,260
But it doesn't have the smell,
but just spray perfume on them,

853
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:10,340
Bro.
That's what they do.

854
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,770
Seriously.
Seriously.

855
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:14,930
That's what they spray rose perfume on 
roses.

856
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,980
I went to dinner once.
This French chick made me dinner.

857
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,050
This beautiful,
wonderful French woman.

858
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,913
And uh,
but I didn't like anything she liked so 

859
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:27,300
it was a difficult relationship,
you know,

860
00:42:27,301 --> 00:42:28,134
like she liked sailing,
she had this little sailboat and for me 

861
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:34,390
sailing is like skin cancer,
guaranteed skin cancer.

862
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,500
Like I'm going to be a pale because I'm 
super pale.

863
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:37,910
I'm out on the water,
no shade,

864
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:39,500
you know,
we're waiting for wind,

865
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:40,550
I'm dead,
I'm dead.

866
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:43,700
Anyway.
So she made this dinner for me one night

867
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,020
and I went to her place and everything 
was beautiful and it was all set up with

868
00:42:48,021 --> 00:42:49,140
candles and,
you know,

869
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,480
nice silver.
And uh,

870
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:55,850
it was escar go fucking eat escargot go 
man.

871
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:57,890
I'm American.
I don't eat snails,

872
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,190
but I was going to go through it just 
because she went to all this trouble.

873
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,860
Twenty eight,
29 something.

874
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,413
And uh,
so she has this big pot of escargo 

875
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,980
shells in the sauce tomato sauce and she
puts it on her.

876
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,410
And so I pick up the first one and suck 
up the sauce and there's no snap and I'm

877
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:16,370
like,
lucked out.

878
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,500
And uh,
then it picked up the next one.

879
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:20,320
Same thing again,
no snail.

880
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:25,100
And I'm looking at her across the table 
and she's getting this weird look on her

881
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:27,680
face.
There were no snails.

882
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,850
She'd bought the shells.
They sell the snail separately.

883
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,320
You have to put the snails back in the 
shells.

884
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,400
What?
I don't know.

885
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:38,234
Something about you spraying perfume on 
roses with no smell reminded me of that 

886
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:46,260
is so ridiculous.
So she made a big pot of snail shell,

887
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,100
snail shell suit tomatoes.
Snail's shell suit.

888
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,780
That's hard to say.
Snail shell suit.

889
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,230
Snail shells.
Yeah.

890
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,700
My mouth doesn't want to say that.
Snare snail shell suit.

891
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,440
Snail Shell.
Snail snail.

892
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:03,643
You're right.
It is bizarre that they would separate 

893
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:06,824
them.
Why would you take the snails out and 

894
00:44:07,941 --> 00:44:10,280
make people put them back in maybe to 
clean them?

895
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:11,700
Shipping.
Yeah.

896
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,613
Maybe a cleanliness issue.
But then you would know that they 

897
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:15,644
weren't fresh.
Like the whole idea is that you want to 

898
00:44:17,211 --> 00:44:19,500
catch them and they do something to 
them.

899
00:44:19,501 --> 00:44:20,720
No,
that's something that,

900
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:21,550
uh,
I was.

901
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,760
There's a guy online who is a wild game 
cook,

902
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:29,580
a famous wild game cook.
And he's been on Steve Rinella,

903
00:44:29,581 --> 00:44:32,350
his television show.
And one of the things he does is

904
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,450
he takes wild foods like mushrooms and 
stuff,

905
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:40,350
and it incorporates than likely if he,
if he eats like a deer,

906
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,373
he cooks at deer meal,
he'll use like a lot of the local 

907
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,480
ingredients like local plants and local 
mushrooms and things like that.

908
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:49,763
And uh,
he did that with some snails and he had 

909
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:52,794
to purge them.
So I guess you do something where you 

910
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,124
take them and you like leave them in 
water for a long period of time or 

911
00:44:59,011 --> 00:44:59,844
something.
Like let them dedicate and let them 

912
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:03,540
pass.
I think that that might be.

913
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,760
That makes sense.
Yeah.

914
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:10,220
You don't want each snail pissed now.
That's what you eat lobster,

915
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:11,230
right?
That.

916
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:16,230
Hold down the last line we talked about 
fecal transplant.

917
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,870
We have definitely.
I haven't stopped talking about it.

918
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:26,943
It's pretty bizarre.
The idea that microbes from another 

919
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:31,560
person's poop can actually help your 
body.

920
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,180
Yeah.
That's pretty wild.

921
00:45:33,181 --> 00:45:34,014
High being born vaginally.
You get your mother's microbiome all 

922
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:41,820
over your skin and in your mouth and 
stuff from her genital secretions.

923
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,640
So when kids are born csection,
they don't get that.

924
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,770
They're much more likely to have asthma 
and all this stuff because they.

925
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,130
So what you got to do,
even if you have a c section,

926
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:52,830
is smear pussy juice all over the kid's 
face.

927
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:55,290
Literally.
I don't think you should say that.

928
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:00,090
We should probably edit that out.
That's just what the doctor ordered.

929
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:00,953
There are new rules,
this society and your pussy juice 

930
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,463
anymore.

931
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,160
That'll get you fired.
I think it was Yale,

932
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:13,270
but over that.
Sorry.

933
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,340
We were talking about before the podcast
started about the Social Justice Warrior

934
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:22,020
placemats that Harvard had given to 
children to take home with them.

935
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:24,510
And I say children because if your 
parents are paying for your education,

936
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,850
your fucking child,
you're still a child.

937
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,240
I don't care what.
I don't care what.

938
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,780
I don't care if you're 18,
I don't care if you could vote.

939
00:46:29,781 --> 00:46:32,160
I don't care if he can go to war.
They,

940
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:32,994
uh,
they sent these placemats home with 

941
00:46:34,321 --> 00:46:35,154
these kids explaining how to talk to 
your parents if controversial issues 

942
00:46:39,301 --> 00:46:40,134
come up.
Like if your parents exhibit xenophobia 

943
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:47,270
or sexism transphobia.
And so they literally are there.

944
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,970
They're giving them these placemats.
Yeah.

945
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:51,893
Yeah.
We'll pull it up.

946
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,060
The Harvard just apologize for it today 
for the place mat.

947
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:56,243
Well,
some intelligent people probably got 

948
00:46:57,691 --> 00:46:58,524
ahold of him.

949
00:46:58,590 --> 00:46:59,423
What the fuck are you doing?
You're teaching people how to be only 

950
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:04,164
liberal progressive thinkers like think 
only the way you guys want them to 

951
00:47:07,471 --> 00:47:08,304
think.
Can they?

952
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:09,263
Are they allowed to have a nuanced 
opinion on subjects that are 

953
00:47:11,491 --> 00:47:12,324
controversial?
Like there's some things you're not 

954
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:16,470
allowed to have a nuanced opinion about.
You're not even allowed to debate it,

955
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:17,890
and that was what happened at.
Yeah,

956
00:47:17,891 --> 00:47:20,160
when they were talking about offensive 
Halloween costumes.

957
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:25,050
Here it is the Yale student active tips 
for talking to family members.

958
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,360
Oh my God.
This is hilarious.

959
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:30,010
Listen mindfully before a formula and

960
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:35,590
thoughtful response.
When people express strong opinions,

961
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:36,783
affirm,
clarify the difference between the good 

962
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:40,270
intentions and the impact.
Speak.

963
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,193
Speak from a place of mutual interest,
sharing personal experiences and 

964
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:46,300
emotions.
Oh my God.

965
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,820
And they talk about black murders in the
streets.

966
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,620
Why don't they just listened to the 
officer if they,

967
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,030
if they just had obeyed the law,
this wouldn't have happened.

968
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,430
Response.
Let me come on.

969
00:47:57,431 --> 00:47:58,570
Look at this,
this hilarious.

970
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:59,703
Do you think,
do you think the response would be the 

971
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:03,430
same if it was a white person being 
pulled over,

972
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,773
like look at what they're doing here.
This is teaching people how to talk to 

973
00:48:09,131 --> 00:48:13,240
their parents about controversial social
issues like Islamophobia.

974
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,053
Oh my God.
What is this that we shouldn't let 

975
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:20,890
anyone in the US from Syria.
We can't guarantee that terrorists won't

976
00:48:20,891 --> 00:48:21,724
infiltrate their.
This is the worst fucking Christmas 

977
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:24,184
dinner ever.

978
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,690
Horrible.
This is not the Christmas dinner.

979
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:29,524
There's a fucking o'reilly factor.
US has been accepting refugees from the 

980
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:35,980
war torn areas around the world for 
decades.

981
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:36,814
Remember the wars in Central America?
They were extremely violent in the US 

982
00:48:39,371 --> 00:48:41,410
accepted refugees.
All right.

983
00:48:41,411 --> 00:48:42,244
Whatever.
It's just boring Yale student activism 

984
00:48:44,501 --> 00:48:46,930
one.
Why are the black students complaining?

985
00:48:46,931 --> 00:48:50,080
Shouldn't they be happy to be in college
response?

986
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,830
When I hear students expressing their 
experiences of racism on campus,

987
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,140
I don't hear complaining.
Instead,

988
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:01,180
I hear young people uplifting is 
situation that I may not.

989
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,150
You know what my dad's doing it at this 
point when I'm reading this,

990
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:05,950
my dad will start making ozark start 
going.

991
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,350
By the way of lifting is not a fucking 
verb.

992
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:18,520
Yeah.
Know.

993
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,860
Could somebody tell her fancy boys sign?
You need to,

994
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,910
but there's a harvard placemat.
It's about the ell student,

995
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,190
but look,
listen,

996
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:33,790
if non black students got the privilege,
get the privilege of a safe environment,

997
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:37,120
I believe that same privilege should be 
given to all students.

998
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,000
Like you just said nothing.
That is a nonsense statement.

999
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,520
You don't hear them complaining when 
they're complaining.

1000
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,420
Well,
that's bizarre.

1001
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,400
If people are complaining,
they're definitely complaining.

1002
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:46,930
Very good.
Exactly.

1003
00:49:46,931 --> 00:49:48,640
There's nothing negative about 
complaining.

1004
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,650
They might have a very good point.
If you don't hear complaining,

1005
00:49:50,651 --> 00:49:53,470
then you're not paying attention.
Black murder section.

1006
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:55,900
Now that is.
That seems pretty logical.

1007
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:58,720
The response read it.
Do you think their response would be the

1008
00:49:58,721 --> 00:49:59,554
same if there was a white person being 
pulled over in many incidents that 

1009
00:50:02,891 --> 00:50:05,830
result in the death of a black body in 
the street?

1010
00:50:05,831 --> 00:50:06,664
These victims are not breaking the law 
and are unarmed with Tamir seems right 

1011
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:11,674
on.
He was a 12 year old boy playing in the 

1012
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:14,860
park.
When the officers pulled up,

1013
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:15,694
they gave no verbal commands and shot 
within two seconds of arriving at the 

1014
00:50:19,241 --> 00:50:21,280
scene.
He was not breaking any laws.

1015
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,950
You know this.
It's just because I just watched someone

1016
00:50:23,951 --> 00:50:27,260
made a youtube montage of cops shooting 
people.

1017
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,130
It's insane it

1018
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,020
you've seen that.
Yeah.

1019
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:30,300
It's crazy.
And,

1020
00:50:30,301 --> 00:50:31,134
and I was thinking my Christ man,
if I was black and got pulled over by a 

1021
00:50:33,411 --> 00:50:35,220
cop,
I'd be shitting myself.

1022
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,220
Oh yeah.
Because they just shoot.

1023
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,173
Not only that,
you're dealing with someone who is 

1024
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:44,120
encountering bad people all day.
Most of the people that cops and counter

1025
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:44,954
all day or breaking the law,
most of the people that are either 

1026
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:47,534
pulling them,
pulling them over for going too fast or 

1027
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:50,264
they're doing something stupid or 
they're trying to steal something and 

1028
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:53,054
they're trying to rob somebody or 
they're showing up at a scene after 

1029
00:50:55,101 --> 00:50:56,780
someone's done something fucked up.
Yeah.

1030
00:50:56,781 --> 00:50:57,614
So just think about the stress that a 
normal person's under and multiply that 

1031
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,320
times 100.
You get paid like 40 grand a year.

1032
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:04,520
People want to shoot out.
Yeah.

1033
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:07,880
You weren't a goddamn bulletproof vest 
and you're going to someone,

1034
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:12,290
someone's car and it's a young black guy
and he doesn't use his rap.

1035
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:14,030
Music is loud.
He's not even turning it down.

1036
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,320
You're like,
God damn it is today.

1037
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:18,050
The day I get shot and killed,
or I say the day I die

1038
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,530
and let's not forget that a lot of these
dudes are coming back from wars.

1039
00:51:21,531 --> 00:51:22,364
So a lot of them have ptsd and they were
trained where they were an occupying 

1040
00:51:25,201 --> 00:51:26,630
force.
So they,

1041
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:29,850
they take that training and they apply 
it to joining the police force.

1042
00:51:29,851 --> 00:51:33,720
And the population is the enemy.
Everyone is a potential,

1043
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,040
uh,
you know,

1044
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,240
it's a suicide vest.

1045
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:38,660
I got into a conversation with my uber 
driver,

1046
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:39,763
this black dude,
and he was like a talking about getting 

1047
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:44,120
pulled over recently.
And I told him,

1048
00:51:44,121 --> 00:51:45,590
man,
I haven't been pulled over and like,

1049
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,510
I don't know,
nine years.

1050
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,060
And he's like,

1051
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:53,340
what?
I'm white lol.

1052
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,440
He gets pulled over all the time,
you know?

1053
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:00,090
And so like,
that's fucked up man.

1054
00:52:00,091 --> 00:52:04,580
Like that's like that,
that to live in that kind of world where

1055
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,713
you realize that you're just,
you just have to accept getting pulled 

1056
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:08,294
over and you have to accept the fact 
that there is some chance if you make 

1057
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:12,554
the wrong move or if the cops snaps 
because of for whatever reason you're 

1058
00:52:16,521 --> 00:52:18,170
dead.
That happens all the time.

1059
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,040
There was that one where the cops pulled
a guy over and there's a video of him,

1060
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,130
the completely different interaction.
The cop described,

1061
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:26,203
the guy pulls his gun out.
You could just shoots the guy in this 

1062
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:30,890
fucking car.
No one's in trouble knowing scared.

1063
00:52:30,891 --> 00:52:33,410
No one's in danger.
Terrible people

1064
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,870
just shouldn't be cops.
There's definitely people that shouldn't

1065
00:52:36,871 --> 00:52:38,820
be cops.
I think most people.

1066
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:39,654
How about that and what about these 
cases where they like swat the right 

1067
00:52:42,431 --> 00:52:45,080
into someone's house in the middle of 
the night and shoot them in bed and then

1068
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:45,630
it's like,
oh,

1069
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,670
wrong house.
Or they shoot a dog.

1070
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:49,950
They love shooting the dogs.
Yeah,

1071
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:52,080
and taking the property.
That's the other thing.

1072
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:53,550
This country,
they're motivated.

1073
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:54,880
Motivated,
motivated,

1074
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,880
motivated,
motivated.

1075
00:52:56,881 --> 00:52:57,714
Yeah.
There's a word they're incentivized as 

1076
00:52:59,111 --> 00:53:02,160
far as two to get into shit,
you know,

1077
00:53:02,161 --> 00:53:03,300
to get,
get into trouble,

1078
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:06,210
find trouble because they get the house,
they get the car and there's,

1079
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,053
you know,
in 2015 cops took more property than 

1080
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:11,300
burglars did.
Yeah,

1081
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,523
I saw that.
Wait a minute and that goes right into 

1082
00:53:19,111 --> 00:53:19,944
the local police department's budget and
he doesn't even go to Washington and 

1083
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,110
they bought Margarita machines and the 
North Carolina to

1084
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,270
see that.
I didn't see that.

1085
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:31,170
They will pull them over and they just 
take it and say,

1086
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,030
well,
you have to figure out a way to prove to

1087
00:53:33,031 --> 00:53:33,864
us that this money was made illegal.
The asset forfeiture surpass burglaries 

1088
00:53:36,991 --> 00:53:39,900
for the first time ever.
That's crazy important point.

1089
00:53:39,901 --> 00:53:42,480
You don't even have to be charged with 
the crime.

1090
00:53:42,481 --> 00:53:43,314
They can just say,
what are you doing walking around with 

1091
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:47,280
10 grand in cash and you have to.
You've got to prove.

1092
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,323
And also think about how much of this is
related to drugs and then so when you 

1093
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:52,584
realize the asset forfeiture is actually
happening for something that shouldn't 

1094
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:58,050
be illegal anyway.
Like do you watch,

1095
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,990
have you watched,
it's called drunk tank.

1096
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:03,610
Have you seen this show where it's like,
I dunno,

1097
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:07,020
it shows it's a show where after someone
gets pulled over for a Dui,

1098
00:54:07,021 --> 00:54:09,720
they get thrown in the drunk tank and 
man,

1099
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:10,554
there's to me,
nothing more viral than seeing a cop 

1100
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:14,663
smugly like searching a person and 
pulling marijuana out of his pocket and 

1101
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:20,191
being like,
well,

1102
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:22,710
well,
well what do we have here?

1103
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,530
Marrow wanna.
Look at this.

1104
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,633
That's going to be something that 
history is going to judge in the most 

1105
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:31,134
intense way.
Every single cop that's been on a 

1106
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:37,530
reality show,
smugly taking someone's weed for them,

1107
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,220
putting handcuffs on them because they 
had weed for eternity,

1108
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,030
they're going to be looked back on in a 
really fucking awful way.

1109
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:45,983
They're going to want to scrub the 
Internet from some of that footage 

1110
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:51,300
because they're enforcing a law that.
I mean,

1111
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:52,134
we all preaching the choir here,
but there's something so foul about it 

1112
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:57,030
that smugness,
you know,

1113
00:54:57,031 --> 00:54:59,970
it's so disgusting for nothing,
for nothing,

1114
00:54:59,971 --> 00:55:01,770
for literally nothing.
Literally nothing.

1115
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,330
No.
Well,

1116
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:05,970
not less than nothing.
Something they enjoy.

1117
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,180
It's not just for nothing,
it's,

1118
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,093
it's more we're

1119
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:13,120
discussing that because it's positive,
it's beneficial,

1120
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:16,270
it enhances their life,
it makes food taste better.

1121
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:17,230
Right.
Well,

1122
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:20,370
that gets us back to the seeing God in a
mushroom,

1123
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,213
right?
Yeah.

1124
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:22,623
Every culture that's ever had access to 
hallucinogens have seen them as the 

1125
00:55:25,871 --> 00:55:27,900
greatest gift of the gods.
Right?

1126
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,833
The most sacred,
the most beautiful gifts they've been 

1127
00:55:30,281 --> 00:55:32,950
given in our country,
in the United States.

1128
00:55:32,951 --> 00:55:35,290
You go to prison for longer,
under minimum.

1129
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:39,060
Mandatory for having a LSD.
LSD.

1130
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:39,890
Yeah.
Right.

1131
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,670
LSD.
Then for second degree murder.

1132
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:43,883
Think about that.
So it's not only wasteful and weird and 

1133
00:55:47,471 --> 00:55:50,860
awkward.
Now it's the and and to me that,

1134
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,833
you know,
ties into my argument that we live in a 

1135
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:57,810
culture that it sets out to deny 
mystery.

1136
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:58,683
This is where I differ from you.
I don't know the culture sets out to 

1137
00:56:01,841 --> 00:56:02,674
deny it or if all these things are kind 
of in place and they all benefit each 

1138
00:56:05,921 --> 00:56:10,840
other and the overall result is that the
culture denies it's reality.

1139
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:13,900
I don't necessarily think there's any 
design involved.

1140
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:14,920
I know,
well,

1141
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:17,290
see this is it designed versus 
evolution.

1142
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,124
I agree with you,
I think it's a system that replicates 

1143
00:56:19,871 --> 00:56:23,980
itself and supports itself and spins out
sub that support

1144
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,810
the central mechanism.
Yeah.

1145
00:56:25,811 --> 00:56:26,644
I don't.
I don't think Henry Kissinger's behind 

1146
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:29,620
it know I.
I know you don't,

1147
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,513
but I mean,
I don't think there's anyone that 

1148
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:32,733
doesn't want us.
Anyone that doesn't want us to be aware 

1149
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,173
of art.
I just don't think anybody's attention 

1150
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,273
entire advertising industry doesn't want
us to know the reality of what they're 

1151
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:43,690
selling.
They're not even.

1152
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,770
Oh,
that's different.

1153
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:45,641
Yeah.
Okay.

1154
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:46,930
That's.
They're trying.

1155
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,530
I mean there's a whole,
you know,

1156
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,790
Edward Bernays,
right?

1157
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,000
The Great.
Yeah.

1158
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:51,963
The Guy who founded advertising 
essentially and also worked for the CIA 

1159
00:56:54,671 --> 00:56:58,360
also came up with the word defending 
freedom abroad,

1160
00:56:58,361 --> 00:57:01,210
justification for American military 
adventures.

1161
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,220
I mean he was central and he very 
clearly said like,

1162
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,253
we need to create reality for people 
because if they are allowed to create 

1163
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:11,140
their own reality,
they won't buy stuff.

1164
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:12,550
They won't do what we need them to do.

1165
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,530
They won't vote for who we need them to 
vote for.

1166
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:19,270
So there's an elite that has to create 
reality for the masses and it's logical.

1167
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:20,450
If you like,
if we will,

1168
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,303
if we got assigned to and we are 
assholes and we got assigned to some 

1169
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:28,600
massive group of people that we needed 
to control and we needed to,

1170
00:57:28,601 --> 00:57:30,970
like we needed them to think that we 
were in charge.

1171
00:57:30,971 --> 00:57:31,804
That was the first thing.
You would have certain rules that you 

1172
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:34,624
had that they had to abide by and the 
first rule would be don't let them take 

1173
00:57:38,141 --> 00:57:40,870
psychedelics man,
because if they start fucking tripping,

1174
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:41,913
they're going to realize we're just 
three dudes just like listen to us 

1175
00:57:46,181 --> 00:57:47,014
anymore.
Which is why I think there is a five 

1176
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:53,581
year mandatory minimum when it comes to 
lsd because when you take Lsd,

1177
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,890
the entire thing seems absolutely 
absurd.

1178
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:57,723
From money to the government to jobs at 
all seems like a ridiculous thing that 

1179
00:58:02,951 --> 00:58:04,660
everyone else seems to have accepted as 
like,

1180
00:58:04,661 --> 00:58:05,890
yeah,
this is just how you do shit.

1181
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,850
Right?
But question,

1182
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,713
the people that are enforcing the laws 
are not the people that created those 

1183
00:58:10,301 --> 00:58:11,134
laws and the people that are enforcing 
the laws most certainly have not 

1184
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:15,724
experienced these things.
That's why we need to get comps 

1185
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:19,300
tripping.
Yeah,

1186
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,580
but you're right,
I agree.

1187
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:22,923
I think that there's,
there's a certain momentum that these 

1188
00:58:26,051 --> 00:58:26,884
laws and that this propaganda has sort 
of set in motion that's going to be 

1189
00:58:29,951 --> 00:58:33,430
really hard to slow down and stop and 
we're starting to do that with pot.

1190
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,133
The availability and the relaxation.
The way people view pot in 2015 is way 

1191
00:58:40,541 --> 00:58:45,340
different than 2005 or two.
I mean there's,

1192
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,293
there's a approved research going on,
there's a fantastic clinical 

1193
00:58:49,271 --> 00:58:50,800
application,
you know,

1194
00:58:50,801 --> 00:58:53,980
and the old guard has to die.
Well yeah,

1195
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:55,770
it works.
You know,

1196
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:56,603
people that started those laws,
the fucking Joe Friday's dragnet guys 

1197
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:01,643
like those guys are dead.
So like the people that like started 

1198
00:59:04,871 --> 00:59:09,700
this whole sweeping psychedelic 
legislation act of 1970,

1199
00:59:09,701 --> 00:59:11,320
I believe it was when they made 
everything scheduled.

1200
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:12,453
Yeah.
Were just trying to batten down the 

1201
00:59:13,961 --> 00:59:15,790
hatches.
We have to stop these fucking hippies.

1202
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,490
Like everything was crazy.
The response to Vietnam War,

1203
00:59:18,491 --> 00:59:19,520
but he wanted to get out.
It was,

1204
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,680
it was the culture

1205
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:22,933
explosion that was going on and they 
were trying to throw a wet blankets on 

1206
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:26,990
it.
We're trying to figure out how to do it,

1207
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,180
but those people that did that,
they're all dead.

1208
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:33,620
So these new sort of dea people in drug 
enforcement officers,

1209
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:34,863
they're there.
They're operating under this assumption 

1210
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:38,474
that what they're doing is in some way 
good because it's been in place for a 

1211
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:45,290
long time and this is just how it is.
And look,

1212
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:47,210
there's a reason why heroin is illegal,
son.

1213
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:49,130
There's a reason why cocaine's illegal 
son,

1214
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,990
what?
Marijuana is going to rot your brain.

1215
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,720
So you do marijuana.
Like why are,

1216
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,790
why are mushrooms illegal?
If you've done mushrooms,

1217
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,010
if you've done mushrooms and you think 
they're illegals,

1218
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,020
something went wrong,
something went wrong.

1219
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:04,290
Either you tried to fight it and the 
trip took you sideways or you know,

1220
01:00:04,291 --> 01:00:07,040
you didn't get enough of it or you did 
it with assholes.

1221
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:09,080
If you were to have the,
um,

1222
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:11,520
there's a thing you probably net,
there's a name for it.

1223
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:15,630
When somebody gets invested into a 
religion or a cult,

1224
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:16,733
you get no called and after you've 
invested yourself for a certain amount 

1225
01:00:19,681 --> 01:00:22,650
of time,
when you get really like sucked into the

1226
01:00:22,651 --> 01:00:23,660
cult,
uh,

1227
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,830
the,
just the fact that you've been in it for

1228
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:26,730
four,
five,

1229
01:00:26,731 --> 01:00:27,564
10,
15 years is enough to keep you in even 

1230
01:00:29,641 --> 01:00:32,880
though you know it's complete bullshit 
and see you stay in it only because like

1231
01:00:32,881 --> 01:00:34,590
you've,
you've invested too much energy.

1232
01:00:34,591 --> 01:00:37,230
Like when they predict the apocalypse 
and then it doesn't happen,

1233
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,610
and those people just like,
well,

1234
01:00:38,611 --> 01:00:43,350
that doesn't shake their ego is 
completely committed to it.

1235
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:44,303
Imagine if like your entire life you had
been enforcing legislation that was 

1236
01:00:48,781 --> 01:00:52,290
completely absurd,
that wasn't based on anything,

1237
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:55,950
that in reality,
that in fact for your entire life,

1238
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:56,883
you are a enforcing legislation that was
in some way dampening or pushing your 

1239
01:01:01,921 --> 01:01:02,754
society back,
pushing back the evolution of your 

1240
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:09,240
culture and you have to come to terms 
with the fact that you did that.

1241
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:10,253
You are an agent of the state and you 
enforced laws that shouldn't have been 

1242
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:15,540
there at all.
Man,

1243
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:16,403
that's a fucking tough pill to swallow.
The fact that you may have killed some 

1244
01:01:19,351 --> 01:01:20,184
people use,
there's people out there who have put 

1245
01:01:22,471 --> 01:01:25,950
bullets in,
in people just for growing marijuana,

1246
01:01:25,951 --> 01:01:29,760
something out of the ground or for being
an Afghany adolescent,

1247
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:30,811
you know,
I mean,

1248
01:01:30,811 --> 01:01:33,510
think about all the soldier.
That's what the PTSD is all about,

1249
01:01:33,511 --> 01:01:34,860
right?
They're coming back and they're like,

1250
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,620
what the f?
I interviewed three vets on my show.

1251
01:01:37,621 --> 01:01:41,970
I did sort of a series of interviews,
tangentially speaking,

1252
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,850
available on itunes.
Thank you.

1253
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:47,130
Uh,
and you know,

1254
01:01:47,131 --> 01:01:48,750
that's some of the stuff that comes up,
you know,

1255
01:01:48,751 --> 01:01:52,800
it's like fucking shoot people because 
you're there and that's what you do.

1256
01:01:52,801 --> 01:01:54,310
And they moved and they had,
you know,

1257
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,120
whatever.
It's got to come to terms with it,

1258
01:01:57,121 --> 01:01:58,740
you know,
they just have to come to terms with it,

1259
01:01:58,741 --> 01:01:59,574
but you have to come to terms with it 
because it's cowardly to continue to 

1260
01:02:01,861 --> 01:02:06,360
fucking enforce a goddamn thing.
Even though you know that it's no longer

1261
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:08,460
a relevant.
There's no need to do it.

1262
01:02:08,461 --> 01:02:09,294
There never was a need to do it.
You just have to take the bitter pill 

1263
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:14,640
and go through a few fucking days of 
feeling guilty,

1264
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:16,350
you know,
and understand that,

1265
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:20,160
that what you did was wrong.
It's a real easy thing

1266
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,023
to say,
but the problem is until the laws get 

1267
01:02:22,621 --> 01:02:23,454
changed,
it's not going to seem real to people 

1268
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:26,243
that are still caught up in the haze of 
culture because culture has kind of a 

1269
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:34,260
haze like you get.
You get sucked into it and you're in it,

1270
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:35,094
and that's why people do different 
things in different places and it seems 

1271
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:37,794
normal to them.
And then we see it though what they eat 

1272
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:40,550
with sticks,
right?

1273
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:41,880
What are they?
Fucking crazy,

1274
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:42,201
right?
Well,

1275
01:02:42,201 --> 01:02:46,230
they know about spoons.
It's like culture becomes the norm.

1276
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:47,064
It becomes what you accept and right now
our culture accepts the fact that you 

1277
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:53,310
get locked up for drugs and you don't 
want your kids to be a druggie.

1278
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,090
You don't want your kid to be a loser if
you,

1279
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:57,090
because they become potheads and become 
lazy.

1280
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,043
We have these thoughts that were really 
all the seeds were started in the 19 

1281
01:03:02,101 --> 01:03:03,910
thirties with all those crazy reefer 
madness.

1282
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:04,853
It just means it's the same stuff.
It just has gotten less and less 

1283
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:09,510
ridiculous,
but no one,

1284
01:03:09,511 --> 01:03:12,460
like even to this day,
if you talk about getting high,

1285
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:13,503
talking about smoking pot,
the vast majority of people look at it 

1286
01:03:16,261 --> 01:03:18,780
the same way as if you say,
I got fucked up.

1287
01:03:18,781 --> 01:03:21,540
I,
we went and drank and I got hammered.

1288
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:22,374
I was so blasted.
But there's a very big difference in 

1289
01:03:24,391 --> 01:03:25,224
what it's doing to your body.
Like one of them is closing off 

1290
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:28,344
awareness.
One of them is opening up awareness and 

1291
01:03:29,641 --> 01:03:32,700
we're putting them in the same category 
and this is not a knock on alcoholic.

1292
01:03:32,701 --> 01:03:34,290
I'm a fan of alcohol.
Enjoy it,

1293
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,930
but it's a completely different 
experience.

1294
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:40,320
But when you explain it to people,
they'll look at you the same way.

1295
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,730
Ah,
you guys got stoned,

1296
01:03:41,731 --> 01:03:43,620
Huh?
You fucking crazy kids,

1297
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:44,823
you know.
Meanwhile you got stoned and might have 

1298
01:03:45,761 --> 01:03:48,900
realized exactly what was wrong in your 
relationship and you know,

1299
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:49,734
and,
and tried to fix your life and like 

1300
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,250
wrote something down.
It's going to be like the new chart,

1301
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,130
the new path of your destiny.
Like more,

1302
01:03:56,131 --> 01:03:58,420
you got drunk and shit.
And your neighbors along because you try

1303
01:03:58,421 --> 01:03:59,720
to be cute,
you know,

1304
01:03:59,721 --> 01:04:02,940
and this cat and it is cute.
Put It on youtube

1305
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:06,120
that we're talking.
Is that cat fucking line a dig at me,

1306
01:04:06,121 --> 01:04:06,931
man.
No Man,

1307
01:04:06,931 --> 01:04:10,380
no man promised who weren't going to 
talk about that.

1308
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,360
That,
that thing you're talking about,

1309
01:04:12,361 --> 01:04:13,680
man.
That thing where you're like,

1310
01:04:13,681 --> 01:04:14,190
well,
well,

1311
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:15,023
well guess you're high right now.
That's deep North Korean level 

1312
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:19,973
conditioning.
That's what it's no different than 

1313
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:23,820
people in North Korea praying the dear 
leader.

1314
01:04:23,821 --> 01:04:25,350
It's when you.
You have been.

1315
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,420
If you,
depending on how old you are,

1316
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,690
you have been a in a war.
The war on drugs.

1317
01:04:30,691 --> 01:04:33,420
It's a real war.
It's a war where people have been killed

1318
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:36,810
and imprisoned and as part of all wars 
propaganda,

1319
01:04:36,811 --> 01:04:38,820
you have to have private money and 
money,

1320
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:39,773
but you have been conditioned by some 
very intense brainwashing that was 

1321
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:48,000
created by the CIA to try to control 
your mind.

1322
01:04:48,001 --> 01:04:50,580
And so you have been infected with 
propaganda.

1323
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:52,500
If you think that drugs should be 
illegal,

1324
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:57,140
you are a victim of the drug war and 
another know another fucking casualty of

1325
01:04:57,141 --> 01:04:57,974
the drug war.

1326
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:58,943
Truth man,
I was thinking like how much I lied to 

1327
01:05:02,161 --> 01:05:06,090
my mom.
I was in high school taking Lsd,

1328
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:09,570
having these powerful life,
changing experiences,

1329
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,673
beautiful experiences where I was 
realizing so much about society and 

1330
01:05:14,311 --> 01:05:15,144
myself and a lot of Shit I didn't 
understand and I would have loved to 

1331
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:19,114
have talked to my mom about it,
but I couldn't talk to my mom about it 

1332
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:24,310
because if my mom found out I was doing 
fucking Lsd,

1333
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,050
she would freak out and parents,
they go through their kid's drawers.

1334
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,033
They become agents of the state.
They're digging through their kid's 

1335
01:05:32,681 --> 01:05:33,514
drawers to try to find a substance that 
has been on the planet for a very long 

1336
01:05:37,451 --> 01:05:38,284
time.
Marijuana or a substance like lsd that 

1337
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:40,894
is profoundly beneficial to a person who
takes it and the right way and they've 

1338
01:05:45,971 --> 01:05:50,530
become agents of the state and they're.
They're forcing this in their house,

1339
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:51,423
in the home,
which should be a place of absolute 

1340
01:05:53,051 --> 01:05:56,920
truth and trust and acceptance and 
growth.

1341
01:05:57,490 --> 01:06:00,820
It's been transformed into this kind of 
Weird Gulag.

1342
01:06:00,821 --> 01:06:01,654
It's been turned into this bizarre 
prison place where the parents somehow 

1343
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:11,671
have got to enforce these absolutely 
arbitrary laws and that I can't,

1344
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:14,194
I don't think that anyone is ever going 
to be able to calculate how much damage 

1345
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:17,914
that is done to society that we have 
placed our teens into a position where 

1346
01:06:21,761 --> 01:06:22,594
they have to fucking lie to their 
parents about having the most profound 

1347
01:06:25,331 --> 01:06:26,164
experience accessible via chemicals.
But there's a lot of people that think 

1348
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:32,620
that you shouldn't fuck with any 
entheogens,

1349
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:36,190
any psychedelics while you're a,
you have a young developing mind.

1350
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,650
Well,
I'm not one of them when I can't,

1351
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:41,823
I can't be.
I didn't do all that all through high 

1352
01:06:43,211 --> 01:06:45,760
school and I absolutely am so grateful 
to that.

1353
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:46,803
I'm so grateful for the information 
stream because I didn't have the 

1354
01:06:49,181 --> 01:06:50,610
Internet man and like,
uh,

1355
01:06:50,611 --> 01:06:52,440
you know,
my encounter with a,

1356
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,500
what lsd was,
was through pure government propaganda.

1357
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,333
Like it was like finding books where it 
talks about Timothy leary is an insane 

1358
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:03,560
lunatic who lost his mind,
uh,

1359
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,513
that paints a picture of people who were
advocates of the psychedelic experience 

1360
01:07:09,531 --> 01:07:10,364
as being some kind of evil drug addled 
lunatics as opposed to being what they 

1361
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:15,514
really are,
which is rebels and heroes and a 

1362
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:22,300
completely insane a war that has 
destroyed countless lives.

1363
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,700
So I didn't,
I wasn't able to like go on the Internet

1364
01:07:24,701 --> 01:07:28,570
and look this shit up and find out that 
indeed this experience that I'm having,

1365
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:33,070
which appears to be beneficial is truly 
beneficial to a great many people.

1366
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,290
All I had was bullshit.
Like you're gonna,

1367
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:38,020
you know,
if you take five hits of acid,

1368
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,333
you're legally insane.
Or the old classic image show to take 

1369
01:07:45,071 --> 01:07:45,904
five.
So I'm covered if I do something good 

1370
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:51,980
clover,
same lost my mind.

1371
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:52,823
So I'm going to do,
I'm going to talk like from the 1940 

1372
01:07:54,011 --> 01:07:56,670
[inaudible] from now on the fly.
I'm in saying,

1373
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:01,990
what do you mean by this beneficial 
experience?

1374
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:04,150
Well,
it's sad,

1375
01:08:04,151 --> 01:08:04,961
you know,
it really is.

1376
01:08:04,961 --> 01:08:08,020
And it's what's really sad about is like
other wars,

1377
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:09,370
the casualties,
you know,

1378
01:08:09,371 --> 01:08:12,070
we build walls with names on them and 
other wars,

1379
01:08:12,071 --> 01:08:16,220
but in this particular war,
so many people who were just farmers

1380
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,053
and alchemists are laying in their 
graves and nobody realizes that these 

1381
01:08:21,471 --> 01:08:22,304
were heroes.
These were people who were in the face 

1382
01:08:24,591 --> 01:08:25,424
of insanity,
making the decision that regardless of 

1383
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:31,460
what the state was telling them to do,
that we're going to follow their hearts.

1384
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:32,533
And a lot of them went to jail for a lot
of them are in jail for political 

1385
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:36,560
prisoners.
That's the word.

1386
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,453
That's it.
This is very strange how hard it is for 

1387
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:40,094
us to break momentum of habit.
And that's part of what's going on is 

1388
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:46,940
there's a momentum of habit that looks 
at all these things as being negative.

1389
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:49,430
Well,
and there's a governmental system that's

1390
01:08:49,431 --> 01:08:52,590
supremely unresponsive to new ideas,
right?

1391
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,550
Because of the way Congress has set up.
But one of the things is changing that I

1392
01:08:55,551 --> 01:08:56,384
think is what's happening in Colorado 
with the tax revenue in Oregon in 

1393
01:08:59,570 --> 01:08:59,930
Oregon.

1394
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:03,350
But Colorado has a longer history of it 
right now.

1395
01:09:03,351 --> 01:09:04,184
They've made more money for the first 
time ever from marijuana and taxes than 

1396
01:09:06,861 --> 01:09:10,400
they do alcohol and crime goes down.
Crime went down,

1397
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:11,420
drunk driving,
went down,

1398
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:15,080
crime went down to record levels.
Drunk driving when real estate went up,

1399
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:16,423
13 percent.
Prescription overdoses down because 

1400
01:09:19,491 --> 01:09:20,324
people are using marijuana for pain 
control and tourism up hot girl moving 

1401
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:25,593
in part and time.
There's negatives to hippies freaks a 

1402
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:34,070
lot of lazy bitches moving into lot of 
hippies.

1403
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:34,904
Attracted like metal filings.
I slept and Terence Mckenna's bed the 

1404
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:38,070
other night.
Well,

1405
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:40,510
just jerk off.
I felt it.

1406
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:41,660
No,
no.

1407
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:43,970
Shut up.
No beautiful.

1408
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,353
Whereas Terence Mckenna is.
It's a bed he slept in often in mill 

1409
01:09:48,471 --> 01:09:50,420
valley.
Oh yeah.

1410
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:51,423
That's awesome.
I always wanted to buy his house in the 

1411
01:09:52,881 --> 01:09:54,170
Big Island,
but it burnt down.

1412
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,780
Burned down with like thousands of 
books.

1413
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:57,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

1414
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:01,550
How the fuck does a house burn and 
Hawaiian rain forest.

1415
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:04,460
He lived in a rain forest.
Volcanic eruption?

1416
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:06,730
Yeah.
It's called girlfriend with kerosene.

1417
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:15,080
You guys know I'm a nominated for porn 
award,

1418
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,620
so I tell you that a porn awards nav.
An award.

1419
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,300
Wow.
Okay.

1420
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:21,710
So good.
Yeah.

1421
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:25,440
Best non sex scene in a movie.
What movie was this?

1422
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,080
It's called marriage.
Two point.

1423
01:10:27,081 --> 01:10:28,380
Oh,
and A.

1424
01:10:28,381 --> 01:10:29,810
I'm up.
I'm up against Ron.

1425
01:10:29,811 --> 01:10:32,220
Jeremy.
Dick tribbles.

1426
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:34,600
Yeah.
That's broken.

1427
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:39,090
Has nothing to say.
Congratulations for given some amazing.

1428
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,920
I hope you win.
Well.

1429
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:46,220
I was going to ask you if you guys would
go to Vegas and accepted on my behalf.

1430
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:49,610
Send Red Band.
He'll be there anyway.

1431
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:54,900
Get it for us.
Yeah.

1432
01:10:54,901 --> 01:10:55,490
I,
um,

1433
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:56,323
those things just seem like too much 
sadness for a guy with daughters of the 

1434
01:11:00,481 --> 01:11:03,240
avn awards and just definitely.
Maybe,

1435
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,850
maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe it's a party.

1436
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,030
Brian says it's all like a cam girls 
now.

1437
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,310
That's like the majority of what it is.
I think there is.

1438
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:11,143
I just read about this documentary about
the shift in pornography that like the 

1439
01:11:15,181 --> 01:11:16,014
way that pornography's,
that that industry is kind of 

1440
01:11:18,451 --> 01:11:20,910
disintegrating because of the Internet 
toll free.

1441
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:24,300
One of the many fucking disrupt the 
Internet is disrupting everything.

1442
01:11:24,301 --> 01:11:25,134
Man Isn't from Warren to taxi cabs to 
everything is getting reconfigured by 

1443
01:11:30,571 --> 01:11:31,860
it.
It's so fascinating.

1444
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:34,350
It's unbelievable.
It's a very weird time.

1445
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,030
Not just taxi cabs.
I told you,

1446
01:11:36,031 --> 01:11:36,864
rental cars,
the skirt rental car company to just 

1447
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:39,743
drop your rental car off and then they 
pick it up later like they bring it to 

1448
01:11:43,051 --> 01:11:43,884
you,
sort of like uber for rental cars so 

1449
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:48,660
they could just get a sofa in there.
We'd be in Duncan's future,

1450
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:52,243
some sort of a pod.
I always thought they should make cars 

1451
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:56,490
with cameras.
Right,

1452
01:11:56,491 --> 01:11:57,324
and so you actually sit backwards in the
car and look at a screen that's 

1453
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:02,214
projected of what's in front of you and 
you drive backwards because you think 

1454
01:12:04,891 --> 01:12:06,380
about if you're in a collision,
you're,

1455
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,760
you're good.
If you're driving backwards,

1456
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:09,743
not really.
You're fucked if you're going to get 

1457
01:12:11,311 --> 01:12:12,660
crushed,
crushed,

1458
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:15,450
and it's not good to not know when 
you're impacting.

1459
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,860
Well,
you would know as far as your.

1460
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:18,713
It's like a virtual.
It's as if you're looking out the 

1461
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:21,924
windshield,
but you're actually shifted backwards 

1462
01:12:23,851 --> 01:12:26,280
and it's cameras projecting on the 
screen.

1463
01:12:26,281 --> 01:12:28,960
My brain hurts and probably throw up 
constantly.

1464
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,320
That would be weird.

1465
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:40,500
I just feel like you wouldn't want to 
see the car coming at you rear ending.

1466
01:12:40,501 --> 01:12:43,330
You don't know.
Yeah,

1467
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,360
you wouldn't because you'd be closed,
man.

1468
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,194
Did you see that at the video of Ilan 
mosque finally landing a rocket fucking 

1469
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,840
cool man.
Oh yeah,

1470
01:12:51,841 --> 01:12:52,674
it's bad ass.
It's just like straight out of like old 

1471
01:12:54,751 --> 01:12:57,720
50 Saifai.
It's like exactly the same thing.

1472
01:12:57,721 --> 01:12:58,554
He did it.
He landed a rocket and that guy I heard 

1473
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:02,130
that he is part of a,
uh,

1474
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:03,683
him and some other people have said that
they're going to give a billion dollars 

1475
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:08,784
to create a new artificial intelligence 
research research center or something 

1476
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:16,260
because they're terrified.
Elon Musk and the gunny in England,

1477
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:22,400
the Stephen Hawking you through the gun,
like weird that it's fun.

1478
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:32,040
Oh yes.
They're terrified.

1479
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:32,740
And they're,
they're,

1480
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:33,870
yeah,
they're really.

1481
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:35,063
How do you feel about artificial 
intelligence and artificial 

1482
01:13:39,421 --> 01:13:41,810
intelligence?
It's very rare.

1483
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,610
You have a right to the phone.
I'll check my texts.

1484
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:55,210
Give me your thoughts on this idea.
A hundred percent.

1485
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,950
What I did just busted both of us like 
my impression of a,

1486
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:03,420
but you can't help them fucking things 
or heroin.

1487
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:06,570
They pull you.
Just want to check.

1488
01:14:06,571 --> 01:14:08,910
Maybe the next tweet is going to be 
amazing.

1489
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:12,020
Do someone's going to send me the 
coolest part of in my life to

1490
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:14,310
read it and I'm just going to learn.
But do you read articles?

1491
01:14:14,311 --> 01:14:16,390
I,
I find I store them.

1492
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:18,790
I'm like a fucking squirrel and October 
man,

1493
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:23,140
I got so many tabs open and so many 
things in evernote to read later.

1494
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,273
I'll never read all this style,
but I've got this acquisitive thing 

1495
01:14:26,981 --> 01:14:27,551
like,
oh,

1496
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:28,960
that'll be interesting.
I'll save that.

1497
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:29,930
That old.
I don't know.

1498
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:32,320
They'll go there and that and it's just 
a mess.

1499
01:14:32,321 --> 01:14:34,150
It's a massive.
I'm like a hoarder.

1500
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:35,560
I'm an intellectual hoarder.

1501
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:36,893
I try to practice mindfulness when I'm 
going through my phone so I kind of 

1502
01:14:39,871 --> 01:14:44,640
watch myself as I'm doing it because I 
know I'm addicted and I can see what I'm

1503
01:14:44,641 --> 01:14:48,150
in is at really awful pattern and it's 
like when,

1504
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:49,013
when you,
when you go through it and you analyze 

1505
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,750
what's happening,
you,

1506
01:14:52,751 --> 01:14:55,350
you,
you see that it is a form of drug,

1507
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:58,080
you see that you are getting like little
hits off of it.

1508
01:14:58,081 --> 01:14:58,914
You are getting like weird little like 
moments of like strange information 

1509
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:05,130
intoxication.
Like you get these little white uptake.

1510
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:07,110
So like when you find a particularly 
like,

1511
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:08,213
oh shit,
a fucking vice documentary on the 

1512
01:15:10,170 --> 01:15:12,840
liberation of the city in Iraq.
Whoa,

1513
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:15,630
there's a cat eating a fucking man's 
leg.

1514
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:17,790
Holy Shit.
Uptake,

1515
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:19,170
uptake,
uptake.

1516
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:20,063
You're getting these like weird little 
hits and it's kind of cool and it keeps 

1517
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:24,510
you stuck in a cycle.

1518
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:26,420
But that pull you're talking about,
man,

1519
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:32,400
I had this like a awesome goth friend 
who was into like,

1520
01:15:32,401 --> 01:15:34,050
God,
I can't remember if it's the,

1521
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:34,913
there's a differentiation between death 
metal and black metal and I always get 

1522
01:15:37,021 --> 01:15:37,854
in trouble for mixing them up.
But like he was like explaining to me 

1523
01:15:41,461 --> 01:15:45,960
about a vlog vagueness burzum.
I always get in trouble.

1524
01:15:45,961 --> 01:15:46,794
I get the whole story mixed up.
But basically it was explaining how 

1525
01:15:48,761 --> 01:15:49,594
these guys are actually burning down 
churches and they were really hard core 

1526
01:15:53,521 --> 01:15:55,920
man.
So he plays this a burson,

1527
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:57,390
this death metal for me.
He's like,

1528
01:15:57,391 --> 01:15:58,530
listen,
I was super stoned.

1529
01:15:58,531 --> 01:15:59,071
He's like,
listen,

1530
01:15:59,071 --> 01:16:01,080
listen.
I'm listening to what he's like.

1531
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,870
Do you feel the pull?
It's like,

1532
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,370
shit man,
I do a little bit.

1533
01:16:05,371 --> 01:16:06,204
I know what you're talking about.
It's got a weird dark little gravity to 

1534
01:16:08,551 --> 01:16:09,384
it that if I'm allowed it to,
I could see how I would start getting 

1535
01:16:11,761 --> 01:16:15,650
more and more and more into it.
It's the same with these fucking phones,

1536
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:17,390
man.
They have a true,

1537
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,910
a weird,
magnetic,

1538
01:16:19,911 --> 01:16:24,740
subjective magnetism where you always 
feel it's almost a physical feeling,

1539
01:16:24,741 --> 01:16:25,101
man.
I'm like,

1540
01:16:25,101 --> 01:16:29,270
you almost feel it.
Pulling your attention towards it.

1541
01:16:29,271 --> 01:16:32,330
They're like black holes for attention.
It's interactive.

1542
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:34,280
That's the big factor.
The big factor.

1543
01:16:34,281 --> 01:16:35,810
It's interactive.
You Click on things,

1544
01:16:35,811 --> 01:16:37,430
you can make things happen.
You can open things.

1545
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:38,303
Look at pictures.
It's one of the things that people like 

1546
01:16:39,441 --> 01:16:40,790
about instagram.
You're.

1547
01:16:40,791 --> 01:16:42,110
You're clicking on it and go,
oh,

1548
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,490
look at that picture.
Look at this picture.

1549
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,353
Oh,
I'm going to comment and you're 

1550
01:16:45,051 --> 01:16:47,060
interacting,
not interacting.

1551
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:51,590
It's like some bizarre introduction to a
new type of society.

1552
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:52,910
It's this is.
This is.

1553
01:16:52,911 --> 01:16:55,070
These are the first steps,
these social media steps.

1554
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,113
These are the first steps.
This new type of integrated 

1555
01:16:58,341 --> 01:17:00,390
communication that we're experiencing.
Yeah,

1556
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:02,210
but like we were talking about what the 
city.

1557
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,193
The city separates us from the 
realization that we are just temporary 

1558
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:06,374
beings collecting things needlessly 
because we're only gonna be for a short 

1559
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:10,070
amount of time,

1560
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,903
but yet we spend all of our focus trying
to accumulate the largest pile of shit 

1561
01:17:14,391 --> 01:17:15,224
before we die.
That's sort of the same thing is going 

1562
01:17:17,931 --> 01:17:21,140
on with phones.
It's the same thing that's going on with

1563
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:21,974
everything.
It's like it's solely that pulling us 

1564
01:17:23,451 --> 01:17:26,630
into it's trance and the more we feed 
into it,

1565
01:17:26,631 --> 01:17:28,970
the more we work hard,
the more they'll make more of these,

1566
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:30,620
the more they'll make better ones of 
these.

1567
01:17:30,621 --> 01:17:31,454
The more these things will deeper and 
deeper integrate themselves into your 

1568
01:17:33,891 --> 01:17:34,724
life until the point where they're 
symbiotic until the point where the new 

1569
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:39,050
google contact lens.
Have you seen that shit?

1570
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,393
Google's coming out with a contact lens.
New goddamn contact lens is going to be 

1571
01:17:44,001 --> 01:17:45,650
Google glass.
The contact lens.

1572
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:49,890
It's going to be able to tell your blood
sugar if you're diabetic.

1573
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:52,690
Oh,
project two and everything.

1574
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:53,840
Oh,
you can see shit on it.

1575
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,290
It's going to do everything we can to 
have like porn going in your left eye.

1576
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:58,940
Twenty four slash seven and you're 
right,

1577
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:03,941
I porn your left.
I threw my people see it,

1578
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:11,490
people see and I think it's just a 
matter of time and it's a matter of time

1579
01:18:16,161 --> 01:18:19,070
before they create eyes that are better 
than these eyes.

1580
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,353
These eyes that we have that I need 
reading glasses now to read things that 

1581
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:24,110
are fine print.
I can't like,

1582
01:18:24,111 --> 01:18:26,300
I can't read a book anymore.
I have to have a pair of glasses.

1583
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:30,440
I'm reading a book about how to 
strengthen your eyes when I wear reading

1584
01:18:30,441 --> 01:18:31,490
glasses.
When I read the book.

1585
01:18:31,491 --> 01:18:32,324
It's hilarious.
And you know that the Myopia is out of 

1586
01:18:35,091 --> 01:18:37,880
control and they say it's because kids 
are indoors all the time.

1587
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,130
I think it probably has a lot of 
screens.

1588
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:44,030
A woman named Katie Bowman,
Katy Katy Bowman was on the show and one

1589
01:18:44,031 --> 01:18:47,000
of the way she described it as a cast,
she said,

1590
01:18:47,001 --> 01:18:47,834
if you're,
if you're always looking at something 

1591
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:50,120
that's the same.

1592
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,110
It was Katy Bowman,
right?

1593
01:18:51,111 --> 01:18:52,580
They product this up,
pretty sure.

1594
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:53,723
Um,
she was saying if you're always looking 

1595
01:18:55,041 --> 01:18:57,380
at a certain distance in a certain 
space,

1596
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,770
then that becomes like a cast,
so if you put your arm in a cast and the

1597
01:19:00,771 --> 01:19:01,604
muscle atrophies,
but when you are outside like a normal 

1598
01:19:03,801 --> 01:19:04,634
person,
as you're looking at things that are 

1599
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:05,804
close,
you're looking at things that are far 

1600
01:19:06,231 --> 01:19:07,064
away and it doesn't distort your lens 
when you're staring at a screen all the 

1601
01:19:10,731 --> 01:19:11,564
time,
which I am all the time either doing a 

1602
01:19:13,221 --> 01:19:16,640
podcast or going online or whatever that
fucks with your eyes.

1603
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,190
That's why you know,
people who would read all the time,

1604
01:19:19,191 --> 01:19:21,800
we'd get glasses and people would 
correlate it like,

1605
01:19:21,801 --> 01:19:24,350
oh,
I fucked up his eyes from reading.

1606
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:26,280
He would always say that.
And then they said,

1607
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,111
oh,
that's bullshit,

1608
01:19:27,111 --> 01:19:28,910
but don't say I'm white or some 
bullshit.

1609
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,280
If you read enough,
you're looking at that space,

1610
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,430
has it right in front of you.
Only something really close up,

1611
01:19:34,431 --> 01:19:35,264
but it fucks with your eyes yet.
And also masturbation makes you go 

1612
01:19:38,931 --> 01:19:40,130
blind.
No,

1613
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:40,970
no,
no,

1614
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:41,840
that's true,
right?

1615
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:42,410
No,
none.

1616
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:45,350
If you use your left hand that you just 
need balance.

1617
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:47,030
It's all about balance.
You need,

1618
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,680
um,
he bounced,

1619
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:52,700
but this is this thing you're talking 
about,

1620
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,713
aren't they?
Finding out that there's actually 

1621
01:19:55,131 --> 01:19:55,964
something about that,
like the energy being radiated from the 

1622
01:19:58,311 --> 01:19:59,144
things at night.
Like it fucks with your sleep cycle to 

1623
01:20:00,861 --> 01:20:01,694
like,
oh yeah,

1624
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:02,970
the blue,
the blue wavelengths.

1625
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,600
So get,
get f Dot Lux,

1626
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:07,100
Lux.
It's great.

1627
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:07,980
In fact,
I

1628
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,970
just interviewed a sleep scientist,
uh,

1629
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:10,913
two days ago in San Francisco.
Really interesting guy does research at 

1630
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:14,934
Stanford,
Dan Pardi and we were talking about 

1631
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:18,181
that.
It's the,

1632
01:20:18,181 --> 01:20:20,750
it's the,
the blue end of the wavelength,

1633
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,713
which is what you get from sunlight,
affects the centers of your brain that 

1634
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:27,660
Sorta tell you what time it is in your 
circadian rhythm and all that.

1635
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:32,990
So as you get toward a evening,
you want the light to glow more and more

1636
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:35,840
gold,
yellow and eliminate the blue.

1637
01:20:35,841 --> 01:20:39,870
So this app just automatically filters 
your screen based upon where you are and

1638
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:41,930
what time it is.
And it's,

1639
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:43,013
it's good.
It helps with the sleep because if 

1640
01:20:44,071 --> 01:20:46,950
you're looking at blue light right 
before you go to bed,

1641
01:20:46,951 --> 01:20:49,310
your brain thinks you're in the midday,
you know?

1642
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:53,010
That makes sense.
So plain plane that they're doing,

1643
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:54,083
they're creating this new plane,
they're going to make it out of carbon 

1644
01:20:55,951 --> 01:21:00,480
fiber and they're going to adjust the 
light in the plane to match the light in

1645
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:04,740
the area you're going so that your 
circadian rhythms don't get interrupted.

1646
01:21:04,741 --> 01:21:08,700
No windows and apparently in doing this,
somehow or another,

1647
01:21:08,701 --> 01:21:09,534
they're going to eliminate the type of 
jet lag that a lot of people suffer 

1648
01:21:13,171 --> 01:21:14,004
from.
Yeah,

1649
01:21:14,290 --> 01:21:17,250
because by the time you arrive,
you're already calibrated.

1650
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:18,413
Yeah.
I don't know how the fuck they're doing 

1651
01:21:19,411 --> 01:21:20,940
that.
It doesn't make any sense to me.

1652
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:23,010
I've 16 hour flights.
You know,

1653
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:24,223
I've seen this.
I heard about this new kind of a light 

1654
01:21:27,511 --> 01:21:28,344
that they have that you can put in 
basements that somehow perfectly 

1655
01:21:31,501 --> 01:21:34,530
replicates sunlight so that it's,
ah,

1656
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:37,660
I don't know.
It's amazing because you can grow weed.

1657
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:39,990
No,
it's not heard of those two.

1658
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:45,590
Have you heard of it?
I get some places growing tomatoes.

1659
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:50,480
Fucking go down Ventura Boulevard and 
there's like 15 different stores selling

1660
01:21:50,481 --> 01:21:54,270
you indoor tomato growing supplies.
Fuck,

1661
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:57,890
I just think that's what it was like.
Shit.

1662
01:21:57,891 --> 01:21:59,560
Yeah.
There's a lot of indoor farmer's.

1663
01:21:59,810 --> 01:22:02,300
Another heirloom specialists.
Well,

1664
01:22:02,301 --> 01:22:07,220
did you hear about the a former FBI 
agents whose house got broken down?

1665
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,970
They broke down the door.
Cea,

1666
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:11,690
a dea agents.
I think they shot their dog.

1667
01:22:11,691 --> 01:22:13,360
I don't know that they loved sheepdogs.
You.

1668
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:14,203
It's in the constitution,
arrested them and then found out that 

1669
01:22:16,611 --> 01:22:20,210
they were just really grown tomatoes.
They literally were growing tomatoes,

1670
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:26,120
so these people were for agents.
These guys were retired agents to try to

1671
01:22:26,121 --> 01:22:28,040
grow some vegetables,
make a nice salad.

1672
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,980
They got a fucking gun to their bad 
Karma.

1673
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:35,000
Karma.
Karma in that at least if not Karma.

1674
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:35,953
There's a recognition of the system that
you participated in for most of your 

1675
01:22:38,181 --> 01:22:40,130
adult life.
There's your career.

1676
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,083
Here's what you did.
You Fed this machine and machine that's 

1677
01:22:42,321 --> 01:22:45,200
looking for too much electricity and 
using your basement,

1678
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,660
which could be indicative of plant 
growth.

1679
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,540
Plant growth in your house while you 
fucker.

1680
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:54,620
You're probably a criminal time to kick 
your door in with guns,

1681
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:57,590
but dammit,
we talk about this all the time,

1682
01:22:57,591 --> 01:23:02,591
but if you really let yourself accept 
the fact that right now at this moment,

1683
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:06,090
flying over neighborhoods or high

1684
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:06,923
tech helicopters scanning the third,
the radiation from the houses to find 

1685
01:23:13,841 --> 01:23:18,841
out if inside their growing plants that 
aren't accepted by the state.

1686
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:22,360
That's really weird man.
And that's why I'm leaving.

1687
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:24,400
I'm going back to Spain where they don't
do that shit.

1688
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:26,530
They don't do that.
Don't do Portland neither though,

1689
01:23:26,531 --> 01:23:27,790
Dude.
You say Portland.

1690
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:30,860
Don't have the resources.
Go to Eugene.

1691
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:33,640
I could definitely not do it.
It's nice.

1692
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:37,320
But you've seen the new um,
radar that they have now would,

1693
01:23:37,321 --> 01:23:40,750
they can hook deepened or x Ray?
They look deep into your house.

1694
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:43,280
They can look in your house and see or 
silhouettes as you.

1695
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:46,900
So you can watch people fuck.
Like they could look through this screen

1696
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:50,680
and literally see you inside your house 
blinds drawn,

1697
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:53,560
banging your wife on the bed.
But who wants to see two skeletons?

1698
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:54,450
Fucking.
I really,

1699
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:55,270
really love it.

1700
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:56,890
Why not?
I don't think it's just.

1701
01:23:56,891 --> 01:23:57,724
I think it's like a,
I think you could see images like you 

1702
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:02,080
could see the outside of the body as 
well.

1703
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:04,910
It's not just as simple as like you see 
the scallops actually,

1704
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:05,763
you'll see.
I'm sure they'll figure out a way that 

1705
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:07,643
to interpolate whatever data they're 
gathering and turn it into something 

1706
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:11,224
that isn't shadows,
it's just a matter of time and it's a 

1707
01:24:12,671 --> 01:24:13,504
matter of time.
Any technology that is being controlled 

1708
01:24:16,241 --> 01:24:18,170
by the state,
uh,

1709
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,053
because it's too expensive for normal 
people to obtain eventually more than 

1710
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:26,920
likely will become less and less 
expensive and everyone will have it.

1711
01:24:26,921 --> 01:24:27,754
So if right now there is some,
some insane technology that people are 

1712
01:24:31,061 --> 01:24:33,010
using to look through walls and see 
shadows,

1713
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,480
fuck.
Then it's at what,

1714
01:24:34,481 --> 01:24:35,314
10,
15 years before it's going to be 

1715
01:24:36,641 --> 01:24:37,474
something that you could just order or 
something that you can download on your 

1716
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:40,713
super sophisticated drones for Christmas
is using mobile x Ray Vance to spy on 

1717
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:47,550
unknown targets.

1718
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:52,730
Patrol was a friend of mine used to work
for the company who makes those.

1719
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:53,793
And what they were doing was they were 
scanning container ships coming in and 

1720
01:24:56,561 --> 01:24:57,394
out of the country are coming into the 
country so they could look for drugs 

1721
01:24:59,891 --> 01:25:02,320
without opening up the containers.
Look what this says.

1722
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:03,253
Stop right there for a second.
New York City won't reveal how often 

1723
01:25:05,741 --> 01:25:08,020
cops bombard places,
vehicles,

1724
01:25:08,021 --> 01:25:08,854
or people with radiation,
or if there are health risks for 

1725
01:25:11,321 --> 01:25:13,210
residents,
they won't reveal it.

1726
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:14,283
If you don't talk about the technology 
was used in Afghanistan before and b 

1727
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:17,913
being loosed on us streets.
Each x Ray van cost an estimated 

1728
01:25:21,071 --> 01:25:25,270
$729,000
to $825,000.

1729
01:25:25,271 --> 01:25:26,104
It's a big fucking difference.
I will not talk about anything at all 

1730
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:32,530
about this New York police commissioner.
Bill Bratton until you paid for it.

1731
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,393
Wow.
How's that going to the range of 

1732
01:25:34,931 --> 01:25:39,550
security and counterterrorism activity 
that we engage in added.

1733
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:41,620
They're not used to scan people for 
weapon,

1734
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:42,483
but you know what's hilarious?
They've used the terrorists acts like 

1735
01:25:45,011 --> 01:25:48,550
various terrorist acts all across the 
world to catch people selling drugs.

1736
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:53,790
Because you could sell drugs as an act 
of terror that falls under financing.

1737
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:57,550
They pay,
they just pass some new Patriot Act,

1738
01:25:57,551 --> 01:26:01,870
you know that right now the new Patriot 
Act that was quietly,

1739
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,290
secretly past.
Is that the CIA,

1740
01:26:04,290 --> 01:26:06,980
NSA,
whatever the fuck it is,

1741
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,320
where,
where Obama said I'm going to watch star

1742
01:26:10,321 --> 01:26:12,750
wars.
And he apparently just sign this demonic

1743
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:14,640
thing and that.
Yeah,

1744
01:26:14,641 --> 01:26:15,480
it's scary.

1745
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:16,820
Well,
this,

1746
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:18,063
I mean they,
there's a lot of leeway now for what 

1747
01:26:20,491 --> 01:26:24,720
they can and can't spy on you for what 
they decide to look into your life for.

1748
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:25,763
So let me,
if we follow up what you were saying 

1749
01:26:27,481 --> 01:26:29,670
about how something controlled by the 
state,

1750
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:30,653
you know,
it gets miniaturized and cheaper and 

1751
01:26:32,221 --> 01:26:35,400
eventually becomes available to everyone
if we apply that.

1752
01:26:35,401 --> 01:26:37,830
Same thing to weaponry.
I've been thinking about this for a long

1753
01:26:37,831 --> 01:26:40,260
time.
Nukes are getting smaller and smaller.

1754
01:26:40,261 --> 01:26:42,400
They've got suitcase nukes now,
John.

1755
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:45,090
Yeah.
Much more convenient.

1756
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,220
It's so annoying.
Yeah.

1757
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:49,160
But pack nuke.
I'm tired of suitcases.

1758
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,003
Right?
So are we going to come to the point 

1759
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:56,340
where any terrorist group,
so called terrorist group,

1760
01:26:56,341 --> 01:27:00,000
and I use that word in air quotes,
can have access to these things.

1761
01:27:00,001 --> 01:27:02,520
What's that going to mean to world 
politics?

1762
01:27:02,521 --> 01:27:03,750
Are we going to come to a point?

1763
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,420
Kind of like everyone in Switzerland has
guns.

1764
01:27:06,450 --> 01:27:08,790
You know that this philosophy,
if everyone had guns,

1765
01:27:08,791 --> 01:27:11,020
everyone would show out and be nice to 
each other.

1766
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,393
Are we going to come to that point 
internationally where if people are 

1767
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:17,064
aggrieved enough,
they can really fuck up the game and so 

1768
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:24,900
then the attention will shift to not 
having people so aggrieved because right

1769
01:27:24,901 --> 01:27:26,120
now we don't give a fuck,
right?

1770
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:27,380
We'll go blow them up.
If they're.

1771
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:29,610
If they're that pissed off,
they're going to come for us,

1772
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:31,110
then we'll send drones and kill them 
all,

1773
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:34,560
but if they could come for us with a 
speedboat and nukes,

1774
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:36,203
is that a game changer or do you think 
the whole thing just shifts to another 

1775
01:27:38,221 --> 01:27:42,030
level and us have to address the root of
the problem?

1776
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:42,893
If it was that accessible.
Now it's like the ultimate statement of 

1777
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:50,240
an armed society is a polite society.
Yeah.

1778
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:52,620
It's almost like the ultimate expression
of that,

1779
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:56,400
like in a well armed nuclear society has
fucking super polite.

1780
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:57,893
Imagine,
knock on your neighbor's door and tell 

1781
01:27:58,681 --> 01:28:01,550
him his dogs barking too loud when he's 
wearing a fucking nuke vest.

1782
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:05,670
Flow up the way you saying my dog is 
making too much noise.

1783
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:06,540
Okay.
Fuck it man.

1784
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:08,360
I want to take care of them.
Do you want the dog?

1785
01:28:08,361 --> 01:28:10,170
I'm going to hit this button.
Let's just do this.

1786
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,150
I'm going to wipe out the whole block.
No Man.

1787
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,740
What?
What you're talking about.

1788
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:13,940
I,

1789
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:14,773
I did an interview up a very good point.
I didn't interview at Singularity 

1790
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:18,791
University in,
in any,

1791
01:28:18,791 --> 01:28:22,470
in.
He brought up this exact thing any,

1792
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:25,210
any and and which is that,
you know,

1793
01:28:25,230 --> 01:28:26,063
he was explaining it in terms of bio 
weapons that people are creating these 

1794
01:28:31,841 --> 01:28:34,910
like apparently are like fucking around 
with genes in their,

1795
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:37,080
in their,
in their garages.

1796
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:38,333
And then you were saying like things 
like the ability to launch satellites 

1797
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:44,880
and just about anything you can imagine.
He's what he said,

1798
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:46,860
and I,
I think he may have,

1799
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:47,461
I mean,
I don't know.

1800
01:28:47,461 --> 01:28:48,294
He didn't say he was exaggerating when 
you said we're looking at if technology 

1801
01:28:51,121 --> 01:28:51,954
continues to accelerate as it is,
we're looking at a point in human 

1802
01:28:55,381 --> 01:28:58,680
history where anybody,
if they wanted to,

1803
01:28:59,230 --> 01:29:03,360
could destroy the entire,
are caused massive damage.

1804
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:05,270
And so,
uh,

1805
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:06,780
you think to yourself,
all right,

1806
01:29:06,781 --> 01:29:08,820
well,
let's imagine that that was the case.

1807
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:09,983
And somehow by some miracle,
every government of the world suddenly 

1808
01:29:13,441 --> 01:29:16,620
figured out a way to address everybody's
personal issues.

1809
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:17,783
There was still going to be one or two 
more likely a thousand people who are 

1810
01:29:21,901 --> 01:29:22,734
like,
no,

1811
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:23,633
that's cool man.
But I think I'm going to detonate this 

1812
01:29:25,801 --> 01:29:29,400
nuclear bomb that I created in my three 
d printer,

1813
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:31,890
getting from fucking,
who knows how.

1814
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:32,813
I mean,
it's a big question mark or something 

1815
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:35,790
even worse than that.
So this thing,

1816
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,620
what you're talking about,
I think is the,

1817
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:40,020
uh,
that awful race,

1818
01:29:40,021 --> 01:29:42,120
Terence Mckenna talks about that we're 
in,

1819
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,313
which is that here we have this race 
between absolute destruction and some 

1820
01:29:47,731 --> 01:29:51,870
kind of via tech technology that doesn't
even exist yet.

1821
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:57,180
And some kind of Utopian awakening.
I know this kind of stuff probably makes

1822
01:29:57,181 --> 01:30:00,470
you want to punch me,
but I want hug you.

1823
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,610
It's ridiculous.
But,

1824
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:03,613
but,
but,

1825
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:04,740
but these are these two,
you know,

1826
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:07,830
these are these two races that are 
happening right now.

1827
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:08,663
One of them is without question,
technology is going to get to the point 

1828
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:18,930
where every single human has access to 
some kind of device,

1829
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:22,320
more powerful than any other human in 
the past ever had access to.

1830
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:24,143
And the question is,
is that gonna happen before some other 

1831
01:30:29,731 --> 01:30:30,564
form of technology emerges that makes us
all unifying to one organism or some 

1832
01:30:34,650 --> 01:30:36,600
beautiful thing happens.
I mean,

1833
01:30:36,601 --> 01:30:40,380
it's a pretty terrifying.
It's a terrifying relay race man.

1834
01:30:40,381 --> 01:30:41,410
It really is.
It's a tear.

1835
01:30:41,411 --> 01:30:43,200
It's not really,
it's a terrifying race.

1836
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:45,450
And um,
but isn't that kind of always,

1837
01:30:45,451 --> 01:30:45,540
always

1838
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:46,373
the case?
Like we need some sort of a problem to 

1839
01:30:48,421 --> 01:30:50,190
overcome it.
We need competition.

1840
01:30:50,191 --> 01:30:52,410
We need the Yin and the Yang.
We need a dark and a light.

1841
01:30:52,411 --> 01:30:53,890
We need the,
you know,

1842
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:56,220
we need to tide.
We need like a cycle.

1843
01:30:56,530 --> 01:31:00,450
It's almost like we need this resistance
of like us building towards this,

1844
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:01,583
this technological singularity almost.
It's going to be in your fucking iphone 

1845
01:31:06,070 --> 01:31:08,780
and everyone's going to have the ability
and well,

1846
01:31:08,890 --> 01:31:11,550
we have to fix humanity in order to have
this happen.

1847
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:13,230
The only way that we're going to 
survive,

1848
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:16,320
we fixed humanity and so,
you know what I've been thinking,

1849
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,660
it's just something I'd never talked to 
him economists about this,

1850
01:31:18,661 --> 01:31:22,320
but in my own stupid head,
um,

1851
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:23,243
I think we're going to run into a 
bottleneck with technology and I think 

1852
01:31:26,401 --> 01:31:30,870
one of the big bottlenecks is technology
is all about access to information,

1853
01:31:30,871 --> 01:31:31,470
right?

1854
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:33,180
Technology like as far as what's going 
on,

1855
01:31:33,181 --> 01:31:35,940
it's like your,
your ability to do things,

1856
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:37,043
whether it's to project images on 
screens or to download things faster or 

1857
01:31:40,861 --> 01:31:41,694
to number crunch cruncher,
the various different things that 

1858
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,490
technology can do.
But what we're using,

1859
01:31:47,491 --> 01:31:48,324
the way we're using it today was a big 
factor is the ability to exchange 

1860
01:31:52,201 --> 01:31:53,034
information and the access to 
information and the access to each 

1861
01:31:54,901 --> 01:31:55,734
other.
And it seems like it's getting closer 

1862
01:31:56,761 --> 01:31:57,810
and closer and closer.
Right?

1863
01:31:57,811 --> 01:32:00,100
Access is getting quicker.
It's more information,

1864
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:00,953
it's easier to get to the boundaries 
between people are getting smaller and 

1865
01:32:02,921 --> 01:32:04,240
smaller.
What's the bottleneck?

1866
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:07,900
Bottleneck is going to be money and 
money is ones and Zeros.

1867
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:09,280
That's what money is.
Money,

1868
01:32:09,281 --> 01:32:10,114
right?
If of all,

1869
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:14,740
ultimately all information becomes 
available to all people at all times.

1870
01:32:14,741 --> 01:32:16,170
That's ultimate enlightenment,
right?

1871
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:18,940
Instantaneous information constantly 
available to everyone.

1872
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:20,133
Well,
isn't money information now because 

1873
01:32:21,521 --> 01:32:23,550
money's not sacks or old.
You're not talking about,

1874
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:24,423
you know,
I've got.

1875
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:28,070
I've got 15 bushels or gold.
How many of you got when you know?

1876
01:32:28,071 --> 01:32:28,904
No,
we're talking about some weird ones and 

1877
01:32:29,891 --> 01:32:34,891
Zeros and plastic that makes these ones 
and Zeros transfer your magnetic strip.

1878
01:32:35,621 --> 01:32:36,454
You slide on the machine.
You Punch in your numbers is not real 

1879
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:43,840
anymore.
It's information and in transferring our

1880
01:32:43,841 --> 01:32:47,740
money to inflammation,
the bottleneck is going to be money.

1881
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,440
We're going to come to this ultimate 
point where we realized,

1882
01:32:50,441 --> 01:32:52,120
look,
we can't protect money anymore.

1883
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,340
We can't.
You can't say this has duncan's money.

1884
01:32:54,341 --> 01:32:56,610
This is Christmas money because it's 
going to be just mine.

1885
01:32:57,210 --> 01:32:58,043
It's going to be just money and I mean 
maybe there'll be some sort of a merit 

1886
01:33:01,271 --> 01:33:02,104
based system where you can have access 
to money or use money and we'll have to 

1887
01:33:07,091 --> 01:33:07,924
figure out some sort of a way around it,
but it'll have to be some sort of like 

1888
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:11,770
ethical thing that we all agree on.

1889
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:15,190
If I'm looking at it correctly and I'm 
looking at all of this,

1890
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:19,660
these trends that lead to quicker and 
quicker access to information,

1891
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:22,150
more and more availability of that 
information,

1892
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,670
access to information becoming 
universal.

1893
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:25,541
Well,
what's the money?

1894
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:26,920
Money.
Money is information.

1895
01:33:26,921 --> 01:33:28,300
It's ones and Zeros.
It's all it is.

1896
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:29,473
Well,
how are you going to stop it if that's 

1897
01:33:29,981 --> 01:33:33,400
the trend of the trend ultimately 
becomes instantaneous.

1898
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:37,630
Constant access to all information for 
everybody knows secrets.

1899
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,520
None exist anymore.
They don't exist.

1900
01:33:39,521 --> 01:33:41,040
I could read your email.
You can read mine.

1901
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:42,700
We're all communicating with each other.
That's it.

1902
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:45,280
There's no more secrets.
How does money fit in there?

1903
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:46,563
Unless we go back to fucking collecting 
clam shells and putting them on strings 

1904
01:33:49,181 --> 01:33:50,790
and this is a.
This is my company,

1905
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:53,190
not so I have a mushroom.
That's what I'm used to it.

1906
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:54,850
We're going to have silver coins and 
shit.

1907
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:56,130
What are we going to do?
But.

1908
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:59,450
But I would question the premise that 
money ever was real.

1909
01:34:00,450 --> 01:34:03,210
You seem to be saying that we're 
reaching a point where it will no longer

1910
01:34:03,211 --> 01:34:06,960
be real like bushels of gold.
That's just symbolic too.

1911
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:07,883
I don't think money ever was anything 
more than agreement between people that 

1912
01:34:11,191 --> 01:34:13,110
we're all going to pretend this is real.
It's true,

1913
01:34:13,111 --> 01:34:14,910
right?
Because it it locally.

1914
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:17,130
Your money is different than someone in 
Greece.

1915
01:34:17,450 --> 01:34:19,360
You,
you mean you go with your money there.

1916
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,540
There's some sort of exchange.
You have to make an agreement.

1917
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:23,220
Do you accept my money will accept your 
money,

1918
01:34:23,221 --> 01:34:25,590
but it's not really worth a dollar.
How much is it worth over here?

1919
01:34:26,010 --> 01:34:27,700
Seventy five cents,
God dammit,

1920
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:31,140
but last month it was a dollar 25.
Well Times have changed.

1921
01:34:31,141 --> 01:34:34,200
We don't like your money as much anymore
and they make deals.

1922
01:34:34,290 --> 01:34:37,830
Our central bank who's staffed by people
we don't know.

1923
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:39,720
I mean,
there's a lot of mystery at the heart of

1924
01:34:39,721 --> 01:34:42,840
it is to be able to go to Canada and it 
was Canada and it was awesome.

1925
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:46,040
We do Montreal and you'd get like a 
dollar 50 for a dollar,

1926
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,500
something like that,
and it was amazing.

1927
01:34:48,501 --> 01:34:51,080
Like food would be cheaper,
everything will be cheaper.

1928
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:51,471
Like,
ah,

1929
01:34:51,471 --> 01:34:52,304
your money goes a long way in Canada.
And then it shifted and then the 

1930
01:34:54,541 --> 01:34:57,150
Canadians would come to America because 
the money would go a long way here.

1931
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:58,310
Money was worth more than ours.

1932
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:00,600
Have you ever heard of Grant Morrison?
Yeah.

1933
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:02,100
Do you know Graham?
You should have them on the show,

1934
01:35:02,101 --> 01:35:04,840
man.
He's just refresh my memory.

1935
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:08,130
Grant Morrison is that he writes a bunch
of incredible comic books.

1936
01:35:08,131 --> 01:35:11,190
One of them I'm super into right now,
graphic novels called the,

1937
01:35:11,191 --> 01:35:12,330
uh,
the invisibles,

1938
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,100
but he's really smart.
There's a,

1939
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:17,040
there's a grant morrison lecture,
a descent.

1940
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:21,940
He was like at a disinfecting gathering 
and he gives this really cool lecture or

1941
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:22,793
a talk.
And one of the things he said is that 

1942
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:25,463
the super elite,
they have gone back to a barter economy 

1943
01:35:28,650 --> 01:35:29,483
because money doesn't mean anything to 
you if you have billions and billions 

1944
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:33,503
and billions of dollars.
So the normal way to get someone to do 

1945
01:35:34,861 --> 01:35:35,850
something is to say,
okay,

1946
01:35:35,851 --> 01:35:38,910
I'll give you x dollars for you to do 
this thing.

1947
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:43,650
But if you've got infinite money and 
someone asks you to do something to give

1948
01:35:43,651 --> 01:35:46,380
you more money to add to your infinite 
pool of money,

1949
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:47,940
it's not an incentive anymore.

1950
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:50,610
You're not incentivized by money.
So it's more like,

1951
01:35:50,611 --> 01:35:53,130
what can you do?
For me what it's like a,

1952
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:55,140
it's a.
It goes back to some kind of weird,

1953
01:35:55,141 --> 01:35:59,520
maybe you're going to barter power,
maybe you're going to barter some access

1954
01:35:59,521 --> 01:36:00,354
or something like that,
but money is irrelevant to the super 

1955
01:36:02,501 --> 01:36:05,430
elite.
Money only means something to people who

1956
01:36:05,431 --> 01:36:08,840
are in the lower and middle class.
Once you have an infinite amount of this

1957
01:36:08,841 --> 01:36:09,674
shit,
it's completely an absolutely 

1958
01:36:11,401 --> 01:36:12,810
irrelevant,
which is what you're saying.

1959
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:13,853
Everything then theoretically would have
to go back to some weird barter economy 

1960
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:17,520
where

1961
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,353
would never going to reach a point of 
ultimate resources where everyone has 

1962
01:36:20,701 --> 01:36:21,534
the same access to things at the super 
elite does because there's just not 

1963
01:36:23,671 --> 01:36:24,460
enough.

1964
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:25,293
Well,
this is where you get into like this is 

1965
01:36:26,381 --> 01:36:30,850
where you get into the idea of 
experienced generation.

1966
01:36:30,851 --> 01:36:33,970
You know like if we get to like Google 
this thing,

1967
01:36:33,971 --> 01:36:35,800
you're talking about Google contact 
lenses,

1968
01:36:35,801 --> 01:36:40,801
it's not going to stop at the right.
Technology is doing the thing to us that

1969
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:46,070
the fucking face suckers on aliens do.
It started off far away.

1970
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:50,580
It was our phones.
It was our computers than it like a.

1971
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:54,010
It was on our desks.
It was a nice safe distance.

1972
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:58,120
Then it got into our pockets.
It tried to climb onto our face with the

1973
01:36:58,121 --> 01:37:00,190
google glasses,
but nobody liked that.

1974
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:03,940
But now it's getting into our eyes and 
it's not gonna stop at our eyes.

1975
01:37:03,941 --> 01:37:06,700
Technology's gonna,
merge with our consciousness and when it

1976
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:07,563
merges with our consciousness,
the theory would be that it could 

1977
01:37:09,401 --> 01:37:13,780
somehow create experiences that were 
indistinguishable from reality,

1978
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:16,720
which means that really what's the 
difference?

1979
01:37:16,721 --> 01:37:18,970
There is no more.
You can't like.

1980
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:19,893
You know what?
We're already using bionic parts on 

1981
01:37:21,281 --> 01:37:22,130
people,
right?

1982
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,410
Sure.
Hips,

1983
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:25,250
yeah.
Yeah.

1984
01:37:25,251 --> 01:37:28,190
All sorts of stuff.
My wife has ocular implants.

1985
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:32,090
She has lenses surgically implanted in 
her eyes.

1986
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:32,930
Yeah.
This is.

1987
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:34,370
I mean,
this is not new stuff.

1988
01:37:34,430 --> 01:37:35,263
They're doing artificial knees.
They're doing artificial hips and how 

1989
01:37:38,661 --> 01:37:41,990
long is it gonna be before someone comes
along and says,

1990
01:37:41,991 --> 01:37:42,780
listen,
dumped.

1991
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:45,650
You have two choices.
You can either wear glasses,

1992
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:46,603
you have 2,400
vision and you know we have classes for 

1993
01:37:48,261 --> 01:37:48,570
you.
Didn't.

1994
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:51,800
That's fine if you enjoy it or is a 
really simple procedure.

1995
01:37:51,801 --> 01:37:52,634
Takes five minutes.
We were placed your eyeball with an 

1996
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:56,040
artificial.
You don't feel any

1997
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,890
pain,
but you'll have to put up with ads every

1998
01:37:58,891 --> 01:38:00,060
60 seconds.
Well,

1999
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,640
you can click that ad.
You can click the ad.

2000
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:05,580
You just reach up.
You've touched.

2001
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:07,873
This is what.
What's the name of that that thought 

2002
01:38:09,991 --> 01:38:12,540
experiment about the ship?
Somebody ship,

2003
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:13,980
you know,
the one where it's like,

2004
01:38:13,981 --> 01:38:14,814
it's like the idea is like at a sailor 
is sailing across the ocean and the 

2005
01:38:19,711 --> 01:38:20,544
mast,
he needs to replace the mast until we 

2006
01:38:22,081 --> 01:38:24,640
replaced the mast and then he replaces,
I can't remember his name.

2007
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:27,630
The different shifts,
different by the time it gets there,

2008
01:38:27,631 --> 01:38:29,760
it's all new parts,
but it's still his ship.

2009
01:38:29,761 --> 01:38:31,920
So it's like with the,
with technology,

2010
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:33,023
it's the same thing.
Like what if we keep replacing our 

2011
01:38:34,821 --> 01:38:36,810
spirit is the ship of theseus.
That's it.

2012
01:38:36,811 --> 01:38:38,580
Yeah.
So yeah,

2013
01:38:38,581 --> 01:38:40,170
the idea is like when is,
when do we,

2014
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:41,183
when,
when,

2015
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:44,110
what is humanity or when do we stop 
being human?

2016
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:46,350
The whole idea about downloading 
consciousness,

2017
01:38:46,351 --> 01:38:47,184
right?
Way To put consciousness into a 

2018
01:38:48,661 --> 01:38:50,700
computer.
And how do you know when you've done it?

2019
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:52,680
Like how do you know what consciousness 
is?

2020
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:53,533
I mean his consciousness inexorably 
attached to your physical being or is 

2021
01:38:57,511 --> 01:38:59,880
consciousness something that's out there
that you're just,

2022
01:39:00,150 --> 01:39:00,870
you're,
you're,

2023
01:39:00,870 --> 01:39:03,810
you're consciousness is riding around 
this meat wagon.

2024
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:05,520
Is that what's going on?
We don't.

2025
01:39:05,550 --> 01:39:07,470
There's no agreement on that.
Also,

2026
01:39:07,471 --> 01:39:12,120
we need to define what we mean by human 
because I would argue that we've already

2027
01:39:12,121 --> 01:39:15,600
left human experience and we're already 
well into something else.

2028
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:18,330
What would you call it that we're into?
Um,

2029
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:21,830
I equate it to do.
You might know this,

2030
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:25,920
that every locust starts off as a 
grasshopper.

2031
01:39:26,490 --> 01:39:28,750
And what happens is there's this,
uh,

2032
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:30,070
particular,
uh,

2033
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:30,953
the best example is in North Africa.
It's this species of grasshopper that 

2034
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:39,060
when the density of the population 
density gets tight,

2035
01:39:39,061 --> 01:39:39,894
sufficiently tight,
there's a trigger point and different 

2036
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:44,940
genes are triggered and activated in 
the,

2037
01:39:44,941 --> 01:39:47,500
in the body,
the preexisting gene.

2038
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:50,640
So it's the same DNA,
but it changes the shape of the head,

2039
01:39:50,641 --> 01:39:52,770
changes the legs,
changes the coloration,

2040
01:39:52,771 --> 01:39:53,604
and changes the behavior.
And that's when they become locusts 

2041
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:56,483
swarm.
And so I think that humans are like the 

2042
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:01,013
grasshopper locusts.
And I think that with agriculture we 

2043
01:40:03,181 --> 01:40:04,014
became locus and started swarming and 
we're willing to swarm behavior at this 

2044
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:09,810
point.
And so for the sake of argument,

2045
01:40:09,811 --> 01:40:10,644
I would say human,
the way I would define it is hunter 

2046
01:40:14,131 --> 01:40:14,964
gatherer,
which is 95 plus percent of our time on 

2047
01:40:17,341 --> 01:40:18,174
the planet.
That's human behavior and what we are 

2048
01:40:20,281 --> 01:40:25,281
now is shifted into this other,
you could say artificial.

2049
01:40:25,381 --> 01:40:26,214
You could just say emergent behavior 
pattern that conflicts with our 

2050
01:40:30,601 --> 01:40:32,160
grasshopper illness.
Right?

2051
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:35,340
And that we're suffering from.
That's what this latest book is about.

2052
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:37,820
And so,
you know,

2053
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:38,833
I would say we're no longer human.
It's like we're a bunch of poodles 

2054
01:40:41,581 --> 01:40:43,440
talking about when we stopped being 
wolves,

2055
01:40:43,441 --> 01:40:44,400
you know,
I'll tell you this,

2056
01:40:44,401 --> 01:40:48,630
if I was a fucking locust and there was 
a grasshopper that's like,

2057
01:40:50,570 --> 01:40:51,870
I'd be like,
awesome,

2058
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:54,250
because I can fly.
I'm flying,

2059
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,710
I've evolved.
This is our major disagreement.

2060
01:40:56,711 --> 01:40:58,210
Years.
You want to be a grasshopper.

2061
01:40:58,450 --> 01:41:00,310
I'm cool with being a locus,
but.

2062
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:04,960
But it's,
it's an interesting thing,

2063
01:41:04,961 --> 01:41:05,450
right?
Well,

2064
01:41:05,450 --> 01:41:06,283
what I think you're saying is there's 
more inherent biological happiness into 

2065
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:12,460
remaining of grasshopper or remaining of
human right?

2066
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:13,383
That's why the things that make that 
resonate most deeply with us are the 

2067
01:41:16,931 --> 01:41:21,340
things that reflect the culture alive.
You hunting for example,

2068
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:24,670
you're not having trouble focusing your 
mind when you're hunting.

2069
01:41:24,810 --> 01:41:29,810
You don't think there's your tapping and
if you ever caught a nice fish,

2070
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:30,813
you've got fishing.
I know that feeling when you catch a 

2071
01:41:32,351 --> 01:41:34,090
nice fish,
there's a like a feeling.

2072
01:41:35,050 --> 01:41:35,883
There's a primal reaction.
I'm saying a nice fish because it's 

2073
01:41:39,191 --> 01:41:42,040
easier for people to accept because it's
a cold blooded animal.

2074
01:41:42,150 --> 01:41:45,370
Like something about like saying there's
something about when you get a nice deer

2075
01:41:45,371 --> 01:41:46,990
in your sites and you're ready to end 
its life.

2076
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:48,280
People like,
no,

2077
01:41:48,670 --> 01:41:52,390
right when I'm about to eat a bear,
but you say a fish.

2078
01:41:52,391 --> 01:41:52,720
They go,
oh,

2079
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,460
he caught a fish.
They eat other fish,

2080
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:57,340
whatever.
It's just for whatever reason,

2081
01:41:57,341 --> 01:41:59,770
people don't care if you catch a fish,
they don't give a fuck.

2082
01:41:59,830 --> 01:42:00,710
We,
we,

2083
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:01,733
we differentiate.
We have more value in warm blooded 

2084
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:07,540
animals than we put in in fish for 
whatever.

2085
01:42:07,541 --> 01:42:10,030
Fucking you can't scream.
I mean,

2086
01:42:10,031 --> 01:42:13,190
I think if,
what is Mitch Hedberg,

2087
01:42:13,191 --> 01:42:14,024
it's got that great joke like thank God 
the fish can't scream because the ocean 

2088
01:42:17,081 --> 01:42:22,081
would be the scariest Jackie each other.
That's true.

2089
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:24,013
That's right.
But there is something about their 

2090
01:42:25,361 --> 01:42:27,580
expression.
Listening is that many people,

2091
01:42:27,581 --> 01:42:29,170
I think they don't take care of their 
young.

2092
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:31,390
That's a big one.
Like this woman said that to me,

2093
01:42:31,391 --> 01:42:32,224
one of the reasons why she eats fish,
she doesn't eat chicken or any other 

2094
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:35,050
animals.

2095
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:35,681
I go,
why?

2096
01:42:35,681 --> 01:42:36,221
She goes,
well,

2097
01:42:36,221 --> 01:42:38,020
the fish don't take care of their young.
I was like,

2098
01:42:38,021 --> 01:42:38,860
damn,
that's gangster.

2099
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:41,580
She drew the line in the sand and they 
eat each other.

2100
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:42,913
Well,
they're cannibals like almost 

2101
01:42:43,691 --> 01:42:44,650
exclusively.
I mean,

2102
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:48,620
I mean almost a universally like trout.
One of the best ways to catch trout as a

2103
01:42:48,621 --> 01:42:50,860
little baby trout floors that looked 
like a trail.

2104
01:42:51,190 --> 01:42:52,023
Large mouth bass,
large mouth bass lowers occasionally 

2105
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:55,870
catch them with those,
you know,

2106
01:42:55,871 --> 01:42:56,704
they don't give a fuck.
They're just here to eat whatever they 

2107
01:42:58,421 --> 01:42:59,254
can eat done.
But it's innately inherently meaningful 

2108
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:05,770
is what I'm saying.
Right?

2109
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:06,613
And the reason it's inherently 
meaningful is because that's the animal 

2110
01:43:08,801 --> 01:43:09,634
that we evolved to be.
And now we live in this society that's 

2111
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,233
distracting us from that.
Trying to sell it back and little 

2112
01:43:14,711 --> 01:43:15,544
pieces.
Maybe you can afford a hunting weekend 

2113
01:43:16,961 --> 01:43:19,210
in Utah at this ranch.
Uh,

2114
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:20,103
and what,
what the hell was the point of losing 

2115
01:43:24,041 --> 01:43:26,530
the humanity?
When do we stop being human?

2116
01:43:26,531 --> 01:43:27,364
Yeah,
I think we already have and I think 

2117
01:43:28,181 --> 01:43:29,014
that's the major fucking ailment of our 
time as far is a part of it and I 

2118
01:43:34,451 --> 01:43:35,284
certainly think there's a series of 
reward systems in our bodies that are 

2119
01:43:37,781 --> 01:43:41,080
not getting checked off like they used 
to like rewards,

2120
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:43,390
like fear,
overcoming fear,

2121
01:43:43,870 --> 01:43:46,420
difficulty,
physical exertion,

2122
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:49,030
all these different things that people 
did and then the,

2123
01:43:49,031 --> 01:43:50,680
the,
the thing of seeing the fish,

2124
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:52,050
catching the fish oil.

2125
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:56,600
There's this visceral genetic response 
to getting a fish like you got it.

2126
01:43:56,601 --> 01:43:59,000
Now you're going to eat and that and 
your friends are going to.

2127
01:43:59,001 --> 01:44:01,760
Yes,
and when you pull a big fish like ah,

2128
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:04,280
there's this weird feeling where 
everybody,

2129
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:06,970
you get a little charge like we were.
We were.

2130
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:09,830
We had a successful gathering.
You got something,

2131
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:11,053
now we can eat and that's any built in.
It's built into your system and it 

2132
01:44:14,181 --> 01:44:15,014
doesn't exist.
When you go to the supermarket and you 

2133
01:44:15,981 --> 01:44:16,814
pick up that salmon steak that's already
in Saran wrap and it's already got the 

2134
01:44:19,671 --> 01:44:22,700
little styrofoam bottom that you don't 
feel a damn thing.

2135
01:44:22,701 --> 01:44:25,010
You don't feel anything but eat the same
amount of nutrients.

2136
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:27,710
It's very strange what we've done.
We've done,

2137
01:44:27,711 --> 01:44:28,544
we've completely removed all the natural
elements while needing those natural 

2138
01:44:32,031 --> 01:44:32,864
elements at the same time.
So we removed any connection that we 

2139
01:44:35,931 --> 01:44:40,010
have to like we're eating this.
Chris has brought this amazing ham.

2140
01:44:40,011 --> 01:44:41,150
What does this stuff called?
Again?

2141
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:43,520
I'm on Google.
It's delicious.

2142
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:45,560
And explain it because it's a really 
cool way they,

2143
01:44:45,561 --> 01:44:46,200
they make it

2144
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:46,920
right.
It's this,

2145
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:47,753
it's made from pigs that are the same 
race of pigs that the Romans brought to 

2146
01:44:51,001 --> 01:44:54,180
Spain originally 2000 years ago.
There.

2147
01:44:54,181 --> 01:44:56,340
It's called Pata Negra,
which means black foot.

2148
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:59,170
And this is so in Spanish Ham.
It's a,

2149
01:44:59,171 --> 01:45:02,490
there are different gradations and this 
is the highest gradation.

2150
01:45:02,970 --> 01:45:05,400
And uh,
all they do is eat acorns.

2151
01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:08,700
They live out in these big open fields.
Beautiful.

2152
01:45:08,701 --> 01:45:09,534
I've driven through there and the extra 
my daughter on my motorcycle and then 

2153
01:45:12,901 --> 01:45:14,700
they're cured.
It's not cooked at all.

2154
01:45:14,701 --> 01:45:16,890
It's not smoked.
It's cured with salt.

2155
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:20,550
Lots of salt and then hung up and 
certain temperature.

2156
01:45:20,551 --> 01:45:23,010
And how long is it good for?
How long does it sit for?

2157
01:45:23,230 --> 01:45:24,063
Forever.
Forever.

2158
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:25,700
And you can buy these.
I mean,

2159
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:26,573
I would love to bring you one,
but I don't think they let them in the 

2160
01:45:28,351 --> 01:45:29,910
country,
but you buy the whole leg.

2161
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:31,140
Whoa.
Like a whole ham.

2162
01:45:31,141 --> 01:45:32,010
It's cured.
Yeah.

2163
01:45:32,011 --> 01:45:35,010
And in most Spanish houses they'll have 
a ham and it'll be there.

2164
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:36,073
And so they've got this holder and you 
have a long knife and you slice it 

2165
01:45:39,331 --> 01:45:41,010
really thin.
So it just doesn't go

2166
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:42,000
bad at all.
No,

2167
01:45:42,001 --> 01:45:42,834
because it's cured.
That's incredible that you could have a 

2168
01:45:44,251 --> 01:45:45,830
whole ham leg sitting out

2169
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:47,450
all the way inside.
Yeah,

2170
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:48,860
that's crazy.
So you put a,

2171
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:51,560
you put a towel over it or something so 
that flies,

2172
01:45:51,561 --> 01:45:52,760
don't get on it.
And that's it,

2173
01:45:52,761 --> 01:45:53,594
you know,
and it can be there and it's a 

2174
01:45:54,681 --> 01:45:57,320
traditional thing around Christmas to,
you know,

2175
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:00,860
give a gift of a ham and a in it'll 
last,

2176
01:46:00,861 --> 01:46:01,311
you know,
five,

2177
01:46:01,311 --> 01:46:03,020
six months,
whatever till they're done eating it.

2178
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:04,430
That's crazy.
Yeah.

2179
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:07,330
So my point being that this,
this meat is in front of us.

2180
01:46:07,331 --> 01:46:08,164
It's delicious.
It was from an animal that wasn't even 

2181
01:46:09,601 --> 01:46:13,240
the live on this continent.
Someone killed it in Spain.

2182
01:46:13,241 --> 01:46:14,770
Did all this stuff to you.
Brought it over here,

2183
01:46:14,771 --> 01:46:15,604
we're eating it.
We have zero connection to any of those 

2184
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:19,540
activities.
We don't want to have.

2185
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,790
We just eating it and it's delicious.
We're loving it,

2186
01:46:22,390 --> 01:46:26,260
but it's all on.
Not as much as if we'd raise the pig and

2187
01:46:26,261 --> 01:46:28,570
been involved in the process.
You know,

2188
01:46:28,571 --> 01:46:30,550
I cooked a ham.
I smoked a ham.

2189
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:31,843
I haven't done one for about six months,
but the last one I did was an animal 

2190
01:46:34,811 --> 01:46:39,811
that I shot and I smoked it in my brined
it for six days and then I smoked.

2191
01:46:40,111 --> 01:46:42,310
It was like this big project that I did 
and yeah,

2192
01:46:42,311 --> 01:46:44,980
it was a way different sort of a feeling
when you're eating and it's like,

2193
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:46,053
like I have a leg,
I have a peg leg of a full ham on the 

2194
01:46:48,671 --> 01:46:50,040
bone.
That's about that

2195
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:50,873
big that's sitting in my freezer that 
I'm eventually going to Brian sometime 

2196
01:46:53,611 --> 01:46:54,444
soon and I'll stick that sucker in this 
w like water with garlic and salt and 

2197
01:46:59,941 --> 01:47:00,774
brown sugar and it sits in there for 
about six days and then I smoke it at 

2198
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:07,410
like 250 degrees for hours and hours 
until.

2199
01:47:07,411 --> 01:47:09,390
It's just as juicy,
delicious,

2200
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:13,200
and a 140 degrees in the center.
So you know all the parasites,

2201
01:47:13,201 --> 01:47:15,330
potential parasites are dead.
God.

2202
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:16,110
So good.

2203
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:18,750
I got a big green egg and I got to say,
man,

2204
01:47:18,930 --> 01:47:22,770
there's nothing.
There's some weird peace that comes over

2205
01:47:22,771 --> 01:47:23,910
you.
What's agreement?

2206
01:47:23,950 --> 01:47:27,240
It's like it's a,
it's a really cool grill man.

2207
01:47:27,241 --> 01:47:29,470
And it's a fire grill so you've got to,
you know.

2208
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:30,473
So there's no,
it's not a gas grill so you have to 

2209
01:47:32,461 --> 01:47:33,294
adjust the.
There's all these wonderful dials you 

2210
01:47:35,431 --> 01:47:36,840
have to adjust to get the heat.
Right.

2211
01:47:36,841 --> 01:47:37,674
But yeah man,
like when you're sitting over an open 

2212
01:47:39,781 --> 01:47:43,660
fire cooking if feels good.
I mean I know what you mean and I.

2213
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:45,170
and it's like you,
it,

2214
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:47,130
it's like this thing like,
Oh shit,

2215
01:47:47,610 --> 01:47:52,610
I missed this feeling like this feels 
this feels as good as when I jump into a

2216
01:47:52,741 --> 01:47:55,330
swimming pool or something.
It's like elemental and so on.

2217
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:56,213
Or like a nutrient your body needs that 
you're not getting and then you eat it 

2218
01:47:58,891 --> 01:48:00,230
and your body's gone.
Please,

2219
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:01,380
thank you.
Give me more.

2220
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:02,313
It's also this link.
There's moments that people throughout 

2221
01:48:04,681 --> 01:48:05,514
history have had success hunting and 
then eating that meal over a campfire 

2222
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:12,900
and when you do that,
that is the most rewarding of all fires,

2223
01:48:13,090 --> 01:48:13,923
like I've eaten meat that we shot like 
hours before from a deer on a campfire 

2224
01:48:19,110 --> 01:48:22,020
in the middle of Montana and it was one 
of the greatest nights of my life.

2225
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:24,640
It was amazing.
Me and Bryan County,

2226
01:48:24,650 --> 01:48:26,880
Steve Right now and my friend Ryan 
Callahan,

2227
01:48:26,881 --> 01:48:27,714
a bunch of other friends were on this 
show and when we were sitting around 

2228
01:48:30,121 --> 01:48:31,170
this fire eating,
I was like,

2229
01:48:31,410 --> 01:48:34,890
I can't remember it.
More enjoyable meal because there's fire

2230
01:48:34,891 --> 01:48:35,724
and there's an animal that was just 
killed and we're cooking it and 

2231
01:48:37,501 --> 01:48:38,430
preparing it together.

2232
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:41,760
There's all this camaraderie.
There's the successful hunt aspect of it

2233
01:48:42,030 --> 01:48:42,863
and then there's this,
this primal satisfaction that you get 

2234
01:48:45,061 --> 01:48:48,930
from watching meat cook over fire and 
the warmth of the.

2235
01:48:48,990 --> 01:48:50,670
I don't know how cold it was.
Very cold.

2236
01:48:50,671 --> 01:48:51,504
There's a sense of accomplishment,
like we're comfortable because we're 

2237
01:48:53,671 --> 01:48:54,504
smart and other something.
I love sleeping in a tent when it's 

2238
01:48:56,821 --> 01:48:58,590
raining and you're like,
wow,

2239
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:03,620
like arm's length from me is miserable,
cold drizzle and I'm warm.

2240
01:49:04,261 --> 01:49:06,920
I got my candle and turn.
I got my doobies.

2241
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,150
I'm like completely happy here.
I love the sense of,

2242
01:49:10,151 --> 01:49:10,240
okay,

2243
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:12,640
accomplishment that that's another great
feeling.

2244
01:49:12,641 --> 01:49:14,410
The feeling of rain when you're safe

2245
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:17,570
side,
you're sleeping in a van even though you

2246
01:49:17,571 --> 01:49:18,830
know,
just to the sound.

2247
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:20,083
So I think,
I think this is the key to human 

2248
01:49:21,831 --> 01:49:23,720
happiness that,
that we're ignoring,

2249
01:49:23,721 --> 01:49:28,721
that our society takes all these things 
that were free and daily reality for our

2250
01:49:29,241 --> 01:49:30,074
ancestors.
Takes them away and sells back cheap 

2251
01:49:33,231 --> 01:49:37,100
copies along with antidepressants and 
antianxiety meds.

2252
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:37,993
Right.
I think that that summation of where we 

2253
01:49:40,221 --> 01:49:42,890
are,
do you think that it's possible that we,

2254
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:45,950
like you said,
are no longer human,

2255
01:49:46,090 --> 01:49:48,340
were becoming a sort of,
that this is a drawn

2256
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:52,320
out process and we're just caught up in 
the wake of it domestic.

2257
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:54,160
We're in the process of being 
domesticated.

2258
01:49:54,190 --> 01:49:54,880
Yeah,
yeah.

2259
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:55,750
Yeah.
I mean,

2260
01:49:55,751 --> 01:49:56,584
that's why I think when you look at like
the extreme progressive left movement 

2261
01:50:00,881 --> 01:50:01,714
that are just like so,
so focused on like using the correct 

2262
01:50:07,061 --> 01:50:09,850
gender,
pronouns do not offend,

2263
01:50:09,851 --> 01:50:10,684
don't use this,
what we're talking about with this 

2264
01:50:11,531 --> 01:50:13,810
Harvard placemat that they're handing 
back.

2265
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:17,800
This is like an uber domestic 
domestication thing.

2266
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:21,850
I mean it's almost like domestication.
You look at the veteran,

2267
01:50:22,090 --> 01:50:22,923
the American male,
I mean talk about getting your balls 

2268
01:50:26,111 --> 01:50:30,460
snipped man in the last 15 years.
It's become offensive to even be a man.

2269
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:34,510
It's become offensive to express a 
happiness with masculinity,

2270
01:50:34,540 --> 01:50:36,790
right?
Like to be able to be a straight.

2271
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:37,863
You can't be a term for it.
I think that if you look at what the 

2272
01:50:43,331 --> 01:50:44,164
real problem as it seems to be,
the people have mistaken language with 

2273
01:50:48,791 --> 01:50:49,624
intention.

2274
01:50:50,730 --> 01:50:54,430
So that's where the problem is.
It's that words,

2275
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:56,530
you know,
certain words.

2276
01:50:56,590 --> 01:50:57,370
I mean,
I've been,

2277
01:50:57,370 --> 01:50:59,230
I've had it happen on twitter where you 
get,

2278
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:00,333
I think I did a podcast with a opry and 
he said the female perspective and so 

2279
01:51:04,831 --> 01:51:05,664
someone on twitter gets into an argument
with me over how that you shouldn't say 

2280
01:51:09,371 --> 01:51:11,800
female perspective because that's,
and I,

2281
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:12,790
I always saying,
well look,

2282
01:51:12,850 --> 01:51:13,683
you know,
I know about the female perspective 

2283
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:18,880
because I see from it a lot because 
inside of me I've got like a lot of.

2284
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:21,310
I was,
I have a feminine side of me that,

2285
01:51:21,330 --> 01:51:22,690
so I know what that is.
It's the,

2286
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:23,883
you know,
uh,

2287
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:26,980
Carl young was telling you about the 
anima and the animus that,

2288
01:51:26,981 --> 01:51:30,460
that there's a masculine and a feminine 
inside of everybody that they're just in

2289
01:51:30,461 --> 01:51:31,181
you,
not me,

2290
01:51:31,181 --> 01:51:33,100
bro.
I know you're growing,

2291
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:34,113
you're free of it.

2292
01:51:34,130 --> 01:51:34,590
But,
but,

2293
01:51:34,590 --> 01:51:36,760
but just pay for yourself bro.
But it's that.

2294
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:37,623
It's that,
uh,

2295
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:38,170
when,
when,

2296
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:39,003
when people get caught up in the symbol 
versus what the symbol is representing 

2297
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:46,900
and,
and completely ignore the fact like,

2298
01:51:46,901 --> 01:51:49,180
think of how many different forms of 
fuck there are,

2299
01:51:49,181 --> 01:51:52,570
like the term fuck or how many different
forms of the word Shit there are.

2300
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:54,740
And all of them are intention based,
you know,

2301
01:51:54,741 --> 01:51:56,080
like that.
You could say,

2302
01:51:56,081 --> 01:51:58,180
if I say there's so many ways I could 
say fuck you to you.

2303
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:59,980
Like I'd be like,
fuck you man.

2304
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:01,240
I could be like,
Hey,

2305
01:52:01,241 --> 01:52:02,074
fuck you man,
and it's two different fuck use or you 

2306
01:52:05,171 --> 01:52:07,330
could do something awesome and I go,
dude,

2307
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:08,640
fuck you.
Yeah,

2308
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:10,720
exactly.
That works too.

2309
01:52:10,730 --> 01:52:12,370
Or exactly.
Or like,

2310
01:52:12,371 --> 01:52:12,970
man,
I'm,

2311
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:14,140
I'm gonna.
Fuck you joe.

2312
01:52:15,230 --> 01:52:20,230
But the point is there's like every 
single one of these has behind it and an

2313
01:52:21,101 --> 01:52:21,934
energy that has been encapsulated into 
the sound and that energy is all that 

2314
01:52:26,531 --> 01:52:27,364
matters to me and the fact that everyone
has been caught up in the sound itself 

2315
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:33,520
and forgotten the fact that the energy 
behind it is all that matters.

2316
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,950
That's where things are getting fucked 
up.

2317
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:36,873
Exactly what we were talking about 
earlier when we were talking about 

2318
01:52:38,261 --> 01:52:41,200
religion.
Exactly on drugs,

2319
01:52:41,540 --> 01:52:42,373
right?
We're talking about why people are 

2320
01:52:43,511 --> 01:52:45,980
addicted to drugs.
We're not talking about the emptiness

2321
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:46,813
of their lives that leads them into 
those heroin and prescription drugs and 

2322
01:52:49,731 --> 01:52:51,530
all that.
Also terrorism.

2323
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:54,140
We're talking about bombs going off and 
people getting killed.

2324
01:52:54,141 --> 01:52:54,974
We're not talking about how,
why someone's life is so empty that you 

2325
01:52:57,291 --> 01:52:59,270
put on a suicide vest in the first 
place.

2326
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:00,493
We're not.
We're looking at the surface of things 

2327
01:53:02,421 --> 01:53:04,730
and we're not interested in what's going
on behind.

2328
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:05,743
I was watching Fox News the other day 
and there was some woman who was on on 

2329
01:53:09,291 --> 01:53:10,124
and she was doing like one of those open
letter to the president things and she 

2330
01:53:12,621 --> 01:53:13,790
was doing it all.
Fox News,

2331
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:16,820
you know,
and she was saying that this country was

2332
01:53:16,821 --> 01:53:17,654
founded on Judeo Christian values and 
she was going to this thing about 

2333
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:25,940
responding and Obama's response to the 
terror attacks in Paris.

2334
01:53:26,150 --> 01:53:28,190
Not sufficiently burrowing.
Exactly.

2335
01:53:28,210 --> 01:53:28,750
Not,
not,

2336
01:53:28,750 --> 01:53:33,750
not sufficiently aggressive or didn't 
make her feel comfortable on top of it.

2337
01:53:35,630 --> 01:53:36,463
Your job is to keep me safe,
but it's just really an opportunity for 

2338
01:53:40,011 --> 01:53:43,620
her to step up and you know,
and proclaim,

2339
01:53:43,621 --> 01:53:44,454
claim her ideology to be the greatest 
ideology and this other ideology that's 

2340
01:53:48,351 --> 01:53:50,260
killing people.
Right.

2341
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:51,133
Is representatives of this ideology that
there's the enemy of this United States 

2342
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:57,680
of America,
which was founded by my call.

2343
01:53:57,710 --> 01:53:57,920
That's

2344
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:58,910
right.
That's it,

2345
01:53:58,911 --> 01:54:00,380
man.
That's interesting.

2346
01:54:00,580 --> 01:54:01,341
Yeah,
because you.

2347
01:54:01,341 --> 01:54:03,520
You realized that like that.
What's that?

2348
01:54:03,550 --> 01:54:06,440
There is a kind of war that's raging 
around this planet,

2349
01:54:06,860 --> 01:54:09,410
but it's like a war against people who 
are,

2350
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:10,693
for whatever reason,
intent on expressing anger into the 

2351
01:54:13,521 --> 01:54:14,354
world and 10 on expressing power over 
other people into the world and people 

2352
01:54:19,101 --> 01:54:21,230
who are thinking,
I think there might be another way.

2353
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:22,273
Maybe there was a way that we can 
readapt or maybe there are evolved to 

2354
01:54:26,151 --> 01:54:31,151
fit into this society or maybe there's a
whole new way where we don't have to try

2355
01:54:31,251 --> 01:54:34,490
to constantly punch back at a person who
has punched us.

2356
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:35,503
That's the war.
It's just a war between when you get 

2357
01:54:37,641 --> 01:54:38,474
fucking hit on the interstate when your 
nice car gets hit because some asshole 

2358
01:54:42,471 --> 01:54:43,304
isn't paying attention.
Do you get out and scream at him or do 

2359
01:54:45,651 --> 01:54:48,920
you ask him if he's okay and there's a 
whole group of people who think,

2360
01:54:48,921 --> 01:54:51,200
no,
you fuck that motherfucker up.

2361
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:52,183
You teach them a lesson.
Let them understand if he's not paying 

2362
01:54:54,990 --> 01:54:56,690
attention,
he's gonna get fucked up.

2363
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:00,550
You become the hand of God and the world
read,

2364
01:55:00,551 --> 01:55:02,750
you know,
bringing vengeance as much as you can.

2365
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:03,613
Or the other version of it is you try to
overcome that desire and you become a 

2366
01:55:08,031 --> 01:55:11,690
servant of some concept,
which is that the most important thing.

2367
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:13,400
Even if we've lost everything,
man,

2368
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:16,280
even if we become locust and that's all 
gone and you know,

2369
01:55:16,281 --> 01:55:17,390
the more you talk about it,
man,

2370
01:55:17,391 --> 01:55:20,360
the more I do know what you mean.
Earlier I was like,

2371
01:55:20,361 --> 01:55:21,141
ah,
my low kids,

2372
01:55:21,141 --> 01:55:21,974
but I do hear what you're saying.
I think it's very sweet and actually 

2373
01:55:23,781 --> 01:55:26,690
kind of tragic and sad,
but if this is the case,

2374
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:31,930
then we still have to figure out a way 
to like even now as much as possible put

2375
01:55:33,141 --> 01:55:37,190
out into the world love and it doesn't 
matter what language we're using,

2376
01:55:37,191 --> 01:55:40,250
if love is behind it,
I think that's the highest thing.

2377
01:55:40,251 --> 01:55:41,084
By the way,
I think that's all that matters is like 

2378
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:44,010
that meal was good because

2379
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:44,843
you were with people you love.
If you are sitting after that hunt with 

2380
01:55:47,281 --> 01:55:49,980
a bunch of people that you disliked or 
assholes,

2381
01:55:50,190 --> 01:55:52,830
I bet it wouldn't have been as delicious
as of a meal.

2382
01:55:52,890 --> 01:55:53,723
Yeah,
but here's the problem with that 

2383
01:55:54,001 --> 01:55:55,320
thought,
it wouldn't have been as good.

2384
01:55:55,321 --> 01:55:56,154
We had several meals behind the campfire
where we didn't kill anything there 

2385
01:55:59,021 --> 01:55:59,854
wasn't as good,

2386
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:02,060
but.
And also you're in a love.

2387
01:56:02,590 --> 01:56:06,570
You're a love supporting environment 
that you're working together,

2388
01:56:06,571 --> 01:56:07,404
you're in nature,
you're around a fire and you're 

2389
01:56:09,361 --> 01:56:10,890
successful at something that's 
difficult.

2390
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:13,260
All those things.
Even if they were assholes,

2391
01:56:13,261 --> 01:56:15,450
you'd probably find more common ground 
with them there.

2392
01:56:15,451 --> 01:56:17,340
Then you would sit around a conference 
table.

2393
01:56:17,410 --> 01:56:18,243
Yeah.

2394
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:19,770
Well,
it's definitely a,

2395
01:56:20,410 --> 01:56:24,550
there's also a separation from society.
Complete total separation.

2396
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:27,010
When you're up there,
there's no cell phone signal.

2397
01:56:27,011 --> 01:56:29,080
You don't hear anything.
It's complete silence.

2398
01:56:29,081 --> 01:56:29,914
It's a very strange feeling of almost a 
lonely detachment because you realize 

2399
01:56:34,361 --> 01:56:36,430
you are not,
you're not just off the grid.

2400
01:56:36,730 --> 01:56:39,370
The grid is nowhere to be seen and we 
need each other.

2401
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:40,240
Yeah.
You need each other.

2402
01:56:40,270 --> 01:56:41,103
Yeah.
You got it.

2403
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:42,020
I think that's right

2404
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:42,853
where we come from.
We come from this place where we need 

2405
01:56:44,751 --> 01:56:45,584
each other.
And where were the first thing you 

2406
01:56:46,911 --> 01:56:47,780
think,
you know,

2407
01:56:47,781 --> 01:56:49,160
like hunter gatherers,
they,

2408
01:56:49,161 --> 01:56:52,610
uh,
they share arrows and so like,

2409
01:56:53,060 --> 01:56:54,780
yeah,
they typically share Arrow.

2410
01:56:54,781 --> 01:56:57,110
So I make arrows a certain way.
You make them another way,

2411
01:56:57,111 --> 01:56:59,180
whatever,
but then we all give them to each other.

2412
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:02,660
They're constantly flowing.
So you might be on a hunt where you shot

2413
01:57:02,661 --> 01:57:06,050
the elk,
that Arrow that you shot is in the elk,

2414
01:57:06,051 --> 01:57:11,051
but I made it and it's a way of 
obscuring who gets credit for the kill.

2415
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:12,013
And that's cool.
And you find this universally among 

2416
01:57:14,421 --> 01:57:15,254
foragers,
whether it's in the internet or in Papa 

2417
01:57:17,451 --> 01:57:18,650
New Guinea.
They do these,

2418
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:23,660
they have these mechanisms to make sure 
that the sharing happens not only of the

2419
01:57:23,661 --> 01:57:27,680
meat but of the reputational aspect.
That's interesting.

2420
01:57:27,681 --> 01:57:28,514
Everybody's cool.
There are all these mechanisms built in 

2421
01:57:30,741 --> 01:57:33,740
to keep anybody from getting too big for
their Britches,

2422
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:36,560
you know,
till the cannibals move in and then they

2423
01:57:36,561 --> 01:57:37,140
start killing

2424
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:41,040
people and eating them because there's 
no protein because they couldn't get any

2425
01:57:41,041 --> 01:57:41,874
elk.
It's a problem that cannabis will move 

2426
01:57:45,511 --> 01:57:46,250
in

2427
01:57:46,250 --> 01:57:47,540
fuckers.
You got to be ready.

2428
01:57:47,650 --> 01:57:50,000
But here's the good news about the 
locus.

2429
01:57:50,150 --> 01:57:52,020
They do switch bank,
take grass offers.

2430
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:54,380
You can be aggressive.
Stops.

2431
01:57:54,410 --> 01:57:55,730
Yeah.
Eventually.

2432
01:57:55,820 --> 01:57:57,440
And then you can't fly anymore.
You fuck.

2433
01:57:57,530 --> 01:57:58,363
And Lucas are cannibalistic and 
grasshoppers aren't to tie it into the 

2434
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:04,010
whole cannibalism.
Yeah.

2435
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:06,040
That's why they swarm because if you 
slow down,

2436
01:58:06,050 --> 01:58:07,190
the one behind you will eat you.

2437
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:12,070
Oh my God.
That's where we are working at Amazon.

2438
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:15,950
That's what it's like working in New 
York City working on Amazon.

2439
01:58:15,951 --> 01:58:16,840
Supposed to be crazy.
Right?

2440
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:20,200
There's warehouses they'll run around 
this time when you have a timer.

2441
01:58:20,201 --> 01:58:21,310
Have you ever.
There was a,

2442
01:58:21,610 --> 01:58:22,443
I think it was a radiolab podcast,
was one of the podcasts I listened to 

2443
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:29,540
that talked to an ex employee at Amazon 
about what kind of stress it is to work.

2444
01:58:29,570 --> 01:58:30,403
Like say if you order something,
like say if you order a led flashlight 

2445
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:35,590
and it,
it shows up on their.

2446
01:58:35,591 --> 01:58:37,900
They have like a little pad,
like a,

2447
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:42,010
a tablet device and it has a timer and 
it's like you have to

2448
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:42,843
go find this and you have to grab it and
you have like 30 seconds so you like 

2449
01:58:46,450 --> 01:58:48,790
literally running,
looking for this flashlight and you have

2450
01:58:48,791 --> 01:58:52,930
to get it to the sorting and put it in 
the box and get the label.

2451
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:55,043
They had this terrible game show.
There was a show like that when I was a 

2452
01:59:00,941 --> 01:59:04,000
kid when we had to run the money maze or
something like that.

2453
01:59:04,001 --> 01:59:04,834
I remember that you had to fill your car
up with the most expensive things or 

2454
01:59:07,271 --> 01:59:09,100
something and know this is a different 
one.

2455
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:09,963
This is where you got like couples and 
you got the the like the wives up on a 

2456
01:59:14,021 --> 01:59:14,854
platform and the two husbands down and 
there's a maze like where the walls 

2457
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:18,573
seven feet high and the women can see 
where the money is and they're yelling 

2458
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:23,490
to their husbands like rats and like,
no,

2459
01:59:23,510 --> 01:59:24,343
go left.

2460
01:59:24,970 --> 01:59:29,320
I said left that and the husbands are 
scurrying around in the maze and whoever

2461
01:59:29,321 --> 01:59:33,130
gets to the money pot first wins.
It's a good divorce generating game show

2462
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:36,940
like so many of them.
What do you think,

2463
01:59:36,941 --> 01:59:38,200
man?
Do you think it's hopeless?

2464
01:59:38,201 --> 01:59:42,730
This you like when you talk about it and
you talk about it and then I think about

2465
01:59:42,731 --> 01:59:44,410
it,
it's like,

2466
01:59:44,411 --> 01:59:48,920
so it fills you this as a kind of like 
weirdness Dahlia.

2467
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:49,773
Like you think my God,
this there's a type of life that is 

2468
01:59:53,410 --> 01:59:54,243
clearly still accessible to people but 
maybe not accessible to everyone as a 

2469
01:59:57,881 --> 01:59:58,714
whole.
Do you have any idea of like how you 

2470
02:00:01,571 --> 02:00:05,620
would reorganize or restructure?
What I say in the book is,

2471
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:07,930
is where there's no way we're going 
back.

2472
02:00:08,470 --> 02:00:09,340
That's over,
right?

2473
02:00:09,341 --> 02:00:10,174
Because there's 7 billion.
They're going to be 10 billion in 100 

2474
02:00:12,131 --> 02:00:13,120
years.
There's no way.

2475
02:00:13,121 --> 02:00:15,370
There's not enough land or animals or 
whatever,

2476
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:18,100
so we're going to live in an artificial 
environment,

2477
02:00:18,101 --> 02:00:20,080
but you know you're going to live in a 
zoo.

2478
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:22,600
Do you want to live in the Calcutta zoo 
or the San Diego zoo?

2479
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:23,741
Right?
I mean,

2480
02:00:23,741 --> 02:00:25,060
come on.
The San Diego Zoo.

2481
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:25,953
It's built with an understanding of the 
natural environment of the animals that 

2482
02:00:29,771 --> 02:00:30,604
are enclosed there.
So I want to live in a natural 

2483
02:00:32,171 --> 02:00:35,350
environment that's got my interest in 
mind and in order to do that,

2484
02:00:35,351 --> 02:00:38,200
you have to understand what kind of 
animal homo sapiens is,

2485
02:00:38,530 --> 02:00:39,363
which means you have to cut through a 
lot of the bullshit propaganda that 

2486
02:00:41,621 --> 02:00:42,454
you've been here in your whole life.
This hobbs and bullshit about how 

2487
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:47,290
prehistoric people all died in their 
thirties.

2488
02:00:47,291 --> 02:00:50,980
And it was a struggle for survival and 
predators lurked in every shadow.

2489
02:00:50,981 --> 02:00:52,600
And it was this terrible,
you know,

2490
02:00:52,601 --> 02:00:55,810
dangerous world.
You actually look at the anthropological

2491
02:00:55,811 --> 02:00:57,760
data.
Hunter gatherers are chilled out,

2492
02:00:57,761 --> 02:00:58,594
happy,
relaxed people who are not dealing with 

2493
02:01:00,791 --> 02:01:01,624
the sorts of chronic stress we are.
And you hear all these bullshit 

2494
02:01:03,851 --> 02:01:04,684
arguments that wouldn't last a second if
they weren't propping up the 

2495
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:10,633
civilizational edifice like that.
Everyone died in their thirties and 

2496
02:01:14,270 --> 02:01:16,780
hunter gathers.
That's absolutely untrue.

2497
02:01:17,290 --> 02:01:18,123
But I just heard the dean of the Medical
School of Columbia University say it in 

2498
02:01:21,661 --> 02:01:23,210
an NPR interview.
It's,

2499
02:01:23,430 --> 02:01:24,263
it's everywhere.
Not The worst thing to happen to die 

2500
02:01:26,891 --> 02:01:27,671
young.
Well,

2501
02:01:27,671 --> 02:01:30,040
there's certainly some benefits to 
modern medicine.

2502
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:31,430
One hundred percent,
but there's,

2503
02:01:31,630 --> 02:01:36,370
there's also some negative consequences 
of our overly complicated society.

2504
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:38,330
There's no doubt about it.
I mean the,

2505
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:40,430
the levels of depression that people 
experienced

2506
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:42,740
in the levels of discontent with their 
existence.

2507
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:44,053
You know,
we were talking yesterday about people 

2508
02:01:46,131 --> 02:01:48,620
wanting to take a chance to go do 
something.

2509
02:01:48,621 --> 02:01:51,560
They want to do something outside of 
what they're doing for a job.

2510
02:01:51,561 --> 02:01:52,394
Like maybe they have,
maybe they like making pottery or 

2511
02:01:54,411 --> 02:01:56,210
whatever it is,
but they just don't have the time.

2512
02:01:56,211 --> 02:01:57,044
Maybe they want to be a tattooist.
They just don't have the time to 

2513
02:01:59,361 --> 02:02:00,194
dedicate to jump into it.
And then along the way get saddled with 

2514
02:02:02,691 --> 02:02:05,750
debt and maybe a family that you have an
obligation to feed.

2515
02:02:05,751 --> 02:02:08,750
And then you're stuck in your trap.
That trap that,

2516
02:02:08,860 --> 02:02:12,500
that feeling of discontent with one's 
own daily existence.

2517
02:02:12,501 --> 02:02:15,410
You Day by day life is more commonplace 
than not.

2518
02:02:15,620 --> 02:02:18,380
It's way more common.
It's essential because we were saying to

2519
02:02:18,381 --> 02:02:19,214
keep you running on the wheel,
you got to believe x is going to make 

2520
02:02:21,981 --> 02:02:22,430
you happy.

2521
02:02:22,430 --> 02:02:25,130
The cars going to,
the next thing is going to do it.

2522
02:02:25,790 --> 02:02:28,120
That's.
And that's a pernicious lie that,

2523
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:31,130
that we've heard so many times we come 
to believe it's an,

2524
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:34,880
it's an aspect of reality itself.
And it isn't.

2525
02:02:35,350 --> 02:02:36,260
And that's,
that's,

2526
02:02:36,261 --> 02:02:38,390
you know,
if you look at the hunter gather data,

2527
02:02:38,391 --> 02:02:40,730
what you see is,
is these people who,

2528
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:42,320
I mean you were talking about it 
earlier,

2529
02:02:42,321 --> 02:02:46,130
how we need something to like a 
challenge to take us to the next level.

2530
02:02:46,790 --> 02:02:47,623
For them,
the challenge is like we're going to go 

2531
02:02:49,131 --> 02:02:50,240
hunting,
you know,

2532
02:02:50,241 --> 02:02:51,074
and it'll feel great and,
and we'll eat and if we don't eat they 

2533
02:02:53,991 --> 02:02:56,630
will eat tomorrow.
Well that's why those subsistence shows.

2534
02:02:56,631 --> 02:02:59,570
Have you ever watched those shows and 
discovery channel shows?

2535
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:00,613
Those shows are extremely popular today 
because people are sort of recognizing 

2536
02:03:03,921 --> 02:03:04,880
that like,
wow,

2537
02:03:05,300 --> 02:03:08,210
these people seem happy and all they 
have is like five dogs.

2538
02:03:08,210 --> 02:03:09,043
They live in Alaska and they just take 
their sled out and they chopped down a 

2539
02:03:11,811 --> 02:03:16,760
fucking tree to build a house with like 
these people are living on the stamina.

2540
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:20,540
That's the thing is immediacy.
Just to play devil's advocate here,

2541
02:03:20,541 --> 02:03:23,550
isn't this a different version of what 
you're talking about?

2542
02:03:23,551 --> 02:03:26,000
The modern human thinks,
if I have this thing,

2543
02:03:26,001 --> 02:03:28,670
a car or whatever the thing is,
the nicer job,

2544
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:30,410
better or whatever,
I'll be happy.

2545
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:34,940
What you're saying is if I have an 
immediacy,

2546
02:03:34,941 --> 02:03:37,610
if I'm more connected to nature,
if I moved to Alaska,

2547
02:03:37,611 --> 02:03:39,860
if I become a hunter,
I'll be happy,

2548
02:03:39,861 --> 02:03:40,694
but both of these things have within 
them the idea that I need some other 

2549
02:03:45,561 --> 02:03:50,510
thing to be happy.
Whereas the what I keep hearing and what

2550
02:03:50,511 --> 02:03:55,511
I subscribed to you is that to be happy,
you have to be in the present moment.

2551
02:03:55,881 --> 02:03:57,980
Wherever you are,
whatever situation you're in,

2552
02:03:57,981 --> 02:03:58,814
whatever's going on,
whether you're in an office and a job 

2553
02:04:01,281 --> 02:04:04,730
you don't like in a marriage you don't 
like with a bunch of kids that you don't

2554
02:04:04,731 --> 02:04:05,390
like.

2555
02:04:05,390 --> 02:04:10,390
Instead of fleeing from that by planning
some fantasy of becoming a tattoo artist

2556
02:04:11,181 --> 02:04:12,014
or a potter,
they're real way out is to allow 

2557
02:04:14,661 --> 02:04:15,494
yourself to be fully in the experience 
of what's happening right now and not 

2558
02:04:20,450 --> 02:04:21,283
that thing itself.
Just doing that and maybe that is what 

2559
02:04:23,661 --> 02:04:26,250
happens when you're in nature as you are
more in the present moment,

2560
02:04:26,251 --> 02:04:27,084
but that makes way more sense when 
you're in nature because if you're 

2561
02:04:29,391 --> 02:04:30,224
working in an insurance company and you 
just go on over client's claims day in 

2562
02:04:33,141 --> 02:04:33,974
and day out,
it's super hard to be in a joyful 

2563
02:04:35,391 --> 02:04:36,224
moment.
It's super hard to be when you really 

2564
02:04:37,801 --> 02:04:38,010
want

2565
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:42,400
to get out of there and make music like 
you have songs and ideas in your head.

2566
02:04:42,401 --> 02:04:46,020
Do you want to put them to wax,
but your fucking kids need formula?

2567
02:04:46,060 --> 02:04:46,560
Well,
it's not.

2568
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:47,393
It's not.
Jus.

2569
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:50,100
The thing is it's like that.
The idea is,

2570
02:04:50,250 --> 02:04:51,930
sure,
for sure,

2571
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:54,840
but this is where you're at right now.
That's it,

2572
02:04:54,870 --> 02:04:55,860
right?
That's where you are.

2573
02:04:55,890 --> 02:04:56,723
You're not at a situation where you're 
going to start a band and you're not in 

2574
02:04:58,891 --> 02:04:59,724
a situation where you're going to become
a potter right now could be in the 

2575
02:05:01,981 --> 02:05:04,830
future,
but the trick is that even though you're

2576
02:05:04,831 --> 02:05:09,720
not in the fucking Anna rondex hunting 
and you're not fishing,

2577
02:05:09,870 --> 02:05:12,180
even though you're wherever you're at 
right now,

2578
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:14,820
get into that place.
Let Yourself,

2579
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,610
and it's not about happiness,
it's certainly not about joy or bliss or

2580
02:05:17,611 --> 02:05:19,980
anything like that.
You're not feeling joy and bliss.

2581
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:20,813
You're feeling a kind of claustrophobic 
horror at the concept that what the 

2582
02:05:25,381 --> 02:05:26,214
situation you're in right now is going 
to continue forever and so your mind is 

2583
02:05:29,701 --> 02:05:33,270
fabricated and escape route,
which is this thing or that thing,

2584
02:05:33,271 --> 02:05:35,310
whatever it may be,
but the true,

2585
02:05:36,330 --> 02:05:37,163
the true situation is that until you 
train yourself to be in the present 

2586
02:05:41,341 --> 02:05:44,100
moment,
it doesn't matter where you are,

2587
02:05:44,370 --> 02:05:46,770
you're dead.
You're not alive,

2588
02:05:46,771 --> 02:05:47,630
you're not.
It doesn't matter.

2589
02:05:47,820 --> 02:05:49,530
You have to train yourself to get in the
moment.

2590
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:53,310
Then once you're in the moment,
then start making the move.

2591
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:54,173
Okay.
Now you say in the moment like how do 

2592
02:05:55,441 --> 02:05:56,770
you address that?
Like what?

2593
02:05:56,790 --> 02:05:59,010
When you're thinking about you being in 
the moment,

2594
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:01,050
like your own personal experience,
what do,

2595
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:05,010
what do you do to try to achieve that 
sort of centered feeling?

2596
02:06:05,070 --> 02:06:05,640
Well,
it's,

2597
02:06:05,640 --> 02:06:08,160
well,
it's the practice of mindfulness.

2598
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:10,340
So it's the idea of,
you know,

2599
02:06:10,370 --> 02:06:15,370
what it's,
I will notice from time to time when I'm

2600
02:06:15,571 --> 02:06:16,404
lucky that I've been carried away by my 
thoughts like that fucking thing you 

2601
02:06:19,271 --> 02:06:21,900
were saying about laying in bed.
You can generate more stress chemicals.

2602
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:24,600
I'll recognize like,
Holy Shit,

2603
02:06:24,630 --> 02:06:29,630
I've been in a vortex of thinking for 
the last two days.

2604
02:06:29,641 --> 02:06:34,641
I've been caught in this like endless 
recurring series of worries or scenarios

2605
02:06:35,731 --> 02:06:38,910
or whatever it may be or things I need 
to do or things I uh,

2606
02:06:38,911 --> 02:06:40,420
I just did.
And,

2607
02:06:40,530 --> 02:06:45,150
and suddenly I realized I haven't been 
here at all at all.

2608
02:06:45,151 --> 02:06:47,160
I've just been caught up in what's 
called in your head.

2609
02:06:47,161 --> 02:06:49,860
You're caught up in the thought pattern.
So the,

2610
02:06:49,861 --> 02:06:51,410
uh,
the practice is,

2611
02:06:51,990 --> 02:06:53,880
uh,
and this is something like,

2612
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:54,773
you know,
uh,

2613
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:55,913
uh,
Jack Kornfield talks about how the Guy 

2614
02:06:56,941 --> 02:06:59,460
who taught in meditation,
Adrienne Shaw,

2615
02:06:59,790 --> 02:07:01,090
uh,
uh,

2616
02:07:01,290 --> 02:07:05,790
was saying to him that I'm,
one of his students was saying,

2617
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:07,980
I'm too busy to meditate.

2618
02:07:08,590 --> 02:07:10,380
I'm too busy to Metadata,
have time to do that.

2619
02:07:10,381 --> 02:07:13,020
And his response was our youtube busy to
breathe.

2620
02:07:13,330 --> 02:07:15,030
Are you too busy to breathe?
You can breathe,

2621
02:07:15,031 --> 02:07:17,160
right?
That's all you need to do.

2622
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:20,160
All you need is your breath.
And no matter where you are,

2623
02:07:20,161 --> 02:07:21,510
what you're doing,
where you're at,

2624
02:07:21,870 --> 02:07:22,703
you can begin to put your attention away
from the incredible array of worries 

2625
02:07:27,601 --> 02:07:28,434
that you have incredible array of 
fantasies that you have incredible 

2626
02:07:30,631 --> 02:07:32,250
arrays of.
If this had happened,

2627
02:07:32,251 --> 02:07:33,084
I'd be happier if I could do this,
I'll be a better person and just bring 

2628
02:07:36,881 --> 02:07:40,570
it to your breath in and out and through
the nose,

2629
02:07:40,571 --> 02:07:41,404
out through the nose.
And then it's not going to stop these 

2630
02:07:43,391 --> 02:07:44,224
fucking thoughts,
but instead of you being controlled by 

2631
02:07:46,841 --> 02:07:48,600
them and caught up in them,
I mean,

2632
02:07:48,601 --> 02:07:50,320
you talk about looking at your fucking 
cell phone.

2633
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:52,000
Get rid of cell phones.

2634
02:07:52,150 --> 02:07:52,983
People are still looking at cell phones.
It's just their various worries and 

2635
02:07:55,690 --> 02:07:57,730
things that they're constantly 
ruminating over.

2636
02:07:57,940 --> 02:07:58,773
It's another form of the cell phone.
You're fixating on these endless 

2637
02:08:01,601 --> 02:08:04,840
recurring worries,
so you bring it to the breath,

2638
02:08:05,140 --> 02:08:07,810
the worries emerge,
the happiness,

2639
02:08:07,811 --> 02:08:11,440
whatever it is is there,
but it's not you.

2640
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:16,480
You're not identifying with it anymore.
You're not identifying with the specific

2641
02:08:16,660 --> 02:08:17,493
emotional state,
this specific intellectual state the 

2642
02:08:20,481 --> 02:08:21,314
specific thing anymore.
You're just observing and watching and 

2643
02:08:24,311 --> 02:08:26,500
that thing,
that consciousness,

2644
02:08:26,650 --> 02:08:27,483
the more you become that,
the more you will find yourself 

2645
02:08:29,351 --> 02:08:31,360
experiencing what you were talking 
about.

2646
02:08:31,630 --> 02:08:34,810
These rare moments of peace,
these moments of like,

2647
02:08:34,811 --> 02:08:36,070
Whoa,
Holy Shit,

2648
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:38,500
regardless of what's happening around 
me,

2649
02:08:39,010 --> 02:08:43,030
I'm still centered,
untouched,

2650
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:46,030
unfreaking,
unanxious.

2651
02:08:46,090 --> 02:08:48,160
I'm just watching.
So that's the,

2652
02:08:48,430 --> 02:08:49,061
that's the,
uh,

2653
02:08:49,061 --> 02:08:49,894
the concept.
And it's a very hopeful concept because 

2654
02:08:52,271 --> 02:08:53,104
some people do not have access to the 
kind of zoo you're talking about 

2655
02:08:56,620 --> 02:08:58,000
prisoners,
for example,

2656
02:08:58,180 --> 02:08:59,013
people who are incarcerated right now,
they don't get to get out of that 

2657
02:09:01,511 --> 02:09:02,230
system.

2658
02:09:02,230 --> 02:09:03,063
So they have to find a way in the midst 
of all of that negative phenomena to 

2659
02:09:07,151 --> 02:09:07,984
allow themselves to experience the same 
kind of peace or tranquility that you 

2660
02:09:10,981 --> 02:09:14,590
were experiencing with your friends in 
front of that Campfire,

2661
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:18,700
and that is why the concept of 
cultivation is so important in Buddhism,

2662
02:09:18,701 --> 02:09:19,534
which is the idea that these experiences
which in various many different world 

2663
02:09:24,380 --> 02:09:26,170
religions say it,
their route,

2664
02:09:26,171 --> 02:09:30,280
what is so wonderful about them is love 
that feeling of love,

2665
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:33,430
which is also compared to the feeling of
coming home,

2666
02:09:33,790 --> 02:09:36,070
being at home,
finding your home,

2667
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:39,100
coming back home.
It's all the same because the feeling of

2668
02:09:39,101 --> 02:09:39,934
what is the feeling of being at home.
It's a feeling of being at what did you 

2669
02:09:42,221 --> 02:09:44,260
call it,
a situation of acceptance and love.

2670
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:45,393
It's that feeling of being sick,
truly safe or not safe because of the 

2671
02:09:48,101 --> 02:09:48,934
government,
but safe because you're surrounded by 

2672
02:09:50,561 --> 02:09:51,394
people who love you and you're loving 
them and you know that you can be taken 

2673
02:09:54,191 --> 02:09:54,790
care of.

2674
02:09:54,790 --> 02:09:55,623
The concept is that feeling can be 
cultivated in that cultivation starts 

2675
02:09:59,531 --> 02:10:04,150
with some form of the practice of 
mindfulness or whatever you want to call

2676
02:10:04,151 --> 02:10:04,984
it.
I think what you're saying actually 

2677
02:10:06,910 --> 02:10:09,610
isn't in conflict at all with the the 
other point,

2678
02:10:09,611 --> 02:10:10,444
you know,
the because the mindfulness being here 

2679
02:10:12,131 --> 02:10:16,840
in the moment.
I think if you're like,

2680
02:10:16,841 --> 02:10:17,674
if you've got a shitty job in a cubicle 
and you're trying to distract yourself 

2681
02:10:21,431 --> 02:10:22,264
from it,
you're listening to podcasts all day 

2682
02:10:23,141 --> 02:10:25,120
while you shuffle paperwork or whatever,
right?

2683
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:26,433
Um,
and you're not really being in the 

2684
02:10:28,121 --> 02:10:28,954
moment.
It is advantageous to be in the moment 

2685
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:34,070
if it allows you to see

2686
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:39,080
that the moment is fucking killing you 
and then you make a realistic.

2687
02:10:39,081 --> 02:10:40,340
You're not going to be a hunter 
gatherer,

2688
02:10:40,341 --> 02:10:43,490
but you make a realistic plan to change 
your life.

2689
02:10:44,900 --> 02:10:46,700
It can be abused,
right?

2690
02:10:46,701 --> 02:10:47,600
I mean,
if you're in prison,

2691
02:10:47,601 --> 02:10:50,000
that's a different deal.
You're going to be there for 10 years.

2692
02:10:50,001 --> 02:10:52,760
You're not gonna like don't try to 
escape is my advice,

2693
02:10:53,150 --> 02:10:55,490
but if,
but if it's just a dead end job,

2694
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:56,753
I mean I got this great email a couple 
days ago from someone who I had these 

2695
02:10:59,631 --> 02:11:00,850
guys on who,
uh,

2696
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:02,850
live in camper vans.
Several,

2697
02:11:02,990 --> 02:11:04,850
one guy,
one guy,

2698
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:05,780
funny guy,
he,

2699
02:11:05,781 --> 02:11:06,614
uh,
worked in a tiger sanctuary in Thailand 

2700
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:12,230
teaching baby tigers not to eat people.
Essentially.

2701
02:11:12,231 --> 02:11:13,064
He was like the Guinea pig.
It would go in and play with the baby 

2702
02:11:15,111 --> 02:11:17,840
tigers to teach them like,
don't eat people.

2703
02:11:17,841 --> 02:11:19,640
People are cool.
Anyway,

2704
02:11:19,641 --> 02:11:20,474
he flew to Chile,
bought a VW Camper van and drove from 

2705
02:11:23,091 --> 02:11:23,924
Chile to Alaska in this camper van and 
just picked up people along the way and 

2706
02:11:27,550 --> 02:11:29,480
you know,
had all these adventures for years.

2707
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:30,740
I think he said,
wow.

2708
02:11:30,860 --> 02:11:32,090
Anyway,
years of driving.

2709
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:33,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

2710
02:11:33,190 --> 02:11:34,420
I mean off and on,
you know,

2711
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:35,600
it would break down.
I think he,

2712
02:11:35,690 --> 02:11:36,523
he swapped out the engine five times or 
something cause vw vans and known for 

2713
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:42,180
reliability.
Anyway,

2714
02:11:42,181 --> 02:11:45,440
so somebody who listened to this series 
of podcast I did with people who live in

2715
02:11:45,441 --> 02:11:47,600
their vans,
some guy's like,

2716
02:11:47,601 --> 02:11:48,460
yeah,
I quit my job.

2717
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:49,303
My wife and I bought a van.
We'd been in it six months and it's 

2718
02:11:50,931 --> 02:11:52,520
fucking awesome.
You know,

2719
02:11:52,521 --> 02:11:54,350
it's like he completely changed his 
life.

2720
02:11:54,351 --> 02:11:56,380
He's and he's thrilled.
I love to hear,

2721
02:11:56,390 --> 02:11:57,223
if you live in a shitty situation like 
that long enough for the job you hate 

2722
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:02,413
and bills that don't make any sense and 
for stuff that you don't even want or 

2723
02:12:05,331 --> 02:12:06,164
enjoy anymore than that idea of getting 
in that camper and just driving across 

2724
02:12:09,501 --> 02:12:10,790
the country seems amazing.

2725
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:13,940
It seems like freedom and it's doable.
It's doable if you're.

2726
02:12:13,941 --> 02:12:16,520
If you're willing to give up a lot of 
the bullshit,

2727
02:12:16,850 --> 02:12:18,020
you know?
That's right.

2728
02:12:18,021 --> 02:12:19,010
Yeah.
That's the thing,

2729
02:12:19,011 --> 02:12:20,690
man.
My friend Steve Maxwell,

2730
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:24,470
he doesn't even have a camper.
He just lives in hotels.

2731
02:12:24,471 --> 02:12:27,170
He has a bag for all of his belongings.
He's a pro.

2732
02:12:27,290 --> 02:12:29,810
He's a personal trainer and he's like 
world renowned.

2733
02:12:29,811 --> 02:12:30,644
He puts on these camps and seminars and 
stuff like that and him and his 

2734
02:12:32,541 --> 02:12:34,790
girlfriend,
they travel all over the world.

2735
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:36,740
Constant travel,
that's all they do.

2736
02:12:36,741 --> 02:12:37,574
They stay from hotel to hotel and he 
trains people everywhere and he used to 

2737
02:12:40,701 --> 02:12:41,534
have a big gym and he used to have a 
house and then he went from the big 

2738
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:45,170
German house,
get divorced.

2739
02:12:45,171 --> 02:12:47,990
He got like a camper van,
like with a like a,

2740
02:12:48,090 --> 02:12:50,090
like you're sleeping.
It got sick of that,

2741
02:12:50,150 --> 02:12:51,710
sold that fucking things that,
you know what?

2742
02:12:51,930 --> 02:12:54,440
I'm just going to get everything down to
a 10 gallon bag.

2743
02:12:54,950 --> 02:12:57,890
He's got a 10 gallon bag with all his 
worldly possessions and that's it.

2744
02:12:57,950 --> 02:12:59,750
Yeah.
Digital nomads,

2745
02:12:59,810 --> 02:13:02,270
you know about them.
There's a growing,

2746
02:13:02,271 --> 02:13:03,104
thriving world of young people who have 
jobs where they do stuff on the 

2747
02:13:06,591 --> 02:13:07,251
Internet,
right?

2748
02:13:07,251 --> 02:13:09,470
They either coding or editing or 
whatever.

2749
02:13:09,790 --> 02:13:11,240
Something you can do through the 
computer.

2750
02:13:11,690 --> 02:13:14,150
So if you're making money through the 
computer,

2751
02:13:14,151 --> 02:13:16,430
why he living in la where you're paying 
two grand,

2752
02:13:16,431 --> 02:13:17,280
three grand for,
you know.

2753
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:20,240
So they moved to places like Bangkok,
Ecuador,

2754
02:13:20,241 --> 02:13:21,074
there,
there's like hotspots around the world 

2755
02:13:22,371 --> 02:13:25,550
where there are thousands of these 
people living out of backpacks,

2756
02:13:25,551 --> 02:13:26,384
they live in guest houses and they work 
in cafes or wherever they get Wifi and 

2757
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:31,920
that's what they're doing.
And it's a

2758
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:34,590
funny thing because they're ahead of the
laws,

2759
02:13:34,591 --> 02:13:35,424
right?
So tax laws don't know what to do with 

2760
02:13:36,271 --> 02:13:40,260
these people because you don't,
you're not stable anywhere.

2761
02:13:40,261 --> 02:13:42,300
And the laws are all set up where you 
pay tax,

2762
02:13:42,301 --> 02:13:45,570
where you are.
Well I'm three months in Bangkok,

2763
02:13:45,571 --> 02:13:47,670
then I'm off to Chile.
Then I'm off here like,

2764
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:49,170
well who do I pay tax too?

2765
02:13:49,610 --> 02:13:50,443
I'll take it to the next level.
What if you switched everything to 

2766
02:13:51,891 --> 02:13:52,724
digital currency and finding more and 
more people are accepting bitcoin and 

2767
02:13:55,671 --> 02:13:56,504
other forms of digital currency.
So they start using that to pay for the 

2768
02:13:58,561 --> 02:13:59,960
rent,
pay for their food,

2769
02:13:59,961 --> 02:14:01,820
pay for their drinks,
pay for their travel,

2770
02:14:01,850 --> 02:14:03,830
no record of animal,
what the fuck.

2771
02:14:04,490 --> 02:14:06,380
And then they live in Thailand 
sometimes.

2772
02:14:06,381 --> 02:14:07,700
Yeah,
sometimes they don't.

2773
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:10,353
Wild Man.
And so it should be the idea of you 

2774
02:14:12,381 --> 02:14:13,214
being constrained to a patch of dirt and
you have to have a piece of paper to 

2775
02:14:16,671 --> 02:14:19,850
show other people and the other patch of
dirt so I can cross over.

2776
02:14:20,030 --> 02:14:22,430
Can I enter into your kingdom?
Depends.

2777
02:14:22,490 --> 02:14:27,350
Did you at one point in time drive your 
carriage under the influence of wine,

2778
02:14:29,010 --> 02:14:29,843
but I was in the call was denied entry 
into my kingdom of doubt of you're in a 

2779
02:14:37,221 --> 02:14:40,190
car with someone and they're drunk and 
you're sober and you get pulled over.

2780
02:14:40,190 --> 02:14:41,810
You're going to get a Dui.
If you get that.

2781
02:14:41,910 --> 02:14:42,743
Yes.
If that person's drunk and you're an 

2782
02:14:44,421 --> 02:14:46,730
adult and you're sober and that person's
drunk driving,

2783
02:14:46,731 --> 02:14:47,564
you can get a dui to try.
You can get in trouble for allowing 

2784
02:14:50,661 --> 02:14:53,550
someone to drive a car.
I don't know what exact for polk.

2785
02:14:53,690 --> 02:14:58,130
Find out what exactly the law is.
How the fuck would you mainly similar.

2786
02:14:58,380 --> 02:15:00,000
It's extremely similar,
if you will.

2787
02:15:00,170 --> 02:15:03,020
I believe in.
It might be a state to state basis or am

2788
02:15:03,021 --> 02:15:04,910
I just made it up,
but I'm pretty sure it's true.

2789
02:15:05,180 --> 02:15:06,470
If you are drunk,

2790
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:08,110
I made it up.
I really,

2791
02:15:08,900 --> 02:15:09,733
if you,
if you are drunk and you have a 

2792
02:15:10,511 --> 02:15:11,344
passenger in your car,
that passenger I think in can get 

2793
02:15:13,601 --> 02:15:14,950
arrested as well.
Wow.

2794
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:16,870
Even if they don't have a driver's 
license,

2795
02:15:17,230 --> 02:15:19,510
if they're an adult,
I think they can get arrested as well if

2796
02:15:19,511 --> 02:15:21,070
they don't have a driver's license at 
all.

2797
02:15:21,071 --> 02:15:21,904
That's a good point.
That's interesting because then it's 

2798
02:15:23,171 --> 02:15:24,240
like,
well officer,

2799
02:15:24,250 --> 02:15:26,640
you know it took the wheel but you're 
driving without a license.

2800
02:15:26,750 --> 02:15:27,583
Like,
well yeah,

2801
02:15:28,050 --> 02:15:31,300
but my point being they won't let you.
In Canada,

2802
02:15:31,450 --> 02:15:33,970
if you have a Dui they'll go fuck off.
Get out of here.

2803
02:15:34,030 --> 02:15:36,990
They turn you around.
They want no douchebags in Canada.

2804
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,580
If you have a violent assault and you're
on your arrest record.

2805
02:15:39,730 --> 02:15:40,563
I almost got kicked out it.
I almost got not let into Canada had a 

2806
02:15:43,410 --> 02:15:48,070
will for having stolen a snickers bar in
Alaska in 1982.

2807
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:49,550
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2808
02:15:49,630 --> 02:15:51,610
I went to prison.
I think I told that story.

2809
02:15:51,611 --> 02:15:53,500
Yeah,
you did this area.

2810
02:15:53,501 --> 02:15:56,890
So.
But I was told when I did four days,

2811
02:15:56,891 --> 02:15:57,724
you know,
and then I went before the magistrate 

2812
02:15:58,841 --> 02:16:01,150
and he said if you don't get arrested 
again in a year,

2813
02:16:01,151 --> 02:16:02,890
this will go off your record and all 
that.

2814
02:16:03,310 --> 02:16:07,060
So ever since when I've been asked if 
I've ever been convicted of a crime,

2815
02:16:07,061 --> 02:16:09,700
I always said no because I figured it's 
not on my record.

2816
02:16:09,701 --> 02:16:11,440
I don't want to confuse everybody and 
you know,

2817
02:16:11,441 --> 02:16:12,580
whatever.
And,

2818
02:16:12,581 --> 02:16:15,850
but the first time we went into Canada 
at BC,

2819
02:16:16,130 --> 02:16:18,100
you know,
he asked all these questions and we went

2820
02:16:18,101 --> 02:16:20,580
and sat down and he called me up,
you know,

2821
02:16:20,650 --> 02:16:21,483
just,
you know,

2822
02:16:21,650 --> 02:16:23,680
my wife and you.
And he's like,

2823
02:16:23,770 --> 02:16:28,480
is there anything you want to tell me 
about 1980 to 1982,

2824
02:16:28,481 --> 02:16:29,840
I don't know.
I was college and

2825
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:33,370
I don't know what he said,
the arrest and conviction,

2826
02:16:33,910 --> 02:16:35,110
fairbanks,
Alaska.

2827
02:16:35,350 --> 02:16:37,150
I'm like,
how are you kidding me?

2828
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:38,153
And I told him I eat a snickers bar and 
the fucking grocery store and it turned 

2829
02:16:40,841 --> 02:16:41,674
into this thing and.
But they told me it wasn't on my record 

2830
02:16:43,781 --> 02:16:44,614
and he said,
well,

2831
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:46,660
Canada gets your FBI records.

2832
02:16:48,550 --> 02:16:49,383
So.
So if you're ever so like there's a 

2833
02:16:51,031 --> 02:16:53,700
federal level where that shit doesn't go
away,

2834
02:16:53,950 --> 02:16:54,783
you know,
it's even more deep because Eddie Bravo 

2835
02:16:56,221 --> 02:16:57,054
got arrested and never even went to jail
and it shows up every time he goes into 

2836
02:16:59,881 --> 02:17:00,714
Canada.
He got arrested because he worked for a 

2837
02:17:01,831 --> 02:17:02,664
check cashing company and so he used to 
drive around with large sums of cash on 

2838
02:17:05,731 --> 02:17:07,200
him.
When he got pulled over by the cops,

2839
02:17:07,530 --> 02:17:09,300
cops pulled them over and he said,
officer,

2840
02:17:09,301 --> 02:17:12,030
I want to let you know that I have a 
loaded handgun in the car.

2841
02:17:12,120 --> 02:17:13,620
Here's my license to have it.
They go,

2842
02:17:13,860 --> 02:17:15,630
please step out of the car.
They handcuff him,

2843
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:17,820
they check everything,
make sure it's all kosher,

2844
02:17:17,910 --> 02:17:19,380
everything checks out.
They let them go.

2845
02:17:19,770 --> 02:17:24,570
But that incident is on his record.
So when he goes into Canada,

2846
02:17:24,571 --> 02:17:27,570
they pull them aside.
Every time I got stuff with him once,

2847
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:29,730
now I fucking,
if we go to Canada together,

2848
02:17:29,731 --> 02:17:31,730
I left that to get ahead of me.
Like,

2849
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:35,750
y'all fucking meet you outside because 
he gets dragged into that room.

2850
02:17:35,780 --> 02:17:37,380
Then they start asking you questions 
too.

2851
02:17:37,381 --> 02:17:38,214
And I'm like,
dude,

2852
02:17:38,310 --> 02:17:39,820
at least they're Canadian.
Yeah.

2853
02:17:40,090 --> 02:17:41,850
Hearing hearing were coming the other 
way.

2854
02:17:42,270 --> 02:17:43,103
It is

2855
02:17:43,610 --> 02:17:44,443
you.
If you can't offer a convincing defense 

2856
02:17:47,061 --> 02:17:47,894
as to why you weren't driving,
you may also be arrested and charged 

2857
02:17:50,471 --> 02:17:52,690
with reckless endangerment.
You're arresting.

2858
02:17:52,691 --> 02:17:54,670
Officer will argue that you put 
yourself,

2859
02:17:54,671 --> 02:17:55,504
the driver and members of the public in 
danger by allowing your friend to drive 

2860
02:17:57,671 --> 02:17:58,504
drunk.
Their case may be bolstered by the 

2861
02:18:00,911 --> 02:18:03,190
presence of other passengers in the 
vehicle.

2862
02:18:03,370 --> 02:18:05,860
Wow.
Yup.

2863
02:18:06,130 --> 02:18:09,160
You'll need to prove that.
The paragraph before that said,

2864
02:18:09,161 --> 02:18:13,600
you need to prove that you're not 
currently licensed to drive.

2865
02:18:13,601 --> 02:18:14,434
Don't know how to drive or have a 
medical restriction that prevents you 

2866
02:18:16,931 --> 02:18:19,480
from driving crazy.
Yeah.

2867
02:18:19,481 --> 02:18:20,970
See.
So I'm kinda right.

2868
02:18:21,310 --> 02:18:22,143
Better off being shit faced.
So if your shit faced and your friend's 

2869
02:18:25,091 --> 02:18:27,430
driving,
then you're okay.

2870
02:18:28,300 --> 02:18:29,620
Yeah.
You're shaking.

2871
02:18:29,650 --> 02:18:31,900
Your friend's driving like,
I wouldn't fucking drive home drunk.

2872
02:18:32,140 --> 02:18:33,700
I'm so drunk.
I didn't even know he was drunk.

2873
02:18:33,820 --> 02:18:35,920
So if you get pulled over and you're not
drunk,

2874
02:18:35,980 --> 02:18:40,980
hit that bottle for the splash whiskey 
all of your face.

2875
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:43,240
You're hammered here.
Okay.

2876
02:18:43,780 --> 02:18:44,613
He should play as play.
Sleeping or just say I took acid more 

2877
02:18:46,931 --> 02:18:49,060
than five times.
I hadn't legally insane.

2878
02:18:49,061 --> 02:18:49,894
I couldn't drive to the real scary thing
about what you're talking about as far 

2879
02:18:53,021 --> 02:18:55,390
as like getting in other countries 
because it shit on your record.

2880
02:18:55,750 --> 02:18:56,583
This is something that when I 
interviewed Aaron Frank at Singularity 

2881
02:19:00,630 --> 02:19:00,990
University,
they,

2882
02:19:00,990 --> 02:19:01,823
they,
they try to like think about like what 

2883
02:19:03,101 --> 02:19:04,870
are the implications of these 
technologies?

2884
02:19:04,871 --> 02:19:06,890
So you know,
the um,

2885
02:19:07,230 --> 02:19:08,063
the recent terrorist attack or they shot
up that people that couples shout out 

2886
02:19:11,051 --> 02:19:14,100
the people and apparently even though I 
think this got disproven,

2887
02:19:14,140 --> 02:19:17,570
Bernardino San Bernardino,
there were talking about how one of them

2888
02:19:17,720 --> 02:19:22,090
was a professed jihadist on their 
facebook page and they're saying,

2889
02:19:22,091 --> 02:19:23,830
well we don't check social there.

2890
02:19:23,850 --> 02:19:26,860
So whatever they've posted on facebook,
we don't do that.

2891
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:29,870
And you know,
a lot of news stations are saying,

2892
02:19:29,871 --> 02:19:31,190
a lot of people are saying,
what the fuck?

2893
02:19:31,191 --> 02:19:32,840
That's crazy.
You should check that.

2894
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:33,913
You should definitely check that.
So at singularity university there 

2895
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:42,260
saying what happens if the society 
changes so much,

2896
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:48,080
that shit that you've posted online and 
admitted to doing becomes illegal.

2897
02:19:48,530 --> 02:19:49,363
What happens then when all of that stuff
is infinitely accessible by all future 

2898
02:19:53,691 --> 02:19:57,080
governments?
What happens when if like who knows?

2899
02:19:57,081 --> 02:19:57,914
You know,
this is the scary thing that may happen 

2900
02:19:59,390 --> 02:20:02,360
right?
With mccarthy and the the ride communist

2901
02:20:02,370 --> 02:20:03,203
shaken shift.
Just that and that's the terrifying 

2902
02:20:05,481 --> 02:20:07,880
thing and I don't want to put negative 
energy out there.

2903
02:20:07,881 --> 02:20:08,714
I think we're all beings of love and 
ultimately everything's going to be 

2904
02:20:10,761 --> 02:20:11,594
okay,
but the but the one scary thing about 

2905
02:20:15,770 --> 02:20:16,603
when you look at like for profit or for 
profit conflict and you and you look at 

2906
02:20:22,191 --> 02:20:23,024
the fact that there is a benefit to some
awful thing happening in the United 

2907
02:20:28,130 --> 02:20:29,210
States on a big scale.

2908
02:20:29,210 --> 02:20:34,210
There's a monetary benefit to a great 
many people living in the United States,

2909
02:20:35,570 --> 02:20:38,930
weapons manufacturers,
legislators,

2910
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:42,770
people who are just get off on 
controlling other people and you realize

2911
02:20:42,771 --> 02:20:46,790
that it not only benefits them,
but they're also as a huge incentive for

2912
02:20:46,791 --> 02:20:50,090
people in other parts of the world to 
create that event.

2913
02:20:50,091 --> 02:20:53,000
Knowing that all it takes is one 
catastrophic event.

2914
02:20:53,240 --> 02:20:56,540
One catastrophic event were away.
We were like,

2915
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:58,250
what?
One dirty bomb away.

2916
02:20:58,400 --> 02:20:59,233
One new September,
11th away from experiencing one of the 

2917
02:21:04,671 --> 02:21:05,504
greatest dimunition of personal liberty 
that has ever happened in this country 

2918
02:21:11,210 --> 02:21:12,043
and the people who.
There's a lot of people who would like 

2919
02:21:13,881 --> 02:21:16,490
that to happen and they're not just 
terrorists.

2920
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:18,410
There's people who would like that to 
happen,

2921
02:21:18,590 --> 02:21:21,770
who run prisons.
There are people like that to happen who

2922
02:21:21,771 --> 02:21:25,760
like says who want world war three to 
happen because they sell web.

2923
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:26,773
There's so in.

2924
02:21:26,830 --> 02:21:27,663
That to me is fucking scary to think.
And if something like that did happen 

2925
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:36,260
and when we enter into some new or 
wellbeing awfulness,

2926
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:37,473
it didn't.
In all your shit that you've posted 

2927
02:21:39,350 --> 02:21:42,980
every single one of your podcasts.
So you're going first man,

2928
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:46,310
what a moving to Canada.
It doesn't matter.

2929
02:21:46,311 --> 02:21:47,144
You can't get into Canada.
You can't get into fucking candidate 

2930
02:21:48,681 --> 02:21:51,890
with the stuff you posted on your 
facebook page and you will know.

2931
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:56,570
I mean we're talking about what said,
I think you got to get out now.

2932
02:21:56,620 --> 02:21:59,420
That's what I'm going to be.
Australia saved nowhere,

2933
02:21:59,421 --> 02:22:01,900
so it seems like a good move.
Australia is awesome over.

2934
02:22:03,530 --> 02:22:04,363
Melbourne's amazing.
Although they're Sudanese perinos know 

2935
02:22:05,871 --> 02:22:06,704
Melbourne's got,
they've got some seriously strict drug 

2936
02:22:08,301 --> 02:22:08,781
laws.
Man.

2937
02:22:08,781 --> 02:22:09,820
I was at the,
I was,

2938
02:22:10,610 --> 02:22:12,770
I was,
I was in Australia at the uh,

2939
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:14,020
uh,
yeah,

2940
02:22:14,300 --> 02:22:15,650
no,
actually that was,

2941
02:22:15,710 --> 02:22:17,660
I was in New Zealand,
not Australia.

2942
02:22:17,661 --> 02:22:19,890
Sorry.
I think Australia is strict drug laws in

2943
02:22:20,030 --> 02:22:23,180
New South Wales does help bring sniffer 
dogs around,

2944
02:22:23,181 --> 02:22:24,890
you know,
like we're out in public.

2945
02:22:24,891 --> 02:22:25,940
Just try to find.
We're

2946
02:22:26,140 --> 02:22:28,920
locked.
Then you can't even wash the weed out of

2947
02:22:28,921 --> 02:22:29,754
your hair.
How do you going to smell it to bang a 

2948
02:22:35,281 --> 02:22:38,400
cat?
Cat up a tree.

2949
02:22:41,430 --> 02:22:42,930
Well,
again,

2950
02:22:42,931 --> 02:22:44,190
I think we're there.
I mean,

2951
02:22:44,310 --> 02:22:47,580
you keep phrasing things in terms of 
like what if we're on the verge of.

2952
02:22:47,581 --> 02:22:48,720
And I keep thinking,
dude,

2953
02:22:48,721 --> 02:22:51,090
we've been there for a long time.
I mean,

2954
02:22:51,091 --> 02:22:52,190
Eisenhower's,
you know,

2955
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:55,250
his parting speech,
the military industrial complex is,

2956
02:22:55,590 --> 02:22:56,700
you know,
he was warning at.

2957
02:22:56,701 --> 02:22:57,534
We're in a situation after World War Two
where the army doesn't stand down all 

2958
02:23:00,811 --> 02:23:01,644
these industries.
That sprang up Los Angeles as a result 

2959
02:23:04,201 --> 02:23:05,270
of World War Two,
right?

2960
02:23:05,630 --> 02:23:06,463
A Raytheon and Boeing,
they're all on the west coast because 

2961
02:23:08,731 --> 02:23:09,564
they were pumping out those airplanes 
and ships to go beat the japs and then 

2962
02:23:12,841 --> 02:23:13,674
they,
they're looking for something to do 

2963
02:23:14,521 --> 02:23:15,354
while they got to keep us on a war 
footing forever consulted my Harvard 

2964
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:21,810
placemat and you shouldn't say zap jabs.
Oh,

2965
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:27,720
I thought I said Nips.
My cries even worse.

2966
02:23:28,070 --> 02:23:32,250
Your cultural appropriation culturally 
appropriating their work.

2967
02:23:32,410 --> 02:23:33,900
She,
the,

2968
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:35,553
that always gets me that we'd make up 
names for countries we don't like the 

2969
02:23:37,861 --> 02:23:39,390
name they use.
What do you guys call yourself?

2970
02:23:39,450 --> 02:23:41,200
Nip Paul.
We don't like it.

2971
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:44,130
We're going to Japan.
Japan please.

2972
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:48,180
We just decide like,
this is a bunch of them.

2973
02:23:48,181 --> 02:23:49,014
Like that.
That was quite a few countries is in 

2974
02:23:50,600 --> 02:23:51,433
Greece.
Grease the.

2975
02:23:51,470 --> 02:23:53,590
They didn't call themselves grease right
where they call himself.

2976
02:23:53,730 --> 02:23:54,563
That's great to me.

2977
02:23:58,300 --> 02:23:58,740
Uh,
use

2978
02:23:58,740 --> 02:24:01,030
a Turkey to Turkey.
They call themselves Turkey.

2979
02:24:02,110 --> 02:24:02,943
It was a few countries and I don't 
remember what does the word they use 

2980
02:24:06,461 --> 02:24:08,260
mean Turkey?
I don't know.

2981
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:09,740
You know,
I don't think.

2982
02:24:10,140 --> 02:24:10,973
Yeah,
it's weird that it's the same as that 

2983
02:24:12,401 --> 02:24:15,970
bird.
If it wasn't for Thanksgiving,

2984
02:24:15,971 --> 02:24:20,660
would anybody give a fuck about Turkey 
country whole hunt or.

2985
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:22,990
No?
Nobody likes to eat Turkey.

2986
02:24:23,110 --> 02:24:24,160
I mean,
it's good,

2987
02:24:24,220 --> 02:24:26,890
but it's not.
The best grain is better than Turkey.

2988
02:24:26,920 --> 02:24:28,390
Can we agree?
Yeah.

2989
02:24:28,391 --> 02:24:32,250
There's no Kentucky Fried Turkey.
Yeah.

2990
02:24:32,340 --> 02:24:36,220
There's no Turkey stores now.
Chicken stores is Popeye's chicken.

2991
02:24:36,550 --> 02:24:37,460
There's.
There's A.

2992
02:24:37,461 --> 02:24:42,461
There's Kentucky Fried Chicken,
Turkey King Edward Bernays.

2993
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:43,993
Turkey Bacon for breakfast is is 
completely an invention of this 

2994
02:24:47,771 --> 02:24:51,790
advertising guy.
He was hired by the company.

2995
02:24:51,791 --> 02:24:52,624
I forget the name of the company,
but they're still around in some form 

2996
02:24:54,910 --> 02:24:59,770
that hired him to sell more pork and so 
he came up with this idea like bacon and

2997
02:24:59,771 --> 02:24:59,990
eggs.

2998
02:24:59,990 --> 02:25:00,823
That's what's for breakfast.
You got to like integrate it into the 

2999
02:25:02,621 --> 02:25:03,454
cultural traditions and ever since then 
it's been considered breakfast meat and 

3000
02:25:07,151 --> 02:25:08,830
boom.
Meanwhile it's awesome.

3001
02:25:08,831 --> 02:25:09,664
So congratulations.
So he was also behind the fluoridation 

3002
02:25:12,670 --> 02:25:16,960
of the water supply hired by Alcoa 
because they had all this,

3003
02:25:17,410 --> 02:25:20,890
all this.
I'm a byproduct of making aluminum,

3004
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:23,340
which is fluoride.
And they wanted to like,

3005
02:25:23,380 --> 02:25:24,700
what are we going to do with all this 
stuff?

3006
02:25:24,701 --> 02:25:25,930
You know,
we've got to find a way to sell it.

3007
02:25:25,931 --> 02:25:27,700
Who can we sell it to?
And he figured out like,

3008
02:25:27,701 --> 02:25:28,151
Oh,
we can,

3009
02:25:28,151 --> 02:25:29,520
you know,
it's good for dental.

3010
02:25:29,530 --> 02:25:32,110
It'll save everyone and get the 
government to buy it.

3011
02:25:32,230 --> 02:25:33,063
It's so funny.
We accept that man because like if 

3012
02:25:34,331 --> 02:25:36,970
someone comes over to your house and 
you're like,

3013
02:25:37,150 --> 02:25:38,530
do you want some water?
And they're like,

3014
02:25:38,531 --> 02:25:39,364
yeah.
And you're like,

3015
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:41,360
do you want me to add some fluoride to 
it?

3016
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:43,840
I'd be like,
fuck yeah,

3017
02:25:43,841 --> 02:25:45,700
it is a chemical that kills you.
So yeah.

3018
02:25:46,870 --> 02:25:49,000
Could you put a little fluoride in your 
head can kill you.

3019
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:52,690
It doesn't take a whole lot.
Like how much kills you?

3020
02:25:52,820 --> 02:25:53,950
A couple of teaspoons.
Full.

3021
02:25:54,040 --> 02:25:57,070
I don't know.
I have no tie with white teeth.

3022
02:25:57,280 --> 02:25:58,113
But is that real?
What's going on with dental hygiene 

3023
02:26:01,210 --> 02:26:02,590
versus.
I mean,

3024
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:03,553
is it Florida in the water that makes a 
difference or being conscious of dental 

3025
02:26:06,341 --> 02:26:07,570
hygiene,
dental hygiene.

3026
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:09,910
It's made the difference in tooth decay 
and people.

3027
02:26:09,940 --> 02:26:12,110
Well,
I mean talking to you,

3028
02:26:12,310 --> 02:26:13,143
talking to me,
I'm always going to take it back to 

3029
02:26:14,021 --> 02:26:14,854
foragers.
Foragers have amazing teeth meet and 

3030
02:26:17,690 --> 02:26:18,730
roots and shit.
Well,

3031
02:26:18,731 --> 02:26:23,731
some sand in a Weston Smith.
What is this?

3032
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:25,181
We put in this.
Oh,

3033
02:26:25,181 --> 02:26:27,450
this is bernays.
Said that.

3034
02:26:27,930 --> 02:26:28,763
Get the Bacon for breakfast and he is 
also responsible for fluoride in the 

3035
02:26:31,721 --> 02:26:34,390
water and Dixie Dixie Cup.

3036
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:38,350
Jamie is just like Dixie Cup show and 
then I'm not full of Shit.

3037
02:26:38,380 --> 02:26:39,310
I love it.
Jamie.

3038
02:26:39,660 --> 02:26:41,840
Thinking that they were drinking out of 
unsafe.

3039
02:26:42,070 --> 02:26:43,450
What?
What?

3040
02:26:43,480 --> 02:26:45,780
Look at this.
His campaign for Dixie Cups.

3041
02:26:45,781 --> 02:26:48,790
Scared people into thinking that glasses
they were drinking out of.

3042
02:26:48,791 --> 02:26:51,850
We're unsanitary and can be replaced by 
disposable cups.

3043
02:26:52,030 --> 02:26:54,180
Wow.
Did you read this for you?

3044
02:26:54,181 --> 02:26:55,360
Put it up.
That's insane.

3045
02:26:55,420 --> 02:26:58,450
And it was the beach nut packing company
that's hired.

3046
02:26:59,560 --> 02:27:03,460
This guy was amazing,
but the bacon he got right.

3047
02:27:03,580 --> 02:27:04,150
Oh,
he got.

3048
02:27:04,150 --> 02:27:06,350
He got everything right.
Dead on with the Bacon.

3049
02:27:06,410 --> 02:27:07,243
Bacon.
He also was behind the Virginia slims 

3050
02:27:09,521 --> 02:27:10,354
thing like,
oh,

3051
02:27:10,370 --> 02:27:13,720
how can we use feminism to get women to 
buy cigarettes?

3052
02:27:13,721 --> 02:27:16,210
It's a feminist cigarette and it's come 
a long way,

3053
02:27:16,211 --> 02:27:18,700
baby.
I bet that guy got laid like crazy.

3054
02:27:18,820 --> 02:27:21,760
I bet he was just a fucking maestro and 
he was Freud's nephew.

3055
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:22,833
Oh my goodness.
So he had the benefit of psychological 

3056
02:27:24,521 --> 02:27:26,830
examination under his uncle and he's 
proud of himself,

3057
02:27:26,831 --> 02:27:31,260
like he doesn't slightly ashamed dead.
He just died like 10 years ago.

3058
02:27:31,660 --> 02:27:33,010
Interviews with them where he's like,
yeah,

3059
02:27:33,011 --> 02:27:35,420
I did all this.
Shit was happy.

3060
02:27:35,470 --> 02:27:37,450
His success ratio is amazing,
right?

3061
02:27:37,510 --> 02:27:38,343
Oh,
he hit every one out of the park over 

3062
02:27:39,761 --> 02:27:40,594
and over.
If that's what you're trying to do and 

3063
02:27:41,501 --> 02:27:43,900
nobody tells you it's evil mean no one 
really.

3064
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:47,590
You know what's really fucked up is 
those God damn drug commercials,

3065
02:27:47,770 --> 02:27:48,603
those drug commercials where people are 
happy and they're walking hand in hand 

3066
02:27:50,981 --> 02:27:54,340
and meadows and then they start talking 
about explosive bloody diarrhea,

3067
02:27:54,370 --> 02:27:58,930
but they always do it in that voice that
I think we're being trained to ignore.

3068
02:27:59,190 --> 02:28:00,890
There's that voice at the end of the 
thing.

3069
02:28:01,210 --> 02:28:02,043
Side effects may include whenever they 
me to just ignore what I'm saying and 

3070
02:28:05,381 --> 02:28:07,550
watch the pretty picture.
Watch a pretty picture as your dog.

3071
02:28:07,551 --> 02:28:08,384
Exactly about this bullshit.
They should have to show you those side 

3072
02:28:11,321 --> 02:28:14,530
effects while they're doing this.
Is this is hilarious,

3073
02:28:14,710 --> 02:28:16,600
I don't know if you've seen this.
I tweeted this the other day.

3074
02:28:16,630 --> 02:28:21,630
The Australia came up with this thing 
called a stoner slaw and it's so stupid

3075
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:23,233
that people.
It's backfiring and causing people to 

3076
02:28:24,561 --> 02:28:26,700
smoke pot.
Also stoner slot.

3077
02:28:26,750 --> 02:28:29,930
If you go to stoner slot.com,
it's an actual weed website,

3078
02:28:30,160 --> 02:28:30,993
so what's funny about it is that it 
actually brought all this business too 

3079
02:28:36,170 --> 02:28:38,840
because if you go to stoners,
sloths.com

3080
02:28:38,841 --> 02:28:41,810
dot a U.
I don't know the exact.

3081
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:43,513
Yeah,
there it is.

3082
02:28:47,240 --> 02:28:48,560
Yeah.
If you go to stoners,

3083
02:28:48,640 --> 02:28:51,830
sloths,
whatever their website is dot a you.

3084
02:28:52,190 --> 02:28:53,023
Yeah.
There you go.

3085
02:28:54,690 --> 02:28:59,660
In the only sell Endeca and that's 
right.

3086
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:00,673
Yeah,
there it is.

3087
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:03,290
Your worse on wheat,
so that's a.

3088
02:29:03,291 --> 02:29:04,700
You now take the.
Hey you off.

3089
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:06,470
I haven't tried it.
I might embarrass myself here,

3090
02:29:06,471 --> 02:29:09,800
but an article I read,
they said it goes to a weed website.

3091
02:29:10,330 --> 02:29:12,380
I guess not.
Maybe somebody bought it.

3092
02:29:12,790 --> 02:29:16,580
Who know the government social network.
They have a stoner,

3093
02:29:16,581 --> 02:29:17,414
sloths social network.
What do they think it's going to turn 

3094
02:29:19,090 --> 02:29:19,780
into?

3095
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:22,250
The next thing is going to turn to the 
next facebook,

3096
02:29:22,251 --> 02:29:24,260
but yeah,
this is like a big embarrassment.

3097
02:29:24,900 --> 02:29:26,990
Let's play it because it's fucking so 
stupid.

3098
02:29:27,380 --> 02:29:28,670
It's so stupid.
It's awesome.

3099
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:31,430
I haven't seen it.
It's so dumb,

3100
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:34,400
but it's like that fucking thing.
Here's the thing about,

3101
02:29:34,401 --> 02:29:35,234
um,
the talking dog commercial that we all 

3102
02:29:36,741 --> 02:29:38,110
enjoyed back in the day.
Yeah.

3103
02:29:38,300 --> 02:29:41,840
Those were made by our partnership for 
drug free America and the fucked up part

3104
02:29:41,841 --> 02:29:42,674
about a partnership for drug free 
America is they are funded by alcohol 

3105
02:29:44,721 --> 02:29:47,240
and tobacco companies and pharmaceutical
companies.

3106
02:29:47,510 --> 02:29:48,343
And my joke was that's like hookers 
doing commercials against strippers and 

3107
02:29:51,261 --> 02:29:53,960
it really is like them doing commercials
pot.

3108
02:29:54,450 --> 02:29:56,960
It's insane.
Like they're not against drugs,

3109
02:29:57,140 --> 02:30:02,140
just drugs that they don't sell here.

3110
02:30:07,910 --> 02:30:12,040
Slaw in class.
You're worse on weed.

3111
02:30:12,041 --> 02:30:12,890
Stoner.
Sloth,

3112
02:30:14,360 --> 02:30:17,060
but little did the creators know.
Oh,

3113
02:30:17,061 --> 02:30:20,930
I see that stoner.
Sloths.com.

3114
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:22,333
Somebody put it down.
Is also the name of an online cannabis 

3115
02:30:24,921 --> 02:30:25,551
product.
Retail.

3116
02:30:25,551 --> 02:30:27,470
It's not on.
It's not up anymore though.

3117
02:30:27,740 --> 02:30:31,400
That's what's weird.
I wonder if their website got crushed.

3118
02:30:32,210 --> 02:30:34,800
Yeah.
Maybe stoner.

3119
02:30:34,820 --> 02:30:36,350
Sloth.
Yeah.

3120
02:30:36,770 --> 02:30:37,603
Well this is.
This is something that Australia is 

3121
02:30:39,261 --> 02:30:40,094
doing because they're kind of behind the
times when it comes to marijuana 

3122
02:30:43,191 --> 02:30:44,010
propaganda,
they.

3123
02:30:44,010 --> 02:30:47,060
They're still buying into some shit that
we thought of 15,

3124
02:30:47,061 --> 02:30:50,700
20 years ago.
New South Wales government ads.

3125
02:30:50,940 --> 02:30:53,330
This is just so stupid.
Yeah,

3126
02:30:53,630 --> 02:30:55,610
so Australia will be perfect if it had 
weed,

3127
02:30:55,790 --> 02:30:59,210
but that's the thing about the world.
There is no perfect place.

3128
02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:04,720
You go to the most amazing jungle island
habitat and you know,

3129
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:06,590
well you got to hang out with these 
fucking people.

3130
02:31:07,660 --> 02:31:10,970
Right?
You know Australia though.

3131
02:31:11,300 --> 02:31:12,800
Other than that,
other than their stance,

3132
02:31:12,801 --> 02:31:13,634
I lead a Melbourne's.
Most of my favorite places I've ever 

3133
02:31:16,071 --> 02:31:17,230
been.
Remind me.

3134
02:31:17,231 --> 02:31:19,980
A lot of San Francisco Sorta cafe

3135
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:24,240
vibe and progressive and very smart,
very smart people.

3136
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:25,103
You guys should do the.
I went down there to do this thing 

3137
02:31:27,451 --> 02:31:30,930
called the festival of dangerous ideas.
You guys,

3138
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:33,120
you guys would both fit right into the 
vibe.

3139
02:31:33,121 --> 02:31:34,290
It's really cool.
You get.

3140
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:36,780
It's like Ted,
I think we might've talked about it.

3141
02:31:36,781 --> 02:31:37,614
It's like Ted,
but without the sort of brand 

3142
02:31:39,661 --> 02:31:40,494
protection,
paranoia and that's a great way to put 

3143
02:31:42,631 --> 02:31:45,150
it down and then protection.
They're just like,

3144
02:31:45,210 --> 02:31:48,660
you know,
just say something crazy and provocative

3145
02:31:48,661 --> 02:31:49,494
and we just want people to walk out of 
here talking about whatever you say and 

3146
02:31:52,441 --> 02:31:53,274
that's great.
Bringing shame shape because we're not 

3147
02:31:55,021 --> 02:31:55,854
getting on a fucking plane and fly 
across the ocean to sound provocative 

3148
02:31:58,771 --> 02:32:03,180
and your country where they do what they
do at the Sydney Opera House.

3149
02:32:03,181 --> 02:32:04,790
That's pretty cool.
Yeah,

3150
02:32:04,890 --> 02:32:05,723
I played there.
That's,

3151
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:08,190
that's an awesome spot.
Sydney is awesome too.

3152
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:10,050
I like Sydney as well.
I like both.

3153
02:32:10,140 --> 02:32:10,973
I like Sydney,
like Melbourne was interesting because 

3154
02:32:13,561 --> 02:32:15,750
uh,
the food was fucking sensational.

3155
02:32:15,751 --> 02:32:17,910
Yeah.
Of that Asian market.

3156
02:32:18,550 --> 02:32:19,530
Yeah,
yeah,

3157
02:32:20,360 --> 02:32:21,090
yeah.
Have you,

3158
02:32:21,090 --> 02:32:23,700
did you go up to the barrier reef and do
all the announcements?

3159
02:32:23,830 --> 02:32:24,663
I didn't either.
It's only up there for a few days for 

3160
02:32:25,771 --> 02:32:26,910
the fight,
for a,

3161
02:32:26,970 --> 02:32:27,990
had a couple shows.
Oh,

3162
02:32:27,991 --> 02:32:30,090
you were there just recently for the 
lousy thing.

3163
02:32:30,330 --> 02:32:33,870
It's amazing how wrecked your brain gets
when you come back.

3164
02:32:33,900 --> 02:32:38,700
Like wrecked for days I would work out 
and I'd just be like,

3165
02:32:39,060 --> 02:32:41,430
where I'd normally be able to do like 10
reps of something.

3166
02:32:41,431 --> 02:32:43,980
I'd get to like six and I'd be like,
fuck,

3167
02:32:43,981 --> 02:32:45,960
I got three more,
seven,

3168
02:32:45,961 --> 02:32:49,110
fuck two more.
I just couldn't do it.

3169
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:54,140
I almost couldn't do the same physical 
things that I used to do.

3170
02:32:55,020 --> 02:32:57,720
I mean I could get to it,
but like if I was going to do 10 reps,

3171
02:32:57,721 --> 02:32:59,960
I'd probably get like nine or eight,
but the,

3172
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:01,890
but getting to it would be way harder.

3173
02:33:02,310 --> 02:33:04,860
But just like I couldn't believe it man.
And everyone's like,

3174
02:33:04,861 --> 02:33:07,660
you're going to be fucked up for about a
week from that.

3175
02:33:07,661 --> 02:33:09,150
And it's true.
It really does.

3176
02:33:09,230 --> 02:33:11,670
Requeue does something weird to you,
like you just,

3177
02:33:11,870 --> 02:33:16,380
you feel like your battery is broken.
Well this Guy Dan who does all the sleep

3178
02:33:16,381 --> 02:33:17,530
research,
uh,

3179
02:33:17,550 --> 02:33:19,890
this is his area,
like he's looking into why,

3180
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:24,030
why that fucks you up so bad.
Can you change Melatonin and you know,

3181
02:33:24,031 --> 02:33:27,540
using different medications and 
different techniques.

3182
02:33:27,541 --> 02:33:28,374
He works with seals and stuff.
He's like hardcore guy and apparently 

3183
02:33:31,681 --> 02:33:32,514
there are all these techniques that you 
can do a changing your sleep cycle 

3184
02:33:35,131 --> 02:33:37,590
before you go and you know,
time.

3185
02:33:37,591 --> 02:33:39,210
So you wake up at a different time and 
all that.

3186
02:33:39,770 --> 02:33:41,430
It just seems like too much trouble to 
me.

3187
02:33:41,431 --> 02:33:43,470
You know what they say too?
This is very bizarre.

3188
02:33:43,471 --> 02:33:44,304
It's way harder to go from Australia to 
the United States and it is to go from 

3189
02:33:47,101 --> 02:33:47,934
the United States to Australia like 
apparently that doesn't fuck up your 

3190
02:33:50,401 --> 02:33:53,730
circadian rhythms as much.
You're going east is harder.

3191
02:33:53,790 --> 02:33:58,170
We're just so weird because we want to 
think of ourselves as being very simple,

3192
02:33:58,320 --> 02:33:59,153
very simple,
very autonomous little beings that I 

3193
02:34:01,561 --> 02:34:03,090
just need my food,
my vitamins,

3194
02:34:03,091 --> 02:34:04,090
and I'm normal.
Now.

3195
02:34:04,100 --> 02:34:07,080
You're like tied into the cycles of the 
earth itself.

3196
02:34:07,081 --> 02:34:07,914
The light and dark,
the literal rising and setting of the 

3197
02:34:10,981 --> 02:34:15,160
sun has a direct effect on the rhythm of
your body,

3198
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:18,460
your biological operating

3199
02:34:18,460 --> 02:34:20,560
system,
falters.

3200
02:34:20,650 --> 02:34:21,483
When you throw that and it has to 
readjust and set things back and think 

3201
02:34:24,311 --> 02:34:27,880
about women who are menstruating with 
the phases of the moon every month.

3202
02:34:27,881 --> 02:34:28,714
I mean that's really intense.
Here's my favorite one is when a bunch 

3203
02:34:31,391 --> 02:34:35,490
of chicks live together and they start 
smelling pussies and their,

3204
02:34:35,491 --> 02:34:37,930
their,
their bodies don't even realize it,

3205
02:34:37,931 --> 02:34:39,820
but they get these coinciding menstrual 
cycles.

3206
02:34:40,430 --> 02:34:42,370
How strangers.
Then if that's happening,

3207
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:44,770
what other stuff is happening that we 
don't know about,

3208
02:34:44,771 --> 02:34:45,604
like how much are humans harmonizing 
with each other and other ways that we 

3209
02:34:48,431 --> 02:34:49,264
aren't even aware of it,
but my favorite example of that is this 

3210
02:34:52,451 --> 02:34:53,284
guy bruce vet weekend in Switzerland who
did research that become known as the 

3211
02:34:56,621 --> 02:34:57,454
sweaty shirts study.
I don't know if I've talked about this 

3212
02:34:59,591 --> 02:35:01,630
on the podcast before,
but so he.

3213
02:35:01,690 --> 02:35:02,523
He wanted to understand why women's 
sense of smell is so much stronger than 

3214
02:35:06,041 --> 02:35:06,430
men's.

3215
02:35:06,430 --> 02:35:08,920
Women can smell about seven times more 
than men.

3216
02:35:09,010 --> 02:35:09,760
Really?
Yeah.

3217
02:35:09,760 --> 02:35:12,780
Which is time.
If you come home with smelling funny,

3218
02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:15,880
you're not going to get away with it.
That sucks for them,

3219
02:35:15,881 --> 02:35:19,480
man.
You need to come home smelling funny.

3220
02:35:19,481 --> 02:35:21,210
Like smelling like pussy.
Exactly.

3221
02:35:21,610 --> 02:35:22,443
Yeah.
I don't think you're going to get away 

3222
02:35:22,901 --> 02:35:23,651
with it.
So anyway,

3223
02:35:23,651 --> 02:35:24,484
so he wanted to understand why is this 
and his hypothesis was that women are 

3224
02:35:27,641 --> 02:35:32,080
picking up information about men's 
immune system from their pheromones,

3225
02:35:32,081 --> 02:35:35,380
from the way they smell,
because you'll hear women often will say

3226
02:35:35,381 --> 02:35:36,790
like,
he's a cool guy.

3227
02:35:36,791 --> 02:35:38,020
He's got a good job,
he's funny,

3228
02:35:38,021 --> 02:35:40,570
whatever,
but the smell smells not right.

3229
02:35:40,600 --> 02:35:42,340
It's a deal breaker.
The smell,

3230
02:35:42,370 --> 02:35:44,740
they'll say the smell smell,
and it's not that he smells bad,

3231
02:35:44,741 --> 02:35:45,574
it's just the smells not right.
That'll be a deal breaker for a lot of 

3232
02:35:47,801 --> 02:35:49,360
women.
You never hear him say that,

3233
02:35:49,390 --> 02:35:49,930
right?

3234
02:35:49,930 --> 02:35:50,763
Yeah,
but you do.

3235
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:53,890
People do smell better.
Like some people just smell good,

3236
02:35:54,130 --> 02:35:56,350
smell them.
They just want to squeeze them.

3237
02:35:56,351 --> 02:35:57,760
They smell good.
You know,

3238
02:35:57,761 --> 02:36:00,790
and I'm not talking about like perfumes 
or just body.

3239
02:36:00,791 --> 02:36:04,150
I kind of a little bit offensive.
I've always felt like perfumes,

3240
02:36:04,151 --> 02:36:04,984
a little offensive.
Like I want to know what's going on 

3241
02:36:06,191 --> 02:36:06,790
here.
Why?

3242
02:36:06,790 --> 02:36:11,140
Because it's a masking.
Your fucking smoke bomb thrown down.

3243
02:36:11,380 --> 02:36:13,620
I can't.
Trying to find out where.

3244
02:36:13,670 --> 02:36:15,720
Where's the real you?
And they're like,

3245
02:36:15,800 --> 02:36:19,120
well no one's ever smelled a woman like 
a healthy woman and go,

3246
02:36:19,121 --> 02:36:19,954
man,
I wish he'd fucking spray some roses on 

3247
02:36:21,371 --> 02:36:22,790
this big.
You know,

3248
02:36:24,760 --> 02:36:27,250
France in the old days.
Well that's a different thing,

3249
02:36:27,251 --> 02:36:28,084
right?
You're dealing with personal hygiene 

3250
02:36:28,601 --> 02:36:29,434
issues,
but today when you're dealing with 

3251
02:36:30,701 --> 02:36:34,930
people that take regular showers,
bathe so you don't stink,

3252
02:36:34,990 --> 02:36:36,850
sorry,
just to finish the story.

3253
02:36:36,851 --> 02:36:39,730
So check this out because this is 
important knowledge for people to have.

3254
02:36:40,060 --> 02:36:41,170
So he,
he,

3255
02:36:41,171 --> 02:36:42,004
uh,
got a bunch of guys who were deficient 

3256
02:36:43,660 --> 02:36:44,493
in one part of their immune response and
then a bunch of women who were also 

3257
02:36:48,191 --> 02:36:50,380
deficient in one part,
the immune response,

3258
02:36:50,381 --> 02:36:51,214
it's called his immune 
histocompatibility index and let's say 

3259
02:36:55,721 --> 02:36:56,554
it has five elements.
So they would find a bunch of guys who 

3260
02:36:58,291 --> 02:37:01,360
are low in one or two or number three or
number four,

3261
02:37:01,361 --> 02:37:02,194
whatever.
And women who had the same different 

3262
02:37:03,670 --> 02:37:04,503
deficiencies.
That hypothesis was that a woman who's 

3263
02:37:06,730 --> 02:37:11,290
low in factor three won't be attracted 
to men who are low in factor three,

3264
02:37:11,291 --> 02:37:12,124
there'll be attracted to men who are 
high in factor three because then the 

3265
02:37:14,531 --> 02:37:16,010
babies be healthy,

3266
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:18,740
right?
So he gets these guys to wear tee shirts

3267
02:37:18,741 --> 02:37:20,900
for three days and nights with no 
deodorant,

3268
02:37:20,901 --> 02:37:22,310
no showers,
no soap,

3269
02:37:22,311 --> 02:37:23,144
nothing.
Then puts the tee shirts in plastic 

3270
02:37:24,801 --> 02:37:27,230
bags.
Then he has the women's smell,

3271
02:37:27,231 --> 02:37:31,010
the bags and mark on a piece of paper 
how attractive they thought the men were

3272
02:37:31,070 --> 02:37:33,320
based only on the smell of the tee 
shirts.

3273
02:37:33,620 --> 02:37:36,260
Right.
And he found that with 80 percent of the

3274
02:37:36,261 --> 02:37:37,094
women they chose as he predicted that 
they chose the men high and the thing 

3275
02:37:40,311 --> 02:37:41,144
that they were low in and they avoided 
the men who were low in the thing that 

3276
02:37:43,221 --> 02:37:44,054
they were alone,
but in about 20 percent they seem to be 

3277
02:37:46,701 --> 02:37:47,534
choosing randomly.
So he went back and looked at the women 

3278
02:37:50,391 --> 02:37:53,450
again and found that those 20 percent 
were on birth control pills,

3279
02:37:54,830 --> 02:37:58,880
birth control pill,
short circuits that response.

3280
02:37:58,910 --> 02:37:59,743
Well,
so think of how many couples who have 

3281
02:38:01,521 --> 02:38:05,180
gotten together when she's on the pill 
and they both,

3282
02:38:05,181 --> 02:38:08,750
like Louis Ck,
Joe's looking into just looking into the

3283
02:38:08,751 --> 02:38:09,290
distance.

3284
02:38:09,290 --> 02:38:10,610
Was she on the pill?
And I met her.

3285
02:38:11,240 --> 02:38:12,073
Uh,
I talked about this at an interview in 

3286
02:38:13,311 --> 02:38:15,800
San Francisco on the pbs station down 
there.

3287
02:38:15,801 --> 02:38:17,510
And as I'm talking,
the guys going,

3288
02:38:17,960 --> 02:38:20,240
making the gesture like that happened to
me,

3289
02:38:20,241 --> 02:38:21,620
but be quiet,
don't say.

3290
02:38:21,950 --> 02:38:23,150
And after the interview,
he's like,

3291
02:38:23,151 --> 02:38:24,230
dude,
that's exactly.

3292
02:38:24,530 --> 02:38:27,260
My wife went off the pill and she was 
done with me.

3293
02:38:27,770 --> 02:38:29,630
She didn't want them sleeping in the 
same bed.

3294
02:38:29,631 --> 02:38:31,750
She didn't want me in the same house.
Suki,

3295
02:38:32,350 --> 02:38:37,310
a lot of marriages are falling apart 
because they got together when the woman

3296
02:38:37,311 --> 02:38:38,144
couldn't smell,
he is compatibility and it's not his 

3297
02:38:40,161 --> 02:38:41,600
fault.
Shit.

3298
02:38:41,660 --> 02:38:42,480
Yeah,
isn't that?

3299
02:38:42,480 --> 02:38:45,500
That's a mind blower.
And it's one of these things,

3300
02:38:45,501 --> 02:38:46,334
like Dumbo was saying,
where we ignore these natural reflex is 

3301
02:38:50,180 --> 02:38:53,420
to our detriment.
We pretend we're not animals.

3302
02:38:53,421 --> 02:38:54,260
Fuck that.
Of course

3303
02:38:54,270 --> 02:38:55,103
we're animals.
We're just the coinciding menstrual 

3304
02:38:57,121 --> 02:38:57,954
cycles alone.
Obviously there's some crazy shit going 

3305
02:38:59,671 --> 02:39:00,504
on,
but that is like another level crazy 

3306
02:39:02,041 --> 02:39:02,874
shit that I didn't even think about.
All the factors that would lead to you 

3307
02:39:06,150 --> 02:39:09,600
being out of whack if your body's 
constantly thinking gets pregnant.

3308
02:39:09,930 --> 02:39:11,970
And that's what.
That's what the pill does.

3309
02:39:12,290 --> 02:39:14,340
It tricks your body into thinking,
don't get pregnant,

3310
02:39:14,341 --> 02:39:15,210
you already pregnant.

3311
02:39:15,640 --> 02:39:19,060
And that's why a lot of women have much 
less libido when they're on the pill.

3312
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:20,190
Oh yeah.
Already pregnant.

3313
02:39:20,260 --> 02:39:24,280
So I'm just really bad.
And I dated a girl and she off the pill,

3314
02:39:24,281 --> 02:39:25,114
she was so fucking Horny,
but then she got on the pill and it was 

3315
02:39:27,361 --> 02:39:30,420
like it just stopped.
And then she got off the pill again.

3316
02:39:30,421 --> 02:39:31,254
She was like,
we gotta figure out something else 

3317
02:39:31,801 --> 02:39:33,530
because I don't even like sex when I'm 
on the pill.

3318
02:39:33,531 --> 02:39:35,160
She was like,
I'm totally disinterested,

3319
02:39:35,790 --> 02:39:38,220
but off the pill she was crazy horny.
It was.

3320
02:39:38,310 --> 02:39:41,100
It was like a switch went off.
It took like two days.

3321
02:39:41,250 --> 02:39:44,370
She started taking the pills and then it
just wouldn't just shut down.

3322
02:39:44,371 --> 02:39:45,204
She would be dry.
It was like his crate and then off the 

3323
02:39:47,041 --> 02:39:49,020
pills.
She's a freak nuts.

3324
02:39:49,320 --> 02:39:54,270
That concept that there's this data 
field,

3325
02:39:54,271 --> 02:39:55,104
like a chemical data field surrounding 
everybody makes sense that you can tune 

3326
02:39:58,561 --> 02:39:59,394
into and understand aspects of like deep
aspects to know a person's like some 

3327
02:40:05,191 --> 02:40:09,630
specific deficiency in their immune 
system just from your nose.

3328
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:12,960
That's crazy.
And that kind of stuff lends credence to

3329
02:40:13,050 --> 02:40:13,883
idea of telepathy or clairvoyance or 
people who can read other people really 

3330
02:40:17,671 --> 02:40:18,504
well.
Like maybe they're just somehow better 

3331
02:40:20,671 --> 02:40:24,030
at detecting whatever chemical field is 
around the person.

3332
02:40:24,031 --> 02:40:24,864
And can decode it in a certain way.
What are we doing with like people were 

3333
02:40:28,141 --> 02:40:28,974
have a whole culture of women that are 
taking pills that trick their body and 

3334
02:40:32,701 --> 02:40:35,520
did not being able to recognize the 
clues of compatibility.

3335
02:40:36,020 --> 02:40:36,853
You think about how many kids are born 
with health deficiencies because of 

3336
02:40:40,471 --> 02:40:42,000
this,
because people low in,

3337
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:43,273
you know,
number three and get together and these 

3338
02:40:45,541 --> 02:40:46,850
kids have.
Wow.

3339
02:40:46,920 --> 02:40:47,910
Yeah.
There's all sorts of,

3340
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:48,833
you know,
we were talking earlier about smearing 

3341
02:40:49,681 --> 02:40:53,130
vaginal fluid on a newborn baby who's 
born through csection.

3342
02:40:53,131 --> 02:40:56,010
Again,
we're pretending we're not animals.

3343
02:40:56,310 --> 02:40:59,870
We're pretending there's not a huge 
benefit in,

3344
02:40:59,920 --> 02:41:03,130
in being contaminated with life,
you know,

3345
02:41:03,360 --> 02:41:04,193
that were these sterile creatures that 
exists separate from our shit and Piss 

3346
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:08,420
in her.

3347
02:41:08,420 --> 02:41:09,253
It's one of the things you realize from 
grappling in Jujitsu when you start 

3348
02:41:12,511 --> 02:41:15,390
getting really into it.
Do you have to keep a healthy biome?

3349
02:41:15,630 --> 02:41:18,510
You have to keep healthy skin floor.
It's critical.

3350
02:41:18,710 --> 02:41:19,543
Like one of the first things they tell 
you when you start training is you 

3351
02:41:21,571 --> 02:41:24,960
should start taking supplements like 
acidophilus something,

3352
02:41:24,961 --> 02:41:27,210
probiotic,
because you want to keep your skin flora

3353
02:41:27,211 --> 02:41:31,340
healthy and you want to not use 
antibiotic soap like a lot of times when

3354
02:41:31,341 --> 02:41:35,160
people get infections,
one of the problems is they've created a

3355
02:41:35,161 --> 02:41:37,440
barren wasteland on the surface of their
skin,

3356
02:41:37,650 --> 02:41:38,483
so infections to take hold and then you 
treat those infections with more 

3357
02:41:41,401 --> 02:41:42,234
antibiotics and you kill off all the 
natural healthy like acidophilus in 

3358
02:41:47,310 --> 02:41:48,143
particular is supposed to be aggressive 
towards certain types of infections so 

3359
02:41:51,391 --> 02:41:54,120
that like if you keep a healthy skin 
flora,

3360
02:41:54,300 --> 02:41:58,050
you're less likely to get things like 
ringworm or things along those lines.

3361
02:41:58,170 --> 02:41:59,910
Well,
this is also what they're talking about.

3362
02:41:59,911 --> 02:42:00,744
Either this,
there's a new kind of antibiotic 

3363
02:42:02,311 --> 02:42:04,110
resistant.
What does that.

3364
02:42:04,111 --> 02:42:04,944
Can you explain that?
Because I keep reading about it sounds 

3365
02:42:06,361 --> 02:42:07,560
terrifying.
Well,

3366
02:42:07,561 --> 02:42:08,161
it's,
you know,

3367
02:42:08,161 --> 02:42:11,010
the,
the pathogens are constantly mutating,

3368
02:42:11,070 --> 02:42:11,903
right?
In response to whatever antibiotics has 

3369
02:42:13,590 --> 02:42:18,300
been developed and we've come to the end
of this particular line of antibiotics.

3370
02:42:18,301 --> 02:42:19,134
So there's no more.
There's no more variations on this 

3371
02:42:20,641 --> 02:42:22,620
molecule right?
They keep tweaking it,

3372
02:42:22,621 --> 02:42:25,530
tweaking it,
and they've tweaked it every way,

3373
02:42:25,531 --> 02:42:29,130
every which way possible.
And this pathogen has mutated once again

3374
02:42:29,131 --> 02:42:31,590
as we knew it would.
And there's nothing,

3375
02:42:31,950 --> 02:42:34,080
there's nothing.
There's no response.

3376
02:42:34,081 --> 02:42:38,400
So if you get this infection,
your dad back to the 14,

3377
02:42:38,401 --> 02:42:39,234
I put this way back,
it puts us back to wherever to the play 

3378
02:42:41,870 --> 02:42:44,940
or whatever your arm amputated.
And we had um,

3379
02:42:44,990 --> 02:42:46,080
you know,
Rhonda Patrick,

3380
02:42:46,081 --> 02:42:48,360
have you ever listened to her?
Dr Rhonda Patrick.

3381
02:42:49,260 --> 02:42:50,093
She had a pretty significant Murcia 
infection of staph infection that just 

3382
02:42:53,460 --> 02:42:55,010
wouldn't go away.
And you know,

3383
02:42:55,020 --> 02:43:00,020
she fixed it with topical use of ground 
garlic and grape seed extract.

3384
02:43:01,590 --> 02:43:04,830
The ground garlic apparently has this 
radical effect on,

3385
02:43:04,831 --> 02:43:05,910
uh,
on mercer.

3386
02:43:06,360 --> 02:43:09,210
And another thing that supposedly helps 
to his cannabis oil.

3387
02:43:09,660 --> 02:43:11,770
Cannabis oil is supposed to be really 
good

3388
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:14,200
at fighting off staffed staph 
infections.

3389
02:43:14,210 --> 02:43:15,400
So what else is good?
I mean,

3390
02:43:15,401 --> 02:43:18,310
I don't know about staff,
but seawater,

3391
02:43:18,450 --> 02:43:21,250
seawater,
seawater is good as my wife.

3392
02:43:21,460 --> 02:43:22,293
Irrigated wounds with seawater a lot in 
Mozambique and pissing on your feet 

3393
02:43:26,711 --> 02:43:29,710
keeps the athlete's foot away.
Isn't that weird?

3394
02:43:29,740 --> 02:43:32,500
Yeah.
We were taught that in wrestling,

3395
02:43:32,530 --> 02:43:33,810
if you've got athlete's foot,
you're pressing,

3396
02:43:33,820 --> 02:43:35,950
your feet are just pissed on your feet 
every,

3397
02:43:35,980 --> 02:43:36,813
every morning,
especially that first pice is really 

3398
02:43:38,531 --> 02:43:40,780
because it's full of uric acid 
accumulated overnight,

3399
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:41,943
just piss on your feet every morning in 
the shower and you just don't get 

3400
02:43:43,721 --> 02:43:45,790
athletes,
so that's why people drink their pis.

3401
02:43:45,940 --> 02:43:46,773
They would drink their first pice of the
morning because it supposedly has all 

3402
02:43:48,971 --> 02:43:52,780
our vitamins and nutrients and it's very
bizarre practice.

3403
02:43:52,781 --> 02:43:53,710
I don't know about that.

3404
02:43:57,720 --> 02:43:58,553
I've done it.
I've drank my piss a few times to 

3405
02:43:59,861 --> 02:44:01,450
experiment.
I don't know.

3406
02:44:01,560 --> 02:44:02,393
I'm probably not.
I'd probably better off with like a 

3407
02:44:03,851 --> 02:44:04,684
multivitamin.
It seems to me if you were meant to 

3408
02:44:07,931 --> 02:44:10,080
drink your pis then you wouldn't piss.
Yeah.

3409
02:44:10,081 --> 02:44:12,310
Well your body would just send it right 
back in.

3410
02:44:12,370 --> 02:44:14,120
Right.
But this.

3411
02:44:14,170 --> 02:44:16,740
Why were you why your balls and the 
outside to keep them?

3412
02:44:16,750 --> 02:44:17,700
People can kick them.
No,

3413
02:44:17,710 --> 02:44:19,400
it's to keep them cool.
Okay.

3414
02:44:19,420 --> 02:44:20,640
You know what I'm saying?
Like there's some flaws.

3415
02:44:20,940 --> 02:44:22,720
That's the wrong metaphor for me,
man.

3416
02:44:23,020 --> 02:44:26,380
I don't think Pistons a flaw.
It is.

3417
02:44:26,381 --> 02:44:28,750
If you know,
otherwise you would go,

3418
02:44:28,900 --> 02:44:31,320
you would dehydrate.
I mean if like,

3419
02:44:31,330 --> 02:44:32,163
if you never dehydrated,
your body would never express water in 

3420
02:44:35,201 --> 02:44:36,034
that way.
Like you take water and you keep a 

3421
02:44:36,821 --> 02:44:39,400
healthy level and it's like oil in your 
car,

3422
02:44:39,780 --> 02:44:41,050
like you know,
your levels there,

3423
02:44:41,051 --> 02:44:41,650
you're good.

3424
02:44:41,650 --> 02:44:43,600
But no,
we're like constantly getting rid of it,

3425
02:44:43,750 --> 02:44:44,583
but I guess it actually cycles through 
your body and it takes impurities out 

3426
02:44:47,351 --> 02:44:48,184
and actually there's a lot of other 
things going on when you drink a lot of 

3427
02:44:49,781 --> 02:44:50,614
water.
That's why one of the things that 

3428
02:44:52,181 --> 02:44:53,530
happens to people in,
they're dehydrated,

3429
02:44:53,531 --> 02:44:58,531
they get kidney stones and get 
crystallized things in your body and you

3430
02:44:58,901 --> 02:44:59,734
know,
you have to piss those out of your Dick 

3431
02:45:00,540 --> 02:45:01,373
Hole.
I had,

3432
02:45:01,470 --> 02:45:03,460
I had a kidney stone.
We dehydrated.

3433
02:45:04,300 --> 02:45:05,950
I don't think so.
This beer count.

3434
02:45:06,370 --> 02:45:07,570
Um,
what else?

3435
02:45:07,571 --> 02:45:08,510
Diarrhetic.
Yeah,

3436
02:45:08,670 --> 02:45:09,503
I know.
I don't know the hall's diarrhetic 

3437
02:45:11,381 --> 02:45:12,214
right?
Yeah.

3438
02:45:12,370 --> 02:45:14,320
Yeah.
But they say it dehydrates you.

3439
02:45:14,410 --> 02:45:16,240
Alcohol ultimately,
you know.

3440
02:45:16,680 --> 02:45:19,900
But here's an interesting fact.
Did you know that all animals pissed the

3441
02:45:19,901 --> 02:45:21,940
same amount of time.
All of them.

3442
02:45:22,030 --> 02:45:24,250
It's this bizarre fractal thing.
Yeah.

3443
02:45:24,251 --> 02:45:27,340
Jimmy can confirm whether as Jamie,
Jamie,

3444
02:45:27,370 --> 02:45:28,121
Jamie,
Jimmy,

3445
02:45:28,121 --> 02:45:30,840
call them young Jamie young,
Jamie A.

3446
02:45:30,880 --> 02:45:31,713
Yeah,
apparently it's like the size of the 

3447
02:45:33,341 --> 02:45:38,200
bladder and the volume of the urethra 
is.

3448
02:45:38,420 --> 02:45:41,740
It's like a fractal thing where it could
be a mouse or an elephant,

3449
02:45:42,100 --> 02:45:42,933
so a full piss takes the same amount of 
time for an elephant as it does for a 

3450
02:45:45,981 --> 02:45:50,740
mouse and elephant piss.
It's like Jesus.

3451
02:45:51,900 --> 02:45:54,820
So waterfalls and drinking that.
It's insane.

3452
02:45:55,570 --> 02:45:59,260
Most mammals take 20 seconds.
Same with humans.

3453
02:45:59,320 --> 02:46:04,210
Not if you're drinking beer.
Well your bladder,

3454
02:46:04,270 --> 02:46:06,390
right?
So it doesn't matter what's in it yet,

3455
02:46:06,391 --> 02:46:07,224
but if you fully hold your pis in for 
like a long time and you finally get to 

3456
02:46:10,521 --> 02:46:11,354
a bathroom,
you're like,

3457
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:14,540
uh,
I've definitely piss along on the 22nd.

3458
02:46:14,550 --> 02:46:15,383
That's really nice of them.
Do include an image of a Beagle in case 

3459
02:46:19,071 --> 02:46:24,071
you wondered what the least offensive 
penis that they could find.

3460
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:28,130
One that doesn't represent the 
patriarchy illegal.

3461
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:31,910
Couldn't get like a pit bull.
They got racehorse in there.

3462
02:46:31,911 --> 02:46:32,744
Did you see that?
It Will Piss pee for about as long as a 

3463
02:46:35,220 --> 02:46:35,550
rhino.

3464
02:46:35,550 --> 02:46:36,383
A racehorse because people say high 
pitched like a rain or I got to Piss 

3465
02:46:38,901 --> 02:46:41,120
like a race horse,
but I think there's talking volume.

3466
02:46:41,121 --> 02:46:43,210
You ever seen a race horse piss.
Good Lord.

3467
02:46:43,290 --> 02:46:45,130
Yeah.
The volume is just stunning.

3468
02:46:45,150 --> 02:46:48,260
Comes fast.
Sti Pressure.

3469
02:46:48,460 --> 02:46:50,010
Yeah.
It's like Wah.

3470
02:46:50,150 --> 02:46:53,540
So I'll tell you what.
This kidney stone made me think there is

3471
02:46:53,541 --> 02:46:57,950
a god and he loves me or she because it 
was a horrible thing.

3472
02:46:57,980 --> 02:47:00,720
You guys haven't had a kidney stone.
It's just like.

3473
02:47:01,370 --> 02:47:02,203
So I wake up,
I think I told this story on a live 

3474
02:47:04,191 --> 02:47:07,760
podcast I did with you in San Francisco.
I don't remember.

3475
02:47:07,770 --> 02:47:08,840
Long time ago.
Yeah.

3476
02:47:08,841 --> 02:47:11,090
I remember thinking why am I telling the
story?

3477
02:47:11,540 --> 02:47:13,170
But uh,
so I,

3478
02:47:13,180 --> 02:47:18,180
I woke up excruciating abdominal pain.
Cosillo my wife who's a doctor,

3479
02:47:18,231 --> 02:47:21,140
thought I had a gas bubble in my 
intestines.

3480
02:47:21,141 --> 02:47:25,730
So she had me upside down on the sofa 
with a funnel stuck in my ass.

3481
02:47:25,730 --> 02:47:29,570
And she was born in Hollow Party at 
Chris Ryan.

3482
02:47:30,620 --> 02:47:33,740
She's foreign extra virgin olive oil.
Oh my ass.

3483
02:47:34,060 --> 02:47:34,893
I remember laying there upside down.
That's what I remember thinking like 

3484
02:47:37,911 --> 02:47:40,160
honeymoon was over.
We're into marriage now,

3485
02:47:40,220 --> 02:47:42,620
this is marriage,
but uh,

3486
02:47:42,710 --> 02:47:44,000
cuz she's like,
she's a doctor,

3487
02:47:44,001 --> 02:47:46,070
she's completely like the bodies of the 
body.

3488
02:47:46,220 --> 02:47:48,170
She doesn't give a shit clinical.
Um,

3489
02:47:48,200 --> 02:47:50,150
but anyway,
it turns out it was a kidney stone,

3490
02:47:50,151 --> 02:47:53,300
long story.
It had already gone into the two between

3491
02:47:53,301 --> 02:47:56,930
my kidney and my bladder.
And so that's what the pain is,

3492
02:47:56,931 --> 02:47:59,300
that it's sort of scrape and it's way 
down the tube,

3493
02:47:59,690 --> 02:48:03,020
but it didn't block the flow so it 
wasn't having the kidney infection,

3494
02:48:03,021 --> 02:48:05,300
which people sometimes get that's really
dangerous.

3495
02:48:05,360 --> 02:48:07,100
What they do then they operate on you.
Well,

3496
02:48:07,101 --> 02:48:10,550
what they wanted to do is they send 
sound waves in from your back,

3497
02:48:10,640 --> 02:48:11,473
from the back and the front,
and they calibrate it so that the waves 

3498
02:48:13,701 --> 02:48:15,320
meet right where the stone is.

3499
02:48:15,320 --> 02:48:16,153
And you say the back in the front,
you mean your decoding your bottom in 

3500
02:48:18,771 --> 02:48:19,604
your abdomen.
It's going from your kidney in this 

3501
02:48:22,041 --> 02:48:24,020
little tube down to your bladder.
Well,

3502
02:48:24,021 --> 02:48:26,610
how do they get that sound in there?
So they,

3503
02:48:26,611 --> 02:48:27,440
they do,
uh,

3504
02:48:27,440 --> 02:48:29,960
an x ray and find exactly where it is.
Right?

3505
02:48:29,961 --> 02:48:32,630
And then they have like sonogram 
machines,

3506
02:48:32,631 --> 02:48:34,640
right?
That are sending vibrations and and they

3507
02:48:34,730 --> 02:48:35,563
meet at the point where the stone is in 
the break it into sand and then you can 

3508
02:48:38,991 --> 02:48:40,660
piss it out.
So yeah,

3509
02:48:40,670 --> 02:48:41,503
it's great.
But unfortunately mine had already 

3510
02:48:43,581 --> 02:48:47,480
passed through the tube into my bladder 
by the time they got around to it.

3511
02:48:47,481 --> 02:48:48,890
So they're like,
well if it's in the bladder,

3512
02:48:48,891 --> 02:48:49,724
we can't do it.
We're going to have to go in through 

3513
02:48:51,201 --> 02:48:52,034
your dick with needle nose pliers.
They go up and grab this thing and then 

3514
02:48:58,371 --> 02:49:01,180
pull it out,
take your awake.

3515
02:49:01,181 --> 02:49:02,014
What is happening?
And I asked and I had the meeting with 

3516
02:49:04,101 --> 02:49:07,100
the anesthesiologist and I'm like,
can you just put me under for this?

3517
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:08,100
I do not want

3518
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:09,250
to be awake when someone

3519
02:49:09,580 --> 02:49:11,380
can your eyes.
She says,

3520
02:49:11,381 --> 02:49:16,381
see the screen behind you'll redman up 
boy.

3521
02:49:17,740 --> 02:49:19,630
So I was like,
not into this.

3522
02:49:19,631 --> 02:49:20,464
Right?
And I'm on the waiting list and it's 

3523
02:49:23,111 --> 02:49:26,030
like any day they're going to call me 
and I'm going to go in and they're going

3524
02:49:26,031 --> 02:49:26,864
to like put this thing out my dick.
And meanwhile it was new year's Eve 

3525
02:49:31,540 --> 02:49:33,310
[inaudible] and I wake up in the 
morning,

3526
02:49:33,311 --> 02:49:36,370
New Year's Day morning,
we have sex,

3527
02:49:36,850 --> 02:49:37,683
I go downstairs to the bathroom and I'm 
pissing in the bathroom sink because we 

3528
02:49:41,561 --> 02:49:44,950
have this Asian toilet squat,
toilet.

3529
02:49:44,951 --> 02:49:46,960
So if you paste it,
if I piss in that standing up,

3530
02:49:46,961 --> 02:49:47,794
it splashes all over.
So the deal is I piss in the sink and 

3531
02:49:50,520 --> 02:49:52,150
rinse it and it's fine.
You never noticed.

3532
02:49:52,180 --> 02:49:55,000
Never noticed.
So I'm pissing down the side of the sink

3533
02:49:55,360 --> 02:49:59,520
and put outcomes.
The stone paintings,

3534
02:49:59,600 --> 02:50:01,930
how many was it?
It's like half.

3535
02:50:02,020 --> 02:50:03,190
I don't know.
Is that a centimeter?

3536
02:50:03,230 --> 02:50:04,063
Something like,
you know that about the size of your 

3537
02:50:05,471 --> 02:50:06,160
fingertip?

3538
02:50:06,160 --> 02:50:07,720
It's a real rock.
It was like a,

3539
02:50:07,721 --> 02:50:10,180
it was like a snowflake.
It was a wafer.

3540
02:50:10,340 --> 02:50:13,240
A thick thicker than a snowflake.
But like a wafer,

3541
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:17,620
it just pumped out and somehow it had 
gotten into the tube and the orgasm.

3542
02:50:17,910 --> 02:50:21,040
The ejaculation pushed it right up to 
the end of my Dick.

3543
02:50:21,360 --> 02:50:22,990
And then when I pissed it just popped 
out.

3544
02:50:23,020 --> 02:50:26,290
It was no pain at all.
It was masked by the orgasm.

3545
02:50:26,350 --> 02:50:29,320
So it looped it up.
It looped it up and it and it,

3546
02:50:29,580 --> 02:50:30,413
you know,
filled my head with endorphins or 

3547
02:50:32,141 --> 02:50:35,530
whatever when I was having the orgasm.
So I didn't feel the pain.

3548
02:50:35,531 --> 02:50:37,330
I felt like a slight burn.
But like,

3549
02:50:37,331 --> 02:50:39,010
yeah,
whatever day it was.

3550
02:50:39,011 --> 02:50:41,830
Fantastic.
So that's my kidney stones story.

3551
02:50:41,831 --> 02:50:42,664
So I do,
I think I've looked over a cassie took 

3552
02:50:45,641 --> 02:50:48,810
it to the hospital and had it analyzed 
or would they say uh,

3553
02:50:49,020 --> 02:50:49,853
well they,
I guess they can by looking at the 

3554
02:50:51,371 --> 02:50:54,610
chemical composition,
they can tell what causes it.

3555
02:50:54,611 --> 02:50:57,610
If it's a chronic thing or if it's 
dehydration or whatever.

3556
02:50:57,760 --> 02:50:59,490
What if it was from another planet,
Bro?

3557
02:51:02,080 --> 02:51:03,770
You're pissing out million.
Rob.

3558
02:51:03,800 --> 02:51:06,160
Getting a tiny little writing on it.

3559
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:07,380
When Doug and I,
we're doing that.

3560
02:51:07,410 --> 02:51:10,670
So help me.
I'm stuck in here when Duncan and I

3561
02:51:10,830 --> 02:51:13,320
doing that silly show that Joe Rogan 
questions everything show.

3562
02:51:13,321 --> 02:51:14,154
We ran into these people that do think 
that they have implants in their body 

3563
02:51:17,491 --> 02:51:21,390
that aliens have it and they'll find 
like some bizarre imperfection,

3564
02:51:21,391 --> 02:51:22,224
their skin and they'll swear that wasn't
there before and that there's something 

3565
02:51:25,171 --> 02:51:28,650
in there and one of them was insanely 
hot and we got Duncan to talk to her and

3566
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:29,760
was like,
yeah,

3567
02:51:29,761 --> 02:51:30,410
I mean

3568
02:51:30,410 --> 02:51:33,700
probably.
I mean,

3569
02:51:33,740 --> 02:51:37,110
totally makes sense.
Good journalists.

3570
02:51:37,590 --> 02:51:40,090
He was.
If it was a ball fat,

3571
02:51:42,570 --> 02:51:43,550
like,
wait a minute,

3572
02:51:43,580 --> 02:51:46,340
why do you think that that's an alien 
implant?

3573
02:51:47,190 --> 02:51:50,830
It's a scratch.
I missed that episode.

3574
02:51:50,990 --> 02:51:51,823
No,
you're questioning my journalistic 

3575
02:51:52,911 --> 02:51:53,744
integrity.

3576
02:51:54,800 --> 02:51:55,633
You were amazing when you talked to the 
underground bunker guy who was going to 

3577
02:51:57,651 --> 02:51:59,510
start a call now.
That was intense,

3578
02:51:59,511 --> 02:52:00,344
man.
I'll never forget driving around in 

3579
02:52:02,331 --> 02:52:03,164
that,
underneath that mountain with that guy 

3580
02:52:04,520 --> 02:52:06,130
was a pretty man.
God

3581
02:52:06,160 --> 02:52:11,160
has an underground mountain base like 
ready for the apocalypse in the space in

3582
02:52:12,160 --> 02:52:14,770
New Mexico or something where it was.
I can't remember man.

3583
02:52:14,771 --> 02:52:15,604
I just know it's out of nowhere renting.
You can rent a space like a park in a 

3584
02:52:20,421 --> 02:52:21,254
parking space and make your camper van,
but they had this like underneath this 

3585
02:52:24,791 --> 02:52:25,624
mountain,
there's,

3586
02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:28,330
you know,
he'd set up example homes that you could

3587
02:52:28,331 --> 02:52:29,680
live in,
in this paradise.

3588
02:52:29,681 --> 02:52:32,830
And he kept saying how like there's 
going to be a wine bar.

3589
02:52:32,860 --> 02:52:37,860
That's one thing he kept saying,
but everyone you know is dead.

3590
02:52:38,021 --> 02:52:38,854
But there was a woman,
but it was weird is that you got out of 

3591
02:52:42,371 --> 02:52:44,710
him that he was kinda be going to kind 
of be the king.

3592
02:52:44,740 --> 02:52:45,880
That's right.
Yeah.

3593
02:52:45,881 --> 02:52:47,560
He was,
he was going to be in charge man.

3594
02:52:47,650 --> 02:52:52,650
And he had set up an rv with a little 
bit of astroturf in front of it and like

3595
02:52:54,161 --> 02:52:55,420
some playground equipment.

3596
02:52:55,420 --> 02:52:58,870
So like that's what the future looked 
like under there.

3597
02:52:58,871 --> 02:53:03,190
It's like your kids will be able to play
in the darkness of this massive cavern,

3598
02:53:03,580 --> 02:53:04,720
uh,
after,

3599
02:53:04,780 --> 02:53:05,613
after.
And he kept saying how they were about 

3600
02:53:06,851 --> 02:53:10,240
to have like an air tight door put in 
and really,

3601
02:53:10,330 --> 02:53:11,163
really spooky.
There's a lot of different places like 

3602
02:53:12,671 --> 02:53:15,880
that.
There's a lot of caverns that people are

3603
02:53:15,881 --> 02:53:20,650
planning on living in the progress.
This guy dig it out or did,

3604
02:53:20,690 --> 02:53:21,740
was it always those?
Uh,

3605
02:53:21,760 --> 02:53:25,200
the military had used it,
the military dug it out there.

3606
02:53:25,201 --> 02:53:28,360
We're using it as some kind of storage 
facility.

3607
02:53:28,361 --> 02:53:33,361
And so he bought it from them and then 
converted it to this like this.

3608
02:53:33,940 --> 02:53:34,773
Well,
theoretically dystopian future place 

3609
02:53:37,571 --> 02:53:40,120
that you go through to save yourself on 
the bombs go off.

3610
02:53:40,180 --> 02:53:41,013
Sounds like an alien movie.
Like they just didn't tell them that 

3611
02:53:43,031 --> 02:53:43,864
they're stored alien artifacts in the 
same location and while they're there 

3612
02:53:47,670 --> 02:53:48,503
that's cool.

3613
02:53:48,570 --> 02:53:51,520
It comes alive and like we have movement
in the corridor.

3614
02:53:51,521 --> 02:53:53,680
What?
It's nothing in the corridor but us,

3615
02:53:53,800 --> 02:53:54,633
we've double checked and triple checked.
Well we just found this manuscript and 

3616
02:53:58,300 --> 02:54:02,170
we're not sure what to make of that.
But if that's,

3617
02:54:02,580 --> 02:54:07,580
it sounds like the movie room to me,
you gonna see which rules a room roots.

3618
02:54:07,720 --> 02:54:08,553
It's about this woman who's like 
kidnapped by this dude who locks her in 

3619
02:54:11,951 --> 02:54:14,410
a room and rapes her and it's a terrible
thing,

3620
02:54:14,411 --> 02:54:15,244
but she has a kid and the kid doesn't 
know there's a world outside and so she 

3621
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:21,833
and she wants a kid to be happy,
so she tells them all these stories and 

3622
02:54:24,401 --> 02:54:25,234
all the stuff and the kid grows up in 
this garage basically thinking like 

3623
02:54:28,211 --> 02:54:30,910
that's the whole world.
And you think about it.

3624
02:54:30,911 --> 02:54:33,400
That's applicable to mean talking about 
a metaphor,

3625
02:54:33,460 --> 02:54:35,650
you know,
we're told what reality is,

3626
02:54:35,651 --> 02:54:37,210
we're told what to believe.

3627
02:54:37,220 --> 02:54:39,790
And so matrix,
it's all these things.

3628
02:54:39,880 --> 02:54:40,713
The Matrix gnosticism.
It's the idea that what we are in right 

3629
02:54:43,931 --> 02:54:44,764
now is actually a,
an interdimensional prison and we've 

3630
02:54:49,031 --> 02:54:53,560
been trapped by these super advanced 
beings that have kept us here called the

3631
02:54:53,561 --> 02:54:58,480
dark are cons and that they like,
they like power and authority.

3632
02:54:58,481 --> 02:54:59,690
And so,
um,

3633
02:55:00,010 --> 02:55:02,620
anybody.
So basically this idea,

3634
02:55:02,860 --> 02:55:03,693
I think it's called Discordian Asm,
but the idea is that because we are in 

3635
02:55:06,921 --> 02:55:07,754
an interdimensional prison where we've 
been had reality like where we like had 

3636
02:55:12,861 --> 02:55:17,060
this consensus reality given to us by 
people like Bernays,

3637
02:55:17,061 --> 02:55:17,894
chef Bernays,
who whipped up this reality tunnel that 

3638
02:55:19,791 --> 02:55:23,600
we're all existing in a because we are 
in this situation,

3639
02:55:23,910 --> 02:55:24,743
uh,
anyone in forcing the reality tunnel is 

3640
02:55:27,351 --> 02:55:28,184
a servant of the dark art con.
So anybody who's like trying to uphold 

3641
02:55:31,581 --> 02:55:32,414
this bullshit reality that we've all 
gotten trapped in there actually a form 

3642
02:55:36,111 --> 02:55:37,070
of Satanists.

3643
02:55:37,220 --> 02:55:38,053
And so as a religion or any time that 
you do anything to break a ridiculous 

3644
02:55:44,391 --> 02:55:45,224
rule,
anytime you do anything to break a 

3645
02:55:46,761 --> 02:55:47,594
mundane law,
anytime you do anything to subvert the 

3646
02:55:49,851 --> 02:55:52,100
authority of someone getting off on 
their power,

3647
02:55:52,370 --> 02:55:55,310
you are actually taking part in a kind 
of holy war.

3648
02:55:55,520 --> 02:55:56,353
And subverting this very ancient and 
terrible prison that all humanity is 

3649
02:56:00,861 --> 02:56:01,694
trapped in where people parade around as
though they have some kind of right to 

3650
02:56:06,051 --> 02:56:09,470
authority.
Kings being the classic case,

3651
02:56:09,710 --> 02:56:10,543
people used it.
They somehow convince people that they 

3652
02:56:12,261 --> 02:56:16,010
were gods on earth.
Clearly just human beings,

3653
02:56:16,011 --> 02:56:17,810
the ultimate liars.
You're not a god.

3654
02:56:17,811 --> 02:56:18,644
You're a human who's convinced as that 
you have some kind of power and so 

3655
02:56:21,561 --> 02:56:23,720
anytime you do anything to subvert those
people,

3656
02:56:23,960 --> 02:56:24,793
whether it's some fucking asshole,
he's wearing a crown and is convinced 

3657
02:56:27,291 --> 02:56:28,124
you that ease the divine being sent here
or whether it's some son of a bitch and 

3658
02:56:32,031 --> 02:56:35,120
one of those reality shows.
He's like going through your pockets for

3659
02:56:35,121 --> 02:56:35,954
weed.
Anytime you do anything to even disrupt 

3660
02:56:37,911 --> 02:56:42,530
that system a little bit,
you're doing a holy act in the great war

3661
02:56:42,531 --> 02:56:46,250
against the interdimensional prison 
keepers who are keeping us trapped here.

3662
02:56:46,490 --> 02:56:47,560
Look up this accordion ism.
Yeah,

3663
02:56:47,580 --> 02:56:48,710
that's awesome.
That's it.

3664
02:56:49,440 --> 02:56:53,970
Three hours in there.
I was going to say,

3665
02:56:53,971 --> 02:56:58,630
I can hear that rant already on youtube 
that people have already with,

3666
02:56:58,730 --> 02:57:02,760
with animation and fucking dark lords.
Ladies and gentlemen.

3667
02:57:02,761 --> 02:57:03,211
That's,
uh,

3668
02:57:03,211 --> 02:57:04,044
that's it though.
What are we calling this shrimp raid 

3669
02:57:06,940 --> 02:57:09,150
over folks?
Thank you everybody much.

3670
02:57:09,151 --> 02:57:10,080
Love.
See you soon.

3671
02:57:10,140 --> 02:57:10,973
Bye.
Bye.

3672
02:57:13,680 --> 02:57:14,650
That was great.
I got up,

3673
02:57:15,250 --> 02:57:17,430
I got to Pittsburgh.
