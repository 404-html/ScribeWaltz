1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello bitches.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,960
[inaudible] get it Puerto Rican beard.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:05,591
Yeah,

4
00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:07,810
I mean we could do a five hour
podcasts and just keep drinking.

5
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:08,644
I don't mind.

6
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,700
It's up to you dude.

7
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,870
But what's about,

8
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:11,470
uh,

9
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,640
two 15.

10
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,870
What time did we start this pitch?

11
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:14,704
1130.

12
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,290
Yeah,

13
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,410
we get it dirty barbers minutes.

14
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:21,520
I got a little tweezer thing or
a little clipboard right there.

15
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,291
You ready to do this shit,

16
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:23,890
Tommy?

17
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,723
Hold on Tommy.

18
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,500
Tommy's just decided this is happening.

19
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,000
No hold show.

20
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,880
Are you going to go with,

21
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:30,220
is a bunch of attachments to that Jammy?

22
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:35,370
Depending on how close and if you want
a sculptor or contour or anything along

23
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:36,514
those lines,

24
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,430
but are you going to try and
do the prints you think Tommy?

25
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,780
Um,

26
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,471
here's what I want to do.

27
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:42,304
I want to,

28
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,140
I want to bring all this out.

29
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,010
Bring that bottom out.

30
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:46,601
Okay.

31
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:46,871
Right,

32
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:47,121
right.

33
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:48,070
I'm put a nice line.

34
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:48,931
Yeah.

35
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:49,180
And then,

36
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:49,810
okay,

37
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,680
you're going to sculpt it.

38
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,010
Yeah,

39
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:51,201
yeah,

40
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:51,430
yeah.

41
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,540
This is going to be a pro job.

42
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,523
Okay.

43
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,970
What about the stash?

44
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,200
That's what I was saying.

45
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,190
I want to bring,

46
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,193
yes.

47
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,461
Oh,

48
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,294
what is this?

49
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,010
Oh my God.

50
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,930
I might have to be this,

51
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,281
but if he did that,

52
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:08,450
he's just going to shave that off.

53
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,160
Hold on a show that it looks so good.

54
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,900
Oh my God.

55
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,030
Oh my God.

56
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,440
Oh,

57
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,540
these fucking pictures.

58
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,670
A dude's beards.

59
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:27,710
It's so ridiculous.

60
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,610
There's nothing better
than the Jaguar guy though.

61
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:33,444
The Leopard Guy.

62
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,690
Pretty guys off the charts.

63
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,580
I gotta put this on my phone too,

64
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:40,620
because I don't want to show
my daughter and hold it.

65
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,190
Hold on.

66
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,371
No,

67
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:41,551
no,

68
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:41,701
no,

69
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:41,851
no,

70
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:41,971
no.

71
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:42,331
Hold on.

72
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:44,990
I'll just wide angle so
I can move over there.

73
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,353
Okay.

74
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,850
I'm gonna move over here.

75
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,470
She guys with a beard is my on it.

76
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:55,810
Total gut health and

77
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,150
oh shit.

78
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:01,880
Oh really?

79
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,330
I put it,

80
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,880
I should put it in like a a ramp.

81
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,723
Want me to hold it?

82
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,481
No,

83
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:07,190
I'll give it left this out.

84
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,633
Uh,

85
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,310
be happy.

86
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,160
I want you to be a part of it.

87
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:11,720
I don't want you to know
I'm right here though.

88
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,051
I know,

89
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:14,870
but I don't want you to have to focus
on me on you're holding it and give me

90
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:15,471
that fucking thing.

91
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:16,304
Shut up.

92
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,283
I'm right here.

93
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,670
I'm just going to rest it right here.

94
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,510
Drive.

95
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,890
Am I getting Harrell in me right now?

96
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:22,724
Tom,

97
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,070
you're going to get a
little bit of hair on you.

98
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,500
Hold on.

99
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:24,801
Let's,

100
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:25,730
let's tighten this up.

101
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,091
Oh,

102
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:27,410
you got your passwords,

103
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:28,010
Hun?

104
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,843
Oh,

105
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,531
it's a four,

106
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:30,711
four,

107
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:30,950
eight,

108
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,190
seven,

109
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,780
seven.

110
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,613
All right.

111
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,920
Good luck finding my phone.

112
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,131
Wow.

113
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:37,910
He's just now on it became a challenge.

114
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,950
Just like the weight loss challenge.

115
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,623
Syphilis.

116
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,370
Hold on,

117
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,203
hold on.

118
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,710
Fuck with my hair.

119
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:49,550
Like my actually hair.

120
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,241
Hold on.

121
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:51,074
Hold on.

122
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:51,840
No,

123
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:51,931
no,

124
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:52,060
no.

125
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,720
Give me a landscape in which

126
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,420
landscape landscape.

127
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:59,440
Flip it this way and now I'm going to
have to do the fucking anything on this.

128
00:02:59,590 --> 00:02:59,921
Okay.

129
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:02,350
Hit stop record and I hit record.

130
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,041
Okay,

131
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,000
we're recording right now.

132
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,211
Okay.

133
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:04,720
Hold on.

134
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,471
I'm putting this here.

135
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:07,480
I'm going to take a Bert Kreischer.

136
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:09,910
Please explain to the people
it's about to happen and why

137
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,330
my beard is getting shaved because I
challenged Tommy bonds on a beer challenge

138
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:21,040
on who lost was most weight and he lost
a collective like six pounds more than

139
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:21,874
me.

140
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,373
I failed.

141
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,310
Go ahead.

142
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,980
But you did succeed in
losing a ton of weight.

143
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,431
I lost.

144
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:29,840
I lost 35 pounds I think so I,

145
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,091
I,

146
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:32,620
I'm happy that at least
I'm not as fat as I am.

147
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,454
Just start.

148
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,620
What if you look better before we do this?

149
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,270
I will not better.

150
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,590
What if you decide like,

151
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:39,800
I like the new Burke.

152
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,833
Maybe the new,

153
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,310
it's new bird doesn't,

154
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,203
doesn't right

155
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,031
Taj things.

156
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:46,864
Maybe the new birth,

157
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,330
but this new film already
uncomfortable with this.

158
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,363
Can we go?

159
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,720
So Tommy Burns insisted in
shaving a beautiful pattern.

160
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,730
I've worked so hard on that area.

161
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,930
You worked on.

162
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,763
What did you do?

163
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,990
I just grew it out and I sculpted it

164
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,030
all sculpted area vulnerability.

165
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,073
How's it scope?

166
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,400
But what I do is I,

167
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:14,070
I went to a black barbershop
and I told them that,

168
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:15,280
that people might cut my beard.

169
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,703
He taught them,

170
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,280
I asked him,

171
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,113
ask them,

172
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,580
where's the microphone on these things.

173
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,080
I might've had my fucking finger over the
microphone on your cell phone is okay.

174
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,940
I hope I don't.

175
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,121
No,

176
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:36,570
I don't.

177
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,210
I don't.

178
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,860
I'll fill you on the podcast
then to be going really hard.

179
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,260
No,

180
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,430
no.

181
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,263
It looked good.

182
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,540
So you're sculpting you.

183
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,150
You're not entirely shaving it off.

184
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:45,984
Tommy,

185
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,200
talking to the microphone please.

186
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,980
Soap Bar Tommy.

187
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,010
Why we decided to go high.

188
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,280
That's one of the yard as Amy Jo Jawline.

189
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,761
Tommy,

190
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:58,670
why have you decided sculpted
and not completely shave it off?

191
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,710
I see this is a guy where like I see
so much potential and I just want it.

192
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,920
I want it to maximize like,

193
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,641
oh,

194
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,474
where are you going to work?

195
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,970
Your phone is exploding
with text messages.

196
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,380
While I'm holding this up,

197
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,290
I could barely look at it because
the screen keeps fill it up with

198
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,380
he's giving you a Hitler son.

199
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,111
Oh my God,

200
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:28,130
this is so stupid.

201
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,290
What's wrong with us?

202
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,630
We're all adults.

203
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,650
What the fuck is wrong with us?

204
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,150
Oh my God.

205
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,000
Can I please see it?

206
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,303
God.

207
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,680
Oh my God.

208
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,030
So you're doing the prince.

209
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:58,930
Oh my God,

210
00:05:58,931 --> 00:05:59,764
I can't breathe.

211
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,693
Oh,

212
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,713
cool.

213
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,393
Huh?

214
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,100
Is this the first time
you save another man?

215
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,993
Oh yeah,

216
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,580
but I've thought about it a lot.

217
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,390
I still feel the same right now.

218
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:54,820
Jimmy,

219
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,660
what about Costco?

220
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,400
What are we doing?

221
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,233
What are we doing?

222
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,510
You can't drink right down,

223
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:58,960
son.

224
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,793
You're in labor.

225
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,730
You given birth to the new bird.

226
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,420
Oh,

227
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,620
this is hilarious.

228
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,553
Tommy,

229
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,513
you an artist,

230
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,410
you know he used to do Tommy.

231
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,313
What's that?

232
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,210
Once a year

233
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,980
offering this sculpt a fan's beard.

234
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,710
You're a God damn artists dude.

235
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,973
Good job.

236
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,050
It looks amazing.

237
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,530
Really?

238
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,810
He should be the new thing that people do.

239
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,570
Go back to like sculpting beards.

240
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,240
That could be a show

241
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,310
that could be show he sees as
all the fluid I have on my body.

242
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:47,370
This could be a show you do on the travel
channel where a y'all get fucked up

243
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,380
and you get someone and
you shave their beard.

244
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,870
He barrier right there.

245
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,793
Oh Shit.

246
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,860
Wait Til your voice.

247
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,250
Don't go too hard on high

248
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,083
vulnerability.

249
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,243
Oh,

250
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,350
you look really good.

251
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:06,960
Accurate.

252
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,300
Really?

253
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:07,590
Yeah.

254
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,220
For Real.

255
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,710
Yeah.

256
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,190
You're going to like this.

257
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,580
This,

258
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,413
this.

259
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,750
This might be the greatest,

260
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,470
greatest time I've ever had been applied.

261
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:19,380
We guys were pretty clinic yet.

262
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:19,871
All right,

263
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:21,070
so for people just listening,

264
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,950
what Tom has done is sculpt birds,

265
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:28,951
beard in what could best be described as
a fencer for the 16 hundreds in France.

266
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,770
Offense her.

267
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,950
Yeah.

268
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,640
He looked like he do that or a,

269
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:43,410
or someone who would lie
about being Puerto Rican
cause they're really from like

270
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,030
somewhere that no one's ever heard of
and they're tired of people saying,

271
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:50,020
where the fuck is that?

272
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:50,330
And they go,

273
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,090
it's,

274
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:51,270
yeah,

275
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,150
I'm just Puerto Rican.

276
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,193
Have a look.

277
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,890
He looks very Spanish Mike.

278
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:57,780
But New York city fly.

279
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,070
You might stick with it.

280
00:08:59,610 --> 00:08:59,870
You,

281
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,510
you might.

282
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:00,691
Oh,

283
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:01,524
Brill.

284
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,700
He's a goddamn artists.

285
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,830
Imagine if it turns out the Tommy Buns
is the premiere beard artists in North

286
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:08,664
America.

287
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,973
I mean,

288
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,510
people are watching this and wants to,

289
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,550
the way really,

290
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,680
how many people are watching this?

291
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,083
4,000.

292
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,630
That's so ridiculous.

293
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,910
I feel like you might
really be happy with it.

294
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,823
Okay.

295
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,160
Where are you going to keep this or
are you going to turn to me please?

296
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,270
Huh?

297
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,420
That's actually not bad
and I'm not bullshitting.

298
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,260
I'm not bullshitting at all.

299
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:35,011
I don't want to be surprised.

300
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:35,844
Let me see.

301
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,410
I'm not bullshitting you.

302
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,230
Look good dog.

303
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,063
This field.

304
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,111
Here's the thing,

305
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:40,740
man.

306
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,573
Look at your,

307
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,420
I looked like I work at blue.

308
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,263
The apes.

309
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,910
I look at it.

310
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,250
No,

311
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:49,830
no,

312
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,663
this is not

313
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,510
Joe t doesn't good.

314
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,070
Look at all the hair on me.

315
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,380
You get an earring on each year.

316
00:09:58,381 --> 00:09:59,214
A big hoop,

317
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,323
but I look like,

318
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,140
I feel like you rent the jetskis for sure,

319
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,120
but the heat through like
what are you good idea

320
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,730
to fucking Jane Hula Hoop earrings.

321
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,303
Take your phone

322
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,433
buddy.

323
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,550
Oh my God.

324
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,463
It looks pretty good.

325
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,400
Yeah.

326
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,731
Oh,

327
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:22,750
Holy Shit.

328
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,350
Look,

329
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,090
can you see yourself performing like that?

330
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,823
Fuck yeah.

331
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,221
Yeah,

332
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:27,760
of course.

333
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,930
You have to for a while,

334
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:29,740
right?

335
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,573
What?

336
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,990
I'm going to shave it off tonight.

337
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:32,380
No,

338
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:32,681
no,

339
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:32,890
no.

340
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,200
You should definitely go
on stage for the audience.

341
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,630
The people that are going to appreciate,

342
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,790
they want to see you knowing
exactly what happened.

343
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,090
That's the second book.

344
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,153
He's got to fix it.

345
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,090
It's not done.

346
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:43,301
You know?

347
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:44,051
That's what weird.

348
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:48,160
We never really determined when
he's done so Tom can make step back,

349
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,190
look at it and decide to do some changes.

350
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:53,771
Oh my God,

351
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:54,640
he found the rash.

352
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,901
Yeah,

353
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:56,680
man.

354
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,850
Sometimes we have rashes.

355
00:10:57,851 --> 00:10:58,684
Ladies and gentlemen,

356
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,950
it's not your fault.

357
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,230
I know you feel like you
did something naughty,

358
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:04,030
that the Lord punished you with a rash,

359
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,650
but that's just superstitious

360
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:06,610
crashes.

361
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,443
In fact,

362
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,350
a really bacterial infections on the
surface of your skin feels so weird.

363
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:14,590
It's definitely better now
are I recommend defense soap.

364
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,710
I'm say I say just a mustache.

365
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,480
Fuck all that squirrely
little bottom here.

366
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,950
If you want to make them
keep it for a while.

367
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:21,311
Yeah,

368
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:22,031
I'll keep it for a while.

369
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:22,541
I'm a grown man.

370
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:22,740
I'll go.

371
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,240
Let me shave my mustache.

372
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:24,490
Okay,

373
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,323
how about this?

374
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,860
We get rid of all this crazy shit.

375
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,910
Now I know what it looks like.

376
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:29,740
Give you a goddamn police things mustache,

377
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:30,574
man.

378
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,440
You actually look like I
look like a monkey for real.

379
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,310
Let me see you.

380
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,480
You looked like he looked like a
top notch bowler from Wisconsin.

381
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,750
Here dude is on like world series of
bowling and everybody fears you like the

382
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:45,700
Bill Murray character.

383
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,890
Can you imagine making out with
me in the dark and you're like,

384
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:50,200
what does that on the top it
would be covered in the beard.

385
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,370
What was that movie?

386
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,610
Fucking break kingpin.

387
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,181
Was that movie?

388
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:55,701
Good source.

389
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:56,501
Flirt with a girl and he goes,

390
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:57,334
not you.

391
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,203
Yeah,

392
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,560
yeah.

393
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,393
Oh Man.

394
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,320
Remember when,

395
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,910
uh,

396
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,200
we had to have sex with his landlord
and order to pay for the rent.

397
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,640
Nothing like that to loosen up,

398
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:07,474
but shit,

399
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,760
throw it up into the toilet.

400
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,721
You remember that?

401
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:10,940
He,

402
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,770
um,

403
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,670
he has the planned like
robbery with the guy and then,

404
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,633
uh,

405
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,973
sorry,

406
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,693
my face in it.

407
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:22,691
Then he,

408
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:22,840
uh,

409
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,490
he throws hot coffee in that guy's
face because he has to act like that.

410
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:28,450
It wasn't a scam.

411
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:28,731
You know,

412
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:28,920
like,

413
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,130
like the landlord comes and he's like,

414
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:30,730
what?

415
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,360
You're here and you just takes the hot
coffee and splashing in the guy fucking

416
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:35,380
screens for his life.

417
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,820
Jesus Christ.

418
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,920
This feels so weird,

419
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:38,240
Huh?

420
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,670
This looks so,

421
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,670
I can only imagine.

422
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,351
It feels weird.

423
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:43,570
So I didn't know my face will
be this close to my bones.

424
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,690
Well do do you guys view,

425
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,350
just don't do it like this,

426
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,310
like this craziness,

427
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,500
but just keep going healthy style,

428
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:51,840
you know?

429
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,030
I mean we've got to figure out
a way to get you guys to not,

430
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,130
I mean,

431
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:57,963
let's be honest,

432
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,493
if you're not,

433
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,940
there's no way to do it.

434
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,950
Like if you,

435
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,321
if you,

436
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:03,154
if you,

437
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,960
if there is a target weight,

438
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,460
you're going to dehydrate yourself,

439
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:06,880
right?

440
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,031
Yeah,

441
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:08,080
of course you're going to,

442
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:08,800
you never know.

443
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,750
Very seldom does someone go,

444
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,943
I'll get below that.

445
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,460
You Post that picture of me,

446
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,810
the dog to me right now we're
going to get totally used to it,

447
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:18,640
but I do suggest you keep the mustache.

448
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,250
I think it's a wonderful
accoutrement to your face.

449
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,670
Okay.

450
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,070
It helps you party man image and again
you'll kill your curling champion from

451
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,950
Saskatchewan.

452
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,430
It looks like a duck hunting guide
is a totally different person.

453
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,300
So wild to do head shots while

454
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,850
you live at a guy who teaches
people how to fly fish.

455
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,210
The guy that knows the
difference in a Mallard duck.

456
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,261
Exactly.

457
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,680
Less a diver duck.

458
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,920
Totally different kind of meat.

459
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,920
You look how you definitely
don't live in your hometown

460
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,240
and you got to Pennzoil Tattoo.

461
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,190
I like this bond a mustache.

462
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:03,940
How's it look good?

463
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,780
He looks really good.

464
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,111
Really?

465
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:05,560
Yeah.

466
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,550
You should see it closer.

467
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,740
Let me see your Instagram.

468
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,620
I do think there's something to be
said for bringing back a mustache.

469
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,710
There's a few people who do
it and it's a strong look.

470
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,581
No,

471
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:16,271
it looks good.

472
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:17,770
It looks like they're look stuff up there.

473
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,723
Oh,

474
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,571
uh Oh.

475
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:20,620
I need to get my teeth cleaned.

476
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,031
Jesus.

477
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:23,140
This just looks sad.

478
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,630
No.

479
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,580
Oh,

480
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:25,751
it looks actually,

481
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:29,290
I guess it looks like a guy
who lost a fuck ton of weight,

482
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,990
just not to win a competition.

483
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,080
A mustache.

484
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,220
You rock this look and
you go back up to two 56

485
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,460
that would be a,

486
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,600
that would be an interesting.
