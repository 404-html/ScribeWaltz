1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,290
The joe rogan experience is another
lesson I learned that I have to remember

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:04,501
four,

3
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:05,100
I forget,

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,610
um,

5
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,860
that I learned about the movie business.

6
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:11,520
Dave had a fucking great
movie called the wrong guy.

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,120
Yeah.

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,720
And it was a great movie
and we went to see it.

9
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:18,450
I think Brian Keaulana went to say it
with me and we were fucking howling.

10
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:18,871
And I was like,

11
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:19,441
Holy Shit,

12
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:20,790
David's going to be a huge movie star.

13
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:21,930
There's going to be a huge movie.

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,820
And I remember watching it going like,

15
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:26,310
this is like one of the best
comedies I've seen in years.

16
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,020
And then nothing.

17
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,561
Yeah.

18
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:29,670
Disney shelved it.

19
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,810
Yeah.

20
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,140
Well what happened was how Hollywood
pictures was our distributor Disney.

21
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,650
Then they shut Hollywood pictures
down in the middle of production.

22
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,350
And then when we were done,

23
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:41,580
they reopened Hollywood pictures,

24
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:45,420
but with the new president of Hollywood
pictures and he didn't want to touch any

25
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:49,020
of this stuff so that the other guy
had started and always are like that.

26
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,190
Because if it's there,

27
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,270
if it's a failure,

28
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:52,170
it's their failure.

29
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:52,460
Yeah.

30
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,550
But if it's a success,

31
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:54,900
it's the other guy success.

32
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,160
So they just don't deal with it.

33
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,330
So they uh,

34
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,370
so got shelved for like five years.

35
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,080
Like they would even admit they had it,

36
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,140
so it never had a theatrical release.

37
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,680
Never got theatrical release.

38
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:05,820
So it's available on DVD,

39
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:06,020
right.

40
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,580
Can't get it on amazon.com
on Amazon right now.

41
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,181
Really?

42
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:10,740
Well then the people just
probably pick that up.

43
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:10,981
Yeah,

44
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:13,620
I'm going to pick it up right now with
some one click while we're doing the

45
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,473
podcast.

46
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,983
It's actually what I'm,

47
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,740
one of the things I'm proudest of is that
movie like creatively and comedically.

48
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,520
It was brilliant.

49
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,230
You know it air it goes,

50
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,850
watch this one click.

51
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,440
Oh Don,

52
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,221
it's that easy.

53
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:26,700
People.

54
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,990
I love amazon.com.

55
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,441
Yeah,

56
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:29,730
that was a brilliant fucking movie.

57
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:30,750
It was really fun.

58
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,710
I enjoy the shit out of it and I know,

59
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,430
I remember you guys all
coming out to see it though,

60
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,840
that screening and yeah.

61
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,211
Yeah.

62
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:39,390
And I remember thinking after is over
after the whole thing where it didn't work

63
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,081
out and it never got,

64
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:40,410
I'm like,

65
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:40,661
wow,

66
00:01:40,661 --> 00:01:41,370
well this is uh,

67
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,600
this business is crazy.

68
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,190
Like this place just
doesn't make any sense.

69
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,330
I know because we really thought we,

70
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:45,571
you know,

71
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:46,710
we were clear cause we had,

72
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:46,891
you know,

73
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:47,730
the big thing was always,

74
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,470
well if you're doing an independent film,

75
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:50,820
can you get distribution?

76
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,040
And we went into it with distribution.

77
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,800
We had Disney lined up
in the script phase,

78
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,663
you know,

79
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,211
uh,

80
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:59,010
so we had distribution
line that we had produced,

81
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,883
even had,

82
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,750
uh,

83
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,420
we were even in profit in foreign sales.

84
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:03,930
Wow.

85
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,300
While we were shooting the
movie based on a trailer.

86
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:06,990
Whoa.

87
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,130
That was taken to can,

88
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,270
so,

89
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,541
uh,

90
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:10,170
we had,

91
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,340
we had advanced sales,

92
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,880
foreign sales that put the movie
in profit while we were shooting,

93
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,490
but they were all
contingent on a US release.

94
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,190
It seems like you could get a meeting
and talk to the new head guy and go,

95
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,900
oh we do.

96
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,150
Oh,

97
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,180
we tried it for years.

98
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,230
Oh thank you.

99
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,640
We'll make a big deal.

100
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:28,140
We'll do press releases.

101
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,430
Yes.

102
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,380
And Oh yeah.

103
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,370
We tried talking to Disney for years and
they just wouldn't have anything to do

104
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:33,204
with it now.

105
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,253
Wow.

106
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:34,880
Other,

107
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,320
there were other people even tried to
buy it from Disney and they wouldn't sell

108
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:37,530
it.

109
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,130
Really?

110
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,670
Yeah.

111
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,091
Wow.

112
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,440
Because of the emphasis success,

113
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:41,310
then they fucked up.

114
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,173
Yeah.

115
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,840
Wow.

116
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,340
What a creepy fucking business.

117
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:46,080
You wonder why Dave
Chappelle went to Africa.

118
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,910
Yeah.

119
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,600
Yeah.

120
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:47,820
Well,

121
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,420
and it's beautiful.
