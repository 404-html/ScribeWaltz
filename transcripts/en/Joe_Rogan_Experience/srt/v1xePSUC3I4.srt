1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,500
Hi. Four three, two, one

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,550
fresh from fucking dope.

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,360
I want to learn the motherland.
You were in the motherland for days.

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,030
The mother land,

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,390
now it's the motherland is sort
of a one quarter of my heritage.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,720
The capital of fighting, that's for
sure. [inaudible] is an Irish name.

7
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:31,650
I don't know what if you know that lad,
is it really? I'm one quarter Irish.

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,340
Everyone out there,
I'll bring Grogin out him like,

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,830
what do you want me talking to him,
man? Oh, can you try Rashawn shit.

10
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,430
Fucking animals, Bro. Favorite place
I've ever been. Really? Yeah, man,

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,720
it does a savage. They're just, they're
not even saying that they're savages.

12
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:52,930
They're super friendly. So friendly.
Not that people were, you know,

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,720
in Australia or London or Manchester
weren't, but in Dublin they were like,

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,430
I was like, damn, I don't want
to leave man. Look, I loved it.

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,320
I was thinking yesterday
when I was watching,

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,590
I'm like Conor McGregor workout
and like all the people,

17
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:06,030
we're surrounded him
while I was working out,

18
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:08,040
you know when those open
workouts real weird. Yeah.

19
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,260
It was the only standing around
hitting the bag and he's,

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,380
he seems to just be doing his work,
doing his normal work, you know,

21
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:17,340
hitting the bag. But there's just a
circle of people like right there,

22
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,880
he's a lion. Oh Sally, that
he can't even move. No,

23
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,880
he can't like dance around.
He can't back up too much.

24
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,270
He's just right in front of that bag and
he's got to pretend those people aren't

25
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:30,900
there as he works in the show. Right.
It's just a show to hype the fight more,

26
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,140
I guess it is in the box. And Pierce
Make Fun of them cause movement.

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,070
They won't make fun of him if he
lands the way he did it in that clip.

28
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,220
Opale that's what I'm saying.
When he landed that straight left,

29
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,040
but lamb and snap Paulie's head
back. I'm like, Hey Paulie,

30
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,930
why didn't you talk about that?
He's says he's been on a tear.

31
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,430
Just adds all really significant.

32
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,550
But if a guy like Conor McGregor does
that desk straight and clean and sneaky

33
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,530
announces to m and a little off speed,

34
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,060
like a little off speed and the
initial part of the movement,

35
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,590
then he drops it in. Bang.
It's like snake like left hand,

36
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,390
like he's getting super comfortable.

37
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:09,930
If he can do that to Pauline Mala noche
like whatever you say about those clips.

38
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,840
All we know is that that's,
that's what we've seen.

39
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,750
We've only seen these little short
little clips like white here.

40
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:20,510
Watch this left hand, which
I sneaks this in. Boom.

41
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,423
Sign

42
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,360
on to that left hand is fucking
legit cause it's super legit.

43
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:31,040
Here it is again.
Why is this?

44
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,660
Yeah Dude, that is down the
pipe. Caught what you want.

45
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,120
I mean granted that's the 12th round but
still parked at the time world champion.

46
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,630
I don't know what round though
was. I don't care. I don't care.

47
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,590
You can do that with that kind of speed
to Pauline Mala Naji and time that like

48
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:53,570
that. That's slut. Look, you can't
sleep on him. He's got magic.

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,440
Doesn't always work.
That's what does know.

50
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,310
His work is kind of new
ideas has a little magic to

51
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,270
different type of magic,
but that you know in that fight,

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,680
Nate Diaz had the magic and it was
just not Connor's nine. But the rain,

53
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,220
which was college, no, not
really. No, I don't think it was.

54
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,050
I think the rematch was bolted.
They're night.

55
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,260
I think if you really want to look at
that fight, honestly the second fight,

56
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,640
I don't think you see a winner.

57
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,900
The only thing that I think you could say
makes Connor winter is that he dropped

58
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,300
Nate but Napleton,

59
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,040
but Nate was saying that he went down
with punches anyway because he was hoping

60
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,800
Connor would follow him to the ground,
which may or may not be true,

61
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,650
but it is a good strategy if you have
a wind watching sport way too long that

62
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,890
Nate's got a wicked guard we can decide
like to get like when he gets clipped

63
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,250
just to go down with it and to try
to bring him to the ground. Look,

64
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:45,940
Fabrizio does that for resale for
doom. Absolutely does that. He does.

65
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:49,630
He'll do it right. Getting dropped
in the face with a left hand. Well,

66
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,730
it was a very good shot,
no doubt about it.

67
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,640
But the idea is if you get hit with a
good shot, you can decide to go down.

68
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,170
Then you can decide to bait
a man three times in a row.

69
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,040
I think you have to take
it into consideration as a
possibility once am I need a

70
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,790
rolling B every time he would try it,
try it. You're right. We never have,

71
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,910
he doesn't have these tendencies. Doing
all the same salary really fucked up.

72
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:15,100
Nate in a fight is Josh Thompson.

73
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,970
Josh Thompson head kicked
him and every other fight.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,580
Even when he's gotten beat
up like the dos Anjos fight,

75
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,150
he's got his legs beat up and dos
Anjos definitely want a decision.

76
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,360
Nate didn't get fucked up and stop
stopped. He's never got his ass whooped.

77
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,080
Josh is the only one stopped him.
Yeah, but he still never got it.

78
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:33,520
Like is that never gets asked what?
Well, let me know what you could say.

79
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:36,760
The dos Anjos fight was kind of a beating
that they'll sign geosys kicking the

80
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:41,110
shit out of his. He still coming forward
like stood upset. He never been broke.

81
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:45,100
You can say that they've never broke as
well. 100% even in the Thompson fight.

82
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:45,761
If they let it go,

83
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:48,610
he probably would have
recovered eventually if he
didn't go on car. Correct. See,

84
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:51,310
I think the,
the real test of who's better,

85
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:55,270
Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz is if they
fight at 55 and the trilogy fight cause

86
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:58,610
70 it's a tossup. You know, Nate, one
one, Connor one one that's whatever.

87
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,220
They're both not fun at 70 they go to 55
you have your true I think winter there.

88
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,270
Well, you know what I mean? I like
native 55 me too at her anyway,

89
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,980
he gets real lean.

90
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:13,981
Like in the Michael Johnson fight comes
to destroy Johnson shredded at the man

91
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:17,710
was just check, check, check, check.

92
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,920
I'm assuming that's what he's waiting
for because they've often fights. Right.

93
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,050
But he's just waiting until
that big Conor payday,

94
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,010
I think him and his brother were smart.
You know, there are huge cultural icons.

95
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:29,760
They can go places and get paid and um,

96
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,660
they're still in the mix for, you
know, whatever weight class 155 or 70.

97
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,470
If he wants to be suspended for a
long, very long, just kind of pay.

98
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,840
He's just got a pay does not. Yeah.
It's not a suspension anymore. It is,

99
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:47,560
is he owes them $100,000
and he won't give it so,

100
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,020
so gangster one 65,
I think he gave him like 65.

101
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,370
You can argue that though, like
remote with common are like, listen,

102
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:58,080
you're suspended. You're not fighting.
You got to shoot a forestry mail

103
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,520
that day as soon as shoot or bullying
commercial and pays 175,000 comment. Cool.

104
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,320
Just not find Vegas though it.
Yeah, I know. No money. Uh,

105
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,520
just a 15 second tweet and then we'll,
we'll let you fight here.

106
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,920
But you got to realize when
a guy's throwing a monster
energy drink and they're

107
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,480
thrown water bottles, this is, I don't
like to say this, but this is true.

108
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,120
Does a big part of what's going on there.

109
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:23,620
That is theatrical [inaudible] that's
no different than pro-wrestling called

110
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:26,150
cell and a fine, it's called salad.
A fight and that's they're doing,

111
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,620
they're throwing shit at each other.
Sound effects.

112
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,180
Do you think he's really trying to incite
a riot like you know, occasionally, yes.

113
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:35,740
Like the DC John Jones. Thank that
was legit. Different animals animal.

114
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,440
And how much of that sell the
fight? The UFC was like, oh,

115
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,900
let's just keep that in nonstop.
And then they're like,

116
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,350
we do not approve of this. This is
ridiculous. Show it one more time.

117
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:49,270
Show it again one more time. I love
that though. That's clip ever. Yeah,

118
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,080
they did. They capitalize. I don't know
if they did on the John Challenge saying,

119
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,390
you know I did cocaine a week before
I beat your ass. No, they didn't.

120
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,940
That was the greatest light.
The most savage line f her ever.

121
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,000
Jon Jones is no joke.
And Jon Jones like in shape,

122
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:09,210
but something approved like
he did against Carmine's.

123
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,970
Scared so scared when he
kicked him in the face.

124
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,310
My word about how the fact that he says
the exact perfect thing after the fights

125
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:23,840
over. Correct. About Daniel or mark about
Daniel's. It's just, you know, I mean,

126
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:26,200
it's still real for the
first time too. Yeah, I be,

127
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,720
he probably felt so much gratitude,
you know, when I said to him like,

128
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,240
I didn't know what I was going to
say to him, but when I said to him,

129
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:34,730
you made it back.
That's how I felt like,

130
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,650
not just that he made
it back to the title,

131
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:40,010
but like you made it back from the
dark lands, from life, from the back,

132
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,570
running away from a hit and run accident
with w who knows what the fuck you've

133
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:47,870
got on you. You know, all that made
it backs understatement. I mean,

134
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,700
homeboy and people never stopped
cheering for him. Very interesting.

135
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,770
You know, people were mad at
DC who DC, but then John Jones,

136
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,050
his fame went up. Pregnant lady
broke her arm and ran from the scene.

137
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,210
It's crazy. I don't
understand. First of all,

138
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:08,780
I don't understand how you could not
be a fan of DC. I don't understand it.

139
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't understand. There's
nothing wrong with them. Like what?

140
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,240
What would you not be a fan of?
The guy's a fucking animal. He's,

141
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,290
he won the Strikeforce heavyweight.
GRANDPA defeated at him. I mean,

142
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:23,000
he's throwing around Josh Barnett,
who's a 255 pound gorilla,

143
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,350
Daniel Cormier hoisting spiked.

144
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,900
He's macho man. I mean, the guy gets
into MMA fairly late in his career,

145
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,470
right?

146
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:38,470
Massively successful amateur wrestler
gets into MMA and says running through

147
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,040
people has a fight.

148
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,820
The first fight in the UFC as against
frank fucking mirror beats the pants off

149
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:47,660
of a former UFC heavyweight champion
your first fight in the UFC and beat the

150
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,100
breaks and beats the brakes off.
I mean,

151
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:51,400
it wasn't satisfied and it's
still whooped his ass. Yeah,

152
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,330
I mean got the under hooking did work.

153
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,730
It's just people like people got at him
for the Anderson Silva fight that he

154
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:58,890
like held. Anderson Silva
[inaudible] me a little bit too.

155
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,920
Like I can see why fans like come on man.

156
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,630
Anderson Silva two day notice or
whatever the hell it was. Come on.

157
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:07,390
But Harrison front kicked him in the
gut. Remember that? Yeah. Her, her layers

158
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,631
especially,

159
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:13,530
you'll see 200 such a big card and there's
so much hope when you don't perform,

160
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,650
you're like, come on man. And with
DC, I think the biggest thing is,

161
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,670
and it's not his fault,

162
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,240
he's better than everyone in the world
at light heavyweight except for John

163
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,210
Jones. So when John left and he had the
title, people are like, that's fake.

164
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,900
That's not his fault. It's not
his fault. John, be mad at John.

165
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:32,901
Could you imagine if you could get
Daniel's brain inside rumbles body?

166
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,120
Oh my God, that doesn't happen. Right?

167
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:37,950
Isn't that interesting
how that doesn't happen?

168
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,100
It's like John John's is the closest
thing to guy who's got insane talent,

169
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,120
but he also has like, almost
like dad, Darryl Elkins,

170
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,920
Darren Elkins, rather. Um, the Darren
Elkins mentality of like never quit. Like,

171
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,210
remember when he got his arm?

172
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,980
Hyperextended but if you don't feel bad
by [inaudible], his arm was fucked up,

173
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,390
never tapped. You know, like when
he fought the Gustafson find,

174
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,930
he wasn't in shape at all and
went five of five hard rounds,

175
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,790
which is two matters,
the best fight ever.

176
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,850
And was winning the final
round or about what?

177
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:14,910
Against Ryan Bader who ran painters
fricking good I think at times. Right?

178
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,670
Four or five in the world
doesn't even really train.

179
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,720
They said they saw him like two days
and went in there and cradle him like a

180
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,240
baby and whooped his ass in
the first round. Beat his ass.

181
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,640
I mean it's just talking
about a different animal man.

182
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,900
Cause he's a different animal.

183
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:32,790
But he's also got this mindset like he
has a real champions mindset or it's like

184
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:36,030
rumbled doesn't really like to fight.
He's just super good at it.

185
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,040
You don't think rumble likes it?
He says he doesn't. Oh he says,

186
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,950
he says that he says he
doesn't want to fight anymore.

187
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,270
Since it was my brain trauma.

188
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,270
He doesn't want to be rolling
around with what you're saying.

189
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:47,600
I got that confused with DC.
No, we are rumbles. Rumble.

190
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,100
Rumble is like the scariest guy ever at
two oh five when it comes to striking,

191
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,260
like who fucks ever been
scarier than rumble?

192
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,850
Nobody owes to Meyer Pretty
Goddamn cold right now. Right? Who?

193
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:04,190
He's scary right now. Technique.
Just fucking, oh, he's got, he's got,

194
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,480
he's gay. Oh, to Jimmy Madeline. He was
like, you're, you're a power puncher.

195
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,470
Do Cool. Check this out
too. Interesting cat man.

196
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,990
Interesting cat number three was
e three in the world he'd, yeah,

197
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:17,370
he knocked out Sir coon off.

198
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,490
Right and knocked up Meesha and then just
Merck's Jimmy Manoa in for like walked

199
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:24,900
through and,
and called it too.

200
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:27,480
It's like I'm knocking out in the
first minute or so. I'm can go do it.

201
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:31,110
Jesus cry and Jimmy didn't even land
anything like inside this clinch.

202
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,370
She catches him with that hard left hook.
These, he's got hammers for Phis to bro,

203
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,000
but he's like rushing it. Hi Allie.
Did you know what I'm saying?

204
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:42,810
Like I calculated like a John or you know
like the jds where he's sitting back,

205
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,230
he's got confidence in his power.

206
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,430
I'm sure none of it is brick
hands to your shake his hand.

207
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,300
Oh apparently go Brock Lesnar style that
does that work against the gusts spin

208
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:55,490
and Jon Jones is the question out soon
because I'm a fucking might be champion

209
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,170
the world just 70 Twitter followers,

210
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,690
light heavyweight champion
of the UFC. He's like, fuck

211
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,850
just what you do bro. You
know what he's, he's, I dunno.

212
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,100
He's changing his nickname to know time.

213
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,120
Is that what he changed his nickname
too? That's an awful short time. No time.

214
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,770
Because like he points to his wife,

215
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,580
he was like pointing to his watch at the
time. That was like his move. Oh yeah,

216
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:22,360
no time. No time. Like after the fight
he was like pointing to his wife.

217
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:26,290
She's like, this is my new
nickname. I have no time. No time.

218
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,290
He's nasty man.
He's very nasty.

219
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,130
He's got real legit 100% one punch power.

220
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,570
And when he clipped here, wait clips
guys, you can see they're like, oh shit.

221
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,490
And he goes bananas on him. See, I think
they should do Gusman Jones. Right.

222
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,420
And then do those Demira verse DC.
We'll have to see,

223
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,320
wants to fight again. We're going to see.
He said he did. You see what he does?

224
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,650
He goes, not only I'm going to fighting
him, I'm going to fight John Again.

225
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,880
Give it upset.
My heart can't take it.

226
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,270
You think you should give it up and
it gets right back in there. Why not?

227
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,100
It was a good fight up until the moment
John Landa at high kick. I agree.

228
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:08,710
I don't think he ever beats John.
I think he might be right,

229
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:11,650
but you might be a problem and
then it gets even crazier. But see,

230
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:13,330
I don't think he's ever going
to get the fight either.

231
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,560
I don't want to see it again. It
certainly could. If he beats a few people.

232
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,340
You certainly could because you could play
clips of that fight and say, you know,

233
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:23,920
he was doing very well, not
fight. I think John was winning.

234
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:29,130
I think John was landing more volume
and he was mixing things up really well.

235
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,740
That was ring Russ to let,

236
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,520
that's John kind of feeling things
out and then once he got comfortable,

237
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,120
oh this is what we're doing. He didn't do
shit. He didn't seem ring rusty at all.

238
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,080
I see. I smooth right from the
beginning, a little smooth, but I,

239
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:43,540
I do think DC's pressure and stuff like
that and just getting under his feet and

240
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,300
once he did, then he started to tee
off and take over, I think. Yeah,

241
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:49,810
he found his rhythm and he found DC's
timing. You know, you started the,

242
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,610
and then they settled in a little bit too.

243
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:54,880
Once they get onto the Sacramento and
both guys had exerted quite a bit of

244
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:55,331
energy,

245
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:58,390
hit each other quite a few times and
that third round and then you're going to

246
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:00,640
be that, that I think those
DC's best chance to beat them.

247
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:05,500
Now John's off to the races now. Good
luck with no time. There's those de Meyer,

248
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,680
there's guests Finn, then
Brock Lesnar, yet Steve Bay,

249
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,250
I think it goes to heavyweight.
Who knows, man. I mean if,

250
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:16,910
if they work out some sort of a deal where
he fights Brock Lesnar, well, oh God.

251
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,700
Come on Joe Course Stairwell. When he
called them out at the end of the fight.

252
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,320
I was like,
oh my goodness,

253
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,550
I saw Brad Watch Salt Brad Pitt shadow
box on Instagram or you better be careful

254
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,660
son, UFC gonna reach outside
and you see a problem.

255
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,980
You got to watch your pit would
fuck cm punk show me too though.

256
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,650
They'll Brad Pitt from snatch,
you know? Also I think Brad Pitt,

257
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,600
that guy lived with Angelina Jolie
for like 10 years. No much rage.

258
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:44,720
He must have Penn doesn't hate him.

259
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Was Johnny Depp just or talk of organic
sustainable farming and adopting new

260
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:52,280
kids. Random kids. Who the fuck

261
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,870
is this? He just wants to
smash you. Just go in there,

262
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,230
fuck him up. Smash. Just
pit smashed on bitches.

263
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,740
Just so angry at, listen to that
crazy lady he lived with for decades,

264
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,270
made him an alcoholic.
Do you hear it?

265
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,940
That was a raging alcoholic and
she was a kid. He was, I love kids,

266
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:14,990
but there's a new one every goddamn day.
Like I can't keep a kid after kid.

267
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,820
Oh my God. Yeah. I mean that's just my
opinion. He would slap a bitch. I mean,

268
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:23,000
maybe she's a wonderful person. I
mean, she obviously is very charitable.

269
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,000
Maybe she's exhausted, exhausted.
That's the vibe I get. Hey Brown,

270
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:28,371
she took,

271
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:32,660
she had a vile of Billy Bob Thorton's
blood that she carried around her neck and

272
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:37,220
Billy Bob, I'm not hating on you, and
she was in his fucking beautiful. I get,

273
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:40,250
I can make time this then I didn't
get how people make mistakes.

274
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,250
He could let around your neck.
Hey, what are we going to do?

275
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:47,480
We're going to live for sure.
Shanique in bed for guy like him.

276
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,610
When's the guy like him get a girl,
girl like that.

277
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,610
The universities have to like collide.
That's will be some worm hole.

278
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,820
You've got to talk to
some such match shit.

279
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,150
She puts her your blood around her neck.
He's a bad motherfucker though.

280
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,960
She was strong. Dick game. She great.
Your blood around her neck, Joe.

281
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,900
I think they both did. They
were each other's blood. Yeah.

282
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:07,760
That's what they're doing.
They're both wearing each other's blood.

283
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,360
That's another level.
Not only that,

284
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,960
but here's the real problem with
it. You tell people about it. Yeah.

285
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:17,750
It just kept to yourself,
man. Telling people about it.

286
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:20,810
Tell people it's dragging blood or
some shit. When you tell it. It's hers.

287
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,160
A little weird. Well I think anybody
that's as good an actress as she is,

288
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,340
she's a really fucking good,
amazing. She's really good.

289
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,210
I think you have to have a
good percentage of crazy.

290
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:35,570
Like it's gotta be way up there
in the 90s actors too though.

291
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:38,570
I mean even for men like the
men actors who were really good,

292
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:42,680
like day to day Lewis motherfucker was a
shoe cobbler for six years just to play

293
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:44,820
like some 30 minute roll.
It's got legs.

294
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:50,290
He went full fucking cobbling working
as a cobbler right now and like London

295
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,480
assumption.
No,

296
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,310
I think he lives in Connecticut and
he makes furniture or some shit. God,

297
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,050
you never go full Louis Man. But
that's cause he's, he's legit.

298
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:03,140
Like that's really who we is.
Like an actual artist.

299
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,760
But that's why he's so interesting.

300
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,570
It's like his art or what
his mind goes towards.

301
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:12,750
It's not dictated by finance.
It's not dictated by the, the,

302
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,140
the box office success
you could potentially APP.

303
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,540
It's literally dictated by
what he's interested in.

304
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,310
He's interested in making shoes.

305
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:22,210
He's just going to make shoes like
you're not going to see him cast this

306
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,040
superman like he's like, that's not
his art. You know what I'm saying?

307
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,770
Admired the shit out of that because
people, we compromise all the time.

308
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,740
People are always compromising.
You're always like, you know,

309
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,210
trying to suck up to the boss,
hoping you get that raise or you know,

310
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:39,380
you're compromising what you say around
the office because you know you're at

311
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:41,110
this level of the company ladder.

312
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,080
These people above you that would get
upset if you talk about the things we'd

313
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:49,000
love. Someone just free
and authentic to like what?

314
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,650
Play Batman the fuck Outta here.

315
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,400
Fuck away from me. Yeah.
Ben Affleck was like,

316
00:17:56,401 --> 00:18:00,720
I got this Ben Affleck's like this
is perfect. This shit is perfect.

317
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,980
Who his other homeboy as
surprise play Batman. Well,

318
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:09,840
a Christian Bale was the best Batman in
my opinion is just his voice bothered me.

319
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,210
Ooh, it was a little fake, right? Yeah,

320
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,120
but it me, he got to go
comic book a little bit and
that's how you go comic book.

321
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,810
But anyway, why would it change
his voice? Why don't the suit,

322
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,280
he's got to make a fake voice.

323
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:26,130
You're going to make a fake voice so
people don't recognize your Bruce Wayne.

324
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:26,400
Yeah.

325
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,000
Don't you at least have like some mouth
thing catchphrase or some people would

326
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,800
know that would be dope
if you covered your face.

327
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:34,290
Like why do we need to see the
Lower Chin of Batman? First of all,

328
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,220
I don't think that's a good idea for
protective measures. He lead you.

329
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,220
You have a white button where the most
vulnerable part of your faces. Strange.

330
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:45,060
Like if I came in here and yeah, what's
that? If I came in here to bat suit on,

331
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,850
if you had the Batman seat, I'd like,
oh that's Joe. You know what I'm saying?

332
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:50,550
Like it's not a very good fucking Cobra.

333
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,380
The Chin part is terrible because like
that's the part you'd want to punch and

334
00:18:55,381 --> 00:19:00,270
it would be like so white. It's like
if you're in a fight with that man,

335
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:02,760
just shoot for the chin. You can't
miss it. It's like if you're,

336
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:06,780
if you're hitting focus pads, he gave
his to like looking at this one spot.

337
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,520
It's like you have camouflage on
everywhere. No spot. You get knocked down.

338
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,420
You looked at it.
I ever like,

339
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:22,590
you're going to not protect
the most volatile. How about
just open, open though?

340
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,190
Nose part up to like, you knows
get smashed. That's so crazy.

341
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,530
That's so strange.
Why don't they,

342
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,420
I mean do they really have to have that
same suit? Look this up? I don't know.

343
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:35,700
No one's ever figured it out until us.

344
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,090
It's like Bruce Wayne from Batman in the
fucking like Dan and Dan and none the

345
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,030
Batman. At least he didn't have like
a protective suit on Adam last night.

346
00:19:44,031 --> 00:19:45,420
You just had that hanging over his eyes.

347
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:48,500
He was just in disguise
like this Batman Index,

348
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,770
this Batman is gotten to the point
where he's in his arm. Basically.

349
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:57,360
It was an armored suit. Right. And
meanwhile he doesn't cover his face.

350
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,850
Oh, it was superman. You covered a
little bit of it. He's going to see,

351
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,470
he's basically a night there. He
want, he's going to war. But Superman.

352
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,830
Do you know how God damn stupid
data's and doing work? You kind of,

353
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:11,970
what I watch it kind of looked to SAS
superman. It's from another planet.

354
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:16,170
He can fly so fast. He makes the
world spin backwards. He makes time,

355
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:18,570
goes backwards.
He's a master of time.

356
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,360
He can cut things in half
with his eyeballs. He's got
laser, she's out a drive.

357
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,310
Pick his dumb ass up and carry me as
high as he wants and let them go. Yeah.

358
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,800
Movies over could bring you to the
sun. Yes. Throw you into the sun.

359
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:36,160
You fucking talking about
Hollywood shit on my face. How,

360
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,971
how crazy is that?

361
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:41,971
The idea that gravity is so dense on
Superman's world that when he comes to

362
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:46,550
earth he can fly and then the atmosphere
is so different than his body's

363
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,250
bulletproof,
but he looks just like us.

364
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,550
But the atmosphere wasn't,

365
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:57,190
people don't understand if you went
somewhere and if you're like from Earth,

366
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,220
right and then you go to somewhere
that has like less gravity like space,

367
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,900
like those guys to go
to the space station,

368
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,120
they are fucked up after a year.
Like it doesn't make them stronger.

369
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,070
It makes them weaker, weaker, their
bones shrink. Like they'd come back man.

370
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:18,940
And they had their bones atrophy.
Like they lose bone density,

371
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,220
they come back and they're healthy.

372
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,590
That's why there's this only surmount
of time you can be there. Right.

373
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,650
I think the longest is right
over a year. Yeah. They've,

374
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,840
I think they've like hit the new record.

375
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,070
I think I got hit the new record
but I had um, Cham what is his name?

376
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:37,150
Commander Chris Hadfield
had him on the podcast.

377
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:41,440
He was fascinating and he was describing
what it was like coming back from how

378
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:43,840
long was he up there for? I
think it was a year. Right?

379
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,700
You just came in to clicking like
Schmiegel or he just said when you land he

380
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:52,150
said 879 gasp. Oh my goodness.
I'm rushing up there.

381
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,460
He's been for five missions.
Okay. Those Russian came,

382
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,450
the man has spent the most time
and space when he surpassed.

383
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,750
So that's like overall time ever.

384
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,220
That guy just keeps going to space 2.2
years overseas. Like six trips though.

385
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:11,170
That too is trying to get away from his
wife. He fat. That's five years. Yeah.

386
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,270
Russians, it you to take it
another level, don't they?

387
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,600
I think you'd have to say like what's
the longest space mission or something

388
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,030
consecutive 15 days the most.
Huh.

389
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,830
But that was 2015 I believe
commander Hatfield was after that.

390
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,270
Still not dose time. I might not be
right about that, but either way.

391
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,620
Fucking a hundred days shit from what I
want to do a hundred days in the woods.

392
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:37,330
Dude, I don't want to 10 days on the
road, 10 days. I was super lonely.

393
00:22:37,331 --> 00:22:40,090
I felt like I was in space.
Yeah, we were talking about that.

394
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:41,890
Like you've got to bring friends.
Big,

395
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:44,860
big part of it and it's good for
the friends too. It's a, you know,

396
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:49,660
get guys a Gig like that where they can
open up for you in front of a packed

397
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:52,330
house. That's cool. Venues also warm up.

398
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:56,210
The crowd liked I'm going out to eat
just like, which is fine, you know?

399
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:56,591
You know when,

400
00:22:56,591 --> 00:23:00,400
the only time I ever did that in the
last like 10 years was when I was helping

401
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:02,690
Collin out when a warm
the crowd up for Collins

402
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,800
and I was like this is so weird to go
on stage. Just go onstage and say hi.

403
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,290
Not have someone in front of you. But
it's a good, it's good exercise. Yeah.

404
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,760
Cause you got to get them into, you
know I brought me right back to how it,

405
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,640
when I used to do it, it was like
right away start thinking about how I,

406
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,160
when I first started out,

407
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,150
that's most of the shows that we can be
the opening act like in Dublin doing a

408
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:28,420
shot two in the afternoon. It
was crazy. I mean just crazy man.

409
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,560
But the why'd you guys do it
like that? That's a, that we,

410
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,600
they booked on such short notice.
That's the way I'd do that too.

411
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:37,060
And I do another one at
uh, like seven. Oh Wow.

412
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:38,170
That's just the way they wanted to do it.

413
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,380
Cause I'll have like an how did you get
away from those savages after the show's

414
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:45,980
over? I had stayed. I like I, I did a
meet and greet with everyone and then they

415
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,620
bounced. They were like, Hey, let's get a
pint. I'm like, which one? Like up there.

416
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:51,620
I'm like, see you there. And not
just like, chill. I drank so much.

417
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:56,030
Guinness is ridiculous. They'll put you
down. I loved it, man. Loved it. Yeah,

418
00:23:56,031 --> 00:24:00,200
there it's a different world over there.
It really is Ireland, England, you know,

419
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:01,190
um,
they,

420
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:06,040
they have a long history of tradition
that we don't really understand, you know,

421
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,810
just, just what their culture's like that,
you know, the language and the history.

422
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,120
You go over there, you're like, oh, this
pub is 700 years old. Like what? Yeah.

423
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,760
I went to,

424
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,570
it was supposed to be the oldest pub in
Ireland and there was bullet holes from

425
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:22,660
fighting, you know, the rebels. Wow.

426
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,870
They were in there and his family
owned since day one. And the,

427
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,010
the owner was this dude
who is old as fuck now,

428
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:30,860
but he was born and raised upstairs.
He lives there now.

429
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:34,460
He's the only one still
alive. We're, they're just
all night with Patty Hooligan.

430
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:38,080
It was great. It was great. It
was so awesome. Just sipping. Wow.

431
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:42,380
Eating Chris Shit, my pants afterwards.
But in the crisps or potato chips, right?

432
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:46,640
Yeah. I call him Chris. I'm from the
you call football, football or soccer.

433
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,870
I see American football
cause I have a big day.

434
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:53,180
Talked about football and go American
flag. Otherwise you're screwed.

435
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,040
You're superstar. But you know what's
best for me. Joe Is like I did, uh,

436
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,730
what was it, like 10 shows and
uh, four days or something.

437
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:04,100
Like 10 shows in five days
or something like that.

438
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,450
And I wish I could do it more here. It's
just the wraps for me. Reps. Oh yeah,

439
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,080
that's what we're, we're
talking about comedy club.
Weekends are so good, so good.

440
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:17,220
Like, uh, when I did a salt lake, Salt
Lake City, when I did a, a wise guys,

441
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,150
I was like, man, you too. I
really get to feel it again.

442
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:23,390
Like what it's like to do for
one hour shows in a weekend.

443
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,600
It's like he gets leu timing
down and then tag lines.

444
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:30,740
They started like adding on.
He started coming up with new ideas to,

445
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:34,340
what is it about coffee that gives
you flam even just fucking really,

446
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,020
this is just a cold brew,

447
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:39,270
a caveman cold brew and those nitrile
cropping or dairy or anything.

448
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,820
I'm always ready to cough or
clear my throat and it's annoying.

449
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,930
I feel like it's an older thing. Nah
Man, it's always been that way with me.

450
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:50,850
With Cox, it's an older thing.
Hold guys, get all Fleming's,

451
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:58,520
get my cane. I drink a shit load
of coffee and my voice is good.

452
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:03,050
You know when it is for whatever weird
reason when like if a guest is talking,

453
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:05,810
like if you've got a good story and
your story goes on for a few minutes and

454
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:07,460
then I don't talk for awhile,
it all builds up.

455
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,080
You have to jump and secret. Yeah. Cali.

456
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,400
So He's trying to avoid coffee.
I told county, you need this,

457
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,330
you need to get your fucking
throat checked out. I mean,

458
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:24,320
he's been doing it since I've known him.
We just didn't hostile stop

459
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,680
AIDS sucking dicks. I'm
so about football, man,

460
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,310
I wanted to ask you about this because uh,

461
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,920
we were talking recently about this guy
who were tired super young. He's like 26,

462
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:40,320
right? Some dude just retired from
the NFL. Yeah, I'm dying, Joe.

463
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,560
Is that what you're asking? No,
no. What I'm asking is like,

464
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:46,260
you as a guy who's played football
and it's a guy who sees all this, uh,

465
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:47,610
the shit that's coming out now,

466
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,550
do you think there's going
to be a change in the game?

467
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:52,860
Do you think he's going to be like
less people that are signing up for it?

468
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:56,120
That that's what they say and they
say like with the youth leagues now,

469
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,810
they're like, oh, we're
teaching them how to hit proper.

470
00:26:57,811 --> 00:27:01,260
But it's like there's no such thing.
There's no, it's, it's not real.

471
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:04,200
Like that's a fun campaign and
stuff like that. But you know,

472
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,520
it is America ever gonna get rid of
football because CT, no man, I just,

473
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:12,180
it's part of the game. It's literally part
of the game. You know? Wait, wait till,

474
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,600
wait till the UFC numbers come out.
You're going to be surprised.

475
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:18,270
I have friends now. I talked
to him like, oh my God, man,

476
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:21,450
do you not realize what's going on here?
And so once that comes out,

477
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,060
now we know it with boxing
and mixed martial arts,

478
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:26,580
like of course there's going to be brain
trauma guys getting punched in the head

479
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,170
with football. People are like, what?
But if it's literally part of the game,

480
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,460
it's just, it is what it is. Now is the
juice worth the squeeze and football?

481
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,680
The argument is it
depends for your health.

482
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,560
If you're coming from nothing and it
pays for your college, you make you know,

483
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:44,370
$40 million. Your family, your family,
their family set for life. God,

484
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,710
that juice might be worth the squeeze
depending how bad you're going to have it,

485
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,020
if you can get to that
level. Correct. Yeah.

486
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,710
I mean there's probably a
lot of guys who wash out.

487
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,830
I know what to more likely
than not, they watch out. Yeah,

488
00:27:55,831 --> 00:27:59,850
I knew I'd do who washed out and he was
really fucked up the point where like he

489
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:01,440
was seeing shit there wasn't there.

490
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:03,720
He would go out into the yard
and start talking to himself.

491
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,810
It's such a bummer man.
Everyone responds different.

492
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,750
But they say the biggest thing,
and you know,

493
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,810
I guess it's the biggest thing because
I played football since I was what,

494
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:17,010
six years old. But when you're young
hitting when you're young heading,

495
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:19,290
it's just like you shouldn't hit until,
you know,

496
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,290
they say probably to high school, but if
you don't hit to you're in high school,

497
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:23,910
you're going to get left behind.

498
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,760
You know what's interesting about that
is that there's a real good argument when

499
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:31,650
it comes to striking that if you can
teach kids how to play fight when they're

500
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:34,350
young, just make sure they
play fight, you know? You know,

501
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,520
you don't want him to like go on a war,
teach and be like that.

502
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,720
The the quick way to teach them,
it teaches them how to play,

503
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:41,400
fight striking when they're young.

504
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:46,170
Like do like Thai style kickboxing or you
know like just where you're boxing but

505
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:49,140
you're not hitting too hard because
they're not going to hit each other art

506
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,100
anyway. Right. They can't, they don't
hit that hard. And then on top of that,

507
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:56,820
teach them to not hit harder off and
did teach him to like be real solid on

508
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:58,620
technique.
Then they,

509
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:02,550
they're super customed to the movements
of striking and then you get them to a

510
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:04,770
position when they were like 16,
18,

511
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,640
they've been boxing her whole fucking
life and their movements are like fully

512
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:13,230
ingrained to the point where an average
athlete coming into it at a later age

513
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,600
without all those like super fine tuned,

514
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,690
ingrained in you while you
were growing up and developing.

515
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,240
You almost don't have a chance,
you know,

516
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:24,590
like when he gets to like a Roy Jones Jr
and his prime level for sure. You know,

517
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,550
if you're like an average
athlete who learns boxing at 26,

518
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,620
and then you, uh, at 30 have
to box Roy Jones, I mean,

519
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,640
good, enjoy that. Good fucking luck. I
don't care what kind of athlete you are.

520
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,170
Good. Doesn't matter. Fucking lock. Yeah.

521
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,170
And some people will make that argument
with, you know, Floyd Mayweather,

522
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,410
they said, listen, his uncle, his dad
he's been doing since he was, what, six.

523
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,680
He's the best argument, the best
argument, the best argument,

524
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,670
who he never gets hit.

525
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,440
It's been hit in a professional
career that spanned 49 fights.

526
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,850
He's been hitting maybe hard seven
or eight times true. The only,

527
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,370
and there's a few x factors in the,
in this fight.

528
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,690
The only kind of thing that gives people
hope if you're on team MMA or team

529
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:09,970
Connor, which is not MMA for
suboxone, but if your team,

530
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:13,900
Connor is these x factors of
Floyd's had two years off, right?

531
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:17,740
He said two years off, but in the past
he's taken time off and comes back better,

532
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:22,060
but he is 40 and so forth. That has to be
something, you know. And the other thing,

533
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:25,120
why is he doing it? He's, he do it for
money. What's is do it for attention?

534
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:29,350
Why is he coming back to get to 50? And
then, uh, they di eight ounce gloves,

535
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:32,680
which they officially approved today.
Eight ounce gloves is a huge,

536
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:36,370
huge advance for Connor. And I think,
man, it's all, it's all interesting.

537
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:39,670
Men call x factors, right? Like we
don't really choose to be honest.

538
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,910
No one really knows. I think I have an
idea what I think's going to happen,

539
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:45,610
but no one knows. But, and
that's why I think the,

540
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,690
the footage of Connor sparring poly is
such a big deal because people, oh shit,

541
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,190
no,
he can actually box.

542
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,760
And I even think Dana on the Fertittas
who were there watching go, uh,

543
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,210
we actually got something here and that's
why it was such a big deal because I

544
00:30:58,211 --> 00:31:01,810
think everyone's like, all right, Connor
MMA, he's good. I've seen him move around.

545
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,290
I'm playing this, this dude as
far as box. And he's saying,

546
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:08,740
you've got some problems, isn't he the
best all time problems. Who knows what,

547
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,100
what kind of training and Pauli been
doing before that fight? Like how,

548
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,840
what kind of shape was he in? Non Not
in 12 round shape, you know? And Paul,

549
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:21,180
he just got off the plane. Why did he
do 12 rounds? Why do you do that? Right.

550
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,620
But he had, he been training, he, uh,

551
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,230
he got word from Conner's team
that they're going to use them.

552
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:28,120
So he started to train some but not like,

553
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,250
it's not like he was getting
ready for a fight fight, you know,

554
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:34,120
so that's what he said. He goes, man, you
know, for me to go 12 rounds was tough.

555
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,030
Like I wasn't expecting to all 12 rounds
because the first day they used to him,

556
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:40,060
I think he said he only did six or
eight rounds and then he was like, oh,

557
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,880
we're going to spar tomorrow morning.
I'll get in better shape. Stuff like that.

558
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:46,810
Get used to the fighting shape and they
didn't use them. Then he flew to, uh,

559
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,920
cover the, uh, Mikey Garcia, uh, uh,

560
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,920
Broner fight and then came back and
he was fresh off the plane and then he

561
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:56,800
sparked 12 rounds. So he's like,
they just did me dirty man.

562
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:59,230
That's his whole thing. His, his
feelings are hurt. He's like, why the,

563
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:02,050
why would they do that? Man, I was
here to help them. What they did that,

564
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,370
that's the kind of help they want it.

565
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,740
They just want to kind of help
that he didn't want to give,

566
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,980
they wanted to kind of help where Connor
beats the fuck out of a world champ.

567
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,860
Correct. And that's what
Connor said though. Like in
college defense when they go,

568
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,380
you're bringing pollyannas.
Yeah, I'm bringing it.

569
00:32:14,381 --> 00:32:16,840
He said it's on showtime during
the media scrum. He goes, yeah,

570
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:20,620
I'm bringing him in to fuck him up. And
I think Polly thought, oh that, yeah,

571
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,050
he goes, he goes, yeah, I'm going
to bring him in and fucked him up.

572
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,200
Word for word that's on,
that's on a document that's document.

573
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,370
So then he gets it and goes,
oh, we'll spar and be all good.

574
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,160
But remember six months
prior to this Paul, he goes,

575
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:36,940
I could beat Conor with one
hand tied behind my back.
I was like a baby elephant.

576
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:40,410
He's stores. That was a guy,
man. Oh he said that. Oops.

577
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,990
But he thought it was just hyping the
fight. You know, he's not doing sparring,

578
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,750
be like boys,
but it just didn't happen.

579
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:47,090
Like Connor's liberty there
just to prove a point. Well,

580
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:51,290
he is a very important point to
prove before a giant fight like that.

581
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,290
Like that video alone is probably worth,

582
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,850
who knows how many thousands of hundreds
of thousands of buys. I'm priceless.

583
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,240
Priceless. That's worth so much
money. I mean how many more people,

584
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,280
a lot of people were going
to buy the fight anyway,

585
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,340
but how many more people are going to buy
the fight now that you see common land

586
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:11,540
in that straight left and then drop in
Paul and Paul, he said is it pushed down?

587
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:15,110
And you could see that it's not a
push down. I mean it's just not,

588
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:19,230
if you get pushed down like that,
you probably can cost already. Yeah.

589
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,680
If your balance is off.
I see what that's so bad.

590
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,560
Like he was saying something about him
getting grabbed on the back of the head.

591
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,460
He could watch it,

592
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,720
watch the knockdown Polly Polly saying
that it's dirty and he didn't get that.

593
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,270
I get that. But that they
signed up. It's a fight.

594
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,510
But the other thing is poly
saying, you know, and he goes take,

595
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:36,430
what do you want from the videos?

596
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,800
But I think Khan and his team and Dana
fucked up putting this out. Cause now,

597
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,340
now Floyd Mayweather,
the team knows this is the salary fights.

598
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,530
Like this is the dirty stuff he does
so they can warn them that dirty their

599
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,200
hands getting inboxing that sturdy.
You can get away with it,

600
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:54,110
but that's frowned upon. It's going
to happen. It was rabbit punches,

601
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:57,590
but that the boy is going to do
that. So this, this part right here.

602
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,380
Gimme some volume on that
so you can hear that.

603
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,650
He's hitting them hard man.

604
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,223
Okay.
Yeah.

605
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:13,340
He hits him with a straight left that's
clean and then it looks like he's

606
00:34:13,341 --> 00:34:15,830
wobbled and he hit some of
the right hand afterwards.

607
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:19,160
Like play that part one more time
when it goes down like you can't,

608
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,880
I don't see an argument. I've tried
to look at it a little push down.

609
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:26,720
I don't see it. I don't see
it. This is the beginning part

610
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:33,170
then. That's a legit ref by the way.
Yeah. Yeah. Joe Cortez, super legit.

611
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:37,560
Oh
did,

612
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,110
he's beating the shit out of them.

613
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,050
Okay. I don't give a fuck
what anybody says. Like,

614
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:47,560
if he can land those
combinations on Pauline melon,

615
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,380
RG like that at any point in life
that is working. But yeah, man,

616
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,070
he's about,
to me that validates counter.

617
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:58,040
But at the same time and Polly's defense,
you know,

618
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:02,090
nine 12 round fight shape,
he's exhausted. I get all that,

619
00:35:02,091 --> 00:35:05,540
but still punched it and never
done that. Yeah, he messed up.

620
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:09,440
He must've underestimated them.
You know, I had uh, uh, uh,

621
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,890
Andre Berto on my show and he's supposed
to help calm her out and he's like,

622
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:16,520
I ain't going up there. And he's a, he's
a, he's good friends with kind of him.

623
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,160
Connor did Rehab together. He's like,
no, I'm not going up there, man. He goes,

624
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,320
just because he had a good point.
He goes,

625
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,300
let's say I go up there and help Connor.

626
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:26,330
And for whatever reason he doesn't think
he's going to win because let's say he

627
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:30,320
blasts away me within the face. I'm gonna
get so much hate from the boxing world.

628
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:34,070
Like it's a fraternity man. And he's like,
in the way he did Pauli like, we just,

629
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,530
we can't do it, man. He goes, I wish them
the best, but I'm not going to help them.

630
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,170
Well,

631
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,560
also think that if he's peaking and he's
in full fight shape and then making you

632
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:42,450
fight 12 rounds,

633
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,110
I mean that's when you're in the gym
and you're sparring 12 rounds done.

634
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,530
Isn't that unusual that you get one guy to
barks 12 rounds with you? Oh, no, no, no,

635
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:53,600
no. It was designed for Paul. You get
beat up, but then I feel like, uh,

636
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,980
you know Paul, he's a team player. If,
I don't know if you've ever met Paul,

637
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:57,380
he loves you, but if you
ever met Paul, he like,

638
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,320
I feel like he's such a good
guidance. Say anything. Listen,

639
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:04,110
if you brought me in to do anything I
have had guys off for wanting me to help

640
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:06,210
him with camps, I turn it
down and you're like, hey,

641
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:09,330
we need to go five five that ain't
happening. I'll give you one round,

642
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:11,670
two rounds for your,
for the best condition.

643
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:15,420
Usually do a shark tank is Joe bringing
fresh guys for different looks and push

644
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:19,500
you harder. So this is just a showcase of
Connor's abilities at Paulie's expense.

645
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,650
Yup. I like Paul. He's a commentator. I
think he's one of his best in the world.

646
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,520
He's really, really good. And
he offers like real, legitimate
insight. He's vitally,

647
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:28,890
really good to think that he
got rocked and doesn't deserve,

648
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:31,590
remember how this went?
Like did he think that he meet bring,

649
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:35,160
maybe did think that he got
pushed down? No, I it again,

650
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:37,200
I think it's combination
of both. I think, you know,

651
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:39,450
Polly had one summer and he even says,
he goes,

652
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:43,650
I want some rounds Koller one somewhere.
You know, I like to see it all right.

653
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,520
Me Too. And the UFC said they're gonna
release it after the fight, which is that,

654
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,870
that's going to be the real test
is going to be real tested. What?

655
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,370
Cause Dana said it was a
one sided beat down. Yeah.

656
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,350
It was like he was asked what for 12
rounds, which I don't believe that.

657
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,820
What if it's true? Uh, you, you,

658
00:36:57,821 --> 00:37:01,710
you gotta go with what Polly did say
happened and then what you see happened.

659
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,740
I think it's combination of both.
I really do. I think, again,

660
00:37:04,741 --> 00:37:08,100
I think it's people were like, Yo, you
know, everyone's on this Connor wagon,

661
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,470
especially in the UFC. Dana,
that's his golden boy. Right?

662
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,410
And I think we knew Conor could box,

663
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,810
but then when you see him do it
against Paul, you're like, oh shit.

664
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,600
And so even I bet when we watch
the tape where I'm like, oh damn,

665
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:21,870
Connor did pretty well. I don't think he
beat the shit out Pauline for 12 rents.

666
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,380
I think towards the end he probably
like, you see that that gap, that hole,

667
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:28,530
obviously, listen, this has
obviously been very valuable.

668
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,650
If there were more moments like this,
don't you think they would leak those two?

669
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,630
Correct.
There'd be everywhere.

670
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,500
I mean they're saying they don't want him
to see what Connor's working on. Okay.

671
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:40,310
Just show us a mock punches that landed.

672
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,560
Just give me like what it was Mike Tyson
Siki second highlights to show me a few

673
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,600
bap bap, bap. Bap. Bap.
Bap. Bap. Yeah. Yeah.

674
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,720
I mean you don't have to like
show all of its patterns,

675
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,580
but how well did this hype that like
this is priceless giant. And now Paulie,

676
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,460
you know you have this huge soap
opera in box and going right now.

677
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,880
Polly's a main character now.
So Paul,

678
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:03,540
he might have to fight Conor if Floyd
and Floyd and even had Floyd and Connor,

679
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,100
if Floyd beats Conor and
then Paul, he can say, look,

680
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:10,380
I want my shot at him.
You know you,

681
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:13,290
you talked a lot of shit and I didn't
get in shape. If you're not relaxed,

682
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,010
the play, it's only, it's only the play.

683
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:20,340
If Connor has a good showing,
even if you live in the decision,

684
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,580
as long as it gets showing right,

685
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,400
then you do McGregor promotions against
Polly Mellen Naji and I'll buying that

686
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:29,700
shit. The only way. Fighting
Khabib, Tony Ferguson,

687
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,360
all that elbow just Jitsu Shit.
Nah,

688
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,040
we are putting on these eight ounces,
go 12 rounds

689
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,710
and make some,
I need some serious money.

690
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,870
That's a lot of people think
on their fight MMA again.

691
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,410
I mean he's gonna make $100 million
from this fight. Yeah, probably more.

692
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,850
That's the sponsors. Yeah, that's
a lot of money. That's scrooge.

693
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:52,160
Mcduck rich. That's,
that's we go and sizzler.

694
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,950
[inaudible]. It has a son, you know,
he's a smart guy. I think the play would,

695
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,240
and I know a lot of, you'll see people
like that because he never fight or shop.

696
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,360
I get that.
Give any UFC fighter $100 million.

697
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,330
They're both thrown up to
C's going spach and see ya.

698
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:10,320
This is way too hard of a life.
Hundred Mil.

699
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,410
He's even satin sheets and I can go fight
Polly for another whatever, 50 mill,

700
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:17,040
probably of my own money or,

701
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:21,370
or I'll go fight Nate Diaz
and the trilogy, 90% or more.

702
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:25,990
Connor Mcgregor versus Floyd Mayweather
money man says notorious will lose 90%

703
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:29,670
of his $75 million payday
if he's disqualified. Yeah,
yeah, I know that. Yeah.

704
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,810
Oh yeah. That's, that's,

705
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,270
if he doesn't know my may move on him
and he won't be us up all the time.

706
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:38,050
Can you tell a superman punch spinning
punch? I'm like, get out of my face.

707
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,520
The absolutely not.
You can't,

708
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,520
it's just caddy can throw
spinning back fist though. Whoa.

709
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,790
Magic that ship some Gut, some gentlemen
rules for guts. You imagine now if,

710
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,660
if Floyd said, uh, you could throw elbows,

711
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,100
I'm surprised he has an eight ounce
gloves, will do whatever you want to do.

712
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,760
Let's do this. Let's do this. You imagine
and you get elbows and he gets thrown.

713
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,420
One kick around and the guy can clinch
and throw elbows from the clench.

714
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,710
Do you ever see that?

715
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,220
The sequence where Jordan me and
knocked out Cyborg and strike force.

716
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,100
Oh my oldest nasty.
He's one of the nastiest,

717
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:12,910
nastiest sequences of standing elbows.
Holes like,

718
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,320
like a fucking seminar on
how to land a standing elbow.

719
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:22,300
The most vicious elbow hall time.
Cyborg is taking some shots to the dome.

720
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,680
Dude, he got from my Cavedin page,
the knee k page, kill and die.

721
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:31,110
He did God damn near killed him. I
mean yet to have all constructive. Oh,

722
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,790
he didn't like, he basically had to
put like mesh wiring all over his face.

723
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:39,820
Now he's a superhero and he said he was
going to fight again and then he change

724
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:41,770
his mind. Yeah. Let's not
do that though. Huh? I mean,

725
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:44,770
who knows how his dome works right now.
I mean,

726
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:49,060
after you get hit like that and you're
set goal pours in poor to very poor.

727
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,150
Who knows? Everyone's different.
It won't change the different,

728
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:57,130
here it is right here. Look at this. He
hits him with a liver shot, a left right?

729
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:02,500
Doesn't happen till they get to
the kitchen here. Boom, boom, boom,

730
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:07,120
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I mean,
look at that. I mean, come on man.

731
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:11,080
Who's the rays? Hit Him with like 13
fucking straight elbows to the head.

732
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:16,240
Did you think they stopped the CIF?
Joan's early? I mean late. Yes.

733
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,290
Yes. Right? Yes. Yeah. I
think you're, you know,

734
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:23,890
like you're giving the guy the best
chance he can. Your John McCarthy,

735
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:26,800
you know how tough he is.
John's the best in the world too.

736
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:31,270
So they're size two punches
too late. Yeah. Well,

737
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:33,940
and you kind of three also like the

738
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,750
delayed effect,
that head kick.

739
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,680
I get head kicked and you see his like
legs buckle and he's wobbling around and

740
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:42,020
then when he goes down
up against the cage,

741
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:45,500
I mean it wasn't like a real
significant thing that ha,

742
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,930
he's like his legs weren't
working right? No. It's game over.

743
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:52,010
Like the game's over there was already
hurt bad and then John Jumps on top of

744
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:53,300
them. It's just wailing on him. You,

745
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:56,510
he could've stopped at one or two punches
earlier, but you know in his eyes,

746
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,720
what if DC recovers? What if
he rolls over? Gets to guard.

747
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:02,540
What if he holds on to John?
I believe his lived to fight another day.

748
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,150
I agree with you too.
I totally agree with you,

749
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:07,190
but I'm just looking at it
from John's point. I did it.

750
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,910
I don't like criticizing giants. She's
like, man, I thought that was too late.

751
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,740
A lot of people thought that was too.
Yeah,

752
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,700
it's tough to watch with DCM and my
thing with DC and you talked about and

753
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,390
coming back, he's, you
know, he's, what is he,

754
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:22,391
39 38 39 he has a great job with
the UFC as far as UFC tonight.

755
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,130
Right. He's kind of becoming
that. The guy you'll see tonight,

756
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,740
he's doing commentating. We do.
He's traveling all around now.

757
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:31,550
He's great at commentary. You know?
Does he ever be John? I don't think so.

758
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,470
So what are you going to do? Fight
Gustin again, those, the know,

759
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,860
I don't know what his pay is, but
you know, at some point, you know,

760
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,120
health has to take into account with this.
Yeah.

761
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,400
The Gustafson fight was a grueling
five round fight. You know,

762
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,500
I remember there was a very,
very, very good for us.

763
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:51,030
It's been test fucking close man. It's
better now than ever before. He too.

764
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,810
That's why I want to see him and
John Ken's glow over. I was like,

765
00:42:53,811 --> 00:42:58,070
Jesus Christ looked amazing and the
combinations he was landing that hazing,

766
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,830
that whipped like upper
cut from the outside.

767
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:06,070
See the thing about him is he's the only
guy that can match John for distance

768
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:10,280
and reach size. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, no
one else is like him, not even close.

769
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:13,910
And Gustafson is also more
mobile than John. Like he's,

770
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:17,840
John is like very creative,
mixes things up more.

771
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:22,040
But Gustafson is more like bouncing
around better footwork and his better

772
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:22,940
footwork for sure.
Yeah.

773
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:27,170
He's very agile and he's also the first
guy to ever Atlanta take town on John.

774
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:31,350
Yes. And I think he's better. I think
he's better now that he wants then we too.

775
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:34,250
That'd be, that'd be a great fight.
Fuck yeah, that would be, you know,

776
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,610
they were asking John how about John
was on Good Morning America getting

777
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:41,660
interviewed by Michael Strahan. Good
Lord to things change. Wow. Yeah. Right.

778
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:45,260
So he's on Good Morning America
and the ask them about what's next.

779
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,630
And he talked about, you know,
he'd like to fight Brock.

780
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:48,920
Like that's always been kind of his thing.

781
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:51,830
And Connor kind of set that with
the super fights. But you know,

782
00:43:51,831 --> 00:43:54,650
Brock can't fight too. I think whatever
it has, 18 months or some shit,

783
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:57,260
I'm sure it was slipping in the back door.
So I'm shit like what's,

784
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,340
what's this juice to the
gills? I'd still watch it. Um,

785
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,060
so they talked to about Gus fin. They
go, what about mass square garden?

786
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,840
And he was not happening
cause they weren't taxed me
another 10% of fight in New

787
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,810
York. So He's like, I won't
find maths work on. Wow. I know.

788
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:15,010
I feel like you'll see like fuck your
10% here, just finding a squirt gun.

789
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,500
Let's figure this out. Take a little
extra pieces of the mighty mass.

790
00:44:17,501 --> 00:44:21,200
Give us something to perhaps they
might even say no, give me that.

791
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,760
Would if John Put uh, uh, uh, no
steroid test clause, I Guy Brock,

792
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:29,720
oh, take your shit. Fuck you do your
shit. I'm gonna do my copay and you know,

793
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,140
we missed and I'd be up all night long.
No

794
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:35,880
drug test. Cause that's all talking
about doing like Dubai or some shit.

795
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,730
But if he just says, tell him, look,
I don't give a fuck what you do,

796
00:44:38,731 --> 00:44:41,930
I'm going to beat your ass. And
then Brock's gotta go, Oh my God.

797
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,090
It's like full bane.
Sheth

798
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:51,180
drug gets up to two 90 cuts down at two
65 I don't know if John could fuck with

799
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:55,350
that. I don't, that's a scary
dude. Mccain fucked up backup,

800
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:59,640
you know King County.
But he did have the stomach issue.

801
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,720
Diverticulitis, right ovary muscle
fucked him up when he was being broked.

802
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:08,190
Well that was a crazy fight for him to
take after recovering from surgery where

803
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:12,600
he got 12 inches of his colon removed
and we talk in Uber Ring. Yeah,

804
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,660
that was ubering to the man's got like
a straight up murder when he was two 65

805
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,310
kicked in the gut. He just
had surgery there. Hit that.

806
00:45:23,311 --> 00:45:24,990
Obering see that.
It's like,

807
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:29,490
he's like one of the best
arguments for no testing.

808
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,960
He's still kind of killing it
with the old too. He's great,

809
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,470
but it's a different Overeem
like this Overeem the Ha,

810
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:41,280
the heavyweight grom pre k one
heavyweight Grand Prix Overeem.

811
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,710
There's never been a fight like
that before. Like look at this size.

812
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:47,280
They're never going to see
that again ever. In the UFC.

813
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:52,440
Physiques he was so jacked.
They look like giant Phil Heath.

814
00:45:52,441 --> 00:45:57,441
Like you're never going to see these
two again and kicked like that and he's

815
00:45:57,481 --> 00:46:00,420
just all over him.
Brought to the gut down.

816
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:05,040
He's got some of the best knees in
the businessmen. Super good technique,

817
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,570
which just I, I missed this
Overeem where he was just dying.

818
00:46:09,571 --> 00:46:12,500
People with power. You'll
never see the, the,

819
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,270
the Overeem now that can be dumb.

820
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:20,610
Fucking has been kicked to the gut. The
Overeem now that uh, his steroid free.

821
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:25,290
Like he, he, he does that move where
he runs a lei steroid over him.

822
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:26,720
Never ran

823
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:34,350
saying like on steroids. [inaudible]
good luck in miss step an inch bat.

824
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:38,850
Now he's clean. That fuckers sprinting,
remedy fought Todd Duffy and dream.

825
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,753
Do you ever see that fight?

826
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,020
I trained Tom for that fight
and I suppose to corner him.

827
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,870
Todd Duffy was super
promising before that fight.

828
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,450
We'll talk took on short notice. I
don't do it. I wouldn't be broke.

829
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:54,770
Got To fight who over him dream dough.

830
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,520
I don't do that. Listen, you have
a lot of talent. You could be huge.

831
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:02,250
This is not the way to get huge.
She gets a bad idea.

832
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:06,180
Alliterated in Japan
with short notice Japan.

833
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:09,420
What is it about calling people
like a week before the fight going?

834
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,640
What are you up to Saturday?

835
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,950
All advantages for it,
for the home team then,

836
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:21,630
and wasn't this post UFC Duffy because
he had that UFC fight where he won like

837
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:26,190
it was one of the fastest fights ever.
One out with a jab in seconds,

838
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,650
breath and peace to him. Hey. Yeah,
rest in peace to anguish. Terrible,

839
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:34,000
terrible story. Duffy's Gigi Jack
too. He was super jacked. So talented.

840
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,900
I'll really, really talented stupid.
He goes in there and he fights.

841
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:41,170
Overeem ad is most Overeem ever.

842
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,890
They'll look at it and I'm confident is,

843
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,260
yeah,
it's like a death sentence.

844
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:55,540
He was a monster back then.
And then when you think about him,

845
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,720
like bordering on both sports,
right?

846
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,020
He's like k one grand Prix
champions still fighting MMA.

847
00:48:02,021 --> 00:48:04,360
It's all again the same time period.

848
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:09,310
And his striking is just off the charts
because of it and you can't take him

849
00:48:09,311 --> 00:48:13,420
down. Yeah. So Duffy just went after
him [inaudible] and everything.

850
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:19,360
Boom. He gets cuts the mood for Duffy
though. Yeah, it is a move. He gets old.

851
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:22,240
The body shot body gets Duffy
here that you write here about.

852
00:48:22,241 --> 00:48:25,990
I'm not backing up to look. It just
boomed so much power forward. Right hand.

853
00:48:25,991 --> 00:48:30,750
Left hand running from
[inaudible]. He wasn't running. No.

854
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:35,860
Did his thought process. Now
I'm a fucking yeah. Slides out.

855
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,070
Delay. Well, he's also older and
he's taken more punishment to you.

856
00:48:40,071 --> 00:48:43,450
Gotta think though.
Knockouts that he's had just in the UFC.

857
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:46,390
Steve Bay knocked him unconscious.
Um,

858
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,570
Travis Browne knocked him
unconscious a while ago. Yeah. Yeah.

859
00:48:49,571 --> 00:48:52,120
I mean there's been how many,
how many people knocked him out?

860
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,330
He has his more knocked out losses.
Anyone in the EOC? Yeah. Um,

861
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,960
brothel knocked him out. Rothwell
Steve Bay. He beat JDF didn't. Yes,

862
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:05,290
he did. He knocked him out. He
didn't lens a couple of issues. Yeah,

863
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,780
but I'm trying to think of
other fights that he's had.

864
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:11,260
I'll tell you what I'd love to see
Overeem versa. Your boyfriends, you know.

865
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:15,550
Oh my God. I would love to send it to
says jds coming up, but oh, that's right.

866
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,840
Big Foot Silva knocked him out too.
Oh that big foot civil one was rough.

867
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:20,800
That was a rough one.

868
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,430
It was real rough cause he was standing
up and big foot Tito on. I'm just Ding,

869
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:26,260
Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding,
Ding. But then look at him.

870
00:49:26,261 --> 00:49:31,261
He merged dude's share of Nelson JDS or
Lawsky loses Steve Bay for the title.

871
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,510
This true fight was brutal. No,
that Mark Hunt fight was rough.

872
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:40,750
The flat road market market's fine again.
It's right in that Russian dues, right?

873
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:43,990
Like 10 or something. Yeah. Yeah.

874
00:49:43,991 --> 00:49:48,000
He's fighting a isn't that a,
is that in Australia? Yeah.

875
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:52,510
Australia and New Zealand one
[inaudible] still good move man.

876
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:56,410
You have a fucking Mark Hunt fight New
Zealand. He's a huge draw. Oh my God.

877
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:01,200
Gigantic Sydney to Boris fighter
man. Soon to Boris. Like guts.

878
00:50:01,201 --> 00:50:05,890
Sneaky, sneaky left high kick Judy's
Russians. And though that that whole area,

879
00:50:05,891 --> 00:50:09,160
they might fuck you there had taken over
box and they're slowly creeping in. MMA.

880
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,850
How about it could be,
I know what's going on with him.

881
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,850
Well he got Tony First and Kevin
Lino fight for the interim title.

882
00:50:15,851 --> 00:50:18,370
They just don't think can be, can make
the weight. I don't know what's going on.

883
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,130
They asked him to fight, right? And
he was like, no, I need more time.

884
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:25,060
It's just the boats passing them by
more time. What's, it must be injured.

885
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,790
Look Tiramisu. I Dunno. Terribly.

886
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,760
And I like could be such a talent,
but like, it's so frustrating.

887
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:36,590
I fucking love Tiramisu. Oh, I get it.
Could be no, it's like when you don't,

888
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:40,460
you know, you shouldn't be
eating this, but you're like,
fuck it. Let's get dessert.

889
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:44,270
If I go, what? Do you have
dessert. And they go, well,
we have world famous Tiramisu.

890
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:48,920
Bring that. Oh, then you got some coffee
with it. A double espresso, please.

891
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,290
I gotcha. I get it. I get it. They
don't have the, here's the thing,

892
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,840
my man campaigns, uh, runs these
ultra marathons every year.

893
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:04,640
Last year he ran the big foot, 2000
or 200. It's two oh five, 205 miles.

894
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:09,080
And this year he's running
this Moab one 234 miles.

895
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:14,210
He cuts down from 180 pounds,
which is what he weighs normally.

896
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,960
He's down to one 60 now.
Jesus, he know how he does it.

897
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:23,390
He works out and burns off more
calories than eats. That's it. But then,

898
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:26,930
and he feels good doing it. Yeah.
He'll bike burn off 3000 calories.

899
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:31,730
Eat 2000 I mean if he look
different though, if he can do it,

900
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:36,590
if he can do that then Khabib can
do that too. They can all do that.

901
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:41,270
All you have to do is just work hard,
do a lot of fucking cardio,

902
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:44,970
put a lot of hours in training
and eat less than you're eating.

903
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,470
Here's the thing though. You'll shrink,
you'll shrink. Yeah. That's it's science.

904
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:49,423
But here's the thing,

905
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,110
you can hire someone to do that to
make sure you make that weight. Well,

906
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:58,850
he's also look a very strict Muslim
and so he, he celebrates Ramadan.

907
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:01,700
Yeah. Which makes it a real
issue for guys to fight.

908
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,880
Although someone just did that in the UFC,

909
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:10,280
um, Ramadan. Yeah. And got through it

910
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,660
but through Ramadan.
But his nickname is,

911
00:52:14,661 --> 00:52:19,661
remember the name Billao Mohamad Mohamad
went through Ramadan while he was

912
00:52:20,061 --> 00:52:22,070
training.
He just did it very smart.

913
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:26,030
And he scheduled is training for
after his meal. A lot of Batta. Yeah.

914
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,190
And he fought great with Khabib though.
It's like, you know, at 55 kind of,

915
00:52:29,191 --> 00:52:32,090
but cluster fuck there and he's
just getting left in the dust.

916
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:35,790
I think it's his Bot I think is real
issues with his body from losing those

917
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:39,520
amounts of weight. Let's boil it and
listen, I love Ak and they've done, uh,

918
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,480
you know, I think, um, you know crazy.

919
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:44,960
Bob Cook should belongs in the
UFC hall of Fame Hall of fame.

920
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:48,440
He's a straight up genius. Him
and Javier. Yeah, but those boys,

921
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:51,230
I don't know what's going on there with
Kane. You know, you've got the, you know,

922
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,050
well, you know what it is for
awhile. Here's what I think it is.

923
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,890
You got at the top level of that.
You have to have the best,

924
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:02,330
first of all, arguably the best
heavy weight ever and cane.

925
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,570
And then he got one of the best light
heavyweights ever and Daniel and they're

926
00:53:05,571 --> 00:53:10,160
going to war all the time.
But Thompson and, but, and
Luke Rockhold in the mix too.

927
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,880
And they also, you only have a certain
amount of years of being able to do that.

928
00:53:13,881 --> 00:53:15,800
So then he,
she Keynes body breaking down.

929
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,060
I mean you can't just attribute that only
to his training there because there's

930
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:23,690
some questionable weightlifting videos
of him online. The dead lift. Yeah.

931
00:53:23,691 --> 00:53:25,680
Well it's,
it's not even a dead man.

932
00:53:25,681 --> 00:53:30,030
It's like he's doing a kettle bell swing
with like shit form and they're doing

933
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,220
high reps of all kinds of weird shit.

934
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:35,280
I got saw a lot like Steve
Maxwell saw and he was furious.

935
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,670
But the thing is a lot of them and
make guys, if they don't come from a,

936
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:42,060
like a football background in most of
them you don't see lift like that to be

937
00:53:42,061 --> 00:53:42,661
honest.
Well,

938
00:53:42,661 --> 00:53:46,560
it's problem was he had a trainer and
the people were feeling like the trainer

939
00:53:46,561 --> 00:53:48,570
was doing a shit job.
But yeah, I mean, yeah,

940
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,600
100% I mean as far as naming injuries
and delays in fights on eight k but I

941
00:53:53,821 --> 00:53:57,270
think, and it's not up to them. I
think you, again, like you were saying,

942
00:53:57,271 --> 00:54:00,870
you have the toughest guys in the world
competing every day. You have Khabib,

943
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:03,000
you have all these guys and
things are going to happen.

944
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,970
I think there's two different schools of
thought, and I don't know who's right.

945
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,420
There's a school of thought where you
just fucking go in there and you'd go to

946
00:54:09,421 --> 00:54:12,660
war all the time and the cream rises
to the top and you get hardened by the

947
00:54:12,661 --> 00:54:16,440
combat and you come out of it, the best
fighter in the 1997, you know what,

948
00:54:16,441 --> 00:54:20,220
it was cane for a while, right? Until
all these injuries started piling up.

949
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:24,090
But I think there's another
way of looking at it. Well,

950
00:54:24,091 --> 00:54:25,770
there's two different other ways
of looking at it. There's the,

951
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:28,290
and when you get to a Connor situation,
then you get a super camp.

952
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,340
It's designed around you,

953
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:34,290
and then you get these people who are
working with you on various aspects of

954
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:37,470
your game. You're sparring
partners or plan accordingly.

955
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,540
There's a bunch of people
that you work with that,

956
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:42,330
you know are their goal is to
get you better for this fight.

957
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:47,190
And I would say GSPs one
who really started that for
sure. For us. A hobby. Yeah.

958
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:52,200
Yeah. And, um, I think these
guys that are doing this today,

959
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:55,860
you know, it's like how do you do
it? Do you do it the old school way,

960
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:59,400
which has always been proven. You can
make some tough motherfuckers that way.

961
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:04,820
Or do you do at the att way when you
have this gigantic program where you have

962
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,780
all world class coaches and athletes
and you're putting together all these

963
00:55:09,781 --> 00:55:11,040
people and you know,

964
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,760
I mean you just have a giant super team
look at their roster too. But again,

965
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:19,260
but you know, not that Javier didn't
have a competition background,

966
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:23,340
but the reason why t so good and they're,
they're killing it with a Yolana Jen,

967
00:55:23,341 --> 00:55:28,000
Jen, check with fucking Amanda Nunez. All
their big athletes. Mike Brown, right?

968
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:32,130
He's been there. He's done it. He's
awesome. Yeah. Yeah. To me, you know,

969
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:36,300
he definitely top three in the boreal,
the boreal too. But Mike Brown really,

970
00:55:36,301 --> 00:55:36,571
he's only,

971
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:41,571
he's focused on Yolana and Amanda Nunez
and he's focusing because he's been

972
00:55:41,581 --> 00:55:45,150
there, he's done those
meathead days. Things going,
we need to focus more on this.

973
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:47,790
So when you have someone,
even team Alpha Male,

974
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:50,910
I don't have a ton of injuries really.
Granted Cody Garbrandt seven his things,

975
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:52,740
but Uriah faber,
he's been through it.

976
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:56,010
So you need these younger guys who have
been through it who are going to take

977
00:55:56,011 --> 00:55:58,950
control, who are saying, listen,
we can't be Vander Lee Silverman.

978
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,830
This isn't meant the top team,
this ain't working in football.

979
00:56:01,831 --> 00:56:05,490
Same Way like Jim Hart at
Michigan, they don't hit, he goes,

980
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,150
if you don't have to hit at this level,
you're not going to make it. Right.

981
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,380
They only hit on game days when it counts.
Right.

982
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,290
So you see this kind of trend happening
with people who've been through it

983
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:18,240
before, like a cowboy cowboy
hardly respires anymore.
Yeah, he does mostly drills.

984
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:21,780
Mitt work, you know it your own too. Like
you see this kind of guy that's like,

985
00:56:21,781 --> 00:56:25,120
man, I can't begin beat up in training
anymore more. It doesn't make sense.

986
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,340
God Damn. Especially at
heavyweight, you know,

987
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:30,670
big guys the size of Mitch around giving
each other brain damage, bad idea,

988
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,860
terrible that I can only
do it so many times.

989
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:38,370
And I think when you see a guy like Conor
with all the different experimenting

990
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,050
that he does with like weird movements,

991
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:44,160
Tufts with that ido portal
guy like rights and shit.

992
00:56:44,161 --> 00:56:45,370
Even the weird shit that he does,

993
00:56:45,371 --> 00:56:48,000
like when you see him like
switching stances in the,

994
00:56:48,001 --> 00:56:50,590
in the rings switching stances,
like a taekwondo guy,

995
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:54,460
like he's in a taekwondo tournament.
If he all that weird shit,

996
00:56:54,461 --> 00:56:56,350
if he can do shit like that,
the Floyd,

997
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,830
all that stuff that he's never seen
before. Sideways stance, you know,

998
00:56:59,831 --> 00:57:01,960
moving more like a karate fighter.

999
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:05,570
He's going to come out more karate than
people are expecting us. I as poly,

1000
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:08,440
you know, I said, you know Polly has
his issues with and I'm like, yeah,

1001
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:10,720
that's terrible. But
how was, how was this,

1002
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:13,690
was it as awkward as I'm predicting
cause yeah, no, Carter goes,

1003
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:16,840
it goes in and get starch. My time,
I'm out showtime. That's my time.

1004
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,120
Have a good night. You know what I'm
saying? Like I look like an asshole.

1005
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,580
But he was saying, he was like, Nah man,

1006
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:24,140
he gets even more awkward than
I than I thought. Like, it's,

1007
00:57:24,141 --> 00:57:28,950
it's tough to deal with. He said one time
it has palm up like this. Yeah. Like,

1008
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:32,280
like Leo Machida Shit. Oh, it's definitely
going to do that. And it plays like,

1009
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,210
I have no idea who that is.
I'm like look him up.

1010
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:38,530
He doesn't know who the auto Machida's.
How dare, how daring Polly, how dare you.

1011
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,200
He knows Jujitsu. That was like
my morse prediction of all time.

1012
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:44,540
Welcome to the MACHITA era.
Probably my worst predictions. Oh,

1013
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:47,110
there was a Machida
era. No, not like that.

1014
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:50,840
Like he lost right away after
that we murked show guns. Right.

1015
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:55,630
Murked Rashad. Well he didn't Merch
Shogun shogun knocked him out.

1016
00:57:55,670 --> 00:58:00,080
Oh that's right. Get lost him. But
they had that back and forth. Right.

1017
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:04,900
Well he ended up or shot. He fucked
up or shot knowing the title 10 title.

1018
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:09,730
Who beat him right after that
and then John crushed him.

1019
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,570
And then once John crush
him crush his dreams. Yeah.

1020
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,520
And then it drops down to 85 great.
Against Munoz.

1021
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:20,350
There was a Leo Machida like when we say
the air, I mean yeah, there was still,

1022
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:23,170
but I try to use the game.
He definitely changed a lot,

1023
00:58:23,171 --> 00:58:25,450
but I thought he was going
to go on a crazy run man.

1024
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:29,530
So as we got there John Jones to to to do,

1025
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,880
uh oh he lets her rampage but that
had to go back a little bit more.

1026
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,940
Go back a little bit more. So where
does, where does the Rashad fight? Okay,

1027
00:58:36,941 --> 00:58:41,680
so he fought Rashad and then he fought.
That's what it is. He fought shogun next,

1028
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:44,470
but he should have lost
that fight and he won,

1029
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:48,100
but still yet a lot and then
show you lots of two years.

1030
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:53,260
So remember he beat dealer that and that's
real Tito Ortiz. Merck Thiago Silva.

1031
00:58:53,261 --> 00:58:57,700
At the time Thiago Silva was f
straight savage destroys Rashad.

1032
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,060
Then he ekes by Shogun.
What he meant when he jumped in front,

1033
00:59:01,061 --> 00:59:03,880
kicked Randy in the face and knocked out.
Randy's too.

1034
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,470
That was good. Yeah. That
was a little rough from them.

1035
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,890
Then he fought John beat Ryan Bader
with that crazy knockout. That was nuts.

1036
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,630
Ryan being a ran into that crazy,
a straight left hand just rushed him.

1037
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:21,100
Those here in a la and the Munoz fight.
I remember that was in like London.

1038
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,500
Some shit. I remember Munios
Fan. I was trained with Munoz.

1039
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:26,330
He found out through social media
is fighting Machida. It was like,

1040
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:30,890
Oh fuck that was in England. Whoa.
Then he got smashed by Weidmann.

1041
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:35,540
Hey did they CB dollar and then
Rockhold one was the worst.

1042
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:38,240
That was marijuana is really bad too.

1043
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,360
That was gruff and then he tested
positive for something, right? Yeah.

1044
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:44,780
And then I don't know exactly
what he's doing now. Yeah man.

1045
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:48,380
You get a certain amount of knockouts
against guys like Rockhold and especially

1046
00:59:48,381 --> 00:59:51,860
the Rockhold one was rough to
get on top of doing it though.

1047
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:56,600
He's been doing karate since
he was fucking three months
old and he's just been

1048
00:59:56,601 --> 00:59:59,210
doing it for a long ass time and yeah,

1049
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:04,540
it's interesting like these guys
like Vito and him where their, their,

1050
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,140
their technique is still there.

1051
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:10,170
Their mind is still there but their
body just can't keep up. Again,

1052
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,900
we'll give it a shot,
give a shot.

1053
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:14,010
That's to me that when I looked
at his fight in Mexico City,

1054
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:17,630
he's fighting on the undercard against
Sam, Alvin Miguel. Oh my God, man.

1055
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:22,700
And I love Rashad and the guy had been
trading with forever and to see him,

1056
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:24,950
and I don't think,
I don't know if the matter of physical,

1057
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:28,940
but mentally you can tell he's just not,
he's not there as far as,

1058
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:31,560
not that he's punchy,
but he just doesn't want to do anymore.

1059
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:33,980
Like he's not pulling the trigger.
He's been knocked out before.

1060
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:37,670
I was the same way. Once I got knocked
out, fee things change. Go. Okay,

1061
01:00:37,671 --> 01:00:39,020
I'm not gonna,
I'm not going to fight like that anymore.

1062
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:43,650
That kind of caution in the wind. Let's
go. Let's sit in the pocket and bang. No,

1063
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,110
no, no, no, no. I've learned from that.

1064
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,610
And then Rashad just couldn't
pull the trigger. I, I think,

1065
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:52,570
I think he's swaying towards being done
well. He's holds a shrine now. Shit.

1066
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:57,680
How old is Rashad? Him? He gets 39 yeah,
he's up there. Yeah, he's had a great run.

1067
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,060
He's definitely had a great run,

1068
01:00:59,061 --> 01:01:04,040
but you obviously enjoys doing it or he
wouldn't be still doing it or the money.

1069
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:06,780
Yeah. I don't know. One of the 37 yeah,

1070
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:11,210
but the other thing with our shot is
the games advanced so much further than

1071
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,560
wrestler with good boxing. You can't,
you can't fuck with that anymore.

1072
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:18,950
At light heavyweight middleweight
welterweight, you go down. What?

1073
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:22,670
You only have to ask, you only
have two tools. You're screwed man.

1074
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,620
I kinda like yard Rodriguez. All these
young kids go, you only Rasul and box.

1075
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,960
Oh my God, I'm eating him
alive. But he can kick. I mean,

1076
01:01:29,961 --> 01:01:33,160
remember he knocked out Sean Salmon with
that high care got 10 as old school and

1077
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:36,160
Sean Sam and looked like every
ups driver we've ever had. Yeah.

1078
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:40,340
But I would would think that he
would get better at that. You know,

1079
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:42,770
and it just never became
like a big part of his game.

1080
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,740
His game was never like
full on Moyie Thai oriented.

1081
01:01:45,741 --> 01:01:49,790
Now it's like the Chuck Ladell thing.
You know where sprawl and brawl.

1082
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:53,270
I'm going to fuck you up with my hand.
Crazy as he trains with Tyrone Spong.

1083
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:54,560
I know.
I mean,

1084
01:01:54,561 --> 01:01:59,561
Tyrone Spong is fucking demon
when it comes to standup man.

1085
01:01:59,661 --> 01:02:03,440
Dude, he Merck's, this dude's so bad.
And this was at light heavyweight,

1086
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:07,460
which is interesting because all along
a lot of people thought he should be at

1087
01:02:07,461 --> 01:02:10,520
one 85 he won the ultimate
fighter heavyweight come crazy.

1088
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:14,750
Is that if I Brad imes. Yes.
Giant ass dude in the finals.

1089
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:19,560
Yeah, Rochelle. It's just tough man.
And he's a dude to play football too,

1090
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:24,120
right? Yeah, high school. But
then he wrestled at Michigan
State. His roommate was,

1091
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:27,240
uh, Greg, uh, Maynard crazy man.

1092
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:29,940
And then the other roommate is a big
agent at CAA, which is hilarious.

1093
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,340
All them are killing it.
You know, you remember, uh,

1094
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:35,550
his knock out of chocolate dough. That
was probably like the biggest highlight.

1095
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:38,600
Our Oh,
AV or in the UFC really wouldn't play it.

1096
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:40,080
Just Chuck Ladell was like the main man.

1097
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:43,120
Remember for a while there they went
play the chuck or Rhonda knockouts turn

1098
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:47,520
that bitch on, fosters the loop.
Well, once WMA became the owners,

1099
01:02:47,521 --> 01:02:51,410
they're like lists and like we don't
play that game where we're here to self.

1100
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:56,940
Correct. I know he's your boy. Oh,

1101
01:02:56,941 --> 01:03:01,250
there it is. Right there.
One shot, I was a crazy,

1102
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:06,680
crazy high kick. They sh, I think they
showed the chocolate. They'll knock out.

1103
01:03:06,681 --> 01:03:09,230
They just didn't highlight it
over and over. Over a long time.

1104
01:03:09,231 --> 01:03:12,830
They went show chuck or Rhonda
that Chuck one was so like,

1105
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:17,750
I remember that sound of that right
hand land. Just Blab, upper cut.

1106
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:20,180
Oh No.
Chuck was going to throw the upper cut,

1107
01:03:20,181 --> 01:03:25,010
his famous upper gut and then just that
and reshot depth Dover with the overhand

1108
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:28,640
right on the fucking button,
like a gunshot.

1109
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:32,780
I remember chage turmeric path, like
his heart. He's like, yeah, here it is.

1110
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:37,490
Chuck's just, chuck was just such
a fucking executioner. Chuck.

1111
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:41,240
There's rumors chuck wanted to fight
again. He's in Thailand Training Shit.

1112
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,310
Wow.
Hello.

1113
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:49,010
Great timing by Rashad.
Perfect.

1114
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,960
Bowshot look at the fucking impact
to that right hand that it's crazy.

1115
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:59,420
My God. You know, talking about
chuck and Tito again and Bella tour,

1116
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,500
we'll talk about shale and Tito. They're
talking about challenge Tito first,

1117
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:06,140
the child, Taylor talking shit
to each other. They just fight.

1118
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:10,250
They just fight and catch
a neck reconstructed and
he has a tube in his neck.

1119
01:04:10,251 --> 01:04:13,610
But then chill, start talking
shit to fake discs. Oh my God.

1120
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:17,840
He got discs replaced it. We'd go
full. Go to Tito's a Instagram page.

1121
01:04:17,841 --> 01:04:20,690
He talked about it and then he
said, chill, I'm kicking your ass.

1122
01:04:20,691 --> 01:04:24,690
It was like so progress. Hey Tito, chill.
I love both of you. Now I may know,

1123
01:04:24,691 --> 01:04:29,210
but he tried to watch that shit. A
ballot. Ours Pan. No one's watching it.

1124
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:34,510
I just saw it still sell.
He does still a draw in the,

1125
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:34,930
you know,

1126
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:37,760
if he could talk chill and it talking
some shit about him and people want to see

1127
01:04:37,761 --> 01:04:41,360
them happening. Get Pete up again.
It's actually a video though.

1128
01:04:41,361 --> 01:04:44,990
If you play the video, Jamie, it's on
his uh, somewhere on his Instagram.

1129
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:47,750
Oh look at that to say
winter. His neck, um,

1130
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:51,170
go to is just the whole thing and I'll
show you where it is. If you find it.

1131
01:04:51,171 --> 01:04:53,540
There it is. That's it. Listen,
let's play some volume on this.

1132
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:59,160
Alright. Surgery's done. Three
them off desk replacement.
And so you want to fight,

1133
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:01,810
Huh?
Disc replacement on my server,

1134
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,460
which is the neck area either let me call

1135
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:10,350
[inaudible] Smith and amazing
job. Valerie. Thank you so much.

1136
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:13,693
Thank you

1137
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:22,390
that your sport, everybody reached out
to me and Bridget sport. I'm alive.

1138
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:28,420
I'm fixed now. It's time
to get ready cause chill.

1139
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:29,320
I'm kicking your ass.

1140
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:34,480
Wait a minute.
But how crazy is that?

1141
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:38,650
A guy coming out of knee
neck reconstruction.

1142
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:42,850
He got three discs replaced.
Like do you know when the UFC,

1143
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:46,040
if you have more than
two discs replaced Ila,

1144
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,780
they don't think they are letting your
fight right now. Uh, it makes sense.

1145
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:54,730
They were talking about um,
uh, Rick story. Rick story
has some disc replacements.

1146
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:58,390
It was neck. Yeah. And they're like,
if you get to a certain amount,

1147
01:05:58,391 --> 01:06:01,610
like we've got one your lower
back one your neck like Ooh son,

1148
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:04,360
we're not sure if we want
to fuck with this liability.

1149
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:07,720
Well who knows how good the guy
did the neck thing. Like who,

1150
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:11,890
who did your thing like it's almost
like, oh, like who's building your car?

1151
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:16,900
We'll send them to your guy. Then UFC
like 70, the one guy who we can trust.

1152
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:18,340
Yeah.
How he shut down this career.

1153
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:20,980
How many dudes are doing this
neck reconstruction thing?

1154
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:24,610
Everyone switched over looking for a deal
at Eddie Bravo has got his back done.

1155
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:28,000
You know Eddie still having problems
with it though. It's not 100%.

1156
01:06:28,001 --> 01:06:31,600
A lot of people have problems with it.
I mean the backs tricky man. But uh,

1157
01:06:31,601 --> 01:06:35,230
one of the, one of his students, victor
had his done and he's a big dude.

1158
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:39,850
He's real big. He was like heavyweight
dude and it for him it's fine.

1159
01:06:39,851 --> 01:06:44,710
Like he was lifting weights like really
quickly and got back to Roland within a

1160
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:47,680
few months. I think it just depends man.
But with Tito, he's had so much of the,

1161
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:49,730
you know,
abuse as far as wrestling and fighting.

1162
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,340
He's got fusions too.
He's got all sorts of shit going on.

1163
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:59,170
Kakoa straight up fighter it. Neck
brace, Tongan chill. Get your ass ready.

1164
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:02,050
Like we're looking at, we're looking
at like a year from now, bro.

1165
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:06,090
Like how long does it take to recover from
those surgeries? I wonder because, uh,

1166
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,290
what Eddie was saying was that,
you know,

1167
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:12,220
like he might have pushed it too quick
and like reinjured it a little bit.

1168
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,660
I rarely went,
came and hit.

1169
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:16,180
Did he come in here like the next day
we're doing [inaudible] pain and he was

1170
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:18,190
like drinking high off his ass and
we're talking about, and he's like,

1171
01:07:18,191 --> 01:07:20,280
I'm not gonna rush into it.
Like I'm not doing much.

1172
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:24,680
But then if you're on the mats and you
know, this problem is rolling is too fun.

1173
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,950
Yeah, you can't roll if
you're injured. You know,

1174
01:07:26,951 --> 01:07:29,140
I think the only thing you should do ever,

1175
01:07:29,141 --> 01:07:32,680
if you're injured his drill and just use
it as a time to drill because you can

1176
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:36,610
get really good, he'd get really good by
drilling, but as soon as you're, like,

1177
01:07:36,611 --> 01:07:39,610
if you're dealing with something
that's recovering like a surgery,

1178
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:45,220
if you like, have to explode and
exert weird energy and weird ways,

1179
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:47,470
you never know, like you,
you don't want to get tapped.

1180
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:51,310
You don't want your guard to get past you
don't want, so you'll just fucking la.

1181
01:07:51,311 --> 01:07:54,220
You're in the middle of it, you'll
law. And when you do that, ma'am,

1182
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:58,340
palm messes it up. You feel the back
where you got surgery twinge again.

1183
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:01,180
You're like, ah, came over
fucked all that worked up.

1184
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:04,840
I'll tell you what's crazy speaking of
injuries is when I saw patty hooligan and

1185
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:08,170
Dublin, he and he's the
outgoing cro, you know,

1186
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:11,470
smart dudes speaks well we're
talking. I'm like, Dude.

1187
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:15,560
So once the next fight and his whole
team was just like, God dammit. I'm like,

1188
01:08:15,561 --> 01:08:16,050
what?

1189
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,560
I didn't hear him.
But he has a rare blood disorder,

1190
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:22,580
like less than 1% of the world have it.
And it's really not that dangerous.

1191
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:26,180
But if it did, if something were to
happen, it's like super dangerous.

1192
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:29,930
So the UFC is like, it's too much of a
risk. We can't, can't clear you to fight.

1193
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:34,700
So he's done. Whoa. So how
does the blood disorder work?

1194
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,840
I'm not sure you got me. I'll
have to look it up. Jamie.

1195
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:39,710
He has some super rare blood disorder.
Super,

1196
01:08:39,711 --> 01:08:42,670
super rare where you'll
have to look it up for,

1197
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:46,180
I don't want to this concern like if he
needs a transfusion or something. Yeah,

1198
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:49,670
something like that where the UFC, he's
just too high of a risk. So he's done.

1199
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:54,671
But he was open a gym without SBG with
Connor at their gym and then he decided

1200
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:59,540
to do his own like up the street. Why
you're doing that. But crazy story man.

1201
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:03,950
Crazy. I had no idea. I felt
I felt bad for him. But good
spirits, man. Good spirits.

1202
01:09:03,951 --> 01:09:07,040
He's going to start doing podcasts and
I want to start doing some other stuff.

1203
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:11,990
Well that's cool. You
know, here it is. Um,

1204
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:17,110
he was born with a factor missing
in his blood called factor 13.

1205
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:21,620
I never disclosed it until now and came
to the UFC is attention from a third

1206
01:09:21,621 --> 01:09:24,230
party. I can no longer pass the
medical requirements to compete.

1207
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:28,940
Only one in 5 million people are
diagnosed. So I knew that it was rare.

1208
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,420
Organizations wouldn't understand or
take a chance at me as a found out.

1209
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:36,530
Now I never explained in full to
John on my team the actual risks.

1210
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:40,700
Cause I didn't think there
was accessible access risks.

1211
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:44,960
What it sort of, if it's not, if he
doesn't think there is an access risk,

1212
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:48,530
it's a disorder that is only
dangerous for me and not my opponents.

1213
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:52,610
I really did see MMA is a way to have
a real shot at life for myself and my

1214
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:56,450
family and it turns out I was right. Wow.
I have mixed emotions. This is a sad,

1215
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:58,040
can you look up the disorder?

1216
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:02,810
How sad is it when you talk about a guy
who his spirits are super up like he was

1217
01:10:02,811 --> 01:10:05,120
joking about it. He's just like,
what the fuck you know? He is a,

1218
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,960
he's a son and his girl was there and
I was like, oh I felt so bad for him,

1219
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,680
but he was like, doll ball. I got
this. I'm doing my thing here at SPG.

1220
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:14,000
I got my own gym.

1221
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,350
You know like things are good and
I'm starting getting the podcast.

1222
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:19,320
He's going to be good at it too, man.
If you can get that good at fighting,

1223
01:10:19,321 --> 01:10:20,660
you get that good at anything.

1224
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:24,230
You just have to think about it the right
way here. It is. It is. It's a rare oh,

1225
01:10:24,231 --> 01:10:26,000
clotting. Oh yeah. Ooh.

1226
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:31,060
A bleeding disorder characterized by a
deficiency of clotting factor 13 clotting

1227
01:10:31,071 --> 01:10:34,370
factors or specialized proteins that
are essential for the blood to clot

1228
01:10:34,371 --> 01:10:38,690
properly. Oh, he's like a
hemophilia, uncontrolled
bleeding episode. Fuck all that.

1229
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:43,850
Like what if you get a Marvin Eastman
and the head starts in foreign blood and

1230
01:10:43,851 --> 01:10:45,350
they can't stop it.
You know,

1231
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:49,370
like something about foreheads
like forehead just bleed a lot.

1232
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:53,140
So should with them now. Elbows as you
show. Yes. Peak of the elbow. Hit like,

1233
01:10:53,141 --> 01:10:56,600
think about how much more forehead's
bleeding like a knee. Oh yeah.

1234
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:00,160
You know what I'm saying?
Elbows like fucking if we get needed,

1235
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:03,790
it's always in the face.
You're shit's all fucked up with patty.

1236
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:08,300
It's a bummer man. One in 5 million.
Crazy. And what are the odds? I know, man.

1237
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:12,080
Super heartbreaking. Do you know the odds
on Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor?

1238
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:16,220
Only four to one. Five to
one, right. Connor, I saw it.

1239
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,840
Maybe it's changed the
article's odd swing.

1240
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,940
I'd been on this hound,

1241
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:27,480
this Connor decried hound changing

1242
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:33,840
complete Conner date. Just changing the
odds. You really think he's got a chance.

1243
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:37,890
Yeah, I do. He's Beverly. Dude is a lot
bigger, man. It's like a Mack truck.

1244
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:41,350
He's awkward Floyd. Two
years off. I'm, I'm,

1245
01:11:41,351 --> 01:11:44,790
I'm a little curious why it was still
a junior. Bernard Hopkins. Correct.

1246
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:49,590
Plus Three 25 whoa.

1247
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:54,210
Whoa. It's down to three.
Take it back. Jesus Christ.

1248
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,780
Praise Zit in my four fifth do you
wanna hear something hilarious?

1249
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:58,880
Those odds are things,

1250
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:03,450
those are odds are smaller than
when he fought Canelo that's crazy.

1251
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:07,020
Those odds are changing because of the,
the fucking video.

1252
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:11,010
Just a matter of amount of
people were betting on Conner.

1253
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:14,810
I know how people are listening.
They might not know

1254
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:21,380
what the odds are. I would, I explain
odds. People are like, what the fuck man,

1255
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:24,360
how you win 100 bucks.
Most people,

1256
01:12:24,361 --> 01:12:27,680
I have to explain it every time we
go to the UFC to send someone. Yeah.

1257
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:29,640
When the odds first came out,
I fucked up.

1258
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:33,090
I thought you got 26 one I got
at 15 to 100 win by knockout.

1259
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:38,091
It's always so weird when you see the
numbers like plus four 50 like how who

1260
01:12:38,431 --> 01:12:42,450
comes out in the open with it,
you know if they opened with an odd,

1261
01:12:42,451 --> 01:12:44,310
that's when it gets really crazy.
How do they do that?

1262
01:12:44,311 --> 01:12:45,840
And it's like an expert opinion.

1263
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,020
They do it on purpose to get you they
cause they want bedding so they show our

1264
01:12:49,021 --> 01:12:51,420
purpose to get people to go here.
Show Floyd loves us.

1265
01:12:51,421 --> 01:12:53,910
Cause you know Floyd always bets
on himself in a Shitload of money.

1266
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:55,410
So Floyd's like yes,
keep it going.

1267
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:59,790
Did you see a footage came out that is
not footage but news leaked and I think

1268
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:03,720
it's all honey dicking that Zap Judah
knocked that Floyd Mayweather and training

1269
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:08,640
and Floyd shut down the gym. What?
Yeah, look that shit up Jamie.

1270
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:09,600
Pull that shit up.

1271
01:13:09,601 --> 01:13:13,140
Jamie telling you this APP Judah
yesterday they said knock them out.

1272
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:14,910
I think it's all smoke and mirrors.

1273
01:13:14,911 --> 01:13:17,820
I think Floyd just trying
to sell this to the Max.

1274
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:22,710
Well that would be smart. I'm Floyd's
part is brilliant. How close is he?

1275
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:25,980
Would Zap Judah that they would organize
that? I mean SAP Jews like, yeah,

1276
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:29,210
I'll take that. Shine was the last time
you mentioned the name Psap. Judah.

1277
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:30,060
Very good point.

1278
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,110
Word from inside the money teams Abdu
to knocked out Floyd maybe in sparring

1279
01:13:34,111 --> 01:13:37,020
during a wild exchange where
both boxes began to brawl.

1280
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:40,140
Apparently Floyd kicked everyone out
of the gym afterwards. More to come.

1281
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:44,370
Zap was mimicking Connor and
just came right after him. Whoa.

1282
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:49,260
Says Mario Vegas Post Mario
Vegas and we trust Mario. Mario.

1283
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:53,580
Talk to me. Well, look at him.
That glamor shot, glamor shot.

1284
01:13:53,581 --> 01:13:56,280
Head shot bothers the fuck out.
It doesn't bother me at all.

1285
01:13:56,281 --> 01:13:59,010
He looks like a very reasonable
American's 14 tweets.

1286
01:13:59,011 --> 01:14:01,950
I'm sure a hundred followers.
Sure he votes conservative.

1287
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:06,990
You know what I think you could have a
conversation with. I think he's a troll.

1288
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,140
I wouldn't mind having a beer with them.

1289
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,690
I don't believe that.
I think there'd be more smoked.

1290
01:14:13,691 --> 01:14:17,180
I think literally Floyd's just
playing this full. He'll like,

1291
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:21,730
I got knocked out. Look Conner
definitely a week before or word Zap.

1292
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:24,640
Judah and him might have gone to war
because he does go to Warren gyms.

1293
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:28,270
He does make you seem talk shit and
go to war warm with people in sparring

1294
01:14:28,271 --> 01:14:31,840
sessions as Abdula Young
Ethan's. Absolutely. It's true.

1295
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,750
But Zap Judy can crack. We
know that factors. Yeah.

1296
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:38,170
He cracked Floyd a few times when they
fought, if you remember that he can crack.

1297
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:42,820
Yeah. Floyd Mayweather and Zap
Judah unleash chaos in Las Vegas.

1298
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:45,350
April. Yeah. Wow.

1299
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:49,300
It's back at the temperate battle between
Mayweather and the current sparring

1300
01:14:49,301 --> 01:14:52,950
partners have Judah. Yeah. They had
a great war man. Phenomenal fun.

1301
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:56,380
And if Zap Judah, I mean look,
zap Jude is lightning fast.

1302
01:14:56,381 --> 01:15:00,190
If he hasn't lost a step and they actually
did get into a wild exchange and he,

1303
01:15:00,191 --> 01:15:04,330
Floyd got crazy. It is entirely
possible. It hasn't lost a step.

1304
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:08,000
I mean guarantee has.
Yeah, probably. Probably.

1305
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,960
I mean as far as like his speed and power,
I bet it's still there.

1306
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,450
I mean it's like timing,
but I'm what I'm trying to set you right.

1307
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,540
His reaction to losing a staff is
probably not the best way to describe it,

1308
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:20,530
but he's still got it skills and he's
still got some serious power for shows how

1309
01:15:20,531 --> 01:15:22,810
to drop bombs.
And if he drops a bomb on Floyd,

1310
01:15:22,811 --> 01:15:24,430
if they really did have
some crazy exchange,

1311
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:27,010
it's 100% possible that you could imagine.
Correct.

1312
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:30,640
Zap Judah not released knocking
down Floyd. I'll tell you this.

1313
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,750
If he did get knocked out a week before
the fight and you fight and hung Antonio

1314
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:37,310
Saturday Bueno, we go and Sizzler,
I might just fucking no Bueno.

1315
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:39,550
Omnipresent showtime.
Everybody.

1316
01:15:39,551 --> 01:15:42,860
I like the same story kind of happened
before the packout Mayweather fight and

1317
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:47,530
uh, well maybe did it happened if it
said Florida flooring's Zap Judah denies

1318
01:15:47,531 --> 01:15:50,770
flooring. Mayweather doing
sparring is prepare shit.
Maybe they have Jesus, whoops,

1319
01:15:50,771 --> 01:15:55,600
his ass Uriah faber style. Probably so
comfortable with being there with Floyd.

1320
01:15:55,720 --> 01:16:00,550
He's box Floyd professionally as a
fighter and as training part true. Like,

1321
01:16:00,551 --> 01:16:03,750
you know, like you get each of other's
patterns. You understand those patterns.

1322
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,920
Yeah. And who knows? Also,

1323
01:16:05,921 --> 01:16:10,190
you know like who knows how seriously
Floyd's taking this, that's the thing.

1324
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,120
Need the money for sure. That's the
other thing is like rumors coming out.

1325
01:16:13,121 --> 01:16:16,150
Like again, these are all rooms. Have
you seen the condition rumors too?

1326
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:20,170
I love the drama kids. So excited too.
I'm like, yes. Yes. What else happened?

1327
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:24,310
Keep it coming. Come on. Um, have
you seen the picture of Floyd at 40?

1328
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:28,900
It looks good. Good. I'm a fuck you. It
looks like he's on that Brock Lesnar.

1329
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:33,640
He looks red and he looks great under 2.5.

1330
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:37,150
Wow. Wow. Wow, wow, interesting. Um,

1331
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:39,090
that's the only way
Mcgregor's going to win.

1332
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:42,850
I think if it's under the two and a half
I'll, no, not in an under two and a half,

1333
01:16:42,851 --> 01:16:46,870
but by stoppage I think. Yeah, me too.
I can't imagine him out boxing. No,

1334
01:16:46,871 --> 01:16:48,020
that ain't happening yet.

1335
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:51,500
You're living in a rung fucking planet
if you think you've seen to help box

1336
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:55,000
around of them. Unless he figures
out a way to mall. I'm like,

1337
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:58,330
he's done a style like he's doing there
with holding the back of the head and

1338
01:16:58,331 --> 01:17:00,610
throwing punches,
but that's after he's worn Paulie out.

1339
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:01,690
I think you're going to see,

1340
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:05,350
I think you see Connor using his footwork
still the distance trying to, you know,

1341
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:07,810
still do what got him to the dance.
He might.

1342
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:12,440
What if he drops one on Floyd
and Floyd go stiff face plants?

1343
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:16,610
I would love that. I think he's going
to land one on Floyd. I think so.

1344
01:17:16,611 --> 01:17:19,970
I think Carter went, when's the
spectacle? The probably loses in decision,

1345
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,450
but if there is a stoppage it's
Connor knocking them out. Well,

1346
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:27,770
you know we're talking today about them
going to eight ounce gloves and how how

1347
01:17:27,771 --> 01:17:31,240
significant the official commission just
granted it. That first of all shows you,

1348
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,550
you could just, you could just pull
those commissioners a silent go.

1349
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:39,480
What's these rule drug testing?
Why are we talking about rules?

1350
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:42,860
Let's have some fun here.
Let's have some fun.

1351
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:47,120
I wonder if WME came along like when
they bought the UFC that like, oh, what?

1352
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:50,750
What's, what do you saw the guy? Yeah.
What's we need? What's up with the Golden?

1353
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:54,140
We got about another six months.
Can't we listen?

1354
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:56,110
Let's just direct that guy
towards weight cutting.

1355
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,480
Can you just have them like folks on the
guys than the undercarriage and we do

1356
01:17:59,481 --> 01:18:01,760
that. Hello? We get out of this.

1357
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:06,630
You saw of them for
rentals backing up percent,

1358
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:12,740
hundred percent when Andre Berto
said, when he fought Floyd,

1359
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:14,450
he's never been tested more in his life.

1360
01:18:14,451 --> 01:18:16,550
He was like four times a
week they'd knock on my door.

1361
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:20,930
Stop all dressed up like agents.
That's what he says. He goes,

1362
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:23,840
are you testing Floyd like this?
They go, that's none of your concern.

1363
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:28,610
He was just the promoters obligation as
the promoters. Floyd Mayweather. He goes,

1364
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:31,970
you'll figure it out. He just
kept getting tested nonstop. Yeah.

1365
01:18:31,971 --> 01:18:35,160
He wants more of your blood. He wants
you to make you tired, you know? Yeah.

1366
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:36,140
I'll tell you what though.

1367
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:39,170
I don't know what the drug
testings like on this bad boy, but

1368
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:44,750
it was interesting because he made
Connecticut down to one 50 you know they

1369
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:45,830
fought at one 50 and can,

1370
01:18:45,831 --> 01:18:49,520
they always makes people to come to him
like you have to play by his rules and

1371
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:52,020
his fight though. That's
what's so scary. Yeah.

1372
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:55,960
That's why I tip my hat to Floyd because
he went to fight at one 54 that's like,

1373
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,420
that's all right. That's
perfect for Connor. Yeah. I
will do a dance clubs. What?

1374
01:18:59,421 --> 01:19:03,000
The frills? Yeah. Yeah. We'll
do that. We'll do it all.

1375
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:06,410
Take on short notice to
this motherfucker is crazy.

1376
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,300
I just think he thinks he's so good.

1377
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,810
He might just not understand
like first of all,

1378
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:14,980
Connor is whether or not you'll look.

1379
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:17,030
You're looking at his
success inside the octagon,

1380
01:19:17,031 --> 01:19:20,390
which had been pretty spectacular,
but it's the way he's doing things.

1381
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:25,510
He's got this special fucking air about
him and this very psychotic belief in

1382
01:19:26,721 --> 01:19:30,560
himself. It's a D it's not
a fake belief. No, he's not.

1383
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:32,120
He's not trying to con anybody.

1384
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:36,740
He's trying to manifest like some
sort of miraculous existence.

1385
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:42,010
He's trying to be the guy who literally
goes in there and drops and smashes

1386
01:19:42,351 --> 01:19:47,351
Floyd Mayweather as a UFC fighter and
then becomes with that the biggest athlete

1387
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:51,770
on the planet earth. Ever. Maybe ever,

1388
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,990
if he flatlines Floyd made in Fort Wayne,

1389
01:19:53,991 --> 01:19:58,991
where are there steps in
and Connor fucking karate
stance is ham and blast them

1390
01:19:59,391 --> 01:20:03,890
with a straight left hand and we see Floyd
stiffen up and face plant North Korea

1391
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:08,300
nukes where we're going to turn
the ocean green shit. Okay.

1392
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:12,000
We're all, we're going to
manufacture all of the color.

1393
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:14,670
That green color that you put in
drinks on Saint Patrick's day,

1394
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:19,320
pouring that shit in the ocean. We're
making the ocean green. Just all green.

1395
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,530
Just huge statues of Conor.

1396
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:25,530
You're going to have people
that are faking Irish accents.

1397
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:28,890
That's sort of like that. Rachel
Dolezal chick pretended to be black,

1398
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:32,640
is going to be people that are changing
but put a show on the beginning.

1399
01:20:32,641 --> 01:20:33,920
Agritech tattoos on their chest.

1400
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:38,340
They're going to change themselves and
become Irish. They're going to be trans.

1401
01:20:38,341 --> 01:20:40,320
It'll get that. That's what the
world's going to done. What is that?

1402
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,860
When did that happen? Cargo on Saint
Patrick's Day. They do that really?

1403
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:46,533
Other fish.

1404
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:53,310
Oh my God, we're so gross.
People are so gross.

1405
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:57,630
Let's have some fun and get fucking
hammered it and make the ocean greed.

1406
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:03,360
The fish are like, what the fuck? I
can't believe they really do this.

1407
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:08,130
It's awesome though. Oh my God. It's
like a domino. It's only in Chicago.

1408
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:13,590
I'm amazed that Boston doesn't take
this on. You're fucking battle in me.

1409
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:16,410
They don't in fucking
Chicago. Really? Shit.

1410
01:21:16,411 --> 01:21:21,030
I feel like it's a bad idea can be,
well it's probably some food based stuff.

1411
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:25,740
The family that dies the Chicago
River Green. Wow. The Hawk family.

1412
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:29,730
How weird is pure toxic?
Yeah. Wonder how bad it is.

1413
01:21:29,731 --> 01:21:33,480
And one if there's like
some environmentalists that
are protesting or percent

1414
01:21:33,481 --> 01:21:37,200
that can't be great for anything in
there that's just died. It's natural.

1415
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,680
Not really. Why don't you? Um,

1416
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:44,720
Google environmentalist protest
green dye in Chicago River.

1417
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:46,141
See,

1418
01:21:46,141 --> 01:21:49,420
let's see if there's some
environmentalists that
think it's fucking terrible.

1419
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:53,660
I 60 pounds of die. That's it.
At top secret format. Awesome.

1420
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:57,630
As we call it. Leprechaun dust. I'll fuck
you. How about you tell us what the fuck.

1421
01:21:57,631 --> 01:22:02,631
The top secret formula right
now with your tits tits.

1422
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:05,940
The Dad on the right. Oh yeah.
Set of sweet old old man.

1423
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:10,560
We get them and it's like a
mock turtleneck that looks
like the Kinda Guy who

1424
01:22:10,561 --> 01:22:12,090
kills a burger with his bare hands.

1425
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,690
He looks like the kind of guy that kills
millions of fish by dumping green dye

1426
01:22:15,691 --> 01:22:20,370
in the Goddamn river. We get those
fucks. Fuck is drowned in mermaids.

1427
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:26,830
I get their gills all clogged gut
leaky. Those guys got, damn it.

1428
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,410
Yeah, you're right though man. If
God were to pull it off, I don't.

1429
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:32,580
He's the biggest athlete of
all time. Oh, all the time.

1430
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:35,760
He's going to be worldwide in
the in the craziest way possible.

1431
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:38,400
You see a Nike shoe like to join,
but with this on it,

1432
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:41,100
if he actually can land that shit,
there's the thing.

1433
01:22:41,101 --> 01:22:45,330
Nobody's gonna ever box Floyd like
that from a karate stance. Never.

1434
01:22:45,331 --> 01:22:48,770
He's never seen it before and he's been
doing a lot of that taekwondo footwork

1435
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:51,480
thing where he switches back
and forth switches Stanson ton.

1436
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:53,670
If he can keep that kind of distance,

1437
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,980
it's going to be very hard
for Floyd to hit him too.

1438
01:22:55,981 --> 01:22:59,940
It's a totally different feel. Different
fields. The only thing I think,

1439
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:04,020
worst case scenario, obviously worst
case you get starch in like 10 seconds.

1440
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:04,831
That's not going to happen.

1441
01:23:04,831 --> 01:23:08,020
But worst case it would be with eight
ounce gloves and Floyd sarcs landing and

1442
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:11,440
beating him up and he gets stopped like
seventh or eighth or can't answer the

1443
01:23:11,441 --> 01:23:14,110
bell cause he's taken so much
punishment or an eight rounds.

1444
01:23:14,111 --> 01:23:18,080
He gets really tired from Logan so much.
Then it could be a shit show for it.

1445
01:23:18,081 --> 01:23:20,620
It's a different expenditure
of energy for sure.

1446
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:24,190
Different animals switching legs like
that and switches dances, but hey listen,

1447
01:23:24,191 --> 01:23:25,150
he's doing in training.

1448
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:28,570
You don't get to counters level without
realizing what you're signing for.

1449
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:32,080
It like to me,
if Carl were to gas in this fight,

1450
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,650
there's a sear and then everything
we believe in commerce fake,

1451
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:38,920
which I don't think it's going to happen.
While the only other explanation B,

1452
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:43,300
he's not quite efficient enough yet
to go 12 rounds of the world champion.

1453
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:47,770
You know if he really started gas like
you're talking about something that he

1454
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:52,480
has a part of his training but it's
also kicking takedown down defense,

1455
01:23:52,481 --> 01:23:55,990
Jujitsu, elbows, knees and
some say is more down. Yes,

1456
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:59,050
we'll definitely cardio was a lot of
people say it's more difficult like inbox

1457
01:23:59,051 --> 01:24:00,580
and get your rest and like in boxing,

1458
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:03,950
which is why I think Conor is going to
win a majority of those early rounds and

1459
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,310
you know Floyd, you know, four, five,

1460
01:24:06,311 --> 01:24:09,880
six rounds before he's really even start
sweating and he downloads your patterns

1461
01:24:09,881 --> 01:24:12,460
that goes to work.
The Andre Berto said that he goes,

1462
01:24:12,461 --> 01:24:16,180
he comes out and he'll force you to
come to him and he's looking around.

1463
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:17,950
He's literally downloading everything,

1464
01:24:17,951 --> 01:24:21,040
but it takes them a while to get going
before he gets it and then starts going

1465
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:25,440
to work with Connor. I think
in those rounds he can land
something big there. Man.

1466
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:31,000
If he does see the exciting thing is,
if he does, that's exciting thing.

1467
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:33,910
That's what, that's what's going to make
it the biggest paper view of all time.

1468
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:36,190
Those white power people
are going to go crazy.

1469
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:39,910
That Twitter account is a fake
account apparently. Which one? New,

1470
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,350
it's not a real newspaper.

1471
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:45,160
And some people I found out
that the picture is even
like a small business owner

1472
01:24:45,161 --> 01:24:49,710
from somewhere else. Which which uh,
the Zap judo, the troll doll account.

1473
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:55,460
Okay. So the him knocking him
out, his fake. That's Dennis.

1474
01:24:56,030 --> 01:25:00,190
I told you, hey, hey boy
trolling the fake guy.

1475
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:05,370
He looks like the average American.
You had to get shot Avatar or like Iowa.

1476
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,320
You went to Iowa, you went to a
family restaurant. Hi, welcome.

1477
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:11,110
They all look like go to Las
Vegas Post and nothing comes up.

1478
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:12,790
Oh that son of a bitch.
Damn it flood.

1479
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:14,860
You've got to do better at
selling this man. There's some,

1480
01:25:14,861 --> 01:25:17,710
while it might not even be him, it might
just be somebody just going for clicks,

1481
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:21,690
you know, having some fun. A lot of
people make up stories. It's true.

1482
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:25,090
Flood hasn't come out and say anything,
but you don't like my mom will be like,

1483
01:25:25,091 --> 01:25:29,410
why did he got knocked out and buying
it? It works. It does work well,

1484
01:25:29,411 --> 01:25:32,410
especially after looking at that video.
I mean that's what ramps it up.

1485
01:25:32,411 --> 01:25:36,400
Looking at the video of Khan
and landed on Paula, Dana White,

1486
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:40,510
put some more video out. That's all
I'm saying. He has a full taste.

1487
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:45,511
Here's the full footage from what I heard
from what I heard is they thought that

1488
01:25:45,911 --> 01:25:48,820
footage is going to make it an all
access. And Dana was like, yeah,

1489
01:25:48,821 --> 01:25:51,550
put in the all access of Connor doing
what he did to Paula and they didn't put

1490
01:25:51,551 --> 01:25:55,510
in there. So Dana was like release the
hounds and then released on his end. Oh,

1491
01:25:55,511 --> 01:25:59,170
so showtime didn't put it in there?
No, no, no. It came from Dana.

1492
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,240
Did they not come from showtime?
Okay.

1493
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,440
Why would show time not
want to put in there?

1494
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:06,410
So they just denied putting it in there.
They didn't want to put it in there.

1495
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:09,290
I don't think that, I don't, I don't
think they, they denied that ever happen.

1496
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:11,550
They're just like,
we're not putting all access like for why?

1497
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,990
I have no idea who put that in all access.
I don't know.

1498
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:19,370
But that seems ridiculous. I don't know.
Are you trying to sell a fight or nay,

1499
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:23,330
but yeah, and then Dana was
like, Yo, you're not going
to do it. Release the hounds.

1500
01:26:23,331 --> 01:26:26,090
Everybody real advocate.
That's when it came from his account.

1501
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:29,360
Why the fuck would they not
play that clip? I don't know.

1502
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:32,870
I guess they love Pauly Paul.
He's an analyst for them. Right,

1503
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:36,530
but still it is what it
is. Yeah. If anything,

1504
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:39,020
I listen man.
It's spine.

1505
01:26:39,021 --> 01:26:42,800
We talked and we're talking about
practice like it's, it is what it is.

1506
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:46,160
[inaudible] loss those,
those,

1507
01:26:46,161 --> 01:26:49,580
those in those exchanges there was
a clear loser and a clear winner.

1508
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,580
It doesn't mean the entire
sparring session. No,

1509
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,270
and we won't know that
until after the fight.

1510
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,880
And most knowledgeable fighting
fans know that like, oh, that's a,

1511
01:26:56,881 --> 01:26:59,840
that's a part of it. But shit,
Connor can actually hit like shit.

1512
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:01,130
He looks pretty good.
He looks real.

1513
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:04,640
And even if you're a box and paying like
holy shit, that's poly mail and nausea.

1514
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:08,290
He just got rocked. Shit. Maybe
I won't buy the fight. Yeah,

1515
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:10,760
it's given me a wake us, no
matter what, I'm going to buy it.

1516
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:13,190
I'm going to buy it from fucking DC.

1517
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:15,530
I'm going to be in Washington DC
to your work in the night, right?

1518
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:18,140
Working that night. So if you
hear the crowd, oh my God,

1519
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:21,110
if they asked me to do something
to the showtime, but I'd be like,

1520
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:23,390
I don't even know what I would do.
Like what would I be doing?

1521
01:27:23,391 --> 01:27:27,980
Like it'd be offering my opinions. I
have none. I fly out next Monday for him.

1522
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:28,580
I'm working,

1523
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:32,300
I'm on the whole coverage team with
showtime Tuesday through Saturday.

1524
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:35,030
I don't know what I'm doing on
Saturday yet. Honestly. Dude,

1525
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:37,700
I really feel like if they were smart,

1526
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:42,650
like this is this kind of like the kind
of shit that we do when you and I just

1527
01:27:42,651 --> 01:27:45,440
sit down and talk. This is
really what they need. Yes.

1528
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:49,070
You get a bunch of goofy people sitting
around with ties on and some circle and

1529
01:27:49,071 --> 01:27:52,010
everyone's talking over everybody and
there's a production meeting and you say

1530
01:27:52,011 --> 01:27:53,810
this and you say this. I agree. Yeah.

1531
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:58,811
And there's morrow and then there's a
fucking two or three boxers and everyone's

1532
01:27:59,021 --> 01:28:03,500
Bernstein and they're all talking over
each other. It's, it's uh, it's not,

1533
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:04,550
in my opinion,

1534
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:07,880
it's not the most entertaining way
to listen to people break down shit.

1535
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,790
And this is a fight where you really,

1536
01:28:11,330 --> 01:28:13,940
you really want to consider all
the different possibilities.

1537
01:28:13,941 --> 01:28:15,920
Like Max Kellerman is always saying like,

1538
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:19,530
Floyd has the advantage if they're
fighting on the moon, Floyd has,

1539
01:28:19,531 --> 01:28:24,530
he had managed bare knuckle Floyd as the
advanced. Like okay, you totally sure.

1540
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:29,060
He totally sure Mr Skip Bayless method
where it's going to make headlines but

1541
01:28:29,061 --> 01:28:31,650
they don't have to believe that.
Macks believed that. I don't,

1542
01:28:31,690 --> 01:28:36,350
I don't think back to Lisa. I think
he's so, so old school boxing,

1543
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:38,900
he has to say he loves him and may too,
man.

1544
01:28:38,901 --> 01:28:42,350
I've had long conversations with kind
of, but I think smart, he's very smart.

1545
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:45,170
He's my favorite alias. I love
Max Guy. He's a very good note.

1546
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:48,670
When I was in a favorite, you're
well, I'm saying boxing Komatsu.

1547
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:53,180
Come on brother comes to box and when,
when when he goes, when he goes congress,

1548
01:28:53,181 --> 01:28:56,960
I can hit him and I was like, no,
just shred. I bet you $100,000 open,

1549
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:59,900
a joint account sent to his team like
this. How seriously I got Atlanta Glove.

1550
01:28:59,930 --> 01:29:02,270
Oh really? Come with man, come on Mac.

1551
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:05,750
It could happen that Floyd just storms
out and fucking one pudge chaos thing

1552
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:09,800
with showtime. I had this uh, chat
with us when knows about it and I said,

1553
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:11,490
I don't know what you know,
I don't be part of it.

1554
01:29:11,491 --> 01:29:12,630
I'm not sure where I'm gonna do.
I said,

1555
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:16,050
but what you have going on as you have
your traditional box and commentators,

1556
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:19,470
which is great and that's usually what
you do. This is not your typical fight.

1557
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:24,000
You cannot have a bias panel who don't
know anything about Conor Mcgregor. Yeah.

1558
01:29:24,001 --> 01:29:28,500
They looked as fights up or whatever
or they just mimic or say what they've

1559
01:29:28,501 --> 01:29:30,810
heard previously, but they really
don't know what Connor's doing.

1560
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:33,780
You have to have someone, whether it's me
or not, but I think it's going to be me.

1561
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:37,620
You have to have someone telling you what
Connor's doing, what he needs to do to,

1562
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:38,610
to win the fight.

1563
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:44,130
You can't have just a pro bias box and
commentating team because what's going to

1564
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:47,880
make this the biggest paper of all
time is the UFC fans. Of course,

1565
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:51,840
we're the ones that are going to buy
this bitch, the old box and heads.

1566
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:53,730
Look at triple g.
That's your best boxer.

1567
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,850
200,000 paper view buys probably
300,000 that's your path.

1568
01:29:56,970 --> 01:30:01,530
But you know Andre Ward is right up there
with him and Andre Ward gets way more

1569
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:03,360
now. He doesn't, they don't do very well.

1570
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:07,240
Look up Andre Ward Kovalev to what it was,
the pace of the box.

1571
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:11,810
275,000 that's it. But still a
hundred more than didn't triple g's.

1572
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:14,730
Still pretty match of a huge fight too.

1573
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:18,210
And I'm saying so the Dana White do UFC,
Conor McGregor,

1574
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:22,020
that fan base to UFC fan base is
like nothing else man. They would,

1575
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:23,220
I pay 100% true.

1576
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:28,080
So you can't have just a bias box and
contained Kovalev does just over 160,000

1577
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:31,620
oh my God, I'll put a picture of
me lifting weights in the back.

1578
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:35,580
God hundred and 65,000 buys.
Wow.

1579
01:30:35,581 --> 01:30:37,970
So that's basically the
same as triple g in the,

1580
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:42,980
in the ward Kovalev to does around
hundred 25,000 pay per view buys.

1581
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:45,420
How crazy is that?
Is that which one's right?

1582
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:51,430
Jalon ones July. Oh, the first
one versus the second one? No,

1583
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:55,650
the second one does 125 it's a
paper loop flop. So the most it did,

1584
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:59,580
it said it pulls in one 65 that was
the final thing, which is Tavon,

1585
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,580
which is a leader or to that
magnitude of that fight.

1586
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:07,610
No one is June 30th and it said one 25
and they still have June 27 160,000 the

1587
01:31:07,951 --> 01:31:11,670
second 125.0 no.
Really?

1588
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:16,230
Oh my God. That's terrible.
So it's that stuff failure,

1589
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:20,250
like you losing money when you do that.
And you paid Andre Ward, you know,

1590
01:31:20,251 --> 01:31:24,750
six and a half million dollars. Did he
get that much? Yeah. And that, you know,

1591
01:31:24,751 --> 01:31:27,370
you're talking about one of the best
fights of vault, especially the maze.

1592
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:30,360
And the fight is amazing.
What was more troubling,

1593
01:31:30,361 --> 01:31:32,850
not only the pay per view buys down,
but attendance numbers.

1594
01:31:32,851 --> 01:31:36,360
And Kate Revenue at Mandalay Bay Events
Center in Las Vegas was not even close

1595
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:39,420
to matching the first bout,
which is held at t mobile arena.

1596
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:44,640
It's tickets sold 6,000
tickets. Whoa, that's crazy.

1597
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:49,140
Wow. So if you're gonna make this
the biggest paper of all time,

1598
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:53,220
you've got a bank on the mixed
martial arts crowd by his thing. Yeah.

1599
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:56,100
So if you want them to buy it,
they're going to buy for coming anyways.

1600
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:59,040
But you've got to have a voice in there
that's at least going to relate to

1601
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:02,290
people. Yeah. And here's another
argument for the Andre Berto fight,

1602
01:32:02,291 --> 01:32:05,980
which was the retirement fight for Floyd.
He only got like 300,000 papers.

1603
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:07,420
Horrible. Horrible. When you,

1604
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:11,070
considering that he got 4 million
for the Manny Pacquiao fight, right?

1605
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:14,500
Wasn't something crazy like that 4
million, which is the biggest of all time.

1606
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:18,550
So he goes from the biggest of all time
to a fight worth 300,000 people buy it,

1607
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,220
which is like really mediocre.
Horrible.

1608
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:25,330
The only people are buying
Floyd Mayweather fights
or people that want to see

1609
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:28,450
Floyd Mayweather. They get fucked up.
Yeah. And when he doesn't get fucked up,

1610
01:32:28,451 --> 01:32:32,390
they go, damn, they get upset. See, I love
even Floyd apologize for the pack yet.

1611
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:36,310
But yeah, he was like, yeah, my
bat like that sucked. I that like,

1612
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:37,870
that was not fun man.
It was crazy.

1613
01:32:37,871 --> 01:32:40,990
Cause Pat Guy was injured and then pat
out fought that fight with a fucked up

1614
01:32:40,991 --> 01:32:44,170
shoulder pack. Yes. Hating on
this fight. I won't even watch it.

1615
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:47,950
I guarantee your ass it's more
entertaining than your fight with Floyd.

1616
01:32:48,150 --> 01:32:51,820
I can guarantee you that. He's just
still salty. Yeah. Cause he's not, he,

1617
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:55,990
he just lost the fucking homeboy Horn in
Australia and you have to rematch him.

1618
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:59,820
A school teacher straight up. Straight
up. That's the rich Franklin or boxing.

1619
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,600
Yeah.
Just,

1620
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:05,530
I don't know if that was the correct
decision because I didn't, uh,

1621
01:33:05,531 --> 01:33:08,260
I didn't try to score that. I see
both ways. I watched her twice.

1622
01:33:08,261 --> 01:33:11,960
I can see both ways, but, but uh, when
I was watching on my ground like door,

1623
01:33:11,961 --> 01:33:14,860
I'm like, God, I feel like corn might
have pulled that off. She's like, really?

1624
01:33:14,861 --> 01:33:18,700
I'm like, yeah, I can't listen
to the commentators. They're
soap bias against horn.

1625
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:21,610
I feel like he might've did enough
or especially early on. I'm like,

1626
01:33:21,611 --> 01:33:22,840
I kind of bring it to him.

1627
01:33:23,410 --> 01:33:26,050
How many times they get dropped
once or twice horn in the,

1628
01:33:26,051 --> 01:33:29,860
I think it was the 10th round, they almost
stopped it because the Knight Eight,

1629
01:33:29,861 --> 01:33:31,870
ninth or 10th one of those
rounds, they were like, hey,

1630
01:33:31,871 --> 01:33:33,920
if you don't show some improvement here,
we're going to stop the fight.

1631
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:38,860
So that was a rough round, but still the,
the, the culmination of all the rounds,

1632
01:33:38,861 --> 01:33:41,170
I thought horn pulled it off.
Interesting.

1633
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:44,560
Either there's argument for either one
still pack. Yeah. He lost the horn.

1634
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:48,670
You're going to hate on,
you know, Mayweather and
fucking Connor. Come on man.

1635
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:49,331
You're gonna Watch it.

1636
01:33:49,331 --> 01:33:52,930
He's still salty because also he's got
class action lawsuits against him because

1637
01:33:52,931 --> 01:33:56,590
he fought with a fucked up shoulder and
a lot of people bet on you. Fucked us.

1638
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:58,810
Yeah.
That's a weird situation.

1639
01:33:58,811 --> 01:34:01,780
If you're a fan and you know that the
guy came into the fight, compromise,

1640
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:05,200
get that paycheck, but for
pay, but at the same time,

1641
01:34:05,201 --> 01:34:08,190
a lot of fighters fight with injuries.
Right. That's a big one though. I mean,

1642
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:11,950
he's a puncher and his shoulder's
fucked. Like he can't throw. Hey Man,

1643
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:14,080
what did he do?
I guess they schedule.

1644
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:17,620
I wonder what they did they give them a
cortisone shot? What did they do? Yeah.

1645
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:20,740
I mean we didn't do it, but
if you're manly packet, what
do you do? Just like, Hey,

1646
01:34:20,741 --> 01:34:23,320
I'm injured. We're going to
have to reschedule a slate.
Oh, I think he figured,

1647
01:34:23,321 --> 01:34:25,720
well, I'm going to fuck it up.
I'm going to get surgery anyway.

1648
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:27,490
I just fuck it up further.
True.

1649
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:30,460
Go in there and sling bombs and
hopefully our catch and did nothing.

1650
01:34:30,461 --> 01:34:34,090
Horrible fight. Well, it's just, I think
he was really compromised in his movement.

1651
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:37,210
You know? I still don't think you'd beat
him, but, no, I don't think so either.

1652
01:34:37,211 --> 01:34:41,670
I think his style, and particularly as
much shorter and smaller than Conor,

1653
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:43,720
and he's a very fast,
but you know,

1654
01:34:43,721 --> 01:34:47,770
he's also been knocked out by Manmohan
Marquez when Juan manwell mark has

1655
01:34:47,771 --> 01:34:52,300
knocked him out without one punch.
Fucking devastating lamb. Kao Earth,

1656
01:34:52,330 --> 01:34:54,830
like literally stood still for a
second when that happened. Dude,

1657
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:58,140
I mean that was his clean
a one punch knock every

1658
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:01,520
going to see my face. Yeah,
it was a horrible knockout.

1659
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:04,100
Perhaps Marquez was on the
supplements of his home country.

1660
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:08,300
I think all of them were. Yeah, I think
both of them. I think there's, you know,

1661
01:35:08,301 --> 01:35:10,210
steroids in that pitch.
I think there's Mexicans,

1662
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:15,220
steroids and that was [inaudible] about
Manny is that Manny had gone up so many

1663
01:35:15,591 --> 01:35:19,670
different way classes and kept his
power and and people like, come on son.

1664
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:23,000
He was like, get the fuck out. It's
probably gay. I don't hate on those guys.

1665
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:26,150
I just assume he's doing it. I don't
hate on him either. I mean, look,

1666
01:35:26,151 --> 01:35:30,860
the deal is that a, you pass the
tests. That's the deal. Not Testing.

1667
01:35:30,861 --> 01:35:34,170
I don't give a fuck. You're fighting
Marquez. Who's clearly on those Tiawana

1668
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:40,770
Tiawana Tamale fucking protein powder.
Is he alive?

1669
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:43,670
Testosterone son? The
Teal on a test, you know,

1670
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:49,010
100% if he got in that Filipino,
you know what's crazy is that dude,

1671
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:52,370
I'm Juan Manwell Marquez
had the same trainer.

1672
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:57,320
They used to be a trainer for Manny. Who's
the Guy Hooked Hook? What's the name?

1673
01:35:57,340 --> 01:36:00,170
Angel. Uh, I think it's Alex something.

1674
01:36:00,190 --> 01:36:02,030
I thought it was like ally
it something like that.

1675
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:03,860
Really smart physical
conditioning trainer.

1676
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:08,210
He had Manny doing a bunch
of really interesting stuff.
He's very good. Very good.

1677
01:36:08,211 --> 01:36:12,530
But he got picked up before he got
busted before for like injecting the Bain

1678
01:36:12,531 --> 01:36:15,020
stuff. Yeah. He got in trouble before the,

1679
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:18,770
it was at the same dot guy that got in
trouble. Like that's his thing. Right?

1680
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:19,940
Like that's what he was known for.

1681
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:23,030
I know he's supposed to be a really
good trainer regardless. Well you know,

1682
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:26,570
I mean you kind of think when you
got a guy like a Floyd or one men,

1683
01:36:26,571 --> 01:36:29,570
Mel Marquez or you know anybody or Manny,

1684
01:36:29,890 --> 01:36:33,890
you got like a championship
caliber athlete. You know,

1685
01:36:33,891 --> 01:36:36,880
you got like you had a Ferrari.
Yeah.

1686
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:39,500
I mean you gotta make
sure the tires are good,

1687
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:42,800
suspensions tight and like you're
a physical conditioning trainer.

1688
01:36:42,801 --> 01:36:47,090
You can't fuck the guy up too bad. By the
time he gets to his boxing skill work,

1689
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:48,710
you don't want him to be that exhausted.

1690
01:36:48,711 --> 01:36:50,600
But also if we're racing
cars and you know,

1691
01:36:50,601 --> 01:36:52,790
homeboy over here put up feet 12 in his,

1692
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:56,380
he can't be running with a v 10
maths V12 we've got to manage that.

1693
01:36:57,490 --> 01:37:01,880
Let's get that Filipino hot sauce. Yeah,
like that's, that's the game though.

1694
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:03,141
Yeah,
I would man.

1695
01:37:03,141 --> 01:37:08,141
He was in his prime to God
whatever him judge Jack Jack Shit.

1696
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:12,830
And I remember he was like get strip
clubs, like wiling out very Jon Jones Ish.

1697
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:13,880
And then his wife was like,

1698
01:37:13,881 --> 01:37:17,900
this shit has to stop and
then got flashlight and he's
like, Jesus, let's do it.

1699
01:37:18,050 --> 01:37:18,321
Yeah.

1700
01:37:18,321 --> 01:37:21,950
He found the g's are stressing all weird
for government and changed his life.

1701
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:27,530
Changed his life. I don't know if
that's the best thing for fighters, man.

1702
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:32,720
Oh, who knows? It's a problem as,
especially now with testing, you know,

1703
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:35,900
they show up at your house and knock
on the door. You gotta be clean. Yeah.

1704
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:39,110
You got a rubber dick and a really
good friend. Even missing blood.

1705
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:41,240
Even then you're in trouble, man. Yeah.

1706
01:37:41,241 --> 01:37:46,241
You got to have a twin and have that
twin like live a steady healthy diet.

1707
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:50,870
I don't just don't tell anybody about him.
Just leave him in the basement.

1708
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:55,170
Look at them. They're against Marcos
Antonio, Bruh. Do I got pissed so bad.

1709
01:37:55,171 --> 01:37:59,530
Can I pee right way? Hold it down. Super
jacked there. There's ones where you list,

1710
01:37:59,570 --> 01:38:03,060
he's looked jacked.
Damn Jack there too.

1711
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:08,960
That's the other Floyd
fight. Yeah. When it,

1712
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:13,860
when he was like, when he first
started out he was, I think he was,

1713
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:18,630
I think he started out as a
flyweight like I'm not sure though.

1714
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:22,920
I'd have to look at is a career record
pull up Manny Pacquiao is career record

1715
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:27,600
cause I'm pretty sure he went through
eight different weight classes,

1716
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:31,740
which is crazy.
Really stop and think about that.

1717
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:35,600
I don't think very many
people have done it. So, oh,

1718
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:40,650
this is boring for a podcast which is
going over stats of Manny Pacquiao.

1719
01:38:41,730 --> 01:38:43,950
Who the fuck knows what's
going to happen? Man. That.

1720
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:45,900
What's interesting is that
it's actually going to happen.

1721
01:38:46,110 --> 01:38:49,170
I'm just a big fan of
freak shows and that's,

1722
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:52,200
and I don't mean that
disrespectfully like that.

1723
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:56,600
It's not a real contest obviously.

1724
01:38:56,730 --> 01:39:01,730
Obviously it is from a betting perspective
and obviously it is because Connor is

1725
01:39:01,891 --> 01:39:06,430
a real combat sports world champion,
but it's a freak show in that it's,

1726
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:08,460
we don't know.
It's not like,

1727
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:13,750
like if Connor fought Hofeld dos
Anjos at one 70 it's a fight like,

1728
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:16,770
Ooh, this is going to be interesting.
I wonder how that's gonna play out.

1729
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:18,480
I wonder if it's,
you know,

1730
01:39:18,481 --> 01:39:21,820
they were supposed to fight at one 55 I
wonder if Tilson Joe's can fit, you know,

1731
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:24,330
that kind of thing happens.
That's an interesting fight.

1732
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,330
That's interesting to think about.
You have all these variables.

1733
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:30,420
You've seen their fights.
Now we're seeing Connor box.

1734
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:33,390
You see like little tiny clips.
That's all he ever see.

1735
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:36,570
When's the last time where there's a
fight like this where it's like made like

1736
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:39,900
by the people I don't
think ever UFC at all.

1737
01:39:39,901 --> 01:39:42,660
Ever while there's James
Tony Versus Randy coture.

1738
01:39:42,661 --> 01:39:46,230
But James was well past
his prime and you know,

1739
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:49,410
really didn't train for it at all.
He didn't know. I mean there was,

1740
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:51,270
it was a video,

1741
01:39:51,271 --> 01:39:56,271
James toney preparing for the Randy coture
fight and he was way out of shape and

1742
01:39:57,811 --> 01:40:01,410
it was just kind of like hitting pads
and the guy who like shoot the worst

1743
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:05,130
double leg take down on
them and the history of the
known universe and James had

1744
01:40:05,131 --> 01:40:08,400
kind of sprawl and he be like, yeah, and
we're going to my rambling, you know,

1745
01:40:08,401 --> 01:40:11,090
working on my box and no one
on my box where's on my boxes.

1746
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:14,180
And they said he barely trend for the,

1747
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:18,690
but that's the blocks in next week's like,
I mean it's like James,

1748
01:40:18,691 --> 01:40:23,670
Tony come in your welding. No, it's
not. It's fucking not out of shape.

1749
01:40:23,671 --> 01:40:27,240
Didn't respect the game. Yeah, just
kind of was doing it for the paycheck.

1750
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:29,910
It's like if Anthony Joshua gets,
you know,

1751
01:40:30,210 --> 01:40:34,080
if he's got an actual black
belt in Jujitsu we don't
know about and then decide

1752
01:40:34,081 --> 01:40:37,740
to fight MMA. But he's all
right. And Steve, but he's
already Anthony. Joshua. Yes.

1753
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:39,650
Yeah. That's really what it's
about. That's what it's like.

1754
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:41,840
It's like how's he going to deal with
kicks? I was going to deal with that.

1755
01:40:41,850 --> 01:40:44,520
That's where it's a lot.
There's some x factors like I don't know,

1756
01:40:44,521 --> 01:40:47,070
but I know he does these two things
very damn way and he's super good at

1757
01:40:47,071 --> 01:40:48,940
knocking people dead. Yes. Yeah.

1758
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:51,180
I think that's one of the things
that guy does like that's,

1759
01:40:51,181 --> 01:40:54,700
that's a real threat he's at in his prime.
He's 28 years old.

1760
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:58,330
It's a real threat and you know
[inaudible] he's going to do it. Yeah.

1761
01:40:58,470 --> 01:41:02,290
Like the comes is he 100% believes
he's going to win this fight,

1762
01:41:02,291 --> 01:41:05,430
which is when you got a guy like that
and he has momentum on his side and you

1763
01:41:05,431 --> 01:41:09,400
get the fucking nation of Ireland
behind your God and man at some game of

1764
01:41:09,401 --> 01:41:10,390
Thrones special shit.

1765
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:15,640
And also Floyd legitimately is almost
41 like I think he might be 41 at the

1766
01:41:15,641 --> 01:41:16,420
fight.

1767
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:20,470
Like I think like his birthday happens
between like what's his birthday like he

1768
01:41:20,471 --> 01:41:25,190
might be 41 now and he's in training camp.
He turned 41 that find out what it is.

1769
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:29,140
That's true. Release on Instagram though.
I was like, he does not look 41 yeah,

1770
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:33,840
he's great. February. Okay. So
he's real close, whatever it is.

1771
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:38,110
So when he gets to be whatever the age is,

1772
01:41:38,111 --> 01:41:42,340
when the wheels fall off it,
that's the thing.

1773
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:45,910
Who knows what happens if he gets dinged,
I think he will be slower.

1774
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:49,870
And because if it's Floyd in its heyday,
yeah, Kinda didn't stand a chance.

1775
01:41:49,871 --> 01:41:54,790
But Floyd notch slower man.
Well you remember my Donna,

1776
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:58,380
you know Donna came in fucking
winging bombs at Floyd. Yeah.

1777
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,220
And the first fight Floyd kind of,

1778
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:04,690
I think maybe there were underestimated
him or didn't understand like the like

1779
01:42:04,691 --> 01:42:07,900
the style that he was going
to present and he got clipped,

1780
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:11,080
he got clipped with one punch at the
end of one of the rounds where his legs

1781
01:42:11,081 --> 01:42:15,070
wobbled and I was like, whoa. And then re
matter of Floyd did the rematch, cad it,

1782
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:19,660
pick them apart. What's, he downloaded
it but oh yeah, I see. Matt just made it,

1783
01:42:19,661 --> 01:42:22,510
didn't take him serious.
It's possible or it's possible.

1784
01:42:22,511 --> 01:42:26,380
My Dawna fought really well and the first
fight and didn't fight so well in the

1785
01:42:26,381 --> 01:42:30,180
second fight for various reasons. Yeah.
But the only thing with that is Connor,

1786
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:32,410
so much different than May Donna.

1787
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:38,020
It's way more skillful and he's also,
he's very capable of doing weird shit.

1788
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:43,270
Like at a distance. His ability to move
in and out is very crisp. You know,

1789
01:42:43,271 --> 01:42:45,160
it's like you have to,
you have to respect it.

1790
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:50,490
Like what he did to f two Josie Aldo slid
back and drop that left hand in silly.

1791
01:42:50,590 --> 01:42:55,480
That's not something a lot of people
are capable of doing under fire. No, no.

1792
01:42:55,481 --> 01:42:58,740
Especially the what? The stakes and
your margin of error and the mixed,

1793
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:02,260
my shot just so much smaller
than boxing. It's just, you know,

1794
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:06,190
it's his timing that makes him special
in his time and we'll be better than

1795
01:43:06,191 --> 01:43:07,810
Floyd's.
Floyd's can be a little slower.

1796
01:43:07,811 --> 01:43:10,870
I just think cottage timing with
the speed and power. That's why,

1797
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:11,920
that's why I give them a shot.

1798
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:17,070
If Floyd sleeps on him at all and
Connor comes in and does something very

1799
01:43:17,351 --> 01:43:20,110
unusual and catches flow
with a big punch early,

1800
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:25,150
it could be chaos with eight ounce calls.
How about Floyd? You're crazy, man. Well,

1801
01:43:25,151 --> 01:43:28,390
here's the thing.
MMA fighters fight with four ounce gloves.

1802
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:33,810
So like why is boxing decided that eight
ounces are what's safe for everybody?

1803
01:43:34,511 --> 01:43:36,940
135 pounds and up 10 ounces,

1804
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:40,090
eight ounces would say for
anybody 135 pounds down.

1805
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:43,240
So that's like only a few weight classes.
It's not shipped.

1806
01:43:43,241 --> 01:43:46,630
But also those boxing gloves, man,
10 ounces when he got the wrap on.

1807
01:43:46,631 --> 01:43:48,850
I mean if you have clubs under hands,
man,

1808
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:52,100
literally clubs just protect me
from breaking it. That's 10 ounces.

1809
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,560
Yeah. Interesting. It makes
us so interesting. Yeah.

1810
01:43:57,561 --> 01:44:00,830
It becomes like an MMA fight
more [inaudible]. It's not,

1811
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,630
it's going to be real weird.

1812
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:05,640
It's got to be real weird until
we see what happens when you know,

1813
01:44:05,670 --> 01:44:07,450
we might see Floyd pick them apart.
Yeah.

1814
01:44:07,730 --> 01:44:11,060
And that the how the odds are that's going
to happen by just, I don't see it man.

1815
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:14,870
If he really does start fighting like
this though. Ooh, that would be weird.

1816
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:19,430
If Connor starts doing this, doing
that, you're going to see it.

1817
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:22,160
It's going to be those,
those first four rounds people,

1818
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:25,790
hopefully whoever you're watching with,
there's just silence.

1819
01:44:25,791 --> 01:44:27,770
Just what in the fuck
are we seeing right now?

1820
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:30,920
What Floyd is also a counter
striker and so it was Connor,

1821
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:35,570
but if Connor starts doing some weird
karate shit and get some on its heels,

1822
01:44:35,740 --> 01:44:40,520
gets some moving back and it's somehow
or another can get them into some weird

1823
01:44:40,521 --> 01:44:44,630
position where he can move faster than
Floyd understands or he could close the

1824
01:44:44,631 --> 01:44:48,570
distance quicker than Floyd expects. I
listen, I ask Polly, I go to poly. I know,

1825
01:44:48,590 --> 01:44:50,900
I know you guys hate each other,
all that, but when you're sparring,

1826
01:44:50,901 --> 01:44:54,830
would there things that were landing
because he did some things that were

1827
01:44:54,831 --> 01:44:58,760
unexpected and definitely landed. I'm
like, man, that's the thing with Connors.

1828
01:44:59,270 --> 01:45:03,470
If he's gonna, if he has that in his bag,
his bag of tricks, when he throws it,

1829
01:45:03,471 --> 01:45:08,120
it has to count because as soon as you
throw it Floyds and go, got it downloaded,

1830
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:12,770
downloaded, how many do you
have? Four. Five over 12 rounds.

1831
01:45:12,771 --> 01:45:16,640
You better make them fucking count,
man. Yeah. It's like yet five bullets.

1832
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:21,470
You better, you better hit the
target man. Yeah, it's true. Right?

1833
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:24,170
Right.
And here's the other thing.

1834
01:45:24,590 --> 01:45:29,270
How Brittle or Floyd's hands really
pretty brittle, broken them a few times,

1835
01:45:29,271 --> 01:45:32,950
right? But it was a huge factor from if
you've ever seen, uh, like his training,

1836
01:45:32,970 --> 01:45:33,530
stuff like that.

1837
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:38,420
After every session is hands on pure ice
and they had some [inaudible] at night

1838
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:41,360
massage his hand. So it's obviously
a factor, right? Let's say that was,

1839
01:45:41,361 --> 01:45:44,450
was that before his last fight?
If Roberto was,

1840
01:45:44,451 --> 01:45:47,690
what else been going on for quite
some time. I still get sore. Yeah.

1841
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:50,060
So think about this.
Eight ounce gloves.

1842
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:54,560
He hits Conor in that giant Irish
head that the has a forehead.

1843
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:58,490
Let's be real. It's good looking. Doobie
has a dome on him. He hits that hand,

1844
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:02,120
breaks his hand. Ooh, we go and Sizzler,

1845
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:06,380
certain factors I like to bank on that's,

1846
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:10,040
I'm recognizes that his hands
broken and he starts talking to him.

1847
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:14,480
But all you have is a jab and he starts
Shumlin put his hands behind his back.

1848
01:46:14,481 --> 01:46:17,270
Broke your fucking hand,
your fork to your book.

1849
01:46:17,271 --> 01:46:22,271
Your fucking hand didn't hit a little
core and get lit head to can you imagine?

1850
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:27,800
And then he just inoculates Floyd just
walked him down. That's an interesting,

1851
01:46:27,801 --> 01:46:32,750
like people were really mad at
him for calling Floyd boy. Oh Man.

1852
01:46:32,780 --> 01:46:36,960
He can call each other bitch motherfucker
don't say boy this song cause Oh,

1853
01:46:36,961 --> 01:46:41,840
do you know Joe? You? Yes. My boys were
boys with Andre Birthday. I was like,

1854
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:46,220
I kept saying homeboy don't, when he
left I was like Mass Jack. No racist.

1855
01:46:46,221 --> 01:46:50,160
Hashtag homeboys okay.
Yeah. Homeboys like,

1856
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:53,790
oh he's my homeboy. Hey homeboy,
you got to really figure this out.

1857
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:55,200
It's weird though cause it has boy in it.

1858
01:46:55,370 --> 01:47:00,190
Like you can't have any pause between
home and boy. Oh home boy. Yeah.

1859
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:03,380
He can't say that to a black guy.
No, it's too much boy. And it's too,

1860
01:47:04,410 --> 01:47:08,280
I gotta be careful man. Cause like with,
with Berto, he said something like,

1861
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:12,030
Oh that's my boy. It's hard to
say triggered around a black guy.

1862
01:47:12,810 --> 01:47:17,670
Trigger trigger. Trigger. Why?
Because it sounds like, yeah,

1863
01:47:17,850 --> 01:47:22,260
right. Yeah. You're like any word
that's close. I said tre, tre,

1864
01:47:22,410 --> 01:47:27,240
tre. I said tea bro.
[inaudible] rigor. Yeah.

1865
01:47:27,241 --> 01:47:29,100
Boy You just can't.
Yeah you can't.

1866
01:47:29,190 --> 01:47:33,450
You can't like did you see Cody Garbrandt
kept calling? Uh, sterling boy, boy,

1867
01:47:33,451 --> 01:47:37,560
two boys. A weird one. We just got to take
it out though. You like on social media.

1868
01:47:37,561 --> 01:47:42,450
Can't do that. But why not will
cause the, I mean, come on Joe.

1869
01:47:42,470 --> 01:47:44,400
It's weird but cool.
But here's the thing,

1870
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:46,680
if aljamain started
talking shit about Cody,

1871
01:47:46,681 --> 01:47:49,590
that boy can't touch me no problem at all.
I know.

1872
01:47:49,591 --> 01:47:52,800
See I don't have a problem with that.
Crazy. No one has a problem with it.

1873
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:55,620
Well but black people can
use the n word in boy. Right?

1874
01:47:55,621 --> 01:47:58,710
Cause they kinda that like they went
through some shit to earn that title.

1875
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:01,740
But boy, but he, boy, we used to be fine.

1876
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:04,770
It wasn't fine though.
Right?

1877
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:09,950
Boy was probably always used
like especially down south
as a derogatory term for

1878
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:15,120
young black men. Oh, the white people
would always, hey boy. Hey boy,

1879
01:48:15,121 --> 01:48:19,920
over here. All those fucking Home Depot
candle carrying douchebags fucked up. Boy.

1880
01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:23,550
It's a fun word to great words. Those are
my boys now. I can't say that anymore.

1881
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:27,210
Definitely say that I have a nine.
The token black guy, those are my,

1882
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:32,810
those are my men. Hang out with white
people just for that reason. All lights,

1883
01:48:33,610 --> 01:48:37,500
all whites. I get Charlottesville.
Fucking, yeah, but Ian Edwards,

1884
01:48:37,501 --> 01:48:42,060
I can ever say Ian's my boy. Nope. That's
not the window. No, but with, with Cody,

1885
01:48:42,061 --> 01:48:46,700
I don't think Cody's racist. He was like,
wait, I boy keep fighting. Like again,

1886
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:47,880
you got to know the connotation.

1887
01:48:47,881 --> 01:48:50,340
You've got to know you're
talking to a black guy,

1888
01:48:50,341 --> 01:48:54,330
so just don't use it like just
a minute. Youth Bro. Right?

1889
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:58,770
Like if you say that craze, why
you guys own bro? You we, we did,

1890
01:48:58,771 --> 01:49:03,660
but it used to be a black guy thing. No,
no. Sub Brow. Nope. Black guys own Bra.

1891
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:06,120
No, no, no. That's new, Bro.

1892
01:49:06,121 --> 01:49:10,510
Was like the 70s back when
they had platform shoes on
and fucking bell bottoms.

1893
01:49:10,630 --> 01:49:14,430
Now see, I feel like Becca said brother,
they had brother and bro. What up Bro?

1894
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:18,760
It really Ross like surfer like that.
Yeah,

1895
01:49:18,810 --> 01:49:23,070
but no, it's like Hawaiian. Your br eight.

1896
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:27,960
I'm talking B u h Bruh, Bruh.
Ay Bro. Hold up bro. Yeah,

1897
01:49:27,961 --> 01:49:31,740
that's like from ice tea. I think
he probably invented that. Correct.

1898
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:37,190
So then they own it. Or should I say ice
cube? Which one? Ice Cube or ice teas.

1899
01:49:37,210 --> 01:49:41,190
A little older. You know what I'm saying
though? Like there's different bro. Man.

1900
01:49:41,191 --> 01:49:43,130
White people fucked up bro though.

1901
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:48,160
Races became like a guys who were
like loafers go to private schools

1902
01:49:49,690 --> 01:49:54,160
at Bro. Yeah, maybe like
the Frat Boys Bros. Yeah,

1903
01:49:54,161 --> 01:49:55,940
like guys try a little too hard but not,
yeah,

1904
01:49:55,941 --> 01:49:58,030
now it's a bad connotation
because he'd go, oh my God,

1905
01:49:58,031 --> 01:50:01,330
it's such a bro is over there.
I'm like the crazy bros.

1906
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:05,740
Like as soon as someone goes, oh, they're
such bros, like, oh, I get it bro.

1907
01:50:05,741 --> 01:50:10,060
Science all the time with Joe
Rogan's using bro Science.
Vegans love to say that,

1908
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:13,210
bro. Science. We know
exactly what boroughs.

1909
01:50:15,130 --> 01:50:16,870
It's a funny thing,
but it's,

1910
01:50:16,930 --> 01:50:20,980
it's anti male and a lot of
ways and it's really rude.

1911
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:22,533
They,

1912
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:27,720
they get upset if you mock anyone that's
transgender or anyone that's w a woman

1913
01:50:29,051 --> 01:50:33,850
or anyone that's gay,
but they have no problem calling us bros.

1914
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:34,400
Yeah,

1915
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:39,130
we've got no problem shitting on the
very essence of being a man is throw him

1916
01:50:39,131 --> 01:50:42,700
out, Bryan out Bryan and now
I'm embarrassed to say it then.

1917
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:46,450
It's toxic masculinity, man. It's toxic.

1918
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:48,280
I mean if I post a picture
of his podcasts and went,

1919
01:50:48,281 --> 01:50:52,170
me and my Bros were getting roasted and
getting roasted the borough squad, Bro.

1920
01:50:52,171 --> 01:50:53,740
It it out.
Didn't used to be that way.

1921
01:50:53,741 --> 01:50:58,150
It's become that way over the last few
years when so many douchebags use bro.

1922
01:50:58,270 --> 01:51:00,100
We did it to ourselves.
We did to ourselves.

1923
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:03,070
A lot of tools did it cause they took
it over and used it here it's not.

1924
01:51:03,071 --> 01:51:05,580
We were being generous and including
ourselves and the rest of the men who

1925
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:08,440
fucked it out real. We didn't fuck
it up. I feel like we made it cool,

1926
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:12,880
but we use brother now. That's my
brother. Yeah, brother to other can work.

1927
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:17,830
Brother's like, you can't just do the
term brother around a guy barely know.

1928
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:19,690
Tonight I will be like,
oh, what's up brother?

1929
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:23,230
You can't do the tricky unless you're
hulk Hogan unless you like so friendly.

1930
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:26,650
You want everybody to be your brother
like Ooh, okay. It could be that guy, man.

1931
01:51:26,651 --> 01:51:28,420
I don't trust that he's his
brother just with anyone.

1932
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:34,510
Can I throw it around a lot? If I'm
high from high and I meet strangers,

1933
01:51:34,530 --> 01:51:38,280
so rather you don't have to
meet and greets. I say, Bro,
what's up brother? Yeah,

1934
01:51:38,281 --> 01:51:41,110
I see. That's different, right? He
experienced something with them.

1935
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:45,820
They saw your show. I know a little bit
different brothers and the way in a way,

1936
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,530
hey man, what do you think about
this? Tony Ferguson. Kevin Leafy.

1937
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:52,970
That's a good God damn fine. I love that
fight. Kevin Lee is a bad motherfucker.

1938
01:51:53,370 --> 01:51:57,330
We took Michael Kia says back and
strangled him like he choked him. Yes,

1939
01:51:57,590 --> 01:52:01,150
I was upset.
Maybe maybe he would've survived,

1940
01:52:01,151 --> 01:52:04,150
but the bottom line is that shit was
locked up and it should've never gotten

1941
01:52:04,151 --> 01:52:04,690
locked up.

1942
01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:07,540
Well where I come from when you go like
this and you and then your body goes

1943
01:52:07,541 --> 01:52:09,600
limp and your bath to go out.
While he was saying,

1944
01:52:09,601 --> 01:52:12,580
and he was just concentrating on his
neck just flexing his that yeah, me too.

1945
01:52:12,581 --> 01:52:15,310
I was pretend I was asleep when they'll
get a punch me in the face. But no,

1946
01:52:15,311 --> 01:52:15,761
for real.

1947
01:52:15,761 --> 01:52:20,761
Like if a guy's really good at getting
choked and he can figure out how to kind

1948
01:52:21,621 --> 01:52:25,840
of Tuck his chin and flexes and the neck
and just ride out the choke and if he

1949
01:52:25,841 --> 01:52:28,780
thinks he's got enough air
or naked and Kevin Lee,

1950
01:52:29,610 --> 01:52:33,630
Kevin Lee is a straight up strangler,
like that's a strong fucking dude neck.

1951
01:52:33,730 --> 01:52:36,190
100% I know. I know. Black
belts, man, you get there,

1952
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:40,240
you get there and the cheese is, is a
black belt young. He's a high level.

1953
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:43,450
That's not a black boy. He's not
ranked, but he's essentially grappler.

1954
01:52:43,570 --> 01:52:46,090
I believe he has black belt
level in the UFC. Yeah,

1955
01:52:46,090 --> 01:52:50,030
that's it. He's a black belt
level grappling. The UFC,
that's fair to say. Oh yeah.

1956
01:52:50,031 --> 01:52:53,570
I definitely think it's a black belt
level. I know it's high level competition,

1957
01:52:53,571 --> 01:52:54,141
black belts,

1958
01:52:54,141 --> 01:52:57,590
where if a blue belt gets on your back
and they have a full sunken and rear

1959
01:52:57,591 --> 01:52:59,840
naked choke, there's not much you're
going to do. You can hand fight.

1960
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:03,700
But if you had to actually in your fuck,
especially a strong athletic guy,

1961
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:07,980
Kevin Rooney, I get Kevin Leon this
and I love Michael. He's a beast.

1962
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:11,510
I like all his fights.
I just feel like Kevin Leman,

1963
01:53:11,790 --> 01:53:15,680
I think that the division needs him to,
he dresses well speaks well.

1964
01:53:15,681 --> 01:53:17,300
He's exciting to watch,
you know,

1965
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:22,390
100% he's just that the mistake that
Mario made and stopping that fight before

1966
01:53:22,671 --> 01:53:27,570
an absolute conclusion is a big mistake.
Oh, Mario fucked up. That's just a joke.

1967
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:30,980
It's a choke. You gotta let
when you have to let us know,

1968
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:32,730
we have to have this argument
and then Kevin least like, Nah,

1969
01:53:32,790 --> 01:53:37,050
just choking him out cheap.
James is arguing. It wasn't
like you fucked up Mario.

1970
01:53:37,051 --> 01:53:41,390
Okay. Damn it. Because if Cassa
just did go out unconscious,

1971
01:53:41,391 --> 01:53:42,560
then we've got no debate.

1972
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:47,210
And then Kevin Lee has this amazing
clean win and there's no bullshit to me

1973
01:53:47,211 --> 01:53:50,330
though. It was amazing clean wound and we
just moved on and went Mario fucked up.

1974
01:53:50,331 --> 01:53:52,370
But he was going out anyways.
What's an accept that?

1975
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,320
Accept it because they went from
fighting and stony first. No they did.

1976
01:53:56,321 --> 01:54:00,630
And she has a, you're on the undercard.
It's a good move too because Tony and um,

1977
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:04,280
Kevin Lee were John back and forth to
each other, you know, that's a good fight.

1978
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:08,510
Very good fight. Kevin. He's a beast
and he's a young guy and he's one,

1979
01:54:09,530 --> 01:54:12,790
he's one of those guys that like you
see from his first fight in the UFC,

1980
01:54:12,791 --> 01:54:17,120
see this giant leaps every here.
So yeah, it was a big leap.

1981
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:20,230
Calcify thought was going to give him a
lot of problems when he took him down,

1982
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:24,140
got his back. I was like, Jesus Christ,
man and castle and the left hand on him.

1983
01:54:24,141 --> 01:54:26,330
But when I watch it over in the replay,
you know,

1984
01:54:26,331 --> 01:54:27,830
sometimes when you've
seen it live to your,

1985
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:30,370
I'm looking through the
fence and look at it happen.

1986
01:54:30,450 --> 01:54:33,080
It's hard to tell what lands it
doesn't land. He moved away from it,

1987
01:54:33,081 --> 01:54:36,360
mostly caught on the end of it,
moved away from it and then you know,

1988
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:39,320
once they got to the ground
it was crazy that he took yes,

1989
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:42,260
his back and he dominated the position.
Super dominant.

1990
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:45,560
The other thing is I find interesting
is Kevin Lee, one day he wants to fight,

1991
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:49,340
compete after we fight for the past
three fights like I want to be in Russia.

1992
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:53,540
It's like taking an asteroid superstar,
chill sun. Well that's the way to do it,

1993
01:54:53,541 --> 01:54:57,280
man. You know, asked to fight the scariest
fucking guy in the game, you know.

1994
01:54:57,290 --> 01:55:01,610
But the thing about Khabib is I don't
know where his body's out when they're

1995
01:55:01,611 --> 01:55:04,790
saying his liver shutdown when
he was supposed to be fighting.

1996
01:55:04,791 --> 01:55:07,040
Tony talks about a different
game. Yeah. What does that mean?

1997
01:55:07,041 --> 01:55:12,041
Like so much weight and his body literally
was shutting down if I'll fucking

1998
01:55:12,141 --> 01:55:15,170
Russian goes to the
hospital before a fight.

1999
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:18,410
We got some serious problems,
serious problems.

2000
01:55:18,411 --> 01:55:20,450
He didn't cut weight right
and cut too much too soon.

2001
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:25,370
And it's not even that they cancel the
five round fight for the interim title

2002
01:55:25,371 --> 01:55:28,960
and have a three round fight for a catch
weight. They don't even do that though.

2003
01:55:29,010 --> 01:55:32,300
You can't fight. The commissioner was
like, Nah Man, it's liver shutting down.

2004
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:35,780
This is why when people are like, oh,
we got, could be Bruce Connor next.

2005
01:55:35,810 --> 01:55:39,770
Let's just talk about that. Logistically.
You've got a guy who can't make weight,

2006
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:44,280
almost died making the way you can go
on a world tour against the biggest name

2007
01:55:44,281 --> 01:55:46,170
ever and mixed martial
arts and Conor McGregor.

2008
01:55:46,630 --> 01:55:49,800
That's going to be your fight and you
think college is going to commit to that.

2009
01:55:50,490 --> 01:55:53,130
How could he do that? Why would he,
why would you do that? Not only that,

2010
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:56,250
Michael Johnson fight with Khabib
apparently at the same issue,

2011
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:58,230
but he got through it
like they're saying this,

2012
01:55:58,260 --> 01:56:00,130
the same thing that happened
in the Michael Johnson fight.

2013
01:56:00,131 --> 01:56:03,900
So this means like as every wait cut
you do, especially as you get older,

2014
01:56:03,930 --> 01:56:08,250
apparently your body resists like a
sponge. He gets bigger and bigger.

2015
01:56:08,251 --> 01:56:09,180
It gets harder and harder.

2016
01:56:09,210 --> 01:56:13,680
You body does not want to do it every
time you get fat as fuck in between fights

2017
01:56:13,700 --> 01:56:15,240
too.
You know it was hilarious.

2018
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:20,250
Cotsen Ghana was talking about chicks
like gaining weight in between fights

2019
01:56:20,430 --> 01:56:22,980
about you cut all that weight for file,
fuck your body up.

2020
01:56:22,981 --> 01:56:26,280
Like for a woman getting that
low in weight and body fat,

2021
01:56:26,281 --> 01:56:30,210
it's probably even more fucked. The
thyroids are fucked. Like, ah, my brother,

2022
01:56:30,510 --> 01:56:32,400
my sister in law,
my brother's wife,

2023
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,900
she did calm petitioners cut
weight and her thyroid light,

2024
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:37,920
it just fucks their bodies up.
Oh.

2025
01:56:37,921 --> 01:56:41,370
When they're doing a
bodybuilding competition with
of all that water weight and

2026
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:42,570
height for the girls,

2027
01:56:42,571 --> 01:56:46,140
like you know some of these girls you'll
see in the EOC like the day of the

2028
01:56:46,141 --> 01:56:50,820
fight, like God, that's a supermodel. You
see her three weeks say like, God damn,

2029
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:53,790
it looked like a Dell right now that like,
how did,

2030
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:58,770
like they just blow up like it's literally
like their bodies while the body just

2031
01:56:58,771 --> 01:57:02,900
probably really resist that weight cut.
It's just not, it doesn't want to do it.

2032
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:07,320
Like, probably your body goes into famine
mode. You know, he starts thinking,

2033
01:57:07,321 --> 01:57:10,560
we've got to retain some water on this
bit that's looking for that cyborg fight.

2034
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:14,640
Cyborg is trying to fight Holly and Matt
Square Guard and that's a big fight.

2035
01:57:14,980 --> 01:57:18,930
That's a duck cyborg two days ago. And
she's like, man, Holly mascular gun.

2036
01:57:19,050 --> 01:57:22,230
That's what I want. Well that's a
try yet where there's some money.

2037
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,021
You know what I mean?

2038
01:57:23,021 --> 01:57:26,960
The Holly is coming off the DRN
Germane to Rhonda may fight with Joe.

2039
01:57:26,961 --> 01:57:31,660
She's still, she's coming off down to
amend the hock, the banks. I betcha.

2040
01:57:31,790 --> 01:57:33,930
Yeah, but, but what, but batch go, hey,

2041
01:57:33,931 --> 01:57:36,180
I was really not in their league
in my opinion. Not at all.

2042
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:39,690
Whereas your main Miranda may is she
cracked your main to randomly with that

2043
01:57:39,691 --> 01:57:42,060
high kick and then dropped her
with that straight left hand.

2044
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:46,440
Like Jermaine Duran to me is as legit
as Stryker as you're ever going to see

2045
01:57:46,730 --> 01:57:50,730
men's MMA. So she's not fighting
Cyborg. She's Holly to drop her.

2046
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:52,830
She just didn't want no part of that.

2047
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:55,530
Have you ever seen anything like
that ever in mixed martial arts?

2048
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:57,630
And I didn't try.
Damn,

2049
01:57:57,631 --> 01:58:02,631
I'm just went radio silent fucking six
months and they came back like she did

2050
01:58:03,301 --> 01:58:04,260
stuff like 10 years ago.

2051
01:58:04,261 --> 01:58:08,310
I'm gonna cut down a fucking one 35 when
I was talking to her post fight and I

2052
01:58:08,311 --> 01:58:09,570
said,
well what about Cyborg?

2053
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:12,160
You know I was asking her and doing the
post fight interview and she's like, man,

2054
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:15,750
I'm going to get some surgeries on
my fucking hand hurts right now.

2055
01:58:15,751 --> 01:58:18,020
Let's talk about this later.
Juncker question though. Right?

2056
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:21,990
You do have a hurt hand, which I
believe she probably absolutely did.

2057
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:25,230
Now's the time to do it.
Like, Hey I got this title.

2058
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:27,690
I definitely know when I have
one hand if you're fighting.

2059
01:58:27,691 --> 01:58:29,820
But she did it do anything right.
She was like Nah,

2060
01:58:29,821 --> 01:58:33,750
that was an excuse she might have. But
she vacated the title cause you're like,

2061
01:58:33,751 --> 01:58:37,260
no, I'm not going to do that.
Holly fighting against soon. Yeah,

2062
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:42,070
that class she fighting that she vacate
the belt was like Nah, we're good side.

2063
01:58:42,071 --> 01:58:42,904
We'd have fun up there.

2064
01:58:43,510 --> 01:58:47,380
Holly for Cyborgs and answering fight
cause I think stylistically Holly's the

2065
01:58:47,381 --> 01:58:51,640
perfect matchup to beat Cyborg. I don't
think she beats her, but style wise,

2066
01:58:51,670 --> 01:58:55,270
she's made to beat Cyborg. Thinking
about this, let's just go through,

2067
01:58:55,450 --> 01:58:59,200
think of Holly Beats Sideboard.
Whoa. She's aggressive. Make my shot.

2068
01:58:59,230 --> 01:59:03,490
Female mixed martial artist of all
time. Merck. Rhonda with a head kick.

2069
01:59:03,610 --> 01:59:05,680
So she beats the greatest.
Something's grades all the time.

2070
01:59:05,681 --> 01:59:09,670
Mercer goes on a little bit of a
tough run. Who gives a fuck then?

2071
01:59:09,671 --> 01:59:13,960
Beat sideboards. So beat Ron and Cyborg.
We're going sizzler. Yeah. And then me,

2072
01:59:13,961 --> 01:59:16,630
she'd take, comes back, get get you some.

2073
01:59:16,631 --> 01:59:20,560
She's whipping her ass for five rounds
and then just got choked out at the end.

2074
01:59:20,950 --> 01:59:24,660
But think about it and then you beat
Ronda who was undefeated at them.

2075
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:28,030
Then you beat Frickin sidebar.
If she beats cyborg and me,

2076
01:59:28,031 --> 01:59:30,580
she comes back and fight her again.
That's a giant fight.

2077
01:59:30,610 --> 01:59:33,060
It's a giant fight with me. She
wants to fight again. She wanted,

2078
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:36,990
but she would do it for that. Sitting
around Superfight that itch the tonight.

2079
01:59:36,991 --> 01:59:41,340
Katie Lang poured and poured a shit.
Itchy.

2080
01:59:41,410 --> 01:59:46,370
Fuck. We state still first team all
I'll qd up there. Oh yeah, yeah.

2081
01:59:46,420 --> 01:59:51,010
First team booty hit.
Hey, there was a recent,

2082
01:59:51,011 --> 01:59:55,080
those UFC titties, UFC to ties those.
Those are some period you'll see.

2083
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:59,980
But with the Holly, if
Holly can somehow, again,

2084
01:59:59,981 --> 02:00:02,450
I don't think she's going to, but you
never know. I didn't, you know who?

2085
02:00:02,451 --> 02:00:03,940
I didn't think she was
really going beat Rhonda.

2086
02:00:04,150 --> 02:00:07,600
But if she somehow can pull off
beat Cyborg and she beat Rhonda,

2087
02:00:08,170 --> 02:00:11,950
did they do we just give her like some
weird statute for the UFC gym now?

2088
02:00:11,951 --> 02:00:14,110
Like how's this work?
Either they'll net but you know,

2089
02:00:14,111 --> 02:00:17,680
don't you think that in their eyes
like there's always going to be,

2090
02:00:18,430 --> 02:00:19,930
even though she beat Rhonda,

2091
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:22,900
like Rhonda is the one that
put the thing on the map.

2092
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:26,230
She's always going to be revered more.
You asked. See, I don't think so.

2093
02:00:26,231 --> 02:00:30,820
I think she has such a crash landing
like the worst of all time and she's gone

2094
02:00:30,821 --> 02:00:34,120
radio silent that we don't
remember that that climb.

2095
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:37,690
Do you think people are upset and hurt?
Like you weren't really a fighter,

2096
02:00:37,870 --> 02:00:40,630
like you're only fighter for a little bit.
If you are really a fighter,

2097
02:00:40,631 --> 02:00:43,840
you'd still be there.
He'd be getting back into it.

2098
02:00:43,841 --> 02:00:48,580
You're still young people no matter what.
No matter what people,

2099
02:00:48,581 --> 02:00:51,790
where would that kind of shit matter
what they thought you were one thing and

2100
02:00:51,791 --> 02:00:55,300
you fail at it. You fucking loser. I know.

2101
02:00:55,330 --> 02:00:57,850
They get mad if you were
their hero for sure,

2102
02:00:57,851 --> 02:00:59,560
and you're not doing
what they want you to do.

2103
02:00:59,561 --> 02:01:02,110
Or you talked about
being a do nothing bitch,

2104
02:01:02,111 --> 02:01:05,200
and now you get knocked out and you're,
you're doing nothing. You know, it's like,

2105
02:01:05,201 --> 02:01:08,650
how dare you. I bought the shirt. She
was hosting battle of the network stars.

2106
02:01:10,430 --> 02:01:14,080
No, I don't. Dunno. I don't
know man. I don't know.

2107
02:01:14,870 --> 02:01:18,600
She's just not into it, you know? I mean,
I could see not wanting to find anymore.

2108
02:01:18,610 --> 02:01:21,490
Right. You didn't want to fight anymore
at a certain point in time. A little,

2109
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:23,350
little different though. You
know, she was a world like,

2110
02:01:23,351 --> 02:01:27,010
she accomplished a lot more
than me. Um, you know, I, I,

2111
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:31,840
I love my life now has never been better,
man. Like I love what I'm doing. I,

2112
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:34,690
you know, I don't know. She doesn't
have a thing like, no Mary, no.

2113
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:37,480
Maybe it was battle of the network stars.
I don't know if that's even true.

2114
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:41,030
Calling. I can't believe they talked
to him to doing that. I Dunno man.

2115
02:01:41,290 --> 02:01:42,980
You know and also made me,

2116
02:01:42,981 --> 02:01:46,400
she made so much money like maybe
she's good there too. I don't know.

2117
02:01:47,030 --> 02:01:49,940
But even if you make so much money,
it's not about the money is it?

2118
02:01:50,210 --> 02:01:52,980
Everybody thinks that that's going to
be enough to make you happy. It's not.

2119
02:01:53,060 --> 02:01:58,060
It'll definitely be you in a position
where you don't have to worry about bills.

2120
02:01:58,460 --> 02:02:01,940
Now. Maybe that's your number one problem
and then you're going to be happier.

2121
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:05,750
That's possible. Once you check that
off, the other prompts start to come up.

2122
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:08,300
All right, well now what am I going
to do? Like I don't have a passion.

2123
02:02:08,301 --> 02:02:12,020
What am I waking up for?
There was a study on income and they,

2124
02:02:12,050 --> 02:02:15,620
well one of the things they said was
when it comes to like overall happiness,

2125
02:02:15,650 --> 02:02:16,580
see if we could find this.

2126
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:20,810
I think they said everything
over $70,000 a year.

2127
02:02:20,811 --> 02:02:23,050
It's kind of a wash at 75,000 right

2128
02:02:24,740 --> 02:02:29,540
range and like going from, if you grew
up from a bike to a car and happiness,

2129
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:34,430
when you go from a car to just buy another
car and you have two cards, nothing,

2130
02:02:34,431 --> 02:02:37,260
nothing changes in your, that's
not true. I agree with Trump.

2131
02:02:37,310 --> 02:02:40,340
My corvette and I agree that the fuck
you talking about the perfect salary for

2132
02:02:40,341 --> 02:02:42,380
happiness,
a $75,000 a year.

2133
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:45,230
When did depend where you live and
what you like to do. Yeah. See,

2134
02:02:45,231 --> 02:02:49,340
I dunno about that. For like the
magic income, as people earn more,

2135
02:02:49,341 --> 02:02:53,990
their day to day happiness rises
until you hit $75,000 after that.

2136
02:02:54,050 --> 02:02:56,780
It's just more stuff
with no gain in happiness

2137
02:02:58,580 --> 02:03:01,580
that someone who's never
had a really cool record,

2138
02:03:02,450 --> 02:03:07,010
he never like had a deck that overlooks
the mountain. We real with your buddies,

2139
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:11,160
he never been able to go on these dope
ass vacation and had a stake in a day

2140
02:03:11,180 --> 02:03:14,840
traveling to Japan, get some Sushi
fresh out of the fucking ocean rise,

2141
02:03:14,841 --> 02:03:19,580
some master chef, that private jet, you
can have some ball times. Hell yeah. Yeah.

2142
02:03:20,030 --> 02:03:24,230
Maybe you get a fucking yacht,
your rent it and go through the Caribbean.

2143
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:26,390
Come on,
you do whatever you want to get kids.

2144
02:03:26,391 --> 02:03:28,820
He'd take it on vacation wherever you
want. You don't worry about that stuff.

2145
02:03:28,821 --> 02:03:30,650
The fuck out of here.
You trying to say Shit,

2146
02:03:30,651 --> 02:03:34,120
Dr Phil be just as happy if
you made 75 miles an hour.

2147
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:39,860
It just depends man. Bitch.
Like when you study bro. Yeah.

2148
02:03:39,861 --> 02:03:43,280
You think Elon Musk be super pumped
to go down to about 75,000 a year?

2149
02:03:43,281 --> 02:03:46,070
I think Oprah has fucking get away cars.
We can save 5,000 year.

2150
02:03:46,130 --> 02:03:49,490
Do you think you would get
that top shelf actress pussy.

2151
02:03:49,491 --> 02:03:53,810
If he was making 75 million
a year or 75,000 a year,

2152
02:03:54,050 --> 02:03:56,540
he gets a million a year.
He would be like, damn,

2153
02:03:56,541 --> 02:03:59,990
I'm struggling [inaudible] 75
mil cut back on my security.

2154
02:04:02,530 --> 02:04:06,140
They were detailing all the different
shit that Johnny Depp's spends money on

2155
02:04:06,350 --> 02:04:11,090
too and it's just like this stuff.
What in the holy fuck he is.

2156
02:04:11,210 --> 02:04:14,540
I don't know what he does in
terms of his substance of choice.

2157
02:04:14,541 --> 02:04:19,541
That would what he enjoys the
appears to be on a financial rampage.

2158
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:22,870
Then they have to like take out a loan
from his agent or some shit like that.

2159
02:04:22,871 --> 02:04:26,840
He owns Johnny Depp owns like
40 houses or something crazy,

2160
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:28,940
something close houses all over the world.

2161
02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:32,720
They said it's security is like stupid,
like $275,000 a month.

2162
02:04:34,030 --> 02:04:38,310
Like bro, Bro, you just need one
guy who was trying to kill you.

2163
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:42,840
He's an animal man. You're
fucking captain. Jack Sparrow
knows trying to kill you.

2164
02:04:42,930 --> 02:04:47,930
He's a fucking animal and he's got some
sort of a a million a month spending.

2165
02:04:48,930 --> 02:04:53,100
Well, you know, can I
spend money bro? Oh my God.

2166
02:04:53,310 --> 02:04:56,340
Johnny Depp's x business managers

2167
02:04:56,341 --> 02:05:01,080
Happy of 2 million a month.
You get chose Johnny Depp.

2168
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:04,830
You go get yours, dude.
How does that happen?

2169
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:09,180
How does knowing go show you kinda chill
out on the 2 million a month he spent

2170
02:05:09,181 --> 02:05:13,000
$3 million to fulfill friend hunter s
Thompson's dream of having his ass shot

2171
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:17,550
out of a cannon.
But that 1,000,045 luxury cars,

2172
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:21,180
$10 million a year to support his
entourage, friends and family,

2173
02:05:21,181 --> 02:05:26,181
and $30,000 a month alone
on why he's awesome Buhler.

2174
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:35,100
He's lived a great life though.
A matching those months.

2175
02:05:35,101 --> 02:05:39,570
2,000,045 luxury cars.
10 is osh.

2176
02:05:39,571 --> 02:05:43,590
Raj is having a grand old time
personal lawyer, Jake bloom.

2177
02:05:44,070 --> 02:05:46,890
Dep was living beyond his
means and urgent earn.

2178
02:05:46,980 --> 02:05:51,980
Urged him to spend less and sell certain
expensive but unnecessary assets to

2179
02:05:52,681 --> 02:05:55,770
repay loans and pay his
taxes and living expenses.

2180
02:05:56,100 --> 02:06:00,900
He's just out of 14 houses. Listen,
that's cocaine living right there.

2181
02:06:00,901 --> 02:06:05,190
At least in [inaudible] 14
residences acquire, improve,

2182
02:06:05,191 --> 02:06:08,700
and furnish.
14 residences.

2183
02:06:08,730 --> 02:06:10,200
I'm trying to see that car collection.

2184
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:13,920
1414 residences,

2185
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:18,840
45 luxury cars. Good Lord. How much
money did he make in his career?

2186
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:23,910
I owe 650,000 fit million. Sorry, Jesus.
650 million. That's a lot of money,

2187
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:29,210
but 2 million a year in the past 30 years
earned him an estimated $650 million.

2188
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:33,390
Being a rich movie star over does not
necessarily bring great financial savvy

2189
02:06:34,050 --> 02:06:34,980
over the past decade.

2190
02:06:35,450 --> 02:06:40,140
Mr. Debt paid more than 65.6 million
in interest on overdue taxes,

2191
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:45,050
has lent millions of dollars to people
unlike you to pay him back and has shit

2192
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:48,420
and widely splurge. Just,
I love that word. Splurge.

2193
02:06:48,421 --> 02:06:51,060
Just a number of questionable investments,

2194
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:55,590
not the least of which is
that town near central pay.

2195
02:06:55,591 --> 02:06:58,440
He bought a town.
My man just said,

2196
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:02,970
we're balling the town called my
manager telling me buying a town.

2197
02:07:03,090 --> 02:07:05,400
The assistant calls the manager
John Johnny's buying the town.

2198
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:08,820
He doesn't talk to the man. He was
like not so which house do you like?

2199
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:12,570
I liked them all. I'll take the time
at home. I'll take all have homes. Oh,

2200
02:07:12,610 --> 02:07:15,420
crazy as that.
But he owns a street in Hollywood.

2201
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:17,490
I was like a bunch of
like Stan hopes his boy.

2202
02:07:18,230 --> 02:07:22,080
I say that because they're both white
and Stanhope cost to go up the street and

2203
02:07:22,081 --> 02:07:24,750
there's a dude with an earpiece waiting
for him and the dude with the earpiece

2204
02:07:24,751 --> 02:07:27,350
takes from a golf cart and drives them
up to the top of the hill and they own

2205
02:07:27,351 --> 02:07:28,710
like the whole fucking block.

2206
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:32,580
But there's one dude on the block that
apparently won't sell type move to that

2207
02:07:32,581 --> 02:07:35,860
guy. That guy's like, Nah,
fuck it. I like this house

2208
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:40,060
forever.
Fuck off type move all coked up.

2209
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:41,620
What's a buy it and improve accuracy.

2210
02:07:41,790 --> 02:07:44,550
It's just make the whole thing just
you're going to sail the seven seas and it

2211
02:07:44,551 --> 02:07:47,320
turn it black. The whole room
black. The whole house. I heard,

2212
02:07:47,350 --> 02:07:49,750
I heard Nicholas cage
is even crazier spin.

2213
02:07:49,780 --> 02:07:52,450
He buys castles and like Ma
Knight's equipment and chill.

2214
02:07:52,990 --> 02:07:55,900
It's good move him and Leonardo Dicaprio.

2215
02:07:55,901 --> 02:07:59,470
I think we're bidding on some skull
and he had to return it because it was

2216
02:07:59,471 --> 02:08:03,610
stolen or I'm like to him, I
forget where I look. That's bald.

2217
02:08:03,730 --> 02:08:07,980
When he bought a skull from King Tut's
fucking in the header return in the

2218
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:10,840
museums or art,
that's our shit.

2219
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:14,530
Leonardo Dicaprio had returned a bunch
of art that was given to him by a guy who

2220
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:16,260
apparently was stolen.

2221
02:08:16,270 --> 02:08:20,680
All he agrees to return stolen
dinosaur skull to Mongolia.

2222
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:28,450
Oh, that makes me feel good.
Using stupid purchases.

2223
02:08:28,451 --> 02:08:32,980
Skull of a tyranosaurs. What does it,
what does that word? Tyron source.

2224
02:08:32,981 --> 02:08:36,970
But Tara, what is that? What's
a tyrannosaurus but tar?
Do you know what that is?

2225
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:40,360
Have you ever heard that
before? No. How weird, Bro.

2226
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:44,260
How much did those go for dude?
We were talking about, Whoa,

2227
02:08:44,290 --> 02:08:47,980
that's a dope looking animal. He
bought the Horace. Horace. Wow.

2228
02:08:47,981 --> 02:08:50,590
That must be massive.
So someone stole it,

2229
02:08:51,850 --> 02:08:55,810
someone stole it and he bought it and he
had to return at the black market. Wow,

2230
02:08:55,811 --> 02:09:00,040
that's crazy. Where do you put that in
your house? Where do you put it? Okay,

2231
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:03,430
so here's my thinking.
You have to have a real skull.

2232
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:06,220
Like if you want to buy some replica,
like a child's toy,

2233
02:09:06,221 --> 02:09:08,710
you're a fucking asshole.
Have you have one of those things?

2234
02:09:08,711 --> 02:09:13,180
You know how like fuck you.
It's that real. How dear
you, that's what I'm saying.

2235
02:09:13,390 --> 02:09:15,910
Like if you go to a lot of museums,
a lot of the skulls,

2236
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:20,890
you're seeing a replica's damn
276,000 better deal. And I thought,

2237
02:09:20,950 --> 02:09:25,450
what? That's it, Joe, we need went for
the new studio Biden. I'm thinking,

2238
02:09:25,451 --> 02:09:27,070
let's make some bids on a t rex.

2239
02:09:28,150 --> 02:09:30,640
Let's just have like three
raptors at the new studio.

2240
02:09:30,820 --> 02:09:33,530
Do how much they ain't get about it.
How many,

2241
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:37,960
what's like the most common domus dinosaur
they get by? I bet something lame.

2242
02:09:38,270 --> 02:09:42,590
But you get like a stegosaurus or chimp
because they're fun. Him a little heads.

2243
02:09:42,630 --> 02:09:44,470
The other begins.
They're all small.

2244
02:09:45,070 --> 02:09:48,550
They have little head and you
want to try say tops. Damn.

2245
02:09:48,780 --> 02:09:51,420
They'll saber tooth ones are bullshit.
We ain't trying to have that. Yeah.

2246
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:55,960
Saber Tooth Tigers on dinosaur. Jamie.
That doesn't, that doesn't count.

2247
02:09:56,470 --> 02:10:01,090
Make sure they're real. Jamie
fives is got a son. Etsy.

02:10:02,890 --> 02:10:06,220
Hey, free shipping. Free Shipping.

2250
02:10:11,410 --> 02:10:12,243
What is the,

2251
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:17,400

2253
02:10:25,990 --> 02:10:29,770
Yeah, that does look pretty dope.
What is that thing? How big is it?

2254
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:33,780
78 inches long,
dude.

2255
02:10:35,010 --> 02:10:37,260
Fucking is that real?
That's real.

2256
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:40,250
They really have that for sale and
we get free shipping right now.

2257
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:41,850
That's the thing with
Nicholas Cage's things.

2258
02:10:41,851 --> 02:10:45,200
So it took like seven years for him to
get to the certificate of authenticity

2259
02:10:45,201 --> 02:10:45,981
and then when they got it,

2260
02:10:45,981 --> 02:10:49,280
that's it and they found out it
was stolen by some fake shit.

2261
02:10:49,281 --> 02:10:52,280
Not Know for a while they had a dope ass.
Well,

2262
02:10:52,290 --> 02:10:55,140
there's one you can get a t
rex room 1.8 million. Yeah.

2263
02:10:55,230 --> 02:10:59,480
I just can't imagine that for 55,000
bucks you should get her. You get a real,

2264
02:10:59,481 --> 02:11:03,500

was it? 250 50 55 free shipping.

2265
02:11:03,890 --> 02:11:06,440
Not about launching a t.
Rex is 1.5 million.

2266
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,690
If I was like some salt and type
character, I'd have all that.

2267
02:11:09,691 --> 02:11:13,180
I'll run my house like game
of Thrones or a t rex go, oh,

2268
02:11:13,190 --> 02:11:16,670
scroll up 1.8 million.
Wow worth it.

2269
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:21,980
If you're Warren Buffett, did those
go up and your worth 80 billion rides.

2270
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:25,070
Like when I have a bunch of that shit
in your house by the shit out of that,

2271
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:28,070
your wife would just slowly start
to realize you're going insane.

2272
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:31,820
Start constructing a dinosaur in the
middle of the living room and he all of a

2273
02:11:31,821 --> 02:11:34,950
sudden construction crews at the house
like, what's what's going on, honey? Oh,

2274
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:38,510
y'all raising the roof. I tried a new
t rats comedy. Rex. He's too tall.

2275
02:11:38,511 --> 02:11:39,840
We're going to have to
cut out the ceiling.

2276
02:11:40,290 --> 02:11:44,720
Every room I'm going to put
in glass ceiling out of stock,

2277
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:45,913
out of stock.

2278
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:48,620
That means somebody who bought it and
philosophy out there from Jurassic Park,

2279
02:11:48,830 --> 02:11:51,440
but I want to, I don't want to rubber
toy Janky. You know what I want to,

2280
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:55,460
I'll take that Predator thing though.
I will take that. What did the,

2281
02:11:55,490 --> 02:11:57,890
how about this head? Oh, I know
a dude who makes those man.

2282
02:11:58,010 --> 02:12:00,300
The guy who made the American
Werewolf Patrick Miguelito,

2283
02:12:00,770 --> 02:12:04,040
he met a Predator and he makes the
alien. Those can't be you. Ooh.

2284
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:05,940
Should we get that through?
Got a limo.

2285
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:12,830
It's trying to pull it up.
White diamond premium white diamond.

2286
02:12:12,860 --> 02:12:16,030
It'd be an asshole. The vibe fish for a
million and a half dollars. That depends.

2287
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:20,860
What's it? Is it alive? What's he do?
What is it? Is it a car? I'm seeing fish.

2288
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:23,180
The most exclusive breed in the world.

2289
02:12:23,181 --> 02:12:27,290
Premium white diamond fish are rare
than precious gem stone. Oh my God.

2290
02:12:27,291 --> 02:12:29,640
So it's one of those things. If you're an
asshole, you have it in your fish tank.

2291
02:12:30,570 --> 02:12:34,710
Let Jeanette is one point $5 million.
Just white fish.

2292
02:12:35,490 --> 02:12:38,630
I did. Yeah. Currently there's
only like a hundred of those.

2293
02:12:38,660 --> 02:12:42,680
If you have an all white moose at your
house, he's getting some panty dropper.

2294
02:12:42,710 --> 02:12:46,070
Here's the thing, man. Here's the real
thing. If you're on a hunting trip, okay,

2295
02:12:46,071 --> 02:12:49,970
that moves is a legal size Mousse and
a white move steps in front of you.

2296
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:54,110
Do you release that Arrow? They got to
shoot that light Mousse in a stupid face.

2297
02:12:54,710 --> 02:12:59,510
It's,
it's totally legal.

2298
02:12:59,870 --> 02:13:03,090
I don't like the way he
looks. So good size moves. Oh,

2299
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:05,720
we just couldn't sign his mood.
Just going to shoot the Black Moose now,

2300
02:13:06,470 --> 02:13:10,340
fuck a light moves around. Moves lives
matter. I don't discriminate white.

2301
02:13:11,370 --> 02:13:13,130
I've never shot. The thing is, man,

2302
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:16,340
here's the thing about animal rights
activists and people that are nutty about

2303
02:13:16,341 --> 02:13:20,540
animals, they get, what this is is
a genetic anomaly. It's not like a,

2304
02:13:20,541 --> 02:13:25,100
this is a specific breed. Right?
It's not out by no though.

2305
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:29,660
It's not an albino. Apparently it's just
got some weird genetic, uh, anomaly.

2306
02:13:29,690 --> 02:13:33,570
One of a hundred. Yeah. There's a
hundred of them. So what is it like,

2307
02:13:33,571 --> 02:13:35,490
see what it is. If it says,
scroll up a little bit,

2308
02:13:35,491 --> 02:13:38,970
I think it says what the genetic
mutation is. Yeah. See it's a,

2309
02:13:39,030 --> 02:13:42,690
for coloring is a genetic
mutation and it's not an albino,

2310
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:45,030
not an albino.
Unlike a,

2311
02:13:45,210 --> 02:13:49,860
like all white animals I heard that
tastes like vanilla. They taste good dude.

2312
02:13:50,570 --> 02:13:53,460
You, you know how to light one that you
never even see anyone that's it. Same.

2313
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:56,610
Same Shit. Same on the inside. It's
like white people. It's all the same.

2314
02:13:56,900 --> 02:14:01,320
Once you get look at that,
wow. It's crazy. Another, some,

2315
02:14:01,410 --> 02:14:04,560
some people have the string coloring
might be another sign of a shore to

2316
02:14:04,561 --> 02:14:08,670
becoming apocalypse. That damn. And
you see a hoard of White Mousse.

2317
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:12,510
Yeah. It was only a hundred of them
though. I wouldn't tell anybody.

2318
02:14:12,511 --> 02:14:15,810
I'll tell you one thing. If I did
kill that, I'd keep my mouth shut.

2319
02:14:17,370 --> 02:14:20,280
I wouldn't tell people they'd get
too mad even if it didn't matter.

2320
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:24,510
Like if you find a bear,
okay. Like there's um, a
black bear if you're hunting.

2321
02:14:24,511 --> 02:14:27,100
But first of all,
if you're hunting black bear,

2322
02:14:27,101 --> 02:14:28,890
people get mad at you
anyway cause killing a bear.

2323
02:14:29,070 --> 02:14:32,430
Cause then on round bears they think
the bears are extinct or this is a very

2324
02:14:32,431 --> 02:14:33,990
short loan beers
depending where you're at.

2325
02:14:34,770 --> 02:14:37,830
So many barriers that they're
all cannibals. They eat
each other. That's a fact.

2326
02:14:37,860 --> 02:14:42,150
Yeah. The cubs, the cubs like crazy,
including the females will eat their own.

2327
02:14:42,330 --> 02:14:45,150
Tam was saying he has to take out the
big older ones cause they'll fuck up all

2328
02:14:45,151 --> 02:14:45,930
the cup.
Yeah.

2329
02:14:45,930 --> 02:14:49,260
It's actually better for the population
to take out the big males because the

2330
02:14:49,261 --> 02:14:54,180
big males eat carbs like w when we
were there. Oh Wow. He's white deer.

2331
02:14:55,180 --> 02:14:57,940
Moose. I'm going to, those
are a little baby white moves.

2332
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:03,180
Pigs run off in my car.
They're cute as shit.

2333
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:07,530
Oh they're adorable. The twins are
likely less than a month old show.

2334
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:08,700
Cute cuties,

2335
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:12,480
little cuties that you'd get and there's
a mama big mama is going to achieve.

2336
02:15:12,481 --> 02:15:13,740
Will fuck with your world.

2337
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:17,040
They're different than any other
ungulates in that they're real aggressive.

2338
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:20,850
Like a moose will chase you down and
beat your fucking ass. Super Dangerous.

2339
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:24,810
A deer is not likely going to do that.
They've done it before. Ah, fuck it.

2340
02:15:24,811 --> 02:15:27,570
The elk might stab you really
with those horns you get,

2341
02:15:27,630 --> 02:15:31,470
you get a little cocky when he's Horny,
you talk blocking and elk. Oh yeah.

2342
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:34,680
That's when the crazy, that's rule
number one. They will fuck you up.

2343
02:15:34,681 --> 02:15:36,630
They have swords grown out
of their head. See, I'm,

2344
02:15:36,631 --> 02:15:39,000
I'm definitely doing a hunt like
that. Some dangerous where, hey,

2345
02:15:39,210 --> 02:15:42,380
like I got to watch my ps and qs
like we were hunting like baby fond.

2346
02:15:42,390 --> 02:15:46,110
I can't fuck with you guys. I told Cam,
this man has to be something dangerous.

2347
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:48,960
I'm down. Okay, well dear. I mean,

2348
02:15:48,961 --> 02:15:52,800
if they did want to fuck you up with
those things, they could stab you.

2349
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:58,320
But the thing is they're, they're prey.
I mean, this is what they are in nature.

2350
02:15:58,350 --> 02:15:59,910
They eat grass and they get preyed upon.

2351
02:16:00,090 --> 02:16:04,530
They are the food source of mountain
lions and Wolves and countless bears and

2352
02:16:04,531 --> 02:16:07,050
countless other animals.
I mean that's just what they are.

2353
02:16:07,170 --> 02:16:08,520
They're beautiful while they're alive.

2354
02:16:08,521 --> 02:16:12,390
It's not like you should
somehow or another, you know,
diminish their existence.

2355
02:16:12,391 --> 02:16:14,820
But that's a prey animal. That's
why they're here. That's why they,

2356
02:16:14,850 --> 02:16:19,220
I mean in the system that they're
in the ECO system. Yeah. Yeah.

2357
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:22,410
We didn't create it this their
and their Goddamn Trisha.

2358
02:16:22,420 --> 02:16:25,320
So I had some access deer for down
last night. I had access to it.

2359
02:16:25,321 --> 02:16:28,140
But when you posted was I get so hungry,
so good.

2360
02:16:28,590 --> 02:16:32,740
I've been to the girl up blatant.
That in my opinion is like the most,

2361
02:16:32,770 --> 02:16:36,790
if you can get to Hawaii [inaudible]
if you can get to Hawaii,

2362
02:16:36,940 --> 02:16:40,420
that's the most ethical place to hunt
because they don't have any predators.

2363
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:44,500
So they have to kill these animals.
So they have like some insane number of,

2364
02:16:44,590 --> 02:16:49,360
of deer on Lanai. They have a axis
deer on Maui. They have them on a few.

2365
02:16:49,390 --> 02:16:52,900
I think Molokai has him too, cause
there's no predators, predators, none.

2366
02:16:52,901 --> 02:16:54,310
So the only predators or people,

2367
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:57,310
so they actually bring over snipers to
take out some of the deer to keep the

2368
02:16:57,311 --> 02:17:01,330
population numbers down because
if the population gets too high,

2369
02:17:01,450 --> 02:17:05,460
what happens is these deer start getting
disease. They start, you know, they, they,

2370
02:17:05,461 --> 02:17:06,640
they run out of food to eat.

2371
02:17:06,670 --> 02:17:09,040
The good thing about Hawaii
too is there's so much growth,

2372
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:13,660
like so much plant growth they
can like crazy level. I love it.

2373
02:17:13,970 --> 02:17:16,630
You are there for your birthday. We're
what'd you do for your birthday? Nothing.

2374
02:17:16,870 --> 02:17:21,340
What a Disneyland took the kids to
Disneyland. Just some weird shit.

2375
02:17:21,341 --> 02:17:24,400
My family, Kim Haines is family. That's
cool. Disneyland had a good time. Yeah,

2376
02:17:24,401 --> 02:17:26,680
I don't, I don't, I'm
not a big a party guy.

2377
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:30,060
She was still at a birthday part of had
your family speak into a video and it'll

2378
02:17:30,061 --> 02:17:30,894
be a good idea.
Right?

2379
02:17:33,520 --> 02:17:35,660
Still a French press do that

2380
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:40,950
anyway. Yeah. I'm not a big
birthday day then it's just like,

2381
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:42,490
I don't want to be the center
of attention like that.

2382
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:45,940
It's ironic as that sounds because
most of what I do you want to be in the

2383
02:17:45,941 --> 02:17:47,980
center of attention at some
will walk, right? Yeah.

2384
02:17:47,981 --> 02:17:51,220
But it just seems like he's just weird.
Yeah.

2385
02:17:51,221 --> 02:17:54,400
I'd rather just do a set.
Have a nice dinner. Yeah.

2386
02:17:54,760 --> 02:17:59,020
So went to Disneyland or
with the Guardians of Galaxy
ride. God Damn. It's fun.

2387
02:17:59,021 --> 02:18:01,480
I love it. So good. I thought, oh my God,

2388
02:18:01,481 --> 02:18:04,660
they're going to bit make tower of
terror better. Oh, that's right.

2389
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:08,230
How chairs my feet. Right of all time.
They shit. I'm better now. Really?

2390
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:11,230
It's better. I'm not going to galaxy.
Well, I really haven't seen it.

2391
02:18:11,231 --> 02:18:13,120
Go to the galaxies. Right.
He'd never saw that movie.

2392
02:18:13,410 --> 02:18:15,500
It's a fun fucking movie then.
I haven't seen Bart too,

2393
02:18:15,501 --> 02:18:20,270
but I saw apart when you finally saw
La Alien Covenant, who loved how good.

2394
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:23,260
I've loved old Jimmy. Loved it. A lot
of these people that didn't like it.

2395
02:18:23,290 --> 02:18:26,230
My favorite alien get out of my life.
People didn't like that.

2396
02:18:26,730 --> 02:18:31,030
You've got some shit advice.
It was brilliant. Yeah.
What'd you say is a bad movie?

2397
02:18:31,090 --> 02:18:36,040
Alien Covenant. Oh yeah. Click
do. I was grumpy. I was crunk
for that alien. I, I was,

2398
02:18:36,940 --> 02:18:40,690
I loved it. I loved swear to God when the
movie guys, I stood up standing ovation,

2399
02:18:40,720 --> 02:18:45,670
slow clap. Everyone else sit down. I
love when they made the AI guy gave him,

2400
02:18:45,940 --> 02:18:50,590
I don't want to say too much spoiler
for a grip. It doesn't matter.

2401
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:52,980
Some people out there don't have a time.
God Damn it.

2402
02:18:53,010 --> 02:18:56,080
It's been out for how many months you're
going to have to like tune out now

2403
02:18:56,081 --> 02:18:57,640
folks,
because we're going to talk about it.

2404
02:18:57,660 --> 02:19:02,020
Seen Alien Covenant that came out
seven months ago. Go ahead and fucked.

2405
02:19:02,021 --> 02:19:05,530
He has to eat it is to eat it. All
right. You do have to tell the story.

2406
02:19:05,880 --> 02:19:10,480
The one alien, that hybrid
alien. Ooh Dude. It was fun.

2407
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:15,490
I liked the fact that that the AI guy
like they, they cut out as creativity.

2408
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:18,700
Right? He started getting
weird guilt. So it makes sense.

2409
02:19:18,790 --> 02:19:22,600
I give you give artificial intelligence
the the need and the ability to create.

2410
02:19:23,050 --> 02:19:27,080
So, but this movie, it went prometheus's
first, then this, right? Yeah. Yeah.

2411
02:19:27,081 --> 02:19:31,010
It was like 10 years after Prometheans
yeah, atheists. I liked that too.

2412
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:34,460
What was the movie with the alien?
They named him Calvin. You don't,

2413
02:19:34,461 --> 02:19:38,720
I'm talking about and a Ryan we
add, fuck yeah, I like that too.

2414
02:19:39,250 --> 02:19:42,920
I've watched that on every, and I
watched them prop that those movies is,

2415
02:19:42,921 --> 02:19:44,630
there's cut the shit scenes.

2416
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:47,900
Like when the guy that you know life one
where they're playing with it and they

2417
02:19:47,901 --> 02:19:51,320
try these experiments with it and the
shock electric like, hey come on man,

2418
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:54,740
you doing this out in space. Don't you
want to bring this back to Earth for you?

2419
02:19:54,741 --> 02:19:56,930
Start fucking with it.
It's an hour secured laboratory.

2420
02:19:56,931 --> 02:19:58,880
We can't cause you do that.
And then look,

2421
02:19:58,881 --> 02:20:01,580
if we brought that bitch back to
Earth then you know what I'm saying?

2422
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:05,420
I thought that movie was so fucking good
doing things like zapping it and trying

2423
02:20:05,421 --> 02:20:07,730
to like stimulate.
They thought he was dead though.

2424
02:20:08,350 --> 02:20:11,630
Remember until the his
abdomen, he went, Oh yeah,

2425
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:15,950
that movie was so tense.
He was scary as shit was scary.

2426
02:20:16,130 --> 02:20:17,250
You know the problem was the gold.

2427
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:20,160
They gave him a little bit of a
CGI face and I was like, come on.

2428
02:20:20,190 --> 02:20:23,750
I didn't like that either. Like that
demon face. Nah Man, I don't need that.

2429
02:20:24,050 --> 02:20:26,420
Keep Him Calvin. I liked how
they called him Calvin. Yeah,

2430
02:20:26,421 --> 02:20:30,870
because they couldn't make it to demonic
cause then it would be alien cherished,

2431
02:20:30,871 --> 02:20:34,310
the most demonic. That thing is the
most amount of the thing. So scary. Oh,

2432
02:20:34,311 --> 02:20:38,250
it's awesome. God, I loved that movie.
Tongue thing comes out. All this.

2433
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:41,400
I like all a slobber and shit that
comes out of it's mouth to it.

2434
02:20:41,401 --> 02:20:45,050
This big giant fucking bug head dude.
Have you been to the theater?

2435
02:20:45,051 --> 02:20:48,890
It's right off. It's in
Westwood there. I picked,

2436
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:53,450
now you're talking, you get steaks.
You can get chicken tenders.

2437
02:20:53,451 --> 02:20:57,240
I mean you gotta be off your Diet.
Where is it? It's a write off of uh, uh,

2438
02:20:57,410 --> 02:21:00,430
Wilshire, Wilshire, and it's called,

2439
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:05,240
I pick like Sydney apolis that kind of
shared kind of this huge less now at the

2440
02:21:05,241 --> 02:21:08,750
VIP. It's going to cost about $60 get in
the door. That's the way to do it though.

2441
02:21:08,810 --> 02:21:13,580
That's it. Sign. Ooh, where's that? That's
it. Ooh, it's a small theater too. Yeah,

2442
02:21:13,581 --> 02:21:16,330
you did take the community, take your
wifey there. That's the move, man.

2443
02:21:16,970 --> 02:21:19,760
Less people.
They have all alcohol drinks,

2444
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:23,600
who stakes like everything
man. Like it. I like it.

2445
02:21:23,601 --> 02:21:26,570
And you can look down upon the people who
didn't buy the VIP tickets. It's cool.

2446
02:21:26,571 --> 02:21:29,200
And judge out and walk by you. Oh,
so there's people below you there.

2447
02:21:29,201 --> 02:21:32,120
I have regular sex and you're like,
get out of here peasants. Move on.

2448
02:21:32,121 --> 02:21:35,800
Peasant stole. Look at me. What if they
talk? Enjoy the movie pass down below.

2449
02:21:35,830 --> 02:21:38,120
You know they're angry about their
position in society. They might.

2450
02:21:38,620 --> 02:21:42,950
And in the movie theater, I snitch on him.
You can ask Niche, which I'm right away.

2451
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:44,900
Oh, excuse me. Not false ma'am. Ma'Am.

2452
02:21:45,020 --> 02:21:48,290
Do you know that there's a system that
you can get for your house where it

2453
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:52,160
downloads movies as they come out
and you can watch brand new movies.

2454
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:55,090
I need that chance.
They come out cause we're the kid like it,

2455
02:21:55,730 --> 02:21:59,370
like Annabel the new Annabel Kim. I love
scary movies. Like did you see it now?

2456
02:21:59,740 --> 02:22:03,410
I want, I'm dying to see it. That knew.
You seen that new it trailer shit.

2457
02:22:03,411 --> 02:22:07,580
Your pants scary. It looks Kevin
September. Here's how he's moving.

2458
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:08,520
People are getting pissed off.

2459
02:22:10,270 --> 02:22:14,850
I think it's run by Netflix or the same
guy that started Netflix started this

2460
02:22:14,851 --> 02:22:18,060
sort of thing. It's been available
for a while at 50 bucks a month,

2461
02:22:18,090 --> 02:22:21,270
but now it's down to 10 bucks a month.
There's some weird catch.

2462
02:22:21,271 --> 02:22:25,350
This some catches to it like it's only
for two d versions and then like you have

2463
02:22:25,351 --> 02:22:26,184
to pay

2464
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:29,650
for a ticket or something and then he
get paid back. There's some weird cat.

2465
02:22:30,090 --> 02:22:33,510
I would pay like $100 a month
to watch movies at my house.

2466
02:22:33,540 --> 02:22:34,830
This is not at your house though?
Yeah.

2467
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:36,640
This is different than what
they was talking about. Sorry.

2468
02:22:36,641 --> 02:22:38,270
Let's do something totally different.
Oh,

2469
02:22:38,320 --> 02:22:41,710
this is just cheap movie tickets
that people are mad about. Yeah,

2470
02:22:42,090 --> 02:22:44,850
but the house things not cheap.
The house thing is a system you get,

2471
02:22:44,851 --> 02:22:48,570
I think it's like $50,000 and once
you have it installed in your house,

2472
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:53,100
then you can watch movies as they come
out and they're on like a hard drive.

2473
02:22:53,150 --> 02:22:57,240
Such a movie buff dude. If you had like
a home theater. That's what I'm saying.

2474
02:22:57,270 --> 02:23:01,350
Having a home theater is closed movies
cause with a kid it stuff get the

2475
02:23:01,351 --> 02:23:05,430
babysitter. I see mood like fuck
man, I just saw like star wars.

2476
02:23:05,430 --> 02:23:06,630
You know like it takes a while.

2477
02:23:06,631 --> 02:23:11,360
Like I'm like I can't wait for that to
come out on DVD stuff. Yeah. This thing

2478
02:23:13,060 --> 02:23:16,170
you can't even see what movies are. I
think that's exactly it. You pay for it.

2479
02:23:16,370 --> 02:23:20,250
So I can't even find
most movies that are out.

2480
02:23:20,340 --> 02:23:23,430
I think that is exactly it and
it's very expensive. Like I said,

2481
02:23:23,580 --> 02:23:25,380
I think it's like $50,000

2482
02:23:26,910 --> 02:23:31,350
and it just comes with the service to
provide the movie. Yeah, I think you just,

2483
02:23:31,380 --> 02:23:34,740
it's like a hard drive and you download
whatever the movie is that you want to

2484
02:23:34,741 --> 02:23:35,574
see and you can watch it.

2485
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:39,360
I feel like you shouldn't do that now
because with technology is coming so fast

2486
02:23:39,361 --> 02:23:41,190
and, and like Netflix are gone. You know,

2487
02:23:41,191 --> 02:23:44,040
big movie stars like Will Smith and
these guys and Adam Sandler doing these

2488
02:23:44,041 --> 02:23:47,940
Netflix deals so you don't have to go.
The theater is kind of fingerprint reader,

2489
02:23:48,570 --> 02:23:51,600
finger swipe with liveliness detection,

2490
02:23:51,650 --> 02:23:54,320
liveliness live ness mean someone.

2491
02:23:54,330 --> 02:23:58,290
Lots of cut your fucking hand off and
have a dead hand that they used to start

2492
02:23:58,291 --> 02:23:59,160
up your screen.

2493
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:04,200
Let's take your fingerprint on a piece
of paper or a dead hand will live ness

2494
02:24:04,830 --> 02:24:07,770
queer just like you see lack of right
up there on their fingerprints on it.

2495
02:24:07,890 --> 02:24:11,010
What kind of a person wants to kill
someone so they can see pirates of the

2496
02:24:11,011 --> 02:24:14,460
Caribbean? Oh Dude, I would,
I might kill a bitch. See,

2497
02:24:15,940 --> 02:24:20,570
see the new edit my house. I'd slice
one's finger off at home. Dude,

2498
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:21,780
how great would that be?

2499
02:24:22,050 --> 02:24:24,420
I don't like Jim Ready going
out and I want to chill at home.

2500
02:24:24,421 --> 02:24:26,190
My undies watched all the new movies.

2501
02:24:26,191 --> 02:24:29,070
He's a real problem is other people when
they can't keep it together and they

2502
02:24:29,071 --> 02:24:31,140
start answering phones talking.

2503
02:24:31,830 --> 02:24:35,820
I've been at so many movie theaters where
people start talking to so annoying.

2504
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:39,150
I screw this one will be theater.
It was a little urban take that.

2505
02:24:39,151 --> 02:24:43,260
How do you want a little urban and then
the move to homeboy in front of me just

2506
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:46,020
on the phone the whole time
and people are like, God.

2507
02:24:46,021 --> 02:24:49,220
And so I go bro off the phone,
man, and it keeps going.

2508
02:24:49,250 --> 02:24:52,880
Puts up his finger like this. I'm
like, oh, it keeps going. Go Bro.

2509
02:24:52,930 --> 02:24:55,290
Moussaka Gopro off your fucking phone.

2510
02:24:55,470 --> 02:25:00,000
It turns around goes wait till the
movie's over. I've been some fights, man.

2511
02:25:00,001 --> 02:25:02,760
I think I can fight and I the whole movie,
all I could think of, I'm like, alright,

2512
02:25:02,850 --> 02:25:07,320
what am I going to do here? I got my girl
here. What is he with all those people,

2513
02:25:07,730 --> 02:25:10,950
they all look similar. If guests were
drift, what am I going to, Durban,

2514
02:25:10,980 --> 02:25:13,230
am I going to get jumped?
Like how is this? I couldn't,

2515
02:25:13,350 --> 02:25:16,860
I couldn't tell you what movie I
saw in fucks your whole experience.

2516
02:25:17,210 --> 02:25:21,060
I'm just balls deep in popcorn.
I'm gonna fuck carbon carbon up.

2517
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:24,400
Car bloated carbon movie gets done.
He didn't say shit.

2518
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:28,630
Ah, fuck the whole movie up
though. We should have said
something. I was stressed.

2519
02:25:28,970 --> 02:25:33,220
Mm. Just the whole, every middle man,
probably three, four years ago, I think.

2520
02:25:33,221 --> 02:25:35,650
I know I'm thinking if I was you,

2521
02:25:35,651 --> 02:25:38,560
if I could remote control your body
and my cove there smack me in the head.

2522
02:25:38,740 --> 02:25:41,890
But what happens if there's a
bunch band you were with your girl,

2523
02:25:41,891 --> 02:25:45,070
you know what I'm saying? It depends
on how many got, but yeah, that's,

2524
02:25:45,071 --> 02:25:46,030
it is a very,

2525
02:25:46,031 --> 02:25:50,440
very rude and disrespectful and
be on your phone on Instagram.

2526
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:51,490
Like I can see your phone,

2527
02:25:51,491 --> 02:25:56,080
you're on Facebook and what the fuck
you're in the movies. He's a dummy dummy.

2528
02:25:56,440 --> 02:25:58,750
You're a dummy there.
God damn addicted to their phones.

2529
02:25:58,751 --> 02:26:02,620
Like do you know a few people have the
ability to sit through a fucking podcast

2530
02:26:02,621 --> 02:26:06,250
without looking at their phones? You know
how to do it. But a lot of my guests,

2531
02:26:06,340 --> 02:26:10,800
I see them checking their phones,
checking their phones, texting, hold on.

2532
02:26:10,801 --> 02:26:15,610
Just kind of Texas. So disrespectful. You
do that if you're on sports center. Yeah.

2533
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:18,520
Right. Especially not now. You
know at this in this day and age,

2534
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:22,900
but for some people the requirement of
an hour or two or in a podcast three

2535
02:26:23,140 --> 02:26:26,350
without checking the phone, impossible,
chill out. You're not that busy folks.

2536
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:30,550
It's not that. It's they're addicts,
they're straight up junkies.

2537
02:26:30,610 --> 02:26:31,930
They're getting that little tweak,

2538
02:26:31,931 --> 02:26:35,830
that little rush of anticipation right
that down. If they get an email or text,

2539
02:26:35,831 --> 02:26:39,400
they say literally we don't, and we don't
even know how addicted the phones are,

2540
02:26:39,401 --> 02:26:41,770
but people,
their brains are coming in addicted to it.

2541
02:26:41,771 --> 02:26:46,771
Just to the sensation of feeling it and
the colors and mentions and Instagram

2542
02:26:46,921 --> 02:26:49,690
and dms. And what's your my phone real
quick. Yeah. Let me check my phone.

2543
02:26:50,770 --> 02:26:52,920
It just seems like we're talking
about my mouth to salvation.

2544
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:57,100
It's never as fun as talking to friends,
but you go to a restaurant,

2545
02:26:57,101 --> 02:26:59,590
you'll see five people on their phones,
not even looking at each other.

2546
02:26:59,950 --> 02:27:00,810
I hate that shit.

2547
02:27:00,820 --> 02:27:03,040
When you're hanging out with a friend
and they're on their phone all the time,

2548
02:27:03,070 --> 02:27:07,270
it's brutal. It's like, dude, I be
here, can be here, but your phone down,

2549
02:27:07,570 --> 02:27:10,120
put your phone down. There's
some restaurants, they take
your phone at the door,

2550
02:27:10,121 --> 02:27:13,810
you know that fuck. And there's some
that give 20 bucks. Then there's some,

2551
02:27:13,811 --> 02:27:17,410
if you don't use your phone, you get 25%
off. If you don't use your phone at all.

2552
02:27:17,411 --> 02:27:21,840
So your camera's overhead. I don't
know how gang checking. Gotcha. No, no,

2553
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:24,400
no. You're in the restaurant
and you checked it. No,

2554
02:27:24,401 --> 02:27:26,620
we've got a trick to when I got up
from the table now it doesn't count.

2555
02:27:26,620 --> 02:27:29,260
Don't get the deal. My man, I was taking
a shit. I didn't have anything to do.

2556
02:27:29,450 --> 02:27:33,250
You can't check it. He's
still, you checked in the
restaurant in the restaurant.

2557
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:34,180
I don't know how it works.

2558
02:27:34,450 --> 02:27:38,530
Taking p fake shit so he could check
your Facebook took a fake shit just to

2559
02:27:38,531 --> 02:27:42,550
check your Facebook addicted son.
Yeah. And people are super addicted.

2560
02:27:42,790 --> 02:27:45,730
You and Joey d has a pretty
good about calling. Oh yeah.

2561
02:27:45,750 --> 02:27:49,850
I called [inaudible] and I take
so much of my sometimes you know,

2562
02:27:49,880 --> 02:27:52,270
sometimes I don't know cause you're busy.
So now I'm busy.

2563
02:27:52,271 --> 02:27:56,120
So you got a tax when you texting novels
now we went back and forth. There was a,

2564
02:27:56,230 --> 02:27:59,550
we had a question, I'm like, okay, I got
to hear this. Yeah, we had a talk. Yeah,

2565
02:27:59,590 --> 02:28:02,320
it's exhausting. Yeah man.
There's some people that just,

2566
02:28:02,530 --> 02:28:05,320
they what for whatever reason
are tethered to the hip.

2567
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:07,660
And then there's some people that
decide they can't use it at all.

2568
02:28:07,810 --> 02:28:12,780
So they just go straight cell phone.
Like, like Putin phone flip phone. Yeah.

2569
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:17,650
Sorry. Ari Aziz Ansari as he's
Ansari's gone totally off the Internet.

2570
02:28:17,651 --> 02:28:19,900
I was watching some video
with an intern or a no,

2571
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:22,550
it was a reading of vice article,
I think it was vice.

2572
02:28:22,820 --> 02:28:25,970
They interviewed them and they were
asking about it. He, he is an offline,

2573
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:29,660
he's killing, got rid of his social
media, really got rid of all his shit.

2574
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:33,110
He doesn't do anything. So
did uh, ed Sheeran cause he,

2575
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:36,830
he appeared on game of Thrones and he got
such backlash. He was just, you know, he,

2576
02:28:36,890 --> 02:28:38,990
he stopped doing it.
How many book cons?

2577
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:41,630
You have thicker skin flake
off line for a few days, Bro.

2578
02:28:41,660 --> 02:28:45,860
But people are going to use it for
what it is, you know, put these trolls.

2579
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:48,310
Who gives a fuck everything.
Everything.

2580
02:28:48,320 --> 02:28:50,930
There's nothing that you do to get away
from that. Nothing. It is what it is.

2581
02:28:50,960 --> 02:28:54,350
Go to Kevin Hart's post and
it's like fuck you Kevin Hart.

2582
02:28:55,820 --> 02:29:00,410
Kevin Hart does to many people and
everybody having access to everybody being

2583
02:29:00,411 --> 02:29:01,460
able to communicate with you.

2584
02:29:01,790 --> 02:29:05,900
If you just decide to swim in that river
and you wonder why he got poisoned.

2585
02:29:05,990 --> 02:29:10,070
Yeah, I agree. The promise with
your kids, like even now my son,

2586
02:29:10,071 --> 02:29:12,200
he wants grabbed my phone and
you don't do it like just,

2587
02:29:12,530 --> 02:29:14,840
he's not going to Twitter and
checking dams and Dick pics,

2588
02:29:14,841 --> 02:29:18,290
but he's like scrolling
through everything. Just cause
the stimulation. Oh yeah.

2589
02:29:18,310 --> 02:29:21,110
What was like your daughters and
how old are they? Seven and nine.

2590
02:29:21,690 --> 02:29:25,610
They have phones. No. Do your
nine year old does it? No.

2591
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:29,550
No, she didn't shut the school. The,

2592
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:35,240
I wonder if you give kids phones,

2593
02:29:35,241 --> 02:29:37,460
you let them see beheading videos.

2594
02:29:37,460 --> 02:29:39,620
You're letting them tune
them on the latest news.

2595
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:42,800
They can see that car
run over those people,

2596
02:29:42,801 --> 02:29:46,640
that white power rally and all that
shit a kid can see and they're gonna see

2597
02:29:46,641 --> 02:29:47,930
their friends going to tell them about it.

2598
02:29:48,920 --> 02:29:51,530
Just think of the shit that you look
at. I mean, think of the shit that I,

2599
02:29:51,740 --> 02:29:54,920
every day I'm posting
some new ridiculous video.

2600
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:58,700
Someone doing something stupid and some
brain damage could like keep an eye on

2601
02:29:58,701 --> 02:29:59,011
your kids.

2602
02:29:59,011 --> 02:30:03,590
Hit ninth grade is nine years old is
what grade third and they're going into

2603
02:30:03,591 --> 02:30:05,780
fourth wait til she gets to sixth grade.
Yeah.

2604
02:30:05,781 --> 02:30:08,160
I think like you'd have to be
the nerd in school or some,

2605
02:30:08,180 --> 02:30:12,950
sometimes they didn't have the iPads
to write notes and shit. Oh yeah,

2606
02:30:12,951 --> 02:30:14,930
for sure. And those things
go online. Yeah. Yeah.

2607
02:30:14,931 --> 02:30:18,110
It's one of those things where you got
to wonder at what point is it okay to

2608
02:30:18,111 --> 02:30:21,410
give it to them and how much do you
regulate it and how much you do.

2609
02:30:21,410 --> 02:30:23,630
You do it by example. You know, if,

2610
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:26,390
if you're at home with your kids and
like stay off the phone kids and you're

2611
02:30:26,391 --> 02:30:29,060
just like constantly checking on,
then they're going to be pissed at you.

2612
02:30:29,150 --> 02:30:32,120
There should be no phones
between whatever, you know,
especially dinner time.

2613
02:30:32,121 --> 02:30:33,350
So it's going to be a beast,
man.

2614
02:30:33,351 --> 02:30:36,230
What do we do with a big thing
we do in my house, a lot of art,

2615
02:30:36,850 --> 02:30:39,260
a lot of arts school constantly,
constantly.

2616
02:30:39,261 --> 02:30:41,780
Like they're always painting
and drawing and doing shit.

2617
02:30:41,781 --> 02:30:45,590
If you give kids that opportunity to do
something and then they get like in a

2618
02:30:45,591 --> 02:30:48,070
pattern of doing it all the time
where they're not, you know,

2619
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:52,490
their stimulation doesn't cut
TV, phone watch TV or no, yeah,

2620
02:30:52,491 --> 02:30:54,530
we let them watch TV.
We don't keep it from them,

2621
02:30:54,531 --> 02:30:58,720
but we don't let them watch it all
day. Yeah. So it's, I think that like,

2622
02:30:58,760 --> 02:31:02,720
I think especially creativity's important
for kids because the more they realize

2623
02:31:02,721 --> 02:31:03,680
they can make things.

2624
02:31:03,980 --> 02:31:07,550
Even if you could just make something
out of paper machete or something where

2625
02:31:07,551 --> 02:31:10,840
you're writing something, you
know, something that didn't exist,

2626
02:31:10,860 --> 02:31:13,820
you like my daughter writes stories,
like a story that didn't exist.

2627
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,250
Now the story's written like you wrote it,
you created it.

2628
02:31:16,470 --> 02:31:19,260
Like you realize you read stories,
you can also write him, you know,

2629
02:31:19,261 --> 02:31:21,600
paintings and make a painting,
make a drawing.

2630
02:31:21,610 --> 02:31:23,250
And the more you realize
you can create things,

2631
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:28,140
it's my thought that it opens up your
idea of what's possible for your whole

2632
02:31:28,141 --> 02:31:31,040
life. You can create things in your
life. You don't have to bank on anyone.

2633
02:31:31,041 --> 02:31:34,110
You can create businesses,
you can create a career.

2634
02:31:34,111 --> 02:31:37,860
You could figure out like how to
work hard at something and create it.

2635
02:31:37,980 --> 02:31:42,600
I also think it's really good for their
little brains to like make things. Yeah.

2636
02:31:42,630 --> 02:31:45,940
For me it's weird because every
morning I live across from a school to

2637
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:48,870
elementary school. Yesterday was
there the first day of school.

2638
02:31:48,871 --> 02:31:50,490
So there's all these parents
dropping off the kids.

2639
02:31:50,790 --> 02:31:53,970
I was watching the kids play outside.
I walked my son every morning.

2640
02:31:54,150 --> 02:31:57,110
I was thinking, God, how the fuck
is he going to make friends like us?

2641
02:31:57,180 --> 02:32:01,110
All the clicks. I've never thought
about ever, ever in my life of that.

2642
02:32:01,380 --> 02:32:04,620
How this little Duke and I make friends
[inaudible] if he doesn't make friends,

2643
02:32:04,621 --> 02:32:09,210
stay on me. All the friends
work, not, you can't be the nerd.

2644
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:12,330
He can't, he can't be paranoid
and say, give me 10 pushups.

2645
02:32:12,450 --> 02:32:14,980
Even when they don't make friends
that that's good to, you know,

2646
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:17,920
realize like what's wrong? Like why
aren't you making friends? Like what?

2647
02:32:18,300 --> 02:32:20,070
Just your behavior accordingly.
It won't,

2648
02:32:20,071 --> 02:32:24,020
don't be the introverted kid who's in
balls deep into the comics maybe or fine

2649
02:32:24,021 --> 02:32:27,190
are the ones who also or yeah,
I agree or do and then,

2650
02:32:27,270 --> 02:32:30,300
and then take over the world
like Hollywood, you know,

2651
02:32:30,301 --> 02:32:33,600
but it's the first time it ever crossed
my mind. I saw all these kids playing.

2652
02:32:33,601 --> 02:32:36,750
I thought, AH, why don't, if he doesn't
like France, I got to deal with that.

2653
02:32:36,900 --> 02:32:40,570
What are you going to do if your son
gets older and he is like sort of

2654
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:45,090
introverted, kind of nerdy and you
see some predatory bitch move in.

2655
02:32:45,210 --> 02:32:49,560
What if your son becomes like some super
successful producer type character and

2656
02:32:49,561 --> 02:32:52,080
you see some printed,
oh my God.

2657
02:32:52,081 --> 02:32:56,670
Predatory Coyote type woman
just not to Leech runs him.

2658
02:32:56,730 --> 02:32:58,710
Tells him what to do. Oh,
oh my God. You see it.

2659
02:32:58,711 --> 02:33:01,970
You go with the house and you're like,
son, you can't let her tell you that.

2660
02:33:02,010 --> 02:33:06,420
Just nothing. You can do the power
of the pussy. There's nothing and do,

2661
02:33:06,510 --> 02:33:08,400
do you know that feeling
that you have when a friend,

2662
02:33:08,430 --> 02:33:12,750
when you see a friend is
getting taken over? Like, like
almost like I go like, uh,

2663
02:33:13,320 --> 02:33:16,800
a pod person, you know, like one of
them night of the living dead? No, not,

2664
02:33:16,801 --> 02:33:20,760
not as Avatar. What does
that fucking movie? They, a
vision of the body snatchers.

2665
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:24,720
Remember hod was under the bed.
Never saw the movie. No, dude. Well,

2666
02:33:24,721 --> 02:33:26,340
there's a couple versions of it.
There's a really,

2667
02:33:26,341 --> 02:33:30,150
really old version for like the 50. It's
the new one that, well, there's three.

2668
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:33,450
There's a Donald Sutherland version,
which is I think want to see like the 70s,

2669
02:33:33,451 --> 02:33:36,310
which is excellent.
A young Jeff gold blooms in that movie.

2670
02:33:37,120 --> 02:33:40,740
It's a great movie and it's creepy,
scary and you know,

2671
02:33:40,780 --> 02:33:43,320
like good special effects for the time,
for the time.

2672
02:33:43,590 --> 02:33:48,590
And then there's a more recent one with
Jennifer Tilly I think is in it or meg

2673
02:33:49,201 --> 02:33:54,060
Tilly. Meg Tilly. Jennifer Tilly
is sister and their paws. Yeah.

2674
02:33:54,420 --> 02:33:58,290
Yeah. What it is is while
you're sleeping, um, it,

2675
02:33:58,320 --> 02:34:02,550
it somehow or another like the fibers
get ahold of you. Like it climbs up.

2676
02:34:02,551 --> 02:34:04,200
Like if the pods like near the bed,

2677
02:34:04,410 --> 02:34:08,790
it gets a hold of you and touches you
and then it puts you to sleep and starts

2678
02:34:08,791 --> 02:34:13,740
replicating you underneath the bed.
So like while while you're sleeping,

2679
02:34:13,741 --> 02:34:16,770
it's like draining your
body and replicating you.

2680
02:34:16,771 --> 02:34:18,250
And then in the morning you're dead.

2681
02:34:18,490 --> 02:34:22,810
You're like a dry hos alien is underneath.
Yeah.

2682
02:34:22,930 --> 02:34:25,510
So this is Donald
Sutherland as he's asleep.

2683
02:34:25,660 --> 02:34:30,100
This thing he had was taking over and
recreating him and he woke up before it

2684
02:34:30,101 --> 02:34:32,970
was too late. Dude, it was adult
movie. Let's Kiefer Sutherland.

2685
02:34:32,980 --> 02:34:37,750
His dad is out of even know
that no one knew our Keith.

2686
02:34:38,070 --> 02:34:42,370
That's what fucked up dad was
Donald Sutherland. That's,
that's Jack Bauer. Right.

2687
02:34:42,380 --> 02:34:45,640
If you, uh, if you grow up in your
dad's a famous actor and your,

2688
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:48,490
you become an actor yourself, you gotta be
fucked up. Yeah. It'd be a little weird.

2689
02:34:48,491 --> 02:34:51,610
That's the end. Oh, that must be the
new one right there. That poster.

2690
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:57,160
What is that one? Invasion of the body
snatchers. Yeah. [inaudible] 78. No,

2691
02:34:57,220 --> 02:35:00,030
that must be the 78 version.
Cause it the newer ones. Oh,

2692
02:35:00,100 --> 02:35:03,850
the newer one is below that in green.
See it in green down there. We'll show.

2693
02:35:03,851 --> 02:35:07,970
That's the really old one.
That's the 1950s one. Ooh Dude.

2694
02:35:07,980 --> 02:35:12,670
It looks pretty sweet. There was one
more that, uh, happened with meg Tilly.

2695
02:35:12,671 --> 02:35:17,330
I don't remember what year, but I want
to say it's like maybe late nights.

2696
02:35:17,740 --> 02:35:20,890
Don't recreate it already.
Yeah, there she is

2697
02:35:22,770 --> 02:35:25,780
based at the body statutes.
The dork report.

2698
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:31,670
Bodysnatchers oh, it's just
called body snatchers. It's
brilliant. Oh really? Yeah.

2699
02:35:32,290 --> 02:35:37,030
I'll check that shit out. Um, do you know
what movie was? That's the porn version.

2700
02:35:37,890 --> 02:35:39,880
Body starts. You don't move. It was dope.

2701
02:35:39,881 --> 02:35:43,960
I watched on the plane with
19 1983 that was pretty good,

2702
02:35:45,070 --> 02:35:47,230
but it's one of those things like you
don't even really make those things so

2703
02:35:47,231 --> 02:35:50,920
many times. What was dope? I watched that
movie with Ben Affleck where he gets it.

2704
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:55,680
He moved to Tampa. He's like
a mafia gangster moves to
table this accountant. No,

2705
02:35:55,700 --> 02:35:58,960
no, no, no. See I thought it was the
county I was, I was taking some pills.

2706
02:35:58,980 --> 02:36:02,170
I was a little out of it. I thought it
was the counting and I was like, what the,

2707
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:06,430
he counted the accountant and I was like,
that's not this. It was something else.

2708
02:36:06,730 --> 02:36:09,160
That shit was so good.
Really? Yeah. He's like,

2709
02:36:09,161 --> 02:36:11,440
he's involved with the mob and
they wanted me to go run the,

2710
02:36:11,460 --> 02:36:15,970
the Tampa Bay wing of it. So he goes
down there. Oh fuck. It was good, Huh?

2711
02:36:16,110 --> 02:36:20,080
Oh Man. It was fucking classic. Well
has it? Yeah. Hi. Where are you?

2712
02:36:20,081 --> 02:36:23,350
You're high as a kite.
I might've been fucking ambien and shit.

2713
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:27,100
They don't work on me. Really. I took
him in Austria and people are like,

2714
02:36:27,101 --> 02:36:29,920
only take one. I was like, I'm not that
sleepy. So I pop the three of them.

2715
02:36:30,430 --> 02:36:34,420
I was fucking one eye open just
like Ben Affleck's the best ever.

2716
02:36:35,170 --> 02:36:38,450
Live by gas.
6.4 on rotten tomatoes.

2717
02:36:38,470 --> 02:36:41,800
Fucking haters are my down
after you fucking hate.

2718
02:36:42,910 --> 02:36:46,300
Why do people hate on athletic?
He's goodwill. Hunting.
Seems like a Douche though.

2719
02:36:46,810 --> 02:36:50,940
How dare you ever see his argument with
Sam Harris on the bill Maher show now a

2720
02:36:50,950 --> 02:36:54,040
habit and a very uninformed huge mistake.

2721
02:36:54,280 --> 02:36:58,150
He argued with Sam Harris about the what?
What's in Islam?

2722
02:36:58,180 --> 02:37:02,430
Well hey listen,
I don't want to say stay in your lane.

2723
02:37:02,470 --> 02:37:07,060
I'm all over the place. But
with Ben Affleck, Sam Harris,
he'd never seen it. No,

2724
02:37:07,090 --> 02:37:09,010
it's hilarious cause Affleck
doesn't know what to do.

2725
02:37:09,011 --> 02:37:12,700
So he goes full social justice warrior
and starts calling Sam Harris are racist.

2726
02:37:13,180 --> 02:37:16,970
It's gross. You're so gross. It's so
racist. What? Saying it's so gross.

2727
02:37:17,270 --> 02:37:20,750
And then Sam Harris is like super
calm this. He's the problem.

2728
02:37:20,751 --> 02:37:24,060
Like you can't like yell and argue with
Harris because he will never go there.

2729
02:37:24,090 --> 02:37:27,230
It makes you look in,
it makes you look super amateur,

2730
02:37:27,350 --> 02:37:29,830
especially when he starts spouting
off facts on explaining the,

2731
02:37:29,980 --> 02:37:33,980
we were talking about an ideology.
Did Ben Affleck go on there to debate him?

2732
02:37:34,340 --> 02:37:38,810
I think what it was is he was getting
ready for Batman. This is my personal,

2733
02:37:39,130 --> 02:37:43,910
uh, belief. Uh, it has no basis, in
fact, and it's just pure speculation.

2734
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:47,630
He was on steroids. He was on
steroids getting ready for Batman.

2735
02:37:47,660 --> 02:37:49,670
You've got jack for Batman.
He got jacked.

2736
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:53,070
And I think when you get jacked like that,
get a little fucking testing.

2737
02:37:55,350 --> 02:37:59,700
He had, he had no, he had
no data. This fuck you bro.

2738
02:37:59,701 --> 02:38:03,920
About he tried to sling a little Dana.
It's Sam Harris,

2739
02:38:03,980 --> 02:38:07,940
and he just got, just got run
over. Oh my God. What do you think?

2740
02:38:07,941 --> 02:38:12,830
Kings go run over. And everybody was
Super Mad at him afterwards. He was like,

2741
02:38:12,860 --> 02:38:17,300
oh yeah, online. They got torn apart and
they just handled it very poorly. I see.

2742
02:38:17,301 --> 02:38:19,550
I don't get the hate, well,
obviously he fucked up there,

2743
02:38:19,551 --> 02:38:22,600
but I don't get the hate with Ben
Affleck. He makes good movies, but Gili.

2744
02:38:22,601 --> 02:38:27,020
All right, you're fucking to see that. And
they go, Ooh, that's the real you. Well,

2745
02:38:27,021 --> 02:38:31,820
that's it, but is it 3 million? I at
him, Rose Lane on steroids. Could be,

2746
02:38:33,580 --> 02:38:34,610
could be.
Couldn't be.

2747
02:38:34,760 --> 02:38:37,100
I would think that I've never
seen him behave like that before,

2748
02:38:37,101 --> 02:38:38,690
and he definitely got
jacked for that movie.

2749
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:41,510
And when you're 45 years old
or whatever he is, you don't,

2750
02:38:41,570 --> 02:38:44,240
you just don't get jacked. Like,
no, you don't put on muscle.

2751
02:38:44,241 --> 02:38:46,960
I don't put it on normal.
It's not normal you,

2752
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:51,530
unless you're on some radical supplements,
which if Hollywood called me,

2753
02:38:51,531 --> 02:38:53,600
it was a kid. We to be Bruce
Wayne. I'm going to get on that,

2754
02:38:53,810 --> 02:38:55,430
but Gotham city cycle,

2755
02:38:55,590 --> 02:38:58,760
I'm going to get on some of that
Clenbuterol to lower my body fat. Oh,

2756
02:38:58,761 --> 02:39:03,350
I'm calling fucking, I'll
release the hounds. I'm a fuck.

2757
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:07,020
They won't even need a mask. It's
just going to be that yet. Um,

2758
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:11,960
he gained 20 pounds, 228
pounds total, got down to 7.9%.

2759
02:39:11,961 --> 02:39:13,640
Body fat.
Ben Affleck's trainer,

2760
02:39:13,641 --> 02:39:16,720
Walter Norton Junior talks
about Ben Affleck's eight.

2761
02:39:16,770 --> 02:39:21,530
During the day's filming the town,
he lost 12 pounds for the town.

2762
02:39:21,710 --> 02:39:25,040
He was stronger and every lift
hate Walter Norton Junior.

2763
02:39:25,041 --> 02:39:26,660
How would you tell us the cycle he's on?

2764
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:29,930
Cattell she the truth
thought about testosterone.

2765
02:39:30,070 --> 02:39:34,250
But if your photo of him with
his shirt off at 7.9% body fat,

2766
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:38,600
because I think I'm calling bullshit on
that. You know how low that is? Very low.

2767
02:39:38,601 --> 02:39:41,900
He never got that ripped.
He wasn't even as ripped as a,

2768
02:39:41,901 --> 02:39:45,320
the last Batman Christian Bale. Christian
Bale coat hanger though. You know,

2769
02:39:45,321 --> 02:39:49,160
he's real thin now. He got jacked
and he's, he's always thin.

2770
02:39:49,850 --> 02:39:53,690
Um, real low body fat no more. Yeah.

2771
02:39:54,230 --> 02:39:57,410
I don't think he's an ectomorph.
Mesomorph no, I don't know. Well,

2772
02:39:57,411 --> 02:40:00,440
let's look at him. Look at him next,
but I think you're wrong on that. Wow.

2773
02:40:00,580 --> 02:40:04,100
Let's see. You got a good
picture. Pull it up so we can say,

2774
02:40:05,090 --> 02:40:07,730
show us what do we got
here? No, that's not good.

2775
02:40:07,820 --> 02:40:11,780
Shirtless Atlas or him in a tank top.
That him right.

2776
02:40:11,781 --> 02:40:15,390
He's fucking just one right there.
The Rock. Oh, that's the Ra.

2777
02:40:15,450 --> 02:40:19,030
That's the rocks body. The,
my daddy's Jack. That's the
rock. Oh, that's fine. Yeah,

2778
02:40:19,031 --> 02:40:22,890
that's the tattoos. He'll go up to
the one right there. That's superman.

2779
02:40:23,260 --> 02:40:27,720
Is it a dance? Superman. Oh, searing.
Mass belly. So Brian's jacked.

2780
02:40:28,170 --> 02:40:32,810
Ben Affleck is kind of sorted. Jack
put Ben Affleck shirtless. That's,

2781
02:40:32,820 --> 02:40:37,200
that's Ben Affleck. A fucking dad
mode though. That's not him shirtless.

2782
02:40:37,920 --> 02:40:40,090
What's that word there?
That's still superman.

2783
02:40:41,920 --> 02:40:46,060
That's at the BC.
Not Buying it.

2784
02:40:47,560 --> 02:40:50,580
Not Buying it. I don't give a
fuck if that was 10 years ago.

2785
02:40:51,820 --> 02:40:54,420
You don't let me stop.
Let me stop this right now.

2786
02:40:54,480 --> 02:40:58,590
That is so not 7.9% body fat.
Go back.

2787
02:40:58,620 --> 02:41:00,210
Go back to those pictures
of him right there.

2788
02:41:00,600 --> 02:41:04,320
That is not even remotely seventeen's.
That's why.

2789
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:09,480
That's not more like 20 right? Yeah. Let
me just an Argo. Okay. Different movie.

2790
02:41:09,550 --> 02:41:12,840
Good upper right hand corner. Upper right
hand corner. No, that's not him son.

2791
02:41:12,841 --> 02:41:17,020
That's the wolf from a true
blood. Diabetes. Hello?

2792
02:41:17,220 --> 02:41:20,490
Why are they lying here? Ben Affleck's
has ripped sexy. You Jack. No,

2793
02:41:20,491 --> 02:41:23,700
Chris Pratt got jacked.
I don't know if that's real.

2794
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:30,060
That's been Africa that Chris
Pratt. That's, see, that's
not really that jacked.

2795
02:41:30,270 --> 02:41:34,190
There was a scene of him in, that's
how it used to be. He used to be fat.

2796
02:41:34,220 --> 02:41:37,620
He looked pretty. Looks pretty good.
Yeah, but that's not like the rock jacked.

2797
02:41:37,740 --> 02:41:42,720
Jesus Christ. It's fake.
All these are fake pictures.

2798
02:41:42,740 --> 02:41:46,260
Who was that guy?
American Dad.

2799
02:41:46,261 --> 02:41:50,610
Him and Batman suit son's got a
bullshit suit on. So there's, oh,

2800
02:41:50,940 --> 02:41:55,470
go to homeboy there. Yes. Jake
Gyllenhaal. Oh yeah, he did get jacked.

2801
02:41:56,910 --> 02:41:59,490
You know who else got really Jake Gillen?

2802
02:42:00,750 --> 02:42:05,070
Damn homeboy got shot. 7% body fat. Yes.

2803
02:42:05,190 --> 02:42:09,170
That's what 7% looks like. Go back to him
now you go into gay porn. Jamie, stop it.

2804
02:42:10,080 --> 02:42:13,890
I'm just seeing who end have an Affleck
or see if it's a guy jerk off to now

2805
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:18,240
he's fucking super, just like 10%
the San Francisco is so unheard of.

2806
02:42:18,540 --> 02:42:21,880
That looks like a guy was fighting
in the UFC right now, correct? Yeah.

2807
02:42:22,160 --> 02:42:25,590
Jay and walls with my face. Yeah.
See that's the kind of dedication.

2808
02:42:25,620 --> 02:42:30,260
I don't know if Ben have like, dude,
get down to that goodwill hunting.

2809
02:42:30,261 --> 02:42:33,990
He never saw that and I've never
seen that. That's some shit.

2810
02:42:35,820 --> 02:42:38,550
Now go to Christian Bale.
See much more Jack.

2811
02:42:38,580 --> 02:42:43,050
There's some good pictures of Christian
Bale jacked type in Christian Bale. Jack,

2812
02:42:43,080 --> 02:42:46,740
that's pretty good right
there. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

2813
02:42:47,610 --> 02:42:51,630
Now he's, he just looked more like
a guy who could really fuck you up.

2814
02:42:52,290 --> 02:42:56,550
Then I feel like Ben Affleck looks
true. No disrespect, no disrespect.

2815
02:42:56,551 --> 02:42:59,850
Like right there. Upper left hand
car. All right. Ryan Reynolds.

2816
02:42:59,880 --> 02:43:02,860
First team all by fucking
jacked right there is,

2817
02:43:03,570 --> 02:43:08,460
I mean that looks like a
real Batman. Yeah. Oh my God.

2818
02:43:08,640 --> 02:43:09,720
That's the machinist.

2819
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:15,200
That was like one of the worst movies he
ever did in terms of like the reception

2820
02:43:15,501 --> 02:43:18,730
and gone. How many people watched it?
It wasn't bad. It was really weird.

2821
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:22,810
But the difference between being the
skinny guy in the right hand side,

2822
02:43:22,900 --> 02:43:26,410
which was like him dying.
I mean he essentially starved himself,

2823
02:43:26,470 --> 02:43:30,430
almost a death and then a few months
later he's the guy on the left.

2824
02:43:30,610 --> 02:43:34,180
That's him in the movie. Fuck yeah.
He played a guy with narcolepsy.

2825
02:43:34,181 --> 02:43:37,900
They couldn't sleep, didn't eat.
Look how skinny he got, man.

2826
02:43:38,050 --> 02:43:40,960
He's all good of an actor. Is that
fucking, I don't know if that's acting.

2827
02:43:40,990 --> 02:43:45,730
That's just being a psycho that's
dedicated to get crashed into your car.

2828
02:43:45,740 --> 02:43:48,880
You craft a starving to death.
You're really good at it. I mean,

2829
02:43:48,881 --> 02:43:52,270
that's the mental willpower.
It's a, Oh yeah, for sure.

2830
02:43:52,300 --> 02:43:55,900
But it's really bad for your body.
Oh, and it's not good enough.

2831
02:43:56,050 --> 02:43:57,780
It's not good enough of a movie too.

2832
02:43:57,790 --> 02:44:01,160
I'll tell you who got jacked was
Ryan Reynolds. Oh, he's jacked. Yeah.

2833
02:44:01,250 --> 02:44:05,200
For Blade two. Oh. Oh yeah, that's right.

2834
02:44:05,650 --> 02:44:07,480
That's right.
Yeah.

2835
02:44:07,990 --> 02:44:10,720
But why wouldn't you do that if
you're playing up a fake character?

2836
02:44:10,721 --> 02:44:15,550
I don't get why you wouldn't do a nice
cycle. Oh yeah, for sure. Or you do the,

2837
02:44:15,551 --> 02:44:19,360
uh, yeah, he was jacked.
Or you do the Girard thing.

2838
02:44:19,510 --> 02:44:23,680
What's that guy's name from 300 butler?
Yeah. They just CGI the fuck out of you.

2839
02:44:24,120 --> 02:44:28,960
[inaudible] story with that.
We're 300. They're, you know,

2840
02:44:28,961 --> 02:44:29,710
they're making a movie.

2841
02:44:29,710 --> 02:44:33,400
Everyone's doing crossfit nonstop doing
the spark workouts and Butler is not

2842
02:44:33,401 --> 02:44:36,610
showing up. And they're like, what the
fuck, man? He's like, I'm not doing this.

2843
02:44:36,611 --> 02:44:39,670
I don't want to do that. He goes,
just tell me when I have to be ready.

2844
02:44:39,970 --> 02:44:42,850
I will be ready by any means
necessary. Like really? He's like,

2845
02:44:43,030 --> 02:44:47,010
I got this and the didn't do what
everyone else didn't came fucking

2846
02:44:49,270 --> 02:44:50,103
hi.

2847
02:44:55,220 --> 02:44:58,070
Killed it. Yeah. Well it probably,
well, the thing about the,

2848
02:44:58,310 --> 02:45:02,050
is that really what his body actually
looked like, wow, but now he's fucking,

2849
02:45:02,060 --> 02:45:03,710
he was in there like,
what the fuck?

2850
02:45:03,711 --> 02:45:07,250
He was super jacked and
then he let himself go. Wow.
It's hard to maintain that.

2851
02:45:08,130 --> 02:45:10,070
Yeah, that's, he can't mean
how much is it? It's real.

2852
02:45:10,850 --> 02:45:14,810
How much is what he really looked like?
Oh, go upper left hand corner. Yeah.

2853
02:45:14,870 --> 02:45:19,790
Was that okay? That's, that's more
realistic. Now there's even a better one.

2854
02:45:19,791 --> 02:45:23,060
Keeps you look at it.
Go to that one set of tits on them.

2855
02:45:23,960 --> 02:45:25,070
Then I'm so go.

2856
02:45:25,130 --> 02:45:28,100
Imagine if you're a girl and you're think
you're fucking 300 and you get to that

2857
02:45:28,101 --> 02:45:32,030
God damn and you feel that a hundred pads
resting on the top of your ass while I

2858
02:45:32,100 --> 02:45:32,520
Bang

2859
02:45:32,520 --> 02:45:33,353
behind

2860
02:45:37,970 --> 02:45:40,400
this year.
Hold up girl.

2861
02:45:41,620 --> 02:45:45,650
Breast thug is a spartan life.
Holy Step fucker off to movie.

2862
02:45:47,480 --> 02:45:50,750
God, you go halfway limp because
you doing coke all night.

2863
02:45:52,770 --> 02:45:54,330
Just the worst night of your life.

2864
02:45:57,070 --> 02:46:00,840
I'm just going to do when they
come for you. Brennan sharp.

2865
02:46:00,850 --> 02:46:03,660
We're gonna get out of here and get
another podcast. We do. That was fun. Man.

2866
02:46:04,050 --> 02:46:07,200
Flew by. Three hours. Three
hours, fucking flew by

2867
02:46:09,010 --> 02:46:09,960
of the definitely.
So

2868
02:46:10,020 --> 02:46:14,660
Mayweather, Mcgregor, we'd probably
made some MMA sites. Awesome headlines.

2869
02:46:14,690 --> 02:46:17,090
Do you have any, any
prediction on it? You can't.

2870
02:46:17,510 --> 02:46:20,180
What do you think in your
heart of hearts is what I like?

2871
02:46:20,540 --> 02:46:22,340
I like shocking results.

2872
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:26,120
A shocking result is
Mayweather comes out there,

2873
02:46:26,240 --> 02:46:31,240
underestimates Conor McGregor and Connor
puts him at the fucking end of the

2874
02:46:31,551 --> 02:46:36,230
rainbow. He's, he's dancing with
the leprechauns and a pot of gold.

2875
02:46:36,231 --> 02:46:37,160
How did I get here?

2876
02:46:38,750 --> 02:46:41,930
Cause he's in fucking dreamland
cause he face planted. That's,

2877
02:46:41,960 --> 02:46:43,190
that's the exciting result.

2878
02:46:43,191 --> 02:46:47,070
The exciting result is Conor McGregor
becomes the greatest athlete the world's

2879
02:46:47,100 --> 02:46:51,890
ever known and the most famous guy of all
time and a MMA wins. I agree with you.

2880
02:46:52,010 --> 02:46:55,850
All right. That's it man. Love you.
That was awesome. You're the best.

2881
02:46:56,150 --> 02:46:57,620
How can I be the best
when you're the best?
