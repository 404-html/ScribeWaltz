1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,090
I tried to stay off of pornography,

2
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:06,331
man.

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:08,070
That's one of my biggest arch nemesis.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,290
Pornography.

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,290
Why I eat to live with these rich people
for a while speaking to pornography.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,530
The day used to masturbate at night and
I would sneak out there in the kitchen.

7
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:20,341
This is back when the family,

8
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:21,540
he had like a family computer,

9
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:21,851
you know,

10
00:00:21,851 --> 00:00:23,280
and he was in one part of the house,

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,143
right.

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,270
And he's over there just in
the glow of that screen row.

13
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:29,400
And that's back when
the monitors were big,

14
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:29,641
you know?

15
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:32,490
And he's just over there just
fucking looking for the devil.

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,880
And he ended up getting
divorced and it was,

17
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,440
I think a lot of it was because of that.

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,740
The worst is if you're
jerking off with a hat on Bro,

19
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,053
you're going to hell.

20
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,000
That's almost French thing you
can do jacking off Williams Straw.

21
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:49,140
Kentucky Derby has.

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,953
Yeah,

23
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,810
but it's a worse hat to jack off or
attacking Jamia topic cause you have to

24
00:00:57,811 --> 00:00:58,644
balance yourself.

25
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,030
I'm fucking chimney sweep paths

26
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,680
the best to be one of
those Chinese Hasbro.

27
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:10,380
Cause if you squat down
low enough to the ground,

28
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:11,490
you can almost hide under it.

29
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:12,324
And

30
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,710
the other things that'd be dope,

31
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:17,430
Bruh.

32
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,920
The most confusing it would be
like one of them Daniel Boone.

33
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:20,754
Raccoon

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,500
tail of your eye.

35
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,243
You pushed it.

36
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,980
You blow into the tails.

37
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,140
No,

38
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,973
it

39
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,780
scared the fuck out of
my way with his tail.

40
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,280
Right.

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,911
I'm about to finish.

42
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:35,280
He had distracted by the tail God damn.

43
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,030
Choking up dusty coon for

44
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:44,680
and it's harder,

45
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,191
Jackie limb,

46
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:46,470
you're breathing out real fast.

47
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,633
Yeah,

48
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,230
it's more of an intake sport.
