00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,410
So as soon as you have that,

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,490
you don't have any data.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,780
So if you don't have any data,

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,690
then you've got to go.

6
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,360
How you banning people for this?

7
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,000
Like Ronda Rousey fucking went off today.

8
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:12,870
It was beautiful.

9
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,681
I watched that clip.

10
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,470
She went off and drop the
mic after it was over.

11
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,750
And one of the things that she said,

12
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,790
I totally agree with about marijuana.

13
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:21,930
She said this in the past too.

14
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,360
It's an invasion of privacy is what it is.

15
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,430
You're invading someone's privacy.

16
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,200
Just like the fact that if you're,

17
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,760
if you work for a company and the
company decides to test you and you,

18
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,080
you work all week,

19
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:35,100
you do a great job,

20
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:35,934
you work hard.

21
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,150
And then Fridays since five o'clock baby,

22
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:39,984
it's over.

23
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,160
You want to smoke a joint,

24
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:41,880
your home,

25
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,870
you worked all day.

26
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,430
You want to watch the walking dead.

27
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,440
You want to put your feet
up and you want to get high.

28
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,693
You can't,

29
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,590
you fucking can't cause they own you.

30
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,790
They own you.

31
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,110
They own your flesh.

32
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,250
They literally own your mind when you're
not there because everyone knows that

33
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:58,590
marijuana is not psychoactive permanently.

34
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,400
It's not like you smoke a joint on
Friday and then you show up on Monday

35
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:02,401
morning.

36
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:04,830
You're still high as fuck and you're
high for the rest of your life.

37
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,000
That's not the case.

38
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,961
So if you,

39
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:07,740
if you,

40
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,790
if you smoke pot,

41
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,060
you will be tested four
or five weeks from now,

42
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:13,740
you will still test positive.

43
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,170
If you don't smoke any pot,

44
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:16,650
if you,

45
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,520
you get high right now and then four
weeks from now they give you a urinalysis

46
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:20,791
test.

47
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,990
Depending on what they're looking for.

48
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:23,700
If they're just trying
to trace metabolites,

49
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,860
you can still test
positive and four weeks.

50
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,600
That's fucking insane.

51
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,700
It's simply a control thing.

52
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:30,390
It's a power thing.

53
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,200
It's a power thing.

54
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,740
These people or government people or
government people that like to be able to

55
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:35,670
tell people what to do.

56
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,900
That's my concern though,

57
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:38,160
is if it's a power thing,

58
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,480
how deep is it?

59
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,490
How many levels does it go to?

60
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,700
How many judges are friends
would not admit should find out.

61
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,211
Yeah,

62
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:46,920
well they probably already on the case,

63
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,320
but ultimately I hope they're on the case.

64
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,400
Ultimately,

65
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,830
Catholic public outcry,

66
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,041
look,

67
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,030
this is a tyranny.

68
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,670
These are a few people that are deciding,

69
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,653
which is this.

70
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,231
Again,

71
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:00,510
we're not talking about steroids here,

72
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,160
we're just talking about pot.

73
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,780
It just doesn't make sense.

74
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:08,781
And we're also talking about a guy who
passed to World Anti Doping Agency tests.

75
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,400
Those are the most trick fucking
tests in the world of sports.

76
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,160
He passed two of those and failed a quest.

77
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,150
I think it's quest.

78
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:18,941
Again,

79
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:19,350
I'm a,

80
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,610
I apologize from wrong,

81
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,410
but the bottom line is the tests were
not the test that you need when you're

82
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:30,411
taking away a guy's fucking livelihood
and you're finding him for $165,000 out

83
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:31,890
of a $500,000 purse,

84
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,940
which by the way,

85
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,500
he has to pay his managers.

86
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:35,850
He has to pay taxes,

87
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:37,350
he has to be all these different things.

88
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,180
When you make 500 grand,

89
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,940
you don't make 500 grand
because you have a manager,

90
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:45,300
the manager has 10% you ha you might
have an agent and the agent gets a piece.

91
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,530
You might have a lawyer,

92
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:47,820
you might have a business manager,

93
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:48,570
you might have,

94
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,650
you have to pay taxes.

95
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,551
You have training,

96
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:51,860
expensive training partners.

97
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,150
All you mean you have to be very strict.

98
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,270
And Nick is notoriously
disciplined with his diet.

99
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,140
I mean he's,

100
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,800
he eats all food.

101
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:01,120
He's mostly Vegan,

102
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:02,590
except I think he had some fish.

103
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,420
He doesn't need any land animals.

104
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:04,760
He,

105
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,040
and he does this based on the effect
on his body because he's an extreme

106
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:09,821
endurance athlete.

107
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:13,030
He does a lot of triathlons
and he does a lot of running.

108
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,670
He swam back and forth
from Alcatraz twice.

109
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,091
I mean,

110
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:16,990
he's a motherfucker,

111
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:17,231
dude.

112
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,430
He takes care of his body.

113
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,620
And if he's smoking pot,

114
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,840
that should tell you the
pot's not bad for your body.

115
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,430
It's real simple.

116
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,930
But he's not cheating.

117
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,490
He's not doing steroids.

118
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,530
He's not doing anything that
gives them an unfair advantage.

119
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:30,460
He's working hard,

120
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,470
he's tough as shit and he fucking
fight smart and these assholes,

121
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,700
they stole his ability to entertain people
and he's one of the most popular guys

122
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:40,720
in the fucking sport.

123
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,820
When he came back and
fought Anderson Silva,

124
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,980
the paper view was through the roof.

125
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,120
And why was that?

126
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,571
Well,

127
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:49,780
partly because when people want to see
what Anderson Silva would look like after

128
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,280
he came back from a leg injury,

129
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,690
this horrific leg break,

130
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,850
but also it's because
he's fighting Nick Diaz.

131
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,520
You know Nikki has going to
talk shit to him like he did.

132
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,720
Like he got in his face.

133
00:03:58,721 --> 00:03:58,961
He was like,

134
00:03:58,961 --> 00:03:59,501
what bitch?

135
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,100
What bitch?

136
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,080
Like nobody had ever done
that to Anderson Silva before.

137
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,050
He laid down on the ground like
he was making a sleepy face.

138
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:05,201
Like,

139
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:05,381
look,

140
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:07,030
I'm sleep and you're
born the fuck out of me.

141
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,350
And jumped back up to his feet.

142
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:12,160
He humiliated Anderson completely
fucked with his head inside that cage.

143
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,200
That's what people paid for.

144
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,650
And what he is experiencing right now
is a bunch of assholes taken away.

145
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:20,740
His ability to compete,

146
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,070
taken away his ability to thrill
people at what he does best.

147
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,540
It's guys worked for more than a fucking
decade as a professional mixed martial

148
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,374
arts fighter.

149
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,340
More than who knows how many years
before that training and learning how to

150
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:35,950
fight all that's taken
away by some assholes.

151
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,720
We're moving back to Spain.

152
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,573
The and you know.

153
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,430
Oh yeah.

154
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,940
Really?

155
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,390
Oh yeah.

156
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,571
Yeah.

157
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,530
I mean this was always a,

158
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,850
a temporary visit.

159
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,210
This was a slow nomadic trip through
North American Portland and then Spain.

160
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,360
Well it was,

161
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:49,781
I mean,

162
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:51,010
first it was Vancouver,

163
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,440
Canada and uh,

164
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,270
then we were in Nicaragua for the winter.

165
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:58,600
Then we went back to Vancouver and then
we came to la for the winter is when,

166
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:58,850
you know,

167
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,140
you and I had Dunkin started doing
the shrimp parade and all that.

168
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:03,220
I was living in Topanga,

169
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,110
but it's always like a slow move.

170
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:09,580
And then we went to Portland for a year
and a half and now we're going to go

171
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:10,680
back to Barcelona.

172
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,660
What made you decide to go back?

173
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:13,930
Yeah,

174
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,700
well we were always planning to go back.

175
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:16,510
I mean we,

176
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,060
we sort of flirted with
maybe staying for a while.

177
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:20,890
Um,

178
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,000
but my wife's a doctor and for her to
get a license in the u s would mean like

179
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,860
going back to medical school essentially,

180
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:27,820
which she's not going to do.

181
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,653
Right.

182
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,440
Um,

183
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,470
and she really likes,

184
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,250
uh,

185
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:33,940
working.

186
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,880
She hasn't worked in four years
while we've been traveling.

187
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:37,714
So,

188
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,111
you know,

189
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:38,950
that's an issue.

190
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,260
Like if she's going to
continue practicing.

191
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:41,980
Um,

192
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,960
but also just that we really liked Spain.

193
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:44,111
You know,

194
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,000
I've lived in Spain most of my life.

195
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:46,750
Um,

196
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,450
I've lived in Barcelona longer
than I've lived anywhere else,

197
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:49,830
but you know,

198
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,600
and what is it about Barcelona
that's more appealing in America?

199
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,261
You know,

200
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:55,030
when I first got to Spain,

201
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,300
I felt I traveled a lot and I was
actually on my way somewhere else,

202
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,360
but I got robbed and,

203
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:02,670
you know,

204
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,670
I ended up hanging out and the
way Spanish people see life,

205
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:08,700
uh,

206
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,060
is much closer to the way I see life.

207
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,360
And so even though I
was raised in America,

208
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:18,710
I never felt like this country
never really made sense to me.

209
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,613
How so?

210
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,121
Well,

211
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:21,860
like what we're just
talking about like work,

212
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,790
materialism,

213
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,990
materialism,

214
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:24,561
you know,

215
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:25,790
it's all about the money.

216
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,110
Spanish people that,

217
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,411
you know,

218
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:28,970
the expression is we work to live.

219
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,930
We don't live to work.

220
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,600
Right.

221
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,070
Um,

222
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,431
you know,

223
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:31,851
there no,

224
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,200
like Spanish cars.

225
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,360
There's no cup holder if you want.

226
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,290
Do you want to get a drink?

227
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,000
Pull over in a cafe and get a drink?

228
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,860
There are no to go cups.

229
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,970
You want a coffee?

230
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,990
Go to a cafe.

231
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,830
They really,

232
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,330
yeah,

233
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,360
there it's like someone should tell
them about cups and lids on them.

234
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,670
The fuck is wrong with those tapes.

235
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,200
Crazy,

236
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,220
uncivilized,

237
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:54,140
heathen fucking cave people.

238
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:54,670
Um,

239
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,503
sack hops.

240
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:55,790
You know,

241
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,960
even though Spain is,

242
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:57,291
you know,

243
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,940
officially a Catholic country,

244
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,550
there's so much more
chilled out about sex,

245
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,653
about,

246
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,170
uh,

247
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,700
sex outside of marriage.

248
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,121
Like,

249
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:05,600
Eh,

250
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,171
whatever.

251
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:07,400
Just don't tell me about it.

252
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:09,380
That's the sort of normal
way to deal with it.

253
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:10,643
Um,

254
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,660
women,

255
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,390
no,

256
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,070
you look,

257
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,650
I've lived in Spain 23 years or something,

258
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:15,920
right?

259
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,260
I get accustomed when I
see a beautiful woman.

260
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:22,430
I look at her and she knows I'm looking
at her and she appreciates it and she

261
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:24,410
smiles and I smile and everybody's happy.

262
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,500
Come to America.

263
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,420
Look at a woman like that.

264
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:29,240
You're a fucking rapist raping me.

265
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,420
If you heard that my question questions.

266
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,640
I mean fuck your micro aggressions.

267
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,700
I don't want to hear if
you're not a fucking dwarf.

268
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:39,350
I don't want to hear
about microaggressions.

269
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,580
Gimme a break.

270
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:41,931
I mean,

271
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:43,910
this country is just nuts man.

272
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:47,740
And like it and I feel
bad because they're there.

273
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,770
I love people here.

274
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:49,760
I've got great friends here.

275
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,330
There are a lot of things I love about it.

276
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,950
Like the,

277
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,783
you know,

278
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,720
work wise,

279
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:54,920
it's the best place to be.

280
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,390
But um,

281
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,010
lifewise fuck,

282
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:58,790
I love Spain.

283
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,990
You go out to lunch with a friend,

284
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,260
it's probably going to go
till five or six o'clock.

285
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,880
Then everybody just hangs out.

286
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,530
Yeah,

287
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:06,890
no,

288
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,850
like restaurants,

289
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,150
right?

290
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,570
I'm sitting in a restaurant
and we're talking the way,

291
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:11,991
first of all,

292
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,030
the waiter's going to
come four times and ask,

293
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,360
you know,

294
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,193
how is everything?

295
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:15,741
How are you?

296
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:16,071
Oh,

297
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:16,761
how's your day going?

298
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:17,241
Fuck you.

299
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:18,030
Get away.

300
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,730
I've tried trying to
talk to my friend here,

301
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,200
right then.

302
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,940
Then they'll come and say,

303
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:24,140
are you still working on that?

304
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,820
This isn't work.

305
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:26,930
This is fucking lunch.

306
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,600
But my work and on that get out of here,

307
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,790
drive me crazy tips,

308
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,250
20% I go to Portland,

309
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:34,880
I fucking,

310
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,121
you know,

311
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:36,770
buy a croissant and a cup of coffee.

312
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:38,270
There's a big tip jar I run.

313
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:41,060
My credit card had 10% 15% what?

314
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:43,580
You just handed me a
fucking bag and a cup.

315
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:45,920
I'm supposed to give you 15% extra.

316
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,460
That's because your boss is too
fucking cheap to pay you a decent wage.

317
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,200
[inaudible].
